  <h2><a name="ch1"
     id="ch1">CHAPTER I. &mdash; OLD WAYS AND NEW</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Progress is like the insidious change from youth to old age,
  except that progress does not mean decay. The change that is almost
  imperceptible and yet inexorable is much the same, however. You will see a
  community apparently changeless as the years pass by; and yet, when the years
  have gone and you look back, there has been a change. It is not the same. It
  never will be the same. It can pass through further change, but it cannot go
  back. Men look back sick sometimes with longing for the things that were and
  that can be no more; they live the old days in memory&mdash;but try as they
  will they may not go back. With intelligent, persistent effort they may
  retard further change considerably, but that is the most that they can hope
  to do. Civilization and Time will continue the march in spite of all that man
  may do.</p>

  <p>That is the way it was with the Flying U. Old J. G. Whitmore fought
  doggedly against the changing conditions&mdash;and he fought intelligently
  and well. When he saw the range dwindling and the way to the watering places
  barred against his cattle with long stretches of barbed wire, he sent his
  herds deeper into the Badlands to seek what grazing was in the hidden, little
  valleys and the deep, sequestered canyons. He cut more hay for winter
  feeding, and he sowed his meadows to alfalfa that he might increase the
  crops. He shipped old cows and dry cows with his fat steers in the fall, and
  he bettered the blood of his herds and raised bigger cattle. Therefore, if
  his cattle grew fewer in number, they improved in quality and prices went
  higher, so that the result was much the same.</p>

  <p>It began to look, then, as though J. G. Whitmore was cunningly besting the
  situation, and was going to hold out indefinitely against the encroachments
  of civilization upon the old order of things on the range. And it had begun
  to look as though he was going to best Time at his own game, and refuse also
  to grow old; as though he would go on being the same pudgy, grizzled,
  humorously querulous Old Man beloved of his men, the Happy Family of the
  Flying U.</p>

  <p>Sometimes, however, Time will fill a four-flush with the joker, and then
  laugh while he rakes in the chips. J. G. Whitmore had been going his way and
  refusing to grow old for a long time&mdash;and then an accident, which is
  Time's joker, turned the game against him. He stood for just a second too
  long on a crowded crossing in Chicago, hesitating between going forward or
  back. And that second gave Time a chance to play an accident. A big
  seven-passenger touring car mowed him down and left him in a heap for the
  ambulance from the nearest hospital to gather on its stretcher.</p>

  <p>The Old Man did not die; he had lived long on the open range and he was
  pretty tough and hard to kill. He went back to his beloved Flying U, with a
  crutch to help him shuffle from bed to easy chair and back again.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, who was his youngest sister, nursed him tirelessly; but
  it was long before there came a day when the Old Man gave his crutch to the
  Kid to use for a stick-horse, and walked through the living room and out upon
  the porch with the help of a cane and the solicitous arm of the Little
  Doctor, and with the Kid galloping gleefully before him on the crutch.</p>

  <p>Later he discarded the help of somebody's arm, and hobbled down to the
  corral with the cane, and with the Kid still galloping before him on "Uncle
  Gee Gee's" crutch. He stood for some time leaning against the corral watching
  some of the boys halter-breaking a horse that was later to be sold&mdash;when
  he was "broke gentle"&mdash;and then he hobbled back again, thankful for the
  soft comfort of his big chair.</p>

  <p>That was well enough, as far as it went. The Flying U took it for granted
  that the Old Man was slowly returning to the old order of life, when
  rheumatism was his only foe and he could run things with his old energy and
  easy good management. But there never came a day when the Old Man gave his
  cane to the kid to play with. There never came a day when he was not thankful
  for the soft comfort of his chair. There never came a day when he was the
  same Old Man who joshed the boys and scolded them and threatened them. The
  day was always coming&mdash;of course!&mdash;when his back would quit aching
  if he walked to the stable and back without a long rest between, but it never
  actually arrived.</p>

  <p>So, imperceptibly but surely, the Old Man began to grow old. The thin spot
  on top of his head grew shiny, so that the Kid noticed it and made blunt
  comments upon the subject. His rheumatism was not his worst foe, now. He had
  to pet his digestive apparatus and cut out strong coffee with three heaping
  teaspoons of sugar in each cup, because the Little Doctor told him his liver
  was torpid. He had to stop giving the Kid jolty rides on his knees,&mdash;but
  that was because the Kid was getting too big for baby play, the Old Man
  declared. The Kid was big enough to ride real horses, now, and he ought to be
  ashamed to ride knee-horses any more.</p>

  <p>To two things the Old Man clung almost fiercely; the old regime of ranging
  his cattle at large and starting out the wagons in the spring just the same
  as if twenty-five men instead of twelve went with them; and the retention of
  the Happy Family on his payroll, just as if they were actually needed. If one
  of the boys left to try other things and other fields, the Old Man considered
  him gone on a vacation and expected him back when spring roundup
  approached.</p>

  <p>True, he was seldom disappointed in that. For the Happy Family looked upon
  the Flying U as home, and six months was about the limit for straying afar.
  Cowpunchers to the bone though they were, they bent backs over irrigating
  ditches and sweated in the hay fields just for the sake of staying together
  on the ranch. I cannot say that they did it uncomplainingly&mdash;for the
  bunk-house was saturated to the ridge-pole with their maledictions while they
  compared blistered hands and pitchfork callouses, and mourned the days that
  were gone; the days when they rode far and free and scorned any work that
  could not be done from the saddle. But they stayed, and they did the ranch
  work as well as the range work, which is the main point.</p>

  <p>They became engaged to certain girls who filled their dreams and all their
  waking thoughts&mdash;but they never quite came to the point of marrying and
  going their way. Except Pink, who did marry impulsively and unwisely, and who
  suffered himself to be bullied and called Percy for seven months or so, and
  who balked at leaving the Flying U for the city and a vicarious existence in
  theaterdom, and so found himself free quite as suddenly as he had been
  tied.</p>

  <p>They intended to marry and settle down&mdash;sometime. But there was
  always something in the way of carrying those intentions to fulfillment, so
  that eventually the majority of the Happy Family found themselves not even
  engaged, but drifting along toward permanent bachelorhood. Being of the
  optimistic type, however, they did not worry; Pink having set before them a
  fine example of the failure of marriage and having returned with manifest
  relief to the freedom of the bunk-house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch2"
     id="ch2">II. &mdash; ANDY GREEN'S NEW ACQUAINTANCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andy Green, chief prevaricator of the Happy Family of the
  Flying U&mdash;and not ashamed of either title or connection&mdash;pushed
  his new Stetson back off his untanned forehead, attempted to negotiate the
  narrow passage into a Pullman sleeper with his suitcase swinging from his
  right hand, and butted into a woman who was just emerging from the
  dressingroom. He butted into her so emphatically that he was compelled to
  swing his left arm out very quickly, or see her go headlong into the window
  opposite; for a fullsized suitcase propelled forward by a muscular young man
  may prove a very efficient instrument of disaster, especially if it catches
  one just in the hollow back of the knee. The woman tottered and grasped Andy
  convulsively to save herself a fall, and so they stood blocking the passage
  until the porter arrived and took the suitcase from Andy with a tip-inviting
  deference.</p>

  <p>Andy apologized profusely, with a quaint, cowpunchery phrasing that caused
  the woman to take a second look at him. And, since Andy Green would look good
  to any woman capable of recognizing&mdash;and appreciating&mdash;a real man
  when she saw him, she smiled and said it didn't matter in the least.</p>

  <p>That was the beginning of the acquaintance. Andy took her by her plump,
  chiffon-veiled arm and piloted her to her seat, and he afterward tipped the
  porter generously and had his own belongings deposited in the section across
  the aisle. Then, with the guile of a foreign diplomat, he betook himself to
  the smoking-room and stayed there for three quarters of an hour. He was not
  taking any particular risk of losing the opportunity of an unusually pleasant
  journey, for the dollar he had invested in the goodwill of the porter had
  yielded the information that the lady was going through to Great Falls. Since
  Andy had boarded the train at Harlem there was plenty of time to kill between
  there and Dry Lake, which was his destination.</p>

  <p>The lady smiled at him rememberingly when finally he seated himself across
  the aisle from her, and without any serious motive Andy smiled back. So
  presently they were exchanging remarks about the journey. Later on, Andy went
  over and sat beside her and conversation began in earnest. Her name, it
  transpired, was Florence Grace Hallman. Andy read it engraved upon a card
  which added the information that she was engaged in the real estate
  business&mdash;or so the three or four words implied. "Homemakers' Syndicate,
  Minneapolis and St. Paul," said the card. Andy was visibly impressed thereby.
  He looked at her with swift appraisement and decided that she was "all to the
  good."</p>

  <p>Florence Grace Hallman was tall and daintily muscular as to figure. Her
  hair was a light yellow&mdash;not quite the shade which peroxide gives, and
  therefore probably natural. Her eyes were brown, a shade too close together
  but cool and calm and calculating in their gaze, and her eyebrows slanted
  upward a bit at the outer ends and were as heavy as beauty permitted. Her
  lips were very red, and her chin was very firm. She looked the successful
  business woman to her fingertips, and she was eminently attractive for a
  woman of that self-assured type.</p>

  <p>Andy was attractive also, in a purely Western way. His gray eyes were
  deceivingly candid and his voice was pleasant with a little, humorous drawl
  that matched well the quirk of his lips when he talked. He was headed for
  home&mdash;which was the Flying U&mdash;sober and sunny and with enough money
  to see him through. He told Florence Hallman his name, and said that he lived
  "up the road a ways" without being too definite. Florence Hallman lived in
  Minneapolis, she said; though she traveled most of the time, in the interests
  of her firm.</p>

  <p>Yes, she liked the real estate business. One had a chance to see the
  world, and keep in touch with people and things. She liked the West
  especially well. Since her firm had taken up the homeseekers' line she spent
  most of her time in the West.</p>

  <p>They had supper&mdash;she called it dinner, Andy observed&mdash;together,
  and Andy Green paid the check, which was not so small. It was after that,
  when they became more confidential, that Florence Hallman, with the egotism
  of the successful person who believes herself or himself to be of keen
  interest to the listener spoke in greater detail of her present mission.</p>

  <p>Her firm's policy was, she said, to locate a large tract of government
  land somewhere, and then organize a homeseekers' colony, and settle the
  land-hungry upon the tract&mdash;at so much per hunger. She thought it a
  great scheme for both sides of the transaction. The men who wanted claims got
  them. The firm got the fee for showing them the land&mdash;and certain other
  perquisites at which she merely hinted.</p>

  <p>She thought that Andy himself would be a success at the business. She was
  quick to form her opinions of people whom she met, and she knew that Andy was
  just the man for such work. Andy, listening with his candid, gray eyes
  straying often to her face and dwelling there, modestly failed to agree with
  her. He did not know the first thing about the real estate business, he
  confessed, nor very much about ranching. Oh, yes&mdash;he lived in this
  country, and he knew THAT pretty well, but&mdash;</p>

  <p>"The point is right here," said Florence Grace Hallman, laying her pink
  fingertips upon his arm and glancing behind her to make sure that they were
  practically alone&mdash;their immediate neighbors being still in the diner.
  "I'm speaking merely upon impulse&mdash;which isn't a wise thing to do,
  ordinarily. But&mdash;well, your eyes vouch for you, Mr. Green, and we women
  are bound to act impulsively sometimes&mdash;or we wouldn't be women, would
  we?" She laughed&mdash;rather, she gave a little, infectious giggle, and took
  away her fingers, to the regret of Andy who liked the feel of them on his
  forearm.</p>

  <p>"The point is here. I've recognized the fact, all along, that we need a
  man stationed right here, living in the country, who will meet prospective
  homesteaders and talk farming; keep up their enthusiasm; whip the doubters
  into line; talk climate and soil and the future of the country; look the
  part, you understand."</p>

  <p>"So I look like a rube, do I?" Andy's lips quirked a half smile at
  her.</p>

  <p>"No, of course you don't!" She laid her fingers on his sleeve again, which
  was what Andy wanted&mdash;what he had intended to bait her into doing;
  thereby proving that, in some respects at least, he amply justified Hiss
  Hallman in her snap judgment of him.</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't look like a rube! I don't want you to. But you do
  look Western&mdash;because you are Western to the bone Besides, you look
  perfectly dependable. Nobody could look into your eyes and even think of
  doubting the truth of any statement you made to them." Andy snickered
  mentally at that though his eyes never lost their clear candor. "And," she
  concluded, "being a bona fide resident of the country, your word would carry
  more weight than mine if I were to talk myself black in the face!"</p>

  <p>"That's where you're dead wrong," Andy hastened to correct her.</p>

  <p>"Well, you must let me have my own opinion, Mr. Green. You would be
  convincing enough, at any rate. You see, there is a certain per cent
  of&mdash;let us call it waste effort&mdash;in this colonization business. We
  have to reckon on a certain number of nibblers who won't bite&mdash;" Andy's
  honest, gray eyes widened a hair's breadth at the frankness of her
  language&mdash;" when they get out here. They swallow the folders we send
  out, but when they get out here and see the country, they can't see it as a
  rich farming district, and they won't invest. They go back home and knock, if
  they do anything.</p>

  <p>"My idea is to stop that waste; to land every homeseeker that boards our
  excursion trains. And I believe the way to do that is to have the right kind
  of a man out here, steer the doubtfuls against him&mdash;and let his
  personality and his experience do the rest. They're hungry enough to come,
  you see; the thing is to keep them here. A man that lives right here, that
  has all the earmarks of the West, and is not known to be affiliated with our
  Syndicate (you could have rigs to hire, and drive the doubtfuls to the
  tract)&mdash;don't you see what an enormous advantage he'd have? The class I
  speak of are the suspicious ones&mdash;those who are from Missouri. They're
  inclined to want salt with what we say about the resources of the country.
  Even our chemical analysis of the soil, and weather bureau dope, don't go
  very far with those hicks. They want to talk with someone who has tried it,
  you see."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;see," said Andy thoughtfully, and his eyes narrowed a trifle. "On
  the square, Miss Hallman, what are the natural advantages out here&mdash;for
  farming? What line of talk do you give those come-ons?"</p>

  <p>Miss Hallman laughed and made a very pretty gesture with her two ringed
  hands. "Whatever sounds the best to them," she said. "If they write and ask
  about spuds we come back with illustrated folders of potato crops and
  statistics of average yields and prices and all that. If it's dairy, we have
  dairy folders. And so on. It isn't any fraud&mdash;there ARE sections of the
  country that produce almost anything, from alfalfa to strawberries. You know
  that," she challenged.</p>

  <p>"Sure. But I didn't know there was much tillable land left lying around
  loose," he ventured to say.</p>

  <p>Again Miss Hallman made the pretty gesture, which might mean much or
  nothing. "There's plenty of land 'lying around loose,' as you call it. How do
  you know it won't produce, till it has been tried?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Andy assented uneasily. "If there's water to put on
  it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And since there is the land, our business lies in getting people located
  on it. The towns and the railroads are back of us. That is, they look with
  favor upon bringing settlers into the country. It increases the business of
  the country&mdash;the traffic, the freights, the merchants' business,
  everything."</p>

  <p>Andy puckered his eyebrows and looked out of the window upon a great
  stretch of open, rolling prairie, clothed sparely in grass that was showing
  faint green in the hollows, and with no water for miles&mdash;as he knew
  well&mdash;except for the rivers that hurried through narrow bottom lands
  guarded by high bluffs that were for the most part barren. The land was
  there, all right. But&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What I can't see," he observed after a minute during which Miss Florence
  Hallman studied his averted face, "what I can't see is, where do the settlers
  get off at?"</p>

  <p>"At Easy street, if they're lucky enough," she told him lightly. "My
  business is to locate them on the land. Getting a living off it is THEIR
  business. And," she added defensively, "people do make a living on ranches
  out here."</p>

  <p>"That's right," he agreed again&mdash;he was finding it very pleasant to
  agree with Florence Grace Hallman. "Mostly off stock, though."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and we encourage our clients to bring out all the young stock they
  possibly can; young cows and horses and&mdash;all that sort of thing. There's
  quantities of open country around here, that even the most optimistic of
  homeseekers would never think of filing on. They can make out, all right, I
  guess. We certainly urge them strongly to bring stock with them. It's always
  been famous as a cattle country&mdash;that's one of our highest cards. We
  tell them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How do you do that? Do you go right to them and TALK to them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if they show a strong enough interest&mdash;and bank account. I
  follow up the best prospects and visit them in person. I've talked to fifty
  horny-handed he-men in the past month."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't see what you need of anyone to bring up the drag," Andy told
  her admiringly. "If you talk to 'em, there oughtn't be any drag!"</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the implied compliment. But there IS a 'drag,' as you call
  it. There's going to be a big one, too, I'm afraid&mdash;when they get out
  and see this tract we're going to work off this spring." She stopped and
  studied him as a chess player studies the board.</p>

  <p>"I'm very much tempted to tell you something I shouldn't tell," she said
  at length, lowering her voice a little. Remember, Andy Green was a very good
  looking man, and his eyes were remarkable for their clear, candid gaze
  straight into your own eyes. Even as keen a business woman as Florence Grace
  Hallman must be forgiven for being deceived by them." I'm tempted to tell you
  where this tract is. You may know it."</p>

  <p>"You better not, unless you're willing to take a chance," he told her
  soberly. "If it looks too good, I'm liable to jump it myself."</p>

  <p>Miss Hallman laughed and twisted her red lips at him in what might be
  construed as a flirtatious manner. She was really quite taken with Andy
  Green. "I'll take a chance. I don't think you'll jump it. Do you know
  anything about Dry Lake, up above Havre, toward Great Falls&mdash;and the
  country out east of there, towards the mountains?"</p>

  <p>The fingers of Andy Green closed into his palms. His eyes, however,
  continued to look into hers with his most guileless expression.</p>

  <p>"Y-es&mdash;that is, I've ridden over it," he acknowledged simply.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;now this is a secret; at least we don't want those mossback
  ranchers in there to get hold of it too soon, though they couldn't really do
  anything, since it's all government land and the lease has only just run out.
  There's a high tract lying between the Bear Paws and&mdash;do you know where
  the Flying U ranch is?"</p>

  <p>"About where it is&mdash;yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's right up there on that plateau&mdash;bench, you call it out
  here. There are several thousand acres along in there that we're locating
  settlers on this spring. We're just waiting for the grass to get nice and
  green, and the prairie to get all covered with those blue, blue wind flowers,
  and the meadow larks to get busy with their nests, and then we're going to
  bring them out and&mdash;" She spread her hands again. It seemed a favorite
  gesture grown into a habit, and it surely was more eloquent than words.
  "These prairies will be a dream of beauty, in a little while," she said. "I'm
  to watch for the psychological time to bring out the seekers. And if I could
  just interest you, Mr. Green, to the extent of being somewhere around Dry
  Lake, with a good team that you will drive for hire and some samples of oats
  and dry-land spuds and stuff that you raised on your claim&mdash;" She eyed
  him sharply for one so endearingly feminine. "Would you do it? There'd be a
  salary, and besides that a commission on each doubter you landed. And I'd
  just love to have you for one of my assistants."</p>

  <p>"It sure sounds good," Andy flirted with the proposition, and let his eyes
  soften appreciably to meet her last sentence and the tone in which she spoke
  it. "Do you think I could get by with the right line of talk with the
  doubters?"</p>

  <p>"I think you could," she said, and in her voice there was a cooing note.
  "Study up a little on the right dope, and I think you could
  convince&mdash;even me."</p>

  <p>"Could I?" Andy Green knew that cooing note, himself, and one a shade more
  provocative. "I wonder!"</p>

  <p>A man came down the aisle at that moment, gave Andy a keen glance and went
  on with a cigar between his fingers. Andy scowled frankly, sighed and
  straightened his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"That's what I call hard luck," he grumbled, "got to see that man before he
  gets off the train&mdash;and the h&mdash;worst of it is, I don't know just
  what station he'll get off at." He sighed again. "I've got a deal on," he
  told her confidentially, "that's sure going to keep me humping if I pull
  loose so as to go in with you. How long did you say?"</p>

  <p>"Probably two weeks, the way spring is opening out here. I'd want you to
  get perfectly familiar with our policy and the details of our scheme before
  they land. I'd want you to be familiar with that tract and be able to show up
  its best points when you take seekers out there. You'd be so much better than
  one of our own men, who have the word 'agent' written all over them. You'll
  come back and&mdash;talk it over, won't you?" For Andy was showing
  unmistakable symptoms of leaving her to follow the man.</p>

  <p>"You KNOW it," he declared in a tone of "I won't sleep nights till this
  thing is settled&mdash;and settled right." He gave her a smile that rather
  dazzled the lady, got up with much reluctance and, with a glance that had in
  it a certain element of longing, went swaying down the aisle after the man who
  had preceded him.</p>

  <p>Andy's business with the man consisted solely in mixing cigarette smoke
  with cigar smoke and of helping to stare moodily out of the window. Words
  there were none, save when Andy was proffered a match and muttered his
  thanks. The silent session lasted for half an hour. Then the man got up and
  went out, and the breath of Andy Green paused behind his nostrils until he
  saw that the man went only to the first section in the car and settled there
  behind a spread newspaper, invisible to Florence Grace Hallman unless she
  searched the car and peered over the top of the paper to see who was
  behind.</p>

  <p>After that Andy Green continued to stare out of the window, seeing nothing
  of the scenery but the flicker of telegraph posts before his eyes that were
  visioning the future.</p>

  <p>The Flying U ranch hemmed in by homesteaders from the East, he saw;
  homesteaders who were being urged to bring all the stock they could, and turn
  it loose upon the shrinking range. Homesteaders who would fence the country
  into squares, and tear up the grass and sow grain that might never bear a
  harvest. Homesteaders who would inevitably grow poorer upon the land that
  would suck their strength and all their little savings and turn them loose
  finally to forage a living where they might. Homesteaders who would ruin the
  land that ruined them...It was not a pleasing picture, but it was more
  pleasing than the picture he saw of the Flying U after these human grass
  hoppers had settled there.</p>

  <p>The range that fed the Flying U stock would feed no more and hide their
  ribs at shipping time. That he knew too well. Old J. G. Whitmore and Chip
  would have to sell out. And that was like death; indeed, it IS death of a
  sort, when one of the old outfits is wiped out of existence. It had happened
  before&mdash;happened too often to make pleasant memories for Andy Green, who
  could name outfit after outfit that had been forced out of business by the
  settling of the range land; who could name dozens of cattle brands once seen
  upon the range, and never glimpsed now from spring roundup until fall.</p>

  <p>Must the Flying U brand disappear also? The good old Flying U, for whose
  existence the Old Man had fought and schemed since first was raised the cry
  that the old range was passing? The Flying U that had become a part of his
  life? Andy let his cigarette grow cold; he roused only to swear at the porter
  who entered with dust cloth and a deprecating grin.</p>

  <p>After that, Andy thought of Florence Grace Hallman&mdash;and his eyes were
  not particularly sentimental. There was a hard line about his mouth also;
  though Florence Grace Hallman was but a pawn in the game, after all, and not
  personally guilty of half the deliberate crimes Andy laid upon her dimpled
  shoulders. With her it was pure, cold-blooded business, this luring of the
  land-hungry to a land whose fertility was at best problematical; who would,
  for a price, turn loose the victims of her greed to devastate what little
  grazing ground was left.</p>

  <p>The train neared Havre. Andy roused himself, rang for the porter and sent
  him after his suitcase and coat. Then he sauntered down the aisle, stopped
  beside Florence Grace Hallman and smiled down at her with a gleam behind the
  clear candor of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hard luck, lady," he murmured, leaning toward her. "I'm just simply
  loaded to the guards with responsibilities, and here's where I get off. But
  I'm sure glad I met yuh, and I'll certainly think day and night about you
  and&mdash;all you told me about. I'd like to get in on this land deal. Fact
  is, I'm going to make it my business to get in on it. Maybe my way of working
  won't suit you&mdash;but I'll sure work hard for any boss and do the best I
  know how."</p>

  <p>"I think that will suit me," Miss Hallman assured him, and smiled
  unsuspectingly up into his eyes, which she thought she could read so easily.
  "When shall I see you again? Could you come to Great Falls in the next ten
  days? I shall be stopping at the Park. Or if you will leave me your
  address&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No use. I'll be on the move and a letter wouldn't get me. I'll see yuh
  later, anyway. I'm bound to. And when I do, we'll get down to cases. Good
  bye."</p>

  <p>He was turning away when Miss Hallman put out a soft, jewelled hand. She
  thought it was diffidence that made Andy Green hesitate perceptibly before he
  took it. She thought it was simply a masculine shyness and confusion that
  made him clasp her fingers loosely and let them go on the instant. She did
  not see him rub his palm down the leg of his dark gray trousers as he walked
  down the aisle, and if she had she would not have seen any significance in
  the movement.</p>

  <p>Andy Green did that again before he stepped off the train. For he felt
  that he had shaken hands with a traitor to himself and his outfit, and it
  went against the grain. That the traitor was a woman, and a charming woman at
  that, only intensified his resentment against her. A man can fight a man and
  keep his self respect; but a man does mortally dread being forced into a
  position where he must fight a woman.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch3"
     id="ch3">III. &mdash; THE KID LEARNS SOME THINGS ABOUT HORSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Kid&mdash;Chip's Kid and the Little Doctor's&mdash;was
  six years old and big for his age. Also he was a member in good standing of
  the Happy Family and he insisted upon being called Buck outside the house;
  within it the Little Doctor insisted even more strongly that he answer to the
  many endearing names she had invented for him, and to the more formal one of
  Claude, which really belonged to Daddy Chip.</p>

  <p>Being six years old and big for his age, and being called Buck by his
  friends, the Happy Family, the Kid decided that he should have a man's-sized
  horse of his own, to feed and water and ride and proudly call his "string."
  Having settled that important point, he began to cast about him for a horse
  worthy his love and ownership, and speedily he decided that matter also.</p>

  <p>Therefore, he ran bareheaded up to the blacksmith shop where Daddy Chip
  was hammering tunefully upon the anvil, and delivered his ultimatum from the
  door way.</p>

  <p>"Silver's going to be my string, Daddy Chip, and I'm going to feed him
  myself and ride him myself and nobody else can touch him 'thout I say they
  can."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Chip squinted along a dully-glowing iron bar, laid it back upon the
  anvil and gave it another whack upon the side that still bulged a little.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I'm going to saddle him myself and everything. And I want you to
  get me some jingling silver spurs like Mig has got, with chains that hang
  away down and rattle when you walk." The Kid lifted one small foot and laid a
  grimy finger in front of his heel by way of illustration.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" Chip's eyes twinkled briefly and immediately became intent upon his
  work.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and Doctor Dell has got to let me sleep in the bunk-house with the
  rest of the fellers. And I ain't going to wear a nightie once more! I don't
  have to, do I, Daddy Chip? Not with lace on it. Happy Jack says I'm a girl
  long as I wear lace nighties, and I ain't a girl. Am I, Daddy Chip?"</p>

  <p>"I should say not!" Chip testified emphatically, and carried the iron bar
  to the forge for further heating.</p>

  <p>"I'm going on roundup too, tomorrow afternoon." The Kid's conception of
  time was extremely sketchy and had no connection whatever with the calendar.
  "I'm going to keep Silver in the little corral and let him sleep in the box
  stall where his leg got well that time he broke it. I 'member when he had a
  rag tied on it and teased for sugar. And the Countess has got to quit a
  kickin' every time I need sugar for my string. Ain't she, Daddy Chip? She's
  got to let us men alone or there'll be something doing!"</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man," said Chip inattentively, only half hearing the war-like
  declaration of his offspring&mdash;as is the way with busy fathers.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take a ride now on Silver. I guess I'll ride in to Dry Lake
  and get the mail&mdash;and I'm 'pletely outa the makings, too."</p>

  <p>"Uh-hunh&mdash;a&mdash;what's that? You keep off Silver. He'll kick the
  daylights out of you, Kid. Where's your hat? Didn't your mother tell you
  she'd tie a sunbonnet on you if you didn't keep your hat on? You better hike
  back and get it, young man, before she sees you."</p>

  <p>The Kid stared mutinously from the doorway. "You said I could have Silver.
  What's the use of having a string if a feller can't ride it? And I CAN ride
  him, and he don't kick at all. I rode him just now, in the little pasture to
  see if I liked his gait better than the others. I rode Banjo first and I
  wouldn't own a thing like him, on a bet. Silver'll do me till I can get
  around to break a real one."</p>

  <p>Chip's hand dropped from the bellows while he stared hard at the Kid. "Did
  you go down in the pasture and&mdash;" Words failed him just then.</p>

  <p>"I'd TELL a man I did!" the Kid retorted, with a perfect imitation of
  Chip's manner and tone when crossed. "I've been trying out all the darned
  benchest you've got&mdash;and there ain't a one I'd give a punched nickel for
  but Silver. I'd a rode Shootin' Star, only he wouldn't stand still so I could
  get onto him. whoever broke him did a bum job. The horse I break will stand,
  or I'll know the reason why. Silver'll stand, all right. And I can guide him
  pretty well by slapping his neck. You did a pretty fair job when you broke
  Silver," the Kid informed his father patronizingly.</p>

  <p>Chip said something which the Kid was not supposed to hear, and sat
  suddenly down upon the stone rim of the forge. It had never before occurred
  to Chip that his Kid was no longer a baby, but a most adventurous man-child
  who had lived all his life among men and whose mental development had more
  than kept pace with his growing body. He had laughed with the others at the
  Kid's quaint precociousness of speech and at his frank worship of range men
  and range life. He had gone to some trouble to find a tractable Shetland pony
  the size of a burro, and had taught the Kid to ride, decorously and fully
  protected from accident.</p>

  <p>He and the Little Doctor had been proud of the Kid's masculine traits as
  they manifested themselves in the management of that small specimen of horse
  flesh. That the Kid should have outgrown so quickly his content with Stubby
  seemed much more amazing than it really was. He eyed the Kid doubtfully for a
  minute, and then grinned.</p>

  <p>"All that don't let you out on the hat question," he said, evading the
  real issue and laying stress upon the small matter of obedience, as is the
  exasperating habit of parents. "You don't see any of the bunch going around
  bareheaded. Only women and babies do that."</p>

  <p>"The bunch goes bareheaded when they get their hats blowed off in the
  creek," the Kid pointed out unmoved. "I've seen you lose your hat mor'n once,
  old timer. That's nothing." He sent Chip a sudden, adorable smile which
  proclaimed him the child of his mother and which never failed to thrill Chip
  secretly,&mdash;it was so like the Little Doctor. "You lend me your hat for a
  while, dad," he said. "She never said what hat I had to wear, just so it's a
  hat. Honest to gran'ma, my hat's in the creek and I couldn't poke it out with
  a stick or anything. It sailed into the swimmin' hole. I was goin' to go
  after it," he explained further, "but&mdash;a snake was swimmin'&mdash;and I
  hated to 'sturb him."</p>

  <p>Chip drew a sharp breath and for one panicky moment considered imperative
  the hiring of a body-guard for his Kid.</p>

  <p>"You keep out of the pasture, young man!" His tone was stern to match his
  perturbation. "And you leave Silver alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Kid did not wait for more. He lifted up his voice and wept in
  bitterness of spirit. Wept so that one could hear him a mile. Wept so that J.
  G. Whitmore reading the Great Falls Tribune on the porch, laid down his paper
  and asked the world at large what ailed that doggoned kid now.</p>

  <p>"Dell, you better go see what's wrong," he called afterwards through the
  open door to the Little Doctor, who was examining a jar of germ cultures in
  her "office."
  
  <p>"Chances is he's fallen off the stable or
  something&mdash;though he sounds more mad than hurt. If it wasn't for my
  doggoned back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor passed him hurriedly. When her man-child wept, it needed
  no suggestion from J. G. or anyone else to send her flying to the rescue. So
  presently she arrived breathless at the blacksmith shop and found Chip
  within, looking in urgent need of reinforcements, and the Kid yelling
  ragefully beside the door and kicking the log wall with vicious
  boot-tees.</p>

  <p>"Shut up now or I'll spank you!" Chip was saying desperately when his wife
  appeared. "I wish you'd take that Kid and tie him up, Dell," he added
  snappishly. "Here he's been riding all the horses in the little
  pasture&mdash;and taking a chance on breaking his neck! And he ain't
  satisfied with Stubby&mdash;he thinks he's entitled to Silver!"</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? There, there, honey&mdash;men don't cry when things go
  wrong&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;because they can take it out in cussing!" wailed the Kid." I
  wouldn't cry either, if you'd let me swear all I want to!"</p>

  <p>Chip turned his back precipitately and his shoulders were seen to shake.
  The Little Doctor looked shocked.</p>

  <p>"I want Silver for my string!" cried the Kid, artfully transferring his
  appeal to the higher court. "I can ride him&mdash;'cause I have rode him, in
  the pasture; and he never bucked once or kicked or anything. Doggone it, he
  likes to have me ride him! He comes a-runnin' up to me when I go down there,
  and I give him sugar. And then he waits till I climb on his back, and then we
  chase the other horses and play ride circle. He wants to be my string!"
  Something in the feel of his mother's arm around his shoulder whispered hope
  to the Kid. He looked up at her with his most endearing smile. "You come down
  there and I'll show you," he wheedled. "We're pals. And I guess YOU wouldn't
  like to have the boys call you Tom Thumb, a-ridin' Stubby. He's nothing but a
  five-cent sample of a horse. Big Medicine says so. I&mdash;I'd rather walk
  than ride Stubby. And I'm going on roundup. The boys said I could go when I
  get a real horse under me&mdash;and I want Silver. Daddy Chip said 'yes' I
  could have him. And now he's Injun-giver. Can't I have him, Doctor Dell?"</p>

  <p>The gray-blue eyes clashed with the brown. "It wouldn't hurt anything to
  let the poor little tad show us what he can do," said the gray-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;all right," yielded the brown, and their owner threw the iron
  bar upon the cooling forge and began to turn down his sleeves. "Why don't you
  make him wear a hat?" he asked reprovingly. "A little more and he won't pay
  any attention to anything you tell him. I'd carry out that sunbonnet bluff,
  anyway, if I were you."</p>

  <p>"Now, Daddy Chip! I 'splained to you how I lost my hat," reproached the
  Kid, clinging fast to the Little Doctor's hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and you 'splained that you'd have gone into that deep hole and
  drowned&mdash;with nobody there to pull you out&mdash;if you hadn't been
  scared of a water snake," Chip pointed out relentlessly.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't 'zactly scared," amended the Kid gravely. "He was havin' such a
  good time, and he was swimmin' around so&mdash;comf'table&mdash;and it wasn't
  polite to 'sturb him. Can't I have Silver?"</p>

  <p>"We'll go down and ask Silver what he thinks about it," said the Little
  Doctor, anxious to make peace between her two idols. "And we'll see if Daddy
  Chip can get the hat. You must wear a hat, honey; you know what mother told
  you&mdash;and you know mother keeps her word."</p>

  <p>"I wish dad did," the Kid commented, passing over the hat question. "He
  said I could have Silver, and keep him in a box stall and feed him my own
  self and water him my own self and nobody's to touch him but me."</p>

  <p>"Well, if daddy said all that&mdash;we'll have to think it over, and
  consult Silver and see what he has to say about it."</p>

  <p>Silver, when consulted, professed at least a willingness to own the Kid
  for his master. He did indeed come trotting up for sugar; and when he had
  eaten two grimy lumps from the Kid's grimier hand, he permitted the Kid to
  entice him up to a high rock, and stood there while the Kid clambered upon
  the rock and from there to his sleek back. He even waited until the Kid
  gathered a handful of silky mane and kicked him in the ribs; then he started
  off at a lope, while the Kid risked his balance to cast a triumphant
  grin&mdash;that had a gap in the middle&mdash;back at his astonished
  parents.</p>

  <p>"Look how the little devil guides him!" exclaimed Chip surrenderingly. "I
  guess he's safe enough; old Silver seems to sabe he's got a kid to take care
  of. He sure would strike a different gait with me! Lord how the time slides
  by; I can't seem to get it through me that the Kid's growing up."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor sighed a bit. And the Kid, circling grandly on the far
  side of the little pasture, came galloping back to hear the verdict. It
  pleased him&mdash;though he was inclined to mistake a great privilege for a
  right that must not be denied. He commanded his Daddy Chip to open the gate
  for him so he could ride Silver to the stable and put him in the box stall;
  which was a superfluous kindness, as Chip tried to point out and failed to
  make convincing.</p>

  <p>The Kid wanted Silver in the box stall, where he could feed him and water
  him his own self. So into the box stall Silver reluctantly went, and spent a
  greater part of the day with his head stuck out through the window, staring
  enviously at his mates in the pasture.</p>

  <p>For several days Chip watched the Kid covertly whenever his small feet
  strayed stableward; watched and was full of secret pride at the manner in
  which the Kid rose to his new responsibility. Never did a "string" receive
  the care which Silver got, and never did rider sit more proudly upon his
  steed than did the Kid sit upon Silver. There seemed to be practically no
  risk&mdash;Chip was amazed at the Kid's ability to ride. Besides, Silver was
  growing old&mdash;fourteen years being considered ripe old age in a horse. He
  was more given to taking life with a placid optimism that did not startle
  easily. He carried the Kid's light weight easily, and he had not lost all his
  springiness of muscle. The Little Doctor rode him sometimes, and loved his
  smooth gallop and his even temper; now she loved him more when she saw how
  careful he was of the Kid. She besought the Kid to be careful of Silver also,
  and was most manfully snubbed for her solicitude.</p>

  <p>The Kid had owned Silver for a week, and considered that he was qualified
  to give advice to the Happy Family, including his Daddy Chip, concerning the
  proper care of horses. He stood with his hands upon his hips and his feet far
  apart, and spat into the corral dust and told Big Medicine that nobody but a
  pilgrim ever handled a horse the way Big Medicine was handling Deuce. Whereat
  Big Medicine gave a bellowing haw-haw-haw and choked it suddenly when he saw
  that the Kid desired him to take the criticism seriously.</p>

  <p>"All right, Buck," he acceded humbly, winking openly at the Native Son.
  "I'll try m'best, old-timer. Trouble with me is, I never had nobody to learn
  me how to handle a hoss."</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got me, now," Buck returned calmly. "I don't ride <i>my</i> string
  without brushing the hay out of his tail. There's a big long hay stuck in
  your horse's tail." He pointed an accusing finger, and Big Medicine silently
  edged close to Deuce's rump and very carefully removed the big, long hay. He
  took a fine chance of getting himself kicked, but he did not tell the Kid
  that.</p>

  <p>"That all right now, Buck?" Big Medicine wanted to know, when he had
  accomplished the thing without accident.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it'll do," was the frugal praise he got. "I've got to go and feed my
  string, now. And after a while I'll water him. You want to feed your horse
  always before you water him, 'cause eatin' makes him thirsty. You 'member
  that, now."</p>

  <p>"I'll sure try to, Buck," Big Medicine promised soberly, and watched the
  Kid go striding away with his hat tilted at the approved Happy-Family angle
  and his small hands in his pockets. Big Medicine was thinking of his own kid,
  and wondering what he was like, and if he remembered his dad. He waved his
  hand in cordial farewell when the Kid looked back and wrinkled his nose in
  the adorable, Little-Doctor smile he had, and turned his attention to
  Deuce.</p>

  <p>The Kid made straight for the box stall and told Silver hello over the
  half door. Silver turned from gazing out of the window, and came forward
  expectantly, and the Kid told him to wait a minute and not be so impatient.
  Then he climbed upon a box, got down a heavy canvas nose-bag with leather
  bottom, and from a secret receptacle behind the oats box he brought a paper
  bag of sugar and poured about a teacupful into the bag. Daddy Chip had
  impressed upon him what would be the tragic consequences if he fed oats to
  Silver five times a day. Silver would die, and it would be the Kid that
  killed him. Daddy Chip had not said anything about sugar being fatal,
  however, and the Countess could not always stand guard over the sugar sack.
  So Silver had a sweet taste in his mouth twelve hours of the twenty-four, and
  was getting a habit of licking his lips reminiscently during the other
  twelve.</p>

  <p>The Kid had watched the boys adjust nose bags ever since he could toddle.
  He lugged it into the stall, set it artfully upon the floor and let Silver
  thrust in his head to the eyes: then he pulled the strap over Silver's neck
  and managed to buckle it very securely. He slapped the sleek neck afterward
  as his Daddy Chip did, hugged it the way Doctor Dell did, and stood back to
  watch Silver revel in the bag.</p>

  <p>"'S good lickums?" he asked gravely, because he had once heard his mother
  ask Silver that very question, in almost that very tone.</p>

  <p>At that moment an uproar outside caught his youthful attention. He
  listened a minute, heard Pink's voice and a shout of laughter, and ran to see
  what was going on; for where was excitement, there the Kid was also, as
  nearly in the middle of it as he could manage. His going would not have
  mattered to Silver, had he remembered to close the half-door of the stall
  behind him; even that would not have mattered, had he not left the outer door
  of the stable open also.</p>

  <p>The cause of the uproar does not greatly matter, except that the Kid
  became so rapturously engaged in watching the foolery of the Happy Family
  that he forgot all about Silver. And since sugar produces thirst, and Silver
  had not smelled water since morning, he licked the last sweet grain from the
  inside of the nose bag and then walked out of the stall and the stable and
  made for the creek&mdash;and a horse cannot drink with a nose bag fastened
  over his face. All he can do, if he succeeds in getting his nose into the
  water, is to drown himself most expeditiously and completely.</p>

  <p>Silver reached the creek unseen, sought the deepest hole and tried to
  drink. Since his nose was covered with the bag, he could not do so, but he
  fussed and splashed and thrust his head deeper until the water ran into the
  bag from the top. He backed and snorted and strangled, and in a minute he
  fell. Fortunately he struggled a little, and in doing so he slid backward
  down the bank so that his head was up the slope a and the water ran out of
  the bag, which was all that saved him.</p>

  <p>He was a dead horse, to all appearances at least, when Slim spied him and
  gave a yell to bring every human being on the ranch at a run. The Kid came
  with the rest, gave one scream and hid his face in the Little Doctor's
  skirts, and trembled so that his mother was more frightened for him than for
  the horse, and had Chip carry him to the house where he could not watch the
  first-aid efforts of the Happy Family.</p>

  <p>They did not say anything, much. By their united strength they pulled
  Silver up the bank so that his limp head hung downward. Then they began to
  work over him exactly as if he had been a drowned man, except that they did
  not, of course, roll him over a barrel. They moved his legs backward and
  forward, they kneaded his paunch, they blew into his nostrils, they felt
  anxiously for heart-beats. They sweated and gave up the fight, saying that it
  was no use. They saw a quiver of the muscles over the chest and redoubled
  their efforts, telling one another hopefully that he was alive, all right.
  They saw finally a quiver of the nostrils as well, and one after another they
  laid palms upon his heart, felt there a steady beating and proclaimed the
  fact profanely.</p>

  <p>They pulled him then into a more comfortable position where the sun shone
  warmly and stood around him in a crude circle and watched for more pronounced
  symptoms of recovery, and sent word to the Kid that his string was going to
  be all right in a little while.</p>

  <p>The information was lost upon the Kid, who wept too hysterically in his Daddy
  Chip's arms to listen to anything they told him. He had seen Silver stretched
  out dead, with his back in the edge of the creek and his feet sprawled at
  horrible angles, and the sight obsessed him and forbade comfort. He had
  killed his string; nothing was clear in his mind save that, and he screamed
  with his face hidden from his little world.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor, with anxious eyes and puckered eyebrows, poured
  something into a teaspoon and helped Chip fight to get it down the Kid's
  throat. And the Kid shrieked and struggled and strangled, as is the way of
  kids the world over, and tried to spit out the stuff and couldn't, so he
  screamed the louder and held his breath until he was purple, and his parents
  were scared stiff. The Old Man hobbled to the door in the midst of the uproar
  and asked them acrimoniously why they didn't make that doggoned Kid stop his
  howling; and when Chip, his nerves already strained to the snapping point,
  told him bluntly to get out and mind his own business, he hobbled away again
  muttering anathemas against the whole outfit.</p>

  <p>The Countess rushed in from out of doors and wanted to know what under the
  shinin' sun was the matter with that kid, and advised his frantic parents to
  throw water in his face. Chip told her exactly what he had told the Old Man,
  in exactly the same tone; so the Countess retreated, declaring that he
  wouldn't be let to act that way if he was her kid, and that he was plumb
  everlastingly spoiled.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family heard the disturbance and thought the Kid was being
  spanked for the accident, which put every man of them in a fighting humor
  toward Chip, the Little Doctor, the Old Man and the whole world. Pink even
  meditated going up to the White House to lick Chip&mdash;or at least tell him
  what he thought of him&mdash;and he had plenty of sympathizers; though they
  advised him half-heartedly not to buy in to any family mixup.</p>

  <p>It was into this storm centre that Andy Green rode headlong with his own
  burden of threatened disaster.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch4"
     id="ch4">IV. &mdash; ANDY TAKES A HAND IN THE GAME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andy Green was a day late in arriving at the Flying U. First
  he lost time by leaving the train thirty miles short of the destination
  marked on his ticket, and when he did resume his journey on the next train,
  he traveled eighty-four miles beyond Dry Lake, which landed him in Great
  Falls in the early morning. There, with the caution of a criminal carefully
  avoiding a meeting with Miss Hallman, he spent an hour in poring over a plat
  of a certain section of Chouteau County, and in copying certain description
  of unoccupied land.</p>

  <p>He had not slept very well the night before and he looked it. He had
  cogitated upon the subject of land speculations and the welfare of his outfit
  until his head was one great, dull ache; but he stuck to his determination to
  do something to block the game of the Homeseekers' Syndicate. Just what that
  something would be he had not yet decided. But on general principles it
  seemed wise to learn all he could concerning the particular tract of land
  about which Florence Grace Hallman had talked.</p>

  <p>The day was past when range rights might be defended honorably with rifles
  and six-shooters and iron nerved men to use them&mdash;and I fear that Andy
  Green sighed because it was so. Give him the "bunch" and free swing, and he
  thought the Homeseekers would lose their enthusiasm before even the first hot
  wind blew up from the southwest to wither their crops. But such measures were
  not to be thought of; if they fought at all they must fight with the law
  behind them&mdash;and even Andy's optimism did not see much hope from the
  law; none, in fact, since both the law and the moneyed powers were eager for
  the coming of homebuilders into that wide land. All up along the Marias they
  had built their board shacks, and back over the benches as far as one could
  see. There was nothing to stop them, and everything to make their coming
  easy.</p>

  <p>Andy scowled at the plat he was studying, and admitted to himself that it
  looked as though the Homeseekers Syndicate were going to have things their
  own way; unless&mdash;There he stuck. There must be some way out; never in
  his life had he faced a situation which had been absolutely hopeless; always
  there had been some chance to win, if a man only saw it in time and took it.
  In this case it was the clerk in the office who pointed the way with an idle
  remark.</p>

  <p>"Going to take up a claim, are you?"</p>

  <p>Andy looked up at him with the blank stare of preoccupation, and changed
  expression as the question filtered into his brain and fitted somehow into
  the puzzle. He grinned, said maybe he would, folded the sheet of paper filled
  with what looked like a meaningless jumble of letters and figures, bought a
  plat of that township and begged some government pamphlets, and went out
  humming a little tune just above a whisper. At the door he tilted his hat
  down at an angle over his right eye and took long, eager steps toward an
  obscure hotel and his meagre baggage.</p>

  <p>There was no train going east until midnight, and he caught that train.
  This time he actually got off at Dry Lake, ate a hurried breakfast, got his
  horse out of the livery stable and dug up the dust of the lane with rapid
  hoof-beats so that he rode all the way to the first hill followed by a
  rolling, gray cloud that never quite caught him.</p>

  <p>When he rode down the Hog's Back he saw the Happy Family bunched around
  some object on the creek-bank, and he heard the hysterical screaming of the
  Kid up in the house, and saw the Old Man limping excitedly up and down the
  porch. A man less astute than Andy Green would have known that some thing had
  happened. He hurried down the last slope, galloped along the creek-bottom,
  crossed the ford in a couple of leaps and pulled up beside the group that
  surrounded Silver.</p>

  <p>"What's been taking place here?" he demanded curiously, skipping the usual
  greetings.</p>

  <p>"Hell," said the Native Son succinctly, glancing up at him.</p>

  <p>"Old Silver looked over the fence into Kingdom Come," Weary enlarged the
  statement a little. "Tried to take a drink with a nose bag on. I guess he'll
  come through all right."</p>

  <p>"What ails the Kid?" Andy demanded, glancing toward the house whence
  issued a fresh outburst of shrieks.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family looked at one another and then at the White House.</p>

  <p>"Aw, some folks hain't got a lick of sense when it comes to kids," Big
  Medicine accused gruffly.</p>

  <p>"The Kid," Weary explained, "put the nose bag on Silver and then left the
  stable door open."</p>

  <p>"They ain't&mdash;spanking him for it, are they?" Andy demanded
  belligerently. "By gracious, how'd a kid know any better? Little bit of a tad
  like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Aw, they don't never spank the Kid!" Slim defended the parents loyally.
  "By golly, they's been times when I would-a spanked him, if it'd been me.
  Countess says it's plumb ridiculous the way that Kid runs over
  'em&mdash;rough shod. If he's gittin' spanked now, it's the first time."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andy, looking from one to another and reverting to his own
  worry as he swung down from his sweating horse, "there's something worse than
  a spanked kid going to happen to this outfit if you fellows don't get busy
  and do something. There's a swarm of dry-farmers coming in on us, with their
  stock to eat up the grass and their darned fences shutting off the
  water&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for the Lord's sake, cut it out!" snapped Pink. "We ain't in the mood
  for any of your joshes. We've had about enough excitement for once."</p>

  <p>"Ah, don't be a damn' fool," Andy snapped back. "There's no josh about it.
  I've got the whole scheme, just as they framed it up in Minneapolis. I got to
  talking with a she-agent on the train, and she gave the whole snap away;
  wanted me to go in with her and help land the suckers. I laid low, and made a
  sneak to the land office and got a plat of the land, and all the
  dope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get any mail?" Pink interrupted him, in the tone that took no notice
  whatever of Andy's ill news.</p>

  <p>"Time I was hearing from them spurs I sent for." Andy silently went
  through his pockets and produced what mail he had gleaned from the
  post-office, and led his horse into the shade of the stable and pulled off
  the saddle. Every movement betrayed the fact that he was in the grip of
  unpleasant emotions, but to the Happy Family he said not another word.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family did not notice his silence at the time. But afterwards,
  when the Kid had stopped crying and Silver had gotten to his feet and wobbled
  back to the stable, led by Chip, who explained briefly and satisfactorily the
  cause of the uproar at the house, and the boys had started up to their
  belated dinner, they began to realize that for a returned traveler Andy Green
  was not having much to say.</p>

  <p>They asked him about his trip, and received brief answers. Had he been
  anyone else they would have wanted to know immediately what was eatin' on
  him; but since it was Andy Green who sat frowning at his toes and smoking his
  cigarette as though it had no comfort or flavor, the boldest of them were
  cautious. For Andy Green, being a young man of vivid imagination and no
  conscience whatever, had fooled them too often with his lies. They waited,
  and they watched him covertly and a bit puzzled.</p>

  <p>Silence and gloom were not boon companions of Andy Green, at any time. So
  Weary, having the most charitable nature of any among them, sighed and
  yielded the point of silent contention.</p>

  <p>"What was all that you started to tell us about the dry-farmers, Andy?"
  he asked indulgently.</p>

  <p>"All straight goods. But there's no use talking to you bone-heads. You'll
  set around chewing the rag and looking wise till it's too late to do anything
  but holler your heads off." He got up from where he had been lounging on a
  bench just outside the mess house and walked away, with his hands thrust deep
  into his pockets and his shoulders drooped forward.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family looked after him doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Aw, it's just some darned josh uh his," Happy Jack declared. "I know
  HIM."</p>

  <p>"Look at the way he slouches along&mdash;like he was loaded to the ears
  with trouble!" Pink pointed out amusedly. "He'd fool anybody that didn't know
  him, all right."</p>

  <p>"And he fools the fellows that do know him, oftener than anybody else,"
  added the Native Son negligently. "You're fooled right now if you think
  that's all acting. That HOMBRE has got something on his mind."</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, it ain't dry-farmers," Slim asserted boldly.</p>

  <p>"If you fellows wouldn't say it was a frame-up between us two, I'd go
  after him and find out. But..."</p>

  <p>"But as it stands, we'd believe Andy Green a whole lot quicker'n what we
  would you," supplemented Big Medicine loudly. "You're dead right there."</p>

  <p>"What was it he said about it?" Weary wanted to know. "I wasn't paying
  much attention, with the Kid yelling his head off and old Silver gaping like
  a sick turkey, and all. What was it about them dry-farmers?"</p>

  <p>"He said," piped Pink, "that he'd got next to a scheme to bring a big
  bunch of dry-farmers in on this bench up here, with stock that they'd turn
  loose on the range. That's what he said. He claims the agent wanted him to go
  in on it."</p>

  <p>"Mamma!" Weary held a match poised midway between his thigh and his
  cigarette while he stared at Pink. "That would be some mixup&mdash;if it was
  to happen." His sunny blue eyes&mdash;that were getting little crow's-feet at
  their corners&mdash;turned to look after the departing Andy. "Where's the
  josh?" he questioned the group.</p>

  <p>"The josh is, that he'd like to see us all het up over it, and makin'
  war-talks and laying for the pilgrims some dark night with our six-guns, most
  likely," retorted Pink, who happened to be in a bad humor because in ten
  minutes he was due at a line of post-holes that divided the big pasture into
  two unequal parts. "He can't agitate me over anybody's troubles but my own.
  Happy, I'll help Bud stretch wire this afternoon if you'll tamp the rest uh
  them posts."</p>

  <p>"Aw, you stick to your own job! How was it when I wanted you to help pull
  the old wire off that hill fence and git it ready to string down here? You
  wasn't crazy about workin' with bob wire then, I noticed. You
  said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What I said wasn't a commencement to what I'll say again," Pink began
  truculently, and so the subject turned effectually from Andy Green.</p>

  <p>Weary smoked meditatively while they wrangled, and when the group broke up
  for the afternoon's work he went unobtrusively in search of Andy. He was not
  quite easy in his mind concerning the alleged joke. He had looked full at the
  possibilities of the situation&mdash;granting Andy had told the truth, as he
  sometimes did&mdash;and the possibilities had not pleased him. He found Andy
  morosely replacing some broken strands in his cinch, and he went straight at
  the mooted question.</p>

  <p>Andy looked up from his work and scowled. "This ain't any joke with me,"
  he stated grimly. "It's something that's going to put the Flying U out of
  business if it ain't stopped before it gets started. I've been worrying my
  head of[, ever since day before yesterday; I ain't in the humor to take
  anything off those imitation joshers up there&mdash;I'll tell yuh that
  much."</p>

  <p>"Well, but how do you figure it can be stopped?" Weary sat soberly down on
  the oats box and absently watched Andy's expert fingers while they knotted
  the heavy cotton cord through the cinch-ring. "We can't stand 'em off with
  guns."</p>

  <p>Andy dropped the cinch and stood up, pushing back his hat and then pulling
  it forward into place with the gesture he used when he was very much in
  earnest. "No, we can't. But if the bunch is game for it there's a way to
  block their play&mdash;and the law does all our fighting for us. We don't
  have to yeep. It's like this, Weary&mdash;counting Chip and the Little Doctor and
  the Countess there's eleven of us that can use our rights up here on the
  bench. I've got it all figured out. If we can get Irish and Jack Bates to
  come back and help us out, there's thirteen of us. And we can take homesteads
  along the creeks and deserts back on the bench, and&mdash;say, do you know
  how much land we can corral, the bunch of us? Four thousand acres and if we
  take our claims right, that's going to mean that we get a dead immortal cinch
  on all the bench land that's worth locating, around here, and we'll have the
  creeks, and also we'll have the breaks corralled for our own stock.</p>

  <p>"I've gone over the plat&mdash;I brought a copy to show you fellows what
  we can do. And by taking up our claims right, we keep a deadline from the
  Bear Paws to the Flying U. Now the Old Man owns Denson's ranch, all south uh
  here is fairly safe&mdash;unless they come in between his south line and the
  breaks; and there ain't room for more than two or three claims there. Maybe
  we can get some of the boys to grab what there is, and string ourselves out
  north uh here too.</p>

  <p>"That's the only way on earth we can save what little feed there is left.
  This way, we get the land ourselves and hold it, so there don't any outside
  stock come in on us. If Florence Grace Hallman and her bunch lands any
  settlers here, they'll be between us and Dry Lake; and they're dead welcome
  to squat on them dry pinnacles&mdash;so long as we keep their stock from
  crossing our claims to get into the breaks. Savvy the burro?"</p>

  <p>"Yes-s&mdash;but how'd yuh KNOW they're going to do all this? Mamma! I
  don't want to turn dry-farmer if I don't have to!"</p>

  <p>Andy's face clouded. "That's just what'll block the game, I'm afraid. I
  don't want to, either. None of the boys'll want to. It'll mean going up there
  and baching, six or seven months of the year, by our high lonesomes. We'll
  have to fulfill the requirements, if we start in&mdash;because them
  pilgrims'll be standing around like dogs at a picnic, waiting for something
  to drop so they can grab it and run. It ain't going to be any snap.</p>

  <p>"And there's another thing bothers me, Weary. It's going to be one peach
  of a job to make the boys believe it hard enough to make their entries in
  time." Andy grinned wrily. "By gracious, this is where I could see a
  gilt-edged reputation for telling the truth!"</p>

  <p>"You could, all right," Weary agreed sympathetically. "It's going to
  strain our swallowers to get all that down, and that's a fact. You ought to
  have some proof, if you want the boys to grab it, Andy." His face sobered.
  "Who is this Florence person? If you could get some kinda proof&mdash;a
  letter, say..."</p>

  <p>"Easiest thing in the world!" Andy brightened at the suggestion. "She's
  stopping at the Park, in Great Falls, and she wanted me to come up or write.
  Anybody going to town right away? I'll send that foxy dame a letter that'll
  produce proof enough. You've helped me a lot, Weary."</p>

  <p>Weary scrutinized him sharply and puckered his lips into a doubtful
  expression. "I wish I knew for a fact whether all this is straight goods,
  Andy," he "said pensively. "Chances are you're just stringing me. But if you
  are, old boy, I'm going to take it outa your hide&mdash;and don't you forget
  that." He grinned at his own mental predicament. "Honest, Andy, is this some
  josh, or do you mean it?"</p>

  <p>"By gracious, I wish it was a josh! But it ain't, darn it. In about two
  weeks or so you'll all see the point of this joke&mdash;but whether the
  joke's on us or on the Homeseekers Syndicate depends on you fellows. Lord! I
  wish I'd never told a lie!"</p>

  <p>Weary sat knocking his heels rhythmically against the side of the box
  while he thought the matter over from start to hypothetical finish and back
  again. Meanwhile Andy Green went on with his work and scowled over his
  well-earned reputation that hampered him now just when he needed the
  confidence of his fellows in order to save their beloved Flying U from slow
  annihilation. Perhaps his mental suffering could not rightly be called
  remorse, but a poignant regret it most certainly was, and a sense of complete
  bafflement which came out in his next sentence.</p>

  <p>"Even if she wrote me a letter, the boys'd call it a frame-up just the
  same. They'd say I had it fixed before I left town. Doctor Cecil's up at the
  Falls. They'd lay it to her."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of that, myself. What's the matter with getting Chip to go
  up with you? Couldn't you ring him in on the agent somehow, so he can get the
  straight of it?"</p>

  <p>Andy stood up and looked at Weary a minute. "How'd I make Chip believe me
  enough to GO?" he countered. "Darn it, everything looked all smooth sailing
  till I got back here to the ranch and the boys come at me with that same old
  smart-aleck brand uh talk. I kinda forgot how I've lied to 'em and fooled
  'em right along till they duck every time I open my face." His eyes were too
  full of trouble to encourage levity in his listener. "You remember that time
  the boys' rode off and left me laying out here on the prairie with my leg
  broke?" he went on dismally. "I'd rather have that happen to me a dozen times
  than see 'em set back and give me the laugh now, just when&mdash;Oh, hell!"
  He dropped the finished cinch and walked moodily to the door. "Weary, if them
  dry-farmers come flockin' in on us while this bunch stands around callin' me
  a liar, I&mdash;" He did not attempt to finish the sentence; but Weary,
  staring curiously at Andy's profile, saw a quivering of the muscles around
  his lips and felt a responsive thrill of sympathy and belief that rose above
  his long training in caution.</p>

  <p>In spite of past experience he believed, at that moment, every word which
  Andy Green had uttered upon the subject of the proposed immigration. He was
  about to tell Andy so, when Chip walked unexpectedly out of Silver's stall
  and glanced from Weary to Andy standing still in the doorway. Weary looked at
  him enquiringly; for Chip must have heard every word they said, and if Chip
  believed it&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Have you got that plat with you, Andy?" Chip asked tersely and with never
  a doubt in his tone.</p>

  <p>Andy swung toward him like a prisoner who has just heard a jury return a
  verdict of not guilty to the judge. "I've got it, yes," he answered simply,
  with only his voice betraying the emotions he felt&mdash;and his eye. "Want
  it?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take a look at it, if it's handy," said Chip.</p>

  <p>Andy felt in his inside coat pocket, drew out a thin, folded map of that
  particular part of the county with all the government land marked upon it,
  and handed it to Chip without a word. He singled out a couple of pamphlets
  from a bunch of old letters such as men are in the habit of carrying upon
  their persons, and gave them to Chip also.</p>

  <p>"That's a copy of the homestead and desert laws," he said. "I guess you
  heard me telling Weary what kinda deal we're up against, here. Better not say
  anything to the Old Man till you have to; no use worrying him&mdash;he can't
  do nothing." It was amazing, the change that had come over Andy's face and
  manner since Chip first spoke. Now he grinned a little.</p>

  <p>"If you want to go in on this deal," he said quizzically, "maybe it'll be
  just as well if you talk to the bunch yourself about it, Chip. You ain't any
  tin angel, but I'm willing to admit the boys'll believe you, a whole lot
  quicker than they would me."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and they'll probably hand me a bunch of pity for getting stung
  by you," Chip retorted. "I'll take a chance, anyway&mdash;but the Lord help
  you, Andy if you can't produce proof when the time comes."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch5"
     id="ch5">V. &mdash; THE HAPPY FAMILY TURN NESTERS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Say, Andy, where's them dry-farmers?" Big Medicine inquired
  at the top of his voice when the Happy Family had reached the
  biscuit-and-syrup stage of supper that evening.</p>

  <p>"Oh, they're trying to make up their minds whether to bring the old
  fannin'-mill along or sell it and buy new when they get here," Andy informed
  him imperturbably. "The women-folks are busy going through their rag bags,
  cutting the buttons off all the pants that ain't worth patching no more, and
  getting father's socks all darned up."</p>

  <p>The Happy Family snickered appreciatively; this was more like the Andy
  Green with whom they were accustomed to deal.</p>

  <p>"What's daughter doin', about now?" asked Cal Emmett, fixing his round,
  baby-blue stare upon Andy.</p>

  <p>"Daughter? Why, daughter's leaning over the gate telling him she wouldn't
  never LOOK at one of them wild cowboys&mdash;the idea! She's heard all about
  'em, and they're too rough and rude for HER. And she's promising to write
  every day, and giving him a lock of hair to keep in the back of his dollar
  watch. Pass the cane juice, somebody."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;all right for daughter. If she's a good looker we'll see if
  she don't change her verdict about cowboys."</p>

  <p>"Who will? You don't call yourself one, do yuh?" Pink flung at him
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends; I know I ain't any LADY broncho&mdash;hey, cut it
  out!" This last because of half a biscuit aimed accurately at the middle of
  his face. If you want to know why, search out the history of a certain War
  Bonnet Roundup, wherein Pink rashly impersonated a lady broncho-fighter.</p>

  <p>"Where are they going to live when they git here?" asked Happy Jack,
  reverting to the subject of dry farmers.</p>

  <p>"Close enough so you can holler from here to their back door, my
  boy&mdash;if they have their say about it," Andy assured him cheerfully. Andy
  felt that he could afford to be facetious now that he had Chip and Weary on
  his side.</p>

  <p>"Aw, gwan! I betche there ain't a word of truth in all that scarey talk,"
  Happy Jack fleered heavily.</p>

  <p>"Name your bet. I'll take it." Andy filled his mouth with hot biscuit and
  stirred up the sugar in his coffee like a man who is occupied chiefly with
  the joys of the table.</p>

  <p>"Aw, you ain't going to git me that way agin," Happy Jack declared.
  "They's some ketch to it."</p>

  <p>"There sure is, Happy. The biggest ketch you ever seen in your life. It's
  ketch the Flying U outfit and squeeze the life out of it; that's the ketch."
  Andy's tone had in it no banter, but considerable earnestness. For, though
  Chip would no doubt convince the boys that the danger was very real, there
  was a small matter of personal pride to urge Andy into trying to convince
  them himself, without aid from Chip or any one else.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, I'd like to see anybody try that there scheme," blurted
  Slim. "That's all&mdash;I'd just like to see 'em TRY it once!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll see it, all right&mdash;and you won't have to wait long,
  either. Just set around on your haunches a couple of weeks or so. That's all
  you'll have to do, Slim; you'll see it tried, fast enough."</p>

  <p>Pink eyed him with a wide, purple glance. "You'd like to make us fall for
  that, wouldn't you?" he challenged warily.</p>

  <p>Andy gave him a level look. "No, I wouldn't. I'd like to put one over on
  you smart gazabos that think you know it all; but I don't want to bad enough
  to see the Flying U go outa business just so I could holler
  didn't-I-tell-you. There's a limit to what I'll pay for a josh."</p>

  <p>"Well," put in the Native Son with his easy drawl, "I'm coming to the
  centre with my ante, just for the sake of seeing the cards turned. Deal 'em
  out, amigo; state your case once more, so we can take a good, square look at
  these dry-farmers."</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;go ahead and tell us what's bustin' the buttons off your
  vest," Cal Emmett invited.</p>

  <p>"What's the use?" Andy argued. "You'd all just raise up on your hind legs
  and holler your heads off. You wouldn't DO anything about it&mdash;not if you
  knew it was the truth!" This, of course, was pure guile upon his part.</p>

  <p>"Oh, wouldn't we? I guess, by golly, we'd do as much for the outfit as
  what you would&mdash;and a hull lot more if it come to a show-down." Slim
  swallowed the bait.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you would, if you could take it out in talking," snorted Andy. "My
  chips are in. I've got three-hundred-and-twenty acres picked out, up here,
  and I'm going to file on 'em before these damned nesters get off the train.
  Uh course, that won't be more'n a flea bite&mdash;but I can make it
  interesting for my next door neighbors, anyway; and every flea bite helps to
  keep a dog moving, yuh know."</p>

  <p>"I'll go along and use my rights," Weary offered suddenly and seriously.
  "That'll make one section they won't get, anyway."</p>

  <p>Pink gave him a startled look across the table. "You ain't going to grab
  it, are yuh?" he demanded disappointedly.</p>

  <p>"I sure am&mdash;if it's three-hundred-and-twenty acres of land you mean.
  If I don't, somebody else will." He sighed humorously. "Next summer you'll
  see me hoeing spuds, most likely&mdash;if the law says I GOT to."</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw-w!" laughed Big Medicine suddenly. "It'd sure be worth the
  price, jest to ride up and watch you two marks down on all fours weedin'
  onions." He laughed again with his big, bull-like bellow.</p>

  <p>"We don't have to do anything like that if we don't want to," put in Andy
  Green calmly. "I've been reading up on the law. There's one little joker in
  it I've got by heart. It says that homestead land can be used for grazing
  purposes if it's more valuable for pasture than for crops, and that actual
  grazing will be accepted instead of cultivation&mdash;if it is grazing land.
  So&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I betche you can't prove that," Happy Jack interrupted him. "I never
  heard of that before&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The world's plumb full of things you never heard of, Happy," Andy told
  him witheringly. "I gave Chip my copy of the homestead laws, and a plat of
  the land up here; soon as he hands 'em back I can show you in cold print
  where it says that very identical thing.</p>

  <p>"That's what makes it look good to me, just on general principles," he
  went on, his honest, gray eyes taking in the circle of attentive faces. "If
  the bunch of us could pool our interests and use what rights we got, we can
  corral about four thousand acres&mdash;and we can head off outsiders from
  grazing in the Badlands, if we take our land right. We've been overlooking a
  bet, and don't you forget it. We've been fooling around, just putting in our
  time and drawing wages, when we could be owning our own grazing land by now
  and shipping our own cattle, if we had enough sense to last us overnight.</p>

  <p>"A-course, I ain't crazy about turning nester, myself&mdash;but we've let
  things slide till we've got to come through or get outa the game. It's a
  fact, boys, about them dry-farmers coming in on us. That Minneapolis bunch
  that the blonde lady works for is sending out a colony of farmers to take up
  this land between here and the Bear Paws. The lady tipped her hand, not
  knowing where I ranged and thinking I wouldn't be interested in anything but
  her. She's a real nice lady, too, and goodlooking&mdash;but a grafter to her
  last eye winker. And she hit too close to home to suit me, when she named the
  place where they're going to dump their colony."</p>

  <p>"Where does the graft come in?" inquired Pink cautiously. "The farmers get
  the land, don't they?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, they get the land. And they pungle up a good-sized fee to Florence
  Grace Hallman and her outfit, for locating 'em. Also there's side money in
  it, near as I can find out. They skin the farmers somehow on the fare out
  here. That's their business, according to the lady. They prowl around through
  the government plats till they spot a few thousand acres of land in a chunk;
  they take a look at it, maybe, and then they boom it like hell, and get them
  eastern marks hooked&mdash;them with money, the lady said. Then they ship a
  bunch out here, locate 'em on the land and leave it up to THEM, whether they
  scratch a living or not. She said they urge the rubes to bring all the stock
  they can, because there's plenty of range left. She says they play that up
  big. You can see for yourself how that'll work out, around here!"</p>

  <p>Pink eyed him attentively, and suddenly his dimples stood deep. "All
  right, I'm in," he surrendered.</p>

  <p>"It'd be a sin not to fall for a yarn like that, Andy. I expect you made
  it all up outa your own head, but that's all right. It's a pleasure to be
  fooled by a genius like you. I'll go raising turnips and cabbages
  myself."</p>

  <p>"By golly, you couldn't raise nothing but hell up on that dry bench," Slim
  observed ponderously. "There ain't any water. What's the use uh talking
  foolish?"</p>

  <p>"They're going to tackle it, just the same," Andy pointed out
  patiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, if you ain't just lyin' to hear yourself, that there
  graftin' bunch had oughta be strung up!"</p>

  <p>"Sure, they had. Nobody's going to argue about that. But seeing we can't
  do that, the next best thing is to beat them to it. If they came out here
  with their herd of pilgrims and found the land all took up&mdash;" Andy
  smiled hypnotically upon the goggling group.</p>

  <p>"Haw-haw-haw-w!" bawled Big Medicine. "It'd be wuth it, by cripes!"</p>

  <p>"Yeah&mdash;it would, all right. If that talk Andy's been giving us is
  straight, about grazing the land instead uh working it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can mighty quick find out," Andy retorted. "Go up and ask Chip for
  them land laws, and that plat. And ask him what he thinks about the deal. You
  don't have to take my word for it." Andy grinned virtuously and pushed back
  his chair. From their faces, and the remarks they had made, he felt very
  confident of the ultimate decision. "What about you, Patsy?" he asked
  suddenly, turning to the bulky, bald German cook who was thumping bread dough
  in a far corner. "You got any homestead or desert rights you ain't used?"</p>

  <p>"Py cosh, I got all der rights dere iss," Patsy returned querulously. "I
  got more rights as you shmartys. I got soldier's rights mit fightin'. Und py
  cosh, I use him too if dem fellers coom by us mit der dry farms
  alreatty!"</p>

  <p>"Well, you son-of-a-gun!" Andy smote him elatedly upon a fat shoulder.
  "What do you know about old Patsy for a dead game sport? By gracious, that
  makes another three hundred and twenty to the good. Gee, it's lucky this
  bunch has gone along turning up their noses at nesters and thinkin' they
  couldn't be real punchers and hold down claims too. If any of us had had
  sense enough to grab a piece of land and settle down to raise families, we'd
  be right up against it now. We'd have to set back and watch a bunch of
  down-east rubes light down on us like flies on spilt molasses, and we
  couldn't do a thing."</p>

  <p>"As it is, we'll all turn nesters for the good of the cause!" finished
  Pink somewhat cynically, getting up and following Cal and Slim to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Aw, I betche they's some ketch to it!" gloomed Happy Jack. "I betche Andy
  jest wants to see us takin' up claims on that dry bench, and then set back
  and laugh at us fer bitin' on his josh."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'll have the claims, won't you. And if you hang onto them
  there'll be money in the deal some day. Why, darn your bomb-proof skull,
  can't you get it into your system that all this country's bound to settle
  up?" Andy's eyes snapped angrily. "Can't you see the difference between us
  owning the land between here and the mountains, and a bunch of outsiders
  that'll cut it all up into little fields and try to farm it. If you can't see
  that, you better go hack a hole in your head with an axe, so an idea can
  squeeze in now and then when you ain't looking!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I betche there ain't no colony comin' to settle that there bench,"
  Happy Jack persisted stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Yes there is, by cripes!" trumpeted Big Medicine behind him. "Yes there
  is! And that there colony is goin' to be us, and don't you forget it. It's
  time I was doin' somethin' fer that there boy uh mine, by cripes! And soon as
  we git that fence strung I'm goin' to hit the trail fer the nearest land
  office. Honest to grandma, if Andy's lyin' it's goin' to be the prof't'blest
  lie HE ever told, er anybody else. I don't care a cuss about whether them
  dry-farmers is fixin' to light here or not. That there land-pool looks good
  to ME, and I'm comin' in on it with all four feet!"</p>

  <p>Big Medicine was nothing less than a human land slide when once he threw
  himself into anything, be it a fight or a frolic. Now he blocked the way to
  the door with his broad shoulders and his big bellow and his enthusiasm, and
  his pale, frog-like eyes fixed their protruding stare accusingly upon the
  reluctant ones.</p>

  <p>"Cal, you git up there and git that plat and bring it here," he ordered.
  "And fer criminy sakes git that table cleared off, Patsy, so's't we kin have
  a place to lay it! What's eatin' on you fellers, standin' around like girls
  to a party, waitin' fer somebody to come up and ast you to dance! Ain't you
  got head enough to see what a cinch we got, if we only got sense enough to
  play it! Honest to grandma you make me sick to look at yuh! Down in Coconino
  County the boys wouldn't stand back and wait to be purty-pleased into a thing
  like this. You're so scared Andy's got a josh covered up somewheres, you
  wouldn't take a drink uh whisky if he ast yuh up to the bar! You'd pass up a
  Chris'mas turkey, by cripes, if yuh seen Andy washin' his face and lookin'
  hungry! You'd&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What further reproach he would have heaped upon them was interrupted by
  Chip, who opened the door just then and bumped Big Medicine in the back. In
  his hand Chip carried the land plat and the pamphlets, and in his keen, brown
  eyes he carried the light of battle for his outfit. The eyes of Andy Green
  sent bright glances from him to Big Medicine, and on to the others. He was
  too wise then to twit those others with their unbelief. His wisdom went
  farther than that; for he remained very much in the background of the
  conversation and contented himself with answering, briefly and truthfully,
  the questions they put to him about Florence Grace Hallman and the things she
  had so foolishly divulged concerning her plans.</p>

  <p>Chip spread the plat upon an end of the table hastily and effectually
  cleared by a sweep of Big Medicine's arm, and the Happy Family crowded close
  to stare down at the checker-board picture of their own familiar bench land.
  They did not doubt, now&mdash;nor did they hang back reluctantly. Instead
  they followed eagerly the trail Chip's cigarette-yellowed finger took across
  the map, and they listened intently to what he said about that trail.</p>

  <p>The clause about grazing the land, he said, simplified matters a whole
  lot. It was a cinch you couldn't turn loose and dry-farm that land and have
  even a fair chance of reaping a harvest. But as grazing land they could hold
  all the land along One Man Creek&mdash;and that was a lot. And the land lying
  back of that, and higher up toward the foothills, they could take as desert.
  And he maintained that Andy had been right in his judgment. If they all went
  into it and pulled together they could stretch a line of claims that would
  protect the Badland grazing effectually.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't ask you fellows to go into this," said Chip, straightening
  from his stooping over the map and looking from one sober face to another,
  "just to help the outfit. But it'll be a good thing for you boys. It'll give
  you a foothold&mdash;something better than wages, if you stay with your
  claims and prove up. Of course, I can't say anything about us buying out your
  claims&mdash;that's fraud, according to Hoyle; but you ain't
  simple-minded&mdash;you know your land won't be begging for a buyer, in case
  you should ever want to sell.</p>

  <p>"There's another thing. This will not only head off the dry-farmers from
  overstocking what little range is left&mdash;it'll make a dead-line for
  sheep, too. We've been letting 'em graze back and forth on the bench back
  here beyond our leased land, and not saying much, so long as they didn't
  crowd up too close, and kept going. With all our claims under fence, do you
  realize what that'll mean for the grass?"</p>

  <p>"Josephine! There's feed for considerable stock, right over there on our
  claims, to say nothing of what we'll cover," exclaimed Pink.</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man! And if we get water on the desert claims&mdash;" Chip
  grinned down at him. "See what we've been passing up, all this time. We've
  had some of it leased, of course&mdash;but that can't be done again. There's
  been some wire-pulling, and because we ain't politicians we got turned down
  when the Old Man wanted to renew the lease. I can see now why it was, maybe.
  This dry-farm business had something to do with it, if you ask me."</p>

  <p>"Gee whiz! And here we've been calling Andy a liar," sighed Cal
  Emmett.</p>

  <p>"Aw, jest because he happened to tell the truth once, don't cut no ice,"
  Happy Jack maintained with sufficient ambiguity to avert the natural
  consequences.</p>

  <p>"Of course, it won't be any gold-mine," Chip added dispassionately. "But
  it's worth picking up, all right; and if it'll keep out a bunch of
  tight-fisted settlers that don't give a darn for anything but what's inside
  their own fence, that's worth a lot, too."</p>

  <p>"Say, my dad's a farmer," Pink declared defiantly in his soft treble." And
  while I think of it, them eastern farmers ain't so worse&mdash;not the brand
  I've seen, anyway. They're narrow, maybe&mdash;but they're human. Damn it,
  you fellows have got to quit talking about 'em as if they were blackleg stock
  or grasshoppers or something."</p>

  <p>"We ain't saying nothing aginst farmers <i>as</i> farmers, Little One," Big
  Medicine explained forbearingly. "As men, and as women, and as kids, they're
  mighty nice folks. My folks have got an eighty-acre farm in Wisconsin," he
  confessed unexpectedly, "and I think a pile of 'em. But if they was to come
  out here, trying to horn in on our range, I'd lead 'em gently to the
  railroad, by cripes, and tell 'em goodbye so's't they'd know I meant it!
  Can't yuh see the difference?" he bawled, goggling at Pink with misleading
  savageness in his ugly face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I see," Pink admitted mildly. "I only just wanted to remind you
  fellows that I don't mean anything personal and I don't want you to. Say,
  what about One Man Coulee?" he asked suddenly. "That's marked vacant on the
  map. I always thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sure, you did!" Chip grinned at him wisely, "because we used it for a
  line camp, you thought we owned a deed to it. Well, we don't. We had that
  land leased, is all."</p>

  <p>"Say, by golly, I'll file on that, then," Slim declared selfishly. For One
  Man Coulee, although a place of gruesome history, was also desirable for one
  or two reasons. There was wood, for instance, and water, and a cabin that was
  habitable. There was also a fence on the place, a corral and a small stable.
  "If Happy's ghost don't git to playin' music too much," he added with his
  heavy-handed wit.</p>

  <p>"No, sir! You ain't going to have One Man coulee unless Andy, here, says
  he don't want it!" shouted Big Medicine. "I leave it to Chip if Andy hadn't
  oughta have first pick. He's the feller that's put us onto this, by cripes,
  and he's the feller that's going to pick his claim first."</p>

  <p>Chip did not need to sanction that assertion. The whole Happy Family
  agreed unanimously that it should be so, except Slim, who yielded a bit
  unwillingly.</p>

  <p>Till midnight and after, they bent heads over the plat and made plans for
  the future and took no thought whatever of the difficulties that might lie
  before them. For the coming colony they had no pity, and for the balked
  schemes of the Homeseekers' Syndicate no compunctions whatever.</p>

  <p>So Andy Green, having seen his stratagem well on the way to success, and
  feeling once more the well-earned confidence of his fellows, slept soundly
  that night in his own bed, serenely sure of the future.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch6"
     id="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE FIRST BLOW IN THE FIGHT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Letters went speeding to Irish and Jack Bates, absent
  members of the Happy Family of the Flying U; letters that explained the
  situation with profane completeness, set forth briefly the plan of the
  proposed pool, and which importuned them to come home or make haste to the
  nearest land-office and file upon certain quarter-sections therein minutely
  described. Those men who would be easiest believed wrote and signed the
  letters, and certain others added characteristic postscripts best calculated
  to bring results.</p>

  <p>After that, the Happy Family debated upon the boldness of going in a body
  to Great Falls to file upon their claims, or the caution of proceeding
  instead to Glasgow where the next nearest land-office might be found. Slim
  and Happy Jack favored caution and Glasgow. The others sneered at their
  timidity, as they were wont to do.</p>

  <p>"Yuh think Florence Grace Hallman is going to stand guard with a six-gun?"
  Andy challenged at last." She's tied up till her colony gets there. She can't
  file on all that land herself, can she?" He smiled reminiscently. "The lady
  asked me to come up to the Falls and see her," he said softly. "I'm going.
  The rest of you can take the same train, I reckon&mdash;she won't stop you
  from it, and I won't. And who's to stop you from filing? The land's there,
  open for settlement. At least it was open, day before yesterday.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, the sooner we go the better," Slim declared fussily.
  "That fencin' kin wait. We gotta go and git back before Chip wants to start
  out the wagons, too."</p>

  <p>"Listen here, hombres," called the Native Son from the window, where he
  had been studying the well-thumbed pamphlet containing the homestead law. "If
  we want to play dead safe on this, we all better quit the outfit before we
  go. Call for our time. I don't like the way some of this stuff reads."</p>

  <p>"I don't like the way none of it reads," grumbled Happy Jack. "I betche we
  can't make it go; they's some ketch to it. We'll never git a patent. I'll
  betche anything yuh like."</p>

  <p>"Well, pull out of the game, then!" snapped Andy Green, whose nerves were
  beginning to feel the strain put upon them.</p>

  <p>"I ain't in it yet," said Happy Jack sourly, and banged the door shut upon
  his departure.</p>

  <p>Andy scowled and returned to studying the map. Finally he reached for his
  hat and gloves in the manner of one who has definitely made up his mind to
  some thing.</p>

  <p>"Well, the rest of you can do as you darned please," he delivered his
  ultimatum from the doorway. "I'm going to catch up my horse, draw a month's
  wages and hit the trail. I can catch the evening train to the Falls, easy,
  and be ready to file on my chunk first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>"Ain't in any rush, are yuh?" Pink inquired facetiously. "If I had my
  dinner settled and this cigarette smoked, I might go along&mdash;provided you
  don't take the trail with yuh."</p>

  <p>"Hold on, boys, and listen to this," the Native Son called out
  imperatively. "I think we better get a move on, too; but we want to get a
  fair running start, and not fall over this hump. Listen here! We've got to
  swear that it is not for the benefit of any other person, persons or
  corporation, and so on; and farther along it says we must not act in
  collusion with any person, persons or corporation, to give them the benefit
  of the land. There's more of the same kind, too, but you see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, who's acting in collusion? What's collusion mean anyhow?" Slim
  demanded aggressively.</p>

  <p>"It means what we're aiming to do&mdash;if anybody could prove it on us,"
  explained the Native Son. "My oldest brother's a lawyer, and I caught some of
  it from him. And my expert, legal advice is this: to get into a row with the
  Old Man, maybe&mdash;anyway, quit him cold, so we get our time. We must let
  that fact percolate the alleged brains of Dry Lake and vicinity&mdash;and if
  we give any reason for taking claims right under the nose of the Flying U,
  why, we're doing it to spite the Old Man. Sabe? Otherwise we're going to have
  trouble&mdash;unless that colony scheme is just a pipe dream of Andy's."</p>

  <p>The Happy Family had learned to respect the opinions of the Native Son,
  whose mixture of Irish blood with good Castilian may have had something to do
  with his astuteness. Once, as you may have heard, the Native Son even scored
  in a battle of wits with Andy Green, and scored heavily. And he had helped
  Andy pull the Flying U out of an extremely ticklish situation, by his keen
  wit saving the outfit much trouble and money. Wherefore they heeded now his
  warning to the extent of unsmilingly discussing the obstacle he had pointed
  out to them. One after another they read the paragraph which they had before
  passed over too hastily, and sensed the possibilities of its construction.
  Afterward they went into serious consultation as to ways and means, calling
  Happy Jack back so that he might understand thoroughly what must be done. For
  the Happy Family was nothing if not thorough, and their partisanship that had
  been growing insensibly stronger through the years was roused as it had not
  been since Dunk Whittaker drove sheep in upon the Flying U.</p>

  <p>The Old Man, having eaten a slice of roast pork the size of his two hands,
  in defiance of his sister's professional prohibition of the indulgence, was
  sitting on the sunny side of the porch trying to ignore the first uneasy
  symptoms of indigestion. The Little Doctor had taken his pipe away from him
  that morning, and had badgered him into taking a certain decoction whose
  taste lingered bitterly. The paper he was reading was four days old and he
  disagreed with its political policy, and there was no telling when anyone
  would have time to go in after the mail and his favorite paper. Ranch work
  was growing heavier each year in proportion to the lightening of range work.
  He was going to sow another twenty acres of alfalfa, and to do that he must
  cut down the size of his pasture&mdash;something that always went against the
  grain. He had not been able to renew his lease of government
  land,&mdash;which also went against the grain. And the Kid, like the last
  affliction which the Lord sent unto Job&mdash;I've forgotten whether that was
  boils or the butchery of his offspring&mdash;came loping down the length of
  the porch and kicked the Old Man's bunion with a stubby boot-toe.</p>

  <p>Thus was born the psychological moment when the treachery of the Happy
  Family would cut deepest.</p>

  <p>They came, bunched and talking low-voiced together with hatbrims hiding
  shamed eyes, a type-true group of workers bearing a grievance. Not a man was
  absent&mdash;the Happy Family saw to that! Even Patsy, big and sloppy and
  bearing with him stale kitchen odors, limped stolidly in the rear beside
  Slim, who looked guilty as though he had been strangling somebody's favorite
  cat.</p>

  <p>The Old Man, bent head-foremost over his growing paunch that he might
  caress his outraged bunion, glared at them with belligerent curiosity from
  under his graying eyebrows. The group came on and stopped short at the
  steps&mdash;and I don't suppose the Happy Family will ever look such sneaks
  again whatever crime they may commit. The Old Man straightened with a grunt
  of pain because of his lame back, and waited. Which made it all the harder
  for the Happy Family, especially for Andy Green who had been chosen
  spokesman&mdash;for his sins perhaps.</p>

  <p>"We'd like our time," blurted Andy after an unpleasant silence, and fixed
  his eyes frigidly upon the lowest rung of the Old Man's chair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you would, hunh? The whole bunch of yuh?" The Old Man eyed them
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the whole bunch of us. We're going to quit."</p>

  <p>The Old Man's jaw dropped a little, but his eyes didn't waver from their
  Hangdog faces. "Well, I never coaxed a man to stay yet," he stated grimly,
  "and I'm gittin' too old in the business to start coaxin' now. Dell!" He
  turned stiffly in his chair so that he faced the open door. "Bring me my time
  and check books outa the desk!"</p>

  <p>A gray hardness came slowly to the Old Man's face while he waited, his
  seamed hands gripping the padded arms of his chair. A tightness pulled at his
  lips behind the grizzled whiskers. It never occurred to him now that the
  Happy Family might be perpetrating one of their jokes. He had looked at their
  faces, you see. They meant to quit him&mdash;quit him cold just as spring
  work was beginning. They were ashamed of themselves, of course; they had a
  right to be ashamed, he thought bitterly. It hurt&mdash;hurt so that he would
  have died before he would ask for excuse, reason, grievance,
  explanation&mdash;for whatever motive impelled them. So he waited, and he
  gripped the arms of his chair, and he clamped his mouth shut and did not
  speak a word.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family had expected him to swear at them stormily; to accuse
  them of vile things; to call them such names as his memory could seize upon
  or his ingenuity invent. They had been careful to prepare a list of plausible
  reasons for leaving then. They had first invented a gold rumor that they
  hoped would sound convincing, but Andy had insisted upon telling him
  straightforwardly that they did not favor fence-building and ditch-digging
  and such back-breaking toil; that they were range men and they demanded range
  work or none; that if they must dig ditches and build fences and perform like
  menial tasks, they preferred doing it for themselves. "That," said Andy,
  "makes us out such dirty, low-down sons-of-guns we'd have to climb a tree to
  look a snake in the eye, but it's got the grain of truth that'll make it go
  down. We <i>don't</i> love this farming craft, and the Old Man knows it. He's heard
  us kicking often enough. That's where it'll git him. He'll believe this last
  stretch of fence is what made us throw him down, and he'll be so mad he'll
  cuss us out till the neighbors'll think the smoke's a prairie fire. We'll get
  our time, all right' and the things he'll say will likely make us so hot we
  can all talk convincing when we hit town. Keep a stiff upper lip, boys. We
  got to do it, and he'll make us mad, so it won't be as hard as you
  imagine."</p>

  <p>The theory was good, and revealed a knowledge of human nature that made
  one cease to wonder why Andy was a prince of convincing liars. The theory was
  good&mdash;nothing in the world was the matter with it, except that in this
  particular instance it did not work. The Old Man did not ask for their
  reasons, excuses or explanations. Neither did he say anything or do anything
  to make them mad. He just sat there, with his face gray and hard, and said
  nothing at all.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor appeared with the required books and a fountain pen; saw
  the Happy Family standing there like condemned men at the steps; saw the Old
  Man's face, and trembled wide-eyed upon the verge of speech. Then she decided
  that this was no time for questioning and hurried, still wide of eye, away
  from sight of them. The Happy Family did not look at one another&mdash;they
  looked chiefly at the wall of the house.</p>

  <p>The Old Man reckoned the wages due each one, and wrote a check for the
  exact amount. And he spoke no word that did not intimately concern the matter
  in hand. He still had that gray, hard look in his face that froze whatever
  explanation they would otherwise have volunteered. And when he handed the
  last man&mdash;who was Patsy&mdash;his check, he got up stiffly and turned
  his back on them, and went inside and closed the door while yet they
  lingered, waiting to explain.</p>

  <p>At the bunk-house, whence they walked silently, Slim turned suddenly upon
  their leader. His red face had gone a sallow white, and the whites of his
  eyes were veined with red.</p>

  <p>"If that there land business falls down anywhere because you lied to us,
  Andy Green, I'll kill you fer this," he stated flatly.</p>

  <p>"If it does, Slim, I'll stand and let yuh shoot me as full of lead as you
  like," Andy promised, in much the same tone. Then he strove to shake off the
  spell of the Old Man's stricken silence. "Buck up, boys. He'll thank us for
  what we aim to do&mdash;when he knows all about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems to me," sighed Weary lugubriously, "we mighta managed it
  without hitting the Old Man a wallop in the back, like that."</p>

  <p>"How'n hell did I know he'd take it the way he did?" Andy questioned
  sharply, and began throwing his personal belongings into his "war-bag" as if
  he had a grudge against his own clothes.</p>

  <p>"Aw, looks to me like he was glad to git shet of us!" grumbled Happy Jack.
  "I betche he's more tickled than sorry, right now."</p>

  <p>It was an exceedingly unhappy Family that rode up the Hog's Back upon
  their private mounts, and away from the Flying U; in spite of Chip's
  assurance that he would tell the Old Man all about it as soon as he could, it
  was an ill-humored Family that rode into Dry Lake and cashed their several
  checks at the desk of the General store which also did an informal banking
  business, and afterwards took the train for Great Falls.</p>

  <p>The news spread through the town that old J. G. Whitmore had fired the
  Happy Family in a bunch for some unforgivable crime against the peace and
  dignity of the outfit, and that the boys were hatching up some scheme to get
  even. From the gossip that was rolled relishfully upon the tongues of the Dry
  Lake scandal lovers, the Happy Family must have been more than sufficiently
  convincing.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch7"
     id="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE COMING OF THE COLONY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">If you would see northern Montana at its most beautiful
  best, you should see it in mid-May when the ground-swallows are nesting and
  the meadow larks are puffing their throats and singing of their sweet ecstasy
  with life; when curlews go sailing low over the green, grassy billows,
  peering and perking with long bills thrust rapier-wise through the sunny
  stillness, and calling shrilly, "Cor-r-ECK, cor-r-eck!"&mdash;which, I take
  it, is simply their opinion of world and weather given tersely in plain
  English. You should see the high prairies then, when all the world is
  a-shimmer with green velvet brocaded brightly in blue and pink and yellow
  flower-patterns; when the heat waves go quivering up to meet the sun, so that
  the far horizons wave like painted drop-scenes stirred by a breeze; when a
  hypnotic spell of peace and bright promises is woven over the
  rangeland&mdash;you should see it then, if you would love it with a sweet
  unreason that will last you through all the years to come.</p>

  <p>The Homeseekers Syndicate, as represented by Florence Grace
  Hallman&mdash;she of the wheat-yellow hair and the tempting red lips and the
  narrow, calculating eyes and stubborn chin&mdash;did well to wait for the
  spell of the prairies when the wind flowers and the lupines blue the
  hillsides and the new grass paints green the hollows.</p>

  <p>There is in us all a deep-rooted instinct to create, and never is that
  instinct so nearly dominant as in the spring when the grass and the flowers
  and the little, new leaves and the birds all sing the song of Creation
  together. Then is when case-hardened city dwellers study the bright array of
  seed-packets in the stores, and meditate rashly upon the possibilities of
  back-yard gardening. Then is when the seasoned country-dwellers walk over
  their farms in the sunset and plan largely for harvest time. Then is when the
  salaried-folk read avidly the real-estate advertisements, and pore
  optimistically over folders and dream of chicken ranches and fruit ranches
  and the like. Surely, then, the Homeseekers Syndicate planned well the date
  of their excursion into the land of large promise (and problematical
  fulfillment) which lay east of Dry Lake.</p>

  <p>Rumors of the excursion seeped through the channels of gossip and set the
  town talking and chuckling and speculating&mdash;after the manner of very
  small towns.</p>

  <p>Rumors grew to definite though erroneous statements of what was to take
  place. Definite statements became certified facts that bore fruit in detailed
  arrangements.</p>

  <p>Came Florence Grace Hallman smilingly from Great Falls, to canvass the
  town for "accommodations." Florence Grace Hallman was a capable woman and a
  persuasive one, though perhaps a shade too much inclined to take certain
  things for granted&mdash;such as Andy's anchored interest in her and her
  project, and the probability of the tract remaining just as it had been when
  last she went carefully over the plat in the land office. Florence Grace
  Hallman had been busy arranging the details of the coming of the colony, and
  she had neglected to visit the land office lately. Since she cannily
  represented the excursion as being merely a sight-seeing trip&mdash;or some
  such innocuous project&mdash;she failed also to receive any inkling of recent
  settlements.</p>

  <p>On a certain sunny morning in mid-May, the Happy Family stood upon the
  depot platform and waited for the westbound passenger, that had attached to
  it the special car of the Homeseekers Syndicate. The Happy Family had been
  very busy during the past three weeks. They had taken all the land they
  could, and had sighed because they could still look from their claims upon
  pinnacles as yet unclaimed save by the government. They had done well. From
  the south line of Meeker's land in the very foothills of the Bear Paws, to
  the north line of the Flying U, the chain of newly-filed claims remained
  unbroken. It had taken some careful work upon the part of the Happy Family to
  do this and still choose land not absolutely worthless except from a scenic
  viewpoint. But they had managed it, with some bickering and a good deal of
  maneuvering. Also they had hauled loads of lumber from Dry Lake, wherewith to
  build their monotonously modest ten-by-twelve shacks with one door and one
  window apiece and a round hole in the roof big enough for a length of
  stove-pipe to thrust itself aggressively into the open and say by its smoke
  signal whether the owner was at home. And now, having heard of the mysterious
  excursion due that day, they had come to see just what would take place.</p>

  <p>"She's fifteen minutes late," the agent volunteered, thrusting his head
  through the open window. "Looking for friends, boys?"</p>

  <p>"Andy is," Pink informed him cheerfully. "The rest of us are just hanging
  around through sympathy. It's his girl coming."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess he thinks he needs a housekeeper now," the agent grinned.
  "Why don't you fellows get busy now and rustle some cooks?"</p>

  <p>"Girls don't like to cook over a camp-fire," Cal Emmett told him soberly.
  "We kinda thought we ought to build our shacks first."</p>

  <p>"You can pick you out some when the train gets in," said the agent,
  accepting a match from Weary. "There's a carload of&mdash;" He pulled in his
  head hurriedly and laid supple fingers on the telegraph key to answer a call,
  and the Happy Family moved down to the other end of the platform where there
  was more shade.</p>

  <p>The agent presently appeared pushing the truck of outgoing express, a
  cheap trunk and a basket "telescope" belonging to one of the hotel
  girls&mdash;who had quit her job and was sitting now inside waiting for the
  train and seeing what she could of the Flying U boys through the
  window&mdash;and the mail sack. He placed the truck where the baggage car
  would come to a halt, stood for a minute looking down the track where a
  smudge of smoke might at any moment be expected to show itself over the low
  ridge of a hill, glanced at the lazy group in the patch of shade and went
  back into the office.</p>

  <p>"There's her smoke," Cal Emmett announced in the midst of an apathetic
  silence.</p>

  <p>Weary looked up from whittling a notch in the end of a platform plank and
  closed his jack-knife languidly.</p>

  <p>Andy pushed his hat backward and then tilted it forward over one eyebrow
  and threw away his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Wonder if Florence Grace will be riding point on the bunch?" he
  speculated aloud. "If she is, I'm liable to have my hands full. Florence
  Grace will sure be sore when she finds out how I got into the game."</p>

  <p>"Aw, I betche there ain't no such a person," said Happy Jack, doubter to
  the last.</p>

  <p>"I wish there wasn't," sighed Andy. "Florence Grace is kinda getting on my
  nerves. If I done what I feel like doing, I'd crawl under the platform and
  size up the layout through a crack. Honest to gracious, Boys, I hate to meet
  that lady."</p>

  <p>They grinned at him heartlessly and stared at the black smudge that was
  rolling toward them. "She's sure hittin' her up," Pink vouchsafed with a
  certain tenseness of tone. That train was not as ordinary trains; dimly they
  felt that it was relentlessly bringing them trouble, perhaps; certainly a
  problem&mdash;unless the homeseekers hovered only so long as it took them to
  see that wisdom lay in looking elsewhere for a home. Still&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If this was August instead of May, I wouldn't worry none about them
  pilgrims staying long," Jack Bates voiced the thought that was uppermost in
  their minds.</p>

  <p>"There comes two livery rigs to haul 'em to the hotel," Pink pointed out
  as he glanced toward town. "And there's another one. Johnny told me every room
  they've got is spoke for, and two in every bed."</p>

  <p>"That wouldn't take no crowd," Happy Jack grumbled, remembering the
  limitations of Dry Lake's hotel. "Here come Chip and the missus. Wonder what
  they want?"</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor left Chip to get their tickets and walked quickly toward
  them.</p>

  <p>"Hello, boys! Waiting for someone, or just going somewhere?"</p>

  <p>"Waiting. Same to you, Mrs. Chip," Weary replied.</p>

  <p>"To me? Well, we're going up to make our filings. Claude won't take a
  homestead, because we'll have to stay on at the Flying U, of course, and we
  couldn't hold one. But we'll both file desert claims. J. G. hasn't been a bit
  well, and I didn't dare leave him before&mdash;and of course Claude wouldn't
  go till I did. That the passenger coming, or a freight?"</p>

  <p>"It's the train&mdash;with the dry-farmers," Andy informed her with a
  glance at the nearing smoke-smudge.</p>

  <p>"Is it? We aren't any too soon then, are we? I left Son at home&mdash;and
  he threatened to run away and live with you boys. I almost wish I'd brought
  him along. He's been perfectly awful. So have the men Claude hired to take
  your places, if you want to know, boys. I believe that is what made J. G.
  sick&mdash;having those strange men on the place. He's been like a bear."</p>

  <p>"Didn't Chip tell him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He did, yes. He told him right away, that evening. But&mdash;J. G. has
  such stubborn ideas. We couldn't make him believe that anyone would be crazy
  enough to take up that land and try to make a living farming it. He&mdash;"
  She looked sidewise at Andy and pursed her lips to keep from smiling.</p>

  <p>"He thinks I lied about it, I suppose," said that young man shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"That's what he says. He pretends that you boys meant to quit, and just
  thought that up for an excuse. He'll be all right&mdash;you mustn't pay any
  attention&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Here she comes!"</p>

  <p>A black nose thrust through a Deep cut that had a curve to it. At their
  feet the rails began to hum. The Little Doctor turned hastily to see if Chip
  were coming. The agent came out with a handful of papers and stood waiting
  with the rest. Stragglers moved quickly, and the discharged waitress appeared
  and made eyes covertly at Pink, whom she considered the handsomest one of the
  lot.</p>

  <p>The train slid up, slowed and stopped. Two coaches beyond the platform a
  worried porter descended and placed the box-step for landing passengers, and
  waited. From that particular coach began presently to emerge a fluttering,
  exclaiming stream of humanity&mdash;at first mostly feminine. They hovered
  there upon the cindery path and lifted their faces to watch for others yet to
  come, and the babble of their voices could be heard above the engine
  sounds.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family looked dumbly at one another and drew back closer to the
  depot wall.</p>

  <p>"Aw, I knowed there was some ketch to it!" blurted Happy Jack with dismal
  satisfaction. "That there ain't no colony&mdash;It's nothin' but a bunch of
  schoolma'ams!"</p>

  <p>"That lady ridin' point is the lady herself," Andy murmured, edging behind
  Weary and Pink as the flutter came closer. "That's Florence Grace Hallman,
  boys."</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, git out and speak your little piece, then!" muttered
  Slim, and gave Andy an unexpected push that sent him staggering out into the
  open just as the leaders were coming up.</p>

  <p>"Why, how de do, Mr. Green!" cried the blonde leader of the flock. "This
  is an unexpected pleasure, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>"Yes ma'am, it is," Andy assented mildly, with an eye cocked sidewise in
  search of the guilty man.</p>

  <p>The blonde leader paused, her flock coming to a fluttering, staring stand
  behind her. The nostrils of the astonished Happy Family caught a mingled odor
  of travel luncheons and perfume.</p>

  <p>"Well, where have you been, Mr. Green? Why didn't you come and see me?"
  demanded Florence Grace Hallman in the tone of one who has a right to ask
  leading questions. Her cool, brown, calculating eyes went appraisingly over
  the Happy Family while she spoke.</p>

  <p>"I've been right around here, all the time," Andy gave meek account of
  himself. "I've been busy."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Did you go over the tract, Mr. Green?" she lowered her voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes-s&mdash;I went over it."</p>

  <p>"And what do you think of it&mdash;privately?"</p>

  <p>"Privately&mdash;it's pretty big." Andy sighed. The bigness of that tract
  had worried the Happy Family a good deal.</p>

  <p>"Well, the bigger the better. You see I've got 'em started." She flicked a
  glance backward at her waiting colony. "You men are perfectly exasperating!
  Why didn't you tell me where you were and what you were doing?" She looked up
  at him with charming disapproval. "I feel like shaking you! I could have made
  good use of you, Mr. Green."</p>

  <p>"I was making pretty good use of myself," Andy explained, and wished he
  knew who gave him that surreptitious kick on the ankle. Did the chump want an
  introduction? Well! In that case&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Miss Hallman, if you don't mind I'd like to introduce some men I rounded
  up and brought here," he began before the Happy Family could move out of the
  danger zone of his imagination. "Representative citizens, you see. You can
  sic your bunch onto 'em and get a lot of information. This is Mr. Weary
  Davidson, Miss Hallman: He's a hayseed that lives out that way and he talks
  spuds better than anything else. And here's Slim&mdash;I don't know his right
  name&mdash;he raises hogs to a fare-you-well. And this is Percy
  Perkins"&mdash;meaning Pink&mdash;"and he's another successful dryfarmer.
  Goats is his trade. He's got a lot of 'em. And Mr. Jack Bates, he raises
  peanuts&mdash;or he's trying 'em this year&mdash;and has contracts to supply
  the local market. Mr. Happy Jack is our local undertaker. He wants to sell
  out if he can, because nobody ever dies in this country and that makes
  business slow. He's thinking some of starting a duck-ranch. This man&mdash;"
  indicating Big Medicine&mdash;" has got the finest looking crop of volunteer
  wild oats in the country. He knows all about 'em. Mr. Emmett, here, can put
  you wise to cabbage-heads; that's his specialty. And Mr. Miguel Rapponi is up
  here from Old Mexico looking for a favorable location for an extensive rubber
  plantation. The natural advantages here are simply great for rubber.</p>

  <p>"I've gone to some trouble gathering this bunch together for you, Miss
  Hallman. I don't reckon you knew there was that many dry-farmers in the
  country. They've all got ranches of their own, and the prettiest folders you
  ever sent under a four-cent stamp can't come up to what these men can tell
  you. Your bunch won't have to listen to one man, only&mdash;here's half a
  dozen ready and waiting to talk."</p>

  <p>Miss Hallman was impressed. A few of the closest homeseekers she beckoned
  and introduced to the perspiring Happy Family&mdash;mostly feminine
  homeseekers, of whom there were a dozen or so. The men whom the hotel had
  sent down with rigs waited impatiently, and the unintroduced male colonists
  stared at the low rim of Lonesome Prairie and wondered if over there lay
  their future prosperity.</p>

  <p>When the Happy Family finally made their escape, red-faced and muttering
  threats, Andy Green had disappeared, and no one knew when he went or where.
  He was not in Rusty Brown's place when the Happy Family went to that haven
  and washed down their wrongs in beer. Pink made a hurried trip to the livery
  stable and reported that Andy's horse was gone.</p>

  <p>They were wondering among themselves whether he would have the nerve to go
  home and await their coming&mdash;home at this stage of the game meaning One
  Man coulee, which Andy had taken as a homestead and desert claim and where
  the Happy Family camped together until such time as their claim shacks were
  habitable. Some thought that he was hiding in town, and advised a thorough
  search before they took to their horses. The Native Son&mdash;he of mixed
  Irish and Spanish blood&mdash;told them with languid certainty that Andy was
  headed straight for the camp because he would figure that in camp was where
  they would least expect to find him.</p>

  <p>The opinions of the Native Son were usually worth adopting. In this case,
  however, it brought them into the street at the very moment when Florence
  Grace Hallman and two homeseekers had ventured from the hotel in search of
  them. Slim and Jack Bates and Cal Emmett saw them in time and shied across
  the street and into the new barber shop where they sat themselves down and
  demanded unnecessary hair-cuts and a shampoo apiece, and spied upon their
  unfortunate fellows through the window while they waited; but the others met
  the women fairly since it was too late to turn back without making themselves
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," began Miss Hallman in her brisk, business tone, "if
  some of you gentlemen could not help us out in the matter of conveyances. I
  have made arrangements for most of my guests, but we simply can't squeeze
  another one into the rigs I have engaged&mdash;and I've engaged every vehicle
  in town except a wheelbarrow I saw in the back yard of the hotel."</p>

  <p>"How many are left out?" asked Weary, since no one else showed any
  symptoms of speech.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not many, thank goodness. Just us three here. You've met Miss Allen,
  Mr. Davidson&mdash;and Miss Price. And so have you other gentlemen, because I
  introduced you at the depot. I went blandly ahead and told everybody just
  which rig they were to ride in, and put three in a seat, at that, and in
  counting noses I forgot to count our own&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I really don't see how she managed to overlook mine," sighed Miss Allen,
  laying a dainty, gloved finger upon a nose that had the tiniest possible tilt
  to it. "Nobody ever overlooked my nose before; it's almost worth walking to
  the tract."</p>

  <p>Irish, standing close beside Weary and looking enough like him to be a
  twin instead of a mere cousin, smiled down at her with traitorous admiration.
  Miss Allen's nose was a nice nose, and above it twinkled a pair of warm brown
  eyes with humorous little wrinkles , around them; and still above them
  fluffed a kinky-curly mass of brown hair. Weary looked at her also, but he
  did not smile, because she looked a little like his own schoolma'am, Miss
  Ruth Satterly&mdash;and the resemblance hurt a sore place in his heart.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;So if any of you gentlemen could possibly take us out to the
  tract, we'd be eternally grateful, besides keeping our independence intact
  with the usual payment. Could you help us out?"</p>

  <p>"We all came in on horseback," Weary stated with a gentle firmness that
  was intended to kill their hopes as painlessly as possible.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't there be room on behind?" asked Miss Allen with hope still alive
  and flourishing.</p>

  <p>"Lots of room," Weary assured her. "More room than you could possibly
  use."</p>

  <p>"But isn't there any kind of a rig that you could buy, beg, borrow or
  steal?" Miss Hallman insisted. "These girls came from Wisconsin to take up
  claims, and I've promised to see that they get the best there is to be had.
  They are hustlers, if I know what the word means. I have a couple of claims
  in mind, that I want them to see&mdash;and that's why we three hung back till
  the rest were all arranged for. I had a rig promised that I was depending on,
  and at the last minute discovered it was not to be had. Some doctor from
  Havre came and got it for a trip into the hills. There's no use talking; we
  just must get out to the tract as soon as the others do&mdash;a little sooner
  wouldn't hurt. Couldn't you think of some way?"</p>

  <p>"We'll try," Irish promised rashly, his eyes trying to meet Miss Allen's
  and succeeding admirably.</p>

  <p>"What has become of Mr. Green?" Miss Hallman demanded after she had
  thanked Irish with a smile for the qualified encouragement.</p>

  <p>"We don't know," Weary answered mildly. "We were trying to locate him
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Oh, were you? He seems a rather uncertain young man. I rather counted on
  his assistance; he promised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Irish has thought of a rig he can use, Miss Hallman," said the Allen
  girl suddenly. "He's going to drive us out himself. Let's hurry and get
  ready, so we can start ahead of the others. How many minutes will it take
  you, Mr. Irish, to have that team here, for us?"</p>

  <p>Irish turned red. He HAD thought of a rig, and he had thought of driving
  them himself, but he could not imagine how Miss Allen could possibly have
  known his thoughts. Then and there he knew who would occupy the other half of
  the front seat, in case he did really drive the team he had in mind.</p>

  <p>"I told you she's a hustler," laughed Miss Hallman. "She'll be raising
  bigger crops than you men&mdash;give her a year to get started. Well, girls,
  come on, then."</p>

  <p>They turned abruptly away, and Irish was left to his accounting with the
  Happy Family. He had not denied the thoughts and intentions imputed to him by
  the twinkling-eyed Miss Allen. They walked on toward the livery
  stable&mdash;where was manifested an unwonted activity&mdash;waiting for
  Irish to clear himself; which he did not do.</p>

  <p>"You going to drive them women out there?" Pink demanded after an
  impatient silence.</p>

  <p>"Why not ? Somebody'll have to."</p>

  <p>"What team are you going to use!" asked Jack Bates.</p>

  <p>"Chip's" Irish did not glance around, but kept striding down the middle of
  the road with his hands stuck deep in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you need help, amigo?" the Native Son insinuated
  craftily. "You can't talk to three girls at once; I could be hired to go
  along and take one off your hands. That should help some."</p>

  <p>"Like hell you will!" Irish retorted with characteristic bluntness. Then
  he added cautiously, "Which one?"</p>

  <p>"That old girl with the blue eyes should not be permitted to annoy the
  driver," drawled the Native Son. "Also, Florence Grace might want some
  intelligent person to talk to."</p>

  <p>"Well, I got my opinion of any man that'll throw in with that bunch," Pink
  declared hotly. "Why don't you fellows keep your own side of the fence. What if
  they are women farmers? They can do just as much harm&mdash;and a darn sight
  more. You make me sick."</p>

  <p>"Let 'em go," Weary advised calmly. "They'll be a lot sicker when the
  ladies discover what they've helped do to that bench-land. Come on,
  boys&mdash;let's pull out, away from all these lunatics. I hate to see them
  get stung, but I don't see what we can do about it&mdash;only, if they come
  around asking me what I think of that land, I'm going to tell 'em."</p>

  <p>"And then they'll ask you why you took claims up there, and you'll tell
  'em that, too&mdash;will you?" The Native Son turned and smiled at him
  ironically.</p>

  <p>That was it. They could not tell the truth without harming their own
  cause. They could not do anything except stand aside and see the thing
  through to whatever end fate might decree. They thought that Irish and the
  Native Son were foolish to take Chip's team and drive those women fifteen
  miles or so that they might seize upon land much better left alone; but that
  was the business of Irish and the Native Son, who did not ask for the
  approval of the Happy Family before doing anything they wanted to do.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family saddled and rode back to the claims, gravely discussing
  the potentialities of the future. Since they rode slowly while they talked,
  they were presently overtaken by a swirl of dust, behind which came the
  matched browns which were the Flying U's crack driving team, bearing Irish
  and Miss Allen of the twinkling eyes upon the front seat of a two seated
  spring-wagon that had seen far better days than this. Native Son helped to
  crowd the back seat uncomfortably, and waved a hand with reprehensible
  cheerfulness as they went rattling past.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family stared after them with frowning disapproval, and Weary
  turned in the saddle and looked ruefully at his fellows.</p>

  <p>"Things won't ever be the same around here," he predicted soberly. "There
  goes the beginning of the end of the Flying U, boys&mdash;and we ain't big
  enough to stop it."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch8"
     id="ch8">VIII. &mdash; FLORENCE GRACE HALLMAN SPEAKS PLAINLY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andy Green rode thoughtfully up the trail from his cabin in
  One Man Coulee, his hat tilted to the south to shield his face from the
  climbing sun, his eyes fixed absently upon the yellow soil of the hillside.
  Andy was facing a problem that concerned the whole Happy Family&mdash;and the
  Flying U as well. He wanted Weary's opinion, and Miguel Rapponi's, and
  Pink's&mdash;when it came to that, he wanted the opinion of them all.</p>

  <p>Thus far the boys had been wholly occupied with getting their shacks built
  and in rustling cooking outfits and getting themselves settled upon their
  claims with an air of convincing permanency. Also they had watched with keen
  interest&mdash;which was something more vital than mere
  curiosity&mdash;developments where the homeseekers were concerned, and had
  not given very much thought to their next step, except in a purely general
  way.</p>

  <p>They all recognized the fact that, with all these new settlers buzzing
  around hunting claims where there was some promise of making things grow,
  they would have to sit very tight indeed upon their own land if they would
  avoid trouble with "jumpers." Not all the homeseekers were women. There were
  men, plenty of them; a few of them were wholly lacking in experience it is
  true, but perhaps the more greedy for land because of their ignorance. The
  old farmers had looked askance at the high, dry prairie land, where even
  drinking water must be hauled in barrels from some deep-set creek whose
  shallow gurgling would probably cease altogether when the dry season came on
  the heels of June. The old farmers had asked questions that implied doubt.
  They had wanted to know about sub-soil, and average rainfall, and late
  frosts, and markets. The profusely illustrated folders that used blue print
  for emphasis here and there, seemed no longer to satisfy them.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family did not worry much about the old farmers who knew the
  game, but there were town men who had come to see the fulfillment of their
  dreams; who had burned their bridges, some of them, and would suffer much
  before they would turn back to face the ridicule of their friends and the
  disheartening task of getting a fresh foothold in the wage-market. These
  the Happy Family knew for incipient enemies once the struggle for existence
  was fairly begun. And there were the women&mdash;daring rivals of the men in
  their fight for independence&mdash;who had dreamed dreams and raised up
  ideals for which they would fight tenaciously. School-teachers who hated the
  routine of the schools, and who wanted freedom; who were willing to work and
  wait and forego the little, cheap luxuries which are so dear to women; who
  would cheerfully endure loneliness and spoiled complexions and roughened
  hands and broken nails, and see the prairie winds and sun wipe the sheen from
  their hair; who would wear coarse, heavy-soled shoes and keep all their
  pretty finery packed carefully away in their trunks with dainty sachet pads
  for month after month, and take all their pleasure in dreaming of the future;
  these would fight also to have and to hold&mdash;and they would fight harder
  than the men, more dangerously than the men, because they would fight
  differently.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family, then, having recognized these things and having measured
  the fighting-element, knew that they were squarely up against a slow, grim,
  relentless war if they would save the Flying U. They knew that it was going
  to be a pretty stiff proposition, and that they would have to obey strictly
  the letter and the spirit of the land laws, or there would be contests and
  quarrels and trouble without end.</p>

  <p>So they hammered and sawed and fitted boards and nailed on tar-paper and
  swore and jangled and joshed one another and counted nickels&mdash;where they
  used to disdain counting anything but results&mdash;and badgered the life out
  of Patsy because he kicked at being expected to cook for the bunch just the
  same as if he were in the Flying U mess-house. Py cosh, he wouldn't cook for
  the whole country just because they were too lazy to cook for themselves, and
  py cosh if they wanted him to cook for them they could pay him sixty dollars
  a month, as the Old Man did.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family were no millionaires, and they made the fact plain to
  Patsy to the full extent of their vocabularies. But still they begged bread
  from him, a loaf at a time, and couldn't see why he objected to making pie,
  if they furnished the stuff. Why, for gosh sake, had they planted him in the
  very middle of their string of claims, then? With a dandy spring too, that
  never went dry except in the driest years, and not more than seventy-five
  yards, at the outside, to carry water. Up hill? Well, what of that? Look at
  Pink&mdash;had to haul water half a mile from One Man Creek, and no trail.
  Look at Weary&mdash;had to pack water twice as far as Patsy. And hadn't they
  clubbed together and put up his darned shack first thing, just so he COULD
  get busy and cook? What did the old devil expect, anyway?</p>

  <p>Well&mdash;you see that the Happy Family had been fully occupied in the
  week since the arrival of the homeseekers' excursion. They could not be
  expected to give very much thought to their next steps. But there was Andy,
  who had only to move into the cabin in One Man Coulee, with a spring handy,
  and a stable for his horse, and a corral and everything. Andy had not been
  harassed with the house-building and settling, except as he assisted the
  others. As fast as the shacks were up, the Happy Family had taken possession,
  so that now Andy was alone, stuck down there in the coulee out of sight of
  everybody. Pink had once named One Man Coulee as the lonesomest hole in all
  that country, and he had not been far wrong. But at any rate the lonesomeness
  had served one good purpose, for it had started Andy to thinking out the
  details of their so called land-pool. Now the thinking had borne fruit to the
  extent that he felt an urgent need of the Happy Family in council upon the
  subject.</p>

  <p>As he topped at last the final rise which put him on a level with the
  great undulating bench-land gashed here and there with coulees and narrow
  gulches that gave no evidence of their existence until one rode quite close,
  he lifted his head and gazed about him half regretfully, half proudly. He
  hated to see that wide upland dotted here and there with new, raw buildings,
  which proclaimed themselves claim-shacks as far as one could see them. Andy
  hated the sight of claim-shacks with a hatred born of long range experience
  and the vital interests of the cattleman. A claim-shack stuck out on the
  prairie meant a barbed wire fence somewhere in the immediate vicinity; and
  that meant a hindrance to the easy handling of herds. A claim-shack meant a
  nester, and a nester was a nuisance, with his plowed fields and his few head
  of cattle that must be painstakingly weeded out of a herd to prevent a howl
  going up to high heaven. Therefore, Andy Green instinctively hated the sight
  of a shack on the prairie. On the other hand, those shacks belonged to the
  Happy Family&mdash;and that pleased him. From where he sat on his horse he
  could count five in sight, and there were more hidden by ridges and tucked
  away in hollows.</p>

  <p>But there were others going up&mdash;shacks whose owners he did not know.
  He scowled when he saw, on distant hilltops, the yellow skeletons that would
  presently be fattened with boards and paper and made the dwellingplace of
  interlopers. To be sure, they had as much right to take government land as
  had he or any of his friends&mdash;but Andy, being a normally selfish person,
  did not think so.</p>

  <p>From one partially built shack three quarters of a mile away on a bald
  ridge which the Happy Family had passed up because of its barrenness and the
  barrenness of the coulee on the other side, and because no one was willing to
  waste even a desert right on that particular eighty-acres, a team and light
  buggy came swiftly toward him. Andy, trained to quick thinking, was puzzled
  at the direction the driver was taking. That eighty acres joined his own west
  line, and unless the driver was lost or on the way to One Man Coulee, there
  was no reason whatever for coming this way.</p>

  <p>He watched and saw that the team was comin' straight toward him over the
  uneven prairie sod, and at a pace that threatened damage to the
  buggy-springs. Instinctively Andy braced himself in the saddle. At a half
  mile he knew the team, and it did not require much shrewdness to guess at the
  errand. He twitched the reins, turned his spurred heels against his horse and
  went loping over the grassland to meet the person who drove in such haste;
  and the probability that he was meeting trouble halfway only sent him the
  more eagerly forward.</p>

  <p>Trouble met him with hard, brown eyes and corn yellow hair blown in loose
  strands across cheeks roughened by the spring winds and sun-glare of Montana.
  Trouble pulled up and twisted sidewise in the seat and kicked the heads off
  some wild larkspurs with her whip while her tongue flayed the soul of Andy
  Green with sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have found out just how you helped me colonize this tract, Mr.
  Green," she began with a hard inflection under the smoothness of her voice.
  "I must compliment you upon your promptness and thoroughness in the matter;
  for an amateur you have made a remarkable showing&mdash;in&mdash;in treachery
  and deceit. I really did not suppose you had it in you."</p>

  <p>"Remember, I told you I might buy in if it looked good to me," Andy
  reminded her in the mildest tone of which he was capable&mdash;and he could
  be as mild as new milk when he chose.</p>

  <p>Florence Grace Hallman looked at him with a lift of her full upper lip at
  the left side. "It does look good, then? You told Mr. Graham and that Mr.
  Wirt a different story, Mr. Green. You told them this land won't raise white
  beans, and you were at some pains, I believe, to explain why it would not.
  You convinced them, by some means or other, that the whole tract is
  practically worthless for agricultural purposes. Both Mr. Wirt and Mr. Graham
  had some capital to invest here, and now they are leaving, and they have
  persuaded several others to leave with them. Does it really look good to
  you&mdash;this land proposition?"</p>

  <p>"Not your proposition&mdash;no, it don't." Andy faced her with a keen
  level glance as hard as her own. One could get the truth straight from the
  shoulder if one pushed Andy Green into a corner. "You know and I know that
  you're trying to cold-deck this bunch. The land won't raise white beans or
  anything else without water, and you know it. You can plant folks on the land
  and collect your money and tell 'em goodbye and go to it&mdash;and that
  settles your part of it. But how about the poor devils that put in their time
  and money?"</p>

  <p>Florence Grace Hallman spread her hands in a limited gesture because of
  the reins, and smiled unpleasantly. "And yet, you nearly broke your neck
  filing on the land yourself and getting a lot of your friends to file," she
  retorted. "What was your object, Mr. Green&mdash;since the land is
  worthless?"</p>

  <p>"My object don't matter to anyone but myself." Andy busied himself with
  his smoking material and did not look at her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but it does! It matters to me, Mr. Green, and to my company, and to
  our clients."</p>

  <p>"I'll have to buy me a new dictionary," Andy observed casually, reaching
  behind him to scratch a match on the skirt of his saddle. "The one I've got
  don't say anything about 'client' and 'victim' meaning the same thing. It's
  getting all outa date."</p>

  <p>"I brought enough clients&mdash;" she emphasized the word&mdash;" to
  settle every eighty acres of land in that whole tract. The policy of the
  company was eminently fair. We guaranteed to furnish a claim of eighty acres
  to every person who joined our Homeseekers Club, and free pasturage to all
  the stock they wanted to bring. Failing to do that, we pledged ourselves to
  refund the fee and pay all return expenses. We could have located every
  member of this lot, and more&mdash;only for <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>"Say, it'd be just as easy to swear as to say 'you' in that tone uh
  voice," Andy pointed out placidly.</p>

  <p>"You managed to gobble up just exactly four thousand acres of this
  tract&mdash;and you were careful to get all the water and all the best land.
  That means you have knocked us out of fifty settlements&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fifty wads of coin to hand back to fifty come-ons, and fifty return
  tickets for fifty fellows glad to get back&mdash;tough luck, ain't it?" Andy
  smiled sympathetically. "You oughta be glad I saved your conscience that much
  of a load, anyway."</p>

  <p>Florence Grace Hallman bit her lip to control her rage. "Smart talk isn't
  going to help you, Mr. Green. You've simply placed yourself in a position you
  can't hold. You've put it up to us to fight&mdash;and we're going to do it.
  I'm playing fair with you. I'll tell you this much: I've investigated you and
  your friends pretty thoroughly, and it's easy to guess what your object is.
  We rather expected the Flying U to fight this colonization scheme, so we are
  neither surprised nor unprepared. Mr. Green, for your own interest and that
  of your employer, let me advise you to abandon your claims now, before we
  begin action in the matter. It will be simpler, and far, far cheaper. We have
  our clients to look after, and we have the law all on our side. These are
  bona fide settlers we are bringing in; men and women whose sole object is to
  make homes for themselves. The land laws are pretty strict, Mr. Green. If we
  set the wheels in motion they will break the Flying U."</p>

  <p>Andy grinned while he inspected his cigarette. "Funny&mdash;I heard a man
  brag once about how he'd break the Flying U, with sheep," he drawled. "He
  didn't connect, though; the Flying U broke him." He smoked until he saw an
  angry retort parting the red lips of the lady, and then continued calmly:</p>

  <p>"The Flying U has got nothing to do with this case. As a matter of fact,
  old man Whitmore is pretty sore at us fellows right now, because we quit him
  and turned nesters right under his nose. Miss Hallman, you'll have one sweet
  time proving that we ain't bona fide settlers. We're just crazy to make homes
  for ourselves. We think it's time we settled down&mdash;and we're settling
  here because we're used to this country. We're real sorry you didn't find it
  necessary to pay your folks for the fun of pointing out the land to us and
  steering us to the land office&mdash;but we can't help that. We needed the
  money to buy plows." He looked at her full with his honest, gray eyes that
  could so deceive his fellow men&mdash;to say nothing of women. "And that
  reminds me, I've got to go and borrow a garden rake. I'm planting a patch of
  onions," he explained engagingly. "Say, this farming is a great game, isn't
  it? Well, good day, Miss Hallman. Glad I happened to meet you."</p>

  <p>"You won't be when I get through with you!" predicted the lady with her
  firm chin thrust a little forward. "You think you've got everything your own
  way, don't you? Well, you've just simply put yourself in a position where we
  can get at you. You deceived me from the very start&mdash;and now you shall
  pay the penalty. I've got our clients to protect&mdash;and besides that I
  shall dearly love to get even. Oh, you'll squeal for mercy, believe me!" She
  touched up the horses with her whip and went bumping away over the tough
  sod.</p>

  <p>"Wow!" ejaculated Andy, looking after her with laughter in his eyes.
  "She's sure one mad lady, all right. But shucks!" He turned and galloped off
  toward the farthest claim, which was Happy Jack's and the last one to be
  furnished with a lawful habitation.</p>

  <p>He was lucky. The Happy Family were foregathered there, wrangling with
  Happy Jack over some trifling thing. He joined zealously in the argument and
  helped them thrash Happy Jack in the word-war, before he came at his
  errand.</p>

  <p>"Say, boys, we'll have to get busy now," he told them seriously at last.
  "Florence Grace is onto us bigger'n a wolf&mdash;and if I'm any judge, that
  lady's going to be some fighter. We've either got to plow up a bunch of
  ground and plant some darn thing, or else get stock on and pasture it. They
  ain't going to over look any bets from now on. I met her back here on the
  bench. She was so mad she talked too much and I got next to their
  scheme&mdash;seems like we've knocked the Syndicate outa quite a bunch of
  money, all right. They want this land, and they think they're going to get
  it.</p>

  <p>"Now my idea is this: We've got to have stock, or we can't graze the land.
  And if we take Flying U cattle and throw 'em on here, they'll contest us for
  taking fake claims, for the outfit. So what's the matter with us buying a
  bunch from the Old Man?"</p>

  <p>"I'm broke," began Pink promptly, but Andy stopped him.</p>

  <p>"Listen here. We buy a bunch of stock and give him mortgages for the
  money, with the cattle for security. We graze 'em till the mortgage runs
  out&mdash;till we prove up, that means&mdash;and then we don't spot up, and
  the Old Man takes the stock back. See? We're grazing our own stock, according
  to law&mdash;but the outfit&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where do we git off at?" demanded Happy Jack suspiciously. "We got to
  live&mdash;and it takes money to buy grub, these days."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll make out all right. We can have so many head of cattle named
  for the mortgage; there'll be increase, and we should get that. By the time
  we all prove up we'll have a little bunch of stock of our own, d'yuh see? And
  we'll have the range&mdash;what there is left. These squatters ain't going to
  last over winter, if you ask me. And it'll be a long, cold day when another
  bunch of greenhorns bites on any colony scheme."</p>

  <p>"How do you know the Old Man'll do that, though?" Weary wanted to know.
  "He's pretty mad. I rode over to the ranch last week to see Chip, and the Old
  Man wouldn't have anything to say to me."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's the matter with all of us going? He can't pass up the whole
  bunch. We can put it up to him just the way it is, and he'll see where it's
  going to be to his interest to let us have the cattle. Why, darn it, he can't
  help seeing now why we quit!" Pink looked ready to start then, while his
  enthusiasm was fresh.</p>

  <p>"Neither can Florence Grace help seeing why we did it," Andy supplemented
  dryly. "She can think what she darn pleases&mdash;all we got to do is deliver
  the goods right up to the handle on these claims and not let her prove
  anything on us."</p>

  <p>"It'll take a lot uh fencing," Happy Jack croaked pessimistically. "We
  ain't got the money to buy wire and posts, ner the time to build the
  fence."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with range-herding 'em?" Andy seemed to have thought it
  all out, and to have an answer for every objection. "We can take turns at
  that&mdash;and we must all be careful and don't let 'em graze on our
  neighbors!"</p>

  <p>Whereat the Happy Family grinned understandingly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the Old Man'll let us have three or four hundred head uh cows on
  shares," Cal hazarded optimistically.</p>

  <p>"Can't take 'em that way," said the Native Son languidly. "It wouldn't be
  safe. Andy's right; the way to do is buy the cattle outright, and give a
  mortgage on the bunch. And I think we better split the bunch, and let every
  fellow buy a few head. We can graze 'em together&mdash;the law can't stop us
  from doing that."</p>

  <p>"Sounds good&mdash;if the Old Man will come to the centre," said Weary
  dubiously. The chill atmosphere of Flying U coulee, with strangers in the
  bunk-house and with the Old Man scowling at his paper on the porch, had left
  its effect upon Weary, sunny-souled as he was.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he'll come through," cried Cal, moving toward his horse. "gee whiz,
  he's got to! Come on&mdash;let's go and get it done with. As it stands now,
  we ain't got a thing to do but set around and look wise&mdash;unless we go
  spoiling good grass with plows. First thing we know our neighbors will be
  saying we ain't improving our claims!"</p>

  <p>"You improve yours every time you git off it!" stated Happy Jack
  spitefully because of past wrongs. "You could improve mine a whole lot that
  way, too," he added when he heard the laugh of approval from the others.</p>

  <p>They rung all the changes possible upon that witticism while they mounted
  and rode away, every man of them secretly glad of some excuse for making
  overtures to the Old Man. In spite of the excitement of getting on to their
  claims, and of watching strangers driving here and there in haste, and
  hauling loads of lumber toilfully over the untracked grass and building
  chickencoop dwellings as nearly alike as the buttons on a new
  shirt&mdash;in spite of all that, they had felt keenly their exile from Flying U
  ranch. They had stayed away, for two reasons: one was a latent stubbornness
  which made them resent the Old Man's resentment; the other was a matter of
  policy, as preached by Andy Green and the Native Son. It would not do, said
  these two cautious ones, to be running to the Flying U outfit all the
  time.</p>

  <p>So the Happy Family had steered clear since that afternoon when they had
  simulated treachery to the outfit. And fate played them a scurvy trick in
  spite of their caution, for just as they rode down the Hog's Back and across
  the ford, Florence Grace Hallman rode away from the White House and met them
  fairly at the stable.</p>

  <p>Florence Grace smiled a peculiar smile as she went past them. A smile that
  promised she would not forget; a smile that told them how sure she felt of
  having caught them fairly. With the smile went a chilly, supercilious bow
  that was worse than a direct cut, and which the Happy Family returned
  doubtfully, not at all sure of the rules governing warfare with a woman.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch9"
     id="ch9">IX. &mdash; THE HAPPY FAMILY BUYS A BUNCH OF CATTLE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">With the Kid riding gleefully upon Weary's shoulder they
  trooped up the path their own feet had helped wear deep to the bunk-house.
  They looked in at the open door and snorted at the cheerlessness of the
  place.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come back here and stay?" the Kid demanded. "I was going to
  sleep down here with you&mdash;and now Doctor Dell won't let me. These hobees
  are no good. They're damn' bone-head. Daddy Chip says so. I wish you'd come
  back, so I can sleep with you. One man's named Ole and he's got a funny eye
  that looks at the other one all the time. I wish you'd come back."</p>

  <p>The Happy Family wished the same thing, but they did not say so. Instead
  they told the Kid to ask his mother if he couldn't come and visit them in
  their new shacks, and promised indulgences that would have shocked the Little
  Doctor had she heard them. So they went on to the house, where the Old Man
  sat on the porch looking madder than when they had left him three weeks
  before.</p>

  <p>"Why don't yuh run them nesters outa the country?" he demanded peevishly
  when they were close enough for speech. "Here they come and accuse me to my
  face of trying to defraud the gov'ment. Doggone you boys, what you think
  you're up to, anyway? What's three or four thousand acres when they're
  swarming in here like flies to a butcherin'? They can't make a
  living&mdash;serve 'em right. What you doggone rowdies want now?"</p>

  <p>Not a cordial welcome, that&mdash;if they went no deeper than his words.
  But there was the old twinkle back of the querulousness in the Old Man's
  eyes, and the old pucker of the lips behind his grizzled whiskers. "You've
  got that doggone Kid broke to foller yuh so we can't keep him on the ranch no
  more," he added fretfully. "Tried to run away twice, on Silver. Chip had to
  go round him up. Found him last time pretty near over to Antelope Coulee,
  hittin' the high places for town. Might as well take yuh back, I guess, and
  save time running after the Kid."</p>

  <p>"We've got to hold down our claims," Weary minded him regretfully. In
  three weeks, he could see a difference in the Old Man, and the change hurt
  him.</p>

  <p>Lines were deeper drawn, and the kind old eyes were a shade more
  sunken.</p>

  <p>"What's that amount to?" grumbled the Old Man, looking from one to the
  other under his graying eye brows. "You can't stop them dry-farmers from
  taking the country. Yuh might as well try to dip the Missouri dry with a
  bucket. They'll flood the country with stock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, they won't," put in Big Medicine, impatient for the real meat of
  their errand. "By cripes, we got a scheme to beat that&mdash;you tell 'im,
  Weary."</p>

  <p>"We want to buy a bunch of cattle from you," Weary said obediently. "We
  want to graze our claims, instead of trying to crop the land. We haven't any
  fence up, so we'll have to range-herd our stock, of course. I&mdash;don't
  hardly think any nester stock will get by us, J. G. And seeing our land runs
  straight through from Meeker's line fence to yours, we kinda think we've got
  the nesters pretty well corralled. They're welcome to the range between
  Antelope Coulee and Dry Lake, far as we're concerned. Soon as we can afford
  it," he added tranquilly, "we'll stretch a fence along our west line that'll
  hold all the darn milkcows they've a mind to ship out here."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" The Old Man studied them quizzically, his chin on his chest.</p>

  <p>"How many yuh want?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"All you'll sell us. We want to give mortgages, with the stock for
  security."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yuh do, ay? What if I have to foreclose on yuh?" The pucker of his
  lips grew more pronounced." Where do you git off at, then?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we kinda thought we could fix it up to save part of the increase
  outa the wreck, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Oh. That's it ay?" He studied them another minute. "You'll want all my
  best cows, too, I reckon&mdash;all that grade stock I shipped in last spring.
  Ay?"</p>

  <p>"We wouldn't mind," grinned Weary, glancing at the others roosting at ease
  along the edge of the porch.</p>

  <p>"Think you could handle five-hundred head&mdash;the pick uh the
  bunch?"</p>

  <p>"Sure, we could! We'd rather split 'em up amongst us, though&mdash;let
  every fellow buy so many. We can throw in together on the herding."</p>

  <p>"Think you can keep the milk-cows between you and Dry Lake, ay?" The Old
  Man chuckled&mdash;the first little chuckle since the Happy Family left him
  so unceremoniously three weeks before. "How about that, Pink?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I think we can," chirped Pink cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Well, you're the toughest bunch, take yuh up one side and down the
  other, I ever seen keep onta jail&mdash;I guess maybe you can do it. But
  lemme tell you boys something&mdash;and I want you to remember it: You don't
  want to git the idea in your heads you're going to have any snap; you ain't.
  If I know B from a bull's foot, you've got your work cut out for yuh. I've
  been keeping cases pretty close on this dry-farm craze, and this stampede for
  claims. Folks are land crazy. They've got the idea that a few acres of land
  is going to make 'em free and independent&mdash;and it don't matter much what
  the land is, or where it is. So long as it's land, and they can git it from
  the government for next to nothing, they're satisfied. And yuh want to
  remember that. Yuh don't want to take it for granted they're going to take a
  look at your deadline and back up. If they ship in stock, they're going to
  see to it that stock don't starve. You'll have to hold off men and women
  that's making their last stand, some of 'em, for a home of their own. They
  ain't going to give up if they can help it. You get a man with his back agin
  the wall, and he'll fight till he drops. I don't need to tell yuh that."</p>

  <p>The Happy Family listened to him soberly, their eyes staring broodily at
  the picture he conjured.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly, we're makin' our last stand, too," Slim blurted with his
  customary unexpectedness. "Our back's agin the wall right now. If we can't
  hold 'em back from takin' what little range is left, this outfit's going
  under. We got to hold 'em, by golly, er there won't be no more Flying U."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Andy Green quietly, "that's all right. We're going to hold
  'em."</p>

  <p>The Old Man lifted his bent head and looked from one to another. Pride
  shone in his eyes, that had lately stared resentment. "Yuh know, don't yuh,
  the biggest club they can use?" He leaned forward a little, his lips working
  under his beard.</p>

  <p>"Sure, we know. We'll look out for that." Weary smiled hearteningly.</p>

  <p>"We want a good lawyer to draw up those mortgages," put in the Native Son
  lazily. "And we'll pay eight per cent. interest."</p>

  <p>"Doggonedest crazy bunch ever I struck," grumbled the Old Man with
  grateful insincerity. "What you fellers don't think of, there ain't any use
  in mentioning. Oh, Dell! Bring out that jug Blake sent me! Doggoned thirsty
  bunch out here&mdash;won't stir a foot till they sample that wine! Got to get
  rid of 'em somehow&mdash;they claim to be full uh business as a jack rabbit
  is of fleas! When yuh want to git out and round up them cows? Wagon's over on
  Dry Creek som'ers&mdash;or ought to be. Yuh might take your soogans and ride
  ove' there tomorrow or next day and ketch 'em. I'll write a note to Chip and
  tell 'im what's to be done. And while you're pickin' your bunch you can draw
  wages just the same as ever, and help them double-dutch blisterin' milk-fed
  pilgrims with the calf crop."</p>

  <p>"We'll sure do that," promised Weary for the bunch. "We can start in the
  morning, all right."</p>

  <p>"Take a taste uh this wine. None of your tobaccojuice stuff; this comes
  straight from Fresno. Senator Blake sent it the other day. Fill up that
  glass, Dell! What yuh want to be so doggone stingy fer? Think this bunch uh
  freaks are going to stand for that? They can't git the taste outa less'n a
  pint. This ain't any doggone liver-tonic like you dope out."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor smiled understandingly and filled their glasses with the
  precious wine from sunland. She did not know what had happened, but she did
  know that the Old Man had seized another hand-hold on life in the last hour,
  and she was grateful. She even permitted the Kid to take a tiny sip, just
  because the Happy Family hated to see him refused anything he wanted.</p>

  <p>So Flying U Coulee was for the time being filled with the same old
  laughter and the same atmosphere of care-free contentment with life. The
  Countess stewed uncomplainingly in the kitchen, cooking dinner for the boys.
  The Old Man grumbled hypocritically at them from his big chair, and named
  their faults in the tone that transmuted them into virtues. The Little Doctor
  heard about Miss Allen and her three partners, who were building a four-room
  shack on the four corners of four claims, and how Irish had been caught more
  than once in the act of staring fixedly in the direction of that shack. She
  heard a good many things, and she guessed a good many more.</p>

  <p>By mid-afternoon the Old Man was fifty per cent brighter and better than
  he had been in the morning, and he laughed and bullied them as of old. When
  they left he told them to clear out and stay out, and that if he caught them
  hanging around his ranch, and making it look as if he were backing them and
  trying to defraud the government, he'd sic the dog onto them. Which tickled
  the Kid immensely, because there wasn't any dog to sic.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10">X. &mdash; WHEREIN ANDY GREEN LIES TO A LADY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the soft-creeping dusk came Andy Green, slouched in the
  saddle with the weariness of riding since dawn; slouched to one side and
  singing, with his hat far back on his head and the last of a red sunset
  tinting darkly the hills above him. Tip-toe on a pinnacle a great, yellow
  star poised and winked at him knowingly. Andy's eyes twinkled answer as he
  glanced up that way. "We've got her going, old-timer," he announced lazily to
  the star.</p>

  <p>Six miles back toward the edge of the "breaks" which are really the
  beginning of the Badlands that border the Missouri River all through that
  part of Montana, an even five hundred head of the Flying U's best grade cows
  and their calves were settling down for the night upon a knoll that had been
  the bed-ground of many a herd. At the Flying U ranch, in the care of the Old
  Man, were the mortgages that would make the Happy Family nominal owners of
  those five hundred cows and their calves. In the morning Andy would ride back
  and help bring the herd upon its spring grazing ground, which was the claims;
  in the meantime he was leisurely obeying an impulse to ride into One Man
  Coulee and spend the night under his own roof. And, say what you will, there
  is a satisfaction not to be denied in sleeping sometimes under one's own
  roof; and it doesn't matter in the least that the roof is made of prairie
  dirt thrown upon cottonwood poles. So he sang while he rode, and his voice
  boomed loud in the coulee and scared long stilled echoes into repeating the
  song:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"We're here because we're here, because we're here, because
  we're here,<br>
  We're here because we're here, because we're here, because we're
  here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That, if you please, is a song; there are a lot more verses exactly like
  this one, which may be sung to the tune of Auld Lang Syne with much
  effectiveness when one is in a certain mood. So Andy sang, while his tired
  horse picked its way circumspectly among the scattered rocks of the trail up
  the coulee.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"It's time you're here, it's time you're here,<br>
  It's time that you were here&mdash;"</p>

  <p>mocked an echo not of the hills.</p>

  <p>Andy swore in his astonishment and gave his horse a kick as a mild hint
  for haste. He thought he knew every woman-voice in the neighborhood&mdash;or
  had until the colony came&mdash;but this voice, high and sweet and with a
  compelling note that stirred him vaguely, was absolutely strange. While he
  loped forward, silenced for the moment, he was conscious of a swift, keen
  thankfulness that Pink had at the last minute decided to stay in camp that
  night instead of accompanying Andy to One Man. He was in that mood when a
  sentimental encounter appealed to him strongly; and a woman's voice, singing
  to him from One Man cabin, promised undetermined adventure.</p>

  <p>He did not sing again. There had been something in the voice that held him
  quiet, listening, expectant. But she also was silent after that last, high
  note&mdash;like a meadow lark startled in the middle of his song, thought
  Andy whimsically.</p>

  <p>He came within sight of the cabin, squatting in the shadow of the grove at
  its back. He half-expected to see a light, but the window was dark, the door
  closed as he had left it. He felt a faint, unreasoning disappointment that it
  was so. But he had heard her. That high note that lingered upon the word
  "here" still tingled his senses. His eyes sent seeking glances here and there
  as he rode up.</p>

  <p>Then a horse nickered welcomingly, and someone rode out from the deeper
  shadow at the corner of the cabin, hesitated as though tempted to flight, and
  came on uncertainly. They met full before the cabin, and the woman leaned and
  peered through the dusk at Andy.</p>

  <p>"Is this&mdash;Mr. Mallory&mdash;Irish?" she asked nervously. "Oh dear!
  Have I gone and made a fool of myself again?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all! Good evening, Miss Allen." Andy folded his hands upon the
  saddle horn and regarded her with a little smile, keen for what might come
  next.</p>

  <p>"But you're not Irish Mallory. I thought I recognized the voice, or I
  wouldn't have&mdash;" She urged her horse a step closer, and Andy observed
  from her manner that she was not accustomed to horses. She reined as if she
  were driving, so that the horse, bewildered, came sidling up to him. "Who are
  you?" she asked him sharply.</p>

  <p>"Me? Why, I'm a nice young man&mdash;a lot better singer than Irish. I
  guess you never heard him, did you?" He kept his hands folded on the horn,
  his whole attitude passive&mdash;a restful, reassuring passivity that lulled
  her uneasiness more than words could have done.</p>

  <p>"Oh, are you Andy Green? I seem to connect that name with your
  voice&mdash;and what little I can see of you."</p>

  <p>"That's something, anyway." Andy's tone was one of gratitude. "It's two
  per cent. better than having to tell you right out who I am. I met you three
  different times, Miss Allen," he reproached.</p>

  <p>"But always in a crowd," she defended, "and I never talked with you,
  particularly."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, that's easily fixed," he said. "It's a nice night," he added,
  looking up appreciatively at the brightening star-sprinkle. "Are you living
  on your claim now? We can talk particularly on the way over."</p>

  <p>Miss Allen laughed and groped for a few loose hairs, found them and tucked
  them carefully under her hatcrown. Andy remembered that gesture; it helped
  him to visualize her clearly in spite of the deepening night.</p>

  <p>"How far have you ridden today, Mr. Green?" she asked irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"Since daylight, you mean? Not so very far counting miles&mdash;We were
  trailing a herd, you see. But I've been in the saddle since sunrise, except
  when I was eating."</p>

  <p>"Then you want a cup of coffee, before you ride any farther. If I get
  down, will you let me make it for you? I'd love to. I'm crazy to see inside
  your cabin, but I only rode up and tried to peek in the window before you
  came. I have two brothers and a cousin, so I understand men pretty well and I
  know you can talk better when you aren't hungry."</p>

  <p>"Are you living on your claim?" he asked again, without moving.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. We moved in last week."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll ride over, then, and you can make coffee there. I'm not
  hungry right now."</p>

  <p>"Oh." She leaned again and peered at him, trying to read his face. "You
  don't WANT me to go in!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do&mdash;but I don't. If you stayed and made coffee, tomorrow
  you'd be kicking yourself for it, and you'd be blaming me." Which,
  considering the life he had lived, almost wholly among men, was rather astute
  of Andy Green.</p>

  <p>"Oh." Then she laughed. "You must have some sisters, Mr. Green." She was
  silent for a minute, looking at him. "You're right," she said quietly then.
  "I'm always making a fool of myself, just on the impulse of the moment. The
  girls will be worried about me, as it is. But I don't want you to ride any
  farther, Mr. Green. What I came to say need not take very long, and I think I
  can find my way home alone, all right."</p>

  <p>"I'll take you home when you're ready to go," said Andy quietly. All at
  once he had wanted to shield her, to protect her from even so slight an
  unconventionality as making his coffee for him. He had felt averse to putting
  her at odds with her conventional self, of inviting unfavorable criticism of
  himself; dimly, because instinct rather than cold analysis impelled him. What
  he had told her was the sum total of his formulated ideas.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm ready to go now, since you insist on my being conventional. I
  did not come West with the expectation of being tied to a book of etiquette,
  Mr. Green. But I find one can't get away from it after all. Still, living on
  one's own claim twelve miles from a town is something!"</p>

  <p>"That's a whole lot, I should say," Andy assured her politely, and
  refrained from asking her what she expected to do with that eighty acres of
  arid land. He turned his tired horse and rode alongside her, prudently
  waiting for her to give the key.</p>

  <p>"I'm not supposed to be away over here, you know," she began when they
  were near the foot of the bluff up which the trail wound seeking the easiest
  slopes and avoiding boulders and deep cuts. "I'm supposed to be just out
  riding, and the girls expected me back by sundown. But I've been trying and
  trying to find some of you Flying U boys&mdash;as they call you men who have
  taken so much land&mdash;on your claims. I don't know that what I could tell
  you would do you a particle of good&mdash;or anyone else. But I wanted to
  tell you, anyway, just to clear my own mind."</p>

  <p>"It does lots of good just to meet you," said Andy with straightforward
  gallantry. "Pleasures are few and far between, out here."</p>

  <p>"You said that very nicely, I'm sure," she snubbed. "Well, I'm going to
  tell you, anyway&mdash;just on the chance of doing some good." Then she
  stopped.</p>

  <p>Andy rode a rod or two, glancing at her inquiringly, waiting for her to go
  on. She was guiding her horse awkwardly where it needed only to be let alone,
  and he wanted to give her a lesson in riding. But it seemed too early in
  their acquaintance for that, so he waited another minute.</p>

  <p>"Miss Hallman is going to make you a lot of trouble," she began abruptly.
  "I thought perhaps it might be better for you&mdash;all of you&mdash;if you
  knew it in advance, so there would be no sudden anger and excitement. All the
  settlers are antagonistic, Mr. Green&mdash;all but me, and one or two of the
  girls. They are going to do everything they can to prevent your land-scheme
  from going through. You are going to be watched and&mdash;and your land
  contested&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll be right there, I guess, when the dust settles," he filled in
  her thought unmoved.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;almost hope so," she ventured. "For my part, I can see the
  side&mdash;your side. I can see where it is very hard for the cattle men to
  give up their range. It is like the big plantations down south, when the
  slaves were freed. It had to be done, and yet it was hard upon those planters
  who depended on free labor. They resented it deeply; deeply enough to shed
  blood&mdash;and that is one thing I dread here. I hope, Mr. Green, that you
  will not resort to violence. I want to urge you all to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I understand," said Andy softly. "A-course, we're pretty bad when we get
  started, all right. We're liable to ride up on dark nights and shoot our
  enemies through the window&mdash;I can't deny it, Miss Allen. And if it comes
  right to a show-down, I may as well admit that some of us would think nothing
  at all of taking a man out and hanging him to the first tree we come to,
  that was big enough to hold him. But now that ladies have come into the
  country, a-course we'll try and hold our tempers down all we can. Miss
  Hallman, now&mdash;I don't suppose there's a man in the bunch that would
  shoot her, no matter what she done to us. We take pride in being polite to
  women. You've read that about us, haven't you, Miss Allen? And you've seen us
  on the stage&mdash;well, it's a fact, all right. Bad as we are, and wild and
  tough, and savage when we're crossed, a lady can just do anything with us, if
  she goes at it the right way."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. I felt sure that you would not harm any of us. Will you
  promise not to be violent&mdash;not to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andy sat sidewise in the saddle, so that he faced her. Miss Allen could
  just make out his form distinctly; his face was quite hidden, except that she
  could see the shine of his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Now, Miss Allen," he protested with soft apology "You musta known what to
  expect when you moved out amongst us rough characters. You know I can make
  any promises about being mild with the men that try to get the best of us. If
  you've got friends&mdash;brothers&mdash;anybody here that you think a lot of,
  Miss Allen, I advise you to send 'em outa the country, before trouble breaks
  loose; because when she starts she'll start a-popping. I know I can't answer
  for my self, what I'm liable to do if they bother me; and I'm about the
  mildest one in the bunch. What the rest of the boys would do&mdash;Irish
  Mallory for instance&mdash;I hate to think, Miss Allen.
  I&mdash;hate&mdash;to&mdash;think!"</p>

  <p>Afterwards, when he thought it all over dispassionately, Andy wondered why
  he had talked to Miss Allen like that. He had not done it deliberately, just
  to frighten her&mdash;yet he had frightened her to a certain extent. He had
  roused her apprehension for the safety of her neighbors and the ultimate
  well-being of himself and his fellows. She had been so anxious over winning
  him to more peaceful ways that she had forgotten to give him any details of
  the coming struggle. Andy was sorry for that. He wished, on the way home,
  that he knew just what Florence Grace Hallman intended to do.</p>

  <p>Not that it mattered greatly. Whatever she did, Andy felt that it would be
  futile. The Happy Family were obeying the land laws implicitly, except as
  their real incentive had been an unselfish one. He could not feel that it was
  wrong to try and save the Flying U; was not loyalty a virtue? And was not the
  taking of land for the preservation of a fine, fair dealing outfit that had
  made itself a power for prosperity and happiness in that country, a perfectly
  laudable enterprise? Andy believed so.</p>

  <p>Even though they did, down in their deepest thoughts, think of the Flying
  U's interest, Andy did not believe that Florence Grace Hallman or anyone else
  could produce any evidence that would justify a contest for their land.
  Though they planned among themselves for the good of the Flying U, they were
  obeying the law and the dictates of their range-conscience and their
  personal ideas of right and justice and loyalty to their friends and to
  themselves. They were not conspiring against the general prosperity of the
  country in the hope of great personal gain. When you came to that, they were
  saving fifty men from bitter disappointment&mdash;counting one settler to
  every eighty acres, as the Syndicate apparently did.</p>

  <p>Still, Andy wondered why he had represented himself and his friends to be
  such bloodthirsty devils. He grinned wickedly over some of the things he had
  said, and over her womanly perturbation and pleading that they would spare
  the lives of their enemies. Oh, well&mdash;if she repeated half to Florence
  Grace Hallman, that lady would maybe think twice before she tackled the
  contract of boosting the Happy Family off their claims. So at the last he
  managed to justify his lying to her. He liked Miss Allen. He was pleased to
  think that at least she would not forget him the minute he was out of her
  sight.</p>

  <p>He went to sleep worrying, not over the trouble which Florence Grace
  Hallman might be plotting to bring upon him, but about Miss Allen's given
  name and her previous condition of servitude. He hoped that she was not a
  stenographer, and he hoped her first name was not Mary; and if you know the
  history of Andy Green you will remember that he had a reason for disliking
  both the name and the vocation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11">XI. &mdash; A MOVING CHAPTER IN EVENTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Having nothing more than a general warning of trouble ahead
  to disturb him, Andy rode blithely back down the coulee and met the herd just
  after sunrise. Dreams of Miss Allen had left a pleasant mood behind them,
  though the dreams themselves withdrew behind the veil of forgetfulness when
  he awoke. He wondered what her first name was. He wondered how far Irish's
  acquaintance with her had progressed, but he did not worry much about Irish.
  Having represented himself to be an exceedingly dangerous man, and having
  permitted himself to be persuaded into promising reform and a calm
  demeanor&mdash;for her sake&mdash;he felt tolerably sure of her interest in
  him. He had heard that a woman loves best the taming of a dangerous man, and
  he whistled and sang and smiled until the dust of the coming herd met him
  full. Since he felt perfectly sure of the result, he hoped that Florence
  Grace Hallman would start something, just so that he might show Miss Allen
  how potent was her influence over a bad, bad man who still has virtues worth
  nurturing carefully.</p>

  <p>Weary, riding point on the loitering herd, grinned a wordless greeting.
  Andy passed with a casual wave of his hand and took his place on the left
  flank. From his face Weary guessed that all was well with the claims, and the
  assurance served to lighten his spirits. Soon he heard Andy singing at the
  top of his voice, and his own thoughts fell into accord with the words of the
  ditty. He began to sing also, whenever he knew the words. Farther back, Pink
  took it up, and then the others joined in, until all unconsciously they had
  turned the monotonous drive into a triumphal march.</p>

  <p>"They're a little bit rough I must confess, the most of them at least,"
  prompted Andy, starting on the second verse alone because the others didn't
  know the song as well as he. He waited a second for them to join him, and
  went on extolling the valor of all true cowboys:</p>

  <p>"But long's you do not cross their trail you can live with them at
  peace.</p>

  <p>"But if you do, they're sure to rue the day you come to their land.</p>
   For they'll follow you up and shoot it out, and do it man to man."</p>

  <p>"Say, Weary! They tell me Florence Grace is sure hittin' the warpost!
  Ain't yuh scared?"</p>

  <p>Weary shook his head and rode forward to ease the leaders into a narrow
  gulch that would cut off a mile or so of the journey.</p>

  <p>"Taking 'em up One Man?" called Pink, and got a nod for answer. There was
  a lull in the singing while they shouted and swore at these stubborn cows who
  would have tried to break back on the way to a clover patch, until the gulch
  broadened into an arm of One Man Coulee itself. It was all peaceful and easy
  and just as they had planned. The morning was cool and the cattle contented.
  They were nearing their claims, and all that would remain for them to do was
  the holding of their herd upon the appointed grazing ground. So would the
  requirements of the law be fulfilled and the machinations of the Syndicate be
  thwarted and the land saved to the Flying U, all in one.</p>

  <p>And then the leaders, climbing the hill at a point half a mile below
  Andy's cabin, balked, snorted and swung back. Weary spurred up to push them
  forward, and so did Andy and Pink. They rode up over the ridge shouting and
  urging the reluctant cattle ahead, and came plumb into the very dooryard of a
  brand new shack. A man was standing in the doorway watching the disturbance
  his presence had created; when he saw the three riders come busting up over
  the crest of the bluff, his eyes widened.</p>

  <p>The three came to a stop before him, too astonished to do more than stare.
  Once past the fancied menace of the new building and the man, the cattle went
  trotting awkwardly across the level, their calves galloping alongside.</p>

  <p>"Hello," said Weary at last, "what do you think you're doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Me? I'm holding down a claim. What are you doing?" The man did not seem
  antagonistic or friendly or even neutral toward them. He seemed to be
  waiting. He eyed the cattle that kept coming, urged on by those who shouted
  at them in the coulee below. He watched them spread out and go trotting away
  after the leaders.</p>

  <p>"Say, when did yuh take this claim?" Andy leaned negligently forward and
  looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, a week or so ago. Why?"</p>

  <p>"I just wondered. I took it up myself, four weeks ago. Four forties I've
  got, strung out in a line that runs from here to yonder. You've got over on
  my land&mdash;by mistake, of course. I just thought I'd tell yuh," he added
  casually, straightening up, "because I didn't think you knew it before."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." The man smiled one-sidedly and began filling a pipe while he
  watched them.</p>

  <p>"A-course it won't be much trouble to move your shack," Andy continued
  with neighborly interest. "A wheelbarrow will take it, easy. Back here on the
  bench a mile or so, yuh may find a patch of ground that nobody claims."</p>

  <p>"Thanks." The man picked a match from his pocket and striking it on the
  new yellow door-casing lighted his pipe.</p>

  <p>Andy moved uneasily. He did not like that man, for all he appeared so
  thankful for information. The fellow had a narrow forehead and broad, high
  cheek bones and a predatory nose. His eyes were the wrong shade of blue and
  the lids drooped too much at the outer corners. Andy studied him curiously.
  Did the man know what he was up against, or did he not? Was he sincere in his
  ready thanks, or was he sarcastic? The man looked up at him then. His eyes
  were clean of any hidden meaning, but they were the wrong shade of
  blue&mdash;the shade that is opaque and that you feel hides much that should
  be revealed to you.</p>

  <p>"Seems like there's been quite a crop of shacks grown up since I rode over
  this way," Weary announced suddenly, returning from a brief scurry after the
  leaders, that inclined too much toward the south in their travel.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the country's settling up pretty fast," conceded the man in the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"Well, by golly!" bellowed Slim, popping up from below on a heaving horse.
  Slim was getting fatter every year, and his horses always puffed when they
  climbed a hill under his weight. His round eyes glared resentfully at the man
  and the shack and at the three who were sitting there so quietly on their
  horses&mdash;just as if they had ridden up for a friendly call. "Ain't this
  shack on your land?" he spluttered to Andy.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. It is, just right at present." Andy admitted, following the
  man's example in the matter of a smoke, except that Andy rolled and lighted a
  cigarette. "He's going to move it, though."</p>

  <p>"Oh. Thanks." With the one-sided smile.</p>

  <p>"Say, you needn't thank ME," Andy protested in his polite tone. "YOU'RE
  going to move it, you know."</p>

  <p>"You may know, but I don't," corrected the other.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right. You may not know right now, but don't let that
  worry yuh. This is sure a great country for pilgrims to wise up in."</p>

  <p>Big Medicine came up over the hill a hundred feet or so from them, goggled
  a minute at the bold trespass, and came loping across the intervening space.
  "Say, by cripes, what's this mean?" he bawled. "Claim-jumper, hey? Say, young
  feller, do you realize what you're doing&mdash;squattin' down on another
  man's land. Don't yuh know claim-jumpers git shot, out here? Or lynched?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, cut out all that rough stuff!" advised the man wearily. "I know who
  you are, and what your bluff is worth. I know you can't hold a foot of land
  if anybody is a mind to contest your claims. I've filed a contest on this
  eighty, here, and I'm going to hold it. Let that soak into your minds. I
  don't want any trouble&mdash;I'm even willing to take a good deal in the way
  of bluster, rather than have trouble. But I'm going to stay. See?" He waved
  his pipe in a gesture of finality and continued to smoke and to watch them
  impersonally, leaning against the door in that lounging negligence which is
  so irritating to a disputant.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right&mdash;if that's the way you feel about it," Andy replied
  indifferently, and turned away. "Come on, boys&mdash;no use trying to bluff
  that gazabo. He's wise."</p>

  <p>He rode away with his face turned over his shoulder to see if the others
  were going to follow. When he was past the corner and therefore out of the
  man's sight, he raised his arm and beckoned to them imperatively, with a jerk
  of his head to add insistence. The four of them looked after him uncertainly.
  Weary kicked his horse and started, then Pink did the same. Andy beckoned
  again, more emphatically than before, and Big Medicine, who loved a fight as
  he loved to win a jackpot, turned and glared at the man in the doorway as he
  passed. Slim was rumbling by-golly ultimatums in his fat chest when he came
  up.</p>

  <p>"Pink, you go on back and put the boys next, when they come up with the
  drag they won't do anything much but hand out a few remarks and ride on."
  Andy said, in the tone of one who knows exactly what he means to do. "This is
  my claim-jumper. Chances are I've got three more to handle&mdash;or will
  have. Nothing like starting off right. Tell the boys just rag the fellow a
  little and ride on, like we did. Get the cattle up here and set Happy and
  Slim day-herding and the rest of us'll get busy."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't tell for a dollar, would yuh?" Pink asked him with his dimples
  showing.</p>

  <p>"I've got to think it out first," Andy evaded. "I feel all the symptoms of an
  idea. You let me alone a while."</p>

  <p>"Say, yuh going to tell him he's been found out and yuh know his past,"
  began Slim, "like yuh done Dunk? I'll bet, by golly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on off and lay down!" Andy retorted pettishly. "I never worked the
  same one off on you twice, did I? Think I'm getting feeble-minded? It ain't
  hard to put his nibs on the run&mdash;that's dead easy. Trouble is I went and
  hobbled myself. I promised a lady I'd be mild."</p>

  <p>"Mamma!" muttered Weary, his sunny eyes taking in the shack-dotted
  horizon. "Mild!&mdash;and all these jumpers on our hands!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;there's more'n one way to kill a cat," Andy reminded them
  cheerfully. "You go on back and post the boys, Pink, not to get too
  riled."</p>

  <p>He galloped off and left them to say and think what they pleased. He was
  not uneasy over their following his advice or waiting for his plan. For Andy
  Green had risen rapidly to a tacit leadership, since first he told them of
  the coming colony. From being the official Ananias of the outfit, king of all
  joke-makers, chief irritator of the bunch, whose lightest word was suspected
  of hiding some deep meaning and whose most innocent action was analysed, he
  had come to the point where they listened to him and depended upon him to see
  a way out of every difficulty. They would depend upon him now; of that he was
  sure&mdash;therefore they would wait for his plan.</p>

  <p>Strange as it may seem, the Happy Family had not seriously considered the
  possibility of having their claims "jumped" so long as they kept valid their
  legal residence. They had thought that they would be watched and accused of
  collusion with the Flying U, and they intended to be extremely careful. They
  meant to stay upon their claims at least seven months in the year, which the
  law required. They meant to have every blade of grass eaten by their own
  cattle, which would be counted as improving their claims. They meant to give
  a homelike air of permanency to their dwellings. They had already talked over
  a tentative plan of bringing water to their desert claims, and had ridden
  over the bench-land for two days, with the plat at hand for reference, that
  they might be sure of choosing their claims wisely. They had prepared for
  every contingency save the one that had arisen&mdash;which is a common
  experience with us all. They had not expected that their claims would be
  jumped and contests filed so early in the game, as long as they maintained
  their residence.</p>

  <p>However, Andy was not dismayed at the turn of events. It was stimulating
  to the imagination to be brought face to face with an emergency such as this,
  and to feel that one must handle it with strength and diplomacy and a
  mildness of procedure that would find favor in the eyes of a girl.</p>

  <p>He looked across the waving grass to where the four-roomed shack was built
  upon the four corners of four "eighties" so that four women might live
  together and yet be said to live upon their own claims. That was drawing the
  line pretty fine, of course; finer than the Happy Family would have dared to
  draw it. But no one would raise any objection, on account of their being
  women and timid about living alone. Andy smiled sympathetically because the
  four conjunctive corners of the four claims happened to lie upon a bald
  pinnacle bare of grass or shelter or water, even. The shack stood bleakly
  revealed to the four winds&mdash;but also it overlooked the benchland and
  the rolling, half-barren land to the west, which comprised Antelope Coulee
  and Dry Coulee and several other good-for-nothing coulees capable of
  supporting nothing but coyotes and prairie dogs and gophers.</p>

  <p>A mile that way Andy rode, and stopped upon the steep side of a gulch
  which was an arm of Antelope Coulee. He looked down into the gulch, searched
  with his eyes for the stake that marked the southeast corner of the eighty
  lying off in this direction from the shack, and finally saw it fifty yards
  away on a bald patch of adobe.</p>

  <p>He resisted the temptation to ride over and call upon Miss Allen&mdash;the
  resistance made easier by the hour, which was eight o'clock or
  thereabouts&mdash;and rode back to the others very well satisfied with
  himself and his plan.</p>

  <p>He found the whole Happy Family gathered upon the level land just over his
  west line, extolling resentment while they waited his coming. Grinning, he
  told them his plan, and set them grinning also. He gave them certain work to
  be done, and watched them scatter to do his bidding. Then he turned and rode
  away upon business of his own.</p>

  <p>The claim-jumper, watching the bench land through a pair of field glasses,
  saw a herd of cows and calves scattered and feeding contentedly upon the
  young grass a mile or so away. Two men on horseback loitered upon the outer
  fringe of the herd. From a distance hilltop came the staccato sound of
  hammers where an other shack was going up. Cloud shadows slid silently over
  the land, with bright sunlight chasing after. Of the other horsemen who had
  come up the bluff with the cattle, he saw not a sign. So the man yawned and
  went in to his breakfast.</p>

  <p>Many times that day he stood at the corner of his shack with the glasses
  sweeping the bench-land. Toward noon the cattle drifted into a coulee where
  there was water. In a couple of hours they drifted leisurely back upon high
  ground and scattered to their feeding, still watched and tended by the two
  horsemen who looked the most harmless of individuals. One was fat and
  red-faced and spent at least half of his time lying prone upon some slope in
  the shade of his horse. The other was thin and awkward, and slouched in the
  saddle or sat upon the ground with his knees drawn up and his arms clasped
  loosely around them, a cigarette dangling upon his lower lip, himself the
  picture of boredom.</p>

  <p>There was nothing whatever to indicate that events were breeding in that
  peaceful scene, and that adventure was creeping close upon the watcher. He
  went in from his fourth or fifth inspection, and took a nap.</p>

  <p>That night he was awakened by a pounding on the side of the shack where
  was his window. By the time he had reached the middle of the floor&mdash;and
  you could count the time in seconds&mdash;a similar pounding was at the door. He
  tried to open the door and couldn't. He went to the window and could see
  nothing, although the night had not been dark when he went to bed. He
  shouted, and there was no reply; nor could he hear any talking without. His
  name, by the way, was H. J. Owens, though his name does not matter except for
  convenience in mentioning him. Owens, then, lighted a lamp, and almost
  instantly was forced to reach out quickly and save it from toppling, because
  one corner of the shack was lifting, lifting...</p>

  <p>Outside, the Happy Family worked in silence. Before they had left One Man
  Coulee they had known exactly what they were to do, and how to do it. They
  knew who was to nail the hastily constructed shutter over the window. They
  knew who was to fasten the door so that it could not be opened from within.
  They knew also who were to use the crow-bars, who were to roll the skids
  under the shack.</p>

  <p>There were twelve of them&mdash;because Bert Rogers had insisted upon
  helping. In not many more minutes than there were men, they were in their
  saddles, ready to start. The shack lurched forward after the straining
  horses. Once it was fairly started it moved more easily than you might think
  it could do, upon crude runners made of cottonwood logs eight inches or so in
  diameter and long enough for cross pieces bolted in front and rear. The
  horses pulled it easily with the ropes tied to the saddle-horns, just as they
  had many times pulled the roundup wagons across mirey creeks or up steep
  slopes; just as they had many times pulled stubborn cattle or dead
  cattle&mdash;just as they had been trained to pull anything and everything
  their masters chose to attach to their ropes.</p>

  <p>Within, Owens called to them and cursed them. When they had just gained an
  even pace, he emptied his revolver through the four sides of the shack. But
  he did not know where they were, exactly, so that he was compelled to shoot
  at random. And since the five shots seemed to have no effect whatever upon
  the steady progress of the shack, he decided to wait until he could see where
  to aim. There was no use, he reflected, in wasting good ammunition when there
  was a strong probability that he would need it later.</p>

  <p>After a half hour or more of continuous travel, the shack tilted on a
  steep descent. H. J. Owens blew out his lamp and swore when a box came
  sliding against his shins in the dark. The descent continued until it was
  stopped with a jolt that made him bite his tongue painfully, so that tears
  came into the eyes that were the wrong shade of blue to please Andy Green. He
  heard a laugh cut short and a muttered command, and that was all. The shack
  heaved, toppled, righted itself and went on down, and down, and down; jerked
  sidewise to the left, went forward and then swung joltingly the other way.
  When finally it came to a permanent stand it was sitting with an almost level
  floor.</p>

  <p>Then the four corners heaved upward, two at a time, and settled with a
  final squeal of twisted boards and nails. There was a sound of confused
  trampling, and after that the lessening sounds of departure. Mr. Owens tried
  the door again, and found it still fast. He relighted the lamp, carried it to
  the window and looked upon rough boards outside the glass. He meditated
  anxiously and decided to remain quiet until daylight.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family worked hard, that night. Before daylight they were in
  their beds and snoring except the two who guarded the cattle. Each was in his
  own cabin. His horse was in his corral, smooth-coated and dry. There was
  nothing to tell of the night's happenings,&mdash;nothing except the satisfied
  grins on their faces when they woke and remembered.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12">XII. &mdash; SHACKS, LIVE STOCK AND PILGRIMS<br>
  PROMPTLY AND PAINFULLY REMOVED</a></h2><br>

  <p class="verse">"I'm looking rather seedy now, while holding down my
  claim,<br>
  And my grub it isn't always served the best,<br>
  And the mice play shyly round me as I lay me down to rest<br>
  In my little old sod shanty on my claim.<br>
  Oh, the hinges are of leather and the windows have no glass,<br>
  And the roof it lets the howling blizzards in,<br>
  And I hear the hungry kiote as he sneaks up through grass&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Say! have they got down the hill yet, Pink?"</p>
  
  <p>Pink took his cigarette from
  his fingers, leaned and peered cautiously through the grimy window. "Unh-huh.
  They're coming up the flat."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Andy Green, ostentatiously washing his breakfast dishes, skipped
  two or three verses and lifted his voice in song to fit the occasion.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"How I wish that some kind-hearted girl would pity on me
  take,<br>
  And relieve me of the mess that I am in!<br>
  Oh, the angel, how I'd bless her if her home with me she'd make,<br>
  In my little old sod shanty&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Got her yet?" And he craned his neck to look. "Aw, they've pulled up, out
  there, listening!"</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"My clothes are plastered o'er with dough, I'm looking like
  a fright,<br>
  And everything is scattered round the room&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Why don't yuh stop that caterwauling?" Pink demanded fretfully. "You'll
  queer the whole play if you keep it up. They'll swear you're drunk!"</p>

  <p>There was sense in that. Andy finished the line about remaining two happy
  lovers in his little old sod shanty, and went to the door with the dishpan.
  He threw out the water, squeezed the dishrag in one hand and gave the inside
  of the pan a swipe before he appeared to discover that Miss Allen and
  Florence Grace Hallman were riding up to his door. As a matter of fact, he
  had seen them come over the top of the bluff and had long ago guessed who
  they were.</p>

  <p>He met them with a smile of surprised innocence, and invited them inside.
  They refused to come, and even Miss Allen showed a certain reproachful
  coolness toward him. Andy felt hurt at that, but he did not manifest the
  fact. Instead he informed them that it was a fine morning. And were they out
  taking a look around?</p>

  <p>They were. They were looking up the men who had perpetrated the outrage
  last night upon four settlers.</p>

  <p>"Outrage?" Andy tilted the dishpan against the cabin wall, draped the
  dishrag over the handle and went forward, pulling down his sleeves. "What
  outrage is that, Miss Hallman? Anybody killed?"</p>

  <p>Miss Hallman watched him with her narrowed glance. She saw the quick
  glance he gave Miss Allen, and her lids narrowed still more. So that was it!
  But she did not swerve from her purpose, for all this unexpected thrust
  straight to the heart of her self-love.</p>

  <p>"You know that no one was killed. But you damaged enough property to place
  you on the wrong side of the law, Mr. Green. Not one of those shacks can be
  gotten out of the gulch except in pieces!"</p>

  <p>Andy smiled inside his soul, but his face was bewildered; his eyes fixed
  themselves blankly upon her face. "Me? Damaging property? Miss Hallman, you
  don't know me yet! "Which was perfectly true. "What shacks are you talking
  about? In what gulch? All the shacks I've seen so far have been stuck up on
  bald pinnacles where the blizzards will hit 'em coming and going next
  winter." He glanced again at Miss Allen with a certain sympathetic foretaste
  of what she would suffer next winter if she stayed in her shack.</p>

  <p>"Don't try to play innocent, Mr. Green." Florence Grace Hallman drew her
  brows together. "We all know perfectly well who dragged those shacks off the
  claims last night."</p>

  <p>"Don't you mean that you think you know? I'm afraid you've kinda taken it
  for granted I'd be mixed up in any deviltry you happened to hear about. I've
  got in bad with you&mdash;I know that&mdash;but just the same, I hate to be
  accused of everything that takes place in the country. All this is sure
  interesting news to me. Whereabouts was they taken from? And when, and where
  to? Miss Allen, you'll tell me the straight of this, won't you? And I'll get
  my hoss and you'll show me what gulch she's talking about, won't you?"</p>

  <p>Miss Allen puckered her lips into a pout which meant indecision, and
  glanced at Florence Grace Hallman. And Miss Hallman frowned at being shunted
  into the background and referred to as she, and set her teeth into her lower
  lip.</p>

  <p>"Miss Allen prefers to choose her own company," she said with distinct
  rudeness. "Don't try to wheedle her&mdash;you can't do it. And you needn't
  get your horse to ride anywhere with us, Mr. Green. It's useless. I just
  wanted to warn you that nothing like what happened last night will be
  tolerated. We know all about you Flying U men&mdash;you Happy Family." She
  said it as if she were calling them something perfectly disgraceful. "You may
  be just as tough and bad as you please&mdash;you can't frighten anyone into
  leaving the country or into giving up one iota of their rights. I came to you
  because you are undoubtedly the ring-leader of the gang." She accented gang.
  "You ought to be shot for what you did last night. And if you keep on&mdash;"
  She left the contingency to his imagination.</p>

  <p>"Well, if settling up the country means that men are going to be shot for
  going to bed at dark and asleeping till sun-up, all I've got to say is that
  things ain't like they used to be. We were all plumb peaceful here till your
  colony came, Miss Hallman. Why, the sheriff never got out this way often
  enough to know the trails! He always had to ask his way around. If your bunch
  of town mutts can't behave themselves and leave each other alone, I don't
  know what's to be done about it. We ain't hired to keep the peace."</p>

  <p>"No, you've been hired to steal all the land you can and make all the
  trouble you can. We understand that perfectly."</p>

  <p>Andy shook his head in meek denial, and with a sudden impulse turned
  toward the cabin. "Oh, Pink!" he called, and brought that boyish-faced young
  man to the door, his eyes as wide and as pure as the eyes of a child.</p>

  <p>Pink lifted his hat with just the proper degree of confusion to impress
  the girls with his bashfulness and his awe of their presence. His eyes were
  the same pansy-purple as when the Flying U first made tumultuous acquaintance
  with him. His apparent innocence had completely fooled the Happy Family, you
  will remember. They had called him Mamma's Little Lamb and had composed
  poetry and horrific personal history for his benefit. The few years had not
  changed him. His hair was still yellow and curly. The dimples still dodged
  into his cheeks unexpectedly; he was still much like a stick of dynamite
  wrapped in white tissue and tied with a ribbon. He looked an angel of
  innocence, and in reality he was a little devil.</p>

  <p>Andy introduced him, and Pink bowed and had all the appearance of
  blushing&mdash;though you will have to ask Pink how he managed to create that
  optical illusion. "What did you want?" he asked in his soft, girlish voice,
  turning to Andy bashfully. But from the corner of his eye Pink saw that a
  little smile of remembrance had come to soften Miss Hallman's angry features,
  and that the other girl was smiling also. Pink hated that attitude of
  pleasant patronage which women were so apt to take toward him, but for the
  present it suited his purpose to encourage it.</p>

  <p>"Pink, what time was it when we went to bed last night?" Andy asked him in
  the tone of one who wished to eliminate all doubt of his virtue.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;it was pretty early. We didn't light the lamp at all, you
  remember. You went to bed before I did&mdash;we couldn't see the
  cards&mdash;" He stopped confusedly, and again he gave the two women the
  impression that he blushed. "We weren't playing for money," he hurriedly
  explained. "Just for pastime. It's&mdash;pretty
  lonesome&mdash;sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Somebody did something to somebody last night," Andy informed Pink with a
  resentful impatience. "Miss Hallman thinks we're the guilty parties&mdash;me
  in particular, because she don't like me. It's something about some
  shacks&mdash;damaging property, she called it. Just what was it you said was
  done, Miss Hallman?" He turned his honest, gray eyes toward her and met her
  suspicious look steadily.</p>

  <p>Miss Hallman bit her lip. She had been perfectly sure of the guilt of Andy
  Green, and of the others who were his friends. Now, in spite of all reason
  she was not so sure. And there had been nothing more tangible than two pairs
  of innocent-looking eyes and the irreproachable manners of two men to change
  her conviction.</p>

  <p>"Well, I naturally took it for granted that you did it," she weakened.
  "The shacks were moved off eighties that you have filed upon, Mr. Green. Mr.
  Owens told me this morning that you men came by his place and threatened him
  yesterday, and ordered him to move. No one else would have any object in
  molesting him or the others." Her voice hardened again as her mind dwelt upon
  the circumstances. "It must have been you!" she finished sharply.</p>

  <p>Whereupon Pink gave her a distressed look that made Miss Hallman flush
  unmistakably. "I'm just about distracted, this morning," she apologized. "I
  took it upon myself to see these settlers through&mdash;and everybody makes
  it just as hard as possible for me. Why should all you fellows treat us the
  way you do? We&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why, we aren't doing a thing!" Pink protested diffidently. "We thought
  we'd take up some claims and go to ranching for ourselves, when we got
  discharged from the Flying U. We didn't mean any harm&mdash;everybody's
  taking up claims. We've bought some cattle and we're going to try and get
  ahead, like other folks. We&mdash;I wanted to cut out all this
  wildness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are those your cattle up on the hill? Some men shipped in four carloads
  of young stock, yesterday, to Dry Lake. They drove them out here intending to
  turn them on the range, and a couple of men&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Four men," Miss Allen corrected with a furtive twinkle in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Some men refused to let them cross that big coulee back there. They drove
  the cattle back toward Dry Lake, and told Mr. Simmons and Mr. Chase and some
  others that they shouldn't come on this bench back here at all. That was
  another thing I wanted to see you men about."</p>

  <p>"Maybe they were going to mix their stock up with ours," Pink ventured
  mildly.</p>

  <p>"Your men shot, and shot, and shot&mdash;the atmosphere up there is shot
  so full of holes that the wind just whistles through!" Miss Allen informed
  then gravely, with her eyebrows all puckered together and the furtive little
  twinkle in her eyes. "And they yelled so that we could hear them from the
  house! They made those poor cows and those poor, weenty calves just go
  trotting back across the coulee. My new book on farming says you positively
  must not hurry cattle. It&mdash;oh, it does something to the
  butter-fat&mdash;joggles it all up or something&mdash;I'll lend you the book.
  I found the chapter on Proper Treatment of Dairy Stock, and I watched those
  men with the book in my hands. Why, it was terribly unscientific, the way
  they drove those cow-critters!"</p>

  <p>"I'll come over and get the book," Andy promised her, with a look in his
  eyes that displeased Miss Hallman very much. "We're ashamed of our ignorance.
  We'd like to have you learn us what's in the book."</p>

  <p>"I will. And every week&mdash;just think of that! I'm to get a real farm
  paper."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to borrow the paper too," Andy declared instantly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, and&mdash;what's going to be done about all those bullet-holes?
  They&mdash;they might create a draught&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll ride around that way and plug 'em up," Andy assured her solemnly.
  "Whenever you've got time to show me about where they're at."</p>

  <p>"It will be a pleasure. I can tell where they are, but they're too high
  for me to reach. Wherever the wind whistles there's a hole in the atmosphere.
  And there are places where the air just quivers, so you can see it. That is
  the shock those bold, bad men gave it with the words they used.
  They&mdash;used&mdash;words, Mr. Green! If we could scheme some way to pull out
  all those wrinkles&mdash;I do love a nice, clean, smooth atmosphere where I live.
  It's so wrinkly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll attend to all that, right away."</p>

  <p>Miss Hallman decided that she had nothing further to say to Mr. Green. She
  wheeled her horse rather abruptly and rode off with a curt goodbye. Miss
  Allen, being new at the business of handling a horse, took more time in
  pulling her mount around. While her back was turned to Florence Grace and her
  face was turned toward Pink and Andy, she gave them a twinkling glance that
  had one lowered eyelid to it, twisted her lips, and spoke sharply to her
  horse. They might make of it what they would. Florence Grace looked back
  impatiently&mdash;perhaps suspiciously also&mdash;and saw Miss Allen coming
  on with docile haste.</p>

  <p>So that ended the interview which Miss Hallman had meant to be so
  impressive. A lot of nonsense that left a laugh behind and the idea that Miss
  Allen at least did not disapprove of harassing claim-jumpers. Andy Green was
  two hundred per cent. more cheerful after that, and his brain was more active
  and his determination more fixed. For all that he stared after them
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"She winked at us&mdash;if I've got eyes in my head. What do you reckon
  she meant, Pink?" he asked when the two riders had climbed over the ridge.
  "And what she said about the bold, bad men shooting holes that have to be
  plugged up&mdash;and about liking a nice, smooth atmosphere? Do you suppose
  she meant that it's liable to take bold, bad men to clean the atmosphere,
  or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make what she meant? There's jumpers
  left&mdash;two on Bud's place&mdash;and he's oary-eyed over it, and was going
  to read 'em the riot act proper, when I left to come over here. And a couple
  of men drove onto that south eighty of Mig's with a load of lumber, just as I
  come by. Looks to me like we've got our hands full, Andy. There'll be holes
  to plug up somewhere besides in the atmosphere, if you ask me."</p>

  <p>"Long as they don't get anything on us I ain't in the state of mind where
  I give a darn. That little brown-eyed Susan'll keep us posted if they start
  anything new&mdash;what did she mean by that wink, do you reckon?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, don't get softening of the emotions," Pink advised impatiently.
  "That's the worst thing we've got to steer clear of, Andy! All them women in
  the game is going to make it four times as hard to stand 'em off. Irish is
  foolish over this one you're gettin' stuck on&mdash;you'll be fighting each
  other, if you don't look out. That Florence Grace lady ain't so
  slow&mdash;she's going to use the women to keep us fellows guessing.</p>

  <p>Andy sighed. "We can block that play, of course," he said. "Come on, Pink.
  let's go round up the boys and see what's been taking place with them cattle.
  Shipped in four carloads already, have they?" He began pulling on his chaps
  rather hurriedly. "Worst of it is, you can't stampede a bunch of darned tame
  cows, either," he complained.</p>

  <p>They found Irish and the Native Son on day-herd, with the cattle scattered
  well along the western line of the claims. Big Medicine, Weary, Cal Emmett
  and Jack Bates were just returning from driving the settlers' stock well
  across Antelope Coulee which had been decided upon as a hypothetical boundary
  line until such time as a fence could be built.</p>

  <p>They talked with the day-herders, and they talked with the other four.
  Chip came up from the ranch with the Kid riding proudly beside him on Silver,
  and told them that the Honorable Mr. Blake was at the Flying U and had sent
  word that he would be pleased to take the legal end of the fight, if the
  Happy Family so desired. Which was in itself a vast encouragement. The
  Honorable Blake had said that they were well within their rights thus far,
  and advised them to permit service of the contest notices, and to go calmly
  on fulfilling the law. Which was all very well as far as it went, providing
  they were permitted to go on calmly.</p>

  <p>"What about them cattle they're trying to git across our land?" Slim
  wanted to know. "We got a right to keep 'em off, ain't we?"</p>

  <p>Chip said that he thought they had, but to make sure, he would ask the
  Honorable Blake. Trespassing, he said, might be avoided&mdash;</p>

  <p>Right there Andy was seized with an idea. He took Chip&mdash;because of
  his artistic talents which, he said, had been plumb wasted lately&mdash;to
  one side. Afterwards they departed in haste, with Pink and Weary galloping
  close at their heels. In a couple of hours they returned to the boundary
  where the cattle still fed all scattered out in a long line, and behind them
  drove Pink and Weary in the one wagon which the Family possessed.</p>

  <p>"It oughta help some," grinned Andy, when the Native Son came curiously
  over to see what it was they were erecting there on the prairie. "It's a fair
  warning, and shows 'em where to head in at."</p>

  <p>The Native Son read the sign, which was three feet long and stood nailed
  to two posts ready for planting solidly in the earth. He showed his even,
  white teeth in a smile of approval. "Back it up, and it ought to do some
  good," he said.</p>

  <p>They dug holes and set the posts, and drove on to where they meant to
  plant another sign exactly like the first. That day they planted twelve
  sign-boards along their west line. They might not do any good, but they were
  a fair warning and as such were worth the trouble.</p>

  <p>That afternoon Andy was riding back along the line when he saw a rider
  pull up at the first sign and read it carefully. He galloped in haste to the
  spot and found that his suspicions were correct; it was Miss Allen.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said when he came near, "I suppose that means me. Does it?"
  She pointed to the sign, which read like this:</p>

  <p>WARNING ! ! N0 TRESPASSING EAST OF HERE All Shacks, Live-Stock and
  Pilgrims Promptly AND Painfully Removed From These Premises</p>

  <p>"I'm over the line," she notified him, pulling her horse backward a few
  feet. "You're getting awfully particular, seems to me. Oh, did you know that
  a lot of men are going to play it's New Year's Eve and hold watch meetings
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Never heard a word about it," he declared truthfully, and waited for
  more.</p>

  <p>"That's not strange&mdash;seeing it's a surprise party. Still&mdash;I'm
  sure you are expected to&mdash;attend."</p>

  <p>"And where is all this to take place?" Andy looked at her intently,
  smiling a little.</p>

  <p>"Oh, over there&mdash;and there&mdash;and there." She pointed to three new
  shacks&mdash;the official dwellings of certain contestants." Stag parties,
  they are, I believe. But I doubt if they'll have any very exciting time; most
  of these new settlers are too busy getting the ground ready for crops, to go
  to parties. Some people are pretty disgusted, I can tell you, Mr. Green. Some
  people talk about ingratitude and wonder why the colony doesn't hang together
  better. Some people even wonder why it is that folks are interested mainly in
  their own affairs, and decline to attend watch meetings and&mdash;receptions.
  So I'm afraid very few, except your nearest neighbors, will be
  present, after all might I ask when you expect to&mdash;to MOVE again, Mr.
  Green?"</p>

  <p>Smiling still, Andy shook his head. "I expect to be pretty busy this
  spring," he told her evasively. "Aren't any of you ladies invited to those
  parties, Miss Allen?"</p>

  <p>"Not a one. But let me tell you something, Mr. Green. Some folks think that
  perhaps we lady-settlers ought to organize a club for the well-being of our
  intellects. Some folks are trying to get up parties just for women&mdash;see
  the point? They think it would be better for the&mdash;atmosphere."</p>

  <p>"Oh." Andy studied the possibilities of such a move. If Florence Grace
  should set the women after them, he could see how the Happy Family would be
  hampered at every turn. "Well, I must be going. Say, did you know this
  country is full of wild animals, Miss Allen? They prowl around nights. And
  there's a gang of wild men that hang out up there in those
  mountains&mdash;they prowl around nights, too. They're outlaws. They kill off
  every sheriff's party that tries to round them up, and they kidnap children
  and ladies. If you should hear any disturbance, any time, don't be scared.
  Just stay inside after dark and keep your door locked. And if you should
  organize that ladies' club, you better hold your meetings in the afternoon,
  don't you think?"</p>

  <p>When he had ridden on and left her, Andy was somewhat ashamed of such
  puerile falsehoods. But then, she had started the allegorical method of
  imparting advice, he remembered. So presently went whistling to round up the
  boys and tell them what he had learned.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13">XIII. &mdash; IRISH WORKS FOR THE CAUSE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Big Medicine, with Weary and Chip to bear him company, rode
  up to the shack nearest his own, which had been hastily built by a raw-boned
  Dane who might be called truly Americanized. Big Medicine did not waste time
  in superfluities or in making threats of what he meant to do. He called the
  Dane to the door&mdash;claim-jumpers were keeping close to their cabins,
  these days&mdash;and told him that he was on another man's land, and asked
  him if he meant to move.</p>

  <p>"Sure I don't intend to move!" retorted the Dane with praiseworthy
  promptness. "I'm going to hold 'er down solid."</p>

  <p>"Yuh hear what he says, boys." Big Medicine turned to his companions "He
  ain't going to git off'n my land, he says. Weary, yuh better go tell the
  bunch I need 'em."</p>

  <p>Weary immediately departed. He was not gone so very long, and when he
  returned the Happy Family was with him, even to Patsy who drove the wagon
  with all the ease of a veteran of many roundups. The Dane tried bluster, but
  that did not seem to work. Nothing seemed to work, except the Happy
  Family.</p>

  <p>There in broad daylight, with no more words than were needful, they moved
  the Dane, and his shack. When they began to raise the building he was so
  unwise as to flourish a gun, and thereby made it perfectly right and lawful
  that Big Medicine should take the gun away from him and march him ahead of
  his own forty-five.</p>

  <p>They took the shack directly past one of the trespassing signs, and Big
  Medicine stopped accommodatingly while the Dane was permitted to read the
  sign three times aloud. That the Dane did not seem truly appreciative of the
  privilege was no fault of Big Medicine's, surely. They went on, skidding the
  little building sledlike over the uneven prairie. They took it down into
  Antelope Coulee and left it there, right side up and with not even a pane of
  glass broken in the window.</p>

  <p>"There, darn yuh, live there awhile!" Andy gritted to when the timbers
  were withdrawn from beneath the cabin and they were ready to leave. "You
  can't say we damaged your property&mdash;this time. Come back, and there's no
  telling what we're liable to do."</p>

  <p>Since Big Medicine kept his gun, the Dane could do nothing but swear while
  he watched them ride up the hill and out of sight.</p>

  <p>They made straight for the next interloper, remarking frequently that it
  was much simpler and easier to do their moving in daylight. There they had an
  audience, for Florence Grace rode furiously up just as they were getting
  under way. The Happy Family spoke very nicely to Florence Grace, and when she
  spoke very sharply to them they were discreetly hard of hearing and became
  absorbed in their work.</p>

  <p>Several settlers came before that shack was moved, but they only stood
  around and talked among themselves, and were careful not to get in the way or
  to hinder, and to lower their voices so that the Happy Family need not hear
  unless they chose to listen.</p>

  <p>So they slid that shack into the coulee, righted it carefully and left it
  there&mdash;where it would be exceedingly difficult to get it out, by the
  way; since it is much easier to drag a building down hill than up, and the
  steeper the hill and the higher, the greater the difference.</p>

  <p>They loaded the timbers into the wagon and methodically on to the next
  shack, their audience increased to a couple of dozen perturbed settlers. The
  owner of this particular shack, feeling the strength of numbers behind him,
  was disposed to argue the point.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll sweat for this!" he shouted impotently when the Happy Family
  was placing the timbers.</p>

  <p>"Ah, git outa the way!" said Andy, coming toward him with a crowbar.
  "We're sweating now, if that makes yuh feel any better."</p>

  <p>The man got out of the way, and went and stood with the group of
  onlookers, and talked vaguely of having the law on them&mdash;whatever he
  meant by that.</p>

  <p>By the time they had placed the third shack in the bottom of the coulee,
  the sun was setting. They dragged the timbers up the steep bluff with their
  ropes and their saddle-horses, loaded them on to the wagon and threw the
  crowbars and rolling timbers in, and turned to look curiously and unashamed
  at their audience. Andy, still tacitly their leader, rode a few steps
  forward.</p>

  <p>"That'll be all today," he announced politely. "Except that load of lumber
  back here on the bench where it don't belong&mdash;we aim to haul that over
  the line. Seeing your considerable interest in our affairs, I'll just say
  that we filed on our claims according to law, and we're living on 'em
  according to law. Till somebody proves in court that we're not, there don't
  any shack, or any stock, stay on our side the line any longer than it takes
  to get them off. There's the signs, folks&mdash;read 'em and take 'em to
  heart. You can go home now. The show's over."</p>

  <p>He lifted his hat to the women&mdash;and there were several now&mdash;and
  went away to join his fellows, who had ridden on slowly till he might
  overtake them. He found Happy Jack grumbling and predicting evil, as it was
  his nature to do, but he merely straightened his aching back and laughed at
  the prophecies.</p>

  <p>"As I told you before, there's more than one way to kill a cat," he
  asserted tritely but never the less impressively. "Nobody can say we wasn't
  mild; and nobody can say we hadn't a right to get those chickencoops off our
  land. If you ask me, Florence Grace will have to go some now if she gets the
  best of the deal. She overlooked a bet. We haven't been served with any
  contest notices yet, and so we ain't obliged to take their say-so. Who's
  going to stand guard tonight? We've got to stand our regular shifts, if we
  want to keep ahead of the game. I'm willing to be It. I'd like to make sure
  they don't slip any stock across before daylight."</p>

  <p>"Say, it's lucky we've got a bunch of boneheads like them to handle," Pink
  observed thankfully. "Would a bunch of natives have stood around like that
  with their hands in their pockets and let us get away with the moving job?
  Not so you could notice!"</p>

  <p>"What we'd better do," cut in the Native Son without any misleading drawl,
  "is try and rustle enough money to build that fence."</p>

  <p>"That's right," assented Cal. "Maybe the Old Man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We don't go to the Old Man for so much as a bacon rind!" cried the Native
  Son impatiently. "Get it into your systems, boys, that we've got to ride away
  around the Flying U. We ought to be able to build that fence, all right,
  without help from anybody. Till we do we've got to hang and rattle, and keep
  that nester stock from getting past us. I'll stand guard till midnight."</p>

  <p>A little more talk, and some bickering with Slim and Happy Jack, the two
  chronic kickers, served to knock together a fair working organization. Weary
  and Andy Green were informally chosen joint leaders, because Weary could be
  depended upon to furnish the mental ballast for Andy's imagination. Patsy was
  told that he would have to cook for the outfit, since he was too fat to ride.
  They suggested that he begin at once, by knocking together some sort of
  supper. Moving houses, they declared, was work. They frankly hoped that they
  would not have to move many more&mdash;and they were very positive that they
  would not be compelled to move the same shack twice, at any rate.</p>

  <p>"Say, we'll have quite a collection of shacks down in Antelope Coulee if
  we keep on," Jack Bates reminded them. "Wonder where they'll get water?"</p>

  <p>"Where's the rest of them going to get water?" Cal Emmett challenged the
  crowd. "There's that spring the four women up here pack water from&mdash;but
  that goes dry in August. And there's the creek&mdash;that goes dry too. On
  the dead, I feel sorry for the women&mdash;and so does Irish," he added
  dryly.</p>

  <p>Irish made an uncivil retort and swung suddenly away from the group. "I'm
  going to ride into town, boys," he announced curtly. "I'll be back in the
  morning and go on day-herd."</p>

  <p>"Maybe you will and maybe you won't," Weary amended somewhat impatiently.
  "This is certainly a poor time for Irish to break out," he added, watching
  his double go galloping toward the town road.</p>

  <p>"I betche he comes back full and tries to clean out all them nesters,"
  Happy Jack predicted. For once no one tried to combat his pessimism&mdash;for
  that was exactly what every one of them believed would happen.</p>

  <p>"He's stayed sober a long while&mdash;for him," sighed Weary, who never
  could quite shake off a sense of responsibility for the moral defections of
  his kinsman. "Maybe I better go along and ride herd on him." Still, he did
  not go, and Irish presently merged into the dusky distance.</p>

  <p>As is often the case with a family's black sheep, his intentions were the
  best, even though they might have been considered unorthodox. While the Happy
  Family took it for granted that he was gone because an old thirst awoke
  within him, Irish was thinking only of the welfare of the outfit. He did not
  tell them, because he was the sort who does not prattle of his intentions,
  one way or the other. If he did what he meant to do there would be time
  enough to explain; if he failed there was nothing to be said.</p>

  <p>Irish had thought a good deal about the building of that fence, and about
  the problem of paying for enough wire and posts to run the fence straight
  through from Meeker's south line to the north line of the Flying U. He had
  figured the price of posts and the price of wire and had come somewhere near
  the approximate cost of the undertaking. He was not at all sure that the
  Happy Family had faced the actual figures on that proposition. They had
  remarked vaguely that it was going to cost some money. They had made casual
  remarks about being broke personally and, so far as they knew,
  permanently.</p>

  <p>Irish was hot-headed and impulsive to a degree. He was given to occasional
  tumultuous sprees, during which he was to be handled with extreme
  care&mdash;or, better still, left entirely alone until the spell was over. He
  looked almost exactly like Weary, and yet he was almost his opposite in
  disposition. Weary was optimistic, peace-loving, steady as the sun above him
  except for a little surface-bubbling of fun that kept him sunny through storm
  and calm. You could walk all over Weary&mdash;figuratively
  speaking&mdash;before he would show resentment. You could not step very close
  to Irish without running the risk of consequences. That he should, under all
  that, have a streak of calculating, hard-headed business sense, did not occur
  to them.</p>

  <p>They rode on, discussing the present situation and how best to meet it;
  the contingencies of the future, and how best to circumvent the active
  antagonism of Florence Grace Hallman and the colony for which she stood
  sponsor. They did not dream that Irish was giving his whole mind to solving
  the problem of raising money to build that fence, but that is exactly what he
  was doing.</p>

  <p>Some of you at least are going to object to his method. Some of
  you&mdash;those of you who live west of the big river&mdash;are going to
  understand his point of view, and you will recognize his method as being
  perfectly logical, simple, and altogether natural to a man of his temperament
  and manner of life. It is for you that I am going to relate his experiences.
  Sheltered readers, readers who have never faced life in the raw, readers who
  sit down on Sunday mornings with a mind purged of worldly thoughts and commit
  to memory a "golden text" which they forget before another Sunday morning,
  should skip the rest of this chapter for the good of their morals. The rest
  is for you men who have kicked up alkali dust and afterwards washed out the
  memory in town; who have gone broke between starlight and sun; who know the
  ways of punchers the West over, and can at least sympathize with Irish in
  what he meant to do that night.</p>

  <p>Irish had been easing down a corner of the last shack, with his back
  turned toward three men who stood looking on with the detached interest which
  proved they did not own this particular shack. One was H. J. Owens&mdash;I
  don't think you have met the others. Irish had not. He had overheard this
  scrap of conversation while he worked:</p>

  <p>"Going to town tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Guess so&mdash;I sure ain't going to hang out on this prairie any more
  than I have to. You going?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es&mdash;I think I will. I hear there's been some pretty swift games
  going, the last night or two. A fellow in that last bunch Florence rounded up
  made quite a clean up last night."</p>

  <p>"That so? Let's go on in. This claim-holding gets my goat anyway. I don't
  see where&mdash;"</p>

  <p>That was all Irish heard, but that was enough.</p>

  <p>Had he turned in time to catch the wink that one speaker gave to the
  other, and the sardonic grin that answered the lowered eyelid, he would have
  had the scrap of conversation properly focused in his mind, and would not
  have swallowed the bait as greedily as he did. But we all make mistakes.
  Irish made the mistake of underestimating the cunning of his enemies.</p>

  <p>So here he was, kicking up the dust on the town trail just as those three
  intended that he should do. But that he rode alone instead of in the midst of
  his fellows was not what the three had intended; and that he rode with the
  interest of his friends foremost in his mind was also an unforeseen element
  in the scheme.</p>

  <p>Irish did not see H. J. Owens anywhere in town&mdash;nor did he see either
  of the two men who had stood behind him. But there was a poker game running
  in Rusty Brown's back room, and Irish immediately sat in without further
  investigation. Bert Rogers was standing behind one of the players, and gave
  Irish a nod and a wink which may have had many meanings. Irish interpreted it
  as encouragement to sail in and clean up the bunch.</p>

  <p>There was money enough in sight to build that fence when he sat down.
  Irish pulled his hat farther over his eyebrows, rolled and lighted a
  cigarette while he waited for that particular jackpot to be taken, and
  covertly sized up the players.</p>

  <p>Every one of them was strange to him. But then, the town was full of
  strangers since Florence Grace and her Syndicate began to reap a harvest off
  the open country, so Irish merely studied the faces casually, as a matter of
  habit. They were nesters, of course&mdash;real or prospective. They seemed to
  have plenty of money&mdash;and it was eminently fitting that the Happy
  Family's fence should be built with nester money.</p>

  <p>Irish had in his pockets exactly eighteen dollars and fifty-cents. He
  bought eighteen dollars' worth of chips and began to play. Privately he
  preferred stud poker to draw, but he was not going to propose a change; he
  felt perfectly qualified to beat any three pilgrims that ever came West.</p>

  <p>Four hands he played and lost four dollars. He drank a glass of beer then,
  made himself another cigarette and settled down to business, feeling that he
  had but just begun. After the fifth hand he looked up and caught again the
  eye of Bert Rogers. Bert pulled his eyebrows together in a warning look, and
  Irish thought better of staying that hand. He did not look at Bert after
  that, but he did watch the other players more closely.</p>

  <p>After awhile Bert wandered away, his interest dulling when he saw that
  Irish was holding his own and a little better. Irish played on, conservative
  to such a degree that in two hours he had not won more than fifteen dollars.
  The Happy Family would have been surprised to see him lay down kings and
  refuse to draw to them which he did once, with a gesture of disgust that
  flipped them face up so that all could see. He turned them over immediately,
  but the three had seen that this tall stranger, who had all the earmarks of a
  cowpuncher, would not draw to kings but must have something better before he
  would stay.</p>

  <p>So they played until the crowd thinned; until Irish, by betting safely and
  sticking to a caution that must have cost him a good deal in the way of
  self-restraint, had sixty dollars' worth of chips piled in front of him.</p>

  <p>Some men, playing for a definite purpose, would have quit at that. Irish
  did not quit, however. He wanted a certain sum from these nesters. He had
  come to town expecting to win a certain sum from them. He intended to play
  until he got it or went broke. He was not using any trickery&mdash;and he had
  stopped one man in the middle of a deal, with a certain look in his eye
  remarking that he'd rather have the top card than the bottom one, so that he
  was satisfied they were not trying to cheat.</p>

  <p>There came a deal when Irish looked at his cards, sent a slanting look at
  the others and laid down his five cards with a long breath. He raised the
  ante four blue ones and rolled and lit a cigarette while the three had drawn
  what cards they thought they needed. The man at Irish's left had drawn only
  one card. Now he hesitated and then bet with some assurance. Irish smoked
  imperturbably while the other two came in, and then he raised the bet three
  stacks of blues. His neighbor raised him one stack, and the next man
  hesitated and then laid down his cards. The third man meditated for a minute
  and raised the bet ten dollars. Irish blew forth a leisurely smoke wreath and
  with a sweep of his hand sent in all his chips.</p>

  <p>There was a silent minute, wherein Irish smoked and drummed absently upon
  the table with his fingers that were free. His neighbor frowned, grunted and
  threw down his hand. The third man did the same. Irish made another sweep of
  his hand and raked the table clean of chips.</p>

  <p>"That'll do for tonight," he remarked dryly. "I don't like to be a
  hog."</p>

  <p>Had that ended the incident, sensitive readers might still read and think
  well of Irish. But one of the players was not quite sober, and he was a poor
  loser and a pugnacious individual anyway, with a square face and a thick neck
  that went straight up to the top of his head. His underlip pushed out, and
  when Irish turned away, to cash in his chips, this pugnacious one reached
  over and took a look at the cards Irish had held.</p>

  <p>It certainly was as rotten a hand as a man could hold. Suits all mixed,
  and not a face card or a pair in the lot. The pugnacious player had held a
  king high straight, and he had stayed until Irish sent in all his chips. He
  gave a bellow and jumped up and hit Irish a glancing blow back of the ear.
  Let us not go into details. You know Irish&mdash;or you should know him by
  this time. A man who will get away with a bluff like that should be left
  alone or brained in the beginning of the fight&mdash;especially when he can
  look down on the hair of a six-foot man, and has muscles hardened by outdoor
  living. When the dust settled, two chairs were broken and some glasses swept
  off the bar by heaving bodies, and two of the three players had forgotten
  their troubles. The third was trying to find the knob on the back door, and
  could not because of the buzzing in his head and the blood in his eyes. Irish
  had welts and two broken knuckles and a clear conscience, and he was so mad
  he almost wound up by thrashing Rusty, who had stayed behind the bar and
  taken no hand in the fight. Rusty complained because of the damage to his
  property, and Irish, being the only one present in a condition to listen,
  took the complaint as a personal insult.</p>

  <p>He counted his money to make sure he had it all, evened the edges of the
  package of bank notes and thrust the package into his pocket. If Rusty had
  kept his face closed about those few glasses and those chairs, he would have
  left a "bill" on the bar to pay for them, even though he did need every cent
  of that money. He told Rusty this, and he accused him of standing in with the
  nesters and turning down the men who had helped him make money all these
  years.</p>

  <p>"Why, darn your soul, I've spent money enough over this bar to buy out the
  whole damn joint, and you know it!" he cried indignantly. "If you think
  you've got to collect damages, take it outa these blinkety-blink pilgrims you
  think so much of. Speak to 'em pleasant, though, or you're liable to lose the
  price of a beer, maybe! They'll never bring you the money we've brought you,
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"They won't because you've likely killed 'em both," Rusty retorted
  angrily. "You want to remember you can't come into town and rip things up the
  back the way you used to, and nobody say a word. You better drift, before
  that feller that went out comes back with an officer. You can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Officer be damned!" retorted Irish, unawed.</p>

  <p>He went out while Rusty was deciding to order him out, and started for the
  stable. Halfway there he ducked into the shadow of the blacksmith shop and
  watched two men go up the street to Rusty's place, walking quickly. He went
  on then, got his horse hurriedly without waiting to cinch the saddle, led him
  behind the blacksmith shop where he would not be likely to be found, and tied
  him there to the wreck of a freight wagon.</p>

  <p>Then he went across lots to where Fred Wilson, manager of the general
  store, slept in a two-room shack belonging to the hotel. The door was
  locked&mdash;Fred being a small man with little trust in Providence or in his
  overt physical prowess&mdash;and so he rapped cautiously upon the window
  until Fred awoke and wanted to know who in thunder was there.</p>

  <p>Irish told his name, and presently went inside. "I'm pulling outa town,
  Fred," he explained, "and I don't know when I'll be in again. So I want you
  to take an order for some posts and bob wire and staples. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you come to the store?" Fred very naturally demanded, peevish
  at being wakened at three o'clock in the morning. "I saw you in town when I
  closed up."</p>

  <p>"I was busy. Crawl back into bed and cover up, while I give you the order.
  I'll want a receipt for the money, too&mdash;I'm paying in advance, so you
  won't have any excuse for holding up the order. Got any thing to write
  on?"</p>

  <p>Fred found part of an order pad and a pencil, and crept shivering into his
  bed. The offer to pay in advance had silenced his grumbling, as Irish
  expected it would. So Irish gave the order&mdash;thirteen hundred cedar
  posts, I remember&mdash;I don't know just how much wire, but all he would
  need.</p>

  <p>"Holy Macintosh! Is this for YOU?" Fred wanted to know as he wrote it
  down.</p>

  <p>"Some of it. We're fencing our claims. If I don't come after the stuff
  myself, let any of the boys have it that shows up. And get it here as quick
  as you can&mdash;what you ain't got on hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Fred was scratching his jaw meditatively with the pencil, and staring at
  the order. "I can just about fill that order outa stock on hand," he told
  Irish. "When all this land rush started I laid in a big supply of posts and
  wire. First thing they'd want, after they got their shacks up. How you making
  it, out there?"</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Irish cheerfully, feeling his broken knuckles. "How much is
  all that going to cost? You oughta make us a rate on it, seeing it's a cash
  sale, and big."</p>

  <p>"I will." Fred tore out a sheet and did some mysterious figuring,
  afterwards crumpling the paper into a little wad and hipping it behind the
  bed. "This has got to be on the quiet, Irish. I can't sell wire and posts to
  those eastern marks at this rate, you know. This is just for you
  boys&mdash;and the profit for us is trimmed right down to a whisper." He
  named the sum total with the air of one who confers a great favor.</p>

  <p>Irish grinned and reached into his pocket. "You musta knocked your profit
  down to fifty percent.," he fleered. "But it's a go with me." He peeled off
  the whole roll, just about. He had two twenties left in his hand when he
  stopped. He was very methodical that night. He took a receipt for the money
  before he left and he looked at it with glistening eyes before he folded it
  with the money. "Don't sell any posts and wire till our order's filled,
  Fred," he warned. "We'll begin hauling right away, and we'll want it
  all."</p>

  <p>He let himself out into the cool starlight, walked in the shadows to where
  he had left his horse, mounted and rode whistling away down the lane which
  ended where the hills began.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14">XIV. &mdash; JUST ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A gray clarity of the air told that daylight was near. The
  skyline retreated, the hills came out of the duskiness like a photograph in
  the developer tray. Irish dipped down the steep slope into Antelope Coulee,
  cursing the sprinkle of new shacks that stood stark in the dawn on every
  ridge and every hilltop, look where one might. He loped along the winding
  trail through the coulee's bottom and climbed the hill beyond. At the top he
  glanced across the more level upland to the east and his eyes lightened. Far
  away stood a shack&mdash;Patsy's, that was. Beyond that another, and yet
  another. Most of the boys had built in the coulees where was water. They did
  not care so much about the view&mdash;over which Miss Allen had grown
  enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>He pulled up in a certain place near the brow of the hill, and looked down
  into the narrower gulch where huddled the shacks they had moved. He grinned
  at the sight. His hand went involuntarily to his pocket and the grin widened.
  He hurried on that he might the sooner tell the boys of their good luck; all
  the material for that line fence bought and paid for&mdash;they would
  certainly laugh when they heard where the money had come from!</p>

  <p>First he thought that he would locate the cattle and tell his news to the
  boys on guard. He therefore left the trail and rode up on a ridge from which
  he could overlook the whole benchland, with the exception of certain gulches
  that cut through. The sky was reddening now, save where banked clouds turned
  purple. A breeze crept over the grass and carried the fresh odor of rain.
  Close beside him a little brown bird chittered briskly and flew away into the
  dawn.</p>

  <p>He looked away to where the Bear Paws humped, blue-black against the sky,
  the top of Old Baldy blushing faintly under the first sun rays. He looked
  past Wolf Butte, where the land was blackened with outcroppings of rock. His
  eyes came back leisurely to the claim country. A faint surprise widened his
  lids, and he turned and sent a glance sweeping to the right, toward Flying U
  Coulee. He frowned, and studied the bench land carefully.</p>

  <p>This was daybreak, when the cattle should be getting out for their
  breakfast-feed. They should be scattered along the level just before him. And
  there were no cattle anywhere in sight. Neither were there any riders in
  sight. Irish gave a puzzled grunt and turned in his saddle, looking back
  toward Dry Lake. That way, the land was more broken, and he could not see so
  far. But as far as he could see there were no cattle that way either. Last
  night when he rode to town the cattle of the colonists had been feeding on
  the long slope three or four miles from where he stood, across Antelope
  Coulee where he had helped the boys drive them.</p>

  <p>He did not waste many minutes studying the empty prairie from the vantage
  point of that ridge, however. The keynote of Irish's nature was action. He
  sent his horse down the southern slope to the level, and began looking for
  tracks, which is the range man's guide-book. He was not long in finding a
  broad trail, in the grass where cattle had lately crossed the coulee from the
  west. He knew what that meant, and he swore when he saw how the trail pointed
  straight to the east&mdash;to the broken, open country beyond One Man Coulee.
  What had the boys been thinking of, to let that nester stock get past them in
  the night? What had the line-riders been doing? They were supposed to guard
  against just such a move as this.</p>

  <p>Irish was sore from his fight in town, and he had not had much sleep
  during the past forty-eight hours, and he was ravenously hungry. He followed
  the trail of the cattle until he saw that they certainly had gotten across
  the Happy Family claims and into the rough country beyond; then he turned and
  rode over to Patsy's shack, where a blue smoke column wobbled up to the
  fitful air-current that seized it and sent it flying toward the
  mountains.</p>

  <p>There he learned that Dry Lake had not hugged to itself all the events of
  the night. Patsy, smoking a pipe full of Durham while he waited for the
  teakettle to boil, was wild with resentment. In the night, while he slept,
  something had heaved his cabin up at one corner. In a minute another corner
  heaved upward a foot or more. Patsy had yelled while he felt around in the
  darkness for his clothes, and had got no answer, save other heavings from
  below.</p>

  <p>Patsy was not the man to submit tamely to such indignities. He had groped
  and found his old 45-70 rifle, that made a noise like a young cannon and
  kicked like a broncho cow. While the shack lurched this way and that, Patsy
  pointed the gun toward the greatest disturbance and fired. He did not think
  he hit anybody, but he apologized to Irish for missing and blamed the
  darkness for the misfortune. Py cosh, he sure tried&mdash;witness the bullet
  holes which he had bored through the four sides of the shack; he besought
  Irish to count them, which Irish did gravely. And what happened then?</p>

  <p>Then? Why, then the Happy Family had come; or at least all those who had
  been awake and riding the prairie had come pounding up out of the dark, their
  horses running like rabbits, their blood singing the song of battle. They had
  grappled with certain of the enemy&mdash;Patsy broke open the door and saw
  tangles of struggling forms in the faint starlight. The Happy Family were not
  the type of men who must settle every argument with a gun, remember. Not
  while their hands might be used to fight with. Patsy thought that they licked
  the nesters without much trouble. He knew that the settlers ran, and that the
  Happy Family chased them clear across the line and then came back and let the
  shack down where it belonged upon the rock underpining.</p>

  <p>"Und py cosh! Dey vould move my shack off'n my land!" he grunted ragefully
  as he lived over the memory.</p>

  <p>Irish went to the door and looked out. The wind had risen in the last half
  hour, so that his hat went sailing against the rear wall, but he did not
  notice that. He was wondering why the settlers had made this night move
  against Patsy. Was it an attempt to irritate the boys to some real act of
  violence&mdash;something that would put them in fear of the law? Or was it simply
  a stratagem to call off the night-guard so that they might slip their cattle
  across into the breaks? They must have counted on some disturbance which
  would reach the ears of the boys on guard. If Patsy had not begun the
  bombardment with his old rifle, they would very likely have fired a few shots
  themselves&mdash;enough to attract attention. With that end in view, he could
  see why Patsy's shack had been chosen for the attack. Patsy's shack was the
  closest to where they had been holding the cattle. It was absurdly simple,
  and evidently the ruse had worked to perfection.</p>

  <p>"Where are the boys at now?" he asked abruptly, turning to Patsy who had
  risen and knocked the ashes from his pipe and was slicing bacon.</p>

  <p>"Gone after the cattle. Dey stampede alreatty mit all der noise," Patsy
  growled, with his back to Irish.</p>

  <p>So it was just as Irish had suspected. He faced the west and the gathering
  bank of "thunder heads" that rode swift on the wind and muttered sullenly as
  they rode, and he hesitated. Should he go after the boys and help them round
  up the stock and drive it back, or should he stay where he was and watch the
  claims? There was that fence&mdash;he must see to that, too.</p>

  <p>He turned and asked Patsy if all the boys were gone. But Patsy did not
  know.</p>

  <p>Irish stood in the doorway until breakfast was ready whereupon he sat down
  and ate hurriedly&mdash;as much from habit as from any present need of haste.
  A gust of wind made the flimsy cabin shake, and Patsy went to close the door
  against its sudden fury.</p>

  <p>"Some riders iss coming now," he said, and held the door half closed
  against the wind. "It ain't none of der boys," he added, with the certainty
  which came of his having watched, times without number, while the various
  members of the Happy Family rode in from the far horizons to camp. "Pilgrims,
  I guess&mdash;from der ridin'."</p>

  <p>Irish grunted and reached for the coffee pot, giving scarce a thought to
  Patsy's announcement. While he poured his third cup of coffee he made a
  sudden decision. He would get that fence off his mind, anyway.</p>

  <p>"Say, Patsy, I've rustled wire and posts&mdash;all we'll need. I guess
  I'll just turn this receipt over to you and let you get busy. You take the
  team and drive in today and get the stuff headed out here pronto. The nesters
  are shipping in more stock&mdash;I heard in town that they're bringing in all
  they can rustle, thinkin' the stock will pay big money while the claims are
  getting ready to produce. I heard a couple of marks telling each other just
  how it was going to work out so as to put 'em all on Easy Street&mdash;the
  darned chumps! Free grass&mdash;that's what they harped on; feed don't cost
  anything. All yuh do is turn 'em loose and wait till shippin' season, and
  then collect. That's what they were talking.</p>

  <p>"The sooner that fence is up the better. We can't put in the whole summer
  hazing their cattle around. I've bought the stuff and paid for it. And here's
  forty dollars you can use to hire it hauled out here. Us fellows have got to
  keep cases on the cattle, so you 'tend to this fence." He laid the money and
  Fred's receipt upon the table and set Patsy's plate over them to hold them
  safe against the wind that rattled the shack. He had forgotten all about the
  three approaching riders, until Patsy turned upon him sharply.</p>

  <p>"Vot schrapes you been into now?" he demanded querulously. "Py cosh you
  done somet'ings. It's der conshtable comin' alreatty. I bet you be
  pinched."</p>

  <p>"I bet I don't," Irish retorted, and made for the one window, which looked
  toward the hills. "Feed 'em some breakfast, Patsy. And you drive in and tend
  to that fencing right away, like I told you."</p>

  <p>He threw one long leg over the window sill, bent his lean body to pass
  through the square opening, and drew the other leg outside. He startled his
  horse, which had walked around there out of the wind, but he caught the
  bridle-reins and led him a few steps farther where he would be out of the
  direct view from the window. Then he stopped and listened.</p>

  <p>He heard the three ride up to the other side of the shack and shout to
  Patsy. He heard Patsy moving about inside, and after a brief delay open the
  door. He heard the constable ask Patsy if he knew anything about Irish, and
  where he could be found; and he heard Patsy declare that he had enough to do
  without keeping track of that boneheaded cowpuncher who was good for nothing
  but to fight and get into schrapes.</p>

  <p>After that he heard Patsy ask the constable if they had had any breakfast
  before leaving town. He heard certain saddle-sounds which told of their
  dismounting in response to the tacit invitation. And then, pulling his hat
  firmly down upon his head, Irish led his horse quietly down into a hollow
  behind the shack, and so out of sight and hearing of those three who sought
  him.</p>

  <p>He did not believe that he was wanted for anything very serious; they
  meant to arrest him, probably, for laying out those two gamblers with a chair
  and a bottle of whisky respectively. A trumped-up charge, very likely,
  chiefly calculated to make him some trouble and to eliminate him from the
  struggle for a time. Irish did not worry at all over their reason for wanting
  him, but he did not intend to let them come close enough to state their
  errand, because he did not want to become guilty of resisting an
  officer&mdash;which would be much worse than fighting nesters with fists and
  chairs and bottles and things.</p>

  <p>In the hollow he mounted and rode down the depression and debouched upon
  the wide, grassy coulee where lay a part of his own claim. He was not sure of
  the intentions of that constable, but he took it for granted that he would
  presently ride on to Irish's cabin in search of him; also that he would look
  for him further, and possibly with a good deal of persistence; which would be
  a nuisance and would in a measure hamper the movements and therefore the
  usefulness of Irish. For that reason he was resolved to take no chance that
  could be avoided.</p>

  <p>The sun slid behind the scurrying forerunners of the storm and struggled
  unavailingly to shine through upon the prairie land. From where he was Irish
  could not see the full extent of the storm-clouds, and while he had been on
  high land he had been too absorbed in other matters to pay much attention.
  Even now he did no more than glance up casually at the inky mass above him,
  and decided that he would do well to ride on to his cabin and get his
  slicker.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached his shack the storm was beating up against the wind
  which had turned unexpectedly to the northeast. Mutterings of thunder grew to
  sharper booming. It was the first real thunderstorm of the season, but it was
  going to be a hard one, if looks meant anything. Irish went in and got his
  slicker and put it on, and then hesitated over riding on in search of the
  cattle and the men in pursuit of them.</p>

  <p>Still, the constable might take a notion to ride over this way in spite of
  the storm. And if he came there would be delay, even if there were nothing
  worse. So Irish, being one to fight but never to stand idle, mounted again
  and turned his long-suffering horse down the coulee as the storm swept
  up.</p>

  <p>First a few large drops of rain pattered upon the earth and left blobs of
  wet where they fell. His horse shook its head impatiently and went sidling
  forward until an admonitory kick from Irish sent him straight down the dim
  trail. Then the clouds opened recklessly the headgates and let the rain down
  in one solid rush of water that sluiced the hillsides and drove muddy
  torrents down channels that had been dry since the snow left.</p>

  <p>Irish bent his head so that his hat shielded somewhat his face, and rode
  doggedly on. It was not the first time that he had been out in a smashing,
  driving thunderstorm, and it would not be his last if his life went on
  logically as he had planned it. But it was not the more comfortable because
  it was an oft-repeated experience. And when the first fury had passed and
  still it rained steadily and with no promise of a let-up, his optimism
  suffered appreciably.</p>

  <p>His luck in town no longer cheered him. He began to feel the loss of sleep
  and the bone-weariness of his fight and the long ride afterwards. His
  breakfast was the one bright spot, and saved him from the gnawing discomfort
  of an empty stomach&mdash;at first.</p>

  <p>He went into One Man Coulee and followed it to the arm that would lead to
  the rolling, ridgy open land beyond, where the "breaks" of the Badlands
  reached out to meet the prairie. He came across the track of the herd, and
  followed it to the plain. Once out in the open, however, the herd had seemed
  to split into several small bunches, each going in a different direction.
  Which puzzled Irish a little at first. Later, he thought he understood.</p>

  <p>The cattle, it would seem, had been driven purposefully into the edge of
  the breaks and there made to scatter out through the winding gulches and
  canyons that led deeper into the Badlands. It was the trick of
  range-men&mdash;he could not believe that the strange settlers, ignorant of
  the country and the conditions, would know enough to do this. He hesitated
  before several possible routes, the rain pouring down upon him, a chill
  breeze driving it into his face. If there had been hoofprints to show which
  way the boys had gone, the rain had washed them so that they looked dim and
  old and gave him little help.</p>

  <p>He chose what seemed to him the gorge which the boys would be most likely
  to follow&mdash;especially at night and if they were in open pursuit of those
  who had driven the cattle off the benchland; and that the cattle had been
  driven beyond this point was plain enough, for otherwise he would have
  overtaken stragglers long before this.</p>

  <p>It was nearing noon when he came out finally upon a little, open flat and
  found there Big Medicine and Pink holding a bunch of perhaps a hundred cattle
  which they had gleaned from the surrounding gulches and little "draws" which
  led into the hills. The two were wet to the skin, and they were chilled and
  hungry and as miserable as a she-bear sent up a tree by yelping, yapping
  dogs.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine it was who spied him first through the haze of falling water,
  and galloped heavily toward him, his horse flinging off great pads of mud
  from his feet as he came.</p>

  <p>"Say!" he bellowed when he was yet a hundred yards away. "Got any grub
  with yuh?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Irish called back.</p>

  <p>"Y' AIN'T?" Big Medicine's voice was charged with incredulous reproach.
  "What'n hell yuh doin' here without GRUB? Is Patsy comin' with the
  wagon?"</p>

  <p>"No. I sent Patsy on in to town after&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Town? And us out here&mdash;" Big Medicine choked over his wrongs.</p>

  <p>Irish waited until he could get in a word and then started to explain. But
  Pink rode up with his hatbrim flapping soggily against one dripping cheek
  when the wind caught it, and his coat buttoned wherever there were buttons,
  and his collar turned up, and looking pinched and draggled and wholly
  miserable.</p>

  <p>"Say! Got anything to eat?" he shouted when he came near, his voice eager
  and hopeful.</p>

  <p>"No!" snapped Irish with the sting of Big Medicine's vituperations
  rankling fresh in his soul.</p>

  <p>"Well why ain't yuh? Where's Patsy?" Pink came closer and eyed the
  newcomer truculently.</p>

  <p>"How'n hell do I know?" Irish was getting a temper to match their own.</p>

  <p>"Well, why don't yuh know? What do yuh think you're out here for? To tell
  us you think it's going to rain? If we was all of us like you, there'd be
  nothing to it for the nester-bunch. It's a wonder you come alive enough to
  ride out this way at all! I don't reckon you've even got anything to drink!
  "Pink paused a second, saw no move toward producing anything wet and
  cheering, and swore disgustedly. "Of course not! You needed it all yourself!
  So help me Josephine, if I was as low-down ornery as some I could name I'd
  tie myself to a mule's tail and let him kick me to death! Ain't got any grub!
  Ain't got&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Irish interrupted him then with a sentence that stung. Irish, remember,
  distinctly approved of himself and his actions. True, he had forgotten to
  bring anything to eat with him, but there was excuse for that in the haste
  with which he had left his own breakfast. Besides how could he be expected to
  know that the cattle had been driven away down here, and scattered, and that
  the Happy Family would not have overtaken them long before? Did they think he
  was a mind-reader?</p>

  <p>Pink, with biting sarcasm, retorted that they did not. That it took a mind
  to read a mind. He added that, from the looks of Irish, he must have started
  home drunk, anyway, and his horse had wandered this far of his own accord.
  Then three or four cows started up a gulch to the right of them and Pink,
  hurling insults over his shoulder, rode off to turn them back. So they did
  not actually come to blows, those two, though they were near it.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine lingered to bawl unforgivable things at Irish, and Irish
  shouted back recklessly that they had all acted like a bunch of sheepherders,
  or the cattle would never have been driven off the bench at all. He declared
  that anybody with the brains of a sick sage hen would have stopped the thing
  right in the start. He said other things also.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine said things in reply, and Pink, returning to the scene with
  his anger grown considerably hotter from feeding upon his discomfort, made a
  few comments pertinent to the subject of Irish's shortcomings.</p>

  <p>You may scarcely believe it, unless you have really lived, and have
  learned how easily small irritations grow to the proportions of real trouble,
  and how swiftly&mdash;but this is a fact: Irish and Big Medicine became so
  enraged that they dismounted simultaneously and Irish jerked off his slicker
  while Big Medicine was running up to smash him for some needless insult.</p>

  <p>They fought, there in the rain and the mud and the chill wind that whipped
  their wet cheeks. They fought just as relentlessly as though they had long
  been enemies, and just as senselessly as though they were not grown men but
  schoolboys. They clinched and pounded and smashed until Pink sickened at the
  sight and tore them apart and swore at them for crazy men and implored them
  to have some sense. They let the cattle that had been gathered with so much
  trouble drift away into the gulches and draws where they must be routed out
  of the brush again, or perhaps lost for days in that rough country.</p>

  <p>When the first violence of their rage had like the storm settled to a cold
  steadiness of animosity, the two remounted painfully and turned back upon
  each other.</p>

  <p>Big Medicine and Pink drew close together as against a common foe, and
  Irish cursed them both and rode away&mdash;whither he did not know nor
  care.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15">XV. &mdash; THE KID HAS IDEAS OF HIS OWN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Old Man sat out in his big chair on the porch, smoking
  and staring dully at the trail which led up the bluff by way of the Hog's
  Back to the benchland beyond. Facing him in an old, cane rocking chair, the
  Honorable Blake smoked with that air of leisurely enjoyment which belongs to
  the man who knows and can afford to burn good tobacco and who has the sense
  to burn it consciously, realizing in every whiff its rich fragrance. The
  Honorable Blake flicked a generous half-inch of ash from his cigar upon a
  porch support and glanced shrewdly at the Old Man's abstracted face.</p>

  <p>"No, it wouldn't do," he observed with the accent of a second
  consideration of a subject that coincides exactly with the first. "It
  wouldn't do at all. You could save the boys time, I've no doubt&mdash;time
  and trouble so far as getting the cattle back where they belong is concerned.
  I can see how they must be hampered for lack of saddle-horses, for instance.
  But&mdash;it wouldn't do, Whitmore. If they come to you and ask for horses
  don't let them have them. They'll manage somehow&mdash;trust them for that.
  They'll manage&mdash;"
  
  <p>"But doggone it, Blake, it's for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sh-sh&mdash;" Blake held up a warning hand. "None of that, my dear
  Whitmore! These young fellows have taken claims in&mdash;er&mdash;good
  faith." His bright blue eyes sparkled with a sudden feeling. "In the best of
  good faith, if you ask me. I&mdash;admire them intensely for what they have
  started out to do. But&mdash;they have certain things which they must do,
  and do alone. If you would not thwart them in accomplishing what they have
  set out to do, you must go carefully; which means that you must not run to
  their aid with your camp-wagons and your saddle-horses, so they can gather
  the cattle again and drive them back where they belong. You would not be
  helping them. They would get the cattle a little easier and a little
  quicker&mdash;and lose their claims."</p>

  <p>"But doggone it, Blake, them boys have lived right here at the Flying
  U&mdash;why, this has been their home, yuh might say. They ain't like the
  general run of punchers that roam around, workin' for this outfit and for
  that; they've stuck. Why, doggone it, what they done here when I got hurt in
  Chicago and they was left to run themselves, why, that alone puts me under
  obligations to help 'em out in this scrape. Anybody could see that. Ain't I a
  neighbor? Ain't neighbors got a right to jump in and help each other? There
  ain't no law agin&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not against neighbors&mdash;no." Blake uncrossed his perfectly trousered
  legs and crossed them the other way, after carefully avoiding any bagging
  tendency. "But this syndicate&mdash;or these contestants&mdash;will try to prove
  that you are not a neighbor only, but a&mdash;backer of the boys in a
  land-grabbing scheme. To avoid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, doggone your measly hide, Blake, I've told you fifty times I ain't!
  "The Old Man sat forward in his chair and shook his fist unabashed at his
  guest. "Them boys cooked that all up amongst themselves, and went and filed
  on that land before ever I knowed a thing about it. How can yuh set there and
  say I backed 'em? And that blonde Jezebel&mdash;riding down here bold as
  brass and turnin' up her nose at Dell, and callin' me a conspirator to my
  face!"</p>

  <p>"I sticked a pin in her saddle blanket, Uncle Gee-gee. I'll bet she wished
  she'd stayed away from here when her horse bucked her off." The Kid looked up
  from trying to tie a piece of paper to the end of a brindle kitten's
  switching tail, and smiled his adorable smile&mdash;that had a gap in the
  middle.</p>

  <p>"Hey? You leave that cat alone or he'll scratch yuh. Blake, if you can't
  see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He! He's a her and her name's Adeline. Where's the boys, Uncle
  Gee-gee?"</p>

  <p>"Hey? Oh, away down in the breaks after their cattle that got away. You
  keep still and never mind where they've gone." His mind swung back to the
  Happy Family, combing the breaks for their stock and the stock of the
  nesters, with an average of one saddlehorse apiece and a camp outfit of the
  most primitive sort&mdash;if they had any at all, which he doubted. The Old
  Man had eased too many roundups through that rough country not to realize
  keenly the difficulties of the Happy Family.</p>

  <p>"They need horses," he groaned to Blake, "and they need help. If you
  knowed the country and the work as well as I do you'd know they've got to
  have horses and help. And there's their claims&mdash;fellers squatting down
  on every eighty&mdash;four different nesters fer every doggoned one of the
  bunch to handle! And you tell me I got to set here and not lift a hand. You
  tell me I can't put men to work on that fence they want built. You tell me I
  can't lend 'em so much as a horse!"</p>

  <p>Blake nodded. "I tell you that, and I emphasize it," he assured the other,
  brushing off another half inch of ash from his cigar. "If you want to help
  those boys hold their land, you must not move a finger."</p>

  <p>"He's wiggling all of 'em!" accused the Kid sternly, and pointed to the
  Old Man drumming irritatedly upon his chair arms. "He don't want to help the
  boys, but I do. I'll help 'em get their cattle, Mr. Blake. I'm one of the
  bunch anyway. I'll lend 'em my string."</p>

  <p>"You've been told before not to butt in to grownup talk," his uncle
  reproved him irascibly. "Now you cut it out. And take that string off'n that
  cat!" he added harshly. "Dell! Come and look after this kid! Doggone it, a
  man can't talk five minutes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Kid giggled irrepressibly. "That's one on you, old man. You saw Doctor
  Dell go away a long time ago. Think she can hear yuh when she's away up on
  the bench?"</p>

  <p>"You go on off and play!" commanded the Old Man. "I dunno what yuh want to
  pester a feller to death for&mdash;and say! Take that string off'n that
  cat!"</p>

  <p>"Aw gwan! It ain't hurting the cat. She likes it." He lifted the kitten
  and squeezed her till she yowled. "See? She said yes, she likes it."</p>

  <p>The Old Man returned to the trials of the Happy Family, and the Kid sat
  and listened, with the brindle kitten snuggled uncomfortably, head downward
  in his arms.</p>

  <p>The Kid had heard a good deal, lately, about the trials of his beloved
  "bunch." About the "nesters" who brought cattle in to eat up the grass that
  belonged to the cattle of the bunch. The Kid understood that
  perfectly&mdash;since he had been raised in the atmosphere of range talk. He
  had heard about the men building shacks on the claims of the Happy
  Family&mdash;he understood that also; for he had seen the shacks himself, and
  he had seen where they had been slid down hill into the bottom of Antelope
  Coulee. He knew all about the attack on Patsy's cabin and how the Happy
  Family had been fooled, and the cattle driven off and scattered. The
  breaks&mdash;he was a bit hazy upon the subject of breaks. He had heard
  about them all his life. The stock got amongst them and had to be hunted out.
  He thought&mdash;as nearly as could be put in words&mdash;that it must be a
  place where all the brakes grow that are used on wagons and buggies. These
  were of wood, therefore they must grow somewhere. They grew where the Happy
  Family went sometimes, when they were gone for days and days after stock.
  They were down there now&mdash;it was down in the breaks, always&mdash;and
  they couldn't round up their cattle because they hadn't horses enough. They
  needed help, so they could hurry back and slide those other shacks off their
  claims and into Antelope Coulee where they had slid the others. On the whole,
  the Kid had a very fair conception of the state of affairs. Claimants and
  contestants&mdash;those words went over his head. But he knew perfectly well
  that the nesters were the men that didn't like the Happy Family, and lived in
  shacks on the way to town, and plowed big patches of prairie and had children
  that went barefooted in the furrows and couldn't ride horses to save their
  lives. Pilgrim kids, that didn't know what "chaps" were&mdash;he had talked
  with a few when he went with Doctor Dell and Daddy Chip to see the sick
  lady.</p>

  <p>After a while, when the Honorable Blake became the chief speaker and
  leaned forward and tapped the Old Man frequently on a knee with his finger,
  and used long words that carried no meaning, and said contestant and claimant
  and evidence so often that he became tiresome, the Kid slid off the porch and
  went away, his small face sober with deep meditations.</p>

  <p>He would need some grub&mdash;maybe the bunch was hungry without any
  camp-wagons. The Kid had stood around in the way, many's the time, and
  watched certain members of the Happy Family stuff emergency rations into
  flour sacks, and afterwards tie the sack to their saddles and ride off. He
  knew all about that, too.</p>

  <p>He hunted up a flour sack that had not had all the string pulled out of it
  so it was no longer a sack but a dish-towel, and held it behind his back
  while he went cautiously to the kitchen door. The Countess was nowhere in
  sight&mdash;but it was just as well to make sure. The Kid went in, took a
  basin off the table, held it high and deliberately dropped it on the floor.
  It made a loud bang, but it did not elicit any shrill protest from the
  Countess; therefore the Countess was nowhere around. The Kid went in boldly
  and filled his four-sack so full it dragged on the floor when he started
  off.</p>

  <p>At the door he went down the steps ahead of the sack, and bent his small
  back from the third step and pulled the sack upon his shoulders. It wobbled a
  good deal, and the Kid came near falling sidewise off the last step before he
  could balance his burden. But he managed it, being the child of his parents
  and having a good deal of persistence in his makeup; and he went, by a
  roundabout way, to the stable with the grub-sack bending him double. Still it
  was not so very heavy; it was made bulky by about two dozen fresh-made
  doughnuts and a loaf of bread and a jar of honey and a glass of wild-currant
  jelly and a pound or so of raw, dried prunes which the Kid called nibblin's
  because he liked to nibble at them, like a prairie dog at a grass root.</p>

  <p>Getting that sack tied fast to the saddle after the saddle was on Silver's
  back was no easy task for a boy who is six, even though he is large for his
  age. Still, being Chip's Kid and the Little Doctor's he did it&mdash;with the
  help of the oats box and Silver's patient disposition.</p>

  <p>There were other things which the bunch always tied on their saddles; a
  blanket, for instance, and a rope. The Kid made a trip to the bunk-house and
  pulled a gray blanket off Ole's bed, and spent a quarter of an hour rolling
  it as he had seen the boys roll blankets. The oats box, with Silver standing
  beside it, came in handy again. He found a discarded rope and after much
  labor coiled it crudely and tied it beside the saddle-fork.</p>

  <p>The Kid went to the door, stood beside it and leaned away over so that he
  could peek out and not be seen. Voices came from the house&mdash;the voice of
  the Old Man; to be exact, high-pitched and combative. The Kid looked up the
  bluff, and the trail lay empty in the afternoon sun. Still, he did not like
  to take that trail. Doctor Dell might come riding down there almost any
  minute. The Kid did not want to meet Doctor Dell just right then.</p>

  <p>He went back, took Silver by the bridle reins and led him out of the barn
  and around the corner where he could not be seen from the White House. He
  thought he had better go down the creek, and out through the wire gate and on
  down the creek that way. He was sure that the "breaks" were somewhere beyond
  the end of the coulee, though he could not have explained why he was sure of
  it. Perhaps the boys, in speaking of the breaks, had unconsciously tilted
  heads in that direction.</p>

  <p>The Kid went quickly down along the creek through the little pasture,
  leading Silver by the reins. He was terribly afraid that his mother might
  ride over the top of the hill and see him and call him back. If she did that,
  he would have to go, of course. Deliberate, open disobedience had never yet
  occurred to the Kid as a moral possibility. If your mother or your Daddy Chip
  told you to come back, you had to come; therefore he did not want to be told
  to come. Doctor Dell had told him that he could go on roundup some
  day&mdash;the Kid had decided that this was the day, but that it would be
  foolish to mention the decision to anyone. People had a way of disagreeing
  with one's decisions&mdash;especially Doctor Dell, she always said one was
  too little. The Kid thought he was getting pretty big, since he could stand
  on something and put the saddle on Silver his own self, and cinch it and
  everything; plenty big enough to get out and help the bunch when they needed
  help.</p>

  <p>He did not look so very big as he went trudging down alongside the creek,
  stumbling now and then in the coarse grass that hid the scattered rocks. He
  could not keep his head twisted around to look under Silver's neck and watch
  the hill trail, and at the same time see where he was putting his feet. And
  if he got on Silver now he would be seen and recognized at the first glance
  which Doctor Dell would give to the coulee when she rode over the brow of the
  hill. Walking beside Silver's shoulder , on the side farthest from the bluff,
  he might not be seen at all; Doctor Dell might look and think it was just a
  horse walking along the creek his own self.</p>

  <p>The Kid was extremely anxious that he should not be seen. The bunch needed
  him. Uncle Gee-gee said they needed help. The Kid thought they would expect
  him to come and help with his "string." He helped Daddy Chip drive the horses
  up from the little pasture, these days; just yesterday he had brought the
  whole bunch up, all by his own self, and had driven them into the big corral
  alone, and Daddy Chip had stood by the gate and watched him do it. Daddy Chip
  had lifted him down from Silver's back, and had squeezed him hard, and had
  called him a real, old cowpuncher. The Kid got warm all inside him when he,
  thought of it.</p>

  <p>When a turn in the narrow creek-bottom hid him completely from the ranch
  buildings and the hill trail, the Kid led Silver alongside a low bank and
  climbed into the saddle. Then he made Silver lope all the way to the
  gate.</p>

  <p>He had some trouble with that gate. It was a barbed wire gate, such as
  bigger men than the Kid sometimes swear over. It went down all right, but
  when he came to put it up again, that was another matter. He simply had to
  put it up before he could go on. You always had to shut gates if you found
  them shut&mdash;that was a law of the range which the Kid had learned so long
  ago he could not remember when he had learned. And there was another
  reason&mdash;he did not want 'em to know he had passed that way, if they took
  a notion to call him back. So he worked and he tugged and he grew so red in
  the face it looked as if he were choking. But he got the gate up and the wire
  loop over the stake&mdash;though he had to hunt up an old piece of a post to
  stand on, and even then had to stand on his toes to reach the
  loop&mdash;since he was Chip's Kid and the Little Doctor's.</p>

  <p>He even remembered to scrape out the tell-tale prints of his small feet in
  the bare earth there, and the prints of Silver's feet where he went through.
  Yarns he had heard the Happy Family tell, in the bunk-house on rainy days,
  had taught him these tricks. He was extremely thorough in all that he
  did&mdash;being a good deal like his dad&mdash;and when he went over the grass, no
  one would have suspected that he had passed that way.</p>

  <p>After a while he left that winding creek-bottom and climbed a long ridge.
  Then he went down hill and pretty soon he climbed another hill that made old
  Silver stop and rest before he went on to the top. The Kid stood on the top
  for a few minutes and stared wistfully out over the tumbled mass of hills,
  and deep hollows, and hills, and hill and hills&mdash;till he could not see
  where they left off. He could not see any of the bunch; but then, he could
  not see any brakes growing anywhere, either. The bunch was down in the
  brakes&mdash;he had heard that often enough to get it fixed firmly in his
  mind. Well, when he came to where the brakes grew&mdash;and he would know
  them, all right, when he saw them!&mdash;he would find the bunch. He thought
  they'd be s'prised to see him ride up! The bunch didn't know that he could
  drive stock all his own self, and that he was a real, old cowpuncher now. He
  was a lot bigger. He didn't have to hunt such a big rock, or such a high
  bank, to get on Silver now. He thought he must be pretty near as big as Pink,
  any way. They would certainly be s'prised!</p>

  <p>The brakes must be farther over. Maybe he would have to go over on the
  other side of that biggest hill before he came to the place where they grew.
  He rode unafraid down a steep, rocky slope where Silver picked his way very,
  very carefully, and sometimes stopped and smelt of a ledge or a pile of
  rocks, and then turned and found some other way down.</p>

  <p>The Kid let him choose his path&mdash;Daddy Chip had taught him to leave
  the reins loose and let Silver cross ditches and rough places where he wanted
  to cross. So Silver brought him safely down that hill where even the Happy
  Family would have hesitated to ride unless the need was urgent.</p>

  <p>He could not go right up over the next hill&mdash;there was a rock ledge
  that was higher than his head when he sat on Silver. He went down a narrow
  gulch&mdash;ah, an awfully narrow gulch! Sometimes he was afraid Silver was
  too fat to squeeze through; but Silver always did squeeze through somehow.
  And still there were no brakes growing anywhere. Just choke-cherry trees,
  and service-berries, and now and then a little flat filled with cottonwoods
  and willows&mdash;familiar trees and bushes that he had known all his six
  years of life.</p>

  <p>So the Kid went on and on, over hills or around hills or down along the
  side of a hill. But he did not find the Happy Family, and he did not find the
  brakes. He found cattle that had the Flying U brand&mdash;they had a
  comfortable, homey look. One bunch he drove down a wide coulee, hazing them
  out of the brush and yelling "HY-AH!" at them, just the way the Happy Family
  yelled. He thought maybe these were the cattle the Happy Family were looking
  for; so he drove them ahead of him and didn't let one break back on him and
  he was the happiest Kid in all Montana with these range cattle, that had the
  Flying U brand, galloping awkwardly ahead of him down that big coulee.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16">XVI. &mdash; "A RELL OLD COWPUNCHER"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The hills began to look bigger, and kind of chilly and blue
  in the deep places. The Kid wished that he could find some of the boys. He
  was beginning to get hungry, and he had long ago begun to get tired. But he
  was undismayed, even when he heard a coyote yap-yap-yapping up a brushy
  canyon. It might be that he would have to camp out all night. The Kid had
  loved those cowboy yarns where the teller&mdash;who was always the
  hero&mdash;had been caught out somewhere and had been compelled to make a
  "dry camp." His favorite story of that type was the story of how Happy Jack
  had lost his clothes and had to go naked through the breaks. It was not often
  that he could make Happy Jack tell him that story&mdash;never when the other
  boys were around. And there were other times; when Pink had got lost, down in
  the breaks, and had found a cabin just&mdash;in&mdash;TIME, with Irish sick
  inside and a blizzard just blowing outside, and they were mad at each other
  and wouldn't talk, and all they had to eat was one weenty, teenty snow-bird,
  till the yearling heifer came and Pink killed it and they had beefsteak and
  got good friends again. And there were other times, that others of the boys
  could tell about, and that the Kid thought about now with pounding pulse. It
  was not all childish fear of the deepening shadows that made his eyes big and
  round while he rode slowly on, farther and farther into the breaks.</p>

  <p>He still drove the cattle before him; rather, he followed where the cattle
  led. He felt very big and very proud&mdash;but he did wish he could find the
  Happy Family! Somebody ought to stand guard, and he was getting sleepy
  already.</p>

  <p>Silver stopped to drink at a little creek of clear, cold water. There was
  grass, and over there was a little hollow under a rock ledge. The sky was all
  purple and red, like Doctor Dell painted in pictures, and up the coulee,
  where he had been a little while ago, it was looking kind of dark. The Kid
  thought maybe he had better camp here till morning. He reined Silver against
  a bank and slid off, and stood looking around him at the strange hills with
  the huge, black boulders that looked like houses unless you knew, and the
  white cliffs that looked&mdash;queer&mdash;unless you knew they were just
  cliffs.</p>

  <p>For the first time since he started, the Kid wished guiltily that his dad
  was here or&mdash;he did wish the bunch would happen along! He wondered if
  they weren't camped, maybe, around that point. Maybe they would hear him if
  he hollered as loud as he could, which he did, two or three times; and quit
  because the hills hollered back at him and they wouldn't stop for the longest
  time&mdash;it was just like people yelling at him from behind these
  rocks.</p>

  <p>The Kid knew, of course, who they were; they were Echo-boys, and they
  wouldn't hurt, and they wouldn't let you see them. They just ran away and
  hollered from some other place. There was an Echo-boy lived up on the bluff
  somewhere above the house. You could go down in the little pasture and
  holler, and the Echo-boy would holler back. The Kid was not afraid&mdash;but
  there seemed to be an awful lot of Echo-boys down in these hills. They were
  quiet after a minute or so, and he did not call again.</p>

  <p>The Kid was six, and he was big for his age; but he looked very little,
  there alone in that deep coulee that was really more like a canyon&mdash;very
  little and lonesome and as if he needed his Doctor Dell to take him on her
  lap and rock him. It was just about the time of day when Doctor Dell always
  rocked him and told him stories&mdash;about the Happy Family, maybe. The Kid
  hated to be suspected of baby ways, but he loved these times, when his legs
  were tired and his eyes wanted to go shut, and Doctor Dell laid her cheek on
  his hair and called him her baby man. Nobody knew about these times&mdash;that
  was most always in the bed room and the boys couldn't hear.</p>

  <p>The Kid's lips quivered a little. Doctor Dell would be surprised when he
  didn't show up for supper, he guessed. He turned to Silver and to his man
  ways, because he did not like to think about Doctor Dell just right now.</p>

  <p>"Well, old feller, I guess you want your saddle off, huh?" he quavered,
  and slapped the horse upon the shoulder . He lifted the stirrup&mdash;it was
  a little stock saddle, with everything just like a big saddle except the
  size; Daddy Chip had had it made for the Kid in Cheyenne, last
  Christmas&mdash;and began to undo the latigo, whistling self-consciously and
  finding that his lips kept trying to come unpuckered all the time, and trying
  to tremble just the way they did when he cried. He had no intention of
  crying.</p>

  <p>"Gee! I always wanted to camp out and watch the stars," he told Silver
  stoutly. "Honest to gran'ma, I think this is just&mdash;simply&mdash;GREAT! I
  bet them nester kids would be scared. Hunh!"</p>

  <p>That helped a lot. The Kid could whistle better after that. He pulled of
  the saddle, laid it down on its side so that the skirts would not bend out of
  shape&mdash;oh, he had been well-taught, with the whole Happy Family for his
  worshipful tutors!&mdash;and untied the rope from beside the fork. "I'll have
  to anchor you to a tree, old-timer," he told the horse briskly. "I'd sure
  hate to be set afoot in this man's country!" And a minute later&mdash;"Oh,
  funder! I never brought you any sugar!"</p>

  <p>Would you believe it, that small child of the Flying U picketed his horse
  where the grass was best, and the knots he tied were the knots his dad would
  have tied in his place. He unrolled his blanket and carried it to the
  sheltered little nook under the ledge, and dragged the bag of doughnuts and
  the jelly and honey and bread after it. He had heard about thievish animals
  that will carry off bacon and flour and such. He knew that he ought to hang
  his grub in a tree, but he could not reach up as far as the fox who might try
  to help himself, so that was out of the question.</p>

  <p>The Kid ate a doughnut while he studied the matter out for himself. "If a
  coyote or a skink came pestering around ME, I'd frow rocks at him," he said.
  So when he had finished the doughnut he collected a pile of rocks. He ate
  another doughnut, went over and laid himself down on his stomach the way the
  boys did, and drank from the little creek. It was just a chance that he had
  not come upon water tainted with alkali&mdash;but fate is kind sometimes.</p>

  <p>So the Kid, trying very, very hard to act just like his Daddy Chip and the
  boys, flopped the blanket vigorously this way and that in an effort to get it
  straightened, flopped himself on his knees and folded the blanket round and
  round him until he looked like a large, gray cocoon, and cuddled himself
  under the ledge with his head on the bag of doughnuts and his wide eyes fixed
  upon the first pale stars and his mind clinging sturdily to his mission and
  to this first real, man-sized adventure that had come into his small
  life.</p>

  <p>It was very big and very empty&mdash;that canyon. He lifted his yellow
  head and looked to see if Silver were there, and was comforted at the sight
  of his vague bulk close by, and by the steady KR-UP, KR-UP of bitten
  grasses.</p>

  <p>"I'm a rell ole cowpuncher, all right," he told himself bravely; but he
  had to blink his eyelashes pretty fast when he said it. A "rell ole
  cowpuncher" wouldn't cry! He was afraid Doctor Dell would be AWFULLY
  s'prised, though...</p>

  <p>An unexpected sob broke loose, and another. He wasn't afraid&mdash;but...
  Silver, cropping steadily at the grass which must be his only supper, turned
  and came slowly toward the Kid in his search for sweeter grass-tufts. The Kid
  choked off the third sob and sat up ashamed. He tugged at the bag and made
  believe to Silver that his sole trouble was with his pillow.</p>

  <p>"By cripes, that damn' jelly glass digs right into my ear," he complained
  aloud, to help along the deception. "You go back, old-timer&mdash;I'm all
  right. I'm a&mdash;rell&mdash;ole cowpuncher; ain't I, old-timer? We're
  makin' a dry-camp, just like&mdash;Happy Jack. I'm a rell&mdash;ole&mdash;"
  The Kid went to sleep before he finished saying it. There is nothing like the
  open air to make one sleep from dusk till dawn. The rell ole cowpuncher
  forgot his little white bed in the corner of the big bedroom. He forgot that
  Doctor Dell would be awfully s'prised, and that Daddy Chip would maybe be
  cross&mdash;Daddy Chip was cross, sometimes. The rell ole cowpuncher lay with
  his yellow curls pillowed on the bag of doughnuts and the gray blanket
  wrapped tightly around him, and slept soundly; and his lips were curved in
  the half smile that came often to his sleeping face and made him look ever
  so much like his Daddy Chip.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17">XVII. &mdash; "LOST CHILD"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Djuh find 'im?" The Old Man had limped down to the big gate
  and stood there bare headed under the stars, waiting, hoping&mdash;fearing to
  hear the answer.</p>

  <p>"Hasn't he showed up yet?" Chip and the Little Doctor rode out of the
  gloom and stopped before the gate. Chip did not wait for an answer. One
  question answered the other and there was no need for more. "I brought Dell
  home," he said. "She's about all in&mdash;and he's just as likely to come
  back himself as we are to run across him. Silver'll bring him home, all
  right. He can't be&mdash;yuh can't lose a horse. You go up to the house and
  lie down, Dell. I&mdash;the Kid's all right."</p>

  <p>His voice held all the tenderness of the lover, and all the protectiveness
  of the husband and all the agony of a father&mdash;but Chip managed to keep
  it firm and even for all that. He lifted the Little Doctor bodily from the
  saddle, held her very close in his arms for a minute, kissed her twice and
  pushed her gently through the gate.</p>

  <p>"You better stay right here," he said authoritatively, "and rest and look
  after J.G. You can't do any good riding&mdash;and you don't want to be gone
  when he comes." He reached over the gate, got hold of her arm and pulled her
  towards him. "Buck up, old girl," he whispered, and kissed her lingeringly.
  "Now's the time to show the stuff you're made of. You needn't worry one
  minute about that kid. He's the goods, all right. Yuh couldn't lose him if
  you tried. Go up and go to bed."</p>

  <p>"Go to bed!" echoed the Little Doctor and sardonically, "J.G., are you sure
  he didn't say anything about going anywhere?"</p>

  <p>"No. He was settin' there on the porch tormenting the cat." The Old Man
  swallowed a lump. "I told him to quit. He set there a while after
  that&mdash;I was talkin' to Blake. I dunno where he went to. I
  was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'S that you, Dell? Did yuh find 'im?" The Countess came flapping down the
  path in a faded, red kimono. "What under the shinin' sun's went with him, do
  yuh s'pose? Yuh never know what a day's got up its sleeve&mdash;'n I always
  said it. Man plans and God displans&mdash;the poor little tad'll be scairt
  plumb to death, out all alone in the dark&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake shut up!" cried the tortured Little Doctor, and
  fled past her up the path as though she had some hope of running away from
  the tormenting thoughts also. "Poor little tad, all alone in the
  dark,"&mdash;the words followed her and were like sword thrusts through the
  mother heart of her. Then Chip overtook her, knowing too well the hurt which
  the Countess had given with her blundering anxiety. Just at the porch he
  caught up with her, and she clung to him, sobbing wildly.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to mind what that old hen says," he told her brusquely.
  "She's got to do just so much cackling or she'd choke, I reckon. The Kid's
  all right. Some of the boys have run across him by this time, most likely,
  and are bringing him in. He'll be good and hungry, and the scare will do him
  good." He forced himself to speak as though the Kid had merely fallen on the
  corral fence, or something like that. "You've got to make up your mind to
  these things," he argued, "if you tackle raising a boy, Dell. Why, I'll bet I
  ran off and scared my folks into fits fifty times when I was a kid."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;he's&mdash;just a baby!" sobbed the Little Doctor with her face
  pressed hard against Chip's strong, comforting shoulder.</p>

  <p>"He's a little devil!" amended Chip fiercely. "He ought to be walloped for
  scaring you like this. He's just as capable of looking after himself as most
  kids twice his size. He'll get hungry and head for home&mdash;and if he don't
  know the way, Silver does; so he can't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But he may have fallen and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Come, now! Haven't you got any more sense than the Countess? If you
  insist of thinking up horrors to scare yourself with, I don't know as anybody
  can stop you. Dell! Brace up and quit worrying. I tell
  you&mdash;he's&mdash;all right!"</p>

  <p>That did well enough&mdash;seeing the Little Doctor did not get a look at
  Chip's face, which was white and drawn, with sunken, haggard eyes staring
  into the dark over her head. He kissed her hastily and told her he must go,
  and that he'd hurry back as soon as he could. So he went half running down
  the path and passed the Countess and the Old Man without a word; piled onto
  his horse and went off up the hill road again.</p>

  <p>They could not get it out of their minds that the Kid must have ridden up
  on the bluff to meet his mother, had been too early to meet her&mdash;for the
  Little Doctor had come home rather later than she expected to do&mdash;and
  had wandered off to visit the boys, perhaps, or to meet his Daddy Chip who
  was over there some where on the bench trying to figure out a system of
  ditches that might logically be expected to water the desert claims of the
  Happy Family&mdash;if they could get the water.</p>

  <p>They firmly believed that the kid had gone up on the hill, and so they
  hunted for him up there. The Honorable Blake had gone to Dry Lake and taken
  the train for Great Falls, before ever the Kid had been really missed. The
  Old Man had not seen the Kid ride up the hill&mdash;but he had been sitting
  with his chair turned away from the road, and he was worried about other
  things and so might easily have missed seeing him. The Countess had been
  taking a nap, and she was not expected to know anything about his departure.
  And she had not looked into the doughnut jar&mdash;indeed, she was so upset
  by supper time that, had she looked, she would not have missed the doughnuts.
  For the same reason Ole did not miss his blanket. Ole had not been near his
  bed; he was out riding and searching and calling through the coulee and up
  toward the old Denson place.</p>

  <p>No one dreamed that the Kid had started out with a camp-outfit&mdash;if
  one might call it that&mdash;and with the intention of joining the Happy
  Family in the breaks, and of helping them gather their cattle. How could they
  dream that? How could they realize that a child who still liked to be told
  bedtime stories and to be rocked to sleep, should harbor such man-size
  thoughts and ambitions? How could they know that the Kid was being "a rell
  ole cowpuncher"?</p>

  <p>That night the whole Happy Family, just returned from the Badlands and
  warned by Chip at dusk that the Kid was missing, hunted the coulees that
  bordered the benchland. A few of the nesters who had horses and could ride
  them hunted also. The men who worked at the Flying U hunted, and Chip hunted
  frantically. Chip just about worshipped that kid, and in spite of his
  calmness and his optimism when he talked to the Little Doctor, you can
  imagine the state of mind he was in.</p>

  <p>At sunrise they straggled in to the ranch, caught up fresh horses,
  swallowed a cup of coffee and what food they could choke down and started out
  again. At nine o'clock a party came out from Dry Lake, learned that the Kid
  was not yet found, and went out under a captain to comb systematically
  through the hills and the coulees.</p>

  <p>Before night all the able-bodied men in the country and some who were
  not&mdash;were searching. It is astonishing how quickly a small army will
  volunteer in such an emergency; and it doesn't seem to matter very much that
  the country seems big and empty of people ordinarily. They come from
  somewhere, when they're needed.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor&mdash;oh, let us not talk about the Little Doctor. Such
  agonies as she suffered go too deep for words.</p>

  <p>The next day after that, Chip saddled a horse and let her ride beside him.
  Chip was afraid to leave her at the ranch&mdash;afraid that she would go
  mad. So he let her ride&mdash;they rode together. They did not go far from
  the ranch. There was always the fear that someone might bring him in while
  they were gone. That fear drove them back, every hour or two. Then another
  fear would drive them forth again.</p>

  <p>Up in another county there is a creek called Lost Child Creek. A child was
  lost&mdash;or was it two children?&mdash;and men hunted and hunted and
  hunted, and it was months before anything was found. Then a cowboy riding
  that way found&mdash;just bones. Chip knew about that creek which is called
  Lost Child. He had been there and he had heard the story, and he had seen
  the father and had shuddered&mdash;and that was long before he had
  known the feeling a father has for his child. What he was deadly afraid of
  now was that the Little Doctor would hear about that creek, and how it had
  gotten its name.</p>

  <p>What he dreaded most for himself was to think of that creek. He kept the
  Little Doctor beside him and away from that Job's comforter, the Countess,
  and tried to keep her hope alive while the hours dragged their leaden feet
  over the hearts of them all.</p>

  <p>A camp was hastily organized in One Man Coulee and another out beyond
  Denson's place, and men went there to the camps for a little food and a
  little rest, when they could hold out no longer. Chip and the Little Doctor
  rode from camp to camp, intercepted every party of searchers they glimpsed on
  the horizon, and came back to the ranch, hollow-eyed and silent for the most
  part. They would rest an hour, perhaps. Then they would ride out again.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family seemed never to think of eating, never to want sleep. Two
  days&mdash;three days&mdash;four days&mdash;the days became a nightmare.
  Irish, with a warrant out for his arrest, rode with the constable,
  perhaps&mdash;if the search chanced to lead them together. Or with Big
  Medicine, whom he had left in hot anger. H. J. Owens and these other
  claim-jumpers hunted with the Happy Family and apparently gave not a thought
  to claims.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen started out on the second day and hunted through all the
  coulees and gulches in the neighborhood of her claim&mdash;coulees and
  gulches that had been searched frantically two or three times before. She had
  no time to make whimsical speeches to Andy Green, nor he to listen. When they
  met, each asked the other for news, and separated without a thought for each
  other. The Kid&mdash;they must find him&mdash;they must.</p>

  <p>The third day, Miss Allen put up a lunch, told her three claim partners
  that she should not come back until night unless that poor child was found,
  and that they need not look for her before dark and set out with the twinkle
  all gone from her humorous brown eyes and her mouth very determined.</p>

  <p>She met Pink and the Native Son and was struck with the change which two
  days of killing anxiety had made in them. True, they had not slept for
  forty-eight hours, except an hour or two after they had been forced to stop
  and eat. True, they had not eaten except in snatches. But it was not that
  alone which made their faces look haggard and old and haunted. They, too,
  were thinking of Lost Child Creek and how it had gotten its name.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen gleaned a little information from them regarding the general
  whereabouts of the various searching parties. And then, having learned that
  the foothills of the mountains were being searched minutely because the Kid
  might have taken a notion to visit Meeker's; and that the country around Wolf
  Butte was being searched, because he had once told Big Medicine that when he
  got bigger and his dad would let him, he was going over there and kill wolves
  to make Doctor Dell some rugs: and that the country toward the river was
  being searched because the Kid always wanted to see where the Happy Family
  drove the sheep to, that time when Happy Jack got shot under the arm; that
  all the places the Kid had seemed most interested in were being searched
  minutely&mdash;if it could be possible to search minutely a country the size
  of that! Having learned all that, Miss Allen struck off by herself, straight
  down into the Badlands where nobody seemed to have done much searching.</p>

  <p>The reason for that was, that the Happy Family had come out of the breaks
  on the day that the Kid was lost. They had not ridden together, but in twos
  and threes because they drove out several small bunches of cattle that they
  had gleaned, to a common centre in One Man Coulee. They had traveled by the
  most feasible routes through that rough country, and they had seen no sign of
  the Kid or any other rider.</p>

  <p>They did not believe that he had come over that far, or even in that
  direction; because a horseman would almost certainly have been sighted by
  some of them in crossing a ridge somewhere.</p>

  <p>It never occurred to anyone that the Kid might go down Flying U Creek and
  so into the breaks and the Badlands. Flying U Creek was fenced, and the wire
  gate was in its place&mdash;Chip had looked down along there, the first
  night, and had found the gate up just as it always was kept. Why should he
  suspect that the Kid had managed to open that gate and to close it after him?
  A little fellow like that?</p>

  <p>So the searching parties, having no clue to that one incident which would
  at least have sent them in the right direction, kept to the outlying fringe
  of gulches which led into the broken edge of the benchland, and to the
  country west and north and south of these gulches. At that, there was enough
  broken country to keep them busy for several days, even when you consider the
  number of searchers.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen did not want to go tagging along with some party. She did not
  feel as if she could do any good that way, and she wanted to do some good.
  She wanted to find that poor little fellow and take him to his mother. She
  had met his mother, just the day before, and had ridden with her for several
  miles. The look in the Little Doctor's eyes haunted Miss Allen until she felt
  sometimes as if she must scream curses to the heavens for so torturing a
  mother. And that was not all; she had looked into Chip's face, last
  night&mdash;and she had gone home and cried until she could cry no more, just
  with the pity of it.</p>

  <p>She left the more open valley and rode down a long, twisting canyon that
  was lined with cliffs so that it was impossible to climb out with a horse.
  She was sure she could not get lost or turned around, in a place like that,
  and it seemed to her as hopeful a place to search as any. When you came to
  that, they all had to ride at random and trust to luck, for there was not the
  faintest clue to guide them. So Miss Allen considered that she could do no
  better than search all the patches of brush in the canyon, and keep on
  going.</p>

  <p>The canyon ended abruptly in a little flat, which she crossed. She had not
  seen the tracks of any horse going down, but when she was almost across the
  flat she discovered tracks of cattle, and now and then the print of a shod
  hoof. Miss Allen began to pride herself on her astuteness in reading these
  signs. They meant that some of the Happy Family had driven cattle this way;
  which meant that they would have seen little Claude Bennett&mdash;that was
  the Kid's real name, which no one except perfect strangers ever
  used&mdash;they would have seen the Kid or his tracks, if he had ridden down
  here.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen, then, must look farther than this. She hesitated before three
  or four feasible outlets to the little flat, and chose the one farthest to
  the right. That carried her farther south, and deeper into a maze of gulches
  and gorges and small, hidden valleys. She did not stop, but she began to see
  that it was going to be pure chance, or the guiding hand of a tender
  Providence, if one ever did find anybody in this horrible jumble. She had
  never seen such a mess. She believed that poor little tot had come down in
  here, after all; she could not see why, but then you seldom did know why
  children took a notion to do certain unbelievable things. Miss Allen had
  taught the primary grade in a city school, and she knew a little about small
  boys and girls and the big ideas they sometimes harbored.</p>

  <p>She rode and rode, trying to put herself mentally in the Kid's place.
  Trying to pick up the thread of logical thought&mdash;children were logical
  sometimes&mdash;startlingly so.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she thought suddenly, "if he started out with the idea of
  hunting cattle! I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he did&mdash;living on a
  cattle ranch, and probably knowing that the men were down here somewhere."
  Miss Allen, you see, came pretty close to the truth with her guess.</p>

  <p>Still, that did not help her find the Kid. She saw a high, bald peak
  standing up at the mouth of the gorge down which she was at that time picking
  her way, and she made up her mind to climb that peak and see if she might not
  find him by looking from that point of vantage. So she rode to the foot of
  the pinnacle, tied her horse to a bush and began to climb.</p>

  <p>Peaks like that are very deceptive in their height. Miss Allen was slim and
  her lungs were perfect, and she climbed steadily and as fast as she dared.
  For all that it took her a long while to reach the top&mdash;much longer than
  she expected. When she reached the black rock that looked, from the bottom,
  like the highest point of the hill, she found that she had not gone much more
  than two-thirds of the way up, and that the real peak sloped back so that it
  could not be seen from below at all.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen was a persistent young woman. She kept climbing until she did
  finally reach the highest point, and could look down into gorges and flats
  and tiny basins and canyons and upon peaks and ridges and worm-like windings,
  and patches of timber and patches of grass and patches of barren earth and
  patches of rocks all jumbled up together&mdash;. Miss Allen gasped from
  something more than the climb, and sat down upon a rock, stricken with a
  sudden, overpowering weakness. "God in heaven!" she whispered, appalled.
  "What a place to get lost in!"</p>

  <p>She sat there a while and stared dejectedly down upon that wild orgy of
  the earth's upheaval which is the Badlands. She felt as though it was sheer
  madness even to think of finding anybody in there. It was worse than a
  mountain country, because in the mountains there is a certain semblance of
  some system in the canyons and high ridges and peaks. Here every
  thing&mdash;peaks, gorges, tiny valleys and all&mdash;seemed to be just
  dumped down together. Peaks rose from the middle of canyons; canyons were
  half the time blind pockets that ended abruptly against a cliff.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she cried aloud, jumping up and gesticulating wildly. "Baby! Little
  Claude! Here! Look up this way!" She saw him, down below, on the opposite
  side from where she had left her horse.</p>

  <p>The Kid was riding slowly up a gorge. Silver was picking his way carefully
  over the rocks&mdash;they looked tiny, down there! And they were not going
  toward home, by any means. They were headed directly away from home.</p>

  <p>The cheeks of Miss Allen were wet while she shouted and called and waved
  her hands. He was alive, anyway. Oh, if his mother could only be told that he
  was alive! Oh, why weren't there telephones or something where they were
  needed! If his poor mother could see him!</p>

  <p>Miss Allen called again, and the Kid heard her. She was sure that he heard
  her, because he stopped&mdash;that pitiful, tiny speck down there on the
  horse!&mdash;and she thought he looked up at her. Yes, she was sure he heard
  her, and that finally he saw her; because he took off his hat and waved it
  over his head&mdash;just like a man, the poor baby!</p>

  <p>Miss Allen considered going straight down to him, and then walking around
  to where her horse was tied. She was afraid to leave him while she went for
  the horse and rode around to where he was. She was afraid she might miss him
  somehow; the Badlands had stamped that fear deep into her soul.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" she shouted, her hands cupped around her trembling lips, tears
  rolling down her cheeks "Wait, baby! I'm coming for you." She hoped that the
  Kid heard what she said, but she could not be sure, for she did not hear him
  reply. But he did not go on at once, and she thought he would wait.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen picked up her skirts away from her ankles and started running
  down the steep slope. The Kid, away down below, stared up at her. She went
  down a third of the way, and stopped just in time to save herself from going
  over a sheer wall of rocks&mdash;stopped because a rock which she dislodged
  with her foot rolled down the slope a few feet, gave a leap into space and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>A step at a time Miss Allen crept down to where the rock had bounced off
  into nothingness, and gave one look and crouched close to the earth. A
  hundred feet, it must be, straight down. After the first shock she looked to
  the right and the left and saw that she must go back, and down upon the other
  side.</p>

  <p>Away down there at the bottom, the Kid sat still on his horse and stared
  up at her. And Miss Allen, calling to him that she would come, started back up
  to the peak.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18">XVIII. &mdash; THE LONG WAY ROUND</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Allen turned to yell encouragingly to the Kid, and she
  saw that he was going on slowly, his head turned to watch her. She told him
  to wait where he was, and she would come around the mountain and get him and
  take him home. "Do you hear me, baby?" she asked imploringly after she had
  told him just what she meant to do. "Answer me, baby!"</p>

  <p>"I ain't a baby!" his voice came faintly shrill after a minute. "I'm a
  rell ole cowpuncher."</p>

  <p>Miss Allen thought that was what he said, but at the time she did not
  quite understand, except his denial of being a baby; that was clear enough.
  She turned to the climb, feeling that she must hurry if she expected to get
  him and take him home before dark. She knew that every minute was precious
  and must not be wasted. It was well after noon&mdash;she had forgotten to eat
  her lunch, but her watch said it was nearly one o'clock already. She had no
  idea how far she had ridden, but she thought it must be twelve miles at
  least.</p>

  <p>She had no idea, either, how far she had run down the butte to the
  cliff&mdash;until she began to climb back. Every rod or so she stopped to
  rest and to look back and to call to the Kid who seemed such a tiny mite of
  humanity among these huge peaks and fearsome gorges. He seemed to be watching
  her very closely; always, when she looked, she could see the pink blur of his
  little upturned face. She must hurry. Oh, if she could only send a wireless
  to his mother! Human inventions fell far short of the big needs, after all,
  she thought as she toiled upward.</p>

  <p>From the top of the peak she could see the hazy outline of the Bear Paws,
  and she knew just about where the Flying U Coulee lay. She imagined that she
  could distinguish the line of its bluff in the far distance. It was not so
  very far&mdash;but she could not get any word of cheer across the quivering
  air lanes. She turned and looked wistfully down at the Kid, a tinier speck
  now than before&mdash;for she had climbed quite a distance. She waved her hand
  to him, and her warm brown eyes held a maternal tenderness. He waved his
  hat&mdash;just like a man; he must be brave! she thought. She turned
  reluctantly and went hurrying down the other side, her blood racing with the
  joy of having found him, and of knowing that he was safe.</p>

  <p>It seemed to take a long time to climb down that peak; much longer than
  she thought it would take. She looked at her watch nervously&mdash;two
  o'clock, almost! She must hurry, or they would be in the dark getting home.
  That did not worry her very much, however, for there would be searching
  parties&mdash;she would be sure to strike one somewhere in the hills before
  dark.</p>

  <p>She came finally down to the level&mdash;except that it was not level at
  all, but a trough-shaped gulch that looked unfamiliar. Still, it was the same
  one she had used as a starting point when she began to climb&mdash;of course
  it was the same one. How in the world could a person get turned around going
  straight up the side of a hill and straight down again in the very same
  place. This was the gorge where her horse was tied, only it might be that she
  was a little below the exact spot; that could happen, of course. So Miss
  Allen went up the gorge until it petered out against the face of the
  mountain&mdash;one might as well call it a mountain and be done with it, for
  it certainly was more than a mere hill.</p>

  <p>It was some time before Miss Allen would admit to herself that she had
  missed the gorge where she had left her horse, and that she did not know
  where the gorge was, and that she did not know where she was herself. She had
  gone down the mouth of the gulch before she made any admissions, and she had
  seen not one solitary thing that she could remember having ever seen
  before.</p>

  <p>Not even the peak she had climbed looked familiar from where she was. She
  was not perfectly sure that it was the same peak when she looked at it.</p>

  <p>Were you ever lost? It is a very peculiar sensation&mdash;the feeling that
  you are adrift in a world that is strange. Miss Allen had never been lost
  before in her life. If she had been, she would have been more careful, and
  would have made sure that she was descending that peak by the exact route she
  had followed up it, instead of just taking it for granted that all she need
  do was get to the bottom.</p>

  <p>After an hour or two she decided to climb the peak again, get her bearings
  from the top and come down more carefully. She was wild with
  apprehension&mdash;though I must say it was not for her own plight but on
  account of the Kid. So she climbed. And then everything looked so different
  that she believed she had climbed another hill entirely. So she went down
  again and turned into a gorge which seemed to lead in the direction where she
  had seen the little lost boy. She followed that quite a long way&mdash;and
  that one petered out like the first.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen found the gorges filling up with shadow, and she looked up and
  saw the sky crimson and gold, and she knew then without any doubts that she
  was lost. Miss Allen was a brave young woman, or she would not have been down
  in that country in the first place; but just the same she sat down with her
  back against a clay bank and cried because of the eeriness and the silence,
  and because she was hungry and she knew she was going to be cold before
  morning&mdash;but mostly because she could not find that poor, brave little
  baby boy who had waved his hat when she left him, and shouted that he was not
  a baby.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes she pulled herself together and went on; there was
  nothing to be gained by sitting in one place and worrying. She walked until
  it was too dark to see, and then, because she had come upon a little, level
  canyon bottom&mdash;though one that was perfectly strange&mdash;she stopped
  there where a high bank sheltered her from the wind that was too cool for
  comfort. She called, a few times, until she was sure that the child was not
  within hearing. After that she repeated poetry to keep her mind off the
  loneliness and the pity of that poor baby alone like herself. She would not
  think of him if she could help it.</p>

  <p>When she began to shiver so that her teeth chattered, she would walk up
  and down before the bank until she felt warm again; then she would sit with
  her back against the clay and close her eyes and try to sleep. It was not a
  pleasant way in which to pass a whole night, but Miss Allen endured it as
  best she could. When the sun tinged the hill-tops she got up stiffly and
  dragged herself out of the canyon where she could get the direction straight
  in her mind, and then set off resolutely to find the Kid. She no longer had
  much thought of finding her horse, though she missed him terribly, and wished
  she had the lunch that was tied to the saddle.</p>

  <p>This, remember, was the fourth day since the Kid rode down through the
  little pasture and stood on a piece of fence-post so that he could fasten the
  gate. Men had given up hope of finding him alive and unharmed. They searched
  now for his body. And then the three women who lived with Miss Allen began to
  inquire about the girl, and so the warning went out that Miss Allen was lost;
  and they began looking for her also.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen, along towards noon of that fourth day, found a small stream of
  water that was fit to drink. Beside the stream she found the footprints of a
  child, and they looked quite fresh&mdash;as if they had been made that day.
  She whipped up her flagging energy and went on hopefully.</p>

  <p>It was a long while afterwards that she met him coming down a canyon on
  his horse. It must have been past three o'clock, and Miss Allen could
  scarcely drag herself along. When she saw him she turned faint, and sat down
  heavily on the steep-sloping bank.</p>

  <p>The Kid rode up and stopped beside her. His face was terribly dirty and
  streaked with the marks of tears he would never acknowledge afterwards. He
  seemed to be all right, though, and because of his ignorance of the danger he
  had been in he did not seem to have suffered half as much as had Miss
  Allen.</p>

  <p>"Howdy do," he greeted her, and smiled his adorable little smile that was
  like the Little Doctor's. "Are you the lady up on the hill? Do you know where
  the bunch is? I'm&mdash;lookin' for the bunch."</p>

  <p>Miss Allen found strength enough to stand up and put her arms around him
  as he sat very straight in his little stock saddle; she hugged him tight.</p>

  <p>"You poor baby!" she cried, and her eyes were blurred with tears. "You
  poor little lost baby!"</p>

  <p>"I ain't a baby!" The Kid pulled himself free. "I'm six years old goin' on
  thirty. I'm a rell ole cowpuncher. I can slap a saddle on my string and ride
  like a son-a-gun. And I can put the bridle on him my own self and everything.
  I&mdash;I was lookin' for the bunch. I had to make a dry-camp and my
  doughnuts is smashed up and the jelly glass broke but I never cried when a
  skink came. I shooed him away and I never cried once. I'm a rell ole
  cowpuncher, ain't I? I ain't afraid of skinks. I frowed a rock at him and I
  said, 'git outa here, you damn old skink or I'll knock your block off!' You
  oughter seen him go! I&mdash;I sure made him hard to ketch, by cripes!"</p>

  <p>Miss Allen stepped back and the twinkle came into her eyes and the
  whimsical twist to her lips. She knew children. Not for the world would she
  offend this manchild.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should say you are a real old cowpuncher!" she exclaimed
  admiringly. "Now I'm afraid of skinks. I never would dare knock his block
  off! And last night when I was lost and hungry and it got dark,
  I&mdash;cried!"</p>

  <p>"Hunh!" The Kid studied her with a condescending pity. "Oh,
  well&mdash;you're just a woman. Us fellers have to take care of women. Daddy
  Chip takes care of Doctor Dell&mdash;I guess she'd cry if she couldn't find
  the bunch and had to make dry-camp and skinks come around&mdash;but I
  never."</p>

  <p>"Of course you never!" Miss Allen agreed emphatically, trying not to look
  conscious of any tear-marks on the Kid's sunburned cheeks. "Women are regular
  cry babies, aren't they? I suppose," she added guilefully, "I'd cry again if
  you rode off to find the bunch and left me down here all alone. I've lost my
  horse, and I've lost my lunch, and I've lost myself, and I'm awful afraid of
  skunks&mdash;skinks."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll take care of you," the Kid comforted. "I'll give you a doughnut
  if you're hungry. I've got some left, but you'll have to pick out the glass
  where the jelly broke on it." He reined closer to the bank and slid off and
  began untying the sadly depleted bag from behind the cantle. Miss Allen
  offered to do it for him, and was beautifully snubbed. The Kid may have been
  just a frightened, lost little boy before he met her&mdash;but that was a
  secret hidden in the silences of the deep canyons. Now he was a real old
  cowpuncher, and he was going to take care of Miss Allen because men always
  had to take care of women.</p>

  <p>Miss Allen offended him deeply when she called him Claude. She was told
  bluntly that he was Buck, and that he belonged to the Flying U outfit, and
  was riding down here to help the bunch gather some cattle. "But I can't find
  the brakes," he admitted grudgingly. "That's where the bunch is&mdash;down in
  the brakes; I can't seem to locate them brakes."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you ought to go home to your mother?" Miss Allen asked
  him while he was struggling with the knot he had tied in the bag.</p>

  <p>"I've got to find the bunch. The bunch needs me," said the Kid. "I&mdash;I
  guess Doctor Dell is s'prised&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who's Doctor Dell? Your mother? Your mother has just about cried herself
  sick, she's so lonesome without you."</p>

  <p>The Kid looked at her wide-eyed. "Aw, gwan!" he retorted after a minute,
  imitating Happy Jack's disbelief of any unpleasant news. "I guess you're jest
  loadin' me. Daddy Chip is takin' care of her. He wouldn't let her be
  lonesome."</p>

  <p>The Kid got the sack open and reached an arm in to the shoulder . He
  groped there for a minute and drew out a battered doughnut smeared liberally
  with wild currant jelly, and gave it to Miss Allen with an air of princely
  generosity and all the chivalry of all the Happy Family rolled into one baby
  gesture. Miss Allen took the doughnut meekly and did not spoil the Kid's
  pleasure by hugging him as she would have liked to do. Instead she said:
  "Thank you, Buck of the Flying U," quite humbly. Then something choked Miss
  Allen and she turned her back upon him abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I've got one, two, free, fourteen left," said the Kid, counting them
  gravely. "If I had 'membered to bring matches," he added regretfully, "I
  could have a fire and toast rabbit legs. I guess you got some glass, didn't
  you? I got some and it cutted my tongue so the bleed came&mdash;but I never
  cried," he made haste to deny stoutly. "I'm a rell ole cowpuncher now. I just
  cussed." He looked at her gravely. "You can't cuss where women can hear," he
  told Miss Allen reassuringly. "Bud says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me see the doughnuts," said Miss Allen abruptly. "I think you ought
  to let me keep the lunch. That's the woman's part. Men can't bother with
  lunch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It ain't lunch, it's grub," corrected the Kid. But he let her have the
  bag, and Miss Allen looked inside. There were some dried prunes that looked
  like lumps of dirty dough, and six dilapidated doughnuts in a mess of jelly,
  and a small glass jar of honey.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't get the cover off," the Kid explained, "'thout I busted it,
  and then it would all spill like the jelly. Gee, I&mdash;I wish I had a beefsteak
  under my belt!"</p>

  <p>Miss Allen leaned over with her elbows on the bank and laughed and
  laughed. Miss Allen was closer to hysterics than she had ever been in her
  life. The Kid looked at her in astonishment and turned to Silver, standing
  with drooping head beside the bank. Miss Allen pulled herself together and
  asked him what he was going to do.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to LOCATE your horse," he said, "and then I'm going to take you
  home." He looked at her disapprovingly. "I don't like you so very much," he
  added. "It ain't p'lite to laugh at a feller all the time."</p>

  <p>"I won't laugh any more. I think we had better go home right away," said
  Miss Allen contritely. "You see, Buck, the bunch came home. They&mdash;they
  aren't hunting cattle now. They want to find you and tell you. And your
  father and mother need you awfully bad, Buck. They've been looking all over
  for you, everywhere, and wishing you'd come home."</p>

  <p>Buck looked wistfully up and down the canyon. His face at that moment was
  not the face of a real old cowpuncher, but the sweet, dirty, mother-hungry
  face of a child. "It's a far ways," he said plaintively. "It's a million
  miles, I guess. I wanted to go home, but I couldn't des' 'zactly
  'member&mdash;and I thought I could find the bunch, and they'd know the trail
  better. Do you know the trail?"</p>

  <p>Miss Allen evaded that question and the Kid's wide, wistful eyes. "I think
  if we start out, Buck, we can find it. We must go toward the sun, now. That
  will be towards home. Shall I put you on your horse?"</p>

  <p>The Kid gave her a withering glance and squirmed up into the saddle with
  the help of both horn and cantle and by the grace of good luck. Miss Allen
  gasped while she watched him.</p>

  <p>The Kid looked down at her triumphantly. He frowned a little and flushed
  guiltily when he remembered something. "'Scuse me," he said. "I guess you
  better ride my horse. I guess I better walk. It ain't p'lite for ladies to
  walk and men ride."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Miss Allen reached up with both hands and held the Kid from
  dismounting. "I'll walk, Buck. I'd rather. I&mdash;why, I wouldn't dare ride
  that horse of yours. I'd be afraid he might buck me off." She pinched her
  eyebrows together and pursed up her lips in a most convincing manner.</p>

  <p>"Hunh!" Scorn of her cowardice was in his tone. "Well, a course I ain't
  scared to ride him."</p>

  <p>So with Miss Allen walking close to the Kid's stirrup and trying her best
  to keep up and to be cheerful and to remember that she must not treat him
  like a little, lost boy but like a real old cowpuncher, they started up the
  canyon toward the sun which hung low above a dark, pine-covered hill.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19">XIX. &mdash; HER NAME WAS ROSEMARY</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Andy Green came in from a twenty-hour ride through the Wolf
  Butte country and learned that another disaster had followed on the heels of
  the first; that Miss Allen had been missing for thirty-six hours. While he
  bolted what food was handiest in the camp where old Patsy cooked for the
  searchers, and the horse wrangler brought up the saddle-bunch just as though
  it was a roundup that held here its headquarters, he heard all that Slim and
  Cal Emmett could tell him about the disappearance of Miss Allen.</p>

  <p>One fact stood significantly in the foreground, and that was that Pink and
  the Native Son had been the last to speak with her, so far as anyone knew.
  That was it&mdash;so far as anyone knew. Andy's lips tightened. There were
  many strangers riding through the country, and where there are many strangers
  there is also a certain element of danger. That Miss Allen was lost was not
  the greatest fear that drove Andy Green forth without sleep and with food
  enough to last him a day or two.</p>

  <p>First he meant to hunt up Pink and Miguel&mdash;which was easy enough,
  since they rode into camp exhausted and disheartened while he was saddling a
  fresh horse. From them he learned the direction which Miss Allen had taken
  when she left them, and he rode that way and never stopped until he had gone
  down off the benchland and had left the fringe of coulees and canyons behind.
  Pink and the Native Son had just come from down in here, and they had seen no
  sign of either her or the Kid. Andy intended to begin where they had left
  off, and comb the breaks as carefully as it is possible for one man to do. He
  was beginning to think that the Badlands held the secret of the Kid's
  disappearance, even though they had seen nothing of him when they came out
  four days ago. Had he seen Chip he would have urged him to send all the
  searchers&mdash;and there were two or three hundred by now&mdash;into the
  Badlands and keep them there until the Kid was found. But he did not see Chip
  and had no time to hunt him up. And having managed to evade the supervision
  of any captain, and to keep clear of all parties, he meant to go alone and
  see if he could find a clue, at least.</p>

  <p>It was down in the long canyon which Miss Allen had followed, that Andy
  found hoof-prints which he recognized. The horse Miss Allen had ridden
  whenever he saw her&mdash;one which she had bought somewhere north of
  town&mdash;had one front foot which turned in toward the other.
  "Pigeon-toed," he would have called it. The track it left in soft soil was
  unmistakable. Andy's face brightened when he saw it and knew that he was on
  her trail. The rest of the way down the canyon he rode alertly, for though he
  knew she might be miles from there by now, to find the route she had taken
  into the Badlands was something gained.</p>

  <p>The flat, which Andy knew very well&mdash;having driven the bunch of
  cattle whose footprints had so elated Miss Allen&mdash;he crossed uneasily.
  There were so many outlets to this rich little valley. He tried several of
  them, which took time; and always when he came to soft earth and saw no track
  of the hoof that turned in toward the other, he would go back and ride into
  another gulch. And when you are told that these were many, and that much of
  the ground was rocky, and some was covered with a thick mat of grass, you
  will not be surprised that when Andy finally took up her trail in the canyon
  farthest to the right, it was well towards noon. He followed her easily
  enough until he came to the next valley, which he examined over and over
  before he found where she had left it to push deeper into the Badlands. And
  it was the same experience repeated when he came out of that gulch into
  another open space.</p>

  <p>He came into a network of gorges that would puzzle almost anyone, and
  stopped to water his horse and let him feed for an hour or so. A man's horse
  meant a good deal to him, down here on such a mission, and even his anxiety
  could not betray him into letting his mount become too fagged.</p>

  <p>After a while he mounted and rode on without having any clue to follow;
  one must trust to chance, to a certain extent, in a place like this. He had
  not seen any sign of the Kid, either, and the gorges were filling with
  shadows that told how low the sun was sliding down the sky. At that time he
  was not more than a mile or so from the canyon up which Miss Allen was
  toiling afoot toward the sun; but Andy had no means of knowing that. He went
  on with drooping head and eyes that stared achingly here and there. That was
  the worst of his discomfort&mdash;his eyes. Lack of sleep and the strain of
  looking, looking, against wind and sun, had made them red-rimmed and
  bloodshot. Miss Allen's eyes were like that, and so were the eyes of all the
  searchers.</p>

  <p>In spite of himself Andy's eyes closed now. He had not slept for two
  nights, and he had been riding all that time. Before he realized it he was
  asleep in the saddle, and his horse was carrying him into a gulch that had no
  outlet&mdash;there were so many such!&mdash;but came up against a hill and
  stopped there. The shadows deepened, and the sky above was red and gold.</p>

  <p>Andy woke with a jerk, his horse having stopped because he could go no
  farther. But it was not that which woke him. He listened. He would have sworn
  that he had heard the shrill, anxious whinny of a horse not far away. He
  turned and examined the gulch, but it was narrow and grassy and had no
  possible place of concealment, and save himself and his own horse it was
  empty. And it was not his own horse that whinnied&mdash;he was sure of that.
  Also, he was sure that he had not dreamed it. A horse had called
  insistently. Andy knew horses too well not to know that there was anxiety and
  rebellion in that call.</p>

  <p>He waited a minute, his heart beating heavily. He turned and started back
  down the gulch, and then stopped suddenly. He heard it again&mdash;shrill,
  prolonged, a call from somewhere; where, he could not determine because of
  the piled masses of earth and rock that flung the sound riotously here and
  there and confused him as to direction.</p>

  <p>Then his own horse turned his head and looked toward the left, and
  answered the call. From far off the strange horse made shrill reply. Andy got
  down and began climbing the left-hand ridge on the run, tired as he was. Not
  many horses ranged down in here&mdash;and he did not believe, anyway, that
  this was any range horse. It did not sound like Silver, but it might be the
  pigeon-toed horse of Miss Allen. And if it was, then Miss Allen would be
  there. He took a deep breath and went up the last steep pitch in a spurt of
  speed that surprised himself.</p>

  <p>At the top he stood panting and searched the canyon below him. Just across
  the canyon was the high peak which Miss Allen had climbed afoot. But down
  below him he saw her horse circling about in a trampled place under a young
  cottonwood.</p>

  <p>You would never accuse Andy Green of being weak, or of having unsteady
  nerves, I hope.</p>

  <p>But it is the truth that he felt his knees give way while he looked; and
  it was a minute or two before he had any voice with which to call to her.
  Then he shouted, and the great hill opposite flung back the echoes
  maddeningly.</p>

  <p>He started running down the ridge, and brought up in the canyon's bottom
  near the horse. It was growing shadowy now to the top of the lower ridges,
  although the sun shone faintly on the crest of the peak. The horse whinnied
  and circled restively when Andy came near. Andy needed no more than a glance
  to tell him that the horse had stood tied there for twenty-four hours, at the
  very least. That meant...</p>

  <p>Andy turned pale. He shouted, and the canyon mocked him with echoes. He
  looked for her tracks. At the base of the peak he saw the print of her riding
  boots; farther along, up the slope he saw the track again. Miss Allen, then,
  must have climbed the peak, and he knew why she had done so. But why had she
  not come down again?</p>

  <p>There was only one way to find out, and he took the method in the face of
  his weariness. He climbed the peak also, with now and then a footprint to
  guide him. He was not one of these geniuses at trailing who could tell, by a
  mere footprint, what had been in Miss Allen's mind when she had passed that
  way; but for all that it seemed logical that she had gone up there to see if
  she could not glimpse the kid&mdash;or possibly the way home.</p>

  <p>At the top he did not loiter. He saw, before he reached the height, where
  Miss Allen had come down again&mdash;and he saw where she had, to avoid a
  clump of boulders and a broken ledge, gone too far to one side. He followed
  that way. She had descended at an angle, after that, which took her away from
  the canyon.</p>

  <p>In Montana there is more of daylight after the sun has gone than there is
  in some other places. Andy, by hurrying, managed to trail Miss Allen to the
  bottom of the peak before it grew really dusky. He knew that she had been
  completely lost when she reached the bottom, and had probably wandered about
  at random since then. At any rate, there were no tracks anywhere save her
  own, so that he felt less anxiety over her safety than when he had started
  out looking for her.</p>

  <p>Andy knew these breaks pretty well. He went over a rocky ridge, which Miss
  Allen had not tried to cross because to her it seemed exactly in the opposite
  direction from where she had started, and so he came to her horse again. He
  untied the poor beast and searched for a possible trail over the ridge to
  where his own horse waited; and by the time he had found one and had forced
  the horse to climb to the top and then descend into the gulch, the darkness
  lay heavy upon the hills.</p>

  <p>He picketed Miss Allen's horse with his rope and fashioned a hobble for
  his own mount. Then he ate a little of the food he carried and sat down to
  rest and smoke and consider how best he could find Miss Allen or the
  Kid&mdash;or both. He believed Miss Allen to be somewhere not far
  away&mdash;since she was afoot, and had left her lunch tied to the saddle.
  She could not travel far without food.</p>

  <p>After a little he climbed back up the ridge to where he had noticed a
  patch of brush, and there he started a fire. Not a very large one, but large
  enough to be seen for a long distance where the vision was not blocked by
  intervening hills. Then he sat down beside it and waited and listened and
  tended the fire. It was all that he could do for the present, and it seemed
  pitifully little. If she saw the fire, he believed that she would come; if
  she did not see it, there was no hope of his finding her in the dark. Had
  there been fuel on the high peak, he might have gone up there to start his
  fire; but that was out of the question, since the peak was barren.</p>

  <p>Heavy-eyed, tired in every fibre of his being, Andy dragged up a dead
  buck-bush and laid the butt of it across his blaze. Then he lay down near
  it&mdash;and went to sleep as quickly as if he had been chloroformed.</p>

  <p>It may have been an hour after that&mdash;it may have been more. He sat up
  suddenly and listened. Through the stupor of his sleep he had heard Miss
  Allen call. At least, he believed he had heard her call, though he knew he
  might easily have dreamed it. He knew he had been asleep, because the fire
  had eaten part of the way to the branches of the bush and had died down to
  smoking embers. He kicked the branch upon the coals and a blaze shot up into
  the night. He stood up and walked a little distance away from the fire so
  that he could see better, and stood staring down into the canyon.</p>

  <p>From below he heard a faint call&mdash;he was sure of it. The wonder to
  him was that he had heard it at all in his sleep. His anxiety must have been
  strong enough even then to send the signal to his brain and rouse him.</p>

  <p>He shouted, and again he heard a faint call. It seemed to be far down the
  canyon. He started running that way.</p>

  <p>The next time he shouted, she answered him more clearly. And farther along
  he distinctly heard and recognized her voice. You may be sure he ran, after
  that!</p>

  <p>After all, it was not so very far, to a man who is running recklessly down
  hill. Before he realized how close he was he saw her standing before him in
  the starlight. Andy did not stop. He kept right on running until he could
  catch her in his arms; and when he had her there he held her close and then
  he kissed her. That was not proper, of course&mdash;but a man does sometimes
  do terribly improper things under the stress of big emotions; Andy had been
  haunted by the fear that she was dead.</p>

  <p>Well, Miss Allen was just as improper as he was, for that matter. She did
  say "Oh!" in a breathless kind of way, and then she must have known who he
  was. There surely could be no other excuse for the way she clung to him and
  without the faintest resistance let him kiss her.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've found him!" she whispered after the first terribly
  unconventional greetings were over. "I've found him, Mr. Green. I couldn't
  come up to the fire, because he's asleep and I couldn't carry him, and I
  wouldn't wake him unless I had to. He's just down here&mdash;I was afraid to
  go very far, for fear of losing him again. Oh, Mr. Green! I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My name is Andy," he told her. "What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Mine? It's&mdash;well, it's Rosemary. Never mind now. I should think
  you'd be just wild to see that poor little fellow&mdash;he's a brick,
  though."</p>

  <p>"I've been wild," said Andy, "over a good many things&mdash;you, for one.
  Where's the Kid?"</p>

  <p>They went together, hand in hand&mdash;terribly silly, wasn't it?&mdash;to
  where the Kid lay wrapped in the gray blanket in the shelter of a bank. Andy
  struck a match and held it so that he could see the Kid's face&mdash;and Miss
  Allen, looking at the man whose wooing had been so abrupt, saw his mouth
  tremble and his lashes glisten as he stared down while the match-blaze
  lasted.</p>

  <p>"Poor little tad&mdash;he's sure a great Kid," he said huskily when the
  match went out. He stood up and put his arm around Miss Allen just as though
  that was his habit. "And it was you that found him!" he murmured with his
  face against hers. "And I've found you both, thank God."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch20"
     id="ch20">XX. &mdash; THE RELL OLE COWPUNCHER GOES HOME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I don't suppose anything can equal the aplomb of a child
  that has always had his own way and has developed normally. The Kid, for
  instance, had been wandering in the wild places&mdash;this was the morning
  of the sixth day. The whole of Northern Montana waited anxiously for news of
  him. The ranch had been turned into a rendezvous for searchers. Men rode as
  long as they could sit in the saddle. Women were hysterical in the affection
  they lavished upon their own young. And yet, the Kid himself opened his eyes
  to the sun and his mind was untroubled save where his immediate needs were
  concerned. He sat up thinking of breakfast, and he spied Andy Green humped on
  his knees over a heap of camp-fire coals, toasting rabbit-hams&mdash;the joy
  of it&mdash;on a forked stick. Opposite him Miss Allen crouched and held
  another rabbit-leg on a forked stick. The Kid sat up as if a spring had been
  suddenly released, and threw off the gray blanket</p>

  <p>"Say, I want to do that too!" he cried. "Get me a stick, Andy, so I can do
  it. I never did and I want to!"</p>

  <p>Andy grabbed him as he came up and kissed him&mdash;and the Kid wondered
  at the tremble of Andy's arms. He wondered also at the unusual caress; but it
  was very nice to have Andy's arms around him and Andy's cheek against his,
  and of a sudden the baby of him came to the surface.</p>

  <p>"I want my Daddy Chip!" he whimpered, and laid his head down on Andy's
  shoulder . "And I want my Doctor Dell and my&mdash;cat! She's lonesome for
  me. And I forgot to take the string off her tail and maybe it ain't
  comfortable any more!"</p>

  <p>"We're going to hit the trail, old-timer, just as soon as we get outside
  of a little grub." Andy's voice was so tender that Miss Allen gulped back a
  sob of sympathy. "You take this stick and finish roasting the meat, and then
  see what you think of rabbit-hams. I hear you've been a real old cowpuncher,
  Buck. The way you took care of Miss Allen proves you're the goods, all right.
  Not quite so close, or you'll burn it, Buck. That's better. I'll go get
  another stick and roast the back."</p>

  <p>The Kid, squatting on his heels by the fire, watched gravely the
  rabbit-leg on the two prongs of the willow stick he held. He glanced across
  at Miss Allen and smiled his Little Doctor smile.</p>

  <p>"He's my pal," he announced. "I bet if I stayed we could round up all them
  cattle our own selves. And I bet he can find your horse, too. He&mdash;he's
  'customed to this country. I'd a found your horse today, all right&mdash;but
  I guess Andy could find him quicker. Us punchers'll take care of you, all
  right." The rabbit-leg sagged to the coals and began to scorch, and the Kid
  lifted it startled and was grateful when Miss Allen did not seem to have seen
  the accident.</p>

  <p>"I'd a killed a rabbit for you," he explained, "only I didn't have no gun
  or no matches so I couldn't. When I'm ten my Daddy Chip is going to give me a
  gun. And then if you get lost I can take care of you like Andy can. I'll be
  ten next week, I guess." He turned as Andy came back slicing off the branches
  of a willow the size of his thumb.</p>

  <p>"Say, old-timer, where's the rest of the bunch?" he inquired casually.
  "Did you git your cattle rounded up?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet." Andy sharpened the prongs of his stick and carefully impaled
  the back of the rabbit.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll help you out. But I guess I better go home first&mdash;I guess
  Doctor Dell might need me, maybe."</p>

  <p>"I know she does, Buck." Andy's voice had a peculiar, shaky sound that the
  Kid did not understand. "She needs you right bad. We'll hit the high places
  right away quick."</p>

  <p>Since Andy had gone at daybreak and brought the horses over into this
  canyon, his statement was a literal one. They ate hurriedly and
  started&mdash;and Miss Allen insisted that Andy was all turned around, and
  that they were going in exactly the wrong direction, and blushed and was
  silent when Andy, turning his face full toward her, made a kissing motion
  with his lips.</p>

  <p>"You quit that!" the Kid commanded him sharply. "She's my girl, I guess I
  found her first 'fore you did, and you ain't goin' to kiss her."</p>

  <p>After that there was no lovemaking but the most decorous conversation
  between these two.</p>

  <p>Flying U Coulee lay deserted under the warm sunlight of early forenoon.
  Deserted, and silent with the silence that tells where Death has stopped with
  his sickle. Even the Kid seemed to feel a strangeness in the
  atmosphere&mdash;a stillness that made his face sober while he looked around
  the little pasture and up at the hill trail. In all the way home they had not
  met anyone&mdash;but that may have been because Andy chose the way up Flying
  U Creek as being shorter and therefore more desirable.</p>

  <p>At the lower line fence of the little pasture Andy refused to believe the
  Kid's assertion of having opened and shut the gate, until the Kid got down
  and proved that he could open it&mdash;the shutting process being too slow
  for Andy's raw nerves. He lifted the Kid into the saddle and shut the gate
  himself, and led the way up the creek at a fast trot.</p>

  <p>"I guess Doctor Dell will be glad to see me," the Kid observed wistfully.
  "I've been gone most a year, I guess."</p>

  <p>Neither Andy nor Miss Allen made any reply to this. Their eyes were
  searching the hilltop for riders, that they might signal. But there was no
  one in sight anywhere.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better shout?" suggested Miss Allen. "Or would it be better to
  go quietly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Andy did not reply; nor did he shout. Andy, at that moment, was fighting a
  dryness in his throat. He could not have called out if he had wanted to. They
  rode to the stable and stopped. Andy lifted the Kid down and set him on his
  two feet by the stable door while he turned to Miss Allen. For once in his
  life he was at a loss. He did not know how best to bring the Kid to the
  Little Doctor; how best to lighten the shock of seeing safe and well the
  man-child who she thought was dead. He hesitated. Perhaps he should have
  ridden on to the house with him. Perhaps he should have fired the signal when
  first he came into the coulee. Perhaps...</p>

  <p>The Kid himself swept aside Andy's uncertainties. Adeline, the cat, came
  out of the stable and looked at them contemplatively. Adeline still had the
  string tied to her tail, and a wisp of paper tied to the string. The Kid
  pounced and caught her by the middle.</p>

  <p>"I guess I can tie knots so they stay, by cripes!" he shouted
  vaingloriously. "I guess Happy Jack can't tie strings any better 'n me, can
  he? Nice kitty&mdash;c'm back here, you son-a-gun!"</p>

  <p>Adeline had not worried over the absence of the Kid, but his hilarious
  arrival seemed to worry her considerably. She went bounding up the path to
  the house, and after her went the Kid, yelling epithets which were a bit
  shocking for one of his age.</p>

  <p>So he came to the porch just when Chip and the Little Doctor reached it,
  white-faced and trembling. Adeline paused to squeeze under the steps, and the
  Kid catching her by the tail, dragged her back yowling. While his astounded
  parents watched him unbelievingly, the Kid gripped Adeline firmly and started
  up the steps.</p>

  <p>"I ketched the son-a-gun!" he cried jubilantly.</p>

  <p>"Say, I seen a skink, Daddy Chip, and I frowed a rock and knocked his
  block off 'cause he was going to swipe my grub. Was you s'prised, Doctor
  Dell?"</p>

  <p>Doctor Dell did not say. Doctor Dell was kneeling on the porch floor with
  the Kid held closer in her arms than ever he held the cat, and she was crying
  and laughing and kissing him all at once&mdash;though nobody except a mother
  can perform that feat.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch21"
     id="ch21">XXI. &mdash; THE FIGHT GOES ON</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is amazing how quickly life swings back to the normal
  after even so harrowing an experience as had come to the Flying U. Tragedy
  had hovered there a while and had turned away with a smile, and the smile was
  reflected upon the faces and in the eyes of everyone upon whose souls had
  fallen her shadow. The Kid was safe, and he was well, and he had not suffered
  from the experience; on the contrary he spent most of his waking hours in
  recounting his adventures to an admiring audience. He was a real old
  cowpuncher. He had gone into the wilderness and he had proven the stuff that
  was in him. He had made "dry-camp" just exactly as well as any of the Happy
  Family could have done. He had slept out under the stars rolled in a
  blanket&mdash;and do you think for one minute that he would ever submit to
  lace-trimmed nighties again? If you do, ask the little Doctor what the Kid
  said on the first night after his return, when she essayed to robe him in
  spotless white and rock him, held tight in her starved arms. Or you might ask
  his Daddy Chip, who hovered pretty close to them both, his eyes betraying how
  his soul gave thanks. Or&mdash;never mind, I'll tell you myself.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor brought the nightie, and reached out her two eager arms
  to take the kid off Chip's knees where he was perched contentedly relating
  his adventures with sundry hair-raising additions born of his imagination.
  The Kid was telling Daddy Chip about the skunk he saw, and he hated to be
  interrupted. He looked at his Doctor Dell and at the familiar, white garment
  with lace at the neck and wristbands, and he waved his hand with a gesture of
  dismissal.</p>

  <p>"Aw, take that damn' thing away!" he told her in the tone of the real old
  cowpuncher. "When I get ready to hit the bed-ground, a blanket is all I'll
  need."</p>

  <p>Lest you should think him less lovable than he really was, I must add
  that, when Chip set him down hastily so that he himself could rush off
  somewhere and laugh in secret, the Kid spread his arms with a little chuckle
  and rushed straight at his Doctor Dell and gave her a real bear hug.</p>

  <p>"I want to be rocked," he told her&mdash;and was her own baby man again,
  except that he absolutely refused to reconsider the nightgown. "And I want
  you to tell me a story&mdash;about when Silver breaked his leg. Silver's a
  good ole scout, you bet. I don't know what I'd a done 'thout Silver. And tell
  about the bunch makin' a man outa straw to scare you, and the horses runned
  away. I was such a far ways, Doctor Dell, and I couldn't get back to hear
  them stories and I've most forgot about 'em. And tell about Whizzer, Doctor
  Dell."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor rocked him and told him of the old days, and she never
  again brought him his lace-trimmed nightie at bedtime. She never mentioned
  his language upon the subject, either. The Little Doctor was learning some
  things about her man-child, and one of them was this: When he rode away into
  the Badlands and was lost, other things were lost, and lost permanently; he
  was no longer her baby, for all he liked to be rocked. He had come back to
  her changed, so that she studied him amazedly while she worshipped. He had
  entered boldly into the life which men live, and he would never come back
  entirely to the old order of things. He would never be her baby; there would
  be a difference, even while she held him in her arms and rocked him to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>She knew that it was so, when the Kid insisted, next day, upon going home
  with the bunch; with Andy, rather, who was just now the Kid's particular
  hero. He had to help the bunch he said; they needed him, and Andy needed him
  and Miss Allen needed him.</p>

  <p>"Aw, you needn't be scared, Doctor Dell," he told her shrewdly. "I ain't
  going to find them brakes any more. I'll stick with the bunch, cross my
  heart. and I'll come back tonight if you're scared 'thout me. Honest to
  gran'ma, I've got to go and help the bunch lick the stuffen' outa them
  nesters, Doctor Dell."</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor looked at him strangely, hugged him tight&mdash;and let
  him go. Chip would be with them, and he would bring the Kid home safely,
  and&mdash;the limitations of dooryard play no longer sufficed; her fledgling
  had found what his wings were for, and the nest was too little, now.</p>

  <p>"We'll take care of him," Andy promised her understandingly. "If Chip
  don't come up, this afternoon, I'll bring him home myself. Don't you worry a
  minute about him."</p>

  <p>"I'd tell a man she needn't!" added the Kid patronizingly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he's a lot safer with you boys than he is here at the
  ranch&mdash;unless one of us stood over him all the time, or we tied him up,"
  she told Andy gamely. "I feel like a hen trying to raise a duck! Go on,
  Buck&mdash;but give mother a kiss first."</p>

  <p>The Kid kissed her violently and with a haste that betrayed where his
  thoughts were, in spite of the fact that never before had his mother called
  him Buck.</p>

  <p>To her it was a supreme surrender of his babyhood&mdash;to him it was
  merely his due. The Little Doctor sighed and watched him ride away beside
  Andy. "Children are such self-centred little beasts!" she told J. G.
  rue-fully. "I almost wish he was a girl."</p>

  <p>"Ay? If he was a girl he wouldn't git lost, maybe, but some feller'd take
  him away from yuh just the same. The Kid's all right. He's just the kind you
  expect him to be and want him to be. You're tickled to death because he's
  like he is. Doggone it, Dell, that Kid's got the real stuff in him! He's a
  dead ringer fer his dad&mdash;that ought to do yuh."</p>

  <p>"It does," the Little Doctor declared. "But it does seem as if he might be
  contented here with me for a little while&mdash;after such a horrible
  time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It wasn't horrible to him, yuh want to recollect. Doggone it, I wish that
  Blake would come back. You write to him, Dell, and tell him how things is
  stacking up. He oughta be here on the ground. No tellin' what them nesters'll
  build up next."</p>

  <p>So the Old Man slipped back into the old channels of worry and thought,
  just as life itself slips back after a stressful period. The little Doctor
  sighed again and sat down to write the letter and to discuss with the Old Man
  what she should say.</p>

  <p>There was a good deal to say. For one thing, more contests had been filed
  and more shacks built upon claims belonging to the Happy Family. She must
  tell Blake that. Also, Blake must help make some arrangement whereby the
  Happy Family could hire an outfit to gather their stock and the alien stock
  which they meant to drive back out of the Badlands. And there was Irish, who
  had quietly taken to the hills again as soon as the Kid returned. Blake was
  needed to look into that particular bit of trouble and try and discover just
  how serious it was. The man whom Irish had floored with a chair was
  apparently hovering close to death&mdash;and there were these who emphasized
  the adverb and asserted that the hurt was only apparent, but could prove
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"And you tell 'im," directed the Old Man querulously, "that I'll stand
  good for his time while he's lookin' after things for the boys. And tell 'im
  if he's so doggoned scared I'll buy into the game, he needn't to show up here
  at the ranch at all; tell him to stay in Dry Lake if he wants to&mdash;serve
  him right to stop at that hotel fer a while. But tell him for the Lord's sake
  git a move on. The way it looks to me, things is piling up on them boys till
  they can't hardly see over the top, and something's got to be done. Tell
  'im&mdash;here! Give me a sheet of paper and a pencil and I'll tell him a few
  things myself. Chances are you'd smooth 'em out too much, gitting 'em on
  paper. And the things I've got to say to Blake don't want any smoothing."</p>

  <p>The things he wrote painfully with his rheumatic hand were not smoothed
  for politeness' sake, and it made the Old Man feel better to get them off his
  mind. He read the letter over three times, and lingered over the most
  scathing sentences relishfully. He sent one of his new men to town for the
  express purpose of mailing that letter, and he felt a glow of satisfaction at
  actually speaking his mind upon the subject.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was just as well he did not know that Blake was in Dry Lake
  when the letter reached his office in Helena, and that it was forwarded to
  the place whence it had started. Blake was already "getting a move on," and
  he needed no such spur as the Old Man's letter. But the letter did the Old
  Man a lot of good, so that it served its purpose.</p>

  <p>Blake had no intention of handling the case from the Flying U porch, for
  instance. He had laid his plans quite independently of the Flying U outfit.
  He had no intention of letting Irish be arrested upon a trumped up charge,
  and he managed to send a word of warning to that hot-headed young man not to
  put himself in the way of any groping arm of the law; it was so much simpler
  than arrest and preliminary trial and bail, and all that. He had sent word to
  Weary to come and see him, before ever he received the Old Man's letter, and
  he had placed at Weary's disposal what funds would be needed for the
  immediate plans of the Happy Family. He had attended in person to the hauling
  of the fence material to their boundary line on the day he arrived and
  discovered by sheer accident that the stuff was still in the warehouse of the
  general store.</p>

  <p>After he did all that, the Honorable Blake received the Old Man's letter,
  read it through slowly and afterwards stroked down his Vandyke beard and
  laughed quietly to himself. The letter itself was both peremptory and
  profane, and commanded the Honorable Blake to do exactly what he had already
  done, and what he intended to do when the time came for the doing.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch22"
     id="ch22">XXII. &mdash; LAWFUL IMPROVEMENTS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Florence Grace Hallman must not be counted a woman without
  principle or kindness of heart or these qualities which make women beloved of
  men. She was a pretty nice young woman, unless one roused her antagonism. Had
  Andy Green, for instance, accepted in good faith her offer of a position with
  the Syndicate, he would have found her generous and humorous and loyal and
  kind. He would probably have fallen in love with her before the summer was
  over, and he would never have discovered in her nature that hardness and that
  ability for spiteful scheming which came to the surface and made the whole
  Happy Family look upon her as an enemy.</p>

  <p>Florence Grace Hillman was intensely human, as well as intensely loyal to
  her firm. She had liked Andy Green better than anyone&mdash;herself
  included&mdash;realized. It was not altogether her vanity that was hurt when
  she discovered how he had worked against her&mdash;how little her personality
  had counted with him. She felt chagrined and humiliated and as though nothing
  save the complete subjugation of Andy Green and the complete thwarting of his
  plans could ease her own hurt.</p>

  <p>Deep in her heart she hoped that he would eventually want her to forgive
  him his treachery. She would give him a good, hard fight&mdash;she would show
  him that she was mistress of the situation. She would force him to respect
  her as a foe; after that&mdash;Andy Green was human, certainly. She trusted
  to her feminine intuition to say just what should transpire after the fight;
  trusted to her feminine charm also to bring her whatever she might
  desire.</p>

  <p>That was the personal side of the situation. There was also the
  professional side, which urged her to do battle for the interests of her
  firm. And since both the personal and the professional aspects of the case
  pointed to the same general goal, it may be assumed that Florence Grace was
  prepared to make a stiff fight.</p>

  <p>Then Andy Green proceeded to fall in love with that sharp-tongued
  Rosemary Allen; and Rosemary Allen had no better taste than to let herself be
  lost and finally found by Andy, and had the nerve to show very plainly that
  she not only approved of his love but returned it. After that, Florence Grace
  was in a condition to stop at nothing&mdash;short of murder&mdash;that would
  defeat the Happy Family in their latest project.</p>

  <p>While all the Bear Paw country was stirred up over the lost child,
  Florence Grace Hillman said it was too bad, and had they found him yet? and
  went right along planting contestants upon the claims of the Happy Family.
  She encouraged the building of claim-shacks and urged firmness in holding
  possession of them. She visited the man whom Irish had knocked down with a
  bottle of whisky, and she had a long talk with him and with the doctor who
  attended him. She saw to it that the contest notices were served promptly
  upon the Happy Family, and she hurried in shipments of stock. Oh, she was
  very busy indeed, during the week that was spent in hunting the Kid. When he
  was found, and the rumor of an engagement between Rosemary Allen and that
  treacherous Andy Green reached her, she was busier still; but since she had
  changed her methods and was careful to mask her real purpose behind an air of
  passive resentment, her industry became less apparent.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family did not pay much attention to Florence Grace Hallman and
  her studied opposition. They were pretty busy attending to their own affairs;
  Andy Green was not only busy but very much in love, so that he almost forgot
  the existence of Florence Grace except on the rare occasions when he met her
  riding over the prairie trails.</p>

  <p>First of all they rounded up the stock that had been scattered, and they
  did not stop when they crossed Antelope Coulee with the settlers' cattle.
  They bedded them there until after dark. Then they drove them on to the
  valley of Dry Lake, crossed that valley on the train traveled road and pushed
  the herd up on Lonesome Prairie and out as far upon the benchland as they had
  time to drive them.</p>

  <p>They did not make much effort toward keeping it a secret. Indeed Weary
  told three or four of the most indignant settlers, next day, where they would
  find their cattle. But he added that the feed was pretty good back there, and
  advised them to leave the stock out there for the present.</p>

  <p>"It isn't going to do you fellows any good to rear up on your hind legs
  and make a holler," he said calmly. "We haven't hurt your cattle. We don't
  want to have trouble with anybody. But we're pretty sure to have a fine,
  large row with our neighbors if they don't keep on their own side of the
  fence."</p>

  <p>That fence was growing to be more than a mere figure of speech. The Happy
  Family did not love the digging of post-holes and the stretching of barbed
  wire; on the contrary they hated it so deeply that you could not get a civil
  word out of one of them while the work went on; yet they put in long hours at
  the fence-building.</p>

  <p>They had to take the work in shifts on account of having their own cattle
  to watch day and night. Sometimes it happened that a man tamped posts or
  helped stretch wire all day, and then stood guard two or three hours on the
  herd at night; which was wearing on the temper. Sometimes, because they were
  tired, they quarreled over small things.</p>

  <p>New shipments of cattle, too, kept coming to Dry Lake. Invariably these
  would be driven out towards Antelope Coulee&mdash;farther if the drivers
  could manage it&mdash;and would have to be driven back again with what
  patience the Happy Family could muster. No one helped them among the
  settlers. There was every attitude among the claim-dwellers, from open
  opposition to latent antagonism. None were quite neutral&mdash;and yet the
  Happy Family did not bother any save these who had filed contests to their
  claims, or who took active part in the cattle driving.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family were not half as brutal as they might have been. In spite
  of their no-trespassing signs they permitted settlers to drive across their
  claims with wagons and water-barrels, to haul water from One Man Creek when
  the springs and the creek in Antelope Coulee went dry.</p>

  <p>They did not attempt to move the shacks of the later contestants off their
  claims. Though they hated the sight of them and of the owners who bore
  themselves with such provocative assurance, they grudged the time the moving
  would take. Besides that the Honorable Blake had told them that moving the
  shacks would accomplish no real, permanent good. Within thirty days they must
  appear before the register and receiver and file answer to the contest, and
  he assured them that forbearance upon their part would serve to strengthen
  their case with the Commissioner.</p>

  <p>It goes to prove how deeply in earnest they were, that they immediately
  began to practice assiduously the virtues of mildness and forbearance. They
  could, he told them, postpone the filing of their answers until close to the
  end of the thirty days; which would serve also to delay the date of actual
  trial of the contests, and give the Happy Family more time for their
  work.</p>

  <p>Their plans had enlarged somewhat. They talked now of fencing the whole
  tract on all four sides, and of building a dam across the mouth of a certain
  coulee in the foothills which drained several miles of rough country, thereby
  converting the coulee into a reservoir that would furnish water for their
  desert claims. It would take work, of course; but the Happy Family were
  beginning to see prosperity on the trail ahead and nothing in the shape of
  hard work could stop them from coming to hand-grips with fortune.</p>

  <p>Chip helped them all he could, but he had the Flying U to look after, and
  that without the good team-work of the Happy Family which had kept things
  moving along so smoothly. The team-work now was being used in a different
  game; a losing game, one would say at first glance.</p>

  <p>So far the summer had been favorable to dry-farming. The more enterprising
  of the settlers had some grain and planted potatoes upon freshly broken soil,
  and these were growing apace. They did not know about these scorching August
  winds, that might shrivel crops in a day. They did not realize that early
  frosts might kill what the hot winds spared. They became enthusiastic over
  dry-farming, and their resentment toward the Happy family increased as their
  enthusiasm waxed strong. The Happy Family complained to one another that you
  couldn't pry a nester loose from his claim with a crowbar.</p>

  <p>In this manner did civilization march out and take possession of the high
  prairies that lay close to the Flying U. They had a Sunday School organized,
  with the meetings held in a double shack near the trail to Dry Lake. The
  Happy family, riding that way, sometimes heard voices mingled in the shrill
  singing of some hymn where, a year before, they had listened to the hunting
  song of the coyote.</p>

  <p>Eighty acres to the man&mdash;with that climate and that soil they never
  could make it pay; with that soil especially since it was mostly barren. The
  Happy Family knew it, and could find it in their hearts to pity the men who
  were putting in dollars and time and hard work there. But for obvious reasons
  they did not put their pity into speech.</p>

  <p>They fenced their west line in record time. There was only one gate in the
  whole length of it, and that was on the trail to Dry Lake. Not content with
  trusting to the warning of four strands of barbed wire stretched so tight
  that they hummed to the touch, they took turns in watching it&mdash;"riding
  fence," in range parlance&mdash;and in watching the settlers' cattle.</p>

  <p>To H. J. Owens and his fellow contestants they paid not the slightest
  attention, because the Honorable Blake had urged them personally to ignore
  any and all claimants. To Florence Grace Hallman they gave no heed, believing
  that she had done her worst, and that her worst was after all pretty weak,
  since the contests she had caused to be filed could not possibly be approved
  by the government so long as the Happy Family continued to abide by every law
  and by-law and condition and requirement in their present thorough-going and
  exemplary manner.</p>

  <p>You should have seen how mild-mannered and how industrious the Happy
  Family were, during these three weeks which followed the excitement of the
  Kid's adventuring into the wild. You would have been astonished, and you
  would have made the mistake of thinking that they had changed permanently and
  might be expected now to settle down with wives and raise families and hay
  and cattle and potatoes, and grow beards, perhaps, and become well-to-do
  ranchers.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family were almost convinced that they were actually leaving
  excitement behind them for good and all. They might hold back the encroaching
  tide of immigration from the rough land along the river&mdash;that sounded
  like something exciting, to be sure. But they must hold back the tide with
  legal proceedings and by pastoral pursuits, and that promised little in the
  way of brisk, decisive action and strong nerves and all these qualities which
  set the Happy Family somewhat apart from their fellows.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch23"
     id="ch23">XXIII. &mdash; THE WATER QUESTION AND SOME GOSSIP</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Rosemary Allen rode down into One Man Coulee and boldly
  up to the cabin of Andy Green, and shouted musically for him to come forth.
  Andy made a hasty pass at his hair with a brush, jerked his tie straight and
  came out eagerly. There was no hesitation in his manner. He went straight up
  to her and reached up to pull her from the saddle, that he might hold her in
  his arms and kiss her&mdash;after the manner of bold young men who are very
  much in love. But Miss Rosemary Allen stopped him with a push that was not
  altogether playful, and scowled at him viciously.</p>

  <p>"I am in a most furious mood today," she said. "I want to scratch
  somebody's eyes out! I want to say WORDS. Don't come close, or I might pull
  your hair or something, James." She called him James because that was not his
  name, and because she had learned a good deal about his past misdeeds and
  liked to take a sly whack at his notorious tendency to forget the truth, by
  calling him Truthful James.</p>

  <p>"All right; that suits me fine. It's worth a lot to have you close enough
  to pull hair. Where have you been all this long while?" Being a bold young
  man and very much in love, he kissed her in spite of her professed
  viciousness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've been to town&mdash;it hasn't been more than three days since we
  met and had that terrible quarrel, James. What was it about?" She frowned down
  at him thoughtfully. "I'm still furious about it&mdash;whatever it is. Do you
  know, Mr. Man, that I am an outlaw amongst my neighbors, and that our happy
  little household, up there on the hill, is a house divided against itself?
  I've put up a green burlap curtain on my southwest corner, and bought me a
  smelly oil stove and I pos-i-tively refuse to look at my neighbors or speak
  to them. I'm going to get some lumber and board up that side of my house.</p>

  <p>"Those three cats&mdash;they get together on the other side of my curtain
  and say the meanest things!"</p>

  <p>Andy Green had the temerity to laugh. "That sounds good to me," he told
  her unsympathetically. "Now maybe you'll come down and keep house for me and
  let that pinnacle go to thunder. It's no good anyway, and I told you so long
  ago. That whole eighty acres of yours wouldn't support a family of
  jackrabbits for a month. What&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And let those old hens say they drove me off? That Kate Price is the
  limit. The things she said to me you wouldn't believe. And it all started
  over my going with little Buck a few times to ride along your fence when you
  boys were busy. I consider that I had a perfect right to ride where I
  pleased. Of course they're furious anyway, because I don't side against you
  boys and&mdash;and all that. When&mdash;when they found out about&mdash;you
  and me, James, they said some pretty sarcastic things, but I didn't pay any
  attention to that. Poor old freaks, I expected them to be jealous, because
  nobody ever pays any attention to THEM. Kate Price is the worst&mdash;she's
  an old maid. The others have had husbands and can act superior.</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't mind the things they said then; I took that for granted.
  But a week or so ago Florence Hallman came, and she did stir things up in
  great style! Since then the girls have hardly spoken to me except to say
  something insulting. And Florence Grace came right out and called me a
  traitor; that was before little Buck and I took to 'riding fence' as you call
  it, for you boys. You imagine what they've been saying since then!"</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you care? You don't have to stay with them, and you know
  it. I'm just waiting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, but I'm no quitter, James. I'm going to hold down that claim now if
  I have to wear a sixshooter!" Her eyes twinkled at that idea. "Besides, I can
  stir them up now and then and get them to say things that are useful. For
  instance, Florence Hallman told Kate Price about that last trainload of
  cattle coming, and that they were going to cut your fence and drive them
  through in the night&mdash;and I stirred dear little Katie up so she couldn't
  keep still about that. And therefore&mdash;" She reached out and gave Andy
  Green's ear a small tweak&mdash;"somebody found out about it, and a lot of
  somebodies happened around that way and just quietly managed to give folks a
  hint that there was fine grass somewhere else. That saved a lot of horseflesh
  and words and work, didn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It sure did." Andy smiled up at her worshipfully. "Just the
  same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But listen here, nice, level-headed Katiegirl has lost her temper since
  then, and let out a little more that is useful knowledge to somebody. There's
  one great weak point in the character of Florence Hallman; maybe you have
  noticed it. She's just simply GOT to have somebody to tell things to, and she
  doesn't always show the best judgment in her choice of a
  confessional&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I've noticed that before," Andy Green admitted, and smiled reminiscently.
  "She sure does talk too much&mdash;for a lady that has so much up her
  sleeve."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;and she's been making a chum of Katie Price since she
  discovered what an untrustworthy creature I am. I did a little favor for
  Irish Mallory, James. I overheard Florence Grace talking to Kate about that
  man who is supposed to be at death's door. So I made a trip to Great Falls,
  if you please, and I scouted around and located the gentleman&mdash;well,
  anyway, I gave that nice, sleek little lawyer of yours a few facts that will
  let Irish come back to his claim."</p>

  <p>"Irish has been coming back to his claim pretty regular as it is," Andy
  informed her quietly. "Did you think he was hiding out, all this time?
  Why"&mdash;he laughed at her&mdash;"you talked to him yourself, one day, and
  thought it was Weary. Remember when you came over with the mail? That was
  Irish helping me string wire. He's been wearing Weary's hat and clothes and
  cultivating a twinkle to his eyes&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>"Why, I&mdash;well, anyway, that man they've been making a fuss over is
  just as well as you are, James. They only wanted to get Irish in jail and
  make a little trouble&mdash;pretty cheap warfare at that, if you want my
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well&mdash;what's the odds? While they're wasting time and energy
  that way, we're going right along doing what we've laid out to do. Say, do
  you know I'm kinda getting stuck on this ranch proposition. If I just had a
  housekeeper&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Miss Rosemary Allen seldom let him get beyond that point, and she
  interrupted him now by wrinkling her nose at him in a manner that made Andy
  Green forget altogether that he had begun a sentence upon a subject
  forbidden. Later she went back to her worries; she was a very persistent
  young woman.</p>

  <p>"I hope you boys are going to attend to that contest business right away,"
  she said, with a pucker between her eyes and not much twinkle in them.
  "There's something about that which I don't quite understand. I heard
  Florence Hallman and Kate talking yesterday about it going by default. Are
  you sure it's wise to put off filing your answers so long? When are you
  supposed to appear, James?"</p>

  <p>"Me? On or before the twenty-oneth day of July, my dear girl. They lumped
  us up and served us all on the same day&mdash;I reckon to save shoe-leather;
  therefore, inasmuch as said adverse parties have got over a week
  left&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'd better not take a chance, waiting till the last day in the
  afternoon," she warned him vaguely. "Maybe they think you've forgotten the
  date or something&mdash;but whatever they think, I believe they're counting
  on your not answering in time. I think Florence Hallman knows they haven't
  any real proof against you. I know she knows it. She's perfectly wild over
  the way you boys have stuck here and worked. And from what I can gather, she
  hasn't been able to scrape up the weentiest bit of evidence that the Flying U
  is backing you&mdash;and of course that is the only ground they could
  contest your claims on. So if it comes to trial, you'll all win; you're bound
  to. I told Kate Price so&mdash;and those other old hens, yesterday, and
  that's what we had the row over."</p>

  <p>"My money's on you, girl," Andy told her, grinning. "How are the
  wounded?"</p>

  <p>"The wounded? Oh, they've clubbed together this morning and are washing
  hankies and collars and things, and talking about me. And they have snouged
  every speck of water from the barrel&mdash;I paid my share for the hauling,
  too&mdash;and the man won't come again till day after tomorrow with more.
  Fifty cents a barrel, straight, he's charging now, James. And you boys with
  a great, big, long creekful of it that you can get right in and swim in! I've
  come over to borrow two water-bags of it, if you please, James. I never
  dreamed water was so precious. Florence Hallman ought to be made to lie on
  one of these dry claims she's fooled us into taking. I really don't know,
  James, what's going to become of some of these poor farmers. You knew, didn't
  you, that Mr. Murphy spent nearly two hundred dollars boring a well&mdash;and
  now it's so strong of alkali they daren't use a drop of it? Mr. Murphy is
  living right up to his name and nationality, since then. He's away back there
  beyond the Sands place, you know. He has to haul water about six miles.
  Believe me, James, Florence Hallman had better keep away from Murphy! I met
  him as I was coming out from town, and he called her a Jezebel!"</p>

  <p>"That's mild!" Andy commented dryly. "Get down, why don't you? I want you
  to take a look at the inside of my shack and see how bad I need a
  housekeeper&mdash;since you won't take my word for it. I hope every drop of
  water leaks outa these bags before you get home. I hope old Mister falls down
  and spills it. I've a good mind not to let you have any, anyway. Maybe you
  could be starved and tortured into coming down here where you belong."</p>

  <p>"Maybe I couldn't. I'll get me a barrel of my own, and hire Simpson to
  fill it four times a week, if you please! And I'll put a lid with a padlock
  on it, so Katie dear can't rob me in the night&mdash;and I'll use a whole
  quart at a time to wash dishes, and two quarts when I take a bath! I shall,"
  she asserted with much emphasis, "lie in luxury, James!"</p>

  <p>Andy laughed and waved his hand toward One Man Creek. "That's all
  right&mdash;but how would you like to have that running past your house, so
  you could wake up in the night and hear it go gurgle-gurgle? Wouldn't that
  be all right?"</p>

  <p>Rosemary Allen clasped her two gloved hands together and drew a long
  breath. "I should want to run out and stop it," she declared. "To think of
  water actually running around loose in this world!! And think of us up on
  that dry prairie, paying fifty cents a barrel for it&mdash;and a lot slopped
  out of the barrel on the road!" She glanced down into Andy's lovelighted
  eyes, and her own softened. She placed her hand on his shoulder and shook her
  head at him with a tender remonstrance.</p>

  <p>"I know, boy&mdash;but it isn't in me to give up anything I set out to do,
  any more than it is in you. You wouldn't like me half so well if I could just
  drop that claim and think no more about it. I've got enough money to commute,
  when the time comes, and I'll feel a lot better if I go through with it now
  I've started. And&mdash;James!" She smiled at him wistfully. "Even if it is
  only eighty acres, it will make good pasture, and&mdash;it will help some,
  won't it?"</p>

  <p>After that you could not expect Andy Green to do any more badgering or to
  discourage the girl. He did like her better for having grit and a mental
  backbone&mdash;and he found a way of telling her so and of making the
  assurance convincing enough.</p>

  <p>He filled her canvas water-bags and went with her to carry them, and he
  cheered her much with his aircastles. Afterwards he took the team and rustled
  a water-barrel and hauled her a barrel of water and gave Kate Price a
  stony-eyed stare when she was caught watching him superciliously; and in
  divers ways managed to make Miss Rosemary Allen feel that she was fighting a
  good fight and that the odds were all in her favor and in the favor of the
  Happy Family&mdash;and of Andy Green in particular. She felt that the spite
  of her three very near neighbors was really a matter to laugh over, and the
  spleen of Florence Hallman a joke.</p>

  <p>But for all that she gave Andy Green one last warning when he climbed up
  to the spring seat of the wagon and unwound the lines from the brake-handle,
  ready to drive back to his own work. She went close to the front wheel, so
  that eavesdroppers could not hear, and held her front hair from blowing
  across her earnest, windtanned face while she looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"Now remember, boy, do go and file your answer to those contests&mdash;all
  of you!" she urged. "I don't know why&mdash;but I've a feeling some kind of a
  scheme is being hatched to make you trouble on that one point. And if you see
  Buck, tell him I'll ride fence with him tomorrow again. If you realized how
  much I like that old cowpuncher, you'd be horribly jealous, James."</p>

  <p>"I'm jealous right now, without realizing a thing except that I've got to
  go off and leave you here with a bunch of lemons," he retorted&mdash;and he
  spoke loud enough so that any eavesdroppers might hear.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch24"
     id="ch24">XXIV. &mdash; THE KID IS USED FOR A PAWN IN THE GAME</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Did you ever stop to think of the tremendous moral lesson in
  the Bible tale of David and Goliath? And how great, human issues are often
  decided one way or the other by little things? Not all crises are passed in
  the clashing of swords and the boom of cannon. It was a pebble the size of
  your thumb end, remember, that slew the giant.</p>

  <p>In the struggle which the Happy Family was making to preserve the shrunken
  range of the Flying U, and to hold back the sweeping tide of immigration, one
  might logically look for some big, overwhelming element to turn the tide one
  way or the other. With the Homeseekers Syndicate backing the natural
  animosity of the settlers, who had filed upon semiarid land because the Happy
  Family had taken all of the tract that was tillable, a big, open clash might
  be considered inevitable.</p>

  <p>And yet the struggle was resolving itself into the question of whether the
  contest filings should be approved by the land-office, or the filings of the
  Happy Family be allowed to stand as having been made in good faith. Florence
  Hallman therefore, having taken upon herself the leadership in the contest
  fight, must do one of two things if she would have victory to salve the hurt
  to her self-esteem and to vindicate the firm's policy in the eyes of the
  settlers.</p>

  <p>She must produce evidence of the collusion of the Flying U outfit with the
  Happy Family, in the taking of the claims. Or she must connive to prevent the
  filing of answers to the contest notices within the time-limit fixed by law,
  so that the cases would go by default. That, of course, was the
  simplest&mdash;since she had not been able to gather any evidence of
  collusion that would stand in court.</p>

  <p>There was another element in the land struggle&mdash;that was the soil and
  climate that would fight inexorably against the settlers; but with them we
  have little to do, since the Happy Family had nothing to do with them save in
  a purely negative way.</p>

  <p>A four-wire fence and a systematic patrol along the line was having its
  effect upon the stock question. If the settlers drove their cattle south
  until they passed the farthest corner of Flying U fence, they came plump
  against Bert Rogers' barbed boundary line. West of that was his father's
  place&mdash;and that stretched to the railroad right-of-way, fenced on either
  side with a stock-proof barrier and hugging the Missouri all the way to the
  Marias&mdash;where were other settlers. If they went north until they passed
  the fence of the Happy Family, there were the Meeker holdings to bar the way
  to the very foot of Old Centennial, and as far up its sides as cattle would
  go.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family had planned wisely when they took their claims in a long
  chain that stretched across the benchland north of the Flying U. Florence
  Grace knew this perfectly well&mdash;but what could she prove? The Happy
  Family had bought cattle of their own, and were grazing them lawfully upon
  their own claims. A lawyer had assured her that there was no evidence to be
  gained there. They never went near J. G. Whitmore, nor did they make use of
  his wagons, his teams or his tools or his money; instead they hired what they
  needed, openly and from Bert Rogers. They had bought their cattle from the
  Flying U, and that was the extent of their business relations&mdash;on the
  surface. And since collusion had been the ground given for the contests, it
  will be easily seen what slight hope Florence Grace and her clients must have
  of winning any contest suit. Still, there was that alternative&mdash;the
  Happy Family had been so eager to build that fence and gather their cattle
  and put them back on the claims, and so anxious lest in their absence the
  settlers should slip cattle across the dead line and into the breaks, that
  they had postponed their trip to Great Falls as long as possible. The
  Honorable Blake had tacitly advised them to do so; and the Happy Family never
  gave a thought to their being hindered when they did get ready to attend to
  it.</p>

  <p>But&mdash;a pebble killed Goliath.</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens, whose eyes were the wrong shade of blue, sat upon a rocky
  hilltop which overlooked the trail from Flying U Coulee and a greater portion
  of the shack-dotted benchland as well, and swept the far horizons with his
  field glasses. Just down the eastern slope, where the jutting sandstone cast
  a shadow, his horse stood tied to a dejected wild-currant bush. He laid the
  glasses across his knees while he refilled his pipe, and tilted his hatbrim
  to shield his pale blue eyes from the sun that was sliding past midday.</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens looked at his watch, nevertheless, as though the position of
  the sun meant nothing to him. He scowled a little, stretched a leg straight
  out before him to ease it of cramp, and afterwards moved farther along in the
  shade. The wind swept past with a faint whistle, and laid the ripening
  grasses flat where it passed. A cloud shadow moved slowly along the slope
  beneath him, and he watched the darkening of the earth where it touched, and
  the sharp contrast of the sun-yellowed sea of grass all around it. H. J.
  Owens looked bored and sleepy; yet he did not leave the hilltop&mdash;nor did
  he go to sleep.</p>

  <p>Instead, he lifted the glasses, turned them toward Flying U Coulee a half
  mile to the south of him, and stared long at the trail. After a few minutes
  he made a gesture to lower the glasses, and then abruptly fixed them steadily
  upon one spot, where the trail wound up over the crest of the bluff. He
  looked for a minute, and laid the glasses down upon a rock.</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens fumbled in the pocket of his coat, which he had folded and
  laid beside him on the yellow gravel of the hill. He found something he
  wanted, stood up, and with his back against a boulder he faced to the
  southwest. He was careful about the direction. He glanced up at the sun,
  squinting his eyes at the glare; he looked at what he held in his hand.</p>

  <p>A glitter of sun on glass showed briefly. H. J. Owens laid his palm over
  it, waited while he could count ten, and took his palm away. Replaced it,
  waited, and revealed the glass again with the sun glare upon it full. He held
  it so for a full minute, and slid the glass back into his pocket.</p>

  <p>He glanced down toward Flying U Coulee again&mdash;toward where the trail
  stretched like a brown ribbon through the grass. He seemed to be in something
  of a hurry now&mdash;if impatient movement meant anything&mdash;yet he did
  not leave the place at once. He kept looking off there toward the
  southwest&mdash;off beyond Antelope Coulee and the sparsely dotted shacks of
  the settlers.</p>

  <p>A smudge of smoke rose thinly there, behind a hill. Unless one had been
  watching the place, one would scarcely have noticed it, but H. J. Owens saw
  it at once and smiled his twisted smile and went running down the hill to
  where his horse was tied. He mounted and rode down to the level, skirted the
  knoll and came out on the trail, down which he rode at an easy lope until he
  met the Kid.</p>

  <p>The Kid was going to see Rosemary Allen and take a ride with her along the
  new fence; but he pulled up with the air of condescension which was his usual
  attitude toward "nesters," and in response to the twisted smile of H. J.
  Owens he grinned amiably.</p>

  <p>"Want to go on a bear-hunt with me, Buck?" began H. J. Owens with just the
  right tone of comradeship, to win the undivided attention of the Kid.</p>

  <p>"I was goin' to ride fence with Miss Allen," the Kid declined regretfully.
  "There ain't any bears got very close, there ain't. I guess you musta
  swallered something Andy told you." He looked at H. J. Owens tolerantly.</p>

  <p>"No sir. I never talked to Andy about this." Had he been perfectly
  truthful he would have added that he had not talked with Andy about anything
  whatever, but he let it go. "This is a bear den I found myself; There's two
  little baby cubs, Buck, and I was wondering if you wouldn't like to go along
  and get one for a pet. You could learn it to dance and play soldier, and all
  kinds of stunts."</p>

  <p>The Kid's eyes shone, but he was wary. This man was a nester, so it would
  be just at well to be careful. "Where 'bouts is it?" he therefore demanded in
  a tone of doubt that would have done credit to Happy Jack.</p>

  <p>"Oh, down over there in the hills. It's a secret, though, till we get them
  out. Some fellows are after them for themselves, Buck. They want
  to&mdash;skin 'em."</p>

  <p>"The mean devils!" condemned the Kid promptly. "I'd take a fall outa them
  if I ketched 'em skinning any baby bear cubs while I was around."</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens glanced behind him with an uneasiness not altogether
  assumed.</p>

  <p>"Let's go down into this next gully to talk it over, Buck," he suggested
  with an air of secretiveness that fired the Kid's imagination. "They started
  out to follow me, and I don't want 'em to see me talking to you, you
  know."</p>

  <p>The Kid went with him unsuspectingly. In all the six years of his life, no
  man had ever offered him injury. Fear had not yet become associated with
  those who spoke him fair. Nesters he did not consider friends because they
  were not friends with his bunch. Personally he did not know anything about
  enemies. This man was a nester&mdash;but he called him Buck, and he talked
  very nice and friendly, and he said he knew where there were some little baby
  bear cubs. The Kid had never before realized how much he wanted a bear cub
  for a pet. So do our wants grow to meet our opportunities.</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens led the way into a shallow draw between two low hills,
  glancing often behind him and around him until they were shielded by the
  higher ground. He was careful to keep where the grass was thickest and would
  hold no hoofprints to betray them, but the Kid never noticed. He was thinking
  how nice it would be to have a bear cub for a pet. But it was funny that the
  Happy Family had never found him one, if there were any in the country.</p>

  <p>He turned to put the question direct to H. J. Owens, but that gentleman
  forestalled him.</p>

  <p>"You wait here a minute, Buck, while I ride back on this hill a little
  ways to see if those fellows are on our trail," he said, and rode off before
  the Kid could ask him the question.</p>

  <p>The Kid waited obediently. He saw H. J. Owens get off his horse and go
  sneaking up to the brow of the hill, and take some field glasses out of his
  pocket and look all around over the prairie with them. The sight tingled the
  Kid's blood so that he almost forgot about the bear cub. It was almost
  exactly like fighting Injuns, like Uncle Gee-gee told about when he wasn't
  cross.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes Owens came back to the Kid, and they went on slowly,
  keeping always in the low, grassy places where there would be no tracks left
  to tell of their passing that way. Behind them a yellow-brown cloud drifted
  sullenly with the wind. Now and then a black flake settled past them to the
  ground. A peculiar, tangy smell was in the air&mdash;the smell of burning
  grass.</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens related a long, full-detailed account of how he had been down
  in the hills along the river, and had seen the old mother bear digging ants
  out of a sand-hill for her cubs.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;that's jes' 'zactly the way they do!" the Kid interrupted
  excitedly. "Daddy Chip seen one doing it on the Musselshell one time. He told
  me 'bout it."</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens glanced sidelong at the Kid's flushed face, smiled his twisted
  smile and went on with his story. He had not bothered them, he said, because
  he did not have any way of carrying both cubs, and he hated to kill them. He
  had thought of Buck, and how he would like a pet cub, so he had followed the
  bear to her den and had come away to get a sack to carry them in, and to tell
  Buck about it.</p>

  <p>The Kid never once doubted that it was so. Whenever any of the Happy
  Family found anything in the hills that was nice, they always thought of
  Buck, and they always brought it to him. You would be amazed at the number of
  rattlesnake rattles, and eagle's claws, and elk teeth, and things like that,
  which the Kid possessed and kept carefully stowed away in a closet kept
  sacred to his uses.</p>

  <p>"'Course you'd 'member I wanted a baby bear cub for a pet," he assented
  gravely and with a certain satisfaction. "Is it a far ways to that mother
  bear's home?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" H. J. Owens turned from staring at the rolling smoke cloud, and
  looked at the Kid curiously. "Ain't you big enough to ride far?"</p>

  <p>"'Course I'm big enough." The Kid's pride was touched. "I can ride as far
  as a horse can travel. I bet I can ride farther and faster 'n you can, you
  pilgrim." He eyed the other disdainfully. "Huh! You can't ride. When you trot
  you go this way!" The Kid kicked Silver into a trot and went bouncing along
  with his elbows flapping loosely in imitation of H. J. Owens' ungraceful
  riding.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to go a far ways," he explained when the other was again
  riding alongside, "'cause Doctor Dell would cry if I didn't come back to
  supper. She cried when I was out huntin' the bunch. Doctor Dell gets lonesome
  awful easy." He looked over his shoulder uneasily. "I guess I better go back
  and tell her I'm goin' to git a baby bear cub for a pet," he said, and reined
  Silver around to act upon the impulse.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;don't do that, Buck." H. J. Owens pulled his horse in front of
  Silver. "It isn't far&mdash;just a little ways. And it would be fun to
  surprise them at the ranch. Gee! When they saw you ride up with a pet bear cub
  in your arms&mdash;" H. J. Owens shook his head as though he could not find
  words to express the surprise of the Kid's family.</p>

  <p>The Kid smiled his Little Doctor smile. "I'd tell a man!" he assented
  enthusiastically. "I bet the Countess would holler when she seen it. She
  scares awful easy. She's scared of a mice, even! Huh! My kitty ketched a mice
  and she carried it right in her mouth and brought it into the kitchen and let
  it set down on the floor a minute, and it started to run away&mdash;the mice
  did. And it runned right up to the Countess, and she jes' hollered and yelled.
  And she got right up and stood on a chair and hollered for Daddy Chip to come
  and ketch that mice. He didn't do it though. Adeline ketched it herself. And
  I took it away from her and put it in a box for a pet. I wasn't scared."</p>

  <p>"She'll be scared when she sees the bear cub," H. J. Owens declared
  absent-mindedly. "I know you won't be, though. If we hurry maybe we can watch
  how he digs ants for his supper. That's lots of fun, Buck."</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I 'member it's fun to watch baby bear cubs dig ants," the Kid
  assented earnestly, and followed willingly where H. J. Owens led the way.</p>

  <p>That the way was far did not impress itself upon the Kid, beguiled with
  wonderful stories of how baby bear cubs might be taught to do tricks. He
  listened and believed, and invented some very wonderful tricks that he meant
  to teach his baby bear cub. Not until the shadows began to fill the gullies
  through which they rode did the Kid awake to the fact that night was coming
  close and that they were still traveling away from home and in a direction
  which was strange to him. Never in his life had he been tricked by any one
  with unfriendly intent. He did not guess that he was being tricked now. He
  rode away into the wild places in search of a baby bear cub for a pet.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch25"
     id="ch25">XXV. &mdash; "LITTLE BLACK SHACK'S ALL BURNT UP"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is a penitentiary offense for anyone to set fire to
  prairie grass or timber; and if you know the havoc which one blazing match
  may work upon dry grassland when the wind is blowing free, you will not
  wonder at the penalty for lighting that match with deliberate intent to set
  the prairie afire.</p>

  <p>Within five minutes after H. J. Owens slipped the bit of mirror back into
  his pocket after flashing a signal that the Kid was riding alone upon the
  trail, a line of fire several rods long was creeping up out of a grassy
  hollow to the hilltop beyond, whence it would go racing away to the east and
  the north, growing bigger and harder to fight with every grass tuft it fed
  on.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family were working hard that day upon the system of irrigation
  by which they meant to reclaim and make really valuable their desert claims.
  They happened to be, at the time when the fire was started, six or seven
  miles away, wrangling over the best means of getting their main ditch around
  a certain coulee without building a lot of expensive flume. A surveyor would
  have been a blessing, at this point in the undertaking; but a surveyor
  charged good money for his services, and the Happy Family were trying to be
  very economical with money; with time, and effort, and with words they were
  not so frugal.</p>

  <p>The fire had been burning for an hour and had spread so alarmingly before
  the gusty breeze that it threatened several claim-shacks before they noticed
  the telltale, brownish tint to the sunlight and smelled other smoke than the
  smoke of the word-battle then waging fiercely among them. They dropped
  stakes, flags and ditch-level and ran to where their horses waited sleepily
  the pleasure of their masters.</p>

  <p>They reached the level of the benchland to see disaster swooping down upon
  them like a race-horse. They did not stop then to wonder how the fire had
  started, or why it had gained such headway. They raced their horses after
  sacks, and after the wagon and team and water barrels with which to fight the
  flames. For it was not the claim-shacks in its path which alone were
  threatened. The grass that was burning meant a great deal to the stock, and
  therefore to the general welfare of every settler upon that bench, be he
  native or newcomer.</p>

  <p>Florence Grace Hallman had, upon one of her periodical visits among her
  "clients," warned them of the danger of prairie fires and urged them to plow
  and burn guards around all their buildings. A few of the settlers had done so
  and were comparatively safe in the face of that leaping, red line. But there
  were some who had delayed&mdash;and these must fight now if they would
  escape.</p>

  <p>The Happy Family, to a man, had delayed; rather they had not considered
  that there was any immediate danger from fire; it was too early in the season
  for the grass to be tinder dry, as it would become a month or six weeks
  later. They were wholly unprepared for the catastrophe, so far as any
  expectation of it went. But for all that they knew exactly what to do and how
  to go about doing it, and they did not waste a single minute in meeting the
  emergency.</p>

  <p>While the Kid was riding with H. J. Owens into the hills, his friends, the
  bunch, were riding furiously in the opposite direction. And that was exactly
  what had been planned beforehand. There was an absolute certainty in the
  minds of those who planned that it would be so. Florence Grace Hallman, for
  instance, knew just what would furnish complete occupation for the minds and
  the hands of the Happy Family and of every other man in that neighborhood,
  that afternoon. Perhaps a claim-shack or two would go up in smoke and some
  grass would burn. But when one has a stubborn disposition and is fighting for
  prestige and revenge and the success of one's business, a shack or two and a
  few acres of prairie grass do not count for very much.</p>

  <p>For the rest of that afternoon the boys of the Flying U fought side by
  side with hated nesters and told the inexperienced how best to fight. For the
  rest of that afternoon no one remembered the Kid, or wondered why H. J. Owens
  was not there in the grimy line of fire-fighters who slapped doggedly at the
  leaping flames with sacks kept wet from the barrels of water hauled here and
  there as they were needed. No one had time to call the roll and see who was
  missing among the settlers. No one dreamed that this mysterious fire that had
  crept up out of a coulee and spread a black, smoking blanket over the hills
  where it passed, was nothing more nor less than a diversion while a greater
  crime was being committed behind their backs.</p>

  <p>In spite of them the fire, beaten out of existence at one point, gained
  unexpected fury elsewhere and raced on. In spite of them women and children
  were in actual danger of being burned to death, and rushed weeping from
  flimsy shelter to find safety in the nearest barren coulee. The sick lady
  whom the Little Doctor had been tending was carried out on her bed and laid
  upon the blackened prairie, hysterical from the fright she had received. The
  shack she had lately occupied smoked while the tarred paper on the roof
  crisped and curled; and then the whole structure burst into flames and sent
  blazing bits of paper and boards to spread the fire faster.</p>

  <p>Fire guards which the inexperienced settlers thought safe were jumped
  without any perceptible check upon the flames. The wind was just right for
  the fanning of the fire. It shifted now and then erratically and sent the
  yellow line leaping in new directions. Florence Grace Hallman was in Dry Lake
  that day, and she did not hear until after dark how completely her little
  diversion had been a success; how more than half of her colony had been left
  homeless and hungry upon the charred prairie. Florence Grace Hallman would
  not have relished her supper, I fear, had the news reached her earlier in the
  evening.</p>

  <p>At Antelope Coulee the Happy Family, and such of the settlers as they could
  muster hastily for the fight, made a desperate stand against the common
  enemy. Flying U Coulee was safe, thanks to the permanent fire-guards which
  the Old Man maintained year after year as a matter of course. But there were
  the claims of the Happy Family and all the grassland east of there which must
  be saved.</p>

  <p>Men drove their work horses at a gallop after plows, and when they had
  brought them they lashed the horses into a trot while they plowed crooked
  furrows in the sun-baked prairie sod, just over the eastern rim of Antelope
  Coulee. The Happy Family knelt here and there along the fresh-turned sod, and
  started a line of fire that must beat up against the wind until it met the
  flames, rushing before it. Backfiring is always a more or less ticklish
  proceeding, and they would not trust the work to strangers.</p>

  <p>Every man of them took a certain stretch of furrow to watch, and ran
  backward and forward with blackened, frayed sacks to beat out the wayward
  flames that licked treacherously through the smallest break in the line of
  fresh soil. They knew too well the danger of those little, licking flame
  tongues; not one was left to live and grow and race leaping away through the
  grass.</p>

  <p>They worked&mdash;heavens, how they worked!&mdash;and they stopped the
  fire there on the rim of Antelope Coulee. Florence Grace Hallman would have
  been sick with fury, had she seen that dogged line of fighters, and the
  ragged hem of charred black ashes against the yellow-brown, which showed how
  well those men whom she hated had fought.</p>

  <p>So the fire was stopped well outside the fence which marked the boundary
  of the Happy Family's claims. All west of there and far to the north the
  hills and the coulees lay black as far as one could see&mdash;which was to
  the rim of the hills which bordered Dry Lake valley on the east. Here and
  there a claim-shack stood forlorn amid the blackness. Here and there a heap
  of embers still smoked and sent forth an occasional spitting of sparks when a
  gust fanned the heap. Men, women and children stood about blankly or wandered
  disconsolately here and there, coughing in the acrid clouds of warm grass
  cinders kicked up by their own lagging feet.</p>

  <p>No one missed the Kid. No one dreamed that he was lost again. Chip was
  with the Happy Family and did not know that the Kid had left the ranch that
  afternoon. The Little Doctor had taken it for granted that he had gone with
  his daddy, as he so frequently did; and with his daddy and the whole Happy
  Family to look after him, she never once doubted that he was perfectly safe,
  even among the fire-fighters. She supposed he would be up on the seat beside
  Patsy, probably, proudly riding on the wagon that hauled the water
  barrels.</p>

  <p>The Little Doctor had troubles of her own to occupy her mind. She had
  ridden hurriedly up the hill and straight to the shack of the sick woman,
  when first she discovered that the prairie was afire. And she had found the
  sick woman lying on a makeshift bed on the smoking, black area that was
  pathetically safe now from fire because there was nothing more to burn.</p>

  <p>"Little black shack's all burnt up! Everything's black now. Black hills,
  black hollows, black future, black world, black hearts&mdash;everything
  matches&mdash;everything's black. Sky's black, I'm black&mdash;you're
  black&mdash;little black shack won't have to stand all alone any
  more&mdash;little black shack's just black ashes&mdash;little black shack's
  all burnt up!" And then the woman laughed shrilly, with that terrible,
  meaningless laughter of hysteria.</p>

  <p>She was a pretty woman, and young. Her hair was that bright shade of red
  that goes with a skin like thin, rose-tinted ivory. Her eyes were big and so
  dark a blue that they sometimes looked black, and her mouth was sweet and had
  a tired droop to match the mute pathos of her eyes. Her husband was a coarse
  lout of a man who seldom spoke to her when they were together. The Little
  Doctor had felt that all the tragedy of womanhood and poverty and loneliness
  was synthesized in this woman with the unusual hair and skin and eyes and
  expression. She had been coming every day to see her; the woman was rather
  seriously ill, and needed better care than she could get out there on the
  bald prairie, even with the Little Doctor to watch over her. If she died her
  face would haunt the Little Doctor always. Even if she did not die she would
  remain a vivid memory. Just now even the Little Doctor's mother instinct was
  submerged under her professional instincts and her woman sympathy. She did
  not stop to wonder whether she was perfectly sure that the Kid was with Chip.
  She took it for granted and dismissed the Kid from her mind, and worked to
  save the woman.</p>

  <p>Yes, the little diversion of a prairie fire that would call all hands to
  the westward so that the Kid might be lured away in another direction without
  the mishap of being seen, proved a startling success. As a diversion it could
  scarcely be improved upon&mdash;unless Florence Grace Hallman had ordered a
  wholesale massacre or something like that.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch26"
     id="ch26">XXVI. &mdash; ROSEMARY ALLEN DOES A SMALL SUM IN
     ADDITION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Miss Rosemary Allen, having wielded a wet gunny sack until
  her eyes were red and smarting and her lungs choked with cinders and her arms
  so tired she could scarcely lift them, was permitted by fate to be almost the
  first person who discovered that her quarter of the four-room shack built
  upon the four contiguous corners of four claims, was afire in the very middle
  of its roof. Miss Rosemary Allen stood still and watched it burn, and was a
  trifle surprised because she felt so little regret.</p>

  <p>Other shacks had caught fire and burned hotly, and she had wept with
  sympathy for the owners. But she did not weep when her own shack began to
  crackle and show yellow, licking tongues of flame. Those three old
  cats&mdash;I am using her own term, which was spiteful&mdash;would probably
  give up now, and go back where they belonged. She hoped so. And for
  herself&mdash;</p>

  <p>"By gracious, I'm glad to see that one go, anyhow!" Andy Green paused long
  enough in his headlong gallop to shout to her. "I was going to sneak up and
  touch it off myself, if it wouldn't start any other way. Now you and me'll
  get down to cases, girl, and have a settlement. And say!" He had started on,
  but he pulled up again. "The Little Doctor's back here, somewhere. You go
  home with her when she goes, and stay till I come and get you."</p>

  <p>"I like your nerve!" Rosemary retorted ambiguously.</p>

  <p>"Sure&mdash;folks generally do. I'll tell her to stop for you. You know
  she'll be glad enough to have you&mdash;and so will the Kid."</p>

  <p>"Where is Buck?" Rosemary was the first person who asked that question. "I
  saw him ride up on the bench just before the fire started. I was watching for
  him, through the glasses&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dunno&mdash;haven't seen him. With his mother, I guess." Andy rode on to
  find Patsy and send him back down the line with the water wagon. He did not
  think anything more about the Kid, though he thought a good deal about Miss
  Allen.</p>

  <p>Now that her shack was burned, she would be easier to persuade into giving
  up that practically worthless eighty. That was what filled the mind of Andy
  Green to the exclusion of everything else except the fire. He was in a hurry
  to deliver his message to Patsy, so that he could hunt up the Little Doctor
  and speak her hospitality for the girl he meant to marry just as soon as he
  could persuade her to stand with him before a preacher.</p>

  <p>He found the Little Doctor still fighting a dogged battle with death for
  the life of the woman who laughed wildly because her home was a heap of
  smoking embers. The Little Doctor told him to send Rosemary Allen on down to
  the ranch, or take her himself, and to tell the Countess to send up her
  biggest medicine case immediately. She could not leave, she said, for some
  time yet. She might have to stay all night&mdash;or she would if there was
  any place to stay. She was half decided, she said, to have someone take the
  woman in to Dry Lake right away, and up to the hospital in Great Falls. She
  supposed she would have to go along. Would Andy tell J. G. to send up some
  money? Clothes didn't matter&mdash;she would go the way she was; there were
  plenty of clothes in the stores, she declared. And would Andy rustle a team,
  right away, so they could start? If they went at all they ought to catch the
  evening train. The Little Doctor was making her decisions and her plans while
  she talked, as is the way with those strong natures who can act promptly and
  surely in the face of an emergency.</p>

  <p>By the time she had thought of having a team come right away, she had
  decided that she would not wait for her medicine-case or for money. She could
  get all the money she needed in Dry Lake; and she had her little emergency
  case with her. Since she was going to take the woman to a hospital, she said,
  there was no great need of more than she had with her. She was a thoughtful
  Little Doctor. At the last minute she detained Andy long enough to urge him
  to see that Miss Allen helped herself to clothes or anything she needed; and
  to send a goodbye message to Chip&mdash;in case he did not show up before she
  left&mdash;and a kiss to her man-child.</p>

  <p>Andy was lucky. He met a man driving a good team and spring wagon, with a
  barrel of water in the back. He promptly dismounted and helped the man unload
  the water-barrel where it was, and sent him bumping swiftly over the burned
  sod to where the Little Doctor waited. So Fate was kinder to the Little
  Doctor than were those who would wring anew the mother heart of her that
  their own petty schemes might succeed. She went away with the sick woman
  laughing crazily because all the little black shacks were burned and now
  everything was black so everything matched nicely&mdash;nicely, thank you.
  She was terribly worried over the woman's condition, and she gave herself
  wholly to her professional zeal and never dreamed that her man-child was at
  that moment riding deeper and deeper into the Badlands with a tricky devil of
  a man, looking for a baby bear cub for a pet.</p>

  <p>Neither did Chip dream it, nor any of the Happy Family, nor even Miss
  Rosemary Allen, until they rode down into Flying U Coulee at supper-time and
  were met squarely by the fact that the Kid was not there. The Old Man threw
  the bomb that exploded tragedy in the midst of the little group. He heard
  that "Dell" had gone to take a sick woman to the hospital in Great Falls, and
  would not be back for a day or so, probably.</p>

  <p>"What'd she do with the Kid?" he demanded. "Take him with her?"</p>

  <p>Chip stared blankly at him, and turned his eyes finally to Andy's face.
  Andy had not mentioned the Kid to him.</p>

  <p>"He wasn't with her," Andy replied to the look. "She sent him a kiss and
  word that he was to take care of Miss Allen. He must be somewhere around
  here."</p>

  <p>"Well, he ain't. I was looking fer him myself," put in the Countess
  sharply. "Somebody shut the cat up in the flour chest and I didn't study much
  on what it was done it! If I'd a got my hands on 'im&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I saw him ride up on the hill trail just before the fire started,"
  volunteered Rosemary Allen. "I had my opera glasses and was looking for him,
  because I like to meet him and hear him talk. He said yesterday that he was
  coming to see me today. And he rode up on the hill in sight of my claim. I
  saw him." She stopped and looked from one to the other with her eyebrows
  pinched together and her lips pursed.</p>

  <p>"Listen," she went on hastily. "Maybe it has nothing to do with
  Buck&mdash;but I saw something else that was very puzzling. I was going to
  investigate, but the fire broke out immediately and put everything else out
  of my mind. A man was up on that sharp-pointed knoll off east of the trail
  where it leaves this coulee, and he had field glasses and was looking for
  something over this way. I thought he was watching the trail. I just caught
  him with the glasses by accident as I swung them over the edge of the
  benchland to get the trail focused. He was watching something&mdash;because I
  kept turning the glasses on him to see what he was doing.</p>

  <p>"Then Buck came into sight, and I started to ride out and meet him. I hate
  to leave the little mite riding alone anywhere&mdash;I'm always afraid
  something may happen. But before I got on my horse I took another look at
  this man on the hill. He had a mirror or something bright in his hands. I saw
  it flash, just exactly as though he was signaling to someone&mdash;over that
  way." She pointed to the west. "He kept looking that way, and then back this
  way; and he covered up the piece of mirror with his hand and then took it
  off and let it shine a minute, and put it in his pocket. I know he was making
  signals.</p>

  <p>"I got my horse and started to meet little Buck. He was coming along the
  trail and rode into a little hollow out of sight. I kept looking and looking
  toward Dry Lake&mdash;because the man looked that way, I guess. And in a few
  minutes I saw the smoke of the fire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who was that man?" Andy took a step toward her, his eyes hard and bright
  in their inflamed lids.</p>

  <p>"The man? That Mr. Owens who jumped your south eighty."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, what fools!" He brushed past her without a look or another
  word, so intent was he upon this fresh disaster. "I'm going after the boys,
  Chip. You better come along and see if you can pick up the Kid's trail where
  he left the road. It's too bad Florence Grace Hallman ain't a man! I'd know
  better what to do if she was."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you think&mdash;?" Miss Rosemary looked at him wide-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Doggone it, if she's tried any of her schemes with fire and&mdash;why,
  doggone it, being a woman ain't going to help her none!" The Old Man, also,
  seemed to grasp the meaning of it almost as quickly as had Andy. "Chip, you
  have Ole hitch up the team. I'm going to town myself, by thunder, and see if
  she's going to play any of her tricks on this outfit and git away with it!
  Burnt out half her doggoned colony tryin' to git a whack at you boys! Where's
  my shoes? Doggone it, what yuh all standin' round with your jaws hangin' down
  for? We'll see about this fire-settin' and this&mdash;where's them
  shoes?"</p>

  <p>The Countess found his shoes, and his hat, and his second-best coat and
  his driving gloves which he had not worn for more months than anyone cared to
  reckon. Miss Rosemary Allen did what she could to help, and wondered at the
  dominant note struck by this bald old man from the moment when he rose
  stiffly from his big chair and took the initiative so long left to
  others.</p>

  <p>While the team was being made ready the Old Man limped here and there,
  collecting things he did not need and trying to remember what he must have,
  and keeping the Countess moving at a flurried trot. Chip and Andy were not
  yet up the bluff when the Old Man climbed painfully into the covered buggy,
  took the lines and the whip and cut a circle with the wheels on the
  hard-packed earth as clean and as small as Chip himself could have done, and
  went whirling through the big gate and across the creek and up the long slope
  beyond. He shouted to the boys and they rode slowly until he overtook
  them&mdash;though their nerves were all on edge and haste seemed to them the
  most important thing in the world. But habit is strong&mdash;it was their Old
  Man who called to them to wait.</p>

  <p>"You boys wait to git out after that Owens," he shouted when he passed
  them. "If they've got the Kid, killing's too good for 'em!" The brown team
  went trotting up the grade with back straightened to the pull of the lurching
  buggy, and nostrils flaring wide with excitement. The Old Man leaned sidewise
  and called back to the two loping after him in the obscuring dust-cloud he
  left behind.</p>

  <p>"I'll have that woman arrested on suspicion uh setting prairie fires!" he
  called. "I'll git Blake after her. You git that Owens if you have to haze him
  to hell and back! Yuh don't want to worry about the Kid, Chip&mdash;they
  ain't goin' to hurt him. All they want is to keep you boys huntin' high and
  low and combin' the breaks to find 'im. I see their scheme, all right."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch27"
     id="ch27">XXVII. &mdash; "ITS AWFUL EASY TO GET LOST"</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The Kid wriggled uncomfortably in the saddle and glanced at
  the narrow-browed face of H. J. Owens, who was looking this way and that at
  the enfolding hills and scowling abstractedly. The Kid was only six, but he
  was fairly good at reading moods and glances, having lived all his life
  amongst grown-ups.</p>

  <p>"It's a pretty far ways to them baby bear cubs," he remarked. "I bet
  you're lost, old-timer. It's awful easy to get lost. I bet you don't know
  where that mother-bear lives."</p>

  <p>"You shut up!" snarled H. J. Owens. The Kid had hit uncomfortably close to
  the truth.</p>

  <p>"You shut up your own self, you darned pilgrim," the Kid flung back
  instantly. That was the way he learned to say rude things; they were said to
  him and he remembered and gave them back in full measure.</p>

  <p>"Say, I'll slap you if you call me that again." H. J. Owens, because he
  did not relish the task he had undertaken, and because he had lost his
  bearing here in the confusion of hills and hollows and deep gullies, was in a
  very bad humor.</p>

  <p>"You darn pilgrim, you dassent slap me. If you do the bunch'll fix you,
  all right. I guess they'd just about kill you. Daddy Chip would just knock
  the stuffin' outa you." He considered something very briefly, and then tilted
  his small chin so that he looked more than ever like the Little Doctor. "I
  bet you was just lying all the time," he accused. "I bet there ain't any baby
  bear cubs."</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens laughed disagreeably, but he did not say whether or not the
  Kid was right in his conjecture. The Kid pinched his lips together and winked
  very fast for a minute. Never, never in all the six years of his life had
  anyone played him so shabby a trick. He knew what the laugh meant; it meant
  that this man had lied to him and led him away down here in the hills where
  he had promised his Doctor Dell, cross-his-heart, that he would never go
  again. He eyed the man resentfully.</p>

  <p>"What made you lie about them baby bear cubs?" he demanded. "I didn't want
  to come such a far ways."</p>

  <p>"You keep quiet. I've heard about enough from you, young man. A little
  more of that and you'll get something you ain't looking for."</p>

  <p>"I'm a going home!" The Kid pulled Silver half around in the grassy gulch
  they were following. "And I'm going to tell the bunch what you said. I bet
  the bunch'll make you hard to ketch, you&mdash;you son-agun!"</p>

  <p>"Here! You come back here, young man!" H. J. Owens reached over and caught
  Silver's bridle. "You don't go home till I let you go, see. You're going
  right along with me, if anybody should ask you. And you ain't going to talk
  like that, either. Now, mind!" He turned his pale blue eyes threateningly upon
  the Kid. "Not another word out of you if you don't want a good thrashing. You
  come along and behave yourself or I'll cut your ears off."</p>

  <p>The Kid's eyes blazed with anger. He did not flinch while he glared back
  at the man, and he did not seem to care, just at that moment, whether he lost
  his ears or kept them. "You let go my horse!" he gritted. "You wait. The
  bunch'll fix YOU, and fix you right. You wait!"</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens hesitated, tempted to lay violent hands upon the small rebel.
  But he did not. He led Silver a rod or two, found it awkward, since the way
  was rough and he was not much of a horseman, and in a few minutes let the
  rein drop from his fingers.</p>

  <p>"You come on, Buck, and be a good boy&mdash;and maybe we'll find them cubs
  yet," he conciliated. "You'd die a-laughing at the way they set up and
  scratch their ears when a big, black ant bites 'em, Buck. I'll show you in a
  little while. And there's a funny camp down here, too, where we can get some
  supper."</p>

  <p>The Kid made no reply, but he rode along docilely beside H. J. Owens and
  listened to the new story he told of the bears. That is, he appeared to be
  listening; in reality he was struggling to solve the biggest problem he had
  ever known&mdash;the problem of danger and of treachery. Poor little tad, he
  did not even know the names of his troubles. He only knew that this man had
  told him a lie about those baby bear cubs, and had brought him away down here
  where he had been lost, and that it was getting dark and he wanted to go home
  and the man was mean and would not let him go. He did not understand why the
  man should be so mean&mdash;but the man was mean to him, and he did not
  intend to "stand for it." He wanted to go home. And when the Kid really
  wanted to do a certain thing, he nearly always did it, as you may have
  observed.</p>

  <p>H. J. Owens would not let him go home; therefore the Kid meant to go
  anyway. Only he would have to sneak off, or run off, or something, and hide
  where the man could not find him, and then go home to his Doctor Dell and
  Daddy Chip, and tell them how mean this pilgrim had been to him. And he would
  tell the bunch. The bunch would fix him all right! The thought cheered the Kid
  so that he smiled and made the man think he was listening to his darned old
  bear story that was just a big lie. Think he would listen to any story that
  pilgrim could tell? Huh!</p>

  <p>The gulches were growing dusky now. The Kid was tired, and he was hungry
  and could hardly keep from crying, he was so miserable. But he was the son of
  his father&mdash;he was Chip's kid; it would take a great deal more misery
  and unkindness to make him cry before this pilgrim who had been so mean to
  him. He rode along without saying a word. H. J. Owens did not say anything,
  either. He kept scanning each jagged peak and each gloomy canyon as they
  passed, and he seemed uneasy about something. The Kid knew what it was, all
  right; H. J. Owens was lost.</p>

  <p>They came to a wide, flat-bottomed coulee with high ragged bluffs shutting
  it in upon every side. The Kid dimly remembered that coulee, because that was
  where Andy got down to tighten the cinch on Miss Allen's horse, and looked up
  at her the way Daddy Chip looked at Doctor Dell sometimes, and made a kiss
  with his lips&mdash;and got called down for it, too. The Kid remembered.</p>

  <p>He looked at the man, shut his mouth tight and wheeled Silver suddenly to
  the left. He leaned forward as he had always seen the Happy Family do when
  they started a race, and struck Silver smartly down the rump with the braided
  romal on his bridle-reins. H. J. Owens was taken off his guard and did
  nothing but stare open-mouthed until the Kid was well under way; then he
  shouted and galloped after him, up the little flat.</p>

  <p>He might as well have saved his horse's wind and his own energy. He was no
  match for little Buck Bennett, who had the whole Flying U outfit to teach him
  how to ride, and the spirit of his Daddy Chip and the little Doctor combined
  to give him grit and initiative. H. J. Owens pounded along to the head of the
  coulee, where he had seen the Kid galloping dimly in the dusk. He turned up
  into the canyon that sloped invitingly up from the level, and went on at the
  top speed of his horse&mdash;which was not fast enough to boast about.</p>

  <p>When he had left the coulee well behind him, the Kid rode out from behind
  a clump of bushes that was a mere black shadow against the coulee wall, and
  turned back whence he had come. The Kid giggled a little over the way he had
  fooled the pilgrim, and wished that the bunch had been there to see him do
  it. He kept Silver galloping until he had reached the other end of the level,
  and then he pulled him down to a walk and let the reins drop loosely upon
  Silver's neck. That was what Daddy Chip and the boys had told him he must do,
  next time he got lost and did not know the way home. He must just let Silver
  go wherever he wanted to go, and not try to guide him at all. Silver would go
  straight home; he had the word of the whole bunch for that, and he believed
  it implicitly.</p>

  <p>Silver looked back inquiringly at his small rider, hesitated and then
  swung back up the coulee. The Kid was afraid that H. J. Owens would come back
  and see him and cut off his ears if he went that way&mdash;but he did not
  pull Silver back and make him go some other way, for all that. If he left him
  alone, Silver would take him right straight home. Daddy Chip and the boys
  said so. And he would tell them how mean that man was. They would fix him,
  all right!</p>

  <p>Halfway up the coulee Silver turned into a narrow gulch that seemed to
  lead nowhere at all except into the side of a big, black-shadowed bluff. Up
  on the hillside a coyote began to yap with a shrill staccato of sounds that
  trailed off into a disconsolate whimper. The Kid looked that way
  interestedly. He was not afraid of coyotes. They would not hurt anyone; they
  were more scared than you were&mdash;the bunch had told him so. He wished he
  could get a sight of him, though. He liked to see their ears stick up and
  their noses stick out in a sharp point, and see them drop their tails and go
  sliding away out of sight. When he was ten and Daddy Chip gave him a gun, he
  would shoot coyotes and skin them his own self.</p>

  <p>The coyote yapped shrilly again, and the Kid wondered what his Doctor Dell
  would say when he got home. He was terribly hungry, and he was tired and
  wanted to go to bed. He wished the bunch would happen along and fix that man.
  His heart swelled in his chest with rage and disappointment when he thought
  of those baby bear cubs that were not anywhere at all&mdash;because the man
  was just lying all the time. In spite of himself the Kid cried whimperingly
  to himself while he rode slowly up the gorge which Silver had chosen to
  follow because the reins were drooping low alongside his neck and he might go
  where he pleased.</p>

  <p>By and by the moon rose and lightened the hills so that they glowed
  softly; and the Kid, looking sleepily around him, saw a coyote slinking along
  a barren slope. He was going to shout at it and see it run, but he thought of
  the man who was looking for him and glanced fearfully over his shoulder. The
  moon shone full in his face and showed the tear-streaks and the tired droop
  to his lips.</p>

  <p>The Kid thought he must be going wrong, because at the ranch the moon came
  up in another place altogether. He knew about the moon. Doctor Dell had
  explained to him how it just kept going round and round the world and you saw
  it when it came up over the edge. That was how Santa Claus found out if kids
  were good; he lived in the moon, and it went round and round so he could look
  down and see if you were bad. The Kid rubbed the tears off his cheeks with
  his palm, so that Santa Claus could not see that he had been crying. After
  that he rode bravely, with a consciously straight spine, because Santa Claus
  was looking at him all the time and he must be a rell ole cowpuncher.</p>

  <p>After a long while the way grew less rough, and Silver trotted down the
  easier slopes. The Kid was pretty tired now. He held on by the horn of his
  saddle so Silver would not jolt him so much. He was terribly hungry, too, and
  his eyes kept going shut. But Santa Claus kept looking at him to see if he
  were a dead game sport, so he did not cry any more. He wished he had some
  grub in a sack, but he thought he must be nearly home now. He had come a
  terribly far ways since he ran away from that pilgrim who was going to cut
  off his ears.</p>

  <p>The Kid was so sleepy, and so tired that he almost fell out of the saddle
  once when Silver, who had been loping easily across a fairly level stretch of
  ground, slowed abruptly to negotiate a washout crossing. He had been thinking
  about those baby bear cubs digging ants and eating them. He had almost seen
  them doing it; but he remembered now that he was going home to tell the bunch
  how the man had lied to him and tried to make him stay down here. The bunch
  would sure fix him when they heard about that.</p>

  <p>He was still thinking vengefully of the punishment which the Happy Family
  would surely mete out to H. J. Owens when Silver lifted his head, looked off
  to the right and gave a shrill whinny. Somebody shouted, and immediately a
  couple of horsemen emerged from the shadow of a hill and galloped toward
  him.</p>

  <p>The Kid gave a cry and then laughed. It was his Daddy Chip and somebody.
  He thought the other was Andy Green. He was too tired to kick Silver in the
  ribs and race toward them. He waited until they came up, their horses
  pounding over the uneven sod urged by the jubilance of their riders.</p>

  <p>Chip rode up and lifted the Kid bodily from the saddle and held him so
  tight in his arms that the Kid kicked half-heartedly with both feet, to free
  himself. But he had a message for his Daddy Chip, and as soon as he could get
  his breath he delivered it.</p>

  <p>"Daddy Chip, I just want you to kill that damn' pilgrim!" he commanded.
  "There wasn't any baby bear cubs at all. He was just a-stringin' me. And he
  was going to cut off my ears. He said it wasn't a far ways to where the baby
  bear cubs lived with the old mother bear, and it was. I wish you'd lick the
  stuffin' outa him. I'm awful hungry, Daddy Chip."</p>

  <p>"We'll be home pretty quick," Chip said in a queer, choked voice. "Who was
  the man, Buck? Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>The Kid lifted his head sleepily from his Daddy Chip's shoulder and
  pointed vaguely toward the moon. "He's the man that jumped Andy's ranch right
  on the edge of One Man," he explained. "He's back there ridin' the rim-rocks
  a lookin' for me. I'd a come home before, only he wouldn't let me come. He
  said he'd cut my ears off. I runned away from him, Daddy Chip. And I cussed
  him a plenty for lying to me&mdash;but you needn't tell Doctor Dell."</p>

  <p>"I won't, Buck." Chip lifted him into a more comfortable position and held
  him so. While the Kid slept he talked with Andy about getting the Happy
  Family on the trail of H. J. Owens. Then he rode thankfully home with the Kid
  in his arms and Silver following docilely after.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch28"
     id="ch28">XXVIII. &mdash; AS IT TURNED OUT</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They found H. J. Owens the next forenoon wandering
  hopelessly lost in the hills. Since killing him was barred, they tied his
  arms behind him and turned him toward the Flying U. He was sullen, like an
  animal that is trapped and will do nothing but lie flattened to the ground
  and glare red-eyed at its captors. For that matter, the Happy Family
  themselves were pretty sullen. They had fought fire for hours&mdash;and that
  is killing work; and they had been in the saddle ever since, looking for the
  Kid and for this man who rode bound in their midst.</p>

  <p>Weary and Irish and Pink, who had run across him in a narrow canyon, fired
  pistol-shot signals to bring the others to the spot. But when the others
  emerged from various points upon the scene, there was very little said about
  the capture.</p>

  <p>In town, the Old man had been quite as eager to come close to Florence
  Grace Hallman&mdash;but he was not so lucky. Florence Grace had heard the
  news of the fire a good half hour before the train left for Great Falls.</p>

  <p>She would have preferred a train going the other way, but she decided not
  to wait. She watched the sick woman put aboard the one Pullman coach, and
  then she herself went into the stuffy day-coach. Florence Grace Hallman was
  not in the habit of riding in day-coaches in the night-time when there was a
  Pullman sleeper attached to the train. She did not stop at Great Falls; she
  went on to Butte&mdash;and from there I do not know where she went. Certainly
  she never came back.</p>

  <p>That, of course, simplified matters considerably for Florence
  Grace&mdash;and for the Happy Family as well. For at the preliminary hearing
  of H. J. Owens for the high crime of kidnapping, that gentleman proceeded to
  unburden his soul in a way that would have horrified Florence Grace, had she
  been there to hear. Remember, I told you that his eyes were the wrong shade
  of blue.</p>

  <p>A man of whom you have never heard tried to slip out of the court room
  during the unburdening process, and was stopped by Andy Green, who had been
  keeping an eye on him for the simple reason that the fellow had been much in
  the company of H. J. Owens during the week preceding the fire and the luring
  away of the Kid. The sheriff led him off somewhere&mdash;and so they had the
  man who had set the prairie afire.</p>

  <p>As is the habit of those who confess easily the crimes of others, H. J.
  Owens professed himself as innocent as he consistently could in the face of
  the Happy Family and of the Kid's loud-whispered remarks when he saw him
  there. He knew absolutely nothing about the fire, he said, and had nothing to
  do with the setting of it. He was two miles away at the time it started.</p>

  <p>And then Miss Rosemary Allen took the witness stand and told about the man
  on the hilltop and the bit of mirror that had flashed sun-signals toward the
  west.</p>

  <p>H.J. Owens crumpled down visibly in his chair. Imagine for yourself the
  trouble he would have in convincing men of his innocence after that.</p>

  <p>Just to satisfy your curiosity, at the trial a month later he failed
  absolutely to convince the jury that he was anything but what he was&mdash;a
  criminal without the strength to stand by his own friends. He was sentenced
  to ten years in Deer Lodge, and the judge informed him that he had been dealt
  with leniently at that, because after all he was only a tool in the hands of
  the real instigator of the crime. That real instigator, by the way, was never
  apprehended.</p>

  <p>The other man&mdash;he who had set fire to the prairie&mdash;got six
  years, and cursed the judge and threatened the whole Happy Family with death
  when the sentence was passed upon him&mdash;as so many guilty men do.</p>

  <p>To go back to that preliminary trial: the Happy Family, when H. J. Owens
  was committed safely to the county jail, along with the fire-bug, took the
  next train to Great Falls with witnesses and the Honorable Blake. They filed
  their answers to the contests two days before the time-limit had expired. You
  may call that shaving too close the margin of safety. But the Happy family
  did not worry over that&mdash;seeing there was a margin of safety. Nor did
  they worry over the outcome of the matter. With the Homeseekers Syndicate in
  extremely bad repute, and with fully half of the colonists homeless and
  disgusted, why should they worry over their own ultimate success?</p>

  <p>They planned great things with their irrigation scheme...I am not going
  to tell any more about them just now. Some of you will complain, and want to
  know a good many things that have not been told in detail. But if I should
  try to satisfy you, there would be no more meetings between you and the Happy
  Family&mdash;since there would be no more to tell.</p>

  <p>So I am not even going to tell you whether Andy succeeded in persuading
  Miss Rosemary Allen to go with him to the parson. Nor whether the Happy
  Family really did settle down to raise families and alfalfa and beards. Not
  another thing shall you know about them now.</p>

  <p>You may take a look at them as they go trailing contentedly away from the
  land-office, with their hats tilted at various characteristic angles and
  their well-known voices mingled in more or less joyful converse, and their
  toes pointed toward Central Avenue and certain liquid refreshments. You need
  not worry over that bunch, surely. You may safely leave them to meet future
  problems and emergencies as they have always met them in the past&mdash;on
  their feet, with eyes that do not wave or flinch, shoulder to shoulder, ready
  alike for grim fate or a frolic.</p>
