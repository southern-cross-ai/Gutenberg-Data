<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE WORST-HATED MAN IN
AMERICA</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN hard times were at their hardest, it was
customary for the newspapers to say that Horace Laghet had all
the money in the country. His name was on every lip; the least of
his doings and sayings constituted front page stuff.</p>

<p>He first came into prominence during the panic of 1929 when it
transpired that he had sold short. Of course he made millions.
And after that, when everybody else was desperately trying to
revive confidence, Laghet continued to sell America short, and
America, unfortunately, justified his disbelief. He raked in more
and more millions.</p>

<p>He spent lavishly. At a time when the building trades were
almost at a standstill he commenced the construction of a huge
marble palace on upper Fifth Avenue and another at Newport. He
ordered a yacht that was to exceed any yacht ever built. When
these extravagances were criticised he retorted: "Well, I'm
keeping the money in circulation, am I not?" And there was no
come-back.</p>

<p>To do him justice, I must say that he subscribed great sums to
the unemployment funds, and to every form of relief. It did not
do him any good. People felt that he ought have given more. In
the gay old days millionaires used to be respected&mdash;or at
least admired, but not now. People felt in a dim way that Laghet
had profited out of the country's misfortunes, and he was
hated.</p>

<p>Lord! how he was hated. His name was never mentioned without a
covert sneer. It was said that his life had been attempted
several times, and that he never ventured out without an armed
guard.</p>

<p>This being the situation, my excitement can be understood when
one morning a crisp voice said over the 'phone: "This is Horace
Laghet speaking." Just like that. No hireling or secretary, but
the great man himself. At first I thought it was a hoax.</p>

<p>"Is Madame Storey in her office?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll see," I said cautiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't give me that bunk!" he said. "I'm Horace Laghet.
Connect me with her."</p>

<p>"If I were sure that it was Mr. Laghet speaking..." I
began.</p>

<p>"Connect me! Connect me!" he shouted. "She can hang up if
she's not satisfied, can't she?"</p>

<p>I thought it best to switch the call to my employer's desk.
She was cool and off-hand. He asked if he could see her. "I can
give you half an hour at noon," she said. She politely declined
an invitation to lunch. He said, "Very well, I'll be there at
twelve."</p>

<p>When she had hung up I went in. She was helping herself to a
cigarette with an amused smile. "Well, Bella, business is picking
up," she said.</p>

<p>"Fancy! Horace Laghet coming here!" I said, all agog.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no occasion to strew roses in his path," she
said.</p>

<p>When he entered my office I got a shock. I suppose I had read
that he was only thirty-five years old, but it was hard to
believe that the man everybody was talking about could be so
young. A tall stalwart figure at the top-notch of a man's vigour,
with a deeply tanned skin, though the month was February. He had
a dark, passionate face that could be brutal, I suspected, but at
present was masked by a courteous smile. He had the air of
assurance that great riches give to a man, but I discovered that
he was easily upset.</p>

<p>I opened the door of Mme. Storey's office, and followed him
in. He stopped short at the sight of her. "I didn't think that
you would be like this," he said. His black eyes fired up with
admiration. He was a disturbing man to women.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey is used to this sort of thing. "That can be taken
in two ways," she murmured.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," he said. "Of course, I have often seen
your photograph and admired it. But the published photographs of
prominent women are so touched up that you never believe in
them."</p>

<p>She smiled ironically.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said. "Have a cigarette?"</p>

<p>He glanced at me deprecatingly. "I wished to see you
alone."</p>

<p>"Miss Brickley is present at all interviews," said Mme.
Storey. "It is a rule I have made."</p>

<p>He stood up, and his face flushed darkly. "I am not just an
ordinary caller!" he said angrily. "This is important."</p>

<p>It was the wrong line to take with my employer. "It is my
rule," she repeated, with deceitful mildness. I thought he was
going to walk right out of the door again, and my heart sank. The
richest man in town walking out of the door! However, he thought
better of it. He sat down again, and after a moment succeeded in
smoothing his ruffed plumage. I went to my desk in the
corner.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know who I am," he began.</p>

<p>"I read the newspapers," said Mme. Storey, smiling.</p>

<p>A spasm of anger crossed his face. "Yes, damn it!" he
muttered, "and a nice sort of scoundrel they make me out to
be!...Have you noticed that I have had a yacht built, and am
starting on a cruise with a party of guests to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I had seen a later date mentioned."</p>

<p>"I know. But the President-elect sent for me yesterday, and
from what I learned from him I can see that there is a bad time
ahead of us. Worse than anything we have been through. Well, I
mean to be out of the way of it. They blame me for everything
that happens. I'm going for a six months' cruise to the West
Indies and to South America."</p>

<p>"How pleasant," said Mme. Storey. "What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"Two weeks ago," he went on, "I was called up at my office by
a woman's voice. A superior sort of voice, soft-spoken, educated.
She warned me not to go on this voyage. When I pressed her for
particulars she hung up. Well, I am frequently called up or
addressed through the mail by triflers, so I thought no more
about it.</p>

<p>"But to-day she called up again. There was a ring of
earnestness in her voice. You can't mistake that sort of thing.
She was crying; she seemed scarcely able to speak for terror. All
she said was that if I went on this voyage I should never come
back alive. That they were laying for me. When I tried to get
more out of her she hung up."</p>

<p>"How did she reach your ear on both occasions?" asked Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"I have a private 'phone on my desk that is connected directly
with the exchange. She called up on that."</p>

<p>"She knew the private number?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, many do. There's no clue in that."</p>

<p>"It is impossible to trace 'phone calls in these days of dial
'phones," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I don't want you to trace the call," he said. "I want you to
come with me on the voyage...And your secretary, if you want her.
Ostensibly you will be my guests, but in reality you will be
working for me."</p>

<p>I was so astonished my jaw dropped as if the spring had
broken. I expect I gaped at the man like a clown.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was not at all put about. "If you think there is
anything in this warning," she said, "my honest advice to you is
to give up the voyage."</p>

<p>"Never!" he said, setting his jaw. "This yacht has cost me
three millions. I'm going to sea in her.</p>

<p>"You don't want anybody like me," she said. "You need men who
can guard you all the time."</p>

<p>"I'll have them if I need them. I want you to lay bare the
plot, if there is a plot. Nobody can do that so well as you.
What's more, you will be a delightful addition to the party. I
wouldn't like to impose an ordinary detective on my guests."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Frankly, it doesn't appeal
to me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever taken a long voyage in a yacht?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I have. In such close quarters the guests get rather
badly on each other's nerves." She looked at him in a dry way
that suggested he himself was a bit too passionate and
domineering to make the ideal fellow voyager.</p>

<p>He laughed it off. "You won't find the quarters on the
<i>Buccaneer</i> too close."</p>

<p>"<i>Buccaneer</i>?" said Mme. Storey. "Well named!"</p>

<p>He was ready to get sore at that, but decided to laugh again.
"Just a small party," he said. "The ladies include my fiancée,
Celia Dare, and her mother, and Mrs. Holder."</p>

<p>"Who is Mrs. Holder?"</p>

<p>"Just a dear friend," he said carelessly.</p>

<p>"A widow?"</p>

<p>"No. She's got a perfectly good husband somewhere. He's in
business and can't get away...The men will be my brother Adrian,
young Emil Herbert, the celebrated pianist, and my secretary,
Martin Coade. Martin is a host in himself. He's in Holland just
now, but will join the ship when we touch at Curaçao."</p>

<p>"Such a ship must carry a big crew," suggested Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"Yes. Nearly a hundred men."</p>

<p>"Easy to plant an assassin amongst them," she murmured.</p>

<p>Laghet showed his teeth unpleasantly. "I assure you they have
been hand-picked," he said grimly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey debated with herself.</p>

<p>"Five thousand dollars a week," said Laghet seductively.</p>

<p>"Good pay," she said.</p>

<p>"Will you take it?"</p>

<p>"Yes." But as his hand shot out she held hers up. "...Under
certain conditions."</p>

<p>"Name them, Lady!"</p>

<p>"I cannot undertake any responsibility for your safety."</p>

<p>"That's understood."</p>

<p>"Secondly, I must be free to terminate the agreement and leave
the ship at any time."</p>

<p>"Right! We'll make it so pleasant for you, you won't want to
leave."</p>

<p>"Thirdly, you must tell me the whole truth."</p>

<p>He stared. "Why on earth shouldn't I tell you the truth?"</p>

<p>"My dear man," she said, "you haven't reached your present
position without&mdash;how can I put it
inoffensively?&mdash;without being mixed up in things you don't
want to talk about. When I come to you for necessary information
you must tell me the whole truth or I can do nothing."</p>

<p>He appeared to like her frankness. "Agreed," he said,
grinning.</p>

<p>"Lastly, anybody can see that you have a dominating
personality and do not take kindly to direction. But you must
understand that in such situations as may arise out of this
investigation, if you do not act as I advise you I will be
useless to you."</p>

<p>"That's the hardest one," he said ruefully. "It will be a
novelty to take orders from a woman. However, I agree."</p>

<p>They shook hands on it.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who it is that may want to murder you?"
asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He shrugged. "It might be one of twenty men."</p>

<p>"And is probably none of them," she put in. "It is always the
unexpected enemy who has murder in his heart."</p>

<p>"Will you be ready to go aboard at noon tomorrow?" he asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>"It would be wiser to put off the sailing until I can make a
preliminary investigation."</p>

<p>"Not an hour!" he said, with a darkening face.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, "in my business one has to be prepared
for anything."</p>

<p>"You're a wonderful woman!" he cried. "I'm glad I came to you!
I'll make out a cheque to bind the bargain." He did so then and
there. When he got up to go, he said: "Perhaps it's all a stall,
anyhow. In that case we'll have a swell time on the seven seas
and forget the depression!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had half turned in her chair and was looking out
of the window behind her. "It is not a stall," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>Laghet's face sharpened. He showed his teeth. "What makes you
so sure of that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Look out of the window," she said. "Do not come close enough
to show yourself. That man standing against the park railings
opposite. The one with a greenish Fedora pulled over his eyes. Is
he in your employ?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him before," said Laghet.</p>

<p>"Then he's a spy. He followed you here, and he will follow you
when you leave."</p>

<p>"But I came in my car!"</p>

<p>"No doubt he has a car waiting too."</p>

<p>Laghet caught up his stick. "By God! I'll soon settle his
business!" he cried.</p>

<p>"What good will that do you?" said Mme. Storey. "He's only a
paid spy. If you assault him you'll be arrested. You won't be
able to prove anything. It will only delay your sailing."</p>

<p>"Damn it, I suppose you're right!" he said, groaning with
baulked rage. He jammed on his hat and strode out.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; FIRE</h2>

<p class="first">I STAYED that night with Mme. Storey at her
place on East Sixty-Third Street. This had been arranged so that
we could work late in clearing up all the odds and ends of
business that demanded attention before she sailed. We had spent
the afternoon in doing necessary shopping for the voyage. All our
things were packed and ready.</p>

<p>I have had occasion before to describe my employer's original
little establishment. She and her friend, Mrs. Lysaght, bought an
old brownstone house and transformed it into two maisonnettes in
the French style. Mme. Storey occupies the two lower floors. The
kitchen faces the street with a barred window that is left open
at night for ventilation, and the dining-room opens on a tiny
garden in the rear. Upstairs her bedroom is over the kitchen and
her delightful living-room looks down on the garden.</p>

<p>As there is only one bedroom, I had to share it with her. Her
maid, Grace, made up a bed on the sofa. Grace and the cook sleep
up on the top floor of the house with Mrs. Lysaght's maids. But
the Lysaght establishment was closed at this time.</p>

<p>We had just gone to bed and were lying there talking about
this and that. It was very late. The windows were open and the
street was wrapped in stillness. Only a distant hum reminded us
that we were part of a great city. The thought of danger to
ourselves was farthest from our minds. In fact, for the moment we
were occupied with the details of our own business, and had
forgotten Horace Laghet.</p>

<p>I can remember hearing some clock strike two and Mme. Storey
saying: "We <i>must</i> go to sleep!"</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard a hard object fall to the floor of the
kitchen underneath us. We both jumped up and instinctively ran to
the window. We were in time to see a man running away down the
street towards Third Avenue. He ran awkwardly, with hunched
shoulders and a sideways movement.</p>

<p>I would have shouted to stop him, but Mme. Storey clapped a
hand over my mouth. "Too late to catch him now," she said.</p>

<p>As she spoke there was an explosion, not very loud, in the
room beneath us. And a moment afterwards that most awful sound of
all at night; the rushing and snapping of fire. I stood in the
middle of the bedroom, half stupefied. Mme. Storey gave me a
shake.</p>

<p>"Put on your dressing-gown and slippers and follow me!"</p>

<p>It brought me to myself.</p>

<p>"Shall I telephone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No!" she said, in a tone that surprised me.</p>

<p>Standing in the corner of the stair landing was a copper fire
extinguisher. Mme. Storey snatched it up and ran down. On the
lower landing was another extinguisher that she mutely pointed
out to me. We could hear the flames roaring like devils behind
the kitchen door. The difficulty was to get the door open.
Fortunately it opened towards us, and Mme. Storey was able to
shield herself behind it. Flame leaped out of the kitchen like a
red ravening beast, shrivelling us with its hot breath.</p>

<p>The whole room was blazing at once and little runnels of fire
crept over the sill into the hall. It burned with that special
speed and fury that only gasoline can induce. Mme. Storey,
backing away out of reach of the flames into the dining-room,
turned her extinguisher upon them. The thin hissing stream was
swallowed up and lost. The fire only roared louder. Suffocating
black smoke billowed into our faces. Mme. Storey was driven back
foot by foot.</p>

<p>"We must get out of here!" I cried.</p>

<p>She paid no attention. After a moment, she muttered: "Open the
window at my back. The wind is on that side."</p>

<p>I obeyed, and a current of air was created that held the
flames and smoke in check. On the other side of that wall of
flame I could hear cries from the street. Mme. Storey began to
regain the lost ground, driving the flames back with an unerring
eye whenever they tried to flank her. I stood with the second
extinguisher ready to hand to her when the first was
exhausted.</p>

<p>We crossed the hall again. The two maids came running down the
stairs. They stood on the bottom step, fascinated with horror but
perfectly silent. They had confidence in their mistress' ability
to handle any thing. The fire was forced back, snarling, into the
kitchen. We heard the fire trucks coming from afar.</p>

<p>Once the chemical mixture got the upper hand, the fire soon
gave up. All around the walls Mme. Storey drove it back towards
the window. Suddenly it was out and the kitchen was just a black
charred hole. Through the window I had a glimpse of the crowd
hanging over the railings. The lights had not been burned out,
and I got them turned on. After all, not much had suffered but
paint, varnish and plaster. But what an escape!</p>

<p>In the middle of the floor lay a tell-tale jagged piece of
tin. We found another behind the stove. Meanwhile, the trucks had
drawn up outside and the firemen were banging on the ornamental
iron gate that gives entrance to the house alongside the kitchen.
I started to let them in, but my employer laid a hand on my
arm.</p>

<p>"We don't want any investigation, Bella."</p>

<p>Opening the cellar door, she kicked the two pieces of tin
downstairs.</p>

<p>The firemen swarmed in, nosed all around as they always do,
and asked the usual questions. Mme. Storey's explanation was
ingenious.</p>

<p>"I came downstairs to heat some water on the gas stove, and
went up again. I suppose the curtain at the window blew across
the flame and caught fire. Unfortunately, my maid had left a can
of cleaning fluid on the window sill and that exploded."</p>

<p>"Very careless to leave an explosive so near the stove,
Madam," said the fire captain.</p>

<p>"You are absolutely right, Chief," she replied with a
perfectly straight face. "I shall scold the girl severely, and I
can promise you it won't happen again."</p>

<p>She led them into the dining-room for a little refreshment,
and they presently departed with loud praises for her presence of
mind. The trucks roared away down the street, and a great quiet
descended on the street. Mme. Storey and I went back to bed, but
not, to sleep.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock next morning we were seated in the living-
room with Latham Rowe, Mme. Storey's attorney. A horrible stale
smell of wet burnt stuff filled the house. Our baggage had been
sent on ahead to the yacht landing, and we were all set to go in
hats and gloves.</p>

<p>Latham is a nice man, the chubby, sweet-tempered type that is
predestined to be the friend of every woman and the husband of
none. Mme. Storey was saying:</p>

<p>"I'll have to leave it to you to see that the insurance is
collected and the repairs properly done."</p>

<p>"Sure!" he said, "but tell me, Rosika, on the level, what
caused this fire. You can't expect me to believe that bunk about
Grace's carelessness."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled. "It cost me a new dress to square Grace
for that lie," she said. "The truth is, somebody shoved an open
can of gasoline between the bars of the kitchen window last
night, and threw a lighted match or something of that sort after
it."</p>

<p>Latham's rosy face paled. "Good God! what a fiendish thing to
do!" he cried. "And you're not going to say anything about
it!"</p>

<p>"If there was an investigation it would prevent me from going
on this voyage. And nothing would come of it. I prefer to deal
with my enemies myself."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who did it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It was obviously somebody who didn't want me aboard the
yacht."</p>

<p>"And you're still determined to go!"</p>

<p>She smiled at his simple earnestness.</p>

<p>"I cannot take a dare, my dear. It is a weakness of my
character. Yesterday I wasn't at all keen, but to-day I'm mad
to."</p>

<p>He was terribly distressed.</p>

<p>"But seriously, Rosika, I can't stand by and see you risk your
life for...for..."</p>

<p>"Five thousand a week," she put in slyly.</p>

<p>"Be serious! This fellow Horace Laghet is a scoundrel! You
should hear the stories they tell about him down town. If
somebody wants to shoot him up, let them go to it and welcome, I
say. What have you got to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I can see that Laghet is going to give me trouble," she
admitted. "But a job is a job, and this is rather a fascinating
one."</p>

<p>"What can you do?" he pleaded. "On land you know where you
are, but on a ship anything may happen. The sea is always there
to swallow a body and yield no trace. If there is a man aboard
that yacht who is determined to get Laghet how can you stop him?
If you get in his way you'll go overboard too."</p>

<p>She merely smiled.</p>

<p>"How can you save the man from being murdered when he makes an
enemy of every man he meets?" he went on. "There's a feeling of
hatred rolling up against Horace Laghet like a tidal wave. If you
take his part it will overwhelm you along with him."</p>

<p>She patted his cheek affectionately. "You're a great dear,
Latham, but you're on the wrong line. If you could persuade me
that this was going to be a quiet cruise with nothing to do but
loll in a deck-chair and put on pounds and pounds, I'd drop it
this minute. But when you talk of <i>danger!</i> Ha!..." She
flung her arms up. "It's useless, my dear. Ask Bella."</p>

<p>He spread out his arms helplessly.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; THE "BUCCANEER"</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN we descended from the taxicab at the yacht
landing, foot of East Twenty-Sixth Street, the <i>Buccaneer</i>,
lying out in mid-stream, burst on us in full glory. It was a
cold, bright day and the sparkling river made a fit setting for
her. A great white ship with an insolent, squat funnel and long
strings of fluttering flags.</p>

<p>As the latest sensation of the marine world, a crowd had
gathered on the pier to have a look at her. Ultramodern design,
the yachtsmen were saying, with her high sides and oblique cut-
water; ugly but very smart. As for myself, the thought that all
those millions had been spent to carry six people to sea for an
idle cruise, filled me with a vague fear of retribution.</p>

<p>Only second in interest for the crowd was the launch which was
waiting for us, a dazzling affair of mahogany and brass. It was
such a launch as might have been used to carry kings and queens.
When we stepped aboard everybody gaped at us in awe and envy.
Some of the rougher types muttered insolently.</p>

<p>In five minutes we were at the ship's ladder, which was not a
ladder at all but a teak-wood stairway carpeted with rope to keep
your feet from slipping. A handsome young sailor handed us off,
and a smart officer saluted on deck. There was a steward in a
white coat to show us to our cabins.</p>

<p>All very grand, but it did not make us feel we were being
welcomed on board. Sailor, officer, and steward all had cagey,
expressionless faces. Not one of them looked us in the eye.</p>

<p>It appeared that we were the last arrivals. The launch was
immediately hooked to the davits and drawn up. A bosun's whistle
blew, and I heard the clank of the anchor chain up forward. Fancy
keeping all that waiting!</p>

<p>Below, our suite was more like that of a luxury hotel than
anything afloat. A sitting-room twenty feet long, with a bedroom
almost as big at either side; a marble bathroom for each of us,
with gold-plated fittings.</p>

<p>The whole was lighted with a row of big round portholes rimmed
with brass, and it was all so beautifully furnished and decorated
that nothing obtruded itself; it just received you.</p>

<p>The steward told us that cocktails were being served in the
winter-garden. When we had taken off our coats, he led us up to
the sun-deck, where there was a green and white room with a glass
roof and big windows all around. It was filled with tropical
plants and orchids. Here the party was gathered.</p>

<p>When you are introduced to a lot of new people at the same
time you only get your bearings by degrees. I found myself beside
a lovely young girl with a modest, timid air that was almost
unbelievable in this day and generation. She told me that she had
lately graduated from a convent in France. This was Celia Dare,
Horace Laghet's fiancée. It seemed rather a shame.</p>

<p>Her mother was a beautiful woman still on the sunny side of
forty. Everybody called her Sophie. In contradistinction to her
daughter, she was very much in the know. Her bright touched-up
eyes darted this way and that, full of calculation. I suppose she
thought she had done very well by the girl.</p>

<p>The third woman was Mrs. Holder, or Adele. She was a beauty of
what used to be called the Dresden china type, with that
exquisite fragility that appeals so strongly to men, particularly
of Horace Laghet's sort. It often goes with a hearty
appetite.</p>

<p>Amongst the men I should have recognised Adrian Laghet
anywhere as Horace's brother. He was tall and had the same cast
of features, though an entirely different character was
suggested. Adrian was soft.</p>

<p>Already at thirty-two his waist measure was approaching that
of his chest. He was the social light of the family.</p>

<p>Emil Herbert, the pianist, was an attractive young fellow,
blond, quiet in manner, but with the fine, resolute eye that
bespeaks a master of his trade, which Emil was. Apart from music,
however, he was nothing but a shy boy. I caught him glancing
sideways at the girl beside me.</p>

<p>Under the influence of the masterly cocktails there was a lot
of talk and laughter. Superficially it had the look of a good
party, but it was not so. I really had not been amongst them two
minutes before I could feel the strain. The eyes in those smiling
faces were guarded and uneasy. All those smart people seemed to
be encased in glass armour.</p>

<p>Tall, slender, and casual, Mme. Storey, amongst the other
women, looked like a cardinal bird amongst tame canaries. Her
smile was perfectly good-humoured and inscrutable. I felt enmity
in the room, but among those glassy smiles I could not locate
it.</p>

<p>Horace Laghet seemed to get his pleasure out of insulting
everybody. That was his idea of humour. When he brought his
brother up to introduce him to Mme. Storey, he said: "This is
little Adrian, who will kiss your hand, and do a little song and
dance, or paint a little picture, or what you will!"</p>

<p>A loud laugh greeted this. Horace's cracks naturally were sure
of a big hand. I could see by Adrian's eyes that it flicked him
on the raw, but he swallowed it.</p>

<p>Horace, indifferent to what anybody might think, bore himself
in a loverly fashion towards the beautiful Adele&mdash;a
contemptuous lover. This made me feel more than ever sorry for
the girl he was supposed to be engaged to. Celia didn't seem to
mind. Perhaps she was too inexperienced to realise what it meant.
I wondered what her mother was about. Willing, I suppose, to
overlook anything if she could only take the rich Horace into
camp.</p>

<p>The yacht was under way and I went to one of the windows to
watch the panorama of the city moving by. It was hard to believe
that we had already cut loose from all we knew. The East-side
waterfront is far from beautiful, but I felt a sudden love for
the old town, and heartily wished myself ashore. Moment by moment
I liked our situation less. Adele joined me at the window. She
said lightly: "I wonder if it will show any change when we come
back?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell?" I said. And to myself I added: "Will we show
any change when we come back? And will we all come back?"</p>

<p>"Just the same, I'm glad to get away for a while," Adele went
on, with her meaningless professional-beauty smile. "Life in New
York is so wearing!"</p>

<p>She was very beautiful. I wondered if there were any real
feelings under that perfect mask. I presently found out.</p>

<p>A sailor came walking along the deck outside. I saw him before
Adele did. I was struck by his appearance, because he didn't look
like a common sailor, but like a member of the younger country-
club set who had been hitting it up; a clean-cut young man who
was getting a little blurry. He didn't know anyone was watching
him. There was a possessed look in his eyes such as you see in
one who goes along the street muttering to himself.</p>

<p>When he saw me, he dropped his head and assumed the slouch of
a common fellow. He went by us with his head down. I heard Adele
gasp, and her slender fingers closed around my wrist like a
vice.</p>

<p>"Please...please," she stammered, "come downstairs with
me."</p>

<p>I followed her wonderingly through the door into the stair
hall. She was careful to keep her back turned to the others in
the room. Her knees were giving under her. Yet when Horace called
out: "Where are you going, Adele?" she sang out gaily: "Back in
half a moment."</p>

<p>She went stumbling down the stairs. I heard her murmuring to
herself: "Oh, my God! What am I going to do?" She clung to the
post at the bottom, white-faced and shaking. In a moment she
opened her eyes and said with a ghastly attempt to laugh it
off:</p>

<p>"What must you think of me?"</p>

<p>"You are not well," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes...yes," she said eagerly. "It was so hot upstairs. I
thought I was going to faint."</p>

<p>I said nothing. Feeling, perhaps, that her excuse was rather
lame, she went on: "I have a bad heart, you see, and naturally
one doesn't want a man to know it. If you had not come with me
Horace would have followed, and...and his eyes are so sharp!" A
terrible shudder went through her thin body.</p>

<p>"Come to my cabin and get a spot of brandy," I said.</p>

<p>When she had swallowed the brandy she began to chatter. "I
feel all right now. It was nothing at all. Nothing. So silly of
me! Dear me! I hope I'm not going to be a bad sailor!" And so on.
But her eyes were still sick with fear. She went to the mirror
and rubbed a little rouge into her cheeks, then turned her head
this way and that, gazing into her face with the most penetrating
anxiety. I suppose that face meant everything in the world to
her. It was all she had.</p>

<p>She entered the winter-garden with a gay rattle of talk.
"Horace, when are you going to show us the vessel? I can't wait
until I see the swimming-pool. It's all perfectly marvelous! Like
Aladdin's cave afloat!"</p>

<p>In my mind I could still hear that desperate voice murmuring:
"Oh, my God! What am I going to do?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE EAVESDROPPER</h2>

<p class="first">MME. STOREY'S first task was to acquaint herself
with every part of the yacht, and to make friends with everybody
on board. We wandered around in the guise of an innocent
curiosity.</p>

<p>Captain Grober was an enigma. A fine-looking, sailor-like
German of the bristly-haired type, he was most polite. But we
could never get him to unbend; his grey-blue eyes held no more
expression than those of a fish. One had to admit that his
position on board was a difficult one. He had always commanded
big liners, where his word was law at sea, but now he was under
the shadow of the owner.</p>

<p>The under-officers, all young Germans, took their cue from the
Captain. Polite and wooden, it was impossible to make friends
with them. On the other hand, the engine-room staff was mostly
Scotsmen. The chief, McLaren, was a grand old fellow whom I
always delighted to talk to when I could catch him on deck.</p>

<p>It was not a happy ship. Horace was brutal and overbearing
with the crew. American sailors will not stand for it. As
Horace's guests, we shared in his unpopularity. Once as we sat on
deck he passed nearby, looked down into the well-deck over the
rail and passed on. We heard a growling voice from below: "Huh!
thinks he's the Lord God Almighty! But he ain't immortal! He
ain't immortal!" Mme. Storey arose and looked over the rail, but
the speaker was gone.</p>

<p>Among the friends we made was Jim, a gnarly old fellow with
white hair. His principal duty was to wipe down the white-painted
walls on deck. Thus he was nearly always somewhere about our
quarters and we could talk to him when we pleased.</p>

<p>Another man we liked was Les Farman. We came upon him sitting
on a bitt on the forward deck making a bag out of a piece of
sail-cloth. He was a magnificent physical specimen with steady
blue eyes and firm mouth. Mme. Storey stopped and looked at him
in pleasure. He stood up in instinctive politeness, but he was
not in the least afraid of her. Indeed, there was a hint of fun
in his eyes. He knew his own worth. And that charmed her.</p>

<p>We talked for a while. When she suggested that he seemed
somewhat above his station, he answered coolly that he had a
master's papers. Having had trouble with his owners (he did not
say of what nature), he had found it impossible to get another
ship during such hard times, and had been glad to sign as a
seaman on the <i>Buccaneer</i>.</p>

<p>Just because those two men were so square and decent, Mme.
Storey would not attempt to use them as spies on the rest of the
crew.</p>

<p>I was never able to point out the sailor whose appearance had
so terrified Adele. Apparently he was keeping out of our way.</p>

<p>On our third day at sea Mme. Storey and I were pacing the deck
after lunch. It was already warm as we steamed south, and all the
doors and windows were open.</p>

<p>Every time we passed the door of the music-room we could hear
Emil Herbert softly playing Chopin. We could see little Celia
Dale sitting in a big chair behind him with tears in her eyes,
and smiling at us through them. It was about the only moment of
the day when the child could escape from her argus-eyed mother.
Presently we met Horace himself, black-browed and scowling,
strolling with a cigar. "Rosika," he said at once (all formality
had been dropped by this time), "I want a talk with you."</p>

<p>His overbearing manner always brought a wicked smile to Mme.
Storey's face. "Well, I can spare you ten minutes," she said.</p>

<p>"Do we have to have this creature along?" he said, with a hard
glance in my direction. It was supposed to be a joke. I didn't
care.</p>

<p>"Oh, why not?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>He gave in sullenly, and led the way up to the sundeck, where
he had a sort of den aft of the officers' quarters. It was a
beautiful little room with red leather chairs, sporting prints on
the walls and an honest to God fireplace.</p>

<p>Horace mixed himself a whisky and soda. Mme. Storey and I
declined. "What do you think of the situation?" he growled.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything of it," she said. "I lack
information."</p>

<p>"How about the crew?" he asked. "I've seen you going about
amongst them."</p>

<p>"What is the Captain's history?"</p>

<p>"Surely you don't suspect him!" said Horace, staring.</p>

<p>"I didn't say I did. He seems perfectly correct."</p>

<p>"He used to be captain of the <i>Königin Louise</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, the big liner that burned in the stream at
Bremerhaven."</p>

<p>"Not his fault," said Horace. "He wasn't even aboard at the
time."</p>

<p>"There was an ugly story going around that she was burned for
the insurance. She had never paid expenses, you see."</p>

<p>"Even so," said Horace. "Certainly it wasn't the Captain who
got the insurance...I bank on him," he went on. "He's got twenty-
five years of good seamanship behind him. I consider myself lucky
to get him for a little vessel like this."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said nothing.</p>

<p>"Apart from the yacht, we don't touch anywhere," Horace went
on. "What possible reason could he have for wanting me out of the
way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said mildly. "I'm not accusing him. Only
asking for information...He brought his own officers aboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, his navigating officers. Everybody else was hired in New
York."</p>

<p>"By him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but in consultation with my attorney. I may tell you
that when I received my first warning two weeks ago, I fired the
whole crew on a caprice, and hired another. The record of every
man aboard has been investigated."</p>

<p>"I doubt if it is in the fo'c's'le that the source of danger
is to be looked for," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Horace stared angrily, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Murders, roughly, divide themselves into five classes," she
remarked. "Firstly, there is the killing committed in a sudden
passion. That is out, because this plot has been cooking for two
weeks or more. Secondly, there is the murder induced by
jealousy...Have you wronged any man by taking his girl from him,
Horace?"</p>

<p>He suspected that she was making fun of him. "No," he said
shortly.</p>

<p>"Then that's out. Next there is the motive of fear. Has any
man got cause to fear you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said with a hard grin. "I've already done my worst to
them. I'm out of the market now."</p>

<p>"Fourthly, there is revenge," she went on. "But revenge is the
motive of primitive natures only. Except among gangsters, murders
for revenge are rare. That brings us to the last and most
prolific cause of murders."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Murder for profit."</p>

<p>"Who on earth is there who would profit by my murder?" he said
scornfully.</p>

<p>She did not answer directly. "When are you going to be
married?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with it?" he said. "...There's no
hurry. I'll marry when I get around to it.</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Isn't she a little darling!" he said with a cynical smile.
"So modest and gentle! The perfect wife! Almost unheard of
nowadays."</p>

<p>"If you're not ready for marriage why get engaged?"</p>

<p>"I want to make sure of her. She's unique. Sophie is taking
care of her for me. Sophie won't let the bloom get rubbed off my
peach."</p>

<p>"Sounds Turkish to me," murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Hey?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Nothing...Have you made a will?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Is Adele Holder mentioned in it?"</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" he said, darkening with anger.</p>

<p>"I told you I should have to ask all sorts of questions," said
Mme. Storey calmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is," he said sullenly. "For fifty thousand
only."</p>

<p>"Have you told her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She has a lot more than that to gain from me
living."</p>

<p>"Surely...Who is your heir?"</p>

<p>"My brother Adrian. Until such a time as I marry, of
course."</p>

<p>"He knows you will marry," said Mme. Storey quietly. "There's
a possible motive."</p>

<p>"What, Adrian!" he cried. He laughed harshly. "That poor fish!
He has no reason for existence apart from me! He is nothing but
what I have made him!"</p>

<p>"He could stand alone if he had your money," she said.</p>

<p>"Adrian! That's comic!" He laughed again.</p>

<p>"Weak men are the most dangerous," remarked Mme. Storey. "They
strike in the dark...You treat him badly."</p>

<p>"He's a fool!" said Horace. "He asks for it."</p>

<p>"How much do you allow him?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Not very much. Considering what your income is."</p>

<p>"More than he's worth," said Horace. "He does nothing."</p>

<p>"Suppose this weak man is nursing a sense of resentment in his
breast," said Mme. Storey. "A sort of poisonous mushroom growth
that spreads and spreads until it crowds out everything but
itself."</p>

<p>"I know every thought in his foolish noddle," said Horace.</p>

<p>"No man knows the secret thoughts of another."</p>

<p>"I've been with Adrian since infancy. He's always done what
I've told him."</p>

<p>"He could hire tools stronger than himself. With such a
tremendous stake in view he could afford to offer a big
price..."</p>

<p>"You will never convince me that Adrian is plotting against
me," cried Horace. "He hasn't the initiative of a tadpole!"</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, there's more than one man concerned in it,"
said Mme. Storey. "I advise you not to go on deck alone at
night."</p>

<p>"Let them try it, that's all," growled Horace, clenching his
fist. "On my own ship I'll be the master!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey suddenly sat erect in her chair. "Lower your
voice!" she said quietly. "There is somebody out on deck."</p>

<p>With a single movement Horace was out of his chair, and
through the door. We heard him cursing and ran out. He was
struggling with a sailor. Horace had the man by the throat and
was shaking him like a rat. It was the same man whose appearance
had so frightened Adele two days before.</p>

<p>"Let the man speak!" said Mme. Storey sharply.</p>

<p>Horace let go and the sailor backed off feeling his throat and
scowling from under his brows with venomous hatred. "What are you
doing here?" demanded Horace.</p>

<p>"Just on my way aft to report to the quarter master," muttered
the sailor.</p>

<p>"Say 'Sir' when you speak to me!"</p>

<p>"Sir!" repeated the man with an ugly sneer.</p>

<p>"You're a liar!" said Horace. "You were listening just beyond
the window."</p>

<p>"I wasn't listening. I could hear that you were talking
privately and I was afraid to show myself in front of the
windows. I couldn't hear anything."</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Johnson, sir."</p>

<p>"Get on about your work!" barked Horace. "If I catch you
listening at my windows again I'll know what to do."</p>

<p>The man picked up his hat, saluted, and slouched aft. His
glance was murderous.</p>

<p>"He couldn't have heard anything," Horace muttered, rubbing
his lip, and glancing sideways at Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"You won't get much out of a spy by strangling him," she said
dryly. "Leave him to me and I'll try other measures."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; ILL-STARRED</h2>

<p class="first">ONE afternoon Mme. Storey and I were in our
sitting-room decoding wireless messages that had been received,
and coding the replies. It had been impossible to cut off the
business in New York with one stroke. Latham Rowe had been left
in charge of the office, and we were in communication with him
every day. I helped Mme. Storey to prepare many of the messages
but not all of them.</p>

<p>We were interrupted by a knock at the door. It was Celia Dare.
She ran in, flung her arms around Mme. Storey and buried a hot
face in her neck. The girl was as natural and spontaneous as a
flower, and a great friendship had sprung up between her and my
employer.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey held her off, trying to see into her face. "What's
the matter?" she asked.</p>

<p>Celia obstinately kept her head down. The red and white chased
each other through her delicate cheeks. "Emil kissed me," she
murmured.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey folded her in her arms. We exchanged a glance over
Celia's head. It was only too clear what a danger this created,
yet the girl was such a darling we couldn't help smiling too.</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"It was up in the music-room just now. Emil was playing
something so wistful that it brought the tears to my eyes. I
always cry when he plays, though I love it better than anything.
Suddenly he stopped and looked around. He said...he said my eyes
were like diamonds. He went down on his knees beside my chair
and...and he kissed me."</p>

<p>"Did you like it?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>A very small voice issued from her neck: "Ye-es."</p>

<p>"Did you kiss him back again?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I did."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey held her close. "But you're engaged to marry
another man."</p>

<p>"I clean forgot it!" cried Celia.</p>

<p>We laughed outright at that.</p>

<p>"Oh, what shall I do?" mourned Celia.</p>

<p>"Well, we must talk it over," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I think Emil is waiting out in the corridor," murmured
Celia.</p>

<p>"Bring him in!"</p>

<p>Emil entered very flustered and good-looking, his blond hair
all standing on end as if he had been wildly running his fingers
through it.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry!" he burst out. "I wouldn't have had it happen
for anything. I just lost myself!"</p>

<p>Celia raised her head and looked at him a little
resentfully.</p>

<p>"Don't express too much regret," said Mme. Storey smiling. "It
might be misunderstood."</p>

<p>"I love her!" he cried with perfect inconsistency. "And I
think she loves me back again. Anyhow, she would in time."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Celia,</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Mme. Storey as well as she could speak for
laughing. "When did you two meet for the first time?"</p>

<p>"When we came aboard the yacht."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know your own minds yet, either of you. Give
yourselves a chance."</p>

<p>"I shall never change," said Emil seriously.</p>

<p>"Me neither," said Celia.</p>

<p>"This is just dramatics," said Mme. Storey. "Now listen to me.
The trouble with young people is, they attach far too much
importance to a kiss. They think because they have kissed once
that they must go on kissing to the bitter end. There's nothing
to it. A kiss is just an accident. It's like a drop of rain that
might fall on anybody's head. You don't have to stay out in it
until you're all wet!"</p>

<p>They both laughed at that. Celia left Mme. Storey and, going
to Emil, slipped her hand inside his like a child. They looked at
each other, completely lost. It gave me a little stab of pain to
see it, because if ever a love affair was ill-starred this was
it.</p>

<p>"Emil, you know she's promised to another man," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>He dropped Celia's hand and thrust his fingers through his
hair. "Oh, it's damnable!" he cried. "An old man like that!"
(Emil was twenty-three.)</p>

<p>"Celia," said Mme. Storey. "Are you in love with Horace?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried the girl in great surprise, "I respect him, of
course, but how could I be in love with him?"</p>

<p>"Then you must tell your mother that."</p>

<p>"I have told her. She says love will come."</p>

<p>"Emil," said Mme. Storey, "you know that Horace is a violent
man. He is terrible when his will is crossed. There will be the
most awful trouble if this comes out."</p>

<p>Emil flushed up. "I'm not afraid of him," he said quickly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey saw that she was taking the wrong line, and
quietly abandoned it. "What do you propose to do in this
situation?"</p>

<p>Emil despaired again. "What can I do?" he groaned. "If we were
ashore it would be easy. I could walk out of the man's house. But
here I am, a guest on his yacht and I can't get away!"</p>

<p>"You can leave at Curaçao when we call there in a couple of
days."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" they both cried in terror. Their hands flew together
again.</p>

<p>"How could I go away and leave her in that man's power?" cried
Emil brokenly. "Her mother is completely dominated by him. It
would be more than flesh and blood could stand."</p>

<p>"All right," said Mme. Storey. "But there must be no more
kissing until this matter is cleared up. Don't fool yourselves by
thinking you can keep it secret. Nothing can be kept secret
aboard a yacht. You must play the game."</p>

<p>"All right," said Emil doggedly. He glanced longingly at
Celia. "It's not going to be easy now that I know she likes
it."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey bit her lip. "And Celia," she went on, "you must
tell your mother about Emil."</p>

<p>The girl paled. "How can I!" she gasped. "Her heart is set on
my marrying Horace. She thinks of nothing else. You don't know my
mother!"</p>

<p>"Mme. Storey is right, Celia," urged Emil. "Your mother must
be told. If you can't do it I will."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried Celia in terror. "That would be worse. She
doesn't like you."</p>

<p>"Sophie must be told!" said Mme. Storey firmly.</p>

<p>"All right," murmured the girl. "I'll manage it somehow..."
She looked imploringly at Mme. Storey. "But you'll stand by us,
Rosika!"</p>

<p>"To the limit!" said Mme. Storey. "...If you play the
game!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE CAT'S-PAW</h2>

<p class="first">ON the surface that cruise was like any other
cruise in a luxury yacht. High spirits was everybody's line.
Adrian Laghet was the chief entertainer. He always had some new
stunt to propose. Nobody had a good time really. It was like a
lot of hysterical children jumping on the thin crust of a
volcano. I waited for the explosion.</p>

<p>I used to wonder what was really going on behind Adrian's
calf-like brown eyes which were too large and emotional for a
man's. He was a very good-looking fellow if you like that sort of
thing. He was supposed to be artistic, but there was no evidence
that he had ever worked at the arts.</p>

<p>Once when we happened to be the first ones to meet in the
lounge for cocktails before dinner I asked: "Do you find it
difficult to be Horace's brother?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" he countered with a swift hard stare. "Horace
is one swell guy!"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," I said. "But he's such an overpowering
somebody."</p>

<p>Adrian sounded his loud empty laugh. "I think it's a swell job
to be Horace's little brother!" he cried. He twirled around with
his cocktail glass in one hand and a <i>canapé d'anchois</i> in
the other. "Like the lilies of the field I toil not neither do I
spin, yet Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of
these!"</p>

<p>Such was Adrian's style.</p>

<p>On the night before we arrived at the island of Curaçao,
everybody was up in the winter-garden playing some absurd game
that Adrian had started. The laughter sounded false and strained
and I was fed up. Only Emil and Celia were really enjoying
themselves, because the game gave them a chance to touch hands
occasionally.</p>

<p>Adele had already slipped away on the pretext of a headache,
and at a moment when nobody was looking I beat it too. I intended
to pick up a book in the music-room and go to my cabin to read.
The sea was as smooth as a pond.</p>

<p>It was dark in the music-room, and as I put out my hand to
turn the switch, I happened to catch an oblique glimpse of Adele
through a window. She was coming along the promenade deck
outside, and there was something so furtive in her attitude that
I instinctively drew back my hand and watched her.</p>

<p>Her head was continually over her shoulder watching to see if
she was observed. Her face was white and strained. She passed the
window going aft, and I crossed the hall and went on through the
dark lounge keeping her in view through the windows.</p>

<p>At the end of the lounge there were windows looking aft. Out
on deck near the stern there was a little stairway leading down.
It was used only by the sailors. Adele paused with her hand on
the rail for a cautious look all around. Then she descended out
of sight.</p>

<p>It was my duty to find out what was going on, and I followed
without a qualm. I hastened back to the stairway. I looked down.
I could see nothing. I took off my slippers and went down in
stocking feet.</p>

<p>I was now on what they called A deck. Aft of all the cabins
there was a little open deck from side to side with a solid
screen shutting off a bit of the stern. I think the machinery
that turned the rudder was behind this screen. There was a door
in it, and it was closed, but as the deck was open behind the
screen I could hear the murmuring voices there.</p>

<p>I had come right in the middle of a tense scene. I heard
Adele's voice broken with weeping:</p>

<p>"Oh, Harry, why did you come? why did you come?"</p>

<p>Then a man growling: "Damn it all, you're my wife!"</p>

<p>I recognised the voice of the sailor that Horace had
manhandled on deck.</p>

<p>"But you knew all along what I was going to do. You agreed
then."</p>

<p>"I got to thinking," muttered the man. "I couldn't stand
it."</p>

<p>"What good does it do your coming aboard?" she went on. "You
will ruin me! And yourself, too. He'll kill you if he finds out.
He's a wild beast when he's roused."</p>

<p>"He won't find out if you don't tell him."</p>

<p>"You know I won't do that. But, oh God! what torture! Every
moment! every moment! I've been sick ever since I learned you
were on the vessel. Horace is already wondering what's the
matter."</p>

<p>"Damn Horace!" said the man thickly. "Damn his soul to
hell!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush!" wailed Adele. "What good does that do?"</p>

<p>"Do you love this man?" he demanded savagely.</p>

<p>"Love him? I hate him! I hate him! You don't know what I have
to go through!"</p>

<p>"Look!" he said eagerly. "We're going to call at one of the
islands to-morrow. Come ashore with me. We'll make our way back
to New York somehow."</p>

<p>"He has promised me the Emeritinsky diamond. It's worth a
hundred thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"To hell with it! Do you want to drive me crazy?"</p>

<p>"I won't go."</p>

<p>"You've got to go!"</p>

<p>A thin hard note crept into Adele's voice. "I won't go. And
you can't make me! This is our one chance to make a stake. If I
passed it up, you would be the first one to blame me when we went
broke again. We've got to have money. How are we going to
live?"</p>

<p>There was a silence, then the man's voice, humbled, indicating
that he had given in. "But you do care for me, don't you?"</p>

<p>"You know I do!"</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "If you'll just let me see you once in a
while, I'll keep quiet."</p>

<p>"How can I do that?" mourned Adele. "Think of the risk! Oh,
God! this is awful!"</p>

<p>I stole away back up the stairs. I could not tell how suddenly
this scene might end. If the door opened there I was. Anyhow, I
had learned the nature of the situation. That was enough for the
moment, I returned to the winter-garden. The noisy game&mdash;or
another game&mdash;was still in progress. I let Mme. Storey know
that I wanted to speak to her privately. When she was able to get
away we went down to the promenade deck. On the stairway we met
Adele coming up. She had brightened up her complexions and passed
us with a sweet insincere smile.</p>

<p>Out on deck as soon as I started to tell Mme. Storey what I
had overheard, she said:</p>

<p>"Come on; let's try to intercept him on the way back to his
quarters."</p>

<p>Forward of the promenade deck and below it, there was a space
between the owner's part of the ship and the fo'c'sle that they
called the well deck. There was a ladder leading down from the
promenade. We descended it, and waited at the foot while I told
the rest of my tale. There was nobody around.</p>

<p>A door opened aft, and our sailor came out of it. He was
passing us without paying any attention when Mme. Storey said
softly:</p>

<p>"Holder!"</p>

<p>He jumped as if he had received a stab, and turned a terrified
face. He tried to recover himself but it was too late.</p>

<p>"Were you speaking to me?"</p>

<p>"No use trying to bluff it out," said Mme. Storey. "Your talk
with your wife just now was overheard."</p>

<p>"Spying!" he snarled.</p>

<p>She ignored it. "You and I have got to have a little
talk."</p>

<p>"You've got nothing to do with me!"</p>

<p>"If you act ugly," she said coldly, "I shall have to tell
Horace Laghet that you are aboard this vessel. You can figure out
what that will mean."</p>

<p>He said nothing. His chin went down. I could hear him
breathing fast.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be a party to a killing," she went on. "You'd
better come to my suite and talk things over."</p>

<p>"Not allowed in that part of the vessel," he growled.</p>

<p>"You have just come from there. If you are with me nobody will
question it."</p>

<p>He shrugged and followed us. It was after midnight, and we met
nobody in the corridor. At a sign from my employer I locked the
door of our sitting-room after we had passed in. She said:</p>

<p>"Put up your hands!"</p>

<p>He stared at her open-mouthed, and did not obey until he saw
that she had taken a small automatic from the drawer of the table
and was playing with it. Then his hands went up fast enough.</p>

<p>"Search him, Bella."</p>

<p>I took a gun from his hip-pocket. It was the only weapon he
had on him. I handed it to Mme. Storey and she threw both guns in
the drawer and closed it.</p>

<p>"You're better off without it," she said, smiling. "Sit down
and relax. Smoke a cigarette. I am not your enemy. In fact, I'm
sorry for you, though you appear to have got yourself into this
mess. Well, we usually do."</p>

<p>He sat down staring at her sullenly. He couldn't make her out
at all. He lit a cigarette in trembling fingers. One could see
the promising boy he had been with his nice eyes, and thick wavy
hair brushed straight back. Probably spoiled by his mother.</p>

<p>"You and Adele are not divorced," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"No," he growled.</p>

<p>"Were you living together up to the time she sailed?"</p>

<p>"Off and on."</p>

<p>"When Adele told you she was going to make this cruise you
didn't object."</p>

<p>Holder was silent.</p>

<p>"Then why have you started to kick up a dust now?"</p>

<p>His muttered answer was the same he had given Adele. "I got to
thinking."</p>

<p>"What started you thinking?"</p>

<p>"Aah! what's the use of all these questions!" he blurted
out.</p>

<p>"Somebody is using you as a tool," said Mme. Storey calmly,
"and I want to find out who it is."</p>

<p>This was evidently a new thought to him. He stared at her with
distended eyes, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Somebody's been after you," she suggested. "Got you all
stirred up."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "Nobody ever said anything."</p>

<p>"Then it was a letter; an anonymous letter. Signed Well-Wisher
or something like that. Good old Well-Wisher!"</p>

<p>"God! How do you know that?" he said, staring.</p>

<p>"I am merely following out a process of deduction," she said
with a shrug. "This letter asked you as a man and an American if
you were willing to stand for your wife going on a cruise in
Horace Laghet's yacht. It told you what other men would think of
you. It suggested that if you had a spark of manliness in you,
you'd put a stop to it."</p>

<p>From the frightened look that appeared in his eyes it was
evident that she had hit on the truth, or close to it.</p>

<p>"Such letters always run true to form," she went on. "It
suggested that you ship aboard the yacht so you could see what
went on..."</p>

<p>"That was the second letter," he muttered, forgetting
himself.</p>

<p>"Oh, there were two," said Mme. Storey. "Sort of follow-up
system. I suppose the second letter told you just where to go,
what to say, what name to give. Told you everything would be made
easy for you very likely. Told you you had friends who wouldn't
see you wronged!"</p>

<p>His hang-dog look confessed that she was right.</p>

<p>"And you fell for it!"</p>

<p>"I was like a crazy man," he muttered. "I couldn't help
myself."</p>

<p>"What happened after you got aboard?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was treated like anybody else."</p>

<p>"Who approached you? What proposition has been made?"</p>

<p>No answer from Holder.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey took the gun out of the drawer and examined it.
"You got this after you came aboard?"</p>

<p>"Well, I found it in my bunk," he muttered. "There was a box
of shells with it."</p>

<p>"And you were glad to get it," she suggested. "You didn't
trouble where it came from."</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Sooner or later you would have shot Horace Laghet."</p>

<p>"Well, that's my business," he growled.</p>

<p>"You would certainly have shot him that first day when he
attacked you if you'd had the gun then."</p>

<p>He scowled and twisted in his seat.</p>

<p>"And what would have happened afterwards? You would have gone
to the chair, or at least to prison for life, and somebody would
have reaped a golden harvest from Horace Laghet's death."</p>

<p>Holder said nothing.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do about it?" she asked.</p>

<p>Like a child he took refuge in his stubborn silence.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to put yourself in my hands?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Arrange for your passage from Curaçao back to New York."</p>

<p>"And leave her with him!" he growled. "I'm only flesh and
blood!"</p>

<p>"You've got to face realities!" said Mme. Storey. "If you
don't go ashore to-morrow, and stay ashore, I'll have to tell
Horace Laghet who you are. That's my job."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Adele isn't worth it," she said softly.</p>

<p>He hung his head.</p>

<p>"You know it," she murmured compassionately, "but you're in
hell just the same."</p>

<p>A spasm of intolerable pain twisted his face. His endurance
snapped. "Aah! What is it to you?" he snarled, jumping up. "You
think you have me on the grill, don't you? Good sport to sit
there and watch a man squirm! I know women...Well, to hell with
you! To hell with you! I won't leave this vessel without my wife,
and that's flat!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey shrugged and spread out her hands.</p>

<p>Holder's voice scaled up hysterically. "Go ahead and tell
Laghet!" he cried. "Tell him! Tell him! I have plenty of friends
aboard. The crew is with me. They're men, not dogs. And if Laghet
lays a finger on me they'll mutiny. Do you know what that means?
Mutiny! It will sweep you all overboard! If you know what's good
for you, you'll be the one to go ashore to-morrow. I've warned
you now! Go ashore and stay ashore, if you ever want to see New
York again." Shaking and gasping, he turned and rattled the
door.</p>

<p>"Let him out," said Mme. Storey quietly.</p>

<p>I unlocked the door and he ran down the corridor. I turned and
faced my employer.</p>

<p>"You dare not tell Laghet," I said. "Holder has the whip-hand
over us. What can you do?"</p>

<p>"It appears to be up to Adele," she said, smiling
enigmatically. "I will go and talk to her."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; AT WILLEMSTAD</h2>

<p class="first">ON the following day after lunch the
<i>Buccaneer</i> cast anchor off the port of Willemstad in the
island of Curaçao. There is a dangerous current off the mouth of
the harbour and as Horace Laghet intended to remain only long
enough to pick up Martin Coade, his secretary, they didn't want
to take the big yacht inside.</p>

<p>After six days at sea the sight of land was grateful to the
eye though it was but a brown and treeless island. However, the
beach was of the whitest, the sky of the bluest, and the town
picturesque enough with its steep-roofed Dutch houses bordering
the quays. In designing those roofs the prudent Dutch were not
taking any chances of a heavy snowfall.</p>

<p>It put Horace in a temper to learn that the liner
<i>Orizaba</i> which was bringing Martin Coade from Europe had
not yet arrived. "Nothing to see in this damned hole but oil
refineries," he growled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the indefatigable Adrian insisted on getting up a
shore party. Horace refused to accompany them, and Mme. Storey
begged off on the pretext of having letters to write. All the
others went ashore in the launch. Adele's pretty face was drawn
and haggard under the careful make-up. She had put herself into
Mme. Storey's hands the night before, and during the morning had
smuggled a small bag containing some clothes into our cabin.</p>

<p>About the same time another launch set off from the yacht
carrying a party of sailors who had been granted four hours'
shore leave. Harry Holder was amongst them. Adele had
communicated with him.</p>

<p>About an hour later the <i>Orizaba</i> hove in sight, and Mme.
Storey sent word on deck asking to be carried ashore. She carried
Adele's little bag.</p>

<p>Horace was on deck, and his eyes narrowed at the sight of the
bag. "Are you leaving us?" he asked, laughing. It had an ugly
ring.</p>

<p>"Not yet," she answered, smiling. "I have a lot of stuff to
send in the mail, and this is the easiest way to carry it."</p>

<p>He only half believed her, and for a moment I thought she
would be obliged to open her bag like a departing servant.
However, she smiled him down.</p>

<p>"Do you want company?" he asked with a hang-dog air.</p>

<p>This was awkward. "Just as you like," she said calmly. "I
shall be pretty busy at the post and the cable office."</p>

<p>He turned away sorely. "We sail at nine," he said.</p>

<p>I breathed again.</p>

<p>The entrance to the great inner harbour of Willemstad is by
way of a mile-long passage like a big canal. The town spreads
along both sides of it. The oddest feature of the place is a
pontoon bridge over the canal. The middle pontoon is equipped
with an engine and paddle wheels, and when a vessel wishes to
pass through, the bridge gives a shrill toot and paddles itself
out of the way. I am sure there is not another bridge like it in
the world.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I landed on the quay and struck into the
narrow streets of the town, gazing around us like idle
sightseers. When we had satisfied ourselves we were not being
watched, we made our way to the principal hotel and engaged a
front room. A noticeboard in the lobby informed us that the
<i>Orizaba</i> would sail for Panama at 7 p.m.</p>

<p>According to pre-arrangement we were presently joined in our
room by Adele, followed a moment or two later by Harry Holder.
The latter had procured a suit of shore clothes from an
outfitter. Apparently a reconciliation had taken place between
the pair. It was almost piteous to see how hungrily the man's
eyes dwelt on his wife's beautiful face. Adele was tense and
jumpy.</p>

<p>"Has Horace come ashore?" she asked.</p>

<p>My employer shook her head.</p>

<p>"Oh, what will he say!" murmured Adele.</p>

<p>"It would have been better to have it out with him," said Mme.
Storey dryly. "Then you could have taken all your clothes."</p>

<p>"I couldn't face him!" murmured the girl.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey shrugged. "Where are the others of the party?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"They hired an automobile to tour the island. I refused to go
because of the dust. They didn't suspect I was going to give them
the slip. They are dining at a Chinese restaurant."</p>

<p>There was little more to say. We sat down watching through the
windows. Holder took Adele's hand between his, but she jerked it
away pettishly. She was ashamed of him in his common, ill-fitting
clothes.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smoked impassively.</p>

<p>Our windows commanded a view of the sea. We saw the
<i>Orizaba</i> drop anchor and immediately become surrounded by a
fleet of small boats. Amongst them we distinguished a launch from
the <i>Buccaneer</i>. After a while it returned to the yacht
bearing Martin Coade, All we could distinguish at the distance
was that he was accompanied by a small mountain of baggage.</p>

<p>"Martin's out of the way," said Mme. Storey. "You'd better go
aboard now. Stay in your cabin until she sails."</p>

<p>We shook their hands and wished them a pleasant voyage. Mme.
Storey had already given them sufficient money to carry them to
New York. They had shipped on the <i>Orizaba</i> as Mr. and Mrs.
John Matthews. The man was wild to get aboard the vessel, but
Adele, shaking with terror, held back. Through the window she
searched the quay anxiously before she would venture out.</p>

<p>Finally they went. Watching from the window, we saw them board
a launch at the quayside, and followed it with our eyes until it
deposited them at the ladder of the <i>Orizaba</i>. We could
distinguish Adele's pink dress climbing the ladder. The two of
them were swallowed up on deck. The launch started back.</p>

<p>"Thank God that's accomplished!" I cried.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled dryly. "Unstable as water!" she said. "Such
people won't stay put. We'd better stick around a while to make
sure they don't come ashore again."</p>

<p>"Let's stay on in this hotel," I urged. "You've done your job.
You've saved Horace Laghet. Don't go back to that horrible
yacht!"</p>

<p>"Harry Holder's only a tool," she said. "There may be a dozen
such willing tools aboard the yacht. We haven't yet found the
intelligence that directs them."</p>

<p>"Don't go back!" I persisted. "The dice are loaded. You cannot
win!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not," she said soberly. "But I can't throw up a job
half-finished...However, I don't want to force you to anything
against your judgment. You can sail on the <i>Orizaba</i>,
too."</p>

<p>"You know I'm not going to leave you," I muttered.</p>

<p>And so the subject was dropped.</p>

<p>The sun went down about six o'clock, and the tropical night
descended swiftly. We left the hotel and walked along the quay
watching the animated scene. Never in my life have I seen such a
mixture of races. They speak an uncouth dialect called
papiemento, which appears to be a mixture of half the languages
on earth.</p>

<p>Presently we discovered that we were being followed by a
sailor from the <i>Buccaneer</i>. He was making no effort to
conceal himself, and it seemed as if he wanted to speak to us. So
we sat down at a sidewalk café to give him the chance.</p>

<p>He came sidling up to our table with a sheepish look like a
schoolboy. It was a good-looking young fellow whom we had seen
about the decks of the <i>Buccaneer</i>, but had never had any
speech with. His name was Wanzer.</p>

<p>"I've deserted," he said out of the corner of his mouth.
"Can't stick that hell-hole!"</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mme. Storey, running up her eyebrows. "Why
confide in me?"</p>

<p>"Thought maybe you'd stake me to a suit of clothes," he
muttered. He looked down at his smart white ducks. "How can I
make a getaway in a fancy rig like this?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, hell-hole?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'd tell you," he said, "if I was only sure of getting clear.
They'd kill me if they found out I'd told anything. There's dirty
work on board. I don't want to have nothing to do with it...I'll
tell you everything if you'll protect me."</p>

<p>"That's a fair offer," she said. "I'll take you up."</p>

<p>"Not here," he said, glancing nervously around. "The bunch has
gone off to the ship. When they find that I'm missing they'll
send ashore to look for me. I got to get under cover."</p>

<p>"Well, let me see..." she began.</p>

<p>She got no further. "Oh, God! here comes the old man now!"
said Wanzer in a terror-stricken voice. And like a shadow he had
slipped inside the café.</p>

<p>In a moment or two Captain Grober, very stiff and seamanlike,
came sauntering by. At sight of us he clicked his heels together
in the German fashion and bowed from the waist. His handsome face
was as expressionless as a plaster wall.</p>

<p>"At your service, ladies," he said. "I look for two missing
seamen; name of Johnson; name of Wanzer. Have you seen any of our
white-suit sailors during the past half-hour?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Mme. Storey innocently. "Do you suppose they
have run off?"</p>

<p>The captain shrugged. "Who can tell?"</p>

<p>"But after only six days at sea with good food and good pay,
why should they become dissatisfied?"</p>

<p>"They are American seamen," he said; "they expect to be
treated like royalty. It is not so with Germans."</p>

<p>"How can you expect to find them single-handed?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"My boat's crew is searching through the town," he said. "If
they have been hidden by others, of course, we shall not find
them. There is no time to make a house-to-house search.
Fortunately, the yacht is fully manned. They will be no great
loss."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you're not very happy aboard the
<i>Buccaneer</i>, Captain," she said, just to see what kind of an
answer she'd get.</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply as if he was about to make a
confidence; but he thought better of it, and ended with a shrug.
"It is a fine ship," he said; "the pay is very good. What more
can a seaman ask?"</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down and have a drink?" she asked.</p>

<p>He bowed again. "I thank you. I must get on with my
search...The last boat will leave at eight-thirty, madame."</p>

<p>"We'll be there," said Mme. Storey. "We are dining
ashore."</p>

<p>He backed away, still bowing, and went on down the quay. When
he had passed out of sight we finished our drinks and went inside
the café. It was a humble place, and the rough customers gaped at
the brilliant apparition of Mme Storey. She addressed herself to
the proprietor, a burly Dutchman.</p>

<p>"The sailor in the white suit who came in just now. Where is
he?"</p>

<p>He pointed impassively to an open door leading to a yard in
the rear. "I not know, my lady. He run through."</p>

<p>While we stood there wondering what to do, a small, ragged boy
with a <i>café au lait</i> complexion pulled timidly at Mme.
Storey's skirt. He was offering her a scrap of paper on which was
scribbled in pencil:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll wait for you at Feng Lee's restaurant. He gives sailors
a hideout. W."</p>

<p>"Where is Feng Lee's restaurant?" Mme. Storey asked the stolid
Dutchman.</p>

<p>He pointed through the door and across the big canal.
"Scharlo."</p>

<p>"Is it a respectable place?"</p>

<p>"Very nice. Very nice."</p>

<p>Outside we picked up a dilapidated car that was waiting for
hire. The driver knew all about Feng Lee's. "Very nice. Very
nice," he said in his turn. We rattled over the pontoon bridge,
turned to the left along the quay on the other side; crossed a
shorter bridge over an inlet, turned to the right and stopped. It
was not far.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey made a sharp survey of the place before getting
out of the car. While it was not Pierre's or Marguery's it had
the look of a popular restaurant. In the West Indies the Chinese
restaurants are generally the best. It was wide open to the
street, and brilliantly lighted inside. It was too early for
dinner, but there were already several people at the tables.
Plenty of people passing to and fro outside. In short, nothing to
arouse suspicion.</p>

<p>My employer paid off the chauffeur and we went in and sat
down. Each small table had a red-shaded lamp on it and a few limp
paper flowers in a holder. Around the walls hung red banners
engrossed with Chinese characters. In one corner an immense
phonograph was braying forth: "Lazy-bones." Just like home.</p>

<p>A smiling Chinese boy came to take our order. They are an
engaging race, but inscrutable. Mme. Storey asked for Feng Lee,
and the boy went back and fetched the proprietor from the
kitchen. This was a tall, portly Chinaman in native costume; very
dignified and wearing the beaming Oriental smile that may mean
anything or nothing. He bowed and awaited our commands.</p>

<p>"The sailor in the white suit said I should find him here,"
said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"He is waiting in the kitchen," said Feng Lee in perfect
English. He glanced at the other diners and lowered his voice.
"Would you mind stepping out there? The sailor does not want to
show himself."</p>

<p>There seemed to be no reason why we should refuse. We went
through a perfectly ordinary swing door into an ordinary kitchen:
range, carving table, sink, racks of dishes. Dinner was in full
course of preparation. There were a number of Chinese standing
about: cooks, waiters, dishwashers, all of whom turned smiling
faces at our entrance. I didn't see Wanzer.</p>

<p>While I was looking at the smiling Chinamen, their smiles
changed horribly. <i>They were all looking at something beyond
me</i>. My blood froze. Before I could act, something thick, soft
and all-enveloping was thrown over my head and drawn tight. A
hand thrust the stuff into my mouth and I could make no sound.
Nor did I hear a sound from Mme. Storey beside me. A rope was
hastily thrown around my body, pinning my arms fast. Several
hands picked me up and ran me through a door, across the dirt-
paved court, through another door which rolled heavily to behind
me, and through a third door which was unlocked with a creaking
key.</p>

<p>Inside I was dropped on a board floor. I heard the fall of
another body near me. An immensely heavy wooden door thudded to
with a dull sound and the key creaked in the lock. Then silence,
except for the soft lapping of water somewhere beneath me.</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE OPIUM
CHAMBER</h2>

<p class="first">IN their haste the Chinamen had not made a very
good job of tying me up. I found I could move my arms a little.
By rolling on the floor and twisting my arms I succeeded
gradually in working the ropes up to my elbows. That freed my
forearms, and the rest was easy. When I sat up clear of the ropes
and the suffocating quilt, a voice near me asked:</p>

<p>"Are you all right, Bella?"</p>

<p>The quiet tones put new heart into me. I schooled my voice to
answer as steadily as she had asked: "All right!" Upon putting
out my hand I found that she too had freed herself. Wherever we
were it was black as the pit.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey wasted no time in lamentations. "Let's figure this
out," she said. "When we drove across the bridge over the inlet
we turned into a street on our right. Feng Lee's joint was on the
right-hand side of that street. We were carried out through the
back of his premises. Therefore this must be his go-down on the
shore of the inlet. Hence the sound of lapping water."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had started to explore our prison on hands and
knees, feeling before me as I went.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," she said. "I'll show a light."</p>

<p>She had been seized so quickly that the rope had caught her
little handbag under her arm, and she still had it. I heard her
tapping a cigarette. She got her lighter and struck it. The
little flame revealed her quiet face almost smiling, you would
have said. She drew on the cigarette and held the lighter aloft
so we could see.</p>

<p>A small chamber, perhaps ten by ten and eight feet high, all
tightly sealed in with smooth, matched boards. The walls gave
back a dull sound when rapped with the knuckles; double walls
insulated with some sound-deadening material. The door was so
snugly fitted that we had some difficulty in finding it. The
keyhole did not come through to our side.</p>

<p>"About eight hundred cubic feet of air," I said casually. "How
long will that last for two?"</p>

<p>"The oxygen will be gone before morning," said Mme. Storey,
"but, of course, we can drag on for a while after that." She
dropped her cigarette and trod out the spark. "No use feeding our
oxygen to the gasper."</p>

<p>Apart from the door, there was nothing to break the smooth
walls of our cell except a big hook depending from the middle of
the ceiling. Mme. Storey took a good look at it, and shut off the
tiny light. "We must hoard the juice," she said.</p>

<p>She continued her deliberations in the dark. "Do you recognise
that smell, Bella?"</p>

<p>I took a sniff of the faint, acrid odour that filled the
place, and said at a venture: "Poppies."</p>

<p>"Right. Call it opium. Feng Lee must deal in it in a big way,
and this will be his store-room. What's the hook for? Well, if
there's water underneath, it would be natural to float a boat
under and bring the stuff up through a hole in the floor. The
hook is to support the tackle. If my reasoning is correct,
there's a trapdoor under the hook, Bella."</p>

<p>"The floor is perfectly smooth," I objected.</p>

<p>"Let's look."</p>

<p>With the aid of the light we succeeded in outlining the trap
in the floor, but it was so snugly fitted there seemed to be no
possibility of raising it. We clawed at it in vain.</p>

<p>"Save your finger-nails," said Mme. Storey. "Let me try to
dope this thing out. There must be some way of raising it."</p>

<p>"Maybe they push it up from below," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Never! That would make it too easy for Feng Lee's rivals to
come and rob his secret store."</p>

<p>With her sensitive fingers she patiently tested each short
length of plank in the trap-door. We saved the light. Suddenly
she said: "This piece is not nailed, though it is set in
tight."</p>

<p>She got a nail-file out of her bag and set to work to prise it
under the end of the board. It was a tedious job. In the end,
when we were not expecting it; the loose board suddenly sprang
up. We hastily lit the light and saw beneath the false flooring a
heavy iron ring for raising the trap, and two bolts driven into
the side beams to prevent it from being shoved up from below.</p>

<p>We drew back the bolts, and thrusting the loose piece of board
through the ring, stood one on each side of the trap, and raised
it between us. We let it thud back on the floor. Having no
hinges, it came away clear. We dropped on our stomachs and held
the little light down in the hole. A puff of wind blew it out,
but we saw the sulky gleam of water eight or ten feet below.</p>

<p>"At any rate, we won't suffocate now," remarked Mme. Storey
dryly.</p>

<p>The trap-door was oblong in shape. Without saying anything
further, she shoved it around until the wide side was athwart the
hole in the floor. Then she tied together the ropes that had
bound us, and tied one end to the iron ring. My heart sank when I
saw what she was up to. It was not sharks that I feared, but a
smaller and deadlier creature. All I said was:</p>

<p>"Barracuda."</p>

<p>"Oh, the barracuda is a sporting fish," she said lightly.
"He's no wharf rat."</p>

<p>I wasn't so sure of that, but it was useless for me to
protest; useless to offer to go in her place.</p>

<p>She tucked her dress around her waist, and lowered herself
through the hole. She slowly sank out of sight. The light had
been left to me. I reached it down through the hole so she could
see, shielding it from the draught with my free hand. Presently
her voice came up:</p>

<p>"Put it out!"</p>

<p>All I could see was a wilderness of black piles with the water
sucking around them. After I had blown out the light, she
said:</p>

<p>"I can see star-shine a little way off. I'm going to swim for
it. Stay there and guide me back with your voice if I need
it."</p>

<p>I heard the soft splash as the water took her. For a moment or
two I could hear her cautious strokes as she swam away&mdash;then
silence.</p>

<p>I could never tell you how long a time passed. The one who is
left behind has the hardest job. Nothing to do but clench my
teeth and see it through. I gripped the edge of the hole and
stuck my head down, straining my ears. No sound but an occasional
lap of the water like some vast creature licking its lips. All
else silence like total deafness.</p>

<p>Silence...silence, except for the lazy licking of the water
and the beating of my own heart. How long had I been waiting? How
long must I go on waiting? It was easier to go down a rope than
to climb up again.</p>

<p>A sound outside the door of my cell jerked me into an upright
position as if I had been electrified. I heard the key thrust
into the lock. It creaked. Quicker than thought I made my choice.
Catching hold of the edge of the floor, I swung down through the
hole and let go. The warm water closed over my head.</p>

<p>When I rose to the surface I was dimly aware of a lighted
square above me with heads sticking over. I heard a guttural
voice giving an order. I struck out blindly. They launched the
heavy trap-door through the hole. It struck the water just behind
me with a tremendous splash, sending out a wave that washed over
my head. But I was safe.</p>

<p>My head collided with one of the piles, knocking the sense out
of me. As I choked and struggled in the water a hand closed in my
hair. I fought back blindly. I heard a well-known voice saying:
"Easy! Easy, Bella! I've got a boat!" I went limp all over.
Somehow I was dragged into the boat, and dropped in the
bottom.</p>

<p>While I lay there gasping, Mme. Storey was shoving the boat
along from pile to pile. We shot out under the starry sky. She
sat down and, snatching up the oars, began to row for our lives.
The inlet was something less than a quarter of a mile wide, I
judged, with lights sparkling on the other side. Close at hand
was a huddle of buildings along the shore, with wharves and go-
downs rising blackly against the stars.</p>

<p>She had not taken more than a few strokes when we heard
somewhere close behind us the exhaust of motor-boat as the
flywheel was turned over. Instantly she headed the row-boat under
the nearest wharf and took in her oars. I sat up and helped her
push it from pile to pile just as deep under as we could get. We
grounded in the mud of the bank.</p>

<p>Through the piles we had glimpses of the motor-boat, a heavy
craft without much speed. Somebody in it was flashing a powerful
light under the wharves as they went by. We dropped in the bottom
of our boat so that no stray beam might pick up our white faces.
A moment or two of agonising suspense and then we breathed again.
We were too deep under and there were too many piles between;
they had passed by. We pushed the boat along under the wharves in
the opposite direction until I judged we were under Feng Lee's
go-down again. This was the last structure on piles, and we had
to come out into the open beyond. We could see the motor-boat
down near the bridge over the mouth of the inlet, the light still
flashing alongshore.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey started rowing across the inlet while I steered
with a spare oar. They could not have heard us owing to the noise
of their own engine, but it was possible they might see us when
we came out in the open. But they were a good way off and we felt
that we would be safe once we could land. All the inhabitants of
Willemstad were not thugs.</p>

<p>It was one of those enchanting tropical nights with a cool
breeze ruffing the surface of the water and a multitude of
strange stars hanging out their little lamps. From far off we
could hear the sounds of our own kind, and wished they were
nearer; the slam of a door; the whirring of an automobile
starter; a steamship whistle.</p>

<p>The motor-boat down by the bridge suddenly stopped its engine,
and we had a nasty moment of anxiety. Mme. Storey lay on her oars
and we bent over double in the boat, though it was little good
that could have done us. The engine started again, and my
employer made the water fly from her oars. However, we were still
safe. They did not come our way.</p>

<p>We were bitterly disappointed to discover that the other shore
of the inlet was swampy. A broad belt of mud separated us from a
firm footing; soft stuff that would certainly have swallowed us
to the waist if we had stepped in it. The buildings on this side
were a long way back. We rowed along towards the bridge looking
for a landing.</p>

<p>The motor-boat went under the bridge and disappeared and our
hearts rose. Not for long. The flash of the light warned us that
they were returning. They stopped under the bridge and a man
climbed out and took up his station in the middle of it. They
were satisfied that we were still inside.</p>

<p>On our side of the inlet between us and the bridge there were
several dark and empty scows anchored in line. We made haste to
reach the nearest one, and hung close under its shadow, crouching
in our boat and watching to see what the Chinamen would do. This
time they headed for our side of the inlet and began to search
around the first scow.</p>

<p>A grim game of hide-and-seek followed. Fortunately for us we
were able to follow their movements and to anticipate them by the
reflection of their flashlight. As they passed around one side of
a scow we softly drew ourselves around to the other. They moved
quicker, but we could manoeuvre in a smaller space.</p>

<p>As they made their way back from scow to scow we were stealing
ahead. Motor-boat and skiff wove a kind of chain in and out
between the scows. There was a moment when the slow chug of the
engine passed within fifty feet of us on the other side of a
scow. We could even hear an undertone of whining, sing-song
voices.</p>

<p>Finally they set off towards the head of the inlet. We pulled
ahead to the first scow. Here we were within fifty yards of the
bridge with the solitary figure standing upon it, outlined
against the night sky.</p>

<p>"Safety lies on the other side of the bridge," whispered Mme.
Storey. "We must make a break for it." I clenched my teeth and
hands to keep from shaking.</p>

<p>"He is certainly armed," I said.</p>

<p>She made no answer. We waited a little in an agony of
indecision. Then we heard voices approaching. How my heart went
out to those unknown speakers! Three men came in sight walking
towards the bridge from the direction of town.</p>

<p>"Now!" said Mme. Storey. "He won't dare shoot with others
looking on!"</p>

<p>She bent her back to the oars while I stood up in the stern
and helped the best I could by using the third oar as a paddle.
With all our efforts we seemed to crawl like a turtle. The
instant we came out from the shadow of the scow the man on the
bridge raised his voice in a long-drawn cry like a night-
bird.</p>

<p>I experienced a hideous moment of fear when I passed beneath
the bridge. But I wasn't annihilated. When we issued from under
the other side three curious heads were sticking over the rail,
watching us. From the inlet we could hear the motor-boat
approaching at its best speed.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards separated us from the great canal
connecting the inner harbour with the sea. Here there were a
number of vessels moving back and forth, amongst them a big
tanker nosing her way into the harbour, and a speedy motor-boat
coming out.</p>

<p>The latter was heading directly for us. She had a small
searchlight mounted on the bow. We could hear the loud voices of
men aboard; apparently speaking English. As she came abreast
somebody turned the searchlight on us and instantly there was a
chorus of cries.</p>

<p>"By God, fellows, look what's here!...Hello, girls!...Nice
night for a row!...Come aboard and have a drink!" etc., etc.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey called back: "Give us a tow, boys!"</p>

<p>Instantly they stopped and reversed their engine with a great
kick-up astern. We rowed alongside, and Mme. Storey handed the
end of our painter to a baldheaded old beachcomber who leaned
over the side of the launch to take it.</p>

<p>"Won't you come aboard, darlings?" he asked, grinning.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," answered Mme. Storey in a voice so quiet and
peremptory that he meekly turned and made the rope fast around a
cleat astern. He gave word for the engine to be started.</p>

<p>At the same moment the motor-boat with the Chinese aboard
issued out of the inlet. We were jerked forward with a violence
that almost threw us on our backs, and it soon became apparent
that the other boat was nowhere as regards speed. The man who was
amusing himself with the searchlight cast it briefly on the
Chinese. Their impassive faces gave nothing away. They followed
us for a little, and then finding it to be useless, went
back.</p>

<p>It soon became clear that we had only exchanged one danger for
another. The steersman ahead was as tight as the rest of them,
and we pursued a crazy, zigzag course through the canal. It was
only owing to the special Providence that looks after drunken men
that we didn't hit anything.</p>

<p>Our skiff behaved like a hooked fish, shooting off first to
one side, then the other. Every moment I expected to feel her
capsizing under me. Mme. Storey stationed me in the stern with an
oar to steer her, but the speed almost tore the oar out of my
hands. She shouted to the bald-headed man to shorten the tow
line, but he was too foggy to get it. The wash of the speed-boat
roared past like a cataract.</p>

<p>The motor-boat was of the trunk cabin type, with a cockpit
astern. There were about six men aboard her. Two of them arose
with drunken impressiveness, and with their arms full of bottles
of beer, stood up on the stern seat and commenced bombarding us
with the bottles. Their aim was bad. Mme. Storey was able to
catch but one.</p>

<p>She cracked off the neck and drank off half the contents,
passing the rest back to me. "Thirsty work!" she said. "Save the
bottle!"</p>

<p>We roared through the gap in the pontoon bridge without
slackening speed, and headed out into the open sea. Heaven knows
where that drunken crew thought they were bound for. Luckily the
sea was calm. The <i>Buccaneer</i>, with her lines of sparkling
lights, came into view off to the right. Mme. Storey did her best
to make the men understand that was where we wanted to go, but by
this time they had their heads together in the cockpit, emitting
what they thought was close harmony, and either they could not or
they would not hear her.</p>

<p>It was a comical situation; terribly dangerous, too. The sea
was so vast and so dark. The <i>Buccaneer</i> began to drop
astern, and I had visions of being carried out into that waste of
water and swamped while the motorboat sped on regardless.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey asked me for the broken bottle, and I handed it
over. Kneeling in the bow of the skiff, she sawed at the taut
rope with the jagged edge of glass. Absorbed in their singing,
the men had forgotten us for the time being. The severed ends of
the rope leaped into the air, the motor-boat sprang ahead, and
the water ceased to roar past us.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey picked up the oars and started rowing for the
yacht. We could follow the motor-boat by her lights, but as far
as they were concerned, we were immediately swallowed by the
night. In a minute or two they stopped, and we saw the little
searchlight swinging wildly around. Then they went on. One could
picture how they shrugged with drunken heedlessness, and let us
go.</p>

<p>On the way to the yacht, one of her launches passed us far to
the right, coming off from the town. It was the fancy plate-glass
and mahogany affair that carried the owner and his guests, but
she was too far away for us to see who was aboard. It was then
about a quarter to nine.</p>

<p>As we drew near the yacht's ladder a group of sailors on the
boat-deck were hoisting the launch out of the water. Apparently
they did not see us in the dark. When we stepped out on the
little platform Mme. Storey gave the skiff a thrust with her foot
and it drifted away on the tide. As we started up the ladder the
head of a sailor appeared over the rail and was swiftly
withdrawn. We reached the deck just in time to see him scuttling
out of sight up forward.</p>

<p>"Wanzer," said Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>There was no one else in sight on the promenade. We could hear
voices from the winter-garden above. In our wet and bedraggled
state we didn't want to meet anyone, and we quietly ran down the
companionway to our cabins. On the stairs we heard the shrill
whistle of the boatswain's whistle on deck, signifying that the
yacht was about to get under way.</p>

<p>"Hm! they didn't waste much time looking for us," remarked
Mme. Storey.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX. &mdash; OUT OF THE AIR</h2>

<p class="first">WE changed from the skin out, wrapped malines
around our hair to conceal the fact that it was still dampish,
and sallied up above. When we looked out on deck we could see the
lights of Willemstad disappearing astern.</p>

<p>In the pretty green and white winter-garden on the boat-deck,
Adrian, Sophie, Emil and Celia were sitting around sipping
planter's punch. I expected to create a sensation upon entering,
but not a bit of it. They were not surprised&mdash;or if they
were; they hid it well. Apparently we had not been missed.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Adrain off-hand, "did you dine ashore?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mme. Storey. This was true, because we hadn't had
any dinner at all. I wasn't conscious until that moment that I
was hungry.</p>

<p>"Oh, we had a wonderful drive," said Sophie in her gushing
manner.</p>

<p>Sophie paid her way by praising everything up to the skies.
"And afterwards such a dinner in a Chinese restaurant! Feng
Lee's, it was called. Marvellous food, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Feng Lee's a great character," said Mme. Storey
dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, do you know the place," said Sophie.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey let it go at that. "Where's Horace?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Somewhere out on deck," said Adrian carelessly. There was an
awkward silence. It was broken by young Celia, who blurted out:
"He's in an awful temper. We're all afraid to speak to him."</p>

<p>"Celia!" said her mother reprovingly.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of him," said Mme. Storey. "I'll go find
him."</p>

<p>As we turned towards the door Adele came in, fragile and
lovely as a dream creature in a cloud of pink organdie. My jaw
must have dropped a full inch. Fortunately my back was turned to
the others in the room. Adele, whom I had seen sailing away on
the <i>Orizaba</i>, as I supposed! I had the impulse to pass my
hand weakly over my face.</p>

<p>She was not surprised to see us, though it put her out of
countenance. "Hello!" she said to Mme. Storey. "I was wondering
where you were!...Come out on deck a moment," she added swiftly
in a whisper, "and I'll explain."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey hid whatever surprise she may have
felt&mdash;after all, she had said that Adele would never go. Her
smile was rather grim. "What a lovely dress!" she said. "And oh!
my dear, that marvellous jewel!"</p>

<p>I saw then that Adele was wearing, partly hidden under an
organdie ruffle, a superb, pear-shaped diamond almost as big as a
pigeon's egg. Half-veiled by the thin stuff, the enormous gem
shone with a wicked gleam that would have seduced the most
virtuous of women. The Emeretinsky diamond!</p>

<p>"Horace gave it to me a long time ago," she said, fingering
it. (How convincingly the woman could lie!) "To-night he asked me
to wear it!"</p>

<p>"We nearly dropped dead when we saw it!" gushed Sophie in the
background. "It is lovelier than the Kohinoor!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey, Adele and I sauntered out on deck in a natural
manner. "What a shock you must have got when you saw me!" said
Adele nervously. "I was hoping that I could see you alone first
and explain."</p>

<p>"What is the explanation?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Well, Harry and I talked things over after we got aboard the
<i>Orizaba</i>," said Adele glibly, "and we decided that it would
be better for everybody if I came back to the yacht instead of
breaking things off with a lot of fuss and scandal. So Harry's
gone back to New York, and here I am. I came off early and had
dinner with Horace on the yacht."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe me?" said Adele hotly. "Well, what do I
care whether you believe me or not? I'm not accountable to you
for my actions, and don't you think it! If my husband is
satisfied that's enough for me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite!" said Mme. Storey, blowing a ring of cigarette
smoke and following it with her eyes.</p>

<p>Adele stood trembling with rage, trying to think of a
rejoinder that would crush her. But nothing came. With a stamp of
her foot and a defiant flirt of pink organdie, she turned back
into the winter-garden.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly lying," I murmured. "What do you suppose really
happened?"</p>

<p>"Time will tell," said Mme. Storey calmly. "Come on, let's
look for Horace."</p>

<p>We found him below on the promenade deck, moodily chewing an
unlighted cigar. To Horace, anyhow, our appearance was
sensational. When he saw us coming along the deck his eyes almost
started from his head. One might have thought we were a pair of
ghosts that had materialised out of nothing before him. Without
knowing what he was doing, he tossed the unsmoked cigar
overboard. He took a step forward, and seizing Mme. Storey by the
elbows, gave her a shake, half-overjoyed, half-exasperated.</p>

<p>"Rosika! Rosika!" he cried. "How did you come aboard?"</p>

<p>"In a row-boat," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>I had never seen the man so moved. I understood then that
Adele's star was rapidly declining in his affections while my
employer's rose. But I don't think he realised it as yet.</p>

<p>"Then you changed your mind!" he cried. "Or perhaps you were
only fooling me!"</p>

<p>"You're talking in riddles," she said. "Why did you set sail
without even inquiring what had become of us?"</p>

<p>"Without inquiring?" he said indignantly. "What do you make of
this!"</p>

<p>He pulled a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and handed
it to her. She carried it under a light and read out:</p>

<p>"DEAR HORACE:</p>

<p>"The situation is impossible and it is useless to go on with
it. Bella and I will not return to the yacht. It will do you no
good to try to find us, as I mean to keep safely out of the way
until you have sailed. I am doing this in order to avoid an
unpleasant quarrel. You may ship our things back to New York from
any port where you touch.</p>

<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>"ROSIKA STOREY."</p>

<p>"A clumsy forgery," she said.</p>

<p>"How was I to know that?" growled Horace. "I have never seen
your handwriting!"</p>

<p>"You could have found samples of it in my cabin to compare
with this."</p>

<p>"Well...it sounded like you! It made me sore! I haven't told
anybody about this note."</p>

<p>"You mean your conscience was bad. You know very well that you
have not kept the agreement we made before I came aboard."</p>

<p>He impatiently waved this aside. "What did happen?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," she said. "Who gave you this note?"</p>

<p>"It was brought off from the town in a motor-boat about seven-
thirty. It was handed me by a young fellow who said he had been
instructed not to put it in any hands but mine."</p>

<p>"A Chinaman?"</p>

<p>"No. Mulatto. But there were Chinese in the boat that brought
him. I looked over the rail. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>She gave him a brief and graphic account of what had happened
to us. Horace was furious. He cursed and pounded the rail with
his clenched fist.</p>

<p>"We'll go right back!" he cried. "We'll lodge that dirty Chink
and his gang behind the bars for this!"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," said Mme. Storey. "Feng Lee is nothing in our
lives. He's in Curaçao and we're on the high seas. We have
nothing further to fear from him. What we've got to do is to find
the man who hired him, and he's right on this ship!"</p>

<p>Horace calmed down. "You suspect the Captain?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shrugged. "I have no evidence, but I don't see who else it
could have been."</p>

<p>"I'll find out!" said Horace.</p>

<p>"Better not show your hand until we have more to go on."</p>

<p>Just then Adele came along the deck with a highly self-
conscious air. She wanted to find out what Mme. Storey was
telling Horace.</p>

<p>"Hello, Horace," she said with dulcet sweetness, "I've been
looking for you everywhere!" She slipped her arm through his.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello," he said with a careless fondness that was little
better than insulting. He freed his arm. "Run along like a good
girl. Mme. Storey and I have a little business to talk over. I'll
be with you directly."</p>

<p>"Must I be kept out of it?" she said, pouting.</p>

<p>"It hasn't anything to do with you," said Horace.</p>

<p>This satisfied her for the moment. "I'll wait for you in the
music-room," she said, leaving us.</p>

<p>The music-room was alongside where we were standing. Mme.
Storey, as if by accident, led Horace a little farther away as
they resumed their talk.</p>

<p>"All these things going on under my nose and you ask me to do
nothing about it!" cried Horace.</p>

<p>"Has the Captain informed you that two men deserted at
Willemstad?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then here's something you can do. When you see the Captain
let it fall casually, that I mentioned I had run into him looking
for the deserters, and see what he says. We may catch him
napping."</p>

<p>"If he's guilty his face will give him away when I tell him
you are safe aboard."</p>

<p>"We were seen coming up the ladder," she said dryly. "You will
find his face prepared for the news."</p>

<p>"If he knows you got safe away he must know that you have told
me the whole story," objected Horace. "Why should I make out I
know nothing?"</p>

<p>"The more you can keep him guessing the better chance we have
of catching him out," she said.</p>

<p>Horace moved his shoulders impatiently. He could never take
kindly to a suggestion from without.</p>

<p>"And watch yourself!" added Mme. Storey seriously. "If they
imagine that we have them on the run they'll become
reckless."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said, only half-listening.</p>

<p>While Horace went in search of the Captain, Mme. Storey and I
ascended to the wireless cabin on the boat-deck to ask if any
messages had come while we were ashore. The operator was a young
lad called Charlie, who, like many a man before him, had fallen
for my employer's dark eyes. His face lighted up like a turned-on
lamp when we appeared in his doorway.</p>

<p>"No message for you," he said, "but look what I picked out of
the air while we were lying at anchor. Funny doings aboard the
<i>Orizaba</i>. As a criminologist, I thought it would interest
you."</p>

<p>He handed her a form covered with his flowing handwriting. She
read it and passed it to me with an inscrutable face. "Time has
told sooner than I expected," she murmured. Charlie didn't hear
it. I read:</p>

<p>"CHIEF OF POLICE,</p>

<p>"WILLEMSTAD.</p>

<p>"Shortly after weighing anchor this evening the attention of a
steward aboard my ship was attracted by a pounding on one of the
state-room doors. A passenger from Willemstad to Panama, one John
Matthews, was discovered to be locked in and the key missing.
Upon being released, he claimed that after coming aboard with his
wife an hour before, she had contrived to drug him with a drink
in the state-room, and had then locked him in and had returned
ashore. He demanded to be taken back to Willemstad. I refused to
bring my ship about, whereupon, seeing a motor-boat passing, he
leaped overboard. I hove to, and played searchlights on the spot.
I saw him picked up by the small boat and continued my voyage.
This for your information.</p>

<p>"B. CARSTAIRS, MASTER, R.M.S. <i>Orizaba</i>."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" said Charlie, grinning.</p>

<p>"Oh, the lady wanted to get rid of her husband painlessly,"
said Mme. Storey. "Not an uncommon situation."</p>

<p>The boy laughed. Horace, hearing our voices, appeared in the
doorway of the wireless-room, and young Charlie froze up, as
Horace's employees did in his presence. We strolled along the
deck with Horace. He said:</p>

<p>"The Captain said it was true that two sailors had deserted in
Willemstad; Wanzer and Johnson. He said he hadn't troubled me
about the matter because the ship was amply manned, anyhow."</p>

<p>"He is lying," said Mme. Storey crisply. "It is the first
positive bit of evidence we have got against him. I saw Wanzer on
deck just before we weighed anchor. And I have reason to believe
the other man is aboard also."</p>

<p>"Johnson?" asked Horace carelessly. "What's he got to do with
the situation?"</p>

<p>"He's the sailor with whom you had a run-in on deck the first
day."</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried Horace. "We'd be well rid of that mutineer."</p>

<p>"I've got to tell you the whole story now," my employer
continued, "so that you can take measures to protect yourself.
Johnson's real name is Harry Holder."</p>

<p>Horace stopped short, staring. "What are you saying?" he
cried. "Holder?"</p>

<p>"No other," she said dryly. "Adele's lawful husband, it
appears."</p>

<p>His face flamed with rage. "Why didn't you tell me this
before?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want you to kill the man while we looked on. I
persuaded him and Adele to sail for home on the <i>Orizaba</i> as
the easiest way of avoiding trouble. But Adele backed out, as you
know, and now it appears that Holder hasn't gone either."</p>

<p>"By God! Do you mean that woman had the face to bring..."</p>

<p>"Wait! Let's be fair to her. It was somebody else who smuggled
Holder aboard, and tried to heat him up to the point of shooting
you. Adele was terrified when she found him here."</p>

<p>"But after having left him she came off from the town this
evening all smiles and sweetness! Said she'd come back early
because she couldn't bear to let me dine alone! God, I thought I
knew women! But they can always go you one worse!"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, she hadn't yet got the diamond you promised
her."</p>

<p>"Damnation!" cried Horace.</p>

<p>"How do you know Holder didn't go either?"</p>

<p>She handed over the wireless message. "Charlie got this out of
the air just as an amusing case."</p>

<p>When he had read it Horace was beside himself with rage. He
walked away from us cursing under his breath and unconsciously
shaking his clenched fists. He came back growling:</p>

<p>"I'll have the ship searched. I'll find him! I'll find them
both! We'll have a show-down now!"</p>

<p>"Just as you will," said Mme. Storey mildly. "But if the
search is carried out by the same men who have an interest in
hiding the sailors, your chances of finding them are not very
good, are they?"</p>

<p>"I'll head the search myself," he growled.</p>

<p>Adele appeared on the stairway from the deck below. She came
towards us pouting like a child who is sure of getting what it
wants. "Horace, how long are you going to keep me waiting?" she
said.</p>

<p>He turned on her with blazing eyes. I thought he was going to
strike her, but he held himself in. He didn't say anything. It
wasn't necessary. The heat of his rage shrivelled her. She drew
back, terrified, and her hand instinctively closed over the
diamond on her breast.</p>

<p>Observing the action, Horace laughed harshly and walked away
up forward.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; THE BANJO-
STRUMMER</h2>

<p class="first">THE swimming-pool gave me more pleasure than
anything else aboard the <i>Buccaneer</i>. It was constructed
deep in the hold of the yacht, forward of the engine space, the
bottom of the pool resting on the keel, so that the water in it
served as ballast.</p>

<p>It had been Horace's notion to have the whole place furnished
in dull black marble, with a row of slender pillars all around.
Overhead there was a dome of coloured glass with lights behind it
to give the illusion of sunlight shining through. There was a row
of dressing-boxes along the far end with curtains hanging in
front, but these were never used. We dressed in our cabins.</p>

<p>Regularly at eight o'clock every morning I used to run down
and dive in. At this hour I had the pool to myself. Horace, an
early riser, had finished his swim, and the others were too lazy
or too timid to enjoy cold water upon getting out of bed.</p>

<p>On the morning after we sailed from Willemstad, I dressed
after my swim and went up to breakfast. This was a sort of
movable feast in the English fashion. There was an electric table
in the dining-saloon to keep things hot, and you went in and
helped yourself whenever you had a mind to.</p>

<p>I breakfasted alone this morning. As I was finishing I heard
the sound of a banjo being played on deck. A gay and careless
tune, surprising to hear on that luckless vessel. So I went to
investigate.</p>

<p>I found the player sunk deep in an easy-chair on the after-
deck, with his heels cocked up on a table, and the banjo in his
lap. I got a good look at him before he saw me. A tall, lean,
ugly young man wearing glasses. He was playing the sort of
rollicking tune that you associate with old-time minstrels, but
when he threw back his head and sang, I discovered that the words
were Spanish. Something about <i>Simbolico Nombray</i>.</p>

<p>I knew it must be Martin Coade, Horace's secretary. Upon
catching sight of me he never batted an eye nor stopped
strumming, but sang out:</p>

<p>"Hello, Bella!"</p>

<p>"Hello yourself," I said.</p>

<p>He made believe to be greatly alarmed. "Cheese it, Bella! Your
roof's on fire! Don't come near me, girl! It's hot enough
already!"</p>

<p>"Well! My hair is red, but it's not as red as all that." He
was deliberately trying to rile me, so I held myself in. "You're
pretty fresh," I said.</p>

<p>"Fresh as new-made beer!" he cried, strumming a loud chord on
the banjo. "I foam at the tap!"</p>

<p>"Unfit to drink," I said.</p>

<p>He was one of those funny men who never laugh themselves. His
grey eyes were sharp behind his glasses, and he had a way of
searching you through and through like certain children I have
known, and then coming out with something nasty. How he guessed
that I detested the name of Nellie I could never tell you. "Come
and sit down beside me, Nellie," he said, "and let's get
acquainted."</p>

<p>I remained by the rail. "Thanks, I like it better here," I
said. "There's more air."</p>

<p>He played a little obbligato on the banjo and sang;</p>

<p class="poem">"Nellie! Nellie! Give me your answer, do!<br> I'm
half crazy all for the love of you!"</p>

<p>"Not very good," I said.</p>

<p>He became serious. Blinking rapidly behind his glasses, he
said: "Nellie, what's the situation aboard this hooker? I dropped
in on it yesterday all unprepared. Something tells me there's
hell to pay. Put me wise, kid, so I won't make a crashing fool of
myself."</p>

<p>"I couldn't stop you from that," I said.</p>

<p>"Smarty! On the level, Nell, give me the dope."</p>

<p>"I know nothing," I said.</p>

<p>He struck a chord and sustained it. "You lie, darling!"</p>

<p>"Horace is the right one to tell you."</p>

<p>"Can you see me asking him? Horace has to be handled with due
regard to antisepsis, my love. You and I ought to form the
Secretaries' Club for mutual support and protection."</p>

<p>"Suits me," I said.</p>

<p>"Then come and sit down and let's organise."</p>

<p>By this time the others were beginning to appear on deck. The
first to pass us was Mme. Storey, taking her morning
constitutional alone. Her face was serene as it always is when
she is thinking hardest. She smiled at us and went on.</p>

<p>An extraordinary expression came into Martin's face. "Some
doll!" he murmured.</p>

<p>The cheap phrase angered me, and I suppose it showed in my
face when I turned on him. At any rate, he blinked rapidly and
tried to smooth me down by asking:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you introduce me?"</p>

<p>"You didn't wait for an introduction to me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're such a cuddly bit, Bella, it didn't seem
necessary. Aren't we both secretaries together? But Rosika is
so...so pictureskew and monumental she puts the fear of God into
me."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"<i>Quelle femme! Quelle femme!</i>" he murmured, with more
stunts on the banjo.</p>

<p>Presently Sophie and Adrian walked briskly past us. They were
both great talkers, and one could hardly wait until the other was
through. They didn't listen to each other. Martin followed them
with his eyes grinning derisively.</p>

<p>"What brought those two so close?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's natural for people aboard ship to pair off," I
said.</p>

<p>"That's no natural pairing off, ducky. They love each other
like the Chinese and the Japs."</p>

<p>The next couple to pass was young Emil and Celia, trying to
conceal how happy they were in each other's company, and not
succeeding.</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Martin; "that lad was hired to claw the ivories and
not to strut with the boss's girl. A mere piano-player is not
supposed to have the feelings of a man."</p>

<p>"Emil happens to be a great artist," I said indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah?" said Martin. "Listen to this!" And he punished the
banjo further.</p>

<p>Finally Adele passed with Dr. Tanner. I have had no occasion
to mention him before. He occupied a position something between
that of ship's officer and guest. A young man with protuberant
black eyes and a silky moustache. I didn't like him. Adele was
talking to him in an emotional way, and he was listening with a
wooden face, occasionally nodding his head wisely.</p>

<p>"I reckon the boss is fed up with Fluffy Ruffles," said
Martin.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"When a woman like Adele gets shipped she has to pick up
another fellow quick in order to save her face...Oh, well, it was
inevitable!"</p>

<p>"Why inevitable?"</p>

<p>Martin blinked rapidly behind his glasses. "What chance has a
chicken when the bird of paradise comes aboard?"</p>

<p>When she had taken her regular number of turns around the
deck, Mme. Storey dropped into the chair on the other side of
Martin. She didn't bother about preliminaries, but started in as
if she had always known him:</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've come aboard. I'm depending on you to help me
handle Horace."</p>

<p>Martin straightened up and left off playing the banjo. He
blinked and ran his fingers inside his collar. "Lady, you can put
your foot on this neck. Or say the word and I'll leap over yonder
rail with my banjo. But I cannot undertake to make my wealthy
boss act like a reasonable man."</p>

<p>She laughed at his nonsense. "You have more influence over him
than you think. Judging from the way he talks about you, I should
say you were the only person aboard to whom he is really
attached."</p>

<p>Martin searched her with his keen glance from behind the
glasses. "Not the only one," he said meaningly. "You are putting
me on a painful spot, Lady. Asking me to embalm myself for the
sake of another."</p>

<p>He didn't get any change out of Mme. Storey. "Yes, yes, it's
very sad!" she said with mock sympathy. "But the man who enjoys
hearing himself talk will never die of grief!"</p>

<p>Martin dropped his fooling. "What <i>is</i> the situation?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"You know why I was invited to join this cruise?" she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Horace wirelessed me that."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you any more now," she said. "Too many people
about. You and I mustn't appear to become confidential. I'll find
an opportunity later. We will work together."</p>

<p>Horace came up the little service stairway towards the stern.
He was followed by Mr. Niederhoff, the natty first-officer, big
Les Farman, the handsomest sailor aboard, and Fahrig, a mean-
looking steward who, I had been told, was the Captain's personal
servant.</p>

<p>Horace approached us with a face as black as thunder. Martin
began to strum softly on the banjo. Fahrig slipped away forward;
Niederhoff went to the rail and stood staring at the sea, while
Les Farman remained standing by the stairway. It was only too
clear that there had been violent scenes below.</p>

<p>Horace snarled at Martin: "Stop that damned noise!"</p>

<p>Martin sucked in his cheek, and laid the banjo softly on the
table. Horace dropped heavily into the chair beyond Madame
Storey. The man appeared to be poisoned with baulked anger. My
employer said:</p>

<p>"Have you finished the search?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he growled. "Didn't find either of them."</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied they are not aboard?"</p>

<p>"No!" he cried with an oath. "I believe the whole gang is in
cahoots! The hull is divided into five compartments. There are
watertight doors between them which are not supposed to be
opened. But while we were crossing over the deck from one
compartment to another, what was to prevent them from opening the
doors below and slipping through?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey prudently held her tongue. Even her silence
exasperated him. "Why don't you say: 'I told you so!'" he
snarled. "You're thinking it!"</p>

<p>She shrugged slightly and said nothing.</p>

<p>Horace's poisoned glance happened to fall on Les Farman at
that moment. The good-looking sailor was merely standing awaiting
further orders with a composed face, but Horace's rage had
reached the pitch where it had to have some object to vent itself
on. He jumped up.</p>

<p>"What are you standing there for looking at me?" he cried.
"Get to your work!"</p>

<p>The sailor looked at him in surprise. "You hadn't told me if
you wanted me any further," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want you!" shouted Horace. "Get the hell
forward where you belong!"</p>

<p>Les Farman gave him a slow, hard look and started forward. He
didn't move fast enough to suit the infuriated Horace, who gave
him a violent push from behind. When Les recovered his balance he
turned around with a white face and an ugly furrow etched on his
brow. He came back to Horace with clenched fists. I thoughts we
were in for it then. I saw Niederhoff coming up, reaching for his
hip-pocket as if to protect Horace.</p>

<p>Les Farman himself saved the situation. He held himself in
with an effort, and a hard grin spread across his handsome face.
"Keep your shirt on, boss," he drawled. And went quietly
forward.</p>

<p>Naturally, this didn't make Horace feel any better. He dropped
into the chair beside Mme. Storey with a groan. Meanwhile,
Niederhoff slipped down the stairway. My employer was not
disposed to spare Horace now. She said quietly:</p>

<p>"You have made an enemy of the best man aboard the ship."</p>

<p>"Aah! what the hell!" snarled Horace. "What's one more or
less?"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE DANCE OF
DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">WHILE we were all gathered around the table at
lunch Adrian Laghet, in his light-headed way, proposed that we
have a dance on deck that night.</p>

<p>"The wind goes down with the sun every evening, and the nights
are like black velvet," he said sentimentally. "It would be a
shame not to take advantage of it."</p>

<p>Horace, who had scarcely spoken throughout the meal, sneered
at his brother's effusiveness. His ill-tempered glance travelled
from face to face around the table, watching to see how we would
react to the suggestion. Mme. Storey, who knew how to handle
Horace, made believe to express pleasure.</p>

<p>"Up on the boat-deck," she said, "under the stars."</p>

<p>The others were dead against it. Martin, Sophie, Dr. Tanner;
even Emil and Celia, who were no doubt longing to dance with each
other, must have felt that it would be unsafe to do so under
Horace's poisoned glance. Adele, who sat at the table like a wan
ghost, said nothing, but her face was expressive enough. And
perhaps mine was also! Imagine getting up a dance with such ugly
hidden passions smouldering under hatches.</p>

<p>When Horace saw that the majority was against it, nothing
could have held him back. He laughed harshly and struck the
table. "Fine!" he said. "We'll trip the light fantastic until
dawn!"</p>

<p>"Can I give orders to have the boat-deck decorated?" asked
Adrian eagerly.</p>

<p>"Go as far as you like!" said Horace.</p>

<p>Later, Mme. Storey found Horace alone in his den on the boat-
deck. "You'd better call off this dance before the preparations
go too far," she said.</p>

<p>"Why!" he said in pretended surprise, "you welcomed the idea
at the lunch-table."</p>

<p>"You are not having it to please me, but to spite the
others."</p>

<p>"Maybe you think I can't dance," he said. "I'll show you. I'd
like to dance with you. If there's a dance you can't refuse to
dance with me."</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"I'll dance every dance with you!" he said violently.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said coolly. "A woman reserves some freedom of
choice."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't we have a dance?" he demanded like a wilful
child,</p>

<p>She steadily faced him out. "It is dangerous."</p>

<p>He sneered. "What do you expect to happen?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? I'm no soothsayer. But matters aboard this
ship are clearly coming to a head. Give me another day and I'll
put the truth before you."</p>

<p>"All right," said Horace. "But in the meantime we'll have our
dance."</p>

<p>She shrugged and left him.</p>

<p>So the preparations went on. Adrian excelled at this sort of
thing. He had a boom affixed to the aftermast with long strings
of coloured lights hanging from it, the lower ends being tied to
temporary stanchions around the rail. This made a sort of canopy
of lights over the dance-floor, with the stars peeping between.
The deck was waxed and polished, and palms brought from every
part of the ship were banked in the corners. The after-end of the
winter-garden folded all the way back, making a sort of veranda
café opening on the dance-floor.</p>

<p>Nobody wanted to go to the dance, but nobody dared stay away.
All the women prepared to wear their best. Sophie casually let
fall that she wasn't going to dress until after dinner. This
merely meant that she wanted to show two dresses. A foolish
business, but none of us wanted to be outdone by Sophie. We all
followed suit. Dinner was a nervous meal with squalls of
artificial gaiety. Horace sat silent throughout, drinking a lot
more than was good for him.</p>

<p>At ten we gathered on the boat-deck. There were not enough of
us to make a party go; just five couples and two or three of the
stiff young German officers for stags. They didn't contribute
much. Little Celia's eyes were shining with youth, and Sophie's
with belladonna drops. The latter was wearing a little dancing
dress of yellow net as light as a butterfly's wing, but man! she
was stoutly held in underneath. She could scarcely breathe.</p>

<p>Adrian, chattering in his high-pitched voice, was everywhere
at once. It seemed ridiculous for a man to get so excited over an
affair of this sort, but that was his line. He seemed to look on
this as his big night.</p>

<p>All the bloom was rubbed off Adele on this occasion. Jealousy
and disappointment made her face look mean. She didn't care for
Horace, but it broke her heart to have the other women see that
he had thrown her over. She kept Doctor Tanner close at her side.
His stolid pop-eyes kept glancing uneasily in Horace's direction,
but Horace paid no attention to them whatever.</p>

<p>There was an orchestra on board the yacht, recruited from
amongst the stewards, but they were not very good, and the
fastidious Adrian would not have them. He used the big radio set
and tuned in on a dance programme from Havana; waltzes and
tangoes as only Latin-Americans can play them.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey wore a straight black velvet gown hanging from her
shoulders in points. No touch of colour; no jewels. Perhaps she
intended it as a mute protest; but anyhow, the effect was
magnificent. When she appeared on deck the sight of her roused
Horace from his ill-temper. I heard him murmur:</p>

<p>"By God! you look like the queen of night!"</p>

<p>Martin Coade, standing beside his employer, blinked rapidly,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>Horace claimed Mme. Storey for a dance, and Martin coolly took
possession of me. He held me too close, and I objected; whereupon
he hugged me closer still. I was not going to be overridden by
him, and I stopped short on the floor. He had to stop too, or
drag me around by main strength.</p>

<p>"You will have to dance the way I want or not at all," I
said.</p>

<p>He made a wry face, and started again, holding me out at arm's
length. "Can't you ever forget the typewriter?" he said.</p>

<p>I said nothing. I wasn't going to let him get my goat. He
could dance beautifully when he wanted to. After a while he
said:</p>

<p>"Having a good time?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly," I answered.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It's too much like dancing on a red-hot deck."</p>

<p>"Slippers too tight?"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean."</p>

<p>He held me away from him, and his grey eyes searched me
through. He never smiled. There was something inhuman about his
stare. He was clever, but you couldn't get near him. He
exasperated me, yet I found him attractive in a way; very much of
a man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I watched my employer and her partner when I could.
They made a handsome couple; but things were not going well with
them. Horace's dark face was flushed, and he was devouring his
partner with his eyes. Her face was averted, and from the
peculiar blandness of her expression, I knew she was angry.</p>

<p>Martin, who seemed to be able to read my very thoughts,
murmured: "Like master, like man!"</p>

<p>The only ones who were enjoying themselves were Emil and
Celia, who were dancing in the dark around on the port side of
the winter-garden.</p>

<p>Presently Mme. Storey quietly detached herself from Horace's
arms, leaving him staring. Turning, she held out a hand to
Niederhoff, who was standing at the edge of the floor, saying:
"Dance with me."</p>

<p>The young first-officer's eyes rolled in a terrified fashion
towards Horace, but he could not very well refuse. They danced
away, while Horace glowered after them helplessly. He went to get
a drink.</p>

<p>"That won't improve his temper any," Martin murmured in my
ear.</p>

<p>Somewhat later, I was seated in a deck-chair alongside the
starboard rail watching the dancers. Horace was again dancing
with my employer. She had mastered him, and he had a more subdued
air. Martin was now dancing with Sophie, blinking at her owlishly
and talking a streak.</p>

<p>Forward of the dancing space the brightly lighted winter-
garden stood wide open to the deck. Inside a bar had been set up
for the occasion. Still farther forward on each side the yacht's
boat hung from davits, resting in chocks on deck. My chair was
turned sideways to the rail so it wouldn't interfere with the
dancers, and the boats on the starboard side were therefore in
front of me. But seated under the lights as I was, everything up
forward was hidden in the densest shadow.</p>

<p>It was a perfectly still night. There was a slight heave to
the vessel, just sufficient sometimes to send the dancers sliding
down to one side of the deck, and creating laughter. But quiet as
it was, one never could forget the sea. There it lay alongside
like some monstrous creature quietly breathing.</p>

<p>Horace and Mme. Storey danced over near me. At the moment
there was nobody else on that side of the deck. My employer said
to me laughingly over Horace's shoulder:</p>

<p>"Drag one of those officers out on the floor, Bella. They
stand there like three wooden soldiers."</p>

<p>Just at that moment a running, crouching figure, gun in hand,
materialised out of the darkness up forward. I shouted a warning.
Quick as the figure was, Mme. Storey was quicker. Thrusting
Horace from her with a hard push, she turned to grapple with the
runner. It was Harry Holder with a face like a madman. She thrust
up his right arm, and the gun exploded harmlessly in the air.</p>

<p>From the other side of the deck women screamed. I ran to
Rosika's assistance. Horace stood, dazed by the suddenness of the
attack. Between us, we succeeded in wrenching the gun from
Holder. Mme. Storey thrust it inside her dress. Holder went limp
and trembling in our grasp. Horace came to, and charged at his
assailant with a roar like a bull.</p>

<p>"Hold him back!" shouted Mme. Storey. "The man is
disarmed."</p>

<p>The three ship's officers seized hold of Horace, and dragged
him back. All this took place under the lights. Across the deck I
could see Adrian, white-faced, frozen with terror. He was no good
in a mix-up. Martin was not afraid, but he took no part in the
scene; merely blinked at it.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey and I were supporting the trembling, gasping
Holder between us. "Run him up forward," she whispered.</p>

<p>When Horace divined our intention he roared: "Take your hands
off me, damn you!" His employees were so much in awe of him they
obeyed. Horace ran at us and violently thrusting out his arms,
knocked Mme. Storey and I to the deck. Rage gave him a superhuman
strength. Seizing the trembling Holder by his clothes, he swung
him straight above his head. The man was limp in his grasp.
Running forward to the rail, Horace flung him into the sea. A
long, thin cry broke from Holder. I waited to hear his body
strike the water.</p>

<p>Absolute confusion followed. Mme. Storey was the only one who
kept her head. Scrambling to her feet she snatched a life-buoy
from its hook inside the rail, and tossed it over. She was so
quick it must almost have fallen on top of Holder. It was the
kind that has a flare attached which lights upon contact with the
water. Horace stood there staring at his empty hands like a man
just awakened from sleep. Across the deck the women were
screeching continuously. Adele sank down fainting, but no one
noticed her for the moment.</p>

<p>Once the damage was done the officers acted promptly enough.
Fulda, the second, ran forward to the bridge shouting: "Man
overboard!" Niederhoff put a whistle to his lips and blew
shrilly. "Crew of number two boat on deck!" he shouted. "Quickly,
men!" There was a rush of running feet from below.</p>

<p>The lighted buoy quickly dropped astern. We were unable to
make out if there was anybody clinging to it. When Fulda reached
the wheelhouse, the helm was jammed hard over, and the yacht
began to swing around in a circle, heeling to starboard. The
sailors arrived on deck. They swung the boat out over the sea,
and the crew jumped in, holding the ropes preparatory to lowering
away.</p>

<p>We were all jammed against the rail silently staring at the
bobbing light astern. I felt someone pulling at my arm. It was
Mme. Storey. She pointed at the huddled figure of Adele in her
pretty dancing dress.</p>

<p>"Poor wretch!" she murmured. "It's too big a price to pay for
her foolishness!"</p>

<p>Between us we picked her up and laid her in a deck-chair. I
ran into the deck-house, snatched up the brandy bottle from
behind the bar and brought it back. It seemed almost a shame to
bring her back to consciousness. When the fiery spirit trickled
down her throat she stirred and began to whimper. Presently she
broke into a low continuous weeping very painful to hear.
"Harry!...Harry!...Harry!"</p>

<p>I suppose she loved him in her fashion. We went away and left
her to her remorse. There was nothing that one could say to her
under the circumstances. When we got back to the rail the yacht
was bearing down on the lighted buoy. Fearful of running it down,
they stopped and reversed their engines until the vessel lost all
way. The small boat dropped into the water; the men unhooked the
falls and shipped their oars. There were four sailors in the boat
and Niederhoff steering.</p>

<p>The yacht meanwhile had thrown a searchlight on the buoy and
it was obvious there was nobody clinging to it. The small boat
rowed to the buoy. They drew it out of the water, blew out the
flare, threw it in the bottom of their boat and immediately
turned back to the yacht. We all murmured in surprise.</p>

<p>When they arrived below the spot where we all stood, and
started hooking on to the falls again, the captain shouted down:
"Why didn't you stop and search for him, Mr. Niederhoff?"</p>

<p>And the strange, grim answer came up: "We have him, sir."</p>

<p>Absolute silence fell on our group. Standing in the dark on
the other side of the davits were the rest of the sailors, silent
too. The blocks screeched weirdly as the boat slowly rose towards
us. The searchlight was turned off. As the heads of the boat's
crew rose to a level with ours the captain flashed on a pocket
light. "What do you mean, you have him?" he asked irritably.</p>

<p>Niederhoff stooped down in the bottom of the boat and detached
something from the buoy. The flashlight focused on it brilliantly
in the surrounding dark; a human hand with bent clutching fingers
and part of an arm cut off clean between wrist and elbow.</p>

<p>"The sharks got him, sir. They were following the ship." He
tossed the hand overboard.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, then a shuddering cry from
Sophie: "Ohh!...Ohh!...Ohh!" Her high heels clacked smartly on
the deck as she ran away. Celia ran after her mother, and Adrian,
wringing his hands like a woman, followed them both. That left
five of us standing together; Mme. Storey, Horace, Emil, Martin
and I. Horace very stiff and straight, giving no sign of what he
felt.</p>

<p>The group of men in the dark on the other side of the davits
began to mutter. Men muttering angrily, there is no other sound
on earth like it; it strikes a head. "He attacked me, didn't he?"
he cried angrily. "He tried to murder me!"</p>

<p>From the dark a grim voice answered: "He had been disarmed. I
call it murder!"</p>

<p>"Yes!...Yes!" growled the others.</p>

<p>I had the feeling of tottering on the edge of a dizzy cliff. I
held my breath. The captain spoke sharply. "Silence, men! Go
below!" There was an agonising pause. They decided to obey, and
shuffled forward. We went aft.</p>

<p>The damned radio had been forgotten. It was still crooning a
seductive tango. The sound was too awful. I ran and switched it
off. Horace passed me with his head down. God knows what he was
feeling. Everybody instinctively gave him room. He went to his
own quarters.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE WHIP</h2>

<p class="first">THAT was an uneasy night aboard the
<i>Buccaneer</i>. Early in the morning I was awakened by a heavy
sense of foreboding. I saw by the light through my portholes that
it was just coming full day; in other words, between five and six
o'clock. Something was different from other mornings; something
was wrong.</p>

<p>Suddenly I realised that what I missed was the swish-swish of
the heavy sandstone with which the deck overhead was scoured
every morning. The time-table at sea is as unchangeable as the
passage of the sun. If they were not scouring the decks as usual
at this hour it meant that the whole discipline of the ship was
interrupted.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey appeared in the doorway of my cabin, and I saw by
her grave face that she was disturbed too. She said: "Get up,
Bella, and let's go on deck."</p>

<p>I lost no time in obeying her. When we came out on the
promenade deck it was perfectly empty. We even missed the figure
of the old sailor Jim, who was eternally to be found wiping down
the white painted walls. It was a heavenly morning with an
emerald sea and a sky like palest turquoise except for a diffused
ruby glow in the east which heralded the coming sun.</p>

<p>We started to make a circuit of the deck. Up at the forward
end, when we looked over the rail into the well deck, we
understood why the yacht seemed so deserted. With the exception
of the engine-room staff, the entire ship's company was gathered
on the well deck, all standing so still and quiet they seemed
scarcely to be breathing.</p>

<p>The whole dramatic scene focused in the tall figure of Les
Farman. Les, stripped to the waist, was standing facing the
fo'c's'le bulkhead, thus presented a broad muscular back to the
crowd. His wrists were tied to a ring above his head. On one side
of him stood the captain with three of his officers behind him;
on the other side, Horace armed with an ugly dog-whip of plaited
leather. Sailors, cooks and stewards were ranged along the rail
at both sides, watching with faces like masks having burnt holes
for eyes.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey watched for a moment to learn what the situation
was, before she interfered. The men below were all so intent upon
what was happening that our coming passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>The captain was speaking to Horace in a voice so low that his
words did not reach us. Under any circumstances&mdash;at a dance
or at a flogging&mdash;Captain Grober's face was the same, that
is to say, perfectly expressionless. The three young officers
modelled themselves upon him, but they were not so good at it.
They were unable to hide their uneasiness in the face of that
grim, watching crowd. Horace's face was twisted with rage. He
kept drawing the whip-lash ominously through his fingers.</p>

<p>Angrily interrupting the captain, Horace demanded of Les
Farman: "Did you or did you not call me a murderer last
night?"</p>

<p>We heard Les's voice cool and steady: "I did!"</p>

<p>"What more do you want?" shouted Horace at the captain.
"That's mutiny! I order him flogged."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Nobody moved.</p>

<p>"When a man has to be flogged, whose job is it?" demanded
Horace. "Is it yours?"</p>

<p>"No," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Then order somebody else to do it."</p>

<p>Once more the captain remonstrated with Horace. Something
about times having changed at sea, and sailors being under
protection of the law. We couldn't hear it well. It suddenly came
to me that under his wooden demeanour the man was sweating with
fear.</p>

<p>"Then, by God! I'll do it myself!" cried Horace. And raised
the whip.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's voice sounded crisply: "Stop!"</p>

<p>Every face turned up to her as if they all moved together on
one neck. Hers was the one voice which could have made Horace
pause. He looked at her scowling, and his whip-arm dropped.
Meanwhile she was running down the ladder.</p>

<p>"Get away from here!" growled Horace. "This is no place for a
woman. Get away, I say!"</p>

<p>Ignoring this, she went up close to him. Horace's eyes fairly
blazed at her, and the whip trembled in his hand. She faced him
out. In the end her steady gaze was the stronger. Horace looked
away. I saw her lips shape the words:</p>

<p>"Give me that whip."</p>

<p>He didn't exactly give it to her. But when she took hold of
it, his grasp relaxed. Mme. Storey caught it by the lash and sent
it spinning overboard. A curious murmur escaped from the watching
crew. Their faces showed no change, but you could feel the
tension relaxing. I saw the captain surreptitiously wiping his
face.</p>

<p>Once the whip was disposed of, Mme. Storey's manner changed.
She hung her head as if inviting Horace to hector her. It would
have been impossible for a man like Horace to knuckle down to a
woman with his whole crew looking on. She gave him a chance to
save his face.</p>

<p>"Are you setting up to be my master?" shouted Horace.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she murmured.</p>

<p>"You have me at a disadvantage," he went on bitterly. "You
know very well that I can't talk to you before a crowd of
servants. Come up above!"</p>

<p>This was just what she wanted, of course. She let him march
ahead with a masterful air, while she followed meekly. I don't
think the crew was much deceived. I saw sly grins here and
there.</p>

<p>When they got up on the promenade deck out of sight of the
crew the situation was suddenly reversed. Mme. Storey's eyes were
bright with anger. I have rarely seen her so lifted out of
herself.</p>

<p>"You fool!" she said softly.</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me like that!" said Horace thickly. "I won't
take it!"</p>

<p>They moved on around the corner of the deck-house from me. But
I could still hear every word.</p>

<p>"You'll have to take it," she coolly retorted. "For once in
your life you're going to hear the truth. God knows I'd wash my
hands of the whole business if I could, and let you dig your own
pit. But there are others aboard this vessel to be considered. If
you go on as you are going you will have us all murdered!"</p>

<p>"That's ridiculous!" he said. "They wouldn't dare."</p>

<p>"How do you know what men will dare to do when they're roused?
They will kill you in a rage. Afterwards they will have to kill
us and sink the yacht in order to cover the first crime. If they
turned up in one of the boats with a story of shipwreck, who
could call them to account if we were all at the bottom of the
sea?"</p>

<p>Horace said nothing.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, why did you have to pick on Les Farman?"
she went on. "I told you he was honest. Perhaps the only honest
man in the crew."</p>

<p>"He's an insolent brute," muttered Horace.</p>

<p>"If you were not an overbearing brute you would not meet with
insolence from your employees," she retorted.</p>

<p>And Horace took it.</p>

<p>"Farman holds us in his hand," she went on. "Your captain is a
crook and the other officers are merely his creatures. If we have
to put them in irons, Farman is the only man aboard who can bring
us safe to port."</p>

<p>They moved aft along the deck and I could hear no more.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had a hard fight on her hands because Horace, like
all men of his type, was as stubborn as he was ill-tempered. For
an hour they moved up and down the deck at it in low voices
hammer and tongs. Finally Horace went off to get a drink which he
badly needed, and my employer dropped into a chair beside me,
with a whoof of relief.</p>

<p>"Lord! how it takes it out of you to struggle with hard-
headedness!"</p>

<p>"What was the outcome?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Horace has agreed to meet Les Farman if I can bring them
together without anybody knowing of it. He has promised to offer
his hand to Les and ask him to forget what happened.</p>

<p>"That's a real victory!" I said.</p>

<p>"Half a victory!" she amended ruefully. "I have to see the
other man now and get him smoothed down. And he has real cause to
feel enmity...How men waste our time with their truculence!"</p>

<p>It was after breakfast before an opportunity offered itself of
getting in touch with Farman. We had to proceed with the greatest
caution, because if the crooks aboard suspected that we were
trying to win Les to our side, it would spoil everything.</p>

<p>When we came out on deck, old Jim was at his endless task of
wiping down the white painted walls with his damp rag. We had
often talked with Jim, who could be very entertaining without
forgetting his place. His honesty was transparent and we
instinctively trusted him.</p>

<p>We did not approach him directly, but sat down in two chairs
and waited until his work brought him behind us. "Jim," said Mme.
Storey, "there's a bad situation up forward."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Jim guardedly. "Bad as it can be."</p>

<p>"How does Les Farman stand with the crew?"</p>

<p>"Stands high, mum, though not what you'd call popular, being
as he was formerly an officer like. But he don't lay back on it,
mum. He does his work cheerful, and no shirking. Keeps pretty
much to himself as you might say, but all hands respects
him...Anyhow, they are all for him now," he concluded
significantly.</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Mme. Storey. "Jim, in order to keep the
situation from getting worse, I've got to have a talk with Les
Farman without anybody knowing anything about it."</p>

<p>"That won't be so easy to bring about, 'm," said Jim. "Les
can't come in your part of the vessel, and if you went in his
part everybody would certainly know about it."</p>

<p>"Where is he now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, 'm. But I could go and fetch me a fresh pail of
warm water and sort of look about like."</p>

<p>"Go to it!"</p>

<p>Jim returned in about ten minutes with an innocent inscrutable
look on his gnarled face. He immediately set to work wiping down
the wall behind us, and spoke out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Les was sleeping in his bunk, 'm. Wa'nt nobody else near so I
woke him up and told him what you said. Les said 'Fine business!'
He was just wishing he could talk with you. Said you had the
coolest head aboard the ship."</p>

<p>"This is too much," said Mme. Storey, smiling.</p>

<p>"Les said it would be too risky for you to come to him," Jim
went on. "He said he'd watch his chance and come to you. He can
slip into your corridor by the door from the well deck. He said
shortly after one would be the best time, when all the guests
were up in the dining saloon. Please to leave the door of your
sitting-room unlocked, he said, so he can slip in without waiting
to knock, hoping that it's not too much of a liberty."</p>

<p>"Oh, not in the least!" said Mme. Storey with a twinkle in her
eye.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; PLAYING THE
GAME</h2>

<p class="first">THE <i>Buccaneer</i> was like a funeral ship. A
pall of horror and dread hung over her. It was so difficult to
keep up pretences with each other that the guests remained in
their own cabins for the most part. We went to ours. Our charming
sitting-room was like a haven of refuge where we could relax and
say what we pleased.</p>

<p>In the middle of the morning, while we were there, a tap came
at the door, and upon being told to enter, Emil and Celia ran in.
As soon as the door closed they melted into each other's arms and
kissed, regardless of us.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Please," said Celia, blushing adorably, "can we stay in here
awhile? It's so comfy here."</p>

<p>"Surely!"</p>

<p>The instant permission was given they forgot about us.
Plumping down on a little sofa, they kissed again as frankly and
innocently as Adam and Eve before the fall.</p>

<p>"Why do you come here?" asked Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>There is no place else on the ship where we feel "safe," said
little Celia naively.</p>

<p>"But I say!" said Mme. Storey with mock severity. "I can't
have you using my chaste sitting-room as a rendezvous for your
clandestine love!"</p>

<p>They dropped each other and stared at her in affright.</p>

<p>"This isn't playing the game!"</p>

<p>"But I did what you told me to," said Celia eagerly. "I told
my mother about us."</p>

<p>"And what did she say?"</p>

<p>"She took it beautifully. Much better than I expected. She
said if I was truly in love with Emil she was sure everything
would come right in the end."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Mme. Storey. "Do you mean to tell me that Sophie
threw over her billionaire son-in-law without a word?"</p>

<p>"Not a word!" said Celia. "She said she would never be the one
to stand in the way of her child's true happiness."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mme. Storey dryly. "How do you account for this
sudden change of front?"</p>

<p>"Well, after all, Mother has a good heart."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Mme. Storey even more dryly. She doubted Sophie's
goodness of heart and so did I. "What else did your mother say?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"She said we must be very discreet, and not let a soul guess
that we were fond of each other until she could tell
Horace..."</p>

<p>"You didn't tell her that I knew?" interrupted Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, don't tell her."</p>

<p>"I shan't...She undertook to make things right with Horace,
but she said she would have to wait until she could get him in
the right humour. And, of course, the way things are now it's
impossible to speak to him!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked at me. We know each other's ways so well
that we can express a good deal without speaking. Her look meant:
There is something very funny in Sophie's sudden change of front.
It must be looked into.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Celia, having made what she considered a
satisfactory explanation, flung her arms around young Emil's neck
and kissed him roundly.</p>

<p>"Isn't he sweet?" she said.</p>

<p>"Wa-ait a minute!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>They looked at her in alarm.</p>

<p>"You are still not playing the game," she said, struggling to
keep a straight face. "Horace asked Celia to marry him and she
promised to do so. She is not free to love another man until
Horace releases her."</p>

<p>Emil reluctantly dropped his darling. "That's true," he said,
distractedly running his fingers through his blond hair.
"Whatever shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Mother will make it all right with him," said Celia. "Horace
doesn't care about me really."</p>

<p>"Sure he doesn't," said Emil indignantly. "Not after the way
he's been carrying on first with Adele and now with Mme. Storey
right before your face."</p>

<p>My employer smiled.</p>

<p>"But he's a perfect dog in the manger!" cried Emil. "He'll
never set you free if he suspects that another man wants
you!"</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, I don't see that I owe Horace anything after
the way he has been behaving," said Celia rebelliously.</p>

<p>"Whatever Horace does, you must play the game," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"But I love Emil so!" cried Celia.</p>

<p>The young man flung an arm around her and drew her close. "And
I love you!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Just at that moment there was a knock on the door, and we
heard Horace's voice asking if he could come in. Heavens! what a
situation! Even Mme. Storey changed colour, though she grinned,
too. Celia was terrified out of her wits. Emil was not
frightened, but the set face he turned towards the door was as
white as paper. Mme. Storey pointed silently to the open door of
her bedroom and they slipped in. I closed the door while my
employer was opening the other. This enabled me to hide my face
from Horace until I could compose it. Mme. Storey's face was
bland.</p>

<p>Horace came in with a sullen beaten air. His eyes sought my
employer's face imploringly. "Rosika, I want to talk to you," he
said. "Can't you send Bella out of the room?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?" she said coolly.</p>

<p>"Don't rub it in," he muttered. "Damn it all, a man can't bear
to expose his feelings before a..." He was about to say
"servant," but changed it hastily to secretary.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had no mercy on him. She had discovered that she
had to treat the brute brutally in order to bring him to heel.
"That's the reason I want her to stay," she said. "I don't want
you to 'bare your feelings,' but to put your wits to work to help
us get out of this mess we're in."</p>

<p>He said no more, but dropped gloomily on the little sofa that
the lovers had just vacated. I was terribly uncomfortable.
"Please let me go out," I murmured to my employer.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said indifferently. "You can go into my
bedroom, but come right back when Horace begins to shout at
me."</p>

<p>"Aw, Rosy!" he protested, "I'm not an ogre!"</p>

<p>"You've been giving a good imitation of it," she said.</p>

<p>I went into the bedroom, closing the door after me. I showed
the lovers out into the corridor, and placed a chair beside the
door into the sitting-room. I was determined to hear as much as I
could. I thought my employer would wish it. As a matter of fact,
I heard almost everything that was said, because Mme. Storey took
no care to lower her voice, and Horace was incapable of doing so
when he was excited.</p>

<p>"Have you seen that fellow Farman?" asked Horace.</p>

<p>"Not yet. He's coming here later."</p>

<p>"Coming here?" growled Horace. "A common sailor!"</p>

<p>"We'll never get anywhere if you take that attitude. Bear in
mind that he's a qualified master and superior to all of us while
we're at sea."</p>

<p>"Can I be here when he comes?" Horace asked more humbly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"You'd spoil everything. This man has a right to feel injured,
and I've got to smooth him down before I can bring you
together."</p>

<p>"Well, all right," he growled, "but you don't have to treat me
like dirt. It makes me ugly."</p>

<p>"Ugly?" said Mme. Storey, and I could see her eye-brows
running up. "Never mind that now," she went on as one might speak
to a child, "we have serious matters to talk over...Have you come
to any fresh understanding with Sophie lately?"</p>

<p>There was a silence, then Horace's reluctant voice:</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that?"</p>

<p>"Sophie seems to have been acting very peculiarly."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When Celia expressed a doubt whether she loved you
sufficiently to marry you," Mme. Storey put it thus
diplomatically: "Sophie told her that she would not force her to
marry you."</p>

<p>This brought Horace sharply to attention. "By God!" he cried,
"if that's true...!"</p>

<p>"I assure you that it is quite true. Can you explain her
sudden change of front?"</p>

<p>No answer from Horace.</p>

<p>"What are your financial arrangements with Sophie?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Rosy...!" he began to bluster.</p>

<p>She must simply have looked at him in that way she has. He
quieted down and answered the question.</p>

<p>"I'm not paying Sophie anything if that's what you mean. Oh,
their dressmakers' bills, and little favours of that sort. I
simply agreed to make a will in favour of Celia."</p>

<p>"Yes, you told me that. What are the conditions of this will
to be?"</p>

<p>"No conditions. After making bequests to Adrian, Adele and a
few others, I have left my whole estate unreservedly to Celia,
provided she is my wife at the time of my death, or is still
engaged to marry me."</p>

<p>"<i>Have left?</i>" said Mme. Storey sharply.</p>

<p>"Sure," growled Horace with sullen reluctance, "I made out the
will and signed it a couple of days ago."</p>

<p>It was Mme. Storey's turn to be amazed then.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" she murmured.</p>

<p>There was a long silence in the next room.</p>

<p>"What are you getting at?" Horace demanded ill-temperedly.
"Are you trying to make out that Sophie has murderous designs
against me?"</p>

<p>"Consider what a temptation you have put in her way!" said
Mme. Storey quietly. "All those millions to play
with&mdash;<i>and freedom for the girl!</i>"</p>

<p>Another silence. Horace was growling indistinctly.</p>

<p>"Which one of you suggested the clause about 'still engaged to
me'?" Mme. Storey asked crisply.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Sophie very likely. What of it? It's ridiculous
to suspect her of plotting to murder me. I know Sophie. She's as
crooked as a ram's horn, but hardly murderous."</p>

<p>"How can you tell?" said Mme. Storey. "I have felt
murderous."</p>

<p>"You!" he growled. "God, yes! You could do a murder.
Magnificently. But not Sophie. She's only a cat with claws."</p>

<p>"Maybe the claws are poisoned."</p>

<p>"Nothing to it!"</p>

<p>"What induced you to make a new will just at this time?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sophie was always after me," he grumbled. "First about
Adele, then about you."</p>

<p>"About me!"</p>

<p>"Yes. She was sharp enough to see that I was falling for you
before I realised it myself. She said it was insulting to her and
Celia for me to be making up to other women right in front of
them. So I made the will to shut her up. After all I'm going to
marry the girl eventually."</p>

<p>"Did you have assistance in making it?"</p>

<p>"No, I wrote it myself on the typewriter."</p>

<p>"Who witnessed it?"</p>

<p>"My valet. But I didn't let him know what it was. It will hold
all right until I can consult my attorney."</p>

<p>"Have you told Adrian about your change of mind?"</p>

<p>"No. Why should I?"</p>

<p>"To remove a possible temptation."</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" said Horace with his scornful laugh. "First you
have Sophie plotting to murder me, then Adrian!"</p>

<p>"Just the same I advise it," said Mme. Storey dryly. "...Where
is the new will now?"</p>

<p>"I gave it to Sophie. I have a copy in my pocket. I wanted to
show it to you because I have put down your name."</p>

<p>"My name!" she cried in great surprise.</p>

<p>There was a silence while Horace, I suppose, produced the will
and she read it. Suddenly he said:</p>

<p>"What are you doing? What are you striking out your name
for?"</p>

<p>"I don't choose to be listed with these other ladies," she
said.</p>

<p>"Well, you're down in the original," he growled. "You can't
change that."</p>

<p>"If your executors insist on handing me the money I'll use it
to found a school for spoiled children," she said, and I could
see her smiling. "It's a pet idea of mine...In the meantime, I'll
keep this copy to show them what my sentiments were."</p>

<p>When Horace spoke again his voice was thick with rage. "By
God! no woman has ever spoken to me like that!"</p>

<p>"Then it's time one did," she retorted.</p>

<p>"I'm not just an ordinary man," he cried. "I count for
something in these days. Is it nothing to you that I am crazy
about you, that I..."</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she interrupted with devastating good
humour. "I'm not another Adele nor a Sophie. I am not overwhelmed
by your millions, because I can make all the money I need to
supply my own wants and incidentally keep my freedom."</p>

<p>"By God! you can't treat me like this! I'll show you...!"</p>

<p>"Bella!" she said crisply.</p>

<p>I opened the door and went in. Mme. Storey was seated in an
easy chair beside a porthole. Horace stood over her
threateningly. He gave me a poisonous glance and slammed out into
the corridor. Mme. Storey laughed, but I could not join her. She
lit a cigarette with a steady hand.</p>

<p>"Could you hear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nearly every word."</p>

<p>"Good! Put it down before you forget it. Some day you may be
required to testify to it."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; ABLE SEAMAN</h2>

<p class="first">WE were still in the sitting-room of our suite
when the trumpet sounded on deck for luncheon. Instantly a strong
feeling of excitement took possession of me, and I couldn't keep
my eyes off the door. Mme. Storey smiled provokingly.</p>

<p>"Listening for his footsteps," she murmured.</p>

<p>Time passed and nothing happened. The minutes were like hours.
It was impossible to sit still.</p>

<p>"He isn't coming!" I said.</p>

<p>Almost as I spoke the door opened without a sound. Les Farman
slipped in and closed it behind him. He snatched off his cap, and
stood against the door smiling at us. "Made it!" he said. "I had
to look sharp and get everybody placed."</p>

<p>Blond and blue-eyed as a Viking, his shoulders were so broad
you didn't realise how tall he was until you compared him with
the size of the door. He had the calm smile of the man who is
sure of his own strength. The most attractive thing about him was
that although he only rated as a common seaman, he was not in the
least afraid of us. Mme. Storey made no secret of the pleasure it
gave her just to look at him.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said.</p>

<p>He looked a little surprised.</p>

<p>"Sit down...Captain."</p>

<p>He flushed with pleasure and dropped into a chair as if he was
perfectly accustomed to sitting in the presence of ladies.</p>

<p>"Out on deck discipline must be maintained," she went on, "but
in private there is no reason why we should not act as we feel. I
always think of you as an officer."</p>

<p>He said nothing, but from that moment he was hers.</p>

<p>"We shall have to be brief," she continued, "because Bella and
I have to show ourselves at the lunch table within a few
minutes...This morning, when I sent Jim to try to get in touch
with you, he brought back word that you wanted to see me."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Les.</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>He answered her question by asking another; "Has the boss told
you what port we are going to make next?"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody aboard seems to know."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Les grimly. "He aims to keep us at sea
until he has us cowed...Can you make him call at one of the
islands?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell?...Why?"</p>

<p>"This is what I wanted to say to you," said Les strongly. "Get
ashore off this hell ship! You and the young lady yonder. There
are no strings on you two. You have no call to tie up to Laghet.
Make him fetch port somewhere and go ashore. Don't matter if it's
one of the forgotten islands where steamships never call. Get
ashore!"</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me that," he muttered.</p>

<p>"You mean you don't want to betray your shipmates."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't said I'd go in with them neither."</p>

<p>"Horace Laghet is my client," said Mme. Storey with apparent
irrelevance. "Or, if you like, my employer for the present,
consequently I have to speak of him with a certain discretion.
But you can form your own conclusions."</p>

<p>He grinned in his attractive fashion.</p>

<p>"I get you. You agree with me that he's a first-class you-
know-what, but you can't say it."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Are you willing to tell me what has happened to
you personally aboard this ship?"</p>

<p>"Sure. There's no secret about that...From the day we left New
York I could feel that there was trouble brewing aboard. There's
a kind of crooked ring amongst the men, but I'm outside of it.
Well, I'm not an officer now and it's none of my business. I
closed my eyes and ears to it and just did my job."</p>

<p>"Were you friendly with Holder?"</p>

<p>"No more than with the others. There's a certain element
amongst the men made a kind of pet of Holder...Yesterday when the
boss hustled me on the after deck the news got forward before I
did. They made a kind of hero of me. Not that I give a darn. I'm
just telling you. All slapping me on the back, and telling me
they were with me and so on."</p>

<p>"Then there was last night on the boat deck," he continued.
"You did the right thing in taking Holder's gun. That was
sufficient. They had been feeding him coke, I believe, until he
was crazy. And when Laghet threw him to the sharks I saw red. But
I should have kept my mouth shut."</p>

<p>"And it made you a bigger hero than ever with the men!" she
put in.</p>

<p>"Sure," he muttered. "I'm ashamed of it...I was on watch until
morning. About two bells when it was just beginning to get light,
the boss came on deck and ordered Niederhoff to tie me up. I
could have raised the crew right then, but I didn't. I let him
tie me. Niederhoff was afraid to refuse. The boss ordered all
hands on deck. He was like a crazy man."</p>

<p>"I know what happened after that," said Mme. Storey. "The
captain came and tried to stop him&mdash;or made believe to
try."</p>

<p>Les gave her a shrewd look. "Yeah," he said dryly. "And when I
turned in to sleep at eight bells I found a loaded gun in my
bunk. There was a little piece of paper fastened around it with
elastic. On the paper was printed in pencil: 'Don't hesitate to
use this. We're all behind you.'"</p>

<p>"Have you got that paper?"</p>

<p>"No. Tossed it out the port."</p>

<p>"Have you got the gun?"</p>

<p>"Sure." He coolly produced it from his hip.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey examined it and smiled. "I'd like to keep this for
evidence," she said. "I'll give you a gun of mine in place of
it."</p>

<p>"Don't want it," said Les carelessly. "I can always take care
of myself."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she insisted on getting him an automatic from
the table drawer. "You may need it to defend somebody else," she
said.</p>

<p>Les gave her a steady look and dropped the gun in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey handed me his gun saying: "Mark it 'Gun given up
by Les Farman' and put it with the two I took from Harry Holder."
To Les she said: "Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>"One thing more," he said in his calm way. "When I wake up I
have a little time to myself before dinner. I always spend it
lying in my bunk reading. The book is always lying face down and
open on a little shelf at the foot of my bunk. When I picked it
up there was another pencil message printed on the margin of the
page. It said: 'Stand by the porthole of steward's stores at six-
thirty to-night and listen.'"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Steward's stores is the last door on the right of the
corridor outside," he said pointing. "It was designed for a
stateroom, but it's an undesirable room because the ports open on
the well deck instead of the sea. So the steward has taken it for
his cabin stores; blankets and so on."</p>

<p>"And you're to stand outside that room at six-thirty to
receive some communication."</p>

<p>"Yes. At six-thirty the men will be at their supper."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey flicked the ash off her cigarette. "Well, are you
going to join the crooked ring?" she asked casually.</p>

<p>Farman drew his straight brows together and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Laghet has given the men plenty of cause to hate him," she
went on, "but hardly sufficient cause for them to mutiny. You're
an intelligent man. It must have occurred to you that there is
somebody behind all this; somebody who has it in for Laghet."</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to fall for it?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"You haven't asked me why I sent for you?" she said.</p>

<p>He looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Horace Laghet wishes to offer you his hand and to ask you to
forget what happened this morning."</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, staring. "...You put him up to this!"</p>

<p>She shrugged. "Why go behind the appearance of the thing? He
is willing to do it."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Les. The blue eyes glittered like ice in the sun.
"It's just a hypocritical pretence! I won't fall for it. I know
his kind. In the very act of offering me his hand he'd look at me
in such a way I'd want to smash his face!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smoked without saying anything.</p>

<p>Les stood up. He dwarfed our little sitting-room. He looked
magnificent when he was angry.</p>

<p>"Man and boy I've been at sea for seventeen years!" he cried.
"I've had to put up with all kinds. I can stand a rough brute
because there's some reason for him. But a polished brute, no! A
man who thinks that his foul money gives him the right to wipe
his feet on other men, no!"</p>

<p>He started for the door.</p>

<p>"Don't go!" murmured Mme. Storey seductively.</p>

<p>He turned back, but his anger was still crackling. "I'm not
going to shoot him," he said. "If you doubt it you can have your
gun back. But if anybody else wants to take a crack at him I
won't lift a finger!"</p>

<p>"Then I have failed!" murmured Mme. Storey, making her voice
sound poor.</p>

<p>Like all manly men he was absurdly susceptible to a woman's
plea. He looked at her uneasily.</p>

<p>She stood up and her dark eyes frankly sought his blue ones.
"Will you do it for me?" she said softly.</p>

<p>He stepped back with an almost frightened look.</p>

<p>"Oh!...that's not fair!" he stammered.</p>

<p>"I know it's not fair," she said simply, "but what else can a
woman do? I have taken this job and I have to sink or swim with
Horace Laghet. Frankly, I am afraid of what is before us. I want
you on my side. You're such a man! Will you do it for me
Captain?"</p>

<p>His face softened wonderfully. His eyes dwelt on her in
delight. "Sure!" he murmured in his deep voice. "Reckon I'd grab
the red-hot hoof of Old Hornie if you asked me!"</p>

<p>They laughed together. "Take mine first," she said offering
her hand.</p>

<p>A knock on the door brought us all sharply to attention. "Who
is it?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Jepson, Madam." (Jepson was a dining-saloon steward.) "Mr.
Laghet's compliments, and would you and Miss Brickley like to
have luncheon sent to your rooms?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" sang Mme. Storey. "We'll be up immediately."</p>

<p>To Farman she said: "You stay here until we are out of the
way. There is only one thing to be decided. Where is the
handshaking ceremony to take place? Here?"</p>

<p>Farman was smiling at her a little dizzily. "Too risky to try
to make it a second time," he said. "Could you get the boss to
come down to the swimming pool after lunch?"</p>

<p>"The very thing," she said. "No one ever goes there at that
hour. We'll meet you there at two."</p>

<p>"Make it in the gymnasium forward of the pool," he said. "Miss
Bella can watch the door so we can't be taken by surprise."</p>

<p>We slipped out of the room and hastened up the companionway.
We found a grim luncheon party in the dining saloon, men only.
They looked as if they hadn't spoken to each other since sitting
down. Adrian was as pale as a corpse and wretchedly nervous. He
always appeared to disadvantage in the society of men. The five
of them rose as we entered. Horace looked at us suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Sorry to be late," said Mme. Storey brightly. "The call for
lunch took us by surprise. We were dressing."</p>

<p>It was a pretty thin excuse, as we were wearing the same
dresses we had on when Horace had last seen us. Horace looked at
the dresses but said nothing.</p>

<p>"Thank God anyhow that you've come!" said Martin, blinking
behind his glasses as we took our seats. "It was like a funeral
feast!"</p>

<p>I thought his crack was in very bad taste under the
circumstances, but Martin didn't care. That was his line. Horace
paid no attention.</p>

<p>Our coming didn't help matters much. Martin made his cracks
and we smiled stiffly. Horace was sunk in gloom; Mme. Storey was
studying deeply and the rest of us were jumpy. Naturally, there
was no reference to the tragedy of the night before. Feeling the
way we did, the elaborate meal was a mockery. We refused nearly
everything and got out on deck as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Adrian, Emil and Dr. Tanner slipped away&mdash;to attend on
the ladies, no doubt. Martin was disposed to linger and entertain
us with his wise-cracks. He was the only one excepting Mme.
Storey who was not afraid of Horace. Horace was fond of him and
would let him say what he pleased. Just the same Martin had a
keen sense of which side his bread was buttered on. He never said
the unforgivable thing in Horace's presence.</p>

<p>Out on deck Martin cocked an eye at the sun and took note of
our course, which was almost due east. He voiced the question
that was in all our minds. "Are we heading for Port-of-Spain,
boss?"</p>

<p>"No," said Horace curtly.</p>

<p>"Where away?"</p>

<p>"If I had my way we'd never make port," said Horace bitterly.
"Willemstad was enough!"</p>

<p>And that's all we got.</p>

<p>On the after deck Martin turned his back to us for a moment to
draw up a more comfortable chair. Mme. Storey murmured to
Horace:</p>

<p>"I have a little job for you. Get rid of Martin."</p>

<p>For once Horace was willing to obey her. He didn't want even
Martin to be a witness of his humiliation. He sent his secretary
up on the wireless office with elaborate instructions as to the
sending of a message dealing with some financial operations.</p>

<p>When he was out of sight the three of us descended the
companionway, past A deck which contained all the state cabins, B
deck where the business of the ship was carried on, and where the
servants slept, down to C deck, which was almost on the bottom of
the yacht. The Stairway came to an end at the edge of the
beautiful black marble pool. "How is Farman going to get down
here?" growled Horace.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mme. Storey. "That's up to him."</p>

<p>We made our way forward to the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Alongside us the water of the pool swayed lazily from side to
side in its black basin under the slight roll of the vessel. The
gym. was a smallish room with electric camel, horse, rowing
machine and other apparatus. It was panelled with oak and there
was a door in the forward side. We left the door into the pool
open, and I stood there to watch that nobody came down the
stairway. While they waited in the gymnasium, Horace affecting to
sneer, the little door opened and Les Farman appeared ducking his
head under the lintel. I don't think Horace had noticed the door,
and his eyes bulged at the unexpected apparition.</p>

<p>"What's behind that door?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Steel bulkhead, sir, and water-tight door," answered Les.
"Number one hold is forward of this. They call it the lazaret.
The food is stored there."</p>

<p>"Hm!" said Horace. His expression said: "What the hell are you
doing in the food stores?"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey saw that this scene must be rushed through or
there would certainly be an explosion.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are!" she said in a matter-of-fact way to make
it easy for them. "Shake hands, you two!"</p>

<p>They advanced towards each other like strange dogs. They were
a fine-looking pair of men, Horace as dark as Les was fair. The
difference between them was that Les could control himself and
Horace could not. Horace felt inferior, and it was almost more
than his self-love could bear. His eyes glittered. The man was in
a hell of his own firing.</p>

<p>He took Les' extended hand and dropped it quickly. "Sorry for
what happened this morning," he muttered.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Les.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>She let Horace go first through the door into the pool.
Turning, she said quietly to Les: "You will keep that appointment
outside the steward's stores at six-thirty."</p>

<p>"If you want it." said Les.</p>

<p>"Surely! After you have heard all he has to say, give the man,
whoever he may be, a few minutes to make his getaway, and then
come to my sitting-room and report. It doesn't make any
difference if you are seen coming, because then we must be ready
to strike."</p>

<p>"Okay," said Les, smiling at her.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE SHOW-DOWN</h2>

<p class="first">AT six-thirty that evening, Mme. Storey, Horace
and I were waiting in the sitting-room of our suite in a state of
strained suspense. Horace had been told of the trap we had set.
In the interim the wind had risen and the yacht was pitching
somewhat heavily. What with the excitement and the motion of the
vessel I felt wretched.</p>

<p>Horace was glancing at his watch every few seconds. "If we set
the door open we could see anybody who went down the corridor,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Surely," said Mme. Storey. "And he could see us. In that case
we would hear no details of the plot."</p>

<p>She was moving restlessly about the room. Suddenly she bent
her head to listen by the door.</p>

<p>"Somebody is passing now," she said with a grim smile. "On
tiptoe."</p>

<p>Horace instantly sprang up, but she motioned him back.</p>

<p>We allowed the plotter&mdash;whoever it might be, time enough
to get inside the steward's storeroom, then Mme. Storey gave the
word to go. "Maybe he has only a brief story to tell," she said.
"We must be ready to nab him when he comes out."</p>

<p>We stole softly forward to the end of the corridor. The steel
door leading out on deck was closed. We stood with our backs
against it. While we were in this position, if the person in the
storeroom opened the door a crack to peep out he couldn't see us
because we were behind the door. The door to Dr. Tanner's
quarters was on our right, the storeroom door on our left.</p>

<p>Some minutes passed. Horace was breathing stertorously in my
ear. The suspense was becoming unbearable. The door behind me had
a porthole let into it, and I turned around to look out. I found
when I put my head sideways I could see the edge of Les Farman's
blond head where he stood on deck alongside the next porthole.
The sun had gone down, but it was not dark. From the still poise
of Les' head I judged that he was listening intently. He couldn't
see me.</p>

<p>I whispered the news to Mme. Storey. "So far so good," she
said smiling.</p>

<p>I watched Les until he moved away across the deck. "Les has
gone," I whispered, and our three pairs of eyes fastened on the
door in front of us like cats at a mousehole.</p>

<p>I saw the handle slowly turn and my heart began to pound. The
door opened a crack and was held so&mdash;to give the inmate a
chance to peep down the corridor, I suppose. It was empty. A hand
then appeared around the door, and feeling for the keyhole,
inserted a key. The door opened wider and a man slipped around
it.</p>

<p>It was a steward in his white drill suit, wearing a cap with a
visor. At first I could not see his face. Still watching down the
corridor, he softly closed the door behind him, turned the key
and pulled it out without looking at it. Horace said quietly:</p>

<p>"What the hell are you doing?"</p>

<p>The steward almost jumped out of his skin. I heard his breath
hiss through his teeth. He flung a terrified glance over his
shoulder. It was Fahrig, the captain's servant. He gathered
himself to run, but Horace caught him in two steps, twisted his
hand in the man's collar and shook him like a rat.</p>

<p>"Let me go! Let me go!" he cried thinly.</p>

<p>Horace ran him down the corridor, and thrust him into Mme.
Storey's sitting-room. We followed as quick as we could, and got
the door closed. Apparently no one had heard the slight
commotion. Horace thrust the man from him with a violence that
threw him to the floor. He lay there shaking and crying, wrapping
his arms around his head as if he expected kicks to follow.</p>

<p>"Give an account of yourself!" said Horace.</p>

<p>Fahrig partly raised himself and scrambled to Horace's feet.
There he knelt clasping his hands and mourning. It was a little
too dramatic. I saw by the look of cunning that came into his
mean face that he was getting his grip again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Laghet, I'm innocent!" he whined. "As God sees me
kneeling here I am innocent! I swear it!"</p>

<p>"Innocent of what, for God's sake?" cried Horace.</p>

<p>"I happened to get hold of a key that fitted the lock of the
steward's stores," Fahrig gabbled. "And I was tempted, thinking
of all the goods stored in there. My mother in Germany is so
poor! I went in there to steal, Mr. Laghet, but when I got inside
I thought better of it. I remembered what my mother taught me. I
never took a thing, Mr. Laghet! Search me! Search me!"</p>

<p>A grim note of laughter escaped from Mme. Storey, "That's a
good one!" she said.</p>

<p>"You lie!" said Horace to Fahrig. "You were after bigger game
than soap and towels!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Mr. Laghet," whined Fahrig,
making his eyes big. "I never touched a thing. Search me! Search
me!"</p>

<p>Horace, with a grunt of disgust, raised his foot, but Fahrig
scrambled out of the way with remarkable quickness. "Let me go
this time, Mr. Laghet," he pleaded. "Let me go for my mother's
sake. You will never regret it!"</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door and Les Farman came in. At the
sight of him Fahrig became very quiet. A greenish tinge came into
his sallow skin. Like a rat at bay, his eyes darted this way and
that. I saw them marking the door into my bedroom, and I quietly
put myself in front of it. "Is this the man who talked to you
just now from the storeroom?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Les looked him over. "He's dressed the same," he said, "but I
couldn't swear to it because he kept in the shadow. His cap was
pulled over his eyes and he had a handkerchief tied around the
lower part of his face."</p>

<p>"Well, we caught him coming out of that room," put in Horace.
"That's enough for me."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said Les. "There was a little three-cornered
tear in the corner of the handkerchief where it hung over his
chin. Maybe he still has it on him."</p>

<p>Like a flash Fahrig had the handkerchief out, balled it and
tossed it towards the open port. But I caught it and handed it to
Les. He held it up and showed us the little tear.</p>

<p>"That is the man," he said.</p>

<p>There was no make-believe about Fahrig's terror then. His face
was greenish and damp.</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"One moment," said Les. "This rat is dangerous. Better tie him
up."</p>

<p>At the first move he made towards him, Fahrig whipped out a
knife. That didn't bother Les any. Moving quicker than my eye
could follow, the big man seized his wrist and twisted it so that
the knife fell to the floor. He flung Fahrig down on his face,
knelt on his back and pulled his arms behind him.</p>

<p>"Something to tie him with," he said calmly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey handed him two scarves, one for the man's wrists,
one for his ankles. Fahrig was left writhing on the floor. Les
got up, dusting his hands.</p>

<p>"He started in by telling me I was a fine fellow," he began,
"and how it was a dirty shame the way I had been treated, and
every man on the ship would back me up if I wanted to get square.
He started to abuse the boss&mdash;well, I needn't go into that.
I agreed with everything he said. When he cussed, I cussed, and
we were soon good friends."</p>

<p>"He's lying!" whined Fahrig from the floor. "This is an
attempt to railroad an innocent man!"</p>

<p>Nobody paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>"He said," Les continued, "that if the boss kept on the way he
was going there would be a mutiny on this ship, and not only the
boss but all the guests would be murdered, and I said that was
right. He said it would be a good act to stop the boss in order
to save those innocent lives, and I agreed. He asked me if I was
man enough to do it, and I said 'Sure, if I thought I could get
away with it.' He said that would be easy.</p>

<p>"So he began to dope it all out. He knew that I was on watch
from four until eight, and that I was stationed as lookout in the
bows. He asked me if I could steal away from my post for a little
while. I said 'Sure, it was only an empty form to keep watch in
the bows on a clear night, but I had to be there to strike the
ship's bell every half-hour when I heard the bell on the
bridge.'</p>

<p>"So he told me to wait until one bell, that is four-thirty,
when the other watch would have turned in, and the ship would be
quiet. I was then to steal back through the corridor to the
boss's suite on A deck aft. The corridor door is locked at night,
but he had a key for me. I asked him how about the watchman
amidships, and he said after the passengers turned in, the
watchman sat in the forward companionway outside the dining-
saloon and took a good sleep.</p>

<p>"He said there was a special lock on the door of the boss's
suite, but he had a key for that, too. He told me the boss was
drinking hard. Nobody was on to it because he carried it so well.
He stayed up every night as long as he could get anybody to stay
with him, but he had to go to bed sometime, and when he turned in
he slept like he was drugged. He said he had that straight from
the boss's valet."</p>

<p>Horace's face was a study as he listened to this story. Les
told it in a perfectly dry voice, so that Horace had no excuse to
take offence.</p>

<p>"I said 'How about this valet?'" Les went on, "'Where does he
sleep?' He said the valet slept in a little cabin just outside
the door of the owner's suite. I said he had a key to the suite,
I reckoned, and if he heard anything why couldn't he follow me in
there? And this fellow said sure he has a key, but you can lock
him in as you go by. The valet never locks his door, but its got
a lock on it and I have the key. Suppose he did hear something,
before he could bust out you could make your getaway two or three
times over.</p>

<p>"I asked him about this getaway, and he said after I put a
bullet through the boss's head&mdash;he recommended me to put a
pillow over the gun to muffle the report&mdash;I could climb out
of a little window in the bathroom of the suite which opens on
the open deck astern where the steering gear is. The boss was
most particular to keep that window locked, he said, but I could
always open it from the inside.</p>

<p>"Once outside I could drop the pistol overboard and there
would be nothing in the world to connect me with the deed. From
that little deck astern there is a ladder up to the promenade-
deck, and another down to B deck, and I could return either way.
But I better make my way back through B deck, he said, in order
to avoid the watchman on the promenade.</p>

<p>"That's all," Les continued, "only he said there was somebody
aboard the ship who was so scared the way things were going that
he was willing to put up a thousand dollars to have Horace
removed. And if I did my job, he said, I could come back to-
morrow night, same time, same place, and he'd pass me a grand.
And I said,'Well, I was a poor man and I couldn't refuse
it.'"</p>

<p>Horace, with a black face, took a step towards the bound
figure on the floor. "Who hired you?" he demanded with an
oath.</p>

<p>"Nobody hired me!" cried Fahrig. "It's all lies! All
lies!"</p>

<p>"I'll find a way to make you tell!" said Horace, showing his
teeth.</p>

<p>The man was livid with terror, but his eyes fixed themselves
on Horace's in a kind of insane resolution. "You'll never make me
tell," he said. "If you was to kill me I would say the same. It's
all lies!"</p>

<p>"We'll see," said Horace.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey moved swiftly between him and Fahrig. "No
torture!" she said.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Horace with an ugly scowl.</p>

<p>"Because I won't stand for it," she coolly answered. Horace
glared at her, but she steadily faced him out. He turned away his
head. "Besides, it's not necessary," she said in a milder voice.
"I know who hired him."</p>

<p>The four of us went into a huddle in the corner of the room as
far as possible from Fahrig.</p>

<p>"You mean the captain," said Horace. "But what proof have we
beyond the fact that Fahrig is his servant?"</p>

<p>"I have the proof&mdash;now," she said. "The two guns that I
took from Holder and the gun that Farman handed me this morning
were all of the same make; moreover, they bore consecutive serial
numbers. Obvious that they came from the same source. I
wirelessed my attorney in New York to find out from the makers to
whom these guns had been sold. I had his answer awhile
ago..."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" demanded Horace excitedly.</p>

<p>"Guns bearing those serial numbers were part of the equipment
of arms furnished to the yacht <i>Buccaneer</i>. Well, as you
know, the arms are kept in a locker adjoining the chartroom.
There are two keys to it; the captain has one and the first
officer the other."</p>

<p>Horace accepted it with a gloomy stare. He was badly shaken.
"What must we do?" he said blankly.</p>

<p>"Obviously, we must seize the ship and put the captain and his
officers in irons."</p>

<p>"We'd be helpless!" murmured Horace.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned to Les. "Will you undertake to steer us
into port, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Les, carelessly confident.</p>

<p>Horace scowled at him. His feelings were badly mixed. He hated
Les, but now he was dependant on him. "But if the men are
mutinous?" he growled.</p>

<p>"The men can be divided into two classes," said Les. "The
majority of them are honest enough fellows whose minds have been
poisoned against you by ceaseless underground propaganda. I can
bring them back all right by telling them the truth. There is
also a crooked ring, but if the officers are put under guard they
will keep very quiet. They wouldn't dare act on their own."</p>

<p>"All right," growled Horace, "you shall be captain."</p>

<p>"We must act instantly," said Mme. Storey, "before a whisper
of what has happened gets around the ship."</p>

<p>"But there are only four of us," objected Horace.</p>

<p>"Two men, two women."</p>

<p>"Women are better than they used to be," said Mme. Storey,
smiling. "Who else can we trust?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's Martin, anyhow. We must get hold of
Martin."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said nothing to that. From a drawer she got out
three guns that had originally come from the yacht's arsenal. She
gave one to Horace, one to me, and kept the third. Les was
already armed. She tied one of the little capes around her neck
that were fashionable at the moment, and held the gun under her
left arm where it was completely hidden. I had no cape, but I
hung a steamer rug over my gun hand. I had only to drop the rug
in order to bring the gun into play.</p>

<p>When we started for the door, Fahrig let out a kind of
screech. It wasn't very loud, because his voice failed him.
Instantly Les dropped beside him and struck him a blow on the
temple that put him out cold.</p>

<p>"It's a shame to do it," Les said with a sheepish grin, "but
he was trying to raise the ship."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he's done it, too," murmured Mme. Storey,
listening inside the door. Meanwhile Les was gagging Fahrig with
a handkerchief.</p>

<p>There was a scurry of feet outside, an agitated knocking, and
Sophie's voice asking: "Rosika, are you there? Did you hear that?
Oh, what was it?" Sophie's suite was on the port side opposite
ours.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey whispered to us: "We can't hide it. We must lie
out of it." She threw open the door.</p>

<p>Sophie stood there in peignoir and slippers, her hair all
anyhow and cold cream plastered on her face; a ghastly sight. Her
eyes widened like saucers when she saw the man on the floor.</p>

<p>"A thief," said Mme. Storey. We caught him red-handed and he
put up a fight. But it's all over now.</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" gasped Sophie.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, my dear. Only foggy."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Sophie pressing nearer.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey stood in front of her as if to shield her from the
men. "My dear, you're a sight!" she murmured. Sophie, suddenly
recalled to herself, gave a little cry and scampered back to her
own quarters. Les chuckled out loud. Mme. Storey was both smiling
and serious.</p>

<p>"Come on," she said. "We must act instantly. Sophie might use
the telephone. There's no time to look for Martin now."</p>

<p>"Is it safe to leave this fellow here?" growled Horace.</p>

<p>"He's safe for half an hour or so," said Les cheerfully. "I'll
take care of him later."</p>

<p>We went out, locking the door behind us. The bedroom doors
were already locked.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; BLOODLESS
MUTINY</h2>

<p class="first">THE four of us started up the forward
companionway. Horace hung back on the landing.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" he growled. "We must have a
plan."</p>

<p>"It is very simple," said Mme. Storey. "First we seize the
captain and secure him. Second we secure the officer on watch.
Third we secure the other two officers wherever we find them. If
we can take them one by one there need be no fuss at all."</p>

<p>We proceeded. At the head of the stairs in the dining-saloon
forward two stewards were arranging the table. We dined at eight
on the <i>Buccaneer</i>. We turned aft through the library which
was no more than a corridor really, leading past the engine
trunk. The music-room followed, then the after companionway with
the big lounge on the other side. All this part of the ship was
empty.</p>

<p>But from the companionway we could hear a murmur of voices in
the winter-garden overhead. After listening for a moment or two,
Mme. Storey said: "Captain Grober, Adrian and Dr. Tanner."</p>

<p>"It will look odd to them if I am with you," said Les.</p>

<p>"It's all right if I bring you," muttered Horace.</p>

<p>Les had a mind of his own in such matters. Always smiling, he
said: "I'll go up by the deck. I'll be right outside if you want
me."</p>

<p>"We must have something with which to bind our prisoners,"
said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"The irons are kept in the arms locker off the chart-room,"
said Les.</p>

<p>She looked into the lounge. The window curtains were caught
back with heavy silk cords. Les, following the direction of her
glance, ran in, and making a hasty round of the windows, unhooked
the cords and stuffed them in his pockets.</p>

<p>He ran out on deck, and the rest of us started up the
stairway. Mme. Storey murmured to Horace.</p>

<p>"Bella and I will take the captain out on deck. You had better
remain behind to watch the other two. I don't know where Tanner
stands."</p>

<p>"And Adrian?" he said truculently.</p>

<p>"You know what I think about Adrian...If you hear nothing
outside, you will know that it is all right and you can follow us
to the bridge."</p>

<p>The companionway ended in a little lobby adjoining the winter-
garden. This charming room with its growing plants and wicker
furniture had the effect of a pavilion up on the boat deck. It
was a fair warm night, though the sea was somewhat rough, and the
after end of the room was wide open to the deck. The three men
were seated in a row looking out through the opening. Thus we
came on them from behind.</p>

<p>Hearing us, they rose like three automatons, each with his
drink in his hand; Captain Grober, blond, correct and wooden; Dr.
Tanner with his stupid pop eyes and dinky moustache; and Adrian,
so tall and handsome&mdash;and so soft! I advanced towards them,
gripping my gun under the rug, and steeling myself not to
tremble.</p>

<p>Horace was glum, but he always was, so that didn't matter.
Mme. Storey hailed the three gaily. "How inviting it looks out on
deck," she said. "Captain Grober, are you for ten minutes' walk
before I have to go and dress?"</p>

<p>She had not heretofore singled him out, and perhaps he was
surprised, but anyhow, he clicked his heels together and bowed
from the waist. "Delighted, Madam!"</p>

<p>He tossed off the rest of his drink, and they passed out
through the opening with me following meekly. When the captain
saw that I was coming too, he said: "Allow me to carry the rug,
Miss."</p>

<p>The Lord knows what he thought I was going to do with it! I
drew back hastily. "Oh, it's no trouble!" I said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mme. Storey was saying: "Where's the Southern Cross,
Captain?"</p>

<p>"Not up yet, Madam. Do you know the Southern Cross is always a
disappointment to Northerners. One hears about it all one's life,
and then, after all, it's no brighter than our own stars!" etc.,
etc. The German was a little dazed by her flow of language.</p>

<p>She led the way forward. Once we had passed the lighted
windows of the winter-garden it was dark on deck, but not
absolutely. When we had covered about half the distance to the
bridge she stopped, and the gun appeared from under her arm. I
dropped the rug and pointed my gun.</p>

<p>"Put up your hands!" she said crisply.</p>

<p>There was light enough to show the guns, and he obeyed very
quickly. "What! What! What!" he spluttered in very broken
English. "Is this what you call a choke, madam?"</p>

<p>"Just as you like. I'm staging a mutiny by order of the
owner...Les!" he said softly.</p>

<p>As if by magic the big fellow appeared out of the dark. There
was another behind him. "Picked up Jim," he muttered. Grober was
forced to put his hands behind him and Jim tied him up,
afterwards frisked him, taking his guns and his keys.</p>

<p>"You shall pay for this!" Grober threatened. "At sea I am the
master. It is the law!"</p>

<p>"You'll have a chance to tell the judge," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>Horace joined us. "Outrage! Outrage!" Grober was
muttering.</p>

<p>"Ahh! shut up!" said Horace harshly. "Fahrig is caught, and
we've got the goods on you!"</p>

<p>Grober's head sunk between his shoulders. He said no more.</p>

<p>In order to reach his quarters we had to lead him almost to
the bridge. It was a ticklish situation, because at this hour the
majority of the crew would be loafing on the fo'c'sle head
immediately below. If the crew was roused before we got their
officers under lock and key, God only knew what would happen.</p>

<p>Horace was sent on ahead to engage the attention of the
officer on watch. The bridge was on the same level as the boat
deck, and we could see the solitary shadow outlined against the
sky. When Horace reached him we started forward, Jim was told to
keep out of sight until he could count a hundred and then follow
us. I picked up the rug and hung it over my gun again.</p>

<p>As we drew near the bridge the officer turned around and
looked at us. Of course, all he could see was a group of dim
figures in the dark. Les whispered to Grober: "If you let a sound
out of you I'll crack you over the head with my gun!" Grober was
dumb. We all breathed more freely when we got him inside the door
leading to the officers' quarters.</p>

<p>This was a short passage with two rooms on either side. At the
forward end there was a door leading into the chartroom. Beyond
the chartroom was the wheelhouse. Les opened the door of the
captain's room, thrust Grober down on his bunk, gagged him and
tied his ankles together.</p>

<p>We were as quiet as we could be, but there were bound to be
some suspicious sounds. As we came out of the captain's room, the
door opposite opened and there stood Niederhoff with an
astonished face. When he saw Les he knew he was in for trouble.
He turned back. There was a gun lying on his desk.</p>

<p>Pushing me violently aside, Les sprang upon Niederhoff's back
as he reached for the gun and bore him down on the bed. Mme.
Storey secured the gun. A choked cry escaped from Niederhoff, and
Les clapped a big hand over his mouth. It was obvious that Les
couldn't tie him up like this, and I saw what I had to do. I sat
on Neiderhoff's head pressing his face into the pillows until Les
had made his wrists and ankles fast. Les then gagged him and we
let him breathe again. His face was growing blue.</p>

<p>There were no keys in the doors and we couldn't stop to search
for them.</p>

<p>We proceeded forward into the chartroom. By this time old Jim
had joined us. The chartroom was empty. The chart was pinned to a
big drawing-board under a light, and on the other side of the
room was the arms-locker. The door into the wheelhouse was always
kept closed at night, as any light would interfere with the
vision of the helmsman. Les signed to us to go into the
wheelhouse and keep the watch occupied while he and Jim got out
the irons we wanted.</p>

<p>An air of mystery hangs over the wheelhouse at night. It is
dark and still; orders are given in quiet voices. However the
passengers may strut below, this is the real soul of the ship.
There was a young sailor at the wheel, his face faintly
illuminated by reflected light from the binnacle, and beyond him
Bostock, the third officer, was standing.</p>

<p>"Mme. Storey!" he exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>Naturally we had no business to be prowling around that part
of the ship after nightfall.</p>

<p>"Just exploring!" said Mme. Storey in the silly manner she
adopts when she wants to cover her tracks. "You have such cunning
little rooms up here on the roof of the ship. Much nicer than
ours!"</p>

<p>Bostock said nothing. We could hear his heels click together
as he bowed. He was a mere lad, but just as wooden as the others.
Perhaps with his own people he was a kind and likeable lad, but
he felt himself a stranger amongst us and he hated us.</p>

<p>"What a darling little wheel!" she cried. "Do you mean to say
that little wheel can steer this big ship?"</p>

<p>"The wheel merely transmits the impulse to the steering
machinery," answered Bostock in his formal German fashion.</p>

<p>"Fancy that!"</p>

<p>There were doors right and left leading out on the bridge.
Through the right-hand door we could see Horace and the other
officer talking together. The door from the chartroom opened and
Les entered followed by Jim. "Farman!" said Bostock sharply.
"What are you doing in there?"</p>

<p>By way of answer, Les presented a gun at his head. "Turn your
back to me," he said crisply. "Put your hands behind you. If you
make a sound I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>The lad hesitated. He looked around. By that time Mme. Storey
and I were covering the helmsman Bostock submitted. He turned
around and his chin dropped on his chest. At a nod from Les, Jim
came forward and clicked the irons on his wrists.</p>

<p>"Take the wheel, Jim," ordered Les. "The course is sou' by
east."</p>

<p>"I'm on your side," said the other sailor tremulously.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Les dryly. "Stick your hands behind you!" Click!
went the irons. "If you're on the square with me I'll soon
release you," added Les.</p>

<p>He forced his two captives to lie down on the floor, and put
the irons on their ankles. The irons were like wide bracelets,
much heavier than police handcuffs. There had been no sound in
the wheelhouse except the clinking of the chains that fastened
them together. It was impossible to avoid this.</p>

<p>The unusual sound, slight though it was, suddenly brought the
remaining officer, Fulda, in from the bridge on the run. He had a
flashlight, and one glance inside the wheelhouse was enough for
him. He turned back through the door shouting:</p>

<p>"Mutiny! Mutiny! Help, men!"</p>

<p>That was as much as he could get out before Horace leaped on
him, bearing him to the floor with a crash inside the door. From
the well-deck arose an ugly mutter that quickly swelled to a
bellow of rage. Above all the others we heard a voice
shouting:</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows!"</p>

<p>Les flung two pairs of irons on the floor, and crying "Secure
that man!" ran out through the door.</p>

<p>Swinging himself over the rail of the bridge, he slid out:
down a stanchion to the promenade-deck, and gained the top of the
ladder before the men could swarm up from the well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Horace, shouting to us to take care of Fulda,
followed Les. He ran down the stairs, and it took him longer.
Mme. Storey and I flung ourselves on the second officer. He was a
powerful brute, and we could not hold him down and handcuff him
too. Jim had to come to our aid. The yacht swung off and began to
roll in the trough of the sea.</p>

<p>We secured Fulda and ran out, leaving our prisoners writhing
on the floor. The Germans did not curse as our men would. Les'
voice shouted from below: "Mind your helm!" and Jim grabbed the
wheel again. Mme. Storey and I hustled down the stairs to the
promenade. The yelling from below had died down for a moment,
then broke out again, hideously.</p>

<p>What had happened during those few moments was this: Les,
blocking the head of the ladder, and letting his voice roar out,
cried:</p>

<p>"It's all over but the shouting, boys! The Captain and the
three officers are prisoners, and I'm the master of this
ship!"</p>

<p>They heard it and fell silent. It was the silence of
stupefaction. Quickly following up his advantage, Les said:</p>

<p>"I can't take this ship into port without a crew. You know me,
boys. Will you stand by me? I promise you that as soon as we
touch port there shall be a full investigation of all the
troubles on board!"</p>

<p>"Where's the owner?" demanded a voice.</p>

<p>At this moment Horace reached Les' side. Whatever his faults,
Horace did not lack physical courage.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want of me?" he asked defiantly. He had his
gun in his hand.</p>

<p>"For God's sake put up your gun or you'll have us all thrown
to the sharks!" muttered Les.</p>

<p>Horace concealed the gun just a moment too late. There was a
flood-light on the well-deck used when heavy supplies or baggage
was brought aboard at night.</p>

<p>Somebody turned it on and cast it on the group at the head of
the ladder. It caught the gun and a hellish chorus of cries broke
out:</p>

<p>"Yah! Murderer! Murderer!...What you put the Captain in irons
for? Because he wouldn't let you flog a man?...Yah! Les! you
turncoat! Want to kiss the hand that flogs you!...What you
getting out of this?...Put the owner in irons and we'll work the
ship!...Put the murderer in irons!"</p>

<p>This was going on when Mme. Storey and I struck the promenade-
deck. Before showing herself at the forward rail she called
Horace back to her. He came with a hard, white face.</p>

<p>"For God's sake leave the deck!" he said. "This is no place
for women!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" she said peremptorily. "Go inside! It is the sight
of you which infuriates them. I am in no danger!"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of them!" he growled.</p>

<p>"Well, I am!" she said, with bright eyes. "Go away from here
or you will be the death of all of us!"</p>

<p>He sullenly gave in. "Take my gun," he muttered. Her hands
were empty at the moment.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Worse than useless to me!" She went
forward and Horace faded out of the picture; I don't know where
he went.</p>

<p>Les was standing in a strong light at the head of the ladder,
looking down at the yelling mob with a composed face. His empty
hands were in plain view. To a certain extent his quiet eye
intimidated them, but they were gradually edging towards the foot
of the ladder; sailors, stewards and oilers, all mixed together.
Mme. Storey showed herself beside him, and the crowd fell quiet.
They didn't know how to take her. She was on Horace's side, but
they couldn't forget that it was she who had stopped the
flogging. She said:</p>

<p>"Will you let me talk to you, sailors?"</p>

<p>There were confused cries of "Yes!...No!..." and a bull-like
voice roaring: "What have you got to say?"</p>

<p>She smiled. It was neither forced nor contemptuous. Danger
made her eyes bright. "Only want to tell you why we tied up the
Captain. Before you run wild you had better find out what's
stinging you!"</p>

<p>There was some laughter. Also a voice shouting "She's only
stalling, sailors!"</p>

<p>"Most of you are American boys," she went on quickly, "You
can't scare me because you're my own kind. And I'm going to say
my say!"</p>

<p>She suddenly started down the ladder. I gasped. Les made to
follow her, but she turned, murmuring: "Go back! I am safer
alone!" He obeyed, but I heard him groan with anxiety.</p>

<p>When she reached the lower deck the men backed away in front
of her. "What are you afraid of?" she asked, smiling. She stood
with her back against the foremast. "Come on up!" Nobody moved.
"Any of you boys got a Lucky?"</p>

<p>Several men started forward extending their packets of
cigarettes. Mme. Storey accepted a smoke from one and a light
from another. "I can talk better when I've got something in my
hand," she said, blowing a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>They began to move up. One came forward with a stool for her
to sit on. "Thanks," she said, "I'll stand on it. I want to see
you all."</p>

<p>Somebody slyly turned the flood-light so that it shone in her
face. Mme. Storey made a bow in the direction of the light.
"Thanks, electrician!" There was a general laugh, and I released
my pent-up breath. She was getting them!</p>

<p>"I don't know if you know it," she said, "but I'm a sort of
criminologist or investigator&mdash;if anybody calls me detective
I'll fight! Two weeks before we started from New York, Horace
Laghet was warned over the telephone that if he took this voyage
he would never come back alive. He laughed at the first warning.
The day before we sailed he was warned again, and then he sent
for me and asked me to come along and find out if there was a
plot aboard his yacht to get him."</p>

<p>They listened to her in complete silence now. While she was
speaking the guests gathered along the forward rail of the
promenade. There was Emil and Celia pressed close together and
looking down with the serene fearlessness of youth; there was
Adele listening with a pinched and hateful face, half-supported
by Dr. Tanner, whose face was a blank; there was Sophie in one Of
her girlish evening-dresses, running back and forth, torn between
curiosity and terror, wasting her breath in vain whispered
appeals to Celia to come away.</p>

<p>The last to arrive were Adrian and Martin in sleek evening-
dress; Adrian seemed to be half out of his wits with terror; his
mouth worked and his eyes rolled like an idiot's; he listened as
if in pain. Martin, on the other hand, looked down at the scene,
merely blinking. A little behind the group, Horace came into
view, listening with bent head. I didn't envy him his
thoughts.</p>

<p>"You all know about the attack that Johnson made on the owner
last night. Somebody said the poor devil was doped, and I don't
doubt it. Who doped him? What you do not know is, that I had
previously taken a gun from Johnson and had shipped him back to
New York on the <i>Orizaba</i>. But he escaped and came back
aboard the yacht. That's the reason he had to be hidden from the
boss and from me.</p>

<p>"Well, poor Johnson is gone. After the events of last night
and this morning the plotters believed that they had another tool
ripe for their purpose in Les Farman. And Les found a gun tucked
in his bunk to-day. An hour ago, somebody hidden in stewards'
stores yonder and speaking to Les through the porthole, offered
him a grand to shoot Horace Laghet in his bed to-night. The whole
approach and the getaway had been carefully planned out.</p>

<p>"We caught Fahrig, the Captain's steward, coming out of
stewards' stores. We had other evidence too. The three guns, that
is to say, the two I took from Johnson, and the one handed to me
by Farman, all came out of the arms locker aboard this yacht. And
the only two keys to the locker are in the possession of the
Captain and the first officer. When we discovered that we decided
to put the officers under lock and key and make for port. Do you
blame us?"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of assent. A voice cred: "Where's your
proof?"</p>

<p>"You'll have to wait for proof until the officers are brought
to trial."</p>

<p>"Will the owner be brought to trial for murder?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Mme. Storey coolly. "Once we drop anchor
everything will have to come out."</p>

<p>"Do you accuse us of being in this plot?" growled a deep
voice.</p>

<p>"The majority of you are honest men," said Mme. Storey, "or I
wouldn't be talking to you like this. But there's a crooked ring
in the fo'c'sle. Let the honest men think back over everything
that has happened since we left New York, and decide for
themselves."</p>

<p>The men began to discuss the matter amongst themselves in loud
voices, I judged that the current was running in our favour. But
there was one opposing voice somewhere in the back of the crowd;
a young voice, saying: "Aah! you fools! Can't you see she's just
talking you round? She knows how to work men!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's keen ear recognised that voice. "Ha!" she cried.
"There's my old friend Kid Wanzer! Bring him into the light,
boys!"</p>

<p>Wanzer had not bargained for this. He made a break for the
fo'c'sle but was collared and dragged back, struggling. All his
courage ran out of him. He was brought to Mme. Storey's feet
shaking and cringing.</p>

<p>"There's one of your crooks," she said grimly. "He betrayed
Bella and I into the hands of a Chinese gang in Willemstad.
Luckily we escaped."</p>

<p>"She lies!" yelled Wanzer. But his own terrified voice
convicted him. "Ah, you dirty scum!" cried one of the men who was
holding him, striking him on the side of the head. Wanzer was in
a fair way of being badly mauled when Mme. Storey called up to
Les for a pair of irons. He tossed them to her.</p>

<p>"Snap these on him," she said, "and turn him over to the
skipper."</p>

<p>Wanzer's hands were locked behind him. They ran him up the
ladder, pummelling him as they went. He collapsed in a corner of
the deck above.</p>

<p>The crew promptly forgot him. A dozen questions were asked of
Mme. Storey at once. "One at a time!" she protested, waving her
hands. Every question she could hear she answered instantly and
truthfully.</p>

<p>I noticed that McLaren, the burly chief engineer, had joined
the group of passengers. I was pretty sure that the Scotsman bore
no love towards the Germans on the bridge and that he would be on
our side. However, he was uncertain as to how the crew would take
any interference from him, and he said nothing, but merely
watched the scene below with a grim face.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door from A deck corridor banged open, and two
dishevelled figures ran out into the space in front of Mme.
Storey's stool. It was Grober and Niederhoff. At sight of them
Les pulled his gun and took a step down. But he immediately saw
that the two officers were not armed. Putting up his gun, he
stayed where he was.</p>

<p>Grober shook both fists in the air. Such was his rage he could
scarcely articulate. "We were seized and tied up without
warning," he cried, "and thrown in our rooms! Fulda, Bostock and
the helmsman are lying helpless in the wheelhouse now. They are
in irons and I could not release them! Men, it is a plot to save
the owner from a charge of murder. This woman, for a price, means
to fasten the crime on us! on us!" He beat his breast like a
gorilla.</p>

<p>The men fell silent. It was impossible to tell how they would
react to this preposterous charge. Mme. Storey did not make the
mistake of arguing with Grober. She appealed to the crew. "Well,
you've heard his story now," she said coolly. "It's up to you to
choose who you'll have to take us into port. There's Les Farman,
the American, and here's Hans Grober, the foreigner."</p>

<p>They all shouted at once, some for Farman, some for Grober.
The cries for Farman were more numerous.</p>

<p>"This calls for a show of hands," she said. "All who want
Farman hold up their hands." A number of hands shot up. "Grober?"
The crooks amongst the crew saw which way the current was
tending, and declined to advertise themselves. Not a hand was
raised.</p>

<p>"Well, Captain," said Mme. Storey, "you appear to have lost
out!"</p>

<p>"Outrage!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"One moment," said Les, from the top of the ladder. "There
can't be two skippers on a ship. I refuse to take the
responsibility unless those two are locked up."</p>

<p>"Fair enough!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Lock them up!" yelled the crew, starting forward. I suppose
they were delighted at the idea of getting their hands on their
former masters. However, Mme. Storey jumped down from her stool
and, spreading her arms wide, held up the rush for a moment.
Under cover of her skirts the two officers ran pell-mell for the
ladder and scrabbled up on all fours, Fulda treading on Grober's
heels. Les received them at the top and led them, with Wanzer,
meekly into captivity. The anger of the crew evaporated in a roar
of laughter at this undignified exit.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that!" said Mme. Storey, with a decisive
gesture. "See you later, sailors." They cheered her as she ran up
the ladder.</p>

<p>The guests crowded around her admiringly&mdash;except the
jealous Adele and her cavalier, who looked on with sneers. Above
all the fulsome voices could be heard Sophie's shrill cackle:
"Darling! you were marvellous!...marvellous!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked them over grimly. "We haven't yet got solid
ground under us," she said. "You'd better keep your
congratulations for a while."</p>

<p>Beckoning to Horace and to me, she hastened along the deck
after Les Farman. Horace was scowling at her in sullen pain.
Bluebeard had met his match. Mme. Storey was not thinking about
him. When she put the crowd behind her her face showed white and
strained. It had not been so easy at it looked.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; DINNER AT
NINE</h2>

<p class="first">IT was decided to confine our five prisoners in
Horace's den up on the boat-deck. This room had but the one door,
a heavy teak affair, opening on the starboard side in plain view
of the bridge. Thus it would be under the observation at all
hours of whoever was on watch. It had three windows which screwed
shut in heavy weather. By removing the brass handles and
substituting common nuts, the windows could not be opened except
with the aid of a wrench.</p>

<p>Some of the furniture was taken out to make room, and
mattresses laid on the floor. Irons were left on the legs of the
prisoners, but removed from their wrists, so that they could feed
themselves or read or smoke. Captain Grober protested angrily
against being locked up with a steward and a common sailor, but
Les merely grinned. "You'll fare worse ashore," he said.</p>

<p>The helmsman, a man called Roberts, was set free, since there
was nothing against him. The whole ship was rotten with enemies
and spies. We could only deal with that problem by maintaining a
superior morale.</p>

<p>While the prisoners were being looked after, Mme. Storey and I
visited the Captain's cabin aft of the chartroom. The cords with
which he had been bound lay on the floor where they had been
dropped in his haste. They had been cut through with a sharp
instrument. One of the drawers of his dresser stood open. It had
not been so before. The drawer contained his toilet articles in
neat array. There was an empty space amongst them.</p>

<p>"Their friend," said Mme. Storey, "whether he or she, entered
this room first and removed the Captain's gag. The Captain told
him there was a knife in the drawer and he cut the cords. Then
they went across the hall and freed Niederhoff."</p>

<p>On the coverlet of the bed she found a tiny smear of fresh
blood. "Hm!" she said, "it was either a woman or a man unhandy
with a knife. He cut himself in his haste."</p>

<p>"Or the Captain," I put in.</p>

<p>"No, himself. The Captain's feet rested on this spot. He was
wearing boots. The woman or man that we are looking for has a
little cut on his left hand."</p>

<p>In Niederhoff's room we found a silver pocket-knife with the
Captain's initials on it; H.G.</p>

<p>When Mme. Storey told Les what she had discovered, he said,
scowling: "By God! I'll make him tell who set him free!"</p>

<p>"How?" she asked dryly. "Under torture?"</p>

<p>Les looked like a nice boy caught in mischief. "Hell, no!" he
growled; "I couldn't torture a prisoner."</p>

<p>"Quite!" she said. "We'll find out some other way."</p>

<p>Dinner was served about nine. Except for the delay, it was
exactly the same as any other night. The shaded lights, the
flowers, the deft servants; the beautiful dresses of the women
and the gleaming bosoms of the men. <i>Hors d'oeuvres</i>, soup,
fish, etc., each with its proper wine. The guests were thirsty
and the champagne flowed generously. The same rattle of talk and
meaningless laughter&mdash;only to-night one could hear sharp,
nervous overtones.</p>

<p>Everybody was present at the table. If nothing else, curiosity
brought them. Their faces offered an interesting study in
expression. Everybody was watching his neighbours covertly.
Everybody knew without being told that Captain Grober had not got
up the murderous plot all on his own. Everybody knew there was a
Judas amongst us. The real Judas, of course, was making believe
to be suspicious of his neighbours too.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey talked as foolishly as the rest&mdash;but with a
purpose. While she rattled I knew that she was listening to every
word that passed, and weighing its significance. Often she was
steering the talk without appearing to, Adele never spoke except
in an undertone to Tanner.</p>

<p>"Horace, what port are we making for?" asked Sophie.</p>

<p>"Farman is working out our position now," he answered. "We'll
decide later."</p>

<p>"Heavens! I suppose that will mean weeks and weeks of delay at
some stuffy little island. What a bore!"</p>

<p>"But, mother, the islands are beautiful!" protested Celia,
looking at Emil. "What fun it would be to explore one of them
thoroughly."</p>

<p>Sophie paid no attention to her child. "Rosika, how you lied
to me about Fahrig being a thief!" she said. "Why didn't you tell
me the truth? Didn't you trust me?"</p>

<p>"Didn't want to frighten you," said Mme. Storey. "I thought
you'd screech and alarm the ship...You did screech!"</p>

<p>"Only a little one. Anyhow, somebody screeched before me."</p>

<p>"That was Fahrig."</p>

<p>"All that yelling broke out on deck while I was still only
half dressed," Sophie went on in her vivacious fashion. "It was
perfectly awful to have to sit there and finish, not knowing what
was going on!"</p>

<p>"Finest thing I ever heard of!" said Martin, blinking at her.
"I will lay it before the Carnegie Hero Fund. Woman bravely
remains at her mirror making up her face after mutiny breaks
out!"</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid!" said Sophie. "Where were you, I should like
to know?"</p>

<p>"Dressing," said Martin. "In my cabin astern I couldn't hear
anything. I didn't know anything was wrong until I got up on
deck."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it awful!" cried Mme. Storey, laughing. "I must have
been drunk with excitement. I have no idea now what I did or
said. It has passed completely out of my mind."</p>

<p>There was a general chorus around the table. "Rosika, you were
marvellous!" etc.</p>

<p>"Just what was I doing when you came on deck?" she asked
Martin laughingly.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he answered, "I was dazed with it all. It took
me a minute or two to get the hang of it. The first thing I can
remember is hearing you tell the sailors how you caught
Fahrig."</p>

<p>"Oh, the worst was over then! You should have seen Farman
slide down from the bridge."</p>

<p>"Everybody's hero!" said Martin sarcastically.</p>

<p>Horace looked at him with quick sympathy. "Sure!" he said,
"I've had about all I can stomach of the noble Farman!"</p>

<p>"Well, thanks to him we're having our dinner!" put in
Emil.</p>

<p>Horace glanced at him in dislike.</p>

<p>"Rosika!" cried Dr. Tanner from the other end of the table,
"do you mean to say when you and Bella led the Captain out of the
winter-garden you stuck him up by your two selves?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we had a couple of husky sailors out on deck...Didn't
he go like a lamb to the slaughter!" she laughed.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you call on me and Adrian for help?"</p>

<p>"You weren't armed. We didn't want a rough and tumble."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Horace, looking up, "what did you do when
the racket broke out. I didn't see you rushing to our aid."</p>

<p>"My first thought was of the women," said Tanner. "I ran down
to A deck to get Adele."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes?" said Horace sarcastically.</p>

<p>Tanner swelled a little. That was his inferiority complex
working. "I wouldn't let Adele finish dressing. I threw a cloak
around her shoulders and pulled her up on deck. It's always my
instinct to get out in the open when there's trouble."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Horace.</p>

<p>"I wonder how the Captain and the first officer got loose,"
said Celia innocently.</p>

<p>The same thought was in everybody's mind. There was an awkward
pause, then we all started talking.</p>

<p>"I was dressed before the trouble started," Emil volunteered.
"I happened to be up forward when somebody yelled mutiny' on the
bridge, and Farman came sliding down right in front of me."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let Emil get in it," said Celia.</p>

<p>"Funny thing mob psychology," said Martin in his owlish style.
"It was that little crack of Rosika's about the electrician that
really saved all our necks."</p>

<p>"But that was right at the beginning," I said.</p>

<p>"My child," he retorted, "I have heard the whole story six
times over within the hour...No matter how they may be yelling
for blood, if you can make them laugh they'll turn around and eat
out of your hand!"</p>

<p>"Out of Rosika's hand," amended Emil.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear such fiendish yelling!" said Sophie, with a
shudder.</p>

<p>"Do let's talk about something else," said Adrian plaintively.
Adrian had better control of himself at dinner, but he was jumpy.
There was a bright red spot burning in either cheek. He had drunk
a lot of champagne.</p>

<p>His remark attracted Horace's attention to him. "And what did
you do in the great war?" he asked with a cruel smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't set up to be a fighter," simpered Adrian. "I am
just a playboy."</p>

<p>"But what was your reaction when the noise broke out?" Horace
persisted. "I'm curious to know."</p>

<p>"I ran up forward," said Adrian. "I looked into the wheelhouse
and saw men struggling..."</p>

<p>"And then you ran aft again!"</p>

<p>"How could I help?" said Adrian. "I wasn't armed. It was dark
in the wheelhouse, and I couldn't even tell which was friend and
foe...Like Frank, I thought of the women. I ran down to A deck to
reassure Sophie."</p>

<p>"Seems to me you were the one who needed reassuring," said
Horace. There was a laugh around the table. Adrian made believe
to join in it.</p>

<p>"I didn't see you," said Sophie sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, I knocked on your door and you didn't answer."</p>

<p>"Then what did you do?" asked Horace.</p>

<p>"Ran up on the promenade with the others."</p>

<p>"What was I doing when you reached the scene?" asked Mme.
Storey, laughing. "Swedish exercises?"</p>

<p>"You were just climbing up on the stool."</p>

<p>"You weren't there," I said. "You didn't come until..."</p>

<p>"You're mistaken," he said quickly. "I was round on the port
side, where you couldn't see me. Afterwards I came over to
starboard."</p>

<p>I thought: Maybe so! But I didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey appeared to pay no attention to this, but she was
merely biding her time. There was a lot of fun up and down the
table at Adrian's expense. Finally Martin blinked at him and
drawled:</p>

<p>"Funny two brothers should look alike, and be so different in
character!"</p>

<p>This gave her an opening. "Character is written in the hand,"
she said. "Let me see what yours has to say, Adrian."</p>

<p>He was seated opposite her. He stretched his right hand across
the table. "No, the left one!" she said. "The left hand shows
what you were born with, and the right hand what you have made of
yourself."</p>

<p>She grasped his fingers and bent them back, the better to see
his palm. Adrian winced involuntarily, and made as if to withdraw
his hand. "What's the matter?" asked Mme. Storey. "Oh! you have
cut yourself! I'm so sorry I squeezed it."</p>

<p>When she called attention to it I could see the little cut on
the inside of his middle finger. It had been soaked in water and
no blood showed, but only the clean little wound. It began to
bleed again, and Adrian hastily conveyed his finger to his
mouth.</p>

<p>"That ought to be covered," said Mme. Storey carelessly.</p>

<p>"What did you read in his hand?" somebody asked.</p>

<p>"A long life of luxury!" she said.</p>

<p>The talk went on. Adrian took his part in it without
suspecting that he had betrayed himself. The discovery opened up
a lurid vista in my mind. Adrian fascinated me, he was so soft
and so dangerous. I couldn't reconcile it with the way he played
the fool.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; A SHIP DIVIDED
AGAINST ITSELF</h2>

<p class="first">AS we left the dining-saloon a wireless message
was handed to Mme. Storey. She took it down to our cabin to
decode it. When she returned on deck she did not tell me what was
in it. I judged from her face that it was serious, though as long
as the crowd was around she appeared as rattle-brained as
ever.</p>

<p>Horace, Martin, Mme. Storey and I went up to the chartroom to
consult with Captain Farman. Horace brought Martin into it as a
matter of course. To do Martin justice, I must say that his
suggestions, on the whole, showed better judgment than those of
his employer.</p>

<p>Old Jim was still at the wheel. The door into the wheelhouse
was closed, of course. Les told us of the arrangements he had
made.</p>

<p>"I know the crew pretty well," he said, grinning, "because
I've had a fo'c'sle view of them. I have chosen two men that I
can trust for helmsmen. I want to use old Jim to look after the
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Who will take command while you are sleeping?" asked Mme.
Storey,</p>

<p>"McLaren, the chief engineer. He's had sea experience enough
to keep her on her course, and that's all I need. I will be close
at hand if I'm wanted. There has never been any trouble in the
engine-room, and he can be spared."</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Horace.</p>

<p>"I'll show you."</p>

<p>We all bent over the chart. Les made a dot with his pencil.
"According to the reckoning I found when I took command, we are
here: 10.70 North; and 56.17 West. We have passed beyond all the
islands out into the open sea. I will verify it as soon as I can
take an observation. As you can see, we are about equi-distant
from Georgetown, Demerara, Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, and
Bridgetown, Barbadoes. We could fetch either place about noon to-
morrow. Barbadoes is the nearest to home."</p>

<p>"What's the nearest U.S. port?" asked Horace.</p>

<p>Les spread another chart on the table. "In actual mileage,
Miami is a little nearer," he said, "but we have made so much
easting we can fetch New York almost as soon."</p>

<p>"How long to New York?"</p>

<p>"We're making about sixteen knots now. I don't know what she
could do if we pushed her. Anyhow, we could make New York inside
of four days."</p>

<p>"Then I'm for New York," said Horace.</p>

<p>"I'm for Barbadoes," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded irritably.</p>

<p>"Because it's nearer."</p>

<p>"But we've got the situation well in hand."</p>

<p>"There will be just that much less time to hatch a new
plot."</p>

<p>"The plotters are under lock and key!"</p>

<p>"Some of them are."</p>

<p>Opposition always put Horace in a fury. "Damn it!" he cried,
"I'm not going into any stuffy British port to get all tied up in
red tape! Do you know what British red tape is? We would spend
the rest of our lives unwinding it! Bottled up in some dirty
little two-by-four harbour! I won't risk it!"</p>

<p>"The British get to the bottom of things," said Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"Maybe so! But they're too slow for me!...What do you say,
Martin?"</p>

<p>Martin agreed with him, of course. "I'm for New York. In our
own home town we know where we are."</p>

<p>"Sure!...Farman, will you undertake to navigate us to New
York?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir, if those are the orders."</p>

<p>"Let it be New York, then. Those are your orders."</p>

<p>"I'll dope out the course immediately, sir."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey sucked in her cheek and said nothing.</p>

<p>As we filed out of the chartroom she said to Horace: "There
are other matters that I must talk to you about."</p>

<p>"Come down to my cabin," he growled.</p>

<p>This was the first time I had been in Horace's private suite.
His sitting-room occupied the whole width of the vessel aft on A
deck. There was a bedroom of almost equal size beyond it, and a
wardrobe and bathroom tucked into the stern. A dream of luxury,
but I did not envy the possessor of it all. He looked as if seven
devils were gnawing him. He was in love with my employer, she
exasperated him beyond endurance merely by being what she
was.</p>

<p>We dropped into seats alongside the charming Adam
fireplace&mdash;Horace could have a real fire there if he wanted
it. "Well, what is it?" he growled. He scowled at her like a
pirate even while his sullen eyes were begging for mercy.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said: "It was Adrian who set the Captain and first
officer free."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Horace. "How do you know?"</p>

<p>She told him.</p>

<p>"God!" he muttered. "My own brother!...Oh, I know he's a fool,
and I treat him rottenly, but he is my brother!...Maybe there's
some mistake. He appeared out on deck several minutes before
Grober burst out below. I saw him."</p>

<p>"That proves nothing," said Mme. Storey. "Grober and
Niederhoff probably took the time to look for guns."</p>

<p>"Martin," growled Horace, "go find Adrian and bring him here.
Don't tell him what I want him for. Let me see his face!"</p>

<p>Martin slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with Adrian?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait till I see him," he groaned.</p>

<p>"You had better make up your mind before you see him. He ought
to be locked up with the other prisoners."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Horace violently. "I won't advertise him to the
whole ship! You ask too much of me!"</p>

<p>"You speak as if I wanted something for myself," she said
mildly. "My job is to protect you. The nearer we get to port the
greater the danger you are in. The crooks can't face an
investigation."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll confine him," he muttered. "But not with the
others. I'll make him keep to his own quarters."</p>

<p>"You might as well let him range the ship. The stewards have
master-keys that open all the doors on A deck except your
suite."</p>

<p>"What can I do with him, then?"</p>

<p>"Put him on B deck. Those rooms all have steel doors, and
there are only two keys to each; one in the door and a duplicate
in the possession of the watchman. When we were discussing what
to do with the other prisoners, Farman spoke of a room aft of the
galley which is occupied by two cooks. They can be shifted."</p>

<p>"All right," he growled.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Martin and Adrian came in. Adrian was
laughing in his usual light-headed fashion, but his eyes
anxiously sought Horace's face to learn the reason for this
summons.</p>

<p>"Sophie and I have been having it out hammer and tongs," he
said. "I love to get the old girl going, she..."</p>

<p>"Cut the comedy," growled Horace. "I want to know why you set
Grober and Niederhoff free after I had ordered them tied up."</p>

<p>Coming like that, the shock knocked the breath out of Adrian.
His face turned perfectly blank, his mouth opened. It was a
moment or two before he could speak. "Why...why...why..." he
stammered.</p>

<p>"Don't lie," said Mme. Storey quietly. "We know the whole
story. You cut the Captain's bonds with a penknife out of the
drawer of his dresser. In your haste you cut your finger."</p>

<p>Adrian stared at her helplessly. "...I wasn't going to lie,"
he gasped. "It's true, I set them free."</p>

<p>Horace leaped to his feet. "You damned traitor!"</p>

<p>We thought he was going to spring on Adrian, and we watched
him closely. When he got his breath, Adrian turned as glib and
voluble as a woman.</p>

<p>"How was I to know?" he whined. "You never tell me anything. I
heard a cry of mutiny on the bridge. I ran forward. I saw the
Captain bound and helpless on his bunk. Of course I set him free!
I thought if there was mutiny aboard he was the one to handle
it!"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me this at once?" demanded Horace.</p>

<p>"I was afraid." Adrian hung his head. "Well...I'm no hero.
When I saw I had done the wrong thing I was afraid to say
anything."</p>

<p>Horace looked at Mme. Storey. "What do you think?" he
growled.</p>

<p>"I think he's lying," she said coolly.</p>

<p>"So do I!...Have him locked up."</p>

<p>She went to the telephone and called the wheelhouse. She asked
Les if he could be spared for a few minutes to come down.</p>

<p>A wild cry broke from Adrian. "No, Horace, no! Don't listen to
her! I swear I have never knowingly done anything against you!
I'm your brother!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my brother!" muttered Horace bitterly.</p>

<p>"I don't mind being locked up!" cried Adrian. "I'd go through
anything for you! But it kills me to think that you believe I'm
treacherous to you. Oh, God, I wish you'd never made your filthy
money! We were happy when we were poor. When we were boys
together in the old home. Remember how I followed you around and
imitated everything you did. How happy I was when you would let
me go fishing with you. You were my hero!"</p>

<p>Horace walked away, clapping his hands to his head. "For God's
sake cut it out!" he muttered.</p>

<p>This painful scene was brought to an end when Les came in.</p>

<p>"Lock my brother up," growled Horace.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Les, without batting an eye.</p>

<p>"Put him in the room on B deck that you were telling me
about," added Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Shall I put him in irons like the others?"</p>

<p>"No!" shouted Horace.</p>

<p>"I advise it," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I won't have it! What harm can he do if you keep him locked
up? Give me one of the keys to his room, and you keep the
other."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." Les jerked his head towards the door. "Come
on!"</p>

<p>Horace was a wreck when this was over. I could see that my
employer was sorry for him, but she would not let him see it,
fearing that he might build too much on it. "Come on, you need a
drink," she said.</p>

<p>We got our drink in the lounge because we suspected that the
rest of the gang was up in the winter-garden, and we didn't want
to meet them. Afterwards the four of us walked on deck. Mme.
Storey presently sent me down below.</p>

<p>I did not go to bed because I suspected that our work was not
over for the night. Sure enough, in about ten minutes Mme. Storey
and Horace came into our sitting-room. As soon as I had left the
deck, Horace sent Martin away, hoping to have a few minutes alone
with her. Thus she had got rid of Martin without appearing to.
She then invited Horace down to our suite.</p>

<p>His face fell when he saw me. "Oh, God! here's Bella! Don't
you ever go to bed, Bella?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," said Mme. Storey, "because we've got to
talk business."</p>

<p>"More business!" he growled.</p>

<p>"I have a very unpleasant proposition to put up to you."</p>

<p>"Well, it can't be as bad as what you've done already.
Shoot!"</p>

<p>She lit a cigarette while she considered how to avoid angering
him. "I do not feel that we have got to the bottom of this
business," she began slowly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it doesn't seem to me that there is enough
persistency in Adrian's character to make him stick to a thing in
the face of so many difficulties. I suspect that somebody is
spurring him on. A woman, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Ha! you mean Sophie," exclaimed Horace. "It's true they've
been getting pretty thick lately. What of it if Adrian is locked
up."</p>

<p>"Sophie or Adele," she said.</p>

<p>"Adele!" he echoed, staring.</p>

<p>"It may be that she would like to get her hands on that legacy
before you make another will. Or she may fear that you will force
her to return the diamond. Whatever her motives may have been in
the beginning, now she is so beside herself with jealousy and the
desire for revenge she doesn't know what she's doing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, revenge?"</p>

<p>"In her way, she was in love with her husband."</p>

<p>"If she was in love with her husband, why should she be
jealous because I have dropped her?"</p>

<p>"Do you expect a woman like that to be consistent?" Mme.
Storey asked dryly.</p>

<p>He merely scowled at his cigar.</p>

<p>"She ought to be parted from Tanner," my employer went on.
"The man has fallen completely under her influence. God knows
what they may be hatching together."</p>

<p>"He can have her," growled Horace. "...What do you want me to
do about it?"</p>

<p>"Confine both women to their cabins until we reach New York.
Or, if you like, confine all the guests so you won't appear to be
showing any favouritism."</p>

<p>"Imprison my guests!" said Horace, staring. "You must be
crazy! Think of what a story they would make of it if the
newspapers got hold of it!"</p>

<p>"There's bound to be such a storm of publicity I don't see
what difference a little more would make. If you find later that
you have wronged anybody you can always make it up to them."</p>

<p>Horace reddened with anger.</p>

<p>"I won't do it!" he said. "You're taking too much on
yourself."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey was nettled too. "On myself?" she said. "My only
object is to see that you're landed safely in New York. That's my
job! After that you can go your own way."</p>

<p>"Go my own way!" repeated Horace with extreme bitterness.
"Don't I know it! I know you hate me! But why do you have to keep
rubbing it in? If you treated me decently you could do anything
you liked with me!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey fetched a long breath for patience. She smiled
suddenly.</p>

<p>"I don't hate you," she said. "But it's impossible to get
along with you. You despise those who flatter you and you quarrel
with those who do not!"</p>

<p>This never reached him, "I don't fight against women," he said
sullenly. "I'll take my chance with Sophie and Adele."</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, dismissing the subject with a gesture.
"There's another thing..."</p>

<p>"Another?" he echoed, scowling at her in fear of what was
coming.</p>

<p>"There is Martin," she said firmly.</p>

<p>His face flushed up again. "Now you're after Martin!" he
cried. "You don't want to leave me a friend in the world! I won't
hear a word..."</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" she commanded, so peremptorily that he stopped
midway, staring at her with his mouth open.</p>

<p>She opened the door and glanced out into the corridor.
"Fortunately there were no listeners," she said. "Moderate your
voice."</p>

<p>"I won't hear a word against Martin!" he went on sullenly.
"Martin and I understand each other. I would trust him with my
last dollar. I have no secrets from Martin. He's a darn sight
more than just an employee. He's my friend, sometimes I think my
only friend. At any rate, he's the only soul aboard this damned
vessel that really cares for me. The others are just making up to
my money. Martin doesn't care for money. He wouldn't let me put
him down in my will. Martin is the only one who speaks to me
honestly..."</p>

<p>"Not too honestly," she murmured.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"He has the appearance of frankness, but I have noticed that
he never says anything disagreeable to you."</p>

<p>"Why should he?"</p>

<p>"He does to everybody else. It's his line."</p>

<p>"You would say that!...What have you got against him,
anyway?"</p>

<p>"No evidence, if that's what you mean. Only a motive."</p>

<p>"In heaven's name, what motive could Martin have for doing me
in? He would only be out of a job. He is not down in my will.
Neither the first nor the second will. He has seen them
both."</p>

<p>"You have forgotten the diamonds," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Diamonds?" he repeated, staring.</p>

<p>"The diamonds he brought aboard at Willemstad."</p>

<p>"I think you must be out of your senses!" said Horace.</p>

<p>"Not altogether," she returned, smiling. From the desk she got
the wireless message that had come after dinner. Between the
lines she had decoded it in pencil.</p>

<p>She handed it to Horace without comment. Later I read it. It
ran:</p>

<p>"Finally got in touch with Etienne Joannot. Nobody else could
get the information. Joannot cables Coade's business in Holland
was to receive quantity of unset diamonds which Laghet has been
buying secretly through many brokers for year past. Value
estimated million and a half.</p>

<p>"LATHAM."</p>

<p>"Etienne Joannot is the cleverest detective in Europe,"
remarked Mme. Storey. "He has worked with me before."</p>

<p>Horace's face was crimson. "What do you mean by going behind
my back like that?" he demanded. "You have no business to be
prying into my personal affairs!"</p>

<p>"That's merely silly," she said coldly. "How did I know what I
was going to turn up? It was part of my job to investigate what
Martin was up to, as well as everybody else who was close to
you."</p>

<p>Horace subsided into sullen muttering. He was like a child
caught red-handed and trying to brazen it out. "Why shouldn't I
buy unset diamonds if I have the money to pay for them?" he
stormed.</p>

<p>"Why indeed?" murmured Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"They say we're headed for the revolution, and that all values
will be swept away. Well, whatever the state of society may be,
diamonds will still have a value!"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And why shouldn't you smuggle them into the
country on your yacht if you can get away with it? I am not an
agent of the Treasury. I'm merely trying to point out to you that
a million and a half is too great a temptation to put in any
man's way."</p>

<p>"Temptation!"</p>

<p>"Martin believes that nobody in the world knows about these
diamonds but himself and you. If anything happened to you they
would just naturally fall into his hands."</p>

<p>"I trust Martin," he said obstinately. "He's the only man
living that I can trust! And it's useless for you to urge me to
watch him or to lock him up. I won't go against my friend!"</p>

<p>"So I see," she said, spreading out her hands. "Where are the
diamonds now?"</p>

<p>"In the safe in my cabin."</p>

<p>"Martin has the combination?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I suggest that you ought to tell him that I know about the
diamonds. That can do no harm."</p>

<p>Horace grinned disagreeably.</p>

<p>"If he's as bad as you think, that would only be putting your
life in danger," he said.</p>

<p>"My life has been in danger ever since I took this case," she
said casually.</p>

<p>"Sure, I'll tell him," he said. "...Martin went abroad two
weeks before we sailed. How could he be mixed up in it?"</p>

<p>"You received your first warning the day after he sailed.
Perhaps everything had been arranged then."</p>

<p>He got up to go. "You will find that you are mistaken," he
said confidently. "You ought to make friends with Martin."</p>

<p>"I'll try," she said dryly.</p>

<p>Horace paused with his hand on the door-knob, and the hang-dog
look of appeal came into his face. "Would you like to see the
diamonds?" he asked. "You can have any one that you choose."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" said Mme. Storey. "I am only a woman!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; THE SECRET OF THE
POOL</h2>

<p class="first">IT was on a Thursday night that we headed for
New York. On Friday, as far as outward appearances went, we fell
into our usual routine aboard the yacht. The members of our
little party never had been honest with each other, consequently
they had no difficulty in keeping up appearances.</p>

<p>Always the same guarded eyes when we came together, the empty
vivacious talk, the meaningless laughter. It was tacitly
understood amongst us that after some trifling difficulties in
New York everything would be settled and we would all sail away
again for the islands of the blest in a sea of perpetual summer.
The fact that Horace himself would have to answer to a charge of
murder was discreetly overlooked. No one ever referred to Adrian
locked up below.</p>

<p>All this pretending that everything was lovely made the
situation much harder to bear. There were times when Sophie took
my arm and led me along the deck chattering, when I felt as if I
should scream. When I got up in the morning and when I went to
bed I was haunted by a horrible foreboding of trouble ahead. I
became as jumpy as a jack-rabbit.</p>

<p>It was the same with the others. When you caught them off
their guard there was a terrible look in their faces. In spite of
all the make-up in the world, Sophie's lost eyes made her appear
twice her age. Horace, when he thought himself unobserved, paced
the deck like a damned soul, chewing the inevitable cigar. The
passions that were consuming Adele made her look like a
caricature of her former self.</p>

<p>I must say for Adele that she did not make pretences. She was
like a strange cat aboard the ship. She spoke to nobody. All her
meals were served in her cabin. Tanner was generally with
her.</p>

<p>Les Farman quickly got his crew organised, and everything that
had to do with the ship seemed to run as smoothly as it had
always done. It took a heavy toll of the skipper because he had
no trained officers to share his responsibility. As the days and
the nights passed Les' eyes became red-rimmed through
insufficient sleep. But his good-humoured smile was
unchanged.</p>

<p>One new development that made for trouble was that Horace
appeared suddenly to recollect that he was engaged to Celia Dare.
Whenever Mme. Storey humorously turned aside his attempts to make
love to her, Horace sought the girl's company. Perhaps, manlike,
he thought he could bring my employer to terms this way. Celia
was terrified. She had no experience to guide her.</p>

<p>She used to come to our sitting-room with her troubles. Once
Mme. Storey said to her: "Celia, you're of age, aren't you?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded.</p>

<p>"Then it's up to you to play a woman's part. You have never
made believe to be in love with Horace and you don't have to
begin now. But you must avoid angering him as long as we are at
sea. We have trouble enough on board. Make Emil stay away from
you and treat Horace exactly as you used to treat him before Emil
came round. It's only for a few days."</p>

<p>The girl played her part very nicely, but the effect on Emil
was terrible. That nice boy went savage. He lurked in the corners
scowling at Horace with murder in his eye. Luckily Horace never
noticed him.</p>

<p>During these days Mme. Storey seemed to be taking Horace's
suggestion that she make friends with Martin. They had long
conversations on deck, most of which I did not overhear. But it
was clear that she was plumbing him&mdash;with very little
result, she confessed. Either there was nothing in him or he
could hide it better than any man of his age she had ever
known.</p>

<p>One morning when I was sitting alongside her she said to him:
"You're married, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "But I never mentioned it. How did you
know?"</p>

<p>She studied him through narrowed lids. "Oh, you have the
general expression of a married man."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Shorn," she said. "Like Samson."</p>

<p>It nicked his vanity. "What about Storey?" he retorted. "Where
is he?"</p>

<p>"Storey?"</p>

<p>"I mean the gent who gave you the right to hitch madame to
your name."</p>

<p>"Oh, Storey! He passed out of the picture so long ago I have
difficulty in recalling his features. I am free, white and
twenty-one plus!"</p>

<p>They chaffed each other back and forth endlessly. Just the
same Mme. Storey had found the joint in his armour; his wife.
Martin spoke of her in the humorous, slighting manner he adopted
towards everything, but he could not keep his voice from warming,
nor his strange peering eyes from becoming almost human.</p>

<p>"What's her name?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Miriam."</p>

<p>"What's she like?"</p>

<p>"An old-fashioned girl; really good. She fell for me because I
was such a bad guy."</p>

<p>"You're not very bad!"</p>

<p>"You don't know the half of it, dearie!...The missus' grand
aim in life is to save my soul. I tell you I have to watch my
step. If I reformed I would cease to interest her. On the other
hand if she knew the full extent of my wickedness she would turn
from me in horror!"</p>

<p>"You're a good psychologist," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Have
you got a picture of her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She sent me a snapshot in her last letter." He took the
envelope from his pocket.</p>

<p>I looked over Mme. Storey's shoulder, and saw a tall beautiful
girl with a sensitive face. She was smiling, yet there was a look
of sadness in her eyes, of which she was perhaps unaware.</p>

<p>"She is charming," said Mme. Storey handing it back.</p>

<p>Her sharp eyes took note of the address on the corner of the
envelope, and when we got down below she said: "Martin lives in
the Greycourt Apartments, number 2527 Broadway. Better put it
down."</p>

<p>On Saturday we ran into what Les Farman called "a whole gale,"
and the guests disappeared from the decks. It was one of the
historic gales in which several ships foundered. On the
<i>Buccaneer</i> we heard their faint S.O.S. calls, but we were
too far away to be of any aid. It was a terrifying experience;
the ship reeled and plunged like a mad thing. Yet the sea didn't
<i>look</i> rough, but only grey and snarling. In the middle of
it Les Farman came clumping down in sea boots and oilskins to
give us a word of cheer.</p>

<p>His face was beaming.</p>

<p>"It's immense!" he said. "You should come up on the bridge and
see how she rides it. Not a drop coming aboard! She's a duck of a
ship!"</p>

<p>After that we felt better.</p>

<p>By Sunday afternoon it was all over and the guests reappeared
on deck with their customary smiles. I expect most of us were
thinking: Only twenty-four hours more. Dinner was quite a lively
affair.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards there was an outbreak which showed how
thin was the crust of the volcano on which we were treading. It
happened in the lounge. Nobody could tell exactly how it started.
Apparently Adele and Frank Tanner were sitting in the corner
whispering when Horace came in to get a cigar. Horace didn't like
the way Frank stared at him and said so, whereupon Frank, fired
by a sense of Adele's wrongs, real and imaginary, suddenly went
crazy.</p>

<p>When I reached the scene Horace was shouting:</p>

<p>"You're fired, do you hear? Get out!"</p>

<p>"You brute! I wouldn't work for you for all your money!" cried
Frank.</p>

<p>"You don't have to tell me that! Get out before I throw you
out!"</p>

<p>"Where will you throw me?" snarled Frank. "Overboard? That's
your speciality, isn't it? You murderer!"</p>

<p>Horace struck the smaller man a blow that sent him staggering
back. He fell at Adele's feet and lay there panting and venomous.
"Murderer! Murderer!" he muttered. If he had had a gun that would
have been Horace's last moment. He was afraid to get up, for
Horace with his head thrust forward and teeth bared was waiting
to hit him again. Adele was perfectly quiet, but there was murder
in her face, too.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey slipped her arm through Horace's, and said
quietly: "Horace. It isn't worth it."</p>

<p>He passed a hand over his face and looked at her stupidly. The
spell of his rage was broken. He allowed her to lead him towards
the door. As they turned away together Adele laughed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they had to pass Emil to gain the door. The
young man's blue eyes were blazing.</p>

<p>Horace stopped. "What's biting you?" he growled.</p>

<p>"Why don't you hit a man your size?" said Emil.</p>

<p>"By God...!" Horace began, doubling his fist. But Sophie and
Celia screamed, and getting in front of Emil thrust him back
violently into a chair. Horace with a harsh laugh went out on
deck.</p>

<p>Martin, Mme. Storey and I accompanied him down to his own
suite. Martin didn't say anything, but waited on him kindly and
thoughtfully. In his own sitting-room Horace dropped in a chair
and pressed his head between his hands. As usual after his rage
had passed he felt sick.</p>

<p>"God!" he groaned, "a little bit more of this and I'll go
stark staring crazy. There's a conspiracy aboard this ship to
drive me mad! I spend my money on these people; I entertain them
like princes, and they turn on me and show their teeth like
rats!"</p>

<p>Martin fetched him a drink. Mme. Storey stood looking down at
him inscrutably. I could guess what her thoughts were. She
said:</p>

<p>"You've had a lot to bear. But there's only one day more. Why
don't you keep out of the way of these people to-morrow. Stay in
your own quarters. As soon as we reach port we'll get a fresh
deal all around. I believe that's good advice," he muttered.
"I'll do it..." He raised dog's eyes to her face. "...If you'll
come and spend part of the day with me, Rosy."</p>

<p>"Surely," she said. "I'd be glad to."</p>

<p>We left him.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>When I awoke next morning the sea was calm and bright. The
cold air that blew in through the open port was perfectly
delicious. The tropics might be all very well in their way, but I
realised that I was a child of the North. A wonderful lightness
of heart filled me! The hag-ridden voyage was almost over. To-
night I'd sleep at home!</p>

<p>I drew on my bathing suit and threw a dressing-gown around me.
It was a few minutes before eight. No sound from Mme. Storey's
room yet. I ran down the corridor. Only a few steps to the
forward companionway, and down two flights to the pool.</p>

<p>My morning swim was the one thing that I completely enjoyed
aboard the <i>Buccaneer</i>. I was always alone at that hour, and
could make believe that the marvellous pool was truly mine. The
black basin with its greenish water lazily following the movement
of the ship; the rows of slender pillars all around, and the
lighted dome&mdash;so beautiful.</p>

<p>I dipped my toe in the water to test the temperature. It had
been warmed; just right. I ran around to the forward end where
the springboard was. There was a splash of water on the marble
pavement indicating that Horace, as usual, had had his swim
before me. I walked out on the springboard, steadied myself,
sprang, and went in.</p>

<p>My hands, cleaving the water in front of me, collided with
something. I got the sickening feel of cold flesh and my senses
reeled. I came to the top gasping and fought my way out of the
water. Rolling out on the marble, I stared in horror at the spot
where I had gone in. A black head slowly rose to the surface, the
hair stirring in the water. A face appeared with open, staring
eyes; a limp naked arm.</p>

<p>Snatching up my dressing-gown I ran. I flew up the two flights
of stairs without the least consciousness of any exertion. I made
no sound, but it wasn't because I had self-control. I wanted to
scream; my throat ached with the desire to scream; but no sound
would come. I banged open the door of our sitting-room and fell
sprawling on the floor.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey ran out of her room. "Bella! Bella!"</p>

<p>"Horace...!" I gasped. "Horace...! Drowned in the pool!"</p>
<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; THE AUTOPSY</h2>

<p class="first">HALF an hour later seven of us were gathered at
the side of the pool: Mme. Storey, Les Farman, Martin, Sophie,
Celia, Emil and I. It took a powerful effort of the will on my
part to force me back to that dreadful place, but I knew my
employer would need me. I had got a grip on myself by this time.
It was only the ghastly shock of colliding with the dead body
under the water that knocked me off my balance.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey had spent the intervening time in examining the
place alone. I did not know what she might have discovered. Les,
aided by a sailor, had drawn the body out of the water and laid
it on the marble floor to the left. It was covered with a sheet.
Little runnels of water trickled from under the sheet and found
their way to the pool. Martin appeared to be a little dazed with
shock. Of all those aboard the yacht he seemed to be Horace's
only sincere mourner.</p>

<p>We huddled around the foot of the stairway as if afraid to
venture farther into the place. Adele was not present, which was
natural enough, but the absence of Frank Tanner, the ship's
doctor, was peculiar. My employer had just sent a steward for the
second time to ask him to come.</p>

<p>She and Les were examining the dressing boxes at the far end
of the pool. In one of them Horace's dressing-gown and slippers
had been found. This in itself was noteworthy, because none of us
ever troubled to use the boxes, but dropped our things on the
nearest bench.</p>

<p>Frank Tanner finally came down the stairs. I don't think the
others were aware of it, but Adele was with him. I caught a
glimpse of her standing on the stairs above the landing, where
she could hear all that went on without showing herself. Tanner
was an unpleasant-looking young man. He took no trouble to
conceal his feelings, but glanced at the sheeted form with a dull
malignancy in his protruberant eyes. One almost expected him to
kick it.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey came to meet him. "Doctor," she said, "we must
have an autopsy."</p>

<p>"Can't see the necessity," he answered. "The man is obviously
drowned. Very likely he was insane. It's the kindest thing you
can say about him now."</p>

<p>"A strong swimmer can't drown himself unless he ties his own
arms and legs," she answered mildly. "However he might want to
die, his limbs would strike out involuntarily."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Horace had a stroke while he was in the water,"
ventured Celia timidly.</p>

<p>Everybody welcomed this suggestion. We had had enough of
murder. "It is possible," said Mme. Storey. "We must have an
autopsy to find out."</p>

<p>"I never conducted an autopsy," said Tanner sullenly.</p>

<p>"You must have assisted at many during your student days."</p>

<p>"No," he said sullenly. "Wouldn't know how to begin."</p>

<p>She was patient with him. "I have been present at autopsies,
and I can direct you. We must find out if there is water in the
lungs."</p>

<p>"I don't recognise your right to give me orders," said Tanner
insolently. "You say you had a certain agreement with Horace
Laghet. Well, he's dead and that cancels it. I won't touch the
body without the authorisation of the nearest relative."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned to Les. "Has Adrian been notified of what
has happened?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam."</p>

<p>"He should be brought here."</p>

<p>Les ran up the stairs. Mme. Storey lit a cigarette. The rest
of us waited with fast-beating hearts for the next scene. The
room where Adrian was confined was only a few steps from the top
of the first flight of stairs, and he presently came running down
with a wild expression. Les followed more soberly.</p>

<p>Adrian thrust us violently out of his way and ran to the body.
Dropping to his knees beside it he tenderly drew down the sheet a
little way. "Oh, Horace! Horace!" he mourned. "Oh, my brother!"
Kneeling there, he covered his face with his hands. It looked
rather theatrical to me. His eyes were dry.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey gave him full time to recover himself.</p>

<p>"Adrian," she said, "it is obvious that there must be an
autopsy to determine the cause of death. The doctor requires your
authorisation before performing it."</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, "Autopsy!" he gasped in real or
simulated horror. "You mean cut him up! Oh God, no! My brother!
No! No!"</p>

<p>"As soon as we reach port there will have to be an autopsy,"
she said patiently, "the law will require it."</p>

<p>"Well, if they make me consent I can't help myself!" cried
Adrian. "But I will never consent voluntarily. No! No! No!"</p>

<p>"But if there has to be an autopsy anyway, it should be held
now," she persisted. "Within the next few hours there will be all
sorts of chemical changes within the body. If the truth is to be
revealed it must be done now!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Adrian. "I couldn't bear it! As his nearest
relative and his heir, I refuse!"</p>

<p>One little word sent the investigation flying off at a new
tangent. "You're not his heir," said Sophie sharply.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Adrian.</p>

<p>"A week ago Horace made a will leaving his residual estate to
Celia unconditionally."</p>

<p>There was an astonished cry from the girl: "What! Mother! To
<i>me!</i> No! No!"</p>

<p>"I can't believe it!" said Adrian. He was surprised, but less
surprised than you might have expected, considering that his
whole future depended on Horace's will.</p>

<p>"In other words, I'm a liar!" snarled Sophie. "Well, I'll show
you!"</p>

<p>She ran up the stairs, and there was another ghastly pause in
the proceedings. Nobody wanted to look at anybody else. Celia was
crying in dismay:</p>

<p>"I didn't know anything about this! I don't want his money! I
won't take it!...We won't take it, will we, Emil?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Emil stoutly.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled at them dryly. Experience had taught her
that this violent antipathy to taking money would be modified
later. "Don't worry about it now," she said. "That can all be
arranged."</p>

<p>Presently Sophie came running and stumbling down the stairs
with a face of horror. She caught her heel on a step and pitched
forward into Les' arms. "I've been robbed!" she gasped. "...The
will...it's gone!...Robbed!"</p>

<p>Adrian smiled disagreeably. We were all aware of something new
in him. All his life he had lived in fear of Horace. Now that
Horace was gone a confidence in himself was beginning to
appear&mdash;but this did not necessarily prove that he had
brought about Horace's death.</p>

<p>"Where was it?" asked Mme. Storey</p>

<p>"In a drawer of the desk, the safest place I had. The key in
my handbag..." Sophie caught sight of Adrian's smile. "You
needn't smile like that!" she cried. "You know I'm speaking the
truth! You stole the will!"</p>

<p>"How could I steal what I didn't even know existed?" demanded
Adrian indignantly.</p>

<p>"I don't know how you knew, but you knew!"</p>

<p>"Funny that the beneficiary didn't know," sneered Adrian.</p>

<p>"You pretended to be my friend!" cried Sophie. "You were
continually in my room. You had the opportunity! You stole
it!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked at me, and held out a little key. I knew
what she wanted, and ran upstairs. I heard her saying: "As it
happens, I know what Horace's wishes were, and I can show you
all."</p>

<p>I got the copy of the will out of her despatch-case and
carried it back to her. When he saw the typewritten paper, Adrian
turned a sickly clay colour. I judged that he was familiar with
the contents, because he scarcely listened to the reading.
Scowling and biting his fingers, he was planning how to meet this
set-back. The others listened tensely.</p>

<p>"To my brother Adrian Barnes Laghet," read Mme. Storey, "I
give and bequeath the sum of five hundred thousand dollars. If he
has any sense he will create a living trust with this sum in
order to prevent himself from squandering his principal."</p>

<p>One could hear Horace's own surly voice in this paragraph. I
glanced at the sheeted form in a kind of terror.</p>

<p>"To my friend Adele Holder the sum of fifty thousand dollars."
The names of several other ladies followed with varying amounts
to each; then: "After deducting the above bequests, I hereby
devise and bequeath any and all property that I may die possessed
of to my fiancée, Celia Dare, provided that the engagement is
still in effect at the time of my death. Should the engagement
have been broken, the residue of my estate is to go to my said
brother Adrian Laghet."</p>

<p>In the final paragraph Horace directed that Martin Coade and a
certain New York trust company were to serve jointly and
severally as executors and administrators.</p>

<p>The reading was followed by a moment's silence, broken only by
the distressed murmuring of Celia: "No! No! No!" Finally Adrian
asked if he might be permitted to see the paper. Mme. Storey
turned it around for him to read.</p>

<p>"What's this line that has been crossed out?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Horace was good enough to include me amongst his
beneficiaries," said Mme. Storey dryly, "but I declined."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Adrian. "That thing's no good. It's not signed.
It's not written in Horace's hand but on the typewriter. You
couldn't prove that Horace ever saw that paper."</p>

<p>"Well, it would depend on how much credence the court was
inclined to put in my testimony. I can swear that Horace handed
me that paper, expressly stating at the same time what his wishes
were in regard to his estate. My secretary was present and can
corroborate what Horace said. Perhaps Martin can add further
corrobortion."</p>

<p>"I never saw that will before," said Martin, blinking. "Horace
made it out without consulting me. I know nothing about it."</p>

<p>This was a lie, because Horace had told us that he had shown
both his wills to Martin.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey shrugged. "Anyhow," she said, "I can promise you
that this will will stand up in court. There will be Sophie's
testimony, you see, that the original was stolen from her. There
are plenty of precedents for such wills."</p>

<p>Adrian turned away with a sick face. Flinging an arm against
the marble wall, he leaned his head against it. There is no doubt
but that this gesture was sincere. Whether he was innocent or
guilty it was staggering to have one of the greatest fortunes in
the world snatched away like that. I was surprised that he took
it standing. "To come back to this question of an autopsy..."
said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Sophie spoke up quickly: "I won't permit it!"</p>

<p>My employer looked at her with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You said my will was good, didn't you?" Sophie went on
volubly. "I guess that puts it up to me!"</p>

<p>"Your will?" said Mme. Storey. She made believe to glance over
the paper. "You are not mentioned here. Celia is the heir."</p>

<p>"I'm her mother!"</p>

<p>"She's of age."</p>

<p>"She will do what I tell her!"</p>

<p>"Celia," said Mme. Storey, "you have heard all that has been
said. In my opinion an autopsy is necessary. What is your
wish?"</p>

<p>The girl answered tremulously: "I want you to do whatever you
think is best, Rosika."</p>

<p>"Celia!" cried Sophie angrily. "Would you turn against me?
Before all these people! You know nothing about this woman! She
may ruin us!"</p>

<p>"How could she ruin us?" asked the girl simply. "She only
wants to find out the truth." To Mme.</p>

<p>Storey she went on: "If it is really up to me, I want you to
act for me."</p>

<p>"In other words you constitute me your attorney?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"I forbid it! I forbid it! I forbid it!" cried Sophie.</p>

<p>My employer ignored her. She said to Martin: "As Horace's
executor, what do you say?"</p>

<p>What Martin's real feelings were I had no means of telling. He
merely blinked. He must have known that if he had refused, Mme.
Storey would have gone ahead anyway. He said impassively: "I
consent."</p>

<p>To Les, Mme. Storey said in a lowered voice: "Have the body
carried to Dr. Tanner's surgery on A deck. If Dr. Tanner refuses
to go ahead I will do what is necessary myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam," said Les. He spoke as if this were the most
ordinary situation. Amongst all those hysterical people it was
wonderfully reassuring.</p>

<p>"Another thing," said Mme. Storey; "I assume that this tank
can be pumped out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam."</p>

<p>"How long will it take?"</p>

<p>"A couple of hours."</p>

<p>"Please have it done. My secretary will remain here to make
sure that nothing is disturbed or removed until I get back."</p>

<p>"How about him?" asked Les with a jerk of his head in Adrian's
direction.</p>

<p>"Ask him to return to his room until we resume
our...er...conference."</p>

<p>"It's unjust!" cried Adrian. "To treat me as my brother's
murderer!...Oh, Horace!...Why, I didn't even have anything to
gain by his death!"</p>

<p>"You didn't know that! You didn't know that!" cried Sophie
viciously.</p>

<p>"Come on, Mr. Laghet," said Les.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; THE NEEDLE</h2>

<p class="first">WITHIN an hour or so we were all gathered at the
edge of the pool again. Adele was there now, sitting on a bench a
little apart from the others, with Dr. Tanner standing beside
her. The water in the basin was slowly going down. Everybody was
covertly watching Mme. Storey's pale inscrutable face, wondering
what secrets it hid. She was conferring with Les in a
whisper.</p>

<p>Les went up the stairway, and she turned to us. "The
investigation reveals that there is no water in Horace's lungs,"
she said. "Consequently he had ceased to breathe before his body
entered the pool."</p>

<p>She paused, and one could hear a shuddering breath escape her
hearers.</p>

<p>She went on dryly: "Owing to my ignorance and Dr. Tanner's
unwillingness, it was impossible to carry the autopsy any
further. The water splashed on the edge of the pool shows that
Horace fell or was thrown into the pool alongside the diving-
board. Cases of cerebral hemorrhage or 'strokes' as they are
called, are so rare in men of Horace's age and good condition I
think that explanation should be rejected. Moreover, I have found
a microscopic puncture in his leg which leads me to believe that
he was poisoned."</p>

<p>There was a silence while the ugly word sank in. None of us
liked to look at the others.</p>

<p>Suddenly Adrian dried out:</p>

<p>"If he was poisoned, Sophie did it! Look at her face!"</p>

<p>Sophie's face crimsoned, then turned pale as paper again. She
could not control the trembling of her lips. "It's a lie!" she
stammered. "Just a clumsy attempt to divert suspicion from
himself!"</p>

<p>"Sophie did it! Sophie did it!" he reiterated. "She was
terrified Horace would find out how Celia was carrying on with
Emil! It nearly came out last night. She had to act quick before
Horace got wise and broke the engagement!"</p>

<p>Celia was aghast at this ugly charge. "It's a lie!" screamed
Sophie. "I know nothing about poisons!...Do I have to submit to
this man's horrible insults?" she demanded of us generally.</p>

<p>"I believe in the French fashion of letting everybody talk,"
said Mme. Storey dryly. "The truth will come out!"</p>

<p>Sophie took refuge in noisy tears. Celia undertook to comfort
her, staring over her mother's head with a strained white face.
It was a terrible initiation for the inexperienced girl.</p>

<p>"Who was the last to see Horace alive?" asked Mme. Storey. She
turned to Martin. "We left him with you about half-past eleven
last night."</p>

<p>"I left him a few minutes after you did," said Martin. "He
repeated his determination not to leave his rooms the next
day."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything about taking a swim?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Les returned down the stairs bringing Beaton, Horace Laghet's
valet. Beaton was a little man no longer young, with a keen,
good-natured face. Suspicion was never directed against him.</p>

<p>"Beaton," said Mme. Storey, "when did you last see your
master?"</p>

<p>"Last night when I was helping him to dress for dinner,
Madam."</p>

<p>"Not after that?"</p>

<p>"I never went into him at night, Madam, unless he rang for
me."</p>

<p>"How about this morning?"</p>

<p>"I heard him go past my door just before seven o'clock, Madam.
That was his usual hour. He would take a few turns on deck before
going down to the pool. But I did not see him. I went in to lay
out his clothes for the day according to custom..." Beaton
hesitated, and Mme. Storey asked:</p>

<p>"Well, what happened then?"</p>

<p>"About half-past seven Mrs. Dare came to the door to ask for
him, Madam."</p>

<p>Every eye turned towards Sophie.</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? what of it?" she demanded defiantly. "I
asked for Horace, Beaton told me he had gone down to the pool,
and I returned to my room, that's all."</p>

<p>Beaton looked rather strange and Mme. Storey asked: "Beaton,
can you confirm the fact that Mrs. Dare returned to her
room?"</p>

<p>"No, Madam," said Beaton reluctantly. "She didn't go back to
her room. At least, not right away."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you!" cried Adrian.</p>

<p>"I thought it strange she should come to see Mr. Laghet at
that hour," Beaton went on, "and I opened the door a crack and
watched her. She went along the corridor to the forward
companionway and turned out of sight there. I cannot swear that
she went down the companionway, but she did not appear
again."</p>

<p>"She went down all right!" cried Adrian. "She was the last to
see Horace alive!"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him!" retorted Sophie. "It's true I went down to
the pool, but he wasn't there. I looked in the gymnasium and he
wasn't there. So I went back to my room."</p>

<p>"After Beaton had told you he was in the pool, didn't it
strike you as strange that he wasn't there?" asked Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>"No. This is his yacht. He can go where he pleases on it."</p>

<p>"Did anyone see you return to your room?"</p>

<p>"No. Celia was still asleep in her room."</p>

<p>"What was it that you wanted to see Horace about so urgently?"
asked Mme. Storey mildly.</p>

<p>"None of your business!" retorted Sophie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother!" murmured Celia in distress. "We have nothing to
hide!"</p>

<p>"Certainly I have nothing to hide! But that woman has no
authority over me!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey glanced at Les Farman. He said calmly: "Mrs. Dare,
I am the master of this ship, and as long as we are at sea I have
absolute authority over everybody on board. I am supporting Mme.
Storey in this investigation, and I direct you to answer her
questions."</p>

<p>"And what if I defy you, too?" snapped Sophie.</p>

<p>He coolly faced her out.</p>

<p>"I will lock you up, and turn you over to the police when we
reach port."</p>

<p>Sophie wilted somewhat.</p>

<p>"I don't mind answering any proper question, but I won't be
brow-beaten!...It's no great matter anyhow. After that ugly scene
in the lounge last night, I just wanted to find out how Horace
was. It was just a friendly impulse."</p>

<p>"Friendly!" cried Adrian with a wild laugh. "Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said to Sophie: "I have one more question to ask
you. When Celia told you that she was in love with Emil, why did
you tell her that if she kept it secret for a little while,
everything would come out all right?"</p>

<p>Sophie was taken by surprise. Her eyes rolled in a terrified
fashion.</p>

<p>"I didn't...I didn't&mdash;" she stammered.</p>

<p>"It is useless to lie," said Mme. Storey deprecatingly. "For
Celia told me at the time, and I'm sure you don't want to force
her to lie now."</p>

<p>"I was only thinking of her happiness," faltered Sophie. "I
would never force my child into a loveless marriage."</p>

<p>Adrian laughed again.</p>

<p>"You and Celia are practically without means, I understand,"
said Mme. Storey relentlessly. "Emil has made a reputation
artistically, but he is far from reaching the point where he can
cash in on it. How did you think they were going to live?"</p>

<p>Sophie was stumped. "That's nobody's business," she
muttered.</p>

<p>"Believe me," said Mme. Storey mildly, "it is easier to answer
such questions here than it will be in court. For your own sake
and for Celia's, I advise you to speak frankly."</p>

<p>Sophie appeared to come to a sudden resolution. "Well, I
will!" she said hardily. "When I heard of the plot against
Horace's life, and when I saw how he acted on board, raising up
enemies in everybody, I thought it quite unlikely that he would
live long. That's why I held him to his promise to make a will in
Celia's favour. And that's the sole reason why I told her that if
she waited, things would probably come out all right!"</p>

<p>Celia was shocked by this admission. "Oh, Mother!" she
murmured.</p>

<p>"From the moment she got that will out of him, Horace was
doomed!" cried Adrian. "She was here when he died! I demand that
she be locked up!"</p>

<p>Things looked bad for Sophie. She had been caught in several
lies. Her nerve failed her. She looked around in a terrified
fashion and began to weep helplessly. "I didn't! I didn't!" she
faltered. "Everybody is against me."</p>

<p>"Look at her!" cried Adrian. "She's found out! Lock her
up!"</p>

<p>"One moment," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Let us go a little
further into this." She turned to me.</p>

<p>"Bella, as I understand it, you got down here about ten
minutes to eight, or say, quarter of an hour after Sophie says
she left. Did you see any water on the floor except the one
splash that you have described?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You told me that you dived into the water. Was the diving-
board wet?"</p>

<p>I shivered at the thought of that dive. "No, it was dry," I
said.</p>

<p>"That bears out Mrs. Dare's story," she said coolly. "Horace
had been in the pool for half an hour before she got here. It is
not conceivable that he sat here doing nothing. It was his
custom, as you all know, to dive repeatedly from the board. He
climbed out by the ladder to the right of the board. Well, if
there was no water on that side, and if the board itself was dry,
it proves that he never entered the water until he fell, or was
pushed in dead, to the left of the board. That must have been
before Sophie got here."</p>

<p>What a change in Adrian's and Sophie's face when they heard
this. Sophie began to weep afresh, but these were tears of
relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rosika!" she sobbed. "I thought you were against me!"</p>

<p>"I am neither for nor against anybody here," said Mme. Storey
mildly. "I just want to get to the bottom of this business."</p>

<p>Sophie quickly dried her tears, and turned to Adrian
truculently. "What I'd like to know is," she said, "how you knew
I was down here this morning unless you were here yourself!"</p>

<p>"Nothing to it!" retorted Adrian. "You know very well that I
was locked up!"</p>

<p>"So you say!"</p>

<p>"We will go into that later," put in Mme. Storey. "Just now I
want to examine the floor of the pool."</p>

<p>This called our attention to the fact that it was almost
empty. It had a sloping bottom and the water had receded to the
deepest part under the diving-board. Mme. Storey walked around
the edge, keenly searching over the black tiles that lined it,
and we followed her, unable to contain our curiosity.</p>

<p>Not until the water had been completely drawn off did she find
what she was looking for. Then with a slight exclamation she
pointed to a small bright object shining against its black
background. It lay below the spot where I had found the water
splashed on the floor. We went down on our knees to get a closer
view. Everybody simultaneously recognised what it was, and a
horrified whisper went round:</p>

<p>"A hypodermic needle!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey went down the ladder to the bottom of the pool.
"Before I touch this thing," she said, "I want you to notice that
the plunger is pressed all the way down. Whatever poison this
needle may have contained, was discharged before it was thrown
into the water."</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; PROBING</h2>

<p class="first">WE all stood around Mme. Storey at the edge of
the empty pool. On her palm lay the sinister little nickelled
instrument. "Can any of you tell me anything about this?" she
asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"Has anyone here used a hypodermic needle during the voyage,
or do you know of one having been used?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>She singled out Tanner. "Doctor, you have such needles amongst
your equipment on board."</p>

<p>"Sure," he answered sullenly.</p>

<p>"How many have you?"</p>

<p>His pop-eyes rolled like those of a frightened horse. "I don't
know; I'll have to look," he muttered.</p>

<p>She bent a searching glance on him, and he blurted out:
"Three."</p>

<p>"How do you keep them?"</p>

<p>"In a cardboard box on a shelf in my surgery."</p>

<p>"Have you had occasion to use them during the voyage?"</p>

<p>"I have used one of them."</p>

<p>"Then the other two are still in their antiseptic
envelopes?"</p>

<p>"So far as I know, they are."</p>

<p>"Is this one of your needles?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? They all look alike."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey undid the handbag she carried under her arm, and
took a cardboard box from it. "I picked this up in your surgery a
while ago," she said, "thinking I might need it. Can you identify
it?"</p>

<p>"It may be the one," he said with a frightened sneer.</p>

<p>"If you doubt it, go and see if yours is there," she said
blandly.</p>

<p>He made no move to go. Mme. Storey lifted the cover from the
little box and we all saw the two needles in their unbroken
cellophane wrappers with a vacant space between them for the
third.</p>

<p>"You can't prove that that needle came out of there," he
snarled. "They all look alike. There may be a dozen such needles
aboard this vessel!"</p>

<p>"Possibly," she said dryly, "but not likely. Of course, if you
can produce the needle that belongs to this box that will
automatically let you out."</p>

<p>"My shelves are not locked," he said, "anybody could have
picked it up&mdash;just like you did!"</p>

<p>"But the door of the surgery is always locked when you are not
there," she said. "I am told that you had the lock changed so
that no steward or other servant of the ship could ever
enter."</p>

<p>He was silenced.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you to trace the missing needle," she said
mildly. "When did you use it last?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"I decline to answer."</p>

<p>"On what grounds do you decline?"</p>

<p>"Professional privilege."</p>

<p>"Very proper," she said dryly. "Perhaps your patient will
release you." She looked around from face to face. "Adele," she
said in the gentle voice that can presage so much trouble, "will
you permit the doctor to answer my question?"</p>

<p>Adele stared and reddened. "Why do you pick on me?" she
snapped.</p>

<p>"Well, I have noticed on several occasions during the last few
days that you were under the influence of a narcotic."</p>

<p>"Well, why shouldn't I be, if I feel like it?"</p>

<p>"No reason whatever. All I want to know is, did the doctor
administer it hypodermically?"</p>

<p>"Yes," muttered Adele. "My nerves were shot to pieces!"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite! When did you receive your last treatment from
him?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday morning about ten."</p>

<p>"Ah, during the storm. Did the doctor give you the needle
then?"</p>

<p>"No," said Adele, startled. "Why should he?"</p>

<p>"So you could treat yourself if necessary."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't. I never had the thing in my hand."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey spoke a word or two in Les Farman's ear, and the
skipper went up the stairs again. Adele and Frank glanced at each
other apprehensively.</p>

<p>My employer turned to the doctor. "After you treated Adele,
you washed the needle, put it in its box and returned the box to
the shelf, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he answered sullenly. "Those are automatic
actions. You do them without thinking."</p>

<p>"You had no occasion to use the needle after that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did Adele leave the surgery immediately?"</p>

<p>"No. She stayed for a while talking."</p>

<p>"Then it is possible that she may have taken the needle
without your knowledge?"</p>

<p>His eyes bulged out. "No!" he cried.</p>

<p>"But you cannot swear that it was there after she left."</p>

<p>He saw that he had been led into a trap. He bit his lip and
breathed hard.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey transferred her attention to Adele. "Did you, in
fact, take the needle when the doctor wasn't looking?"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Adele. "I told you I had never had it in my
hand."</p>

<p>"Where were you at a few minutes before seven this
morning?"</p>

<p>"In bed and asleep," said Adele, staring.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey appeared to forget them. She tapped a cigarette on
the back of her hand and walked away lighting it, and studying
deeply. Adele and Tanner were badly shaken. In fact, we all
watched her apprehensively, wondering what she was going to
spring.</p>

<p>Presently Les Farman came down the stairway bringing two
additional witnesses; Jepson, one of the dining-room stewards,
and Hankley, a steward on A deck. Mme. Storey said without
looking at them:</p>

<p>"Jepson, please repeat the story that you told the captain a
while ago."</p>

<p>The steward, a brisk and good-looking young fellow, clearly
enjoyed taking the centre of the stage. "Yes, Madam," he said;
"shortly before seven this morning..."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," she interrupted; "how can you fix the time so
exactly?"</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Laghet was walking the deck, ma'am. Every morning
he comes up&mdash;I mean he used to come up for half a dozen
turns around the promenade just as regular as a clock."</p>

<p>"What were you doing?"</p>

<p>"Working in the dining-saloon, Madam; rubbing down the
furniture."</p>

<p>"Well, go on."</p>

<p>"I hears somebody coming up the companionway. The saloon doors
are closed, but I peep out between the sash curtains. It is Mrs.
Holder. She has a funny look, so I watch her. She couldn't see
me. She waits just inside the door until Mr. Laghet comes around
the deck and pops out on him. They stand there talking."</p>

<p>"Could you hear what they said?"</p>

<p>"No, Madam. That is, just a word or two."</p>

<p>Adele was listening to Jepson with a kind of stony terror.</p>

<p>"The boss is mad," Jepson went on, "and Mrs. Holder is sort of
crying. I mean her face was all twisted up, but I don't see no
tears. He wants to get away from her, but she holds on to him,
talking fast. They are just outside the door into the lobby."</p>

<p>"You told the captain what they said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam, they get excited, and then I begin to hear. The
boss keeps saying: 'Not a cent! Not a cent!' She says something I
can't hear, and he comes back with: 'That's no romantic memory!'
She says: 'Horace, our child! our child!' And he says: 'So you
say!' She was crying and hanging on to him; he gives her a shove,
and she falls down."</p>

<p>"He comes into the lobby cursing," Jepson went on. "He turns
his head and says to her: 'It's nothing to me whether he marries
you or not! Why don't you cash in on the diamond?' Then he runs
down the stairs."</p>

<p>"He is lying!" said Adele huskily.</p>

<p>"It sounds like Horace," remarked Mme. Storey dryly. "Isn't it
true that you met him on deck this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was just an ordinary meeting. This man is making
up a sensational story about it."</p>

<p>"What did you talk to Horace about?"</p>

<p>"About Frank Tanner. Frank said it would ruin him if Horace
discharged him without cause. I was just trying to persuade
Horace to give Frank a letter stating that his professional
services had been satisfactory."</p>

<p>"Crying?" asked Mme. Storey dryly.</p>

<p>Adele was near tears then. "I wasn't crying!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned back to Jepson. "What happened after Mr.
Laghet went down the stairway?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Holder comes in from the deck, and Dr. Tanner shows
himself in the doorway of the library opposite me. He is hiding
in there, but I didn't see him before. They don't speak to each
other. Mrs. Holder, she just shakes her head at the doctor, and
goes on down the stairway. The doctor, he goes aft through the
library. That's all I see."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said to Adele: "Where did you go?"</p>

<p>"To my room!" she cried hysterically.</p>

<p>"Hankley," Mme. Storey asked of the other steward, "did you
see Mrs. Holder early this morning?"</p>

<p>Hankley was our steward, a little dry man with a face like a
mask. "Yes, Madam."</p>

<p>"Please describe the circumstances."</p>

<p>"Well, Madam, as I was coming forward through the starboard
corridor on A deck, I seen her coming up the forward
companionway..."</p>

<p>"No!" cried Adele in wild terror.</p>

<p>"You can swear that it was Mrs. Holder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Madam. She had on the pink lounging pyjamas with a
red girdle that I have often seen her wearing."</p>

<p>"You are certain that she was coming <i>up</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam. As she turned to the port side her back was
towards me. She didn't see me."</p>

<p>"What time was this?&mdash;careful how you answer."</p>

<p>"Somewhere around seven, Madam. I didn't take no precise
notice of the time. Somewhere around seven."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" cried Adele. "I never went below A deck. I never
saw Horace again. I swear it!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey merely smoked and looked at her inscrutably.</p>

<p>"If I did go below," cried Adele, "it was only because I was
so agitated I went beyond my deck and had to come back
again."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey said nothing.</p>

<p>"Frank!" cried Adele, beside herself with terror, "tell her
that I couldn't have done it! Tell her that I never had the
damned needle!"</p>

<p>Tanner's face was ghastly. He moistened his lips. "It's true,"
he said. "Adele never had that needle."</p>

<p>"You cannot swear that she didn't have it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can! At three o'clock yesterday afternoon it was in
its place in the box with the others. I saw it there."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so when I first questioned you?"</p>

<p>"I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"Your sudden recollection is not very convincing."</p>

<p>"I'll swear it!" he cried. "I'll swear to it in court or
anywhere else!"</p>

<p>"How did you come to look in the box at three o'clock
yesterday afternoon?"</p>

<p>"No particular reason. My eye happened to fall on it. I
couldn't remember putting it back in its place, and I looked to
see if it was there. Adele was not in the surgery at any time
after that, and the door was locked when I was not there
myself."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mme. Storey dryly. "Then how did the needle that
was locked up in your surgery get into the pool here?"</p>

<p>He saw that he was getting in deeper, and his eyes rolled.</p>

<p>"You haven't proved that it is the same needle!"</p>

<p>"Well, let's put it in another way. What has become of the
needle that was in this box at three o'clock yesterday
afternoon?"</p>

<p>He had no answer to that. We could all see that he was near
the breaking point.</p>

<p>"Did you take it out yourself?" she asked softly.</p>

<p>My employer suddenly took a new line. "Do you expect to marry
Mrs. Holder when we get ashore?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," mumbled Tanner, "I couldn't presume to look so
high."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey smiled dryly. "Then how does she come to be
wearing the ring with the bloodstone that used to decorate your
little finger? It is rather noticeable, because Mrs. Holder has
so many more valuable rings."</p>

<p>"Just a friendly keepsake," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Mme. Storey's face suddenly became rather terrible. "I
suggest that you and Mrs. Holder staged that scene on deck early
this morning for the purpose of getting money out of Horace that
would enable you to marry!"</p>

<p>"No!...No!" they murmured.</p>

<p>"It is evident from Jepson's testimony that Mrs. Holder worked
an ancient and well-known trick for that purpose. It failed; and
I suggest that you and she then determined to put Horace out of
the way in order to make sure of the money that was coming to her
under his will!"</p>

<p>"No!" they whispered abjectly.</p>

<p>"After the scene on deck where did you go?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"To my room."</p>

<p>"You weren't headed in that direction. You are familiar with
every corner of this ship. I suggest that you went down the after
companionway and made your way forward through B deck to the door
that opens on this stairway just above us."</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Mme. Storey turned to Les Farman. "Captain, I recommend that
you lock the doctor up. It is certain that he killed Horace
Laghet, or has guilty knowledge of who did. We can wireless for
the New York police to meet us at quarantine."</p>

<p>Tanner broke then. "No! No!" he cried. "I didn't do it! I'll
tell all! That needle passed out of my hands yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Who got it?"</p>

<p>"Adrian!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Storey. "That's what I was trying to get
at!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; THE CLUES IN THE
DRESSING-BOXES</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was an interval for lunch. Whatever
happens, lunch has to be eaten. I had to have mine alone beside
the pool, because of the evidence there, which Mme. Storey feared
somebody might try to destroy. We could not be sure who was with
us and who was against us aboard this ship.</p>

<p>While I was munching my sandwiches Martin Coade came down the
stairway blinking. "Hello, Pink!" he said. He had taken to
calling me Pink as a delicate compliment to my hair.</p>

<p>"Well," I said. "It didn't take you long to finish.</p>

<p>"Oh, who could eat?" he said, with a gesture. "Thought you
might get the horrors alone in this charnel house," he went on,
glancing around, "so I came down."</p>

<p>"Thoughtful of you," I said dryly.</p>

<p>"This business has knocked me endwise!" he said, passing a
hand over his face.</p>

<p>Any display of feeling was so out of Martin's line that it
made me slightly uncomfortable. I didn't know what to say.</p>

<p>"You think I'm completely hard-boiled, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly hard-boiled," I said, "but you've adopted a
certain line. In fact, I don't know anything about you."</p>

<p>"I'm quite human, Pink."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dare say. But you are continually blinking your eyes in
order to conceal your feelings."</p>

<p>He laughed noiselessly. "The Madam put you up to that!"</p>

<p>"Meaning that I haven't got sense enough to see it for
myself!"</p>

<p>"I suppose it never occurred to you that the private secretary
to a millionaire has to damned well learn how to hide his private
feelings."</p>

<p>"I get your point; but I'm not your boss."</p>

<p>He said: "I like you, Pink."</p>

<p>"Say it without blinking!" I said.</p>

<p>He laughed. "You're not exactly a pretty girl, but you have
plenty of oxygen in your composition."</p>

<p>In spite of my determination to keep cool, Martin always
succeeded in exasperating me in the end. He was an ugly fellow,
but there was something upsetting about his cool ways. He was
infernally clever. I wouldn't answer him, and he strolled away
towards the door into the gymnasium.</p>

<p>"Don't go in there," I said.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Orders."</p>

<p>"Do they apply to me?" he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether they do or not. But you can't go in
there until I find out."</p>

<p>He came back from the door. "What does the Madam expect to
prove by the gymnasium?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"What do you make of this foul business, anyhow, Pink? I'm all
at sea."</p>

<p>"Same here."</p>

<p>"The Madam have some theory that she's working out."</p>

<p>"Very likely," I said. "But she never confides her theories to
anybody until they're proven."</p>

<p>"Everything points to Adrian, but it doesn't seem possible
that such a consummate fool would be able to engineer a plot like
this."</p>

<p>"Maybe Adrian, too, has succeeded in concealing his real
character from all of us," I remarked.</p>

<p>Martin laughed his noiseless laugh, which wasn't a laugh
really, but only a facial spasm. "One for Pink!" he said. "...But
seriously, Pink, I wonder she doesn't turn her attention to young
Emil. If it's a motive she's looking for, he has as strong a
motive as anybody. Through Horace's death he gets the girl and
the money!"</p>

<p>"Emil and Celia didn't meet until they came aboard," I pointed
out. "And this plot was laid before we sailed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there were two plots," he said carelessly.</p>

<p>I didn't want to get drawn into a discussion of the case, so I
didn't answer. Martin talked on about this and that until the
others began to come down the stairs.</p>

<p>A table was brought down from the lounge to make it easier for
me to take notes of the proceedings. When Mme. Storey sat down at
it with me beside her, my note-book spread before me, the place
immediately took on the aspect of a court. The others sat on the
marble benches against the walls, or stood at the foot of the
stairway. Old Jim, the deck-hand, was now present to give
testimony.</p>

<p>The moment Adrian was brought down from his place of
confinement he started protesting his innocence. "It's a cruel
lie to accuse me of fratricide! Cruel and silly, because I was
locked up when it happened!"</p>

<p>"All right," said Mme. Storey. "You'll have full opportunity
to defend yourself directly. First I want to ask the doctor a few
questions."</p>

<p>Tanner had recovered from his extreme terror. He was anxious
to testify. His dull pop-eyes, incapable of expressing any
feeling, made him look as if he were lying whether he was or not.
When Mme. Storey asked him to explain how the needle got into
Adrian's hands, he said:</p>

<p>"Yesterday, after lunch, old Jim came to my surgery and told
me that Adrian was sick and wanted to see me. He said the Captain
had given permission, provided he&mdash;I mean Jim, stayed in the
room. So I went back with him. Jim remained standing in the
doorway of Adrian's room, but he couldn't hear what we said to
each other.</p>

<p>"Adrian was in a rotten state of nerves, but there wasn't
anything else the matter with him. He told me he was on the verge
of a breakdown, and unless he got a shot of codeine he'd go all
to pieces. He said he was accustomed to taking codeine
hypodermically, and he had plenty of the stuff, but he'd broken
his needle. He wanted another. I said I'd have to ask the
Captain's permission, but Adrian begged so hard not to publish
the fact that he was an addict that I said I would.</p>

<p>"How much did he offer you?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Tanner's eyes bolted. "I'm not supposed to take any fees
aboard the ship," he muttered.</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you what you were supposed to take, but what you
got in this case."</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I returned to the surgery and got the needle, also some
harmless tablets. I showed Jim the tablets I was giving Adrian,
and slipped him the needle when I shook hands with him on
leaving."</p>

<p>"What else went with the needle?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" cried Tanner excitedly. "Nothing but some soda mint
tablets. I swear it!...Why, if Horace was killed with that needle
some terrific poison must have been used. I have nothing of that
sort in my pharmacy. You can search it! I don't even know of a
poison that would act so quickly!"</p>

<p>"We'll go into that later," she said quietly. "If you are an
honest man, why didn't you tell me this when I first questioned
you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want to take the responsibility of accusing Adrian,"
he mumbled.</p>

<p>"You mean you had been paid to keep your mouth shut!"</p>

<p>Tanner's head sunk down.</p>

<p>"This doesn't prove anything!" put in Adrian excitedly. "I can
explain it all quite easily."</p>

<p>"Oh, no doubt!" said Mme Storey dryly. "But wait a
minute...Jim! Does your account of these two visits agree with
the doctor's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Jim, in distress, "but I never knowed the
doctor slipped him anything."</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't!"</p>

<p>"I should have been present myself," said Les Farman,
scowling. "But I was so busy! And I didn't feel that I ought to
make the man wait for medical assistance!"</p>

<p>"Never mind it now," said Mme. Storey. "One can't foresee
everything...Jim! Did Mr. Adrian Laghet have any other
visitors?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am. Only the Captain and me."</p>

<p>"Let me explain," cried Adrian.</p>

<p>"All right, go ahead!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"What the Doctor said was perfectly true," said Adrian
eagerly. "I asked for the needle for the purpose he said, and he
brought it to me. I had the codeine."</p>

<p>"Captain," said Mme. Storey, "wasn't he searched when he was
locked up?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Madam. I'll swear there was no codeine on him, nor
anything else of that sort."</p>

<p>"It was in my dressing-case which was fetched to me
afterwards," said Adrian. "In a secret pocket."</p>

<p>My employer looked inquiringly at Les.</p>

<p>"I doubt it!" he said strongly. "I searched the dressing-
case."</p>

<p>"Well, let it go for the moment. The essential thing is, how
did the needle get down here in the pool?"</p>

<p>"It's not the same one," said Adrian confidently.</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Can you produce the needle the doctor gave
you?"</p>

<p>"No. I threw it out of the porthole."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey's eyebrows went up. "Oh! you threw it out of the
porthole! Why did you do that when you have been so crazy to get
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I got to thinking things over," Adrian said
dramatically, "and it scared me the hold that stuff was beginning
to get on me. I made up my mind I'd suffer anything sooner than
become a slave to it. And I threw the needle through the
porthole. It's at the bottom of the ocean!"</p>

<p>"Very commendable," said Mme. Storey, with deceitful sympathy.
"So the habit was beginning to get a hold over you?"</p>

<p>Adrian was a born romancer. His big brown eyes rolled in
agony. "Oh, it was awful!" he groaned. "That craving! I fought
against it, but it was too strong for me. I was beginning to lose
my self-respect!" His face registered a bright hope. "But I think
the worst is over now. I haven't had any of the stuff for three
days. The craving is not so strong as it was."</p>

<p>"Take off your coat," said Mme. Storey softly. "Roll up your
left shirt-sleeve."</p>

<p>He saw the pit he had digged for himself, and fear leaped up
in his eyes. "Oh, the marks of the needle are all healed now," he
said.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey opened her little bag and took out a magnifying
glass. "The wounds heal, but the marks do not disappear for a
long time. This glass will show me."</p>

<p>Adrian, staring at her, breathing fast, made no move to take
off his coat.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you used the right arm," she said casually. "Some
do. Show me both arms."</p>

<p>"I didn't use the needle on my arms," he muttered.</p>

<p>"On your legs, then?" she said calmly. "Well, this is no time
for modesty. Show me."</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" said Adrian nervously. "What's
it got to do with Horace, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It has this to do with Horace," she answered with a steady
look. "You have never used a hypodermic needle on yourself. You
didn't want this needle for yourself. You are lying!"</p>

<p>Adrian hung his head. For a moment he was at a loss. But only
for a moment. His wits came to his aid again. "You are right, I
lied," he murmured, as if crushed with shame. Just the same, I
noticed him looking sideways to see if his story was getting
across. "I lied just to make a better story. Not for the reason
you think."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the true version?" she asked dryly.</p>

<p>"It's true that I never possessed a hypodermic needle," he
said. "I have never used one on myself. But I wanted to do so. I
had the bottle of codeine. Had used it for toothache. And I was
nearly crazy under the false accusation that had been made
against me. I thought if I could give myself a shot of codeine I
could get some rest."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Mme. Storey. "But you didn't use it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" he said with a shudder. "Just as I was about to use
it, a reaction set in, and I pitched the needle and the bottle
out of the porthole!"</p>

<p>"What! the bottle too!" she said. "What a pity! Suppose you
had another toothache!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you don't believe anything I say!" he said sadly. "What
difference does it make anyway? I never got out of my
prison!"</p>

<p>"I wonder!" she said softly. She turned to Les. "Captain, I
understand that there are two keys to the room where Adrian was
confined. I assume that Jim had one of them. Where is the
other?"</p>

<p>"I have it, Madam. The boss wanted to keep it, but I told him
I couldn't be responsible for the prisoner unless I had it, and
he gave it to me. Since then it has been in my pocket, and as you
know, I have never had my clothes off since I took command."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said, "has your key to Mr. Adrian's room ever been
out of your possession?"</p>

<p>The old sailor looked distressed, and moved his feet uneasily.
"Only for two-three minutes, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"This morning."</p>

<p>"How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Well, Ma'am, when I fixed Mr. Adrian's breakfast and took it
to him, I found the key weren't in my pocket. I was in a way,
Ma'am. I run back to the pantry, and there it was lying on the
shelf where I fix his tray. It's only a little way from his room
to the pantry and I had only missed it two-three minutes."</p>

<p>"Now, let me get this straight; the pantries and the galley
are on B deck, immediately over our heads?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"On B deck there are watertight doors between each hold, but
they are left open in fine weather, and you can carry the food
aft to Mr. Adrian's room in number three hold?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"Jim, why did you take the key out of your pocket and lay it
on the pantry shelf?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't tell you, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"Do you remember taking it out of your pocket?"</p>

<p>The old sailor's distress increased. "No'm. Can't say as I
exactly remember doing it."</p>

<p>"Had you seen the key before this morning?"</p>

<p>"No'm."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps you did not have it at all."</p>

<p>Jim scratched his head helplessly.</p>

<p>"Where do you sleep?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"In the room next to Mr. Adrian's. The boss put me there so if
Mr. Adrian wanted anything he could knock on the wall."</p>

<p>"Do you take off your clothes at night?"</p>

<p>The old sailor's modesty was alarmed. He glanced around to see
if anybody was laughing. "Yes, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"Are you a sound sleeper?"</p>

<p>"I calc'late so, 'm."</p>

<p>"Do you lock your door at night?"</p>

<p>"No'm," he said in surprise. "It never come into my mind to
lock the door on myself."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey looked at Les and spread out her hands. "How
easy!" she said ruefully. "Jim is too honest a man to make a good
jailer!"</p>

<p>"It's my fault!" said Les. "I should have warned him!...At
first I kept the key in my own hands and made Jim come for it
when he wanted it, but the boss ordered me to let Jim keep it, in
case Adrian ever wanted anything."</p>

<p>"No use crying over spilt milk," she said, shrugging. "We must
find out who let Adrian out."</p>

<p>"I didn't get out," said Adrian.</p>

<p>"The five men who are confined on the boat-deck," Mme. Storey
went on; "can you assure me that none of them have been out?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said Les. "I keep the key to that room, and Jim
comes to me for it. Moreover, either Mr. McLaren or myself is on
the bridge at all hours, and we never forget that room."</p>

<p>"Nobody on the outside has been in communication with
them?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but myself and Jim."</p>

<p>"The telephone?"</p>

<p>"Disconnected."</p>

<p>"Then we must look elsewhere," she said.</p>

<p>"Nobody has been to my room!" cried Adrian. "I swear it! I saw
nobody except Jim and the Doctor from the moment I was locked up
there until I was brought down here this morning!"</p>

<p>There was a ring of desperate truthfulness in his voice, yet
it seemed as if he must be lying. "How did you get out then?"
asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"I haven't been out! This is all guesswork on your part!"</p>

<p>"Not all guesswork!" she said quietly. "We have traced the
needle to you. It next turns up at the bottom of the pool. How
did it get here? You were familiar with Horace's habit of bathing
at seven every morning. I suggest that you stole down here before
that hour and hid yourself in the dressing-box immediately behind
the diving-board. You cut a tiny hole in the curtain so you could
watch for Horace's coming. You knew that he would walk out on the
board. You had only to reach out and stick the needle in his
leg..."</p>

<p>Adrian suddenly went to pieces. "No! No!" he screamed,
wrapping his arms around his head as if to shut out the sound of
her voice. "I did not kill my brother! I did not! You have no
proof!"</p>

<p>"Search him," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Yes, search me!" he cried, dramatically extending his arms.
"Search my person! Search my room! Search through my effects! I
have nothing to hide!"</p>

<p>Les Farman attended to the job. I need not enumerate all the
things they took from him; change, cigarette-lighter, wallet,
etc. There was also a pair of nail-clippers, a thing a man does
not ordinarily carry around with him. Mme. Storey smiled at the
sight of them. She thrust her own hand into the pocket from which
the clippers had been taken, and drew it out, holding a tiny
piece of rubberised cloth between thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>"This is the piece cut from the curtain," she said
impassively. "Notice how it fits the curve of the nail-clippers.
Adrian doesn't posses a pocket-knife. You see, he had no place to
throw it down here and he put it in his pocket. Later he forgot
to throw it overboard. Well, every murderer makes one mistake."
She walked down to the dressing-box and showed us that the piece
exactly fitted the hole in the curtain.</p>

<p>Adrian sank down on a bench, half-fainting. "No! No!" he
moaned. "I didn't kill my brother! You are hounding an innocent
man! I admit that appearances are against me, but I didn't do it,
I tell you! When it came to the point, I couldn't do it!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, when it came to the point?" asked Mme.
Storey sharply.</p>

<p>Adrian pressed his head between his hands. "I will tell all,"
he moaned, "but you must believe me!"</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; ADRIAN'S
STORY</h2>

<p class="first">ADRIAN remained sitting on the marble bench
against the wall with his head pressed between his hands. Once he
got started his story came tumbling out. His hearers listened in
amazement.</p>

<p>"It's true I meant to kill Horace! I was possessed to do it! I
planned it just the way Rosika has described. I was hidden in the
dressing-box with the poisoned needle in my hand, waiting and
watching. But when he came my nerve failed me. I couldn't do it.
Oh, God, I'm glad! I'm glad! that crime isn't on my
conscience!"</p>

<p>"But Horace is dead," said Mme. Storey gravely.</p>

<p>"I didn't have anything to do with it! It must have been a
stroke of some kind."</p>

<p>"The needle has discharged its poison."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that. I dropped it."</p>

<p>"Begin at the beginning," she said. "You have been planning
this for a long time past?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! Always I was wishing for Horace's death. I was so
afraid of him! He knew it, and he took advantage of it, even as a
boy. He was cruel to me. You wouldn't believe it! Always I made
out to be crazy about him. I did everything to please him.
Because I was afraid! Like a nightmare all my life!</p>

<p>"But it's only lately that I began to think of killing him. It
was like something that came into me from the outside. A voice
whispering: 'Kill Horace! Kill Horace! And you can begin to live
a life of your own!'</p>

<p>"When he began to get ready for this voyage it seemed like a
heaven-sent opportunity. So easy to get rid of a man on shipboard
without leaving any trace. I knew he would take me. He always
wanted to have me around. He took a pleasure in tormenting me and
making me feel cheap before others. And I always had to smile and
make out I was crazy about him. I was so afraid!</p>

<p>"The first time I met Captain Grober I felt by instinct that
he was crooked; that he would help me for money. He was just what
I was looking for, because he wasn't afraid. Little by little we
came to an understanding. His price was a million dollars, to be
paid out of my inheritance when I got it. Out of that he was to
pay whoever else might help us aboard the ship. He took care of
all the details."</p>

<p>"Then it was Grober set my house afire," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"He had it done. We weren't afraid that Horace would get on to
us. You had only to put Horace in a rage and he could see
nothing. But when we learned that he had employed you we were
scared. We never did find out who warned Horace. And Grober
undertook to make you miss the ship."</p>

<p>"And it was Grober who undertook to have me murdered in
Willemstad," she said dryly.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about murder. Grober simply said that
he would have you detained in Willemstad until the yacht had
sailed."</p>

<p>"Well, go on!"</p>

<p>"Harry Holder seemed like a tool just ready to our hand, and
Grober fixed it so that he was signed on as a sailor. Just put a
gun in Holder's hand and he'll do our job for us, Grober said.
Jealous husband and all that. Not the slightest risk to us. You
got on to Holder and shipped him to New York. He sneaked back
aboard the yacht, and Grober had him hidden, and had another gun
passed to him.</p>

<p>"That failed too. Then Grober picked on Les Farman to do the
job. You know what happened then. We never did find out who
warned Horace. Farman betrayed us, and Grober and I were locked
up separately. I thought it was all up.</p>

<p>"The second night that I was locked up I was awakened by
something knocking at the glass of my porthole. I opened it and
found a note hanging from a string outside. It was wrapped around
a bolt to give it weight. The note was written in pencil. It
wasn't signed, but I naturally assumed that it was from Grober or
one of his men.</p>

<p>"Have you still got it?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"No! After I memorised the contents I threw it overboard."</p>

<p>"What did it say?"</p>

<p>"It said: 'Horace knows all. This means a life sentence in the
penitentiary for you unless you're man enough to strike for your
own freedom. Send for the doctor to-morrow and ask him for a
hypodermic needle. Tell him that you are accustomed to give
yourself a shot occasionally and you have the stuff but have
broken your needle. The doctor's a wise guy. He won't inquire too
closely if you let him understand that it's to his advantage to
keep his mouth shut. When you get the needle tell him to slip his
hand behind the cushions of the wing-chair that stands to the
right of the fireplace in the lounge, and he'll get his. If you
get the needle I'll pass you what goes with it, and you can lay
for Horace in one of the dressing-boxes alongside the swimming-
pool. This is your last chance. Answer and let me know if you're
man enough. Destroy this.'"</p>

<p>"You answered that you would do it?" suggested Mme.
Storey.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I was as much afraid of Grober then as I was of
Horace," he muttered. "I couldn't stand going to prison. I would
go mad. I'm near mad anyhow, I've brooded on this so much.
Wouldn't take much to push me over the border-line. It was only
by killing Horace that I could get any peace!"</p>

<p>"Go on!" she said.</p>

<p>"We ran into the storm next day, and I didn't do anything
because I knew Horace couldn't use the pool in bad weather.
Yesterday afternoon, when it moderated, I sent for the doctor.
You know what happened then. He gave me the needle. And towards
dawn this morning I heard from Grober again, or whoever it was.
He sent down a little bottle of poison and the key to my room on
a string. There was a note with it telling me to fill the needle
and throw the rest of the poison overboard.</p>

<p>"The note also told me to leave my room at six-thirty, and to
hide myself in the dressing-box that was nearest to the diving-
board. After I had done the job I was to return to my room, throw
the needle into the sea, and tie the key to the string so that it
could be returned to Jim, thus destroying all links between me
and the death of Horace."</p>

<p>"You obeyed instructions?" prompted Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Adrian nodded. He began to shake at the mere recollection. "I
started out from my room. Oh, God! I was terrified. I was afraid
to go and I was afraid not to go. I died a hundred deaths on my
way down to the pool. But nobody saw me. It was only a dozen
steps from my door to the door opening on the forward
companionway.</p>

<p>"I hid in the dressing-box, and cut a little hole in the
curtain so I could see. When Horace came down the stairway I
began to shake so that I couldn't do a thing. He must have heard
something, for he yanked the curtain back and discovered me
there. He struck me, and it was then that I dropped the needle. I
don't know where it went.</p>

<p>"I grappled with Horace to prevent him from striking me. I was
no match for him. I expected him to kill me. But while we were
struggling he suddenly went limp. He sank down on the floor,
pulling me with him. When I got clear of him I saw that he was
dead. I could scarcely believe my senses. He was dead. He must
have had a stroke of some sort.</p>

<p>"I ran back to my room and locked myself in. The string was
not hanging down outside my porthole. But soon afterward it came.
I tied the key to it and after a moment or two it was drawn up.
That's all."</p>

<p>"You're sure the body was lying beside the pool when you last
saw it?" asked Mme. Storey. "It was found in the water."</p>

<p>"Certain," said Adrian. "I could not be mistaken about
that."</p>

<p>"You are positive he was dead?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. His eyes were staring open; his heart had
stopped. If you could have seen him you would know!"</p>

<p>Les Farman's eyes were blazing with scorn for the miserable
Adrian. "He's a pretty good liar," he said. "Tells the truth
until almost the end, hoping to get away with it!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps his story is all true," said Mme. Storey mildly. "It
sounds true."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Les in astonishment. And more than one of us
echoed him.</p>

<p>"Why should he lie about leaving the body beside the pool?"
she said. "He has nothing to gain by that."</p>

<p>"But the poison was discharged from the needle," insisted Les,
"and you found the puncture in Horace's leg."</p>

<p>"Surely. There is no doubt that Horace was killed. But perhaps
somebody else did it."</p>

<p>"What reason have you for saying that?"</p>

<p>"There is evidence that somebody else was concealed down here
at the same time."</p>

<p>"Oh, God bless you for that, Rosika! God bless you!" cried
Adrian hysterically. He snatched up her hand and fondled it,
"Nobody can deceive you!"</p>

<p>She freed her hand. "If you are not the murderer," she said,
with a cold glance, "it is only because of your cowardice."</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; THE CLUE OF THE
BURNT MATCH</h2>

<p class="first">MME. STOREY dismissed her audience, announcing
that she would resume her investigation in half an hour's time in
the lounge. They filed up the stairway with manifest reluctance.
They didn't want to miss anything. Adrian protested against being
locked up again. My employer pointed out that there was as yet no
proof of his story.</p>

<p>"What difference does it make?" he said. "There is no place I
could go except overboard. If I jumped overboard it would save
the state the expense of a trial."</p>

<p>"There is something in that," she said dryly. "On the other
hand, the authorities would blame Captain Farman and I for
allowing you to cheat justice."</p>

<p>When they had gone, she pointed out to the astonished Les
Farman that the steel door from number one hold into the
gymnasium was loose. Les swore that he had made it fast when he
had come through four days previously, and that no one had had
any occasion to use it since.</p>

<p>"In case of accident at sea," he said, "our lives would depend
upon these doors!"</p>

<p>As this door was fastened from the other side we had to mount
to B deck and go forward to reach the stairway into number one
hold. We passed through the pantry and the galley. The cooks,
already busy with the preparation of dinner, glanced at us with
covert curiosity.</p>

<p>"It may have been one of these devils," muttered Les. "Who can
tell where they have their spies?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if it was one of these," answered Mme. Storey. "For
the present I am assuming that the second person who hid in the
swimming-pool was the same individual who sent the instructions
and the poison to Adrian. That letter which Adrian repeated from
memory was written by an educated person. He or she doubted if
Adrian had nerve enough to carry the thing through, and so hid on
the spot to make sure of it."</p>

<p>"Then you think it may have been a woman?"</p>

<p>"I am not eliminating the possibility," she said dryly. "A
woman can do anything a man can do if the incentive is strong
enough."</p>

<p>The stair-well to number one hold was immediately forward of
the galley. Four doors opened off it on B deck; aft the galley
through which we had come; to port the butcher's stores; forward
a storeroom for heavy baggage; and to starboard the crew's mess.
The stairway came down from the well-deck overhead.</p>

<p>"Plenty of routes for our visitor to reach the spot," remarked
Mme. Storey. "We may need a flashlight below."</p>

<p>"I have it," said Les.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey opened the various doors to glance inside. The
butcher's stores&mdash;a small room with a block and tables for
cutting meat. The refrigerator-room opened off it. The floor was
covered with sawdust.</p>

<p>At the foot of the iron stairway there were several locked
doors leading to various storerooms, and aft, the bulkhead door
into the gymnasium. This door was made watertight by a number of
screw-bolts all around it. A T-wrench hung on the wall
alongside.</p>

<p>On the occasion when Les had come through this door, Mme.
Storey whose eyes miss nothing, had noticed by the marks made by
the wrench on the painted heads of the bolts, that it was the
first time this door had been opened. Now she had no difficulty
in showing us, with the aid of her glass, the superimposed marks
of the second opening. Moreover, that morning's visitor had been
in such a hurry to leave he had only given one of the bolts a
turn or two to keep the door from swinging open.</p>

<p>The powerful flashlight revealed no fresh fingerprints on door
or wrench handle. "Wore gloves," said Mme. Storey. "We are
dealing with a cool hand."</p>

<p>"Can I fasten up this door now?" asked Les. "It's
dangerous."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>While Les was so engaged, she continued to search with the
flashlight. With an exclamation of satisfaction, she pounced on a
tiny object at the foot of the stairs. "Burnt match," she said.
"He had to light a match to find the switch. It's a wax match.
Are there such matches in the ship's stores?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Les. "None have been issued."</p>

<p>"It's not likely," said Mme. Storey. "Such matches are not
made in America. While I am going on with my investigation in the
lounge, I want you to undertake a quiet search for the box from
which this match was taken. Search the crew, and search their
effects; search the guests' state-rooms. If you can find that box
of matches we'll send the possessor of it to the chair."</p>

<p>Les left us at the head of the stairs in order to start his
search. Mme. Storey borrowed a key to Adrian's room from him, and
we made our way aft through B deck. We found Adrian lying in his
bunk in a pitiable state. He was the sort of man who was bound to
go to pieces in solitary confinement. At sight of my employer he
sprang up half in terror, half in hope, but she ignored him.</p>

<p>What she was after was the exact position of his porthole. By
measurement it proved to be six feet aft of the bulkhead
separating holds two and three. Proceeding up to A deck, we found
that there was an unoccupied cabin over Adrian's place of
confinement. One of its portholes proved to be immediately over
Adrian's porthole.</p>

<p>"Our plotter would send down his messages from here," said
Mme. Storey. "Much safer than on deck."</p>

<p>Under the porthole there was a couch. Upon examining it, Mme.
Storey smiled. "Look," she said, passing me the glass. "He stood
on the couch in order to get his head and an arm through the
porthole so he could manipulate his string. For some reason
unknown to me, he stepped into the butcher's stores on his way up
from the swimming-pool. Then hastened here to recover the key
from Adrian."</p>

<p>On the upholstered couch I discovered&mdash;a flake or two of
sawdust!</p>

<p>We went on up to the lounge. They were all waiting for us,
divided into the usual suspicious little cliques; Sophie, Celia
and Emil on one side of the room; Adele and Dr. Tanner on the
other; Martin in front of the fireplace, alone and inscrutable.
All eyes flew to Mme. Storey's face to see what they could read
there, but she wasn't giving anything away.</p>

<p>My employer and I sat down behind a table, and I spread open
my note-book. Jim brought Adrian up. Mme. Storey despatched the
old sailor to round up the cooks and waiters. Meanwhile she asked
Adrian a few questions.</p>

<p>"When you returned to your room from the swimming-pool, what
did you do?"</p>

<p>Adrian, always dramatic, struck the back of his hand against
his brow. "I was dazed," he said. "I have no recollection of how
I got back. When I came to myself I was standing there with the
key in my hand. I ran to the porthole, but the string was not
hanging down outside. It was just growing light. I waited for
what seemed like an age, wondering what I would do if Grober
didn't take the key off my hands. I was just making up my mind to
throw it into the sea when the string appeared, with the little
bolt on the end of it. I tied on the key, gave it a twitch, and
it disappeared. That's all."</p>

<p>"You say you waited an age. Can't you give me a better
idea?"</p>

<p>"I was too confused to say exactly. Maybe five minutes. Maybe
more."</p>

<p>"Time enough," said Mme. Storey. "Did you stick your head out
of the porthole to look for the string?"</p>

<p>"The portholes on B deck are too small. I couldn't get my head
out."</p>

<p>"That's all now."</p>

<p>The cooks and stewards were introduced to the lounge one at a
time, and Mme. Storey patiently questioned them without eliciting
anything. They all swore that nobody had passed through the
pantry or the galley except the workers there. Nobody had been
seen going up or down the stairway into number one hold. This
didn't prove anything, because these men had not gone on duty
until six-thirty, and our man had had plenty of time to hide
himself beforehand.</p>

<p>When we came to the butcher he confirmed what we already knew,
but added nothing. The butcher furnished the only moment of
amusement during the whole grim scene. He was a deliberate man
who insisted on relating every detail.</p>

<p>"The chef asked for lamb chops for breakfast, and when I went
to my stores to cut them..."</p>

<p>"What time was this?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"It had just gone six bells, Ma'am. Seven o'clock. I come aft
through the crew's mess, and I seen that the door to my stores
was shut. This struck me as funny, because I keep it hooked back.
There's nothing in there but a block and a table. The
refrigerators is locked. When I put my hand against the door it
resisted me. There was somebody inside. I says: 'Who's there?'
and cussed him out, but there wasn't no answer."</p>

<p>"Did you put your full weight against the door?"</p>

<p>The butcher was a man of well over two hundred pounds. "Not my
full weight," he answered cautiously. "I was scared."</p>

<p>We smiled.</p>

<p>"I went into the galley, and called the cook's helper," the
butcher continued. "He picked up a knife and come back with me.
But the door was open then, and he was gone. Went up the ladder
like a shadow."</p>

<p>"Did you follow him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am. Me and the cook's helper run up on deck, but we
couldn't see anybody. He must have gone through the door into the
corridor on A deck. There's funny things happens aboard this
ship."</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Mme. Storey. "That's all, thank you."</p>

<p>The questioning went on. We were now in northern latitudes,
where the winter days were short. The lights were turned on in
the lounge without anybody noticing it. But some time later Celia
happened to look out of the window and cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh! lights outside! Lights on shore! We're getting in!"</p>

<p>They all ran out on deck. I looked out through the door. Sure
enough, there were the lights of Coney Island like a cluster of
pin-point stars far away to starboard. A great feeling of
thankfulness welled up in my breast. Anything to get off that
murder ship! I think every face showed gladness except Adrian's.
Reaching port spelled fresh terrors for him.</p>

<p>In a little while we dropped anchor off quarantine. Soon
afterwards Mr. McLaren came down to report that he had been in
communication with the health officers, and that no doctor was
available until morning. That meant we must lie where we were.
Faces fell. Mme. Storey went up to the wireless office to send a
message to her attorney announcing our arrival and giving him
certain instructions.</p>

<p>Afterwards the questioning was resumed. During this time it
was impossible for me to keep track of the members of our party.
Sometimes they were in the lounge, sometimes out on deck.
However, they were all present when Les Farman came in.</p>

<p>"Did you have any luck?" Mme. Storey asked him casually.</p>

<p>"No, Madam. I carried out your instructions, but I did not
find what I was looking for."</p>

<p>"Too bad!"</p>

<p>There was a silence. How strange it was to feel the ship lying
so still under one after the incessant throbbing of the engine!
Everybody was looking from Les' face to Mme. Storey's and back
again, tormented with curiosity. Finally my employer said:</p>

<p>"I shall have to ask everybody to submit to a search. Close
the doors, please."</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?" demanded Sophie suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I find it, darling."</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had stuck a cigarette in her mouth, and was
making believe to fumble with her lighter. After several tries
she threw it pettishly on the table. "Confound these things!
Always out of order! Has anybody got an honest to goodness
match?"</p>

<p>My notes end at that point. The question was never answered.
We heard a hollow, muffed boom inside the vessel, and the whole
fabric was violently shaken like a bird-cage on the end of a
spring. We were all thrown to the floor. There was a horrible
series of crashes from pantry and galley; shouts and cries; then
a strange silence. We were too frightened to move. I shall never
forget that picture; chairs, tables, people sprawling
fantastically. We could hear the inrush of water, most terrifying
sound of all.</p>

<p>Les Farman leaped to his feet. His ear told him the location
of the sound. "Number two hold; the swimming-pool!" He started
for the door. Throughout the ship we heard the clang of the
watertight doors on B deck. These could be closed from the
bridge. McLaren was on the job. Les paused in the doorway and
addressed us with an extraordinary smile. His voice was not even
hurried.</p>

<p>"No immediate danger, folks. She'll float for a good while
yet. There's a ship anchored not quarter of a mile from us, and,
anyway, the shore's in sight. Go to your cabins and get warm
clothes. All you can wear. All guests must be on the promenade-
deck, starboard side, in five minutes."</p>

<p>His voice broke the spell that held us. "What has happened?"
somebody screamed at him.</p>

<p>"How can I tell until I go see?" he answered with his good-
natured grin. It was like a tonic. "An explosion of some sort;
bomb; floating mine, perhaps." He disappeared.</p>

<p>We scrambled to our feet and ran this way and that, Sophie and
Adele screeching continuously. Why do women have to act so! One
longed to hit them over the head! Sophie refused to leave the
deck and Celia ran down below to fetch wraps for both.</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; THE END OF THE
"BUCCANEER"</h2>

<p class="first">THERE was a shrill whistle outside, and the
command was given: "All hands on deck! Boat stations!" One heard
running feet all over the ship. Presently, in order to avert the
danger of an explosion, the valves were opened, and the roar of
escaping steam added to the confusion. Through other sounds I
could hear the whine of the wireless. Charlie was sending
fast.</p>

<p>As Mme. Storey and I went down the companionway we met
stewards and other servants running up. Each was carrying a
bundle of some sort. They looked at us coolly. We were all on a
plane of equality now. On A deck Mme. Storey turned aft instead
of forward towards our rooms.</p>

<p>"Come on!" she said.</p>

<p>"But our things!" I protested.</p>

<p>"They can wait," she answered grimly. "It would be too bad to
let a million and a half of diamonds go to the bottom!"</p>

<p>I had completely forgotten the diamonds.</p>

<p>At the after end of the corridor the door was open, and
Beaton, Horace Laghet's valet, was standing there with a quiet
face. "What has happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>"An explosion of some sort," said Mme. Storey. "All hands are
ordered on deck."</p>

<p>"I didn't like to leave my master," said Beaton simply.</p>

<p>Through the open door into the bedroom we could see Horace
lying on his bed. Beaton had performed the last offices for the
dead. Horace was as carefully groomed as in life, even to the
white flower in the buttonhole of his morning-coat. All the
tumult and the shouting signified nothing to that quiet figure.
Mme. Storey said:</p>

<p>"Find the Captain and ask him to detail men to help you carry
your master's body to the boats."</p>

<p>Beaton hastened away.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey pulled open a door in the panelling of the room,
revealing a safe let into the wall behind. She tried the handle.
It was locked. "A man in a hurry instinctively locks a safe by
giving the knob a twist to the right," she murmured. "Perhaps I
can open it."</p>

<p>Kneeling on the floor and holding her ear close to the lock to
listen to the fall of the tumblers, she slowly turned the knob
back. After a couple of false tries, she gave an exclamation of
satisfaction, and smartly grasped the handle. It turned: the door
swung open. But the safe was empty.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Somebody has been before us!"</p>

<p>We met Beaton in the corridor followed by Les Farman and three
sailors carrying a folded stretcher. The stretcher was opened on
the floor and Horace's body laid upon it. "Wait!" said Beaton, as
they were about to pick it up. He fetched a heavy overcoat and
flung it over the body. The sailors grinned at each other; one
said: "He don't need that, mate." But one understood the impulse
that prompted Beaton's act. He and the sailors carried the body
out.</p>

<p>Les said: "An explosion in the swimming-pool. Apparently the
bottom of the vessel was blown out. I can't understand it."</p>

<p>"I can," said Mme. Storey; "a time bomb put there after we had
left the place.</p>

<p>"How could a bomb be manufactured aboard the ship without
somebody's getting on to it?"</p>

<p>"It couldn't be. Must have been brought aboard. All part of
the plot."</p>

<p>"My God!" said Les.</p>

<p>"How long have we got?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There are five compartments," he said. "We only have water in
one. She will float indefinitely&mdash;if the bulkheads hold. As
to that, you can't tell until they're tried."</p>

<p>Les went back on deck, and we hastened to our rooms. The
<i>Buccaneer</i> was down by the head now, and as we went forward
we were running downhill. She felt different underfoot. She had
lost buoyancy. As we passed the forward companionway we could
hear the lap of water below&mdash;a sickening sound!</p>

<p>We snatched up furs and what money and jewels we had; my
employer's strong-box and brief-case, and ran up the two flights
of stairs, to the boat-deck. The interior of the ship was
strangely deserted. As the steam failed the lights were beginning
to dim.</p>

<p>It was bright enough on deck. There was an auxiliary plant run
by a noisy gas engine, and a pair of searchlights on either side
lit up the scene in lurid fashion. Perfect discipline was
displayed. The boats were swung out and lowered flush with the
edge of the deck; two launches and two rowing boats. The entire
ship's company stood waiting for the word to get in.</p>

<p>We met Les Farman.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" asked Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"If she's going to float we may save her," he answered. "I've
wirelessed for tugs. The prisoners, relieved of their irons, were
to go in the port launch in charge of Mr. McLaren. The owner's
launch hung on the other side. Horace, on his stretcher, had
already been carried aboard and laid in the cabin. I saw Sophie
wrapped in several fur coats sitting in a chair that somebody had
brought her, weeping like a child. Emil and Celia stood close
together wrapped in a single big cape. As I passed I heard Emil
say: 'As long as we are together, darling!' My heart warmed
towards them. It must be rather nice to be shipwrecked with your
lover."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey glanced over the owner's group.</p>

<p>"Where's Martin?" she asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Martin? Martin?" they repeated, looking around witlessly.</p>

<p>Les came back to us.</p>

<p>"Martin?" he said. "Isn't he here?"</p>

<p>The two of them went from group to group around the deck,
searching among the faces, and asking for him. He was not there.
Nobody had seen him.</p>

<p>Presently there was a dull report from the interior of the
ship, and she shuddered like a living creature. Les said:
"Forward bulkhead. It's all over now!" Raising his voice, he gave
the command to man the boats. Each of the after boats was under
command of an assistant engineer. The crew climbed aboard in
orderly fashion.</p>

<p>Soon we three were left standing alone on the deck. Three of
the boats started lowering away; the owner's launch waited for
us. From the darkness alongside came a hail: "Do you want
assistance, Captain?" Les turned a searchlight in that direction,
revealing a ship's boat manned by four sailors and an officer.
The water had a strange dusty look in the light.</p>

<p>"Much obliged, Captain," answered Les cheerfully. "Our own
boats are sufficient." To Mme. Storey he said: "I must look for
Coade." She said: "I'll go with you." She told me to get in the
launch, but I paid no attention. I wasn't going to leave her. Les
ordered the men to lower away, and pick us up from the ladder
below. All the boats took the water safely, and cast off.</p>

<p>We ran, for the after companionway. It was dark below, but we
had flashlights. The ship was settling gradually by the head. We
slid forward and had to climb back aft. We ran through the
beautiful rooms on the promenade-deck; lounge, music-room,
library, dining-saloon; already as cold and damp as if the ship
had been deserted for years. We flashed our lights into the
corners, and Les continually shouted Martin's name. The silence
mocked him.</p>

<p>We descended to A deck and ran along, opening the doors of the
various cabins; and casting a light inside. Clothes and personal
belongings of every kind were strewn around the rooms where the
terrified owners had dropped them. "Rich loot here for the old
sea!" muttered Les.</p>

<p>In due course we came to Martin's cabin, which was near
Horace's suite astern. The door was locked. Of all the doors only
that one was locked. Les banged on it with his fist. "Martin!
Martin!" he cried.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey put her ear to the crack of the door and listened.
"He is in there!" she said with a grim face.</p>

<p>"Martin, for God's sake! the ship is sinking!" cried Les,
violently rattling the door.</p>

<p>No sound from inside.</p>

<p>"If you don't unlock it I'll smash it down!"</p>

<p>At last Martin spoke: "Let me alone!" he growled. "My life is
my own to do what I want with!"</p>

<p>Les put his brawny shoulder to the door. It creaked, but did
not give way. At the same moment we heard the crash of a pistol
shot inside the state-room, and a heavy fall on the floor. Les
retreated from the door.</p>

<p>"Break it down!" cried Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>As Les put his shoulder to it again, there was another dull
explosion from amidships, and the stern began to settle. Les
straightened up. "We got to go!" he muttered, "or we'll be caught
like rats!"</p>

<p>"Break down the door first!" she begged.</p>

<p>Les turned obstinate. "No! I'm not going to risk your life!
Come on!" Seizing her wrist, he dragged her away in spite of
herself. I followed.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, divers can recover the diamonds," I said.</p>

<p>Les stared at me. I believe he thought I had lost my wits.</p>

<p>The vessel gave a little shake and heeled gently to starboard.
"Quick!" said Les, "if you don't want a cold bath!"</p>

<p>We ran up the stairs and raced for the ladder. Amidships the
water had risen to A deck. Presently it would be pouring through
the open portholes. The boarding ladder was half-submerged, and
we had to climb over the handrail and drop into the launch as
they brought her alongside. Celia's sympathetic voice said:</p>

<p>"Ah! you didn't find him! Poor, poor Martin!"</p>

<p>"Quick! Throw in your clutch! Get out of the suction!" cried
Les to the engineer.</p>

<p>We lay to a couple of hundred yards away to see the last of
the <i>Buccaneer</i>. She was going fast. The beautiful bold
creature's pride was lowered. How brief had been her career! The
gas engine was still noisily phutting on the boat-deck, and the
search-lights blazed, casting weird shadows. This engine supplied
power to the wireless also, and we heard it whining. Charlie was
beside me. He said:</p>

<p>"That's for us." After listening a moment, he added: "The tugs
are on the way.</p>

<p>"Too late!" said Les.</p>

<p>She dipped her nose, and her propellers rose out of the water.
We thought she was gone, but she righted herself and rolled
lazily. The water was lapping the promenade-deck. Then suddenly,
as if a hand had seized her from below, she was drawn in swiftly
and smoothly, bow first. She gave a long sigh as she disappeared,
no other sound. One moment she was there with her searchlights
blazing, next moment the sea was empty and dark.</p>

<p>Gone! with her rare tapestries and rugs, her gold-plated
bathrooms, her exquisite crystal and silver; gone to rot on the
floor of the sea! It had taken a year and millions of dollars to
produce her and she had cruised for two weeks without doing
anybody any good. What a tragic waste!</p> <hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE
UNEXPECTED</h2>

<p class="first">WE headed the launch for the steamship riding at
anchor nearby. This was the <i>Kingsley</i>, a British freighter
bound in from Trinidad with a cargo of asphalt. Our other boats
had already reached her. The only way of getting aboard was by a
dangling rope-ladder with wooden cross-pieces. Mme. Storey urged
us briskly to mount it. She had her feelings under strict
control, but it was clear that she was driven by the necessity of
haste. The exasperating Sophie declined to mount the ladder, but
later changed her mind when she saw she was likely to be left
alone on the launch with the corpse.</p>

<p>Quarters aboard the freighter were plain, but we were received
with great kindness. While a sling was being devised to hoist the
body aboard, Mme. Storey went off to the wireless cabin to send a
message to her friend, Inspector Rumsey, who was then chief of
the detective bureau of the New York police.</p>

<p>"Have you plenty of gasoline aboard the launch?" she asked
Les.</p>

<p>"The tanks are full."</p>

<p>"Good! We'll need it to-night. As soon as you get the body
off, go aboard with two men you can depend on, and be ready to
start when I come down. Bella, you'll go with us."</p>

<p>Quarter of an hour later we set off again in the speedy
launch. Beyond the fact that we were bound for town, Mme. Storey
would tell us nothing of her plans. She never will do so when she
is in doubt as to the outcome. She anxiously measured our speed
through the water.</p>

<p>"Are you giving her all she'll take, Les?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Every notch!"</p>

<p>"What is she good for?"</p>

<p>"About twenty miles an hour."</p>

<p>It was a still, raw, starless night, black as the inside of a
hat. The wide, empty spaces of the lower bay surrounded us. We
headed for the far-away Narrows, marked by clusters of lights
denoting Fort Wadsworth on one side and Fort Hamilton on the
other.</p>

<p>"If you see anything coming out, give it a wide berth," said
Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Fresh from the tropics, we shivered under our furs. We could
have taken shelter in the cabin, but it was impossible to sit
there staring at nothing. We remained in the cockpit trying to
pierce the darkness with our eyes. I was wondering what we were
in such a hurry about.</p>

<p>Just before we reached the Narrows we saw two speedy tugs
hastening to the aid of the <i>Buccaneer</i> which was already
lying on the bottom of the bay, but they didn't know it. We put
out our lights and gave them a wide berth to port. After passing
the Narrows we saw another and a speedier craft bound out. This
was evidently a police boat summoned by Mme. Storey's message. We
kept out of her way.</p>

<p>In the upper bay, with myriads of tiny lights all around us
and the Staten Island ferries passing back and forth, I had the
feeling that we had returned to civilisation, and something of
the weight of dread was lifted from me. This was the place I
knew. We passed Liberty on one side gayly bedizened in her flood-
lights, and Governor's Island on the other with its long rows of
barracks.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" asked Les.</p>

<p>"Pier A North River," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"The police pier?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Inspector Rumsey will be waiting for us. You had
better come with us. The police will take care of the launch and
lodge the two men."</p>

<p>We were now close under the towering cliffs of the New York
office buildings pointed with lights here and there. Off to our
right were the lovely springing arcs of light formed by the
suspension bridges. The water is always rough off the Battery,
churned by the meeting tides and passing vessels.</p>

<p>As we drew alongside Pier A, I saw the doughty little figure
of Inspector Rumsey waiting in one of the openings, dressed in
plain clothes. The sight gave me great satisfaction. There's
nothing of the spectacular sleuth about Rumsey, but he's a tower
of strength. When he grasped Mme. Storey's hand, she said:</p>

<p>"Have you got a car here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and a motor-cycle escort."</p>

<p>"Good! Let's go. I'll tell you the whole story on the way up-
town."</p>

<p>"This is a most irregular landing," said Rumsey, grinning.
"You haven't been passed by the customs and the immigration
inspectors!"</p>

<p>The launch and the two men aboard her were handed over to the
good offices of the police. As Rumsey was accompanied by his
secretary and a couple of plain-clothes men, there was not room
for all of us in the one car. Les and I were put in a taxicab and
told to follow the police.</p>

<p>We set off up West Street with our shrieking escort. A mad
ride, fifty miles an hour, or better, I should say, with the
sirens going continuously. Traffic lights meant nothing to us. It
was funny to see the other cars scuttling for the curb, but my
heart was in my mouth the whole way. Suppose something had popped
out of one of the side streets. The driver of our taxi was
delighted.</p>

<p>"Cheese! It's the first chance I could ever let her out!" he
said, and waved his hand to the various patrolmen on post as we
flashed by.</p>

<p>Up West Street to the elevated highway, past all the new
piers, "Death" Avenue with its railway tracks, Eleventh Avenue,
the viaduct again, and Riverside drive without slackening speed
for a moment. Finally we drew up alongside the curb just above
the Soldiers and Sailors monument, and our deafened ears had a
chance to recover.</p>

<p>The police car and the motor-cycle cops were dismissed here.
Inspector Rumsey and Mme. Storey came back and joined us in the
taxi and we drove on. I understood that we didn't want to give
warning of our approach. We drove a couple of blocks farther and
turned east towards Broadway. Not until we drew up before a big
apartment house and I read the name over the door, the Greycourt,
did I learn where we were going. This was the address of Mrs.
Martin Coade.</p>

<p>Her apartment was on the third floor. The door was opened to
us by a fair, pale, beautiful young woman, whom we instantly
recognised as the original of the photograph Martin had shown us.
There was obviously a great power of feeling in her, and I
foresaw that my employer had a difficult task before her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Coade?" she said.</p>

<p>"That is my name," was the wondering answer. "What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>"I am Madame Storey."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes widened, and her face became paler still. Her
hand stole to her breast.</p>

<p>"You have heard of me?" said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>"Yes," she stammered, "but I thought...I read in the
papers..."</p>

<p>"That I was one of the party on Mr. Laghet's yacht," put in my
employer. "It is quite true. We returned unexpectedly to-
night."</p>

<p>An agonised question leaped into the girl's eyes. My husband?
Where is he? What has happened? But she said nothing.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey introduced the rest of us. She suppressed Rumsey's
title, referring to him merely as Mr. Rumsey. "May we come in?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coade mutely set the door wide, and we proceeded through
a short hall into an inviting living-room, lighted with mellow
shaded lamps. One of the most conspicuous objects in the room was
a handsomely framed photograph of Martin with his queer invidious
stare. It gave me the creeps. None of us sat down.</p>

<p>The poor girl could contain herself no longer. "Where is my
husband?" she cried.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey tried to answer her, and could not. She turned
away with a helpless gesture, murmuring: "You tell her, Les."</p>

<p>Les was never the one to refuse a difficult job. He
straightened up and cleared his throat; his face was like wood.
"It's a long story, Miss..."</p>

<p>"Oh, quick! quick!" she begged, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"The yacht was blown up and sunk off quarantine a couple of
hours ago," said Les, "and Martin, unhinged by that or other
things, shot himself in his cabin."</p>

<p>Her mouth opened. She stared at him witlessly, and passed a
vague hand over her face. Then a dreadful low cry broke from her.
She dropped in a chair and covered her face. We all stood around
in exquisite discomfort. It seemed like such a rotten deal that
the poor creature should have none but strangers around her at
such a moment.</p>

<p>Finally she raised her head. "You said...other things," she
gasped. "What else happened? Oh, tell me!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Laghet is dead too," said Les woodenly. "Found murdered
in the swimming-pool this morning."</p>

<p>A sharp cry broke from the girl: "I knew it!" In terror she
instantly clapped the back of her hand over her mouth, but it was
too late, we had all heard it. She broke into a helpless
hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey waited until the fit had exhausted itself. "I am
sorry to have to trouble you at such a painful time," she said
gravely, "but there are certain questions I have to ask you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" cried the girl wildly. "What do I
know?"</p>

<p>"Twice you begged Horace Laghet over the telephone not to
undertake this cruise!"</p>

<p>"No!" she cried in terror. "How do you know that? What makes
you say such a thing? It's not true!"</p>

<p>"I know it by a process of elimination," said Mme. Storey. "It
couldn't have been anybody else but you. And now you have
confirmed it by your cry."</p>

<p>"That's not fair!" cried the girl. "I didn't know what I was
saying!"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," said my employer a little grimly, "it is at
such moments of emotion that the truth comes out."</p>

<p>"I will never admit it!" sobbed the girl. "I will never admit
it!"</p>

<p>"Your husband was a very clever man!" said Mme. Storey
softly.</p>

<p>"I shall tell you nothing!"</p>

<p>"He had an almost uncanny insight into what other people were
thinking. This gave him a power over others. You loved him, but
you were afraid of him, too."</p>

<p>Mrs. Coade only wept.</p>

<p>"Adrian Laghet and Martin were great friends. Adrian was here
all the time..."</p>

<p>"Well, why not? What's the harm in that?"</p>

<p>"No harm, certainly. But Adrian was completely dominated by
Martin. Martin could sway Adrian as he pleased without Adrian's
suspecting it."</p>

<p>"Why do you say such things?" cried the girl. "What are you
getting at?"</p>

<p>"It was certain things that you overheard when Adrian and
Martin talked together that led you to warn Horace Laghet. You
heard talk of murder..."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't torture me!" moaned the girl.</p>

<p>"All of us sympathise with you," said Mme. Storey. "We are
your friends...But the truth must come out!"</p>

<p>Les was looking at the girl in great concern. He could not
stand the sight of a woman's tears. "Why don't you answer Mme.
Storey's questions right out?" he said gruffly. "Martin is gone.
It can't hurt him now."</p>

<p>She gave Les a strange look and her resistance suddenly gave
way. "It's true...It's true!" she murmured brokenly. "Martin was
a devil but I loved him!...Maybe I didn't love him, but he had a
power over me that I couldn't resist!...I struggled against it,
but he could make me do what he wanted...Ever since I married him
I've been like a lost woman! Nobody knows...!"</p>

<p>She was unable to go on for a moment. I was slightly behind
her, making notes of her pitiful statement.</p>

<p>"It's true I suspected something like this might happen," she
went on. "I tried to warn Mr. Laghet, but it didn't do any good.
Ever since you sailed away I've been nearly crazy waiting for
some news..."</p>

<p>"It's true. Adrian used to come here all the time. They talked
about murder. Imaginary murders. It was all supposed to be in
fun. How a clever man could commit a murder and get away with it.
Adrian simply drank it in. He was a weak fool, and he hated his
brother. And Martin kept at him...murder! murder! murder! until
Adrian took fire at the idea. Martin was so clever Adrian never
knew that it was he who had first suggested it!</p>

<p>"And when Adrian had begun to brood on the idea, Martin egged
him on by making believe to raise objections. Martin led him on
to ask questions in such an innocent-seeming way, that Adrian
thought all the time he was pumping Martin! Oh, God, it was
fiendish! I knew Martin. I could see the way things were going. I
only overheard a part of their talk, but it was enough! Martin
was so sure of me he didn't care if I did hear...That's all. I
don't know the details of the plot!"</p>

<p>"Well, there's the situation, Inspector," said Mme. Storey
softly.</p>

<p>"Fiendish!" muttered the Inspector scowling. "She said the
right word!...But if Adrian Laghet killed his brother he'll have
to burn for it just the same. No jury would be influenced by a
plea of murder by suggestion."</p>

<p>Mme. Storey began.</p>

<p>"<i>If</i> Adrian killed him..."</p>

<p>She got no further. We were all electrified by the sound of a
key in the entrance door of the apartment.</p>

<p>The four of us instinctively drew back through the doorway
into the bedroom which adjoined the little hall. Mrs. Coade
struggled to her feet and stared into the hall like a woman
turned to stone.</p>

<p>The entrance door opened and slammed shut. Martin ran into the
living-room, his wicked face all lighted up with pleasure.
"Miriam!" he cried, embracing her. "How's this for a surprise!"
No sound escaped her. Her body was stiff and unyielding in his
arms. Presently it got to him that there was something wrong.
"What's the matter with you?" he demanded, holding her away from
him.</p>

<p>"Look behind you!" she said hoarsely.</p>

<p>He turned his head and saw us coming out of the bedroom.</p>

<p>His reaction was as lightning&mdash;swift as a wild animal's.
With a bound he was out into the hall again. He didn't stop to
get the entrance door open but ran on to the dining-room. Les
made for the door from the bedroom into the hall to intercept
him, but he was just too late. Les charged after him into the
dining-room. There he all but had his hands on Martin when the
latter slung a chair behind him, and Les crashed over it
helplessly. Martin ran on into the kitchen, and we heard the
service door bang back against the wall. Les picked himself up
cursing helplessly.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Mme. Storey calmly. "Inspector Rumsey
has men on the service stairs."</p>

<p>There was the sound of a brief struggle outside. Presently we
heard the service door slammed shut again, and a brawny plain-
clothes man appeared from the kitchen shoving Martin before him
with a hand twisted in the latter's collar. A second man
followed. Martin's glasses had fallen off, and we seemed to see
him for the first in all his hatefulness. His face was as ugly as
a gnome's.</p>

<p>But he was not afraid. He defied us all. Les towered over him
with clenched fists, but he never flinched. Even then he
attracted me horribly. I understood how Miriam felt. Les with a
groan conquered the desire to smash him and turned away.</p>

<p>We all returned to the living-room. Miriam was sitting there
like a stone woman, only her agonised eyes alive. Martin
instantly opened up on her.</p>

<p>"Keep your mouth shut, understand! Say nothing and they have
nothing on us!"</p>

<p>Her terrified glance told its own tale. Martin cursed her
brutally. "So you <i>have</i> been talking!"</p>

<p>"They told me you were dead!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"You ought to have known me better!" he snarled. "I'm not
going to fluff out like that!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile big Les Farman was staring at him as if he were a
ghost. "I don't understand," he muttered. "I don't
understand!"</p>

<p>"The shot you heard was just a bit of stage play," said Mme.
Storey. "I guessed as much at the time. However, I knew we would
catch him here."</p>

<p>"But how did he escape?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he escaped from the <i>Buccaneer</i> just one minute
after we did."</p>

<p>"He couldn't have swum ashore. It was more than a mile to
shore. The water is cold enough to kill a man at this
season."</p>

<p>"Then he went ashore in a boat."</p>

<p>"There were only four boats and they were all accounted
for."</p>

<p>"He had a boat of his own."</p>

<p>Les stared at her incredulously.</p>

<p>"There are such things as folding boats," said Mme. Storey.
"They roll up in a bundle. No doubt there was such a bundle
amongst all that baggage he brought aboard. When the bundle was
unrolled and set up it would make a perfectly seaworthy boat. All
he had to do was to float it off on the side opposite to where we
were."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" muttered Les, staring at Martin with a
kind of reluctant admiration.</p>

<p>"Search him!" said Inspector Rumsey.</p>

<p>Under Martin's jacket and his ordinary waistcoat the
detectives discovered a second vest made of chamois cloth. "It's
full of lumps," said one of the searchers.</p>

<p>"Rather valuable lumps," said Mme. Storey dryly. "About a
million and a half dollars worth of diamonds."</p>

<p>Martin was forced to remove the chamois vest. Rumsey slit one
of the seams with his pocket-knife and a couple of glittering
stones rolled out on his palm. A murmur of amazement went
around.</p>

<p>"Go through his pockets," said Mme. Storey.</p>

<p>Amongst the usual objects that a man carries around with him;
handkerchief, fountain pen, wallet, keys, they brought to light a
little pasteboard match box with a gaily decorated cover.</p>

<p>"That's what I want," said Mme. Storey, reaching for the box.
She snapped it open. "Look, Inspector, wax matches. Bought in
Amsterdam. These will send him to the chair!"</p>

<p>We had forgotten Miriam for the moment. We heard a shivering
sigh, and turning, saw that she had fainted in her chair. Les
picked her up with infinite tenderness, and carried her to a
sofa. Martin looked on with an amused sneer. It was just as if he
had said: My way with the women works better, old man! I could
have smacked his ugly face. The worst of it was, it was true!
Martin, ugly and bad as he was, had a fatal attraction for all of
us.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>On the following morning a storm of publicity broke loose in
the press. From the newsgetters' point of view the story had
everything; murdered millionaire, stolen diamonds, a pair of
young lovers to inherit the millions; even the suggestion of
psychic powers in the murderer.</p>

<p>There are always those looking for a chance to get a slam at a
popular favourite, and some of the papers went out of their way
to point out that Mme. Storey's long record of success had met
with a check at last. Horace Laghet had engaged her to protect
him from the plotters, they said, and she had fallen down on the
job.</p>

<p>This was almost more than I could bear. I burned to sit down
and write the truth to the papers; how my employer had accepted
the task under certain definite conditions; how Horace Laghet had
repeatedly broken the conditions; how by his own bull-headedness
he had made it impossible for her to save him. She would not let
me write the letter. Let the charges fall of their own weight,
she said; everything blows over.</p>

<p>All those who had been on the yacht became fair game for the
reporters. Adele Holder and Frank Tanner for reasons of their own
had but little to say; Emil and Celia were bewildered by their
notoriety; only Sophie enjoyed it. Her garrulousness was a vein
of rich ore that they never succeeded in exhausting.</p>

<p>Miriam we spirited away where the reporters could not torment
her. She had made up her mind not to see Martin again, and she
stuck to it. And of course as long as he was locked up he could
not exert his infernal personal influence over her. When the case
finally came to trial neither side would call Miriam to testify;
the prosecution because they would not, and the defence because
they dared not.</p>

<p>Martin somehow was able to engage the most expensive legal
talent in the country. At that he was probably the cleverest man
amongst them. He directed the strategy of his own defence, and it
was masterly. He made a wonderful witness in his own behalf.
Cool, good-humoured, and apparently as open as window-glass, the
prosecutor was unable to catch him out in any important respect.
During the days that he was on the stand, the courtroom was
besieged by thousands of women. It was said that he received a
whole basketful of letters from them daily.</p>

<p>On the other hand the prosecution had not been idle. An
autopsy proved that Horace Laghet's central nervous system had
been paralysed by an injection of a drug with the properties of
curare. Divers were employed to visit the wreck of the
<i>Buccaneer</i>, and the pictures they took under water
established that she had been destroyed by a bomb set off inside
her hull. Of course, Martin's original plan had been to blow her
up in some foreign port, not at the door of his own home
town.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey made a hasty trip to Holland, where, assisted by
the astute M. Joannot she was able to check up on Martin's
movement with deadly accuracy. In addition to complete evidence
as to the gathering together of the diamonds, she was able to
show that Martin had purchased a folding boat, had collected the
materials to make a time-bomb, and had visited a notorious herb
doctor, from whom he might have procured curare. The herb doctor
had disappeared.</p>

<p>Adrian, by the time the trial came on, had made peace with
himself, and was anxious to confess everything. On the stand he
was obviously the ill-balanced neurotic and his tragic story was
very damaging to Martin's case.</p>

<p>Martin was convicted of murder. Afterwards one of the jurors
divulged that he and his fellows had been most influenced by the
implied fact that Miriam had tried to warn Horace of the plot
against him, though evidence that she had done so was not
directly before the jury. If it was not true, why had not the
defence put Miriam on the stand? the jurors asked themselves.
Thus Miriam, even in her absence from the trial, convicted
him.</p>

<p>He went to the chair blinking and unrepentant. There was a
crowd of weeping women outside the prison gates.</p>

<p>Adrian's trial followed that of Martin. He pleaded guilty to a
charge of conspiring to kill, and received a long sentence. I am
told that his health is rapidly failing, and that he will never
live to complete it.</p>

<p>Adele Holder duly received her legacy from the Horace Laghet
estate, and she and Frank Tanner were married. It didn't last
long. Millionaires were Adele's speciality, and she found
another. Tanner received a handsome sum to salve his wounded
affections. He has just enough to live on in a small way without
doing a tap of work, and is becoming fatter and more pop-eyed day
by day.</p>

<p>When the trial was over Mme. Storey, Sophie and I spirited the
young lovers down to Elkton, Maryland, where you can be married
easier than in any place in the U.S.A. In Elkton the ministers
stand out on their front porches, and hold up a finger to passing
motorists. Later on the same day we put the newly-joined pair
aboard an unfashionable ship in Baltimore under assumed names.
The secret was kept until they had sailed away.</p>

<p>I shall never forget their beaming faces when they saw the
little suite we had taken for them.</p>

<p>"Gosh! think of being able to get away by ourselves!" said
Emil. "I reckon I smashed a dozen cameras, but there were always
two more for every one I broke up!"</p>

<p>"But look, Emil," said Celia, very much the little wife, "you
must learn to behave when we have to face the other passengers.
Act as if we had been married for years. Treat me with
indifference. We might quarrel a little."</p>

<p>"Couldn't keep that up," said Emil grinning.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Celia, "when we can't stand it any longer we
can always come down here and be silly."</p>

<p>When they returned from abroad, the question of what to do
with all that money had to be faced. Notwithstanding all Sophie's
pleading and tears, they were determined not to live up to it.
Mme. Storey suggested that after setting aside a sum sufficient
for their needs, the entire fortune should be turned over to a
Horace Laghet Foundation for the relief of need and suffering all
over the country. Emil and Celia hailed the idea with cheers.</p>

<p>Thus Horace Laghet's name is to go down to posterity as one of
the country's benefactors. To those of us who are in the know
there is a pleasing irony in the outcome.</p>

<p>Les Farman showed up so well in this affair that he obtained
the command of a coastwise vessel trading to Florida. Every
second week he spends three days in New York, and is generally to
be found sitting in Miriam's apartment grinning at her with a
mixture of wonder and admiration. It must be a big change after
Martin. I believe she will marry him in the end out of gratitude.
If she does, she will discover that life is not yet over for her.
Les is capable of surprising a woman. A man of gentle nature may
be less exciting than a scoundrel, but he wears better.</p>

<p>Mme. Storey says: "Girls are such fools about men! If they
only knew it, it is the shy men who are the delightful rakes at
heart."</p>
