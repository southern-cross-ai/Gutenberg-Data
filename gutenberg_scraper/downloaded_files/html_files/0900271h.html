  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">GRANT lay on his high white cot and stared at the ceiling.
  Stared at it with loathing. He knew by heart every last minute crack on its
  nice clean surface. He had made maps of the ceiling and gone exploring on
  them; rivers, islands, and continents. He had made guessing games of it and
  discovered hidden objects; faces, birds, and fishes. He had made mathematical
  calculations of it and re-discovered his childhood; theorems, angles,
  triangles. There was practically nothing else he could do but look at it. He
  hated the sight of it.</p>

  <p>He had suggested to The Midget that she might turn his bed round a little
  so that he could have a new patch of ceiling to explore. But it seemed that
  that would spoil the symmetry of the room, and in hospitals symmetry ranked
  just a short head behind cleanliness and a whole length in front of
  Godliness. Anything out of the parallel was hospital profanity. Why didn't he
  read? she asked. Why didn't he go on reading some of those expensive
  brand-new novels that his friends kept on bringing him.</p>

  <p>'There are far too many people born into the world, and far too many words
  written. Millions and millions of them pouring from the presses every minute.
  It's a horrible thought.'</p>

  <p>'You sound constipated,' said The Midget.</p>

  <p>The Midget was Nurse Ingham, and she was in sober fact a very nice
  five-feet two, with everything in just proportion. Grant called her The
  Midget to compensate himself for being bossed around by a piece of Dresden
  china which he could pick up in one hand. When he was on his feet, that is to
  say. It was not only that she told him what he might or might not do, but she
  dealt with his six-feet-odd with an off-hand ease that Grant found
  humiliating. Weights meant nothing, apparently, to The Midget. She tossed
  mattresses around with the absent-minded grace of a plate spinner. When she
  was off-duty he was attended to by The Amazon, a goddess with arms like the
  limb of a beech tree. The Amazon was Nurse Darroll, who came from
  Gloucestershire and was homesick each daffodil season. (The Midget came from
  Lytham St Anne's, and there was no daffodil nonsense about her.) She had
  large soft hands and large soft cow's eyes and she always looked very sorry
  for you, but the slightest physical exertion set her breathing like a
  suction-pump. On the whole Grant found it even more humiliating to be treated
  as a dead weight than to be treated as if he was no weight at all.</p>

  <p>Grant was bed-borne, and a charge on The Midget and The Amazon, because he
  had fallen through a trap-door. This, of course, was the absolute in
  humiliation; compared with which the heavings of The Amazon and the light
  slingings of The Midget were a mere corollary. To fall through a trap-door
  was the ultimate in absurdity; pantomimic, bathetic, grotesque. At the moment
  of his disappearance from the normal level of perambulation he had been in
  hot pursuit of Benny Skoll, and the fact that Benny had careered round the
  next corner slap into the arms of Sergeant Williams provided the one small
  crumb of comfort in an intolerable situation.</p>

  <p>Benny was now 'away' for three years, which was very satisfactory for the
  lieges, but Benny would get time off for good behaviour. In hospitals there
  was no time off for good behaviour.</p>

  <p>Grant stopped staring at the ceiling, and slid his eyes sideways at the
  pile of books on his bedside table; the gay expensive pile that The Midget
  had been urging on his attention. The top one, with the pretty picture of
  Valetta in unlikely pink, was Lavinia Fitch's annual account of a blameless
  heroine's tribulations. In view of the representation of the Grand Harbour on
  the cover, the present Valerie or Angela or Cecile or Denise must be a naval
  wife. He had opened the book only to read the kind message that Lavinia had
  written inside.</p>

  <p><i>The Sweat and the Furrow</i> was Silas Weekley being earthy and
  spade-conscious all over seven hundred pages. The situation, to judge from
  the first paragraph, had not materially changed since Silas's last book:
  mother lying-in with her eleventh upstairs, father laid-out after his ninth
  downstairs, eldest son lying to the Government in the cow-shed, eldest
  daughter lying with her lover in the hay-loft, everyone else lying low in the
  barn. The rain dripped from the thatch, and the manure steamed in the midden.
  Silas never omitted the manure. It was not Silas's fault that its steam
  provided the only up-rising element in the picture. If Silas could have
  discovered a brand of steam that steamed downwards, Silas would have
  introduced it.</p>

  <p>Under the harsh shadows and highlights of Silas's jacket was an elegant
  affair of Edwardian curlicues and Baroque nonsense, entitled <i>Bells on Her
  Toes</i>. Which was Rupert Rouge being arch about vice. Rupert Rouge always
  seduced you into laughter for the first three pages. About Page Three you
  noticed that Rupert had learned from that very arch (but of course not
  vicious) creature George Bernard Shaw that the easiest way to sound witty was
  to use that cheap and convenient method, the paradox. After that you could
  see the jokes coming three sentences away.</p>

  <p>The thing with a red gun-flash across a night-green cover was Oscar
  Oakley's latest. Toughs talking out of the corners of their mouths in
  synthetic American that had neither the wit nor the pungency of the real
  thing. Blondes, chromium bars, breakneck chases. Very remarkable bunk.</p>

  <p><i>The Case of the Missing Tin-opener</i>, by John James Mark, had three
  errors of procedure in the first two pages, and had at least provided Grant
  with a pleasant five minutes while he composed an imaginary letter to its
  author.</p>

  <p>He could not remember what the thin blue book at the bottom of the pile
  was. Something earnest and statistical, he thought. Tsetse flies, or
  calories, or sex behaviour, or something.</p>

  <p>Even in that, you knew what to expect on the next page. Did no one, any
  more, no one in all this wide world, change their record now and then? Was
  everyone nowadays thrilled to a formula? Authors today wrote so much to a
  pattern that their public expected it. The public talked about 'a new Silas
  Weekley' or 'a new Lavinia Fitch' exactly as they talked about 'a new brick'
  or 'a new hairbrush'. They never said 'a new book by' whoever it might be.
  Their interest was not in the book but in its newness. They knew quite well
  what the book would be like.</p>

  <p>It might be a good thing, Grant thought as he turned his nauseated gaze
  away from the motley pile, if all the presses of the world were stopped for a
  generation. There ought to be a literary moratorium. Some Superman ought to
  invent a ray that would stop them all simultaneously. Then people wouldn't
  send you a lot of fool nonsense when you were flat on your back, and bossy
  bits of Meissen wouldn't expect you to read them.</p>

  <p>He heard the door open, but did not stir himself to look. He had turned
  his face to the wall, literally and metaphorically.</p>

  <p>He heard someone come across to his bed, and closed his eyes against
  possible conversation. He wanted neither Gloucestershire sympathy nor
  Lancashire briskness just now. In the succeeding pause a faint enticement, a
  nostalgic breath of all the fields of Grasse, teased his nostrils and swam
  about his brain. He savoured it and considered. The Midget smelt of lavender
  dusting powder, and The Amazon of soap and iodoform. What was floating
  expensively about his nostrils was <i>L'Enclos Numéro Cinq</i>. Only one
  person of his acquaintance used L'Enclos Number Five. Marta Hallard.</p>

  <p>He opened an eye and squinted up at her. She had evidently bent over to
  see if he was asleep, and was now standing in an irresolute way&mdash;if
  anything Marta did could be said to be irresolute&mdash;with her attention on
  the heap of all too obviously virgin publications on the table. In one arm
  she was carrying two new books, and in the other a great sheaf of white
  lilac. He wondered whether she had chosen white lilac because it was her idea
  of the proper floral offering for winter (it adorned her dressing-room at the
  theatre from December to March), or whether she had taken it because it would
  not detract from her black-and-white chic. She was wearing a new hat and her
  usual pearls; the pearls which he had once been the means of recovering for
  her. She looked very handsome, very Parisian, and blessedly
  unhospital-like.</p>

  <p>'Did I waken you, Alan?'</p>

  <p>'No. I wasn't asleep.'</p>

  <p>'I seem to be bringing the proverbial coals,' she said, dropping the two
  books alongside their despised brethren. 'I hope you will find these more
  interesting than you seem to have found that lot. Didn't you even try a
  little teensy taste of our Lavinia?'</p>

  <p>'I can't read anything.'</p>

  <p>'Are you in pain?'</p>

  <p>'Agony. But it's neither my leg nor my back.'</p>

  <p>'What then?'</p>

  <p>'It's what my cousin Laura calls "the prickles of boredom."'</p>

  <p>'Poor Alan. And how right your Laura is.' She picked a bunch of narcissi
  out of a glass that was much too large for them, dropped them with one of her
  best gestures into the washbasin, and proceeded to substitute the lilac. 'One
  would expect boredom to be a great yawning emotion, but it isn't, of course.
  It's a small niggling thing.'</p>

  <p>'Small nothing. Niggling nothing. It's like being beaten with
  nettles.'</p>

  <p>'Why don't you take up something?'</p>

  <p>'Improve the shining hour?'</p>

  <p>'Improve your mind. To say nothing of your soul and your temper. You might
  study one of the philosophies. Yoga, or something like that. But I suppose an
  analytical mind is not the best kind to bring to the consideration of the
  abstract.'</p>

  <p>'I did think of going back to algebra. I have an idea that I never did
  algebra justice, at school. But I've done so much geometry on that damned
  ceiling that I'm a little off mathematics.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose it is no use suggesting jigsaws to someone in your
  position. How about cross-words? I could get you a book of them, if you
  like.'</p>

  <p>'God forbid.'</p>

  <p>'You could invent them, of course. I have heard that that is more fun than
  solving them.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps. But a dictionary weighs several pounds. Besides, I always did
  hate looking up something in a reference book.'</p>

  <p>'Do you play chess? I don't remember. How about chess problems? White to
  play and mate in three moves, or something like that.'</p>

  <p>'My only interest in chess is pictorial.'</p>

  <p>'Pictorially?'</p>

  <p>'Very decorative things, knights and pawns and what-not. Very
  elegant.'</p>

  <p>'Charming. I <i>could</i> bring you along a set to play with. All right,
  no chess. You could do some academic investigating. That's a sort of
  mathematics. Finding a solution to an unsolved problem.'</p>

  <p>'Crime, you mean? I know all the case-histories by heart. And there is
  nothing more that can be done about any of them. Certainly not by someone who
  is flat on his back.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't mean something out of the files at the Yard. I meant something
  more&mdash;what's the word?&mdash;something classic. Something that has puzzled the
  world for ages.'</p>

  <p>'As what, for instance?'</p>

  <p>'Say, the casket letters.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>not</i> Mary Queen of Scots!'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' asked Marta, who like all actresses saw Mary Stuart through a
  haze of white veils.</p>

  <p>'I could be interested in a bad woman but never in a silly one.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Silly?</i>' said Marta in her best lower-register Electra voice.</p>

  <p>'<i>Very</i> silly.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Alan, how can you!'</p>

  <p>'If she had worn another kind of headdress no one would ever have bothered
  about her. It's that cap that seduces people.'</p>

  <p>'You think she would have loved less greatly in a sun-bonnet?'</p>

  <p>'She never loved greatly at all, in any kind of bonnet.'</p>

  <p>Marta looked as scandalised as a lifetime in the theatre and an hour of
  careful make-up allowed her to.</p>

  <p>'Why do you think that?'</p>

  <p>'Mary Stuart was six feet tall. Nearly all outsize women are cold. Ask any
  doctor.'</p>

  <p>And as he said it he wondered why, in all the years since Marta had first
  adopted him as a spare escort when she needed one, it had not occurred to him
  to wonder whether her notorious level-headedness about men had something to
  do with her inches. But Marta had not drawn any parallels; her mind was still
  on her favourite Queen.</p>

  <p>'At least she was a martyr. You'll have to allow her that.'</p>

  <p>'Martyr to what?'</p>

  <p>'Her religion.'</p>

  <p>'The only thing she was a martyr to was rheumatism. She married Darnley
  without the Pope's dispensation, and Bothwell by Protestant rites.'</p>

  <p>'In a moment you'll be telling me she wasn't a prisoner!'</p>

  <p>'The trouble with you is that you think of her in a little room at the top
  of a castle, with bars on the window and a faithful old attendant to share
  her prayers with her. In actual fact she had a personal household of sixty
  persons. She complained bitterly when it was reduced to a beggarly thirty,
  and nearly died of chagrin when it was reduced to two male secretaries,
  several women, an embroiderer, and a cook or two. And Elizabeth had to pay
  for all that out of her own purse. For twenty years she paid, and for twenty
  years Mary Stuart hawked the crown of Scotland round Europe to anyone who
  would start a revolution and put her back on the throne that she had lost;
  or, alternatively, on the one Elizabeth was sitting on.'</p>

  <p>He looked at Marta and found that she was smiling.</p>

  <p>'Are they a little better now?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Are what better?'</p>

  <p>'The prickles.'</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>'Yes. For a whole minute I had forgotten about them. That is at least one
  good thing to be put down to Mary Stuart's account!'</p>

  <p>'How do you know so much about Mary?'</p>

  <p>'I did an essay about her in my last year at school.'</p>

  <p>'And didn't like her, I take it.'</p>

  <p>'Didn't like what I found out about her.'</p>

  <p>'You don't think her tragic, then.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, very. But not tragic in any of the ways that popular belief
  makes her tragic. Her tragedy was that she was born a Queen with the outlook
  of a suburban housewife. Scoring off Mrs Tudor in the next street is harmless
  and amusing; it may lead you into unwarrantable indulgence in hire-purchase,
  but it affects only yourself. When you use the same technique on kingdoms the
  result is disastrous. If you are willing to put a country of ten million
  people in pawn in order to score off a royal rival, then you end by being a
  friendless failure.' He lay thinking about it for a little. 'She would have
  been a wild success as a mistress at a girls' school.'</p>

  <p>'Beast!'</p>

  <p>'I meant it nicely. The staff would have liked her, and all the little
  girls would have adored her. That is what I meant about her being
  tragic.'</p>

  <p>'Ah well. No casket letters, it seems. What else is there? The Man In The
  Iron Mask.'</p>

  <p>'I can't remember who that was, but I couldn't be interested in anyone who
  was being coy behind some tinplate. I couldn't be interested in anyone at all
  unless I could see his face.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes. I forgot your passion for faces. The Borgias had wonderful
  faces. I should think they would provide a little mystery or two for you to
  dabble in if you looked them up. Or there was Perkin Warbeck, of course.
  Imposture is always fascinating. Was he or wasn't he. A lovely game. The
  balance can never come down wholly on one side or the other. You push it over
  and up it comes again, like one of those weighted toys.'</p>

  <p>The door opened and Mrs Tinker's homely face appeared in the aperture
  surmounted by her still more homely and historic hat. Mrs Tinker had worn the
  same hat since first she began to 'do' for Grant, and he could not imagine
  her in any other. That she did possess another one he knew, because it went
  with something that she referred to as 'me blue'. Her 'blue' was an
  occasional affair, in both senses, and never appeared at 19 Tenby Court. It
  was worn with a ritualistic awareness, and having been worn it was used in
  the event as a yardstick by which to judge the proceedings. ('Did you enjoy
  it, Tink? What was it like?' 'Not worth putting on me blue for.') She had
  worn it to Princess Elizabeth's wedding, and to various other royal
  functions, and had indeed figured in it for two flashing seconds in a
  newsreel shot of the Duchess of Kent cutting a ribbon, but to Grant it was a
  mere report; a criterion of the social worth of an occasion. A thing was or
  was not worth putting on 'me blue' for.</p>

  <p>'I 'eard you 'ad a visitor,' said Mrs Tinker, 'and I was all set to go
  away again when I thought the voice sounded familiar like, and I says to
  meself: "It's only Miss Hallard," I says, so I come in.'</p>

  <p>She was carrying various paper bags and a small tight bunch of anemones.
  She greeted Marta as woman to woman, having been in her time a dresser and
  having therefore no exaggerated reverence for the goddesses of the theatre
  world, and looked askance at the beautiful arrangement of lilac sprays that
  had blossomed under Marta's ministrations. Marta did not see the glance but
  she saw the little bunch of anemones and took over the situation as if it
  were something already rehearsed.</p>

  <p>'I squander my vagabond's hire on white lilac for you, and then Mrs Tinker
  puts my nose out of joint by bringing you the Lilies Of The Field.'</p>

  <p>'Lilies?' said Mrs Tinker, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>'Those are the Solomon in all his glory things. The ones that toiled not
  neither did they spin.'</p>

  <p>Mrs Tinker went to church only for weddings and christenings, but she
  belonged to a generation that had been sent to Sunday school. She looked with
  a new interest at the little handful of glory incased by her woollen
  glove.</p>

  <p>'Well, now. I never knew that. Makes more sense that way, don't it. I
  always pictured them arums. Fields and fields of arums. Awful expensive, you
  know, but a bit depressing. So they was coloured? Well, why can't they say
  so? What do they have to call them lilies for!'</p>

  <p>And they went on to talk about translation, and how misleading Holy Writ
  could be ('I always wondered what bread on the waters was', Mrs Tinker said)
  and the awkward moment was over.</p>

  <p>While they were still busy with the Bible, The Midget came in with extra
  flower vases. Grant noticed that the vases were designed to hold white lilac
  and not anemones. They were tribute to Marta; a passport to further
  communing. But Marta never bothered about women unless she had an immediate
  use for them; her tact with Mrs Tinker had been mere <i>savoir faire</i>; a
  conditioned reflex. So The Midget was reduced to being functional instead of
  social. She collected the discarded narcissi from the washbasin and meekly
  put them back into a vase. The Midget being meek was the most beautiful sight
  that had gladdened Grant's eyes for a long time.</p>

  <p>'Well,' Marta said, having finished her arrangement of the lilac and
  placed the result where he could see it, 'I shall leave Mrs Tinker to feed
  you all the titbits out of those paper bags. It couldn't be, could it, Mrs
  Tinker darling, that one of those bags contains any of your wonderful
  bachelor's buttons?'</p>

  <p>Mrs Tinker glowed.</p>

  <p>'You'd like one or two maybe? Fresh outa me oven?'</p>

  <p>'Well, of course I shall have to do penance for it afterwards those little
  rich cakes are death on the waist but just give me a couple to put in my bag
  for my tea at the theatre.'</p>

  <p>She chose two with a flattering deliberation ('I like them a little brown
  at the edges'), dropped them into her handbag, and said: 'Well, au revoir,
  Alan. I shall look in, in a day or two, and start you on a sock. There is
  nothing so soothing, I understand, as knitting. Isn't that so, nurse?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. A lot of my gentlemen patients take to knitting.
  They find it whiles away the time very nicely.'</p>

  <p>Marta blew him a kiss from the door and was gone, followed by the
  respectful Midget.</p>

  <p>'I'd be surprised if that hussy is any better than she ought to be,' Mrs
  Tinker said, beginning to open the paper bags. She was not referring to
  Marta.</p>

  <p class="first">BUT when Marta came back two days later it was not with
  knitting needles and wool. She breezed in, very dashing in a Cossack hat worn
  at a casual rake that must have taken her several minutes at her mirror, just
  after lunch.</p>

  <p>'I haven't come to stay, my dear. I'm on my way to the theatre. It's
  matinée day, God help me. Tea trays and morons. And we've all got to the
  frightful stage when the lines have ceased to have any meaning at all for us.
  I don't think this play is ever coming off. It's going to be like those New
  York ones that run by the decade instead of by the year. It's too
  frightening. One's mind just won't stay on the thing. Geoffrey dried up in
  the middle of the second act last night. His eyes nearly popped out of his
  head. I thought for a moment he was having a stroke. He said afterwards that
  he had no recollection of anything that happened between his entrance and the
  point where he came to and found himself half-way through the act.'</p>

  <p>'A black-out, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'No. Oh, no. Just being an automaton. Saying the lines and doing the
  business and thinking of something else all the time.'</p>

  <p>'If all reports are true that's no unusual matter where actors are
  concerned.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, in moderation, no. Johnny Garson can tell you how much paper there is
  in the house while he is sobbing his heart out on someone's lap. But that's
  different from being "away" for half an act. Do you realise that Geoffrey had
  turned his son out of the house, quarrelled with his mistress, and accused
  his wife of having an affaire with his best friend all without being aware of
  it?'</p>

  <p>'What was he aware of?'</p>

  <p>'He says he had decided to lease his Park Lane flat to Dolly Dacre and buy
  that Charles The Second house at Richmond that the Latimers are giving up
  because he has got that Governor's appointment. He had thought about the lack
  of bathrooms and decided that the little upstairs room with the
  eighteenth-century Chinese paper would make a very good one. They could
  remove the beautiful paper and use it to decorate that dull little room
  downstairs at the back. It's full of Victorian panelling, the dull little
  room. He had also reviewed the drainage, wondered if he had enough money to
  take the old tiling off and replace it, and speculated as to what kind of
  cooking range they had in the kitchen. He had just decided to get rid of the
  shrubbery at the gate when he found himself face to face with me, on a stage,
  in the presence of nine hundred and eighty-seven people, in the middle of a
  speech. Do you wonder that his eyes popped. I see that you have managed to
  read at least one of the books I brought you if the rumpled jacket is any
  criterion.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The mountain one. It was a godsend. I lay for hours looking at the
  pictures. Nothing puts things in perspective as quickly as a mountain.'</p>

  <p>'The stars are better, I find.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>no</i>. The stars merely reduce one to the status of an amoeba.
  The stars take the last vestige of human pride, the last spark of confidence,
  from one. But a snow mountain is a nice human-size yard-stick. I lay and
  looked at Everest and thanked God that I wasn't climbing those slopes. A
  hospital bed was a haven of warmth and rest and security by comparison, and
  The Midget and The Amazon two of the highest achievements of
  civilisation.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, well, here are some more pictures for you.'</p>

  <p>Marta up-ended the quarto envelope she was carrying, and spilled a
  collection of paper sheets over his chest.</p>

  <p>'What is this?'</p>

  <p>'Faces,' said Marta, delightedly. 'Dozens of faces for you. Men, women,
  and children. All sorts, conditions, and sizes.'</p>

  <p>He picked a sheet off his chest and looked at it. It was an engraving of a
  fifteenth-century portrait. A woman.</p>

  <p>'Who is this?'</p>

  <p>'Lucrezia Borgia. Isn't she a duck.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps, but are you suggesting that there was any mystery about
  her?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. No one has ever decided whether she was her brother's tool or
  his accomplice.'</p>

  <p>He discarded Lucrezia, and picked up a second sheet. This proved to be the
  portrait of a small boy in late-eighteenth-century clothes, and under it in
  faint capitals was printed the words: Louis XVII.</p>

  <p>'Now there's a <i>beautiful</i> mystery for you,' Marta said. 'The
  Dauphin. Did he escape or did he die in captivity?'</p>

  <p>'Where did you get all these?'</p>

  <p>'I routed James out of his cubby-hole at the Victoria and Albert, and made
  him take me to a print shop. I knew he would know about that sort of thing,
  and I'm sure he has nothing to interest him at the V. and A.'</p>

  <p>It was so like Marta to take it for granted that a Civil Servant, because
  he happened also to be a playwright and an authority on portraits, should be
  willing to leave his work and delve about in print shops for her
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>He turned up the photograph of an Elizabethan portrait. A man in velvet
  and pearls. He turned the back to see who this might be and found that it was
  the Earl of Leicester.</p>

  <p>'So that is Elizabeth's Robin,' he said. 'I don't think I ever saw a
  portrait of him before.'</p>

  <p>Marta looked down on the virile fleshy face and said: 'It occurs to me for
  the first time that one of the major tragedies of history is that the best
  painters didn't paint you till you were past your best. Robin must have been
  quite a man. They say Henry the Eighth was dazzling as a young man, but what
  is he now? Something on a playing card. Nowadays, we know what Tennyson was
  like before he grew that frightful beard. I must fly. I'm late as it is. I've
  been lunching at the Blague, and so many people came up to talk that I
  couldn't get away as early as I meant to.'</p>

  <p>'I hope your host was impressed,' Grant said, with a glance at the
  hat.</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. She knows about hats. She took one look and said "Jacques Tous,
  I take it".'</p>

  <p>'She!' said Grant surprised.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Madeleine March. And it was I who was giving her luncheon. Don't
  look so astonished: it isn't tactful. I'm hoping, if you must know, that
  she'll write me that play about Lady Blessington. But there was such a to-ing
  and fro-ing that I had no chance to make any impression on her. However, I
  gave her a wonderful meal. Which reminds me that Tony Bittmaker was
  entertaining a party of seven. Magnums galore. How do you imagine he keeps
  going?'</p>

  <p>'Lack of evidence,' Grant said, and she laughed and went away.</p>

  <p>In the silence he went back to considering Elizabeth's Robin. What mystery
  was there about Robin?</p>

  <p>Oh, yes. Amy Robsart, of course.</p>

  <p>Well, he wasn't interested in Amy Robsart. He didn't care how she had
  fallen down stairs, or why.</p>

  <p>But he spent a very happy afternoon with the rest of the faces. Long
  before he had entered the Force he had taken a delight in faces, and in his
  years at the Yard that interest had proved both a private entertainment and a
  professional advantage. He had once in his early days dropped in with his
  Superintendent at an identification parade. It was not his case, and they
  were both there on other business, but they lingered in the background and
  watched while a man and a woman, separately, walked down the line of twelve
  nondescript men, looking for the one they hoped to recognise.</p>

  <p>'Which is Chummy, do you know?' the Super had whispered to him.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' Grant had said, 'but I can guess.'</p>

  <p>'You can? Which do you make it?'</p>

  <p>'The third from the left.'</p>

  <p>'What is the charge?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. Don't know anything about it.'</p>

  <p>His chief had cast him an amused glance. But when both the man and the
  woman had failed to identify anyone and had gone away, and the line broke
  into a chattering group, hitching collars and settling ties preparatory to
  going back to the street and the world of everyday from which they had been
  summoned to assist the Law, the one who did not move was the third man from
  the left. The third man from the left waited submissively for his escort and
  was led away to his cell again.</p>

  <p>'Strewth!' the Superintendent had said. 'One chance out of twelve, and you
  made it. That was good going. He picked your man out of the bunch,' he said
  in explanation to the local Inspector.</p>

  <p>'Did you know him?' the Inspector said, a little surprised. 'He's never
  been in trouble before, as far as we know.'</p>

  <p>'No, I never saw him before. I don't even know what the charge is.'</p>

  <p>'Then what made you pick him?'</p>

  <p>Grant had hesitated, analysing for the first time his process of
  selection. It had not been a matter of reasoning. He had not said: 'That
  man's face has this characteristic or that characteristic, therefore he is
  the accused person.' His choice had been almost instinctive; the reason was
  in his subconscious. At last, having delved into his subconscious, he
  blurted: 'He was the only one of the twelve with no lines on his face.'</p>

  <p>They had laughed at that. But Grant, once he had pulled the thing into the
  light, saw how his instinct had worked and recognised the reasoning behind
  it. 'It sounds silly, but it isn't,' he had said. 'The only adult entirely
  without face lines is the idiot.'</p>

  <p>'Freeman's no idiot, take it from me,' the Inspector broke in. 'A very
  wide-awake wide boy he is, believe me.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't mean that. I mean that the idiot is irresponsible. The idiot is
  the standard of irresponsibility. All those twelve men in that parade were
  thirty-ish, but only one had an irresponsible face. So I picked him at
  once.'</p>

  <p>After that it had become a mild joke at the Yard that Grant could 'pick
  them at sight'. And the Assistant Commissioner had once said teasingly:
  'Don't tell me that you believe that there is such a thing as a criminal
  face, Inspector.'</p>

  <p>But Grant had said no, he wasn't as simple as that. 'If there was only one
  kind of crime, sir, it might be possible; but crimes being as wide as human
  nature, if a policeman started to put faces into categories he would be sunk.
  You can tell what the normal run of disreputable women look like by a walk
  down Bond Street any day between five and six, and yet the most notorious
  woman in London looks like a cold saint.'</p>

  <p>'Not so saintly of late; she's drinking too much these days,' the A.C. had
  said, identifying the lady without difficulty; and the conversation had gone
  on to other things.</p>

  <p>But Grant's interest in faces had remained and enlarged until it became a
  conscious study. A matter of case records and comparisons. It was, as he had
  said, not possible to put faces into any kind of category, but it was
  possible to characterise individual faces. In a reprint of a famous trial,
  for instance, where photographs of the principal actors in the case were
  displayed for the public's interest, there was never any doubt as to which
  was the accused and which the judge. Occasionally, one of the counsel might
  on looks have changed places with the prisoner in the dock&mdash;counsel were
  after all a mere cross-section of humanity, as liable to passion and greed as
  the rest of the world, but a judge had a special quality; an integrity and a
  detachment. So, even without a wig, one did not confuse him with the man in
  the dock, who had had neither integrity nor detachment.</p>

  <p>Maria's James, having been dragged from his 'cubby-hole', had evidently
  enjoyed himself, and a fine selection of offenders, or their victims, kept
  Grant entertained until The Midget brought his tea. As he tidied the sheets
  together to put them away in his locker his hand came in contact with one
  that had slipped off his chest and had lain all the afternoon unnoticed on
  the counterpane. He picked it up and looked at it.</p>

  <p>It was the portrait of a man dressed in the velvet cap and slashed doublet
  of the late fifteenth century. A man about thirty-five or thirty-six years
  old, lean and clean shaven. He wore a rich jewelled collar, and was in the
  act of putting a ring on the little finger of his right hand. But he was not
  looking at the ring. He was looking off into space.</p>

  <p>Of all the portraits Grant had seen this afternoon this was the most
  individual. It was as if the artist had striven to put on canvas something
  that his talent was not sufficient to translate into paint. The expression in
  the eyes&mdash;that most arresting and individual expression&mdash;had
  defeated him. So had the mouth: he had not known how to make lips so thin and
  so wide look mobile, so the mouth was wooden and a failure. What he had best
  succeeded in was in the bone structure of the face: the strong cheekbones,
  the hollows below them, the chin too large for strength.</p>

  <p>Grant paused in the act of turning the thing over, to consider the face a
  moment longer. A judge? A soldier? A prince? Someone used to great
  responsibility, and responsible in his authority. Someone too-conscientious.
  A worrier; perhaps a perfectionist. A man at ease in a large design, but
  anxious over details. A candidate for gastric ulcer. Someone, too, who had
  suffered ill-health as a child. He had that incommunicable, that
  indescribable look that childhood suffering leaves behind it; less positive
  than the look on a cripple's face, but as inescapable. This the artist had
  both understood and translated into terms of paint. The slight fullness of
  the lower eyelid, like a child that has slept too heavily; the texture of the
  skin; the old-man look in a young face.</p>

  <p>He turned the portrait over to look for a caption.</p>

  <p>On the back was printed: <i>Richard the Third. From the portrait in the
  National Portrait Gallery. Artist Unknown.</i></p>

  <p>Richard the Third.</p>

  <p>So that was who it was. Richard the Third. Crouchback. The monster of
  nursery stories. The destroyer of innocence. A synonym for villainy.</p>

  <p>He turned the paper over and looked again. Was that what the artist had
  tried to convey when he had painted those eyes? Had what he had seen in those
  eyes been the look of a man haunted?</p>

  <p>He lay a long time looking at that face; at those extraordinary eyes. They
  were long eyes, set close under the brows; the brows slightly drawn in that
  worried, over-conscientious frown. At first glance they appeared to be
  peering; but as one looked one found that they were in fact withdrawn, almost
  absent-minded.</p>

  <p>When The Midget came back for his tray he was still staring at the
  portrait. Nothing like this had come his way for years. It made La Giaconda
  look like a poster.</p>

  <p>The Midget examined his virgin teacup, put a practised hand against the
  teapot's tepid cheek, and pouted. She had better things to do, she conveyed,
  than bring him trays for him to ignore.</p>

  <p>He pushed the portrait at her.</p>

  <p>What did she think of it? If that man were her patient what would be her
  verdict?</p>

  <p>'Liver,' she said crisply, and bore away the tray in heel-tapping protest,
  all starch and blonde curls.</p>

  <p>But the surgeon, strolling in against her draught, kindly and casual, had
  other views. He looked at the portrait, as invited, and said after a moment's
  interested scrutiny:</p>

  <p>'Poliomyelitis.'</p>

  <p>'Infantile paralysis?' Grant said; and remembered all of a sudden that
  Richard III had a withered arm.</p>

  <p>'Who is it?' the surgeon asked.</p>

  <p>'Richard the Third.'</p>

  <p>'Really? That's interesting.'</p>

  <p>'Did you know that he had a withered arm?'</p>

  <p>'Had he? I didn't remember that. I thought he was a hunchback.'</p>

  <p>'So he was.'</p>

  <p>'What I do remember is that he was born with a full set of teeth and ate
  live frogs. Well, my diagnosis seems to be abnormally accurate.'</p>

  <p>'Uncanny. What made you choose polio?'</p>

  <p>'I don't quite know, now that you ask me to be definitive, just the look
  of the face, I suppose. It's the look one sees on the face of a crippled
  child. If he was born hunchbacked that probably accounts for it and not
  polio. I notice the artist has left out the hump.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Court painters have to have a modicum of tact. It wasn't until
  Cromwell that sitters asked for "warts and all".'</p>

  <p>'If you ask me,' the surgeon said, absentmindedly considering the splint
  on Grant's leg, 'Cromwell started that inverted snobbery from which we are
  all suffering today. "I'm a plain man, I am; no nonsense about me." And no
  manners, grace, or generosity, either.' He pinched Grant's toe with detached
  interest. 'It's a raging disease. A horrible perversion. In some parts of the
  States, I understand, it's as much as a man's political life is worth to go
  to some constituencies with his tie tied and his coat on. That's being
  stuffed-shirt. The beau ideal is to be one of the boys. That's looking very
  healthy,' he added, referring to Grant's big toe, and came back of his own
  accord to the portrait lying on the counterpane.</p>

  <p>'Interesting,' he said, 'that about the polio. Perhaps it really was
  polio, and that accounts for the shrunken arm.' He went on considering it,
  making no movement to go. 'Interesting, anyhow. Portrait of a murderer. Does
  he run to type, would you say?'</p>

  <p>'There isn't a murder type. People murder for too many different reasons.
  But I can't remember any murderer, either in my own experience, or in
  case-histories, who resembled him.'</p>

  <p>'Of course he was <i>hors concours</i> in his class, wasn't he. He couldn't have
  known the meaning of scruple.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'I once saw Olivier play him. The most dazzling exhibition of sheer evil,
  it was. Always on the verge of toppling over into the grotesque, and never
  doing it.'</p>

  <p>'When I showed you the portrait,' Grant said, 'before you knew who it was,
  did you think of villainy?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said the surgeon, 'no, I thought of illness.'</p>

  <p>'It's odd, isn't it. I didn't think of villainy either. And now that I
  know who it is, now that I've read the name on the back, I can't think of it
  as anything but villainous.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose villainy, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Well,
  I'll look in again towards the end of the week. No pain to speak of now?'</p>

  <p>And he went away, kindly and casual as he had come.</p>

  <p>It was only after he had given the portrait further puzzled consideration
  (it piqued him to have mistaken one of the most notorious murderers of all
  time for a judge; to have transferred a subject from the dock to the bench
  was a shocking piece of ineptitude) that it occurred to Grant that the
  portrait had been provided as the illustration to a piece of detection.</p>

  <p>What mystery was there about Richard III?</p>

  <p>And then he remembered. Richard had murdered his two boy nephews, but no
  one knew how. They had merely disappeared. They had disappeared, if he
  remembered rightly, while Richard was away from London. Richard had sent
  someone to do the deed. But the mystery of the children's actual fate had
  never been solved. Two skeletons had turned up&mdash;under some
  stairs?&mdash;in Charles II's day, and had been buried. It was taken for
  granted that the skeletons were the remains of the young princes, but nothing
  had ever been proved.</p>

  <p>It was shocking how little history remained with one after a good
  education. All he knew about Richard III was that he was the younger brother
  of Edward IV. That Edward was a blond six-footer with remarkable good looks
  and a still more remarkable way with women; and that Richard was a hunchback
  who usurped the throne on his brother's death in place of the boy heir, and
  arranged the death of that heir and his small brother to save himself any
  further trouble. He also knew that Richard had died at the battle of Bosworth
  yelling for a horse, and that he was the last of his line. The last
  Plantagenet.</p>

  <p>Every schoolboy turned over the final page of Richard III with relief,
  because now at last the Wars of the Roses were over and they could get on to
  the Tudors, who were dull but easy to follow.</p>

  <p>When The Midget came to tidy him up for the night Grant said: 'You don't
  happen to have a history book, by any chance, do you?'</p>

  <p>'A history book? No. What would I be doing with a history book.' It was
  not a question, so Grant did not try to provide an answer. His silence seemed
  to fret her.</p>

  <p>'If you really want a history book,' she said presently, 'you could ask
  Nurse Darroll when she brings your supper. She has all her schoolbooks on a
  shelf in her room and it's quite possible she has a history among them.'</p>

  <p>How like The Amazon to keep her schoolbooks! he thought. She was still
  homesick for school as she was homesick for Gloucestershire every time the
  daffodils bloomed. When she lumbered into the room, bearing his cheese
  pudding and stewed rhubarb, he looked at her with a tolerance that bordered
  on the benevolent. She ceased to be a large female who breathed like a
  suction-pump and became a potential dispenser of delight.</p>

  <p>Oh yes, she had a history book, she said. Indeed, she rather thought that
  she had two. She had kept all her schoolbooks because she had loved
  school.</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Grant's tongue to ask her if she had kept her dolls,
  but he stopped himself in time.</p>

  <p>'And of course I loved history,' she said. 'It was my favourite subject.
  Richard the Lionheart was my hero.'</p>

  <p>'An intolerable bounder,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'Oh, no!' she said, looking wounded.</p>

  <p>'A hyperthyroid type,' Grant said pitilessly. 'Rocketing to and fro about
  the earth like a badly made firework. Are you going off duty now?'</p>

  <p>'Whenever I've finished my trays.'</p>

  <p>'Could you find that book for me tonight?'</p>

  <p>'You're supposed to be going to sleep, not staying awake over history
  books.'</p>

  <p>'I might as well read some history as look at the ceiling which is the
  alternative. Will you get it for me?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think I could go all the way up to the Nurses' Block and back
  again tonight for someone who is rude about the Lionheart.'</p>

  <p>'All right,' he said. 'I'm not the stuff that martyrs are made of. As far
  as I'm concerned Coeur-de-Lion is the pattern of chivalry, the chevalier sans
  peur et sans reproche, a faultless commander and a triple D.S.O. Now will you
  get the book?'</p>

  <p>'It seems to me you've sore need to read a little history,' she said,
  smoothing a mitred sheet-corner with a large admiring hand, 'so I'll bring
  you the book when I come past. I'm going out to the pictures anyhow.'</p>

  <p>It was nearly an hour before she reappeared, immense in a camel-hair coat.
  The room lights had been put out and she materialised into the light of his
  reading-lamp like some kindly genie.</p>

  <p>'I was hoping you'd be asleep,' she said. 'I don't really think you should
  start on these tonight.'</p>

  <p>'If there is anything that is likely to put me to sleep,' he said, 'it
  would be an English history book. So you can hold hands with a clear
  conscience.'</p>

  <p>'I'm going with Nurse Burrows.'</p>

  <p>'You can still hold hands.'</p>

  <p>'I've no patience with you,' she said patiently and faded backwards into
  the gloom.</p>

  <p>She had brought two books.</p>

  <p>One was the kind of history book known as a Historical Reader. It bore the
  same relation to history as Stories from the Bible bears to Holy Writ. Canute
  rebuked his courtiers on the shore, Alfred burned the cakes, Raleigh spread
  his cloak for Elizabeth, Nelson took leave of Hardy in his cabin on the
  Victory, all in nice clear large print and one-sentence paragraphs. To each
  episode went one full-page illustration.</p>

  <p>There was something curiously touching in the fact that The Amazon should
  treasure this childish literature. He turned to the fly-leaf to see if her
  name was there. On the fly-leaf was written:</p>
  <pre>
Ella Darroll,
 Form III
  Newbridge High School
   Newbridge,
    Gloucestershire.
     England
      Europe,
       The World
        The Universe.
</pre>

  <p>This was surrounded by a fine selection of coloured transfers.</p>

  <p>Did all children do that, he wondered? Write their names like that, and
  spend their time in class making transfers. He certainly had. And the sight
  of those squares of bright primitive colour brought back his childhood as
  nothing had for many years. He had forgotten the excitement of transfers.
  That wonderfully satisfying moment when you began the peeling-off and saw
  that it was coming perfectly. The adult world held few such gratifications. A
  clean smacking drive at golf, perhaps, was the nearest. Or the moment when
  your line tightened and you knew that the fish had struck.</p>

  <p>The little book pleased him so much that he went through it at his
  leisure. Solemnly reading each childish story. This, after all, was the
  history that every adult remembered. This was what remained in their minds
  when tonnage and poundage, and ship money, and Laud's Liturgy, and the Rye
  House Plot, and the Triennial Acts, and all the long muddle of schism and
  shindy, treaty and treason, had faded from their consciousness.</p>

  <p>The Richard III story, when he came to it, was called <i>The Princes In
  The Tower</i>, and it seemed that young Ella had found the Princes a poor
  substitute for Coeur-de-Lion, since she had filled every small O throughout
  the tale with neat pencil shading. The two golden-haired boys who played
  together in the sunbeam from the barred window in the accompanying picture
  had each been provided with a pair of anachronistic spectacles, and on the
  blank back of the picture-page someone had been playing Noughts and Crosses.
  As far as young Ella was concerned the Princes were a dead loss.</p>

  <p>And yet it was a sufficiently arresting little story. Macabre enough to
  delight any child's heart. The innocent children; the wicked uncle. The
  classic ingredients in a tale of classic simplicity.</p>

  <p>It had also a moral. It was the perfect cautionary tale.</p>

  <p>But the King won no profit from this wicked deed. The people of England
  were shocked by his cold-blooded cruelty and decided that they would no
  longer have him for King. They sent for a distant cousin of Richard's, Henry
  Tudor, who was living in France, to come and be crowned King in his stead.
  Richard died bravely in the battle which resulted, but he had made his name
  hated throughout the country and many deserted him to fight for his
  rival.</p>

  <p>Well, it was neat but not gaudy. Reporting at its simplest.</p>

  <p>He turned to the second book.</p>

  <p>The second book was the School History proper. The two thousand years of
  England's story were neatly parcelled into compartments for ready reference.
  The compartments, as usual, were reigns. It was no wonder that one pinned a
  personality to a reign, forgetful that that personality had known and lived
  under other kings. One put them in pigeon-holes automatically. Pepys: Charles
  II. Shakespeare: Elizabeth. Marlborough: Queen Anne. It never crossed one's
  mind that someone who had seen Queen Elizabeth could also have seen George I.
  One had been conditioned to the reign idea from childhood.</p>

  <p>However it did simplify things when you were just a policeman with a game
  leg and a concussed spine hunting up some information on dead and gone
  royalties to keep yourself from going crazy.</p>

  <p>He was surprised to find the reign of Richard III so short. To have made
  oneself one of the best-known rulers in all those two thousand years of
  England's history, and to have had only two years to do it in, surely augured
  a towering personality. If Richard had not made friends he had certainly
  influenced people.</p>

  <p>The history book, too, thought that he had personality.</p>

  <p>Richard was a man of great ability, but quite unscrupulous as to his
  means. He boldly claimed the crown on the absurd ground that his brother's
  marriage with Elizabeth Woodville had been illegal and the children of it
  illegitimate. He was accepted by the people who dreaded a minority, and began
  his reign by making a progress through the south, where he was well received.
  During this progress, however, the two young Princes who were living in the
  Tower, disappeared, and were believed to have been murdered. A serious
  rebellion followed, which Richard put down with great ferocity. In order to
  recover some of his lost popularity he held a Parliament, which passed useful
  statutes against Benevolences, Maintenance, and Livery.</p>

  <p>But a second rebellion followed. This took the form of an invasion, with
  French troops, by the head of the Lancaster branch, Henry Tudor. He
  encountered Richard at Bosworth, near Leicester, where the treachery of the
  Stanleys gave the day to Henry. Richard was killed in the battle, fighting
  courageously, leaving behind him a name hardly less infamous than that of
  John.</p>

  <p>What on earth were Benevolences, Maintenance, and Livery?</p>

  <p>And how did the English like having the succession decided for them by
  French troops?</p>

  <p>But, of course, in the days of the Roses, France was still a sort of
  semi-detached part of England; a country much less foreign to an Englishman
  than Ireland was. A fifteenth-century Englishman went to France as a matter
  of course; but to Ireland only under protest.</p>

  <p>He lay and thought about that England. The England over which the Wars of
  the Roses had been fought. A green, green England; with not a chimney-stack
  from Cumberland to Cornwall. An England still unhedged, with great forests
  alive with game, and wide marshes thick with wild-fowl. An England with the
  same small group of dwellings repeated every few miles in endless
  permutation: castle, church, and cottages; monastery, church, and cottages;
  manor, church, and cottages. The strips of cultivation round the cluster of
  dwellings, and beyond that the greenness. The unbroken greenness. The
  deep-rutted lanes that ran from group to group, mired to bog in the winter
  and white with dust in the summer; decorated with wild roses or red with
  hawthorn as the seasons came and went.</p>

  <p>For thirty years, over this green uncrowded land, the Wars of the Roses
  had been fought. But it had been more of a blood feud than a war. A Montague
  and Capulet affair; of no great concern to the average Englishman. No one
  pushed in at your door to demand whether you were York or Lancaster and to
  hale you off to a concentration camp if your answer proved to be the wrong
  one for the occasion. It was a small concentrated war; almost a private
  party. They fought a battle in your lower meadow, and turned your kitchen
  into a dressing-station, and then moved off somewhere or other to fight a
  battle somewhere else, and a few weeks later you would hear what had happened
  at that battle, and you would have a family row about the result because your
  wife was probably Lancaster and you were perhaps York, and it was all rather
  like following rival football teams. No one persecuted you for being a
  Lancastrian or a Yorkist, any more than you would be persecuted for being an
  Arsenal fan or a Chelsea follower.</p>

  <p>He was still thinking of that green England when he fell asleep.</p>

  <p>And he was not a whit wiser about the two young Princes and their
  fate.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">'CAN'T you find something more cheerful to look at than that
  thing?' The Midget asked next morning, referring to the Richard portrait
  which Grant had propped up against the pile of books on his bed-side
  table.</p>

  <p>'You don't find it an interesting face?'</p>

  <p>'Interesting! It gives me the willies. A proper Dismal Desmond.'</p>

  <p>'According to the history books he was a man of great ability.'</p>

  <p>'So was Bluebeard.'</p>

  <p>'And considerable popularity, it would seem.'</p>

  <p>'So was Bluebeard.'</p>

  <p>'A very fine soldier, too,' Grant said wickedly, and waited. 'No Bluebeard
  offers?'</p>

  <p>'What do you want to look at that face for? Who was he anyway?'</p>

  <p>'Richard the Third.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, well, I ask you!'</p>

  <p>'You mean that's what you expected him to look like.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'A murdering brute, wasn't he?'</p>

  <p>'You seem to know your history.'</p>

  <p>'Everyone knows that. Did away with his two little nephews, poor brats.
  Had them smothered.'</p>

  <p>'Smothered?' said Grant, interested. 'I didn't know that.'</p>

  <p>'Smothered with pillows.' She banged his own pillows with a fragile
  vigorous fist, and replaced them with speed and precision.</p>

  <p>'Why smothering? Why not poison?' Grant inquired.</p>

  <p>'Don't ask me. I didn't arrange it.'</p>

  <p>'Who said they were smothered?'</p>

  <p>'My history book at school said it.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but whom was the history book quoting?'</p>

  <p>'Quoting? It wasn't quoting anything. It was just giving facts.'</p>

  <p>'Who smothered them, did it say?'</p>

  <p>'A man called Tyrrel. Didn't you do any history, at school?'</p>

  <p>'I attended history lessons. It is not the same thing. Who was
  Tyrrel?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't the remotest. A friend of Richard's.'</p>

  <p>'How did anyone know it was Tyrrel?'</p>

  <p>'He confessed.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Confessed?</i>'</p>

  <p>'After he had been found guilty, of course. Before he was hanged.'</p>

  <p>'You mean that this Tyrrel was actually hanged for the murder of the two
  Princes?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course. Shall I take that dreary face away and put up something
  gayer? There were quite a lot of nice faces in that bundle Miss Hallard
  brought you yesterday.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not interested in nice faces. I'm interested only in dreary ones; in
  "murdering brutes" who are "men of great ability".'</p>

  <p>'Well, there's no accounting for tastes,' said The Midget inevitably. 'And
  <i>I</i> don't have to look at it, thank goodness. But in my humble
  estimation it's enough to prevent bones knitting, so help me it is.'</p>

  <p>'Well, if my fracture doesn't mend you can put it down to Richard III's
  account. Another little item on that account won't be noticed, it seems to
  me.'</p>

  <p>He must ask Marta when next she looked in if she too knew about this
  Tyrrel. Her general knowledge was not very great, but she had been educated
  very expensively at a highly approved school and perhaps some of it had
  stuck.</p>

  <p>But the first visitor to penetrate from the outside world proved to be
  Sergeant Williams; large and pink and scrubbed-looking; and for a little
  Grant forgot about battles long ago and considered wide boys alive today.
  Williams sat planted on the small hard visitors' chair, his knees apart and
  his pale blue eyes blinking like a contented cat's in the light from the
  window, and Grant regarded him with affection. It was pleasant to talk shop
  again; to use that elliptical, allusive speech that one uses only with
  another of one's trade. It was pleasant to hear the professional gossip, to
  talk professional politics; to learn who was on the mat and who was on the
  skids.</p>

  <p>'The Super sent his regards,' Williams said as he got up to go, 'and said
  if there was anything he could do for you to let him know.' His eyes, no
  longer dazzled by the light, went to the photograph propped against the
  books. He leant his head sideways at it. 'Who's the bloke?'</p>

  <p>Grant was just about to tell him when it occurred to him that here was a
  fellow policeman. A man as used, professionally, to faces as he was himself.
  Someone to whom faces were of daily importance.</p>

  <p>'Portrait of a man by an unknown fifteenth-century painter,' he said.
  'What do you make of it?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know the first thing about painting.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't mean that. I meant what do you make of the subject?'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Oh, I see.' Williams bent forward and drew his bland brows into a
  travesty of concentration. 'How do you mean "make of it"?'</p>

  <p>'Well, where would you place him? In the dock or on the bench?'</p>

  <p>Williams considered for a moment, and then said with confidence: 'Oh, on
  the bench.'</p>

  <p>'You would?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly. Why? Wouldn't you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But the odd thing is that we're both wrong. He belongs in the
  dock.'</p>

  <p>'You surprise me,' Williams said, peering again. 'Do you know who he was,
  then?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Richard the Third.'</p>

  <p>Williams whistled.</p>

  <p>'So that's who it is, is it! Well, well. The Princes in the Tower, and all
  that. The original Wicked Uncle. I suppose, once you know, you can see it,
  but off-hand it wouldn't occur to you. I mean, that he was a crook. He's the
  spit of old Halsbury, come to think of it, and if Halsbury had a fault at all
  it was that he was too soft with the blighters in the dock. He used to lean
  over backwards to give them the benefit in his summing-up.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know how the Princes were murdered?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know a thing about Richard III except that his mother was two
  years conceiving him.'</p>

  <p>'What! Where did you get that tale?'</p>

  <p>'In my school history, I suppose.'</p>

  <p>'You must have gone to a very remarkable school. Conception was not
  mentioned in any history book of mine. That is what made Shakespeare and the
  Bible so refreshing as lessons; the facts of life were always turning up. Did
  you ever hear of a man called Tyrrel?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; he was a con. man on the P &amp; O. boats. Drowned in the
  <i>Egypt</i>.'</p>

  <p>'No; I mean, in history.'</p>

  <p>'I tell you, I never knew any history except 1066 and 1603.'</p>

  <p>'What happened in 1603?' Grant asked, his mind still on Tyrrel.</p>

  <p>'We had the Scots tied to our tails for good.'</p>

  <p>'Better than having them at our throats every five minutes. Tyrrel is said
  to be the man who put the boys out of the way.'</p>

  <p>'The nephews? No, it doesn't ring a bell. Well, I must be getting along.
  Anything I can do for you?'</p>

  <p>'Did you say you were going to Charing Cross Road?'</p>

  <p>'To the Phoenix, yes.'</p>

  <p>'You could do something for me.'</p>

  <p>'What is that?'</p>

  <p>'Go into one of the bookshops and buy me a History of England. An adult
  one. And a Life of Richard III, if you can find one.'</p>

  <p>'Sure, I'll do that.'</p>

  <p>As he was going out he encountered The Amazon, and looked startled to find
  anything as large as himself in nurse's uniform. He murmured a good-morning
  in an abashed way, cast a questioning glance at Grant, and faded into the
  corridor.</p>

  <p>The Amazon said that she was supposed to be giving Number Four her blanket
  bath but that she had to look in to see if he was convinced.</p>

  <p>'Convinced?'</p>

  <p>About the nobility of Richard Coeur-de-Lion.</p>

  <p>'I haven't got round to Richard the First yet. But keep Number Four
  waiting a few moments longer and tell me what you know about Richard
  III.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, those poor lambs!' she said, her great cow's-eyes soft with pity.</p>

  <p>'Who?'</p>

  <p>'Those two precious little boys. It used to be my nightmare when I was a
  kiddy. That someone would come and put a pillow over my face when I was
  asleep.'</p>

  <p>'Is that how it was done: the murder?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. Didn't you know? Sir James Tyrrel rode back to London when the
  court was at Warwick, and told Dighton and Forrest to kill them, and then
  they buried them at the foot of some stairs under a great mound of
  stones.'</p>

  <p>'But it doesn't say that in the book you lent me.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that book is just history-for-exams, if you know what I mean. You
  don't get really interesting history in swot books like that.'</p>

  <p>'And where did you get the juicy gossip about Tyrrel, may one ask?'</p>

  <p>'It isn't gossip,' she said, hurt. 'You'll find it in Sir Thomas More's
  history of his time. And you can't find a more respected or trustworthy
  person in the whole of history than Sir Thomas More, now can you?'</p>

  <p>'No. It would be bad manners to contradict Sir Thomas.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that's what Sir Thomas says, and, after all, he was alive then and
  knew all those people to talk to.'</p>

  <p>'Dighton and Forrest?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. But Richard, and the poor Queen, and those.'</p>

  <p>'The Queen? Richard's Queen?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Why "poor"?'</p>

  <p>'He led her an awful life. They say he poisoned her. He wanted to marry
  his niece.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'Because she was the heir to the throne.'</p>

  <p>'I see. He got rid of the two boys, and then wanted to marry their eldest
  sister.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He couldn't marry either of the boys, you see.'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose even Richard the Third never thought of that one.'</p>

  <p>'So he wanted to marry Elizabeth so as to feel safer on the throne.
  Actually, of course, she married his successor. She was Queen Elizabeth's
  grandmother. It always used to please me that Elizabeth was a little bit
  Plantagenet. I never was very fond of the Tudor side. Now I must go, or
  Matron will be here on her round before I have Number Four tidied up.'</p>

  <p>'That would be the end of the world.'</p>

  <p>'It would be the end of <i>me</i>,' she said, and went away.</p>

  <p>Grant took the book she had lent him off the pile again, and tried to make
  head or tail of the Wars of the Roses. He failed. Armies marched and
  counter-marched. York and Lancaster succeeded each other as victors in a
  bewildering repetition. It was as meaningless as watching a crowd of dodgem
  cars bumping and whirling at a fair.</p>

  <p>But it seemed to him that the whole trouble was implicit, the germ of it
  sown, nearly a hundred years earlier, when the direct line was broken by the
  deposition of Richard II. He knew all about that because he had in his youth
  seen <i>Richard of Bordeaux</i> at the New Theatre; four times he had seen
  it. For three generations the usurping Lancasters had ruled England: Richard
  of Bordeaux's Henry unhappily but with fair efficiency, Shakespeare's Prince
  Hal with Agincourt for glory and the stake for zeal, and his son in
  half-witted muddle and failure. It was no wonder if men hankered after the
  legitimate line again, as they watched poor Henry VI's inept friends
  frittering away the victories in France while Henry nursed his new foundation
  of Eton and besought the ladies at court to cover up their bosoms.</p>

  <p>All three Lancasters had had an unlovely fanaticism which contrasted
  sharply with the liberalism of the Court which had died with Richard II.
  Richard's live-and-let-live methods had given place, almost overnight, to the
  burning of heretics. For three generations heretics had burned. It was no
  wonder if a less public fire of discontent had begun to smoulder in the heart
  of the man in the street.</p>

  <p>Especially since there, before their eyes, was the Duke of York. Able,
  sensible, influential, gifted, a great prince in his own right, and by blood
  the heir of Richard II. They might not desire that York should take the place
  of poor silly Henry, but they did wish that he would take over the running of
  the country and clean up the mess.</p>

  <p>York tried it, and died in battle for his pains, and his family spent much
  time in exile or sanctuary as a result.</p>

  <p>But when the tumult and the shouting was all over, there on the throne of
  England was the son who had fought alongside him in that struggle, and the
  country settled back happily under that tall, flaxen, wenching, exceedingly
  beautiful but most remarkably shrewd young man, Edward IV.</p>

  <p>And that was as near as Grant would ever come to understanding the Wars of
  the Roses.</p>

  <p>He looked up from his book to find Matron standing in the middle of the
  room.</p>

  <p>'I did knock,' she said, 'but you were lost in your book.'</p>

  <p>She stood there, slender and remote; as elegant in her way as Marta was;
  her white-cuffed hands clasped loosely in front of her narrow waist; her
  white veil spreading itself in imperishable dignity; her only ornament the
  small silver badge of her diploma. Grant wondered if there was anywhere in
  this world a more unshakable poise than that achieved by the matron of a
  great hospital.</p>

  <p>'I've taken to history,' he said. 'Rather late in the day.'</p>

  <p>'An admirable choice,' she said. 'It puts things in perspective.' Her eye
  lighted on the portrait and she said: 'Are you York or Lancaster?'</p>

  <p>'So you recognise the portrait.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. When I was a probationer I used to spend a lot of time in the
  National. I had very little money and very sore feet, and it was warm in the
  Gallery and quiet and it had plenty of seats.' She smiled a very little,
  looking back from her present consequence to that young, tired, earnest
  creature that she had been. 'I liked the Portrait Gallery best because it
  gave one the same sense of proportion that reading history does. All those
  Importances who had made such a to-do over so much in their day. All just
  names. Just canvas and paint. I saw a lot of that portrait in those days.'
  Her attention went back to the picture. 'A most unhappy creature,' she
  said.</p>

  <p>'My surgeon thinks it is poliomyelitis.'</p>

  <p>'Polio?' She considered it. 'Perhaps. I hadn't thought of it before. But
  to me it has always seemed to be intense unhappiness. It is the most
  desperately unhappy face that I have ever encountered and I have encountered
  a great many.'</p>

  <p>'You think it was painted later than the murder, then?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. Obviously. He is not a type that would do anything lightly. A
  man of that calibre. He must have been well aware of how heinous the crime
  was.'</p>

  <p>'You think he belonged to the type who can't live with themselves any
  more.'</p>

  <p>'What a good description! Yes. The kind who want something badly, and then
  discover that the price they have paid for it is too high.'</p>

  <p>'So you don't think he was an out-and-out villain?'</p>

  <p>'No; oh, no. Villains don't suffer, and that face is full of the most
  dreadful pain.'</p>

  <p>They considered the portrait in silence for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>'It must have seemed like retribution, you know. Losing his only boy so
  soon after. And his wife's death. Being stripped of his own personal world in
  so short a time. It must have seemed like Divine justice.'</p>

  <p>'Would he care about his wife?'</p>

  <p>'She was his cousin, and they had known each other from childhood. So
  whether he loved her or not, she must have been a companion for him. When you
  sit on a throne I suspect that companionship is a rare blessing. Now I must
  go and see how my hospital is getting on. I have not even asked the question
  that I came to ask. Which was how you felt this morning. But it is a very
  healthy sign that you have interest to spare for a man dead these four
  hundred years.'</p>

  <p>She had not moved from the position in which he had first caught sight of
  her. Now she smiled her faint, withdrawn smile, and with her hands still
  clasped lightly in front of her belt-buckle moved towards the door. She had a
  transcendental repose. Like a nun. Like a queen.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was after luncheon before Sergeant Williams reappeared,
  breathless, bearing two fat volumes.</p>

  <p>'You should have left them with the porter,' Grant said. 'I didn't mean
  you to come sweating up here with them.'</p>

  <p>'I had to come up and explain. I had only time to go to one shop, but it's
  the biggest in the street. That's the best history of England they have in
  stock. It's the best there is anywhere, they say.' He laid down a
  severe-looking sage-green tome, with an air of taking no responsibility for
  it. 'They had no separate history of Richard III. I mean, no life of him. But
  they gave me this.' This was a gay affair with a coat of arms on the wrapper.
  It was called <i>The Rose of Raby</i>.</p>

  <p>'What is this?'</p>

  <p>'She was his mother, it seems. The Rose in question, I mean. I can't wait:
  I'm due at the Yard in five minutes from now and the Super will flay me alive
  if I'm late. Sorry I couldn't do better. I'll look in again, first time I'm
  passing, and if these are no good I'll see what else I can get.'</p>

  <p>Grant was grateful and said so.</p>

  <p>To the sound of Williams' brisk departing footsteps he began his
  inspection of the 'best history of England there is'. It turned out to be
  what is known as a 'constitutional' history; a sober compilation lightened
  with improving illustrations. An illumination from the Luttrell Psalter
  decorated the husbandry of the fourteenth century, and a contemporary map of
  London bisected the Great Fire. Kings and Queens were mentioned only
  incidentally. Tanner's Constitutional History was concerned only with social
  progress and political evolution; with the Black Death, and the invention of
  printing, and the use of gunpowder, and the formation of the Trade Guilds,
  and so forth. But here and there Mr Tanner was forced, by a horrid
  germaneness, to mention a King or his relations. And one such germaneness
  occurred in connection with the invention of printing.</p>

  <p>A man called Caxton came out of the Weald of Kent as draper's apprentice
  to a future Lord Mayor of London, and then went to Bruges with the twenty
  merks his master left him in his will. And when, in the dreary autumn rain of
  the Low Countries, two young refugees from England fetched up on those low
  shores, in very low water, it was the successful merchant from the Weald of
  Kent who gave them succour. The refugees were Edward IV and his brother
  Richard; and when in the turn of the wheel Edward came back to rule England,
  Caxton came too, and the first books printed in England were printed for
  Edward IV and written by Edward's brother-in-law.</p>

  <p>He turned the pages and marvelled how dull information is deprived of
  personality. The sorrows of humanity are no one's sorrows, as newspaper
  readers long ago found out. A frisson of horror may go down one's spine at
  wholesale destruction but one's heart stays unmoved. A thousand people
  drowned in floods in China are news: a solitary child drowned in a pond is
  tragedy. So Mr Tanner's account of the progress of the English race was
  admirable but unexciting. But here and there where he could not avoid the
  personal his narrative flowered into a more immediate interest. In extracts
  from the Pastons' letters, for instance. The Pastons had a habit of
  sandwiching scraps of history between orders for salad oil and inquiries as
  to how Clement was doing at Cambridge. And between two of those domesticities
  appeared the small item that the two little York boys, George, and Richard,
  were living in the Pastons' London lodgings, and that their brother Edward
  came every day to see them.</p>

  <p>Surely, thought Grant, dropping the book for a moment on the counterpane
  and staring up at the now invisible ceiling, surely never before can anyone
  have come to the throne of England with so personal an experience of the
  ordinary man's life as Edward IV and his brother Richard. And perhaps only
  Charles II after them. And Charles, even in poverty and flight, had always
  been a King's son; a man apart. The two little boys who were living in the
  Pastons' lodgings were merely the babies of the York family. Of no particular
  importance at the best of times, and at the moment when the Paston letter was
  written without a home and possibly without a future.</p>

  <p>Grant readied for The Amazon's history book to find out what Edward was
  about in London at that date, and learned that he was collecting an army.
  'London was always Yorkist in temper, and men flocked with enthusiasm to the
  banner of the youthful Edward,' said the history book.</p>

  <p>And yet young Edward, aged eighteen, idol of a capital city and on the way
  to the first of his victories, found time to come every day to see his small
  brothers.</p>

  <p>Was it now, Grant wondered, that the remarkable devotion of Richard to his
  elder brother was born. An unwavering life-long devotion that the history
  books not only did not deny but actually used in order to point the moral.
  'Up to the moment of his brother's death Richard had been in all vicissitudes
  his loyal and faithful helpmeet, but the opportunity of a crown proved too
  much for him.' Or in the simpler words of the Historical Reader: 'He had been
  a good brother to Edward but when he saw that he might become King greed
  hardened his heart.'</p>

  <p>Grant took a sideways look at the portrait and decided that the Historical
  Reader was off the beam. Whatever had hardened Richard's heart to the point
  of murder had not been greed. Or did the Historical Reader mean greed for
  power? Probably. Probably.</p>

  <p>But surely Richard must have had all the power that mortal man could wish.
  He was the King's brother, and rich. Was that short step further so important
  that he could murder his brother's children to achieve it?</p>

  <p>It was an odd set-up altogether.</p>

  <p>He was still mulling it over in his mind when Mrs Tinker came in with
  fresh pyjamas for him and her daily précis of the newspaper headlines. Mrs
  Tinker never read past the third headline of a report unless it happened to
  be a murder, in which case she read every word and bought an evening paper
  for herself on the way home to cook Tinker's supper.</p>

  <p>Today the gentle burble of her comment on a Yorkshire
  arsenic-and-exhumation case flowed over him unbroken until she caught sight
  of the morning paper lying in its virgin condition alongside the books on the
  table. This brought her to a sudden halt.</p>

  <p>'You not feelin' so good today?' she asked in a concerned way.</p>

  <p>'I'm fine, Tink, fine. Why?'</p>

  <p>'You 'aven't as much as opened your paper. That's 'ow my sister's gel
  started her decline. Not takin' no notice of what was in the paper.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you worry. I'm on the up-grade. Even my temper has improved. I
  forgot about the paper because I've been reading history stories. Ever heard
  of the Princes in the Tower?'</p>

  <p>'<i>Everyone's</i> 'eard of the Princes in the Tower.'</p>

  <p>'And do you know how they met their end?'</p>

  <p>'Course I do. He put a pillow on their faces when they was asleep.'</p>

  <p>'Who did?'</p>

  <p>'Their wicked uncle. Richard the Third. You didn't ought to think of
  things like that when you're poorly. You ought to be reading something nice
  and cheerful.'</p>

  <p>'Are you in a hurry to get home, Tink, or could you go round by St
  Martin's Lane for me?'</p>

  <p>'No, I've plenty of time. Is it Miss Hallard? She won't be at the theatre
  till six-about.'</p>

  <p>'No, I know. But you might leave a note for her and she'll get it when she
  comes in.'</p>

  <p>He reached for his scribbling pad and pencil and wrote:</p>

  <p>'For the love of Mike find me a copy of Thomas More's history of Richard
  III.'</p>

  <p>He tore off the page, folded it and scribbled Marta's name on it.</p>

  <p>'You can give it to old Saxton at the stage-door. He'll see that she gets
  it.'</p>

  <p>'If I can get near the stage-door what with the stools for the queue,' Mrs
  Tinker said; in comment rather than in truth. 'That thing's going to run for
  ever.'</p>

  <p>She put the folded paper carefully away in the cheap pseudo-leather
  handbag with the shabby edges that was as much a part of her as her hat.
  Grant had, Christmas by Christmas, provided her with a new bag; each of them
  a work of art in the best tradition of English leather-working, an article so
  admirable in design and so perfect in execution that Marta Hallard might have
  carried it to luncheon at the Blague. But that was the last he had ever seen
  of any of them. Since Mrs Tinker regarded a pawnshop as one degree more
  disgraceful than prison, he absolved her from any suspicion of cashing in on
  her presents. He deduced that the handbags were safely laid away in a drawer
  somewhere, still wrapped up in the original tissue paper. Perhaps she took
  them out to show people sometimes, sometimes perhaps just to gloat over; or
  perhaps the knowledge that they were there enriched her, as the knowledge of
  'something put by for my funeral' might enrich another. Next Christmas he was
  going to open this shabby sack of hers, this perennial satchel à toute faire,
  and put something in the money compartment. She would fritter it away, of
  course, on small unimportances; so that in the end she would not know what
  she had done with it; but perhaps a series of small satisfactions scattered
  like sequins over the texture of everyday life was of greater worth than the
  academic satisfaction of owning a collection of fine objects at the back of a
  drawer.</p>

  <p>When she had gone creaking away, in a shoes-and-corset concerto, he went
  back to Mr Tanner and tried to improve his mind by acquiring some of Mr
  Tanner's interest in the human race. But he found it an effort. Neither by
  nature nor by profession was he interested in mankind in the large. His bias,
  native and acquired, was towards the personal. He waded through Mr Tanner's
  statistics and longed for a king in an oak-tree, or a broom tied to a
  mast-head, or a Highlander hanging on to a trooper's stirrup in a charge. But
  at least he had the satisfaction of learning that the Englishman of the
  fifteenth century 'drank water only as a penance'. The English labourer of
  Richard III's day was, it seemed, the admiration of the continent. Mr Tanner
  quoted a contemporary, writing in France.</p>

  <p>The King of France will allow no one to use salt, but what is bought of
  himself at his own arbitrary price. The troops pay for nothing, and treat the
  people barbarously if they are not satisfied. All growers of vines must give
  a fourth to the King. All the towns must pay the King great yearly sums for
  his men-at-arms. The peasants live in great hardship and misery. They wear no
  woollen. Their clothing consists of little short jerkins of sackcloth, no
  trowse but from the knees up, and legs exposed and naked. The women all go
  barefoot. The people eat no meat, except the fat of bacon in their soup. Nor
  are the gentry much better off. If an accusation is brought against them they
  are examined in private, and perhaps never more heard of.</p>

  <p>In England it is very different. No one can abide in another man's house
  without his leave. The King cannot put on taxes, nor alter the laws, nor make
  new ones. The English never drink water except for penance. They eat all
  sorts of flesh and fish. They are clothed throughout in good woollens, and
  are provided with all sorts of household goods. An Englishman cannot be sued
  except before the ordinary judge.</p>

  <p>And it seemed to Grant that if you were very hard up and wanted to go to
  see what your Lizzie's first-born looked like it must have been reassuring to
  know that there was shelter and a hand-out at every religious house, instead
  of wondering how you were going to raise the train fare. That green England
  he had fallen asleep with last night had a lot to be said for it.</p>

  <p>He thumbed through the pages on the fifteenth century, looking for
  personal items; for individual reports that might, in their single vividness,
  illumine the scene for him as a 'spot' lights the desired part of a stage.
  But the story was distressingly devoted to the general. According to Mr
  Tanner, Richard III's only Parliament was the most liberal and progressive
  within record; and he regretted, did the worthy Mr Tanner, that his private
  crimes should have militated against his patent desire for the common weal.
  And that seemed to be all that Mr Tanner had to say about Richard III. Except
  for the Pastons, chatting indestructibly through the centuries, there was a
  dearth of human beings in this record of humanity.</p>

  <p>He let the book slide off his chest, and searched with his hand until he
  found <i>The Rose of Raby</i>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first"><i>THE Rose of Raby</i> proved to be fiction; but it was at
  least easier to hold than Tanner's Constitutional History of England. It was,
  moreover, the almost-respectable form of historical fiction which is merely
  history-with-conversation, so to speak. An imaginative biography rather than
  an imagined story. Evelyn Payne-Ellis, whoever she might be, had provided
  portraits and a family tree, and had made no attempt, it seemed, to what he
  and his cousin Laura used to call in their childhood 'write forsoothly'.
  There was no 'by our Ladys', no 'nathelesses' or 'varlets'. It was an honest
  affair according to its lights.</p>

  <p>And its lights were more illuminating than Mr Tanner.</p>

  <p>Much more illuminating.</p>

  <p>It was Grant's belief that if you could not find out about a man, the next
  best way to arrive at an estimate of him was to find out about his
  mother.</p>

  <p>So until Marta could provide him with the sainted and infallible Thomas
  More's personal account of Richard, he would make do very happily with Cecily
  Nevill, Duchess of York.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the family tree, and thought that if the two York brothers,
  Edward and Richard, were, as kings, unique in their experience of ordinary
  life they were no less unique in their Englishness. He looked at their
  breeding and marvelled. Nevill, Fitzalan, Percy, Holland, Mortimer, Clifford
  and Audley, as well as Plantagenet. Queen Elizabeth (who made it her boast)
  was all English; if one counted the Welsh streak as English. But among all
  the half-bred monarchs who had graced the throne between the Conquest and
  Farmer George&mdash;half-French, half-Spanish, half-Danish, half-Dutch,
  half-Portuguese&mdash;Edward IV and Richard III were remarkable in their
  home-bred quality.</p>

  <p>They were also, he noted, as royally bred on their mother's side as on
  their father's. Cecily Nevill's grandfather was John of Gaunt, the first of
  the Lancasters; third son of Edward III. Her husband's two grandfathers were
  two other sons of Edward III. So three of Edwards III's five sons had
  contributed to the making of the two York brothers.</p>

  <p>'To be a Nevill,' said Miss Payne-Ellis 'was to be of some importance
  since they were great landowners. To be a Nevill was almost certainly to be
  handsome, since they were a good-looking family. To be a Nevill was to have
  personality, since they excelled in displays of both character and
  temperament. To unite all three Nevill gifts, in their finest quality, in one
  person was the good fortune of Cicely Nevill, who was the sole Rose of the
  north long before that north was forced to choose between White Roses and
  Red.'</p>

  <p>It was Miss Payne-Ellis's contention that the marriage with Richard
  Plantagenet, Duke of York, was a love match. Grant received this theory with
  a scepticism bordering on scorn until he noticed the results of that
  marriage. To have a yearly addition to the family was not, in the fifteenth
  century, evidence of anything but fertility. And the long family produced by
  Cicely Nevill to her charming husband augured nothing nearer love than
  cohabitation. But in a time when the wife's rôle was to stay meekly at home
  and see to her still-room, Cecily Nevill's constant travellings about in her
  husband's company were surely remarkable enough to suggest an abnormal
  pleasure in that company. The extent and constancy of that travel was
  witnessed to by the birthplaces of her children. Anne, her first, was born at
  Fotheringhay, the family home in Northamptonshire. Henry, who died as a baby,
  at Hatfield. Edward at Rouen, where the Duke was on active service. Edmund
  and Elizabeth also at Rouen. Margaret at Fotheringhay. John, who died young,
  at Neath in Wales. George in Dublin (and could it be, wondered Grant, that
  that accounted for the almost Irish perverseness of the ineffable George?).
  Richard at Fotheringhay.</p>

  <p>Cecily Nevill had not sat at home in Northamptonshire waiting for her lord
  and master to visit her when it seemed good to him. She had accompanied him
  about the world of their inhabiting. There was strong presumption in favour
  of Miss Payne-Ellis's theory. At the very canniest reckoning it was patently
  a very successful marriage.</p>

  <p>Which perhaps accounted for the family devotion of those daily visits of
  Edward to his small brothers in the Pastons' lodgings. The York family, even
  before its tribulations, was a united one.</p>

  <p>This was borne out unexpectedly when, spurting the pages from under his
  thumb, he came on a letter. It was a letter from the two elder boys, Edward
  and Edmund, to their father. The boys were at Ludlow Castle, undergoing their
  education, and on a Saturday in Easter week, taking advantage of a courier
  who was going back, they burst out in loud complaint of their tutor and his
  'odiousness' and begged their father to listen to the tale of the courier,
  William Smyth, who was fully charged with the details of their oppression.
  This S.O.S. was introduced and ended in respectful padding, the formality of
  which was a little marred by their pointing out that it was nice of him to
  send the clothes but that he had forgotten their breviary.</p>

  <p>The conscientious Miss Payne-Ellis had given the reference for this letter
  (one of the Cotton manuscripts, it appeared) and he thumbed more slowly, in
  search of more. Factual evidence was a policeman's meat.</p>

  <p>He could not find any, but he came on a family tableau which held him for
  a moment.</p>

  <p>The Duchess moved out into the thin sharp sunlight of a London December
  morning, and stood on the steps to watch them go: her husband, her brother,
  and her son. Dirk and his nephews brought the horses into the courtyard,
  scattering the pigeons and the fussing sparrows from the cobbles. She watched
  her husband mount, equable and deliberate as always, and thought that for all
  the emotion he showed he might be riding down to Fotheringhay to look at some
  new rams instead of setting out on a campaign. Salisbury, her brother, was
  being Nevill and temperamental; a little conscious of the occasion and living
  up to it. She looked at them both and smiled in her mind at them. But it was
  Edmund who caught at her heart. Edmund at seventeen, very slender, very
  untried, very vulnerable. Flushed with pride and excitement at this
  setting-out to his first campaigning. She wanted to say to her husband: 'Take
  care of Edmund,' but she could not do that. Her husband would not understand;
  and Edmund, if he were to suspect, would be furious. If Edward, only a year
  older, was commanding an army of his own on the borders of Wales at this very
  minute, then he, Edmund, was more than old enough to see war at
  first-hand.</p>

  <p>She glanced behind her at the three younger children who had come out in
  her wake; Margaret and George, the two solid fair ones, and behind them, a
  pace in the rear as always, her changeling baby, Richard; his dark brows and
  brown hair making him look like a visitor. Good-natured untidy Margaret
  watched with all the moist-eyed emotion of fourteen; George in a passionate
  envy and wild rebellion that he was only eleven and of no consequence to this
  martial moment. Thin little Richard showed no excitement at all, but his
  mother thought that he vibrated like a softly tapped drum.</p>

  <p>The three horses moved out of the courtyard in a clatter of slipping
  hooves and jingling accoutrements, to join the servants waiting for them in
  the roadway, and the children called and danced and waved them out of the
  gate.</p>

  <p>And Cicely, who in her time had seen so many men, and so many of her
  family, go off to went back to the house with an unaccustomed weight at her
  bosom. Which of them, said the voice in her unwilling mind, which of them was
  it who was not coming back?</p>

  <p>Her imagination did not compass anything so horrible as the fact that none
  of them was coming back again. That she would never see any one of them
  again.</p>

  <p>That before the year was ended her husband's severed head, crowned for
  insult with a paper crown, would be nailed above the Micklegate Bar in York,
  and the heads of her brother and her son on the two other gates.</p>

  <p>Well, that might be fiction, but it was an illuminating glimpse of
  Richard. The dark one in a blond family. The one who 'looked like a visitor'.
  The 'changeling'.</p>

  <p>He abandoned Cicely Nevill for the moment, and went hunting through the
  book for her son Richard. But Miss Payne-Ellis seemed not to be greatly
  interested in Richard. He was merely the tail-end of the family. The
  magnificent young creature who flourished at the other end was more to her
  taste. Edward was much to the fore. With his Nevill cousin Warwick,
  Salisbury's son, he won the battle of Towton, and, with the memory of
  Lancastrian ferocity still fresh and his father's head still nailed to the
  Micklegate Bar, gave evidence of that tolerance that was to be characteristic
  of him. There was quarter at Towton for all who asked. He was crowned King of
  England in Westminster Abbey (and two small boys, home from exile in Utrecht,
  were created respectively Duke of Clarence and Duke of Gloucester). And he
  buried his father and his brother Edmund with great magnificence in the
  church at Fotheringhay (though it was Richard, aged thirteen, who convoyed
  that sad procession from Yorkshire, through the bright glory of five July
  days, to Northamptonshire; nearly six years after he had stood on the steps
  of Baynard's Castle in London to watch them ride away).</p>

  <p>It was not until Edward had been King for some time that Miss Payne-Ellis
  allowed Richard to come back into the story. He was then being educated with
  his Nevill cousins at Middleham, in Yorkshire.</p>

  <p>As Richard rode into the shadow of the keep, out of the broad sunlight and
  flying winds of Wensleydale, it seemed to him that there was an atmosphere of
  strangeness about the place. The guards were talking in loud excitement in
  the gatehouse and seemed abashed at his presence. From their sudden silence
  he rode on into a silent court that should have been bustling with activity
  at this hour of the day. It would soon be supper time, and both habit and
  hunger brought all the inhabitants of Middleham home from their various
  occupations, as they were bringing him back from his hawking, for the evening
  meal. This hush, this desertion, was unusual. He walked his horse to the
  stables, but there was no one there to give it to. As he unsaddled he noticed
  a hard-ridden bay in the next stall; a horse that did not belong to
  Middleham; a horse so tired that he had not eaten up and his head hung in a
  despondent beaten way between his knees.</p>

  <p>Richard wiped his horse down and rugged him, brought him some hay and
  fresh water, and left him; wondering about that beaten horse and the uncanny
  silence. As he paused in the doorway he could hear voices in the distance of
  the great hall; and debated whether he should go there and investigate before
  going upstairs to his own quarters. As he hesitated a voice from the stairs
  above him said: 'Z-z-zt!'</p>

  <p>He looked up to see his cousin Anne's head peering over the banisters, her
  two long fair plaits hanging down like bell-ropes.</p>

  <p>'Richard!' she said, half whispering. 'Have you heard?'</p>

  <p>'Is something wrong?' he asked. 'What is it?'</p>

  <p>As he moved up to her she grabbed his hand and dragged him upwards towards
  their schoolroom in the roof.</p>

  <p>'But what is it?' he asked, leaning back in protest against her urgency.
  'What has happened? Is it something so awful that you can't tell me
  here!'</p>

  <p>She swept him into the schoolroom and shut the door.</p>

  <p>'It's Edward!'</p>

  <p>'Edward? Is he ill?'</p>

  <p>'No! <i>Scandal!</i>'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Richard, relieved. Scandal and Edward were never far apart.
  'What is it? Has he a new mistress?'</p>

  <p>'Much worse than that! Oh, much, much worse. He's married.'</p>

  <p>'Married?' said Richard, so unbelieving that he sounded calm. 'He can't
  be.'</p>

  <p>'But he is. The news came from London an hour ago.'</p>

  <p>'He can't be married,' Richard insisted. 'For a King marriage is a long
  affair. A matter of contracts, and agreements. A matter for Parliament, even,
  I think. What made you think he had got married?'</p>

  <p>'I don't <i>think</i>,' Anne said, out of patience at this sober reception
  of her broadside. 'The whole family is raging together in the Great Hall over
  the affair.'</p>

  <p>'Anne! have you been listening at the door?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't be so righteous. I didn't have to listen very hard, anyhow. You
  could hear them on the other side of the river. He has married Lady
  Grey!'</p>

  <p>'Who is Lady Grey? Lady Grey of Groby?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'But he can't. She has two children and she is quite old.'</p>

  <p>'She is five years older than Edward, and she is wonderfully beautiful so
  I overhear.'</p>

  <p>'When did this happen?'</p>

  <p>'They've been married for five months. They got married in secret down in
  Northamptonshire.'</p>

  <p>'But I thought he was going to marry the King of France's sister.'</p>

  <p>'So,' said Anne in a tone full of meaning 'did my father.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; yes, it makes things very awkward for him, doesn't it; after all the
  negotiating.'</p>

  <p>'According to the messenger from London he is throwing fits. It isn't only
  the making him look a fool. It seems she has cohorts of relations and he
  hates every one of them.'</p>

  <p>'Edward must be possessed.' In Richard's hero-worshipping eyes everything
  Edward did had always been right. This folly, this undeniable, this
  inexcusable folly, could come only from possession.</p>

  <p>'It will break my mother's heart,' he said. He thought of his mother's
  courage when his father and Edmund had been killed, and the Lancastrian army
  was almost at the gates of London. She had not wept nor wrapped herself in
  protective veils of self-pity. She had arranged that he and George should go
  to Utrecht, as if she were arranging for them to go away to school. They
  might never see each other again, but she had busied herself about warm
  clothes for their winter voyage across the Channel with a calm and dry-eyed
  practicality.</p>

  <p>How would she bear this; this further blow? This destructive folly. This
  shattering foolishness.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Anne, softening. 'Poor Aunt Cecily. It is monstrous of Edward
  to hurt everyone so. Monstrous.'</p>

  <p>But Edward was still the infallible. If Edward had done wrong it was
  because he was ill, or possessed, or bewitched. Edward still had Richard's
  allegiance; his heart-whole and worshipping allegiance.</p>

  <p>Nor in after years was that allegiance&mdash;an adult allegiance of
  recognition and acceptance&mdash;ever less than heart-whole.</p>

  <p>And then the story went on to Cicely Nevill's tribulation, and her efforts
  to bring some kind of order into the relations between her son Edward,
  half-pleased half-ashamed, and her nephew Warwick, wholly furious. There was
  also a long description of that indestructibly virtuous beauty with the
  famous 'gilt' hair, who had succeeded where more complaisant beauties had
  failed; and of her enthroning at Reading Abbey (led to the throne by a
  silently protesting Warwick, who could not but note the large array of
  Woodvilles, come to see their sister Elizabeth acknowledged Queen of
  England).</p>

  <p>The next time Richard turned up in the tale he was setting out from Lynn
  without a penny in his pocket, in a Dutch vessel that happened to be in the
  harbour when it was needed. Along with him was his brother Edward, Edward's
  friend Lord Hastings, and a few followers. None of them had anything except
  what they stood up in, and after some argument the ship's captain agreed to
  accept Edward's fur-lined cape as fare.</p>

  <p>Warwick had finally decided that the Woodville clan was more than he could
  stomach. He had helped to put his cousin Edward on the throne of England; he
  could just as easily unseat him. For the achievement of this he had the help
  of the whole Nevill brood; and, incredibly, the active assistance of the
  ineffable George, who had decided that falling heir to half the lands of
  Montague, Nevill, and Beauchamp, by marrying Warwick's other daughter Isabel,
  was a better bet than being loyal to his brother Edward. In eleven days
  Warwick was master of a surprised England, and Edward and Richard were
  squelching through the October mud between Alkmaar and The Hague.</p>

  <p>From then on, Richard was always in the background of the story. Through
  that dreary winter in Bruges. Staying with Margaret in Burgundy&mdash;for that kind
  moist-eyed Margaret who had stood on the steps of Baynard's Castle with
  himself and George to watch their father ride away was now the very new
  Duchess of Burgundy. Margaret, kind Margaret, was saddened and dismayed&mdash;as
  many people in future were to be saddened and dismayed&mdash;by George's
  inexplicable conduct, and set herself to missionary work while she got
  together funds for her two more admirable brothers.</p>

  <p>Not even Miss Payne-Ellis's interest in the magnificent Edward allowed her
  to conceal that the real work of outfitting the ships hired with Margaret's
  money was done by Richard; a Richard not yet eighteen. And when Edward with
  an absurd handful of followers found himself once more camped in an English
  meadow, facing George with an army, it was Richard who went over to George's
  camp and talked the Margaret-weakened George into alliance again and so left
  the road to London open to them.</p>

  <p>Not, Grant thought, that this last was any great achievement. George could
  obviously be talked into anything. He was a born missionee.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">HE had not nearly exhausted <i>The Rose of Raby</i> and the
  illicit joys of fiction when, next morning about eleven, a parcel arrived
  from Marta containing the more respectable entertainment of history as
  recorded by the sainted Sir Thomas.</p>

  <p>With the book was a note in Marta's large sprawling writing on Marta's
  stiff expensive notepaper.</p>

  <p class="letter">Have to send this instead of bringing it. Frantically busy. Think I have
  got M.M. to the sticking point re Blessington. No T. More in any of the
  bookshops, so tried Public Library. Can't think why one never thinks of
  Public Libraries. Probably because books expected to be soupy. Think this
  looks quite clean and unsoupy. You get fourteen days. Sounds like a sentence
  rather than a loan. Hope this interest in Crouchback means that the prickles
  are less nettlish. Till soon.<br>
  <br>
  <p>Marta.</p>

  <p>The book did indeed look clean and unsoupy, if a little elderly. But after
  the light going of <i>The Rose</i> its print looked unexciting and its solid
  paragraphs forbidding. Nevertheless he attacked it with interest. This was,
  after all, where Richard III was concerned, 'the horse's mouth'.</p>

  <p>He came to the surface an hour later, vaguely puzzled and ill at ease. It
  was not that the matter surprised him; the facts were very much what he had
  expected them to be. It was that this was not how he had expected Sir Thomas
  to write.</p>

  <p class="letter">He took ill rest at nights, lay long waking and musing; sore wearied with
  care and watch, he slumbered rather than slept. So was his restless heart
  continually tossed and tumbled with the tedious impression and stormy
  remembrance of his most abominable deeds.</p>

  <p>That was all right. But when he added that 'this he had from such as were
  secret with his chamberers' one was suddenly repelled. An aroma of back-stair
  gossip and servants' spying came off the page. So that one's sympathy tilted
  before one was aware of it from the smug commentator to the tortured creature
  sleepless on his bed. The murderer seemed of greater stature than the man who
  was writing of him.</p>

  <p>Which was all wrong.</p>

  <p>Grant was conscious too of the same unease that filled him when he
  listened to a witness telling a perfect story that he knew to be flawed
  somewhere.</p>

  <p>And that was very puzzling indeed. What could possibly be wrong with the
  personal account of a man revered for his integrity as Thomas More had been
  revered for four centuries?</p>

  <p>The Richard who appeared in More's account was, Grant thought, one that
  Matron would have recognised. A man highly-strung and capable of both great
  evil and great suffering. 'He was never quiet in his mind, never thought
  himself secure. His eyes whirled about, his body was privily fenced, his
  hands ever on his dagger, his countenance and manner like one always ready to
  strike again.'</p>

  <p>And of course there was the dramatic, not to say hysterical, scene that
  Grant remembered from his schooldays; that every schoolboy probably
  remembered. The council scene in the Tower before he laid claim to the crown.
  Richard's sudden challenge to Hastings as to what was the proper fate for a
  man who plotted the death of the Protector of the Kingdom. The insane claim
  that Edward's wife and Edward's mistress (Jane Shore) were responsible for
  his withered arm by their sorcery. The smiting of the table in his rage,
  which was the signal for his armed satellites to burst in and arrest Lord
  Hastings, Lord Stanley, and John Morton, Bishop of Ely. The rushing of
  Hastings down into the courtyard and his beheading on a handy log of wood
  after bare time to confess himself to the first priest who could be
  found.</p>

  <p>That was certainly the picture of a man who would act first in fury, in
  fear, in revenge&mdash;and repent afterwards.</p>

  <p>But it seemed that he was capable of more calculated iniquity. He caused a
  sermon to be preached by a certain Dr Shaw, brother of the Lord Mayor, at
  Paul's Cross, on June 22, on the text: 'Bastard slips shall take no root.'
  Wherein Dr Shaw maintained that both Edward and George were sons of the
  Duchess of York by some unknown man, and that Richard was the only legitimate
  son of the Duke and Duchess of York.</p>

  <p>This was so unlikely, so inherently absurd, that Grant went back and read
  it over again. But it still said the same thing. That Richard had traduced
  his mother, in public and for his own material advantage, with an
  unbelievable infamy.</p>

  <p>Well, Sir Thomas More said it. And if anyone should know it would be
  Thomas More. And if anyone should know how to pick and choose between the
  credibilities in the reporting of a story it ought to be Thomas More, Lord
  Chancellor of England.</p>

  <p>Richard's mother, said Sir Thomas, complained bitterly of the slander with
  which her son had smirched her. Understandably, on the whole, Grant
  thought.</p>

  <p>As for Dr Shaw, he was overcome with remorse. So much so that 'within a
  few days he withered and consumed away'.</p>

  <p>Had a stroke, probably, Grant considered. And little wonder. To have stood
  up and told that tale to a London crowd must have taken some nerve.</p>

  <p>Sir Thomas's account of the Princes in the Tower was the same as The
  Amazon's, but Sir Thomas's version was more detailed. Richard had suggested
  to Robert Brackenbury, Constable of the Tower, that it might be a good thing
  if the Princes disappeared, but Brackenbury would have no part in such an
  act. Richard therefore waited until he was at Warwick, during his progress
  through England after his coronation and then sent Tyrrel to London with
  orders that he was to receive the keys of the Tower for one night. During
  that night two ruffians, Dighton and Forrest, one a groom and one a warder,
  smothered the two boys.</p>

  <p>At this point The Midget came in with his lunch and removed the book from
  his grasp; and while he forked the shepherd's pie from plate to mouth he
  considered again the face of the man in the dock. The faithful and patient
  small brother who had turned into a monster.</p>

  <p>When The Midget came back for his tray he said: 'Did you know that Richard
  III was a very popular person in his day? Before he came to the throne, I
  mean.'</p>

  <p>The Midget cast a baleful glance at the picture.</p>

  <p>'Always was a snake in the grass, if you ask me. Smooth, that's what he
  was: smooth. Biding his time.'</p>

  <p>Biding his time for what? he wondered, as she tapped away down the
  corridor. He could not have known that his brother Edward would die
  unexpectedly at the early age of forty. He could not have foreseen (even
  after a childhood shared with him in uncommon intimacy) that George's
  on-goings would end in attainder and the debarring of his two children from
  the succession. There seemed little point in 'biding one's time' if there was
  nothing to bide for. The indestructibly virtuous beauty with the gilt hair
  had, except for her incurable nepotism, proved an admirable Queen and had
  provided Edward with a large brood of healthy children, including two boys.
  The whole of that brood, together with George and his son and daughter, stood
  between Richard and the throne. It was surely unlikely that a man busy with
  the administration of the North of England, or campaigning (with dazzling
  success) against the Scots, would have much spare interest in being
  'smooth'.</p>

  <p>What then had changed him so fundamentally in so short a time?</p>

  <p>Grant reached for <i>The Rose of Raby</i> to see what Miss Payne-Ellis had
  had to say about the unhappy metamorphosis of Cecily Nevill's youngest son.
  But that wily author had burked the issue. She had wanted the book to be a
  happy one, and to have carried it to its logical conclusion would have made
  it unredeemed tragedy. She had therefore wound it up with a fine resounding
  major chord by making her last chapter the coming-out of young Elizabeth,
  Edward's eldest child. This avoided both the tragedy of Elizabeth's young
  brothers and the defeat and death of Richard in battle.</p>

  <p>So the book ended with a Palace party, and a flushed and happy young
  Elizabeth, very magnificent in a new white dress and her first pearls,
  dancing the soles out of her slippers like the princesses in the fairy-tale.
  Richard and Anne, and their delicate little son, had come up from Middleham
  for the occasion. But neither George nor Isabel was there. Isabel had died in
  childbirth years ago, obscurely and as far as George was concerned unmourned.
  George too had died obscurely, but with that perverseness that was so
  peculiarly George's, had by that very obscurity won for himself imperishable
  fame.</p>

  <p>George's life had been a progression from one spectacular piece of
  spiritual extravagance to the next. Each time, his family must have said:
  Well, that at last is the summit of frightfulness; even George cannot think
  of anything more fantastic than that. And each time George had surprised
  them. There was no limit to George's antic capacity.</p>

  <p>The seed was perhaps sown when, during his first backsliding in the
  company of his father-in-law, Warwick had created him heir to the poor crazy
  puppet-King, Henry VI, whom Warwick had dumped back on the throne to spite
  his cousin Edward. Both Warwick's hopes of seeing his daughter a Queen and
  George's royal pretensions had gone down the drain on that night when Richard
  had gone over to the Lancastrian camp and talked to George. But the taste of
  importance had perhaps proved too much for a natural sweet-tooth. In the
  years to come the family were always heading George off from unexpected
  vagaries, or rescuing him from his latest caper.</p>

  <p>When Isabel died he had been certain that she had been poisoned by her
  waiting-woman, and that his baby son had been poisoned by another. Edward,
  thinking the affair important enough to be tried before a London court, sent
  down a writ; only to find that George had tried them both at a petty sessions
  of his own magistrates and hanged them. The furious Edward, by way of rapping
  him over the knuckles, had two members of George's household tried for
  treason; but instead of taking the hint George declared that this was just
  judicial murder, and went about saying so in loud tones and a fine blaze of
  _lèse-majesté_.</p>

  <p>Then he decided that he wanted to marry the richest heiress in Europe; who
  was Margaret's step-daughter, young Mary of Burgundy. Kind Margaret thought
  that it would be nice to have her brother in Burgundy, but Edward had
  arranged to back Maximilian of Austria's suit, and George was a continual
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>When the Burgundy intrigue came to nothing, the family hoped for a little
  peace. After all, George owned half the Nevill lands and had no need to marry
  again either for fortune or children. But George had a new scheme for
  marrying Margaret, the sister of James III of Scotland.</p>

  <p>At last his folie de grandeur graduated from secret negotiation undertaken
  on his own behalf with foreign courts to open display of the Lancastrian Act
  of Parliament which had declared him heir to the throne after Henry VI. This,
  inevitably, landed him before another Parliament, and a much less amenable
  one.</p>

  <p>The trial was chiefly remarkable for a flaming and wordy row between the
  two brothers Edward and George, but when the expected attainder was passed,
  there was a pause. Depriving George of his standing was one thing: desirable
  and indeed necessary. But executing him was something else again.</p>

  <p>As the days went by without sentence being carried out, the Commons sent a
  reminder. And next day it was announced that George, Duke of Clarence, had
  died in the Tower.</p>

  <p>Drowned in a butt of Malmsey, said London. And what was merely a Cockney's
  comment on a drunkard's end passed into history and made the undeserving
  George immortal.</p>

  <p>So George was not at that party at Westminster, and the emphasis in Miss
  Payne-Ellis's final chapter was not Cecily Nevill as the mother of sons, but
  on Cecily Nevill the grandmother of a fine brood. George might have died
  discredited, on a dried-leaf heap of worn-out friendships, but his son, young
  Warwick, was a fine upstanding boy, and little Margaret at ten was already
  showing signs of the traditional Nevill beauty. Edmund, dead in battle at
  seventeen, might seem a wanton waste of young life, but there to balance it
  was the delicate baby whom she had never thought to rear; and he had a son to
  follow him. Richard in his twenties still looked as though one could break
  him in two, but he was as tough as a heather root, and perhaps his
  fragile-looking son would grow up to be as resilient. As for Edward, her tall
  blond Edward, his beauty might be blurring into grossness and his amiability
  into sloth, but his two small sons and his five girls had all the character
  and good looks of their combined ancestry.</p>

  <p>As a grandmother she could look on that crowd of children with a personal
  pride, and as a Princess of England she could look on them with assurance.
  The crown was safe in the York line for generations to come.</p>

  <p>If anyone, looking in a crystal ball at that party, had told Cecily Nevill
  that in four years not only the York line but the whole Plantagenet dynasty
  would have gone for ever, she would have held it to be either madness or
  treason.</p>

  <p>But what Miss Payne-Ellis had not sought to gloss over was the prevalence
  of the Woodville clan in a Nevill-Plantagenet gathering.</p>

  <p>She looked round the room and wished that her daughter-in-law Elizabeth
  had been blessed either with a less generous heart or with fewer relations.
  The Woodville match had turned out far more happily than anyone had dared to
  hope; Elizabeth had been an admirable wife; but the by-products had not been
  so fortunate. It was perhaps inevitable that the governorship of the two boys
  should have gone to her eldest brother; and Rivers, if a little nouveau riche
  in his liking for display and a little too obviously ambitious, was a
  cultured creature and an admirable person to have the boys in charge during
  their schoolroom days at Ludlow. But as for the rest: four brothers, seven
  sisters, and two sons by her first husband, were really too many by half to
  have brought into the marriage market in her wake.</p>

  <p>Cecily looked across the laughing mêlée of the children's blind man's buff
  to the grownups standing round the supper table. Anne Woodville married to
  the Earl of Essex's heir. Eleanor Woodville married to the Earl of Kent's
  heir. Margaret Woodville married to the Earl of Arundel's heir. Catherine
  Woodville married to the Duke of Buckingham. Jacquette Woodville to Lord
  Strange. Mary Woodville to Lord Herbert's heir. And John Woodville,
  disgracefully, to the Dowager of Norfolk who was old enough to be his
  grandmother. It was good that new blood should strengthen the old families&mdash;new
  blood had always seeped in&mdash;but it was not good that it should come
  suddenly and in a flood from one particular source. It was like a fever in
  the political blood of the country; a foreign introduction, difficult to be
  assimilated. Unwise and regrettable.</p>

  <p>However. There were long years ahead in which that influx could be
  assimilated. This new sudden power in the body politic would cease to be so
  concentrated, would spread out, would settle down, would cease to be
  dangerous and upsetting. Edward for all his amiability had a shrewd common
  sense; he would keep the country on an even keel as he had kept it for nearly
  twenty years. No one had run England with a more despotic power or a lighter
  hand than her acute, lazy, woman-loving Edward.</p>

  <p>It would be all right eventually.</p>

  <p>She was about to rise and join them in their discussion of sweetmeats they
  must not think that she was being critical or aloof when her granddaughter
  Elizabeth came breathless and laughing out of the scrimmage and swept into
  the seat beside her.</p>

  <p>'I am much too old for this sort of thing,' she said between her gasps,
  'and it is ruinous to one's clothes. Do you like my dress, grandmother? I had
  to coax it out of Father. He said my old tawny satin would do. The one I had
  when Aunt Margaret came from Burgundy to visit us. That is the worst of
  having a father who notices what women wear. He knows too much about one's
  wardrobe. Did you hear that the Dauphin has jilted me? Father is in a pet,
  but I am so happy. I lighted ten candles to St Catherine. It took all I had
  left of my allowance. I don't want to leave England. I want never to leave
  England ever. Can you arrange that for me, grandmother?'</p>

  <p>Cicely smiled and said that she would try.</p>

  <p>'Old Ankaret, who tells fortunes, says that I am to be a Queen. But since
  there is no prince to marry me I do not see how that may be.' She paused, and
  added in a smaller voice: 'She said Queen of England. But I expect she was
  just a little tipsy. She is very fond of hippocras.'</p>

  <p>It was unfair, not to say inartistic, of Miss Payne-Ellis to hint at
  Elizabeth's future as the wife of Henry VII if as author she was not prepared
  to face the unpleasantness that lay between. To presuppose in her readers a
  knowledge of Elizabeth's marriage to the first Tudor king, was also to
  presuppose their awareness of her brothers' murder. So that a dark reminding
  shadow fell across the festive scene with which she had chosen to end her
  story.</p>

  <p>But on the whole, Grant thought, she had made a good enough job of the
  story, judging by what he had read of it. He might even go back sometime and
  read the bits he had skipped.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">GRANT had switched off his bedside light that night, and was
  half asleep, when a voice in his mind said: 'But Thomas More was Henry the
  Eighth.'</p>

  <p>This brought him wide awake. He flicked the light on again.</p>

  <p>What the voice had meant, of course, was not that Thomas More and Henry
  the Eighth were one and the same person, but that, in that business of
  putting personalities into pigeonholes according to reigns, Thomas More
  belonged to the reign of Henry the Eighth.</p>

  <p>Grant lay looking at the pool of light that his lamp threw on the ceiling,
  and reckoned. If Thomas More was Henry VIII's Chancellor, then he must have
  lived through the whole of Henry VII's long reign as well as Richard III's.
  There was something wrong somewhere.</p>

  <p>He reached for More's <i>History of Richard III</i>. It had as preface a
  short life of More which he had not bothered to read. Now he turned to it to
  find out how More could have been both Richard III's historian and Henry
  VIII's Chancellor. How old was More when Richard succeeded?</p>

  <p>He was five.</p>

  <p>When that dramatic council scene had taken place at the Tower, Thomas More
  had been five years old. He had been only eight when Richard died at
  Bosworth.</p>

  <p>Everything in that history had been hearsay.</p>

  <p>And if there was one word that a policeman loathed more than another it
  was hearsay. Especially when applied to evidence.</p>

  <p>He was so disgusted that he flung the precious book on to the floor before
  he remembered that it was the property of a Public Library and his only by
  grace and for fourteen days.</p>

  <p>More had never known Richard III at all. He had indeed grown up under a
  Tudor administration. That book was the Bible of the whole historical world
  on the subject of Richard III&mdash;it was from that account that Holinshed
  had taken his material, and from that that Shakespeare had written his and
  except that More believed what he wrote to be true it was of no more value
  than what the soldier said. It was what his cousin Laura called 'snow on
  their boots'. A 'gospel-true' event seen by someone other than the teller.
  That More had a critical mind and an admirable integrity did not make the
  story acceptable evidence. A great many otherwise admirable minds had
  accepted that story of the Russian troops passing through Britain. Grant had
  dealt too long with the human intelligence to accept as truth someone's
  report of someone's report of what that someone remembered to have seen or
  been told.</p>

  <p>He was disgusted.</p>

  <p>At the first opportunity he must get an actual contemporary account of the
  events of Richard's short reign. The Public Library could have Sir Thomas
  More back tomorrow and be damned to their fourteen days. The fact that Sir
  Thomas was a martyr and a Great Mind did not cut any ice at all with him,
  Alan Grant. He, Alan Grant, had known Great Minds so uncritical that they
  would believe a story that would make a con. man blush for shame. He had
  known a great scientist who was convinced that a piece of butter muslin was
  his great-aunt Sophia because an illiterate medium from the back streets of
  Plymouth told him so. He had known a great authority on the Human Mind and
  Its Evolution who had been taken for all he had by an incurable knave because
  he 'judged for himself and not on police stories'. As far as he, Alan Grant,
  was concerned there was nothing so uncritical or so damn-silly as your Great
  Mind. As far as he, Alan Grant, was concerned Thomas More was washed out,
  cancelled, deleted; and he, Alan Grant, was beginning from scratch again
  tomorrow morning.</p>

  <p>He was still illogically fuming when he fell asleep, and he woke
  fuming.</p>

  <p>'Do you know that your Sir Thomas More knew nothing about Richard III at
  all?' he said, accusingly, to The Amazon the moment her large person appeared
  in the doorway.</p>

  <p>She looked startled, not at his news but at his ferocity. Her eyes looked
  as if they might brim with tears at another rough word.</p>

  <p>'But of <i>course</i> he knew!' she protested. 'He lived then.'</p>

  <p>'He was eight when Richard died,' Grant said, relentless. 'And all he knew
  was what he had been told. Like me. Like you. Like Will Rogers of blessed
  memory. There is nothing hallowed at all about Sir Thomas More's history of
  Richard III. It's a damned piece of hearsay and a swindle.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you feeling so well this morning?' she asked anxiously. 'Do you
  think you've got a temperature?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know about a temperature, but my blood pressure's away up.'</p>

  <p>'Oh dear, dear,' she said, taking this literally. 'And you were doing so
  very well. Nurse Ingham will be so distressed. She has been boasting about
  your good recovery.'</p>

  <p>That The Midget should have found him a subject for boasting was a new
  idea to Grant, but it was not one that gave him any gratification. He
  resolved to have a temperature in earnest if he could manage it, just to
  score off The Midget.</p>

  <p>But the morning visit of Marta distracted him from this experiment in the
  power of mind over matter.</p>

  <p>Marta, it seemed, was pluming herself on his mental health very much as
  The Midget was pluming herself on his physical improvement. She was delighted
  that her pokings-about with James in the print shop had been so
  effective.</p>

  <p>'Have you decided on Perkin Warbeck, then?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'No. Not Warbeck. Tell me: what made you bring me a portrait of Richard
  III? There's no mystery about Richard, is there?'</p>

  <p>'No. I suppose we took it as illustration to the Warbeck story. No, wait a
  moment. I remember. James turned it up and said: "If he's mad about faces,
  there's one for him!" He said: "That's the most notorious murderer in
  history, and yet his face is in my estimation the face of a saint".'</p>

  <p>'A saint!' Grant said; and then remembered something.
  "Over-conscientious",' he said.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing. I was just remembering my first impressions of it. Is that how
  it seemed to you: the face of a saint?'</p>

  <p>She looked across at the picture, propped up against the pile of books. 'I
  can't see it against the light,' she said, and picked it up for a closer
  scrutiny.</p>

  <p>He was suddenly reminded that to Marta, as to Sergeant Williams, faces
  were a professional matter. The slant of an eyebrow, the set of a mouth, was
  just as much an evidence of character to Marta as to Williams. Indeed she
  actually made herself faces to match the characters she played.</p>

  <p>'Nurse Ingham thinks he's a dreary. Nurse Darroll thinks he's a horror. My
  surgeon thinks he's a polio victim. Sergeant Williams thinks he's a born
  judge. Matron thinks he's a soul in torment.'</p>

  <p>Marta said nothing for a little while. Then she said: 'It's odd, you know.
  When you first look at it you think it a mean, suspicious face. Even
  cantankerous. But when you look at it a little longer you find that it isn't
  like that at all. It is quite calm. It is really quite a gentle face, perhaps
  that is what James meant by being saint-like.'</p>

  <p>'No. No, I don't think so. What he meant was the&mdash;subservience to
  conscience.'</p>

  <p>'Whatever it is, it is a <i>face</i>, isn't it! Not just a collection of
  organs for seeing, breathing, and eating with. A wonderful face. With very
  little alteration, you know, it might be a portrait of Lorenzo the
  Magnificent.'</p>

  <p>'You don't suppose that it is Lorenzo and that we're considering the wrong
  man altogether?'</p>

  <p>'Of course not. Why should you think that?'</p>

  <p>'Because nothing in the face fits the facts of history. And pictures have
  got shuffled before now.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, of course they have. But that is Richard all right. The
  original&mdash;or what is supposed to be the original is at Windsor Castle.
  James told me. It is included in Henry VIII's inventory, so it has been there
  for four hundred years or so. And there are duplicates at Hatfield and
  Albury.'</p>

  <p>'It's Richard,' Grant said resignedly. 'I just don't know anything about
  faces. Do you know anyone at the B.M.?'</p>

  <p>'At the British Museum?' Marta asked, her attention still on the portrait.
  'No, I don't think so. Not that I can think of at the moment. I went there
  once to look at some Egyptian Jewellery, when I was playing Cleopatra with
  Geoffrey&mdash;did you ever see Geoffrey's Antony? it was superlatively
  genteel but the place frightens me rather. Such a garnering of the ages. It
  made me feel the way the stars make you feel: small and no-account. What do
  you want of the B.M.?'</p>

  <p>'I wanted some information about history written in Richard III's day.
  Contemporary accounts.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't the sainted Sir Thomas any good, then?'</p>

  <p>'The sainted Sir Thomas is nothing but an old gossip,' Grant said with
  venom. He had taken a wild dislike to the much-admired More.</p>

  <p>'Oh, dear. And the nice man at the Library seemed so reverent about him.
  The Gospel of Richard III according to St Thomas More, and all that.'</p>

  <p>'Gospel nothing,' Grant said rudely. 'He was writing down in a Tudor
  England what someone had told him about events that happened in a Plantagenet
  England when he himself was five.'</p>

  <p>'Five years old?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, dear. Not exactly the horse's mouth.'</p>

  <p>'Not even straight from the course. Come to think of it, it's as reliable
  as a bookie's tips would be. He's on the wrong side of the rails altogether.
  If he was a Tudor servant he was on the laying side where Richard III was
  concerned.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes, I suppose so. What do you want to find out about Richard, when
  there is no mystery to investigate?'</p>

  <p>'I want to know what made him tick. That is a more profound mystery than
  anything I have come up against of late. What changed him almost overnight?
  Up to the moment of his late brother's death he seems to have been entirely
  admirable. And devoted to his brother.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose the supreme honour must always be a temptation.'</p>

  <p>'He was Regent until the boy came of age, protector of England. With his
  previous history, you would think that would have been enough for him. You
  would have thought, indeed, that it would have been very much his cup of tea:
  guardian of both Edward's son and the kingdom.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps the brat was unbearable, and Richard longed to "larn" him. Isn't
  it odd how we never think of victims as anything but white innocents. Like
  Joseph in the Bible. I'm sure he was a quite intolerable young man, actually,
  and long overdue for that pushing into the pit. Perhaps young Edward was just
  sitting up and begging to be quietly put down.'</p>

  <p>'There were two of them,' Grant reminded her.</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course. Of course there isn't an explanation. It was the ultimate
  barbarism. Poor little woolly lambs! Oh!'</p>

  <p>'What was the "Oh" for?'</p>

  <p>'I've just thought of something. Woolly lambs made me think of it.'</p>

  <p>'Well?'</p>

  <p>'No, I won't tell you in case it doesn't come off. I must fly.'</p>

  <p>'Have you charmed Madeleine March into agreeing to write the play?'</p>

  <p>'Well, she hasn't actually signed a contract yet, but I think she is sold
  on the idea. Au revoir, my dear. I shall look in soon again.'</p>

  <p>She went away, sped on her way by a blushing Amazon, and Grant did not
  remember anything about woolly lambs until the woolly lamb actually turned up
  in his room next evening. The woolly lamb was wearing horn-rimmed spectacles,
  which in some odd way emphasised the resemblance instead of detracting from
  it. Grant had been dozing, more at peace with the world than he had been for
  some time; history was, as Matron had pointed out, an excellent way of
  acquiring a sense of perspective. The tap at his door was so tentative that
  he had decided that he had imagined it. Taps on hospital doors are not apt to
  be tentative. But something made him say: 'Come in!' and there in the opening
  was something that was so unmistakably Marta's woolly lamb that Grant laughed
  aloud before he could stop himself.</p>

  <p>The young man looked abashed, smiled nervously, propped the spectacles on
  his nose with a long thin forefinger, cleared his throat, and said:</p>

  <p>'Mr Grant? My name is Carradine. Brent Carradine. I hope I haven't
  disturbed you when you were resting.'</p>

  <p>'No, no. Come in, Mr Carradine. I am delighted to see you.'</p>

  <p>'Marta&mdash;Miss Hallard, that is&mdash;sent me. She said I could be of
  some help to you.'</p>

  <p>'Did she say how? Do sit down. You'll find a chair over there behind the
  door. Bring it over.'</p>

  <p>He was a tall boy, hatless, with soft fair curls crowning a high forehead
  and a much too big tweed coat hanging unfastened round him in negligent
  folds, American-wise. Indeed, it was obvious that he was in fact American. He
  brought over the chair, planted himself on it with the coat spread round him
  like some royal robe and looked at Grant with kind brown eyes whose luminous
  charm not even the horn-rims could dim.</p>

  <p>'Marta&mdash;Miss Hallard, that is&mdash;said that you wanted something
  looked up.'</p>

  <p>'And are you a looker-upper?'</p>

  <p>'I'm doing research, here in London. Historical research, I mean. And she
  said something about your wanting something in that line. She knows I work at
  the B.M. most mornings. I'd be very pleased, Mr Grant, to do anything I can
  to help you.'</p>

  <p>'That's very kind of you; very kind indeed. What is it that you are
  working on? Your research, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'The Peasants' Revolt.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Richard II.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Are you interested in social conditions?'</p>

  <p>The young man grinned suddenly in a very unstudentlike way and said: 'No,
  I'm interested in staying in England.'</p>

  <p>'And can't you stay in England without doing research?'</p>

  <p>'Not very easily. I've got to have an alibi. My pop thinks I should go
  into the family business. It's furniture. Wholesale furniture. You order it
  by mail. Out of a book. Don't misunderstand me, Mr Grant; it's very good
  furniture. Lasts for ever. It's just that I can't take much interest in
  furnishing-units.'</p>

  <p>'And, short of Polar exploration, the British</p>

  <p>Museum was the best hideaway you could think of.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's warm. And I really do like history. I majored in it. And well,
  Mr Grant, if you really want to know, I just had to follow Atlanta Shergold
  to England. She's the dumb blonde in Marta's I mean: in Miss Hallard's play.
  I mean she plays the dumb blonde. She's not at all dumb, Atlanta.'</p>

  <p>'No, indeed. A very gifted young woman indeed.'</p>

  <p>'You've seen her?'</p>

  <p>'I shouldn't think there is anyone in London who hasn't seen her.'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose not. It does go on and on, doesn't it. We didn't
  think&mdash;Atlanta and me&mdash;that it would run for more than a few weeks,
  so we just waved each other goodbye and said: See you at the beginning of the
  month! It was when we found that it was going on indefinitely that I just had
  to find an excuse to come to England.'</p>

  <p>'Wasn't Atlanta sufficient excuse?'</p>

  <p>'Not for my pop! The family are very snooty about Atlanta, but Pop is the
  worst of the bunch. When he can bring himself to mention her he refers to her
  as "that young actress acquaintance of yours." You see, Pop is Carradine the
  Third, and Atlanta's father is very much Shergold the First. A little grocery
  store on Main Street, as a matter of fact. And the salt of the earth, in case
  you're interested. And of course Atlanta hadn't really done very much, back
  in the States. I mean, on the stage. This is her first big success. That is
  why she didn't want to break her contract and come back home. As a matter of
  fact it'll be quite a fight to get her back home at all. She says we never
  appreciated her.'</p>

  <p>'So you took to research.'</p>

  <p>'I had to think of something that I could do only in London, you see. And
  I had done some research at college. So the B.M. seemed to be what you call
  my cup of tea. I could enjoy myself and yet show my father that I was really
  working, both at the same time.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It's as a nice an alibi as ever I met with. Why the Peasants'
  Revolt, by the way?'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's an interesting time. And I thought it would please Pop.'</p>

  <p>'Is <i>he</i> interested in social reform, then?'</p>

  <p>'No, but he hates kings.'</p>

  <p>'Carradine the Third?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it's a laugh, isn't it. I wouldn't put it past him to have a crown
  in one of his safe-deposit boxes. I bet he takes out the parcel every now and
  then and sneaks over to Grand Central and tries it on in the men's washroom.
  I'm afraid I'm tiring you, Mr Grant; gabbing on about my own affairs like
  this. I didn't come for that. I came to&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Whatever you came for, you're manna straight from heaven. So relax, if
  you're not in a hurry.'</p>

  <p>'I'm never in a hurry,' the young man said, unfolding his legs and laying
  them out in front of him. As he did it his feet, at the far extremity of his
  long limbs, touched the bedside table and shook the portrait of Richard III
  from its precarious position, so that it dropped to the floor.</p>

  <p>'Oh, pardon me! That was careless of me. I haven't really got used to the
  length of my legs yet. You'd think a fellow would be used to his growth by
  twenty-two, wouldn't you.' He picked up the photograph, dusted it carefully
  with the cuff of his sleeve, and looked at it with interest. 'Richardus III.
  Ang. Rex.,' he read aloud.</p>

  <p>'You're the first person to have noticed that background writing,' Grant
  said.</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose it isn't visible unless you look into it. You're the
  first person I ever met who had a king for a pin-up.'</p>

  <p>'No beauty, is he.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' said the boy slowly. 'It's not a bad face, as faces go. I
  had a prof. at college who looked rather like him. He lived on bismuth and
  glasses of milk so he had a slightly jaundiced outlook on life, but he was
  the kindest creature imaginable. Is it about Richard that you wanted
  information?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Nothing very abstruse or difficult. Just to know what the
  contemporary authority is.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that should be easy enough. It isn't very far from my own time. I
  mean my research period.&mdash;Indeed, the modern authority for Richard II
  Sir Cuthbert Oliphant stretches over both. Have you read Oliphant?' Grant
  said that he had read nothing but schoolbooks and Sir Thomas More.</p>

  <p>'More? Henry VIII's Chancellor?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'I take it that that was a bit of special pleading!'</p>

  <p>'It read to me more like a party pamphlet,' Grant said, realising for the
  first time that that was the taste that had been left in his mouth. It had
  not read like a statesman's account; it had read like a party throwaway.</p>

  <p>No, it had read like a columnist. Like a columnist who got his information
  below-stairs.</p>

  <p>'Do you know anything about Richard III?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing except that he croaked his nephews, and offered his kingdom for a
  horse. And that he had two stooges known as the Cat and the Rat.'</p>

  <p>'What!'</p>

  <p>'You know: "The Cat, the Rat, and Lovel Our Dog, Rule all England under a
  Hog".'</p>

  <p>'Yes of course. I'd forgotten that. What does it mean, do you know?'</p>

  <p>'No, I've no idea. I don't know that period very well. How did you get
  interested in Richard III?'</p>

  <p>'Marta suggested that I should do some academic investigating, since I
  can't do any practical investigating for some time to come. And because I
  find faces interesting she brought me portraits of all the principals.
  Principals in the various mysteries she suggested, I mean. Richard got in
  more or less by accident, but he proved the biggest mystery of the lot.'</p>

  <p>'He did? In what way?'</p>

  <p>'He is the author of the most revolting crime in history, and he has the
  face of a great judge; a great administrator. Moreover he was by all accounts
  an abnormally civilised and well-living creature. He actually was a good
  administrator, by the way. He governed the North of England and did it
  excellently. He was a good staff officer and a good soldier. And nothing is
  known against his private life. His brother, perhaps you know, was&mdash;bar
  Charles II&mdash;our most wench-ridden royal product.'</p>

  <p>'Edward IV. Yes, I know. A six-foot hunk of male beauty. Perhaps Richard
  suffered from a resentment at the contrast. And that accounts for his
  willingness to blot out his brother's seed.'</p>

  <p>This was something that Grant had not thought of.</p>

  <p>'You're suggesting that Richard had a suppressed hate for his
  brother?'</p>

  <p>'Why suppressed?'</p>

  <p>'Because even his worst detractors admit that he was devoted to Edward.
  They were together in everything from the time that Richard was twelve or
  thirteen. The other brother was no good to anyone. George.'</p>

  <p>'Who was George?'</p>

  <p>'The Duke of Clarence.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Him! Butt-of-malmsey Clarence.'</p>

  <p>'That's the one. So there were just the two of them Edward and Richard I
  mean. And there was a ten-year gap in their ages. Just the right difference
  for hero-worship.'</p>

  <p>'If I were a hunchback,' young Carradine said musingly, 'I sure would hate
  a brother who took my credit and my women and my place in the sun.'</p>

  <p>'It's possible,' Grant said after an interval. 'It's the best explanation
  I've come on so far.'</p>

  <p>'It mightn't have been an overt thing at all, you know. It mightn't have
  even been a conscious thing. It may just have all boiled up in him when he
  saw the chance of a crown. He may have said&mdash;I mean his blood may have
  said: "Here's my chance! All those years of fetching and carrying and
  standing one pace in the rear, and no thanks for them. Here's where I take my
  pay. Here's where I settle accounts".'</p>

  <p>Grant noticed that by sheer chance Carradine had used the same imagined
  description of Richard as Miss Payne-Ellis. Standing one pace in the rear.
  That is how the novelist had seen him, standing with the fair, solid Margaret
  and George, on the steps of Baynard's Castle watching their father go away to
  war. One pace in the rear, 'as usual'.</p>

  <p>'That's very interesting, though, what you say about Richard being
  apparently a good sort up to the time of the crime,' Carradine said, propping
  one leg of his horn-rims with a long forefinger in his characteristic
  gesture. 'Makes him more of a person. That Shakespeare version of him, you
  know, that's just a caricature. Not a man at all. I'll be very pleased to do
  any investigating you want, Mr Grant. It'll make a nice change from the
  peasants.'</p>

  <p>'The Cat and the Rat instead of John Ball and Wat Tyler.'</p>

  <p>'That's it.'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's very nice of you. I'd be glad of anything you can rake up. But
  at the moment all I pine for is a contemporary account of events. They must
  have been country-rocking events. I want to read a contemporary's account of
  them. Not what someone heard-tell about events that happened when he was
  five, and under another régime altogether.'</p>

  <p>'I'll find out who the contemporary historian is. Fabyan, perhaps. Or is
  he Henry VII? Anyway, I'll find out. And meanwhile perhaps you'd like a look
  at Oliphant. He's the modern authority on the period, or so I
  understand.'</p>

  <p>Grant said that he would be delighted to take a look at Sir Cuthbert.</p>

  <p>'I'll drop him in when I'm passing tomorrow&mdash;I suppose it'll be all
  right if I leave him in the office for you? and as soon as I find out about
  the contemporary writers I'll be in with the news. That suit you?'</p>

  <p>Grant said that that was perfect.</p>

  <p>Young Carradine went suddenly shy, reminding Grant of the woolly lamb
  which he had quite forgotten in the interest of this new approach to Richard.
  He said goodnight in a quiet smothered way, and ambled out of the room
  followed by the sweeping skirts of his topcoat.</p>

  <p>Grant thought that, the Carradine fortune apart, Atlanta Shergold looked
  like being on a good thing.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">'WELL,' said Marta when she came again, 'what did you think
  of my woolly lamb?'</p>

  <p>'It was <i>very</i> kind of you to find him for me.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't have to find him. He's continually underfoot. He practically
  lives at the theatre. He must have seen <i>To Sea in a Bowl</i> five hundred
  times; when he isn't in Atlanta's dressing-room he's in front. I wish they'd
  get married, and then we might see less of him. (They're not even living
  together, you know. It's all pure idyll.') She dropped her 'actress' voice
  for a moment and said: 'They're rather sweet together. In some ways they are
  more like twins than lovers. They have that utter trust in each other; that
  dependence on the other half to make a proper whole. And they never have rows
  or even quarrels, that I can see. An idyll, as I said. Was it Brent who
  brought you this?'</p>

  <p>She poked the solid bulk of Oliphant with a doubtful finger.</p>

  <p>'Yes, he left it with the porter for me.'</p>

  <p>'It looks very indigestible.'</p>

  <p>'A bit unappetising, let us say. It is quite easily digested once you have
  swallowed it. History for the student. Set out in detailed fact.'</p>

  <p>'Ugh!'</p>

  <p>'At least I've discovered where the revered and sainted Sir Thomas More
  got his account of Richard.'</p>

  <p>'Yes? Where?'</p>

  <p>'From one John Morton.'</p>

  <p>'Never heard of him.'</p>

  <p>'Neither did I, but that's our ignorance.'</p>

  <p>'Who was he?'</p>

  <p>'He was Henry VII's Archbishop of Canterbury. And Richard's bitterest
  enemy.'</p>

  <p>If Marta had been capable of whistling, she would have whistled in
  comment.</p>

  <p>'So <i>that</i> was the horse's mouth!' she said.</p>

  <p>'That was the horse's mouth. And it is on that account of Richard that all
  the later ones were built. It is on that story that Holinshed fashioned his
  history, and on that story that Shakespeare fashioned his character.'</p>

  <p>'So it is the version of someone who hated Richard. I didn't know that.
  Why did the sainted Sir Thomas report Morton rather than someone else?'</p>

  <p>'Whoever he reported, it would be a Tudor version. But he reported Morton,
  it seems, because he had been in Morton's household as a boy. And of course
  Morton had been very much "in on the act", so it was natural to write down
  the version of an eyewitness whose account he could have at first hand.'</p>

  <p>Marta poked her finger at Oliphant again. 'Does your dull fat historian
  acknowledge that it is a biased version?'</p>

  <p>'Oliphant? Only by implication. He is, to be honest, in a sad muddle
  himself about Richard. On the same page he says that he was an admirable
  administrator and general, with an excellent reputation, staid and
  good-living, very popular by contrast with the Woodville upstarts (the
  Queen's relations) and that he was "perfectly unscrupulous and ready to wade
  through any depth of bloodshed to the crown which lay within his grasp". On
  one page he says grudgingly: "There are reasons for supposing that he was not
  destitute of a conscience" and then on a later page reports More's picture of
  a man so tormented by his own deed that he could not sleep. And so on.'</p>

  <p>'Does your dull fat Oliphant prefer his roses red, then?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I don't think so. I don't think he is consciously Lancastrian. Though
  now that I think of it he is very tolerant of Henry VII's usurpation. I can't
  remember his saying anywhere, brutally, that Henry hadn't a vestige of a
  shadow of a claim to the throne.'</p>

  <p>'Who put him there, then? Henry, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'The Lancastrian remnant and the upstart Woodvilles, backed, I suppose, by
  a country revolted by the boys' murder. Apparently anyone with a spice of
  Lancastrian blood in their veins would do. Henry himself was canny enough to
  put "conquest" first in his claim to the throne, and his Lancaster blood
  second. "De jure belli et de jure Lancastriae." His mother was the heir of an
  illegitimate son of the third son of Edward III.'</p>

  <p>'All I know about Henry VII is that he was fantastically rich and
  fantastically mean. Do you know the lovely Kipling story about his knighting
  the craftsman not for having done beautiful work but for having saved him the
  cost of some scroll-work?'</p>

  <p>'With a rusty sword from behind the arras. You must be one of the few
  women who know their Kipling.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'm a very remarkable woman in many ways. So you are no nearer
  finding out about Richard's personality than you were?'</p>

  <p>'No. I'm as completely bewildered as Sir Cuthbert Oliphant, bless his
  heart. The only difference between us is that I know I'm bewildered and he
  doesn't seem to be aware of it.</p>

  <p>'Have you seen much of my woolly lamb?'</p>

  <p>'I've seen nothing of him since his first visit, and that's three days
  ago. I'm beginning to wonder whether he has repented of his promise.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. I'm sure not. Faithfulness is his banner and creed.'</p>

  <p>'Like Richard.'</p>

  <p>'Richard?'</p>

  <p>'His motto was: "Loyaulté me lie". Loyalty binds me.'</p>

  <p>There was a tentative tap at the door, and in answer to Grant's
  invitation, Brent Carradine appeared, hung around with topcoat as usual.</p>

  <p>'Oh! I seem to be butting in. I didn't know you were here, Miss Hallard. I
  met the Statue of Liberty in the corridor there, and she seemed to think you
  were alone, Mr Grant.'</p>

  <p>Grant identified the Statue of Liberty without difficulty. Marta said that
  she was in the act of going, and that in any case Brent was a much more
  welcome visitor than she was nowadays. She would leave them in peace to
  pursue their search for the soul of a murderer.</p>

  <p>When he had bowed her politely to the door Brent came back and sat himself
  down in the visitor's chair with exactly the same air that an Englishman
  wears when he sits down to his port after the women have left the table.
  Grant wondered if even the female-ridden American felt a subconscious relief
  at settling down to a stag party. In answer to Brent's inquiry as to how he
  was getting on with Oliphant, he said he found Sir Cuthbert admirably
  lucid.</p>

  <p>'I've discovered who the Cat and the Rat were, incidentally. They were
  entirely respectable knights of the realm: William Catesby and Richard
  Ratcliffe. Catesby was Speaker of the House of Commons, and Ratcliffe was one
  of the Commissioners of Peace with Scotland. Its odd how the very sound of
  words makes a political jingle vicious. The Hog of course was Richard's
  badge. The White Boar. Do you frequent our English pubs?'</p>

  <p>'Sure. They're one of the things I think you do better than us.'</p>

  <p>'You forgive us our plumbing for the sake of the beer at the Boar.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't go as far as to say I forgive it. I discount it, shall we
  say.'</p>

  <p>'Magnanimous of you. Well, there's something else you've got to discount.
  That theory of yours that Richard hated his brother because of the contrast
  between his beauty and Richard's hunchbacked state. According to Sir
  Cuthbert, the hunchback is a myth. So is the withered arm. It appears that he
  had no visible deformity. At least none that mattered. His left shoulder was
  lower than his right, that was all. Did you find out who the contemporary
  historian is?'</p>

  <p>'There isn't one.'</p>

  <p>'None at <i>all?</i>'</p>

  <p>Not in the sense that you mean it. There were writers who were
  contemporaries of Richard, but they wrote after his death. For the Tudors.
  Which puts them out of court. There is a monkish chronicle in Latin somewhere
  that is contemporary, but I haven't been able to get hold of it yet. One
  thing I have discovered though: that account of Richard III is called Sir
  Thomas More's not because he wrote it but because the manuscript was found
  among his papers. It was an unfinished copy of an account that appears
  elsewhere in finished form.'</p>

  <p>'Well!' Grant considered this with interest. 'You mean it was More's own
  manuscript copy?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. In his own writing. Made when he was 'bout thirty-five. In those
  days, before printing was general, manuscript copies of books were the usual
  thing.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. So, if the information came from John Morton, as it did, it is just
  as likely that the thing was written by Morton.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Which would certainly account for the&mdash;the lack of sensibility. A
  climber like Morton wouldn't be at all abashed by back-stairs gossip. Do you
  know about Morton?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'He was a lawyer turned churchman, and the greatest pluralist on record.
  He chose the Lancastrians side and stayed with it until it was clear that
  Edward IV was home and dried. Then he made his peace with the York side and
  Edward made him Bishop of Ely. And vicar of God knows how many parishes
  besides. But after Richard's accession he backed first the Woodvilles and
  then Henry Tudor and ended up with a cardinal's hat as Henry VII's Archbishop
  of&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Wait a minute!' said the boy, amused. 'Of <i>course</i> I know Morton. He
  was Morton of "Morton's Fork". "You can't be spending much so how about
  something for the King; you're spending such a lot you must be very rich so
  how about something for the King?"'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That Morton. Henry's best thumbscrew. And I've just thought of a
  reason why he might have a personal hatred for Richard long before the murder
  of the boys.'</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'Edward took a large bribe from Louis XI to make a dishonourable peace in
  France. Richard was very angry about that&mdash;it really was a disgraceful
  affair&mdash;and washed his hands of the business. Which included refusing a
  large cash offer. But Morton was very much in favour both of the deal and the
  cash. Indeed he took a pension from Louis. A very nice pension it was. Two
  thousand crowns a year. I don't suppose Richard's outspoken comments went
  down very well, even with good gold for a chaser.'</p>

  <p>'No. I guess not.'</p>

  <p>'And of course there would be no preferment for Morton under the
  straight-laced Richard as there had been under the easy-going Edward. So he
  would have taken the Woodville side, even if there had been no murder.'</p>

  <p>'About that murder&mdash;' the boy said; and paused.</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'About the murder the murder of those two boys&mdash;isn't it odd that no
  one talks of it?'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean: no one talks of it?'</p>

  <p>'These last three days I've been going through contemporary papers:
  letters and what not. And no one mentions them at all.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps they were afraid to. It was a time when it paid to be
  discreet.'</p>

  <p>'Yes: but I'll tell you something even odder. You know that Henry brought
  a Bill of Attainder against Richard, after Bosworth. Before Parliament. I
  mean. Well, he accuses Richard of cruelty and tyranny but doesn't even
  mention the murder.'</p>

  <p>'What!' said Grant, startled.</p>

  <p>'Yes, you may look startled.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure?'</p>

  <p>'Quite sure.'</p>

  <p>'But Henry got possession of the Tower immediately on his arrival in
  London after Bosworth. If the boys were missing it is incredible that he
  should not publish the fact immediately. It was the trump card in his hand.'
  He lay in surprised silence for a little, The sparrows on the window-sill
  quarrelled loudly. 'I can't make sense of it.' he said. 'What possible
  explanation can there be for his omission to make capital out of the fact
  that the boys were missing?'</p>

  <p>Brent shifted his long legs to a more comfortable position. 'There is only
  one explanation,' he said. 'And that is that the boys weren't missing.'</p>

  <p>There was a still longer silence this time, while they stared at each
  other.</p>

  <p>'Oh, no, it's nonsense,' Grant said. 'There must be some obvious
  explanation that we are failing to see.'</p>

  <p>'As what, for instance?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. I haven't had time to think.'</p>

  <p>'I've had nearly three days to think, and I still haven't thought up a
  reason that will fit. <i>Nothing</i> will fit the facts except the conclusion
  that the boys were alive when Henry took over the Tower. It was a completely
  unscrupulous Act of Attainder; it accused Richard's followers&mdash;the loyal
  followers of an anointed King fighting against an invader&mdash;of treason.
  Every accusation that Henry could possibly make with any hope of getting away
  with it was put into that Bill. And the very worst he could accuse Richard of
  was the usual cruelty and tyranny. The boys aren't even mentioned.'</p>

  <p>'It's fantastic.'</p>

  <p>'It's unbelievable. But it is fact.'</p>

  <p>'What it means is that there was <i>no contemporary accusation at
  all</i>.'</p>

  <p>'That's about it.'</p>

  <p>'But but wait a minute. Tyrrel was hanged for the murder. He actually
  confessed to it before he died. Wait a minute.' He reached for Oliphant and
  sped through the pages looking for the place. 'There's a full account of it
  here somewhere. There was no mystery about it. Even the Statue of Liberty
  knew about it.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Who?</i>'</p>

  <p>'The nurse you met in the corridor. It was Tyrrel who committed the murder
  and he was found guilty and confessed before his death.'</p>

  <p>Was that when Henry took over in London, then?'</p>

  <p>'Wait a moment. Here it is.' He skimmed down the paragraph. 'No, it was in
  1502.' He realised all of a sudden what he had just said, and repeated in a
  new, bewildered tone: 'In&mdash;1502.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;but&mdash;but that was&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Nearly twenty years afterwards.'</p>

  <p>Brent fumbled for his cigarette case, took it out, and then put it hastily
  away again.</p>

  <p>'Smoke if you like,' Grant said. 'It's a good stiff drink I need. I don't
  think my brain can be working very well. I feel the way I used to feel as a
  child when I was blindfolded and whirled round before beginning a
  blindman's-buff game.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Carradine. He took out a cigarette and lighted it. 'Completely
  in the dark, and more than a little dizzy.'</p>

  <p>He sat staring at the sparrows.</p>

  <p>'Forty million schoolbooks can't be wrong,' Grant said after a little.</p>

  <p>'Can't they?'</p>

  <p>'Well, can they!'</p>

  <p>'I used to think so, but I'm not so sure nowadays.'</p>

  <p>'Aren't you being a little sudden in your scepticism?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it wasn't this that shook me.'</p>

  <p>'What then?'</p>

  <p>'A little affair called the Boston Massacre. Ever heard of it?'</p>

  <p>'Of course.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I discovered quite by accident, when I was looking up something at
  college, that the Boston Massacre consisted of a mob throwing stones at a
  sentry. The total casualties were four. I was brought up on the Boston
  Massacre, Mr Grant. My twenty-eight-inch chest used to swell at the very
  memory of it. My good red spinach-laden blood used to seethe at the thought
  of helpless civilians mowed down by the fire of British troops. You can't
  imagine what a shock it was to find that all it added up to in actual fact
  was a brawl that wouldn't get more than local reporting in a clash between
  police and strikers in any American lock-out.'</p>

  <p>As Grant made no reply to this, he squinted his eyes against the light to
  see how Grant was taking it. But Grant was staring at the ceiling as if he
  were watching patterns forming there.</p>

  <p>'That's partly why I like to research so much,' Carradine volunteered; and
  settled back to staring at the sparrows.</p>

  <p>Presently Grant put his hand out, wordlessly, and Carradine gave him a
  cigarette and lighted it for him.</p>

  <p>They smoked in silence.</p>

  <p>It was Grant who interrupted the sparrows' performance.</p>

  <p>'Tonypandy,' he said.</p>

  <p>'How's that?'</p>

  <p>But Grant was still far away.</p>

  <p>'After all, I've seen the thing at work in my own day, haven't I,' he
  said, not to Carradine but to the ceiling. 'It's Tonypandy.'</p>

  <p>'And what in heck is Tonypandy?' Brent asked. 'It sounds like a patent
  medicine. Does your child get out of sorts? Does the little face get flushed,
  the temper short, and the limbs easily tired? Give the little one Tonypandy,
  and see the radiant results.' And then, as Grant made no answer: 'All right,
  then; keep your Tonypandy. I wouldn't have it as a gift.'</p>

  <p>'Tonypandy,' Grant said, still in that sleepwalking voice, 'is a place in
  the South of Wales.'</p>

  <p>'I knew it was some kind of physic.'</p>

  <p>'If you go to South Wales you will hear that, in 1910, the Government used
  troops to shoot down Welsh miners who were striking for their rights. You'll
  probably hear that Winston Churchill, who was Home Secretary at the time, was
  responsible. South Wales, you will be told, will never forget Tonypandy!'</p>

  <p>Carradine had dropped his flippant air.</p>

  <p>'And it wasn't a bit like that?'</p>

  <p>'The actual facts are these. The rougher section of the Rhondda valley
  crowd had got quite out of hand. Shops were being looted and property
  destroyed. The Chief Constable of Glamorgan sent a request to the Home Office
  for troops to protect the lieges. If a Chief Constable thinks a situation
  serious enough to ask for the help of the military a Home Secretary has very
  little choice in the matter. But Churchill was so horrified at the
  possibility of the troops coming face to face with a crowd of rioters and
  having to fire on them, that he stopped the movement of the troops and sent
  instead a body of plain, solid Metropolitan Police, armed with nothing but
  their rolled-up mackintoshes. The troops were kept in reserve, and all
  contact with the rioters was made by unarmed London police. The only
  bloodshed in the whole affair was a bloody nose or two. The Home Secretary
  was severely criticised in the House of Commons incidentally for his
  "unprecedented intervention". That was Tonypandy. That is the shooting-down
  by troops that Wales will never forget.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Carradine said, considering. 'Yes. It's almost a parallel to the
  Boston affair. Someone blowing up a simple affair to huge proportions for a
  political end.'</p>

  <p>'The point is not that it is a parallel. The point is that <i>every
  single</i> man who was there knows that the story is nonsense, and yet it has
  never been contradicted. It will never be overtaken now. It is a completely
  untrue story grown to legend while the men who knew it to be untrue looked on
  and said nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That's very interesting; very. History as it is made.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. History.'</p>

  <p>'Give me research. After all, the truth of anything at all doesn't lie in
  someone's account of it. It lies in all the small facts of the time. An
  advertisement in a paper. The sale of a house. The price of a ring.'</p>

  <p>Grant went on looking at the ceiling, and the sparrows' clamour came back
  into the room.</p>

  <p>'What amuses you?' Grant said, turning his head at last and catching the
  expression on his visitor's face.</p>

  <p>'This is the first time I've seen you look like a policeman.'</p>

  <p>'I'm feeling like a policeman. I'm thinking like a policeman. I'm asking
  myself the question that every policeman asks in every case of murder: Who
  benefits? And for the first time it occurs to me that the glib theory that
  Richard got rid of the boys to make himself safer on the throne is so much
  nonsense. Supposing he had got rid of the boys. There were still the boys'
  five sisters between him and the throne. To say nothing of George's two: the
  boy and girl. George's son and daughter were barred by their father's
  attainder; but I take it that an attainder can be reversed, or annulled, or
  something. If Richard's claim was shaky, all those lives stood between him
  and safety.'</p>

  <p>'And did they all survive him?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. But I shall make it my business to find out. The boys'
  eldest sister certainly did because she became Queen of England as Henry's
  wife.'</p>

  <p>'Look, Mr Grant, let's you and I start at the very beginning of this
  thing. Without history books, or modern versions, or anyone's opinion about
  anything. Truth isn't in accounts but in account books.'</p>

  <p>'A neat phrase,' Grant said, complimentary. 'Does it mean anything?'</p>

  <p>'It means everything. The real history is written in forms not meant as
  history. In Wardrobe accounts, in Privy Purse expenses, in personal letters,
  in estate books. If someone, say, insists that Lady Whoosit never had a
  child, and you find in the account book the entry: "For the son born to my
  lady on Michaelmas eve: five yards of blue ribbon, fourpence halfpenny" it's
  a reasonably fair deduction that my lady had a son on Michaelmas eve.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I see. All right, where do we begin?'</p>

  <p>'You're the investigator. I'm only the looker-upper.'</p>

  <p>'Research Worker.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks. What do you want to know?'</p>

  <p>'Well, for a start, it would be useful, not to say enlightening, to know
  how the principals in the case reacted to Edward's death. Edward IV, I mean.
  Edward died unexpectedly, and his death must have caught everyone on the hop.
  I'd like to know how the people concerned reacted.'</p>

  <p>'That's straight forward and easy. I take it you mean what they did and
  not what they thought.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Only historians tell you what they thought. Research Workers stick to
  what they did.'</p>

  <p>'What they did is all I want to know. I've always been a believer in the
  old saw that actions speak louder than words.'</p>

  <p>'Incidentally, what does the sainted Sir Thomas say that Richard did when
  he heard that his brother was dead?' Brent wanted to know.</p>

  <p>'The sainted Sir Thomas (alias John Morton) says that Richard got busy
  being charming to the Queen and persuading her not to send a large bodyguard
  to escort the boy prince from Ludlow; meanwhile cooking up a plot to kidnap
  the boy on his way to London.'</p>

  <p>'According to the sainted More, then, Richard meant from the very first to
  supplant the boy.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes.'</p>

  <p>'Well, we shall find out, at least, who was where and doing what, whether
  we can deduce their intentions or not.'</p>

  <p>'That's what I want. Exactly.'</p>

  <p>'Policeman!' jibed the boy. '"Where were you at five p.m. on the night of
  the fifteenth inst?"'</p>

  <p>'It works,' Grant assured him. 'It works.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'll go away and work too. I'll be in again as soon as I have got
  the information you want. I'm very grateful to you, Mr Grant. This is a lot
  better than the Peasants.'</p>

  <p>He floated away into the gathering dusk of the winter afternoon, his
  train-like coat giving an academic sweep and dignity to his thin young
  figure.</p>

  <p>Grant switched on his lamp, and examined the pattern it made on the
  ceiling as if he had never seen it before.</p>

  <p>It was a unique and engaging problem that the boy had dropped so casually
  into his lap. As unexpected as it was baffling.</p>

  <p>What possible reason could there be for that lack of contemporary
  accusation?</p>

  <p>Henry had not even needed proof that Richard was himself responsible. The
  boys were in Richard's care. If they were not to be found when the Tower was
  taken over, then that was far finer, thicker mud to throw at his dead rival
  than the routine accusations of cruelty and tyranny.</p>

  <p>Grant ate his supper without for one moment being conscious either of its
  taste or its nature.</p>

  <p>It was only when The Amazon, taking away his tray, said kindly: 'Come now,
  that's a very good sign. Both rissoles all eaten up to the last crumb!' that
  he became aware that he had partaken of a meal.</p>

  <p>For another hour he watched the lamp-pattern on the ceiling, going over
  the thing in his mind; going round and round it looking for some small crack
  that might indicate a way into the heart of the matter.</p>

  <p>In the end he withdrew his attention altogether from the problem, which
  was his habit when a conundrum proved too round and smooth and solid for
  immediate solution. If he slept on the proposition it might, tomorrow, show a
  facet that he had missed.</p>

  <p>He looked for something that might stop his mind from harking back to that
  Act of Attainder, and saw the pile of letters waiting to be acknowledged.
  Kind, well-wishing letters from all sorts of people; including a few old
  lags. The really likable old lags were an outmoded type, growing fewer and
  fewer daily. Their place had been taken by brash young thugs with not a spark
  of humanity in their egocentric souls, as illiterate as puppies and as
  pitiless as a circular saw. The old professorial burglar was apt to be as
  individual as the member of any other profession, and as little vicious.
  Quiet little domestic men, interested in family holidays and the children's
  tonsils; or odd bachelors devoted to cage-birds, or second-hand bookshops, or
  complicated and infallible betting systems. Old-fashioned types.</p>

  <p>No modern thug would write to say that he was sorry that a 'busy' was laid
  aside. No such idea would ever cross a modern thug's mind.</p>

  <p>Writing a letter when lying on one's back is a laborious business, and
  Grant shied away from it. But the top envelope on the pile bore the writing
  of his cousin Laura, and Laura would become anxious if she had no answer at
  all from him. Laura and he had shared summer holidays as children, and had
  been a little in love with each other all through one Highland summer, and
  that made a bond between them that had never been broken. He had better send
  Laura a note to say that he was alive.</p>

  <p>He read her letter again, smiling a little; and the waters of the Turlie
  sounded in his ears and slid under his eyes, and he could smell the sweet
  cold smell of a Highland moor in winter, and he forgot for a little that he
  was a hospital patient and that life was sordid and boring and
  claustrophobic.</p>

  <p>Pat sends what would be his love if he were a little older or just a
  little younger. Being nine, he says: 'Tell Alan I was asking for him', and
  has a fly of his own invention waiting to be presented to you when you come
  on sick-leave. He is a little in disgrace at the moment in school, having
  learned for the first time that the Scots sold Charles the First to the
  English and having decided that he can no longer belong to such a nation. He
  is therefore, I understand, conducting a one-man protest strike against all
  things Scottish, and will learn no history, sing no song, nor memorise any
  geography pertaining to so deplorable a country. He announced going to bed
  last night that he has decided to apply for Norwegian citizenship.</p>

  <p>Grant took his letter pad from the table and wrote in pencil:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dearest Laura</span>,</p>

  <p class="letter">Would you be unbearably surprised to learn that the Princes
  in the Tower survived Richard III?</p>

  <p class="letter">As ever</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Alan</span></p>

  <p class="letter">P.S. I am nearly well again.</p><br>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">'DO you know that the Bill attainting Richard III before
  Parliament didn't mention the murder of the Princes in the Tower?' Grant
  asked the surgeon next morning.</p>

  <p>'Really?' said the surgeon. 'That's odd, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Extremely odd. Can you think of an explanation?'</p>

  <p>'Probably trying to minimise the scandal. For the sake of the family.'</p>

  <p>'He wasn't succeeded by one of his family. He was the last of his line.
  His successor was the first Tudor. Henry VII.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course. I'd forgotten. I was never any good at history. I used to
  use the history period to do my home algebra. They don't manage to make
  history very interesting in schools. Perhaps more portraits might help.' He
  glanced up at the Richard portrait and went back to his professional
  inspection. 'That is looking very nice and healthy, I'm glad to say. No pain
  to speak of now?'</p>

  <p>And he went away, kindly and casual. He was interested in faces because
  they were part of his trade, but history was just something that he used for
  other purposes; something that he set aside in favour of algebra under the
  desk. He had living bodies in his care, and the future in his hands; he had
  no thought to spare for problems academic.</p>

  <p>Matron, too, had more immediate worries. She listened politely while he
  put his difficulty to her, but he had the impression that she might say: 'I
  should see the almoner about it if I were you'. It was not her affair. She
  looked down from her regal eminence at the great hive below her buzzing with
  activity, all of it urgent and important; she could hardly be expected to
  focus her gaze on something more than four hundred years away.</p>

  <p>He wanted to say: 'But you of all people should be interested in what can
  happen to royalty; in the frailness of your reputation's worth. Tomorrow a
  whisper may destroy you.' But he was already guiltily conscious that to
  hinder a Matron with irrelevances was to lengthen her already lengthy morning
  round without reason or excuse.</p>

  <p>The Midget did not know what an Attainder was, and made it clear that she
  did not care.</p>

  <p>'It's becoming an obsession with you, that thing,' she said, leaning her
  head at the portrait. 'It's not healthy. Why don't you read some of those
  nice books?'</p>

  <p>Even Marta, whose visit he had looked forward to so that he could put this
  odd, new proposition to her and see her reaction, even Marta was too full of
  wrath with Madeleine March to pay any attention to him.</p>

  <p>'After practically promising me that she would write it! After all our
  get-together and my plans for when this endless thing finally comes to an
  end. I had even talked to Jacques about clothes! And now she decides that she
  must write one of her awful little detective stories. She says she must write
  it while it is fresh&mdash;whatever that is.'</p>

  <p>He listened to Marta's grieving with sympathy&mdash;good plays were the
  scarcest commodity in the world and good playwrights worth their weight in
  platinum&mdash;but it was like watching something through a window. The
  fifteenth century was more actual to him this morning than any on-goings in
  Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>

  <p>'I don't suppose it will take her long to write her detective book,' he
  said comfortingly.</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. She does them in six weeks or so. But now that she's off the
  chain how do I know that I'll ever get her on again. Tony Savilla wants her
  to write a Marlborough play for him, and you know what Tony is when he sets
  his heart on something. He'd talk the pigeons off the Admiralty Arch.'</p>

  <p>She came back to the Attainder problem, briefly, before she took her
  leave.</p>

  <p>'There's sure to be some explanation, my dear,' she said from the
  door.</p>

  <p>Of <i>course</i> there's an explanation, he wanted to shout after her, but
  what is it? The thing is against all likelihood and sense. Historians say
  that the murder caused a great revulsion of feeling against Richard, that he
  was hated for the crime by the common people of England, and that was why
  they welcomed a stranger in his place. And yet when the tale of his
  wrongdoing is placed before Parliament there is no mention of the crime.</p>

  <p>Richard was dead when that complaint was drawn up, and his followers in
  flight or exile; his enemies were free to bring against him any charge they
  could think of. And they <i>had not thought of that spectacular
  murder</i>.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>The country was reputedly ringing with the scandal of the boys'
  disappearance. The very recent scandal. And when his enemies collected his
  alleged offences against morality and the State they had not included
  Richard's most spectacular piece of infamy.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>Henry needed every small featherweight of advantage in the precarious
  newness of his accession. He was unknown to the country at large and he had
  no right by blood to be where he was. But he hadn't used the overwhelming
  advantage that Richard's published crime would have given him.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>He was succeeding a man of great reputation, known personally to the
  people from the Marches of Wales to the Scots border, a man universally liked
  and admired until the disappearance of his nephews. And yet he omitted to use
  the one real advantage he had against Richard, the unforgivable, the abhorred
  thing.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>Only The Amazon seemed concerned about the oddity that was engaging his
  mind; and she not out of any feeling for Richard but because her
  conscientious soul was distressed at any possibility of mistake. The Amazon
  would go all the way down the corridor and back again to tear off a page in a
  loose-leaf calendar that someone had forgotten to remove. But her instinct to
  be worried was less strong than her instinct to comfort.</p>

  <p>'You don't need to worry about it,' she said, soothing. 'There'll be some
  quite simple explanation that you haven't thought of. It'll come to you
  sometime when you're thinking of something else altogether. That's usually
  how I remember where something I've mislaid is. I'll be putting the kettle on
  in the pantry, or counting the sterile dressings as Sister doles them out,
  and suddenly I'll think: "Goodness, I left it in my burberry pocket."
  Whatever the thing was, I mean. So you don't have to worry about it.'</p>

  <p>Sergeant Williams was in the wilds of Essex helping the local constabulary
  to decide who had hit an old shopkeeper over the head with a brass
  scale-weight and left her dead among the shoelaces and liquorice all-sorts,
  so there was no help from the Yard.</p>

  <p>There was no help from anyone until young Carradine turned up again three
  days later. Grant thought that his normal insouciance had a deeper tinge than
  usual; there was almost an air of self-congratulation about him. Being a
  well-brought-up child he inquired politely about Grant's physical progress,
  and having been reassured on that point he pulled some notes out of the
  capacious pocket of his coat and beamed through his horn-rims at his
  colleague.</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't have the sainted More as a present,' he observed
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>'You're not being offered him. There are no takers.'</p>

  <p>'He's away off the beam. Away off.'</p>

  <p>'I suspected as much. Let us have the facts. Can you begin on the day
  Edward died?'</p>

  <p>'Sure. Edward died on April the 9th 1483. In London. I mean, in
  Westminster; which wasn't the same thing then. The Queen and the daughters
  were living there, <i>and</i> the younger boy, I think. The young Prince was
  doing lessons at Ludlow Castle in charge of the Queen's brother, Lord Rivers.
  The Queen's relations are very much to the fore, did you know? The place is
  just lousy with Woodvilles.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I know. Go on. Where was Richard?'</p>

  <p>'On the Scottish border.'</p>

  <p>'What!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I said: on the Scottish border. Caught away off base. But does he
  yell for a horse and go posting off to London? He does not.'</p>

  <p>'What did he do?'</p>

  <p>'He arranged for a requiem mass at York, to which all the nobility of the
  North were summoned, and in his presence took an oath of loyalty to the young
  Prince.'</p>

  <p>'Interesting,' Grant said dryly. 'What did Rivers do? The Queen's
  brother?'</p>

  <p>'On the 24th of April he set out with the Prince for London. With two
  thousand men and a large supply of arms.'</p>

  <p>'What did he want the arms for?'</p>

  <p>'Don't ask me. I'm only a Research Worker. Dorset, the elder of the
  Queen's two sons by her first marriage, took over both the arsenal and the
  treasure in the Tower and began to fit up ships to command the Channel. And
  Council orders were issued <i>in the name of Rivers and
  Dorset</i>&mdash;"avunculus Regis" and "frater Regis uterinus"
  respectively&mdash;with no mention of Richard. Which was decidedly off-colour
  when you remember&mdash;if you ever knew&mdash;that in his will Edward had
  appointed Richard guardian of the boy and Protector of the Kingdom in case of
  any minority. Richard alone, mind you, without a colleague.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is in character, at least. He must always have had complete
  faith in Richard. Both as a person and as an administrator. Did Richard come
  south with a young army too?'</p>

  <p>'No. He came with six hundred gentlemen of the North, all in deep
  mourning. He arrived at Northampton on April the 29th. He had apparently
  expected to join up with the Ludlow crowd there; but that is report and you
  have only a historian's word for it. But the Ludlow procession&mdash;Rivers
  and the young Prince&mdash;had gone on to Stoney Stratford without waiting
  for him. The person who actually met him at Northampton was the Duke of
  Buckingham with three hundred men. Do you know Buckingham?'</p>

  <p>'We have a nodding acquaintance. He was a friend of Edward's.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He arrived post haste from London.'</p>

  <p>'With the news of what was going on.'</p>

  <p>'It's a fair deduction. He wouldn't bring three hundred men just to
  express his condolences. Anyhow a Council was held there and then&mdash;he
  had all the material for a proper Council in his own train and Buckingham's,
  and Rivers and his three aides were arrested and sent to the North, while
  Richard went on with the young Prince to London. They arrived in London on
  the 4th of May.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that is very nice and clear. And what is clearest of all is that,
  considering time and distances, the sainted More's account of his writing
  sweet letters to the Queen to induce her to send only a small escort for the
  boy, is nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'Bunk.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed, Richard did just what one would expect him to do. He must of
  course have known the provisions of Edward's will. What his actions suggest
  is just what one would expect them to suggest; his own sorrow and his care
  for the boy. A requiem mass and an oath of allegiance.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Where does the break in this orthodox pattern come? I mean: in Richard's
  behaviour.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, not for a long time. When he arrived in London he found that the
  Queen, the younger boy, the daughters, and her first-marriage son, Dorset,
  had all bolted into sanctuary at Westminster. But apart from that things seem
  to have been normal.'</p>

  <p>'Did he take the boy to the Tower?'</p>

  <p>Carradine riffled through his notes. 'I don't remember. Perhaps I didn't
  get that. I was only&mdash;Oh, yes, here it is. No, he took the boy to the
  Bishop's Palace in St Paul's Churchyard, and he himself went to stay with his
  mother at Baynard's Castle. Do you know where that was? I don't.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It was the Yorks' town house. It stood on the bank of the river just
  a little way west of St Paul's.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Well, he stayed there until June the 5th, when his wife arrived from
  the North and they went to stay in a house called Crosby Place.'</p>

  <p>'It is still called Crosby Place. It has been moved to Chelsea, and the
  window Richard put into it may not still be there&mdash;I haven't seen it
  lately&mdash;but the building is there.'</p>

  <p>'It is?' Carradine said, delighted. 'I'll go and see it right away. It's a
  very domestic tale when you think of it, isn't it. Staying with his mother
  until his wife gets to town, and then moving in with her. Was Crosby Place
  theirs, then?'</p>

  <p>'Richard had leased it, I think. It belonged to one of the Aldermen of
  London. So there is no suggestion of opposition to his Protectorship, or of
  change of plans, when he arrived in London.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. He was acknowledged Protector before he ever arrived in
  London.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know that?'</p>

  <p>'In the Patent Rolls he is called Protector on two occasions&mdash;let me
  see&mdash;April 21st (that's less than a fortnight after Edward's death) and
  May the 2nd (that's two days before he arrived in London at all.)'</p>

  <p>'All right; I'm sold. And no fuss? No hint of trouble?'</p>

  <p>'Not that I can find. On the 5th of June he gave detailed orders for the
  boy's coronation on the 22nd. He even had letters of summons sent out to the
  forty squires who would be made knights of the Bath. It seems it was the
  custom for the King to knight them on the occasion of his coronation.'</p>

  <p>'The 5th,' Grant said musingly. 'And he fixed the coronation for the 22nd.
  He wasn't leaving himself much time for a switch-over.'</p>

  <p>'No. There's even a record of the order for the boy's coronation
  clothes.'</p>

  <p>'And then what?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' Carradine said, apologetic, 'that's as far as I've got. Something
  happened at a Council&mdash;on the 8th of June, I think&mdash;but the
  contemporary account is in the <i>Mémoires</i> of Philippe de Comines and I
  haven't been able to get hold of a copy so far. But someone has promised to
  let me see a copy of Mandrot's 1901 printing of it tomorrow. It seems that
  the Bishop of Bath broke some news to the Council on June the 8th. Do you
  know the Bishop of Bath? His name was Stillington.'</p>

  <p>'Never heard of him.'</p>

  <p>'He was a Fellow of All Souls, whatever that is, and a Canon of York,
  whatever that may be.'</p>

  <p>'Both learned and respectable, it appears.'</p>

  <p>'Well, we'll see.'</p>

  <p>'Have you turned up any contemporary historians&mdash;other than
  Comines?'</p>

  <p>'Not any, so far, who wrote before Richard's death. Comines has a French
  bias but not a Tudor one, so he's more trustworthy than an Englishman writing
  about Richard under the Tudors would be. But I've got a lovely sample for you
  of how history is made. I found it when I was looking up the contemporary
  writers. You know that one of the things they tell about Richard III is that
  he killed Henry VI's only son in cold blood after the battle of Tewkesbury?
  Well, believe it or not, that story is made up out of whole cloth. You can
  trace it from the very time it was first told. It's the perfect answer to
  people who say there's no smoke without fire. Believe me this smoke was made
  by rubbing two pieces of dry stick together.'</p>

  <p>'But Richard was just a boy at the time of Tewkesbury.'</p>

  <p>'He was eighteen, I think. And a very bonny fighter by all contemporary
  accounts. They were the same age, Henry's son and Richard. Well, <i>all</i>
  the contemporary accounts, of whatever complexion, are unanimous in saying
  that he was killed during the battle. Then the fun begins.'</p>

  <p>Carradine fluttered through his notes impatiently.</p>

  <p>'Goldarn it, what did I do with it? Ah. Here we are. Now. Fabyan, writing
  for Henry VII, says that the boy was captured and brought before Edward IV,
  was struck in the face by Edward with his gauntlet and immediately slain by
  the King's servants. Nice? But Polydore Virgil goes one better. He says that
  the murder was done in person by George, Duke of Clarence, Richard, Duke of
  Gloucester, and William, Lord Hastings. Hall adds Dorset to the murderers.
  But that didn't satisfy Holinshed: Holinshed reports that it was Richard Duke
  of Gloucester who struck the first blow. How do you like that? Best quality
  Tonypandy, isn't it.'</p>

  <p>'Pure Tonypandy. A dramatic story with not a word of truth in it. If you
  can bear to listen to a few sentences of the sainted More, I'll give you
  another sample of how history is made.'</p>

  <p>'The sainted More makes me sick at the stomach but I'll listen.'</p>

  <p>Grant looked for the paragraph he wanted, and read:</p>

  <p>Some wise men also ween that his drift [that is, Richard's drift] covertly
  conveyed, lacked not in helping forth his brother Clarence to his death;
  which he resisted openly, howbeit somewhat, as men deemed, more faintly than
  he that were heartily minded to his weal. And they who deem thus think that
  he, long time in King Edward's life, forethought to be King in case that the
  King his brother (whose life he looked that evil diet should shorten) should
  happen to decease (as indeed he did) while his children were young. And they
  deem that for this intent he was glad of his brother Clarence's death, whose
  life must needs have hindered him so intending whether the same Clarence had
  kept true to his nephew the young King or enterprised to be King himself. But
  of all this point there is no certainty, and whoso divineth upon conjectures
  may as well shoot too far as too short.</p>

  <p>'The mean, burbling insinuating old dotard,' said Carradine sweetly.</p>

  <p>'Were you clever enough to pick out the one positive statement in all that
  speculation?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes.'</p>

  <p>'You spotted it? That was smart of you. I had to read it three times
  before I got the one unqualified fact.'</p>

  <p>'That Richard protested openly against his brother George being put to
  death.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Of course, with all that "men say" stuff,' Carradine observed, 'the
  impression that is left is just the opposite. I told you, I wouldn't have the
  sainted More as a present.'</p>

  <p>'I think we ought to remember that it is John Morton's account and not the
  sainted More's.'</p>

  <p>'The sainted More sounds better. Besides, he liked the thing well enough
  to be copying it out.'</p>

  <p>Grant, the one-time soldier, lay thinking of the expert handling of that
  very sticky situation at Northampton.</p>

  <p>'It was neat of him to mop up Rivers' two thousand without any open
  clash.'</p>

  <p>'I expect they preferred the King's brother to the Queen's brother, if
  they were faced with it.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. And of course a fighting man has a better chance with troops than a
  man who writes books.'</p>

  <p>'Did Rivers write books?'</p>

  <p>'He wrote the first book printed in England. Very cultured, he was.'</p>

  <p>'Huh. It doesn't seem to have taught him not to try conclusions with a man
  who was a brigadier at eighteen and a general before he was twenty-five.
  That's one thing that has surprised me, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Richard's qualities as a soldier?'</p>

  <p>'No, his youth. I'd always thought of him as a middle-aged grouch. He was
  only thirty-two when he was killed at Bosworth.'</p>

  <p>'Tell me: when Richard took over the boy's guardianship, at Stoney
  Stratford, did he make a clean sweep of the Ludlow crowd? I mean, was the boy
  separated from all the people he had been growing up with?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. His tutor, Dr Alcock, came on to London with him, for one.'</p>

  <p>'So there was no panic clearing-out of everyone who might be on the
  Woodville side; everyone who might influence the boy against him.'</p>

  <p>'Seems not. Just the four arrests.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. A very neat, discriminating operation altogether. I felicitate
  Richard Plantagenet.'</p>

  <p>'I'm positively beginning to like the guy. Well, I'm going along now to
  look at Crosby Place. I'm tickled pink at the thought of actually looking at
  a place he lived in. And tomorrow I'll have that copy of Comines, and let you
  know what he says about events in England in 1483, and what Robert
  Stillington, Bishop of Bath, told the Council in June of that year.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">WHAT Stillington told the Council on that summer day in 1483
  was, Grant learned, that he had married Edward IV to Lady Eleanor Butler, a
  daughter of the first Earl of Shrewsbury, before Edward married Elizabeth
  Woodville. 'Why had he kept it to himself so long?' he asked when he had
  digested the news.</p>

  <p>'Edward had commanded him to keep it secret. Naturally.'</p>

  <p>'Edward seems to have made a habit of secret marriages,' Grant said
  dryly.</p>

  <p>'Well, it must have been difficult for him, you know, when he came up
  against unassailable virtue. There was nothing for it but marriage. And he
  was so used to getting his own way with women&mdash;what with his looks and
  his crown&mdash;that he couldn't have taken very resignedly to
  frustration.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That was the pattern of the Woodville marriage. The indestructibly
  virtuous beauty with the gilt hair, and the secret wedding. So Edward had
  used the same formula on a previous occasion, if Stillington's story was
  true. Was it true?'</p>

  <p>'Well, in Edward's time, it seems, he was in turn both Privy Seal and Lord
  Chancellor, and he had been an ambassador to Brittany. So Edward either owed
  him something or liked him. And he, on his part, had no reason to cook up
  anything against Edward. Supposing he was the cooking sort.'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose not.'</p>

  <p>'Anyway, the thing was put to Parliament so we don't have to take just
  Stillington's word for it.'</p>

  <p>'To Parliament!'</p>

  <p>'Sure. Everything was open and above board. There was a very long meeting
  of the Lords at Westminster on the 9th. Stillington brought in his evidence
  and his witnesses, and a report was prepared to put before Parliament when it
  assembled on the 25th. On the 10th Richard sent a letter to the city of York
  asking for troops to protect and support him.'</p>

  <p>'Ha! Trouble at last.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. On the 11th he sent a similar letter to his cousin Lord Nevill. So
  the danger was real.'</p>

  <p>'It must have been real. A man who dealt so economically with that
  unexpected and very nasty situation at Northampton wouldn't be one to lose
  his head at a threat.'</p>

  <p>'On the 20th he went with a small body of retainers to the Tower&mdash;did
  you know that the Tower was the royal residence in London, and not a prison
  at all?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I knew that. It got its prison meaning only because nowadays being
  sent to the Tower has one meaning only. And of course because, being the
  royal castle in London, and the only strong keep, offenders were sent there
  for safe keeping in the days before we had His Majesty's Prisons. What did
  Richard go to the Tower for?'</p>

  <p>'He went to interrupt a meeting of the conspirators, and arrested Lord
  Hastings, Lord Stanley, and one John Morton, Bishop of Ely.'</p>

  <p>'I thought we would arrive at John Morton sooner or later!'</p>

  <p>'A proclamation was issued, giving details of the plot to murder Richard,
  but apparently no copy now exists. Only one of the conspirators was beheaded,
  and that one, oddly enough, seems to have been an old friend of both Edward
  and Richard. Lord Hastings.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, according to the sainted More he was rushed down to the courtyard
  and beheaded on the nearest log.'</p>

  <p>'Rushed nothing,' said Carradine disgustedly. 'He was beheaded a week
  later. There's a contemporary letter about it that gives the date. Moreover,
  Richard couldn't have done it out of sheer vindictiveness, because he granted
  Hastings' forfeited estates to his widow, and restored the children's right
  of succession to them&mdash;which they had automatically lost.'</p>

  <p>'No, the death of Hastings must have been inevitable,' said Grant, who was
  thumbing through More's <i>Richard III</i>. 'Even the sainted More says:
  "Undoubtedly the Protector loved him well, and was loth to have lost him".
  What happened to Stanley and to John Morton?'</p>

  <p>'Stanley was pardoned&mdash;What are you groaning about?'</p>

  <p>'Poor Richard. That was his death warrant.'</p>

  <p>'Death warrant? How could pardoning Stanley be his death warrant?'</p>

  <p>'Because it was Stanley's sudden decision to go over to the other side
  that lost Richard the battle of Bosworth.'</p>

  <p>'You don't say.'</p>

  <p>'Odd to think that if Richard had seen to it that Stanley went to the
  block like his much-loved Hastings he would have won the battle of Bosworth,
  there would never have been any Tudors, and the hunchbacked monster that
  appears in Tudor tradition would never have been invented. On his previous
  showing he would probably have had the best and most enlightened reign in
  history. What was done to Morton?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing.'</p>

  <p>'Another mistake.'</p>

  <p>'Or at least nothing to signify. He was put into gentlemanly detention
  under the care of Buckingham. The people who did go to the block were the
  heads of the conspiracy that Richard had arrested at Northampton: Rivers and
  Co. And Jane Shore was sentenced to do penance.'</p>

  <p>'Jane Shore? What on earth has she got to do with the case? I thought she
  was Edward's mistress?'</p>

  <p>'So she was. But Hastings inherited her from Edward, it seems. Or
  rather&mdash;let me see&mdash;Dorset did. And she was go-between between the
  Hastings side of the conspiracy and the Woodville side. One of Richard's
  letters existing today is about her. About Jane Shore.'</p>

  <p>'What about her?'</p>

  <p>'His Solicitor-General wanted to marry her; when he was King, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'And he agreed?'</p>

  <p>'He agreed. It's a lovely letter. More in sorrow than in anger&mdash;With
  a kind of twinkle in it.'</p>

  <p>'"Lord, what fools these mortals be!"'</p>

  <p>'That's it exactly.'</p>

  <p>'No vindictiveness there, either, it seems.'</p>

  <p>'No. Quite the opposite. You know, I know it isn't my business to think or
  draw deductions&mdash;I'm just the Research Worker&mdash;but it does strike
  me that Richard's ambition was to put an end to the York-Lancaster fight once
  and for all.'</p>

  <p>'What makes you think that?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've been looking at his coronation lists. It was the best-attended
  coronation on record, incidentally. You can't help being struck by the fact
  that practically nobody stayed away. Lancaster or York.'</p>

  <p>'Including the weather-cock Stanley, I suppose.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose so. I don't know them well enough to remember them
  individually.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps you're right about his wanting a final end to the York-Lancaster
  feud. Perhaps his lenience with Stanley was due to that very thing.'</p>

  <p>'Was Stanley a Lancastrian, then?'</p>

  <p>'No, but he was married to an abnormally rabid one. His wife was Margaret
  Beaufort, and the Beauforts were the reverse side, so to speak&mdash;the
  illegitimate side&mdash;of the Lancaster family. Not that her by-blow side
  worried her. <i>Or</i> her son.'</p>

  <p>'Who was her son?'</p>

  <p>'Henry VII.'</p>

  <p>Carradine whistled, long and low.</p>

  <p>'You actually mean to say that Lady Stanley was Henry's mother.'</p>

  <p>'She was. By her first husband Edmund Tudor.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;but Lady Stanley had a place of honour at Richard's coronation.
  She carried the Queen's train. I noticed that because I thought it quaint.
  Carrying the train, I mean. In our country we don't carry trains. It's an
  honour, I take it.'</p>

  <p>'It's a thundering great honour. Poor Richard. Poor Richard. It didn't
  work.'</p>

  <p>'What didn't?'</p>

  <p>'Magnanimity.' He lay thinking about it while Carradine shuffled through
  his notes. 'So Parliament accepted the evidence of Stillington.'</p>

  <p>'They did more. They incorporated it into an Act, giving Richard the title
  to the crown. It was called Titulus Regius.'</p>

  <p>'For a holy man of God, Stillington wasn't cutting a very glorious figure.
  But I suppose that to have talked sooner would have been to compass his own
  ruin.'</p>

  <p>'You're a bit hard on him, aren't you? There wasn't any need to talk
  sooner. No harm was being done anyone.'</p>

  <p>'What about Lady Eleanor Butler?'</p>

  <p>'She had died in a convent. She's buried in the Church of the White
  Carmelites at Norwich, in case you're interested. As long as Edward was alive
  no wrong was being done anyone. But when it came to the question of
  succession, then he <i>had</i> to talk, whatever kind of figure he cut.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Of course you're right. So the children were proclaimed
  illegitimate, in open Parliament. And Richard was crowned. With all the
  nobility of England in attendance. Was the Queen still in sanctuary?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But she had let the younger boy join his brother.'</p>

  <p>'When was that?'</p>

  <p>Carradine searched through his notes. 'On June the 16th. I've put: "At the
  request of the Archbishop of Canterbury. Both boys living at the Tower."'</p>

  <p>'That was after the news had broken. The news that they were
  illegitimate.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' He tidied his notes into some kind of neatness and put them away in
  the enormous pocket. 'That seems to be all, to date. But here's the pay-off.'
  He gathered his train from either side of him on to his knees with a gesture
  that both Marta and King Richard might have envied. 'You know that Act, that
  Titulus Regius.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; what about it?'</p>

  <p>'Well, when Henry VII came to the throne he ordered that the Act should be
  repealed, without being read. He ordered that the Act itself should be
  destroyed, and forbade any copies to be kept. Anyone who kept a copy was to
  be fined and imprisoned during his pleasure.'</p>

  <p>Grant stared in great astonishment.</p>

  <p>'<i>Henry VII!</i>' he said. 'Why? What possible difference could it make
  to him?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't a glimmer of an idea. But I mean to find out before I'm much
  older. Meanwhile, here is something to keep you amused till the Statue of
  Liberty brings your British tea.'</p>

  <p>He dropped a paper on to Grant's chest.</p>

  <p>'What is this?' Grant said, looking at the torn-out page of a
  note-book.</p>

  <p>'It's that letter of Richard's about Jane Shore. I'll be seeing you.'</p>

  <p>Left alone by himself in the quiet, Grant turned over the page and
  read.</p>

  <p>The contrast between the sprawling childish hand-writing and the formal
  phrases of Richard's imagining was piquant in the extreme. But what neither
  the untidy modern script nor the dignified phrases could destroy was the
  flavour of the letter. The bouquet of good humour that came up from the page
  as a bouquet comes up from a good-humoured wine. Translated into modern terms
  it said:</p>

  <p>I hear to my great astonishment that Tom Lynom wants to marry Will Shore's
  wife. Apparently he is infatuated with her, and is quite determined about it.
  Do, my dear Bishop, send for him and see if you can talk some sense into his
  silly head. If you can't, and if there is no bar to their marriage from the
  Church's point of view, then I agree to it, but tell him to postpone the
  marriage till I am back in London. Meanwhile this will suffice to secure her
  release, on surety for her good behaviour, and I suggest that you hand her
  over for the time being to the care of her father, or anyone else who seems
  good to you.</p>

  <p>It was certainly, as young Carradine had said, 'more in sorrow than in
  anger'. Indeed, considering that it was written about a woman who had done
  him a deadly wrong, its kindness and good temper was remarkable. And this was
  a case where no personal advantage could come to him from magnanimity. The
  broadmindedness that had sought for a York-Lancaster peace might not have
  been disinterested; it would have been enormously to his advantage to have a
  united country to rule. But this letter to the Bishop of Lincoln was a small
  private matter, and the release of Jane Shore of no importance to anyone but
  the infatuated Tom Lynom. Richard had nothing to gain by his generosity. His
  instinct to see a friend happy was apparently greater than his instinct for
  revenge.</p>

  <p>Indeed, his instinct for revenge seemed to be lacking to a degree that
  would be surprising in any red-blooded male, and quite astonishing in the
  case of that reputed monster Richard III.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">THE letter lasted Grant very nicely until The Amazon brought
  his tea. He listened to the twentieth century sparrows on his window-sill and
  marvelled that he should be reading phrases that formed in a man's mind more
  than four hundred years ago. What a fantastic idea it would have seemed to
  Richard that anyone would be reading that short, intimate letter about
  Shore's wife, and wondering about him, four hundred years afterwards.</p>

  <p>'There's a letter for you, now isn't that nice,' The Amazon said, coming
  in with his two pieces of bread-and-butter and a rock bun.</p>

  <p>Grant took his eyes from the uncompromising healthiness of the rock bun
  and saw that the letter was from Laura.</p>

  <p>He opened it with pleasure.</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Alan</span> (said Laura)</p>

  <p class="letter">Nothing (repeat: nothing) would surprise me about history.
  Scotland has large monuments to two women martyrs drowned for their faith, in
  spite of the fact that they weren't drowned at all and neither was a martyr
  anyway. They were convicted of treason&mdash;fifth column work for the
  projected invasion from Holland, I think. Anyhow on a purely civil charge.
  They were reprieved <i>on their own petition</i> by the Privy Council, and
  the reprieve is in the Privy Council Register to this day.</p>

  <p class="letter">This, of course, hasn't daunted the Scottish collectors of
  martyrs, and the tale of their sad end, complete with heart-rending dialogue,
  is to be found in every Scottish bookcase. Entirely different dialogue in
  each collection. And the gravestone of one of the women, in Wigtown
  churchyard, reads:</p>

  <p class="poem">Murdered for owning Christ supreme<br>
  Head of his Church, and no more crime<br>
  But her not owning Prelacy<br>
  And not abjuring Presbytry<br>
  Within the sea tied to a stake<br>
  She suffered for Christ Jesus sake.</p>

  <p class="letter">They are even a subject for fine Presbyterian sermons, I
  understand&mdash;though on that point I speak from hearsay. And tourists come
  and shake their heads over the monuments with their moving inscriptions, and
  a very profitable time is had by all.</p>

  <p class="letter">All this in spite of the fact that the original collector
  of the material, canvassing the Wigtown district only forty years after the
  supposed martyrdom and at the height of the Presbyterian triumph, complains
  that 'many deny that this happened'; and couldn't find any eyewitnesses at
  all.</p>

  <p class="letter">It is very good news that you are convalescent, and a great
  relief to us all. If you manage it well your sick leave can coincide with the
  spring run. The water is very low at the moment, but by the time you are
  better it should be deep enough to please both the fish and you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Love from us all,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Laura</span>.</p>&gt;

  <p class="letter">P.S. It's an odd thing but when you tell someone the true
  facts of a mythical tale they are indignant not with the teller but with you.
  They don't <i>want</i> to have their ideas upset. It rouses some vague
  uneasiness in them, I think, and they resent it. So they reject it and refuse
  to think about it. If they were merely indifferent it would be natural and
  understandable. But it is much stronger than that, much more positive. They
  are annoyed.</p>

  <p class="letter">Very odd, isn't it.</p><br>

  <p><i>More</i> Tonypandy, he thought.</p>

  <p>He began to wonder just how much of the schoolbook which up to now had
  represented British history for him was Tonypandy.</p>

  <p>He went back, now that he knew a few facts, to read the sainted More
  again. To see how the relevant passages sounded now.</p>

  <p>If, when he had read them merely by the light of his own critical mind,
  they had seemed to him curiously tattling, and in places absurd, they now
  read plain abominable. He was what Laura's small Pat was in the habit of
  calling 'scunnered'. And he was also puzzled.</p>

  <p>This was Morton's account. Morton the eyewitness, the participant. Morton
  must have known with minute accuracy what took place between the beginning
  and end of June that year. And yet there was no mention of Lady Eleanor
  Butler; no mention of Titulus Regius. According to Morton, Richard's case had
  been that Edward was previously married to his mistress Elizabeth Lucy. But
  Elizabeth Lucy, Morton pointed out, had denied that she was ever married to
  the King.</p>

  <p>Why did Morton set up a ninepin just to knock it down again?</p>

  <p>Why the substitution of Elizabeth Lucy for Eleanor Butler?</p>

  <p>Because he could deny with truth that Lucy was ever married to the King,
  but could not do the same in the case of Eleanor Butler?</p>

  <p>Surely the presumption was that it was very important to someone or other
  that Richard's claim that the children were illegitimate should be shown to
  be untenable.</p>

  <p>And since Morton&mdash;in the handwriting of the sainted More&mdash;was
  writing for Henry VII, then that someone was presumably Henry VII. The Henry
  VII who had destroyed Titulus Regius and forbidden anyone to keep a copy.</p>

  <p>Something Carradine had said came back into Grant's mind.</p>

  <p>Henry had caused the Act to be repealed <i>without being read</i>.</p>

  <p>It was so important to Henry that the contents of the Act should not be
  brought to mind that he had specially provided for its unquoted
  destruction.</p>

  <p>Why should it be of such importance to Henry VII?</p>

  <p>How could it matter to <i>Henry</i> what Richard's rights were? It was not
  as if he could say: Richard's claim was a trumped-up one, therefore mine is
  good. Whatever wretched small claim Henry Tudor might have was a Lancastrian
  one, and the heirs of York did not enter into the matter.</p>

  <p>Then why should it have been of such paramount importance to Henry that
  the contents of Titulus Regius should be forgotten?</p>

  <p>Why hide away Eleanor Butler, and bring in in her place a mistress whom no
  one ever suggested was married to the King?</p>

  <p>This problem lasted Grant very happily till just before supper; when the
  porter came in with a note for him. 'The front hall says that young American
  friend of yours left this for you,' the porter said, handing him a folded
  sheet of paper.</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' said Grant. What do you know about Richard the Third?'</p>

  <p>'Is there a prize?'</p>

  <p>'What for?'</p>

  <p>'The quiz.'</p>

  <p>'No, just the satisfaction of intellectual curiosity. What do you know
  about Richard III?'</p>

  <p>'He was the first multiple murderer.'</p>

  <p>'Multiple? I thought it was two nephews?'</p>

  <p>'No, oh, no. I don't know much history but I do know that. Murdered his
  brother, and his cousin, and the poor old King in the Tower, and then
  finished off with his little nephews. A wholesale performer.'</p>

  <p>Grant considered this.</p>

  <p>'If I told you that he never murdered anyone at all, what would you
  say?'</p>

  <p>'I'd say that you're perfectly entitled to your opinion. Some people
  believe the earth is flat. Some people believe the world is going to end in
  A.D. 2000. Some people believe that it began less than five thousand years
  ago. You'll hear far funnier things than that at Marble Arch of a
  Sunday.'</p>

  <p>'So you wouldn't even entertain the idea for a monument?'</p>

  <p>'I find it entertaining all right, but not what you might call very
  plausible, shall we say. But don't let me stand in your way. Try it out on a
  better bombing range. You take it to Marble Arch one Sunday, and I'll bet
  you'll find followers aplenty. Maybe start a movement.'</p>

  <p>He made a gay sketchy half-salute with his hand and went away humming to
  himself; secure and impervious.</p>

  <p>So help me, Grant thought, I'm not far off it. If I get any deeper into
  this thing I <i>will</i> be standing on a soapbox at Marble Arch.</p>

  <p>He unfolded the message from Carradine, and read: 'You said that you
  wanted to know whether the other heirs to the throne survived Richard. As
  well as the boys, I mean. I forgot to say: would you make out a list of them
  for me, so that I can look them up. I think it's going to be important.'</p>

  <p>Well, if the world in general went on its humming way, brisk and uncaring,
  at least he had young America on his side.</p>

  <p>He put aside the sainted More, with its Sunday-paper accounts of
  hysterical scenes and wild accusations, and reached for the sober student's
  account of history so that he might catalogue the possible rivals to Richard
  III in the English succession.</p>

  <p>And as he put down More-Morton, he was reminded of something.</p>

  <p>That hysterical scene during the Council in the Tower which was reported
  by More, that frantic outburst on Richard's part against the sorcery that had
  withered his arm, had been against Jane Shore.</p>

  <p>The contrast between the reported scene, pointless and repellent even to a
  disinterested reader, and the kind, tolerant, almost casual air of the letter
  that Richard had actually written about her, was staggering.</p>

  <p>So help me, he thought again, if I had to choose between the man who wrote
  that account and the man who wrote that letter I'd take the man who wrote the
  letter, whatever either of them had done besides.</p>

  <p>The thought of Morton made him postpone his listing of the York heirs
  until he had found out what eventually became of John Morton. It seemed that,
  having used his leisure as Buckingham's guest to organise a joint
  Woodville-Lancastrian effort (in which Henry Tudor would bring ships and
  troops from France and Dorset and the rest of the Woodville tribe would meet
  him with what English malcontents they could induce to follow them) he
  escaped to his old hunting ground in the Ely district, and from there to the
  continent. And did not come back until he came in the wake of a Henry who had
  won both Bosworth and a crown; being himself on the way to Canterbury and a
  cardinal's hat and immortality as Morton of 'Morton's Fork'. Almost the only
  thing that any schoolboy remembered about his master Henry VII.</p>

  <p>For the rest of the evening Grant pottered happily through the history
  books, collecting heirs.</p>

  <p>There was no lack of them. Edward's five, George's boy and girl. And if
  these were discounted, the first through illegitimacy and the second through
  attainder, there was another possible: his elder sister Elizabeth's boy.
  Elizabeth was Duchess of Suffolk, and her son was John de la Pole, Earl of
  Lincoln.</p>

  <p>There was, too, in the family, a boy whose existence Grant had not
  suspected. It appeared that the delicate child at Middleham was not Richard's
  only son. He had a love-child; a boy called John. John of Gloucester. A boy
  of no importance in rank, but acknowledged and living in the household. It
  was an age when a bend sinister was accepted without grief. Indeed the
  Conqueror had made it fashionable. And conquerors from then on had advertised
  its lack of disadvantage. By way of compensation, perhaps.</p>

  <p>Grant made himself a little aide mémoire.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">EDWARD<br>
  Edward, Prince of Wales Richard, Duke of York Elizabeth<br>
  Cicely<br>
  Anne<br>
  Katherine<br>
  Bridget</p>

  <p class="letter">ELIZABETH<br>
  John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln</p>

  <p class="letter">GEORGE<br>
  Edward, Earl of Warwick<br>
  Margaret, Countess of Salisbury</p>

  <p class="letter">RICHARD<br>
  John of Gloucester</p><br>

  <p>He copied it out again for young Carradine's use, wondering how it could
  ever have occurred to anyone, Richard most of all, that the elimination of
  Edward's two boys would have kept him safe from rebellion. The place was what
  young Carradine would call just lousy with heirs. Swarming with focuses (or
  was it foci?) for disaffection.</p>

  <p>It was brought home to him for the first time not only what a useless
  thing the murder of the boys would have been, but what a <i>silly</i>
  thing.</p>

  <p>And if there was anything that Richard of Gloucester was not, beyond a
  shadow of a doubt, it was silly.</p>

  <p>He looked up Oliphant to see what Oliphant had to say on this obvious
  crack in the story.</p>

  <p>'It is strange,' said Oliphant, 'that Richard does not seem to have
  published any version of their deaths.'</p>

  <p>It was more than strange: it was incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>If Richard had wanted to murder his brother's sons then he most certainly
  would have done it expertly. They would have died of a fever, and their
  bodies would have been exposed to the public gaze as royal bodies habitually
  were, so that all men would know that they were in fact departed from this
  life.</p>

  <p>No one can say that a man is incapable of murder&mdash;after long years on
  the Embankment Grant knew that only too well&mdash;but one can be sure to
  within one degree of the absolute when a man is incapable of silliness.</p>

  <p>Oliphant had no doubts about the murder, nevertheless. Richard according
  to Oliphant was Richard the Monster. Perhaps when an historian was covering a
  field as large as the Middle Ages and the Renaissance he had no time to stop
  and analyse detail. Oliphant accepted the sainted More, even while he paused
  in flight to wonder at an oddity here and there. Not seeing that the oddities
  ate away at the very foundations of his theory.</p>

  <p>Having Oliphant in his hand, he went on with Oliphant. On through the
  triumphal progress through England after the coronation. Oxford, Gloucester,
  Worcester, Warwick. No dissentient voice was recorded on that tour. Only a
  chorus of blessing and thanksgiving. A rejoicing that good government was to
  be the order of the day for a lifetime to come. That after all, Edward's
  sudden death had not condemned them to years of faction and a new civil
  struggle over the person of his son.</p>

  <p>And yet it was during this triumph, this unanimous acclamation, this
  universal hosanna, that (according to Oliphant, riding in the pocket of the
  sainted More) Richard sent Tyrrel back to London to make away with the boys
  who were doing lessons in the Tower. Between July 7th and 15th. At Warwick.
  In the very summer of his safety, in the heart of the York country on the
  borders of Wales, he planned the destruction of two discredited children.</p>

  <p>It was a highly unlikely story.</p>

  <p>He began to wonder whether historians were possessed of minds any more
  commonsensical than those Great Minds he had encountered, who had been so
  credulous.</p>

  <p>He must find out without delay why, if Tyrrel did that job in July 1485,
  he wasn't brought to book until twenty years afterwards. Where had he been in
  the meantime?</p>

  <p>But Richard's summer was like an April day. Full of a promise that came to
  nothing. In the autumn he had to face that Woodville-Lancastrian invasion
  which Morton had cooked up before leaving these shores himself. The
  Lancastrian part of the affair did Morton proud: they came with a fleet of
  French ships and a French army. But the Woodville side could provide nothing
  better than sporadic little gatherings in widely separated centres:
  Guildford, Salisbury, Maidstone, Newbury, Exeter, and Brecon. The English
  wanted no part of Henry Tudor, whom they did not know, nor any part of the
  Woodvilles, whom they knew only too well. Even the English weather would have
  none of them. And Dorset's hopes of seeing his half-sister Elizabeth queen of
  England as Henry Tudor's wife were washed away in Severn floods. Henry tried
  to land in the West, but found Devon and Cornwall up in indignant arms at the
  idea. He therefore sailed away to France again, to wait for a luckier day.
  And Dorset went to join the growing crowd of Woodville exiles hanging round
  the French court.</p>

  <p>So Morton's plan was washed away in autumn rain and English indifference,
  and Richard could be at peace for a little; but with the spring came a grief
  that nothing could wash away. The death of his son.</p>

  <p>'The King is said to have shown signs of desperate grief; he was not such
  an unnatural monster as to be destitute of the feelings of a father,' said
  the historian.</p>

  <p>Nor of a husband, it seemed. The same marks of suffering were reported of
  him less than a year later, when Anne died.</p>

  <p>And after that there was nothing but the waiting for the renewal of the
  invasion that had failed; the keeping of England in a state of defence, and
  the anxiety that that drain on the Exchequer brought him.</p>

  <p>He had done what good he could. He had given his name to a model
  Parliament. He had made peace at last with Scotland and arranged a marriage
  between his niece and James III's son. He had tried very hard for a peace
  with France, but had failed. At the French court was Henry Tudor, and Henry
  Tudor was France's white-headed boy. It would be only a matter of time before
  Henry landed in England, this time with better backing.</p>

  <p>Grant suddenly remembered Lady Stanley, that ardent Lancastrian mother of
  Henry. What part had Lady Stanley had in that autumn invasion that had put
  paid to Richard's summer?</p>

  <p>He hunted through the solid print until he found it.</p>

  <p>Lady Stanley had been found guilty of treasonable correspondence with her
  son.</p>

  <p>But again Richard had proved too lenient for his own good, it seemed. Her
  estates were forfeit, but they were handed over to her husband. And so was
  Lady Stanley. For safe keeping. The bitter joke being that Stanley had almost
  certainly been as knowledgeable about the invasion as his wife.</p>

  <p>Truly, the monster was not running according to form.</p>

  <p>As Grant was falling asleep a voice said in his mind: 'If the boys were
  murdered in July, and the Woodville-Lancastrian invasion took place in
  October, why didn't they use the murder of the children as a rallying
  call?'</p>

  <p>The invasion had, of course, been planned before there was any question of
  murder; it was a full-dress affair of fifteen ships and five thousand
  mercenaries and must have taken a long time to prepare. But by the time of
  the rising the rumours of Richard's infamy must have been widespread if there
  were any rumours at all. Why had they not gone shouting his crime through
  England, so that the horror of it brought men flocking to their cause?</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">'COOL off, cool off,' he said to himself when he woke next
  morning, 'you're beginning to be partisan. That's no way to conduct an
  investigation.'</p>

  <p>So, by way of moral discipline, he became prosecutor.</p>

  <p>Supposing that the Butler story was a frame-up. A story concocted with
  Stillington's help. Supposing that both Lords and Commons were willing to be
  hoodwinked in the hope of stable Government to come.</p>

  <p>Did that bring one any nearer the murder of the two boys?</p>

  <p>It didn't, did it?</p>

  <p>If the story was false, the person to be got rid of was Stillington. Lady
  Eleanor had died in her convent long ago, so was not there to blow Titulus
  Regius to pieces any time she had a mind. But Stillington could. And
  Stillington evidently showed no difficulty in going on living. He survived
  the man he had put on the throne.</p>

  <p>The sudden jar in the proceedings, the abrupt break in the pattern of the
  coronation preparation, was either wonderful stage-managing or just what one
  would expect if the thunderclap of Stillington's confession descended on
  prepared ears. Richard was&mdash;what? Eleven? Twelve?&mdash;when the Butler
  contract was signed and witnessed; it was unlikely that he knew anything of
  it.</p>

  <p>If the Butler story was an invention to oblige Richard, then Richard must
  have rewarded Stillington. But there was no sign of Stillington's being
  obliged with a cardinal's hat, or preferment, or office.</p>

  <p>But the surest evidence that the Butler story was true lay in Henry VII's
  urgent need to destroy it. If it were false, then all he had to do to
  discredit Richard was to bring it into the open and make Stillington eat his
  words. Instead he hushed it up.</p>

  <p>At this point Grant realised with disgust that he was back on the Defence
  side again. He decided to give it up. He would take to Lavinia Fitch, or
  Rupert Rouge, or some other of the fashionable authors lying in such
  expensive neglect on his table, and forget Richard Plantagenet until such
  time as young Carradine appeared to renew the inquisition.</p>

  <p>He put the family-tree sketch of Cicely Nevill's grandchildren into an
  envelope and addressed it to Carradine, and gave it to The Midget to post.
  Then he turned-down the portrait that was leaning against the books, so that
  he should not be seduced by that face which Sergeant Williams had placed,
  without hesitation, on the bench, and reached for Silas Weekley's <i>The
  Sweat and the Furrow</i>. Thereafter he went from Silas's seamy wrestlings to
  Lavinia's tea-cups, and from Lavinia's tea-cups to Rupert's cavortings in the
  <i>coulisses</i>, with a growing dissatisfaction, until Brent Carradine once
  more turned up in his life.</p>

  <p>Carradine regarded him anxiously and said: 'You don't look so bright as
  last time I saw you, Mr Grant. You not doing so well?'</p>

  <p>'Not where Richard is concerned, I'm not,' Grant said. 'But I've got a new
  piece of Tonypandy for you.'</p>

  <p>And he handed him Laura's letter about the drowned women who were never
  drowned.</p>

  <p>Carradine read it with a delight that grew on him like slow sunlight
  coming out, until eventually he glowed.</p>

  <p>'My, but that's wonderful. That's very superior, first growth,
  dyed-in-the-wool Tonypandy, isn't it. Lovely, lovely. You didn't know about
  this before? And you a Scotsman?'</p>

  <p>'I'm only a Scot once removed,' Grant pointed out. 'No; I knew that none
  of these Covenanters died "for their Faith", of course; but I didn't know
  that one of them&mdash;or rather, two of them&mdash;hadn't died at all.'</p>

  <p>'They didn't die for their Faith?' Carradine repeated, bewildered. 'D'you
  mean that the <i>whole thing's</i> Tonypandy?'</p>

  <p>Grant laughed. 'I suppose it is,' he said, surprised. 'I never thought
  about it before. I've known so long that the "martyrs" were no more martyrs
  than that thug who is going to his death for killing that old shop-keeper in
  Essex, that I've ceased to think about it. No one in Scotland went to his
  death for anything but civil crime.'</p>

  <p>'But I thought they were very holy people&mdash;the Covenanters, I
  mean.'</p>

  <p>'You've been looking at nineteenth-century pictures of coventicles. The
  reverent little gathering in the heather listening to the preacher; young
  rapt faces, and white hair blowing in the winds of God. The Covenanters were
  the exact equivalent of the I.R.A. in Ireland. A small irreconcilable
  minority, and as bloodthirsty a crowd as ever disgraced a Christian nation.
  If you went to church on Sunday instead of to a conventicle, you were liable
  to wake on Monday and find your barn burned or your horses hamstrung. If you
  were more open in your disapproval you were shot. The men who shot Archbishop
  Sharp in his daughter's presence, in broad daylight on a road in Fife, were
  the heroes of the movement. "Men of courage and zeal for the cause of God",
  according to their admiring followers. They lived safe and swaggering among
  their Covenanting fans in the West for years. It was a "preacher of the
  gospel" who shot Bishop Honeyman in an Edinburgh street. And they shot the
  old parish priest of Carsphairn on his own doorstep.'</p>

  <p>'It does sound like Ireland, doesn't it,' Carradine said.</p>

  <p>'They were actually worse than the I.R.A. because there was a fifth column
  element in it. They were financed from Holland, and their arms came from
  Holland. There was nothing forlorn about their movement, you know. They
  expected to take over the Government any day, and rule Scotland. All their
  preaching was pure sedition. The most violent incitement to crime you could
  imagine. No modern Government could afford to be so patient with such a
  menace as the Government of the time were. The Covenanters were continually
  being offered amnesties.'</p>

  <p>'Well, well. And I thought they were fighting for freedom to worship God
  their own way.'</p>

  <p>'No one ever stopped them from worshipping God any way they pleased. What
  they were out to do was to impose their method of church government not only
  on Scotland but on England, believe it or not. You should read the Covenant
  some day. Freedom of worship was not to be allowed to anyone according to the
  Covenanting creed&mdash;except the Covenanters, of course.'</p>

  <p>'And all those gravestones and monuments that tourists go to
  see&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'All Tonypandy. If you ever read on a gravestone that John Whosit
  "suffered death for his adherence to the Word of God and Scotland's
  Covenanted work of Reformation", with a touching little verse underneath
  about "dust sacrificed to tyranny", you can be sure that the said John Whosit
  was found guilty before a properly constituted court, of a civil crime
  punishable by death and that his death had nothing whatever to do with the
  Word of God.' He laughed a little under his breath. 'It's the final irony,
  you know, that a group whose name was anathema to the rest of Scotland in
  their own time should have been elevated into the position of saints and
  martyrs.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't wonder if it wasn't onomatopoeic,' Carradine said
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Like the Cat and the Rat, you know.'</p>

  <p>'What are you talking about?'</p>

  <p>''Member you said, about that Cat and Rat lampoon, that rhyme, that the
  sound of it made it an offence?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; made it venomous.'</p>

  <p>'Well, the word dragoon does the same thing. I take it that the dragoons
  were just the policemen of the time.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Mounted infantry.'</p>

  <p>'Well, to me&mdash;and I suspect to every other person reading about
  it&mdash;dragoons sound dreadful. They've come to mean something that they
  never were.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I see. Force majeure in being. Actually the Government had only a
  tiny handful of men to police an enormous area, so the odds were all on the
  Covenanters' side. In more ways than one. A dragoon (read policeman) couldn't
  arrest anyone without a warrant (he couldn't stable his horse without the
  owner's permission, if it comes to that), but there was nothing to hinder a
  Covenanter lying snug in the heather and picking off dragoons at his leisure.
  Which they did, of course. And now there's a whole literature about the poor
  ill-used saint in the heather with his pistol; and the dragoon who died in
  the course of his duty is a Monster.'</p>

  <p>'Like Richard.'</p>

  <p>'Like Richard. How have you been getting on with our own particular
  Tonypandy?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I still haven't managed to find out why Henry was so anxious to
  hush up that Act as well as repeal it. The thing was hushed-up and for years
  it was forgotten, until the original draft turned up, just by chance, in the
  Tower records. It was printed in 1611. Speed printed the full text of it in
  his <i>History of Great Britain</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. So there's no question at all about Titulus Regius. Richard succeeded
  as the Act says, and the sainted More's account is nonsense. There never was
  an Elizabeth Lucy in the matter.'</p>

  <p>'Lucy? Who's Elizabeth Lucy?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I forgot. You weren't on in that act. According to the sainted More,
  Richard claimed that Edward was married to one of his mistresses, one
  Elizabeth Lucy.'</p>

  <p>The disgusted look that the mention of the sainted More always caused on
  young Carradine's mild face made him look almost nauseated.</p>

  <p>'That's nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'So the sainted More smugly pointed out.'</p>

  <p>'Why did they want to hide Eleanor Butler?' Carradine said, seeing the
  point.</p>

  <p>'Because she really had married Edward, and the children really were
  illegitimate. And if the children really were illegitimate, by the way, then
  no one would rise in their favour and they were no danger to Richard. Have
  you noticed that the Woodville-Lancastrian invasion was in Henry's favour,
  and not in the boys'&mdash;although Dorset was their half-brother? And that
  was before any rumours of their non-existence could have reached him. As far
  as the leaders of the Dorset-Morton rebellion were concerned the boys were of
  no account. They were backing Henry. That way, Dorset would have a
  brother-in-law on the throne of England, and the Queen would be his
  half-sister. Which would be a nice reversal of form for a penniless
  fugitive.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes, that's a point, all right; that about Dorset not fighting to
  restore his half-brother. If there had been a chance at all that England
  would have accepted the boy, he surely would have backed the boy. I'll tell
  you another interesting thing I found. The Queen and her daughters came out
  of sanctuary quite soon. It's your talking about her son Dorset that reminded
  me. She not only came out of sanctuary but settled down as if nothing had
  happened. Her daughters went to festivities at the Palace. And do you know
  what the pay-off is?'</p>

  <p>'No?'</p>

  <p>'That was <i>after the Princes had been "murdered"</i>. Yes, and I'll tell
  you something else. With her two boys done to death by their wicked uncle,
  she writes to her other son, in France&mdash;Dorset&mdash;and asks him to
  come home and make his peace with Richard, who will treat him well.'</p>

  <p>There was silence.</p>

  <p>There were no sparrows to talk today. Only the soft sound of the rain
  against the window.</p>

  <p>'No comment?' Carradine said at last.</p>

  <p>'You know,' Grant said, 'from the police point of view there is no case
  against Richard at all. And I mean that literally. It isn't that the case
  isn't good enough. Good enough to bring into court, I mean. There, quite
  literally, isn't any case against him at all.'</p>

  <p>'I'll say there isn't. Especially when I tell you that every single one of
  those people whose names you sent me were alive and prosperous, and free,
  when Richard was killed at Bosworth. They were not only free, they were very
  well cared for. Edward's children not only danced at the Palace, they had
  pensions. He appointed one of the crowd his heir when his own boy died.'</p>

  <p>'Which one?'</p>

  <p>'George's boy.'</p>

  <p>'So he meant to reverse the attainder on his brother's children.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He had protested about his being condemned, if you remember.'</p>

  <p>'According to even the sainted More, he did. So all the heirs to the
  throne of England were going about their business, free and unfettered,
  during the reign of Richard III, the Monster.'</p>

  <p>'They were more. They were part of the general scheme of things. I mean,
  part of the family and the general economy of the realm. I've been reading a
  collection of York records by a man Davies. Records of the town of York, I
  mean; not the family. Both young Warwick&mdash;George's son&mdash;and his
  cousin, young Lincoln, were members of the Council. The town addressed a
  letter to them. In 1485, that was. What's more, Richard knighted young
  Warwick at the same time as he knighted his own son, at a splendid "do" at
  York.' He paused a long moment, and then blurted out: 'Mr Grant, do you want
  to write a book about this?'</p>

  <p>'A book!' Grant said, astonished. 'God forbid. Why?'</p>

  <p>'Because I should like to write one. It would make a much better book than
  the Peasants.'</p>

  <p>'Write away.'</p>

  <p>'You see, I'd like to have something to show my father. Pop thinks I'm no
  good because I can't take an interest in furniture, and marketing, and graphs
  of sales. If he could actually handle a book that I had written he might
  believe that I wasn't so hopeless a bet after all. In fact, I wouldn't put it
  past him to begin to boast about me for a change.'</p>

  <p>Grant looked at him with benevolence.</p>

  <p>'I forgot to ask you what you thought of Crosby Place,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Oh, fine, fine. If Carradine the Third ever sees it he'll want to take it
  back with him and rebuild it in the Adirondacks somewhere.'</p>

  <p>'If you write that book about Richard, he most certainly will. He'll feel
  like a part-owner. What are you going to call it?'</p>

  <p>'The book?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'I'm going to borrow a phrase from Henry Ford, and call it <i>History is
  the Bunk</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Excellent.'</p>

  <p>'However, I'll have a lot more reading to do and a lot more research,
  before I can start writing.'</p>

  <p>'Most assuredly you have. You haven't arrived yet at the real
  question.'</p>

  <p>'What is that?'</p>

  <p>'Who <i>did</i> murder the boys.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'If the boys were alive when Henry took over the Tower what happened to
  them?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I'll get on to that. I still want to know why it was so important to
  Henry to hush up the contents of Titulus Regius.'</p>

  <p>He got up to go, and then noticed the portrait that was lying on its face
  on the table. He reached over and restored the photograph to its original
  place, propping it with a concerned care against the pile of books.</p>

  <p>'You stay there,' he said to the painted Richard. 'I'm going to put you
  back where you belong.'</p>

  <p>As he went out of the door, Grant said:</p>

  <p>'I've just thought of a piece of history which is <i>not</i>
  Tonypandy.'</p>

  <p>'Yes?' said Carradine, lingering.</p>

  <p>'The massacre of Glencoe.'</p>

  <p>'That really did happen?'</p>

  <p>'That really did happen. And&mdash;Brent!' Brent put his head back inside
  the door. 'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'The man who gave the order for it was an ardent Covenanter.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">CARRADINE had not been gone more than twenty minutes when
  Marta appeared, laden with flowers, books, candy, and goodwill. She found
  Grant deep in the fifteenth century as reported by Sir Cuthbert Oliphant. He
  greeted her with an absentmindedness to which she was not accustomed.</p>

  <p>'If your two sons had been murdered by your brother-in-law, would you take
  a handsome pension from him?'</p>

  <p>'I take it that the question is rhetorical,' Marta said, putting down her
  sheaf of flowers and looking round to see which of the already occupied vases
  would best suit their type.</p>

  <p>'Honestly, I think historians are all mad. Listen to this:</p>

  <p>"The conduct of the Queen-Dowager is hard to explain; whether she feared
  to be taken from sanctuary by force, or whether she was merely tired of her
  forlorn existence at Westminster, and had resolved to be reconciled to the
  murderer of her sons out of mere callous apathy, seems uncertain."</p>

  <p>'Merciful Heaven!' said Marta, pausing with a delft jar in one hand and a
  glass cylinder in the other, and looking at him in wild surmise.</p>

  <p>'Do you think historians really listen to what they are saying?'</p>

  <p>'Who was the said Queen-Dowager?'</p>

  <p>'Elizabeth Woodville. Edward IV's wife.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. I played her once. It was a "bit". In a play about Warwick the
  Kingmaker.'</p>

  <p>'Of course I'm only a policeman,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I never moved in the right circles. It may be that I've met only
  nice people. Where would one have to go to meet a woman who became matey with
  the murderer of her two boys?'</p>

  <p>'Greece, I should think,' Marta said. 'Ancient Greece.'</p>

  <p>'I can't remember a sample even there.'</p>

  <p>'Or a lunatic asylum, perhaps. Was there any sign of idiocy about
  Elizabeth Woodville?'</p>

  <p>'Not that anyone ever noticed. And she was Queen for twenty years or
  so.'</p>

  <p>'Of course the thing is farce, I hope you see,' Marta said, going on with
  her flower arranging. 'Not a tragedy at all. "Yes, I know he did kill Edward
  and little Richard, but he really is a rather charming creature and it is so
  bad for my rheumatism living in rooms with a north light".'</p>

  <p>Grant laughed, and his good temper came back.</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course. It's the height of absurdity. It belongs to Ruthless
  Rhymes, not to sober history. That is why historians surprise me. They seem
  to have no talent for the likeliness of any situation. They see history like
  a peepshow; with two-dimensional figures against a distant background.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps when you are grubbing about with tattered records you haven't
  time to learn about people. I don't mean about the people in the records, but
  just about People. Flesh and blood. And how they react to circumstances.'</p>

  <p>'How would you play her?' Grant asked, remembering that the understanding
  of motive was Marta's trade.</p>

  <p>'Play who?'</p>

  <p>'The woman who came out of sanctuary and made friends with her children's
  murderer for seven hundred merks per annum and the right to go to parties at
  the Palace.'</p>

  <p>'I couldn't. There is no such woman outside Euripides or a delinquent's
  home. One could only play her as a rag. She'd make a very good burlesque, now
  I think of it. A take-off of poetic tragedy. The blank verse kind. I must try
  it sometime. For a charity matinée, or something. I hope you don't hate
  mimosa. It's odd, considering how long I've known you, how little I know of
  your likes and dislikes. Who invented the woman who became buddies with her
  sons' murderer?'</p>

  <p>'No one invented her. Elizabeth Woodville did come out of sanctuary, and
  did accept a pension from Richard. The pension was not only granted, it was
  paid. Her daughters went to parties at the Palace and she wrote to her other
  son&mdash;her first-marriage son&mdash;to come home from France and make his
  peace with Richard. Oliphant's only suggestion as to the reason for this is
  that she was either frightened of being dragged out of sanctuary (did you
  ever know of anyone who was dragged out of sanctuary? The man who did that
  would be excommunicated&mdash;and Richard was a very good son of Holy Church)
  or that she was bored with sanctuary life.'</p>

  <p>'And what is your theory about so odd a proceeding?'</p>

  <p>'The obvious explanation is that the boys were alive and well. No one at
  that time ever suggested otherwise.'</p>

  <p>Marta considered the sprays of mimosa. 'Yes, of course. You said that
  there was no accusation in that Bill of Attainder. After Richard's death, I
  mean.' Her eyes went from the mimosa to the portrait on the table and then to
  Grant. 'You think, then, you really soberly think, as a policeman, that
  Richard didn't have anything to do with the boys' deaths.'</p>

  <p>'I'm quite sure that they were alive and well when Henry took over the
  Tower on his arrival in London. There is <i>nothing</i> that would explain
  his omission to make a scandal of it if the boys were missing. Can you think
  of anything?'</p>

  <p>'No. No, of course not. It is quite inexplicable. I have always taken it
  for granted that there was a terrific scandal about it. That it would be one
  of the main accusations against Richard. You and my woolly lamb seem to be
  having a lovely time with history. When I suggested a little investigation to
  pass the time and stop the prickles I had no idea that I was contributing to
  the rewriting of history. Which reminds me, Atlanta Shergold is gunning for
  you.'</p>

  <p>'For me? I've never even met her.'</p>

  <p>'Nevertheless she is looking for you with a gun. She says that Brent's
  attitude to the B.M. has become the attitude of an addict to his drug. She
  can't drag him away from it. If she takes him away from it physically, he
  spends the time harking back to it in his mind; so that she mightn't exist as
  far as he is concerned. He has even stopped sitting through <i>To Sea in a
  Bowl</i>. Do you see much of him?'</p>

  <p>'He was here a few minutes before you came. But I don't expect to hear
  from him again for some days to come.'</p>

  <p>But in that he was wrong.</p>

  <p>Just before supper-time the porter appeared with a telegram.</p>

  <p>Grant put his thumb under the dainty Post Office lick on the flap and
  extracted two sheets of telegram. The telegram was from Brent.</p>

  <p>Hell and damnation an awful thing has happened (stop) you know that
  chronicle in Latin I talked about (stop) the chronicle written by the monk at
  Croyland Abbey (stop) well I've just seen it and the rumour is there the
  rumour about the boys being dead (stop) the thing is written before Richard's
  death so we are sunk aren't we and I specially am sunk and that fine book of
  mine will never be written (stop) is anyone allowed to commit suicide in your
  river or is it reserved for the British.</p>

  <p>Brent.</p>

  <p>Into the silence the voice of the porter said: 'It's reply-paid, sir. Do
  you want to send an answer?'</p>

  <p>'What? Oh. No. Not right away. I'll send it down presently.'</p>

  <p>'Very good, sir,' said the porter looking respectfully at the two sheets
  of telegram&mdash;in the porter's family a telegram was confined to one sheet
  only&mdash;and went away, not humming this time.</p>

  <p>Grant considered the news conveyed with such transatlantic extravagance in
  the matter of telegraphic communication. He read the thing again.</p>

  <p>'Croyland,' he said, considering. Why did that ring a bell? No one had
  mentioned Croyland so far in this case. Carradine had talked merely of a
  monkish chronicle somewhere.</p>

  <p>He had been too often, in his professional life, faced with a fact that
  apparently destroyed his whole case to be dismayed now. He reacted as he
  would have reacted in a professional investigation. He took out the upsetting
  small fact and looked at it. Calmly. Dispassionately. With none of poor
  Carradine's wild dismay.</p>

  <p>'Croyland,' he said again. Croyland was somewhere in Cambridgeshire. Or
  was it Norfolk? Somewhere on the borders there, in the flat country.</p>

  <p>The Midget came in with his supper, and propped the flat bowl-like plate
  where he could eat from it with a modicum of comfort, but he was not aware of
  her.</p>

  <p>'Can you reach your pudding easily from there?' she asked. And as he did
  not answer: 'Mr Grant, can you reach your pudding if I leave it on the edge
  there?'</p>

  <p>'<i>Ely!</i>' he shouted at her.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Ely,' he said; softly, to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>'Mr Grant, aren't you feeling well?'</p>

  <p>He became conscious of The Midget's well-powdered and concerned little
  face as it intruded between him and the familiar cracks.</p>

  <p>'I'm fine, fine. Better than I've ever been in my life. Wait just a
  moment, there's a good girl, and send a telegram down for me. Give me my
  writing-pad. I can't reach it with that mess of rice pudding in the way.'</p>

  <p>She gave him the pad and pencil, and on the reply-paid form he wrote:</p>

  <p>Can you find me a similar rumour in France at about the same date?</p>

  <p>Grant</p>

  <p>After that he ate his supper with a good appetite, and settled down to a
  good night's sleep. He was floating in that delicious half-way stage on the
  way to unconsciousness when he became aware that someone was leaning over to
  inspect him. He opened his eyes to see who it might be, and looked straight
  into the anxious yearning brown irises of The Amazon, looking larger and more
  cowlike than ever in the soft lamplight. She was holding in her hand a yellow
  envelope.</p>

  <p>'I didn't quite know what to do,' she said. 'I didn't want to disturb you
  and yet I didn't know whether it mightn't be important. A telegram, you know.
  You never can tell. And if you didn't have it tonight it would mean a whole
  twelve hours' delay. Nurse Ingham has gone off duty, so there was no one to
  ask till Nurse Briggs comes on at ten. I hope I haven't wakened you up. But
  you weren't asleep, were you?'</p>

  <p>Grant assured her that she had done the right thing and she let out a sigh
  that nearly blew the portrait of Richard over. She stood by while he read the
  telegram, with an air of being ready to support him in any evil news that it
  might contain. To The Amazon all telegrams conveyed evil tidings.</p>

  <p>The telegram was from Carradine.</p>

  <p>It said: 'You mean you want repeat want that there should be another
  repeat another accusation question mark&mdash;Brent.'</p>

  <p>Grant took the reply-paid form and wrote: 'Yes. Preferably in France.'</p>

  <p>Then he said to The Amazon: 'You can turn out the light, I think. I'm
  going to sleep until seven tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>He fell asleep wondering how long it would be before he saw Carradine
  again, and what the odds were against that much desired instance of a second
  rumour.</p>

  <p>But it was not so long after all until Carradine turned up again, and he
  turned up looking anything but suicidal. Indeed he seemed in some queer way
  to have broadened out. His coat seemed less of an appendage and more of a
  garment. He beamed at Grant.</p>

  <p>'Mr Grant, you're a wonder. Do they have more like you at Scotland Yard?
  Or do you rate special?'</p>

  <p>Grant looked at him almost unbelieving. 'Don't tell me you've turned up a
  French instance!'</p>

  <p>'Didn't you want me to?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But I hardly dared hope for it. The odds against seemed tremendous.
  What form did the rumour take in France? A chronicle? A letter?'</p>

  <p>'No. Something much more surprising. Something much more dismaying,
  actually. It seems that the Chancellor of France, in a speech to the
  States-General at Tours, spoke of the rumour. Indeed he was quite eloquent
  about it. In a way, his eloquence was the one scrap of comfort I could find
  in the situation.'</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'Well, it sounded more to my mind like a Senator being hasty about someone
  who had brought in a measure his own people back home wouldn't like. More
  like politics than State, if you know what I mean.'</p>

  <p>'You should be at the Yard, Brent. What did the Chancellor say?'</p>

  <p>'Well, it's in French and my French isn't very good so perhaps you'd
  better read it for yourself.'</p>

  <p>He handed over a sheet of his childish writing and Grant read:</p>

  <p>Regardez, je vous prie, les événements qui après la mort du roi Edouard
  sont arrivés dans ce pays. Contemplez ses enfants, déjà grands et braves,
  massacrés impunément, et la couronne transportée a l'assassin par la faveur
  des peuples.</p>

  <p>"Ce pays",' said Grant. 'Then he was in full flood against England. He
  even suggests that it was with the will of the English people that the boys
  were "massacred". We are being held up as a barbarous race.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That's what I meant. It's a Congressman scoring a point. Actually,
  the French Regency sent an embassy to Richard that same year&mdash;about six
  months later&mdash;so they had probably found that the rumour wasn't true.
  Richard signed a safe-conduct for their visit. He wouldn't have done that if
  they had been still slanging him as a murdering untouchable.'</p>

  <p>'No. Can You give me the dates of the two libels?'</p>

  <p>'Sure. I have them here. The monk at Croyland wrote about events in the
  late summer of 1483. He says that there was a rumour that the boys had been
  put to death but no one knew how. The nasty slap in the meeting of the
  States-General was in January 1484.'</p>

  <p>'Perfect,' said Grant.</p>

  <p>'<i>Why</i> did you want there to have been another instance of
  rumour?'</p>

  <p>'As a cross-check. Do you know where Croyland is?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. In the Fen country.'</p>

  <p>'In the Fen country. Near Ely. And it was in the Fen country that Morton
  was hiding out after his escape from Buckingham's charge.'</p>

  <p>'Morton! Yes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'If Morton was the carrier, then there had to be another outbreak on the
  Continent, when he moved on there. Morton escaped from England in the autumn
  of 1483, and the rumour appears promptly in January 1484. Croyland is a very
  isolated place, incidentally, it would be an ideal place for a fugitive
  bishop to hide-out till he could arrange transport abroad.'</p>

  <p>'Morton!' said Carradine again, rolling the name over on his tongue.
  'Wherever there's hanky-panky in this business you stub your toe against
  Morton.'</p>

  <p>'So you've noticed that too.'</p>

  <p>'He was the heart of that conspiracy to murder Richard before he could be
  crowned, he was in back of the rebellion against Richard once he <i>was</i>
  crowned, and his trail to the Continent is sticky as a snail's
  with&mdash;with subversion.'</p>

  <p>'Well, the snail part is mere deduction. It wouldn't stand up in court.
  But there's no peradventure about his activities once he was across the
  channel. He settled down to a whole-time job of subversion. He and a buddy of
  his called Christopher Urswick worked like beavers in Henry's interest;
  "sending preuie letters and cloked messengers" to England to stir up
  hostility to Richard.'</p>

  <p>'Yes? I don't know as much as you about what stands up in court and what
  won't, but it seems to me that that snail's trail is a very allowable
  deduction&mdash;if you'll allow me. I don't suppose Morton waited till he was
  overseas before beginning his undermining.'</p>

  <p>'No. No, of course he didn't. It was life and death to Morton that Richard
  should go. Unless Richard went, John Morton's career was over. He was
  finished. It wasn't even that there would be no preferment for him now. There
  would be nothing. He would be stripped of his numerous livings and be reduced
  to his plain priest's frock. He, John Morton. Who had been within touching
  distance of an archbishopric. But if he could help Henry Tudor to a throne
  then he might still become not only Archbishop of Canterbury but a Cardinal
  besides. Oh, yes; it was desperately, overwhelmingly important to Morton that
  Richard should not have the governing of England.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Brent, 'he was the right man for a job of subversion. I don't
  suppose he knew what a scruple was. A little rumour like infanticide must
  have been child's play to him.'</p>

  <p>'There's always the odd chance that he believed it, of course,' Grant
  said, his habit of weighing evidence overcoming even his dislike of
  Morton.</p>

  <p>'Believed that the boys were murdered?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It may have been someone else's invention. After all, the country
  must have been swarming with Lancastrian tales, part mere ill-will, part
  propaganda. He may have been merely passing on the latest sample.'</p>

  <p>'Huh! I wouldn't put it past him to be paving the way for their future
  murder,' Brent said tartly.</p>

  <p>Grant laughed. 'I wouldn't, at that,' he said. 'What else did you get from
  your monk at Croyland?'</p>

  <p>'A little comfort, too. I found after I had written that panic wire to you
  that he wasn't at all to be taken as gospel. He just put down what gossip
  came his way from the outer world. He says, for instance, that Richard had a
  second coronation, at York; and that of course just isn't true. If he can be
  wrong about a big, known, fact like a coronation, then he's not to be trusted
  as a reporter. But he did know about Titulus Regius, by the way. He recorded
  the whole tenor of it, including Lady Eleanor.'</p>

  <p>'That's interesting. Even a monk at Croyland had heard who Edward was
  supposed to have been married to.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The sainted More must have dreamed up Elizabeth Lucy a good deal
  later.'</p>

  <p>'To say nothing of the unspeakable story that Richard based his claim on
  his mother's shame.'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'He says that Richard caused a sermon to be preached claiming that Edward
  and George were his mother's sons by some other father, and that he, Richard,
  was the only legitimate son and therefore the only true heir.'</p>

  <p>'The sainted More might have thought up a more convincing one,' young
  Carradine said dryly.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Especially when Richard was living in his mother's house at the time
  of the libel!'</p>

  <p>'So he was. I'd forgotten that. I don't have a proper police brain. That's
  very neat, what you say about Morton being the carrier of the rumour. But
  suppose the rumour turns up somewhere else, even yet.'</p>

  <p>'It's possible, of course. But I'm willing to lay you fifties to any
  amount that it won't. I don't for one moment believe that there was any
  general rumour that the boys were missing.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'For a reason that I hold to be unanswerable. If there had been any
  general uneasiness, any obviously subversive rumours or action, Richard would
  have taken immediate steps to checkmate them. When the rumours went round,
  later, that he was proposing to marry his niece Elizabeth&mdash;the boys'
  eldest sister&mdash;he was on to it like a hawk. He not only sent letters to
  the various towns denying the rumour in no uncertain terms, he was so furious
  (and evidently thought of it such importance that he should not be traduced)
  that he summoned the "heid yins" of London to the biggest hall he could find
  (so that he could get them all in at one time) and told them face to face
  what he thought about the affair.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Of course you're right. Richard would have made a public denial of
  the rumour if the rumour was general. After all, it was a much more
  horrifying one than the one that he was going to marry his niece.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; actually you could get a dispensation to marry your niece in those
  days. Perhaps you still can, for all I know. That's not my department at the
  Yard. What is certain is that if Richard went to such lengths to contradict
  the marriage rumour then he most certainly would have gone to much greater
  lengths to put a stop to the murder one, if it had existed. The conclusion is
  inevitable: there was no general rumour of disappearance or foul play where
  the boys were concerned.'</p>

  <p>'Just a thin little trickle between the Fens and France.'</p>

  <p>'Just a thin little trickle between the Fens and France. Nothing in the
  picture suggests any worry about the boys. I mean: in a police investigation
  you look for any abnormalities in behaviour among the suspects in a crime.
  Why did X, who always goes to the movies on a Thursday night, decide on that
  night of all nights not to go? Why did Y take a return half as usual and very
  unusually not use it? That sort of thing. But in the short time between
  Richard's succession and his death everyone behaves quite normally. The boys'
  mother comes out of sanctuary and makes her peace with Richard. The girls
  resume their court life. The boys are presumably still doing the lessons that
  their father's death had interrupted. Their young cousins have a place on the
  Council and are of sufficient importance for the town of York to be
  addressing letters to them. It's all quite a normal, peaceful scene, with
  everyone going about their ordinary business, and no suggestion anywhere that
  a spectacular and unnecessary murder has just taken place in the family.'</p>

  <p>'It looks as if I might write that book after all, Mr Grant.'</p>

  <p>'Most certainly you will write it. You have not only Richard to rescue
  from calumny; you have to clear Elizabeth Woodville of the imputation of
  condoning her sons' murder for seven hundred merks a year and perks.'</p>

  <p>'I can't write the book and leave it in the air like that, of course. I'll
  <i>have</i> to have at least a theory as to what became of the boys.'</p>

  <p>'You will.'</p>

  <p>Carradine's mild gaze came away from the small woolly clouds over the
  Thames and considered Grant with a question in it.</p>

  <p>'Why that tone?' he asked. 'Why are you looking like a cat with
  cream?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've been proceeding along police lines. During those empty days
  while I was waiting for you to turn up again.'</p>

  <p>'Police lines?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Who benefits, and all that. We've discovered that it wouldn't be a
  pin's-worth of advantage to Richard that the boys should die. So we go on
  looking round to see who, in that case, it <i>would</i> benefit. And this is
  where Titulus Regius comes in.'</p>

  <p>'What has Titulus Regius got to do with the murder?'</p>

  <p>'Henry VII married the boys' eldest sister. Elizabeth.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'By way of reconciling the Yorkists to his occupation of the throne.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'By repealing Titulus Regius, he made her legitimate.'</p>

  <p>'Sure.'</p>

  <p>'But by making the children legitimate he automatically made the two boys
  heir to the throne before her. In fact, by repealing Titulus Regius he made
  the elder of the two King of England.'</p>

  <p>Carradine made a little clicking sound with his tongue. His eyes behind
  their horn-rims were glowing with pleasure.</p>

  <p>'So,' said Grant, 'I propose that we proceed with investigation along
  those lines.'</p>

  <p>'Sure. What do you want?'</p>

  <p>'I want to know a lot more about that confession of Tyrrel's. But first,
  and most of all, I'd like to know how the people concerned acted. What
  happened to them; not what anyone reported of anyone. Just as we did in the
  case of Richard's succession after Edward's unexpected death.'</p>

  <p>'Fine. What do you want to know?'</p>

  <p>'I want to know what became of all the York heirs that Richard left so
  alive and well and prosperous. Every single one of them. Can you do that for
  me?'</p>

  <p>'Sure. That's elementary.'</p>

  <p>'And I could bear to know more about Tyrrel. About the man himself, I
  mean. Who he was, and what he had done.'</p>

  <p>'I'll do that.' Carradine got up with such an on-with-the-charge air that
  for one moment Grant thought that he was actually going to button his coat.
  'Mr Grant, I'm so grateful to you for all this&mdash;this&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'This fun and games?'</p>

  <p>'When you're on your feet again, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I'll take you round
  the Tower of London.'</p>

  <p>'Make it Greenwich-and-back by boat. Our island Race have a passion for
  the nautical.'</p>

  <p>'How long do they reckon it will be before you're out of bed, do you
  know?'</p>

  <p>'I'll probably be up before you come back with the news about the heirs
  and Tyrrel.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">GRANT was not, as it happened, out of bed when Carradine
  came again, but he was sitting up.</p>

  <p>'You can't imagine,' he said to Brent, 'how fascinating the opposite wall
  looks, after the ceiling. And how small and queer the world looks right way
  up.'</p>

  <p>He was touched by Carradine's obvious pleasure in this progress and it was
  some time before they got down to business. It was Grant who had to say:
  'Well, how did the York heirs make out under Henry VII?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes,' said the boy, pulling out his usual wad of notes and drawing up
  a chair by hooking his right toe in the crossbar. He sat down on the chair.
  'Where shall I begin?'</p>

  <p>'Well, about Elizabeth we know. He married her, and she was Queen of
  England until she died and he made a bid for the mad Juana of Spain.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. She was married to Henry in the spring of 1486&mdash;in January,
  rather; five months after Bosworth&mdash;and she died in the spring of
  1503.'</p>

  <p>'Seventeen years. Poor Elizabeth. With Henry it must have seemed like
  seventy. He was what is euphemistically referred to as "unuxorious". Let us
  go on down the family. Edward's children, I mean. Fate of the two boys
  unknown. What happened to Cecily?'</p>

  <p>'She was married to his old uncle Lord Welles, and sent away to live in
  Lincolnshire. Anne and Katherine, who were children, were marked when they
  were old enough to good Lancastrians. Bridget, the youngest, became a nun at
  Dartford.'</p>

  <p>'Orthodox enough, so far. Who comes next? George's boy.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Young Warwick. Shut up for life in the Tower, and executed for
  allegedly planning to escape.'</p>

  <p>'So. And George's daughter? Margaret.'</p>

  <p>'She became the Countess of Salisbury. Her execution by Henry VIII on a
  trumped-up charge is apparently the classic sample of judicial murder.'</p>

  <p>'Elizabeth's son? The alternative heir?'</p>

  <p>'John de la Pole. He went to live with his aunt in Burgundy
  until&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'To live with Margaret, Richard's sister.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He died in the Simnel rising. But he had a younger brother that you
  didn't put in that list. He was executed by Henry VIII. He had surrendered to
  Henry VII under a safe-conduct, so Henry, I suppose, thought that it might
  break his luck to ignore that. In any case he had about used up his quota.
  Henry VIII took no chances. He didn't stop at de la Pole. There were four
  more that you missed out of that list. Exeter, Surrey, Buckingham, and
  Montague. He got rid of the lot.'</p>

  <p>'And Richard's son? John? The bastard one.'</p>

  <p>'Henry VII granted him a pension of £20 a year, but he was the first of
  the lot to go.'</p>

  <p>'On what charge?'</p>

  <p>'On having been suspected of receiving an invitation to go to
  Ireland.'</p>

  <p>'You're joking.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not. Ireland was the focus of loyalist rebellion. The York family
  were very popular in Ireland, and to get an invitation from that direction
  was as good as a death warrant in Henry's eyes. Though I can't think why even
  Henry would have bothered about young John. "An active, well-disposed boy",
  he was, by the way, according to the "Foedera".'</p>

  <p>'His claim was better than Henry's.' Grant said, very tart. 'He was the
  illegitimate only son of a King. Henry was the great-grandson of an
  illegitimate son of a younger son of a King.'</p>

  <p>There was silence for some time.</p>

  <p>Then Carradine, out of the silence, said: 'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Yes to what?'</p>

  <p>'To what you are thinking.'</p>

  <p>'It does look like it, doesn't it. They're the only two who are missing
  from the list.'</p>

  <p>There was another silence.</p>

  <p>'They were all judicial murders,' Grant said presently. 'Murders under the
  form of law. But you can't bring a capital charge against a pair of
  children.'</p>

  <p>'No,' agreed Carradine, and went on watching the sparrows. 'No, it would
  have to be done some other way. After all, they were the important ones.'</p>

  <p>'The vital ones.'</p>

  <p>'How do we start?'</p>

  <p>'As we did with Richard's succession. Find out where everyone was in the
  first months of Henry's reign and what they were doing. Say the first year of
  his reign. There will be a break in the pattern somewhere, just as there was
  a break in the preparations for the boy's coronation.'</p>

  <p>'Right.'</p>

  <p>Did you find out anything about Tyrrel? Who he was?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He wasn't at all what I had imagined. I'd imagined him as a sort of
  hanger-on; hadn't you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I think I did. Wasn't he?'</p>

  <p>'No. He was a person of importance. He was Sir James Tyrrel of Gipping. He
  had been on various&mdash;committees, I suppose you'd call them, for Edward
  IV. And he was created a Knight Banneret, whatever that is, at the siege of
  Berwick. And he did well for himself under Richard, though I can't find that
  he was at the battle of Bosworth. A lot of people came too late for the
  battle&mdash;did you know?&mdash;so I don't suppose that means anything
  particular. Anyhow, he wasn't that lackey-on-the-make person that I'd always
  pictured.'</p>

  <p>'That's interesting. How did he make out under Henry VII?'</p>

  <p>'Well, that's the really interesting thing. For such a very good and
  successful servant of the York family, he seems to have fairly blossomed
  under Henry. Henry appointed him Constable of Guisnes. Then he was sent as
  ambassador to Rome. He was one of the Commissioners for negotiating the
  Treaty of Etaples. And Henry gave him a grant for life of the revenues of
  some lands in Wales, but made him exchange them for revenues of the county of
  Guisnes of equal value&mdash;I can't think why.'</p>

  <p>'I can,' said Grant.</p>

  <p>'You can?'</p>

  <p>'Has it struck you that all his honours and his commissions are outside
  England? Even the reward of land revenues.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, so they are. What does that convey to you?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing at the moment. Perhaps he just found Guisnes better for his
  bronchial catarrh. It is possible to read too much into historical
  transactions. Like Shakespeare's plays, they are capable of almost endless
  interpretations. How long did this honeymoon with Henry VII last?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, quite a long time. Everything was just grand until 1502.'</p>

  <p>'What happened in 1502?'</p>

  <p>'Henry heard that he had been ready to help one of the York crowd in the
  Tower to escape to Germany. He sent the whole garrison of Calais to besiege
  the castle at Guisnes. That wasn't quick enough for him, so he sent his Lord
  Privy Seal&mdash;know what that is?'</p>

  <p>Grant nodded.</p>

  <p>'Sent his Lord Privy Seal&mdash;what names you English have dreamed up for
  your Elks officials&mdash;to offer him safe conduct if he would come aboard a
  ship at Calais and confer with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.'</p>

  <p>'Don't tell me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't need to, do I? He finished up in a dungeon in the Tower. And was
  beheaded "in great haste and without trial" on May 6th 1503.'</p>

  <p>'And what about his confession?'</p>

  <p>'There wasn't one.'</p>

  <p>'What!'</p>

  <p>'Don't look at me like that. I'm not responsible.'</p>

  <p>'But I thought he confessed to the murder of the boys.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, according to various accounts. But they are accounts of a
  confession, not&mdash;not a transcript, if you see what I mean.'</p>

  <p>'You mean, Henry didn't publish a confession?'</p>

  <p>'No. His paid historian, Polydore Virgil, gave an account of how the
  murder was done. After Tyrrel was dead.'</p>

  <p>'But if Tyrrel confessed that he murdered the boys at Richard's
  instigation, why wasn't he charged with the crime and publicly tried for
  it?'</p>

  <p>'I can't imagine.'</p>

  <p>'Let me get this straight. Nothing was heard of Tyrrel's confession until
  Tyrrel was dead.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Tyrrel confesses that, way back in 1483, nearly twenty years ago, he
  pelted up to London from Warwick, got the keys of the Tower from the
  Constable&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Brackenbury. Sir Robert Brackenbury.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Got the keys of the Tower from Sir Robert Brackenbury for one night,
  murdered the boys, handed back the keys, and reported back to Richard. He
  confesses this, and so puts an end to what must have been a much canvassed
  mystery, and yet nothing public is done with him.'</p>

  <p>'Not a thing.'</p>

  <p>'I'd hate to go into court with a story like that.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't even consider it, myself. It's as phoney a tale as ever I
  heard.'</p>

  <p>'Didn't they even bring Brackenbury in to affirm or deny the story of the
  keys being handed over?'</p>

  <p>'Brackenbury was killed at Bosworth.'</p>

  <p>'So he was conveniently dead too, was he.' He lay and thought about it.
  'You know, if Brackenbury died at Bosworth, then we have one more small piece
  of evidence on our side.'</p>

  <p>'How? What?'</p>

  <p>'If that had really happened; I mean: if the keys were handed over for a
  night on Richard's order, then a lot of junior officials at the Tower must
  have been aware of it. It is quite inconceivable that one or other of them
  wouldn't be ready to tell the tale to Henry when he took over the Tower.
  Especially if the boys were missing. Brackenbury was dead. Richard was dead.
  The next in command at the Tower would be expected to produce the boys. When
  they weren't producible, he must have said: "The Constable handed over the
  keys, one night, and since then the boys have not been seen." There would
  have been the most ruthless hue and cry after the man who had been given the
  keys. He would have been Exhibit A in the case against Richard, and to
  produce him would have been a feather in Henry's cap.'</p>

  <p>'Not only that, but Tyrrel was too well known to the people at the Tower
  to have passed unrecognised. In the small London of that day he must have
  been quite a well-known figure.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. If that story were true Tyrrel would have been tried and executed
  for the boys' murder, openly, in 1485. He had no one to protect him.' He
  reached for his cigarettes. 'So what we're left with is that Henry executed
  Tyrrel in 1502, and then announced by way of his tame historians that Tyrrel
  had confessed that twenty years before he had murdered the Princes.</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'And he didn't offer, anywhere, at any time, any reason for not trying
  Tyrrel for this atrocious thing he had confessed.'</p>

  <p>'No. Not as far as I can make out. He was sideways as a crab, you know. He
  never went straight at anything, even murder. It had to be covered up to look
  like something else. He waited years to find some sort of legal excuse that
  would camouflage a murder. He had a mind like a corkscrew. Do you know what
  his first official action as Henry VII was?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'To execute some of the men fighting for Richard at Bosworth on a charge
  of treason. And do you know how he managed to make it legally treason? By
  dating his reign from the day before Bosworth. A mind that was capable of a
  piece of sharp practice of that calibre was capable of anything.' He took the
  cigarette that Grant was offering him. 'But he didn't get away with it,' he
  added, with sober joy. 'Oh, no, he didn't get away with it. The English,
  bless them, drew the line at that. They told him where he got off.'</p>

  <p>'How?'</p>

  <p>'They presented him, in that nice polite English way, with an Act of
  Parliament that said that no one serving the Sovereign Lord of the land for
  the time being should be convicted of treason or suffer either forfeiture or
  imprisonment, and they made him consent to it. That's terribly English, that
  ruthless politeness. No yelling in the street or throwing stones because they
  didn't like his little bit of cheating. Just a nice polite reasonable Act for
  him to swallow and like it. I bet he did a slow burn about that one. Well, I
  must be on my way. It's sure nice to see you sitting up and taking notice.
  We'll be having that trip to Greenwich in no time at all, I see. What's at
  Greenwich?'</p>

  <p>'Some very fine architecture and a fine stretch of muddy river.'</p>

  <p>'That's all?'</p>

  <p>'And some good pubs.'</p>

  <p>'We're going to Greenwich.'</p>

  <p>When he had gone Grant slid down in bed and smoked one cigarette after
  another while he considered the tale of those heirs of York who had prospered
  under Richard III, and gone to their graves under Henry VII.</p>

  <p>Some of them may have 'asked for it'. Carradine's report had, after all,
  been a précis; innocent of qualification, insusceptible to half-tones. But it
  was surely a thundering great coincidence that all the lives who stood
  between the Tudors and the throne had been cut short so conveniently.</p>

  <p>He looked, with no great enthusiasm, at the book that young Carradine had
  brought him. It was called <i>The Life and Reign of Richard III</i>; by
  someone James Gairdner. Carradine had assured him that he would find Dr
  Gairdner well worth his while. Dr Gairdner was, according to Brent, 'a
  yell'.</p>

  <p>The book did not appear to Grant to be markedly hilarious, but anything
  about Richard was better than something about anyone else, so he began to
  glance through it, and presently he became aware just what Brent had meant by
  saying that the good doctor was a 'yell'. Dr Gairdner obstinately believed
  Richard to be a murderer, but since he was a writer honest, learned, and
  according to his lights impartial, it was not in him to suppress facts. The
  spectacle of Dr Gairdner trying to make his facts fit his theory was the most
  entertaining thing in gymnastics that Grant had witnessed for some time.</p>

  <p>Dr Gairdner acknowledged with no apparent sense of incongruity Richard's
  great wisdom, his generosity, his courage, his ability, his charm, his
  popularity, and the trust that he inspired even in his beaten enemies; and in
  the same breath reported his vile slander of his mother and his slaughter of
  two helpless children. Tradition says, said the worthy Doctor; and solemnly
  reported the horrible tradition and subscribed to it. There was nothing mean
  or paltry in his character, according to the Doctor&mdash;but he was a
  murderer of innocent children. Even his enemies had confidence in his
  justice&mdash;but he murdered his own nephews. His integrity was
  remarkable&mdash;but he killed for gain.</p>

  <p>As a contortionist Dr Gairdner was the original boneless wonder. More than
  ever Grant wondered with what part of their brains historians reasoned. It
  was certainly by no process of reasoning known to ordinary mortals that they
  arrived at their conclusions. Nowhere in the pages of fiction or fact, and
  certainly nowhere in life, had he met any human being remotely resembling
  either Dr Gairdner's Richard or Oliphant's Elizabeth Woodville.</p>

  <p>Perhaps there was something in Laura's theory that human nature found it
  difficult to give up preconceived beliefs. That there was some vague inward
  opposition to, and resentment of, a reversal of accepted fact. Certainly Dr
  Gairdner dragged like a frightened child on the hand that was pulling him
  towards the inevitable.</p>

  <p>That charming men of great integrity had committed murder in their day
  Grant knew only too well. But not that kind of murder and not for that kind
  of reason. The kind of man whom Dr Gairdner had drawn in his <i>Life and
  History of Richard III</i> would commit murder only when his own personal
  life had been bouleversé by some earthquake. He would murder his wife for
  unfaithfulness suddenly discovered, perhaps. Or kill the partner whose secret
  speculation had ruined their firm and the future of his children. Whatever
  murder he committed would be the result of acute emotion, it would never be
  planned: and it would never be a base murder.</p>

  <p>One could not say: Because Richard possessed this quality and that,
  therefore he was incapable of murder. But one could say: Because Richard
  possessed these qualities, therefore he is incapable of this murder.</p>

  <p>It would have been a silly murder, that murder of the boy Princes; and
  Richard was a remarkably able man. It was base beyond description; and he was
  a man of great integrity. It was callous; and he was noted for his
  warm-heartedness.</p>

  <p>One could go through the catalogue of his acknowledged virtues, and find
  that each of them, individually, made his part in the murder unlikely in the
  extreme. Taken together they amounted to a wall of impossibility that towered
  into fantasy.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">'THERE was one person you forgot to ask for,' Carradine
  said, breezing in, very gay, some days later, 'in your list of kind
  inquiries.'</p>

  <p>'Hullo. Who was that?'</p>

  <p>'Stillington.'</p>

  <p>'Of course! The worthy Bishop of Bath. If Henry hated Titulus Regius, as a
  witness of Richard's integrity and his own wife's illegitimacy, he must still
  more have disliked the presence of its instigator. What happened to old
  Stillington? Judicial murder?'</p>

  <p>'Apparently the old boy wouldn't play.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't play what?'</p>

  <p>'Henry's pet game. Out goes he. Either he was a wily old bird, or he was
  too innocent to see the snare at all. It's my belief&mdash;if a mere Research
  Worker is entitled to a belief&mdash;that he was so innocent that no agent
  provocateur could provoke him to anything. Not anything that could be made a
  capital charge, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Are you telling me that he defeated Henry?'</p>

  <p>'No. Oh, no. No one ever defeated Henry. Henry put him on a charge and
  conveniently forgot to release him. And never home came he. Who was that?
  Mary on the sands of Dee?'</p>

  <p>'You're very bright this morning, not to say exhilarated.'</p>

  <p>'Don't say it in that suspicious tone. They're not open yet. This
  effervescence that you observe in me is intellectual carbonisation. Spiritual
  rejoicing. An entirely cerebral scintillation.'</p>

  <p>'Well? Sit down and cough up. What is so good? I take it that something
  is?'</p>

  <p>'Good is hardly the proper word. It's beautiful, perfectly-holy
  beautiful.'</p>

  <p>'I think you <i>have</i> been drinking.'</p>

  <p>'I couldn't drink this morning if I tried. I'm bung full, full up to the
  gullet's edge, with satisfaction.'</p>

  <p>'I take it you found that break in the pattern we were looking for.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I found it, but it was later than we had thought. Later in time, I
  mean. Further on. In the first months everyone did what you would expect them
  to do. Henry took over&mdash;not a word about the boys&mdash;and cleaned up,
  got married to the boys' sister. Got his own attainder reversed by a
  Parliament of his own attainted followers&mdash;no mention of the
  boys&mdash;and got an act of attainder through against Richard and his loyal
  subjects whose service was so neatly made treason by that one day's
  ante-dating. That brought a fine heap of forfeited estates into the kitty in
  one go. The Croyland monk was terribly scandalised, by the way, at Henry's
  sharp practice in the matter of treason. "O God," he says, "what security are
  our kings to have henceforth in the day of battle if their loyal followers
  may in defeat be deprived of life, fortune, and inheritance".'</p>

  <p>'He reckoned without his countrymen.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He might have known that the English would get round to that matter
  sooner or later. Perhaps he was an alien. Anyhow, everything went on just as
  you would expect things to go with Henry in charge. He succeeded in August of
  1485, and married Elizabeth the following January. Elizabeth had her first
  child at Winchester, and her mother was there with her and was present at the
  baptism. That was in September 1486. Then she came back to London&mdash;the
  Queen Dowager, I mean&mdash;in the autumn. And in February&mdash;hold on to
  everything&mdash;in February she was shut in a convent for the rest of her
  life.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Elizabeth Woodville</i>?' Grant said, in the greatest astonishment.
  This was the very last thing he had expected.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Elizabeth Woodville. The boys' mother.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know that she didn't go voluntarily?' Grant asked, when he had
  thought of it for a little. 'It was not an uncommon thing for great ladies
  who were tired of court life to retire into an Order. It was not a severe
  existence, you know. Indeed, I have an idea it was fairly comfortable for
  rich women.'</p>

  <p>'Henry stripped her of everything she owned, and ordered her into the
  nunnery at Bermondsey. And that, by the way, <i>did</i> create a sensation.
  There was "much wondering", it appears.'</p>

  <p>'I'm not surprised. What an extraordinary thing. Did he give a
  reason?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'What did he say he was ruining her for?'</p>

  <p>'For being nice to Richard.'</p>

  <p>'Are you serious?'</p>

  <p>'Sure.'</p>

  <p>'Is that the official wording?'</p>

  <p>'No. That's the version of Henry's pet historian.'</p>

  <p>'Virgil?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The actual order of council that shut her up, said it was "for
  various considerations".'</p>

  <p>'Are you quoting?' asked Grant, incredulous.</p>

  <p>'I'm quoting. That's what it said: "For various considerations."'</p>

  <p>After a moment Grant said: 'He had no talent for excuses, had he? In his
  place I would have thought up six better ones.'</p>

  <p>'Either he couldn't be bothered or he thought other people very credulous.
  Mark you, her niceness to Richard didn't worry him until eighteen months
  after he succeeded Richard. Up till then everything had apparently been
  smooth as milk. He had even given her presents, manors and what not, when he
  succeeded Richard.'</p>

  <p>'What was his real reason? Have you any suggestion?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've another little item that may give you ideas. It certainly gave
  me one hell of a big idea.'</p>

  <p>'Go on.'</p>

  <p>'In June of that year&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Which year?'</p>

  <p>'The first year of Elizabeth's marriage. 1486. The year when she was
  married in January and had Prince Arthur at Winchester in September, with her
  mother dancing attendance.'</p>

  <p>'All right. Yes.'</p>

  <p>'In June of that year, Sir James Tyrrel received a general pardon. On the
  16th June.'</p>

  <p>'But that means very little, you know. It was quite a usual thing. At the
  end of a period of service. Or on setting out on a new one. It merely meant
  that you were quit of anything that anyone might think of raking up against
  you afterwards.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I know. I know that. The first pardon isn't the surprising one.'</p>

  <p>'The <i>first</i> pardon? Was there a second one?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That's the pay-off. There was a second general pardon to Sir James
  exactly a month later. To be exact on the 16th July, 1486.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Grant said, thinking it over. 'That really is extraordinary.'</p>

  <p>'It's highly unusual, anyway. I asked an old boy who works next me at the
  B.M.&mdash;he does historical research and he's been a wonderful help to me I
  don't mind telling you&mdash;and he said he had never come across another
  instance. I showed him the two entries&mdash;in the <i>Memorials of Henry
  VII</i>&mdash;and he mooned over them like a lover.'</p>

  <p>Grant said, considering: 'On the 16th June, Tyrrel is given a general
  pardon. On the 16th July he is given a second general pardon. In November or
  thereabouts the boys' mother comes back to town. And in February she is
  immured for life.'</p>

  <p>'Suggestive?'</p>

  <p>'Very.'</p>

  <p>'You think he did it? Tyrrel.'</p>

  <p>'It could be. It's very suggestive, isn't it, that when we find the break
  in the normal pattern that we've been looking for, Tyrrel is there, on the
  spot, with a most unconscionable break in his own pattern. When did the
  rumour that the boys were missing first become general? I mean, something to
  be talked openly about.'</p>

  <p>'Quite early in Henry's reign, it would seem.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; it fits. It would certainly explain the thing that has puzzled us
  from the beginning in this affair.'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'It would explain why there was no fuss when the boys disappeared. It's
  always been a puzzling thing, even to people who thought that Richard did it.
  Indeed, when you come to think of it it would be impossible for Richard to
  get away with it. There was a large, and very active, and very powerful
  opposition party in Richard's day, and he left them all free and scattered up
  and down the country to carry on as they liked. He had all the
  Woodville-Lancaster crowd to deal with if the boys had gone missing. But
  where interference or undue curiosity was concerned Henry was sitting pretty.
  Henry had got his opposition party safely in jail. The only possible danger
  was his mother-in-law, and at the very moment when she becomes capable of
  being a prying nuisance she too is put under hatches and battened down.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Wouldn't you think that there was <i>something</i> she could have
  done? When she found that she was being prevented from getting news of the
  boys.'</p>

  <p>'She may never have known that they were missing. He may just have said:
  "It is my wish that you should not see them. I think you are a bad influence
  on them: you who came out of sanctuary and let your daughters go to that
  man's parties!"'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that's so, of course. He didn't have to wait until she actually
  became suspicious. The whole thing might have been one move. "You're a bad
  woman, and a bad mother; I am sending you into a convent to save your soul
  and your children from the contamination of your presence".'</p>

  <p>'Yes. And where the rest of England were concerned, he was as safe as any
  murderer ever could be. After his happy thought about the "treason"
  accusation, no one was going to stick his neck out by inquiring particularly
  about the boys' health. Everyone must have been walking on eggs as it was. No
  one knowing what Henry might think of next to make into a retrospective
  offence that would send their lives into limbo and their estates into Henry's
  kitty. No, it was no time to be over-curious about anything that didn't
  directly concern oneself. Not that it would be easy, in any case, to satisfy
  one's curiosity.'</p>

  <p>'With the boys living at the Tower, you mean.'</p>

  <p>'With the boys living in a Tower officialled by Henry's men. There was
  none of Richard's get-together live-and-let-live attitude about Henry. No
  York-Lancaster alliance for Henry. The people at the Tower would be Henry's
  men.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Of course they would. Did you know that Henry was the first English
  King to have a bodyguard? I wonder what he told his wife about her
  brothers.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That would be interesting to know. He may even have told her the
  truth.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Henry!</i> Never! It would cost Henry a spiritual struggle, Mr Grant,
  to acknowledge that two and two were four. I tell you, he was a crab; he
  never went straight at anything.'</p>

  <p>'If he were sadist he could tell her with impunity, you know. There was
  practically nothing she could do about it. Even if she wanted to. She
  mightn't have wanted to all that much. She had just produced an heir to the
  throne of England and was getting ready to produce another. She might not
  have the spare interest for a crusade; especially a crusade that would knock
  the ground from under her own feet.'</p>

  <p>'He wasn't a sadist, Henry,' young Carradine said sadly. Sad at having to
  grant Henry even a negative virtue. 'In a way he was just the opposite. He
  didn't enjoy murder at all. He had to pretty it before he could bear the
  thought of it. Dress it up in legal ribbons. If you think that Henry got a
  kick out of boasting to Elizabeth in bed about what he had done with her
  brothers, I think you're wrong.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, probably,' Grant said. And lay thinking about Henry. 'I've just
  thought of the right adjective for Henry,' he said presently. 'Shabby. He was
  a shabby creature.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Even his hair was thin and scanty.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't mean it physically.'</p>

  <p>'I know you didn't.'</p>

  <p>'Everything that he did was shabby. Come to think of it, "Morton's Fork"
  is the shabbiest piece of revenue-raising in history. But it wasn't only his
  greed for money. Everything about him is shabby, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Dr Gairdner wouldn't have any trouble in making his actions fit his
  character. How did you get on with the Doctor?'</p>

  <p>'A fascinating study. But for the grace of God I think the worthy Doctor
  might have made a living as a criminal.'</p>

  <p>'Because he cheated?'</p>

  <p>'Because he didn't cheat. He was as honest as the day. He just couldn't
  reason from B to C.'</p>

  <p>'All right I'll buy.'</p>

  <p>'Everyone can reason from A to B&mdash;even a child. And most adults can
  reason from B to C. But a lot can't. Most criminals can't. You may not
  believe it&mdash;I know it's an awful come-down from the popular conception
  of the criminal as a dashing and cute character&mdash;but the criminal mind
  is an essentially silly one. You can't imagine how silly sometimes. You'd
  have to experience it to believe their lack of reasoning powers. They arrive
  at B, but they're quite incapable of making the jump to C. They'll lay two
  completely incompatible things side by side and contemplate them with the
  most unquestioning content. You can't make them see that they can't have
  both, any more than you can make a man of no taste see that bits of plywood
  nailed on to a gable to simulate Tudor beams are impossible. Have you started
  your own book?'</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;I've made a sort of tentative beginning. I know the way I
  <i>want</i> to write it. I mean the form. I hope you won't mind.'</p>

  <p>'Why should I mind?'</p>

  <p>'I want to write it the way it happened. You know; about my coming to see
  you, and our starting the Richard thing quite casually and not knowing what
  we were getting into, and how we stuck to things that actually happened and
  not what someone reported afterwards about it, and how we looked for the
  break in the normal pattern that would indicate where the mischief was, like
  bubbles coming up from a diver way below, and that sort of thing.'</p>

  <p>'I think it's a grand idea.'</p>

  <p>'You do?'</p>

  <p>'I do indeed.'</p>

  <p>'Well, that's fine, then. I'll get on with it. I'm going to do some
  research on Henry, just as garnish. I'd like to be able to put their actual
  records side by side, you see. So that people can compare them for
  themselves. Did you know that Henry invented the Star Chamber?'</p>

  <p>'Was it Henry? I'd forgotten that. Morton's Fork and the Star Chamber. The
  classic sample of sharp practice, and the classic sample of tyranny. You're
  not going to have any difficulty in differentiating the rival portraits, are
  you! Morton's Fork and the Star Chamber make a nice contrast to the granting
  of the right to bail, and the prevention of the intimidation of juries.'</p>

  <p>'Was that Richard's Parliament? Golly, what a lot of reading I have to do.
  Atlanta's not speaking to me. She hates your marrow. She says I'm about as
  much use to a girl as a last year's <i>Vogue</i>. But honestly, Mr Grant,
  this is the first time in my life that anything exciting has happened to me.
  Important, I mean. Not exciting meaning exciting. Atlanta's exciting. She's
  all the excitement I ever want. But neither of us is important, the way I
  mean important&mdash;if you can understand what I mean.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I understand. You've found something worth doing.'</p>

  <p>'That's it. I've found something worth doing. And it's me that's going to
  do it; that's what's wonderful about it. Me. Mrs Carradine's little boy. I
  come over here with Atlanta, with no idea about anything but using that
  research gag as an alibi. I walk into the B.M. to get me some dope to keep
  Pop quiet, and I walk out with a mission. Doesn't that shake you!' He eyed
  Grant in a considering way. 'You're quite sure, Mr Grant, that you don't want
  to write this book yourself? After all, it's quite a thing to do.'</p>

  <p>'I shall never write a book,' Grant said firmly. 'Not even <i>My Twenty
  Years at the Yard</i>.'</p>

  <p>'What! Not even your autobiography?'</p>

  <p>'Not even my autobiography. It is my considered opinion that far too many
  books are written as it is.'</p>

  <p>'But this is one that must be written,' Carradine said, looking slightly
  hurt.</p>

  <p>'Of course it is. This one must be written. Tell me: there's something I
  forgot to ask you. How soon after that double pardon did Tyrrel get that
  appointment in France? How soon after his supposed service to Henry in July
  1486 did he become Constable of the Castle of Guisnes?'</p>

  <p>Carradine stopped looking hurt and looked as malicious as it was possible
  for his kind woolly-lamb face to look.</p>

  <p>'I was wondering when you were going to ask that,' he said. 'I was going
  to throw it at you on my way out if you forgot to ask. The answer is: almost
  right away.'</p>

  <p>'So. Another appropriate little pebble in the mosaic. I wonder whether the
  constableship just happened to be vacant, or whether it was a French
  appointment because Henry wanted him out of England.'</p>

  <p>'I bet it was the other way about, and it was Tyrrel who wanted to get out
  of England. If I were being ruled by Henry VII, I'd sure prefer to be ruled
  by remote control. Especially if I had done a secret job for Henry that might
  make it convenient for Henry if I didn't live to too venerable an age.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, perhaps you're right. He didn't only go abroad, he stayed
  abroad&mdash;as we have already observed. Interesting.'</p>

  <p>'He wasn't the only one who stayed abroad. John Dighton did too. I
  couldn't find out who all the people who were supposed to be involved in the
  murder actually were. All the Tudor accounts are different, I suppose you
  know. Indeed most of them are so different that they contradict each other
  flat. Henry's pet historian, Polydore Virgil, says the deed was done when
  Richard was at York. According to the sainted More it was during an earlier
  trip altogether, when Richard was at Warwick. And the personnel changes with
  each account. So that it's difficult to sort them out. I don't know who Will
  Slater was&mdash;Black Will to you, and another piece of
  onomatopoeia&mdash;or Miles Forrest. But there was a John Dighton. Grafton
  says he lived for long at Calais "no less disdained than pointed at" and died
  there in great misery. How they relished a good moral, didn't they. The
  Victorians had nothing on them.'</p>

  <p>'If Dighton was destitute it doesn't look as if he had done any job for
  Henry. What was he by trade?'</p>

  <p>'Well, if it's the same John Dighton, he was a priest, and he was anything
  but destitute. He was living very comfortably on the proceeds of a sinecure.
  Henry gave a John Dighton the living of Fulbeck, near Grantham&mdash;that's
  in Lincolnshire&mdash;on the 2nd of May, 1487.'</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' Grant said, drawling. '1487. And he, too, lives abroad and
  in comfort.'</p>

  <p>'Uh-huh. Lovely, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'It's beautiful. And does anyone explain how the much-pointed-at Dighton
  wasn't hauled home by the scruff of his neck to hang for regicide?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. Nothing like that. Tudor historians&mdash;didn't any of them
  think from B to C.?'</p>

  <p>Grant laughed. 'I see you're being educated.'</p>

  <p>'Sure. I'm not only learning history. I'm sitting at the feet of Scotland
  Yard on the subject of the human mind. Well, that will be about all for now.
  If you feel strong enough I'll read you the first two chapters of the book
  next time I come.' He paused and said: 'Would you mind, Mr Grant, if I
  dedicated it to you?'</p>

  <p>'I think you had better dedicate it to Carradine The Third,' Grant said
  lightly.</p>

  <p>But Carradine apparently did not feel it to be a light matter.</p>

  <p>'I don't use soft soap as a dedication,' he said, with a hint of
  stiffness.</p>

  <p>'Oh, not soft soap,' Grant said in haste. 'A matter of policy merely.'</p>

  <p>'I'd never have started on this thing if it hadn't been for you, Mr
  Grant,' Carradine said, standing in the middle of the floor all formal and
  emotional and American and surrounded by the sweeping folds of his topcoat,
  'and I should like to make due acknowledgement of my indebtedness.'</p>

  <p>'I should be delighted, of course,' murmured Grant, and the royal figure
  in the middle of the floor relaxed to boyhood again and the awkward moment
  was over. Carradine went away joyous and light-footed as he had come, looking
  thirty pounds heavier and twelve inches more round the chest than he had done
  three weeks ago.</p>

  <p>And Grant took out the new knowledge that had been given him, and hung it
  on the opposite wall, and stared at it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">SHE had been shut away from the world; that indestructibly
  virtuous beauty with the gilt hair.</p>

  <p>Why gilt, he wondered for the first time. Silver-gilt probably; she had
  been radiantly fair. A pity that the word blonde had degenerated to the point
  where it had almost a secondary meaning.</p>

  <p>She had been walled up to end her days where she could be no trouble to
  anyone. An eddy of trouble had moved with her all through her life. Her
  marriage to Edward had rocked England. She had been the passive means of
  Warwick's ruin. Her kindnesses to her family had built a whole new party in
  England and had prevented Richard's peaceful succession. Bosworth was
  implicit in that scanty little ceremony in the wilds of Northamptonshire when
  she became Edward's wife. But no one seemed to have borne her malice. Even
  the sinned-against Richard had forgiven her her relations' enormities. No
  one&mdash;until Henry came.</p>

  <p>She had disappeared into obscurity. Elizabeth Woodville. The Queen Dowager
  who was mother of the Queen of England. The mother of the Princes in the
  Tower; who had lived free and prosperous under Richard III.</p>

  <p>That was an ugly break in the pattern, wasn't it?</p>

  <p>He took his mind away from personal histories and began to think
  police-fashion. It was time he tidied up his case. Put it shipshape for
  presenting. It would help the boy with his book, and better still it would
  clear his own mind. It would be down in black and white where he could see
  it.</p>

  <p>He reached for his writing-pad and pen, and made a neat entry:</p>

  <p>CASE: Disappearance of two boys (Edward, Prince of Wales; Richard, Duke of
  York) from the Tower of London, 1485 or thereabouts.</p>

  <p>He wondered whether it would be better to do the two suspects in parallel
  columns or successively. Perhaps it was better to finish with Richard first.
  So he made another neat headline; and began on his summing-up:</p>

  <p>RICHARD III</p>

  <p><i>Previous Record:</i></p>

  <p>Good. Has excellent record in public service, and good reputation in
  private life. Salient characteristic as indicated by his actions: good
  sense.</p>

  <p><i>In the matter of the presumed crime:</i></p>

  <p>(a) He did not stand to benefit; there were nine other heirs to the house
  of York, including three males.</p>

  <p>(b) There is no contemporary accusation.</p>

  <p>(c) The boys' mother continued on friendly terms with him until his death,
  and her daughters attended Palace festivities.</p>

  <p>(d) He showed no fear of the other heirs of York, providing generously for
  their upkeep and granting all of them their royal state.</p>

  <p>(e) His own right to the crown was unassailable, approved by Act of
  Parliament and public acclamation; the boys were out of the succession and of
  no danger to him.</p>

  <p>(f) If he had been nervous about disaffection then the person to have got
  rid of was not the two boys, but the person who really was next in succession
  to him: young Warwick. Whom he publicly created his heir when his own son
  died.</p>

  <p>HENRY VII</p>

  <p><i>Previous Record:</i></p>

  <p>An adventurer, living at foreign courts. Son of an ambitious mother.
  Nothing known against his private life. No public office or employment.
  Salient characteristic as indicated by his actions: subtlety.</p>

  <p><i>In the matter of the presumed crime:</i></p>

  <p>(a) It was of great importance to him that the boys should not continue to
  live. By repealing the Act acknowledging the children's illegitimacy, he made
  the elder boy King of England, and the younger boy the next heir.</p>

  <p>(b) In the Act which he brought before Parliament for the attainting of
  Richard he accused Richard of the conventional tyranny and cruelty but made
  no mention of the two young Princes. The conclusion is inevitable that at
  that time the two boys were alive and their whereabouts known.</p>

  <p>(c) The boys' mother was deprived of her living and consigned to a nunnery
  eighteen months after his succession.</p>

  <p>(d) He took immediate steps to secure the persons of all the other heirs
  to the crown, and kept them in close arrest until he could with the minimum
  of scandal get rid of them.</p>

  <p>(e) He had no right whatever to the throne. Since the death of Richard,
  young Warwick was <i>de jure</i> King of England.</p>

  <p>It occurred to Grant for the first time, as he wrote it out, that it had
  been within Richard's power to legitimise his bastard son John, and foist him
  on the nation. There was no lack of precedent for such a course. After all,
  the whole Beaufort clan (including Henry's mother) were the descendants not
  only of an illegitimate union but of a double adultery. There was nothing to
  hinder Richard from legitimising that 'active and well-disposed' boy who
  lived in recognised state in his household. It was surely the measure of
  Richard that no such course had apparently crossed his mind. He had appointed
  as his heir his brother's boy. Even in the destitution of his own grief, good
  sense was his ruling characteristic. Good sense and family feeling. No
  base-born son, however active and well-disposed, was going to sit in the
  Plantagenets' seat while his brother's son was there to occupy it.</p>

  <p>It was remarkable how that atmosphere of family feeling permeated the
  whole story. All the way from Cicely's journeyings about in her husband's
  company, to her son's free acknowledgement of his brother George's boy as his
  heir.</p>

  <p>And it occurred to him too for the first time in full force just how that
  family atmosphere strengthened the case for Richard's innocence. The boys
  whom he was supposed to have put down as he would put down twin foals were
  Edward's sons; children he must have known personally and well. To Henry, on
  the other hand, they were mere symbols. Obstacles on a path. He may never
  even have set eyes on them. All questions of character apart, the choice
  between the two men as suspects might almost be decided on that alone.</p>

  <p>It was wonderfully clearing to the head to see it neat and tidy as (a),
  (b), and (c). He had not noticed before how doubly suspect was Henry's
  behaviour over Titulus Regius. If, as Henry had insisted, Richard's claim was
  absurd, then surely the obvious thing to do was to have the thing re-read in
  public and demonstrate its falsity. But he did no such thing. He went to
  endless pains to obliterate even the memory of it. The conclusion was
  inevitable that Richard's title to the crown as shown in Titulus Regius was
  unassailable.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">ON the afternoon when Carradine reappeared in the room at
  the hospital Grant had walked to the window and back again, and was so
  cock-a-hoop about it that The Midget was moved to remind him that it was a
  thing that a child of eighteen months could do. But nothing could subdue
  Grant today.</p>

  <p>'Thought you'd have me here for months, didn't you,' he crowed.</p>

  <p>'We are very glad to see you better so quickly,' she said primly; and
  added: 'We are, of course, very glad, too, to have your bed.'</p>

  <p>And she clicked away down the corridor, all blonde curls and starch.</p>

  <p>Grant lay on his bed and looked at his little prison room with something
  approaching benevolence. Neither a man who has stood at the Pole nor a man
  who has stood on Everest has anything on a man who has stood at a window
  after weeks of being merely twelve stones of destitution. Or so Grant
  felt.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow he was going home. Going home to be cosseted by Mrs Tinker. He
  would have to spend half of each day in bed and he would be able to walk only
  with the aid of sticks, but he would be his own man again. At the bidding of
  no one. In tutelage to no half-pint piece of efficiency, yearned over by no
  lump of out-sized benevolence.</p>

  <p>It was a glorious prospect.</p>

  <p>He had already unloaded his hallelujahs all over Sergeant Williams, who
  had looked in on the completion of his chore in Essex, and he was now
  yearning for Marta to drop in so that he could peacock in front of her in his
  new-found manhood.</p>

  <p>'How did you get on with the history books?' Williams had asked.</p>

  <p>'Couldn't be better. I've proved them all wrong.'</p>

  <p>Williams had grinned. 'I expect there's a law against that,' he said. 'MI5
  won't like it. Treason or lèse-majesté or something like that it might turn
  out to be. You never know nowadays. I'd be careful if I was you.'</p>

  <p>'I'll never again believe anything I read in a history book, as long as I
  live, so help me.'</p>

  <p>'You'll have to make exceptions,' Williams pointed out with Williams'
  dogged reasonableness. 'Queen Victoria was true, and I suppose Julius Caesar
  did invade Britain. And there's 1066.'</p>

  <p>'I'm beginning to have the gravest doubts about 1066. I see you've tied up
  the Essex job. What is Chummy like?'</p>

  <p>'A thorough little blighter. Been treated soft all his life since he
  started stealing change from his Ma at the age of nine. A good belting at the
  age of twelve might have saved his life. Now he'll hang before the almond
  blossom's out. It's going to be an early spring. I've been working every
  evening in the garden this last few days, now that the days are drawing out.
  You'll be glad to sniff fresh air again.'</p>

  <p>And he had gone away, rosy and sane and balanced, as befitted a man who
  was belted for his good in his youth.</p>

  <p>So Grant was longing for some other visitor from the outside world that he
  was so soon to be a part of again, and he was delighted when the familiar
  tentative tap came on his door.</p>

  <p>'Come in, Brent!' he called, joyfully.</p>

  <p>And Brent came in.</p>

  <p>But it was not the Brent who had last gone out.</p>

  <p>Gone was the jubilation. Gone was his newly acquired breadth.</p>

  <p>He was no longer Carradine the pioneer, the blazer of trails.</p>

  <p>He was just a thin boy in a very long, very large overcoat. He looked
  young, and shocked, and bereaved.</p>

  <p>Grant watched him in dismay as he crossed the room with his listless
  unco-ordinated walk. There was no bundle of paper sticking out of his
  mail-sack of a pocket today.</p>

  <p>Oh, well, thought Grant philosophically; it had been fun while it lasted.
  There was bound to be a snag somewhere. One couldn't do serious research in
  that light-hearted amateur way and hope to prove anything by it. One wouldn't
  expect an amateur to walk into the Yard and solve a case that had defeated
  the pro's; so why should he have thought himself smarter than the historians.
  He had wanted to prove to himself that he was right in his face-reading of
  the portrait; he had wanted to blot out the shame of having put a criminal on
  the bench instead of in the dock. But he would have to accept his mistake,
  and like it. Perhaps he had asked for it. Perhaps, in his heart of hearts, he
  had been growing a little pleased with himself about his eye for faces.</p>

  <p>'Hullo, Mr Grant.'</p>

  <p>'Hullo, Brent.'</p>

  <p>Actually it was worse for the boy. He was at the age when he expected
  miracles to happen. He was still at the age when he was surprised that a
  balloon should burst.</p>

  <p>'You look saddish,' he said cheerfully to the boy. 'Something come
  unstuck.'</p>

  <p>'Everything.'</p>

  <p>Carradine sat down on the chair and stared at the window.</p>

  <p>'Don't these damned sparrows get you down?' he asked, fretfully.</p>

  <p>'What is it? Have you discovered that there was a general rumour about the
  boys before Richard's death, after all?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, much worse than that.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Something in print? A letter?'</p>

  <p>'No, it isn't that sort of thing at all. It's something much worse.
  Something quite&mdash;quite fundamental. I don't know how to tell you.' He
  glowered at the quarrelling sparrows. 'These damned birds. I can never write
  that book now, Mr Grant.'</p>

  <p>'Why not, Brent?'</p>

  <p>'Because it isn't news to anyone. Everyone has known all about those
  things all along.'</p>

  <p>'Known? About what?'</p>

  <p>'About Richard not having killed the boys at all, and all that.'</p>

  <p>'They've <i>known</i>? Since when!'</p>

  <p>'Oh, hundreds and hundreds of years.'</p>

  <p>'Pull yourself together, chum. It's only four hundred years altogether
  since the thing happened.'</p>

  <p>'I know. But it doesn't make any difference. People have known about
  Richard's not doing it for hundreds and hundreds&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Will you stop that keening and talk sense. When did this&mdash;this
  rehabilitation first begin?'</p>

  <p>'Begin? Oh, at the first available moment.'</p>

  <p>'When was that?'</p>

  <p>'As soon as the Tudors were gone and it was safe to talk.'</p>

  <p>'In Stuart times, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I suppose&mdash;yes. A man Buck wrote a vindication in the
  seventeenth century. And Horace Walpole in the eighteenth. And someone called
  Markham in the nineteenth.'</p>

  <p>'And who in the twentieth?'</p>

  <p>'No one that I know of.'</p>

  <p>'Then what's wrong with your doing it?'</p>

  <p>'But it won't be the same, don't you see. It won't be a great discovery!'
  He said it in capitals. A Great Discovery.</p>

  <p>Grant smiled at him. 'Oh, come! You can't expect to pick Great Discoveries
  off bushes. If you can't be a pioneer what's wrong with leading a
  crusade?'</p>

  <p>'A crusade?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly.'</p>

  <p>'Against what?'</p>

  <p>'Tonypandy.'</p>

  <p>The boy's face lost its blankness. It looked suddenly amused, like someone
  who has just seen a joke.</p>

  <p>'It's the damnedest silliest name, isn't it!' he remarked.</p>

  <p>'If people have been pointing out for three hundred and fifty years that
  Richard didn't murder his nephews and a schoolbook can still say, in words of
  one syllable and without qualification, that he did, then it seems to me that
  Tonypandy has a long lead on you. It's time you got busy.'</p>

  <p>'But what can <i>I</i> do when people like Walpole and those have
  failed?'</p>

  <p>'There's that old saying about constant water and its effect on
  stone.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Grant, right now I feel an awfully feeble little trickle.'</p>

  <p>'You look it, I must say. I've never seen such self-pity. That's no mood
  to start bucking the British public in. You'll be giving enough weight away
  as it is.'</p>

  <p>'Because I've not written a book before, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'No, that doesn't matter at all. Most people's first books are their best
  anyway; it's the one they wanted most to write. No, I meant that all the
  people who've never read a history book since they left school will feel
  themselves qualified to pontificate about what you've written. They'll accuse
  you of whitewashing Richard; "whitewashing" has a derogatory sound that
  "rehabilitation" hasn't, so they'll call it whitewashing. A few will look up
  the Britannica, and feel themselves competent to go a little further in the
  matter. These will slay you instead of flaying you. And the serious
  historians won't even bother to notice you.'</p>

  <p>'By God, I'll make them notice me!' Carradine said.</p>

  <p>'Come! That sounds a little more like the spirit that won the Empire.'</p>

  <p>'We haven't got an Empire,' Carradine reminded him.</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, you have,' Grant said equably. 'The only difference between ours
  and yours is that you acquired yours, economically, in the one latitude,
  while we got ours in bits all over the world. Had you written any of the book
  before the awful knowledge of its unoriginality hit you?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'd done two chapters.'</p>

  <p>'What have you done with them? You haven't thrown them away, have
  you?'</p>

  <p>'No. I nearly did. I nearly threw them in the fire.'</p>

  <p>'What stopped you?'</p>

  <p>'It was an electric fire.' Carradine stretched out his long legs in a
  relaxing movement and began to laugh. 'Brother, I feel better already. I
  can't wait to land the British public one in the kisser with a few home
  truths. Carradine the First is just raging in my blood.'</p>

  <p>'A very virulent fever, it sounds.'</p>

  <p>'He was the most ruthless old blaggard that ever felled timber. He started
  as a logger and ended up with a Renaissance castle, two yachts, and a private
  car. Railroad car, you know. It had green silk curtains with bobbles on them
  and inlay woodwork that had to be seen to be believed. It has been popularly
  supposed, not least by Carradine the Third, that the Carradine blood was
  growing thin. But right now I'm all Carradine the First. I know just how the
  old boy felt when he wanted to buy a particular forest and someone said that
  he couldn't have it. Brother, I'm going to town.'</p>

  <p>'That's nice,' Grant said, mildly. 'I was looking forward to that
  dedication.' He took his writing-pad from the table and held it out. 'I've
  been doing a policeman's summing-up. Perhaps it may help you when you come to
  your peroration.'</p>

  <p>Carradine took it and looked at it with respect.</p>

  <p>'Tear it off and take it with you. I've finished with it.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose in a week or two you'll be too busy with real investigations to
  care about a&mdash;an academic one,' Carradine said, a little wistfully.</p>

  <p>'I'll never enjoy one more than I've enjoyed this,' Grant said, with
  truth. He glanced sideways at the portrait which was still propped against
  the books. 'I was more dashed than you would believe when you came in all
  despondent, and I thought it had come to pieces.' He looked back at the
  portrait and said: 'Marta thinks he is a little like Lorenzo the Magnificent.
  Her friend James thinks it is the face of a saint. My surgeon thinks it is
  the face of a cripple. Sergeant Williams thinks he looks like a great judge.
  But I think, perhaps, Matron comes nearest the heart of the matter.'</p>

  <p>'What does she say?'</p>

  <p>'She says it is a face full of the most dreadful suffering.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes, I suppose it is. And would you wonder, after all.'</p>

  <p>'No. No, there was little he was spared. Those last two years of his life
  must have happened with the suddenness and weight of an avalanche. Everything
  had been going along so nicely. England on an even keel at last. The civil
  war fading out of mind, a good firm government to keep things peaceful and a
  good brisk trade to keep things prosperous. It must have seemed a good
  outlook, looking out from Middleham across Wensleydale. And in two short
  years&mdash;his wife, his son, and his peace.'</p>

  <p>'I know one thing he was spared.'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'The knowledge that his name was to be a hissing and a byword down the
  centuries.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That would have been the final heart-break. Do you know what I
  personally find <i>the</i> convincing thing in the case for Richard's
  innocence of any design for usurpation?'</p>

  <p>'No. What?'</p>

  <p>'The fact that he had to send for those troops from the North when
  Stillington broke his news. If he had had any fore-knowledge of what
  Stillington was going to say, or even any plans to concoct a story with
  Stillington's help, he would have brought those troops with him. If not to
  London then to the Home Counties where they would be handy. That he had to
  send urgently first to York and then to his Nevill cousins for men is proof
  that Stillington's confession took him entirely unawares.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He came up with his train of gentlemen, expecting to take over the
  Regency. He met the news of the Woodville trouble when he came to
  Northampton, but that didn't rattle him. He mopped up the Woodville two
  thousand and went on to London as if nothing had happened. There was still
  nothing but an orthodox Coronation in front of him as far as he knew. It
  wasn't until Stillington confessed to the council that he sends for troops of
  his own. And he has to send all the way to the North of England at a critical
  moment. Yes, you're right, of course. He was taken aback.' He propped the leg
  of his spectacles with a forefinger in the old tentative gesture, and
  proffered a companion piece. 'Know what I find the convincing thing in the
  case for Henry's guilt?'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'The mystery.'</p>

  <p>'Mystery?'</p>

  <p>'The mysteriousness. The hush-hush. The hole-and-corner stuff.'</p>

  <p>'Because it is in character, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'No, no; nothing as subtle as that. Don't you see: Richard had no need of
  any mystery; but Henry's whole case depended on the boys' end being
  mysterious. No one has ever been able to think up a reason for such a
  hole-and-corner method as Richard was supposed to have used. It was a quite
  mad way to do it. He couldn't hope to get away with it. Sooner or later he
  was going to have to account for the boys not being there. As far as he knew
  he had a long reign in front of him. No one has ever been able to think why
  he should have chosen so difficult and dangerous a way when he had so many
  simpler methods at hand. He had only to have the boys suffocated, and let
  them lie in state while the whole of London walked by and wept over two young
  things dead before their time of fever. That is the way he <i>would</i> have
  done it, too. Goodness, <i>the whole point</i> of Richard's killing the boys
  was to prevent any rising in their favour, and to get any benefit from the
  murder the fact of their deaths would have to be made public, and as soon as
  possible. It would defeat the whole plan if people didn't <i>know</i> that
  they were dead. But Henry, now. Henry <i>had</i> to find a way to push them
  out of sight. Henry <i>had</i> to be mysterious. Henry <i>had</i> to hide the
  facts of when and how they died. Henry's <i>whole case</i> depended on no
  one's knowing what exactly happened to the boys.'</p>

  <p>'It did indeed, Brent; it did indeed,' Grant said, smiling at counsel's
  eager young face. 'You ought to be at the Yard, Mr Carradine!'</p>

  <p>Brent laughed.</p>

  <p>'I'll stick to Tonypandy,' he said. 'I bet there's a lot more of it that
  we don't know about. I bet history books are just riddled with it.'</p>

  <p>'You'd better take Sir Cuthbert Oliphant with you, by the way.' Grant took
  the fat respectable-looking volume from his locker. 'Historians should be
  compelled to take a course in psychology before they are allowed to
  write.'</p>

  <p>'Huh. That wouldn't do anything for them. A man who is interested in what
  makes people tick doesn't write history. He writes novels, or becomes an
  alienist, or a magistrate&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Or a confidence man.'</p>

  <p>'Or a confidence man. Or a fortune-teller. A man who understands about
  people hasn't any yen to write history. History is toy soldiers.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come. Aren't you being a little severe? It's a very learned and
  erudite&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I didn't mean it that way. I mean: it's moving little figures about
  on a flat surface. It's half-way to mathematics, when you come to think about
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Then if it's mathematics they've no right to drag in backstairs gossip,'
  Grant said, suddenly vicious. The memory of the sainted More continued to
  upset him. He thumbed through the fat respectable Sir Cuthbert in a farewell
  review. As he came to the final pages the progress of the paper from under
  his thumb slackened, and presently stopped.</p>

  <p>'Odd,' he said, 'how willing they are to grant a man the quality of
  courage in battle. They have only tradition to go on, and yet not one of them
  questions it. Not one of them, in fact, fails to stress it.'</p>

  <p>'It was an enemy's tribute,' Carradine reminded him. 'The tradition began
  with a ballad written by the other side.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. By a man of the Stanleys. "Then a knight to King Richard gan say."
  It's here somewhere.' He turned over a leaf or two, until he found what he
  was looking for. 'It was "good Sir William Harrington", it seems. The knight
  in question.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"There may no man their strokes abide, the Stanleys dints
  they be so strong (the treacherous villains!)<br>
  Ye may come back at another tide, methinks ye tarry here too long,<br>
  Your horse at your hand is ready, another day you may worship win<br>
  And come to reign with royalty, and wear your crown and be our king.<br>
  'Nay, give me my battle-axe in my hand, set the crown of England on my head
  so high.<br>
  For by Him that made both sea and land, King of England this day I will
  die.<br>
  One foot I will never flee whilst the breath is my breast within.'<br>
  As he said so did it be&mdash;if he lost his life he died a King."</p><br>

  <p>'"Set the crown of England on my head";' said Carradine, musing. 'That was
  the crown that was found in a hawthorn bush afterwards.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Set aside for plunder probably.'</p>

  <p>'I used to picture it one of those high plush things that King George got
  crowned in, but it seems it was just a gold circlet.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It could be worn outside the battle helmet.'</p>

  <p>'Gosh,' said Carradine with sudden feeling, 'sure would have hated to wear
  that crown if I had been Henry! I sure would have hated it!' He was silent
  for a little, and then he said: 'Do you know what the town of York
  wrote&mdash;wrote in their records, you know&mdash;about the battle of
  Bosworth?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'They wrote: "This day was our good King Richard piteously slain and
  murdered; to the great heaviness of this city."'</p>

  <p>The chatter of the sparrows was loud in the quiet.</p>

  <p>'Hardly the obituary of a hated usurper,' Grant said at last, very
  dry.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Carradine, 'no. "To the great heaviness of this city";' he
  repeated slowly, rolling the phrase over in his mind. 'They cared so much
  about it that even with a new régime in the offing and the future not to be
  guessed at they put down in black and white in the town record their opinion
  that it was murder and their sorrow at it.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps they had just heard about the indignities perpetrated on the
  King's dead body and were feeling a little sick.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes. You don't like to think of a man you've known and admired flung
  stripped and dangling across a pony like a dead animal.'</p>

  <p>'One wouldn't like to think of even an enemy so. But sensibility is not a
  quality that one would look for among the Henry-Morton crowd.'</p>

  <p>'Huh. Morton!' said Brent, spitting out the word as if it were a bad
  taste. 'No one was "heavy" when Morton died, believe me. Know what the
  Chronicler wrote of him? The London one, I mean. He wrote: "In our time was
  no man like to be compared with him in all things; albeit that he lived not
  without the great disdain and hatred of the Commons of this land."'</p>

  <p>Grant turned to look at the portrait which had kept him company through so
  many days and nights.</p>

  <p>'You know,' he said, 'for all his success and his Cardinal's hat I think
  Morton was the loser in that fight with Richard III. In spite of his defeat
  and his long traducing, Richard came off the better of these two. He was
  loved in his day.'</p>

  <p>'That's no bad epitaph,' the boy said soberly.</p>

  <p>'No. Not at all a bad epitaph,' Grant said, shutting Oliphant for the last
  time. 'Not many men would ask for a better.' He handed over the book to its
  owner. 'Few men have earned so much,' he said.</p>

  <p>When Carradine had gone Grant began to sort out the things on his table,
  preparatory to his homegoing on the morrow. The unread fashionable novels
  could go to the hospital library to gladden other hearts than his. But he
  would keep the book with the mountain pictures. And he must remember to give
  The Amazon back her two history books. He looked them out so that he could
  give them to her when she brought in his supper. And he read again, for the
  first time since he began his search for the truth about Richard, the
  schoolbook tale of his villainy. There it was, in unequivocable black and
  white, the infamous story. Without a perhaps or a peradventure. Without a
  qualification or a question.</p>

  <p>As he was about to shut the senior of the two educators his eye fell on
  the beginning of Henry VII's reign, and he read: 'It was the settled and
  considered policy of the Tudors to rid themselves of all rivals to the
  throne, more especially those heirs of York who remained alive on the
  succession of Henry VII. In this they were successful, although it was left
  to Henry VIII to get rid of the last of them.'</p>

  <p>He stared at this bald announcement. This placid acceptance of wholesale
  murder. This simple acknowlegement of a process of family elimination.</p>

  <p>Richard III had been credited with the elimination of two nephews, and his
  name was a synonym for evil. But Henry VII, whose 'settled and considered
  policy' was to eliminate a whole family was regarded as a shrewd and
  far-seeing monarch. Not very lovable perhaps, but constructive and
  painstaking, and very successful withal.</p>

  <p>Grant gave up. History was something that he would never understand.</p>

  <p>The values of historians differed so radically from any values with which
  he was acquainted that he could never hope to meet them on any common ground.
  He would go back to the Yard, where murderers were murderers and what went
  for Cox went equally for Box.</p>

  <p>He put the two books tidily together and when The Amazon came in with his
  mince and stewed prunes he handed them over with a neat little speech of
  gratitude. He really was very grateful to The Amazon. If she had not kept her
  schoolbooks he might never have started on the road that led to his knowledge
  of Richard Plantagenet.</p>

  <p>She looked confused by his kindness, and he wondered if he had been such a
  bear in his illness that she expected nothing but carping from him. It was a
  humiliating thought.</p>

  <p>'We'll miss you, you know,' she said, and her big eyes looked as if they
  might brim with tears. 'We've grown used to having you here. We've even got
  used to <i>that</i>.' And she moved an elbow in the direction of the
  portrait.</p>

  <p>A thought stirred in him.</p>

  <p>'Will you do something for me?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Of course. Anything I can do.'</p>

  <p>'Will you take that photograph to the window and look at it in a good
  light as long as it takes to count a pulse?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course, if you want me to. But why?'</p>

  <p>'Never mind why. You just do it to please me. I'll time you.'</p>

  <p>She took up the portrait and moved into the light of the window.</p>

  <p>He watched the second-hand of his watch.</p>

  <p>He gave her forty-five seconds and then said: 'Well?' And as there was no
  immediate answer he said again: 'Well?'</p>

  <p>'Funny,' she said. 'When you look at it for a little it's really quite a
  nice face, isn't it?'</p>
