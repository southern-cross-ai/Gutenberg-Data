  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;A ROPE OF SNOW</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Brisbane Courier</i>, Australia, 16 Dec 1911</h3><br>

  <p class="first">RAYMOND NODES turned away from the contemplation of the
  snowy landscape, and the 'Telegraph' fluttered from his hand. He did not
  doubt the evidence of his senses; he did not clasp his hand wildly to his
  brow and ask himself if he were the victim of some strange hallucination. He
  was too cold-blooded and unimaginative for that. There must be some practical
  explanation to account for the man sitting opposite to him in the first class
  carriage. He had not materialised a fellow passenger.</p>

  <p>To begin with, though it was Christmas time and the train was consequently
  full, the compartment had been reserved for him. As a man of means and local
  influence, he could command that sort of thing. He was going on to the Gate
  House to dine; he had been detained till the last moment by important
  business, and his idea had been to dress in the train. He had telephoned to
  his man to meet him at Whiteley-road with his kit bag and evening clothes.
  The man was to see that a carriage was attached to the train at
  Whiteley-road, and the Stationmaster had given the desired assurance. They
  usually had a spare coach or two there. It was no trouble, and Nodes had more
  than once done the same thing. He had everything he needed in his bag, even
  to his safety razor, but that would not be needed, as he had shaved closely
  that morning.</p>

  <p>All the same he wanted to be a little particular, especially as he was
  going to meet Mary Glynn at the Gate House. He had never been there
  before&mdash;the invitation had come through Mary Glynn's host, Reginald
  Norfolk. There was no definite engagement between Mary Glynn and Raymond
  Nodes, but her friends expected her to marry him. Most of them thought she
  would be a fool if she didn't.</p>

  <p>Nodes was not hurrying. The train was pretty sure to be late, as the snow
  lay so deep along the line. He had the best part of an hour before him yet,
  and he knew that he should find everything ready, down to the stud in his
  buttonhole. He did not want to lose the freshness of his toilette; he would
  leave it till the last moment. There was a lavatory with hot and cold water
  leading from the carriage. These are the sort of little luxuries that money
  can buy.</p>

  <p>Then Nodes turned to find himself no longer alone. For seated opposite to
  him was a man about his own size and build, grim, determined, and dirty, and
  evidently in considerable trouble. He had a wild and hunted look; he
  suggested many sinister things, accentuated in his case by the queer garments
  that he was wearing. They consisted mainly of a horrible yellow jacket and
  knickerbockers, heavy woollen stockings and clumsy boots. Beyond question,
  the man was an escaped convict.</p>

  <p>Nodes did not need anybody to tell him this. By some means or other an
  escaped convict had found his way into the carriage. The train had been
  stopped by the deep snowdrifts more than once. It was quite the old-fashioned
  Christmas weather. This must be the escaped Bransby convict. No doubt he had
  found his way into the carriage by way of the lavatory during one of the
  stoppages. He was going to ask Nodes to help him. He smiled at the thought.
  There was nothing feeling or sentimental about Nodes. He respected the
  conventions of society too sincerely for that.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you doing here?" he asked. "How did you get here?"</p>

  <p>"We will come to that presently," the convict said. "Is it possible you
  don't recognise me?"</p>

  <p>Nodes shook his head. He was not exactly frightened, but the back of his
  throat was dry. He did not like the grimness of the other's manner. He had
  expected an appeal to his better nature. Apparently, that formed no part of
  the intruder's programme.</p>

  <p>The convict strode across the carriage in the direction of the lavatory.
  He was not away long enough to give Nodes a chance to press the alarm
  bell.</p>

  <p>He came back with a wet towel in his hand. He rubbed it vigorously over
  his face, and turned to Nodes again. A cry came from the latter.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, it's Summers!" he stammered. "Rick Summers! What does this
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"We will come to that presently," the man addressed as Summers said again.
  "Give me a cigarette. I was lucky enough to get both meat and drink today,
  and now I fancy a smoke. A merry Christmas to you, dear sir."</p>

  <p>Nodes passed over his cigarette case with a shaking hand. Of all the men
  on the face of the universe at that moment, Richard Summers was the very last
  he wanted to meet. There were reasons why his heart turned to water; and his
  tongue clave to the roof of his mouth as he looked at the other.</p>

  <p>"I am not here by accident," Summers went on. There was a hard, dry
  grimness in his voice that caused Nodes to wriggle about uneasily on his
  seat. "I came to meet you. I dragged myself hungry and tired across a whole
  county to see you. My intention was to call upon you last night. I was
  actually in the house when Henderson called on business, and you had him in
  the library. I heard your conversation there. I heard your plans for to-day.
  I changed my mind. An excellent idea occurred to me, if I could only put it
  in practice. If possible, I wanted to get on the train with you to-night. As
  I had heard all your plans discussed, the matter was not quite so difficult.
  If I could find my way in safety to Whiteley-road Station the thing might he
  managed. The dark and gloomy time of year was distinctly in my favour. I
  managed to get to the station and hide myself in the goods shed. How I got
  here you can easily guess."</p>

  <p>"What do you expect to gain by this? Sooner or later you will
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later the truth will come out. A man in prison without friends
  or influence has a poor chance with a man like yourself. But things
  happen&mdash;unexpected accidents take place. A week ago it seemed to me that
  I had lost everything that made life worth living. I did not care for the
  future. I was quite resigned to serve my ten years' sentence out. But we hear
  things even in prison, we get scraps of news, we even see papers sometimes.
  That is what happened in my case. I saw in a paper that Tom Glynn was dead,
  that he had died in Paris after a long illness, following on an 'accident.'
  The 'accident' happened six months ago."</p>

  <p>Nodes shivered. Words were precious with him just for the moment.</p>

  <p>"I got ten years for the manslaughter of Wilfred Catling," Summers
  proceeded. "It was a bad case, and the judge was accused of erring on the
  side of clemency. I killed the best friend I ever had. I killed him because I
  was desperately hard up for money, and because I knew that he had made a will
  in my favour. And I killed him so that he should not discover that I had
  forged a cheque upon his banking account for £500. The jury were induced to
  believe that there was a violent quarrel, and that blows were exchanged.
  There was just a possibility that I did not really mean to kill the man whom
  I loved as a brother, and that saved my neck. But you know all about that,
  because you gave evidence at the trial. I was duly convicted, and there is an
  end of it&mdash;or rather, there was an end of it. And when my time is up,
  and I come out of gaol, I shall be free to enjoy the fortune of the man whom
  I am supposed to have murdered! But it will be too late then&mdash;long
  before that time you will become the husband of Mary Glynn. I could have
  hanged for all you cared. And I am going to hang you, my friend, hang you
  with a rope of snow."</p>

  <p>"Miss Glynn and myself are not even engaged," Nodes stammered.</p>

  <p>"That I am quite prepared to believe," Summers went on. "In the light of
  recent illumination, I am prepared to believe that she does not know what has
  happened to me. After the 'accident' to her brother, she went over to Paris
  with him to see a specialist. She probably made a devoted nurse&mdash;whilst
  she had Tom to look after she could think of nothing else. Very few people
  knew of the relationship in which we stood to each other. I knew none of her
  friends. I waited for her to come forward till it was forced upon me that she
  had turned against me. I had no idea that she had hurried Tom off to Paris. I
  only gathered that from the newspaper paragraph I was telling you about just
  now. A lot of things came clear to me as I sat in my cell the last few days.
  I wrote a letter or two, but no reply came. I decided to try to escape. Luck
  came my way&mdash;and, in short, I am here."</p>

  <p>"What do you expect that I can do for you?" Nodes asked timidly.</p>

  <p>"Not more than you can help," Summers laughed. "If I had found you alone
  last night, I might have done something to justify my sentence. I rather
  fancy that I should have killed you, my friend! But as I listened to your
  conversation with Henderson, and learnt the facts you told him, another idea
  occurred to me. I learnt, for instance, how it was that Mary Glynn never came
  near me. I became quite sure of the way in which poor Wilfred Catling came by
  his death. Then, as I gathered how you intended to spend this
  evening&mdash;this typical Christmas Eve&mdash;and how you were going to get
  to the Gate House, the whole thing came upon me like an inspiration. Get your
  kit bag down&mdash;it is time you began to dress."</p>

  <p>Nodes proceeded to obey. There was something grimly determined about his
  companion, some suggestion that there was unfortunately worse to follow than
  this. With a shaking hand he turned kit bag and dressing-case out on the
  seat. Summers nodded approval behind his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Very good," he said. "Here we have everything that may become a man of
  fashion. You have prudently brought your dressing-case, and possibly you may
  stay the night. I am delighted to see that you use safety razors. My hair is
  fortunately about the right length, but I sadly need a shave. Do it!"</p>

  <p>Nodes started. Summers' request was stern and threatening.</p>

  <p>"Well, get on," he snapped. "Here is the shaving stick, and the brush and
  the razor. Get hot water and another towel. You are going to shave me. You
  can't cut my throat with that razor. But you can shave me, and the jolting of
  the carriage makes no difference. Get on with your work."</p>

  <p>Nodes complied. It was just as well, perhaps, to humour this desperado. On
  the whole, he made an exceedingly good job of it. With Nodes close under his
  eye, Summers made something like a bath. Then he proceeded to turn over
  Nodes's evening kit.</p>

  <p>"Everything here," he said. "An entire change from head to foot. Silk
  socks and underwear, pearl stud, half a dozen dress ties in case of
  accidents. We are about the same size&mdash;in the days when we were friends
  we borrowed one another's collars."</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you going to do?" Nodes stammered.</p>

  <p>"Why, put your dress clothes on, of course. When the operation is
  completed I flatter myself that I shall look very nice. I shall still have
  ten minutes to spare when I have finished. I won't put the coat on yet,
  because I have a little work to do first. Really, it was very good of you to
  make up your mind to change in the train. My little plan would have been a
  complete failure otherwise."</p>

  <p>"But you cannot possibly gain anything by this," Nodes protested.</p>

  <p>"Think not? But you are not altogether behind the scenes, Mr. Nodes. I am
  not going to ask you to pass me off as a friend of yours, so that I can leave
  the train in safety. I am not going to ask you to lend me your dress clothes
  and make an apology for turning up at Gate House in a morning suit. In that
  case I should simply have borrowed the clothes you are wearing at this
  moment. As a matter of fact, I am not asking any favour at all. I am simply
  making use of you. Take your things off!"</p>

  <p>Nodes protested. But he was past all resistance now. What little courage
  he had possessed had left him. Very slowly and reluctantly he divested
  himself of his garments. It was none too warm, and he shivered. He waited
  with sickening anxiety for the next scene in the drama. Summers indicated the
  hideous covering he had so recently discarded. He pointed to this
  sternly.</p>

  <p>"Put them on!" he said. "If you decline I shall force you to do so. You
  were always afraid of pain, but you are going to experience it now if you
  don't do as you are told."</p>

  <p>There came something like tears in Nodes's eyes as he compiled. He
  demurred bitterly to the command that he should remove all his
  underclothing.</p>

  <p>"Can't be permitted," Summers said curtly. "It would spoil all my
  carefully-laid plans. It is absolutely necessary that you should be dressed
  exactly as I was. Ah! that is better. You will see in a moment why I have not
  yet donned your dress-coat. I have some work to do first. Now, you are
  probably aware of the fact that this train slows up for a few hundred yards
  this side of Formgrave Station. It is at a point where the line crosses the
  marshes. At this critical moment you are going to leave the train. I am going
  to throw you into one of the deep drifts of snow by the side of the line. A
  typical Christmas, is it not? There is no danger; you will not be a bit hurt,
  though the odds are that you will be exceedingly damp. All you have to do
  afterwards is to crawl out on to the line again and make your way to
  Formgrave. You will tell your story there, and when you do so, the betting is
  that nobody will believe you. They will refuse to credit so preposterous a
  tale. You look a pretty disreputable object now, but nothing to what you will
  appear when you have emerged from that snowy ditch. You will have no proof of
  what you say, and you will probably be detained till the police have been
  sent for. I should say that a good twenty-four hours will elapse before the
  authorities are satisfied that a mistake has been made. Meanwhile, I shall
  have succeeded in my scheme, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, Summers," Nodes gasped, "be careful. This mad business
  will be the death of me. And I utterly fail to see why you should hurt me in
  this revolting fashion."</p>

  <p>Summers' face grew dark. For the first time, there was hatred as well as
  contempt in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ask yourself a question or two," he said. "Cast your mind back to the
  events of six months ago. But for you I should never have been in my present
  unhappy position. At my trial you could have told the story of that forged
  cheque, had you liked. But you wanted me convicted, you wanted me out of the
  way. And as things turned out I did not mind. I was deserted by everybody I
  cared for, and the rest mattered nothing. Come this way&mdash;the train is
  slackening speed."</p>

  <p>Nodes crept unwillingly across the floor. His legs were shaking under him.
  Peering out into the darkness, he could see dimly a flat country, with great
  drifts of snow gleaming here and there. The footboard of the carriage
  overhung what seemed like water. Without another word Summers caught his
  companion by the collar and swung him clear of the train. He dropped like a
  plummet up to his waist in the feathery white mass. Cold and tearful, but
  quite unharmed, he crept on to the line again, forlornly watching the tail
  lights of the train growing fainter in the distance. Summers closed the door
  of the carriage, and took another cigarette from Nodes' case.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Reginald Norfolk's guests had assembled for dinner in the
  drawing-room. The circle of diners was complete save one&mdash;they were
  waiting for Raymond Nodes. The host looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I expect the train's a little late," he said.</p>

  <p>"I've sent the car to meet it. In any case, your friend can't be very long
  now. I hope you are not feeling anxious about him, Mary."</p>

  <p>Mary Glynn shook her head. She only half comprehended what Norfolk was
  saying. Her mind was very far away at the moment. There were one or two women
  there asking themselves why it was that men voted Mary Glynn to be such a
  pretty girl. She looked horribly white and aged; the black dress she was
  wearing merely served to throw up the unhealthy pallor of her cheeks. True,
  she had had a good deal of trouble lately&mdash;she had lost her brother, but
  that did not account for everything. She was trying to say something
  appropriate now, when the door was flung open, and the butler announced Mr.
  Raymond Nodes.</p>

  <p>He came forward, coolly and easily, and shook hands with his host and
  hostess. He said just the right thing. Then he lounged across the room
  towards Mary Glynn. She had not even glanced up at him, she was contemplating
  the floor in the same abstracted way.</p>

  <p>"I know you will be glad to see me," Summers said in a thrilling
  whisper.</p>

  <p>Something like a cry escaped Mary's lips. A clatter of conversation was
  going on all round. As Mary looked up the deadly pallor of her face grew
  ghastly. Then the blood flashed to her cheeks again, there was something in
  her eyes between joy and fear.</p>

  <p>"Be brave," Summers whispered. "Nobody has noticed anything. I was fearful
  lest you should betray yourself. But luck has been on my side all through,
  and it is not going to fail me now. This is not a nice thing that I have
  done, Mary, but practically there is no other way. Everybody says that Reggie
  Norfolk is a real good fellow, and I am sure that he will forgive me when the
  time for explanation comes."</p>

  <p>"But I thought," Mary gasped. "I thought that you were&mdash;you
  were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In prison. So I was. And, what is more, I had no desire to get away until
  I discovered that Tom was dead. Then I knew that the time had come when I
  could speak. The strange part of it is that I should not have been here at
  all had it not been for Nodes. I found out that he did not know Norfolk; I
  found out that you were here. Nodes was going to dress in the train, and he
  engaged a compartment to himself. I'll tell you presently how I managed to
  get on to all this. Anyway, I boarded the train, and compelled Nodes to
  change clothes with me. Somewhere about this time he is telling his story to
  a set of people who will not believe a single word that he says. They will
  naturally take him for the escaped convict, and detain him for the police to
  make inquiries. Long before his identity is established, and the authorities
  are after me, I shall have proved my innocence."</p>

  <p>"I know that you are innocent," Mary murmured. "Will you believe me when I
  tell you that not till the day before yesterday did I know that your friend,
  Wilfred Catling, was dead? That you had been convicted on a charge of killing
  him came as a terrible shock to me. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Presently," Summers whispered. "We shall have our chance after dinner.
  Meanwhile your hostess is making signals to the ladies. I take it for granted
  that I am going to be your escort. Of course, I am not exactly so fascinating
  as Nodes, but still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mary squeezed her companion's arm. Nobody could say that she was pale and
  cold now. She was trembling between fear and joy. She was longing for the
  meal to come to an end, so that she could hear the much-needed explanation.
  It was maddening to sit there with the lights and the chatter, the gleam of
  the silver, and the din of voices about her. She played with the food on her
  plate, she toyed with her glass. It was with a deep drawn sigh of relief
  presently that she saw her hostess rise.</p>

  <p>"There is a little conservatory at the end of the hall," she whispered.
  "When you have finished your cigarettes, you will find me waiting for you
  there. And for heaven's sake, don't be long, Rick."</p>

  <p>Summers slipped away at the first favourable opportunity. In spite of
  everything, he had enjoyed his coffee and cigarette, the refined
  surroundings, and the talk of his fellow-men. He made for the dim little
  conservatory, where Mary was waiting for him. He flung himself down by her
  side, and attempted to draw her to him. She placed a trembling hand on his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she said, "not yet, Rick. You must hear what I have to say
  first. I must tell you of a dreadful thing that only came to light the night
  before my brother died. There was really no hope for him from the first, but
  I did my best. For six months I saw nobody over there in Paris: I had no time
  to look at any English papers. All I knew before I went to Paris was that my
  brother and Wilfred Catling had been in an accident together. But I did not
  know that Mr. Catling was dead. I did not know that you had been charged with
  taking his life. But Tom knew. He read the papers that he never gave me to
  look at. And the night before he died, he told me why he had been so
  depressed. It was he who had forged the cheque that was the cause of all the
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"I knew that all along," Summers said quietly. "And what's more, Catling
  knew before he died. If Tom had not been your brother, I should have spoken
  long ago. But it seemed to me that it did not matter. Yet, when everybody
  appeared to have deserted me, I could see how foolish I had been. Still, it
  was too late to speak then, and I was too desperately miserable to care what
  happened to me. It was only when I found out that Tom was dead that I decided
  to clear my character, and make some sort of an attempt to restore myself in
  your eyes again. I thought, of course, that you knew all about it. It was
  only when I escaped and attempted to see Nodes that I learnt pretty well
  everything by listening to a conversation between Nodes and his friend
  Henderson. I believe that I should have killed him had we met a few moments
  before. As it was, I thought of a much better plan than that. I worked out
  this scheme to see you this evening, and it has proved absolutely successful.
  We need say nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Mary firmly, "we need. The whole truth must be spoken. And the
  part that Mr. Nodes has taken in this vile conspiracy must be public
  property. And after that, if you still care to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dearest girl, how can you doubt it? If the circumstances were
  reversed, then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, a girl is different from a man. You see, I always loved you Rick,
  and I was so hurt when I got no letter from you in Paris. Probably you wrote
  to me. Probably Tom suppressed the letters."</p>

  <p>Summers preferred to ignore the point. He turned to Mary, and kissed the
  tears from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"What difference does it make?" he asked. "Tom's folly cannot touch you.
  There will be a few days' gossip and scandal and then everything will be
  forgotten. And you and I together, my dearest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Summers stopped suddenly. His host of a night stood in the doorway of the
  conservatory, with a queer expression on his face. Two police officers were
  in the library, together with a strange gentleman. They had had an amazing
  story to tell. Would Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Nodes be so good as to&mdash;?</p>

  <p>Mary grasped her lover's arm. The happy colour faded from her face. He
  touched her tenderly.</p>

  <p>"It has come," he said "I shall be very happy to give you the explanation
  you need, Mr. Norfolk, and the sooner the better. I shall tender you an
  apology later, and that, I hope, you will accept. And now I am anxious to see
  the gentleman in the library. Mary, I shall not be long."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">The bells were chiming from the village church across the
  snow. Under the porch of the house a troop of children were singing a carol
  Mary listened to it all dreamily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, Rick would not be long. And to-morrow was Christmas
  Day!"</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY ALEC BALL</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol XXXVI, Jul 1912, pp
  233-238</h3><br>

  <p class="first">FLEETWOOD stumbled across the gangway of the Sheffield and
  staggered into the arms of a purser. Just for a moment he was on the point of
  collapse. By the time he had caught his breath again, and a little colour was
  beginning to creep into his cheek, the boat was slowly beginning to make its
  way out of the dock. It was yet very dark and still, for the dawn was a full
  hour off, and the decks were deserted so far as every passenger was
  concerned. The purser grinned good-naturedly as he steadied Fleetwood on his
  shaking legs.</p>

  <p>"That's a pretty near shave, sir," he said. "Did you manage to get your
  baggage on board?"</p>

  <p>"I have no baggage," Fleetwood explained. "I have practically nothing
  besides my kitbag, and someone on the quay kindly threw that after me. I
  hadn't even time to get a ticket. An hour ago I had not the least intention
  of leaving England to-day."</p>

  <p>The purser ceased to smile. Fleetwood had spoken candidly enough, he had a
  frank, open way of looking the world in the face, but these little things do
  not always spell honesty, and the purser had seen enough of men and things
  not to take everything absolutely for granted.</p>

  <p>"I think you had better see the captain, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"That's precisely what I want," Fleetwood replied.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later he found himself closeted in the cabin of the Sheffield
  with the captain. And Captain Butcher made no secret of the fact that he did
  not like it at all.</p>

  <p>"You must see for yourself that it is very unusual," he said. "Of course,
  there's no help for it now. But if you had come to me half an hour before, I
  might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear sir," Fleetwood expostulated, "is it an unusual thing for a
  business man to find himself compelled to catch a boat a moment's notice? As
  I explained to your purser, I didn't know an hour ago whether I should be
  leaving England to-day. It's a matter of life and death. You've got me here
  for a fortnight&mdash;I can't run away&mdash;and you can keep as close an eye
  upon me as you like; and, as far as my passage is concerned, I can pay that
  ten times over. How does that strike you?"</p>

  <p>Fleetwood took a sheaf of notes from his pocket-book and laid them on the
  table. Butcher's face relaxed a little.</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, we must make the best of it," he said. "I'm glad you recognised
  my position in the matter. And now you'll be wanting a cabin. By the way, you
  haven't told me if you intend to go the whole way with us."</p>

  <p>Fleetwood's face grew a little grim and hard.</p>

  <p>"That I cannot say," he said. "Possibly my business may be finished by the
  time we get to Madeira. I suppose in your time, captain, you have seen many a
  drama played out with this ship for a background? And, unless I'm greatly
  mistaken, you're going to watch one now. But that is entirely between you and
  me. And now may I ask to be shown to my cabin?"</p>

  <p>A day or two passed pleasantly enough, and gradually the Sheffield's
  passengers began to shake down together. She was not a great boat, and the
  saloon boasted no more than forty all told. For the most part, they were
  Colonials, and not at all difficult from a social point of view. There was a
  frankness and directness about Fleetwood that won for him a certain degree of
  popularity. He had travelled widely&mdash;indeed, his profession of mining
  engineer had enabled him to come in touch with many countries in the
  world&mdash;he was a good talker and bridge player, so that he was speedily
  on the best of terms with everybody. Captain Butcher had long since forgotten
  his suspicions, so that Fleetwood's position was quite a pleasant one.</p>

  <p>There was only one passenger who appeared to hold aloof from the rest. He
  was a dark, rather taciturn man, who had given the name of Cree. For the
  rest, he was supposed to be a merchant with interests somewhere in Rhodesia.
  There was something attractive and yet repellant about the man, and on more
  than one occasion Fleetwood made an attempt to draw him out. But, according
  to his own account, Cree's time was too occupied to enable him to join in the
  festivities of the ship. He spent most of the day in his cabin, and the only
  time he showed himself was after dinner in the smoking-room, when the other
  male passengers were more or less occupied with their bridge.</p>

  <p>On the fifth night of the voyage the bridge play was over earlier than
  usual. Fleetwood rose from the table with two companions, and made his way
  over to the remote corner of the smoking-room where Cree was pulling at his
  pipe in moody silence. He would have escaped if he could, only just at the
  moment that the bridge was finished he had ordered another whisky and soda,
  and one of the late players had insisted upon Cree joining them, so that
  there was no help for it. It was not the first drink by a good many that Cree
  had had since dinner, and the fact had not escaped Fleetwood's attention.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment or two the talk was general, then it veered gradually
  round to the occult as understood by travellers who had studied the subject
  in the East. Fleetwood spoke freely and well, for he knew Tibet, and the ways
  of the Mahatma were familiar to him. His hearers followed him with interest,
  and one of them, a tea-planter named Stephenson, had a strange story, too, to
  tell. It was an interesting conversation, and not the less so because Cree
  sat there nursing his long peg glass with a shaky hand and openly sneering at
  Stephenson's yarn.</p>

  <p>"Do you honestly believe all that nonsense?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you call it nonsense, do you?" Fleetwood said quietly. "I could tell
  you a story which you'd have to believe. I suppose your opinion is formed by
  what you read in the newspapers. They are not all to be laughed at, you know,
  and I'd like to have a sporting bet with you, Mr. Cree. I'll bet you a
  five-pound note that I can give you a demonstration of occultism that will
  keep you here till I've finished. All I stipulate is that you should listen
  for a quarter of an hour, and, if at the end of that time you like to leave
  us, then the fiver is yours. Now, come, is it a bet or not?"</p>

  <p>An ugly sneer crossed Cree's face.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you four times the amount," he said. "Now, what's it to
  be&mdash;hypnotism or blindfold thought-reading, or that crystal-gazing
  humbug? I've seen them all myself in different parts of the world, and, if I
  had my way, I'd clap all those rogues in gaol. Here, waiter, bring me another
  drink, and see that you put in some whisky this time that I can taste."</p>

  <p>"Which do you consider the cheapest form of humbug?" Fleetwood asked. "I
  want to give you every chance."</p>

  <p>"Oh, crystal-gazing," Cree muttered contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Then crystal-gazing it shall be. Didn't you say that you had got a
  crystal somewhere, Stephenson?"</p>

  <p>"I believe I have," Stephenson replied. "I've got the whole bag o' tricks
  in my cabin."</p>

  <p>Stephenson returned to the smoking-room a few minutes later with the globe
  of glass in his hand. Fleetwood turned it round thoughtfully, holding the
  sphere so that the rays of the electric light fell on it. Then he placed it
  on the table and gazed long and earnestly at it, until he seemed utterly lost
  to all surroundings. Cree would have uttered some jibe had not Stephenson
  checked him with a warning glance. A moment or two later, and Fleetwood began
  to speak. His voice sounded distant and hollow, his eyes appeared to have
  lost their expression altogether.</p>

  <p>"What do you see?" Stephenson asked.</p>

  <p>"It's all blurred and indistinct at present," Fleetwood said. "Wait, and
  it will grow clearer presently. Ah, I begin to make it out! Here is a
  room&mdash;a room barely furnished, with no carpet on the floor; there is
  only a table and a chair or two, and a roll-top desk between the two windows.
  The room is a large one, the panels of the walls are of oak, and the ceiling
  is the work of Inigo Jones or one of his pupils. It can be nothing but a
  London house in a suburb which at one time was fashionable. Now it is
  surrounded by slums and workmen's tenements, because I can hear the shrill
  voices of women and the crying of children. Though the room is so barely
  furnished, the two candelabra on the writing-desk are old silver, and the
  clock on the mantelpiece is genuine Sevres. It is just like the scene in 'Les
  Cloches de Corneville' where Gaspard is discovered counting over his
  money."</p>

  <p>"This is devilish interesting!" one of the audience murmured. "All humbug,
  though, I suppose, Stephenson&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"I've seen too many strange things in the East to disbelieve, Maple,"
  Stephenson whispered. "At any rate, our cynical friend yonder is not
  altogether indifferent. Look at him."</p>

  <p>Maple glanced in Cree's direction. His white, set face was twitching, and
  his teeth were bare in an unsteady grin. As a waiter hovered near, he
  indicated his empty glass. All this time Fleetwood was going on in a steady
  monotone.</p>

  <p>"The miser must be somewhere, though I cannot see him yet. His desk is
  open, and in the light of the candles I can see some bags of money and piles
  of bank-notes. Ah, he's beginning to come at last! He is a little, dried-up
  man, with a black velvet skull-cap on his scant and silvery hair. He closes
  the door behind him and looks about him fearfully as if afraid of being seen.
  Despite his years and the yellow parchment of his face, his black eyes have
  all the fire and vivacity of youth. See, he is seated by his desk, turning
  over his money and counting it again and again. The door opens, and a young
  girl comes in. She is dressed as if she had just come out of the street; she
  is clad in shabby garments, and her pretty face is pinched and wan. She looks
  as if she knew what it was to go without proper food. Directly she comes in,
  the old man pulls down the lid of his desk and turns towards her with an
  angry frown upon his face. The girl is pleading for something, for she holds
  out her hands to the old man, she falls on her knees at his feet. Then very
  reluctantly and slowly he takes from his pocket a small silver coin, and
  hands it to the girl with an expression of resignation on his face. But what
  have we got here? The corner of the ragged blind is on one side, and the pale
  outline of a face can be seen beyond the grimy pane. It is a white, set face
  with dark, restless, greedy eyes, and a mouth slightly twisted on the left
  side."</p>

  <p>"So's mine, for that matter," Cree laughed.</p>

  <p>No one else spoke&mdash;they were all deeply interested in following
  Fleetwood's strange story. He did not appear to hear the interruption, for he
  went on steadily.</p>

  <p>"The girl vanishes, and a young man takes her place. He is a fine
  youngster enough, with a bronzed face and blue eyes. But the bronzed face is
  convulsed in rage now, and the blue eyes are blazing. Just for the moment it
  looks as if the old man went in peril of his life; then the young man throws
  himself down in the chair and begins to take his boots off. He leaves his
  boots by the side of the fireplace, and produces a pair of carpet slippers
  from a cupboard in the wall. It is plain that the young man lives in the
  house, for he leaves the room presently, and a door bangs sullenly in a
  bedroom overhead. The Sevres clock over the mantelpiece strikes the hour of
  twelve. It is impossible to tell the time by the face of the clock, because
  one of the hands is missing."</p>

  <p>"Waiter," Cree cried hoarsely, "more drink!"</p>

  <p>"The white face disappears from the window. The door of the room opens,
  and the white face and the uneasy, glittering eyes come in. The old man turns
  from his desk, and for the first time his eyes are full of fear. He crosses
  over to lay his hand upon the tattered bell-pull, but the other man bars the
  way. The old man struggles. For his age, he is marvellously strong and
  active, but at last he staggers and falls, and a cry for help breaks from his
  lips. There is an open knife on the mantelpiece&mdash;the sort of knife that
  sailors generally use. The knife has probably been left there by the young
  man who is upstairs in his bedroom. Oh, it is horrible to watch what follows!
  The old man lies there in a pool of blood on the bare floor. He is dead. He
  has been murdered by the man with the white face and the restless eyes."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, it sounds quite real!" Maple whispered. "I say, Mr. Cree,
  you've lost your bet. It's quite half an hour since the seance
  began&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>But Cree made no reply. He sat there absolutely engrossed in what was
  going on. At every pause that Fleetwood made, he wriggled with an impatience
  that was almost painful to witness.</p>

  <p>"The knife lies on the floor by the dead man's side. Evidently the
  murderer is no stranger to the house, because he knows exactly what to do. He
  takes off his own shoes and picks up the pair of boots belonging to the lad
  who is asleep upstairs. He dips the soles of the boots in the pool of blood
  and slips them on his own feet. Then, snatching one of the candles from the
  stand, he makes a series of red footsteps on the bare boards leading into the
  hall. He is concocting evidence against the innocent boy upstairs. He crosses
  to the desk and places everything he can find there in a bag. There are a
  good many thousands' worth of property&mdash;twenty-three thousand seven
  hundred and fifty, to be correct; a memorandum in the old man's handwriting
  shows that. All grows indistinct for a moment."</p>

  <p>"You've lost your bet, Cree," Maple chuckled.</p>

  <p>"It is all coming distinct again. And here is another man&mdash;a man who
  gazes with horror at the object on the floor. This man pulls violently at the
  bell, the young man from above comes down, the room is full of people, and
  the police are here. They ask questions, they clear the room, they find that
  knife and those tell-tale footprints. But they do not find a pocket-book and
  a cake of tobacco manufactured by a firm in Cape Town, which the man who
  discovered the body picked up, for the simple reason that he has hidden these
  things in his pocket. Then the young man with the blue eyes goes off in
  charge of the police, and once more the crystal grows blurred and misty."</p>

  <p>No word was uttered as Fleetwood rose and stretched himself. Apparently
  Cree had forgotten all about his bet, for he sat there white and rigid, his
  eyes strained and full of a certain awe. But Fleetwood had not finished yet.
  He bent once more over the crystal, and began to speak again.</p>

  <p>"I see many pictures now. I see keen-eyed men bending over the pocket-book
  and cake of tobacco. In some way I know that they are detectives from
  Scotland Yard. The man who discovered the dead body must have sent the
  evidence on to them. I see them comparing those boots with the footprints; I
  see them examining the grease stains from the candle across the floor. They
  are asking themselves why a young man who knows the house so well should need
  a candle. They have found out all about the owner of the pocket-book; they
  have discovered that he only landed in England four hours before the murder,
  and they are after him before he can leave the country again. But they are
  too late&mdash;he has already vanished. Still, he is not destined to escape.
  For the man who discovered the body is after him; and the pursuer has the
  advantage of having seen a photograph of the murderer, and this advantage is
  all on one side. It comes to me in some way that the murderer is a
  ne'er-do-well nephew of the poor old man, who has come home on purpose to rob
  him.</p>

  <p>"And then I see long, black buildings and a forest of shipping, and I see
  a vessel leaving the docks, and a man gain her decks just in the nick of
  time. And I see myself at this moment with this crystal in my hand."</p>

  <p>A strange, strangled cry came from Cree's lips as he rose unsteadily to
  his feet. The empty glass fell from his hand and crashed upon the floor. He
  seemed to be struggling hard for some form of collected speech.</p>

    <img src="1301021h-images/TheHandInvisible.jpg"
         title="He seemed to be struggling hard.">
  </div>

  <p>"It's all arrant humbug!" he said hoarsely. "Did anyone ever hear such a
  farrago of nonsense? How you men supposed to be possessed of common-sense can
  sit down and listen to it, I don't know. For me, I'm going to bed."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all very well!" Maple protested. "If it's all nonsense like
  that, why did you stay so long? You've lost your bet, though you seem to have
  forgotten it."</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of something else," Cree muttered. "I had actually
  forgotten all about the bet. Still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He plunged his hand in his pocket, but Fleetwood shook his head. His face
  was grim and hard now.</p>

  <p>"And if I refuse to take the money?" he asked. "It is morally and legally
  wrong to bet on a certainty, and it was a certainty from the first that Mr.
  Cree would stay and hear every word that I had to utter. We will defer the
  question of the bet till to-morrow morning. Meanwhile I have to wish Mr. Cree
  good night, and may his dreams be as pleasant as he deserves."</p>

  <p>Without another word Cree turned on his heel and left the smoking-room. He
  was followed a few moments later by Fleetwood, who declined to carry the
  matter any further just then. He was tired and exhausted with his mental
  effort, and, if the audience had anything further to say, he would rather it
  was deferred till the next morning.</p>

  <p>Maple and Stephenson followed him quietly and thoughtfully out of the
  smoking-room.</p>

  <p>"There's something devilish queer about this," the former exclaimed. "Made
  me feel quite creepy. And did you happen to see Cree's face? Never have I
  seen such abject funk in my life before. The chap was absolutely livid. Now,
  what do you make of it, Stephenson? If it was humbug&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Stephenson declined to be drawn.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's no humbug," he said, "and, incidentally, it's no business of
  ours. Keep your eyes open and ask no questions, and you'll see things before
  long. Good night, old chap."</p>

  <p>But Fleetwood had not retired to bed. He sat there smoking till far into
  the night; his electrics were burning, and he seemed to be waiting for
  something. It came presently towards morning; there was a timid tap on the
  door, and a white, ghastly face looked in. The ghastliness of feature and the
  glaring, tired eyes were in almost amusing contrast to the gaudy suit of
  pyjamas that Cree was wearing.</p>

  <p>"May I come in?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"I've been waiting for you for hours," Fleetwood said quietly. "Sit down
  and tell your story in your own way."</p>

  <p>But Cree paced up and down the cabin.</p>

  <p>"I can't sit down," he whined. "Fleetwood, you are the devil! I've heard
  of these things before, and I've never believed them; and yet I cannot doubt
  the evidence of my senses. What brought those pictures in the crystal? Why,
  out of millions of people, was I selected as the victim?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is a picture from your own life, then?" Fleetwood asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you know it you devil," Cree screamed, "and yet, as far as I know,
  you were on this boat before the murder was committed."</p>

  <p>"The murder of Stephen Syme, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Why should I deny it? Do you know, till to-night I never discovered that
  I had left that pocket-book and that packet of tobacco behind me. I could
  have screamed aloud when you got to that part of the story. If you have
  tricked me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Keep to the point," Fleetwood said sternly, "and remember that I never
  asked you to make a confession."</p>

  <p>"But the police are after me," Cree whined; "you told me all about it when
  you were reading the crystal. And you had got it as clear as if you had been
  there and seen it all yourself. I came back from South Africa on purpose to
  see the old man and get money out of him. I didn't care much how I obtained
  it, and nobody knew that I was coming. It was no difficult matter to get into
  the house. When I saw the old man sitting at his desk, with all that money
  about him&mdash;well, I am a desperate man, and the temptation was too much
  for me. He was a miserable old miser. I have known his own daughter appeal to
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know," Fleetwood said quietly. "I am engaged to Mary Syme, and I came
  back on purpose to marry her. But I am saying a little bit too much. You go
  on with your story."</p>

  <p>"There is no more story to tell," Cree resumed. "The temptation was too
  much for me. Within ten minutes I was out of the house and on my way to the
  docks. I had all that money with me, and the comfortable assurance that I
  should be on the 'Sheffield' before anybody knew that I was in London. Oh,
  I'm not defending myself! It was a blackguardly thing on my part to try and
  throw the blame on young Matthew Syme. Anyway, I shall know how to meet my
  punishment when the time comes. You'll find all that money in my cabin, and,
  as for the rest, it must take care of itself. I can't sleep,
  Fleetwood&mdash;I dare not be alone!"</p>

  <p>Cree clasped his hands to his eyes and rushed from the cabin. A moment
  later there was a cry and a noise overhead, and a hoarse voice yelling that a
  man was overboard.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>"Of course, he was utterly puzzled," Fleetwood told the captain. "He died
  a firm believer in the dark mysteries of the crystal. You see, I had chapter
  and verse of the things that happened, a day or two after the 'Sheffield'
  left port, and Cree knew that every item was correct. I was going to see old
  Syme, and I practically met Cree on the doorstep of the miser's house as he
  was hurrying off after the murder. I knew him from his photograph, but he did
  not know me. I heard him ask a boy to get him a cab; I followed and heard the
  address given. Then I found the evidence of the crime, and ten minutes after
  I was on Cree's track, only just in time. Sentiment is all very well, but I
  was anxious to save the money for the family. That is why I played that
  theatrical game and frightened a confession out of him. If he had landed in
  South Africa, he would certainly have got rid of the money, probably feeling
  that there was a chance of being arrested. It sounds cheap, but it was very
  effectual."</p>

  <p>"Not so clever as he thought," Butcher smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, or he would have guessed," Fleetwood replied. "And now I shall be
  obliged if you will tell me what I owe you for all those expensive
  marconigrams?"</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY SEPTIMUS E. SCOTT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXXVI, Aug 1912, pp
  263-267</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE little man with the white face and gleaming eyes
  struggled no longer. He was spent and breathless; a little, thin, red thread
  trickled from a wound in his forehead. He had dropped to his knees in the
  snow. Above him the pine trees tossed and twisted in the blizzard, the thin
  white powder stung his cheek. He looked a pathetic object enough, and all the
  more slender and helpless by contrast with the three Westerners who stood
  about him. There was no suggestion of pity or compunction in the eyes of
  those picturesque ruffians. The little man was looking for no
  mercy&mdash;indeed, that was an asset he had not counted upon for a moment.
  He was not going to ask for quarter, either. His life hung upon a thread, and
  he knew it.</p>

  <p>"Wal, ain't you goin' to speak?" the leader of the trio asked. "We ain't
  out shootin' rabbits. We ain't goin' to spell it for you, either. What we
  want to know, and what we're goin' to know, is the name of the man who
  rounded up poor Bill Carney. You was present, and you seen it done."</p>

  <p>"I guess that's so," the little man snapped, "but you can't make me speak
  if I don't want to."</p>

  <p>The leader of the gang smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"I calculate we can," he said. "Now, just you listen to me, stranger. I
  dunno as you know much about these parts, but there's considerable snow
  comin'&mdash;a matter o' six feet before mornin'. Now, I'll kinder draw your
  attention to that pine branch what's hangin' over your head. The programme,
  sonny, is to tie your hands behind you an' put a rawhide round your neck,
  so's to keep you dancin' on the tips of your toes. The other end of the
  rawhide will be round the pine branch. When the snow comes up to your neck,
  you sing out for the waiter. He won't be far off. An' the beauty of the game
  is that you can call our hand whenever you like."</p>

  <p>The little man said nothing. He pressed his lips more tightly together,
  and his eyes gleamed like slumbering fires.</p>

  <p>Over his head the pines were tossing and moaning like creatures in pain.
  The upper branches were hidden in the flying wrack of snow; already in the
  hollow there the white battalions of the storm were beginning to assemble.
  The little man made no movement of any kind as his hands were secured behind
  him and the rawhide adjusted. The end of the rope was cast dexterously over
  the branch and drawn tightly&mdash;so tightly, indeed, that the victim could
  merely feel the frozen ground with his toes.</p>

         title="His hands were secured behind him.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Now, for the last time," the chief ruffian asked, "are you goin' to spell
  it or not? A white man was Bill Carney&mdash;there ain't a whiter man on the
  Amurican continent, 'ceptin', p'raps, Captain Rufus himself&mdash;an' we
  ain't goin' to set down shellin' popcorn while high-minded citizens is bein'
  shot like dogs."</p>

  <p>The little man turned with a bitter sneer.</p>

  <p>"Never a greater skunk drew the breath of life than Carney," he said; "and
  if there is a more poisonous reptile up here, it's the man you call Captain
  Rufus. I saw Carney shot&mdash;I know whose hand it was that rid the world of
  a loathsome scoundrel. He was killed in fair fight by a better man than
  himself, and you can tell Rufus that his time is coming, too."</p>

  <p>"Hear him talk!" another of the gang laughed. "Anybody might think as he
  was David Hames. Ever see him, sonny?"</p>

  <p>"More than once," the little man said quietly. "He doesn't come this way,
  I understand. It will be a bad day for you and your kidney if he does take it
  in his head to come into the Lone Wolf district. Any of you know him?"</p>

  <p>Apparently none of them did, though they seemed to listen in respectful
  silence to that dreaded name. The snow was getting deeper now; the little
  man's face was more drawn and livid, yet there was no sign of surrender in
  his eyes. With an oath, the leader of the gang turned away, bidding his
  companions to follow him. There was a hut on the far side of the hollow,
  where it would be possible to while away the time over a game of poker, till,
  in the picturesque language of Pete Stanley, the little man decided to throw
  up the sponge and 'spell it.' That the stranger would eventually essay the
  task in question, Mr. Stanley did not for a moment doubt. He was an expert in
  these matters.</p>

  <p>An hour passed slowly. The snow was getting deeper, and the little man's
  face was whiter than the powder on his hair, yet his jaw was fixed and rigid,
  and the unconquerable fires were still burning in his eyes. The howling wind
  dropped for a moment, and it seemed to the man standing half-frozen there as
  if someone above was calling him. He turned his head, and, to his
  astonishment, made out the figure of a woman crawling painfully along the
  branch of the pine from which the rope was suspended. He could see the dull
  gleam of a knife in her hand. The rigid tension snapped, a black wisp lay for
  a moment breathless and half insensible on the snow, then the little man rose
  and climbed painfully up the slope to the spot where the woman was
  standing.</p>

  <p>"I live close by," she whispered. "I had occasion to go down to the hut,
  and I heard what those men were talking about. I am Doctor Winter's
  wife."</p>

  <p>"I know him," the little man said. "Can you give me shelter? I shall be a
  different man to-morrow. And you need not be afraid, especially if you have
  any arms in the house."</p>

  <p>"There is no lack of those," Mrs. Winter said. "But pray come along
  quickly, before those dreadful men find out that you have escaped. Lean on my
  arm, please."</p>

  <p>Very gradually life and strength came back to the little man. He exchanged
  his wet clothes for dry ones, the grateful warmth of the stove thawed out his
  frozen limbs; a good meal had put fresh steel and fire in him. He sat up
  suddenly, rigid and alert.</p>

  <p>"Those men are outside," he whispered; "they have discovered my escape.
  They'll want to search the house. You look like a brave woman, Mrs.
  Winter."</p>

  <p>"I had to learn that after I came out from England," the woman said
  quietly. "I'm not going to give you up, if that is what you mean. I will do
  exactly what you suggest."</p>

  <p>The little man reached for a rifle and handled it with loving care. He
  pushed aside a corner of the blind and looked out. Surely enough, the three
  ruffians were standing there, apparently having an altercation of some kind.
  There was a small ventilator by the side of the window, which might be
  useful, a little later on, as a porthole. The altercation was apparently
  finished now, for Stanley strode up to the door and began to thunder on it
  furiously.</p>

  <p>"Come out, come out!" he cried. "We don't want to hurt a woman, but you've
  got a man hiding there. It won't pay you or the doctor to defy us. Now, open
  the door."</p>

  <p>"I open the door to no man in my husband's absence," Kate Winter cried
  defiantly, "and I warn you that I'm armed."</p>

  <p>Stanley muttered an oath in his beard and stalked back to his companions.
  The plan of attack soon became apparent, for two of the ruffians opened fire
  on the hut, whilst Stanley proceeded to drag a huge log of timber forward,
  obviously with the intention of battering in the door. He would be fairly
  safe so long as the other two directed their fire on the windows of the
  house. With a bitter smile on his white face, the little man lifted his rifle
  on the edge of the ventilator and covered Stanley. There was a crack, a tiny
  puff of smoke, and Stanley pitched forward heavily in the snow, lying there
  still and motionless. Once more the rifle spoke; a second man spun round on
  his heels and then sank gently on his knees, as if he were dropping
  innocently off to sleep. The third man dived for cover, and was seen no
  more.</p>

  <p>Kate Winter dropped into a chair and covered her face with her hands. The
  little man could see that she was shivering like a leaf.</p>

  <p>"I had to do it," he said. "It was their lives against yours and mine. You
  don't know those men&mdash;I do. There are four of them who have been keeping
  a reign of terror in Lone Wolf Gulch for years. There were five of them a
  little time ago, but the man called Carney died suddenly last week. And
  because I would not tell those ruffians who shot him, they were going to
  leave me to perish in the snow. They got me at a disadvantage for the first
  time in my life, but they would have dragged nothing out of me. Besides, it
  would never have done to have told them the name of the man who killed Bill
  Carney."</p>

  <p>"Did you really know it?" the woman asked.</p>

  <p>A queer, dry smile twisted the little man's lips.</p>

  <p>"Well, considering that I shot him myself, yes," he said. "Fortunately for
  me, those dogs didn't know that. Some old friends of mine fetched me from
  five hundred miles the other side of the mountains, to help wipe out Captain
  Rufus and his gang. There does not seem to be much law and order in these
  parts, and they say that the sheriff's in league with those ruffians. Well,
  at any rate, I've accounted for three of them now, and the captain himself
  will hear from me before long. Not that I want this thing talked about. I
  should like you to have the credit of this little entertainment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't!" Kate Winter cried.</p>

  <p>"Just a moment," the little man urged. "Let it be understood that Stanley
  and some of the gang attacked the house, and that you shot two of them
  single-handed. Depraved as those scoundrels are, they would never dare to
  take vengeance on a woman. You will have public opinion on your side, and
  this exploit should go far to bringing about a better state of things. There
  are hundreds of brave men and good citizens in these parts, and yet they
  hesitate to act for fear of incurring the displeasure of Rufus and his
  murderous gang. They'll have to do something now."</p>

  <p>"My husband is a busy man," Mrs. Winter murmured, "and it does not do for
  a doctor to make enemies. We want a real live man here&mdash;somebody who can
  get the best of Rufus, somebody who dare meet him face to face. Ah, if we
  could only have a man like David Hames to come to our assistance!"</p>

  <p>The little man smiled again.</p>

  <p>"To beard Rufus in his den, eh? To shoot him down in the midst of his
  satellites when he is drinking in his favourite bar? Well, that might be
  done. A man like Rufus always has more enemies than friends. The carneying
  crowd of sycophants who would applaud some cowardly deed of violence would be
  still more willing to cheer the man who rid the world of a creature like
  Rufus; and that is what I have come over five hundred miles to do."</p>

  <p>The man spoke quite simply and naturally. Small as he was, and slight of
  frame, there was a suggestion of strength and force behind him that robbed
  his words of any shade of egotism.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to stay here a day or two, if I might," he said, "then I will go
  on to Gulch City."</p>

  <p>As things turned out, however, it was the best part of a week before the
  little man with the white face and the burning eyes quitted the friendly
  shelter of the doctor's house. The story of the attack, and the death of
  Stanley and his companion, had travelled far over the snow-clad hills and
  valleys. Mrs. Winter's exploit had come as something of a sensation in that
  lonely province. People had flocked from far and near to attend the funeral
  of Stanley and his companion; the wild-cat papers in the district had lost no
  time in making a heroine of Kate Winter. She bore her honours as meekly as
  she could&mdash;she was longing for the time when the truth could be told.
  Wild and lawless men had come down from the hills&mdash;though they were
  clean-handed men, for the most part&mdash;and they had told with bated breath
  of the vengeance which Captain Rufus was going to take later on. Still, the
  sluggish blood of the countryside was stirred now, and there were rumours of
  reprisals. If Rufus was disturbed by these, he showed no sign of it. Up in
  Gulch City he reigned supreme, surrounded by a horde of flatterers, insolent
  and intolerant in the face of an executive that was practically powerless.
  But there were one or two observant sympathisers who brought insinuations
  that Rufus had been a little more moody of late, and that, to all practical
  purposes, he stood alone. From the day of Stanley's death the third man had
  not been seen.</p>

  <p>It was one cold and bitter night, a fortnight later, that the little man
  with the white face crept quietly into Jake Tomlin's saloon and took his seat
  by the stove. He was so situated that he had his back to an angle of the
  wall, and it was impossible for anybody to approach from behind. The big room
  was packed with gamblers and drinkers; in the centre of the floor an
  engrossing game of poker was in progress. The big man with the coarse, red
  hair and long, fiery beard, the little man recognised at a glance. He needed
  no one to tell him that this was the quarry he was in search of. In all the
  region of wild farce, it seemed impossible to conceive anything more
  ridiculous than a duel to the death between these two men.</p>

  <p>It was only for a few moments that the stranger passed unnoticed. His mild
  air and manner was bound to attract attention. But the chaff, rude as it was,
  had a good-natured flavour about it, and the little man sat there smilingly
  indifferent. A burst of raucous laughter a little louder than the rest
  attracted the attention of Rufus. He had been drinking heavily; he was in a
  winning vein, as the pile of greasy dollar notes by his side testified. He
  raised his great red head and glanced in the little man's direction.</p>

  <p>"Where does the child come from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The sycophants laughed loudly&mdash;the saloon rocked with their mirth.
  The little man's lips grew a little harder, but the smile was still on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I came here with a message," he drawled.</p>

  <p>"Well, expectorate it," Rufus said.</p>

  <p>"That's very polite of you," the little man went on. "As a matter of fact,
  my message is for you, sir. I had it directly from the lips of David Hames
  himself."</p>

  <p>Rufus's red face took on a purple tinge. At the mention of that dreaded
  name, the saloon was stricken into absolute silence. The men loafing there
  could see the veins standing out on Rufus's forehead, they could see his
  beard bristling and crackling like the hair on a cat's back when it is
  stroked in the dark.</p>

  <p>"Does Hames want to see me?" he demanded hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"He is here for that very purpose," the little man said. "He will be along
  presently. I ask your pardon for interfering in your game in this rude way.
  Will you please continue until Mr. Hames arrives?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he would like to come and take a hand," Rufus sneered. "I'll play
  him for his life. It's a big place, is this American continent of ours, but
  there's no room on it for David Hames and myself. You'll see some fun
  presently, boys. You're going to have the time of your lives. I've been just
  praying for a chance like this. It's real polite on Dave's part to come here,
  and save me the trouble of going to his funeral."</p>

  <p>Rufus looked round for the customary flattering laughter. But no sound
  came, nothing but an uneasy breathing and shuffling amongst the greasy mass
  of humanity there. The dreaded name of David Hames had made a deep
  impression, and not the most drunken of the loafers there but who could have
  told, had he only dared, which of the twain he held in highest reverence.
  That Hames should have dared to come there, to have sent a polite message in
  this fashion, was a staggering proof of his marvellous courage.</p>

  <p>For, according to all the rules of the game, Hames's hands were clean,
  whilst those of Rufus were not. The red man was a fugitive from justice, more
  than one man's blood was on his head, and it would have been accounted no
  discreditable thing had Hames covered his man from the door-way and shot him
  before the latter could get his hand to his hip pocket.</p>

  <p>Rufus burst into a storm of uneasy curses. He was irritated to find that
  he could not meet the glance of the little, white-faced man opposite. He was
  furious, too, to feel that his gallery were deserting him.</p>

  <p>"Any of you ever seen Hames?" he growled.</p>

  <p>Nobody responded. Evidently no member of that fragrant company had ever
  set eyes on the redoubtable Hames. Rufus reached out his hand for the cards
  and began a fresh deal.</p>

  <p>"Let's try and forget it for a minute or two," he growled. "And if Mr.
  Hames comes along, tell him to wait till I've finished."</p>

  <p>The game proceeded in absolute silence. For the next quarter of an hour
  Rufus was winning steadily. Then a voice cut the silence&mdash;a voice sharp
  and commanding, so that Rufus raised his head and glared in the direction
  from whence the sound came.</p>

  <p>"Anybody speaking to me?" he challenged.</p>

  <p>"I am," the little man snapped. "Put up your left hand, quick!"</p>

  <p>The whole bar rocked with excitement, for every man there thrilled as if
  that clear, ringing voice had been a blow. The little man had changed almost
  beyond recognition. His face appeared as if carved out of marble, his mouth
  and chin were as rigid as fine steel, his dark eyes were full of fire, his
  whole being bristled with nervous vitality.</p>

  <p>"Did&mdash;did you speak to me?" Rufus stammered.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hand," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Rufus was gazing into the hollow rim of a Colt, which he knew by instinct
  was trained upon his heart. Slowly and reluctantly his left hand went up,
  with the hairy back of it turned in the direction of the breathless
  spectators.</p>

  <p>"Drop it on the table," the little man commanded.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to drop, curse you!" Rufus screamed.</p>

  <p>A tiny spurt of flame flicked from the mouth of the Colt, and, as if by
  magic, a thread of blood trickled down the back of Rufus's hand. As his arm
  collapsed, something fluttered from his nerveless fingers and lay upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"Pick it up," the little man snapped.</p>

  <p>One of the crowd stooped eagerly and raised the greasy square of
  pasteboard.</p>

  <p>"It's the ace of hearts," he cried, "and there's a bullet-hole right
  through the middle of it! Gee whiz, but that was a bit of dandy shooting! Did
  your father teach you to draw a bead like that, little man?"</p>

  <p>"Guess he's a pupil of David Hames!" another cried. "Say, sonny, when's
  David going to happen along?"</p>

  <p>"I am David Hames, curse you all!" the little man snarled. "Now, Rufus,
  stand up, you dog!"</p>

  <p>But Rufus made no motion towards getting up. He sat there red and sullen,
  with something suggestive of tears in his eyes. He nursed his injured hand.
  He was quivering from head to foot with pain and anguish, and a certain
  feeling he could not place, but which, had he but known it, was shame.</p>

  <p>"Get up, you cur!" Hames cried. "None of your shuffling excuses for me.
  You have your right arm still. Now, then, you cheat, you palmer of cards, the
  day has come for our reckoning. How much longer do you suppose you would be
  allowed to delude these poor fools here? How long has he been cheating you
  all like this?"</p>

  <p>A dissipated wreck from the bar spoke up.</p>

  <p>"Rufus always wins," he said. "I never did think he was of much account
  myself."</p>

  <p>Hames laughed contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to take that lying down, Rufus?" he asked. "Have you not
  got pluck enough to resent an insult from a drunken wreck like that? Why,
  there's not a child in the camp who wouldn't slap his face for him! Now,
  then, get out your shooting-iron, and we will fight across the table. I've
  been looking forward with pleasure for many a long day to this meeting. I
  might have shot you as I came in to-night, but that is not my way. There are
  white men and clean men in Gulch City&mdash;indeed, I can see plenty of them
  round me now&mdash;and when I realise that fact, I marvel that you have not
  been lying in your grave for many a year. But I'm wasting your time and mine.
  Your gun, Rufus!"</p>

  <p>Captain Rufus dropped his head upon his hands and burst into a flood of
  tears. A laugh cut the silence, then the whole saloon swayed with ribald,
  mocking mirth. Hames held up his hand for silence. He pointed to the figure
  huddled over the table.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to leave him to you presently," he said; "you will know how to
  deal with that cowardly skunk there. And there is not one of you who would
  not have rejoiced to see his back long ago. I'm going to tell you something.
  I was asked to come to these parts to take a hand in wiping out Rufus and his
  gang. I gladly came, because it was a pleasure to me to do so. The first man
  I came in contact with was Carney. He happened to recognise me,
  and&mdash;well, you know what became of him. Then there was Stanley and two
  other rowdy blackguards whose names I don't know. They happened to catch me
  unawares, and for an hour or two my life wasn't worth a dime. You see, they
  had found out that I saw Carney die, and they wanted to know who killed him.
  I couldn't very well tell them that, could I, boys? It was a close call, and
  if it had not been for the bravery of a woman, Rufus would still be here
  swaggering and bullying and cheating you out of your money as usual. I want
  to tell you, boys, that it was Mrs. Winter who saved me. And she is anxious
  for me to tell you that it was I who shot Stanley and his companion, and not
  she. If you were not an indolent, careless lot, you would have rid yourself
  of this cowardly, murderous bully long ago. At any rate, you ought to know
  what to do with him. You are acquainted with the quaint and interesting
  ceremony which usually takes place in a community like this when a
  distinguished citizen is invited to travel. So far as I am concerned, I make
  you a present of Rufus."</p>

  <p>"Ain't you going to kill him?" a voice drawled.</p>

  <p>"Kill him!" Hames sneered. "Do you think I'd soil my hands with carrion
  like that? Whatever the faults of the other members of the gang might have
  been, they were men. That poor creature snivelling on the table there is
  nothing but a craven coward. Oh, there are plenty of his sort about in the
  mining camps&mdash;the West is infested with them."</p>

  <p>Hames turned upon his heel and, with a curt nod of his head, made for the
  door. He had finished with these people, and he wanted no more of them. After
  all, the expedition had been disappointing. He had hoped for an adventure
  more full-flavoured than this.</p>

  <p>"Say, mister," a voice drawled, "ain't you goin' to wait for the ceremony?
  We won't keep you long."</p>

  <p>"I think I will," Hames said sweetly. "I love the smell of tar, and burnt
  feathers are most invigorating. Eh, Rufus?"</p><br>

     name="story4">4.&mdash;AUTUMN MANOEUVRES</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY G.L. STAMPA</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXXVI, Sep 1912, pp
  397-402</h3><br>

  <p class="first">There was a sound of revelry by night, and"&mdash;and
  Marlshire's chivalry had gathered at Hilsdon Place for much the same purpose
  as Belgium's chivalry had come together on a more historic occasion. In other
  words. Sir Geoffrey Hilsdon was giving a dance, and a good many of the
  officers of the Blue, or attacking, force were present. The country round had
  been chosen as a mimic battleground, and a great engagement might be expected
  at any moment. Therefore Madge Hilsdon had seized the opportunity of
  emulating her Grace of Richmond on the eve of Waterloo.</p>

  <p>The dance was in full swing now, and the guests were visibly enjoying
  themselves. The fine old rooms were looking their best, the famous
  conservatories had been ransacked, and the floral decorations were in their
  way a triumph. It wanted an hour to supper-time, a waltz had just finished,
  and Madge Hilsdon was enjoying the luxury of a whole five minutes to herself.
  It was a warm evening in September, clear and fine overhead, and most of the
  windows had been left open for the sake of the grateful breeze. Madge slid
  across the refectory, where the dancing was in progress, and strolled into
  the cloister beyond. Here was a grand old quadrangle with a fountain in the
  centre&mdash;a veritable haven of rest in the languid summer days.</p>

  <p>It was blissfully quiet there, and Madge was in the mood to go a little
  further. As she turned to the right, a figure emerged suddenly out of the
  shadows and grasped her by the arm. She had a fleeting glance of a
  dilapidated nomad clad in greasy cords, a dim outline of a mahogany-coloured
  face surrounded by a mass of ragged black beard and whisker. Before Madge
  could cry out, a hand was clapped to her lips, and she was lifted from her
  feet as though she had been no more than a feather.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a noise!" the assailant whispered. "If you are quiet, you will
  be perfectly safe in my hands."</p>

  <p>The hand was taken from Madge's lips, and she was set gently on her feet
  again. She was too indignant to be frightened, too absolutely enraged to be
  conscious of any other emotion.</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how dare you?" she panted.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a bit thick, wasn't it?" the miscreant remarked. "If you had
  only seen yourself standing in the cloister, looking like a ravishing angel
  in pink chiffon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jim," Madge cried&mdash;"I mean Mr. Sutton, this is a distinct outrage!
  You have dared to presume upon our&mdash;our&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Engagement," Lieutenant Jim Sutton said coolly. "You might just as well
  say it. Oh, Madge, if you only knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll not hear another word," Miss Hilsdon said icily. "I am returning to
  the house at once. And if my brother Tom imagines that your sister Connie is
  any less determined than I am, he will find himself bitterly mistaken."</p>

  <p>"I can explain," Sutton said eagerly.</p>

  <p>"There can be no explanation, Lieutenant Sutton. Gentlemen don't break
  appointments with ladies, and take chorus girls on the river instead. And,
  besides, gentlemen would not be hanging about a house at this time of night
  in a&mdash;a beastly disguise like yours. We were under the impression that
  you were both with your regiment. I suppose this is some mad escapade on
  Tom's part."</p>

  <p>"He was always worse than me," Sutton said magnanimously. "Look here,
  Madge, I can put that river business right in a minute, if you will only
  listen. You see, poor old Billy Lushington got engaged to one of them, and he
  was in a pretty considerable funk about it, so Tom and myself
  thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Madge stamped her little satin-shod foot impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I decline to discuss it," she said. "What are you doing here like a
  tramp? You might be some vulgar poacher."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am!" Sutton said cheerfully. "As they say in the melodramas, my
  lips are sealed. Now, you might do me a little favour, Madge. It may be the
  last that I ever ask at your hands. With all my faults, I am not lost to all
  sense of feeling."</p>

  <p>Madge's blue eyes softened ever so slightly.</p>

  <p>"You don't deserve it," she murmured, "but if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Sutton said encouragingly. "Now, does Captain Algy Traske
  happen to be shaking the light fantastic toe with you to-night? If so, I
  would have speech with him."</p>

  <p>Madge repressed an impulse to laugh. Not that she felt in the least
  mirthful. This man was incorrigible. It seemed impossible to believe that she
  had ever loved him, that she had suffered his caresses. And that day in
  Dovedale, under the shade of the trees, with the stream at their
  feet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I must get back to the house," she said coldly. "I will speak to Captain
  Traske, and tell him you are here, though why you should have assumed this
  loathsome disguise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pearl of the Andes, you will do nothing of the kind," Sutton said
  hurriedly. "By the love you once bore me, I implore you to be discreet. The
  fate of a nation may hang upon your silence. Tell Traske nothing. So long as
  you get him outside, I shall be satisfied. The mere fact that he is my hated
  rival does not mean that his life is in danger. Not so much as a hair of his
  precious eye-glass shall be injured. Is it a bet?"</p>

  <p>"I detest the man," Madge whispered.</p>

  <p>Sutton held out his hands to her. She turned and fled. She stood just
  inside the ballroom, panting and quivering from head to foot. There was a
  beautiful tinge of wild rose in her cheeks, her eyes gleamed like the
  reflection of stars in a forest pool. She posed there, such a vision of
  dainty beauty, that for two whole minutes Captain Algernon Traske was
  actually thinking about something besides himself. He came across the room,
  prim and immaculate, not one line or hair a fraction of an inch out of place.
  He always reminded Madge of a starched doll. Some inanity in the way of a
  compliment was on his lips.</p>

  <p>"This is our dance, I think," he said. "I ought not to be here at all,
  don't you know. I've got pressing business on for the general commanding at
  Farnborough, but, when I received your invitation, I really couldn't refuse.
  Must be off in an hour, all the same. A sort of Adam turned out of
  Paradise&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>"Then come and get it over," Madge said unkindly.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lieutenant Jim Sutton had made his way through the shrubbery in
  the direction of the big wood, where a gipsy caravan was standing. Here was
  no pampered home of peripatetic luxury, but the genuine thing as seen where
  the children of Bohemia mostly do congregate. The caravan was exactly as it
  had been taken over from its previous owners, save that it had been cleansed
  and sweetened, and the bedding freshly obtained from Tottenham Court Road.
  Inside the caravan a second swarthy ruffian was lounging, with a clay pipe
  between a set of beautifully even white teeth.</p>

  <p>"What ho, my noble redskin!" he said, as Sutton entered. "How progresses
  the campaign? You have been so confoundedly long that I began to think that
  you had fallen into the hands of the treacherous foe. The point is, have you
  done any good?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think," Sutton laughed. "I've seen Madge, my boy. Regularly
  abducted her, Tom. She was pretty haughty, and all that, but on the whole
  charming. Would not hear a word about Billy Lushington, all the same."</p>

  <p>"Oh, confound Billy Lushington!" Captain Tom Hilsdon said impatiently.
  "We'll put that matter right when we've got time. Did you say anything about
  Traske?"</p>

  <p>Sutton's eyes glowed, but that might have been due to the reflection of
  the match as he lighted his pipe.</p>

  <p>"She hates him, my boy," he said rapturously.</p>

  <p>"Now, what have I done," Hilsdon asked piously, "to be tied up in an
  important mission with an idiot like this?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right, old chap&mdash;don't be ratty! You'd feel just the same as
  I do if you had a rival hanging about my sister Connie. You can take it easy,
  knowing that you can go in and win when Connie simmers down, as she's sure to
  before long. So far as Traske is concerned, I regard him as a danger."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;a sister of mine marry that?" Hilsdon cried. "But go on. Did
  you do any good at all?"</p>

  <p>"I did. You've only got to wait, and the immaculate Traske is our very
  own. Heaven only knows what Madge took me for!"</p>

  <p>"Does she know I'm in it, too?"</p>

  <p>"Of course she guessed it. Was there ever a gorgeous spree going that we
  weren't both in? I believe Madge is under the firm impression that this is a
  poaching affray. Now, come along and let's hide somewhere near the house till
  the time for action arrives."</p>

  <p>Hilsdon carefully closed the door of the caravan, and a moment or two
  later the adventurers were hidden in the shrubbery, from whence they could
  command a view of the cloisters. Presently there emerged the slim, dandy form
  of Captain Traske, accompanied by a radiance in pink chiffon. Traske was
  bending over his companion, who seemed to turn away from him with shy
  bashfulness.</p>

  <p>"What are your teeth chattering for?" Hilsdon asked.</p>

  <p>"They ain't chattering," Sutton said curtly. "I'm gritting 'em. By Jove,
  Madge has gone back and left that last rose of summer all blooming alone! He
  evidently thinks she's going to return. Now, then, it's a case of 'Up,
  Guards, and at 'em!'"</p>

  <p>A pair of arms were wound kindly but firmly round Traske's shoulders, and
  a gag was thrust in his mouth. Without a word being uttered, he was carried
  to the caravan and there deposited on the floor. He protested loudly, but his
  threats apparently had no effect upon the miscreants who had dared to inflict
  this indignity upon him. That he had not the slightest notion of their
  identity did not in the least detract from the humour of the situation.</p>

  <p>"He's beginning to sit up and take notice," Hilsdon grinned. "Traske, my
  son, you are the victim of a woman's perfidy. You are not the first brave
  soldier who, for the sake of a pair of blue eyes, has&mdash;well, made an ass
  of himself, so to speak. Product of an effete civilisation, do you realise
  that you have fallen into the hands of the foe?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, speak in a language the child can understand!" Sutton said. "Algy,
  dear old son, we want that from you which is dearer than your life, even
  dearer than your eye-glass. Will you kindly cough up those dispatches which
  you are taking to the general at Farnborough."</p>

  <p>"A joke, isn't it&mdash;what?" Traske asked feebly.</p>

  <p>"On the part of your general&mdash;yes," Sutton grinned. "To pick you out
  the bearer of dispatches was a stroke of absolute genius. That prince of
  detectives, Lupin himself, would never have dreamt that you could have been
  chosen as the bearer of important messages. But you talk, dear boy, and our
  spies in your camp conveyed the news to us. Did you but know it, we are here
  officially with the full connivance of our illustrious chief. Like Autolycus,
  we are snappers-up of unconsidered trifles. In this guise we are going
  through your lines, gathering honey on the way. For the next day or two, at
  any rate, you are our prisoner. No clean collars, my boy, no purple and fine
  linen, not even a bath unless you like to take it in a brook. Will you kindly
  oblige with those dispatches?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I haven't got them on me," Traske stammered.</p>

  <p>"Always obstinate, even as a child," Sutton said sadly, "and greedy, too.
  I am very much afraid that we shall have to resort to one of the fine old
  Eton methods of extracting information."</p>

  <p>"I swear I haven't got them," Traske protested. "I only came to the dance
  for an hour. I arrived at Hilsdon Place in my uniform, and Sir Geoffrey was
  good enough to let me change there. The dispatches are written in cipher, and
  are concealed in the lining of a cigarette case. If you will let me
  go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not once," Hilsdon said firmly. "Tell me which bedroom you are occupying,
  and that will be good enough for me. No, you need not go into details. Seeing
  that I was born in the house, I shall be able to find the room easily
  enough."</p>

  <p>Very reluctantly Traske gave the desired information. He protested loudly
  against the indignation of fetters on his feet and being tied up so carefully
  that it was barely possible to smoke a cigarette in comfort. The two
  adventurers left him there, and made their way back to the cloisters.</p>

  <p>"We shall be sure to see Madge presently," Hilsdon said. "She can't help
  being curious as to what is going on. And it's any money that she tells
  Connie."</p>

  <p>Hilsdon's prophecy was fulfilled to the letter, for a few minutes later
  two slim, graceful figures flitted like butterflies along the cloisters.</p>

  <p>"Well, you girls," Hilsdon accosted them cheerfully, "and what mischief
  might you be up to?"</p>

  <p>"We're not punting on the Thames," Connie Sutton said severely, "and we're
  not poachers, either."</p>

  <p>"Now, that's very unkind," Hilsdon said plaintively. "This is all the
  thanks we get when we tear ourselves away from the society of these cruel
  girls in the hour of our country's need. We are not poachers&mdash;we are
  officers in disguise. If we are arrested, we shall be shot as spies. To make
  the matter plain, we are after some dispatches which Traske is conveying to
  the officer in command at Farnborough. We are supposed to be gipsies, and if
  you've got five minutes to spare, we will show you the jolliest little
  caravan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Keep to the point," Sutton said sternly.</p>

  <p>"The fact is, we've got Traske a prisoner, and he has confessed to
  possessing the dispatches, which are in his cigarette case in his bedroom. If
  one of you girls will only nip along and get it."</p>

  <p>"I'd love to see that caravan," Connie said rapturously.</p>

  <p>"Darling, you shall," Hilsdon said with equal fervour. "If Madge will cut
  in and get that cigarette case, you shall come down there now. We can easily
  put Traske to bed for an hour or two in the bracken. But we must have those
  papers first. Now, Madge, do be a sportsman for once."</p>

  <p>Madge laughed, a spirit of mischief dancing in her eyes. She turned and
  disappeared like a shadow down the cloisters, only to return five minutes
  later with something dainty in the way of a cigarette case in her hand.</p>

  <p>"There!" she said breathlessly. "But I thought you two people were alone
  in this business?"</p>

  <p>"So we are," Sutton explained. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, only because there are two other men in the house dressed very much
  as you are. They had the audacity to make their way into the corridor
  upstairs. I caught a glimpse of one of them turning into one of the rooms. It
  seems to me, Tom, that your intelligence department has taken the precaution
  of having two strings to its bow. I suppose anything is justifiable in
  war-time, but I thought it rather cool on the part of those men to enter the
  house and go upstairs. I suppose they are aware of the fact that every
  servant in the house is fully occupied with what is going on on the ground
  floor."</p>

  <p>Hilsdon looked at Sutton and whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"You may bet they were," he said drily. "Now, you girls, get back in the
  house, or you will be missed."</p>

  <p>"What about the caravan?" Madge protested.</p>

  <p>"Come back here in half an hour," Hilsdon went on. "Now, go back, or you
  will spoil everything. Ah, that's better! This is going to be a great night,
  old man. You tumble, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I tumble," Sutton said briefly. "But what's the next move? It will never
  do for us to disclose our identity, especially considering the fact that the
  house is fairly bulging with Johnnies attached to the battalions of the foe.
  And if, on the other hand, we do nothing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, come along!" Hilsdon said impatiently. "I know exactly how those
  chaps got in, and, therefore, it stands to reason that I know how they will
  come out. They must have been pretty sure of their ground for both of them to
  enter the house. We will go round to the side entrance. Ah, this is just as I
  thought!"</p>

  <p>Hilsdon stooped and called Sutton's attention to a strand of wire running
  between two pegs on the grass. The entanglements were carefully skirted, and
  the spies came presently to a side entrance over which was a balcony facing a
  large casement window. By the side of the porch a short ladder was
  standing.</p>

  <p>"Up you go," Hilsdon whispered. "We'll wait for our friends here. I don't
  suppose they will be very much longer. You stand on one side of the window,
  and I'll stand on the other; and when the first artist comes out on your
  side, drop him without the slightest hesitation. They won't have much plate
  on them, because most of that will be in use downstairs. But I've no doubt
  these chaps have laid their hands upon a tidy amount of jewellery, seeing
  what a crowd of women there are staying in the house."</p>

  <p>They were quite ready, not to say eager, for the fray, but the waiting was
  weary work, and they were both getting a little jumpy when a long shadow
  crossed the window. There was a pause for a moment, and then a burly figure
  emerged as silent and noiseless as a shadow. His pockets appeared to be
  bulging, a small sack was slung over his shoulder. He gave a grunt of relief
  as he turned his face to the open. A second later a smashing blow on the jaw
  laid him out puffing and blowing on the balcony. The second man, hearing the
  fall, doubled on his tracks and raced along the corridor. But physical
  culture is not an art in high favour with the predatory class, and a neat
  trip brought him headlong to the ground. He found himself dragged along
  backwards until the balcony was reached, and the window closed carefully
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"How are you getting on, Jim?" Hilsdon panted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm sitting on his head," Sutton responded cheerfully. "Most
  obstinate beggar he is. I had to jolt him considerably before he consented to
  part with his revolver. It's any odds your bird's got one, too. You'd better
  argue the matter with him."</p>

  <p>Hilsdon promptly turned his man over and rubbed his face on the cold,
  unsympathetic lead casing of the balcony.</p>

    <img src="1301021h-images/AutumnManoeuvres.jpg"
         title="Hilsdon promptly turned his man over.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Hand it over," he said between his teeth. "If you don't, I'll spoil those
  pretty features for you."</p>

  <p>The burglar wriggled an unsteady hand behind him and contrived to extract
  an ugly-looking Colt from his hip-pocket.</p>

  <p>"So far, so good," Hilsdon said. "You go down the ladder first, Jim, and
  these chaps will follow you. I'll bring up the rear, and we'll take them as
  far as the caravan. We can search them quietly there. Now, drop that cursing,
  my man. If you only knew it, you are two of the luckiest rascals in
  England."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid they are," Sutton muttered mournfully. "We are bound to let
  the brutes go when we've done with them. We can't appear in the matter
  without disclosing our identity. Now, then, squad, by the left, march!"</p>

  <p>The caravan was somewhat crowded a little later. Traske viewed the
  new-comers through his eyeglass with a kind of mild, resigned astonishment.
  His own abject misery and utter melancholy won a smile even from the
  burglars.</p>

  <p>"D'yer mean to say, guv'nor," one of them asked, "as wot' e's another of
  us? D'yer know 'im, George?"</p>

  <p>George shook his head gloomily. He was engaged in the horribly uncongenial
  task of emptying his pockets. With a heartfelt sigh, George's companion in
  misfortune was doing the same. It was a fine, glittering heap of stuff that
  presently littered the caravan floor. Sir Geoffrey's male guests had not been
  selfishly forgotten, for the heap contained watches and pins and sovereign
  purses, to say nothing of a little heap of cigarette cases. As one of these,
  a platinum and gold affair set in diamonds, was produced, a queer sort of a
  cry broke from Traske's lips. It was only for a moment, then he became wooden
  again, but, all the same, his passing agitation had not escaped Sutton's
  notice. He laughed drily.</p>

  <p>"So that's the lot," Hilsdon said. "And now you two artists can go as soon
  as you like."</p>

  <p>A fine perspiration bespangled George's brow.</p>

  <p>"You're joking, guv'nor," he said hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I'm not," Hilsdon went on. "Make the most of your luck when you
  get the opportunity. There's the door, unless you prefer the more congenial
  exit of the window."</p>

  <p>The space recently occupied by George and his companion resolved itself
  into thin air. Sutton bent over the glittering heap of gems, and picked up
  the resplendent cigarette case.</p>

  <p>"Those chaps have done us a fine service," he said.</p>

  <p>"In what way?" Hilsdon asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, don't you see, Mad&mdash;I mean your messenger&mdash;brought you the
  wrong cigarette case. Dear old Algy here is just the sort of Johnny to carry
  two. And didn't you notice how he cried out when George produced that
  Solomon-in-all-his-glory box? George and Co. are evidently much better
  finders of valuables than we are. Now, come, Algy, aren't I right? If you
  don't agree, we can easily cut the cigarette box open."</p>

  <p>"Don't do that!" Traske groaned. "I hate to see beautiful things spoilt.
  I'd much rather show you how to open the case."</p>

  <p>"Good boy!" Hilsdon said approvingly. "What an ingenious arrangement! And
  now, Algy, we are going to look after your health a bit. It is absolutely
  necessary that you should have a little fresh air before going to sleep, so
  we are going to deposit you outside for half an hour on a comfortable bed of
  bracken. At the end of three days we shan't want you any more, and then we
  can return you to headquarters as an empty."</p>

  <p>Traske made no protest&mdash;he recognised the futility of it. A little
  while later, and there were two other figures in the caravan. They were
  slender, beautiful ethereal figures in frothy lace and diaphanous
  draperies&mdash;they had pink in their cheeks and a tender gleam in their
  blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"And that's the story," Hilsdon concluded lamely.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it was wonderful, wonderful!" Connie exclaimed. "You are the two
  cleverest boys in the world!"</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you didn't leave me out," Sutton said.</p>

  <p>"Just as if anybody could!" Madge cried indignantly. "Oh, I should like to
  have seen Captain Traske's face when you brought him here! I suppose you
  couldn't fetch him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that would be downright cruel," Sutton said. "But then girls are
  cruel&mdash;no sense of justice at all. You've only got to go out of your way
  to help another man, and they are sure to think that you are doing their sex
  an injustice. Now, take&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Madge impulsively threw her arms about his neck.</p>

  <p>"Will you ever forgive me?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Connie," Hilsdon whispered, "don't you think we're in the way here? Shall
  I see you back to the house?"</p>

  <p>"I think you had better, dear," Connie said demurely.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">5.&mdash;THE LEFT HAND</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Rodney And Otamatea Times</i>, New Zealand, 18 Sep
  1912, Page 6</h3><br>

  <p class="first">RODNELL strode across the room and looked out into the
  garden. Those strong hands of his were clenched, and his teeth were closely
  set together. He was a man of strength in more ways than one&mdash;the kind
  of man who knows how to suffer in silence. As his gaze wandered over the
  garden, the brooding shadow in his eyes deepened. Seven hard, honest years
  lay there; he had found the place a wilderness, he had turned it into the
  semblance of a smiling paradise. A bad nervous breakdown had caused him to
  sever his connection with the Press and start in a small way as a gardener
  with a capital of a hundred pounds and what experience he had picked up from
  casual observation.</p>

  <p>Well, at any rate, he had managed to live. It had been a hard struggle,
  but the open air life had made another man of him, and he had decided to go
  on with the fight. There had been times when it was necessary to borrow
  money, but the garden had grown and grown, the shining rows of glasshouses
  had expanded, the returns were better every year. Yet, despite this fact,
  Dick Rodnell owed James Cartright four hundred pounds and the knowledge
  troubled him.</p>

  <p>Cartright's reputation was a sinister one, and many were the tales told of
  him in Little Mersham. He called himself a lawyer, but practically no
  business passed through his hands, and the fortune he had scraped together
  had come to him in the form of usury pure and simple.</p>

  <p>He had been pressing Rodnell of late. He had found out by some means that
  the latter expected to do great things with a new carnation that he had
  discovered. Before long the Rodnell carnations would be the talk of the
  horticultural world. Already one of the greatest nurserymen in England had
  offered Rodnell a thousand pounds for a half interest in one of the new
  plants, and the settlement of this deal was only a matter of time. But the
  big florist was in South America, and nothing could be done till his
  return.</p>

  <p>Rodnell bitterly regretted that he had ever mentioned this to Cartright.
  He had done so more with the intention of gaining time than anything else.
  Unless some unforeseen event occurred he would be a comparatively wealthy man
  in a year's time. Cartright had shared this optimistic opinion, and on the
  strength of it had advanced a further sum of fifty pounds. Just as a matter
  of form, the precious pots of carnations were added to the security.</p>

  <p>And now Cartright had shown his hand. He had had losses, and needed his
  money at once. One legal process after another followed in startling
  rapidity. He had done it all himself in his furtive and secretive way, and
  probably was the only man who knew that Rodnell had had a bankruptcy notice
  served on him.</p>

  <p>Rodnell was not blind; he knew exactly what this meant. Cartright was
  after those carnations, and unless some miracle happened they would be his in
  a week's time. It was no use appealing to any of the other great florists,
  seeing that the carnations had finished blooming, and the great man in that
  line was the only member of his firm who knew anything about them. Rodnell
  cursed himself for his folly none the less heartily because he had been
  conscious of it from the first.</p>

  <p>Why should be be robbed of all he had in this way? Cartright was just as
  much a thief as if he had picked his pocket. And nobody knew anything of j
  the story beyond the two men concerned. All the papers and documents were in
  Cartright's safe in the library of his house. Rodnell knew the house and its
  garden quite well. Cartright's niece Jessie, who lived with him, was a great
  gardener, and Rodnell had spent many happy hours helping her. She was a
  flower herself, and Rodnell often wondered how it was that she could flourish
  in that uncongenial soil.</p>

  <p>As he stood there staring moodily at his own garden he could picture
  Jessie Cartright working in hers. He had promised to go down this evening and
  give her some assistance with the chrysanthemums, but he shrank from it now.
  He did not feel like facing James Cartright just then. Up to that moment he
  had had no quarrel with the money-lending attorney, whose manner was just the
  same as it always had been. Business was business, he said, and there was no
  reason to make a personal matter of it.</p>

  <p>Rodnell could see everything quite clearly. He knew the interior of
  Cartright's house perfectly. He could have found his way about tEe garden
  blindfolded!. He could picture Cartright sitting up late as usual working at
  his accounts long after everybody else had gone to bed. He knew that this was
  Cartright's custom. Hardly anybody in Little Mersham was up after ten
  o'clock. Cartright would be working away there, with his papers littered all
  over the big table, the safe door open. Suppose he were to surprise
  Cartright, to gag and bind him, and take his securities and make off with
  them! He would pay his just debts after the matter of the sale of the
  carnations was effected&mdash;he had no wish to be a thief. It would be only
  his word against Cartright's, and people would prefer to believe him. All he
  needed was time to save himself from the clutches of this miserly rascal.</p>

  <p>For half an hour Rodnell stood there brooding over this idea. He was a
  desperate man in a desperate mood. And these carnations were as the apple of
  hiw eye. His whole life's work was in them&mdash;they would give him an
  established reputation amongst gardeners. He had other discoveries that he
  would work out as soon as he had the money and the peace of mind necessary
  for their development.</p>

  <p>He put on his hat presently, and went down the village street in the
  direction of Cartright's house. It was a warm evening in early September, and
  the gardens were still gay with flowers. Out at the back of the old-fashioned
  house Jessie Cartright was working. Her eyes brightened, and a color rose to
  her cheeks as she saw Rodnell coming.</p>

  <p>"I began to imagine that you were not coming," he said. "I was conceited
  enough to go on with these cuttings in your absence, Mr. Rodnell. Now, have I
  mixed enough sand with this mould?"</p>

  <p>Rodnell sifted the soil through his fingers thoughtfully. He held it up to
  the light between his fingers. Across the palm was a rough white seam, a
  little hard and ragged at the edges. "Yes, I should think that your
  proportions are quite correct," he said "What are you looking at?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I was looking at your hand," Jessie confessed. "How did you manage
  to do it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is an old story," Rodnell said, lightly. "I did that five years
  ago. I was hacking away at a rose briar with a pruning knife, and the blade
  slipped and gashed my left hand. It was rather a nasty business at the time,
  but it is all right now, as you can see. I should add just a shade more of
  that peat if I were you. And push the cuttings down more
  firmly&mdash;so."</p>

  <p>Jessie Cartright watched him admiringly. She made a pretty picture as she
  stood there, her face shaded by her big garden hat. Perhaps Rodnell's eyes
  told her this, for the color crept into her cheeks. She did not fail to
  notice that Rodnell was a little more quiet than usual. In her quick,
  observant way she saw most things. She had a more than vague idea as to the
  way in which Cartright made his money&mdash;she had not been living with him
  two years for nothing.</p>

  <p>"You are very quiet to-night," she said at length.</p>

  <p>Rodnell aroused himself from his reverie with a start. "Am I?" he said.
  "Well, we all have our little worries at times."</p>

  <p>"I hope you have not been disappointed over those carnations of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly that," Rodnell admitted. "They are all right. If I can
  only manage to hold on for a month or two longer, Waterton's people&mdash;Mr.
  Waterton himself But you don't understand these things. I mean it's a
  question of money."</p>

  <p>Had Rodnell glanced at his companion just then be would have seen that she
  understood a good deal more than he gave her credit for. They had often
  discussed the great things likely to result from the sale of the new
  carnations, but as to their being pledged to Cartright nothing had been
  said.</p>

  <p>"It must hare been hard work at the start," Jessie said.</p>

  <p>"It was," Rodnell said, grimly. "I had only about a hundred pounds, and I
  was further handicapped by poor health and utter lack of experience. I had to
  pay pretty dearly for my experience; and yet I fancy I enjoyed the struggle.
  It was something to fight for, you see. I don't mind confessing to you that I
  should have had to abandon it altogether if it had not been for those
  carnations. And to lose them just when fortune is in my grasp is hard. I
  daresay</p>

  <p>"Dick&mdash;Mr. Rodnell," Jessie whispered. "If it so bad as that? Won't
  you tell me?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were full of sympathy; the little red mouth quivered. In the
  impulse of the moment she laid her hand on Rodnell's arm. He took the fingers
  in his and kissed them; then in some vague way he found himself kissing the
  quivering red lips as well.</p>

  <p>"I ought not to have done that," he said; "but I was so lonely, I had
  nobody to confide in. And when you looked on me as if&mdash;as if&mdash;well,
  as it you cared</p>

  <p>"Of course I care," Jessie whispered. "Haven't you known that for a long
  time, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"But I am a pauper," Dick groaned. "What right has a pauper to love a girl
  like you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, tell me all about it," Jessie asked, impressively. "What have you
  been doing with the carnations&mdash;my carnations now? Please to tell me the
  story at once."</p>

  <p>In a tame and halting way Rodnell complied. The carnations were in pawn to
  a man who had made up Ms mind to possess them. Dick mentioned no names. He
  had a certain delicacy in disclosing the fact that t"he Shylock in question
  was Jessie's own flesh and blood; and, strangely enough, she did not seem to
  be in the least curious on the point. Her face was hot with indignation, but
  all the same she seemed anxious to avoid Rodnell's glance.</p>

  <p>"A man like that deserves any treatment!" she exclaimed. "You are
  justified in doing anything to thwart his plans. And you can pay him before
  long. If I were a man I should not hesitate for a moment. We must discuss
  this again, Dick; we must talk it over, and find some way to overcome the
  enemy. I must go now and look after my uncle's supper. Good-night."</p>

  <p>She lifted up her face to he kissed in the most natural manner, and
  vanished. As a rule she asked Dick inside but she seemed averse to doing so
  this evening. He walked across the lawn to a gate that led into a lane, now
  quite dark and deserted. The oLd woman who "did" for him did not sleep in the
  house. She usually put out his supper and cleared it away in the morning. She
  had the key of the back door, and came and went as she pleased. Nobody would
  be able to prove that Rodnell was not in his cottage all the evening.</p>

  <p>The more he thought the matter over the easier it looked. It was as if the
  Fates had gone out of their way to make the path easy for him. He was
  convinced now that he was justified in taking the step that he was going
  take, and Jessie had shared this opinion. If he only took his courage in both
  hands now he could be free. In a few months' time he would have ample means.
  He would take that dear little girl to share his cottage with him&mdash;the
  dream of his life" would be realised. He would do it; he would hesitate no
  longer.</p>

  <p>He lay there in a dry ditch on the far side of a hedge till the clock
  struck eleven. By this time the whole of the village was fast asleep. There
  was not a light to be seen anywhere, save the one that gleamed dully from the
  window of Cartright's study. It was an easy matter to find his way across the
  lawn to the house.</p>

  <p>There was a ragged edge to the blind, and Rodnell could see into the
  study. An oil lamp was on the table, and behind it sat Cartright busy at his
  books. Rodnell could see that the safe door was open.</p>

  <p>Rodnell was breathing a little more quickly now, but there was no
  hesitation in his mind. He was going to get those papers. He knew that it
  would be no difficult matter to gain access to the house. Fortunately for him
  he was wearing tennis shoes, so that his footsteps made no sound. Ho crept
  round to the back, and tried the scullery window. With his thin-bladed
  grafting-knife he pushed back the latch. A moment later and he was creeping
  along the passage leading to the hall.</p>

  <p>So far, so good. The house was absolutely silent. In his rubber soles Dick
  made his way to the study. The door was wide open, and as he looked in he
  could see the safe hospitably open. Half in front of it was a big screen
  fashioned out of the colored plates of bygone Christmas numbers. It might be
  just possible to reach the shelter of the screen without being observed. Once
  this was done the contents of the safe would be clear to any average pair of
  eyes. It was a risk, and a big risk, for once he was discovered Dick was
  lost. Still, Cartright's back was to him, and the miser was deeply engrossed
  in his papers. On all fours Dick commenced to enter the room.</p>

  <p>He hardly dared to breathe now; the sweat was pouring down his hot face.
  He wriggled along like a dog until he stood in the shelter of the screen,
  gazing into the safe eagerly. There were rows and rows of papers, neatly
  docketed and arranged on shelves. Rodnell was amazed to read the names on
  some of them. Evidently Cartright had most of his neighbours under his thumb.
  His heart beat a little faster as he recognised his own name on one of the
  packets.</p>

  <p>So far everything had been in his favor. He had only to snatch the packet,
  drop it into his pocket, and retreat by the way he had come. At any moment
  Cartright might rise from his chair and come over to the safe for something'
  or other. And if that happened&mdash;well, Dick did not care to think of
  it.</p>

  <p>He grabbed the packet and thrust it into his pocket. As he did so a grunt
  came from the table. Cartright dragged himself heavily from his chair and
  rose to his feet. Rodnell watched him breathlessly through one of the folds
  of the screen. There was nothing for it now but to resort to heroic measures.
  If Cartright came as far as the safe Dick would stun him by a blow on the
  side of the head before his precious host could discover the identity of his
  visitor. This was the way that some men went headlong on to murder, Dick
  thought. He was living his life over again in those few seconds. Cartright
  came along muttering and coughing. He came nearer and nearer to the
  screen.</p>

  <p>With clenched teeth and heart beating like a drum, Dick waited. Then there
  was a cry and an oath and a snarl, and the lamp went out with a crash,
  leaving the room in total darkness. Dick's fists unclenched, and he rubbed
  his eyes in amazement. Was it possible that he had had anything to do with
  this? Had there been one brief moment of madness when he had attacked
  Cartright openly&mdash;a terrible struggle, in which the lamp had been
  extinguished? It did not seem to him that he had moved; he could feel the
  sharp edge of the screen when his forehead had bumped against it.</p>

  <p>And the din was still going on. Dick could hear yells and screams and the
  rustle of struggling bodies, than a loud cry for help, and a body crashing
  down the flight of stone steps that led from the passage to the door leading
  to the back garden. Somebody groaned again, and all was still.</p>

  <p>A dog barked somewhere in the house, the bells began to ring, and Dick
  could hear footsteps outside Then somebody seemed to stand by him and fumble
  for his hand. A small hand grasped his and pulled him in the direction of the
  door. He was too dazed and stunned to ask any questions; he could only obey
  meohanically. Before he could realise what had happened he was outside the
  front door, which was quietly closed behind him raced down the little drive,
  and fled mechanically along the road, it seemed to him that he had gained his
  house without a soul being any the wiser.</p>

  <p>He lighted his lamp and stood gazing at it, regardless of his supper.</p>

  <p>"Now, what does it all mean?" he thought. "Am I a coward that I turned my
  back upon trouble in that way. And what would Jessie say it if she knew? Did
  I kill Cartright, or shall I wake presently and find that it has all been a
  hideous dream ?"</p>

  <p>He locked the papers carefully away in his own little safe and wont to
  bed. He would hear all about the trouble in the morning. After breakfast ho
  found the village to be full of it. Somebody had broken into the house of Mr.
  Cartright the night before and had attacked him at hit work. A lot of books
  and papers seemed to be missing, but whether or not any valuables had been
  taken it was impossible to say, as Mr. Cartright was still unconscious. He
  was not dead, or anywhere near it, and probably he would be himself again in
  a week. He had had a nasty blow on the head with a jemmy, which had been
  found at the bottom of the stairs. The miscreant had got clean off, but h e
  had been 'badly torn by the Bedlington terrier that Cartright always turned
  loose after the house was closed. Dick blessed the fact that ho and the
  Bedlington were good friends.</p>

  <p>It seemed a plausible story, but it puzzled him. He was still half under
  the impression that he was the author of the mischief. He would have to go up
  to the house, of course, and inquire after Cartright. It was late in the
  afternoon when he summoned up the necessary courage to call and ask for
  Jessie. She came down to the long, oak-panelled drawing-room a little pale
  and. tired-looking, but otherwise quite herself. Just for a moment he
  hesitated to kiss her.</p>

  <p>"What is all this I hear?" he asked. "Have you found anything out,"</p>

  <p>"I don't think we ever shall" said Jessie. "The man must have been
  concealed in the study. One of the side-tables has a long cloth over reaching
  to the ground. The French window in "the study was open till long after it
  was dark; in fact, I closed it myself. The man was there waiting his chance.
  Possibly some movement on his part betrayed him, and there was a struggle. We
  shall know all about it when my uncle gets better."</p>

  <p>"It must have frightened you terribly," Dick muttered.</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent, yes. I had not gone to bed. I was writing in my room
  at the back of the house. I went downstairs first and made my way to the
  library. I&mdash;I was suspicious about something. I may confess at once that
  I was not thinking of my uncle for the moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Now, there is somebody else in your mind, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Dick. I was thinking of a story I heard earlier in the evening. It
  was a story of a man who had pledged all that he held dear to another man who
  was trying to rob him of it. And it occurred to me that my uncle was a man
  like that. And it also occurred to me that I had suggested a way in which
  that one man could get back that which he had been robbed of. The burglar had
  gone when I got to the foot of the stairs&mdash;gone by the back door, with
  the dog after him. I&mdash;I was thinking of the other man. And I found him,
  Dick&mdash;l found him and showed him how to escape. I took him by the hand,
  and when I felt his hand&mdash;there was a scar upon it I knew &mdash;I knew
  Jessie paused as if unable to proceed. Dick caught his breath as he looked at
  her. He could see that her eyes were full of tears, that her face was flushed
  and smiling. He caught her in his arms and kissed her passionately. It seemed
  to him that there was no further need for explanation. "I expect that man
  felt an awful coward," he said. "He was a coward to leave you here all
  alone."</p>

  <p>Not at all, Dick. He did exactly what I wanted him to do. I was quite
  safe. And that man was justified in what he did. When you fight a rascal you
  fight him with his own weapons. And if the man I mean was in love with a girl
  like&mdash;me, for instance&mdash;he is all the more justified because he is
  taking steps to get me out of a hateful place like this. Do you believe in
  the truth of what are called dramatic coincidences, Dick I do, and we had one
  of them last night. And, Dick&mdash;whisper&mdash;did you get the
  papers?"</p>

  <p>Dick smiled down into the flushed, happy face. "I did, darling," he said.
  "I got them before the row began. I was hiding behind the screen. If you had
  only seen me sneak into the study and hide myself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I did," Jessie said, dreamily. "I was looking over the stairs. We are a
  wicked couple, Dick, and I&mdash;well, I love you all the better for it. So
  there!"</p><br>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY A.J. GOUGH</h3>

  689-694</h3><br>

  <p class="first">DESPITE the bitter blight of it, a little knot of curious
  passengers stepped out into the corridor to see what was the matter. The
  biting cold struck them like a blow, a flurry of snow lashed and stung.
  Overhead the clouds were hurrying onwards, the white battalions came
  streaming down the gale, the pine trees rocked and swayed before the force of
  it. The autocratic guard, master of the train as absolutely as a captain on
  board his own ship, waved the eager questions on one side.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing the matter at all," he said, "and if you want something
  in the way of a snow-up, I guess I can't give it you. Fact is, the driver saw
  a man lying on the track, and he sorter pulled up. We've taken him on board
  now, and a doctor is setting his leg. And that's all!"</p>

  <p>The passengers were glad enough to get back to the warmth and comfort of
  the train, and Pete Morran himself was beginning to conclude that there was
  something in life, after all. He lay there on a heap of cushions, his teeth
  set and clenched, and a grey pallor under his tan, as the doctor worked away
  at his injured limb.</p>

  <p>"Calculate I'm all right now," he said presently, "but it was just a
  chance. My horse died under me, and I slipped in crossing one of these
  trestle bridges, and bust that darned old limb. Much as I could do to get on
  the track, with the off-chance of holding up your express. But it came off
  all right, and it looks as if luck was turning the glad eye on me. Happen
  that Mrs. Bruce Evershed is on the train, and I guess the glad eye is fairly
  winking at me."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll go and see," the doctor said good-naturedly. "Yes, you can have
  a pipe, if you like, but no whisky."</p>

  <p>Pete accepted the situation with philosophy. He seemed particularly
  anxious to see Mrs. Bruce Evershed without delay.</p>

  <p>"I guess she's on the train," he said. "I had a letter from my little girl
  to say that she and the missis were travelling West to-day on the
  North-Eastern Express, and my intention was to board the car at Overton. Then
  I got this bust, and I had to take all the chances that were lying
  around."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bruce Evershed, small and dainty and alluring, and a perfect picture
  of graceful beauty, looked up from her snug nest of furs as the doctor
  addressed her. She seemed to be the last word in luxury and extravagance. It
  would have been hard to picture her in any other attitude besides that of the
  ballroom and the theatre. Yet with it all there was just a suggestion of
  power in her eyes and the firm lines of her mouth. Her beauty was slightly
  marred by her petulant expression, which had in it some hint of pathos and
  unhappiness. She suggested a woman who was trying to get away from herself, a
  woman bored and satiated with the sweets of life, and hungry for a more
  healthy atmosphere.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I hardly like to trouble you," the doctor apologised, "but there's
  a man in one of the brake vans who is asking for you. He was lying on the
  track when we pulled up and took him on board. He has sustained a nasty
  fracture of the right leg. I think his name is Pete Morran."</p>

  <p>The bored, discontented look was wiped from Mrs. Evershed's face as if a
  sponge had been passed over it. Her brown eyes grew alert and eager. She
  threw aside her costly furs and prepared to follow.</p>

  <p>"This is very startling," she said. "The man you speak of is my maid's
  father. What is he doing here? But perhaps I had better go and see."</p>

  <p>Pete greeted the dainty figure, with the brown eyes and sunny hair, with a
  broad smile of the friendliest description. Mrs. Evershed held out a hand to
  him that looked like one of the snowflakes on the window as it lay in his
  brown fist.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to see you, Pete," she said. Her voice trembled suspiciously as
  she spoke. "You are like a link with the past. But tell me, is there anything
  wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Guess we will come to that presently," Pete said. "If you are under the
  impression that I'm out looking for you&mdash;well, you've guessed it first
  time, because I am."</p>

  <p>"Did&mdash;did he send for me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't go so far as to say that. But he wants you, and cruel bad,
  too. You see, I heard from my little girl that you were on your way to
  England on this train, and I concluded to chip in at Overton. Then I threw up
  against this little trouble, and had to call a fresh deal. You see, at
  Overton I expected not only to meet you, but to get help."</p>

  <p>"Help? Pete, you frighten me! Don't tell me that there is anything wrong
  with Bruce. If he died&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I guess it isn't so bad as that," Pete said cheerfully. "But he's in
  danger. You see, him and me we were mining up the Sierras&mdash;same old spot
  where you and him had that honeymoon of yours two years ago."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Evershed sighed gently. She had good reason to remember her solitary
  six months in a mining camp. It all rose vividly to her eyes now. Put her on
  the right track, and she could have found her way to the camp blindfold.</p>

  <p>"Oh, do go on!" she said impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, there was him and me alone together, and we'd struck it real rich.
  We buried the stuff in the floor of the tent until we was fairly rocked
  asleep on a gold mine. And some of those galoots down Red Creek way found it
  out, and there were we all alone, on the chance of being murdered in our
  beds. But, after all, there were two of us, and we were armed, and there
  never was any real grit in that lot. They didn't come out in the open and
  fight; they just waited for their chance, like a set of cowardly vultures.
  Then your old man he gets down with an attack of malaria, and I tell you I
  was hard put to it, what with the cooking and the watching, and one thing and
  another. And old Bruce he says to me: 'Pete, lad, you've got to go out and
  get some reinforcements. You're pretty tough, but you can't stand the strain
  much longer.' And I figured it all out&mdash;I figured it as I could get up
  the reserves in about thirty hours. And we laid a little trap for 'em. We
  made it look as if we'd cleared out altogether. I fed Bruce up and kinder
  buried him under half a ton of hay in the corner of the tent, and let the
  snow drift in so that the place looked fair deserted. There wasn't any smoke,
  and there didn't appear to be any food, and I guess I played it up on those
  chaps properly. Then again perhaps I didn't. They might have smelt the trick,
  and they might at this moment be giving your old man&mdash;But I don't like
  to think of that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, this is dreadful!" Mrs. Evershed cried. "You ought to have been back
  there by this time. What am I to do? The idea of my husband lying there at
  the mercy of those ruffians drives me mad, and you are useless for the
  present. Tell me what I can do. I would go myself now&mdash;I'd ride every
  inch of the way alone&mdash;if I thought that I could save him."</p>

  <p>"I believe you would," Pete said admiringly. "Now, it's no use worrying
  anybody here. I guess there's nobody on the train who's made of the right
  stuff for our purpose. There's no help for it, Mrs. Bruce. But here am I like
  a darned great log, more in the way than anything else. Now, you get off the
  train at Overton and tell this little yarn to the station hands. It's only
  twenty miles up the valley from here, and a good horse will get you through
  before dark."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Evershed set her little teeth together.</p>

  <p>"I'll go," she said. "I'll find Elsie, and change my clothing at once.
  Everything necessary is in my baggage. But you must stay on the train and
  wait for us at the other end. When I start for England, I shall take my
  husband with me."</p>

  <p>"Bully for you!" Pete cried. "That's the best I've heard for many a day,
  not but what I shall miss him, for a better pard no man could ever wish for.
  But you've come first, and you always did. And he just aches for you as much
  as ever. And if you haven't greatly changed yourself&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shall never change, Pete," Mrs. Evershed said simply.</p>

  <p>"Then you go to him, and this darned old broken leg of mine will be a
  blessing in disguise. I'm a plain man and not much of a scholar, but when you
  live all alone like I do, you learn to think. And he treated you in the right
  way. And I bet a dollar that you'd be the first to admit it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Evershed held out her hand without a reply. There was something like
  a frown upon her forehead, and in her eyes a blend of laughter and tears. All
  the listlessness and languor had left her now; indeed, it might have been a
  different woman who stepped out on to the howling platform dressed for a
  perilous journey through the snow. She had been through all this kind of
  thing before, and her heart was full of courage despite the cold and the
  stinging lash of the gale in her face. Just for a moment she was conscious of
  a sense of desolation as the express disappeared in the white, whirling
  mists.</p>

  <p>There was cold comfort here, too. There had been trouble somewhere down
  the line, and one solitary express man remained in the station. He looked at
  Grace Evershed with a certain rugged pity in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mean to say you're going alone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If I have to," Grace said between her teeth.</p>

  <p>"Well, I calculate it will have to be just that way. So far as I know, I'm
  the only thing that walks on two legs within ten miles of this location. I'd
  come if I could, but that means the wreck of a train or two. I can find you a
  horse and a saddle and a bridle. You can have a couple of guns, too, but I
  guess they won't be much use to you."</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess they would," Mrs. Evershed snapped. "I calculate that I'm
  pretty useful with a revolver."</p>

  <p>She set out presently, armed for the fray. She was beginning to realise
  the peril and danger that lay before her. And yet only an hour or two ago she
  had lain snug and warm in her furs, with no drear prospect like this before
  her. As she rode along, with the white flurry raging around her, her mind was
  busy with the past. She remembered the time when she had first met Bruce; she
  recalled to mind his peculiar views on the subject of women and their duty to
  the world. Until she and Bruce had first come together, she had lived a
  frivolous, selfish life&mdash;the only child of a doting father, who had left
  her more money than was good for any single girl to possess.</p>

  <p>She had never meant to marry Evershed, though she admired his courage and
  his manliness and that strong, resolute face of his. She was never going to
  call any man master. And then, somehow, it came about that she did marry him,
  and from that moment the trouble began. Not that he ever upbraided
  her&mdash;there were no 'scenes' in the vulgar sense of the word&mdash;but
  his brow grew darker, and he became more silent as the days went on, until
  the project for a long trip to the Sierras came up. Grace was jaded and tired
  with the brilliant social whirl, and she clutched eagerly at the notion. She
  would have started out with a retinue of servants and all the pampered luxury
  of her clan, but Evershed had put his foot on that. She found herself
  roughing it as a daughter of the soil would have done. She found herself
  rising at dawn, washing and cooking and doing all the menial work of the
  household. She found herself clad entirely in homespuns, cut off, as it
  seemed, ten thousand miles from civilisation, with a taskmaster of a husband
  who worked her like a slave. She had not as yet learnt to face the solitude
  of the woods. She had all the town-bred girl's horror of the wild solitude
  and Nature unconfined. She would have turned her back upon it had she dared.
  But Evershed had refused to accompany her; he refused to turn his face
  towards civilisation, and if she wanted to go back to the other butterflies,
  she must find her way there unaided.</p>

  <p>It was a somewhat grim and cruel plot which Evershed had evolved as a
  means of working out his wife's salvation. He made no disguise of what he had
  done; there was no pretence about it whatever. And, if Grace did not like it,
  she could go. There were days and weeks together when husband and wife hardly
  spoke, and when Pete Morran was like a godsend to both of them. And despite
  her wild rebellion against Fate, Grace Evershed was gradually falling under
  the fascination of snow and pine and glorious air, and all that goes to the
  making of a perfect country. She had lost all her lassitude and boredom.
  There was elasticity in her limbs, and joy in the knowledge of her strength.
  And there came a time when she could hunt and shoot and fish with the best of
  them&mdash;a time when she could have saddled her own pony and ridden off
  home by way of Overton without a qualm. But if Evershed had his pride, so
  also had she found her own. She had promised to come for a year, and she
  would see it out to the bitter end. Her husband should never brand her as a
  coward. And gradually, too, she began to see that Evershed was right. There
  came a time when she could no longer disguise from herself that she owed a
  debt of gratitude to Bruce for teaching her how to live. And there came a
  time, too, when she was glad, not perhaps that she had married him, but glad
  that he belonged to her, and that no other woman in the world could possess
  him.</p>

  <p>But, all the same, at the end of the year she rode away without a word of
  farewell or even the intimation that she was going. Her year was over and the
  lesson was finished. Probably she would never look upon Bruce Evershed again.
  She tried to persuade herself that it did not in the least matter. But that
  attitude had been abandoned long ago. She stood face to face with herself and
  argued the matter out calmly. She loved Evershed, and she knew now that she
  had given him her heart from the first. She had good health and good looks
  and unlimited means, but she would have cheerfully bartered these to feel
  Evershed's arms about her and his lips on hers. If she could only find a way,
  if she could only provide herself with some bright and shining weapon
  wherewith to break down the barriers of pride, the day was won. And Pete had
  been quite right&mdash;she loved Bruce, and Bruce loved her, and the rest of
  the world mattered nothing.</p>

  <p>And lo and behold, here was the weapon in her hand! Every step of the way
  was taking her nearer and nearer to her happiness. But would she be in time?
  That was the question which was racking her. Even under the mantle of snow
  she could recognise the outline of familiar landmarks. She drew a long, deep
  breath as the little camp came in sight.</p>

  <p>Pete had told her to expect nothing but solitude and desolation. But here
  were fresh footprints in the snow; a thin wreath of smoke whirled and drifted
  in the tempest&mdash;there was a fire in the tent, beyond a doubt. In the
  pines behind the tent Grace could see three horses tethered. Assuredly the
  vultures were getting closer. Had they been bold enough to attack their prey?
  she wondered. A ribald laugh came to her ears down the gale. She dismounted
  and tethered her own horse, then crept round to the back of the tent and
  unhobbled the other three. The half-broken ponies broke into a gallop and
  disappeared behind the white, whirling curtain of snow.</p>

  <p>There were three men in the tent, no doubt, for Grace could hear them
  talking eagerly. She gave a little gasp of thankfulness as she recognised the
  voice of her husband. It seemed a little weak and tired, but there was no
  note of surrender in it.</p>

  <p>"I tell you no," Evershed was saying. "You can kill me if you like, but
  you'll benefit nothing by that. You'd never get from me where the stuff might
  be hidden. Besides, you don't know for a fact that it is hidden. Do you
  suppose that Pete went away and left me here without taking something along
  with him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all very well," one of the other men exclaimed, "but you don't
  kid us with a story like that. Now, see here, Mister Evershed. We've got you
  properly whacked. Pete may come back to-morrow, and, on the other hand, he
  mayn't come back at all. If this storm makes good, it'll be days before the
  trail's open again. And you've got no food, and you ain't likely to get any
  unless it comes from us. We don't want to let you starve, but, seeing as
  you've got the rocks, you must pay for the tucker."</p>

  <p>"And pay handsomely, too," the second man growled.</p>

  <p>"You're a fine, soft-hearted lot," a third voice broke in. "What's the
  good of throwing away chances like this? Our game is to get the stuff and
  clear out before the storm begins in earnest. If he won't speak, perish me if
  I wouldn't make him. Take him up and roast him. Tie him up before the fire
  till his clothes scorch on his back. He'll open his mouth wide enough then,
  I'll promise you. Anybody'd think you were a lot of women!"</p>

  <p>The other men growled ominously. It was plain enough that their comrade's
  suggestion was finding a certain amount of favour in their eyes.</p>

  <p>"D'you hear that, Mister Evershed?" the leader asked. "D'you tumble to
  what Jim was saying? Because I'm game if Red Head here likes to join up.
  Here, Jim, go out and get some more firewood. There's a pile of dry stuff
  outside."</p>

  <p>"You'll get nothing out of me, you cowardly blackguards!" Evershed cried.
  "Torture me if you like, but you shall never make me speak. And if you
  think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Evershed broke off abruptly, for the two men were upon him, and he wanted
  all his strength for the struggle. Weak and spent as he was, he made a fair
  fight of it, but he was bound at length and dragged to the centre of the
  tent. It seemed to Grace listening outside that she had come just in the nick
  of time. There was no fear in her heart, no wild prayer for assistance
  escaped her lips; she was not even conscious of the cold which was piercing
  her through and through. But she would have to proceed warily, or her aid and
  the revolver in her hand might prove useless. There was a second revolver in
  her pocket, and she had twelve shots in all. If her hand had not lost its
  cunning, she would know how to use them. It was long odds, too, that these
  ruffians were not armed. They had come down in this cowardly fashion, feeling
  sure that Evershed was too weak and ill to put up any sort of a fight. By
  this time their weapons were, no doubt, far down the valley in the holsters
  of the stampeded horses.</p>

  <p>Grace Evershed crept a few yards away, and crouched down behind a mass of
  undergrowth covered in snow. From here she could watch the movements of the
  three desperadoes actually inside the tent. She saw the man who had been
  addressed as Jim come out, presumably with the object of collecting firewood.
  He stood there for a moment clear-cut as a cameo against a bank of snow.
  Grace raised the revolver and fired. She saw the man throw up his hands, she
  heard the yell of execration that rose from his lips as he collapsed in the
  snow. She had not killed him&mdash;she had not the slightest intention of
  doing so. She had aimed carefully just below the thigh, and she knew that she
  had broken the ruffian's leg as surely as if a doctor had told her so.</p>

  <p>"I'm shot! I'm shot!" the ruffian screamed. "Get a move on you, boys, or
  we're done for! Where are the guns?"</p>

  <p>"With the ponies," a hoarse voice came from inside the tent. "What's up
  there? You, Jim, what's wrong?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1301021h-images/Kindergarten.jpg"
         title="Grace fired twice in rapid succession.">
  </div><br>

  <p>But Jim answered never a word. He lay there groaning in the snow,
  absolutely incapable of further mischief. As the other two men rushed to the
  door of the tent, Grace fired twice in rapid succession. But she was not
  firing to kill now; she had thought the whole thing out calmly and
  collectedly. It might be days before relief came to their aid from Overton;
  the snow might lie deep and the trail be wiped out. If she wounded any more
  of these rascals, she would have to tend them, and have them on her hands,
  and, for aught she knew, the tent was none too well provisioned.</p>

  <p>There was no occasion for further strategy. The trio were only too anxious
  to get away out of the zone of the deadly fire. With oaths loud and deep, it
  dawned upon them that the ponies were gone.</p>

  <p>"It's an ambush!" the leader groaned. "It's all over with us, boys. Better
  put up your hands."</p>

  <p>They stood there with hands uplifted, looking dejectedly miserable in the
  falling snow. But no answering voice bade them surrender, no further shots
  broke the silence. The stillness and the uncertainty of it all was perhaps
  more terrible than a volley of shots would have been.</p>

  <p>Gradually their hands dropped, and presently, from her hiding-place, Grace
  could see two of the ruffians moving slowly away, carrying their wounded
  comrade with them. She had no fear that they would return; they would never
  risk the unseen danger again. Her heart was beating fast as she hurried to
  the tent and let down the flap behind her. Evershed lay bound upon the floor,
  his back towards her. She drew her hunting knife from its sheath and cut the
  raw-hide thongs. Evershed scrambled painfully to his feet.</p>

  <p>"That was a close call," he gasped. "Those shots came just in time. I'm
  infinitely obliged to you. Why, it's a woman!"</p>

  <p>"And one you have met before, Bruce."</p>

  <p>"Grace!" he cried. "Now, I wonder what guardian angel sent you here just
  in the nick of time? Do you mean to say you came&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice trailed away to a whisper. He was ill and weak, but the smile on
  his face and the look in his eyes was enough for Grace. He was glad, frankly
  and undisguisedly glad, to see her. On the impulse of the moment he stretched
  out his hands, and she snatched at them before he had time to withdraw
  them.</p>

  <p>"Speak to me like that," she said. "Look at me as you are looking now, and
  I shall have courage to proceed. I don't want my pride to get the best of me
  now. Because Pete was right, Bruce. He said that you loved me and I loved
  you, and that we ought never to have parted. Because it's all beautifully
  true. I tried to make myself believe that it wasn't, but I was deceiving
  myself all the time. It has all turned out like some delightful romance. Pete
  broke his leg, and he managed to stop the train that I was on. Then he told
  me everything. He told me the danger you were in here, and, because there was
  no one to help me, I came alone. And in my heart of hearts I was glad that I
  was alone. And I feel proud of what I have done. It is the best way I can
  find of showing you how sorry I am. And I'm not going to ask you to forgive
  me, because you love me still, and it is not necessary."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall wake up presently!" Evershed cried. "It's like some beautiful
  dream that comes to one during an illness. And do you really mean to say that
  you've come back here to stay?"</p>

  <p>She reached her arms about his neck and laid her cheek lovingly against
  his.</p>

  <p>"I've been longing for the chance ever since we parted," she confessed.
  "I'm quite cured, Bruce. I want nothing better than to be a good wife. That
  will be happiness enough for me. And now let me make you comfortable. Let me
  cook your food and make your coffee as I used to. Are there plenty of
  provisions? Splendid! So that we shall be quite right till help comes. And,
  do you know, I feel as if I was just beginning life to-day?"</p><br>

     name="story7">7.&mdash;THE VITAL SPOT</a></h2>

  <h3>ILLUSTRATED BY SEPTIMUS E. SCOTT</h3>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol. XXXVII, Jan 1913, pp
  306-312</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE pines bent and tossed&mdash;a broken square before the
  cruel onrush of the white battalions&mdash; the black boughs nodded and
  danced like plumes on a hearse, and down below, sagging behind the spent
  huskies, was&mdash;the coffin. At least, that was what Joe Pardon called it
  in his mind. To the crude, unimaginative eye it was a sledge. Still, a sledge
  can easily be a coffin when your provisions are all gone and your dogs are
  foundered, and you're off the map in bitter Ascaraland, with three feet of
  snow on the Divide and more to follow. It might be all very well to argue
  that you were only six leagues north of Fort Wolverine, which is by way of
  touching the skirts of civilisation, but the snow was as a white Atlantic
  lashed to fury, and&mdash;well, the coffin simile held good, and Joe and his
  partner, Happy Jack Hunston, knew it.</p>

  <p>But for this bad luck, it would have been all right. They had not been
  blind to the risk, either, but they had to take it, as they had annexed the
  dogs and the sledge and the whole fit-out without the formality of asking the
  owner's permission. Wildcat Peter had wanted them badly up on the Lone Tree
  Bluffs, and Peter was notoriously impatient. Moreover, there was money in it,
  and they had none.</p>

  <p>Thus! And now the snow was on them, and the game was up. It was horribly,
  bitterly cold&mdash;forty below zero despite the dampness of the
  snow&mdash;and bleak night was beginning to scowl over the edge of the pines.
  The big dog with the missing fang and one ear dropped and panted. He showed
  his yellow teeth in a snarl, and a throat hard and sanguine and black as
  death as Joe raised his whip. And Joe laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>The snow stung him like the thong in his mittened hand, the howl of the
  gale and the scream of the tossing pines roared in his ears like the thunder
  of some white, tortured Niagara. The other dogs had dropped as their leader
  had done; their fangs gleamed behind tongues that quivered and pulsated like
  strips uf red elastic.</p>

  <p>"Well, they've done their bit," Joe muttered. "No use, old par'ner."</p>

  <p>"No more use'n side-pockets to a toad," Hunston supplemented.</p>

  <p>The end had come, and both of them knew it. In that stark programme there
  was the sporting chance of Death figuring as an extra turn. They might linger
  on for a day or two, but, if the grey, grim promise of the gale held good, it
  was merely a prolongation of the agony. There was only one world just
  then&mdash;a white one swept bare of food and fire, and they two were alone
  on the solar system.</p>

  <p>"Sop me up with a bit of blotting-paper," Hunston said. "Wipe me out with
  a handful of waste. Noble redskin, we've torn it."</p>

  <p>"Rock me to sleep, mother. Massa's in the cold, cold grave this time.
  Here, unhitch them dogs&mdash;we're a happy family now,"</p>

  <p>All this without the semblance of a smile or the semblance of a fear. It
  was all in the game. Hunston cast off the dogs, and he and Pardon backed the
  sledge under a bank at the foot of a belt of pines. There were tools of sorts
  on the sledge&mdash;a pick or two and a couple of spades. It was good to be
  doing something in the way of action. The snow was piled high to windward;
  down there, in the deep trench, the keen edge of the wind was dulled, the
  white sharpshooters seemed to sting and burn and harry. A dead, dry pine gave
  all the wood the adventurers needed. A great fire blazed clear and dry. The
  dogs gathered round, the warmth from their steaming bodies was
  grateful&mdash; and unsavoury. They lay muzzle to the ground, their eyes
  alert and gleaming in amber flames as Happy Jack busied himself getting the
  evening meal. A haze hung over the cache, and mist sweated from dog and
  human.</p>

  <p>It was hot and glowing waist-high there in the snowy pit, and freezing
  cold from the hips downwards. The gale screamed high overhead, handfuls of
  snow, like drift from a wind-lashed breaker, hissed and sizzled in the
  fire.</p>

  <p>"They know all about it," Pardon growled. "Look at old Bully Bob! Mean to
  say he can't smell as we're in a tight place? And we don't want them forming
  a syndicate to corner the grub. We've got to bury them eatables&mdash;make a
  tunnel in the snow and bury 'em. Ain't goin' to be eaten by our own dogs,
  Jack."</p>

  <p>"All the same, in the long run," Hunston said indifferently.</p>

  <p>He tossed a fish each to the dogs. There was no fighting and snarling for
  them&mdash;each huskie took his own sedately. They knew. Pardon cursed them
  with a certain irritable affection as he filled the kettle with snow. He
  baked dampers, and made coffee, and fried the cast-iron bacon. There was just
  sufficient food left for thirty hours. Tobacco in plenty, but there was no
  jubilation in the knowledge. They were not unduly depressed, either. The fire
  glowed and crackled in amber and crocus-blue flames, the light rose and fell
  upon the stern faces of the two men. They were brown, hairy faces, with
  steadfast eyes and obstinate jaws. There was no money between them, and food
  for perhaps five more meals. Hunston sat with his face in his hands, sucking
  fiercely at his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Jack, I've been thinking," Pardon said suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Always gives me a headache," Hunston responded. "Never could do anything
  except with my hands. An' what's the good?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dunno! I feels like that occasionally. I did a goodish bit of
  thinking when I quit the Old Country eight years ago, and turned the farm
  over to Mary. She was happy enough, but <i>I</i> couldn't settle down to it.
  Something in my blood, I suppose. Used to do a bit of poachin' to save taking
  to drink. Couldn't even stop when the kid was born. Wish I had now."</p>

  <p>"Same here," Hunston said quite biographically, "only mine was market
  gardening. Fightin' bankruptcy all the time, with my heart in my mouth. Used
  to make me sweat and tremble&mdash;me as don't know what physical fear is.
  That's why I came out here to make a fortune for me and Lizzie."</p>

  <p>Pardon spat savagely into the red heart of the fire.</p>

  <p>"And you've done it," he cried&mdash;"you and me done it together! Over
  two hundred thousand dollars apiece. We was cheated out of the Simple Anne
  Mine by them cursed lawyers of Jim Clint's&mdash;though we didn't know as
  they were working for Clint at the time&mdash;and we was properly sold over
  those claims at Grey Reef. And all them hard-earned dollars found their way
  back into Clint's pocket, confound him!"</p>

  <p>"What's it all matter now?" Hunston asked philosophically. "You'll never
  see Mary nor the kid, and Lizzie will have to find somebody else. Our
  number's up, Joe! That old vixen, Dame Nature, has caught us short, and we've
  got to pay. 'Bout two days more, and we'll toss for it who does the shootin'
  of the other when the grub's petered out. Only two shots are necessary, old
  pard, and I hope to Heaven as the man behind the gun won't be me!"</p>

  <p>His big, strong voice shook as he spoke, though the twinkle in his
  flint-blue eye was still there. Pardon nodded solemnly. It was maddening to
  think that they were only fifteen miles from life and safety. Why, from the
  bluff behind the camp, they could see the lights of Fort Wolverine!</p>

  <p>"And there he sits and fills his pockets!" Pardon cried with a sudden
  fury. "If he'd played the game by us, we shouldn't be here. We should be snug
  by the fireside in the Old Country, and you'd have your lass and I should
  have mine. Ever been inside Jim Clint's house? No? Well, I have. It's like
  what you read of in them penny novelettes&mdash; wallowin' in luxury. With a
  private telephone wire&mdash;seventy miles of it&mdash;to Weston City, and an
  operator at the far end to connect him with the long-distance lines as far as
  New York, he knows what the world's doing every morning before breakfast.
  That's how he's got the whole of the State in the hollow of his hand. That's
  how he diddled us and scores of honest men besides. A private line
  underground. Cost him a couple of hundred thousand dollars. To think of him
  sitting in that big house "</p>

  <p>"Then don't think of him sitting in that big house." Hunston smiled. "Who
  told you all about the 'phone?"</p>

  <p>"Found it out for myself. I'm up to all that. I learnt all about field
  telephones the year I was in Orange River Colony along of the Imperial Horse.
  I laid miles of it, and sent hundreds of messages. It isn't a bad game, take
  it one way and another. But that's all done with. Here, come and give us a
  hand with the grub before I'm too sleepy to handle it. We've got to make a
  tunnel in the snow, or the dogs will have the lot."</p>

  <p>The ground was soft enough; the picks bit in it, and the shovels cleared
  the loose earth away. Hunston's pick struck something hard a glancing blow,
  and jarred him to the shoulder. He stooped down curiously.</p>

  <p>"Didn't know as there was ironstone in these parts," he said. "Anyway,
  it's metal, all right. Looks like something buried here, Joe. Come and have a
  squint at what I have found."</p>

  <p>Pardon complied indifferently enough. He was working mechanically, his
  eyes half closed. With the aid of a match, he could see in the bottom of the
  pit a shining spark of metal where the glancing pick had taken the rind off
  it. He bared his hand and touched the gleaming wound tenderly. His fingers
  slid around it. Then the sleep was wiped from his eyes as if a sponge had
  been passed over them. He was trembling from head to foot, under the brown
  varnish of tan the skin grey&mdash;ashy grey. For a moment the colour faded
  from his lips.</p>

  <p>"I don't like&mdash;I don't like," he gasped, "to&mdash;to Besides, I
  ain't sure. Dump in the grub and fill up the mouth of the cave again. I ain't
  feeling none too well, pard. So we'll have a look at this yer thing in the
  mornin'. Not as any metal's much use to us. Jack. If it was a barrel of flour
  now, one might drop a grateful tear over it."</p>

  <p>Hunston yawned sleepily. Pardon's agitation had entirely escaped him. He
  was dead tired&mdash;the roar of the gale was like drowsy music in his ears.
  He dropped down by the side of the fire and knocked out his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Good night, old pardy," he droned. "When a man's asleep, he's as good as
  any other man, even if his blessed life isn't worth&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A snore cut the philosophy short. But there was no sleep in Pardon's eyes.
  He was numb with fatigue, soaked through and through with the conflict of the
  day, but his brain was working at fever heat. From an inside pocket he took a
  section map and laid it by the side of the fire. For a long time he studied
  the chart with eager, burning eyes. From the same pocket he fished out a
  stump of pencil, and made laborious calculations on the margin of the map. He
  proved them again and again until he was satisfied that he had made no
  mistake. His pipe had long since gone out, but he sucked at it mechanically.
  He did not hear the roaring of the wind or the hiss of the snow on the fire,
  the whimper of the dogs in their dreams, or the scream of the tossing pine
  branches. He cared nothing for these things, because it seemed to him, in his
  simple wisdom, that he had found a way out.</p>

  <p>He came to himself presently, after an uneasy sleep of an hour or
  two&mdash;came back to grey, dim daylight, with a sky of lead overhead and
  the black pines volleying in the gale. For the moment the snow had ceased, as
  if Nature had spent herself in one furious white orgy, but the menace was in
  the sky still, and there was more to come.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast all ready," Jack said cheerfully. "Didn't want to disturb you.
  Just take that bacon off the fire, pard."</p>

  <p>But never a word spoke Pardon. All through the meal he sat with a certain
  brooding sullenness, his eyes fixed on the fire. Before the provisions were
  hidden away again, he spent ten minutes and half a box of matches in an
  examination of the shining metal disc that Hunston had accidentally
  discovered. His lips muttered something, his eyes grew bright.</p>

  <p>"Just you put the provender away," he said, in the same moody fashion.
  "I'm going to make a bit of an experiment. No, I ain't gone dotty, and I
  ain't goin' to say anything till I know. Give me a pick."</p>

  <p>Hunston handed over the pick wonderingly. He had seen Pardon in this mood
  once or twice before, and generally on the eve of some great discovery.
  Therefore Pardon should have his own way and no questions asked. He would say
  what he had to say all in his own good time.</p>

  <p>Pardon climbed over the ridge with the pick in his hand. The fierce rush
  of the gale brought him up all standing. He stood there repeating a formula
  which he had got by heart. Along the hollow gut the wind had swept the ground
  clear, piling it up in great white walls on either side. From Pardon's point
  of view, a vast amount of trouble was going to be saved. But he was not
  taking any risks on that account. He passed backwards and forwards over the
  narrow valley, tapping the ground with his pick at every stride. With grim
  tenacity and doggedness of purpose, the strange pastime went on for a good
  hour or more. Then the pick rang on something hard and brittle, and Pardon's
  lips parted with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Got it," he muttered&mdash;"got it for a million, sure!"</p>

  <p>He stooped down and proceeded to clear earth and refuse away. There stood
  disclosed presently a square iron grating fitted into a trap of the same
  metal. It looked strangely modern and civilised and out of place in the
  desolate white desert. With the point of his pick Pardon raised the grating
  and peered inside. The grim expression of his face expanded into an
  all-absorbing grin.</p>

  <p>"No mistake about it," he said. "I knew I was right. It's a darned lucky
  thing as the wind skimmed the snow off here so nicely, and it's a darned
  lucky thing as I struck what I wanted within half a mile. Half a mile! As if
  a half mile here isn't equal to half a dozen leagues down below on the
  plains! Question is, can I do it?"</p>

  <p>Hunston lounged over the fire, smoking placidly.</p>

  <p>"Caught any fish with that there rod of yours?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Got the biggest fish this side of the Divide," Pardon explained curtly.
  "He's on the line, and he can't get off. But it's a long line as he's got
  out; I should say as there's quite five miles of it. But he's fixed there and
  he can't get away, and all we need is a landing-net."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ask me an easy one," Hunston said impatiently. "Give it me with the
  bark on."</p>

  <p>"I am," Pardon responded. "The landing-net's at Four Forks, and that's a
  good five miles away. I figured it out on the map when you was asleep last
  night. Worked it all out, I did, till I could hardly see the figures. If we
  can get the landing-net, we've got the fish sure, and he's big enough to keep
  us all our lives, old pard. But the question is, how can we get to Four Forks
  and back? That's the big trouble. It's a hundred to one against getting
  there, and a million to one against getting back. But the million to one shot
  comes off sometimes, or there's no basis for the theory of chances. (That
  ain't my own&mdash;I read it in a book.) At any rate, I'm going to try."</p>

  <p>"You can count me in, of course, pardy."</p>

  <p>"No, I ain't counting you in," Pardon said doggedly. "You've got to stay
  right here and wait. What's the good of two of us going? Besides, if I don't
  come back, you'll have food for another day or two, and Heaven knows what may
  happen in that time&mdash;rescue parties and all manner of games."</p>

  <p>"Where you go, pardy, I go, and that takes it."</p>

  <p>"Then I stay where I am, old son. I tell you it's a chance. But I ain't
  going to talk about it, for fear of disappointment. And I can't see no point
  in the two of us going to Four Forks. Is it a deal?"</p>

  <p>Very reluctantly on Hunston's part it was. What Pardon needed from the
  locality in question he did not say, neither did Hunston press for
  information. If this desperate thing had to be done, then it had to be done
  quickly. Pardon might get there, and, on the other hand, he might have to
  turn back. He might find himself up to his neck in a snowdrift, and
  then&mdash;why, then neither man cared to think of it. There was no occasion
  to dwell upon the danger and the outrageous folly of it. But there was no way
  out but this. It was infinitely better than the certainty of slow
  starvation.</p>

  <p>So Hunston helped to harness the dogs and pack a sufficiency of food for
  them and Pardon to last for a day at least. If Pardon was not back by
  nightfall, then it was inevitable that he would not return at all. It was
  characteristic of those two bosom friends that they did not even shake hands
  at parting. Hunston stood on the edge of the ridge and raised a cheer as the
  dogs pulled westward. They vanished presently behind a belt of pines, for so
  far the track was good. And Pardon knew the way blindfold. The white
  battalions were the foe. If they proved kind, then this mad thing might be
  done.</p>

  <p>With set teeth and bent head, Pardon pushed on doggedly. The snow lay deep
  and thick in places; here and there it had to be skirted, so that each mile
  was more like five. Pardon was grateful now and then for the sun peeping out
  of the racing, reeling cloud-wrack, for it gave him his line when more than
  once he might have wandered away from the track. And the sun had already
  begun to slide down before he reached Broke Hill Point, that only represented
  half the journey. He was fiercely, ravenously hungry now&mdash;so hungry that
  the pain of it forced the tears to his eyes&mdash;but he dared not stop. A
  grey shadow slid along, from time to time, under the cover of the pines, and
  the dogs grew restive. Pardon repressed a shudder. The wolves were stalking
  him&mdash;they were backing their instinct against his adventure.</p>

  <p>It was long after dark before he staggered against the huge boulders of
  rock and precipice that formed the front of Four Forks. The dogs dropped down
  panting and spent, snarling and worrying at one another's quarters. They were
  quite out of hand now. The leader turned his glittering fangs on Pardon as he
  stumbled arud lay exhausted across the sledge. With an effort, he struggled
  to his feet and laid about him with his whip. He was fighting, with the grim
  tenacity of despair, for his life, and he knew it. By a kind of instinct, as
  a man in a dream, he threw food to the dogs. He lay in the snow, face down at
  their feet, lost to the world; but not for long. Here was the door of a hut
  built into the solid cliff&mdash;a door that yielded to a few blows of
  Pardon's pick. There was nothing but stores here, and neat boxes of tools,
  one of which Pardon regarded with sparkling eyes. On the floor, too, there
  was a half-filled jar of whisky. He was a temperate man, was Pardon, but his
  fingers crooked convulsively round the handle of the demijohn as if they had
  been palsied by drink. Here was the stuff he needed, and the occasion that
  Providence made it for. The fiery stuff put fresh life and vigour in his
  veins, a certain recklessness gripped him. He fed the dogs generously on the
  floor of the hut; he grudged them the fish as he tossed it to the snarling
  brutes. His own meal was frugal enough, but the huskies must have their
  fill.</p>

  <p>There was wood in the stove, and soon the fire roared loudly. There was a
  warmth presently that Pardon had not known for days. Outside, the gale howled
  and raged, but no more noisily than the red-hot stove. And Pardon's fresh
  courage spurred him to nervous things. He would lie down and rest for an hour
  or two, and then press back. There would be a moon presently; to get back
  along his own trail would be less difficult. He lay with his back to the
  blaze and slept like a log. He woke with a start and dragged himself to his
  feet. The sooner this thing was begun, the sooner it would be ended. He
  fought his way into the bitter cold; he drove the tired, sullen dogs before
  him. All he had to do now was to pack the whisky and precious case of
  mahogany, and he was ready. He began to realise how spent and weary he was.
  Better have stayed the night in the hut. He woke from a walking dream to find
  the dogs restless and uneasy. He saw the grey shadows skulking in the fringe
  of the woods; under the pines were a score or two of fierce, rolling amber
  eyes. The big flea-bitten wolf in the van of the pack put up his head and
  howled. Pardon was conscious of a curious tightening of the muscles of his
  throat. Then one of the dogs rolled over, done to the world, and the amber
  circle of eyes grew narrower.</p>

  <p>"Sorry, old man," Pardon gritted between his teeth. "This is what them
  philosophy chaps call the survival of the fittest. Greatest good of the
  greatest number, my boy. Still, I'm darned sorry, old dog."</p>

  <p>He cut the spent huskie clear of the traces. The dog whined pitifully, and
  Pardon shut his ears. He did not dare to look back; he tried not to hear the
  snarls and yells, the worry of the teeth in flesh, the last snarling agony.
  He badly wanted to have Jim Clint by the throat at that moment. Still, the
  circle of shifting amber eyes was gone for the moment.</p>

  <p>They would be back again presently, of course, and they were. Pardon could
  see the leaders with the red foam on their jaws. He could not spare another
  dog so long as there was an ounce of pull left in him. Each dog wasted was a
  step nearer to the grave. Better a couple of revolver shots. They were good
  shots and true. Out of nowhere a great mass of fur and fangs and yapping jaws
  came. Pardon glanced back at the howling mass with, grim pleasure, and the
  rest was a dream. The camp was in sight with the dawn. There was one dog left
  of the team, and the sledge was lying on its side. A few yards more, and the
  situation was saved. Yet Pardon could not move another yard. It seemed to him
  that he was fast asleep, bound by thongs to the ground. If he could only
  burst the frozen bonds of speech and make Jack hear! The world was full of
  grateful warmth, something hot and stimulating was trickling down his throat.
  He sat up presently, sniffing hungrily at the hot coffee and bacon that
  Hunston had prepared for him.</p>

  <p>"Had your breakfast, too?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Had it more than an hour ago," Hunston lied cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"You're the biggest liar this side of the Pacific!" Pardon retorted
  courteously. "I'm having your breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Well, what's it matter, pardy? You're back here, anyway, and, as the chap
  said in the story, your need is greater than mine. And you're safe back, old
  man, and that's worth a score of breakfasts. Guess you found what you wanted,
  too, or you wouldn't have annexed that whisky. Anyway, the grub's all gone,
  and it's up to you now to see us through."</p>

  <p>"We'll have all the forage we need before night," Pardon said grimly.
  "Here, hand me over that case and follow me. It isn't far, and there's no
  time to be lost. There's safety <i>and</i> fortune in that little box."</p>

  <p>Hunston followed wonderingly. Outside, in the snow-swept gully. Pardon
  paused and pulled up the square iron trap. He hauled at what looked like an
  indiarubber snake. With a pair of pliers from the mahogany box, he cut the
  rope and proceeded to attach some quaint-looking instrument also from the
  case.</p>

  <p>"What the tarnation snakes is all that?" Hunston demanded. "And how did it
  get there? Didn't know as they'd got gas and water in these parts."</p>

  <p>"You'll understand presently," Pardon muttered. "Hullo! Hullo! Is that 1,
  Fort Wolverine? Good! Oh, yes! We're Wood and Garton, of the Second Section
  Telephone Survey. Out looking for faults. I'm calling from Inspection Box 13,
  on Mr. Clint's private line. Eh? No, the line is all right. It's us chaps who
  are all wrong. We got caught short in the blizzard. Lost all our dogs and
  provisions. Held up near Four Forks. If you'll listen carefully, I'll locate
  our position exactly... Got all that? Good! Bring a coil of wire with you and
  a magneto from Saxeby's, as there's a leak just here, and if it isn't put
  right, old man Clint will find Wall Street a little bit deaf next time he
  calls up. And, say, bring blankets and some brandy for a poor chap here who
  is fair off his rocker. Johnny called Carston. Picked him up half dead, with
  his pockets full of quartz, good forty ounces to the ton stuff. What? That's
  it&mdash;he's found the broken lead of the old Grey Goose Mine. If we can
  save him, there's millions in it. Only don't tell old man Clint, or he'll do
  us for sure. Oh, yes, you'll find our trail. We lit out of Wolverine three
  days ago by Poplar Greek. And we're clean out of food. You ought to get us by
  nightfall easy."</p>

  <p>Hunston stood listening wonderingly. He was slowly getting the hang of it.
  The gash in the snake was repaired presently and the iron cover replaced.
  Back by the fireside. Pardon began to explain.</p>

  <p>"You struck it first," he said. "That metal disc you hit with your pick
  was Glint's private telephone wire. Right here in the forest, with snow piled
  up around us and death staring us in the face, you hit it. And then I knew
  that we were saved&mdash;if I could get to Four Forks, where the Telephone
  Company keep spare stores. I thought it all out as you. lay asleep. And I got
  to Four Forks, and I got the spare battery, and I got back. Sounds like a
  dream, don't it? Here are we starved and hungry and nigh to death, and yet,
  if I like, I can sit down and talk stocks and shares to Wall Street&mdash;can
  hear the clocks striking on Broadway and the wolves howling for our blood at
  the same time. And we're saved, old pard, and the knowledge what I gained in
  South Africa has been our salvation. They'll be here to-night with dogs and
  sledges and food for a regiment."</p>

  <p>"I'll get it all presently," Hunston gasped. "You're a wily bird, Joe.
  Pretty little touch of yours 'bout the chap with his pocket full of rocks.
  Thought that would fetch 'em all the quicker, maybe?"</p>

  <p>Pardon chuckled as he filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"It's deeper than that, as you'll see presently," he grinned. "Didn't I
  say as there was safety and fortune in this for us? And so there will be.
  Wake me when the relief comes. I'd like to sleep till then."</p>

  <p>It was far into the night before the relief came. Pardon sat up and
  pricked his ears. He looked out across the snow to the long sledge, with the
  double team of dogs and the giant of a man who was urging them on.</p>

  <p>He chuckled and bared his teeth in a hard, savage grin.</p>

  <p>"Chuck some wood on the fire," he whispered. "Get a blaze. It's all panned
  out exactly as I had expected. He's come alone!"</p>

  <p>"Who's come alone?"</p>

  <p>"Why, <i>Clint</i>! I knew he would. Probably got another sledge a mile or
  two away, with instructions to await orders. It was the story of the gold
  find that fetched him. You see, it was Clint I was talking to on the
  telephone this morning. I recognised his voice, though he wouldn't, of
  course, remember mine. And he had no suspicions&mdash; how could he? The
  suggestion not to say anything to old man Clint fixed it. He wouldn't care a
  curse off a common for us, and that's why I hinted at a fault in the line.
  It's 'Carston' he's after. Now, then, get out your gun."</p>

  <p>Clint strode into the camp, big and strong, hard as iron and merciless as
  ice. He found himself looking down the cool blue rim of Hunston's
  revolver.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"
     name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

    <img src="1301021h-images/TheVitalSpot.jpg"
         title="The cool blue rim of Hunston's revolver.">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Evening, Clint," Pardon said cheerfully. "Pretty good of you to come like
  this."</p>

  <p>"Pardon and Hunston," Clint stammered. "Why the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't swear," Pardon grinned. "No use, James. I found your wire and I
  tapped it. Learnt that game in the Boer War. And if you've come to see
  'Carston'&mdash;why, I might as well tell you as there ain't no Carston. I
  knew that I was talking to you this morning, and I put it up to you. We'll
  take all those provisions and those dogs, and we'll stay here till the frost
  comes, and then make our way to Milton City."</p>

  <p>Clint foiced a laugh from his great chest.</p>

  <p>"The joke is on me, boys," he said.</p>

  <p>"There's more of it to come," Pardon went on gravely. "You're a great man,
  James, and you've got imagination as well as grit; and you've got all this
  part in the hollow of your hand. And you've got a pile of dollars that
  rightly belong to us. There are others, too, who've suffered. If we were to
  shoot and bury you, the State wouldn't shed a tear. We're going to have those
  dollars back, James&mdash;two hundred thousand of 'em. Guess you told your
  cashier man, before you came, that you were gunning 'Carston.' But for
  'Carston,' you wouldn't have come yourself. So consider yourself our
  prisoner, James, unless you like to do the fair thing. Back on the track are
  others waiting for you. Now, you're going to write a note to your cashier,
  asking him to put in a cheque and send you two hundred thousand dollars in
  gold. I'll take that letter to those waiting for you on the last stage, and
  bring back the money. And if you play any game on us, we'll drill you full of
  lead, James."</p>

  <p>Clint's face darkened as he produced his note-book.</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," he said. "I guess I must. But it'll do you no good. I'll
  hunt you down; I'll put the State on you. The money is only borrowed. Here,
  will that satisfy vou?"</p>

  <p>Pardon smiled as he read the order.</p>

  <p>"Guess so," he said. "And pard and self ain't afraid, because you'll do
  nothing, James. You'd be the laughing-stock of the State, and you wouldn't
  like that. You'd find silence cheap at the price. Oh, yes, I am going to bind
  your hands and feet&mdash;I'm taking no risks. I'll just pop along to the
  other sledge and set the letter going. Then I'll come back, and we'll have a
  nice sociable meal together. So take it smiling, James, for you have been
  bested for once in your life, and don't you forget it."</p><br>

     name="story8">8.&mdash;THE WESTERN WAY</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Daily News</i>, Perth, Australia, 16 Aug
  1913</h3><br>

  <p class="first">LORRIMER caught sight of his man in a corner of the big
  reception room and lounged over in his direction. The other appeared to be
  discussing some abstruse semi-colon which might or might not add a
  significant flavor to the last thing in the way of Shavian comedies.
  Evidently, Mr. Ned Smith was a versatile person, for the last time that
  Lorrimer had met him was in the Persian Gulf in the midst of a technical
  discussion on gun-running and the best small arms weapon to place in the
  hands of raw troops.</p>

  <p>Who Mr. Ned Smith was or where he came from Lorrimer had not the smallest
  idea. Nor was it an easy matter to place his nationality. He did not look
  like a Chinaman nor yet a Jap, still the Tartar blood was in his body
  somewhere. It was his rippling fair hair that added to Lorrimer's mental
  confusion. There were other people interested in Ned Smith besides Lorrimer,
  and amongst these was a no less distinguished person than the Mongolese
  Ambassador. That same person came up to Lorrimer now and entered easily into
  conversation with him. His Excellency Sing Li was a polished man of the
  world, with a perfect command of excellent English.</p>

  <p>"You are a remarkable man, Lorrimer," he said. "And in your time appear to
  have met some remarkable people. Now, do you happen to know the picturesque-
  looking person who is at present discussing theatrical matters with Lady
  Sheraton?"</p>

  <p>Lorrimer shrugged his shoulders a little impatiently. As an old
  diplomatist himself, he had very little sympathy with the supersubtlety of
  the Oriental mind.</p>

  <p>"Considering that you saw us together in Paris two years ago, the question
  is rather superfluous," he said. "You want me to do something for you. What
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I want you to bring me in contact with Mr. Ned Smith. I have an
  idea he may be useful to me just now. As you know, Mongolese affairs are not
  too rosy; in fact,&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are on the verge of a revolution."</p>

  <p>"Well, let it go at that," the Ambassador admitted. "And I believe that
  Mr. Ned Smith can give me some valuable information. Do you happen to. know
  who he really is?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ned Smith, I suppose," Lorrimer said drily.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">STRANGELY enough this answer did not appear displeasing to
  Sing Li. Half an hour later the three men were discussing matters generally,
  over cigarettes. On the whole, it was an entertaining conversation between
  three brilliantly intellectual men. Lorrimer said little&mdash;he was too
  intently engaged in watching the other two. It reminded him of a game of
  chess between two masters. Outwardly the two Orientals were friendly enough,
  much as if they were fencing in the dark. The Ambassador rose presently.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to have to leave you," he said. "I shall be glad if you two
  gentlemen will do me a favor. I should like to carry this discussion a little
  further in another place. Will you both dine with me at the Embassy on
  Thursday night at eight o'clock. That will be this day week?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be delighted," Ned Smith said. "I am sure that we could exchange
  valuable information. Only unfortunately I am engaged for days ahead. If you
  could say Thursday fortnight, it would afford me great pleasure to dine with
  you."</p>

  <p>The Mongolese Ambassador said Thursday fortnight accordingly, and went his
  way. Ned Smith watched him with a certain suggestion of malicious mischief in
  his dark eyes.</p>

  <p>"That will give another week," he said, speaking as if to himself. "I beg
  your pardon, Lorrimer&mdash;I forgot you were here for a minute. Whatever you
  do, don't forget to keep that appointment for this day fortnight. I can
  promise you a certain interesting evening. His Excellency is perhaps the most
  daring and audacious man in London at the present moment&mdash;with the
  possible exception of myself. And, by the way, when I was here two years ago,
  there were strange stories afloat in connection with the kidnapping of the
  revolutionary leader, San Te. They said that he was last seen alive in a cab
  outside the Embassy. Several questions were asked about it, I remember. Did
  anything ever come of it?"</p>

  <p>Lorrimer shook his head. He remembered the circumstances distinctly
  enough. And he had little doubt in his mind that the rumors were true. Still,
  nothing had been proved, and the story had been gradually forgotten.</p>

  <p>"I shall be there," Lorrimer said. "Good night."</p>

  <p>For the next few days Lorrimer saw nothing of Ned Smith. He saw little or
  nothing of the Mongolese Ambassador either, for that shining light of
  diplomacy had his hands full just now. There was no doubt of the fact that
  the reigning dynasty was trembling to its fall. The great rebellion roared
  over the face of the land like a yellow flood. On every hand the
  revolutionaries were progressing. The good work done by that famous refugee,
  Hi See, was bearing abundant fruits now, and it only needed his presence to
  carry the new flag to victory.</p>

  <p>Of Hi See the most extraordinary stories were told. He seemed to bear a
  charmed life, he had had many a hairs-breadth escape, and the mere rumor of
  his being seen in one province was certain proof that he was somewhere else
  fanning the flame of revolution. For the last twelve months he seemed to have
  disappeared altogether. He had been heard of in Paris and Berlin, and
  wherever he had been seen there came arms and money and abundant assistance
  for the progressive party. The mere fact that his personality was so shadowy
  only tended to render him more God-like and heroic in the eyes of his
  followers. He was known to be a man of education, too, a gifted linguist, and
  it only needed his presence in the Mongolese Empire now to complete the
  victory. Like most men of his class, he had his enemies, and there were
  scores of his countrymen in every capital in Europe who would have murdered
  him cheerfully out of pure patriotism, to say nothing of the desire to
  hypothecate the price of ten thousand pounds which had been placed upon his
  head.</p>

  <p>Now, Hi See had recently issued a manifesto to his followers, in which he
  announced his intention of placing himself in command of the revolutionary
  movement within the next month. And this would have to be prevented at all
  costs, because, once it was accomplished, it would merely be a question of
  how long it was before the progressive party occupied the capital. And thus
  it was that every Chinese Embassy in Europe was straining its nervous system
  to lay hands on Hi See. Whether or not his premature taking off would have
  effectually stemmed the flowing tide was somewhat dubious. But it was held in
  high Mongolese diplomatic circles that the pleasing spectacle of Hi See's
  head on a pole might induce a reaction in favor of the reigning dynasty. In
  this year of grace the capital towns of Europe have reached a state of high
  refinement. But that proud boast would not have saved Hi See's skin once he
  had ventured across the threshold of the Mongolese Embassy.</p>

  <p>Still, with all the cares of state upon his shoulders, his Excellency
  welcomed his guests with a charming smile and a manner which appeared to be
  free from trouble. He had put away his own gorgeous national dress for the
  nonce, and appeared in the conventional evening garb of an English gentleman.
  The dinner, too, was quite Occidental; in fact, but for the presence of three
  or four Mongolese servants, the Oriental atmosphere was entirely lacking.</p>

  <p>The conversation was general enough for the time being, but as the meal
  drew to a close the inevitable politics came up for review. Here were three
  men of the world who had surveyed mankind from China to Peru, and to whom
  high diplomacy in most countries of the world was an open letter. They sat
  there over coffee and liqueur and cigarettes, for the conversation was
  growing interesting, and no one seemed disposed to move.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">"SHALL we adjourn," the Ambassador suggested; "or would you
  prefer to continue the discussion here?"</p>

  <p>"This is very delightful," Ned Smith murmured. "I always prefer to sip my
  coffee and smoke my cigarette when I am at the table. Moreover, we have not
  the charming sex to consider. It is sometimes an advantage for one's host to
  be a bachelor."</p>

  <p>"The bachelor has no cares," Lorrimer said.</p>

  <p>The Ambassador laughed none too pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Has he not?" he asked. "There are few men in London to-night who have
  more than I. But it is a great consolation to feel that I am going to get rid
  of one of them before daybreak."</p>

  <p>"This sounds interesting," Lorrimer smiled. "Won't your Excellency be a
  little more explicit?"</p>

  <p>The Ambassador smiled a curious smile as he reached for a fresh cigarette
  and poured out another liqueur.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he said. "Now, what would you consider to be my greatest
  anxiety for the moment?"</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess the riddle," Ned Smith said quietly. "You are talking
  about the infamous rebel, Hi See."</p>

  <p>"That is correct," the Ambassador laughed. "If we could get rid of him,
  most of my country's trouble would be over."</p>

  <p>"Our friend would be flattered if he could only hear you," Ned Smith said.
  "I perceive that this would make an ideal prison-house for the moment. I
  notice that the shutters of this room are made of steel, and so, if I mistake
  not, is also the front door, judging by the way in which it closed behind us
  to- night. One would hardly dare in an atmosphere like this to say anything
  unflattering about the reigning Mongolese dynasty. Hi See would be equally
  impotent here once he was your prisoner. Not that you can ever hope for
  that."</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," the Ambassador said softly. "I'm naturally of a
  sanguine temperament, and if the opportunity came, I should not hesitate. I
  should&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A soft-footed servant came in at that moment with a telegram, which he
  handed to Lorrimer. As the latter took the orange-colored envelope from the
  salver, Ned Smith put a detaining hand and pitched the telegram carelessly
  into the centre of the table. His face had suddenly grown grim and set; there
  was a look of angry displeasure on the Ambassador's features.</p>

  <p>"May I be permitted to be rude just for one moment?" Ned Smith said. "May
  I ask you to ignore that telegram for a time? I have reason to believe that
  the message is of no importance. At any rate, I know it was sent under a
  misapprehension. Now as to this Hi See. Suppose he were here at the present
  moment. You couldn't do anything with him so long as Mr. Lorrimer knew the
  circumstances in which he came. Now I happen to know a good deal about Hi
  See. He is the last man in the world to put his head in the net. And yet he
  would have not the slightest hesitation in coming here if he thought that it
  would serve his purpose to do so. I suppose you've never met him,
  Lorrimer?"</p>

  <p>"I never had the good fortune," Lorrimer said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you will before long," Ned Smith went on. "No, please don't touch
  that telegram just yet. Let me tell you a little more about Hi See first. I
  won't go into a biographical sketch, because the papers have done all that
  more or less untruly. I do happen to know that every Mongolese Embassy in
  Europe has had a try for him. If only he had fallen into the trap he would
  have been a dead man long ago. He would have been murdered in London or
  Berlin or Paris, and not a soul been any the wiser. As a rule, the servants
  of the Embassy are to be trusted to keep silent. But, after all, there is
  even a better plan than a crude, vulgar murder. The man might be kidnapped
  here under the very eyes or the authorities, and taken back home without
  anybody being in the least the wiser. I know what I am talking about."</p>

  <p>"Are you speaking from a brief?" the Ambassador sneered.</p>

  <p>"No, from personal experience," Ned Smith said quietly. "As a matter of
  fact, I am Hi See."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">LORRIMER started to his feet, then as suddenly sat down
  again. Here was drama red-hot to his hand. The face of the Ambassador paled a
  little, though his face was hard and resolute.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I had better go on," Hi See said quietly. "Our host here has
  known for quite a month that I was in London. I don't know how he recognised
  me, neither does it in the least matter. And I knew that he knew me when you
  made us personally acquainted the other night. And I was quite aware, too, of
  the risk I was running in accepting the invitation to dinner this evening.
  The prison house is secure enough&mdash;I am here behind steel bars, and the
  servants for the most part are prepared to commit anything from arson to
  murder at the bidding of their master."</p>

  <p>Lorrimer looked up, white, but determined.</p>

  <p>"You seem to forget that I am here," he said quietly. "I am a British
  subject in my own capital&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so, quite so," Hi See went on. "But perhaps our host would like
  to take a hand. It seems to me that I am vulgarly monopolising the
  conversation."</p>

  <p>His Excellency shook his head sulkily.</p>

  <p>"My turn will come&mdash;presently," he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Then I am to proceed," Hi See smiled. "You were not to be here at all,
  Lorrimer. The ingenious idea was that you should leave before me and proof
  would have been given you to-morrow that I did not remain many minutes after
  you left. You would never have troubled if you had never seen me again. I am
  a wanderer who comes and goes; nobody knows anything about me, and no
  questions would have been asked. And now, if you please, you can open that
  telegram. You will find in it an urgent message asking you to return to your
  chambers at once. If you don't find the message as I say it is I am greatly
  mistaken."</p>

  <p>Lorrimer tore open the envelope and ran his eye rapidly over the contents.
  He smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"The tricks are all yours up to now," he said.</p>

  <p>"If you call up your flat on the telephone," Hi See went on, "you will
  find that no such message was sent. The simple scheme was merely to get you
  out of the way and leave me here alone. It was an excellent idea to invite
  you to dine here as well as me to-night, and was calculated to allay any
  suspicions as to my welcome. But that is not the whole of the plot. A day or
  two ago a Chinaman of low caste was brought here practically on his death
  bed. He died in the course of time, and a medical certificate was given by
  the doctor who was called in. The dead Chinaman was smuggled away somehow,
  but this coffin still remains in the house. It may interest you to know that
  I was destined to occupy that coffin. I should have been drugged directly you
  had gone, and to-morrow I should have been taken down to Southampton and
  placed on board a steam yacht there already, waiting to convey me to my
  native land. What would have happened afterwards I leave you to guess. And
  now, seeing that I have said so much, I will leave it to his Excellency to
  continue. My story is finished."</p>

  <p>But his Excellency sat there, saying nothing. An awkward silence followed
  for a minute or two. Lorrimer would have spoken, but Hi See raised a hand as
  a signal for him to stop.</p>

  <p>"Come, I am waiting," Hi See commanded in a grating voice. "It is for me
  to command, you understand."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be said," the Ambassador muttered. "My hands are
  tied. The presence of Mr. Lorrimer here renders me powerless. But if you are
  waiting for any apology I have none to make. I can only regret my failure.
  You, Hi See, are a fellow-countryman of mine, and you understand. If the
  circumstances were reversed you would take my life with as little compunction
  as I would take yours. The time may come yet. Gentlemen, you are free to
  go."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">THE AMBASSADOR rose from the table and bowed in the
  direction of the door. Lorrimer half rose to his feet, but Hi See never
  moved. He looked up grimly.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he commanded. "Don't dare to move till I tell you. It is your
  belief that you are the master in this house. For the moment you are
  mistaken. Mine is the voice of authority. Your Excellency will give me your
  watch-chain. I desire to borrow from it the key which opens the safe in your
  study."</p>

  <p>Something, like an oath came from the Ambassador's lips. As he rose to his
  feet again two silent forms came apparently from nowhere and stood on either
  side of him. Two chill blue circles pressed on his temple, and from under his
  scowling lids he recognised a pair of the servants who had been waiting on
  the party during dinner. At a curt command from Hi See he snatched the chain
  angrily from his pocket and threw it angrily upon the table.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would appreciate the argument," Hi See said. "These
  servants are not yours, but mine. There are four of them here who have been
  in our pay for years. Two of them are guarding you, and the other two are
  looking after the rest of the household. By this time I suppose the rest of
  the servants are peacefully sleeping under the influence of the same drug
  that would have been administered to me. You will remain here while I spend a
  few minutes in searching your safe. There I shall find papers and documents
  of the utmost importance to us. I am sorry to detain you, Mr. Lorrimer; but
  all is fair in love and war, and it will be necessary, if only for your sake,
  that I should make good my retreat. Circumstances will prevent me meeting you
  again in London, but if in the course of time you should ever visit Aria
  again, I shall be glad to make you the honored guest of the Mongolese
  Republic. And I should not be surprised to find his Excellency holding office
  under the Progressive party."</p>

  <p>It was a quaint, queer silence that followed. The Ambassador sat there
  downcast and ill at ease, with the two sentries standing on either side of
  him. Then Hi See returned, carrying a mass of papers in his hands. He waved
  the servants aside, and stood there grim and smiling in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"I am going now," he said. "The steel shutters are made fast, and I
  propose to lock this door from the outside. You may find it a little
  monotonous, but the servants will release you in the morning. And, my dear
  Lorrimer, I am not behaving so badly to you as you imagine. I know what your
  Western civilisation calls for, and it would be a great regret to me if I
  left anybody a chance of saying that you were my confederate in this matter.
  I wish you good night, gentlemen, and, oh, yes&mdash;what was I going to say?
  I have it&mdash;there is something in the Western Method after all!"</p><br>

  <p class="first">"NOW perhaps you had better explain," Mostyn Carr said to
  his companion. "I came down to Dinard for a change of air. I can ill afford
  it, but it had to be. Now you come to me, a perfect stranger, and feed me en
  prince. Why, Mr. Barrington?"</p>

  <p>"You can feed en prince every night, if you like," Barrington said. He was
  a man of forty, and he would have passed anywhere as a soldier. A resolute
  wiry figure, with a keen eye and a strong determined face. "You like this
  kind of thing, eh?"</p>

  <p>"All novelists do," Carr laughed bitterly. "It's like a plot of one of my
  stories. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"One of those very same plots," Barrington said, evenly. "You are ready to
  do anything for money. I am a passingly clever adventurer&mdash;racecourse,
  cards, city. I have a nerve of steel, an audacity of brass, I know every
  capital in Europe, and I speak five languages fluently. Give me a plot, and I
  can carry it out with fidelity and cunning. I have been absolutely candid
  with you. If you cannot consent to come in with me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, I couldn't. No nerve. Still I can plot all right. There
  was a little thing I sketched out the other day, for instance, after France
  broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican. Unless you are in a position
  to command at least two thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no trouble about the money," Barrington said. "Oh, the money is
  all right enough, all I want is the scheme. Give me the outline of it."</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you say to looting the Vatican?"</p>

  <p>Barrington leant forward with a gleam in his grey eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said quietly. "That is something after my own heart. A la
  bonne heure!"</p>

  <p>"You will go to Rome," Carr continued, "and I shall write instructions
  there&mdash;tell me, can you put your hands upon some young man who is ready
  for anything in the way of an intrigue if he is paid for it? He must have the
  address of a gentleman, and he must be safely out of the way afterwards. One
  you betray to the police for choice?"</p>

  <p>Barrington intimated that there would be no difficulty in that
  respect.</p>

  <p>"Very good. I find that these bread disturbances in Rome and Florence are
  merely sleeping. Could you undertake to start them again in a mild form? The
  loot of the Vatican is impossible you may argue, which is why that is going
  to happen. You have the nerve?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Barrington said quietly. "I have the nerve."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">In a small, well appointed house in the Rue de petit Bois
  dwelt one Count de Rivi, an elegant and accomplished young gentleman who had
  more than once come under the eye of the police on suspicion of having been
  concerned in some of the numberless Legitimist plots that the French police
  are constantly discovering. Anyway, De Rivi was known to be a great friend or
  the Duke of Morleans, and in Legitimist organs he wrote his opinions freely.
  The Duke of Morleans was in America now, so that the vigilant eye of justice
  was more or less relaxed so far as the Rue de petit Bois was concerned.</p>

  <p>It is needless to say that Carl de Rivi viewed with anxiety and alarm the
  breaking off of diplomatic relations between the Republic and the Vatican.
  Something must be done to restore the lamentable breach, and De Rivi felt
  that he was the man to do it. One morning&mdash;it was a fortnight later than
  the interview between Carr and Barrington&mdash;De Rivi was gratified by the
  receipt of a long cablegram in the cypher of the brotherhood in New York. It
  was from the Duke of Morleans, alluding to the Vatican split, and commanding
  De Rivi to repair immediately to Rome, and there to hold a consultation with
  Cardinal Ravinni, who was known to have a strong leaning in the direction of
  the Bourbon dynasty. Cardinal Ravinni was expecting this visit from the Count
  and there was some suggestion that the Pope would be likely to grant an
  audience. It was all very vague, essentially diplomatic, and absolutely after
  De Rivi's own heart.</p>

  <p>De Rivi immediately wrote to some length to the Cardinal, appointing two
  days later for the important interview. This thing must be kept as dark as
  the grave, he told himself. All the same, he was a little disturbed to read
  in the next morning's 'Matin' that the Vatican was moving in the matter of
  the recent deplorable dispute, and that rumour had it that a certain
  prominent Bourbon supporter had been approached with a view to engaging his
  services as a mediator. De Rivi wondered how it was done. An old journalistic
  hand like Mostyn Carr could have told him. The Count also noticed in the same
  journal that the Rome bread riots had broken out again, but this time in only
  a mild form.</p>

  <p>As he had arranged, De Rivi departed for Rome two days later. His rooms
  were modest and unassuming, and he flattered himself that nobody in the
  Italian capital would know of his arrival. He had dined, and was taking his
  modest glass of Chianti after dinner, when a stranger was announced, who
  declined to give his name.</p>

  <p>"You had better ask the gentleman in," De Rivi said as coolly as possible.
  He had little doubt as to the identity of his visitor. "And see that I am not
  disturbed."</p>

  <p>A typical Italian in a long cloak and a heavy slouch hat entered, and
  carefully closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Then he proceeded to disrobe and show the dark, clean-shaven face of
  Cardinal Ravinni. There was nothing distinguished looking about the man, his
  features were quite of the ordinary type. Two of his upper front teeth were
  missing.</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to see your eminence," the Count said. "Pray be seated. It
  would have been more fitting if I had paid my compliments to you at the
  Vatican; but really, one cannot be too cautious. Already one of our Parisian
  papers has an inkling of my mission."</p>

  <p>"It were far best to proceed slowly," the Cardinal said. "As for me, you
  know exactly where my sympathies lie. It would be a great day for the Holy
  See that saw the end of your accursed republic and France in the fold again.
  But festina lente," he murmured. "It is not yet. The Pope is ailing, though
  for reasons we have not made the matter public. As for me, I make myself
  greatly unpopular in my advocacy for peace. I have many enemies amongst the
  advanced Catholic party in Corsica. I have been threatened with
  assassination. And Rome is greatly disturbed since some agitator has started
  those bread riots again. When I walk the streets as I am doing tonight it is
  with a positive danger to myself."</p>

  <p>The Count was exceedingly sorry to hear it. Surely the extreme party must
  see the folly of keeping up this miserable quarrel with the Government of
  France. Had the Pope expressed any opinion on the matter, had the mission
  from Paris been mentioned to him?</p>

  <p>"Well, I have hinted at it," the Cardinal confessed. "As I said before,
  festina lente is our motto. It is easily possible for me to gain you an
  interview with his Holiness. There can be no harm in his granting audience.
  Beforehand, I will let you know how far to go. Meanwhile, you had best remain
  here quietly, and not seek to see me. Be prepared at any time if I send for
  you to come to my lodgings at the Vatican. It is a little gate in the lane
  that runs by the side of the gardens. No; I need not detain you longer."</p>

  <p>The Cardinal donned his hat and cloak and departed. The streets were
  fairly quiet save for a few dissolute fellows making a noise&mdash;the
  outcome of a recent renewed bread riot which the police claimed to have
  broken up. All the same, the Cardinal prudently turned down the dark lane by
  the side of the Vatican gardens, and sought entrance that way. It was very
  dark at one spot, with overhanging trees. Something lurked in the shadow. As
  the Cardinal passed a detaining hand was laid on his shoulder. Before he
  could turn a pair of powerful arms were about his neck, something sweet and
  subtle and stupefying was clapped to his mouth and nostrils. There was a
  faint struggle that a child might have made, and Cardinal Ravinni lay on his
  back breathing peacefully. A door opened close at hand with a sharp click, a
  satisfied chuckle from the darkness, and all was still save the pattering of
  rain as it fell on the umbrella pines.</p>

  <p>It was nearly an hour later when Cardinal Ravinni staggered into the hall
  of the Guards, and looked vaguely around him. Under his slouched hat his face
  looked deadly pale, there was blood on his forehead, and his lips were
  swollen and disfigured. He stood there a moment as if he were trying to
  realise his surroundings. A sergeant of the Swiss Guard hurried forward,
  prepared to raise an alarm. Ravinni seemed to feel this by a kind of
  instinct. He laid a detaining hand upon the sergeant's arm. For an old man
  badly maimed, his grip was a powerful one.</p>

  <p>"Say nothing," he whispered. "Make no disturbance. It is vital that there
  should be no fuss. I have met with an accident. Take me to my apartments at
  once. There is something the matter with my eyes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But your eminence&mdash;" the sergeant stammered. "It is impossible to
  recognise. I have the honour to speak to one of the Cardinals. As to the
  rest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker made a significant gesture. By the dress alone he knew that he
  was in the presence of one of the College of Cardinals, but the slouch hat,
  the swollen and bloody face rendered recognition out of the question.</p>

  <p>"Ravinni," the dignitary whispered. "I have met with an injury that could
  not by any stretch of imagination be called an accident. The
  Mafiosi&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker appeared to grow misty and confused again. He was so dazed
  that it was impossible for him to find the way to his apartments. The proper
  thing would have been to raise an alarm, but the Cardinal had strictly
  forbidden that. And the longer the delay the greater the responsibility of
  the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"If your eminence will take my arm," he suggested. "Your secretary passed
  this way just now in the direction of your apartments. Doubtless he awaits
  your eminence."</p>

  <p>He did, a little, dark, earnest looking man, who exclaimed with dismay at
  the sight of the Cardinal. Ravinni sank in his chair and passed a
  handkerchief to his face. By a gesture he indicated that the light was too
  strong for him. The sergeant had discreetly retired. The secretary stood
  waiting for his chief to speak.</p>

  <p>"It is nothing," Ravinni said in a hoarse tone. Something seemed to impede
  his speech. "It is no more than the fulfilment of a threat. I was lucky to
  escape with my life."</p>

  <p>"Your eminence is too fearless, too outspoken," the secretary said
  suavely. "But surely that will keep. It is necessary to summon a
  doctor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is necessary to do nothing of the sort. I am getting better already.
  It is a late hour, and everybody has retired. I will wash my bruises
  presently when my face has become less tender, meanwhile, there is work to be
  done. My keys, Father Ravogli."</p>

  <p>A bunch of keys was produced, one a pass key that Ravinni fumbled in his
  hand. He asked a few questions rapidly&mdash;evidently his brain was not
  affected.</p>

  <p>"Late as it is, I have an errand for you Ravogli," he said. "I suppose you
  have guessed where I went to-night?"</p>

  <p>"Seeing that your eminence was so good as to tell me. It was to see Count
  de Rivi. It was a dangerous mission under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Why? Nobody could possibly know that the Count had come here, or what his
  mission was."</p>

  <p>"There your eminence is quite mistaken. The papers nowadays learn
  everything. It was stated in the Paris 'Matin,' for instance, this morning
  that the Count was coming here to try and patch up the dispute that we
  deplore so much. It was known, too, that he came to see you. The extreme
  party here were aware of that. They wanted no settlement. If the Mafiosi
  leaders took in their heads to interfere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Ravogli, they have already done so. Such a chance of mischief was
  not to be neglected. The Mafiosi are at work in this matter. The most
  powerful secret society and the oldest in Europe, have sworn to kill me if I
  do not hold my hand. They have started the bread riots again to cover their
  movements. But for a lucky chance I should have been killed to-night."</p>

  <p>The Cardinal appeared to be overcome with a sudden faintness. He mumbled
  some questions about his keys, he seemed to have forgotten the use of some of
  them.</p>

  <p>"But it is idle to sit here talking," he said as if struggling with his
  feelings. "There is much to be done. Take me to my bedroom and give me the
  pass key to the library. When I have washed and lain down for a spell I shall
  be better. Meanwhile I have something for you to do. The errand is not
  without a suggestion of danger."</p>

  <p>Ravogli pulled himself up proudly. The call of the Holy Church was
  sufficient. He was ready to meet any danger for her sake. His eyes gleamed in
  the feeble light. With a shaking hand the Cardinal produced a letter from his
  robes.</p>

  <p>"You are to take this," he commanded. "You are to go as far as the
  foothills beyond the Coliseum. You will see a broken gateway there set
  amongst a clump of umbrella pines. Sit down there and wait till a man accosts
  you. He will ask whether you have seen anything of a brown dog, and you will
  reply that the dog is found. Then you will give him this letter, and receive
  a small parcel in exchange. Bring it back to me at once. You may succeed in
  your mission, or you may have to wait for hours, it all depends on the other
  man. In any case you must not wait till after daybreak, but you must return
  by the small gate in the lane behind the garden. Have I made myself quite
  explicit?"</p>

  <p>"I understand what your eminence requires to the very letter," Ravogli
  said, "If there is anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. You can give me your arm as far as the library. Every now and again
  I feel as if I am going to faint. There are certain things I want to do
  before I retire to rest. It may be that to-morrow I shall be ill and
  forbidden to rise by the doctor. In that case all the good work will be
  undone. Come along!"</p>

  <p>The magnificent library of the Vatican was reached at length. There were
  other treasures here beyond books and priceless manuscripts, cases of
  precious coins, jewels, the thousand odds and ends small in bulk, but
  representing a fortune each in itself. Give a thief a free hand here and in a
  few minutes he would have been rich beyond expectation. The lights burned
  low, but still they flashed on the treasure here and there. But Cardinal
  Ravinni saw nothing of this. He seemed to be fighting for the mastery of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"The weakness is passing," he said, "at least, for the present. Give me
  pen and paper. Thanks. And of your errand, and of my misfortune, you are to
  say nothing to a soul."</p>

  <p>Ravogli bowed and departed. For a little time the Cardinal sat waiting
  there, then he seemed to grow restless and he rose to his feet. He wandered
  aimlessly about the magnificent apartment, a clock in the distance struck the
  hour of one. As if the clang of the bell were something like a warning he
  turned rapidly from the room in the direction of his own apartments. He had
  tied up his bleeding face with a soft handkerchief; he seemed very old and
  feeble to the guard as be passed through the hall again. The sergeant went so
  far as to speak.</p>

  <p>"Your eminence is not going out again?" he asked. "The extent of your
  injuries it is perhaps presumption on my part, to say so, but your
  eminence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are a kind and thoughtful man," Ravinni said. "It is not far that I
  go, something of importance that I dropped outside. Then I will go to bed. Be
  discreet and silent, and it will go well with you."</p>

  <p>This with the air of a benefactor. But the sergeant had seen many strange
  things there, and this was not the strangest of them all.</p>

  <p>He stood aside as the Cardinal passed and pulled the heavy door softly
  behind him.</p>

  <p>It was dark in the grounds so that Ravinni hesitated for a moment. Then as
  if bracing himself for an effort, he walked rapidly along the road with his
  face turned in the direction of the glowing lights of the city.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">The tragedy of Cardinal Ravinni's death thrilled Europe for
  a day or two. The well-known leader of the Moderate party had been found dead
  just outside the Vatican gardens, his head and face mutilated beyond all
  recognition. It was a startling mystery altogether and nobody could make
  anything of it. There was no inquest or anything of that kind, so that the
  matter was likely to rest where it was.</p>

  <p>But one man could have thrown a brilliant light on the dark places, and
  that one man was sitting coughing in a snug little restaurant on the
  Boulevard des Hermes.</p>

  <p>In the doorway presently stood the trim neat military figure of Trevor
  Barrington. He strolled over and took his place by Mostyn Carr's side, as if
  they had been casual acquaintances.</p>

  <p>"You've ordered dinner, I see," he said. "A little potage, trout in
  champagne, an ortolan, and a pawn curry. Old Cliquot, too. Come, we are
  getting on. This money&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have four francs left," Carr said. "But I trusted to you to do the
  business side of the affair. I suppose you managed it all right."</p>

  <p>Barrington tapped a bulging pocket complacently. He sniffed approvingly at
  the soup.</p>

  <p>"That was child's play," he remarked. "Of course, one had to make
  sacrifices, especially where gems and cups and coins with a history were
  concerned. But I suppose that when we come to settle up there will be seventy
  thousand pounds to divide. If it had not been a single-handed business I
  should have cleared out the whole Vatican."</p>

  <p>"But on the whole you have no reason to be dissatisfied. I told you that
  the thing was ridiculously easy. All you had to do was to follow out my
  instructions."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know. But you might have been more candid with me. You treated me a
  little bit as a general treats his men, you know. I did exactly as I was
  told, but all the same I was and am very much in the dark as to the way
  things were managed."</p>

  <p>Carr poured himself out a glass of champagne. He picked daintily at his
  ortolan.</p>

  <p>"All in good time," he said. "I have been lying low the last few days,
  having a fried fish done in oil and hard brown bread. The food in Rome was
  abominable."</p>

  <p>"My dear Carr," Barrington cried. "What do you know about the food in
  Rome?"</p>

  <p>"Because I was there all the time," Carr said coolly. "I had to be. I took
  no active part in the conspiracy, because I am such an abominable coward. I
  should have lost my nerve and spoilt the whole business. But I had to be on
  the spot all the time. By-the-bye, what became of that young man who played
  the part of our confederate? I particularly asked you to chose some fellow
  whose acquaintance with the police&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Barrington said calmly. "A line to the authorities
  at Vienna soon settled the hash. We are not in the least likely to meet
  again."</p>

  <p>Carr leaned back in his chair with the air of a man who is absolutely
  satisfied. He luxuriated over his cigarette and Benedictine. The flavour of
  both was exquisite.</p>

  <p>"Then that removed the last element of danger," he said. "Now confess, my
  dear Barrington, you are exceedingly curious to know how the whole thing was
  done. Light your cigar, and I will tell you. For some little time I had been
  casting round for a plot of sufficient importance, a raid on a Royal scale.
  The Tower had been done, so had Windsor Castle&mdash;in fiction, I mean. Then
  why not the Vatican? As I told you before the split between the Pope and
  France gave me the first idea. The mere fact that I was a close student of
  European affairs rendered my task easier. From the very first I began to see
  my way. When I found that the Duke of Morleans had gone to America the thing
  was quite easy.</p>

  <p>"Of course I had read a good deal about the views and the ambitions of
  Cardinal Ravinni. Also I was more or less acquainted with the same attributes
  regarding Count Rivi. By way of opening the ball, I instructed you to get
  those cablegrams sent from America to the Count De Rivi and the Cardinal
  respectively as if they had emanated from the Duke of Morleans. You managed
  that very well. As I expected, De Rivi went to Rome, and there saw the
  Cardinal. I saw the Cardinal call at the Count's lodgings, and then I knew we
  were safe. Meanwhile I had looked up some old journalistic acquaintances in
  Rome. You see my work is pretty well known, in fact I have had stories of
  mine translated for the Italian papers. I desired to see something of the
  ways and work of the Mafiosi, and that was easily managed. So was that bread
  riot business. One or two rioters were killed, and it was not very difficult
  to procure one of the bodies. That body your confederate hid in a ditch by
  the side of the Vatican garden according to my instructions. The procuring of
  the corpse in Rome is no difficult matter. Then came the only hazardous
  thing&mdash;the kidnapping of the Cardinal and the spiriting away of the
  great cleric during which time you assumed his clothes and made up your face
  as if you had been in some deadly conflict. This was where your courage and
  nerve came in, and where I should have failed. Thanks to books and guides,
  Baedeker and the like, you have a pretty fair knowledge of what to do and
  where to go. Made up as you were it was easy to deceive the secretary Ravogli
  and get him to guide you to the library. Having got Ravogli out of the way,
  you had only to fill your pockets and disappear. The next item on the
  programme was to place the Cardinal's clothes upon the body of that mutilated
  corpse so kindly produced by the Mafiosi and the problem was complete."</p>

  <p>"Capital," Barrington cried, as Carr stopped and coughed. "But the real
  Cardinal?"</p>

  <p>"Was released from the empty house to which we removed him yesterday,"
  Carr explained. "I thought that out early in the scheme. By this time the
  real Cardinal is back again at the Vatican. It does not matter to us what
  explanation he makes, one thing you may be certain of&mdash;the Vatican will
  keep silence. If you had left only the bare walls behind you the policy of
  silence would still be maintained. Cardinal Ravinni will walk about Rome
  blandly and shake his head, saying he cannot be responsible for sensational
  reports. Europe has heard the last of that."</p>

  <p>"Um," Barrington muttered. "Seems exceedingly simple when it comes to be
  explained. After all, anybody might have done it."</p>

  <p>Carr's thin face flushed angrily. The vanity of the author was touched. He
  lighted a fresh cigarette with a hand that trembled a little.</p>

  <p>"You should never explain problems to children and fools," he said. "If I
  had told you nothing, you would have regarded me as a prodigy of wisdom, and
  respected me all the more. Could you have planned out this campaign,
  man?"</p>

  <p>Barrington did not think he could. The flush died out of Carr's thin face,
  his eyes smiled. He was satisfied.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"I BEG your pardon." Mrs. Wildney suggested. "You were
  saying something about eleven o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"What! out loud?" Chesney gasped. "My dear lady, pray accept my profound
  apologies I&mdash;I have a stupid habit of thinking aloud. As a matter of
  fact, I have a most important appointment for eleven o'clock to-night; but
  that I had mentioned in <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wildney glanced at the speaker from under the purple fringe of her
  eyelashes. They were very old friends, and they could speak plainly. The talk
  round the dinner table was animated; the lights were judiciously shaded.
  Mabel Wildney held her hand on Chesney's arm.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Ralph?" she whispered. "Tell me the trouble. I'd love to help
  you if I can."</p>

  <p>Chesney laughed somewhat uneasily. So&mdash;people were beginning to talk.
  He was utterly unconscious of the hard misery in his eyes, the moody frown,
  the gnawing of the lips.</p>

  <p>"So you imagine that there is something wrong, Mabel?" he forced.</p>

  <p>"My dear boy, I am certain of it. Why didn't Betty come here tonight?"</p>

  <p>Chesney slipped the pink velvet from a peach thoughtfully. Oh, certainly
  people were beginning to talk. As a matter of fact, Mabel Wildney was
  speaking quite plainly. Bitter as he was, a certain blind, unreasonable
  loyalty spurred him on.</p>

  <p>"She meant to come," he said. "But she had a bad headache, and I had to
  come alone. We were going on to the Malvains afterwards, but I don't think
  I'll show there alone."</p>

  <p>"Ralph, I am deeply sorry to see you two drifting apart in this way. You
  met Betty for the first time in my house, remember. I was delighted to see
  you coming together. And now!"</p>

  <p>"We all make mistakes," Chesney said, bitterly. "I did. Possibly Betty did
  too."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. It was a great mistake on your part to negleot her
  so."</p>

  <p>Chesney fairly started. He prided himself on being a just man, and here
  was a new point of view. Neglected Betty!&mdash;ridiculous! On the contrary,
  it was she who had neglected him. She had lost all interests in the sports
  they had previously enjoyed together; she made all kinds of excuses when he
  suggested a day on the links; she had chosen her own friends entirely outside
  his circle. If he wanted her to dine at one house, she had always made an
  appointment elsewhere. She had grown cold and distant, fretful, and inclined
  to tears. There were long silences when they were together&mdash;she whose
  conversation had at one time been so bright and animated. This was bad
  enough, but there were darker thoughts behind. Of course, he could take no
  notice of those anonymous letters&mdash;no gentleman could stoop to that kind
  of thing. But even now he was hesitating in his mind. A jingle of words ran
  like water in his head:</p>

  <p>"So you refuse to be warned? Your wife will plead a headache to remain
  home to-night. Tell her you are going to the Malvains, but return home by
  eleven instead. Fool. Have you no regard for your own honor? This may be your
  last chance."</p>

  <p>No gentleman could do it. Some enemy had designed this thing. It was not
  the first of these abominations either. There had been two previous
  communications before; and the worst of it was that they had tallied with
  certain movements of Betty's. He could not think evil; but the conclusion was
  forced upon him. Still it was quite plain that no gentleman&mdash;</p>

  <p>He would go on to the Malvains as if nothing had happened. To return home
  now would be tacitly to put the letter to the test. Betty had had a headache
  right enough. Anyone could see that from her pala face and the purple shadows
  under her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"Are you not going a bit to far, Mabel?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Think it over," Mrs. Wildney said. "Think it over with your last cigar.
  Oh, what a fool a really clever man can be sometimes!"</p>

  <p>There was a ripple of silken skirts, the drifting odors of perfumes,
  followed by a scratching of matches, as the womankind floated from the room.
  Chesney shook himself together wearily. The inevitable discussion on sport
  was going to begin. How illogical he was; a fortnight ago he would have
  enjoyed it. As an enthusiastic golfer on the plus side he would hava gone
  cheerfully into the fray. The last faw days he had played like a child. They
  were chaffing him on his putting now, though he was utterly oblivious to
  it.</p>

  <p>He managed to get away at length, carefully avoiding Mabel Wildney as he
  did so. With the jingle of that anonymous latter chiming on his brain, it was
  his bounden duty to go on to the Malvains. To show his contempt for the
  writer, he must not go home. Betty might have grown cold and indifferent; she
  might have ceased to care for him; possibly it was not in her nature to care
  for anybody but herself. But when it came to some vulgar intrigue, a
  surreptitious meeting in&mdash;oh, hang it!</p>

  <p>He didn't care for her any longer, of course. That dream was shattered,
  and there was an end to it. They could come to some kind of understanding, so
  as to avoid anything like a scandal; there was no reason why they should not
  remain friends in future. They could talk the matter over quietly and
  dispassionately. Chesney knew scores of households like that.</p>

  <p>So this poor fool, hugging his cheap philosophy, walked along without the
  remotest notion whether he was going, and all unconsciously he had turned his
  steps in the direction of his own house. He was up in Scotland in the early
  days of the honeymoon&mdash;by the side of a salmon river, showing Betty how
  to play her fish. And, by Jove! how quickly she had learnt her lesson! How
  ripping she had looked in that kilted skirt and grey hat. She was one of the
  few women who could look fascinating in a sporting kit. And what a jolly
  evening they had had in the little hotel afterwards; and, incidentally, what
  sentimental asses men are!</p>

  <p>There were other pictures like this, warm and glowing, in Chesney's eyes
  as he strode along the deserted streets. With a start he realised presently
  that he was outside his own house. Involuntarily he glanced up at his wife's
  bedroom windows, only to note that no light was there. Betty always liked a
  light. Even when she was ill she could not bear to be in the dark. In an
  uneasy way Chesney wondered what it meant. He had had no intention of coming
  home yet; honestly, he had not meant to do so. Still, it did not much matter;
  in fact, nothing mattered now. Having come so far, it would be absurd to turn
  back. It would be far better to think the thing out over a cigar in the
  smoking- room. Possibly Betty had changed, and come down stairs.</p>

  <p>Chesney pushed his way into the hall and hung up his coat. The dining and
  drawing rooms were in darkness, only in the smoking-room were the lights
  switched on. A maid crossed the hall demurely.</p>

  <p>"How is your mistress, Batley?" Chesney asked. "Is her head better?"</p>

  <p>The maid looked jjust a little bewildered. "I beg your pardon, sir," she
  said. "Madame is not in. She went out some time ago."</p>

  <p>Chesney turned on his heel sharply. He was concerned that the maid should
  not see his face for the moment. The simple announcement shook him with the
  force of a blow. "She is much better, then?" he asked. "Where has she gone,
  Batley?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you, sir," the girl replied. "I dressed my mistress just
  after dinner. She said something about the theatre. No, sir, she didn't have
  the car. I called a taxi-cab for her. And she told me I was not to sit
  up."</p>

  <p>Chesney dismissed the girl with a careless gesture. He hummed a time as he
  lounged into the smoking-room and closed the door behind him. His face had
  grown white under the healthy tan.</p>

  <p>Good heavens! If this hideous thing were true! For the first time tho
  awful significance of those anonymous letters came home to him. It was
  impossible to disregard the warning any longer. He had played the game up to
  now, but his personal honor stood in front of everything. He hated and
  loathed this thing from the bottom of his soul, but there were limits. It was
  no longer possible to blind himself to the fact that Betty had deceived him.
  Her headache had been a mere sham. Secure in the knowledge that Chesney would
  not be back till the small hours, she had gone off to keep her assignation.
  The whole thing was disgustingly cheap, and theatrical to a degree.</p>

  <p>The thought stung Chesney to madness. Whatever Betty's feelings might been
  he had never ceased to care for her. In the bitterness of tho moment he
  admitted it freely. Now that he had lost her, the whole world seemed to have
  turned to dust and ashes. Perhaps he had been a little careless and
  indifferent, perhaps he had been a little too anxious over that gold scratch
  medal.</p>

  <p>Who was the man? Chesney's eyes gleamed as he thought of it, his muscles
  grew rigid. Let him only meet the man face to face, and murder would be done.
  He racked his brain in thought, but could think of nobody, not even an old
  admirer of Betty's, to pick a quarrel with. With strange lack of logic, the
  discovery pleased and comforted him.</p>

  <p>He took from the safe the last of the anonymous letters. The other two he
  had destroyed. Ho had tossed them into the fire before the poison had begun
  to work. The third he had put aside with a possible view to consulting a
  solicitor on the matter. The words seemed to stand out from the paper like
  ripples of fire. This pitiful coward was telling the truth. In the safe was
  Betty's case of diamonds&mdash;the family diamonds worn by her on state
  occasions. Chesney always locked them in the safe when they ware not being
  worn. They had been there for a month now, he reflected. There wad agony in
  the thought that thay might never be worn by Betty again.</p>

  <p>How singularly quiet the house had grown. Everybody had gone to bed
  probably. The clock was striking twelve as a taxi-cab came purring up to the
  front door, and a latch- key rattled in the lock. Chesney could hear his wife
  as she crossed the hall; With a tightening at his throat, he hastened to meet
  her. It seemed to him that she fairly started as she saw the haggard
  whiteness of his face.</p>

  <p>"So you have. come; back," she stammered. She seemed, to be perplexed,
  annoyed about something. Chesney recollected that afterwards. For the moment
  he was puzzled. He had expected some shadow of guilt, but he could see none
  in that lovely face, with its dainty coloring and deep blue eyes clear as a
  pool.</p>

  <p>"You said you were going to the Malvains," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I intended to," Chesney explained. "But-I changed my mind. That's, not
  quite true, I forgot all about the Malvains and came back mechanically.
  Perhaps it is as well I did."</p>

  <p>Betty asked no further questions. She made no attempt to explain her
  absence from home. Chesney could see that she was quietly dressed, as if for
  some concert or theatre party. How bonny and winsome she looked, how like the
  Betty he remebered when... Still... What a fool he had been not to care for
  her better! If she was hard and unfeeling, her looks belied her sorely. And
  all the children that Chesney knew fairly worshipped her. That was supposed
  to be a good sign.</p>

  <p>"I think I'll, go to bed," Betty said.</p>

  <p>"Not quite yet," Chesney said, hoarsely. "A moment, please. It is not much
  of your time that I have claimed lately, Betty. Will you sit down."</p>

  <p>Betty dropped into a shair. Chesney could see that she was trembling. The
  rings on her hands shimmered and danced like streams of fire. Yet she looked
  him in the face&mdash;those deep blue eyes were as frank as those of a
  child.</p>

  <p>"If you have anything to say I am ready to listen, Ralph," she
  murmured.</p>

  <p>Chesney hesitated just for a moment. It was going to be far more difficult
  than he had anticipated. He always hated anything that suggested the bullying
  of women. And he wast just realising that he loved this particular woman
  perhaps a little more than he had ever loved her before. His heart was crying
  out for her. How easy it would be to sweep the whole crowd of doubt away, to
  start afresh&mdash;that was, if she still held any affection for him. But
  with that letter in his pocket he could not believe this. Besides, she had
  lied to him. Was she not just back from some disgraceful meeting with the man
  who ihad taken his place? And yet she did not look a bit like that. What
  actresses women were! So beautiful, so innocent, and yet so vile!</p>

  <p>"Where have you been this evening?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Is it really any business of yours, Ralph?" Betty asked. "Have I ever
  questioned you as to your movements? And when you adopt that tone of
  voice&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, Betty. Please make allowance for me. Try and put
  yourself in my place."</p>

  <p>"I have done that a good many times. Perhaps it is because I am a woman
  that I have failed."</p>

  <p>"Need we go into that?" Chesney asked. "I mean now. We were asked out to
  dinner. It is understood that we go on to another affair afterwards. You
  accepted on behalf of the pair of us. At the last moment you decline to come
  on the plea of a headache. It is absolutely certain that I am not likely to
  be back before two in the morning, so that I am out of the way. I leave you
  practically in bed. When I come back at midnight I find that you have been
  out for some hours. Where?"</p>

  <p>"And suppose I decline to answer question, Ralph?"</p>

  <p>Chesney shugged his shoulders; it seemed the proper thing to do.</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course, I can't force you to speak," he said bitterly. "In our
  walk of life I can't knock you down and jump on you. There is only one way
  for us."</p>

  <p>"And that is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"An understanding. Of course, there need not be any scandal. This house
  and the place in Surrey is large enough for the both of us, and, fortunately,
  there is no money question."</p>

  <p>"I see, Ralph. A separation in the same house. Outwardly friends so far as
  the world is concerned."</p>

  <p>"Precisely&mdash;after you have explained where you have been this
  evening."</p>

  <p>Betty flushed to the hair. There was a cruel pain at her heart, a mist of
  tears in her blue eyes. Still, she faced him bravely and steadily.</p>

  <p>"Ralph," she said, "Did it ever occur to you that I was lonely?"</p>

  <p>"Lonely!" Ohesney 'exclaimed. "Lonely! With all you wanted, any number of
  friends&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Any number of friends! How like a man you talk in that way! How many
  friends have you got? How many men that you could confide in and feel that
  they would do anything for you? Oh, I know what is at the back of your mind.
  Come, Ralph. You want a man in whose hands you are prepared to place your
  honor and the honor of your house. Out of all your shooting and golfing
  companions, give me the names of two. You cannot do it."</p>

  <p>Chesney stood there in silence, just a little disturbed and perplexed. And
  the odd thing was that all that Betty said was true. A little smiie flickered
  on her lips.</p>

  <p>"It is the same with me," she said. "I am lonely and neglected. Your golf
  is dearer to you than your wife. That's a bitter thing for a proud, sensitive
  woman to realise. And out of all my friends there is not one I can confide
  in, Ralph. Think of that."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell me?" the man asked, uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you ask? You would have seen plainly enough a year ago. It was
  no fault of mine that I was the only gdrl with six brothers who spoilt me.
  There was no amusement of theirs which I didn't share. Their pleasure was not
  complete without me., And when you came along1 they were jealous. It was a
  hard wrench to leave the old home, but I made it because I loved you, Ralph.
  And you were glad enough to have me for your companion at one time. You
  preferred me as your partner in a foursome to 'that ass Allison.' And now you
  are playing at Walton Heath and Sunningdale with 'that ass Allison' on four
  days a week. Do you remember telling me once that with a little coaching I
  should be in the running for the lady championship? Yet you go out of your
  way to play with Madge Lettington, to whom I used to give two strokes."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Betty," Chesney protested, "this is mere jealousy."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" Betty asked, unsteadily. "Perhaps so. It is an asset in my
  favour, anyway. It shows that the old affection is not dead, in spite of
  everything. Besides, it is hardly decent of you to reproach me with jealousy.
  What about yourself?"</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that I am jealous, Betty? Nonsense! You would find it
  difficult to prove."</p>

  <p>"Not at all. You were annoyed to find me out. You demanded to know where I
  had been. You told me quite plainly that there could be no question of any
  amiable arrangement between us unless I explained where I had been this
  evening. Is not that jealousy?"</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! It is a proper regard for my honour&mdash;for my good
  name."</p>

  <p>"We will take that for granted, Ralph. Why did you come home this evening?
  Did you guess that I should be out? Did you doubt my word? I am going to have
  an answer."</p>

  <p>Chesney flushed uncomfortably. The temptation to lie was terrible. If he
  told the truth he would have to confess that he had been impelled by that
  wretched anonymous letter. It was all very well to try and delude himself
  with the suggestion that he had come back more or less mechanically; but for
  that letter he would be elsewhere at this moment.</p>

  <p>"You have not been spying on my movements?" Betty asked.</p>

  <p>"The mere suggestion is an insult," Chesney cried, hotly. "Have I ever
  shown any signs of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you haven't, Ralph," Betty admitted. "I could have forgiven you more
  easily had you done so. But you haven't answered my question. Why did you
  come back to-night?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Betty, you have no right to take this high ground," Chesney
  protested. "Before we go any further I must know where you have been
  tonight."</p>

  <p>"That I will tell you in due course, Ralph. There is no occasion for an
  unseemly wrangle. If you answer my question first, I promise you to tell the
  truth afterwards."</p>

  <p>Chesney stood there staring helplessly into space. This was not at all as
  he had intended the interview to be. Still, he had thrown down the challenge,
  and he would not flinch from it. He snatched the letter from his pocket and
  laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>"That!" he said. "That is what brought me home. I did not want to
  come&mdash;heaven knows that I did not want to come. Some impulse that I
  could not resist brought me here. I came with a smile for my own weakness. I
  came&mdash;oh, hang it all! I came to prove the lie in that infernal letter.
  And I didn't prove the lie; I found that&mdash;but, here, read the thing for
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Betty read the letter sternly and thoughtfully. There was no flush on her
  face, no guilty start, and no suggestion of confusion. Her hands had beome
  quite steady again.</p>

  <p>"You are prepared to believe that this is a coincidence?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I would give five years of my life," Chesney said hoarsely, "to be
  certain of the fact."</p>

  <p>A dazzling smile, tender and melting, flashed over Betty's face. It was
  only just for a moment, then her lips trembled, and her eyes filled with
  tears.</p>

  <p>"We will come to that presently," she murmured. "Is this the first of
  these things you have received?"</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," Ralph confessed. "I have had three of them altogether. The
  first I tossed into the fire without a thought; the second worried me, but I
  managed to put it put of my mind. Tuhis accursed business is like
  brandy-drinking&mdash;it grows upon one. You can't keep clear of the poison
  altogether; You&mdash;you begin to ask yourself questions against your will.
  And when a man and his wife are&mdash;are not getting on very well together,
  you see&mdash; No doubt a good deal was my fault. And yet, when I come to
  look at you, Bet, a8 you ait there, I could kick myself
  for&mdash;for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I fancy I understand," Betty smiled. "Ralph, I know who wrote those
  letters."</p>

  <p>"You know who wrote the letters! If you could only prove it, Bet! I'd
  break every bone in his&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hers!" Betty corrected. "A woman wrote those letters. How long is it
  since I had the diamonds out?"</p>

  <p>"Since you had the diamonds out! My dear child, what's that to do with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Everything, as you will see presently, Ralph. Would you oblige me by
  unlocking the safe now. You know the key is never out of your possession.
  Take out my jewel-case and open the little secret drawer, at the bottom, and
  tell me what find there."</p>

  <p>Chesney complied wonderingly. From the drawer he took two letters sealed
  and addressed to himself. He saw, to his astonishment, that they were in the
  same hand as the anonymous letters.</p>

  <p>"Open them and read," Betty said. "They are addressed to you. You will
  find that they are more poisonous and atrocious than those you have already
  received."</p>

  <p>"They must have been there a month," Ralph cried. "You placed them there
  yourself. Who wrote them?"</p>

  <p>"I did," Betty said, calmly. "I wrote every line of them."</p>

  <p>"A comedy!" Chesney gasped. "A regular stage comedy. In the name of
  fortune, why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wanted to test you," Betty whispered. She rose from her seat
  and stood now with her hands quietly resting on her husband's shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I wanted to force your hand. I wanted to feel quite sure whether
  I had lost you or not. Three of the letters I kept by me to post, the others
  I placed in your custody so that I could prove my innocence if&mdash;if
  anything really dreadful happened. When you took no notice of the first
  letter I felt bad, but when you ignored the second I&mdash;I wanted to die,
  Ralph. If the third had failed I should have left you. I went out to-night on
  the chance that you might return, and you did. I have been down to the
  Convent with Sister Agnes for three hours. My dear boy, there never has been
  anybody but you, and there never will be. I can tell you this now because I
  am sure that it has been all a dreadful mistake, and because I know that I
  have never lost your love. I saw that in your eyes when I came in. You were
  stern and harsh and angry, but there was the pain and misery on your face,
  though you never knew it. And when you said just now that you would give five
  years of your life to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Chesney drew the trembling arm about his neck and kissed the red,
  quivering lips. He saw it all quite clearly now; there was not another word
  to be said. The tears were moist on Betty's cheeks, but these were tears of
  happiness, and her eyes were dim and sweet.</p>

  <p>"It was wonderful," Chesney said. "Wonderful. By gad! it was an idea that
  any novelist Johnny might be proud of. And all done between ourselves, and
  nobody any the wiser. You have taught me to value what I came very near to
  losing, Bet, and I'll never forget it. Just one moment, dear."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going to?" Betty asked.</p>

  <p>"To telephone to Allison at the club," Chesney explained. "He's sure to be
  there still. I want to let him know that Littlestone is off to-morrow. We'll
  go down to Sandwich, you and I, dear, and have a jolly happy week there. Oh,
  you darling!"</p><br>
