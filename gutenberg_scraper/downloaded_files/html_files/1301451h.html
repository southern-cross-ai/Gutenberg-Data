<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

<p class="first">The stories in this collection were originally
published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i> under the general title
<i>My Adventures as a German Spy in Britain</i>. They were
attributed to "Hermann Gallwitz, Agent of Captain Karl von
Rintellen, the Famous Banker-Spy" and were purportedly "Written
by Himself and Edited by Edgar Wallace." The series was
introduced with the words:</p>
<br>

<p class="first"><i>"This narrative of a German spy, who lived
and had his being in our midst, is based upon irrefutable facts,
which are offered to our readers for the first time. The series
is compiled from notes and memoranda which were made by Hermann
Gallwitz, an agent of Captain Karl von Rintellen, the mysterious
banker-spy who was arrested while travelling to Europe under the
name of "Von Gasche." Gallwitz never intended his private diary
to be published, and because of this our readers will have a much
better insight into the vain and conceited mind of the German
spy, who fondly believed that a British Secret Service did not
exist. For reasons which will be obvious fictitious names are
given, and codes, signals and identification systems have been
altered."</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">The stories themselves were illustrated with
photographs intended, evidently, to give them a tongue-in-cheek
semblance of being factual accounts. The series was subsequently
reprinted under syndication with the title changed to
<i>Adventures of a German Spy in Britain</i>. In the book edition
Hermann Gallwitz was renamed "Heine," and some of the stories
were abridged or otherwise edited.</p>

<h2><a id="story1" name="story1">1. &mdash; ALEXANDER AND THE
LADY</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Jan 19, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">SECRET SERVICE work is a joke in peace time and
it is paid on joke rates. People talk of the fabulous sums of
money which our Government spend on this kind of work, and I have
no doubt a very large sum was spent every year, but it had to go
a long way. Even Herr Kressler, of the Bremen-America Line, who
gave me my monthly cheque, used to nod and wink when he handed
over my two hundred marks.</p>

<p>"Ah, my good Heine," he would say, stroking his stubbly beard,
"they make a fool of me, the Government, but I suppose I mustn't
ask who is your other paymaster?"</p>

<p>"Herr Kessler," said I earnestly, "I assure you that this is
the whole sum I receive from the Government."</p>

<p>"So!" he would say and shake his head: "Ah, you are close
fellows, and I mustn't ask questions!"</p>

<p>There was little to do save now and again to keep track of
some of the bad men, the extreme Socialists, and the fellows who
ran away from Germany to avoid military service. I often wished
there were more, because it would have been possible to have made
a little on one's expenses. Fortunately, two or three of the very
big men in New York and Chicago knew the work I was doing, and
credited me with a much larger income than I possessed. The
reputation of. being well off is a very useful one, and in my
case brought me all sorts of commissions and little tips which I
could profitably exploit on Wall Street, and in one way or
another I lived comfortably, had a nice apartment on Riverside
Drive, backed horses, and enjoyed an occasional trip to
Washington, at my Government's expense.</p>

<p>I first knew that war was likely to break out in July. I think
we Germans understood the European situation much better than the
English and certainly much better than the Americans, and we knew
that the event at Sarajevo&mdash;by the way, poor Klein of our
service and an old colleague of mine, was killed by the bomb
which was intended for the Archduke, though nobody seems to have
noticed the fact&mdash;would produce the war which Austria had
been expecting or seeking an excuse to wage for two years.</p>

<p>If I remember aright, the assassination was committed on the
Sunday morning. The New York papers published the story on that
day, and on the Monday afternoon I was summoned to Washington,
and saw the Secretary, who was in charge of our Department on the
Tuesday evening after dinner.</p>

<p>The Secretary was very grave and told me that war was almost
certain, and that Austria was determined to settle with Serbia
for good, but that it was feared that Russia would come in and
that the war could not be localised because, if Russia made war,
Germany and France would also be involved.</p>

<p>Personally, I have never liked the French, and my French is
not particularly good. I was hoping that he was going to tell us
that England was concerned and I asked him if this was not the
case. To my disappointment, he told me that England would
certainly not fight, that she would remain neutral, and that
strict orders had been issued that nothing was to be done which
would in any way annoy the English.</p>

<p>"Their army," he said, "is beneath contempt, but their navy is
the most powerful in the world and its employment might have very
serious consequences."</p>

<p>It seemed very early to talk about war with the newspapers
still full of long descriptions of the Sarajevo murder and the
removal of the Archduke's body and I remembered after with what
astounding assurance our Secretary had spoken.</p>

<p>I must confess I was disappointed, because I had spent a very
long time in England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, establishing
touch with good friends who, I felt, would work with advantage
for me in the event of war. I had prepared my way by founding The
Chinese News Bureau, a little concern that had an office in Fleet
Street and was ostensibly engaged in collecting items of news
concerning China and distributing them to the London and
provincial press, and in forwarding a London letter to certain
journals in Pekin, Tientsien and Shanghai.</p>

<p>Of course, the money was found by the Department, and it was
not a financial success, but it was a good start in case one ever
had to operate in London, since I was registered as a naturalised
Chilean and it was extremely unlikely that Chile would be at war
with any European Power.</p>

<p>On the 3rd August, 1914, I received a message from Washington
in the Departmental code, telling me that war with England was
inevitable and that I was to sail on the first boat and take up
my duties in London in full control of the British
Department.</p>

<p>I was overjoyed with the news and I know that men like
Stohwasser, Wesser, and other men of my Department, looked at me
with envy. They did not think they had an easy task because the
American Secret Service is a very competent one; but they thought
I was a lucky pig&mdash;as indeed I was&mdash;to be operating in
a country containing a population of forty millions, most of
whom, as one of their writers said, were fools.</p>

<p>I landed at Liverpool on August 11th. My passport was in order
and I immediately went forward to London. There was no trace of
any excitement. I saw a lot of soldiers on their way to their
depots; and arriving in London, I immediately received the
reports of our innumerable agents.</p>

<p>With what pride did I contemplate the splendid smoothness of
our system! When the Emperor pressed the button marked
"Mobilise," he called, in addition to his soldiers, a thousand
gallant hearts and brilliant minds in a score of countries all
eager and happy to work for the aggrandisement of our beloved
Fatherland.</p>

<p>Six of us met at a fashionable restaurant near Trafalgar
Square. There were Emil Stein who called himself Robinson, Karl
Besser&mdash;I need not give all their aliases&mdash;Heine von
Wetzl, Fritz von Kahn and Alexander Koos.</p>

<p>Stein had arrived from Holland the night before and Fritz von
Kahn had come down from Glasgow where he had been acting as a
hotel porter. These men were, as I say, known to me, and to one
another, but there were thousands of unknowns who had their
secret instructions, which were only to be opened in case of war
and with whom we had to get in touch.</p>

<p>I briefly explained the procedure and the method by which our
agents would be identified. Every German agent would prove his
<i>bona fides</i> by producing three used postage stamps of
Nicaragua. It is a simple method of identification, for there is
nothing treasonable or suspicious in a man carrying about in his
pocket-book, a ten, twenty or a fifty centime stamp of a neutral
country.</p>

<p>I sent Emil Stein away to Portsmouth and instructed him to
make contact with sailors of the Fleet especially with officers.
Besser was dispatched to a West Coast shipping centre to report
on all the boats which left and entered. I sent Kahn and his
family on a motor-car tour to the East Coast with instructions to
find out what new coast defences were being instituted.</p>

<p>"You must exercise the greatest care," I said; "even though
these English are very stupid, they may easily blunder into a
discovery. Make the briefest notes on all you see and hear and
only use the Number 3 code in case of urgent necessity." We
finished our dinner and we drank to "The Day" and sang under our
breath "<i>Deutschland über Alles</i>" and separated, Koos coming
with me.</p>

<p>Koos was a staff officer of the Imperial Service, and though
he was not noble he was held in the greatest respect. He was a
fine, handsome fellow, very popular with the girls, and typically
British in appearance. His English was as good as mine, and that
is saying a great deal. I sent him to Woolwich because in his
character as an American inventor&mdash;he had spent four years
in the States&mdash;he was admirably fitted to pick up such facts
as were of the greatest interest to the Government.</p>

<p>I did not see Koos for a few days and in the meantime I was
very busy arranging with my couriers who were to carry the result
of our discoveries through a neutral country to Germany. The
system I adopted was a very simple one. My notes, written in
Indian ink, were separately photographed by means of a camera.
When I had finished the twelve exposures, I opened the camera in
a dark room, carefully re-rolled the spool and sealed it, so that
it had the appearance of being an unexposed pellicle. I argued
that whilst the English military authorities would confiscate
photographs which had obviously been taken, they might pass films
which were apparently unused.</p>

<p>I had arranged to meet Koos on the night of August 17th, and
made my way to the rendezvous, engaging a table for two. I had
hardly seated myself when, to my surprise, Koos came in
accompanied by a very pretty English girl. He walked past me,
merely giving me the slightest side-glance, and seated himself
at the next table. I was amused. I knew the weakness of our good
Koos for the ladies, but I knew also that he was an excellent
investigator and that he was probably combining business with
pleasure. In this I was right. The meal finished&mdash;and the
innocent laughter of the girl made me smile again&mdash;and Koos
walked out with the girl on his arm.</p>

<p>As he passed my table he dropped a slip of paper which I
covered with my table-napkin. When I was sure I was not observed,
I read the note.</p>

<p>"Making excellent progress. Meet me at a quarter to eleven
outside Piccadilly Tube."</p>

<p>I met him at the appointed time and we strolled into Jermyn
Street.</p>

<p>"What do you think of her?" was Koos' first question.</p>

<p>"Very pretty, my friend," said I. "You have excellent
taste."</p>

<p>He chuckled.</p>

<p>"I have also excellent luck, my dear Heine. That lady is the
daughter of one of the chief gun-constructors at Woolwich."</p>

<p>He looked at me to note the effect of his words, and I must
confess I was startled.</p>

<p>"Splendid, my dear fellow! " said I, warmly. "How did you come
to meet her?"</p>

<p>"A little act of gallantry," he said airily; "a lady walking
on Blackheath twists her ankle, what more natural than that I
should offer her assistance to the nearest seat? Quite a babbling
little person&mdash;typically English. She is a mine of
information. An only daughter and a little spoilt, I am afraid,
she knows no doubt secrets of construction of which the technical
experts of the Government are ignorant. Can you imagine a German
talking over military affairs with his daughter?"</p>

<p>"What have you learnt from her?" I asked.</p>

<p>Koos did not reply for a moment, then he said: "So far, very
little. I am, naturally, anxious not to alarm her or arouse her
suspicions. She is willing to talk and she has access to her
father's study and, from what I gather, she practically keeps all
the keys of the house. At present I am educating her to the
necessity of preserving secrecy about our friendship and to do
her justice, she is just as anxious that our clandestine meetings
should not come to the ears of her father as I am."</p>

<p>We walked along in silence.</p>

<p>"This may be a very big thing," I said.</p>

<p>"Bigger than you imagine," replied Alexander; "there is
certain to be an exchange of confidential views about artillery
between the Allies, and though we have nothing to learn from the
English it is possible that the French may send orders to
Woolwich for armament. In that case our little friend may be a
mine of information. I am working with my eyes a few months
ahead," he said, " and for that reason I am allowing our
friendship to develop slowly."</p>

<p>I did not see Koos again for a week, except that I caught a
glimpse of him in the Cafe Riche with his fair companion. He did
not see me, however, and as it was desirable that I should not
intrude, I made no attempt to make my presence apparent.</p>

<p>At the end of the week we met by appointment, which we
arranged through the agony column of a certain London newspaper.
I was feeling very cheerful, for Stein, Besser, and Kahn had sent
in most excellent reports, and it only needed Alexander's
encouraging news to complete my sum of happiness.</p>

<p>"You remember the gun-lathe I spoke to you about," he said.
"My friend&mdash;you may regard the blue prints as in your
hands."</p>

<p>"How has this come about?"</p>

<p>"I just casually mentioned to my little girl that I was
interested in inventions and that I had just put a new lathe upon
the market in America and she was quite excited about it. She
asked me if I heard about the lathe at Woolwich, and I said that
I had heard rumours that there was such a lathe. She was quite
overjoyed at the opportunity of giving me information and asked
me whether in the event of her showing me the prints I would keep
the fact a great secret because," he laughed softly, "she did not
think her father would like the print to leave his office!"</p>

<p>"You must be careful of this girl," I said, "she may be
detected."</p>

<p>"There is no danger, my dear fellow," said Alexander. "She is
the shrewdest little woman in the world. I am getting quite to
like her if one can like these abominable people&mdash;she is
such a child!"</p>

<p>I told him to keep in communication with me and sent him off
feeling what the English call in "good form." I dispatched a
courier by the morning train to the Continent, giving details of
the British Expeditionary Force. Only two brigades were in
France&mdash;and that after three weeks of preparation! In
Germany every man was mobilized and at his corps or army
headquarters weeks ago&mdash;every regiment had moved up to its
order of battle position. Two brigades! It would be amusing if it
were not pathetic!</p>

<p>Besser came to me soon after lunch in a very excited
state.</p>

<p>"The whole of the British Expeditionary Force of three
Divisions is in France," he said, "and, what is more, it is in
line."</p>

<p>I smiled at him.</p>

<p>"My poor dear fellow, who has been pulling your foot?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"It is confidentially communicated to the Press, and will he
public to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>"Lies," said I calmly, "you are too credulous. The English are
the most stupid liars in the world."</p>

<p>I was not so calm that night when I ran down in my car to
Gorselton, where our very good friend, the Baron von
Hertz-Missenger, had a nice little estate.</p>

<p>"Heine," he said, after he had taken me to his study and shut
the door. "I have received a radio through my wireless from the
<i>Kriegsministerium</i> [The Prussian Ministry of War] to the
effect that the whole of the British Expeditionary Force has
landed and is in line."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Herr Baron," I said, but he shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;our Intelligence in Belgium is infallible.
Now, I do not want to interfere with you, for I am but a humble
volunteer in this great work, but I advise you to give a little
more attention to the army. We may have underrated the military
assistance which Britain can offer."</p>

<p>"The English Army, Herr Baron," said I firmly, "is almost as
insignificant a factor as&mdash;as well&mdash;the American army,
which only exists on paper! Nevertheless, I will take your
advice."</p>

<p>I went back to town and dispatched another courier, for as yet
the Torpington Varnish Factory (about which I will tell you
later) had not been equipped with radio.</p>

<p>That night I again saw Alexander. It was at supper at the
Fritz, and he looked a fine figure of a man. I felt proud of the
country which could produce such a type. Where, I ask you,
amongst the paunchy English and the scraggy Scotch, with their
hairy knees and their sheep-shank legs, could you find a
counterpart of that <i>beau sabreur</i>? Cower treacherous
Albion, shiver in your kilt, hateful Scotch (it is not generally
known that the Royal and High-Born Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria is
rightful King of Scotland), tremble, wild Wales, and unreliable
Ireland, when you come in arms against a land which can produce
such men as Alexander Koos!</p>

<p>I never saw a girl look more radiantly happy than did the
young woman who was sitting vis-a-vis my friend. There was a
light in her eye and a colour in her cheeks which were eloquent
of her joy.</p>

<p>I saw Alexander afterwards. He came secretly to my room.</p>

<p>"Have you brought the blue print?" I asked. He shook his head
smilingly. "Tomorrow, my friend, not only the blue print of the
lathe, not only the new gun-mounting model, but the lady herself
will come to me. I want your permission to leave the day after
to-morrow for home. I cannot afford to wait for what the future
may bring."</p>

<p>"Can you smuggle the plans past the English police?" I asked,
a little relieved that he had volunteered to act as courier on so
dangerous a mission.</p>

<p>"Nothing easier."</p>

<p>"And the girl&mdash;have you her passport?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"How far shall you take her?"</p>

<p>"To Rotterdam," he said promptly.</p>

<p>In a way I was sorry. Yes, I am sentimental, I fear, and
"sentiment does not live in an agent's pocket" as the saying
goes. I wish it could have been done without. I shrugged my
shoulders and steeled my soul with the thought that she was
English and that it was all for the Fatherland.</p>

<p>"You must come to the Cafe Riche tonight and witness our
going," said Alexander; "you will observe that she will carry a
leather case such as schoolgirls use for their books and
exercises. In that, case, my friend, will be enough material to
keep our friends in Berlin busy for a month."</p>

<p>I took leave of him giving him certain instructions as to the
course he was to take after reporting at Headquarters, and spent
the rest of the night coding a message for our Alexander to carry
with him. The hour at which Alexander was to meet the girl was
eight o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>His table (already booked) was No. 47, which is near the
window facing Piccadilly. I telephoned through to the cafe and
booked No. 46, for I was anxious to witness the comedy.</p>

<p>All was now moving like clockwork&mdash;and let me say that
the smoothness of the arrangements was due largely to the very
thorough and painstaking organisation-work which I had carried
out in the piping days of peace. We Germans have a passion for
detail and for thoroughness and for this reason (apart from the
inherent qualities of simplicity and honesty, apart from the
superiority of our kultur and our lofty idealism) we have been
unconquerable throughout the ages.</p>

<p>You must remember that I was in London as the representative
of a Chinese News Bureau. I was also an agent for a firm of
importers in Shanghai. It was therefore only natural that I
should be called up all hours of the day and night with offers of
goods.</p>

<p>"I can let you have a hundred and twenty bales of Manchester
goods at 125."</p>

<p>Now 120 and 125 added together make 245, and turning to my
"simple code", to paragraph 245, I find the following:</p>

<p>"2nd Battalion of the Graniteshire Regiment entrained to-day
for embarkation."</p>

<p>The minor agents carried this code (containing 1,400 simple
sentences to cover all naval or military movements) in a small
volume. The code is printed on one side of very thin paper
leaves, and the leaves are as porous and absorbent as blotting
paper.</p>

<p>One blot of ink dropped upon a sheet will obliterate a
dozen&mdash;a fact which our careless agents have discovered.
Clipped in the centre of the book (as a pencil is clipped in an
ordinary book) is a tiny tube of the thinnest glass containing a
quantity of black dye-stuff. The agent fearing detection has only
to press the cover of the book sharply and the contents of the
book are reduced to black sodden pulp. Need I say that this
ingenious invention was German in its origin.</p>

<p>[As a matter of fact, it was invented by the American Secret
Service&mdash; E.W.]</p>

<p>My days were therefore very full. There came reports from all
quarters and some the most unlikely. How, you may ask, did our
agents make these discoveries?</p>

<p>There are many ways by which information is conveyed. The
relations of soldiers are always willing to talk about their men
and will tell you, if they know, when they are leaving, the ships
they are leaving by, and will sometimes give you other important
facts, but particularly about ports and dates of embarkations are
they useful.</p>

<p>Also officers will occasionally talk at lunch and dinner and
will tell their women folk military secrets which a waiter can
mentally note and convey to the proper quarters. Our best agents,
however, were barbers, tailors, chiropodists, and dentists.
English people will always discuss matters with a barber or with
the man who is fitting them with their clothes, and as almost
every tailor was making military uniforms and a very large number
of the tailors in London were either German or Austrian, I had
quite a wealth of news.</p>

<p>Tailors are useful because they work to time. Clothes have to
be delivered by a certain date and generally the man who has the
suit made will tell the fitter the date he expects to leave
England. Other useful investigators are Turkish-bath attendants
and dentists. A man in a dentist's chair is always nervous and
will try to make friends with the surgeon who is operating on
him.</p>

<p>Of all agencies the waiter is in reality the least useful,
because writers have been pointing out for so many years the fact
that most waiters were German. But the truth is that most
restaurant waiters are Italian, and it is amongst the bedroom
waiters that you can find a preponderance of my fellow
countrymen.</p>

<p>Prompt at eight o'clock, I took my place at the table and
ordered an excellent dinner (my waiter was naturally a good
German) and a bottle of Rhenish wine. A few minutes after I had
given my order Alexander and the girl arrived. She was dressed in
a long travelling coat of tussore silk, and carried&mdash;as I
was careful to note&mdash;a shiny brown leather portfolio. This
she placed carefully on her lap when she sat down and raised her
veil.</p>

<p>She looked a little pale, but smiled readily enough at
Alexander's jests. I watched her as she slowly peeled off her
gloves and unbuttoned her coat. Her eyes were fixed on vacancy.
Doubtless her conscience was pricking her.</p>

<p>Is it the thought of thy home, little maid, from whence thou
hast fled never to return? Is it the anguished picture of thy
broken-hearted and ruined father bemoaning his daughter and his
honour? Have no fear, little one, thy treason shall enrich the
chosen of the German God, those World Encirclers, Foreordained
and Destined to Imperial Grandeur!</p>

<p>So I thought, watching her and listening.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that everything will be all right?" she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Please trust me," smiled Alexander. (Oh, the deceiving
rogue&mdash;how I admired his sang-froid!)</p>

<p>"You are ready to go&mdash;you have packed?" she asked.</p>

<p>"As ready as you, my dear Elsie. Come&mdash;let me question
you," he bantered; "have you all those wonderful plans which are
going to make our fortunes after we are married?</p>

<p>So he had promised that&mdash;what would the gracious Frau
Koos-Mettleheim have said to this perfidy on the part of her
husband?</p>

<p>"I have all the plans," she began, but he hushed her with a
warning glance.</p>

<p>I watched the dinner proceed but heard very little more. All
the time she seemed to be plying him with anxious questions to
which he returned reassuring answers. They had reached the sweets
when she began to fumble at her pocket. I guessed (rightly) that
she was seeking a handkerchief and (wrongly) that she was
crying.</p>

<p>Her search was fruitless and she beckoned the waiter.</p>

<p>"I left a little bag in the ladies' room&mdash;it has my
handkerchief; will you ask the attendant to send the bag?"</p>

<p>The waiter departed and presently returned with two men in the
livery of the hotel. I was sitting side by side and could see the
faces both of the girl and Alexander and I noticed the amusement
in his face that two attendants must come to carry one small
bag.</p>

<p>Then I heard the girl speak.</p>

<p>"Put your hands, palms upward, on the table," she said I was
still looking at Alexander's face. First amazement and then anger
showed&mdash;then I saw his face go grey and into his eyes crept
the fear of death. The girl was holding an automatic pistol and
the barrel was pointing at Alexander's breast. She half turned
her head to the attendants.</p>

<p>"Here is your man, sergeant," she said briskly. "Alexander Roos,
alias Ralph Burton-Smith. I charge him with espionage."</p>

<p>They snapped the steel handcuffs upon Alexander's wrists and
led him out, the girl following. I rose unsteadily and followed.
In the vestibule was quite a small crowd which had gathered at
the first rumour of so remarkable a sensation. Here, for the
first time, Alexander spoke, and it was curious how in his
agitation his perfect English became broken and hoarse.</p>

<p>"Who are you? You have a mistake maken, my frient."</p>

<p>"I am an officer of the British Intelligence Department," said
the girl.</p>

<p>"<i>Himmel</i>! Secret Service!" gasped Alexander, "I thought
it was not!"</p>

<p>I saw them take him away and stole home.</p>

<p>They had trapped him. The girl with the sprained ankle had
been waiting for him that day on Blackheath. She led him on by
talking of the plans she could get until he had told her of the
rough plans he already had. Whilst (as he thought) he was
tightening the net about her, she was drawing the meshes tighter
about him&hellip; Phew! It makes me hot to think of it!</p>

<p>Was there a secret service in England after all? For myself,
my tracks were too well covered; for Alexander I could do
nothing. He would not betray me. I was sure of that. Yet to be
perfectly certain I left the next night for Dundee, and I was in
Dundee when the news came that Alexander had been shot in the
Tower of London.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story2" name="story2">2. &mdash; THE MAN WHO DWELT ON
A HILL</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Jan 26, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN I left London hurriedly, after the arrest
of Alexander Koos, I must confess that my mind was greatly
disturbed. I sat half the night in my sleeper, turning over all
the circumstances leading up to the arrest of my good friend. We
Germans are the most logical people in the world. We argue with
precision from known facts, and we deduce from those facts such
subtle conclusions as naturally flow.</p>

<p>We do not indulge in frivolous speculations&mdash;we Germans
are a serious people with a passion for accurate data.</p>

<p>Thus I argued: (1) if a secret police force had been
established it is a post-war creation. Otherwise our general
staff would have known of its existence and have advised us. (2)
Supposing a secret service had been initiated where would its
agents be found? Naturally in the vicinity of the great arsenals
and military camps. Under these circumstances it was not
surprising that Koos, confining his investigations to Woolwich,
had been brought into contact with a member this new
organisation. (3) It was humanly impossible that the operations
of an improvised secret service could be extended in a few days
to areas other than military and arsenal areas. Therefore it
behoved the investigator to avoid as far as possible arousing
suspicion by pursuing his inquiries in the neighbourhood of
arsenals and camps.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning I was taking my breakfast in
the station-buffet at Edinburgh. Von Kahn was awaiting me, and
over the meal, served by a sleepy waitress, I had an opportunity of
retailing the events which had led to my hasty departure from
London. Von Kahn stroked his moustache thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Koos was an impetuous man," he said. "I am not surprised that
he has been detected. You must not forget, my dear Heine, that we
Germans have only one thought, only one goal, the welfare of the
Fatherland. Koos allowed his penchant for feminine society to
overcome his judgment. That is a mistake which should never
make."</p>

<p>I looked at our good Von Kahn, with his big red face and his
short, well-fed body, and I could not help thinking that it would
be indeed a remarkable circumstance if he allowed himself to be
lured to destruction in such a manner.</p>

<p>He joined the train and went on with me to Dundee. We had not
gone far from the station before the train stopped and an
attendant came in and pulled down all the blinds, removing, in
spite of our protest, all our baggage, which he locked in an
empty compartment.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, sir," said the man "but those are my
orders."</p>

<p>For a moment I had a cold feeling inside me that I was
suspected, but his next words reassured me.</p>

<p>"We do it to everybody, sir, before we cross the&mdash;&mdash;
Bridge."</p>

<p>When he had gone I turned to von Kahn. "This is an
extraordinary thing," I said. "I never suspected the English of
taking such intelligent precautions."</p>

<p>Von Kahn laughed.</p>

<p>"The English here are Scots," he said, "and they are very
cautious."</p>

<p>I should have dearly liked to peep out when the rumble of the
wheels told we were passing the famous bridge, but in the
corridor outside the carriage discovered, to my amazement, a
Scottish soldier with fixed bayonet, and for some reason or other
his eyes never left us.</p>

<p>It was not until we were a very long way past the bridge that
the attendant returned my bag and suit-case and pulled up the
blind, and not until we reached Dundee that I discussed the
matter at with von Kahn.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe he said, "that we have passed a
portion of the British Fleet, and it will be my endeavour during
the next few days to discover what units are at present in the
region of Rosyth."</p>

<p>He told me this in the cab on the way to our hotel and he also
gave me a great of deal of information about the East Coast
defences which it had been his business to investigate.</p>

<p>"It is practically impossible to get near the important parts
of the coast," he said, "and I think you must give up all idea of
establishing light-signal stations at X and Q."</p>

<p>This was a sad disappointment to me, which I did not attempt
to bide.</p>

<p>"My dear von Kahn," I said testily, "you are getting
hypnotised by the English. You are giving them credit for gifts
which are not theirs. You are imagining that these people, these
Scots for example, have the same keen national sense of suspicion
as we Germans possess."</p>

<p>We drove the rest of the journey to an hotel in silence. I
registered here in the name by which I was known to the Chilean
Legation. I had never been in Dundee before and I hope I may
never see the town again, for reasons which will be sufficiently
obvious to all the good friends who read my narrative.</p>

<p>My local agent here was a barber named Schmidt, and the first
thing I did on my arrival at the hotel was to send for a barber!
What was more natural than that a weary traveller should require
shaving! Ah! do not smile, my friends! By such acts of
forethought and detail was our great service built up and
wonderfully established. Our good friend came with his little
black bag and was admitted to my room. The honest fellow was
almost overcome by the sight of one whom he regarded as being a
veritable link between himself and his "Supreme War Lord".</p>

<p>"It is beautiful to be able to speak our noble German tongue
again," he said; "think of it, Herr Heine! Here I am week in and
week out talking Scotch&mdash;not even English."</p>

<p>He had much to tell me that I committed to memory. He even had
had the good fortune to be called in professionally to an admiral
who was passing through Dundee on the way to a certain town in
the north.</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Schmidt "I was extremely tactful and
suspicion-avoiding. But, Herr Heine, not even the high officers
of State know discretion. Reticence is not!"</p>

<p>"I wish you'd take me with you, Sir Jones," I said; he was
well-born and had been created a Sir for war knowledge."</p>

<p>"Come along," said Sir Jones, "but I'm afraid you will not be
comfortable when our fleet goes into action next week against
Heligoland."</p>

<p>"That is a strong fortress, Admiral, I said."</p>

<p>"We have been undermining it for a month," said Sir Jones.</p>

<p>"Herr Heine I nearly fainted with excitement. Consider the
position. Here was I, a faithful servant of the Fatherland
listening to one of the most important military secrets from an
Excellency of the English Navy. I kept my blood cool and went on
lathering without a tremble of hand. "'That must have been
terribly difficult Sir Jones,' I said. 'Not at all,' said Sir
Jones; 'we have a new submarine on wheels that creeps along the
bed of the ocean and fortunately there are beneath Heligoland
several very large caves in which our divers can store
explosives. I trust you will regard all I have told you as
confidential!'"</p>

<p>By the time Schmidt had finished I was on my feet. I knew that
there had been a secret vote or appropriation for the British
Navy a year before. So this was the reason. "Send Herr von Kahn
to me, you will find him in Room 84," I said; and long before my
companion had arrived I was working at my codes.</p>

<p>"We must find a way to get this information to Germany," I
said.</p>

<p>"The way is simple," said he; "the <i>Sven Gustavus</i> is in
harbour waiting to clear for Bergen. She has wireless, and
outside of the territorial waters she can get into touch with the
Bremen wireless station."</p>

<p>The message I sent was a large code, and I have since learnt
that it created something like a sensation at the Admiralty. All
the warships in the vicinity of Heligoland were ordered away, the
Corps of Divers came from Cuxhaven and the foundations of the
island were thoroughly explored, although the Admiralty Marine
Survey Department was emphatic on the point that no caverns
existed under the island. As a matter of fact none were
discovered, though a certain suspicious-looking hole was found in
one of the rocks.</p>

<p>[This is not an extravagant story of German credulity but is
based upon the fact. The more improbable a story was at the
beginning of the war, particularly in regard to the British Navy,
the more eagerly did the German Admiralty swallow it.&mdash;
E.W.]</p>

<p>We stopped at the top of the hill and von Kahn pointed out the
shooting-box which stood on the crest of the farther rise&mdash;a
little white building.</p>

<p>"Our Mr. Brown is at home," he said and pointed to the flag, a
yellow flag with a red lion in the centre, the same being the
secret standard of Scotland, which is always flown in defiance of
the English, whose banner is the Union Jack. We had discussed our
plans thoroughly the night before because, obviously, nothing
could be left to the last, and it would have been extremely
dangerous to have talked in the presence of the chauffer of our
hired car.</p>

<p>I have always made it a point to have no dealings with anybody
outside our own service, and I had arranged with von Kahn to
undertake all negotiations with this stranger. I said good-bye to
my friend and wished him good luck, and I watched him as he
descended a steep footpath and walked along the little road that
led to the farther hill.</p>

<p>I sent the chauffeur back to the main road, telling him to
rejoin me at noon, and profitably spent the time of waiting by
exploring ground and coding a message on the Swiss incident, for
transmission to Germany. Through my glasses I could watch from
time to time the progress of my comrade. I saw him climb the
hill and stand before the door of the cottage, and presently a
man came out! They talked together for about ten minutes and then
they both disappeared into the interior.</p>

<p>It was not until half ten that von Kahn made his appearance
again. I saw him shake hands with his host and wave his hand
cheerily and three-quarters of an hour later he rejoined me on
the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked. There was no need to ask von Kahn. His eyes
were gleaming with triumph.</p>

<p>"I can only say," said he, "that our Mr. Brown is a remarkable
man."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"He speaks German, he reads German, and he is German," said
von Kahn emphatically, "he has a library of all the German
classics. I discovered that when he was out of the room. His
flag-post obviously supports a wireless aerial in the night-time,
and although he is bland and uncommunicative, I have no
doubt whatever about his character. He is one of the Higher
Service."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"Did he give you any hint&mdash;?" I began.</p>

<p>"Not a word," said von Kahn emphatically: "he speaks splendid
English, is well acquainted with Australia, and pretends that he
is a wealthy pleasure-seeker with no other interest than fishing
and shooting."</p>

<p>"I hope you were tactful," I said suddenly. Von Kahn
smiled.</p>

<p>"My dear Heine," he said, "you need have no apprehension. I
whistled a certain little tune you know, and he finished it
without hesitation. He is not only in the Higher Service, but he
stands very high in the Higher Service."</p>

<p>To make absolutely sure, we returned that night, and in
company with von Kahn I crossed the valley and climbed the hill.
I was half-way up the hill when I heard a familiar sound. If you
can imagine the rattling of dried peas in a tin canister shaken
at irregular intervals, you know the sound that wireless makes,
and that a wireless message was being tapped from the cottage on
the hill there was no doubt. More than this, the unknown Mr.
Brown had taken elaborate precautions to avoid detection. We
climbed the hill a little higher and suddenly my foot caught an
obstruction. I flashed my electric lamp down and saw that I had
snapped a tiny wire.</p>

<p>Instantly the "clickety-click" of the wireless ceased. There
was a stealthy footstep at the top of the hill and I guessed that
the aerial was being taken down, and that it would be stowed and
hidden, together with the instruments, long before any intruder
could reach the cottage.</p>

<p>"Go up now," I whispered to Kahn; "go quickly and reveal
yourself."</p>

<p>I handed him the message I had coded and which I had brought
with me.</p>

<p>"Give him your official number, show him your credentials and
ask the illustrious gentleman to send this message through."</p>

<p>Kahn took the massage without a word and began the ascent. I
watched him, not moving from my position and presently I heard
him challenged sharply.</p>

<p>"It is I," said von Kahn's voice and, like the bold fellow
that he was, he spoke in German. Some one replied in the same
language. There was a brief exchange of question and answer and
the three&mdash;the Swiss valet was evidently
present&mdash;disappeared into the cottage, and a few minutes
later I saw the red glow of a light from the windows.</p>

<p>I was sorely tempted to creep up and listen. After all, there
was no reason why von Kahn alone should have an opportunity of
greeting this well-born gentleman who might be in a position to
speak a favourable word in the highest quarters regarding myself.
Then again, I was not sure that von Kahn would fulfil his mission
to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>I determined to risk it, and keeping as much in the shadow as
possible, and feeling gingerly for other wire signals, I made my
way to the little platform upon which the cottage stood. We had
specially put on rubber-soled shoes for the night's work, and I
moved noiselessly. The door was closed, but there was no
difficulty in discovering the room to which von Kahn had been
taken. I crept nearer to the window. The two men were talking and
laughing and, thank heaven their speech was in German.</p>

<p>"But how do I know," I heard Mr, Brown say, "that you are not
a member of the British Secret Service?"</p>

<p>"For the matter of that," said von Kahn jovially, "how am I to
know that your Excellency is not also of that phantom body?"</p>

<p>And they both laughed together. I heard the clink of a bottle
on a glass and two hearty "<i>Prosits</i>," and then Mr, Brown
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Now what can I do for you? I suppose you know that you ought
not to have come anywhere near me? How did you find me out? Was
it the ever-to-be-condemned tune I whistled?"</p>

<p>Von Kahn chuckled. "I have known about you for a long time,"
he said, "and as I am in need of help I thought I would take the
bull by the horns and seek this interview."</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>"Quite alone," said von Kahn promptly.</p>

<p>"I mean, were you alone in making the discovery?"</p>

<p>"Quite alone," said von Kahn again.</p>

<p>"Then you are a remarkably shrewd fellow," laughed Brown.</p>

<p>I can tell you it made my blood boil to hear this swine-hound
taking all the credit for this discovery. Little he know that I
was standing outside the window listening to his immodest
perfidy! Could he not have said, "No, Excellency, the credit is
due entirely to my respected chief whose name I am forbidden to
mention I am merely an instrument in a superior hand?" Oh, no!
His vanity and deceit he must take full kudos to himself. Would
he go any further?</p>

<p>Almost as I framed this question he spoke. "I would ask your
Excellency," he said, "if you ever refer to this meeting to the
illustrious Chief of Naval Intelligence that you will give him a
testimonial."</p>

<p>I could hardly restrain myself. For one second it was in my
mind to rap sharply at the window and denounce this underling.
But, fortunately, I restrained myself, though I was boiling with
rage. We Germans have a keen sense of justice and are inherently,
almost transparently, honest, and nothing distresses us, so
angers us, as duplicity and ingratitude.</p>

<p>"But surely," said Mr. Brown's voice, "you did not come alone
to-night?"</p>

<p>I waited. Just as I had been anxious far von Kahn to give me
full credit, so was I now anxious to hear him deny my presence. I
do not know what it was that brought this revulsion of feeling,
whether it was something in the tone of Mr Brown or some
instinctive flash of knowledge that all was not well, but I
sweated as I stood waiting for the answer which seemed an
eternity in coming, though in reality it was only a second or
so.</p>

<p>"No, I assure you, Herr Brown," said von Kahn, "I came
alone."</p>

<p>"That makes matters simple," said Brown's voice, and as he
spoke the light went out. I heard von Kahn shout, but his voice
was instantly muffled. There was a struggle, a thud that seemed to
shake the little building, a groan and then silence.</p>

<p>I had my automatic pistol in my hand in a second.</p>

<p>Should I go to his rescue and take the risk of capture or
should I leave him to his fate? It was a terrible decision I was
called upon to make. We Germans do not shrink from our
responsibilities nor are we governed by the foolish
sentimentality which dictates the actions of the commoner tribes.
I made my way down the hill with great rapidity You may say that I
was leaving a comrade to his fate, but I answer that when one cog
of a wheel breaks off do the other cogs disintegrate themselves
in sympathy. We were part of a great machine von Kahn and I, and
my action, if it needed such justification, was justified in the
events which followed.</p>

<p>I was within fifty yards of the narrow road which winds along
the base of the hill when I thought I heard a sound before me and
I stopped, flattened myself on the ground between two bushes, and
listened. There was no doubt that I had reason for my suspicions.
I heard, not one stealthy footfall, but a dozen, and peering up,
I saw against the artificial sky-line which I had created by
lowering myself to the earth half a dozen shadowy figures. The
nearest was ten yards away and my heart came to my throat when I
saw a gleam of light upon the tunic of a policeman.</p>

<p>They were police, undoubtedly, and they were making their way
up the hill such a manner as led me to believe that the hill
itself was practically surrounded. I watched holding my breath.
The first of the figures passed two yards away, the second on my
right less than a yard. I waited until they were well up the hill
before I moved, and then I wriggled forward with the utmost
caution for I thought it was possible that they had left a guard
on the road. This view proved to be correct as I had not got far
before I saw a man pacing the roadway.</p>

<p>Fortunately his beat was long and I was able to gain the road
and cross it.</p>

<p>I found myself in a field of cabbages. Here again luck was with
me, for running two sides of the field was a deep ditch. Into
this I sank and with great labour reached the opposite hill, on
the top of which, hidden in a small copse, were the two
motor-bicycles which had brought us on our night adventure.</p>

<p>Here again German forethought saved me from what might have
been destruction. Von Kahn had suggested we should have the
chauffeur and the car we had in the morning, but as I pointed
out, this would have aroused suspicion and so instead we had
hired two motor bicycles, not from the town in which we were
staying, but one five miles farther along the line from whence we
had set forth upon our quest.</p>

<p>Nearby by the copse, as I had seen earlier in the day, was a
disused quarry overgrown with vegetation. Swiftly I wheeled
Kahn's bicycle to the edge and flung it over. It would remain
undiscovered for at least a few days, and possibly for ever,
unless a search was made.</p>

<p>To leap upon the other motor-cycle and to go flying down the
road was the work of a few minutes. I confess I was agitated and
nervous. Who was the mysterious man who lived at the top of the
hill? How did he know we were coming that night and was so sure
of the hour that he could surround his house with policemen to
trap us? Why had he assaulted my friend when he and his servant
could have overcome him or have held him at the point of a
revolver until the police arrived?</p>

<p>My position was a precarious one. Von Kahn had been seen with
me in Dundee and obviously my business was to make myself scarce.
It was half past eleven that night when I rode up to the cycle
dealer's in X &mdash;, and knocked at the door. The town was
asleep and the street deserted, but the man had been expecting
our return and was waiting up.</p>

<p>He looked surprised at my muddy appearance and more surprised
at the absence of my companion. I apologized to him, and told him
that my friend had been called away to London and had ridden down
to a station on the main line. I think he was most surprised when
I offered to buy the cycle I was using and also to buy that of
von Kahn. I told him that I had taken a liking to the machine and
that von Kahn had similarly expressed a wish to retain his. The
price he fixed was a fairly moderate one&mdash;we had already
paid a large deposit&mdash;and I concluded the bargain there and
then.</p>

<p>I was anxious, of course, to finish this business of the
motor-cycles in order that I should not set on foot independent
inquiries as to their whereabouts, inquiries which would
certainly have identified me with von Kahn. Taking on a supply of
petrol and trimming my lamp, I set out for Dundee, arriving at my
hotel a little after four o'clock in the morning. After some
difficulty I aroused the night porter, a sleepy old man whose
name, I remembered, was Angus, and went to my room, packed my
small valise and, awaiting my opportunity, stole out of the
hotel, strapped my bag to the carrier of the bicycle, and rode
through the drear, menacing streets of Dundee for the last
time.</p>

<p>Twenty miles out of Dundee all trace of the mysterious person
who had disappeared from big hotel leaving a £5 note to cover his
bill and a polite request that his letters should be forwarded to
the Majestic Hotel, London, vanished. A cool young Englishman
joined an early morning train to Edinburgh at an intermediate
station, and certainly that cool young Englishman in his grey
tweeds and his eye-glass bore no resemblance to the muddy cyclist
in soiled overalls who had crossed the river at Perth and had
excited the attention of a certain mounted constable.</p>

<p>That cool young Englishman, perfect in every detail, might
have been seen leaving the Central Station at Glasgow that same
afternoon not only accompanied by his valise but by a large
portmanteau which he had taken from the cloak-room at the station
and which with characteristic German foresight he had caused to
be forwarded to Glasgow on the night he left London for Dundee.</p>

<p>I had communicated with London by telephone. Nothing had been
heard of von Kahn but the whole of my service in England was now
on the <i>qui vive</i>. Posser, one of my assistants, was on his
way to Glasgow to confer with me, and half a dozen agents in that
town were busy investigating the mystery of the man on the
hill.</p>

<p>I was sitting at dinner that night in one of the fashionable
restaurants of Glasgow, a restaurant approached through a
magnificent marble vestibule, searching the latest edition of the
papers, hoping for two lines which would give me a clue to von
Kahn's fate, when a staring headline met my eye and I
gasped.</p><br>

<p class="headline">SWISS FORGERS<br> SENSATIONAL ARRESTS AT GLEN
MACINTYRE</p><br>

<p class="quote">"The Sheriff's Court at Stirling was crowded
to-day when Emil Zimmerwald, alias Brown, a Swiss, Louis Swart,
Swiss, and Heinrich Kahn, also described as a Swiss, were
remanded on a charge of forging Swiss bank notes. Inspector
Macguire, of the Stirling Constabulary, stated that the prisoner
Zimmwald, who called himself Brown, rented a cottage at Glen
Macintyre, Swart posing as his valet. The two men were well-known
international forgers, and had been engaged in printing a very
large number of Swiss banknotes. The attention of the police had
first been attracted to the house owing to the noise of working
of the small printing machine which the prisoners used for their
nefarious purpose. On raiding the premises the prisoner Kahn was
discovered in a dazed condition. There had evidently been a
quarrel and. Kahn had been struck. The prisoner Zimmerwald made a
rambling statement to the effect that Kahn was a detective who
had been sent to arrest him, but this highly improbable story
will be investigated by the sheriff at a later sitting. The man
Kahn resolutely refuses to make any statement at all."</p><br>

<p>My poor von Kahn! Thou shalt go down in Scottish history as a
confederate of forgers and shall spend many years in that grim
penitentiary at Perth, pleading guilty to a crime abhorrent to
thee, lest the confession of thy true crime lead thee to a firing
party in the chilly dawn!</p> <hr> <br>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,

<p class="first">IN America, where the German and Austro-Hungarian
population is so much larger than in any other foreign
country, the work of my department is split up into three
sections. There is a naval, a military, and a commercial branch,
each under an expert controlling a distinct organization which
could, however, be co-ordinated in the event of war. In the
United Kingdom there was no separation of interests, and the root
organization, that which I controlled covered, after the outbreak
of the war, all three departments.</p>

<p>And let me say here for the information of my good friends who
may perhaps imagine I am boasting, that when I describe myself as
"controlling" the organization, I may inadvertently deceive. The
exact position was that I had organized my department, dug the
channels through which would flow the streams or rivulets of
information; that I myself had been in the position of the
central reservoir which collected and refined and transmitted the
information so received. It does not necessarily mean that
because I was the architect that I was necessarily the tenant of
the fabric which I had created.</p>

<p>All the time in the first few months of the War there were
great comings and goings. Men arrived from Germany, from America,
from Switzerland, Sweden, and Holland, with forged passports,
each charged with a distinct and separate mission. Lody, whose
name you may have heard, came in the guise of a tourist agent,
having certain definite discoveries to make and certain
propaganda to forward. Other men came from America on similar
missions. Some of these were gentlemen of the very highest
character who were not associated with me in any way, but
nevertheless sought me out in order to secure my assistance for
the development of their plans. Of their adventures I know
little. Whether they returned to Germany or not I am unable to
say. Some got away and some were caught, but in what manner I
never knew.</p>

<p>I was loth to believe, and, indeed, did not believe, that a
Secret Service existed in Britain. There were, of course,
detectives and plain clothes policemen, whose task it was to
watch railway and steamship arrivals, but obviously it was
impossible in the space of a few weeks to create such a bureau as
exists in the Wilhelmstrasse, or that over which Captain von
Treutchen presides with such distinguished success in the
Admiralty Buildings.</p>

<p>In November 1914, I received orders direct from
Berlin&mdash;the first I had ever received&mdash;telling me that
I must devote myself entirely to industrial propaganda. I was
informed that the sum of £12,000 had been placed to my credit in
the West London and Birmingham Bank and I was told to make my
headquarters at Manchester in the capacity of buyer for a
well-known firm of Chilean importers with whom my chiefs had a
working arrangement.</p>

<p>I arrived at Manchester late one misty afternoon and made my
way to the best hotel, where rooms had been reserved for me. I
went to the desk and registered, and upon seeing my name the
clerk informed me that two gentlemen were waiting for me in the
palm court.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you want to see them, sir," he said; "I
think they are commercial travellers."</p>

<p>"I will see them in my room, if you will be good enough to
send them up,"' said I, and five minutes later the "commercial
travellers" were shown in to me, and introduced themselves as
representatives of the Incorporated Carolina Cotton fields
Company.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am rather tired tonight," said I; " but as you
seem in a hurry to do business I will compare your
quotations."</p>

<p>When the door had shut upon the waiter who had shown them in
we got to business. One, of course, was my friend Posser, and the
other was young Klein, one of those brilliant children of the
Fatherland who had been in the service of the department ever
since he left Heidelberg.</p>

<p>"We are ordered to place ourselves at your disposal, Herr
Heine," said Klein, "and we have been here two days investigating
the conditions."</p>

<p>"Are they favourable?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Extremely so," said Posser; "but you will have an opportunity
of judging for yourself."</p>

<p>We exchanged experiences, and half an hour later I rang the
bell for the waiter and my visitors were shown out. After I had
dined I left the hotel for the rendezvous I had made outside the
post-office. It was now raining heavily, and I would like to have
taken a taxi, but Klein suggested that we should make our way on
foot to our destination, which proved to be a very small hall in
some unsavoury part of Manchester. It was a dilapidated building,
the entrance door being flush with the street and had the
appearance of being a mission hall dedicated to one of those dour
and unhappy sects which find a virtue in the very dreariness of
their environment.</p>

<p>Two nights a week it was used for religious services, but on
the other nights it was let out to whomsoever cared to hire the
place. On this occasion some sort of Labour meeting seemed to be
in progress and a small bill attached to an inner baize door
leading to the hall itself announced an address by Mr. William
Craigmair on "Labour and the War."</p>

<p>The hall was sparsely filled and I do not suppose there were
more than fifty people present when we walked in and took our
seats. The man who was speaking was of the usual demagogic type,
loud-mouthed, illogical, full of bitter jibes at Capitalism,
which he said was the cause of the war and at the bottom of the
whole European crisis. Klein nudged me.</p>

<p>"Imagine this in Berlin!" he whispered. I nodded. It was
indeed pathetic, and only shows how wholly inefficient the
English police service is that it allowed such men to be at
large. I sat through the tirade, a little bored if the truth be
told, because this was to be the least interesting part of the
evening. After the meeting was over Klein told us to go over and
wait for him, and presently he rejoined us accompanied by a man
whom I recognized as the speaker, Mr Craigmair. He introduced us
as sympathizers with the cause of Labour, and I congratulated
this gaunt Englishman upon his "wonderful rhetoric," though worse
balderdash I had never heard in my life.</p>

<p>The man's harsh arrogance melted under this well-directed
stream of Teutonic flattery and he became almost human in the
glow of our admiration.</p>

<p>"I am much obliged to you, gents," he said, grinning;
"speakin' impartially, I can say it wasn't a bad speech for a
self-taught man. Any Sunday afternoon you happen to be in
Finsbury Park you will find me there addressing the
proletariat."</p>

<p>"Finsbury Park? " said I.</p>

<p>"Do you come from London?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the man. "Our comrade here," he nodded to Klein,
"persuaded me to go round delivering a few addresses to the
working classes. I've got a lot of friends in this part of the
world," he went on, " and you mustn't judge me on the audience I
got to-night. I am addressin' the Junior Operatives' League
to-morrow and then you will see an audience if you like."</p>

<p>I murmured my intention of being present, expressed my
sympathy with the Labour movement, and invited him to meet me at
lunch on the following day.</p>

<p>When we had parted Klein told me that he had first heard the
man addressing meetings in London, either at Finsbury or in Hyde
Park.</p>

<p>"He was such a fanatic, and he had, moreover, such a
convincing way that I thought we might find him useful. I know
you think what he says is nonsense," Klein went on, addressing
me; "but what is illogical to us is sound sense to the common
workman. To-morrow's meeting, for example, is of the greatest
importance to us. The Junior Operatives have threatened to strike
against the advice of their Trade Union, and as they have a
working arrangement with the Carters' Union, a strike would be of
the utmost importance. Whilst I do not expect we can do very much
in the early stages of the war to bring about a general stoppage
of labour, we can embarrass the Government, and who knows how
these little labour troubles may develop!"</p>

<p>I quite agreed with Klein, who is a psychologist of a very
high order, in addition to being well born, his mother being a
Frenheim-Hazebrucken, and his sister being married to Graf von
Metzenheim, an illustrious gentleman with who I once had the
honour of taking wine.</p>

<p>Mr. Craigmair came to lunch the next day. In order not to
excite attention I arranged with him to meet me at Lytham, and
there we spoke frankly and freely. I told him how intensely
interested we all were in the Labour movement. I pointed out that
this war might be brought to an end if some great leader arose
from the people and seized his opportunity.</p>

<p>"For, Mr. Craigmair," said I, "what is war but a negation of
all law? Is it better that a few miserable capitalists and statesmen
should be chagrined, or that thousands of human lives should be
sacrificed in the red-hot pit of battle? Is it not better that
these money-grabbers should be ruined than that innocent people
who have no concern in the war and have no hatred towards any nation
should be compelled to walk into the shambles like dumb beasts?
If they tell you that it is not patriotic to attempt to stop a
war, even though you may be acting contrary to the maddened
sentiments of the majority of the people, you answer that there
is no such thing as patriotism, that we owe our chief duty to
humanity which knows no frontier and no language. For what is
there more precious in the soil of England than in the soil of
Germany or of France? Do they not equally produce wheat and
sustain life? Has any one a more precious value than another?
Does one handful of red earth contain a magic quality which is
not possessed equally by a handful of any other kind of earth?
Patriotism is the shibboleth of the capitalist and the ambitious
statesman, my friend, and he who opposes his will to that hateful
creed is doing magnificent work for mankind."</p>

<p>I spoke in this vein and I could see that Mr. Craigmair was
impressed. He made little notes with the stub of a pencil upon what
looked like a laundry-book, interrupting my remarks with uncouth
sounds of admiration and approval.</p>

<p>I gave him £50, as a mark of my interest in his work.</p>

<p>"And on the day you bring the people out on strike I will give
you another £50," I said; "not because I am anxious to promote
industrial discord, but because war is against my principles as a
hateful and an unnecessary evil."</p>

<p>I went back to my hotel feeling that I had done a good day's
work. I did not attend the meeting of the Junior Operatives, but
I am told that it was very enthusiastic and that by an
overwhelming majority the men and the women members had decided
to strike, and had received a promise of support from the
transport workers.</p>

<p>My interest in the Labour movement was momentarily diverted
that same day by the receipt of a message from London&mdash;it
was brought by courier on the afternoon train. The message was an
important one, and it had been received by radio direct from
Potsdam, and had been decoded in London and transmitted to me for
report.</p>

<p>News had reached Berlin that the firm of Pollygay &amp; Moxon,
a chemical firm on the outskirts of Manchester, were engaged in
conducting secret experiments with a new bomb. The news had
reached Berlin from a very reliable source, I believe that it had
been mentioned after dinner at a well-known Bohemian club in
London by an under-secretary in a certain Government department.
He had spoken rather boastfully of "something" very deadly which
the Government were experimenting with, and our agent, who was
one of the party to whom this was told, discovered, by a
well-timed display of scepticism that the experiments were being
conducted by Pollygay &amp; Moxon, and had sent forward the
information which, had I been in London, must have gone through
me.</p>

<p>I put Klein on to the job immediately, and he called in the
assistance of Craigmair who apparently was in touch with workmen
in most of the big factories, and fortunately numbered among his
acquaintances a wretched German named Bluer, who was employed in
the laboratories of the firm. As a matter of fact, we did not
know of the existence of Bluer, a dour, taciturn man of the
hateful socialistic type who had no patriotism, no love for his
Fatherland, and was tainted with poisonous internationalism.</p>

<p>This renegade, living in England, with excellent opportunity
for serving the Fatherland, had never put himself into touch with
the superior authorities, nor had he offered the slightest
assistance to the officers of State, and it was only by accident
that we discovered his existence. However, his internationalism
served one good purpose. Though he might earn his livelihood by
preparing deadly weapons for the destruction of his
fellow-countrymen, he was in theory an opponent of war, and Mr.
Craigmair, after a while, enlisted his sympathies and introduced
him to Klein, who said he was an author engaged in writing a book
painting war in its most horrible aspects. He also told him that
he was compiling as long and as formidable a list of deadly
weapons as he could secure.</p>

<p>"And when I have finished, my friend," said Klein, "we shall
have the most damning indictment of warfare that the world has
ever seen."</p>

<p>This interested Bluer and it was not long before he told of
the secret experiments which had been conducted on the firm's
private range with the new hand grenade.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is made," said Bluer, "because that is
not in my department, and all the chemical experiments have been
in the hands of the head chemist, but my brother-in-law is a
night watchman and has the entry to the records office and I
daresay I could give you a rough idea of what it's like."</p>

<p>I was overjoyed to hear this news, the more so since I had
received another, and even more urgent, message from
Headquarters, telling me to spare no expense or pains to secure a
specification. I now come to the remarkable part of this
narrative, one which I cannot tell without a little shudder.</p>

<p>Bluer and his relative certainly made an attempt to locate the
specifications and drawings. I will do this un-German Teuton (to
whom Klein was eventually compelled to reveal something of his
designs) the credit of saying that he tried his best&mdash;but
for a week he and his relative were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The manager was a gentleman named Tyson, or Tynson, a
good-looking man of about twenty-eight. Naturally, I had set my
people to work to find out all the particulars about every member
of the firm, and it was reported to me that Tyson had been
frequently seen in the company of a very beautiful lady, named Miss
Harrymore.</p>

<p>I put my own men on to discover something about Miss
Harrymore, and found that she was a stranger to Manchester, that
she had only arrived a month previous to my appearance on the
scene; and that she occupied a small house which she had taken
furnished in the most fashionable suburb of the Lancashire
city.</p>

<p>She had come from London and almost immediately had made
friends with the manager. They used to dine occasionally and they
went to the theatre together once a week, but there was no
evidence that the friendship was a very warm one. Miss Harrymore
had been a dancer; but apparently had retired from the
stage&mdash;at least that was the story which her maid told
Posser, who investigated the matter.</p>

<p>I smoked many cigars over this friendship and formed certain
conclusions, especially after I had learnt that on the nights Mr.
Tyson was working late this lady had driven down to the factory
in her car, had spent some little time in the manager's office,
and had driven that gentleman to supper.</p>

<p>I have already told you of my disbelief in the existence of a
secret service in England, but I had modified that view after the
experience of my poor friend Koos, who was brought to an untimely
end through the artfulness of a chit of a girl.</p>

<p>Naturally I was suspicious of beautiful ladies who were on
terms of furtive friendship with Government officials&mdash;and
to all intents and purposes Tyson was a Government
official&mdash;and I kept my eyes "skinned," as they say in
England.</p>

<p>The business of the bomb was worrying me more than I cared to
confess to my assistants. A third message had come through from
Berlin, even more urgent than the last, and one paragraph of that
message considerably disturbed me. It ran: "Whilst we expect you
to secure these plans we are leaving nothing to chance. We hope,
however, that the credit for securing them will fall to you."</p>

<p>I understood this significant passage. It meant that Berlin
was sending independent agents to England to try their luck, and
I was determined to justify myself in the eyes of the Fatherland.
I sent for Posser and Klein to come to my room and I outlined my
views and gave my final instructions. Posser gave me encouraging
news. He told me that Bluer had secured some information of the
greatest importance. It appears that the Government had sent in a
rough drawing of the bomb, and that one of the engineers was
coming next night to make the drawing and a copy of the secret
specification, and that the original was kept in a safe in the
records office.</p>

<p>The combination safe opened to the word "Track" and the
specification would be found in No. 3 drawer, the lock of which
could be picked. So far, so good, but the situation was still
desperate. It was as clear as daylight; that my chief difficulty
was going to be, not to circumvent the manager, but to get past
the guard which the secret service had set up. It was then a
struggle between Miss Harrymore and Heine. Very well, Heine picks
up the gauntlet with a clear mind and a high confidence in his
German genius.</p>

<p>Klein saw Bluer on the following afternoon and an unexpected
difficulty arose. Bluer, if you please, had discovered a
conscience! This renegade, this traitor to the Fatherland, this
dirty Swabian refused to go any further in the matter!</p>

<p>"The English have always treated me well," he told Klein; "My
children have been born in the country and I have friends here. I
cannot help you any more, Herr Klein. I should not only be a
traitor to the English, but a traitor to the
<i>Internationale</i>, if I betrayed my employers. You have the
combination word&mdash;I can do no more."</p>

<p>"If you refuse your help," said Klein, who was by now filled
with holy annoyance, "you are a traitor to your Kaiser and to
your Fatherland." Klein threatened and argued, pleaded and raved,
but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>"I have told you where you will find the specifications," said
Bluer doggedly; "you have a plan of the factory&mdash;which is
not guarded&mdash;and you know the way to the records room. In
telling you this I have done more than I ought to have done. If
you threaten me any more I will go for the police and tell them
all I know."</p>

<p>Ingrate! Rascal! Black swine of Württemberg! I paced my room
cursing the villain, and Klein stood by in respectful silence, as
I "let off steam," as the British say. However, I soon mastered
my rage and sat down to evolve a plan. We Germans can meet all
contingencies and adapt our minds to any difficulty which may
arise. I drew out the plan of the factory and soon Klein and I
were deep in the discussion of the alternative scheme.</p>

<p>The factory was a straggling collection of buildings, enclosed
on three sides by high walls and on the fourth by a canal,
alongside of which ran a double-track railway siding. There were
three gates and two small wickets, none of which were practical
for our purpose, since there would be a night watchman at each,
and, moreover, the records office was a fairly long distance from
all. This squat building adjoined the main warehouse near the
canal-siding and obviously it was from the canal that we must
make our entrance. We had learnt that the wharf was patrolled by
a watchman who had a little hut at the northern end of the quay,
to which it was his habit to retire between eleven and twelve at
night to make his coffee or tea, or whatever refreshment he
favoured, and we decided that this should be the hour for our
attempt.</p>

<p>Our plan was to paddle down the canal in a small collapsible
canoe (an advertisement of which Klein had seen), wait our
opportunity and land. With Klein's equipment of keys and
instruments we should have no difficulty in forcing an entrance,
and the rest would be easy.</p>

<p>When we had agreed upon our scheme, Klein went off to Chester
to purchase the boat, whilst I elaborated my plan for conveying
the specifications to Germany.</p>

<p>I was working away at this all the afternoon, telephoning to
certain garages, arranging routes and rendezvous, and reporting
points, newspaper advertisement codes, etc., and had almost
finished my organization work when the waiter brought me a card.
I took the paste-board from the salver and as I read the name I
felt myself grow pale. It was &mdash;</p>

<p class="cp"><span class="smcap">Miss Angela
Harrymore.</span></p><br>

<p>"Show the lady up," I said. As soon as the waiter was gone, I
took my Browning from my pocket, examined it and slipped its bank
barrel under my left armpit, the butt concealed by the fold of my
coat. Only thus can a danger-waiting man be sure that he has his
pistol ready for use.</p>

<p>The door opened and I rose to meet the lady. She was, as far
as I could judge, about twenty-six years of age. She was tall and
willowy, and perfectly gowned in some blue stuff which admirably
suited her fair complexion. About her neck and shoulders was a
Chinchilla wrap which I valued at £250, and beneath the white kid
gloves of one hand I saw the bulge of many rings. Her features
were regular and aristocratic, her eyes blue and steadfast, her
hair of pale gold. She was a type one meets as frequently in
England as in Northern Germany or Denmark. In fine, the first
impression I had was that she was of my own race, an impression
helped very cleverly by her greeting.</p>

<p>"Good day, Herr Cannelli," she said (Cannelli being the name I
traded under) and she spoke in faultless German.</p>

<p>But, O gracious lady, Heine was on guard!</p>

<p>At all times, I think, I am clever and alert; at some times I
may be a little too clever, but never am I caught napping. I
frowned, smiled, and shook my head.</p>

<p>"You are speaking German, are you not? " I asked in English,
"I am afraid I do not speak that language."</p>

<p>It was her turn to smile. "Come, come!" she rallied me, "you
are not going to pretend with me," and she laid two slim fingers
on her chin, the old sign&mdash;the pre-war sign&mdash;by which
one recognizes a member of the Admiralty Secret Service.</p>

<p>Aha! Gracious lady, thought, would you try an old trick upon
an old wolf! Do you not know that all the spy-revealing signs and
make-knowing signs had been changed on the outbreak of war? On
me, on Heine will you try these subterfuges!</p>

<p>"I do not speak your language, madam," I said, shaking my head;
"<i>¿Habla usted español?</i>"</p>

<p>I saw a shade of disappointment dim for a moment the
brightness of her eyes, then she laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't know why I thought you spoke German," she said coolly
and speaking in perfect English; "but somehow you reminded me of
a man I once knew in New York&mdash;a gentleman called by his
friends 'Heine.'"</p>

<p>She was watching me closely, but I never so much as
blinked.</p>

<p>"I am indeed fortunate, madame, even to resemble one whom you
have remembered," I said; "but I have never been to New York
except on one occasion, and then only for a few hours."</p>

<p>"Then I'm sorry to have bothered you," she smiled, and her
smile was a radiance.</p>

<p>"I saw you at dinner the other night and I was almost sure
that you were the friend of other days who had sung '<i>Es stehen
unbeweglich</i>....'"</p>

<p>I could have laughed! Again the old song and the old "code of
recognition"&mdash;a code which had been changed for six
months.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," I said gently, "I have never sung in my
life." She was baffled and showed signs of distress. She stood
biting her lips and frowning into the fire until, recovering her
self-possession, she smiled, shrugged her shoulders and offered
me her hand.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you must think I am very stupid," she said
frankly, "but I could have sworn I knew you."</p>

<p>I took her hand and conducted her to the corridor and to the
lift, and summoned Posser. Briefly I retailed all that had
happened.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about it at all," said Posser; "she came to
trap you. We must get out of Manchester to-night, and we must
take with us the specifications."</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock that night we slipped down the canal, Klein
at the bow and myself at the stern. Fortunately it was a dark
night, with a thin fog, and we moved silently and unchallenged to
our destination.</p>

<p>Klein had made a very careful survey of the wharf and he
guided the canoe to one of the big supporting piles up which ran
a steel-runged ladder.</p>

<p>Klein made a reconnaissance. Looking along the wharf, we could
see the little glass-windowed hut and the night-watchman standing
before a small fire evidently boiling his kettle. We tied the
canoe to the ladder and moved noiselessly across the wharf.</p>

<p>The factory was in darkness, but we had no difficulty in
discovering the record office, a small, dark building thrown out
as an annexe to the main machinery warehouse. To open the outer
door was the work of a few seconds. We entered, closed the door,
and found ourselves in a little wooden vestibule from
which opened yet another door. To my surprise the inner door was
not locked but still ajar.</p>

<p>Down the centre of the building ran a corridor and from this
various doors led to offices. Our objective was the last on the
left and quietly we crept forward and reached the door. I gently
turned the handle in order to secure a grip and was inserting my
skeleton key when I felt the door give. All my nerves were on
edge. Things were going much too easy and I pulled my gun and
slipped down the safety catch. Now, as I pushed the door gently
open I could have sworn I saw the faint reflection of a light,
such a reflection as you would expect from the varnished
matchboard-lining to the office, if some person had incautiously
shown a light for a second. I hesitated on the threshold. The
office was in darkness. There was no sound, no sign, and I
thought that the light I saw must have been reflection from one
of the street lamps on the other side of the canal, until I
remembered that the fog was quite thick enough to veil any of the
outside lights. I stepped forward cautiously towards the safe,
felt for it and found the handle, and had replaced my pistol in
my jacket pocket and was feeling for my electric lamp, when Klein
whispered fiercely in my ear:</p>

<p>"There's someone in the room."</p>

<p>Almost as he spoke, we heard a quick rustle and swish, and a
figure dimly seen flashed across the room and through the door.
At that moment I felt the safe door swing back in my grasp, and I
realized that we had come too late.</p>

<p>I was out of the office in a trice, flashed my lamp along the
corridor, and caught just a glimpse of a woman's figure as it
disappeared through the other end. She sped across the yard, we
behind her, and disappeared in the gloom. There was no time to
search for her. We had to consider ourselves. We scurried down
the ladder and I heard the hoarse challenge of the watchman. By
this time we were in mid-stream and paddling furiously. It was
too dangerous to keep to the canal and at the first opportunity
we found a landing place and reached a street, an ill-favoured,
dingy slum, which suited our purpose very well.</p>

<p>Ten minutes rapid walking brought us to one of the main
thoroughfares where we found a taxi-cab, and in the brief space
of time between this discovery an our arrival at the hotel, I
gave my instructions to Klein.</p>

<p>"She is evidently a member of the secret police," I said,
"and she got to know that we were after the specifications to-night
and forestalled us. I think Manchester is a little too hot
for you and me, Klein, and we will fade away."</p>

<p>We dismissed the cab at the hotel and walked into the
brightly-lighted vestibule, and came face to face with Miss
Harrymore! There was no doubt in my mind. There she stood, her
face flushed with triumph. I could see the mud on her shoes, I
recognized the fur-edged coat, and I realized my danger: She
probably had a motor-boat waiting for her and had taken the
short-cut back to the hotel in time to confront and denounce
us.</p>

<p>In that moment all the latent genius of our race came to the
surface. We Germans make our decisions quickly, boldly. With such
rapidity did I act that I even surprised myself. Extending my
forefinger I pointed at Miss Harrymore, "This woman," I said; "is
a German spy. She has in her possession certain specifications
and plans of a new and secret weapon."</p>

<p>I said this in a loud voice and a quiet-looking man who had
been sitting reading dropped his paper and springing up edged his
way through the little crowd which had collected about us. I saw
the girl go pale. I knew that she could not betray herself as a
secret agent and that, found in possession of the plans, she would
not be able to explain how she came by them.</p>

<p>The quiet-looking man moved to her side and caught her
arm.</p>

<p>"I am Inspector Lovell, of the Manchester Detective
Department," he said, "and on this gentleman's accusation I shall
take you to the Central Police Station."</p>

<p>He told us to follow, and led Miss Harrymore out of the hotel.
I gave a sign to Klein, and we followed, but not to the station.
Our big Mercedes was waiting round the corner and dawn found me
in London, so changed in appearance that I doubt if the admirable
Inspector Lovell would have recognized the man who had trapped
Miss Harrymore.</p>

<p>So far this comedy goes and now comes the tragedy. I found in
London, waiting for me, a code message from Berlin.</p>

<p>"Reference Pollygay bomb. Fraulein von Liebmann of the Secret
Service is in Manchester under the name of Miss Harrymore. She
has love affair with manager and reports she can secure
specifications. Assist her all you can. Instruct her in new
code."</p>

<p>It was signed by the High Chief of the Admiralty Intelligence.
For an hour I was prostrate and then I coded my reply to
Admiralty, Potsdam.</p>

<p>"In spite of my efforts, Fraulein von Liebmann arrested in
possession of specifications, which she carried against my
wishes."</p>

<p>I think it was an admirable explanation. As for the fraulein,
it will be many years before she will be able to supply her
personal narrative!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story4" name="story4">4. &mdash; THE AFFAIR OF MISTER
HAYNES</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Feb 9, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">IN February, 1915, there occurred an event which
I cannot pretend did not give me a certain amount of
satisfaction, tragic and ever-to-be regretted as that event
proved. I had constantly urged both upon the naval and military
Intelligence Departments in Berlin that the work in England
should be left entirely in my hands, and that I should not be
badgered or embarrassed by amateurs being sent to operate in my
territory, independent of my control and very often without my
being acquainted with their presence or purpose.</p>

<p>The event I refer to was the arrest of Herr Blaumberg, who was
sent from America without my knowledge to secure an accurate list
&mdash; "accurate"&mdash; mark you!&mdash;of the warships which
the British were laying down, especially in reference to the
super-X battleships which were destined to prove Mr. Churchill's
happiest experiment.</p>

<p>Herr Blaumberg had no sooner landed than he was arrested. I
received an inquiry from Wilhelmstrasse which was the first
information I had of Herr Blaumberg's foolish attempt to meddle
in matters which he obviously did not understand. The second
intimation was the official notice in the English papers: "This
morning a man tried and convicted of espionage at the Central
Criminal Court, was executed in the Tower of London."</p>

<p>I was in London when the news came, firmly established in my
role of Chilean importer and so well did I play my part that
I had secured certain little Government orders and was even
assisted by Government officials, all unknowing, you may be sure,
to the pursuit of my investigations.</p>

<p>It was on the very day that I read this doleful news of Herr
Blaumberg's sad end that I made the acquaintance of Mister
Haynes. I saw him standing on the corner of Bouverie and Fleet
streets&mdash;a tall, young, unshaven man, wearing
<i>pince-nez</i>, and a very shabby suit. With one quick,
comprehensive glance I sized him up. The bundle of various
coloured pencils and the fountain-pen in his left-hand waistcoat
pocket, the absence of watch and chain, the hat carelessly
balanced on the back of his head, the hands thrust into his
trousers pockets, the drooping cigarette, and the listless eyes
which watched the traffic passing up and down, told me as plainly
as though his biography had been handed to me, all the history I
wished to know. His linen was not clean, his collar was two or
three days old, his boots were down at heel. With that decision
which has always marked my actions I walked up to him with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I think I have met you before, have I not? " I said.</p>

<p>He turned his head and looked at me from the crown of my hat
to the soles of my boots.</p>

<p>"I daresay," he said.</p>

<p>"Come on and have a drink," said I briskly, and he obeyed with
alacrity.</p>

<p>We turned into the private bar of a public-house, ordered our
drinks and withdrew to a little round table and a couple of
chairs in a corner of the saloon bar.</p>

<p>"I don't remember your name," said I, "but I know you are a
newspaper man and if I remember rightly you have not had a great
deal of luck lately?"</p>

<p>"You have a good memory," he said, "and if mine was as good I
could tell you your name, your age, the place of your birth and
the state of your banking account, but, unfortunately, my memory
is a little groggy."</p>

<p>He lifted his drink with a shaking hand. I saw the whole
story.</p>

<p>He was what is commonly called in England, a "liner," or a
free-lance a man not attached to any newspaper but contributing
whatever stories, interviews or articles that come his way. They
are not so common in Fleet Street as they used to be when I first
came to London. The great news agencies have killed them. The new
system of journalism has passed them by. But occasionally you
meet a man with that hungry, hard-up look, with a grievance
against the world, and a pretty taste in whisky-and-soda, and
this was such a one.</p>

<p>Under the genial influence of a second drink he confirmed my
diagnosis. He had a grievance against all the papers and admitted
that he was on the black-list of three or four for sending in
contributions which were not exactly true. I asked him why he had
not enlisted and his lips curved in a sneer. He said he was an
Irishman, and that he hated England anyway, and that he hated the
army more poisonously than anything else. He hated the war, he
hated the Northworths and a long string of other newspaper
proprietors, but most of all he hated Fleet Street, its editors,
sub-editors, reporters, advertisement managers in fact, his
hatred extended to the very boys on the streets.</p>

<p>This was the man for my money. I explained to him that in
addition to being a Chilean importer I was running a Chinese news
agency to collect and distribute news pertaining or of interest
to Europeans in China, and when I told him that I was short of a
reporter for news collection and offered him £6 a week, he nearly
jumped into the air with delight. In engaging him I was putting
into practice a plan which I had long formed. Here was an
opportunity for collecting news without arousing suspicion.</p>

<p>A newspaper reporter can ask questions which none of my agents
would dare to frame. He can go up and down the country without
exciting suspicion, and the mere fact that he is a reporter, is
sufficient to give him an entree into circles, admission to which
we could only risk at grave danger to ourselves. An ordinary
reporter might have been valueless, but a man with a grievance, a
man who was "broke to the wide," to use Mister Haynes' own
expressive idiom, was especially valuable. I took him down to the
news agency office, and there he had tangible proof of the
solidity and <i>bona-fides</i> of the agency. The two rooms in
Fleet Street, which I had fitted up, were well furnished. The
name of the agency was painted on the windows and on the glass
panels of the office door, the files of the newspapers were
carefully kept by the boy I employed. There were telephones and a
"tape machine"&mdash; in fact, it was the most convincing
environment that German forethought could design. I never saw a
man so content as he was when I sat him down at a new desk within
reach of the telephone, handed him a £5 note on account of
expenses, and outlined the plan of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Do you speak any foreign language?" I asked. He said he
spoke French indifferently and German not at all which was
excellent news.</p>

<p>"My principals," I explained, "are very anxious, of course to
receive news of the war. The London hospitals are filled with
wounded, and I have no doubt that you would be able to obtain
admission to the wards and collect the personal narratives of the
men as they come home."</p>

<p>"I get you, Steve," he said. "You want stories of heroism in
battle?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," I said, "but don't dwell so much upon the
romantical side of the war. Encourage the men to speak not of
their own battalions but of the gallant fellows who were fighting
on their left and on their right. Find out what other regiments
are in their divisions. Learn some thing about their officers.
Who are the most popular and who are the most unpopular. What
sort of men are their colonels; We want to see the war at a new
angle," I went on hurriedly, for he looked a little dubious and
disappointed, "and we can only do that if we get off the beaten
track. When you have written your matter you will hand it to me
and I will embody it in my weekly letter
to&mdash;er&mdash;China."</p>

<p>From the very first my scheme was a success. Not a day passed
but Mister Haynes brought into me precisely the information which
Headquarters required.</p>

<p>You must understand that until you take prisoners it is almost
impossible to discover what is your enemy's order of battle. Once
you have discovered where certain divisions fit in and what
places particular battalions take, you will no longer be in the
dark in any subsequent actions in which those divisions take
part. For instance, if the Wessex are on the right of the 99th
Division and the Royal Hertfordshires are in the centre, and you
know the positions of every other battalion, you have only to
pick up one prisoner from one battalion at any point of the line
to know exactly the disposition of the others.</p>

<p>Mister Haynes brought information of the first class, but
nothing so enthralling as that which he brought one afternoon
about three weeks after he had started working. I remember the
occasion so well. I can see him almost as tangibly as though he
stood before me leaning against the desk, his rusty hat on the
back of his head, his hands as usual in his pockets.</p>

<p>"I got a queer story from one of those chaps at the London
Hospital," he said. "I don't know whether I can use it."</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"This man said that every night our front line near Bois
Grenier is evacuated to save the men from the effect of the
German shelling. As soon as it gets dark the whole line on a
front of six miles is withdrawn to the support trenches, and he
said he was wounded through being ordered back to the front line
before the German artillery strafe had finished."</p>

<p>"That is very interesting," said I, "on a front of six miles
you say?"</p>

<p>"That's right," he said, "from Bois Grenier down to Festubert.
Do you think I had better use the story?"</p>

<p>"I think not," I said shaking my head, "I don't think it would
be patriotic. Those horrid Germans might get hold of the
information and use it to destroy our brave soldiers."</p>

<p>You may be sure that I was not very long in coding this news,
though it was some time before I could get my telegram to
Stockholm. Apparently the British Government were holding up all
messages for forty-eight hours, but this did not worry me so long
as it reached its destination eventually. Naturally I received a
reply in a much shorter space of time. In fact, Berlin
acknowledged my message within twelve hours of its receipt.</p>

<p>You may remember that in the first week of February we Germans
delivered a sudden and fierce attack upon the British front line
positions between Festubert and Bois Grenier. Owing to some
unhappy and unfortunate change of plan the front line of the
British positions were filled with soldiers, but this was
probably due to the carelessness of General von Klaus who had
assembled his troops for the offensive in broad daylight under
the eyes of the British airmen. Von Klaus himself denied this,
but that is the theory which I have formed because Mister Haynes
afterwards told me that he had had his story confirmed from three
independent sources, and gave me the names of his informants. He
even showed me the photograph of one of them.</p>

<p>Klein, who was up on a brief visit to London&mdash;he was very
busy in South Wales on propaganda, work with his friend Mr
Craigmair&mdash;was anxious that should send Mister Haynes to the
West of England where certain experiments were being made with a
new kind of armoured car. He had attempted to go into the camp
which was guarded as carefully as any prison, and had narrowly
escaped being arrested.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that long before the famous
Tank&mdash;that atrocious and unfair weapon which the English
used, contrary to the laws of the Hague Convention&mdash;came
upon the scene secret experiments were being made. Potsdam had
heard of these, and I had received instructions to prosecute my
investigations with the greatest vigour. Naturally rumours were
rife, and there were many mares' nests before, by lucky chance,
our good friend Klein heard of this experimental camp.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in concocting a story for Mister Haynes.
My suggestion was that he should write an article on the
marvellous mechanical contrivances which the genius of Britain
had brought into being and I dispatched him, with Klein hot upon
the scent to investigate and report. They left by the night train
from Paddington and I saw them off. Klein was very decorous, the
picture of an English gentleman in his check cap and his long
travelling coat, his neatly-gloved hands and his English
magazine, and Mister Haynes was untidy as ever, curled up in the
corner of the carriage and, I should imagine, asleep before he
left the station.</p>

<p>What happened was told me by Klein on the telephone. It was a
happening so disconcerting, so mysterious, that I must confess
that I regarded the unlooked-for outcome of this adventure with
more than ordinary disquietude, even had there not been the more
terrible sequel.</p>

<p>They reached their destination, a small West Country town, in
the early hours of the morning and went to their hotel where they
were joined by Posser, who was working with Klein, and who,
deeply conscious of the importance of finding out details of this
particular machine, had been spending that day in making
judicious inquiries.</p>

<p>They had breakfasted together the next morning, when, of
course, no mention was made of the camp or the new armoured car,
Klein introducing Posser as his secretary. I might explain that
Klein was posing as a Swedish mining engineer who had a patent
for sale connected with coal haulage.</p>

<p>I had sent Mister Haynes on the same train and in company with
Klein, on the pretext that, as Mr. Klein was a friend and was
going to the same town, they might travel together and that Mr.
Klein might possibly give my reporter certain introductions which
would be useful. Mister Haynes spoke about his mission quite
openly, though Klein advised him, laughingly, not to mention his
business if he wanted to secure the information he required.</p>

<p>Apparently Mister Haynes met with little success, and came
back to the hotel to dinner and said that all his efforts to
induce any of the soldiers attached to the camp to give him
information or to secure admission had been fruitless.</p>

<p>Klein was not greatly perturbed. In fact, he was very much
elated because Posser had told him secretly that he intended
making his way into the camp that night in the guise of one of
the waiters at the officers' mess. They all ostensibly went to
bed soon after ten o'clock. Mister Haynes went to his room and
Klein went to his though not to sleep.</p>

<p>He made himself comfortable and took up a book and began
reading. Presently he heard a scraping on his door, and smiled,
for it was the agreed-on signal that Posser was stealing out into
the night to secure his information.</p>

<p>The house was wrapt in sleep at eleven o'clock, and Klein read
on. At one o'clock he heard a tap on the door. His room was next
to Mister Haynes, and thinking that Posser could not have
returned at so early an hour and that it was Haynes who was
knocking, he opened the door. And to his amazement and delight,
for he saw success shining on his comrade's honest face, he
admitted Posser.</p>

<p>"I've got it!" whispered our good Posser.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Klein in the same tone, and kicking off his
slippers he went into the corridor, softly opened Haynes's door
and listened. He heard the regular breathing of the reporter,
closed the door as softly and came back.</p>

<p>"Now tell me," he said quickly.</p>

<p>Posser explained how he had walked boldly into the camp in the
darkness, and how he had reached the shed, crawling through the
sentries, and had seen the most remarkable machine that the war
has produced.</p>

<p>"It is a triumph my dear Klein," he said, his eyes shining, "I
have in my head," he tapped the good, broad German forehead, "the
whole construction of this engine. In twelve hours I will give
you a drawing and notes which &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," said Klein for in his natural excitement,
Posser's voice had risen.</p>

<p>"Here is the rough idea." Posser rapidly sketched a now
familiar shape briefly outlined with rough squares and oblongs
the position of the engine and the guns.</p>

<p>"I will keep this," said Klein. "You must get to work at once,
my dear fellow, and give us a more detailed drawing. But first we
will drink mutual congratulations."</p>

<p>Klein got out a bottle of champagne, pulled out the cork, and
these two fine fellows, true and loyal sons of the Fatherland,
drank in a whisper to the destruction of civilization's
enemy&mdash;England!</p>

<p>Klein accompanied Posser to his room. They pulled down the
blinds before they switched on the light. Quickly the drawing
pads, the rulers, the T-squares and the compasses were taken out
of Posser's suit-case and arrayed on the table.</p>

<p>"Now I will leave you," said Klein, shook hands heartily with
the hero of that night's adventure and left the room, as he said,
without a sound. He had scarcely got into his own room and shut
the door when he heard the click of the lock on Posser's door and
smiled his approval.</p>

<p>It was as at a quarter to two when he went to bed and at
half-past seven the maid brought him a cup of coffee and some
biscuits. He drank his coffee and rose, slipped into his
dressing-gown and went over to Posser's room anxious to know what
was the result of the night's work.</p>

<p>He tapped at the door. There was no answer. He tapped again.
There was still no answer.</p>

<p>He tried the handle, remembering at the same time that Herr
Posser had locked the door. He was a little surprised to find
that the door yielded. The room was in semi-darkness, the blinds
were still drawn and he walked to the window and let the blinds
up with a sash. What he saw, or rather what he did not see,
struck him with amazement. The bed had not been slept in. All the
drawing materials had been cleared, Posser's trunks were still in
the position where he had left them, but there no sign of
Posser.</p>

<p>He went back to his room and rang the bell. The night porter
was summoned but neither he nor any of the servants had seen
Posser, who from that moment vanished from the earth as
completely as though the ground had opened swallowed him, and not
only vanished but had taken with him what drawings he had
made.</p>

<p>In his perturbation Klein went to the room of Mister Haynes,
who was in bed and sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>"Get up!" said Klein testily; "have you seen Mr.&mdash;-, my
secretary?"</p>

<p>Mister Haynes sat up, rubbing his eyes and yawning.</p>

<p>"What's the time?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Confound it," said Klein angrily," what does it matter what
the time is? Have you seen my friend?"</p>

<p>"Why should I have seen your friend? " growled Haynes. "What
happened to him?"</p>

<p>"He has disappeared," said Klein.</p>

<p>"Gone out for a walk, I expect; it is a beautiful
morning."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is raining and blowing," said Klein
angrily; "Why should he go out on a morning like this?"</p>

<p>Haynes rose and dressed himself leisurely, spending an
unconscionable time in the bathroom for a man whom I never
suspected of washing, and turning up at breakfast wholly
unconcerned in his callous English fashion as to what happened to
poor Posser.</p>

<p>Klein, who was all nerves, could eat nothing. He had
questioned everybody in the hotel, but nobody had heard a sound
in the night and the night-porter supplemented his previous
statement, declaring that it was impossible for Posser to leave
the house except with his knowledge.</p>

<p>Klein was not satisfied and made an examination of the outside
of the hotel, hoping to pick up some trace of his comrade.</p>

<p>Outside Posser's window he made a discovery. A line of bushes
grew within a foot of the house-wall, and beneath Posser's window
these had been broken as though by some heavy body having jumped
or fallen upon them. Moreover he discovered a small pair of
dividers which he recognized as Posser's.</p>

<p>Pursuing his investigations beyond the grounds of the hotel,
he came upon the tracks of motor-car wheels which he followed to
the outskirts of the town where he made another discovery. The
road here was undergoing repair; owing to the wetness of the
morning the night watchman was still on duty, not having been
relieved as usually is the case at the hour when the men started
work.</p>

<p>This old man Klein questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the watchman, "I saw a motor-car. It was an
ambulance with green lights. It went past here a little after one
this morning and came by a little after two. It stopped very near
the hotel, because I could see its tail lights and I saw it turn
round."</p>

<p>Klein went back to the hotel with his nerves shaken and his
usually well ordered mind in a condition of chaos.</p>

<p>"I am going back to town by the ten o'clock train," he told
Mister Haynes. 'I suppose you will be staying?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mister Haynes with another yawn. "I shall go back,
too. There is nothing to be got out of this place."</p>

<p>And so, much to the disgust of Klein, who in his state of mind
would have preferred to have been alone, they went back together.
They had to change at Basingstoke, and there finding that he
would have half an hour to wait, Klein crossed to the nearest
hotel and got me on the 'phone. It was in this way that he
related to me as far as he could with safety the extraordinary
happenings of the previous night.</p>

<p>"It is inexplicable, my dear Heine," he said, speaking in
Spanish. "I am bewildered, stunned."</p>

<p>I no less was agitated.</p>

<p>"Did he not communicate anything to you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank our good <i>Gott</i>!" said Klein's voice; "he
gave me a rough sketch which may be sufficient. Whatever has
happened to him the good fellow's work is not fruitless." Then
suddenly his voice sank and he spoke hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I cannot say more," he said, "that infernal reporter of yours
is outside the box. Does he understand Spanish?"</p>

<p>"He understands no language except bad French," I replied, and
heard the click of the telephone receiver being hung up.</p>

<p>So distressed and puzzled was I that I went down to the
station to meet my friend. I walked along the platform as the
train came to a slow standstill, and the first person I met was
Mister Haynes looking more untidy than ever.</p>

<p>"Where is my friend? " I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Haynes, yawning; "he went over to the
hotel to telephone to somebody at Basingstoke and left before I
did. In fact, I had to run to catch the train," he explained. "He
is here somewhere."</p>

<p>But here was no Klein. If he had been left behind he would
have telephoned me. I made inquiries of the guard.</p>

<p>"A gentleman in a check cap and a long ulster?" said that
official. "Yes, I remember him. He got on to the train at
Basingstoke, first-class passenger, wasn't he? I particularly
noticed he was in a carriage by himself and was reading. This is
the carriage," he said, pulling the door open, "here is his
magazine."</p>

<p>On the rack above was Klein's suit-case. It was evident that
it had been rifled because the collars and night-shirt, brushes
and combs, were all mixed together in confusion. I stared at
Haynes and Haynes looked at me.</p>

<p>"How extraordinary!" said Mister Haynes.</p>

<p>It was not until that night that Klein's body was recovered,
lying in a ditch by the side of the railway shot through the
heart, with every pocket turned inside out, and yet, curiously
enough, with all his money, his watch and rings left intact. Of
the rough drawing which he had promised to deliver to me there
was no sign. Close at hand was his revolver with one chamber
discharged.</p>

<p>Mister Haynes was in the office when the news came. He had
been out all the afternoon and had, he said, met with an
accident, for his arm was bandaged and in a sling. I was so upset
by my anxiety over Klein that I had barely noticed Mister
Haynes's injury, but now I looked at him narrowly.</p>

<p>"What is the nature of your injury?" I asked. He laughed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cannelli," he said, "I don't know very much about you.
You may be a very honest man, the tool of very dishonest
men."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? " I asked.</p>

<p>"It may be," he went on, without taking any notice of my
question, "that you are being duped and that it is only
coincidence that you have friends who pursue extraordinary
inquiries. All the records we have of you," my heart gave a throb
and I could feel my hands trembling, "all the records we have of
you," he repeated, "seem to be in good order. I will give you two
pieces of advice. The first is to be careful in your choice of
acquaintances. The second is to refrain from allowing your very
natural anxieties to lead you into further inquiries as to the
fate of Mr. Adolph Klein, alias Simpson, and if I would add a
third," he said, looking out of the window and speaking in his
slow drawl, "it is to advise your friends in communicating with
you to avoid both the telephone and the Spanish language. Good
afternoon."</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and went out, the picture of a broken-down
journalist, and I did not see him again until one day in
Whitehall I passed an officer, wearing the badge of the
Intelligence Department, who smiled and waved his hand to me.</p>

<p>It was my reporter.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story5" name="story5">5. &mdash; THE MAN FROM THE
STARS</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Feb 16, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">IN THE SUMMER of 1915, I received a request from
Berlin which somewhat surprised me. I was instructed to send to
Holland as many good maps of London as I could buy, and I was
told also to prepare one special map, marking the areas which the
street-lamps had been darkened. This was followed (or it may have
come in the same dispatch, I forget) by a request that I should
instruct my men to discover how it was that the British
Government knew we contemplated an air-raid on London.</p>

<p>I myself wondered what information the British Government had
secured and how they had secured it. For months the streets had
been lit as gaily as pre-war days. The theatre signs glowed and
flashed, the West End streets were bathed in radiance and then,
almost by a touch of the magician's wand London "went dark."
Street lamps were shaded, the light signs outside the theatres
were extinguished and it was almost impossible to pick your way
through the streets.</p>

<p>I suppose my excellent friend, the High-Born Baron von
Hertz-Missenger would have said, "English Secret Service." He
reminds me of a character Charles Dickens the great English poet,
who invariably thought that his head was the head of King Charles
II!</p>

<p>The explanation I offered was, that some of our too impetuous
airmen must have betrayed the fact by shouting with haughty
insolence to the English airmen they met in the air. As this has
never been denied, it is probably true.</p>

<p>At any rate I set myself to work upon a map. It was a long
business, and very unsatisfactory, because the whole of London
was dark, and no place was more light than the another. This I
reported, forwarding the maps by special courier.</p>

<p>And then I received a request from our Headquarters that I
should arrange light-signals which should be seen by Zeppelins.
The idea was to post three lights so that they formed a triangle,
one near Albany Park, one near Maidstone Road, and a third in the
east, near Shepherd's Junction. The triangle thus made would
contain all the valuable city area which it was our Zeppelins'
intention to utterly destroy.</p>

<p>Of the first raid in September, it is not necessary for me to
tell. Of how the cowardly Englishmen trembled beneath the
midnight hail of bombs, you have read. I myself did not witness
the raid, because, on receiving information on the afternoon
Zeppelins were due, I had left London for Cornwall. Since it was
impossible for the brave fellows who piloted our good Zeppelins
to distinguish between a patriot and a hateful enemy, I thought
that in the interest of the Fatherland, it was necessary that I
should be as far away as possible when the dread visitation
came.</p>

<p>I returned to London the next morning and arrived at eleven
o'clock. Oh what consternation there was. Oh what vile language
these unkultured Londoners used, what epithets, what adjectives,
the A's, and B's, and C's, and D's, they called us&mdash;but of
that anon!</p>

<p>I was in some anxiety before my journey's end was reached as
to whether I should have to walk a part of the journey, and I was
greatly relieved on questioning the conductor to learn that
Paddington Station had escaped the holocaust. When I arrived at
Paddington everything was going on as usual. To my amazement
buses were running and cabs were plying for hire.</p>

<p>"Where was the raid?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In the East End and the City," was the reply. So, I thought,
my triangle had proved efficacious, and calling a cab, I said:
"Will you please drive me to the ruined area?"</p>

<p>The poor, ignorant fellow thought at first that it was the
name of a public-house, and I had to enlighten him.</p>

<p>"Where the bombs struck," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, brightening up, "I will ask a policeman
where they fell."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," I inquired, "that you don't know?
Perhaps you haven't been to the City?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir," he replied in the true boorish cabman spirit. "I've
been to the city three times but I ain't seen no place where the
bombs fell."</p>

<p>This of course was "eye-wash." For my part I had removed all
my archives from my office, and as that was on the edge of the
City, I drove there first and as pleased to find that my office
had not been touched. I drove up Ludgate Hill and apparently
everything was as usual, and it was not until he had driven
farther on and had penetrated a side street that I saw the
wreckage of a house. It was pleasing and yet disappointing. A
number of windows had been smashed, one house was in ruins and
there was a big hole in a court-yard, but the damage was as such
as might have been caused by an explosion of gas.</p>

<p>It took me a long time before I found the second place where a
bomb had fallen, and there again the results were not as I
expected. I spent the whole of that day wandering about looking
for devastation. I went east and south, and north, and although I
saw some damaged houses, the results of our gallant Zeppelins'
visit left much to be desired.</p>

<p>Returning to my office I was called on the phone and a code
message was sent through to me. As I expected, it was from Berlin
asking for full particulars of the damage done, and very
faithfully I described what I had seen, coded it and passed it on
to the proper quarters.</p>

<p>To my wrath and humiliation, the next evening brought a
peremptory demand from Berlin. It had been sent by radio, picked
up off the coast by a little steamer plying the flag of &mdash;,
and was brought to me from an East Coast port by one of the
couriers we employed for that purpose. The message was, as I say,
peremptory, and there were tears in my eyes, tears of sorrow and
injury as I read it.</p>

<p>"Cannot understand your message. Our pilots report Westminster
Abbey as bombed. Whole streets of the City are in flames, Houses
of Parliament partly destroyed, also London Bridge and Tower of
London. Several ships in docks hit and sunk. Please personally
investigate and report."</p>

<p>Of course there was a chance that these cunning English had,
by means of scene painters and workmen labouring through the
night, removed all sign of the destruction, but I walked over
London Bridge without any difficulty, and as far as I could see
the Tower of London was uninjured.</p>

<p>I reported the same, and three days later, had this message
back:</p>

<p>"Be on south side of Three Mile Wood, north-north-east Saffron
Walden, at eleven o'clock on the night of October 7th."</p>

<p>I could not understand this message, and my new assistant, who
had arrived from America, Herr Wilhelm Peters, was as much
puzzled as I. However, on the 7th of October, I journeyed to
Saffron Walden, which is a little town in Essex, and by studying
a map I discovered that Three Mile Wood was inaccurately named
because it was about seven miles from the town. I decided to
walk, and arrived in the neighbourhood of the wood at about ten
o'clock at night. Having ascertained by consulting my compass
which was the south side, I made my way across fields and muddy
ditches to a big meadow which was exactly placed to the south of
the sparsely-wooded little forest.</p>

<p>It was a clear night with a thin ground haze and was rather
cold. I had brought one of those walking-sticks, the top of which
forms a seat, and this found very comfortable; for the inner man
I had a flask of brandy and some liver sandwiches, and I settled
myself down to my vigil, wondering what on earth had induced
Headquarters to send me upon this wild adventure.</p>

<p>Then suddenly my heart began beating at a tremendous rate as I
divined the reason! It was intended this night for our airships
to reach London, and they desired that I should be a witness.
What folly! What folly! What incomparable insanity to risk the
life of a high Officer of Intelligence, to place him in such
horrible jeopardy. I felt myself grow pale, but then with an
effort I braced up. I was a German!</p>

<p>We Germans fear God and nothing else, and, besides, I thought
there might not be an air-raid after all.</p>

<p>But what satisfaction I got out of that thought was quickly
dissipated. Suddenly an ominous sound came to me. A double "boom!
" far away an the east, was followed by three staccato
explosions. Another bomb fell, suddenly the whole of the eastern
sky was illuminated by the tracing fingers of searchlights.</p>

<p>"Boom!" The sound was growing nearer and my mouth was dry. I
was choking. I loosened my collar and mopped the sweat from my
forehead and stood up, my knees trembling.</p>

<p>I have thought the matter over since and I have come to the
conclusion that my agitation might be explained in this way, that
I was trembling with pride in the fearless exploits of our
gallant airmen, those intrepid messengers of death who sailed the
midnight skies fearless of foe; that I perspired because the
liver sandwich was perhaps a little too highly flavoured. Anyway,
the cursed things were corning closer and who knows what mistakes
a blundering fool of a pilot might make. The searchlights were
suddenly extinguished, the guns were silent and for ten minutes I
heard no sound save a faint but ever-growing-nearer hum of an
engine in the sky. Then there was a shrieking whistle, a crash
that seemed to shake the very earth, a blinding fan of flame and
then silence.</p>

<p>In my rage I shook my fist at the sky.</p>

<p>"Stupid jackasses; miserable, bat-eyed swine-hound! " I cried.
"Have you not the highest instructions in your pockets to avoid
bombing an Intelligence Officer?"</p>

<p>The cursed thing passed overhead. It was roaring like a
railway train passing through a tunnel. I saw the bulk of it
outlined against the stars and then I saw something else, a
little black dot that moved and swayed against the sky. I thought
it might be some infernal machine and I nearly fainted.</p>

<p>Understand that my chief thought was of Germany. I had no fear
for myself, I was merely a cog in the wheel of the great machine
and stood ready at any hour and all days to sacrifice myself for
our dear Deutschland. Fortunately, there was a fallen tree in my
neighbourhood, and under this I crept, looking out from time to
time to see what had happened to the strange thing in the
air.</p>

<p>Then I heard a thud, a rustle, and an oath, and I jumped up,
bruising the back of my head against the tree-trunk, and ran
towards the sound, for that oath was in good German.</p>

<p>"<i>Wer da?</i>" called a sharp voice. "It is I, Heine," I
replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, good," said the voice in German. "You are on the spot, I
see. Help free me from this doubly rotten parachute."</p>

<p>I made my way to him and helped unbuckle some of the straps
that fastened him, and presently he was free.</p>

<p>"Have you got a pocket lamp?" he asked. "No, perhaps you had
better not use it. Where can I put the parachute?"</p>

<p>I suggested the tree under which I had been&mdash;I won't say
hiding, let me rather say taking cover.</p>

<p>"Have you a car?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"You are an ass," said he; "why haven't you a car?"</p>

<p>I knew by the imperiousness of his tone that he was a true
German gentleman probably highly born and connected by many
social ties with an old family of Prussia.</p>

<p>"I am the Baron von Treutzer," he said, as though answering my
thoughts "and I have been sent here to survey the damage that was
done in the last raid."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency will discover that I have spoken nothing but
the truth," I said humbly. The sound of the Zeppelin's engines,
which had diminished, was now increasing in volume.</p>

<p>"Is the airship returning?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said testily. He took from his pocket a small
electric lamp and flashed it three times in the air and
immediately after three tiny sparks of light showed in the
sky.</p>

<p>"They won't be dropping any more bombs, Herr Baron?" I asked
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! What does it matter if they do?" he
boomed&mdash;he was a booming kind of man, born to command,
typical of our virile aristocracy which has placed Germany in the
forefront of world-nations.</p>

<p>"I only asked," I said. "I am a mere observer."</p>

<p>"We only dropped a few bombs," he said, "just to explain our
presence. The real business of our visit is here." I heard him
slap his chest in the darkness.</p>

<p>"I did not know where the raid was intended," I said, "or I
would have arranged for a leader."</p>

<p>"A leader?" he asked. "What the devil do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Evidently Herr Baron is not a member of the Zeppelin crew," I
said humbly, "or he would know that the Zeppelins are 'led' to
their destination by motor-cars with strong head-lamps."</p>

<p>"Of course I am not a member of the Zeppelin crew," he said in
deep disgust, "I am a Royal Lieutenant of the 31st Regiment of
the Prussian Guard."</p>

<p>"Does your Excellency intend staying here very long?" I asked,
as we trudged along the country road.</p>

<p>"For a week," he replied, "after that I return &mdash;"</p>

<p>"By&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"That is my business," he replied, "if a Zeppelin can bring me
here, a Zeppelin can take me away."</p>

<p>Though I had never heard of parachutes that go up, I know all
things are possible owing to the inventive genius of our nation,
so I questioned him no further. Outside Saffron Walden we stopped
while I went to the hotel to collect the handbag which I had left
there.</p>

<p>Needless to say the people in the hotel were in that condition
of cowardly funk which our Zeppelin always inspires. The children
were crying because they had not seen the airship, and again I
heard in the common bar of the hotel those terrible words which
my modesty would only allow me to designate by using certain
letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>I rejoined the Baron and we made our way to the railway
station, which was in darkness. Fortunately the train which came
in was also darkened and remained that way until we reached
London and I was able to bring the Baron to my flat without
observation. He was a tall, handsome gentleman, dressed in
civilian clothes of a noble cut and rich texture, and over a
glass of whisky he graciously unbent and told me that he had come
to England by this curious method to discover the extent of the
damage, not only of the first raid, but of a raid which was
projected and by which it was hoped to lay London entirely in
ruins.</p>

<p>"On what day will that occur? " I asked.</p>

<p>"You will be notified in due time. It may be to-morrow, and it
may be the next day," he replied.</p>

<p>"I only asked," I said carelessly, "because it is necessary
for me to see one of my agents in North Devon one day this week,
and I should not like to miss the raid."</p>

<p>"You will stay here until I go. That is an order. Why are you
looking so pale?"</p>

<p>"It is the pressure of work, your Excellency," I replied. "I
am afraid I have rather taxed my strength. My doctor suggested
that I ought to go away at once to Cornwall or perhaps
Scotland."</p>

<p>"We hope to bomb Scotland," said the Baron thoughtfully. "It
would not be a bad idea if you were there."</p>

<p>"When I said Scotland," I said hastily, "I should have said
that my doctor suggested I should go to Scotland in the spring.
This of course is the very worst weather. Are you likely to bomb
Wales?"</p>

<p>"We cannot reach there. It is beyond our reach," said the
Baron.</p>

<p>"I only ask," I said, "because he also suggested that I should
go there."</p>

<p>"When the raids are over you can go to the devil. I only want
your assistance when they are on."</p>

<p>"Did you say raids or raid?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There may be two," he replied callously.</p>

<p>The next morning he expressed his intention of going through
the City and the East End to photograph the worst of the damage.
I did not offer to accompany him, and indeed, had he suggested
that I should do so, I should have firmly declined. Fortunately,
he knew London very well, for he had been an attaché the German
Embassy a few years before the war broke out, so ha had no need
my assistance or guidance.</p>

<p>He left the flat at eleven o'clock and I arranged to meet him
at a restaurant in Piccadilly for lunch. I need hardly say that
he was armed with a passport not only very completely filled in,
but endorsed with an exact imitation of rubber stamps which were
used in those days by examining officers at Folkestone when
passengers landed.</p>

<p>I was waiting for him at one o'clock, but he did not arrive.
Half-past one came, a quarter to two, two o'clock, and I began to
feel seriously alarmed, and was thinking what an excellent text
his arrest would provide for a letter to Potsdam on the futility
of sending amateurs, when he came through the swing doors.</p>

<p>He uttered no word till we were sitting at the table, and the
waiter had served the soup.</p>

<p>"These English people are very clever," he said at last.</p>

<p>"In a way they are clever," I said, "but by the side of the
German&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense. Our German people are merely slavish
imitators of everybody else in the world. If Germany was not a
nation of slaves we should never have an army."</p>

<p>This put an end to the easy flow of conversation, but
presently I ventured ask: "Why does your Excellency think the
English are clever?"</p>

<p>"I am referring to the way they have cleared up the mess we
made and have run up new buildings." He looked up at me curiously
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>"Naturally," I said heartily, "I have reason to believe that
hundreds of thousands of workmen have been working day and night to
restore Tube damage.'</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"In addition to being a fool, you are a liar," he said, and I
could only smile at the good humour and buoyant frankness of this
high-born officer who was in a probability in the entourage of
the All-highest himself and, at any rate, as I have since learnt,
had frequently dined with that exalted Prince whom we call the
Hope of Germany.</p>

<p>"No," Baron von Treutzer went on, "the Zeppelin did little or
no damage. It caused nothing of the smash that we expected it
would. We will see what tonight's raid brings out."</p>

<p>"To-night?" I said, half-rising from my seat.</p>

<p>"Did I say to-night?" he said in an off-hand way. "Well,
whenever it happens."</p>

<p>But I knew that in a moment of incaution he had spoken the
truth.</p>

<p>"By the way, I shall want you with me to-night," he said.</p>

<p>"To-night?" I repeated. "I am very sorry but this is the one
night I can not be with your Excellency. I have an important
messenger coming from Ireland with particulars of a rising, and
the Foreign Office has particularly asked me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall want you to-night," repeated the Herr Baron, "and you
will meet me at ten o'clock, let us say, in St. Paul's
Churchyard."</p>

<p><i>"Himmel! Herr Baron!"</i> I exploded, "that would be in the
very centre of the raid!"</p>

<p>"Did I ever say that it would not?" he asked coolly, "Of
course it will be in the centre of the raid. You understand, at
ten o'clock. The War Office require a detailed account by
eye-witnesses of the damage which is done,"</p>

<p>"But my messenger arrives at Fishguard to-night," I said with
a tremor in my voice, "Forgive me if I am agitated, Herr Baron,
but I realize the terrible importance, the absolute necessity, of
meeting that boat."</p>

<p>"At ten o'clock you will be in St. Paul's Churchyard," said
the Baron.</p>

<p>How I loathed and hated this tyrant. We Germans are naturally
lovers of freedom. We despise the sycophant and the toady.
Tyranny to us is a pestilential disease to be stamped out with an
iron heel. Woe to those who endeavour to enslave the Germans, for
they are biting on granite!</p>

<p>I told the Baron that I would meet him at the appointed
time.</p>

<p>"Don't come before ten," he said. "We will remain until the
raid is over."</p>

<p>I lifted my hat and bowed as I parted from him in Piccadilly,
and I prayed most fervently, that the earth would open and
swallow this pig, whose abominable manners and low attitude to
men not so well born as himself (though of that I am not sure,
for there were many stories about my mother's friendship for the
Graf von Maldesee, which I sometimes reflect upon with a certain
amount of satisfaction) aroused in me the deepest scorn.</p>

<p>I could eat no dinner that night, I could do no work that
afternoon. I sat in my office until a quarter to ten, suffering,
I think, from a touch of malaria and ague which I contracted in
America. I arrived in St. Paul's Churchyard, dark and gloomy and
silent, on the stroke of ten. I had arranged to meet the Baron at
the corner of one of the lanes which slope down to Upper Thames
Street, and here I took my station.</p>

<p>At a quarter past ten he had not arrived. At twenty minutes
past ten a hundred searchlights flashed into the sky and the
first gun-shot woke the sleeping city. The Zeppelin was coming
straight to the City, but was west of where I stood. I heard the
thud of its bombs and the devil's chorus of the guns. I saw the
skies speckled with shrapnel bursts, but much of what happened in
that brief space of time between its appearance and its
disappearance is blotted from my memory.</p>

<p>I could only stand crouched in a friendly doorway, my hands
before my eyes, thinking of my dear friends, and particularly of
a certain girl in Chicago with whom I had exchanged photographs,
of my dear home, my little brothers, in fact all my life passed
before me. I dare not go out to look for the Herr Baron.</p>

<p>How I envied him, that hardened man of war to whom this
terrible concatenation of sound was as the gentle zephyrs; who
could stand uncowed and watch with his stern military eye the
destruction that was going on about him, uncaring, unafraid,
contemptuous of danger, seeking only the information he required
for his superiors!</p>

<p>In that moment I almost loved the man, even though I hated to
meet him lest he mistook my ague for a more ignoble emotion, but
presently I plucked up courage and went out to look for him. He
was not at the corner of the lane nor was he on the pavement at
all.</p>

<p>I made a circuit of the Cathedral without meeting him and then
I realized that the Zeppelins had not been near St. Paul's but
had passed westward. Naturally he would have been informed at the
last moment and would have been on a spot where they would
pass.</p>

<p>I did not attempt to join the throngs that gathered about the
places where the bombs had fallen, but made my way homeward. At
one o'clock he had not returned; two, three, and four passed. I
still listened and then the horror of the possibility seized me.
This gallant man had perhaps paid for his temerity with his life
and I bought an early morning paper as soon as one was procurable
and searched in vain for some indication of his fate.</p>

<p>Such a man could not be stricken down without attracting
attention, but there was no reference whatever to such a one as
he. In a fever of anxiety I paced my room. I called up my various
agents but they could give me no information and I had almost
abandoned hope when, at half-past eleven, the Baron came,
debonair and calm, into my office.</p>

<p>"You had a good view," were the first words he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Herr Baron," I said. I grasped his hand and shook it (a
most presumptuous thing to do); "I am so glad to see you back! If
you missed me I was on the spot."</p>

<p>"I didn't miss you," he said.</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>"I was at Fishguard, meeting your man, but apparently without
success, for he did not come."</p>

<p>"You were at Fishguard?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said, "you don't suppose I am such a silly
fool that I am going to stand under a bomb to see it burst, do
you?"</p>

<p>Such a man was this mean-souled dog, von Treutzer!</p>

<p>Thank heaven! He disappeared in a week. He may have been
picked up by a descending Zeppelin. He may have been taken off by
a near-approaching submarine. I have had no news, but if I hear
he got back to Germany alive, I, Heine, will be sorry.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="story6" name="story6">6. &mdash; THE AFFAIR OF THE
ALLIES' CONFERENCE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Feb 23, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">I THINK it must have been my association with
the spurious journalist, Haynes, that not only awoke a certain
uneasiness in my breast, and shook my confidence in my judgment
as to the existence of a British secret service, but it also
showed me a way to dispel any suspicion which I might have
created in the bosom of the police, and also to advertise my
innocence to the great public.</p>

<p>I began systematically to write letters to the newspapers. You
may remember my long letter in the <i>Evening Post</i> on the
necessity for limiting the supplies to neutrals. You may recall
the letter which was given due prominence in the
<i>Post-Telegraph</i> on the urgent necessity for a South
American Federation to show a united front against German
"cruelties"&mdash; I felt a foul traitor to <i>Deutschtum</i>
when I wrote this!&mdash;you may have clipped from numerous
papers, both in London and in the provinces, innumerable epistles
signed Francisco Cannelli, on the heroism of France, on the
splendour of Belgium on the necessity for learning Spanish, so
that, the good English could come to South America and take away
the wicked German's trade, and you would certainly have found my
name against respectable amounts in the subscription lists which
were opened by various newspapers in the early days of the
war.</p>

<p>It was a scheme of colossal daring and how well I succeeded!
No less than seven newspapers published my photograph. I was
interviewed for the <i>Times-Herald</i>. I was referred to in
other letters to the editor, and my frankness and geniality were
praised in the highest measure.</p>

<p>For, in the course of these letters I admitted frankly that,
quite unwittingly&mdash;because of my foreign origin&mdash;I had
been acquainted with many notorious spies in England and I even
suggested methods by which the spy could be traced and brought to
justice (this was in on of the four letters I wrote on "The
Unseen Hand").</p>

<p>I took up "The Unseen Hand" idea with enthusiasm. It was a
popular cry and who was I, that I should not take advantage of
the onrushing wave and ride to popularity upon its crest?</p>

<p>To the everlasting honour of the illustrious and excellent
chiefs of my Department in Berlin, they recognized the object of
my scheme, and I could show you now, if the codes had not been
destroyed, messages of congratulation couched in the most
gracious terms and signed by names which indicated personages of
the most exalted character.</p>

<p>There was living in England (in Kent to be exact) at this
time, the Baron von Hertz-Missenger, who was what was termed a
naturalized German, and as I have remarked on many occasions (and
have been complimented on my delicate wit), a naturalized German
is a German in his natural state.</p>

<p>The Herr Baron had a beautiful house and was in a position to
secure news, both from the Fatherland and from certain exclusive
circles in London. From that high flag staff of his, many a
message has leapt into the night and been caught by our vigilant
radio operators at Wilhelmshaven. From that closed study, with
its rows upon rows of books, its gorgeous Persian carpets and its
shaded lamps, many a British secret has been coded into a few
meaningless words. Herr Baron and I were good friends, though we
seldom met. I think he was pleased with me because I never forgot
the homage which is due to the high-born, and he was certainly
popular with me because he had the ear of Potsdam and the
All-Highest Confidence of He Whose Name we will not mention. My
reputation as a writer of letters had been firmly established
when I received a note asking me to meet the Baron at a certain
hotel in a south coast watering place. Precisely on the day, at
the hour, and to the minute of my appointment I presented myself
in the private suite of his Excellency, who always received me
with the most gracious condescension.</p>

<p>"Heine," he said, when he had closed the door, "I am very
troubled about you."</p>

<p>"About me, your Excellency," I said in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, about you," he repeated. "It is clear to me that you are
suspect. I have heard all about the things which have happened in
the past, and knowing the British Secret Service as I do, I cannot
imagine that you have, as the Americans say, got away with
it."</p>

<p>"Secret service, your Excellency?" I smiled; "surely you do
not believe in a widely organized&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Heine," said the Herr Baron sharply; even to
be called a fool by a man of his position and rank is a
compliment, implying as it does a friendliness and an intimacy
which few of us attain with our superiors.</p>

<p>"Of course there is a Secret Police. The whole country is
over-run with them. It is the most deadly Secret Police in the
world, with the exception of the American, because it doesn't
boast and it doesn't talk. Its very silence is its strength."</p>

<p>For my part, though I was not feeling strong, I was silent.
One cannot argue the point with an amateur, even a distinguished
amateur, and whilst I was always willing to admit that the police
of England were undoubtedly brilliant and extraordinarily lucky,
I could not admit the existence of an organization on the scale
which the Herr Baron outlined.</p>

<p>"You don't believe this," he said quickly, and before I could
protest my faith in anything he said, he went on: "I tell you
that this hotel is filled with English spies. They probably saw
you come into this room, and it is fairly certain they followed
you from London and will go back with you. That is why I asked
you my telegram to come down and have a friendly argument on the
question of trade after the war, as outlined in your letter to
the <i>Post-Herald</i>. That telegram was read and re-read before
it reached you. Have no doubt of that, Heine. In England they
know I am a German. They hope I am loyal. They do not trust me
any more than they trust you."</p>

<p>"But surely, Herr Baron," I smiled, " this does not mean that
your Excellency will not be able to serve the Fatherland in
moments of emergency?"</p>

<p>He shook his bead.</p>

<p>"If by that you mean wireless, my answer is no," he said, "my
wireless apparatus is dust and ashes. I have burnt it and
destroyed every single code. I have one more piece of work to do
for Deutschland and if I succeed, or if somebody else succeeds, I
am finished, and will leave well alone. I cannot advise you to do
the same, because it is your business to take risks just as it is
my business not to take risks. Now I have called you down partly
to warn you, and partly to give you certain information. Whether
you act on that information or not is also your business. You
have heard of Lord Leatham?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"He has an estate in Shropshire. He is not a rich man, and
some years he used to let his estate to a tenant. He is a friend
of a friend of mine and I have learnt that it is the intention of
the Government to take over his property as a prison camp for
German officers. Now it may be necessary&mdash;this is merely a
conjecture, and I am only looking ahead&mdash;to communicate with
gentlemen who will be in that camp. Leatham Priory is a very old
house," he spoke slowly and impressively, "at one time it was in
the possession of a persecuted Catholic family, and there is a
legend that beneath the grounds runs a secret subterranean
passage. That it was something more than a legend Lord Leatham
discovered twenty years ago, for a portion of this tunnel was
unearthed, but it seemed lead to nowhere. What his Lordship does
not know, is that that tunnel virtually intact and that the
passage which was discovered was not the real one but was merely
a branch which was never completed and which was intended to lead
to the crypt of the village church. Remember that this is all I
can tell you. I know no more, and I merely pass on the
information to you for what it worth."</p>

<p>I went back to London that night, a little puzzled as to why
the good Baron had brought me all the way to Brighton to give me
information of this kind. It was not a certainty that any
well-placed person would be accommodated on Lord Leatham's property,
and it was less certain that I could be of any assistance to such
a prisoner, unless I was prepared to take down a gang of workmen
(which was obviously impossible) to open up the hidden
passage.</p>

<p>The whole scheme was impracticable and I could only put it
down as an excess of zeal for the Fatherland on the part of his
Excellency.</p>

<p>At parting the Baron had given me a little plan showing the
direction of the tunnel, the entrance of which he said would be
found in a tiny ravine through which flowed a small river, and
had also advised me to look up particulars of Leatham Priory.</p>

<p>The first discovery I made when I began my investigations was
that Leatham Priory was not in Shropshire at all. It was in fact
in Buckinghamshire, midway between Maidenhead and the small town
of Beaconsfield. I sent a good friend down into Buckingham (or
Bucks as they call it) to discover what was happening and he
brought back the news that Lord Leatham's house, the Priory, was
being extensively decorated and refurnished.</p>

<p>Now, I know that the English, because of their fear of
Germany, treat German officer prisoners with the greatest
kindness, but I could not believe, in view of certain outcries in
the public press to which I contributed my share, that the would
spend large sums of money to furnish magnificently a country
house for Germans, and I saw that even as the Herr Baron had been
inaccurate in one particular, so was it likely that he had been
wilfully "misinformed " in another.</p>

<p>I bided my time, for I knew that the significance of the
Baron's communication would be revealed. In the meanwhile, I
myself had paid a visit to the ground and had discovered, not
without a great deal of difficulty, the end of the subterranean
passage. It needed some furtive digging, for the end had fallen
in and was entirely covered up, before I could make sure that I
had discovered the entrance.</p>

<p>The day, or rather the very early morning, I wriggled through
the debris and found myself in a small paved tunnel, smelling
terribly musty, was the day on which I understood the purport of
the Baron's communication. On that day the papers announced that
there was to be a great War Council in London. There had arrived
military representatives of all the Powers, and I, standing in
Whitehall, had seen these officers enter the War Office, where
they remained for two or three hours, when they were escorted by
British officers to Downing Street, where again they remained
some time.</p>

<p>At half-past four in the afternoon six great motor-cars drew
up in Whitehall and the members of the Council entered the cars
and were driven off. From the end of Downing Street I saw they
turned into St. James's Park and, hiring a taxi I followed,
giving the driver instructions to keep the cars in sight as long
as he could. They passed through the park, up St. James's Street,
and I though they were going to their hotel, but instead of this
they went straight along Piccadilly to Hyde Park Corner, where
they turned into the park. Realizing that I could not follow with
my taxi, I put my head out of the window and ordered my driver to
go up Park Lane. At the Marble Arch I picked them up again They
passed along the Bayswater Road and in a flash their destination
was revealed to me. It was in order to entertain this Council
that Lord Leatham's house had been decorated! It was here that
the real conference was to be held!</p>

<p>It was a breathless, tremendous problem which the Herr Baron
had set me about I am not a man easily baffled. There is
something in our German nature rises which superior to
difficulties and which enables us to meet the most tremendous
problems in a calm spirit of transcendent perception.</p>

<p>I flew back to my office as fast as my taxi could carry me,
and for an hour my phone was busy. Understand that whatever risk
I ran was more justified. For there were men in that Council
whose names were household words, whose faces were familiar even
to the child of the cottager; there were names to conjure with,
reputations and records that would have dazzled and frightened a
man of a smaller calibre than myself.</p>

<p>By twelve o'clock that night two desperate and well-armed men
were exploring the tunnel. They were men who were prepared at the
call of the Fatherland to lay down their lives, yea, even on an
enemy's soil.</p>

<p>I was not one of them. I was sorely tempted to go, but common
prudence dictated that the brain of the movement should be far
removed from the scene of danger.</p>

<p>Apparently the party met with no opposition and traversed the
tunnel, which had collapsed in places, until they reached the
ruins of a flight of circular stone stairs, which led up to a
sort of shaft and terminated abruptly at a circular stone
flag.</p>

<p>In preparation for such an emergency they had brought
collapsible ladders and one of our friends mounted to the top. He
could hear footsteps above him, and I judge that he was in the
old baronial banqueting ball which is celebrated throughout
England as the most perfect type of Norman architecture extant in
the country.</p>

<p>Its stone-flagged floor, its vaulted roof, its grim stone
fireplace, great mullioned windows, have been so often described
in guide-books that it is necessary for me to attempt to rival
our good friend Karl Baedeker.</p>

<p>But every attempt which was made to raise the flagged
trap-door, which undoubtedly existed, was frustrated. I employed
in this task one Hermann Swartz, or, to give him his English
name, Herbert Black, a very skilled member of my staff who was
also, curiously enough, a stone mason. Finding their efforts
unavailing, the party made their way back to London and reported
to me.</p>

<p>"I can tell you this, Herr Heine," said Swartz, with that
profound earnestness which is the charm of the German working man
who has no peer in the world, "that if you let me bring my tools
I will guarantee to open that trap to-night. I feel in this that
I cannot assume responsibility unless I am directed by a superior
officer, and I suggest that you should come with us."</p>

<p>"My dear good Swartz," said I testily, "why should I go with
you? You understand that it is very necessary that I should not
be identified with such enterprise as this, that I am the brains
of a great movement and that upon my safety depends, perhaps, the
ever-to-be-desired safety of the Fatherland."</p>

<p>Whereupon Swartz (and I regret to have to report this, and
have already notified Berlin of the occurrence) refused to go
except under my leadership.</p>

<p>Having made a most exhaustive inquiry of all the
circumstances, and having discovered that there was very little
danger of my detection, I agreed, and at three o'clock in the
morning, behold me crawling stealthily through a square in the
banqueting hall of Leatham Priory. One dim electric light burned
in the roof, giving the gaunt apartment an air of size and
mystery. Save along the centre, it was uncarpeted. The
smouldering ashes of a fire still burnt in the grate and from
somewhere a great clock ticked solemnly. The room was almost
innocent of furniture. There was a long, an interminably long,
table set upon the parallelogram of carpet and against this were
pushed about twenty chairs. There were three or four suits of
armour, two big pieces of tapestry covering the principal walls,
a black oak buffet or sideboard, half a dozen easy chairs about
the fire-place and, so far as I could see, nothing else.</p>

<p>There were four doors leading from the room, two at each end,
and I gathered that those flanking the sideboard would lead to
the kitchens and servants' quarters, and that the two doors
facing them, which were beautifully carved, and one which was
half hidden by a portière, would lead to the wing in which
Leatham and his guests were asleep.</p>

<p>I had pulled on felt-slippers over my boots and made my quiet
way to door which was covered by the portiere. My objective you
may easily guess. These high nobilities who were visiting Lord
Leatham were members of the Conference, that Conference would be
held possibly in one of the great saloons and the portfolios
containing the notes of the meeting would be found in the
high-born lord's study or office.</p>

<p>I proceeded very stealthily, because I knew that in view of
the presence of such important people, watchers and sentries
would be placed about the house, and in this I was not mistaken,
for looking through one of the long window there were half a
dozen in the hall&mdash;I could see two policemen walking slowly
along a path which ran parallel with the house. The only danger
was that they would also post watchers inside the house. As a
matter of fact there were two, but these men were posted on the
next floor, one at each end of a passage leading to the
apartments where the distinguished guests were sleeping. The
study I found after a tiresome search. It was situated in an
annexe and reached by another passage which ran at right angles
to the main corridor.</p>

<p>The door was fastened by a patent lock which, however,
presented no difficulties to Heinrich Falkenburg, one of my
assistants, whose services I am pleased acknowledge. I made a
very careful examination of the door with my pocket lamp and
there appeared to be no wires and no alarm signal.</p>

<p>You may wonder how I came to distinguish the study from the
other rooms. I will tell you. It was the only room that was
locked. I opened the door cautiously and listened for the sound
of a bell. We stood for nearly five minutes before we ventured
into the room, and when we did, we were rewarded. There was only
one window and across that heavy purple velvet curtains had been
drawn. There was a large library-table in the middle on which
were several ash trays filled with cigar ash. There was no need
for me to make this discovery for the room was heavy with the
scent of cigar smoke and cedar wood.</p>

<p>So, thought I, the excellent plenipotentiaries have met here
and not in the saloon. I looked about and found some scraps of
paper in the waste-paper basket. Some were covered with figures,
a few were just fantastically scrawl designs such as men make
when their minds are occupied and their hands idle. There were
one or two blue books relating to food supply, but nothing of any
great moment, though I very carefully pocketed all the written
matter. The search was necessarily slow since we depended upon
our flash lamp though we might have switched on the lights with
impunity. In one corner of the room was a large and an old-fashioned
safe. It stood about two metres high and a metre broad and had
two narrow doors. Upon this Heinrich got to work and in half an
hour I had the satisfaction of seeing the doors swing open.</p>

<p>What a tribute to my perspicacity! What a triumphant
vindication of a "Hun's" foresight! Call us "<i>Boches</i>," call
us by every vile name that your kultural deficiencies may
suggest, but bear ungrudging witness to the everything foreseeing
perfections of German organization!</p>

<p>For there, stacked neatly, one on top of the other, were six
black portfolios, bulky and bulging. There was no need to ask
whose properties were these. The golden "R.F." on one, the arms
of Savoy an another, the crowned eagle on a third, advertised
their ownership. Very carefully I removed them, handed them to my
assistants.</p>

<p>The safe contained nothing else except a battered tin
cash-box. I lifted with difficulty, for it was heavy.</p>

<p>"No," thought I, "we are not burglars. We do not require this
haughty Lord's treasure. We Germans are not pot-house thieves,
horse-holders and cut throat hang-dogs, to steal from a house
like burglars! Let my Lordship keep gold. I have something
better!"</p>

<p>I gave the signal and we crept forth along the corridor to the
trap. We had closed it for fear that somebody passing through the
hall should notice the opening and give the alarm.</p>

<p>Hermann knelt down and tried to lift the slab, but without
success. He used his pocket-knife and did no more than break off
the blade.</p>

<p>I cursed his bungling stupidity so furiously that he cowered
before me. "What undependable swine these German working classes
are! What brainless idiots, with no other thought than eating and
beer-drinking! "Wretched owl," I hissed in his ear, "if we were
in Germany I would flay you alive!"</p>

<p>"Herr Heine," he whined, "it is not my fault. I wanted to
bring up my tools, but you refused to let me."</p>

<p>I could not waste any time arguing with this scum. In
half-an-hour the dawn would be breaking. There was only one way
out and that was through he kitchen. We passed through one of the
doors behind the buffet and found ourselves in another stone
corridor lighted by little stone-framed windows, but heavily
barred. At one end of the corridor was another door and Heinrich,
after a vain attempt to pick the lock, said it had been bolted
from the outside.</p>

<p>"Have you no bolt-removing instrument?" I asked. "No, Herr
Heine," he said apologetically, "that requires an apparatus of
considerable complication. The only thing to do is to cut a hole
through the door, and as the door is sheeted with iron I do not
think it is possible."</p>

<p>We went down the corridor to the other portal. This door
yielded to the turn of a handle, and we found ourselves in what
was evidently a servery. Here there was one window which was also
barred and a kitchen door, which, like the one on the farther end
of the corridor, was bolted on the other side.</p>

<p>"What!" I said bitterly, "have I trusted my safety and the
safety of the empire to a monkey with the brains of a gnat?"</p>

<p>He was silent under my rebuke, for what could he say? There
remained only one possible egress and that was a skylight in the
servery, and here fortune was with us, for we found a step-ladder
which enabled us to reach the ceiling. I insisted upon Heinrich
going first because it did not look very safe, and how my heart
bounded when the skylight yielded to his touch and he was able to
hoist himself, with the assistance of Hermann, through the
aperture.</p>

<p>I followed immediately afterwards. We found ourselves on a
sloping roof, and edging my way down to the guttering looked down
and found that we had a drop of no more than a dozen feet. In
three minutes we were on the ground, ad moving stealthily from
bush to bush unchallenged by the cordon of policemen, and reached
the outside road without mishap.</p>

<p>We were now on the other side of the house, far away from the
ravine and my waiting motor-car. The first pale light of dawn was
in the sky and I knew that we could not afford to take the risk
of searching for the road by which we had come. Yet without the
motor-car I was in a quandary. How might I get these portfolios
of such world-shaking importance away without detection? I could
not carry them myself and I could not trust my companions, for we
Germans trust nobody, and by our caution-dictated suspicion we
have eliminated half of the dangers which ordinarily threaten a
modern state.</p>

<p>We were in a residential road. About Leatham Priory quite a
respectable suburb has grown up and this was one of those
better-class thoroughfares made of detached houses standing in
their own grounds, or, as the English advertisements put it,
"Houses with every modern convenience." In a flash I had made my
plans. I knew that there was certain to be in such a road as this
an empty house, and sure enough the third of the houses we passed
bore in the garden a board (or rather two boards) saying it was
"To Let."</p>

<p>I beckoned my party to follow me. Heinrich opened the door in
a trice&mdash;it was child's play to this mechanic&mdash;and we
entered the house, our footsteps sounding hollowly. It was not
wholly furnished, I discovered to my surprise, for on the first
floor there was a bedroom containing a few articles of furniture,
but apparently the room had not been used some time. The shutters
were tightly fastened over the window and I guessed that the room
had been used by a caretaker until the owner had tired of paying
his wages.</p>

<p>This view was fully confirmed later when I looked at the board
outside, for the words "Apply to caretaker" had been painted over
and a new address had been given at which the key might be
obtained.</p>

<p>In this room there was big cupboard, the key of which was in
the lock and into the cupboard I bundled the portfolios, locking
the door, and put the key into my pocket.</p>

<p>"Now," I said to my comrades, "each will go his own way but
avoid observation as far as possible."</p>

<p>"What about the car and the tools in the passage?" asked
Hermann.</p>

<p>"I have told the car not to wait beyond daybreak," I said
(German forethought again!) "and as for the tools you may collect
them after dark to-night."</p>

<p>I got back safely to my apartment and turned up at ten o'clock
at my office very well pleased with my night's work. At the
office I found a messenger waiting for me. I recognized the man
as the Herr Baron's valet, a trustworthy Bavarian who had
naturalized himself at the same time as my well-born patron. I
opened the letter. It was from Baron von Hertz-Missenger. It
read:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"By this time you have probably understood the
little riddle I set you. Don't forget that it is of the utmost
importance that certain things should be secured. I myself am
working night and day to obtain results. Leave no stone unturned.
If you fail notify me immediately. The Conference will last two
more days. If you fail I am in a position to make the attempt
myself."</p><br>

<p>I put the letter down with a smile. With what joy would the
good Baron receive my news. If I failed; if I, Heine
failed&mdash;the idea was amazing! I say here, before I proceed
to the end of this incident, and I cannot give to great emphasis
to my words, that it would be well if the Department in which I
have the honour to serve &mdash;which is in other respects
conducted with serious cleverness&mdash;implicitly trusted the
proved genius of their officers and would not allow amateurs,
however distinguished, to interfere with the operations of
regular departmental officers.</p>

<p>I burnt the latter and sent the good baron's servant on his
way rejoicing with half-a-crown. It is always as well to keep the
servants of the high-born in good temper and favourably inclined.
Then I rang up Messrs. Hedley and Riddle. Yes, I had carefully
noted the name of the house agents, I got them on the 'phone and
asked to speak to the proprietor.</p>

<p>"You have a house to let near the village of Leatham Priory,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he responded in the servile accent of an English
house agent.</p>

<p>"I would like to see the house. May I call today for the
key?"</p>

<p>"Which house is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>Here again my forethought served me.</p>

<p>"It is the house called 'Fairlawn'."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the man, "my assistant has charge of this
department. He is at lunch now, but when he comes in I will tell
him to meet you at the station."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble," said I; "will you have the key ready for me?
You remember, it is 'Fairlawn,' and I want to have the first
refusal, so do not let anyone else see the house until I
come."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir," said the servile hound.</p>

<p>I hung up the receiver and rubbed my hands, and at that moment
there came a knock at my door. I walked over to the door and
opened it. An officer with the green tabs of the British
Intelligence Department stood smiling on the mat and I recognized
my treacherous "friend" of other days, Mister Haynes or rather
Major Haynes."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Major," I said jovially, "have you come to
'warn' me again?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit," he said, walking inside and shaking hands, "I
have just come to ask you if you know anything about the Baron
von Hertz-Missenger."</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears.</p>

<p>"I know the good Baron," I said carelessly, "just as a casual
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"How unfortunate you are," said Mister Haynes (I should say
Major Haynes) in tones of sadness.</p>

<p>"Why unfortunate, Major?" I asked.</p>

<p>"All your friends seem to get into trouble," sighed the major;
"perhaps you don't know that a number of important documents were
stolen from Leatham Priory last night."</p>

<p>"Great heavens, you don't mean to say that," I said with
well-simulated astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, fortunately, the most important, including secret cases,
were left behind. They were in a steel cash-box and the thief or
thieves did not trouble to examine its contents."</p>

<p>I did not swoon. Nobody seeing me would imagine what thoughts
were swimming through my brain.</p>

<p>"The robbery was discovered this morning and naturally
suspicion attached to the Baron," the major went on.</p>

<p>"Why to the Baron? " I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Haynes, "he has been hanging about the
neighbourhood and we discovered some time ago that he had
arranged with the clerk of house agent to occupy a room in a
house which was ostensibly to let." My flesh went cold and like a
goose's.</p>

<p>"From his headquarters," Mister Haynes went on, "he apparently
sallied forth from time to time making a very careful
reconnaissance of the Priory. He must have known that an
important Conference was to be held. We have established the fact
that two of Lord Leatham's servants were in his pay, and,
naturally, when the portfolios were missing we searched his
lodging."</p>

<p>"Oh, naturally," said I weakly.</p>

<p>"And we discovered the stolen property."</p>

<p>"How strange!" I said in a hollow voice.</p>

<p>"And you don't know him," said Mister Haynes, I mean Major
Haynes.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not," I said with firm determination.</p>

<p>"Well, you are unlucky," said the major, "for if you don't
know him now you never will know him," and with those ominous
words he left me.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story7" name="story7">7. &mdash; THE WORD OF A
PRINCE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Mar 2, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">THERE is a moral in these narratives, which were
originally written not so much for publication as to convey a
true record of an adventurous career to one who was inexpressibly
dear to me, the learned and beautiful Miss Kathleen O'Mara,
secretary (honorary, for she would not accept payment for
performing national service) of the German Gaelic League of
Chicago, the most implacable, the most bitter enemy proud Albion
ever had.</p>

<p>Reading this narrative over, I think perhaps it would be more
consistent if I omitted these preliminary paragraphs in view of
the events which are recorded below. Should this story by chance
obtain a wider circulation than that which was intended, it would
be perhaps necessary to explain my honourable relationships with
this sometime belle of Irish freedom.</p>

<p>Miss O'Mara and I met in the halcyon days at a ball. What
there was in me that attracted her it is not for me to say. It is
sufficient that Miss Kathleen O'Mara believed in me. I wrote to
her every week from the day I landed in England. I wrote about my
life and about her work and that peculiar hobby of hers that I
had many times thought of utilizing for the benefit of the
Fatherland. Sometimes she would reply tenderly or in holy rage
when she thought of the wrongs of her downtrodden countrymen
(i.e. Irishmen) and sometimes she did not answer at all. For
three months before this story opened I had not heard from
her.</p>

<p>I had posted my letter on the Friday afternoon and sauntered
back to office to see if any news had come in. The boy I employed
told me there had been a caller, a gentleman who had refused to
give his name, but said he would come back later. I do not like
callers who refuse to give their names, for though I do not
believe there is a British Secret Service, there is always
possibility that the regular police may be going outside their
province by prying into the lives and habits of "respectable
aliens," as they call them.</p>

<p>"Did he leave no message? " I asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the boy, "he merely said that he would call
again."</p>

<p>It was not until the following day that my visitor made his
reappearance. It was Saturday and I was preparing to go home in
the English fashion at one o'clock, when the gentleman was
announced. He was a tall, pale man with a dark and heavy
moustache, bristling black eyebrows and that look of concentrated
fierceness which so often distinguishes the insurance agent.</p>

<p>"Come in," I said, inviting him into my private office, and
closing the door.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I have a message from Kathleen," he said.</p>

<p>I seized him warmly by the hand and shook it.</p>

<p>"Any friend of Kathleen's is a friend of mine," I said: "sit
down."</p>

<p>I looked around uncomfortably and went again to the door and
dismissed the boy for the day, paying him his wages.</p>

<p>"You may speak in perfect security," I said.</p>

<p>"Kathleen is coming home," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Coming home?" I could not restrain the joy in my voice. "Do
you mean coming to&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"To Ireland," he said. "Things are going well over there."</p>

<p>He need not have told me that. Indeed, I could have told him
much more than he could possibly have known. I could have
explained why things were going well. I could have made his hair
stand on end if I had told him the amount of money that had
passed through my hands for distribution to Dublin, I could have
told him of stacks of arms landed on the deserted coast by our
submarines and of visits which were made by the same vehicle by a
certain distinguished Irishman, now unhappily no longer with
us.</p>

<p>I could have told him of the organization for which I, Heine,
had been responsible, which had provided the patriots of Ireland
with ammunition. But why continue the list? I did not tell him
anything, and I have reason to believe that he was disappointed.
A thought suddenly sobered me.</p>

<p>"Is it safe for Kathleen to come over at this juncture?" I
asked. "By the by, I don't know your name."</p>

<p>"I am Theophilus Hagan," he said, and I seemed to remember the
name. "You have met me?" he went on.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," said I, and curiously enough I had a
dim recollection of having met him somewhere, but for the life of
me I couldn't remember the circumstances. "Oh, yes, I remember
you," I said, for we Germans never admit ignorance on any
subject.</p>

<p>"There is something else I want to tell you about myself," he
said; "but perhaps this is not the moment to give away
secrets."</p>

<p>"Tell me," said I earnestly, "anything you know. It shall not
leave these four walls."</p>

<p>I was curious to hear what his secret was, because our people
in Berlin were very anxious for news of what was going on in
Ireland and they had complained before that they were imperfectly
informed.</p>

<p>"No," said the man, "I will tell you later. I am going over to
Ireland tomorrow. If we have any luck we shall have a rising on
Easter Sunday. Kathleen wants you to be in Dublin when the
trouble starts."</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"That would be very unwise indeed," I said; "the more I am
kept out of it the better for the cause. When does she
arrive?"</p>

<p>"She will be in Dublin a fortnight before the rising starts,"
said he.</p>

<p>"I will endeavour to be there to see her," I replied. "I shall
not be able stay long because naturally I am very busy." I shook
hands with him and saw him as far as the office door. After my
experience with Mister, or Major, Haynes, I could not deem it
advisable to be seen in public with gentlemen who might
conceivably fall under the displeasure of the British
authorities, and I explained this to him as a reason for my not
coming to Euston Station to see him off.</p>

<p>I had spoken nothing but truth when I had said that I was very
busy. Extraordinary changes were going on in England and
particularly in London, where the constant alterations in the
anti-aircraft gun positions, the erratic systems of lighting
their streets which the British were adopting, were turning my
hair grey. It is said that I sent a new map of London's new
defences every week to Germany and that every one was different,
and this was true, but map-making as not my only source of
employment.</p>

<p>By this time there were quite a respectable number of German
prisoners in England, all of whom were anxious for help to make
their escape, and whilst officially, I was not in touch with
them, unofficially I had a lot to do with such successes as they
achieved. It was I who had provided the motor-car for the four
officers who escaped from Dabbington Hall. It was I who provided
the tools for digging the underground passage by which three
officers escaped from the Marlow camp. It was I who provided the
clothing and disguises which enabled four naval officers and a
Zeppelin officer to cross England after they had escaped from the
Welsh camp. It is true they were all caught again, but that was
nothing to do with me. When I had freed them from camp and set
them on the road my work was finished and the rest was up to
their good German ingenuity and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>On the Sunday following the Saturday I had seen Mr. Theophilus
Hagan, I was rung up on the telephone.</p>

<p>"Can you supply three dozen dress-collars for a gentleman from
Slough?" said a voice.</p>

<p>"Where does the gentleman live?" I asked calmly.</p>

<p>"Outside the White City. The collars are to be delivered at
nine o'clock," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will attend to it," I said, and hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>A curious place to live, you think, outside the principal
entrance to an exhibition ground? And is it not strange that a
gentleman from Slough required his collars delivered in London? I
will make no mystery of the matter. "Three dozen dress-collars"
meant "I have escaped and want your help." Slough was the place
from which he had escaped. The White City was point at which I
must meet him and the hour was nine.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock to the moment my taxi-cab drew up in front of
the ornate entrance of the exhibition grounds. The place was of
course in darkness, and a man who was walking slowly along the
kerb turned to the cab as it stopped and asked: "Have you brought
my collars?"</p>

<p>"Step in," I said.</p>

<p>The cabman had his instructions and turned towards the
City.</p>

<p>To meet these escaping-prisoner cases I had taken a furnished
flat in the Edgware Road. It was on the ground floor and had the
advantage of having no porter, so that one could go in and out
without being spied upon.</p>

<p>I opened the door of my flat and ushered my visitor in.</p>

<p>"Your name?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"<i>Prinz</i>&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Highness," said I quickly, "forgive my peremptory tone and
please command me. I am entirely at your disposition. If I have
been a little taciturn and quiet on the journey, and if I spoke
to you a little sharply, pray pardon an over-tired servant of the
Empire."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," he said.</p>

<p>He was a little, short man who wore glasses.</p>

<p>"My name," he said, "is Prinz, Earl Frederick Prinz. I am a
Lieutenant of the 34th Silesian Regiment."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I said a little coldly "you led me to believe you
were highly-born. Now what the devil do you mean by doing
that?"</p>

<p>"It is not my fault, Mr. Heine, that you were deceived," he
said humbly.</p>

<p>"What do you expect me to do?" I asked angrily, for one cannot
waste time on a reserve lieutenant and such-like cattle.</p>

<p>"You ought not to have called me up at all," I said, raising
my voice; "it is abominable. Have I nothing better to do?"</p>

<p>He stopped me with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Pray do not excite yourself unduly, Mr. Heine," he said; "for
any trouble you may take, my father, the Colonial Secretary, will
repay you."</p>

<p>"The illustrious Doctor Prinz?" I said. "Are you his son? " I
stretched out my hand and gripped his.</p>

<p>"Welcome, a thousand welcomes! I know your Councillor of State
father and his Excellency has frequently spoken to me of his son.
Come, come," said jovially, "help yourself to the good Rhine
wine, for it is not often that are honoured by a visitor of your
calibre, Herr Lieutenant."</p>

<p>We drank a bottle together, and then he told me his plans. The
difficulty getting out of England is, briefly, to get out of
England. To secure a place on board a ship is well-nigh
impossible, unless you are vouched for by Foreign Office
officials, whilst the punishment for stowing away is so heavy
that few of the neutral captains care to take the risk of allowing
their ships to go out of port without conducting an independent
search.</p>

<p>Herr Prinz, however, had received a message from his father by
same secret cipher to the effect that four times each month a
submarine would come in-shore off the Scottish coast. He was to
reach a deserted part of the foreshore, flash a signal from an
electric lamp and a boat would be put off to pick him up. The
system would be put into operation the moment the Herr Doctor
Councillor of State, Prinz, learnt from me that he was free.</p>

<p>"Content yourself, my dear lieutenant," I said, "you are as
good as in the Fatherland. I will notify your august parent, to
whom I trust you will remember me forthwith."</p>

<p>"I have already notified him, and I desire that you should not
communicate," he said, so I took no further steps. There was no
difficulty in getting the young man to Scotland, and I ventured
to take a little holiday and accompany him. After all, one should
show a little attention the men who have fought and bled for
one's country, especially when they are nearly related to
councillors of State who, if not noble, are exalted personages on
the way to nobility.</p>

<p>I supplied the young man with passports and various documents
to identify him, and left him with £50 (which I advanced out of
my private purse) at an hotel in a small town not many miles from
the coast of Scotland in the care of a good German Head-waiter
who promised to look after the lad. And there I thought I had
heard the last of him, and he had gone out of my mind, until I
received an urgent message from Scotland saying that the
submarine had not come and asking me for another £50.</p>

<p>I went straight up to Scotland and found the Herr Lieutenant
living at the hotel and very weary.</p>

<p>"It is very strange, Heine, I have been at the appointed place
every night, on the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th. I have flashed my
lamp and nothing has happened."</p>

<p>He told me he had waited on one occasion for four hours on the
beach; on another he waited till daybreak.</p>

<p>"It is very extraordinary," I said. "When you fixed this
scheme with His Excellency the Councillor of State, Doctor Prinz,
was it by writing?"</p>

<p>"By secret cipher, and what is more, the message was written
in secret ink."</p>

<p>"Did it reach you without having been opened?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Herr Lieutenant; "I have one of the letters
in my pocket now."</p>

<p>He took the letter and opened it. Apparently it was an
innocent letter such as an affectionate father might write to his
prisoner son.</p>

<p>"Now wait," said the young officer. He sent for a glass of
milk and immersed the letter, then held it before the fire to
dry. There instantly appeared string after string of words which
were meaningless to me, apparently written in brown ink.</p>

<p>"I carry the code in my head," he said. I looked at the
envelope, carrying it to the light. I noticed that the stamp and
the postmark had been torn off and inwardly I praised the young
man for his discretion. The flap was stuck down, though it had of
course been cut at the top where the letter was taken out, and to
all intents it had not been tampered with.</p>

<p>I examined it with a magnifying glass, however, and saw that
suspicious gum line which can always be seen in a letter that has
been opened and surreptitiously closed.</p>

<p>"This envelope has been steamed," I said, "the letter has been
read, replaced, and fastened down by a kind of spirit gum which
the censors use, and smoothed with a hot iron."</p>

<p>"How do you know? " he asked in alarm.</p>

<p>"I have opened too many myself," I said, with a smile, "not to
recognize the signs."</p>

<p>"But supposing they had brought up the secret writing," he
said, "they could not understand the code."</p>

<p>I thought for a moment and presently I said: "There is only
one person in the world who can read that code and that person is
a woman. More than that, Herr Lieutenant," I added proudly, "that
woman is the dearest friend I have in the world, Miss Kathleen
O'Hara, of Chicago, U.S.A."</p>

<p>And I told him something of this delightful girl's history, of
how her father had been a Fenian and how she was bitterly
anti-English. She had taken up codes and ciphers as a hobby, and
she had come to be so expert that you were always reading in the
Chicago papers articles either written by her or about her. There
was not a cryptograph that ever appeared in the agony column of a
London newspaper that she couldn't discover.</p>

<p>"You said her name was O'Mara," said the Herr Lieutenant
thoughtfully; "is she a tall slim girl, with dark hair and blue
eyes?"</p>

<p>It was my turn to be amazed.</p>

<p>"Herr Lieutenant," I said, "even your illustrious father could
not have described her more accurately."</p>

<p>"And is her husband a tallish man with bristling black
eyebrows and fierce black moustache?"</p>

<p>I drew myself up stiffly.</p>

<p>"The lady's husband, Herr Lieutenant, you see before you in
prospect. She is unmarried."</p>

<p>He looked at me and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Well, then, it is not the same lady. This was a Mrs. Hagan,
the wife of Captain, Hagan of the United States Secret
Service."</p>

<p>I stepped back and clasped my brows. Now I remembered the man!
Hagan from Washington! And she had married him. By heavens! When
I think of the depth of woman's duplicity I could despise the
race. She, the Irish patriot, the strafer of England, to send
that man to me in the hope that I should commit myself! Thou
perfidious betrayer of one who entertained for you naught but the
tenderest, holiest feelings! Oh, what a low woman!</p>

<p>"I see it all now, Herr Lieutenant," I said, "this woman was
brought down to your camp to unravel your cipher. When did you
receive it?"</p>

<p>He thought a moment.</p>

<p>"The night she left."</p>

<p>"Now you understand!" I cried passionately. "No wonder you
have waited in vain upon the beach! No wonder the four submarines
disappeared! No wonder you were allowed to remain at liberty!
These cursed, treacherous British! Was there ever a nation that
more deserved to be obliterated?"</p>

<p>I made my plans quickly, as is my wont. Before leaving that
night I gave the Herr Lieutenant another £50, making £100 he had
received since his escape. I myself was in considerable danger
and if Hagan suspected me, the traitorous Kathleen knew me. I
sent a man specially to Dublin and discovered that they were
staying at an hotel in Sackville Street and that so far from
Hagan having arrived recently, both he and his wife had been in
Dublin for six months and they were undoubtedly in the pay of the
British Government.</p>

<p>Of the events which occurred or Easter Monday in Dublin, I do
not propose to speak. I sent very full reports to the Government,
which may be read with profit by any who have the entree to the
archives in Wilhelmstrasse.</p>

<p>Two days after the rebellion started I saw Hagan and his wife
in Regent Street, they were looking in the widow of a jeweller's
shop. With me to think is to act. I stepped up to her and offered
her my hand.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Mrs. Hagan," I said.</p>

<p>"Sure, 'tis the little Dutchman, Mr. Heine," she smiled. "You
know my husband?"</p>

<p>"I have that pleasure." I bowed stiffly and hid my emotion
behind an inscrutable face.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing in an enemy's country?" asked Kathleen
innocently.</p>

<p>"Enemy!" I laughed bitterly. "There was a time, madam, when
there was only one enemy for the honorary secretary of a
German-Gaelic club and that was&mdash;England!"</p>

<p>"There is only one enemy for me now," she said, gripping her
husband's arm foolishly, "and that is Theo's enemy. Sure, a wild
young girl never knows her own mind, Mr Heine, and she runs this
way and that with the divil an idea what she is seeking. I guess
I was seeking Theo, and now I've found him I've stopped
hustling."</p>

<p>We exchanged a few words. I strolled with them to Piccadilly
Circus and they accepted an invitation to lunch at Prince's.</p>

<p>"By the way," I said in the midst of the meal, "do you still
keep up your cryptograph investigations?"</p>

<p>I thought I saw a little look pass between her and her husband
and then she smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, she may have said "sure" (I will not
swear as to the exact words of any dialogue which I report), "oh
yes, faith, it's highly amusing."</p>

<p>"And profitable too, I suppose," I said carelessly, helping
myself to some celery.</p>

<p>"Faith, it is that," she said; "many is the laugh I have had
going through silly ciphers coming from Germany&mdash;had cess on
the place, and from Scotland too," she said.</p>

<p>You observe she was shameless! There was no blush of guilt, no
faltering, no lowering of eyes. She stood detected, blatantly
confessed, an agent of the English!</p>

<p>"When Theo came over to look after the American crooks in
London. I came with him," she said. "that is how I got to know
those boys at Scotland Yard, and I sort of drifted into the work
and took to it like a duck to water!"</p>

<p>My hand was trembling, I could not help it. Righteous
indignation shook me from head to foot. I could have boxed her
ears, but for my German chivalry and the presence of her husband,
who might have been distressed at such a display of emotion,
though I am sure he would have agreed with me had he only known
the amount of money I had spent on that frail creature in flowers
and theatre tickets and candy, to say nothing of postage
stamps.</p>

<p>"They would amuse you, Heine," she went on, "especially the
queer things they say about you. There was a fellow the other day
got a letter, phwat was the boy's name, Theo?"</p>

<p>"Prinz," said her husband, who hitherto had not spoken a
word.</p>

<p>"Sure that was his name," said the girl, "'twas from his old
dub of a father and written in a very simple cipher."</p>

<p>"A child could have read it," agreed her husband, "and it was
all about you," he nodded to me.</p>

<p>"It said go and see Heine," said the girl. "Tell him your
father's a prince, and if you haven't got the pluck to do that,
say you are the son of Colonial Officer Prinz, and he will do
anything for you. There was a long bit about the lie he had to
tell you. About submarines going up to Scotland to fetch him.
When we told the commandant he let the boy go, he was safe. He
was arrested yesterday and his father has been interned."</p>

<p>"His father interned?" I gasped</p>

<p>"Who was his father?"</p>

<p>Kathleen looked at her husband and Hagan spoke. "He was the
head-waiter at the hotel where the boy was staying," he said,
"'twas his way of getting the lad a vacation."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story8" name="story8">8. &mdash; THE JERMYN CREDIT
BANK</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Mar 30, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">WHEN I came to England I took charge, as I think
I have explained before, of the hundred and one departments which
were in some way or other associated with Intelligence. My task
was to co-ordinate the whole of the common service of
<i>Deutschtum</i>, to gather up all the strings in my own
fingers and to pull them, each to serve the higher purpose. One
of the most important branches of our work had been inaugurated
ten years before I came to England, and I think if you spent the
whole of those ten years guessing you would not divine how the
business which had been established was to serve Germany in her
hour of need.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have noticed, you who have been to London, a
modest yet substantial building in Jermyn Street, which is known
as the Jermyn Credit Bank. It is, or was, a very unpretentious
and serious building with a modest fascia and a small but imposing
interior. If you had not seen the place you would not fail to
have seen the advertisements of the bank which ran consistently
in most of the English papers.</p>

<p>The advertisement was as follows:</p><br>

<p class="quote">Gentlemen of position, officers of both services
and officials of the British or Indian Civil Service may arrange
loans on note of hand with the Jermyn Credit Bank. No security
required. Interest 7 per cent. per annum. Apply by letter, which
will be treated in the strictest confidence, to the Secretary,
Jermyn Credit Bank, 642, Jermyn Street, St. James's.</p><br>

<p>There was nothing flamboyant about the advertisement any more
than there was about the building. The advertisement occupied a
space of two inches in most of the newspapers, but generally in
the more respectable and conservative of newspapers. Those who
called by appointment were treated with the greatest courtesy.
They were ushered into the luxurious room of the manager, the
needs of the client were discussed, the question of security
delicately touched upon&mdash;there is always some security to be
had even though the advertisement made a point that none was
required&mdash;and loans were arranged, very often for
considerable amounts.</p>

<p>The bank was very popular with officers of the army and navy.
Men who found themselves in a tight corner blessed the name of
the Jermyn Credit Bank. If, when their bills came due, there was
any difficulty about payment there was certainly no difficulty
about renewing the document on a very reasonable basis.</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, it happened that the bank manager, a
polite and charming gentleman who was, alas! killed on the
western front by the treacherous English could not, with all the
best will in the world oblige the client. Needy professional men,
doctors, lawyers and unimportant journalists would learn what
even with their security the golden coffers of the Credit Bank
remained tightly closed. But to any officer, especially to an
officer who had the magic letters P.S.C. after his name, or any
head of a civil department or any naval gentleman, who had won
the slightest distinction and promotion in his profession, might
be assured that if not the whole, at least part of his
necessities were met.</p>

<p>The business grew to an extraordinary extent. One officer
would introduce another. Mr. Rosenberg the manager, would
occasionally give little dinner parties, to which he invite one
of his more exalted clients, on the understanding that he would
bring two or three friends. I cannot say that the business was
particularly prosperous from our point of view, but there were
singularly few bad debts, and I do not suppose it cost the
Fatherland more than £10,000 a year to secure an intimate
financial history of every officer serving in the army plus a
pull over such of the bank's clients as were in its debt. For men
who borrow money are very grateful and a grateful man is
talkative, especially if conversation is assisted by a little
Veuve Clicquot and a chic dinner, and what is more natural than a
man should talk about his brother officers and their financial
positions?</p>

<p>The bank had the reputation&mdash;so valuable&mdash;that it
never dunned its clients or brought an action against even the
most backward and unfaithful amongst them, and such a reputation
helped considerably when war broke out and Mr. Rosenberg was
called upon by his directors to resign immediately owing to his
German origin and his place was taken by Mr. Matthew Ritten, a
neutral gentleman of great integrity.</p>

<p>As the English army increased so increased the business of the
bank, for young officers are impecunious all the world over. I am
not going to say what steps were taken to secure information.
This, however I am willing to confess, that much news came to me
which otherwise I should not have heard, for Mr. Ritten gave
little dinners and went to clubs and met many men who were glad
to talk to one who was so enthusiastically an anti-German, and I,
Heine, sitting in my little Fleet Street office would receive
short notes in the code and would learn that the 10th Blankshires
and the division to which the 10th Blankshires were attached were
being withdrawn to General Reserve, and the 19th Wessex were
training for attack behind the lines and being taught by means of
models the topography of the country to the east of Lens.</p>

<p>For myself, I never went to the bank. If you had told me of
its existence I should have expressed surprise and wonder. I saw
the advertisements as everybody else saw them, but to me, Mr.
Ritten was a name and nothing more. We Germans have the
reputation of devoting too much attention to insignificant
details, but let me tell you, my friends, that the might of
Germany was built upon details, expanded on details, and came to
its highest and most world-defying decision in August, 1914 upon
the faith which we had in the detailed plan.</p>

<p>Though I despised the English Secret Service, though I could
shrug my shoulders and snap my fingers at these amateurs, I was
too much of a German to rush bull-headed into danger. Realizing
that Mister, or Major, Haynes, was a man of duplicity and low
cunning, I purposely avoided associating myself in the slightest
degree with the Jermyn Credit Bank, though it was originally the
idea of those who sent me to England that I should appear in
London in the capacity of manager of that bank.</p>

<p>One afternoon I had returned from the country, where I had
been superintending the erection of a temporary wireless plant
when my office-boy informed me that a man was waiting to see me.
I found him sitting on the edge of the table, smoking the stump
of a cigar. He was a tall man, rather broad, and by the fact that
he was wearing his hat in my office, and that the room was filled
with the rank smell of tobacco, I gathered that he was an
American of the lowest class. He was dressed expensively but
loudly. He wore a great bunch of seals which dangled from a broad
silk ribbon, and had two diamond rings upon the little finger of
his right hand. He nodded as I came in, but did not attempt
either to take off his hat or to stand on his feet. For the
moment I did not recognize him.</p>

<p>"May I ask to what I owe the honour of this visit?" I demanded
politely.</p>

<p>"Cut all that out, Heine," he said coarsely, "Why, don't you
recognize our old friend, Big Jim?"</p>

<p>"Don't call me Heine," I said hastily. I recognized the man at
once. As one of the private detective staff of the Hamburg-America
line, it had been my duty to keep an eye upon undesirable
characters, and Big Jim Riley was well known to New York as he
was to London as a "con" man. He used to work the boats of the
Hamburg-America line in the days before the war, and for some
time was one of a gang of crooks that spent their lives crossing
and re-crossing the Atlantic. Though we had many complaints about
the man, he had too big a pull in New York for us to interfere
with him. I had lived with Big Jim and his gang in at spirit of
camaraderie and tolerance which typifies the attitude of a shrewd
German detective to the criminal classes.</p>

<p>"Why, so it is," I said heartily, "but you must not call me
Heine, Jim."</p>

<p>"Ain't you a Dutchman?" he said.</p>

<p>"I never was a German!" I doubt whether he saw the subtle
correction. "I am a Chilean and I am happy to say that I hate the
Germans and all their work."</p>

<p>Big Jim's eyes opened wide. "Well, now, if that don't beat the
band," he said, "so that's your name, is it?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the name that was painted on the glass panel of
the door and I nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "I guess those people in New York have made
some mistake. Pretzl told me I was to come along and report to
you and that you might put some good work in my way. I don't care
what it is," he said, swinging his legs and puffing away at his
cigar, "anything short of a business that will send me to the
Chair is good enough for me."</p>

<p>"My dear Jim," I said mildly. "I am afraid Herr Pretzl is
under altogether a wrong impression."</p>

<p>How I cursed that interfering swine von Pretzl who had placed
my life and freedom in the hands of a common confidence man! I
have frequently warned von Papen that Pretzl was an old woman and
a fool. How much was I justified!</p>

<p>"See here, Heine," said Jim, speaking with great earnestness,
"I want some kinder job. There ain't any suckers left in the
world&mdash;I guess they're all gone to war. There's nothing
crossing the Atlantic now but Dago acrobats on their way to join
up with the Alpinis, and they're wrapped up so in life-savin'
suits that they couldn't get at their wad even if they wanted to
give it to you. Them and feeble-minded old men and women are all
the passengers there are &mdash; and women as you know are meaner
than hell when it comes to a show-down of real money. I've been
across three times dodging submarines and mines and all I could
raise was a game of auction bridge at two cents a hundred. Now
you know the ropes here. Put me wise to a few."</p>

<p>I thought rapidly. He might be a useful man. Then again he
might be a source of grave danger. A man of that character would
not come to England without the British police force being
informed and probably he was shadowed. In the circumstances I
rejected any offer of personal help, but I gave him the address
of two or three gambling clubs and promised to call on the 'phone
a good friend of mine who was the proprietor of the largest. He
cheered up when I told him this.</p>

<p>"If there is money to be made," he said, "I am after it. Some
of these young officers have got plenty of money, you say."</p>

<p>"Some of them are worth millions," I said solemnly.</p>

<p>He shook hands heartily and I was glad to see the back of him.
I watched through the window his departure. There was a man
standing on the other side of the road, apparently watching the
traffic, but as soon as Jim made appearance and turned westward
the idler turned too. Of course he was watched. The imbecility of
sending such a man to me with all the interests I
represented!</p>

<p>I was in despair, but pulling myself together I put on my hat
and going out into the street hailed a cab and was driven off to
my club, where I told an amusing story to a few of the members
who were loafing in the smoke-room about the confidence man who
had come to me with a letter of introduction. I felt sure that
somebody would repeat the story, and in this I was not
mistaken.</p>

<p>I heard no more of Big Jim, though I saw him one night at
dinner at the Ritz-Carlton, and from his prosperous appearance I
gathered that he was not in any immediate want. My friend, to
whom I had given him an introduction told me that Jim had cleaned
up a lot of money one night at the gaming club, that he was
friendly with a number of officers, and that he had become
persona grata at a certain Bohemian club, the members of which
are mostly of the theatrical profession.</p>

<p>I remembered, when this was told me, that Big Jim, before he
began his nefarious career, had been an actor, if you can dignify
with such name one who travelled one-night stands with a
third-rate burlesque company and he was alternately comedian
and baggage man.</p>

<p>What I expected, and what did not occur, was a visit from the
police in regard to Big Jim. For this I was prepared, but
apparently the story I told at the club must have been reported
in the proper quarters, as I intended it should be, and nobody
questioned me as to my acquaintance with this undesirable
American.</p>

<p>Whatever place Big Jim may have occupied in my mind was
dispelled by a piece of news which came to me one morning whilst
I was in my bath&mdash;it was Friday, that being the day I
invariably bathe&mdash;which was of so remarkable a character,
and its possibilities so far-reaching, that nothing else occupied
my thoughts.</p>

<p>My servant knocked at the door and told me that there was an
urgent message awaiting me from "Mr Thompson". Now, "Mr Thompson"
was the telephone name for Mr Ritten, and dressing myself hastily
in my bath-wrap I hurried to the room I used as a study, knowing
that Ritten would not call at this unearthly hour unless
something important was afoot or unless he had secured some
information of an unusual character."</p>

<p>"It is I, Thompson," said the voice, "can I see you? It is
most important."</p>

<p>"My dear Thompson," I said testily, "you know very well that
it is impossible that we should meet."</p>

<p>"But I must see you," he said, "it is a matter of the first
importance. I cannot communicate over the telephone."</p>

<p>"Come then at once," I said, "bringing some documents which
would excuse your presence."</p>

<p>In ten minutes the bell of my flat rang, and Mr. Ritten was
ushered in. He was a suave, gentlemanly man, who was, I believe,
well born in his own country. With a preliminary apology for
troubling me, which I coldly dismissed, he laid before me the
object of his visit.</p>

<p>"I have had a request for a loan of £20,000 for seven days,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand pounds!" I was surprised at the largeness of
the sum. "That is an enormous amount. Who asks for it?"</p>

<p>"General Sir Stanley Magward!"</p>

<p>I whistled.</p>

<p>"Sir Stanley Magward!"</p>

<p>This was indeed a remarkable request. This general, as
everybody knows, commands one of the English Armies. He is a
famous strategist, and marked for further promotion.</p>

<p>"Here is the letter. It arrived this morning," said Ritten,
and passed me across a sheet of note-paper, which bore at the top
the inscription "Headquarters of the 9th Army."</p>

<p>The letter was brief and peremptory:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Sirs:</span></p>

<p class="letter">I am in need of £20,000 to pay off a mortgage
which falls due on my Somerset property this week. My
brother-in-law, Mr. Hiram S. Carter, the well-known railroad
magnate of America, is on the ocean homeward-bound, and I cannot,
therefore, get in touch with him. Upon his arrival the debt will
be liquidated. I agree to pay a sum equivalent to 10 per cent.
per annum for the accommodation. I apply to you because I have no
desire to let my banker into the secret of my embarrassment. I
shall be in London the day after to-morrow, on short leave. A
note delivered to the Senior Army Club will find me.</p>

<br>

<p>"Well?" said Ritten, when I pushed the letter back to him.</p>

<p>"By all means let him have the money," I said.</p>

<p>"You authorize it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I replied.</p>

<p>"I have made inquiries," said Ritten, "his brother-in-law is
on the homeward trip, but the date of his arrival is rather
uncertain. The mortgaged property is Penton Close, and the
mortgagees are the London and Manchester Bank."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"That explains why he does not wish to bother his bankers," I
said. "Send to the Senior Army Club and have the money ready for
the General&mdash;this may mean a lot to us. It is the kind of
connection that would be very useful."</p>

<p>Well might I feel elated. That an army commander should place
himself in the hands of money-lenders, and such money-lenders,
was distinctly a feather in my cap. It would not be well for my
Lord Magward that the mighty War Office should know one of their
trusted generals was borrowing money. On the other hand, it might
be well for the Jermyn Credit Bank, if any questions rose as to
its <i>bona fides</i>, that it had amongst its clients so august
a personage. Whichever I looked at it, it was all to the good.</p>

<p>The letter was despatched, and on the Monday Mr Ritten called
me up to say that the General was in his private office, and had
signed the necessary documents.</p>

<p>"Come round and meet him," suggested Ritten.</p>

<p>"Am I a fool?" I replied sarcastically.</p>

<p>"He is very interesting," said Ritten. "I have much to tell
you when I have time. He has invited me to go to France to his
headquarters, and to bring any friends I wish."</p>

<p>I could have hugged myself with delight.</p>

<p>"Accept the invitation," I said quickly, "also discover where
the headquarters the 9th Army are. Find out why he is on leave
for such a short time, and whether his army had many casualties
in the last offensive."</p>

<p>Ritten acknowledged my instructions and hung up the receiver,
and I sat down at my desk to formulate a plan for the forthcoming
visit which I intended to pay an important headquarters of the
British Army in the field.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have been working away for two hours when I
heard a commotion in the outer office, the door was flung
violently open and a tall broad officer dashed in, slamming the
door behind him. He was breathless and could not speak, He was
perhaps no more breathless than I, for he wore cross batons and
stars of a superior general, and across his broad chest were
three rows of medals, ribbons and decorations. He tore off his
gold-laced hat and wiped his brow.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, General," I began.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Heine," he gasped. "Forget that general stuff and
help me out this."</p>

<p>It was my turn to gasp.</p>

<p>"Jim," I said, "what is the meaning of it?"</p>

<p>He sank down into a chair.</p>

<p>"I have got away with £20,000 from a bank," he said rapidly.
"Gee, it was easy money, Heine. A bit of notepaper that I
borrowed from a kid on leave from one of these army headquarters,
a suit of clothes, and it was like taking money from a child. But
they're after me; one of those darned English officers spotted me
and asked me in the street who I was. I just had time to jump in
a cab and bolt."</p>

<p>The dreadful truth was slowly dawning upon me.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand pounds," I said, "you have got £20,000 from a
bank&mdash;from the Jermyn Credit Bank, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing," he said, "do you know them?"</p>

<p>I passed my trembling hand across my brow.</p>

<p>"Leave the money here in my desk, Jim," I said. " I will take
care of it; then, when the coast is clear, you can come back for
it."</p>

<p>"Give nothing," he said brutally. He walked across the room
and took a cautious glance from the window.</p>

<p>"I am going," he said, "they didn't pick me up."</p>

<p>"Don't go with that money," I cried in alarm, "it will be bad
if they catch you with the goods. Be a good boy and leave it
here," but before I could finish he had thrown open the door.</p>

<p>"Hell!" said Jim, as Major Haynes walked in.</p>

<p>"Friend of yours, Heine?" said Major Haynes; "dear me, what
excellent company you are keeping. I hardly know what to expect
next. I shan't surprised to find the Minister of War here one of
these fine days. How do you do, General?"</p>

<p>"Quit kidding," growled Jim.</p>

<p>"What horrible language for the commander of the 9th Army,"
said Mr Haynes, and then&mdash;I suppose you know it is an
offence to wear a uniform to which you are not entitled?"</p>

<p>It was now my turn to speak.</p>

<p>"This man," I broke in, "is a thief. He has robbed a certain
bank of a great amount of money."</p>

<p>"As to that I know nothing," said Major Haynes, "all that I am
concerned with is the fact that your friend is wearing a uniform
to which he is not entitled."</p>

<p>"He is a robber," I cried excitedly, "he has obtained by
trickery and fraud great amount of money."</p>

<p>"From the Jermyn Credit Bank?" asked Major Haynes in a tone of
interest, "the officers' friend, the help-one-another
association? How perfectly shocking!" He beckoned with his
finger and Jim and he left the room. I saw them drive away in a
cab together, and sat in an agony of apprehension, not only that
day but for the rest of the week. Then, one afternoon, Major
Haynes strolled into my office.</p>

<p>"Your friend, the General, has sailed," he said, "and you will
be pleased to learn that I took from him everything to which he
was not entitled."</p>

<p>"The money?" I said eagerly.</p>

<p>"The uniform," said Major Haynes; "I think he was entitled to
the money, don't you? As a matter of fact," he went on, "I will
ease your mind about the money. That also was taken from him, and
is now with the rest of the bank's credits&mdash;in the hands of
a British official."</p>

<p>I turned sick and faint.</p>

<p>"You are thinking of your friend von Ritten," smiled Haynes,
"He also in the hands of a British official!"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story9" name="story9">9. &mdash; MR. COLLINGREY,
MP&mdash;PACIFIST!</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Mar 23, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">I HAVE often said that there is something
grossly immoral about the profession of journalism. These men who
live on the woes of others, who batten on the miseries of the
world, must of necessity be dead to all kindly impulse and to the
gentler emotions. They must be sceptical of all that is good, and
have immeasurable faith in the wickedness of human nature. They
must have neither reverence for the great ones of the earth nor
charity for the sins of the weak.</p>

<p>My experience of journalists and of English journalists
particularly, had been with a Mister Haynes, who behaved with the
greatest treachery toward me, insinuated himself into my office
under false colours, for was he not an officer of the English
Intelligence Department and has he not, as I have reason to
believe, the blood of two high-spirited German youths upon his
gory hands?</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 1916, I learnt that Berlin was sending to me
a Swedish gentleman named Heigl, and I was ordered to follow his
instructions and to give him all the assistance which lay in my
power. I have a constitutional objection to the intrusion of
outsiders and more especially to amateur intelligence officers
who, in my experience, have never failed to bungle any task to
which they set their hands, so I cannot say that I viewed with
any enthusiasm the coming of Mr. Heigl, fraught as it would be,
and as I knew, with additional risks for myself&mdash;and
possibly the disorganization of the perfect system which I had,
with such labour, established.</p>

<p>Mr. Heigl proved to be a very pleasant gentleman, a merchant
of Stockholm, a short man with an untidy grey beard, well dressed
and having the appearance of prosperity. In fact, as I learnt, he
was a gentleman of considerable wealth, and though not well born,
even in a Swedish sense, he was a persona grata with the leaders
of the Conservative Party in Sweden and was frequently consulted
by his Government on all matters affecting trade.</p>

<p>Amongst other things he was the proprietor of a weekly
newspaper published in Stockholm. All this he told me within the
first hour of our meeting; in fact, on the way up from an East
Coast port to whither I had gone to meet him.</p>

<p>"You must understand, sir," he said with great affability,
which I need hardly tell you I returned, since he was the trusted
agent of my beloved country and was, moreover, a man who might be
able to put a few things in my way. One never knows when one
requires the help of a man of this description or, as we say in
Germany, "Don't refuse the carter the tyre, one day the wheel may
be yours."</p>

<p>To resume the record of our conversation.</p>

<p>"You understand, sir," he said, "that I am a citizen of a
neutral state and therefore, I can take no active part in any
propaganda designed to assist Germany."</p>

<p>"That is understood, excellent sir," I replied, "and, believe
me, I will not embarrass you to the smallest extent by requesting
your assistance."</p>

<p>He inclined his bead graciously.</p>

<p>"There are certain people in Berlin whom I have recently had
the pleasure of meeting. They are anxious that in this great
world war the German view shall not be entirely lost sight
of."</p>

<p>It was my turn to nod.</p>

<p>"The English press is not exactly friendly or inclined even to
print the German point of view, save to ridicule it."</p>

<p>"The English or British press, my dear sir," I said warmly,
"is a Government press. Every evening as is well known, the
Government send every newspaper the outlines of the leading
article which they will write. So cunningly contrived are those
leaders, that in some of them they criticize the Government, and
nobody outside the office would realize that all those articles
are written by a special band of writers who work day and night
in Downing Street."</p>

<p>He seemed interested at this news which was well known to me
and to many of my friends.</p>

<p>"But I interrupted you," I said, "pray forgive me."</p>

<p>"In Berlin," Mr. Heigl went on, "it is thought that an
excellent opportunity exists either for founding or for
purchasing a newspaper. It is understood that the
<i>Post-Herald</i> is for sale."</p>

<p>"That is so," I said, nodding. I did not know it before, but I
took his word for it. We Germans can never be caught napping.
"The price that is asked," Mr. Heigl went on, consulting a little
note-book which he drew from his waistcoat pocket, "is £100,000
that is to say, two million marks. It is a paper which has had a
great deal of influence in the past but seems to have fallen away
gradually until it has got into very low water indeed. We believe
that if we found the right man and spent a little money the paper
could be revived to its former prestige."</p>

<p>"Of that I am convinced," I said, "and it is a view which I
have often thought of advancing to Berlin. Believe me, Mr. Heigl,
I have not neglected the press. There is scarcely a newspaper man
in Fleet Street whom I do not know. I can tell you their
circulations, the family history of their editors, the names and
records of their principal correspondents."</p>

<p>He interrupted me with a little gesture.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to hear this," he said, "I had no idea that
you had taken the matter up. In fact, they thought that you were
unacquainted with the personnel of the newspapers."</p>

<p>I smiled a little bitterly. "Wilhelmstrasse is sometimes a
little unjust," I said, quietly and sadly.</p>

<p>"Now, what would you say the circulation of the
<i>Post-Herald</i> was?" asked Mr. Heigl.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate and tactless question to ask at the
moment, but I replied with readiness.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you until I have consulted my books. There are
so many newspapers in London and one cannot possibly keep their
circulations in one's head."</p>

<p>I could see he was a little impressed, and later he asked:
"Can you suggest a man to act as go-between? Neither you nor I
can buy the paper, but if we could only get hold of a good
substantial fellow, a bit of a crank preferably, we could easily
hide ourselves behind a bank and a lawyer and complete the
sale."</p>

<p>I knitted my brow and compressed my lips. "For the moment I
cannot," I said. "This is much too important a matter to be
settled off-hand."</p>

<p>I then proceeded like a good general, to examine the ground.
The <i>Post-Herald</i> is an old-fashioned Whig newspaper which
has fallen on evil times, due to the fact that it was owned by a
family all of whom took something out of its coffers, and none of
them put any brains in to its management. With true German
thoroughness, I discovered that it was deeply in debt to paper
manufacturers and to a syndicate of printing machine makers.</p>

<p>This poverty-stricken rag, without two penny pieces to rub
against one another, had the temerity to attack "unscrupulous
Germany." I confess when I opened the sheet and read the scathing
and vulgar abuse of our truly great <i>Kulturland</i>, I was
filled with righteous anger. But business is business. The
Fatherland has need of thee, <i>Post-Herald</i>. Thy columns
shall yet scintillate with sarcasm, not directed toward the
genius of Germany, but toward the vile and frivolous men who have
dared the wrath of Michael! Thy readers from these dull pages
shall imbibe the principles which have made Prussia feared, aye,
and hated the world over. Deutschland shall be vindicated in
triumphant and very clever articles written by professors of
learning and translated by English hack writers.</p>

<p>My spirits rose and my heart glowed within me at the thought
that I, Heine, should pull the strings and direct in the heart of
this great and sinister city a policy which should still further
enhance my beloved land.</p>

<p><i>Deutschland über Alles</i>! Also, I thought there might be
some commission on the purchase, for these things can be
arranged. The first thing to do was to find a go-between, a man
who could be implicitly trusted, and I began to ransack my mind
for a likely person. To put one of the known English pacifists in
control would be to give the show away, and to upset the
apple-cart, to employ two English idioms.</p>

<p>Collingrey was the man! It came to me in a flash of
inspiration. He was a member of Parliament and hard up, having an
extravagant wife and other obligations which my good German
modesty prevents my describing. He had been a failure as a
barrister, and a failure as a member of Parliament. He might have
held a position in the Government but for certain disclosures
which came to light in the matrimonial suit in which he became
involved.</p>

<p>During the war most of his questions and speeches in
Parliament had been directed against Italy&mdash;our perfidious
ally! There never was a man who so hated the Italian Government
as he, and with good reason, for Mr. Collingrey, a year before
the war started, had invested all his fortune in the purchase of
two pictures by that master, Leonardo da Vinci. The Italian
Government had prohibited the export of the pictures and when on
top of this a lawsuit was started, which involved the ownership
of these works of art, Collingrey got neither the pictures he had
bought nor the money he had spent.</p>

<p>He had stood to make a fortune, having resold these gems to
the American millionaire, Tilzer. The lawsuit dragged on, and
Collingrey had declared that the Italian Government was putting
every obstacle in the way of a settlement, and as the English
Government refused to give him any assistance, he was doubly
incensed.</p>

<p>He was, therefore, a bitter man, and never lost an opportunity
of embarrassing the Government. His articles appeared regularly
in those journals which we had subsidized&mdash;very few,
alas!&mdash;in this country. He had a reputation for honesty, was
a brilliant writer and a clever debater. The thing was to secure
his co-operation, and to convey to him, with as much delicacy as
possible, the policy which he would be called upon to support. I
have before me the draft of instructions which I received from
Berlin at a subsequent date, and I cannot do better than print
these:</p>

<p>1. The editor will adopt a conciliatory attitude toward
Germany and German War Aims. It is not necessary that the German
point of view should be urged, since this would defeat the object
aimed at. The Germans may even be attacked, though no
uncomplimentary reference to the Great General Staff to the
Kaiser, or to any member of the German royal family must be
permitted.</p>

<p>2. It is permissible to condemn air-raids or U-boat sinkings
in a decorous and serious manner, but at the same time a note
should be appended to the effect that whilst these things are
unfortunate, the English have largely themselves to blame for
failing at the beginning of the war to observe the distinction
between open and defended towns, and also for not observing the
Treaty of London.</p>

<p>3. At all times the editor must urge the necessity for
arriving at an understanding with Germany. The cost of the war,
the loss of life, must be deplored, and the possibility of
avoiding further losses by meeting the Germans at a peace council
must be insisted upon.</p>

<p>4. References to the taxation which will follow the war, and
how hardly it will fall upon the working classes as well as upon
the moneyed classes must be made frequently.</p>

<p>5. Whenever possible it should be hinted that the British have
no reason for continuing the war, and that they are being bled
white to support the insensate ambitions of France. French
military actions should, in consequence, be criticized as far as
possible.</p>

<p>6. Stories dealing with the humanity of the German soldier,
which will be supplied from time to time, should be given
prominence and references to German strikes may be made the most
of, especially at moments of industrial unrest in England.</p>

<p>These were only a few of the instructions. I cannot help
thinking that Wilhelmstrasse made a great mistake in its
moderation. If it had been left to me I would have instructed the
editor to lose no opportunity of attacking every other newspaper
which spoke slightingly of our great country &mdash; but then I
am a patriot!</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in getting an introduction to Collingrey,
and he invited me to dine at the British House of Commons. In a
few words over a post-prandial cigar I explained the object of my
visit. The good friend whose letter of introduction had procured
the interview had smoothed my path by representing me to be an
agent of a South American rancher (name unknown) who desired to
break into London society, and in tones of gentle but amused
tolerance hinted at my client's vanity. Mr. Collingrey readily
undertook to act as go-between. He entered into the spirit of the
matter with great enthusiasm, and when I met him two or three
days later he produced two manuscripts dealing with the Italian
Government which he read to me in the lobby of the House of
Commons. When the purchase was completed and the
<i>Post-Herald</i> had passed into the possession of a certain
syndicate, which it is not advisable to name, he had manuscript
on Italy in every pocket.</p>

<p>Having done my part of the work and taken the small commission
which was my right, and having seen Mr. Heigl safely on his
journey back to Stockholm, I had little time to bother about the
newspaper, the more so since Berlin in its folly had decided that
I was not to interfere in its management.</p>

<p>I bowed respectfully to the high authorities and to the
well-born gentlemen who directed Germany's policy, but I submit
in all humility that had Heine been at the helm much that
subsequently happened might have been avoided.</p>

<p>Mr Collingrey carried out his instructions faithfully, and
when they were explained with more elaborate detail he accepted
his orders (to my surprise) without demur or question. His vivid
leading articles on the Italian Government attracted a great deal
of attention and led to a strict application of the censorship,
but this only gave him a new interest in life, namely, in so
couching his words that he could do the maximum amount of damage
to his enemies without incurring censure. He was gentle with
Germany, restrained in his reference to the U-boats, never spoke
of the Kaiser except as the Emperor William, and his references
to labour were invariably quoted in the extreme organs of the
masses. He was indeed a most satisfactory person, and I have in
my possession a letter addressed to me by the noble-born Count
von Mazberg, the head of our propaganda department,
congratulating me upon my most excellent choice. This I can show
to any interested person who doubts my word, and especially to
those, evil-minded un-German journalists who have so often
attacked me and my work.</p>

<p>I was out of London a great deal, being concerned in
consultation with certain labouring men who desired to bring the
war to an end by an understanding with Germany. These English
patriots were organizing a strike, and, naturally, I rendered
them all the assistance that lay in my power. This meant that I
had to travel with a great deal of money and could not afford to
allow my attention to be distracted from the business at
hand.</p>

<p>I arrived in London one evening and on reaching my flat
discovered an urgent telegram from Mr. Collingrey asking me to
dine with him at the Carltonia Hotel, as he had news of the
greatest importance. I immediately changed into my evening dress
and drove down to the hotel where the editor was waiting
impatiently. He was happier than I have ever seen him. His thin,
cadaverous face was wreathed in smiles, as he heartily shook my
hand, brushing aside the compliments on his conduct of the paper
which I had prepared.</p>

<p>"Come and have dinner, my boy," he said. "I have got great
news."</p>

<p>"I am delighted to learn this," I replied. "Have you got one
in the eye for Italy, if you will pardon the expression?"</p>

<p>"Oh, much better."</p>

<p>Grasping my arm he led me into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"After all," he said as we sat down at the table, "perhaps I
have been rather unkind about Italy&mdash;my articles have borne
fruit."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? " I asked in surprise.</p>

<p>He chuckled as he unfolded his serviette.</p>

<p>"They have released my pictures, my dear fellow," he said,
"you have no idea of the weight there is off my mind. It means a
tremendous lot to me&mdash;my fortune and my wife's was invested
in those infernal daubs. Look here," he took a piece of paper
from his pocket and passed it across to me. It was a cablegram
which had been handed in at New York that morning:</p>

<p>Agree to your price, hundred and fifty thousand dollars for da
Vinci pictures. Ship them by first mail boat in charge of
reliable man.&mdash; Titzer.</p>

<p>"We will have a bottle of champagne on this."</p>

<p>"But what induced the Government to take this step?"</p>

<p>"The lawsuit is ended," said Mr. Collingrey, "and ended in my
favour. I tell you it has taken ten years off my age."</p>

<p>He babbled on like a boy, but presently he grew calmer and we
discussed the policy of the paper, and I was glad to see that he
still retained those honest convictions about Germania which had
ever distinguished his writings.</p>

<p>It was just about this time that America was trembling on the
verge of war, when the unscrupulous Wilson was making his
preparations to commit the great crime against civilization of
plunging his country into the horrors of strife, for me it was a
time of the greatest stress and anxiety. Cablegrams from certain
neutral countries reached me every hour. Secret and confidential
wireless messages from the supreme political chiefs reached me
through the usual channels.</p>

<p>The excuse the Americans made was the initiation by our
Admiralty of an unrestricted U-boat campaign against the munition
ships of the Allies and it was still hoped by the superlatively
clever men who guide the helm of the German state that war might
be avoided. On a night I shall never forget I received a message
from Amsterdam which I decoded. It ran:</p>

<p>VERY URGENT.&mdash; To Chief S.S. Agents, London, Madrid,
Paris, New York, Stockholm, Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Editors and directors of friendly and subsidized papers must
be instructed to deal sympathetically with U-boat campaign. Point
out iniquity blockade which is starving German women and
children, and suggest a compromise between Germany and her
enemies. Endeavour counteract enemy propaganda which will be
unusually virulent. Prepare articles and comments in this vein.
Acknowledge to chief of staff.</p>

<p>I wrote a brief note embodying these instructions to Mr.
Collingrey, telling him that the South American, the mythical
proprietor of the <i>Post-Herald</i> was a big shipowner, and
desired to save the shipping of the Allies. This I despatched by
special messenger and immediately dismissed the matter from my
thoughts for, as I say, I had not only the organization of a
great strike but also I had to condense the very heavy reports
which were coming through from our agents in the various shipping
centres. I worked till three o'clock in the morning and then
snatched a few hours' sleep.</p>

<p>At seven I was at my task again with all the newspapers ready
for perusal. Naturally I turned to the <i>Post-Herald</i> first.
Here I knew I had material for a good report and with my code
book open in front of me, I was preparing to translate the
leading article into language which would pass the censor for
transmission to Holland.</p>

<p>I opened the paper. There was the leading article, but to my
amazement it was headed:</p>

<p>GERMAN MURDERERS AT THEIR FOUL WORK.</p>

<p>I gasped. From the very first word to the very last the
article was the bitterest, the most vehement, the most
unscrupulous attack upon Germany that had ever appeared. I grew
red and white as I read it. It called the Germans assassins of
the sea, barbarians, Huns, <i>Boches</i>, pirates, blackguards,
thieves&mdash;I shudder as I recall the language which was used
by Mr. Collingrey.</p>

<p>I was in a maze, bewildered. I read on like a man in a bad
dream, conscious of the awful avalanche of fury which would sweep
down upon me when Berlin read this dreadful and disloyal article.
It was not till nearly the end of the leader that I began to
understand Mr. Collingrey's attitude. The final paragraph
ran:</p>

<p>"If any doubt existed that this nation of Hun marauders is
lacking in the elements of <i>Kultur</i>, that doubt is removed
by the wanton sinking of the Italian steamship <i>San
Salvadore</i>. It was an open secret that that ill-fated vessel
was carrying to England two great masterpieces of Italian art,
two priceless examples of Leonardo's genius. Did that fact stay
the barbarian's hand? Nay! Rather it lent zest to the lustful and
bestial representative of a savage and uncultured people.</p>

<p>"Those two masterpieces, unfortunately uninsured by their
owner, lie at the bottom of the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>"Let the British Government make instant reprisals. Intern the
aliens in our midst! Imprison and shoot secret agents whose evil
activity seducing the allegiance of our people, whose hands are
discernible even in the press itself."</p>

<p>I laid down the paper and wiped the perspiration from my brow.
I took up a pen to indite the traitor's dismissal, but on second
thoughts I put it down again. After all, it was not my idea. Let
Berlin do its own dirty work.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story10" name="story10">10. &mdash; THE GREY
ENVELOPE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Mar 16, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">IT was in 1917, in the early part of the year,
that, as a result of communications which had passed between
myself and our agent in Amsterdam, we decided upon opening the
most elaborate, and though I myself say it, one of the best
planned campaigns against the morale of the British that had ever
been undertaken. The occasion was the arrival amongst the enemies
of the Fatherland of the United States of America. The U.S.A., as
everybody knows, came into the war owing to the fact that the
munitions makers of America, who had spent millions of pounds on
plant, had found themselves faced with ruin. For this they had to
thank the perfidious behaviour of the British, who cancelled
their orders, well knowing that to keep all the American munition
factories running the American government would be compelled to
declare war.</p>

<p>I had this information from a dear friend of mine who is in
the secrets of Washington and was on terms of personal friendship
with many Senators and Congressmen, one at least of whom had
openly exposed the perfidious Wilson&mdash;such balderdash as his
speeches has never been uttered by serious statesmen!&mdash;and
his nefarious plan.</p>

<p>I had not lived in America for nothing. I knew how deep-rooted
was the detestation felt in America against the English. I
remember before leaving New York I dined with two true-born
patriotic Americans, the Mr. Shaun O'Gorman and Mr. Adolph
Dinklewurtt, who assured me solemnly, that any movement of the
President towards assisting the English would result in
revolution from one end of the country to the other.</p>

<p>I felt, therefore, that although the die had been cast, and
Wilson had committed the unforgivable and diabolical crime of
plunging America into war for chauvinistic aims&mdash;a
responsibility from which the unfrivolous mind reels in gasping
horror&mdash;there was still an opportunity for a man who could
think quickly and act instantly, providing always he had that
genius for organization which so few of my rivals possess.</p>

<p>It made it easier for me that America was intensely unpopular
with the English people. How they sneered at that expression of
his "Too haughty for war!" How they gibed at his notes and
derided his chauvinistic speeches! They refused to accept this
impertinent man, this ex-colonel of cowboy rough-riders, at his
own valuation, or to take his "big stick" speech in any but a
frivolous spirit.</p>

<p>Knowing this uncompromising hatred of the American, it did not
take me very long to set my agents working. Within a week the
country was ringing with stories of the behaviour of American
soldiers in Lancashire. You, yourself, must have heard of the
quarrel between the English and Americans which resulted in the
American being thrown into a river and drowned? It has probably
reached your cars that certain American soldiers, refused liquor
at a saloon, set fire to the house and decamped carrying with
them the hotel keeper's young daughter.</p>

<p>You may also have heard how all American soldiers spoke
despisingly of England and boast that they have come in to finish
the war. Some of these stories were more widely spread than
others, but all of them fulfilled one excellent
purpose&mdash;they brought annoyance to that ridiculous person,
Major Haynes&mdash;the so-called Intelligence Officer, under
whose nose the despised Heine worked so brazenly!</p>

<p>I do not pretend to know intimately the mentality of such men
as Major Haynes. I confess it is difficult for a plain-thinking
German, blunt and honest, to understand deceit for deceit's sake
(I justly absolve myself of all acts of deception performed on
behalf of the Fatherland), or to lower his moral vision to the
gutter wherein much slimy kultur flows.</p>

<p>To me, it is abhorrent that men should be so frivolous that
they should engage themselves in despicable undertakings for
wholly despicable reasons. That such a stigma applies to Major,
or Mister Haynes, I can prove by his own words.</p>

<p>Some time after my last encounter with him, we met in a cafe
in Fleet Street. I had gone in to drink a cup of coffee and smoke
a cigar when the swing doors opened and I saw the somewhat drab
and insignificant figure of Haynes enter. He walked in furtively,
almost apologetically. How different, I thought, would have been
the bearing of one of our German officers! He would have flung
the door open with a crash and have stood erect with flashing
eyes and haughty mien surveying the room ere he strode forward,
his sword clanking with every movement of his big earth-trembling
German feet.</p>

<p>Major Haynes came in timorously and seeing me came towards me.
My throat went dry with hate, my hands shook with righteous anger
and I felt myself go pale at the thought of his perfidy.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to be afraid of, as his first words
assured me. "Good evening, Heine," he said, "may I sit down with
you?" Here again, what a contrast to a major of the Highest
German Staff. He would have ordered me to rise and go to the
devil, and probably honoured me with a good German cuff on the
ear!</p>

<p>"Certainly, Major Haynes," I said, "this is indeed a pleasure
I did not anticipate. May I order you some coffee?"</p>

<p>He nodded and I summoned the waiter.</p>

<p>"It is such a long time since we met," I went on, "that I have
almost despaired of seeing you again. I began to fear that you
had been sent to the front."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that must have given you some sleepless nights,"
he said, foolishly. Why should this confounded hound imagine that
his departure for the front would disturb my rest? Such
arrogance!</p>

<p>"You may think I exaggerate," I said earnestly, "but believe
me, I have been much impressed by your personality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is curious that you should have said that," said Major
Haynes, "for I was just on the point of remarking how much I had
been impressed by your personality. You see, Heine," he went on,
noting, I trust, my modest surprise, "I have been watching you
pretty closely (my blood ran cold) and I realize how utterly
trustworthy you are and how different from other of the South
American neutrals one meets. I always have an admiration for the
Latin races and it is such a joy to meet a thorough-going South
American with a German name, and especially one so
whole-heartedly in favour of the Allies as yourself."</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said solemnly, "I have no interests but the
interests of the Allies. If I could shoulder a musket
to-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would look very silly," said Major Haynes crudely,
ignorant of the fact that I was speaking in a figurative sense,
because muskets are no longer carried, even by the German-trained
native troops of West Africa.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am certain you would fight, Heine, and I am certain it
is only he fact that you have a wife and family, that you are the
sole support of your ancient mother, and that you suffer from a
weak heart, which prevents your flinging yourself joyously into
the battle."</p>

<p>I inclined my head with a certain quiet dignity.</p>

<p>"You are pleased to jest, Major Haynes, for being an
Englishman you will have your joke, but I assure you in all
seriousness that if ever I could render a service to the Allies
you have but to command me."</p>

<p>Major Haynes looked at me for a long time. It would be true to
say that he stared very rudely before he spoke, but when he did
speak his words shocked me.</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I want you to do," he said slowly. I was
all attention, curious, and at the same time apprehensive. If he
had dared asked me to commit any action which would have injured
my beloved land I should have first smacked his face and then
shot myself, if I still lived.</p>

<p>"Command me," I said coldly.</p>

<p>Major Haynes looked around, then he lowered his voice.</p>

<p>"The matter I am going to discuss," he said, "is a delicate
one. I want you to upset one of the cleverest gangs of spies we
have had in this country, headed by a man who is without doubt
the biggest genius in the German Intelligence Department."</p>

<p>I blushed with gratification, even though those words of
praise were from an enemy, can you blame me? If my pleasure
overcame my fears, can you wonder?</p>

<p>"There is a man in England," Major Haynes went on, "who is
directing the real world of espionage. I am not referring to the
hacks that Germany employs to send her weather news and reports
on the effect of air-raids and movements of troops, but to the
big gang, the men who work in the dark, who go after the big
coups."</p>

<p>I nodded again, not I trust with any evidence of
self-complacence, but certainly in a spirit of pride, for I seemed
to realize more of my importance to the State when I heard my work
recounted in the cold and passionless language of a man whom I
regarded at that moment as one of the most intelligent
Englishmen I had ever met.</p>

<p>"They are the people we are anxious to get," said Major
Haynes, "and, I might add," he said, "to shoot."</p>

<p>I shivered, but hid my shiver in a laugh.</p>

<p>"Go on, dear Major Haynes," I said, "you interest me."</p>

<p>"I know the man I am after," said Haynes. (I clutched at the
table-cloth.) "But I have not been able to catch him. He has a
dozen aliases, but his real name is Professor Zollernborn."</p>

<p>"Zollernborn?" I said in astonishment.</p>

<p>I think it was at that moment that my quick German brain
grasped the situation. Professor Zollernborn was in Berlin. The
clever Major Haynes did not know that only that morning I had
received instructions from the Herr Professor. I saw the trap
plainly, but from my impassive face Major Haynes would never have
known the rapid, lightning-like thoughts which were flashing and
crackling in my brain.</p>

<p>It was a trap for Heine! Beware and walk warily, thou faithful
servant of government! Match thy wits against this dull
Englishman and put him in the soup!</p>

<p>"Indeed," I said.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe," this so-called Intelligence
Officer went on, "that a document of a very important character,
which in some mysterious way recently disappeared for twenty-four
hours from the papers of the Director-General of Recruiting, will
be transmitted to Berlin&mdash;or rather a copy of that document,
which is in such a code that it cannot be forwarded by
wireless."</p>

<p>"In what way can I help you?" I asked, playing my part in the
farce with admirable sang-froid.</p>

<p>Major Haynes leant back and thrust his hands in an
ungentlemanly manner in his trousers' pockets.</p>

<p>"I am going to put all my cards on the table, Heine, all
except the ace," he said. "It cannot have escaped your notice
that you have been associated with people who have been very
naturally the objects of suspicion. Two or three gentlemen with
whom you have had dealings&mdash;in a perfectly innocent manner,
I am sure&mdash;have paid the penalty for espionage. I know what
you are going to say," he said, checking my indignant protest
with a shake of his head, "that you know nothing about their
nefarious work? Quite right, I can believe it. But for some
reason or other, Heine, they think, these enemies of the
government, that you are favourably disposed to help them."</p>

<p>"Then they make a very great mistake," I said firmly, "and if
they ask me to assist them I shall be extremely annoyed."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"So I think. And yet they will ask you to assist them. The
document in question will pass from hand to hand. Sooner or later
it will fall into your possession and on the envelope will be the
address of another agent to whom you will deliver it. It will
probably be thrust into your pocket when you are walking along
the street and somebody will whisper in your ear 'Frieburg,'
which means, 'you have something which must be passed on without
delay.'"</p>

<p>As he proceeded the perspiration was pouring from
me&mdash;indeed that night when I came to change my undervest (it
being Friday) I found it quite damp. "Frieburg" was the password
which we used in the sense that Major Haynes had stated. What
traitor betrayed his Fatherland and placed this stupid officer in
possession of our code will perhaps one day be known and his name
will be execrated from one end of Germany to the other.</p>

<p>"But," I said, calming myself, "how should I know what
'Frieburg' meant if you had not told me?"</p>

<p>"You would probably be notified by letter," said the Major
suavely, "at any rate, you will know."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" I asked. The scheme was now to me as plain
as daylight. I was suspect, and this was a trap for me. How was
the trap to be sprung?</p>

<p>"The moment you find yourself in possession of that letter you
will bring it to me," said Major Haynes.</p>

<p>"Of course, I could have you watched all the time but I could
not be searching you every five minutes, and I could never know,
unless you assisted me, when you were in possession of this
interesting document. I could even have you arrested now," he
shrugged his shoulders cold-bloodedly, "but that would not help,
because another agent would be found."</p>

<p>"You want me to bring you the latter as soon as I receive it?"
I said.</p>

<p>"That is all I ask," said Major Haynes.</p>

<p>I offered him my hand and smiled.</p>

<p>"On the word of a sportsman and a gentleman," I said, "I will
bring it to you."</p>

<p>I walked down Fleet Street whistling a tune. Even in that
moment of danger Heine's well-balanced mind was not seriously
perturbed.</p>

<p>"I shall know no danger until I am blind," said Schiller, and
so might I say, for with my eyes open to the plot which was being
laid against me half the danger vanished. The cleverness of it,
the cunning underhandedness of it! I was suspect. They had no
evidence against me and they wanted to secure proof that I was a
dirty devil of a German. A police agent would hand me the
envelope. I should probably find the name of a comrade inscribed.
I would be watched all the time and if I attempted to escape with
the spurious document I should be arrested.</p>

<p>I have a much better plan, dear Mister, or Major, Haynes! Into
thy guilty hands will I deliver this fake or dud, document, and
shall stand with quiet, smiling contempt, watching thy confusion,
when thou discoverest that Heine, with bland innocence, has
carried out thy wishes!</p>

<p>Two days later I was called up to the telephone and a strange
voice speaking with a German accent said: "Be prepared for
'Frieburg' to-day," and immediately rang off.</p>

<p>I chuckled my amusement. So this was the day for the plot to
materialize. I went about my work in the usual manner. I lunched
at a fashionable restaurant in the Strand, returned to my office,
finished up my work at 5:30, and strolled, as is my wont,
westward.</p>

<p>It was whilst making the purchase of a paper at the bookstall
at Piccadilly Tube Station that the thing happened. Somebody
pressed close to me. I heard the word "Frieburg" whispered in my
ear, and when I had disengaged myself from the crowd and
carelessly put my hand in my pocket I found a somewhat bulky
envelope which, as I felt with my fingertips, was heavily
sealed.</p>

<p>I walked down Piccadilly and turned into the park, and
presently found my way to a quiet spot. Making sure that I was
free from observation, I pulled the envelope from my pocket,
pretending to take out a handkerchief which I had previously
pocketed, and examined the letter.</p>

<p>It was enclosed in a big grey envelope and was addressed in
English:</p>

<p class="cp">"<i>Deliver without delay to out agent in
Southampton.</i>"</p>

<p>I put the envelope and handkerchief back. The solution of
Major Haynes' plot became ridiculously simple. It was not only a
test for me, but it was an attempt to discover who was the agent
of the Government at Southampton. Could you not imagine me
driving off to Waterloo followed by Secret Service men, and
shadowed until I met and betrayed the brave fellow who overlooked
the interests of Deutschland in Southampton?</p>

<p>Five minutes later I was out of the park, hailing a taxi
cab.</p>

<p>"Drive me to the War Office," I said in a loud voice, for the
benefit of a skulking loafer who was nearby, and who was probably
a detective in disguise.</p>

<p>Immediately on my arrival, I sent up my card and was ushered
into Major Haynes' office. He jumped up as I entered.</p>

<p>"Have you got it? " he said eagerly. For answer I handed him
the grey envelope, and he seized it.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Heine. Excuse my agitation," he said, "but I had a
feeling that they would try you."</p>

<p>I looked at him in wonder for, for the first time in his life,
the major was agitated. He pressed a bell and a soldier came
in.</p>

<p>"Will you ask General Brackenhurst if he can come," he said.
If Major Haynes's excitement was astonishing, what shall I say of
a staid and veteran staff general, who tore the wrappings from
the envelope, eagerly scanned the unfolded pages and gave a loud
and vulgar cry of joy.</p>

<p>"It is the original, Haynes!" he said. "Thank God we've got
it!"</p>

<p>"They haven't taken a copy, you think?"</p>

<p>"It was the copy they sent back," said the general, wiping his
forehead, "it is impossible to make a copy of this. That is how
we detected the theft. This is the original. In this code a
pin-point's difference in the position of the letters would have
made all the difference. That is why they are trying to send it to
Germany, because they couldn't translate it here."</p>

<p>He turned and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Is this the gentleman who assisted us?" he asked, and shook
me warmly by the hand.</p>

<p>"We owe you a great debt of gratitude, sir," he said. "As
Major Haynes has told you, this document, if it fell into the
hands of the enemy, would have been of inestimable value to the
Germans."</p>

<p>If it was acting it was good acting. My German instinct told
me that it was not acting at all. I knew by the trembling of my
knees that I had misjudged the position, and I left the War
Office like a man in a dream. Only one thing remained to be done.
I left that evening for Southampton, and was fortunate enough to
see our agent in the vestibule of a theatre; I whispered
"Frieburg" in his ear, and put my hand in his pocket, but I did
not leave any letter. Let him explain it if he can!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story11" name="story11">11. &mdash; THE
MURDERERS</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Mar 9, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">IN the latter days of March, 1915, I had
received a communication from headquarters which was contained in
a box of Dutch cigars forwarded to me from Rotterdam. It was
written to me on the usual grey paper and was neatly sandwiched
between the two thin pieces of wood which formed the bottom of
the box. You would never think of splitting the bottom of a
cigar-box into two shavings in order to discover a message from
the Political Intelligence Department would you? Such was German
ingenuity. The communication may be given in full:</p>

<p class="typewriter">Kriegsministerium,</p>

<p class="typewriter">Berlin. March 12, 1915</p>

<p class="typewriter">By order of Section 10, Politik, Great
General Staff.</p>

<p class="typewriter">There go to England, on March 16, two
men</p>

<p class="typewriter">(1) Carl Jan Kattz<br> (2) Rudolph
Kister</p>

<p class="typewriter">convicts from the Imperial Prison at
Dresden under sentence for (1) Murder and robbery, (2) Dangerous
wounding and burglary. These two men speak English and are
acquainted with English life and conditions. They are released on
condition that they place themselves at the disposal of the Chief
of the Intelligence Bureau in London. These men may be depended
upon to perform the most desperate acts. They will be placed on
the pay-list of the C. of I., London, at 10 marks each per diem
and 20 marks each per diem for normal expenses. The C. of I.,
London will not hesitate to shoot either man in the event of his
failure to carry out orders.</p><br>

<p>I confess that my first care was to keep this precious pair of
rascals as far away from me as possible. I could not have such
hang-dog cut-throats haunting my office, and I sent Wilhelm
Peters to meet them and install them in lodgings in
Coventry&mdash;which was one of the towns I was not likely to
visit.</p>

<p>Wilhelm informed me that they preferred to go to Wednesbury,
as they were both acquainted with glass-working and there were
two or three glass factories in that town at which they could
work. I made arrangements for them to receive their weekly
stipends, registered their addresses, and sent them the card code
(which was ingeniously got up in the form of a time-table) and
dismissed them from my thoughts with the earnest hope that it
would never be necessary to utilize their services.</p>

<p>For we Germans abhor deeds of darkness and violence. Who has
looked through the spectacles of a serious German boy and has
seen his clear and honest blue eyes shining thoughtfully, could
ever question either the gentleness of his disposition or the
transparency of his motives. We hate deceit and cruelty, we
shrink from the infliction of needless pain and exalt the
fulfilment of the law to a worship.</p>

<p>So I shuddered and passed from my mind all thought of Carl Jan
Kattz and Rudolph Kister. And yet, despite this innate tenderness
of ours, we Germans are all granite and iron. When we set
ourselves to the accomplishment of a task we are not to be
arrested by parsnip-buttering words or even the allurement of the
most indecorous siren, as you shall see. I have referred to the
assistance I offered to our gallant Zeppelins by the triangle of
lights.</p>

<p>One of these Light stations was arranged in the stable-yard of
a good Polish friend named Jabowski. The yard was a small one
shut in on three sides by very high walls, and on the fourth by
the stable. (Jabowski was a tailor in a large way of business,
and employed to carts for the collection and distribution of
goods). He hated the English, who had treated him very scurvily
and had prosecuted him for some small breaches of the Factory
Act, and he was, in consequence of his tyranny-hatred, and for a
very handsome sum I paid him, willing to show the light&mdash;a
motor head-lamp coloured green.</p>

<p>One night after a raid was expected Jabowski came to see me. I
had just got back from an over-night trip to Bristol and I was
eager for news. He seemed puzzled and troubled.</p>

<p>"Was there a raid?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, Herr Heine," he said, "there was&mdash;but it was the
most curious raid we have had. I came to tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Proceed, Jabowski," said I graciously, although he was a man
of the lowest social order.</p>

<p>"At eleven o'clock last night my son and I were standing in
the yard, watching the lamp and listening for the footfall of a
policeman outside, when we heard distinctly the noise of an
airship; it grew nearer and nearer until the sound was terrific
and I could hear the people in the street scurrying away to their
houses. I looked up, as did my son, but I could see nothing.
Whatever it was passed overhead and when immediately over
something fell with a thud&mdash;right in the centre of the
yard!"</p>

<p>"A bomb?"</p>

<p>"No, gracious Herr&mdash;it was a big paper bag which was
evidently filled with a sort of yellow dust. Thinking it was a
new kind of poison or some diabolical&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ingenious is the word, Jabowski," I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Exactly, gracious sir, some dangerous form of explosive. I
did not attempt to remove it until this morning. I gathered most
of it up but it was impossible to remove the stain from the
stones."</p>

<p>"There were no bombs?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Jabowski with emphasis, "the raider was heard
by many people and, according to a policeman who came to see me
this morning, these yellow bags have been dumped all over the
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>I was thoughtful. What did these bags portend? Obviously there
was a message of some kind, thought I, intended for me. That
green light showed the raider that there was a friend in the
neighbourhood and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>Whilst I was talking, there was a knock at the hall-door of my
flat, and my servant (an excellent Swiss youth who had the good
fortune to be born in Breslau, of German parents) announced that
the two Mr. Geisslers wished to see me. I was amazed at the
coincidence, for these two brothers were in charge of the two
other lamps which completed the triangle.</p>

<p>"Show them into my bedroom, and I will come and see them,
Adolph," said I.</p>

<p>The Messrs Geisslers were bakers, and good friends of their
Fatherland. One had a shop near Albany Park, and the other a
bakehouse south of the Thames.</p>

<p>"Victor came over to see me this morning, Herr Heine,"
explained Kurt Geissler, the elder of the two, "and as he has had
the same curious experience that I had in last night's raid, I
thought we had better come along and see you."</p>

<p>Briefly his narrative was on all four-legs with the story
which Jabowski had told. They had heard the whirr of airship
engines, and a bag of yellow dust had fallen, in Victor's case
upon the roof of the bakehouse, and in Kurt's case on a chicken
house in his back garden.</p>

<p>"The police say that these bags have fallen over the South of
London," said Kurt.</p>

<p>"They've been dropped on north-west London too," said Victor,
and produced an envelope full of the stuff. I looked at it
without touching the powder. It was as fine as flour.</p>

<p>"You must leave me to think this matter out," I said at last,
and sent them on their way.</p>

<p>I was engaged in intensive cogitation half an hour later, when
Major Haynes, of the British Intelligence Department, called.
While I at first resented his calling, I had now overcome my
repugnance to meeting one who was engaged in such underhanded and
sneaking work as the Military Intelligence Department condescend
to do. We Germans have a delicate gorge, I told you, and there
were times when, remembering that his sly cunning had probably
sent many, and had certainly sent two brave Germans to their
death, I could scarcely bring myself to flatter him.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Major," said I with a readily-adopted
smile, "you are looking inside the pink this morning."</p>

<p>"Good morning, Heine," he said. He had called me "Heine" many
times lately, and somehow I never had the nerve the correct him.
"Were you in the raid last night?"</p>

<p>"The raid?" I said in innocence&mdash;amazed. "I saw nothing
about it in the papers&mdash;was there a raid?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "So some people think," he said, and then turning
suddenly from the subject he asked, "What size gloves do you
take?"</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary question. All my wits were working at
top pressure. I was at my alertest, my mind reviewing all the
circumstances which had attended my doings of the past week. Had
I left a finger-print in my visit to the Chetwell Munition Works,
or dropped a glove on my recent conference with the executive of
the Workers for World Peace?</p>

<p>"I take an eight or nine size," I said deliberately.</p>

<p>"That would be much too large&mdash;show me your hands." I
extended my hands. Why did a cold and sickly feeling come into a
certain digestive organ? Why did the beads of perspiration stand
out on my brow? Why, in spite of a mental effort of the
strongest, did my face blanch and my hand tremble? Did I expect
to hear the click of steel, and feel chill hands about my wrists,
and hear the jangle of the link that holds handcuffs together?
Yet none of these things happened. Mr. or Major Haynes just took
my hands in his and turned them over with the same delicacy of
touch that I have observed in the German <i>Hausfrau</i> when she
is buying fish, and turns over the soles on the stall to find the
biggest.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a seven," said the major, and I thought there was a
note of disappointment in his tone.</p>

<p>We chatted about the war for a while and then he said good-bye
and left me with two puzzles to solve instead of one. Fortunately
the rest of the day was so fully occupied with sheer routine work
that I had not time to speculate upon the mystery of the Yellow
Raid, as I called it.</p>

<p>I had started two new societies, The Brotherhood of Humanity
and the Thinkers of Britain League, and these entailed an
enormous amount of correspondence. The former society had as its
motive the elimination of all wars; the latter was intended to
bring together under one aegis that considerable body of students
and tractarians who regarded frontier lines as artificial
limitations set up to divide the many for the benefit of the few.
They were promising plants, and though I hoped that Germany would
never need to seek a peace but would triumph in the field that
she would be able to dictate her terms to greedy England,
bare-legged Scotland, libertine France, and barbarian Russia, yet
we Germans are habitually cautious.</p>

<p>That night I learned from the usual quarter that the weather
was propitious for a Zeppelin raid, and warned the "leaders" (the
car drivers whose powerful headlamps guided the Zeppelins to
their destinations) and my signal friends, before I left town by
the 8:30 train for Bath. I got on the 'phone to London that night
and discovered that no raid had occurred, and returned by the
early morning train which reaches Paddington at 8:30. My new
assistant, Mr. Wilhelm Peters, was waiting for me at the
flat.</p>

<p>"Bad news, Herr Heine," he said.</p>

<p>"Tell me," I replied.</p>

<p>"Jabowski and the two Geisslers were arrested last night in
the act of signalling."</p>

<p>That was bad news indeed. I learnt that they had been raided
practically at the same hour by three parties of police, and had
been taken to Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>"I have been all night at work making inquires," said Peters,
"and I have discovered how they were detected."</p>

<p>"Betrayed, of course," said I, but to my surprise Wilhelm
shook his head.</p>

<p>"They betrayed themselves," he said, "the raid of the previous
night was not a raid at all. The noise they heard was that of an
English dirigible balloon flying at a very low altitude. It was
up looking for signal lights, and detected Jabowski's light
first. It flew over the yard and dropped a bag of yellow ochre as
near the light as possible, and on the following morning the
police went round the neighbourhood with a story of a mysterious
airship which had been throwing such things. When they said that
the airship had dropped many they lied. There were only three
bags dropped&mdash;on Jabowski and the two Geisslers. Once the
stain of the ochre was discovered, the police had only to wait a
favourable opportunity. The rumour of a coming raid was
circulated all over London for the purpose of deceiving us."</p>

<p>I saw the thing clearly now. So that was why Mr., or Major
Haynes had come to my office. He thought that some of the yellow
stuff would be brought to me for my inspection, and that I would
handle it! So you are interested in the size of my gloves, my
officer! So you would inspect my hands, thou artful man of low
cunning!</p>

<p>But Heine had been too clever&mdash;too wide-awakened! I could
not deny myself so much exhilaration of feeling, yet the position
was a serious one. The Geisslers I could trust. But Jabowski!
Here was a man without a country&mdash;a cringer, a born
traitor, one who under pressure to save his own miserable skin
would not hesitate to betray me and the sacred cause for which I
worked.</p>

<p>Whatever doubts I had about the loyalty of Jabowski were
removed when his son came to see me that afternoon. This young
Jabowski was about twenty-five years of age, very dark, with a
curly head of hair and a long yellow face. He was dressed
fashionably (and a little above his class) in a check suit and a
yellow tie, and wore the diamond ring and scarf-pin that one
would rather have expected on a German gentleman than on a Polish
tailor!</p>

<p>I was annoyed to see him.</p>

<p>"Why do you come here?" I asked, when he was shown into my
room. "How dare you come to my apartments?"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Heine, I wasn't watched," he said. "I came by
Tube and what's more, I waited till it was dark. I suppose you
know that the old man's pinched?"</p>

<p>"The old man pinched?" I said in astonishment-simulation,
"What old man&mdash;and what pinch?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come off it," he said coarsely, "you know what I'm
talking about&mdash;my father, Mr. Jabowski."</p>

<p>"For Mr. Jabowski I have the highest respect," I said, "and I
have had many dealings with him, strictly in the way of business.
Do I understand he has been arrested? Dear, dear&mdash;I trust he
has not been doing anything very naughty?"</p>

<p>The young man scowled at me. "Look here! " he said with
violence, "you know why he was pinched&mdash;for giving Zepp
signals at your instructions."</p>

<p>I sprang up, "Shameless, lying Jew!" I cried in a great voice,
"traducer of innocent truly-neutrals! How dare you&mdash;how dare
you make so infamous an accusation! By heavens! I've a mind to
grip you by the neck and your coat-tails, and hurl you from the
window!" I saw a look of fear creep into his eyes, but he did not
budge from his contention.</p>

<p>"Have sense, Heine," he pleaded, "can I allow my old man to be
shot? It's a terrible position for me, and I was getting married
to a widow-lady with money too. The disgrace will kill me!"</p>

<p>"Your father can prove nothing against me," I said, and the
miserable fellow smirked.</p>

<p>"That's where you're wrong," he said, "the old man was too
wide for you. 'Jacob,' says he to me, 'this Prussian is so
careful that he won't put anything in writing. If I get into
trouble, he'll pretend he doesn't know me, so when he comes this
afternoon to talk things over in the stable yard, get your camera
and take a snap of us together,' and," said the despicable young
man in unmistakable tones of pleasure, "I've got that photograph
to show the police unless you do something to get my father out
of trouble."</p>

<p>"Have you the photograph with you, my dear young man?" I asked
with mildness.</p>

<p>"Am I nutty?" replied Jabowski junior.</p>

<p>I promised to give him an answer that night. What could I do?
To whom could I turn to secure the release of this misguided and
fearfully threatening Pole? That he would betray me I did not
doubt, and the horror of the thought stunned me. I had escaped
the graver perils. I had incurred the suspicion of the highest
authorities and had yet won through. It was because I had tricked
them with the bluff of the experienced player that I had escaped
detection. Even Major Haynes believed that I was no more than a
dupish fool&mdash;but would he believe as much on such an
accusation supported by visible evidence of hob-nobbing with the
dubious alien of Polish origin?</p>

<p>So they would trap me&mdash;me, Heine, who would not tread on
a turning worm, unless it turned against the Fatherland. My
gentle nature is notorious amongst my friends. The song of the
skylark rising to the dawn, the mist of bluebells in the shadowy
aisles of woods have made me cry like a child, and this dirty dog
of a Jabowski would send such a man as Heine to the execution
chair.</p>

<p>I sent a telegram to friends Kister and Kattz, at Wednesbury,
telling them to report to me in my apartments, by the first
train. If there were any burnt offerings required, it were better
for the Fatherland that the sacrifices should be Polish.</p>

<p>Let me describe Kattz and Kister as I saw them when they came
walking into my sitting-room. Kattz was a thin man of about
thirty-five. He was slightly bald, and he wore a pair of
steel-rimmed <i>pince-nez</i>. His face was thin and studious,
with deep furrows and wrinkles. He reminded me of a bust I once
saw of Dante. He was quietly and respectably dressed, and his
attitude and manner were subdued and respectful. His companion,
Kister, was of stouter build, and he bore a facial resemblance to
the English King Henry VIII. He was broad-featured, had a small
moustache and trim beard, and a rosy complexion. Like his
companion he was quiet in speech and deportment.</p>

<p>"Sit down, gentlemen," said I, greatly relieved by the
uncriminal appearance of my agents. "I will open a bottle of good
wine&mdash;in the meantime, help yourselves to the cigars."</p>

<p>They seated themselves, and when they had been made
comfortable, I briefly outlined the nature of my difficulty. "So
you see, gentlemen, my position," I concluded, "these two men
have the fate of our service in their hands."</p>

<p>"They must be put out of the way," said the jovial-faced
Kister, "you agree, my dear Kattz?"</p>

<p>Mr. Kattz nodded.</p>

<p>"We can settle the younger man very easily," he said, "you
have his address, of course?"</p>

<p>I inclined my head. "You will probably find that he has the
photograph in his pocket, in spite of his protest," he went on.
"I can get on to him to-night."</p>

<p>He felt in his pocket and drew out a short length of cord, to
the ends of which were fastened two small wooden handles. He
unrolled the cord which was wound about the sticks and re-rolling
it, returned the instrument to his pocket. The jovial Mr. Kister
frowned and shook his head.</p>

<p>"You know, my dear Kattz, I would not hurt your feelings, but
I feel compelled to demur at that method of yours. I believe in
this." With a dexterity which hardly seemed possible, he slipped
a long-bladed knife from the inside of his waistcoat. I pushed my
chair back a little.</p>

<p>"The knife or nothing, I say," said he, "it is noiseless, it
is instantly effective it can be used in a crowd, and the victim
will not utter a sound. Why," he said, looking at me, "I once
killed a friend of mine in the Wintergarten in Berlin, surrounded
by policemen, and they thought he had fainted."</p>

<p>"A friend?" I said.</p>

<p>"When I say a friend," said Mr Kister apologetically, "I mean
one who had been a friend. We fell out over a lady&mdash;you
remember, Kattz."</p>

<p>"A tight-rope walker," said Kattz.</p>

<p>"Exactly. She was not worthy of the quarrel I have often
regretted my haste in the matter, for poor Joseph was a good
fellow, and played skat like a master."</p>

<p>"I don't think you should speak against the cord, Rudolph,"
said Kattz, "you have probably only seen it used by a bungler.
There are three men&mdash;there are two now, for Friedrich
Müllenheim laid down his life for the Fatherland at the Battle of
Roye&mdash;who can use it. It is as silent as the knife, and I
remember&mdash;"</p>

<p>My blood went cold as I listened to the exchanges of
experience which went on between the two, and when Kister was
using my waistcoat to illustrate what he called "the
complete-silence stroke," and Kattz was showing on my neck the
exact spot where the carotid artery nearest approaches the
cervical vertebrae. I thought matters had gone far enough.</p>

<p>"Make your own arrangements about young Jabowski," I said
hastily, "but how are you going to deal with the old man&mdash;he
is safely in prison?"</p>

<p>"That I think is simple," said Kattz, "we have been studying
the prison system in England&mdash;naturally that interests us
more than anything else, an we know the procedure. A prisoner on
remand is allowed to have his meal sent in. I think there will be
no difficulty in sending our friend something more than he will
digest."</p>

<p>"I will leave the matter entirely in your hands," I said.</p>

<p>I gave them £10 and bade them report to me by telephone when
their dread task was accomplished. I confess I spent a wretched
night. How frail and thin is life! The snap of a thread and the
veil is rent&mdash;a puff of wind and the serene flame goes
out&mdash;a crack of a rifle and the accumulated genius and
experience of forty years, a million memories and a million
hopes, are dissipated to nothingness. How dreadful is that
visitation. I shuddered. I did not want to die. As for these two
traitors, death would rid the world of much corporate infamy. The
day came slowly, and I was up long before my servant.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the morning newspaper to tell of any
happening such as I expected, but I could hardly expect to have
news so soon. I resolved to stay in my apartment till the
afternoon, and it was ten o'clock when I heard a ring at the
bell, and went hot and cold. I heard my servant go along the
passage and open the door and presently came a knock.</p>

<p>"Come in," I said, and to my surprise in walked young
Jabowski. His face was pale, his eyes wore wild, and as for
myself, I could frame no question.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Heine, Mr. Heine," he said imploringly, and I thought
he was going to kneel at my feet, "Give me another chance, give
me another chance. Here is the photograph."</p>

<p>His trembling hands searched for a pocket-book, which
presently he produced. The book shook in his palsied fingers, but
presently he mastered himself sufficiently to extract a small
photograph which he handed to me. It was the photograph of myself
and the ill-fated Jabowski.</p>

<p>"There, there is the evidence," he gasped, "now do be a good
friend and save me!"</p>

<p>"I hardly know what you mean," I said coldly, "all that I
know is that you came here yesterday and accused me of a crime
from which my very soul revolts, disloyalty to the British
Government, for the members of which I have the highest
respect."</p>

<p>"The old man will take his punishment without bleating," he
said, eagerly ignoring my reference to his wild conduct. "The
lawyer says he will only get about twelve months' imprisonment,
and if he opens his mouth about you, he will probably get more.
But if they convicted me&mdash;why, I'd get five years."</p>

<p>I was silent. This talk still held a mystery for me, and I
waited for him to reveal that which, even in my curiosity, I did
not dare ask.</p>

<p>"I ought to have known, Mr, Heine," he said mopping his
forehead with an ungentlemanly handkerchief of many colours, "I
ought to have known that with all the spies you've got, you would
be wise about me."</p>

<p>"I am indeed wise about you," I said very severely.</p>

<p>"Don't think," he said eagerly, "that I am a regular burglar,
because I'm not. The old man never allowed me more than eighteen
shillings a week, and a man can't live in a gentlemanly way on
that, can he? I got in bad with a crooked lot of people, and one
job led to another and that is how it happened."</p>

<p>"I know exactly how it happened," I said coldly.</p>

<p>"When I got home last night," the young man went on, "it
struck me that you might know that I was in the Regent Street
burglary and it gave me the shivers, but I wasn't sure until I
found myself being shadowed by the two detectives you put on to
follow me."</p>

<p>I could have laughed out loud. Kattz and
Kister&mdash;detectives!</p>

<p>"How did you know I had put them on to you?"</p>

<p>"I gave them the slip," said young Jabowski, "and presently I
spotted them getting into a cab. It was about one o'clock in the
morning, and I got another cab and followed them and, they came
back here."</p>

<p>"Came back here?" This was indeed news for me.</p>

<p>"Well, they didn't come up," said Jabowski, "they stood
outside the flat, talking, and one of them pointed up to your
window, and then I knew that you had put them on to me."</p>

<p>I readily supplied an explanation. My friends Kister and Kattz
had come back to tell me of some difficulty they had met with,
and I am rather glad they took this step. What Jabowski told me
greatly relieved me. If the old man would remain silent and take
his punishment, with the photograph in my possession, and burnt,
and Jabowski in terror of my betraying him, a load was removed
from my mind. There was no need for any drastic measures, and I
could only hope that my two friends, with characteristic
thoroughness, had not already despatched a deadly draught to the
man in the cells.</p>

<p>I was anxious to get rid of Jabowski before they turned up or
telephoned, as I had asked them to, and after lecturing him on
his evil life and on the necessity for dealing honestly by his
fellow creatures and abandoning his course of wickedness, I
allowed him to depart with the promise that I should take no
further action against him.</p>

<p>"Honesty and straight dealing with your fellow creatures is
the surest road to happiness and success," I said. "How beautiful
is the life of the virtuous man who can look the whole world in
the face, as the poet says, and owe not any man!"</p>

<p>He thanked me very humbly and went his way. Neither Kister nor
Kattz put in an appearance, and I began to worry whether they had
got into some trouble, or whether, in some spirit of friendly
rivalry, they had gone outside my instructions and in good-hearted
competition had been practising their science upon some
unfortunate pig-headed Englishman or Englishmen.</p>

<p>When they had not turned up by the afternoon I am afraid I
became very angry. Was I to be kept waiting in my flat all day by
two despicable jail-birds? However, a diversion arrived in the
shape of my assistant, Mr. Wilhelm Peters, that amiable young man
arriving after lunch with my letters.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I am so late, Herr Heine," he said, "but I had no
idea that you were not at the office."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," I said genially, "you have been out of
London. Now tell me your news."</p>

<p>He chatted away about various matters. He gave me a memorandum
of the amount of T.N.T. which was being made at &mdash;, the big
new English factory, and told me of the trouble that had arisen
because Woolwich had rejected so many flawed shell-cases which
were made in a certain factory in the North of England. He also
placed in my hand the memorandum compiled by our agent in
Liverpool of the cotton shipments and furnishing me with
particulars of certain petroleum boats which were due to arrive
in the Jersey.</p>

<p>"I saw Herr von Friedländer at Birmingham," he said. "He has
not been able to find an agent in the small-arm factory, but he
hopes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He hopes!" I said, irritably, "that infernal man may live on
hopes, but I can't! I shall pack him straight back to America.
Does he imagine because he is well-born that I must endure these
harrowing disappointments? I cannot find excuses for him any
longer. You have done very well my dear Wilhelm Peters, and I
shall report in terms of favour."</p>

<p>"I thank you for your gracious words, Herr Heine," he said,
going red under my approbation. "I also took the liberty of
calling at Wednesbury and seeing how our convicts are
progressing."</p>

<p>"And how are they?" I asked innocently.</p>

<p>"They are behaving themselves," said Wilhelm Peters, "and
seeming to like the life. The red-headed one, Kattz, is quite
amusing."</p>

<p>"Red-headed one?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, the little one who has red hair. Don't you remember I
described them, after I had met them on the steamer, Herr
Heine?"</p>

<p>"And what is the other man like&mdash;Kister?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He is a man with a long black beard and rather consumptive
looking," said Wilhelm.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>My hair almost stood on end.</p>

<p>"Quite sure. The only thing that worried them was a visit
which was paid to them by two secret service officers last
week&mdash;at least I gathered they were officers of the English
secret service by the questions they asked."</p>

<p>"Do you know what they looked like, the secret service
officers?" I said, endeavouring to control my voice.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Peters smiled like a fool.</p>

<p>"Don't grin, stupid owl," I said angrily.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Herr Heine," said Wilhelm Peters, "but I was smiling
because I asked them that very question. One was a thin-faced man
with lines in his cheeks and the other was rather a stoutish man
with a rosy face and a little beard."</p>

<p>"Secret service officers!" I breathed."</p>

<p>"Do you know them?" asked Wilhelm Peters.</p>

<p>"I have met them," I said, and somehow at that moment I knew
my stay in England was nearly up.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story12" name="story12">12. &mdash; THE PASSING OF
HEINE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Apr 6, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">THE British people, in their boastful, arrogant,
and frivolous way, have a saying that the British do not know
when they are beaten. This betrays their folly, their
short-sightedness, and their inability to grasp the obvious. We
Germans, on the contrary, recognize facts. I had enjoyed a great
innings. I had done useful work. I had served the Fatherland with
a loyalty and unselfishness which I trust will be held as a
shining example to the unborn generations of secret service
officers who will follow in my steps.</p>

<p>To continue in England would be folly. There were many reasons
why I should determine my residence. It was growing more and more
difficult to get into communication with the Fatherland. Trading
steamers, ostensibly engaged in peaceable commerce, but in
reality maintained to keep the communications open between
England and Germany, were constantly disappearing in the most
ominous fashion. The wireless stations which we had established
with so much thought were being eliminated and, worst of all,
since the conviction was forced upon me against my will, I had to
confess to myself that there really existed in Britain a secret
service of a peculiarly deceitful kind.</p>

<p>I had been constantly coming into contact with its members,
constantly foiled by its machinations. Its officers were to be
found in all ranks and departments of public life; they included
members of Parliament, and little shopkeepers, newspaper
reporters and doctors, railway officials of all grades, ship's
stewards and parson. It was unbelievable, and it took me nearly
two years to be convinced.</p>

<p>And now I had the feeing that a well-prepared net had been
stretched and was gradually encircling me. I had a sense that I
was being played with as a mouse is played by a cat. I notified
Headquarters that I was retiring gracefully, and one night I sat
down and worked out the details of my escape.</p>

<p>I had four passports, and my first move was to obtain the
endorsement of all these. That in itself was a difficult
business, but the original owners of the passports were well
chosen. It was an American, a Swede, a Chilean, and a Canadian,
and had you seen the four photographs attached to those four
documents, you would have observed that there was not a great
dissimilarity in appearance between any of the four.</p>

<p>I was due to leave England on May 15th, 1916. I actually left
on May 14th. On the morning of that day, I took one of those bold
steps which the most daring spies invariably find profitable. I
called at the War Office and asked to see Major Haynes, of the
Intelligence Department. I sent in my name, that is to say, my
Chilean name, and in a very short time I was ushered into a very
large, bare office, where the gallant major sat at a table which
was covered with documents of all kinds.</p>

<p>He rose and greeted me heartily.</p>

<p>"How are you, Heine?" he asked, pulling up a chair for me to
sit on. "And how are our friends Kattz and Kister?"</p>

<p>"Kattz and Kister?" I repeated, my face a blank.</p>

<p>"The scientific murderers," said the major with a cheerful
laugh. "The bow-string expert and the stiletto specialist."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, dear major," I said.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you would," said he, and pulling out a drawer,
removed a box.</p>

<p>"Have a poisoned cigar," he said, "one of our Kattz-Kister
Perfectos."</p>

<p>He simply roared with laughter. Such vulgarity!</p>

<p>"I certainly remember the two names now you mention them. They
called upon me with a hoity-toity plan which I was much too busy
to discuss with them. As a matter of fact, they had not been
there long," said I with a cunning smile, "before I realized that
they were members of the <i>great</i>" (I emphasized the word
"great" with a little sneer) "English secret service, and I had
an amusing evening pulling their several legs."</p>

<p>Major Haynes winked (he was not well born).</p>

<p>"What I like about you, Heine," he said (again that
objectionable word, which I passed in silence), "is that you have
a sense of humour. So few of your fellow countrymen possess that
sense."</p>

<p>I laughed politely because I felt that it was what he expected
me to do.</p>

<p>"Why have you come now?" he asked. I shrugged my
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Mister Haynes," I began.</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," said he, "but go on."</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said, "it seems to me that my most innocent
actions are misconstrued, and as I am going to-morrow to Brighton
to spend a week-end, I thought it advisable to notify you, so
that you may know where you can find me."</p>

<p>"So you are going to Brighton, are you?" he said after a
pause. "What an eccentric fellow you are!"</p>

<p>"Eccentric, Major Haynes?" I repeated.</p>

<p>"To go to Brighton an hour's journey from London to an
ordinary man, by such a roundabout route."</p>

<p>"Which way do you think I am going!" I smiled.</p>

<p>"I am not sure,' he said, "but, judging from the fact that
most of your boxes went up yesterday to Liverpool under the name
of Heigl, I gathered that you were making a round trip of it.
Still," he said, rising and offering his hand, "I will wish you
bon voyage. You have entertained me vastly. Keep clear of the
mine-fields and 'ware submarines. They are dangerous little
devils."</p>

<p>Oh! Had he seen my mind? Had he known the embittered thoughts
that flocked through my brain like a flight of wild geese? Could
he have detected the harsh and cynical expressions which trembled
on my tongue, I do not think this fatheaded Englishman would have
seen me to the door with such awkward grace.</p>

<p>I saw his idea. For his own purpose he desired to keep me in
England until the moment came to strike, but my friend, thought
I, as I walked along Whitehall, in Heine there are four people
and Liverpool is not the only gate to the "dark sea flood."</p>

<p>Another man might have taken a long time to consider his
plans. Mine were already made. He expected me to go back to my
office, or to my flat perhaps, under the supervision of his
detectives. I walked to Westminster Bridge Underground station,
took a train to Charing Cross, descended the moving escalator to
the Tube, and rode as far as Oxford Circus, where I changed for a
city train which carried me to the Bank. Here I changed again and
rode to Waterloo, came up to the surface in an elevator and
caught a train on the elevated electric to Clapham Junction.</p>

<p>From Clapham Junction I journeyed to Willesden, from Willesden
by a slow train to Rugby. Here I changed, leaving the
North-Western station and joining the Central Line, found myself
at half-past ten at night at Sheffield. I walked across to the
station hotel, taking a packed trunk which was waiting for me at
the cloak-room, registered myself, filling up the necessary form,
and was conducted to Room 43.</p>

<p>I was no sooner in the room and was unbuckling the straps of
my trunk, when there was a knock at the door. Thinking it was the
chambermaid, I said "Come in," and the door opened&mdash;and
admitted Major Haynes in civilian dress.</p>

<p>"What time would you like your breakfast in the morning,
Heine?" he asked, with such savoir faire that you might have
thought he had accompanied me and had only parted from me a few
minutes before he came into the room.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone in coolness, I replied: "At nine
o'clock."</p>

<p>"You look tired," he said, "I think the rest at Brighton is
going to do you a lot of good. When they told me you had got out
at Clapham Junction I really thought and hoped that you had
decided upon taking the short route. I expect it is the
underground journeys that make you look so weary. Have you a
headache?"</p>

<p>"The only thing that gives me a headache, Major Haynes, is
boorish and unkultured conversation." I felt it was the moment to
assert myself, even though it cost me my life.</p>

<p>"Then avoid soliloquies," he said, and with a nod he shut the
door. There was nothing to do the next morning but to go back to
London, which I did, taking my suitcase with me.</p>

<p>Major Haynes was on the same train, nearer the engine than I.
I saw him step into a motor-car that was waiting and drive off,
and I went into the buffet and had some breakfast.</p>

<p>My difficulty was going to be to arrive at the port of
embarkation rather than the actual getting on board the steamer,
and I knew that I should have to abandon both the Liverpool and
the Fishguard routes and go by way of Glasgow and Greenock.</p>

<p>The thing was to shake off the men who by this time were
watching me, and Fortune favoured me to an extraordinary extent.
That night there descended on London one of those thick white
mists which sometimes occur in the late spring. I packed a grip
with a special kind of disguise, put the necessary documents in
my pocket, and sent for a cab.</p>

<p>I came to the door of the front entrance of the flats, walked
out bareheaded to the driver and told him that I should want him
to take me to St. Pancras station to catch the 10:30 Scottish
mail. I asked him how long it would take me to get to the depot,
then I walked back into the vestibule, picked up my hat, coat,
and portmanteau, that were waiting in a dark corner, slipped
through the back door across the yard by which the tradesmen
enter to deliver their goods, through a mews, and in a few
minutes I was swallowed up in the darkness. I stood at the end of
the mews and listened. There was no sound of footfall. Rapidly
threading the narrow streets which lay at the back of the
apartment house in which I lived, I gained a second road, hailed
a taxi and instructed the man to drive me to Langley, which is a
wayside station fifteen miles out of London, and lies between
Slough and West Drayton. He promptly refused the fare, but I
slipped a couple of notes into his hand and his views on the
shortage of his petrol underwent a remarkable change. So much for
the veracity and honesty of English cabmen!</p>

<p>On the way down I changed my mind. My appearance at so
insignificant a station might excite comment, and as we cleared
the patch of mist, the cabman offered no objection to taking me
on to Reading. At this station a slow train from London to
Plymouth leaves shortly after midnight. I reached Bristol at 3.30
in the morning, and by 5 o'clock I was on my way northward,
journeying by workman's train part of the way, until I changed on
to a main line train at Worcester.</p>

<p>Had you stood that same afternoon on Carlisle station, you
would have seen a clean-shaven clergyman with a white collar and
a black soft felt hat, immaculate black garments, and the various
other insignia of his holy office. You would have observed that
he was drinking tea, and that under his arm was a large and
serious book, and that his gold-mounted spectacles would
occasionally be turned benevolently left and right looking for
Major Haynes.</p>

<p>In this guise I reached Glasgow, a comfortable English parson.
I passed the inspection of the alien officer, my passport was
stamped officially and I crossed the gangway of the ship with a
feeling of malicious joy.</p>

<p>"Here," thought I, "is an object-lesson which Major Haynes
himself might take to heart as an example of German
objectivity."</p>

<p>We Germans never falter in our purpose. We set our minds upon
a goal and to that goal we attain. I stepped down the crowded
gangway to the purser's office to present my ticket. The purser
looked at it and nodded.</p>

<p>"Take this gentleman to stateroom 64," he said to a steward,
and the man gathered up my trunk and my coat, led the way to the
stateroom I had booked, opened the door and I walked
in&mdash;and there was Major Haynes sitting on the settee smoking
a cigar and looking bored.</p>

<p>"Close the door, Heine," he said, and shook his head,
reprovingly. "I have not had the opportunity of telling you
before," he said gravely, "but I think it is only right that you
should know that a clergyman of the Church of England does not
wear gaiters, unless he is a bishop, and I feel sure, Heine, that
whatever you are, you are not a bishop."</p>

<p>I felt I could not bandy words with him. I sat heavily down
upon the settee.</p>

<p>"You have been getting your ideas of the clergyman," he said,
"from <i>Simplicissimus</i>. For example, that apron you are
wearing, and which I have no doubt was supplied to you by a
theatrical costumier who thought you were cast for the good
clergyman in 'The Silver King,' is the apron that rural deans
dream about, and countless vicars regard as being half-way to a
halo. I wonder you didn't bring a shepherd's crook," he said
bitterly.</p>

<p>"So I understand that I am forbidden to travel on this boat?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly. It would be no less than a scandal to allow you to
misrepresent the Church of England to our good friends in
America," said Major Haynes. "Now get into some sensible clothes
like a good fellow."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. I took up my trunk, watery at heart,
walked up the companion-way and crossed the gangway on the
wharf.</p>

<p>Oh, that journey back to London, how long, how dreary, how
full of conflicting emotions! With what soul weariness did I
recall every incident of the northward journey! With what respect
had I been greeted in my Episcopalian character by the common
people!</p>

<p>Major Haynes was not on the train, I am happy to say. I was
too depressed to make any other attempt to escape, too weary even
to formulate some alternative plan I did not even have the energy
to speculate upon the reason I was being detained, for I had not
been charged, as I might have been charged with using false
passports, nor was I charged, with any of the other offences
which might have been alleged against me. I was just simply let
loose and given another chance of escape.</p>

<p>I made no pretence of going back to my flat, but drove to an
hotel where I knew I should be constantly under observation. I
was eating my dinner in an unhappy fashion, when I heard my name
breathed, and, looking up, I recognized in the waiter a man who
had given us a great deal of information, and was a worker for
The Day. While he was bending over me with the menu in his hand,
and apparently taking my order, he was speaking rapidly.</p>

<p>"You are watched, Herr Heine," he said under his breath.</p>

<p>"I know," I replied in the same tone. "I am trying to get away
from London."</p>

<p>He said no more, but when he came back with the soup he
whispered: "I think I can help you."</p>

<p>When the fish arrived, he added a little more information.</p>

<p>"When you get back to your room to-night," he said, "ring for
the sommelier. I will come up."</p>

<p>I told him briefly that I had made two attempts and failed,
and he nodded. I waited till fairly late before I rang the bell,
and my friend&mdash;his name deserves mention in these records,
it was Gustav Steil, a worthy fellow who, I understand, has since
fallen into the hands of our hateful enemy&mdash;responded very
quickly.</p>

<p>"In half an hour," he said, "come out of your room and go down
the service stairs. You will find them on the left. At three
o'clock to-morrow morning the chimney-sweeps are coming to clean
the kitchen flues. I will get an old suit of clothes for you and
with a bag of soot and your face blacked you can get out of the
hotel without anybody being the wiser."</p>

<p>"And after that," I said.</p>

<p>"I think I can get you a horse and cart. Drive to this
address. It is my brother-in-law's&mdash;he is in the
country&mdash;and lie low there for a day or two and I will come
and see you."</p>

<p>He gave me a key and the address. It was in a place called
Palmer's Green. The plan worked admirably. I descended without
interruption or observation, made a change of clothes and so
covered my face with soot that no person would have recognized
me. Gustav let me out through the service entrance and I found a
light cart and a horse waiting, with a boy sitting in the
seat.</p>

<p>"He is my son. You can trust him. Good luck, Herr Heine."</p>

<p>I took a £5 note, it was somewhat dirty, I am afraid, for I
had to rub it to make sure there were not two, a mistake which I
had once made&mdash;and slipping it into the honest fellow's
hands, I drove off.</p>

<p>Picton Street, Palmer's Green, is a street of small houses,
and that house to which I went was poorly furnished but was good
enough for my purpose. I washed the disguising soot from my face
and lay down on the bed to finish my sleep.</p>

<p>It was not a comfortable day by any means, because there was
no food in the house, and I was ravenously hungry that night when
Gustav came bringing me provisions and busying himself at the
kitchen fire preparing me coffee.</p>

<p>"There is a cattle-ship leaving Avonmouth in two days' time,"
he said. "A friend of mine will smuggle you on board and look
after you on the voyage over."</p>

<p>"How am I to get to Avonmouth?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"By train," said he, but I shook my head. "All the trains will
be watched. Can you get me a motor-bicycle?"</p>

<p>He promised to do his best and, late as the hour was, he went
out to inquire. He came back with a push-bicycle, and told me I
should have to do the best I could with that for one stage of the
journey, and that he would arrange to have me met on the
Reading-Newbury road by a good patriot with a motor-car, but that
it would be necessary for me to lie in the bottom of the car and
allow myself to be covered by rags.</p>

<p>I will not describe the frights and apprehensions of that
journey. I cycled through the night and just before day-break I
reached the Reading-Newbury road and came within sight of the
tail lights of a motor-car drawn up at the roadside.</p>

<p>The journey was not an uncomfortable one. I descended from the
car on the outskirts of Bristol and made my way to the place
where friend Gustav told me I should meet the sailor. It was a
little bar and from the description which Gustav had given me I
was able to recognize my friend, a stalwart patriot of Finland,
which despised the British even as he hated the barbarous and
tyrannical Russian.</p>

<p>To recall even that night's adventures and to place on record
all the events which occurred between my leaving my friend's
lodgings and my arrival in the hold of the soon-leaving ship
would occupy a volume. How I climbed two walls, how I ensconced
myself in a railway truck which was slowly shunted to the side of
the ship with the most uncomfortable bumpings, how I stole up the
slippery side of a coal chute and lay for two hours amongst the
pots and pans of the cook's galley how I eventually swarmed down
an interminable ladder into the depths of the ship, an adequate
account of these happenings might be written by a Zola, but my
poor pen can neither describe the agonies of mind and body which
marked my reaching the ship, nor the miseries of soul which
followed when the vessel drew clear from the wharf and began to
sway and heave, to jump and sink in the open seas.</p>

<p>I was hungry until I went on board ship, but the moment the
vessel started on its voyage I felt I would never eat again. I
almost wished I had not left England. For a day and a night, it
seemed like two months, or even two years, I endured the agonies
of sea-sickness beyond description. At the end of the second
night my friend made his way to the hold and brought me up to the
galley, for I should explain he was the ship's cook. Here I was
able to take the little nourishment which he gave me. Just before
daybreak and when I was preparing to return to my submarine
dungeon, the thud of the screws ceased.</p>

<p>"Are we stopping?" I asked my friend, the cook. He went out on
to the deck and presently returned.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "you had better stay here. There is an English
patrol coming alongside."</p>

<p>I could hear nothing but the whine of the wind and the
ceaseless roar of the sea, and the first thing I heard was the
sound of voices on the deck just outside the galley. He was an
English naval officer speaking.</p>

<p>"You have a stowaway on board, a German agent," said the
voice; "oh, yes, I know you are not aware of the fact, but he is
here. You can either search the ship and bring him up or we will
save you the trouble."</p>

<p>I looked at the cook, and the cook looked at me.</p>

<p>"Herr Heine," he said sadly, "there is only one thing to do.
They will find you&mdash;they are certain to find you. This is a
small ship."</p>

<p>I drew myself up and straightened my shoulders. Pushing open
the door I stepped out to the deck in the light of the dawn.</p>

<p>"I am the man you seek," I said proudly. I had to climb down
the rope ladder on to a bobbing little motor-launch, to the well
of which I was conducted. We were very near land and I supposed
(and here I was right) that the land was Ireland, that
down-trodden nation, the sport and mock of the misgoverning
English.</p>

<p>The motor-launch ran into a little harbour and came up by the
side of the jetty. A man in a long military overcoat was pacing up
and down, but stopped when the boat reached the landing stage. I
sprang on to the steps and mounted to the quay.</p>

<p>"Had a good time?" said the voice I hated more than all
voices.</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said with dignity, "I have not had a good
time."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear it. Anyway you have got the soot off your
face, I am happy to see. You are looking quite white, Heine. Come
and have breakfast."</p>

<p>I accompanied him mutely to a little one-storeyed hotel which
faced the landing stage.</p>

<p>"You had better go up and tidy yourself," he said, "I have
engaged a room for you."</p>

<p>I bowed and followed the hall-porter, who was the only servant
up at this hour of the morning. He opened the door and showed me
into a room, and to my amazement I found all my trunks on the
bed. One had been opened and my razors and shaving apparatus was
neatly laid out. Over the rail of a chair hung my best suit, and
my patent boots, nicely polished, stood neatly against the wall.
I shaved, washed, and changed, and in half an hour I presented
myself in the dining-room where to my surprise, a good breakfast
was waiting, Major Haynes being already at the table engaged in
reading what appeared to be a volume of poetry.</p>

<p>"Well, Heine," he said, "your travels are nearly over, and I
think that some explanation is due to you."</p>

<p>I bowed again, though it was a difficult performance, since I
was at that moment balancing a piece of fried egg upon my
knife.</p>

<p>"Try the fork," said Major Haynes. Really this man's
inquisitive eyes saw everything.</p>

<p>"The fact is, Heine, we knew all about you before you arrived
in England. We knew you were at the head of the organization, we
knew your ways, your habits, your abnormal conceit&mdash;you
don't mind my speaking frankly, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said stiffly. "I am in your power."</p>

<p>"And we knew that wherever the corpse was there would the
vultures be gathered, or, to put it better, wherever was the
magnet there would be the iron filings. If we kept you going and
left you alone, we always knew where to look for your workers,
who were ever so much more dangerous than you. We thought once or
twice of taking you," he said reflectively, "but I persuaded the
powers that it would pay in the long run to leave you alone. And
it has paid," he said, "all the satellites that revolve about you
have been taken and destroyed. New suns will arise and attract
new planets, and in course of time will be dealt with, but the
period of danger has passed."</p>

<p>"And now, I suppose," said I miserably, "having no further use
for me you are going to finish me off?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Major Haynes, with great cheerfulness, "you
shall go back to America, Heine, as an awful example to all
spies. In that capacity you will still be useful to me. You will
at least be able to tell them something of the difficulties that
await a man who tried to get out of England even with a forged
passport. Believe me, it is just as difficult to get in, unless
we want you in."</p>

<p>"You are going to let me go free?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"The outward-bound <i>Cremantic</i> calls here by arrangement
in two hour's time. You will be taken out in a motor-launch and
put on board. Your cabin is 143 and you will find it quite
comfortable."</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket and took out a flat case which
he opened. "Here is your passport," he said.</p>

<p>I took the passport in my hand and read the description of
myself, even my photograph was pasted on. "I was described as
"Heine", "Occupation: German Spy." "Reason for travel: By Special
Deportation Order 64731, the British Government having no further
need of his services."</p>

<p>To my mind the cruelest thing was the photograph which showed
me in that infernal clergyman's garb. Underneath was written,
"Religion: Church of England."</p>

<p>I looked at Major Haynes.</p>

<p>"You have spared me no humiliation," I said, and there were
tears in my eyes, for remember what position I had held in the
service.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have," said Major Haynes, "I might have taken a
flashlight photograph of you as a sweep. You've no idea how funny
you looked."</p>

<p>Two hours later I stood upon the first-class passenger deck of
the <i>Cremantic</i> watching with folded arms the land sinking
slowly astern.</p>

<p>Farewell! False Albion! Thy doom is assured! The
ever-victorious German U-boat&mdash;I stopped suddenly and thought,
then turning to a sailor I asked: "Is there any danger of being
torpedoed?"</p>

<p>"They gets a ship sometimes, sir," he said with callous
indifference. "But, when we sees 'em we shoots at 'em and that
generally frightens 'em off. If every passenger keeps his eye
skinned there ain't much danger."</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the voyage with my eyes skinned.</p> <hr>

<h2><a id="story13" name="story13">13. &mdash; THE U-BOAT
ADVENTURE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Apr 13, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">AS I stood on the broad deck of the English
steamer and shook my fist at perfidious Ireland, I realized in a
flash what my beloved Fatherland was losing by my departure from
a land in which I had rendered Germany so many signal
services.</p>

<p>"Keep your eye skinned for submarines," said a kindly-meaning
mariner, and these words brought me to the alert. My situation
was serious. It could not be known in Berlin that I had sailed,
and the stupid fools of U-boat commanders would be ignorant of my
presence on the British ship. At the thought a cold shiver of
horror percolated through my spinal column. What tragedy if such
be the end of a splendid career.</p>

<p>I skinned my eyes throughout the day and twice by my loud
cries saved disaster, once from a floating mine shaped like a
wooden barrel (such is the supreme cunning of our race) and once
from a U-boat which constantly came up and dived. The stupid
English said that the first was only a barrel and that the
up-and-down-diving U-boat was a porpoise, but Heine's eyes are
sharp.</p>

<p>I did not attempt to make friends for the voyage, and rejected
with scorn the suggestion of a frivolous American that I should
play poker. Imagine playing poker in the midst of a great war! I
asked him if he could play skat, but he knew nothing of that
splendid and truly German game. I can give a great deal of
information about the methods that are employed to convoy ships
through what is called the Danger Zone, and in due course I may
write a report on the subject, or rather I should have written a
report but for circumstances which I will reveal at a much later
stage.</p>

<p>Of how we zig-zagged about, first east and then west, then
north and then south, of the balloons and aeroplanes and torpedo
boats that watched us there seemed no end. My German heart
swelled with pride as I thought that all these precautions were
forced by our incomparable U-boats.</p>

<p>I was sitting on the deck waiting for the sound of the
dinner-bell thinking out how superior the German race is to all
its kind and how it must inevitably, sooner or later, conquer the
world, when one of the ship's officers passed by. I took off my
hat to him and bowed and he gave me a little jerk of his head and
passed on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he stopped.</p>

<p>"You want to keep your eyes skinned," he said with that brutal
gruffness which is so characteristic of the English.</p>

<p>"Sir," I said with a little smile, "my eyes are so thoroughly
skinned that I can hardly shut them at night."</p>

<p>Instead of laughing at this little jest, he made a grunting,
pig-like noise.</p>

<p>"There's a U-boat somewhere about here," he said, "the patrols
have lost sight of it. I see you are prepared."</p>

<p>I was wearing an unsinkable waistcoat which I had purchased
from the steward, the life-belt which we are compelled to wear,
but which I should have worn under any circumstances, a pair of
thick waterproof boots, and my pockets were filled with brandy
flasks and sandwiches, in case of accident. We Germans are
prepared for anything, as I have remarked before.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," I said in alarm, "that there is a chance
of&mdash;of unpleasant happenings?"</p>

<p>"A big chance," he said; "fortunately we have got very few
passengers, so I am not disguising the fact to many of them that
we are in some danger."</p>

<p>"But," I protested indignantly, "what about the boasted patrol
boats? Where are your many vaunted aeroplanes? Why are we not
preceded by warships to take the shock, which according to the
lying statements in the daily papers, is the custom?"</p>

<p>"Probably they didn't know you were coming on board," he said
with true British insolence, and passed on.</p>

<p>The dinner-bell rang, but I remained on deck. I would take no
risks. Here I was, and here I would remain until the Danger Zone
was passed, even it I had to sit up night after night. All the
lights on the deck were extinguished. There was no sound but the
steady thud of the screw and the roar of the water running past
the hull of the steamer. The night was pitch black, such a night
as filled my soul with strangely religious thoughts, and whilst
my mind was thus occupied, I heard a shout from the bridge, an
excited voice cried something, and I rushed to the side of the
vessel and looked left and right, my skinned eyes searching the
darkness.</p>

<p>Then something happened! I have never understood what it was.
I was conscious of a brilliant flash of light, and a roar in my
ears, such as a man feels who may occasionally takes a bath and
inadvertently puts his head under the water.</p>

<p>I felt myself leaping through space. I had only time to
remember that I had all my money in my pockets, but that I had
left several important documents in my cabin, before I received
another shock. I was in the water. The life-belt supported me.
There was no sign of the ship. I screamed for help with true
German thoroughness. I was bobbing up and down like a cork, and I
felt dazed and ill.</p>

<p>What had happened? Had the ship sunk? Was I alone in the
ocean? I thought of my life. I thought of the Fatherland. I hoped
the cursed submarine would sink and all its crew be drowned. I do
not know how long I was in the water. They told me it was not
more than twenty minutes, but that twenty minutes was an eternity
to me. The water was bitterly cold, my hands were numb, but I
found my brandy flask and emptied its contents down my throat. I
felt a little better after that, but, oh, joy, when suddenly I
heard a voice in the darkness shout, almost in my ear it
seemed:</p>

<p>"There's somebody," and the words were spoken in German.
Almost immediately something big and hard rubbed against me. I
can describe it in no other way. A hand gripped my collar and
dragged me on to what felt like the top of an egg, if you can
imagine the egg laid over on its side.</p>

<p>"Help," I said faintly. "I am a true German."</p>

<p>"A German?" said a surprised voice, "<i>Gott im Himmel</i>!
What are you doing here?" I staggered to my feet, assisted by a
strong German arm and addressed the presence which was dimly
outlined against the starry skies. How godlike is a German
officer! How loud and commanding is his voice! What splendid
domination there is in his whole bearing.</p>

<p>"Get him below," he said, "there go the searchlights. Is that
you, Fritz?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Herr Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Well, what is she doing?"</p>

<p>"She has just sent an S.O.S. and wirelessed her position,"
said the other, whom I could not see.</p>

<p>"Be ready to submerge. Come on, my friend."</p>

<p>He gripped me by the arm. I was pushed down a steel ladder and
found myself in the confined space of a German submarine.
Instantly there was a loud clang as though the lid had closed on
a box, a rush of warm air and &mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold tight! " said the voice of the commander. His back was
to me, but I could tell by his voice that he was a man of noble
birth. The deck tilted under me and I had a sinking sensation in
the pit of my stomach, and then the horror of the situation
dawned upon me. We were going down to the depths of the sea. We
would probably be chased by those infernal destroyers and
trawlers, and aeroplanes.</p>

<p>It never struck me before what a brutal race the British were.
Here were we, boxed up in a frail little vessel, the prey of a
hundred bloodthirsty hawks. I felt faint at the thought, and
casting aside all restraint, I walked up to the Commander still
standing by his directing instruments.</p>

<p>"Pardon, Excellency," I said, and would have taken off my hat,
only I remembered that I had left the ship without one.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, without turning round."</p>

<p>"Would it not be wise," I suggested, " if you made for the
nearest port and let me land? I feel I am only an encumbrance on
your Excellency, and would be eating the food which I feel sure
you need."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil," said this arrogant young man, whose name I
learnt was von Gwinner. Presently he had finished his work and
walked back to me.</p>

<p>"Do you imagine that I would walk into to the nets and risk
certain destruction, in order to save you a little discomfort?
What is your name, swine?"</p>

<p>"Excellency," I said, "I am known as Heine." I spoke, I think,
with dignity, and I hope that the man was impressed. "I am an
officer of the Imperial Intelligence Staff."</p>

<p>"How did you come to be on this ship?" he asked.</p>

<p>I explained to him that I was making my escape from England,
carrying valuable documents, which were of the highest importance
to the German Government. I felt if I said this he would regret
his precipitate action in sinking the ship, and it flashed upon
me as I was speaking that possibly I could find a way out of my
exceedingly uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>"Did the ship sink?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he said with a curse, "we probably damaged her bow, but
she's still afloat."</p>

<p>"Then," said I eagerly, "why not run me up quite close to her?
There are a number of ladders with which I have familiarized
myself and I can very easily step from your deck &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk like a fool," he said, "she is probably surrounded
by destroyers and trawlers now. If I got near her I should
probably have a depth charge on me and never know what struck
me."</p>

<p>He looked at me thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"A spy, eh?" he said. "Do you speak English?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, sir," I said.</p>

<p>"Thunder and lightning," he said, "you are the very man I
want."</p>

<p>I cannot say that I was very pleased.</p>

<p>"You want me?" I faltered.</p>

<p>"You are the man I want. By heavens! It's providential. Sit
down on that locker."</p>

<p>"May I smoke?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If you want me to kick you in the stomach," he replied
viciously; "smoking on a submarine, are you mad? Do you imagine
you are on the Kiel Ferry?" He was so angry that I changed the
conversation. He then told me that this was one of the
super-submarines which had been sent out from Kiel soon after the
U-boat warfare had started, and that he hitherto had carried an
intelligence officer whose task was to go ashore at unfrequented
places, make his way to the nearest seaport and learn something
about sailings.</p>

<p>"I have felt the loss of him," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you lost him?" I asked with a quaking heart.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said carelessly. "He was shot dead by a coastguard
near Portland. He was an amiable man, and I quite missed
him."</p>

<p>"Indeed," I said faintly, "is there any danger of that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you would have to take that risk! You tell me you
haven't incurred the suspicion of the authorities." Like a fool I
had told him that in describing my departure from England.</p>

<p>"Very well. You couldn't be better. I remember your name
now."</p>

<p>He unlocked a little steel box attached to the wall of the
small cabin in which we were speaking, and took out a book which
is familiar to me&mdash;a list of agents. He looked down them
carefully. Presently he stopped.</p>

<p>"What is your code name?" he asked. I told him, and he nodded.
"That's right. If you had deceived me, I should have gone up to
the surface, put you on deck and submerged again&mdash;leaving
you without your lifebelt. As it is, I appoint you Intelligence
Officer with pay at the rate of six marks a day."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said, not without sarcasm, though this I did
not make evident.</p>

<p>How can I describe my thoughts and feelings during that
terrible night? Wild with anxiety as to my fate, the maddening
knowledge that I was perhaps thousands of feet under the surface
of the sea, and liable at any minute to strike a submerged rock
or a sea-mine, facing the prospect of stealing ashore and perhaps
being shot by coastguards either coming or going! All these
things crowded one upon the other, and robbed me of sleep.</p>

<p>The interior of the submarine was thick and close. The sailors
glanced at me disdainfully, and answered any questions I put to
them with bluff rudeness.</p>

<p>You cannot conceive, my dear friend, how restricted life is on
board a German submarine. It is all whirling engines and
projecting brackets that bump your head. There are noises most
terrible to hear. The only man who talked to me was a good
fellow, whose name I forget, who told me that only one German
submarine in three ever gets back to port, and the stories he
told me about nets and submarine mines, and how you can be seen
from the surface by aeroplanes, and how sometimes the engines go
wrong and it is impossible to rise, turned me almost grey.</p>

<p>It is very likely that I slept. My own impression is that I
did not, but I am told that it was necessary to kick me because I
was snoring. As I never snore this is palpably absurd. But
apparently we did come to the surface in the night, but nobody
told me this, or I would have gone on to the deck to get some
fresh air. The sailor with whom I spoke informed me that if I
had, the commander would probably have kicked me into the sea,
and that members of the crew were not allowed to come up without
special permission.</p>

<p>The agony of the following day beggars description. We were
coming up to the surface and our periscope was showing, when
suddenly the U-boat gave a violent jerk and I was almost flung
off my feet. I thought we had struck a mine, and fell into the
arms of the commander, half-fainting. I fell out again with true
German alacrity, when I realized that it was not agreeable to
him. He afterwards explained to me with a great deal of
unnecessary insolence that he had come up close to a destroyer
and had had to submerge in a hurry. We were not fortunate that
day, and the next time over periscope showed above water it was
nearly carried away by shell-fire from a trawler less than a
thousand yards away, and I sat and quaked as I beard the dull
throb of the depth charges exploding in our vicinity.</p>

<p>That evening the commander beckoned me to the tiny box which
he called a cabin.</p>

<p>"Do you know Devonshire?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, Excellency," I replied.</p>

<p>Of course, I did not know Devonshire but it is very simple to
buy a map and discover anything I want to know.</p>

<p>"Do you know Siddicombe Bay?"</p>

<p>"Not very well," I replied.</p>

<p>"It is within easy walking distance of Torcombe Bay," he said.
"The coast is not well guarded there. I will land you under cover
of the darkness and you will make your way to Quaytown. My
information is that there is a convoy of ships there which are
sailing either to-morrow or the next day. I want you to make
inquiries. Here is the name of the public-house where sailors are
to be found. As soon as you have secured information make your
way back to the point where I shall land you, flash an electric
torch once, and I will come and pick you up."</p>

<p>He opened a case that he took from his desk and extracted two
or three documents.</p>

<p>"Your name will be William Smith," he said, "here is an
English registration card. You live in Manchester, and you are
looking for a ship. Here is your discharge book, which you need
not show unless you are questioned."</p>

<p>He told me that these documents had been taken from a sailing
ship which he had sunk, and that the owner of them had been
killed by shell-fire.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock that night, we came slowly into the deep
waters of Siddicombe Bay. It is, I believe, one of the beauty
spots of Devonshire, a half-moon of green water surrounded by
high red cliffs and sloping fields, chequered red and green.</p>

<p>I did not see this by night, of course, and I am indebted to a
local guide book for the description. A tiny collapsible boat was
got out and opened, and into this I stepped.</p>

<p>"Remember," said Commander von Gwinner, at parting, "you are
to return at ten o'clock. If you are late you will be sorry, my
friend."</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," I said quietly, "I am less influenced by
your threats, though I recognize that being well-born you mean no
harm, than by the knowledge that I am serving our beloved
Fatherland, for whose success and victory I ever pray, and on
whose behalf I am prepared to make the most monumental
sacrifices."</p>

<p>"You talk too much," he said; "get into the boat."</p>

<p>We landed at the beach without mishap. It was deserted, and I
made my way along in the direction indicated by the local map,
which I had studied with the commander, and presently found the
zigzag path that led to the top of the cliffs and to the little
village of Siddicombe.</p>

<p>Half an hour's brisk walk brought me to Quaytown, a large,
straggling town, which was in times of peace a pleasure resort,
but which had been converted in war time to a port of call. The
main roads flank the little harbour which, as I could see,
contained about six ships, and after inquiring from the
policeman, I found my way to the public house to which I had been
directed.</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock when I arrived, so I had only half an hour
to pursue my inquiries. The common bar was filled with a noisy
crowd, mostly sailors and men of the R.N.V.R. I managed to get a
drink, and cast my eyes round for a likely informant, and found
one in a common sailor of the Naval Reserve, who gladly accepted
my invitation to drink, but asked me to bring it to him, because
the bar lady had refused to serve him with any more.</p>

<p>"It's a hell of a life," he said, "what with the law and the
price of beer. It's a dog's life."</p>

<p>It was providential that I found him. He was a man with a
grievance, and a man with a grievance is very voluble.</p>

<p>"Come," I said cheerily, "things are not so bad as you think.
We shall soon have these damned Germans beaten."</p>

<p>"Don't you make any mistake about it, my boy," said the common
sailor, whose name was Jones, "if we are beating the Germans, why
are we keeping our ships in harbour? Look here, mate," he said,
speaking with the stupidity of a drunken person, "We've got six
ships in this harbour. They've been lying here for a week. Why?
Because there are two German submarines outside&mdash;or rather
one," he corrected himself. "We've looked for them German
submarines everywhere. The balloon's been out, the aeroplane's
been out, the trawlers and destroyers have been out, but they
haven't got 'em&mdash;at least they haven't found one," he
corrected himself again.</p>

<p>"What's going to happen? Tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock
when the convoy goes out&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow at three," I said carelessly, "that's a curious
time to leave."</p>

<p>"Never mind if it is curious, or if it isn't," said the man,
rudely quarrelsome, "they know their own business better than you
do, my lad."</p>

<p>"Naturally," I said hastily. "Well," he went on, "to-morrow
afternoon they go out at three o'clock. What happens? Them
submarines will get 'em&mdash;at least one of 'em will," he
said.</p>

<p>So I had my information. Trust Heine to make a discovery of
this kind.</p>

<p>At three o'clock on the following afternoon! The excellent von
Gwinner should be delighted. He would understand perhaps that he
had a different type of man to deal with than what he had
expected. Possibly he would send my name in into Headquarters for
an Iron Cross&mdash;that possibility awakened a thrill of
pleasurable anticipation.</p>

<p>"But come, my friend," I said, "you take too pessimistic a
view. Now I don't believe that these six ships will be sunk."</p>

<p>"Not all of 'em," said the inebriated sailor gloomily, "but
one of 'em will. Them submarines are too artful, or rather," he
said, "one of 'em is."</p>

<p>His insistence upon the differentiation piqued my
curiosity.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my friend, if it is not betraying any military
secret, and speaking as sailor to sailor &mdash;"</p>

<p>"You ain't no sailor," said the drunken man commonly.</p>

<p>"Speaking as man to man," I said in haste to get him off the
subject, "why do you say first that there are two submarines and
then you only refer to one of them."</p>

<p>He was pulling at a short clay pipe, very dark and very
stomach-revolting, and he puffed for a long time before he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Because," he said at last, "one of 'em's done hisself
in."</p>

<p>"Sunk?" I said with the same carelessness. What information to
carry to Commander von Gwinner! What a back-slap he would give
me, at the same time saying, "Good old boy, you have done very
well indeed." I declare to you at that moment that the thought of
serving the Fatherland brought tears of joy to my eyes. I would
collect all the information I could, for already the hands of the
clock were ominously near half-past.</p>

<p>"In what manner has he done himself in? Sunk?" I asked
again.</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't sunk," admitted the man, "but he soon will be.
He was spotted about an hour ago going into Siddicombe Bay, and
all the bloomin' fleet is on its way there with nets and
trawlers, and depth charges, and Gawd knows what!"</p>

<p>I held onto the wall for support.</p>

<p>"They'll have him netted in by half-past ten," said my friend.
I looked at the clock again. There was time for me to get back to
Siddicombe, but the next words of my acquaintance arrested my
attention.</p>

<p>"He's bound to spot 'em comin' and make a run for it, and
they're bound to ketch 'im," he said with cruel relish. I could
get back in half an hour. The boat would be there waiting at ten
I could warn von Gwinner, and he would "make a run for it."</p>

<p>What stupidity! What recklessness! Who are these people, these
air-giving aristocrats, who risk the lives of the true democracy?
What right have they, I thought, to bring men of my intelligence
and genius into terrible and spine-shaking danger and perhaps to
death?</p>

<p>The clock pointed to 9:30.</p>

<p>"Well, so long," said my acquaintance, "is there anything I
can do for you, matey?" I swallowed my drink and looked at the
clock again.</p>

<p>" Yes," I said firmly, for with my usual quickness of thought
I had made my decision, "Can you recommend me an hotel where I
can get a good bed?"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story14" name="story14">14. &mdash; BRETHREN OF THE
ORDER</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Apr 20, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">CONSIDER, dear friends, the embarrassing
circumstances under which I found myself! Deported from England
by a man who I admit is a person of considerable sagacity, though
infinitely inferior to the Intelligence officers one finds
attached to the German army, both in birth and natural
inquisitiveness&mdash;a man who had it in his power to drag me
straight away to the execution-shed as a spy!</p>

<p>But you, who know Heine, are well aware that he is not a man
to be lightly scared.</p>

<p>I woke up that morning in Quaytown without fear, a penniless
Ishmael, hunted by the law, the hand of every man against me. Yet
I was cheerful. When I say I was penniless, I speak of course in
a figurative sense. I had a few pounds in my belt. I had a
several thousands in a certain New York bank, and in various
places in England there should be men who would help me.</p>

<p>I paid my bill at the little hotel where I had spent the night
and caught the nine o'clock train for London. I got off the train
at Bath and made my way to a certain large stationer's which
accepts advertisements for the leading London dailies. On payment
of a little extra money those advertisements are telegraphed to
London and appear on the following morning.</p>

<p>The advertisement I inserted was a very simple one. It
ran:</p>

<p>"Clerk, over military age, expert book-keeper, with intimate
knowledge of the Argentine, Cuba, Batavia and Holland, requires
situation. Salary £200."</p>

<p>An innocent advertisement, you may say. Yet, my friend, that
was the S.O.S. of a political agent in distress. On the following
morning, when I saw that appear, with a certain box number in the
<i>Daily Megaphone</i>, I should know that I had to wait for two
or three days for one of our industrious agents to answer that
advertisement.</p>

<p>The words, "Argentine, Cuba, Batavia, Holland," in that order
meant, "I am in urgent need of money." The "£200," which followed
was the amount I required. Had I advertised that my experience
was in France, Egypt, China, every German agent in England would
have known that special intelligence had been received from
Germany and that they must gather at an agreed rendezvous to
receive their orders. Had I merely written that my experience
was in London, Bombay and Buenos Aires, half the agents in
England would have made preparations to depart from this country
without delay.</p>

<p>I arrived in London by night. That was the object of my
getting off at Bath, or rather partly the object, because I had a
certain person, a minor agent, to interview. Fortunately, or
unfortunately, he was not to be found, and it was not until the
train came in and I was preparing to step into my carriage that
he made his appearance, rather out of breath, for he had run all
the way from the apartment-house he kept.</p>

<p>"I found your note," he said. "Are you alone in this
carriage?" I looked around. There were no other passengers.</p>

<p>"Then," said he, "I will take the liberty, Herr Heine, of
coming to London with you. I have much to tell you. We thought
you had left England."</p>

<p>Briefly I explained to him, as the train moved on, the reason
I had returned. I told him how I was carrying important
despatches for America, and how the ship was sunk by a submarine,
and of how I had reached the submarine and had ordered the
captain to take me to the nearest port.</p>

<p>"Sir Haynes," (though I knew he was not noble, I thought it
might tickle the fellow's vanity to address him in terms of
lordliness), "Here am I like a naughty penny, turning up again
under your nose! But quite unwillingly! You have doubtless learnt
that the gallant ocean-liner upon which you placed me is no more!
She was sunk by a German U-boat! Though I swam about looking for
survivors, desiring to rescue as many poor Englishmen as possible
from the wicked and mistaken policy of dirty old von Turnips"
(may heaven forgive me for this jest at the expense of that great
patriot), "I was not successful. I swam about in the water for
ten hours and was picked up by a passing steamer! We arrived in
London this morning and I am now in a terrible dilemma. I dare
not give you my address, for I am in fear of arrest. Guarantee to
me by your power-compelling word that I shall not be punished. If
you will insert an advertisement in the <i>Daily Megaphone</i>,
like this:</p>

<p class="quote">"From H. to H, All well,<br> See me at my
office."</p>

<p>I will immediately report myself. In the meantime, dear Sir
Haynes, thanking you for your past favours, and hoping by a
constant attention to your wishes to merit the continuance of
your patronage.</p>

<p>I am,</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>Heine."</p>

<p>I calculated that it would take two days for this to reach
him, another day before the advertisement appeared, and I then
had a fourth day before I replied in person&mdash;and in four
days much service could be rendered to the Fatherland.</p>

<p>I was determined to get as much out of this secret society as
I possibly could. All that afternoon I formulated my plans.
Through a call office I got into touch with Kriessler, who was
one of our subsidiary agents in London, and had rendered me and
the Fatherland great services.</p>

<p>We met by appointment that night at the Marble Arch, and
almost the first question he asked me was whether I had got into
touch with the Sons of Irish Freedom? When I told him I had, he
was astonished.</p>

<p>"You don't lose much time, Herr Heine," he said
admiringly.</p>

<p>"That is very true, Kriessler," I said gravely, "and I
appreciate your compliment."</p>

<p>Kriessler was in a position to pass through any information
collected in England. I, of course, had been the supreme medium,
but I dare not exercise any of the old machinery of transmission.
It was very dangerous. It might be, and probably was, very
dangerous for Kriessler, but for the sacred cause of Germany we
must take risks, so I let Kriessler take them.</p>

<p>I arranged for him to send to my house on the following
morning for a brief report which I told him must be sent to
Headquarters with the least delay.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear Kriessler," I said, at parting, "I know all
there is to be known about this secret society. But I am anxious
to check my knowledge. You will please tell me all you have
heard, and if I do not interrupt you to point out your mistakes,
you will understand that it is not desirable that the subordinate
officials should know as much as their superiors."</p>

<p>"I quite understand that, Herr Heine," said Kriessler, "but I
do not pretend to know a great deal about the Sons of Irish
Freedom. One knows that they have meetings and passwords. I also
know that the police are actively searching for their lodges, but
so far without success. I am told that they are very desperate
and dangerous men, and I believe that there is only one lot in
London. They hate England&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That I know," I smiled.</p>

<p>"I went home and wrote a very full report on the constitution
and working of the Sons of Irish Freedom. Blame me not, dear
friend, for my innocent deceit, for I had never heard of the Sons
of Irish Freedom till I arrived at Bath, nor think harshly of me
that I wrote with elaborate detail to Potsdam upon their ritual
and objectives. That same night I sent off my letter to Major
Haynes, and finished my report on the secret society, which was
given to the messenger whom Kriessler sent soon after breakfast.
I took my meals alone in my sitting-room and my strange, gaunt
friend, whose name was Clarkson, only saw me once and did no more
than to smile mysteriously and say:</p>

<p>"At eight o'clock to-night."</p>

<p>I nodded gravely. I did not expect to hear any more about the
matter, being well aware that my host would not care to discuss
so weighty a secret, and I was surprised in the afternoon to
receive a visit from Mr. Clarkson, who was accompanied by a
short, stout man, who was also very pale and wore powerful
spectacles.</p>

<p>"This, sir," said he, "is my friend, Mr. Moore, who will act
as your sponsor to-night."</p>

<p>He turned to Mr. Moore. "This gentleman," said he, "will
become one of us."</p>

<p>Mr. Moore bowed. "You realize, of course," he said, a little
pompously, I thought, "that you must absolutely surrender your
allegiance to the World's Terror, and that from this night
forward you may count upon the moral support of a band of
brothers, and that you will give yourself heart and soul to our
sublime task."</p>

<p>"Have no fear," I said, seizing his hand too, and wringing it,
"until the tyrant is crushed I will be a loyal comrade."</p>

<p>"Good," said Mr. Moore, and after a few commonplaces about the
weather, they departed.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock that night I dressed myself with care,
soberly and unostentatiously. What cared I for the oaths of these
fanatical conspirators, with their absurd secrecy, their
passwords, their grips and the like?</p>

<p>Mr. Clarkson knocked at my door at a quarter to eight and we
sallied forth together. I suggested taking a taxi-cab, but he
would not hear of it, and we went by bus to Camden Town.</p>

<p>It was just as we were turning into Baynam Street that we
noticed a little crowd gathered about something which lay on the
sidewalk. We would have passed on, but Mr. Clarkson, overhearing
something that was said by a member of the group, pushed his way
through the little knot of people and I followed.</p>

<p>A man lay prone on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked curiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Clarkson made no reply till we were clear of the crowd.
"One of our people," he said bitterly, "fallen to the enemy."</p>

<p>"Fallen?" I, said. Mr. Clarkson nodded.</p>

<p>"It happens now and again," he said, "we are fighting a
cunning and ruthless foe, my friend."</p>

<p>"But are you leaving him there?"</p>

<p>"For the moment," said Mr. Clarkson, "I will ask one of the
brethren to make inquiries as to how it happened, and if it is
possible to give any assistance to our unfortunate comrade, it
will be given."</p>

<p>This was news indeed. So this mighty British Government was
not above striking an assassin blow to rid itself of its
enemies.</p>

<p>From Baynam Street leads a smaller thoroughfare, near the
Camden Road end of which is a small hall. The night was dark, the
painted street-lamps cast tiny pools of dim light upon the
pavement as we stole furtively through the door of the hall, and
passed through a small ante-room to a smaller room beyond. In
this room there was another door, and towards this Mr. Clarkson
walked.</p>

<p>"You will wait here," he said in a whisper. He knocked in a
peculiar manner on the door, and a sliding panel opened. He
whispered something, the door was unlocked, and after he had
slipped into the room, closed again.</p>

<p>I waited about three minutes before the door opened, and Mr.
Clarkson came out accompanied by Mr. Moore, both of whom wore on
their breasts sashes of red. Mr. Moore, scarcely raising his
voice above a whisper, asked me a number of questions. They were
couched in a curious semi-legal, semi-philosophical vein, and I
confess I did not understand very much, nor did I trouble to pay
a great deal of attention to what was being said. I knew by their
intonation when I had to say "Yes," and when I had to say
"No."</p>

<p>When I had finished Mr. Clarkson looked anxiously at his
friend.</p>

<p>"I think that is satisfactory, Brother Moore?"</p>

<p>"Eminently satisfactory, Brother Clarkson," said the other. He
rapped soberly at the door and again the panel slid back and a
voice challenged him.</p>

<p>"Who knocks?"</p>

<p>"Two brethren with a candidate for initiation," said Mr.
Moore.</p>

<p>The panel closed and presently it opened again.</p>

<p>"Who vouches for this candidate?" said the voice.</p>

<p>"I," said Mr. Clarkson.</p>

<p>"I," said Mr. Moore.</p>

<p>The door was opened and we passed through, not without a
fluttering of heart on my part.</p>

<p>Between my two sponsors I advanced into the hall. At one end
of the room on a raised dais sat three men bearing the strange
regalia of their order. To left and right at single tables were
two other officers, also wearing decorations. I passed from one
to the other. Each addressed me in solemn language on the duty of
man to man, and presently I came to the raised dais and had to
endure yet a further long rigmarole, at the end of which the
president confided the password, which was "Fight the Fight," the
grip, and the signal knock.</p>

<p>I was led to a seat in the body of the hall, congratulated
heartily by Mr. Moore and Mr. Clarkson, and settled myself down
to listen to the deliberations of this strange body. They were
men of all ages, of all conditions of life, stern,
determined-looking men I thought, capable of committing any
desperate deed, the kind of men who might be most useful.</p>

<p>There were young and old amongst them, but all bore the same
sour disappointed expression, which I had noticed both in Mr.
Moore and Mr. Clarkson.</p>

<p>A brother rose and had begun to address the chair when the
door was flung open excitedly and a tall, pale-faced man rushed
in. As he did so, I heard the shrill sound of police
whistles.</p>

<p>"A raid, a raid! " he cried. Instantly the hall was in
commotion. I felt myself grow pale and grasped Mr. Moore, who was
next to me, by the arm.</p>

<p>"Is there any way out of this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You had better stay here," he said.</p>

<p>"Stay here and be caught?"</p>

<p>That was not Heine's way. I dashed through the door into the
street. There was no sign of policeman, but I heard shrill
whistles blowing. I ran up into Baynam Street straight into the
arms of a policeman!</p>

<p>"Hello," he said, "you had better take cover. There's an air
raid on."</p>

<p>"An air raid?" I gasped. "An air raid!"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it isn't one. A mate of mine just told me it's
a false alarm, and very likely he's right. There's rather too
much wind for a raid to-night."</p>

<p>I could have leant against him. I was so confounded and
confused I could collect my thoughts only in fragments and the
first memory of that evening which strangely enough came to me
was the memory of that stricken form on the pavement.</p>

<p>"Tell me, sir," I said, "did you see a man lying on the ground
round the corner?"</p>

<p>It was, I admit, a foolish question to ask, but the memory of
that rigid victim had obsessed me.</p>

<p>"Oh, him," said the constable, "yes! He was drunk."</p>

<p>"Drunk?" I said in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the policeman, "a man named Geary. He used to be a
member of that lodge down the road there." He pointed to the
building from whence I had come.</p>

<p>"What lodge is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Sons of Temperance," he said, "I thought I saw you come
out of there. Ain't you a member? Rum blokes, they are," he went
on with a little chuckle, "always talking about drink as the
Enemy and Terror and the Oppressor of the World. I wish somebody
would oppress me with a pint."</p>

<p>I pressed a shilling into his hard, corrupt fist, and walked
back to Bayswater.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story15" name="story15">15. &mdash; THE WORLD
DICTATOR</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, Apr 27, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">I PASS to the strangest adventure of my
experience, and I tell this story because not only does it reveal
the amazing unscrupulousness of the British Government, but I
think it will also show the marvellous adaptability of a German
agent. I do not suggest that all agents would have acted as I
did, but then I do not think there are a great number of German
agents who are possessed of my extraordinary capacities.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that after my deportation from England
by a certain Major Haynes, of whom more anon, I was submarined
and landed again on these inhospitable shores, and by reason of
the sentence of deportation, which had been illegally passed upon
me without a trial, I was compelled to lie, as they say in
England, doggo.</p>

<p>With most of my friends I dare not communicate, and though I
had written to Major Haynes announcing that I was in England, and
asking him to give me an opportunity of calling upon him, giving,
of course, no address, I did not hear from him immediately. I
had, however, inserted an advertisement in the <i>Daily
Megaphone</i>, stating that I was a clerk with experience in the
Argentine, Cuba, Batavia and Holland, saying that I was willing
to work for £200 a year, the combination of those words meaning
that I was an agent in distress and that I was requiring £200. I
had no doubt in my mind that the call would be responded to. I
was officially penniless. I had some money of my own, but why
should I spend that when there was so much money to be had for
the asking?</p>

<p>I called at the office of the newspaper and received a big
batch of letters in response to my advertisement, I took them
back to my new lodgings, for I had left the old apartments, owing
to the fact that the proprietor was a fanatical teetotaller, and
in the privacy of my own room I took the letters from my pocket
and turned them over rapidly, looking for one which would have an
inky finger-mark on the back flap.</p>

<p>I found and opened the envelope, and discovered, as I had
expected, four bank notes for £50 without any reference to the
sender. I would have thrown the remaining letters upon the fire,
had there been one, but fortunately my time was hanging on my
hands. I had arranged to meet Kriessler, the only man in London
with whom I could safely communicate, and I had two or three
hours to fill in before that appointment. So what was more
natural than that I should open those offers of a situation and
read them through? Thoroughness is the characteristic of our
race. We despise no material, however unpromising. Germany was
built up upon by-products, and her wealth extracted from the
dust-bins of Europe.</p>

<p>They were letters of a conventional type asking me for
recommendations or inviting me to make calls upon the writers. It
was the fourth letter which interested me most of all. l read it
through carefully, put it aside, skimmed through the remainder of
the letters and then returned to this extraordinary missive.</p>

<p>The paper was heavy and rich. There was on the top left-hand
corner a coat of arms embossed in gold and blue. The address was
182, Berkeley Square, which is one of the most fashionable
residential squares in London. This address, however, had been
scratched out and there had been substituted "Stoney Cottage,
Hebleigh-on-Avon." The letter was marked "Private and Very
Confidential," and ran:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"If the advertiser is a person of discretion,
and is willing to act as confidential secretary to a high
government personage, and has a knowledge of world politics, a
permanent position with a salary of £500 per annum can be offered
to him for the duration of the war."</p><br>

<p>I pondered this letter for some considerable time and before I
went out to my appointment with Kriessler, my mind was made up
and I had written offering my services, informing the writer that
I had acted in a similar capacity to a certain Legation, which I
was not at liberty to name, in Holland; that I was the soul of
discretion, that I had no friends in England, and that I was not
liable for military service. I added that I should be glad if the
advertiser could arrange a meeting in town and that in the
circumstances I should like it to be as secret as possible,
because I was already doing confidential work for a government
department and they might not like to lose me.</p>

<p>The next morning came a telegram in reply.</p>

<p>"Meet me to-night at ten o'clock at the comer of Berkeley
Street. I shall be wearing a tall hat and light gloves."</p>

<p>Ten o'clock that night found me at the rendezvous and
punctually to the minute a taxi-cab drew up and a gentleman
alighted answering to the description contained in the telegram.
I walked up to him taking off my hat.</p>

<p>"You are the advertiser?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I replied. He looked at me thoughtfully. The light
was very dim but I met his gaze without faltering.</p>

<p>"Do you speak French?"</p>

<p>" Yes, sir," I replied.</p>

<p>"Walk along with me," he said, taking my arm. The cabman
evidently knew his client and did not expostulate at his
departure. Had I been the fare he would have covered me with vile
abuse and would have told me that he had no petrol. Such is the
unscrupulousness of London cabmen!</p>

<p>We walked down Berkeley Street and turned into the deserted
Berkeley Square. He stopped in front of a gloomy house. "I live
here," he said, "but I am at present staying in the country."</p>

<p>His voice was sharp. He spoke brusquely and without
politeness, and I realized in a flash that he was noble-born. He
asked me several questions, more or less irrelevant, and then
suddenly he turned about and walked back in the direction of the
cab.</p>

<p>"I think you will do," he said, "you will leave tomorrow
evening for Hebleigh. I will meet you at the station and drive
you to my cottage. I keep no servants in the house when I am at
Hebleigh."</p>

<p>This seemed strange, but I was afterwards to discover that the
cottage had been specially built for my new employer, with vacuum
cleaners, gas and electric stoves, a perfect system of central
heating, water on every floor and a bathroom attached to every
bedroom. What a comfortable place, thought I, what luxury and how
providential for me! Here I could lie quiet for weeks and never
be discovered, with nothing to break the monotony of life but an
occasional bath.</p>

<p>I had brought down a small hand-bag containing my worldly
belongings, and I was ushered into a small bedroom simply but
expensively furnished by my host. It was in that room, the first
room in which the lights were all switched on, that I had my
first good view of him. He was a man of about fifty-five rather
thin, very grey, with a pale, aesthetic face and long, nervous
hands. It may seem curious to you that I had not asked him his
name, but if you imagine I neglected that precaution you do not
know your Heine. I had asked him but he had not responded.</p>

<p>"A woman comes every day to make the beds and to prepare our
principal meal," he said. "You will not see her because she does
her work whilst I am in my study, and the meals are served on a
lift which comes straight from the kitchen."</p>

<p>To his study he led the way. It was a large room, one wall of
which was covered by a book-shelf filled with large and imposing
volumes. A handsome table filled the middle of the room. There
were two comfortable arm-chairs and a writing table. Under the
window, across which a heavy curtain had been drawn, was a
smaller table, and to this my unknown employer pointed.</p>

<p>"That will be yours," he said. "Your duty will be to translate
despatches which I shall write, into such languages as I shall
tell you. Do you speak German?"</p>

<p>I kept a straight face.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I replied. He nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"You wonder probably," he said, as he seated himself at the
table and looked at me strangely over the tortoiseshell-rimmed
glasses fixed on his nose, "why I require discretion, why I chose
you without knowing anything about you or without any kind of
reference? I chose you in the first place," he went on, without
waiting for me to explain that I could produce references,
"because in the first place, I think you are a foreigner. Am I
right?"</p>

<p>"In a sense &mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"Very well," he went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," he looked at me sharply," have you ever
heard of Bilbury's Tablets?"</p>

<p>I had indeed heard of Bilbury's Tablets, the advertisements of
which covered the hoardings of England all forming the most
attractive reading matter in the stupid. British newspapers. I
therefore answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Do you know the man Bilbury?" he asked, still looking at me
keenly. I was at first tempted to say that I did, but on second
consideration I thought it best to tell the truth.</p>

<p>"No, sir. I have never met him."</p>

<p>"Good," he said, nodding again. He leant back in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Bilbury," he said&mdash;"and this, you will understand, is
confidential&mdash;is one of the biggest and most dangerous
forces working in this country against England. I have reason to
believe that, under one name or other, he is supplying most of
the German agents with their money. I am satisfied also that his
advertisements are code messages to the enemy
government&mdash;you see, I trust you."</p>

<p>I nodded, a little bewildered, for I had never known of
Bilbury, though I had heard that there were in England certain
persons of whose identity I was ignorant, who were working with
the Fatherland.</p>

<p>"I tell you of Bilbury," he went on, "because in part he
explains a great deal of the secrecy both of my habitation and my
movements. He also explains why I have chosen, as you might think
haphazard, a confidential secretary. You are under no
circumstances to communicate with any of Bilbury's agents, and
you are at all times to be prepared to counter the machinations
of this extraordinary man."</p>

<p>There were two or three letters on the table, and one of these
he picked up, slit it open and took out what appeared to me to be
a perfectly blank sheet of paper. He held it up to the light and
frowned, replacing it upon his desk.</p>

<p>"Your presence here is already known, evidently," he said,
"but I don't think we need bother very much about that. Now," he
went on more briskly, "you are entitled to know who I am. Do you
know Lord Catherton?"</p>

<p>"I have seen Lord Catherton," I replied.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you know the Earl of Seabury?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"I have never met Lord Seabury."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen a photograph of him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, "I have not." Lord Seabury was until
recently an English colonial governor, who was now one of the
members of the War Cabinet. He is not a man who has figured
largely in public life, and not at all in English public life,
and as I had never troubled about the colonies he was unfamiliar
to me.</p>

<p>He nodded again. "I see you don't know Lord Seabury," he said
with a little smile, "for I am he."</p>

<p>My heart gave a great bound. Heine indeed had fallen upon his
feet, thought I! To find myself in the confidence of one who was
admittedly a most powerful member of the War Council&mdash;what
fortune, what amazing luck!</p>

<p>"Now you understand why I shall require that you treat
everything I say, and everything you witness here, in the
strictest confidence."</p>

<p>That practically finished the conversation. His lordship led
me to a little dining-room where dinner was already laid, and we
ate our meal almost in silence. He told me I could go to bed,
that he was an early riser and would require my attendance at six
o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>I scarcely slept that night, turning over and over in my mind
how I might use to the best advantage the information which I was
certain to gain. I had taken the precaution of buying at
Paddington Station a little guide-book of the district, and I
carefully studied the roads, the railway stations, and a
time-table, with which I had provided myself with my usual
forethought, and planned out the course I would take if it became
necessary to leave hurriedly. With Kriessler in London, able to
forward my despatches to the Highest Quarters, I had no doubt
that within a week the name of Heine would be ringing along the
corridors of the German Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Punctually at six, I presented myself in the library, and
found that his lordship had prepared coffee with his own hands.
From six to eight we worked strenuously, his lordship writing,
sometimes asking me to translate into Spanish, sometimes into
French, occasionally into German, his brief but vital
correspondence.</p>

<p>I memorized as best I could all these letters. Some were to
the Minister of Foreign Affairs in France, one was to a neutral
Legation at Berne, this being marked "Very Confidential and
Secret," and sealed heavily with his lordship's own hand. One was
to a Spanish Cabinet Minister, and all dealt intimately and
frankly with the conduct of the war. I remembered in a vague way
that I had heard that Lord Seabury was the virtual dictator of
England, but I never realized it until I read those dictatorial,
intolerant messages which he sent forth, one being directed to
the commander-in-chief of a certain British army, telling him
that he was on no account to attack before the fourteenth of the
following month.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served in the room where we had taken dinner and
once that was dispatched we returned to our labours. For the
whole of that day I was kept busy. A draft treaty with the
Portuguese Government, dealing with the future of the island of
São Tomé, was one of the documents which occupied the greater
part of the afternoon in translating.</p>

<p>At dinner his lordship was unusually frank, and under my
genial flattery he unbent.</p>

<p>"It is true, Mr. Smith," he said (Smith had been the name I
had given him), "that I am dictating the policy of the Cabinet,
which reminds me that I must draft a letter to-night to the
commander-in-chief of the battle fleet. I am not at all satisfied
with&mdash;" he stopped short.</p>

<p>"By the way," he asked, "have you had any communication from
any mysterious source?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>He shook his head a little despondently.</p>

<p>"It seems absurd that one should be dogged by a pill-maker,"
he mused, half to himself, "but that fellow has got to be dealt
with sooner or later."</p>

<p>He left the room to go to his study, leaving me to finish a
glass of port, and I was rising from the table when he
returned.</p>

<p>"Come this way," he said in a whisper, "I will show you
something."</p>

<p>He led me down the corridor into the study in which the lights
had been extinguished. We walked across the room and he pulled
back the curtain. A bright moon was shining and at the far end of
the garden near the road was the figure of a thickset man who was
pacing slowly and restlessly up and down the road. He dropped the
fold of the curtain and we returned to the dining-room which
faces the back of the house.</p>

<p>"That gentleman is M. Tarakanova," he said, "and Tarakanova is
the chief of Bilbury's agents."</p>

<p>He pursed his lips thoughtfully. "I shall have to send that
infernal dossier to town."</p>

<p>"The dossier, my lord? " I repeated, innocently.</p>

<p>"The dossier," he said.</p>

<p>He made no further explanation until later that night when we
were working in the study, a stealthy reconnaissance having
revealed to me that M. Tarakanova had disappeared. In the wall of
the study was a safe, and just before, or rather immediately
after, he had bade me a curt good night, he stopped my departure
with a word, walked over to the safe, opened it with a bunch of
keys which he took from his pocket, and pulled out a long yellow
envelope which was heavily sealed.</p>

<p>He brought it carefully back to the table, switched on the
table light which he had extinguished, and placed the envelope
under its rays.</p>

<p>"Look at this," he said. I looked. In a firm hand was written
on the top of the envelope, with a neat red line ruled
underneath:</p>

<p>(1) Statement signed by William II, Emperor of Germany, on
July 5th, 1914 expressing his intention of making war.</p>

<p>(2) Letter from Emperor William II, of Germany to Emperor
Francis Joseph to the same effect. (Original documents).</p>

<p>I did not speak. I was incapable of speech. Within this
envelope lay documents in the very writing of the All-Highest
Supreme War Lord! Documents of greatest national interest!
Historical documents which, in the enemy's hands, might damage
the beloved Fatherland and our Noble and Glorious Kaiser!</p>

<p>I was clear-headed and cool. Those documents should he
restored to their Imperial owner. What reward would await the
gallant and enterprising agent who delivered these papers into
the hands of our Supreme and Noble Master! I grew dizzy with the
thought of the emoluments and the honours which might be showered
upon me. No office was too high for the man who could render that
magnificent service to the State!</p>

<p>My hand trembled as I touched the secret dossier.</p>

<p>"I must get rid of this at once," said Lord Seabury. "It is
too risky to keep it here&mdash;put it back in the safe,
Smith."</p>

<p>Dare I do it? Half-a-dozen steps separated me from the desk to
the steel door in the wall. I half-glanced at his lordship. He
was looking at a document which he had half-finished before
dinner. Quick as lightning I slipped the envelope under my coat
and under my arm, slammed to the door of the safe, locked it and
handed the keys back. He thanked me and put them in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"You may go now, Smith," he said.</p>

<p>The perspiration was trickling down my forehead and I walked
unsteadily down the passage to my room. I closed and locked the
door behind me, took the envelope from my pocket and sat down on
the bed.</p>

<p>There was a small writing-table in my room which had been
placed there at my request, and a supply of stationery. To
enclose this large envelope in one larger was the work of a
second, I wrote a brief note to Kriessler telling him that it was
a matter of life and death that the enclosed should be sent
forward by the safest channels and should be placed in the hands
of the All Highest himself. I then began the most important
letter I have ever written in my life:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"All-Highest Majesty.</p>

<p class="letter">"Your humble and obedient servant has the
honour to transmit to Your All-Highest Majesty a document which I
have extracted from the safe of the English Cabinet Minister,
Lord Seabury, at great risk and with much labour, though I count
no labour too great if I am to serve Your All-Highest Majesty. My
name, as Your All-Highest Majesty's Minister of Intelligence will
tell Your All-Highest Majesty, is Heine."</p><br>

<p>I added a number of other interesting details about myself,
where I could be found, what was my salary, and this paragraph
which I regarded as one of my finest efforts.</p>

<p class="letter">"Though no decoration blazes upon my humble
coat, and no patent of nobility has been granted me, though I am
a poor man with no more than my official pay to sustain me, I am
nevertheless proud and happy to be of such service to Your
All-Highest Majesty as will merit Your All-Highest Majesty's
approval. I seek no rewards, no decorations, no monetary
grants&mdash;I do this for the Fatherland, and for Your
All-Highest Majesty, who is the epitome of Germany's
greatness."</p><br>

<p>I placed this and the dossier inside a large envelope, and in
the middle of the night I tip-toed back to the study in my
stocking feet and found a larger covering in which to enclose the
letter which I had addressed to the Emperor.</p>

<p>On the outer envelope I wrote Kriessler's English name and
address, and soon after daylight I let myself out of the house
and walked in the direction of the village of Hebleigh which was
distant about a mile from Stoney Cottage.</p>

<p>I dropped the big envelope into the village post-box, retraced
my steps and reached my room without my absence being detected. I
had to risk his lordship discovering the disappearance of the
letter, but fortunately throughout the next day he showed no
intention of going to the safe, and beyond a reference to
Bilbury, he scarcely spoke a word.</p>

<p>All day long we were inditing letters to every part of the
world, which his lordship sealed with his own hands, and which he
packed away in a leather satchel. How he posted them or whether
he sent them to London, I did not know, but I presumed that a
Foreign Office messenger attended discreetly and performed this
duty.</p>

<p>Half-past eight that night, immediately after dinner, his
lordship went to his study and suggested, when I attempted to
follow him, that I should have a little fresh air.</p>

<p>"You need it, my friend," he said, "you have been playing a
part to-day in the government of England, in the direction of
affairs of the world. Surely that merits a little recreation." He
smiled almost paternally. I walked through the little panelled
hall, opened the front door, and stepped out.</p>

<p>A man was standing by the gate. It was Bilbury's man,
Tarakanova. To whom he was talking I did not know, but somebody
stood in the shadow and I heard his quiet laughter. I shrugged my
shoulders. I had nothing to fear from Bilbury, indeed I was
curious to learn what the agent of this mysterious person had to
say to me. So I walked boldly up the garden-path, humming a
little tune, and Tarakanova turned to meet me.</p>

<p>He was, as I say, a thickset man, clean-shaven, so far as I
could see in the dusk, and not the sort of man you might imagine
would engage in espionage work.</p>

<p>"Good evening," he said, as I came up,</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir," I replied politely, "it is fine weather
for this time of the year."</p>

<p>"You're a trite devil," said a voice in the half-darkness.</p>

<p>I turned to face the man who had spoken and with whom
Tarakanova had been in conversation. I did not faint. I pride
myself that I retain my self-possession with remarkable
sang-froid.</p>

<p>"Good evening Major Haynes," I said, not to be outdone in cool
collectedness.</p>

<p>"Having a nice time Heine? " he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed Major Haynes," I replied; "you got my
letter?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry I did not reply, but I have been rather busy, and
learning you were down here, I thought I would look you up. How
is his lordship?"</p>

<p>"Very well indeed," I replied with great politeness.</p>

<p>Tarakanova laughed.</p>

<p>"I presume you know," I said, as the thought struck me, "that
this gentleman is an employee of Bilbury."</p>

<p>"I know that very well," said Major Haynes, "though he is not
exactly employed by Bilbury, but by the gentlemen who are
administering Mr. Bilbury's estate. You see, Heine," Major Haynes
went on in his fearfully monotonous voice&mdash;how that man
irritates me!&mdash;"the plutocratic Mr. Bilbury, who is a very
rich gentleman, went off his head about four years ago."</p>

<p>"Went mad?" I said.</p>

<p>"Went mad," said Major Haynes, nodding, "not dangerously so,
but just enough to be a nuisance. His pet illusion is that he is
Lord Seabury."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I said faintly.</p>

<p>"He spends all his time," Major Haynes went on, "writing
despatches for important personages, and generally in running the
war. Mr. Jacobson here, is, if I may put it crudely, his keeper.
I suppose he has told you all his secrets?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I said carelessly.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he showed you that dossier of his about the
Kaiser. I hope you haven't by any chance pinched it and sent it
to his Imperial Majesty," said Major Haynes with coarse
brutality, "because it happens that there is nothing more
interesting in it than a pamphlet on the remarkable quality of
Bilbury's Pills."</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said in a husky voice, "I surrender."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Major Haynes, "look me up any time you are
in London, and I will see what I can do for you. Now," said this
long, cool devil, with true British wit, "you had better run back
to his lordship. He will be wanting you for a new offensive, or
may be to send an ultimatum to Sweden."</p>

<p>I made no reply. With dignity I returned to the house, walked
up to my room, and packed my bag.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story16" name="story16">16. &mdash; THE SYREN</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, May 4, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">I HAVE mentioned in an earlier chapter an
organization known as the Sons of Irish Freedom. I do not pretend
that this is the name of the society which at one time threatened
to create the most serious difficulties for the British
Government, but which was dissolved owing to the base and
ungentlemanly treachery of Major Haynes, an Intelligence Officer,
who got himself elected a member of the principal lodge, and by
cunning artfulness induced the members to give a grand dinner to
celebrate the first anniversary of its foundation.</p>

<p>The members allowed this spurious and treacherous brother to
order a dinner which was given at one of the best hotels in
London. Everything was of the best, winter strawberries, most
rare and wonderful wine, beautiful flowers, and a magnificent
entertainment to follow. The dinner, of course, was not announced
as one by the Sons of Irish Freedom, but had a much more innocent
excuse. When the bill was presented for payment, the cunning
Major Haynes, having identified certain prominent Irish
personages who were present with the responsibility for the
festival, it was found that it absorbed all the funds of the
lodge and about £200 in addition.*</p>

<p>[* This tragedy actually happened to a local branch of a
certain seditious organization in Ireland&mdash; E.W.]</p>

<p>The unfortunate and down-trodden Irish are cursed with that
deluded sense of humour which no German can ever understand. Else
how could you imagine that so frivolous a reason can bring about
the dissolution of a great political organization. We Germans
would have repudiated the bill and, if necessary, have sent
secret letters to the hotel proprietor telling him that his
premises would be blown up if he did not mend his manners.</p>

<p>I do not profess to understand either the mentality of the
Irish or that of such men as Major Haynes. I have tried many
times in the silent watches of the night to reduce this officer
(and I wish I could add gentleman) to an understandable formula.
I have never believed that there was a secret service in England.
I never shall believe that anything like the magnificent and
forethoughtful department which German genius has organized could
come into being in a dull-thinking country like Britain. The man
himself was the negation of all good German qualities. He had not
the seriousness which distinguishes men of my own department. He
lacked that haughty obedience-compelling manner which we look for
and expect in the true Prussian officer. His voice was a gentle
drawl. He was always laughing with his eyes, full of jokes which
gentleman, that is to say a Prussian gentleman, would consider it
beneath his dignity to utter.</p>

<p>I have seen him speak to quite common people as though they
were his equals, and for this reason I long suspected that he was
a Socialist, and that is a view which I still hold, and believe
me, Heine makes very few mistakes.</p>

<p>But it would be unknightly in me if I did not pay this tribute
to the man; whether he secured his information by luck or by
judgment, he knew a disgusting sight too much. I had returned to
England, as you know, after being deported by Major Haynes, but I
had had the good sense and vision to write to him announcing I
was in England.</p>

<p>By the sheerest accident he discovered me and requested that I
should call at his office or, as he put it, "look me up." Be
assured, Major Haynes, I shall not only look you up, but look you
down. You may not see the carefully-veiled insolence in Heine's
eye or the sneer behind his teeth. You will not know the bitter
and insulting thoughts which crowd one on top of the other in
Heine's teeming brain. I will look you up indeed and some day you
will look up to me. How dearly I should love to repeat this
bon-mot to his face.</p>

<p>Two days after my meeting I decided to call upon him at the
War Office. It had not been my first visit, and so I knew the
ropes, and having written my name on a slip of paper I was shown
up to his office, a very small, unimportant apartment, showing
that, whatever Major Haynes might be in his own estimation, he
was jolly little thought of by the Army Council, for there was
nothing in his room in the way of pictures except a plain map
which, incidentally, I glanced at and comprehended as I entered.
It was a map of Europe.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Heine," said the Major, who was writing at his
desk, "help yourself to the cigarettes&mdash;those on the left,
the others are poisoned. I keep them for generals."</p>

<p>Such frivolity! Would any major officer in the German army
dare speak of the members of the Great General Staff with such
disrespect? Would they not stand stiffly to attention and refer
to them as "Illustrious General So-and-so," or "The Noble and
Illustrious Well-Born General So-and-so?"</p>

<p>He finished writing, laid down his pen, and resting his elbows
on the arms of his chair, dropped his chin upon his clasped
hands, all the time surveying me with an inscrutable smile, as
though&mdash;and I believe this to be the truth&mdash;recognizing
that in me he had a devilish stiff proposition as the English
say.</p>

<p>"Well, Heine," he said, at last "how is the Kaiser?" My blood
boiled up to my head.</p>

<p>"Don't blush," he said. (Such a cad!)</p>

<p>"How is old von Hindenburg and the shining German sword?"</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said coldly, "if you think I am not a German
then you are insulting me. If you believe I am a German, then
your remarks are both insulting and hurtful to my dignity and my
loyalty and my sense of decency."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Major Haynes; and then after a pause, "I
don't know what to do about you, Heine. If I send you to America
you will be torpedoed. If you get to America you will probably be
executed. If I send you back to Germany you will starve to
death."</p>

<p>I made no reply.</p>

<p>"If I leave you here &mdash;" Major Haynes went on, helping
himself to a cigarette. I noticed it was one of those which he
said he used to poison generals, so I presume it was the best
kind. The inhospitality of the man and his boorishness appalled
me. "If I leave you here," he said, "you will probably be bombed
to death. If I put you in an internment camp you will be an
expense to the Government. If I have you shot &mdash;" He
paused.</p>

<p>I turned white with anger.</p>

<p>"I trust you are not going to do anything so stupid owlish as
that, Major Haynes," I said, "I have done my best to prove to you
that I am a perfectly innocent Swiss."</p>

<p>"Chilean," he corrected, "but it doesn't matter. There are a
lot of Swiss-Chileans in London just now, and quite a few
Swedish-Turks. No, I don't think I will have you shot, you may be
very useful."</p>

<p>"Any service I can render to you, Major Haynes," I said, with
my native politeness, "I shall be happy to give. Unfortunately, I
am&mdash;" I shrugged my shoulders introducing rather cleverly a
suggestion of my helplessness.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Heine," he said with a cynical smile &mdash;
there's something about that man's smile that I don't
like&mdash;"I think you can give me the greatest assistance.
Let's put all our cards on the table."</p>

<p>"I know that you were for some time the head of German
Intelligence Department in London. Take that sad, pained smile
off your face, and behave. As I told you before, you weren't
dangerous, because your methods were somewhat transparent and I
don't think (you will excuse my directness) that you are a very
clever man."</p>

<p>"That is a matter of opinion," I said stiffly.</p>

<p>"I think, as a matter of fact," Major Haynes went on, not
noticing the interruption, "you have too good a heart to be a
spy. Beneath that outrageous waistcoat of yours, and the three or
four undershirts which I am sure you are wearing, beats a kindly
heart." I am recalling his indelicate words from memory that you
may learn what type of "gentleman" an English officer can be. In
honest truth he was wide of the mark, for I only had two
undershirts on, the weather being warm.</p>

<p>"Now with much of your work," Major Haynes went on, "I am well
acquainted. I have your code," he opened the drawer of his desk
and took out a very familiar book, and if I changed colour, who
shall blame me?</p>

<p>"When I say your code, I mean the code of your kind. I have a
list of your sub-agents, such of whom as are still alive," he
said, smiling pleasantly. "I know all about your Kriesslers and
your Kahns, I know your newspaper advertisement code; in short, I
know almost everything about your business"&mdash;he
paused&mdash;"except one thing."</p>

<p>"And what is that, Major Haynes?" I asked innocently.</p>

<p>"It is the one thing I have never been able to discover," said
the Major, putting the tips of his fingers together and looking
down at them. I pricked up my ears. What was it this clever
fellow did not know?</p>

<p>"Many things, I should imagine," I said with a sneer, speaking
of course to myself and sneering inwardly.</p>

<p>"It has come to my knowledge," he said, speaking slowly, and
raising his eyes to mine in a steady, hypnotizing way, "that the
agents of your&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;department have
a code whistle which is instantly obeyed. At the sound of that
whistle you are ordered, under whatever conditions you are
working, whatever you may be doing, however you may endanger
yourselves by so acting, to repair instantly to the spot from
whence that whistle is blown and report yourself for duty to the
man who has given the signal."</p>

<p>I felt my flesh grow rough like a goose's, and my hair almost
stood on end. So precious a secret is the danger whistle that I
have never referred to it before. It is the last piece of
information given to the closely-examined candidate for the
service after he has passed to the Executive. Only two men in
England had the authority to use that signal, or the means
wherewith such a call could be made. Every agent is pledged that,
whatever he divulges, that secret at least shall go down to the
grave with him.</p>

<p>It was that danger whistle that brought about the rescue of
Rosenburg when he was captured on 42nd. Street, New York, when he
was carrying despatches from von Papen to the Ambassador. That
danger whistle, sounded in the courtyard of Brixton Prison by one
of my agents who had himself arrested for debt in order to reach
the interior, made Kruhn, waiting trial for espionage, hang
himself by his bootlaces.</p>

<p>Major Haynes was watching me keenly.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am surprised you should tell me of this, Major Haynes," I
said with splendid self-possession. "I have never heard of this
signal or whistle, or call it what you will."</p>

<p>He rose from the table and came over to me.</p>

<p>"Stand up," he said.</p>

<p>I obeyed him.</p>

<p>"Stand against that wall."</p>

<p>I did not think of expostulating. There was something in his
voice which dispersed all inclination to argue.</p>

<p>"Put out your arms," he said, "I am going to search you."</p>

<p>He went through all my pockets with extraordinary
rapidity&mdash;I think he must have been a pickpocket before he
joined the Intelligence Department&mdash;and of course he found
nothing.</p>

<p>"Open your waistcoat," he said. I obeyed. He ran his hand
lightly over my shirt.</p>

<p>"Tell me if I tickle you," said he; but I was in no mood for
jesting, for under my arm he found the little pocket and the flat
gold tube that I dreaded he would find. He laid it on the table
curiously.</p>

<p>"So that's the whistle, eh? A peculiar note, I suppose is the
code. Four short blasts and a long one?"</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>"That is merely a little trinket which was given me by a lady
friend?" I said.</p>

<p>"Why do you wear it sewn into your shirt?"</p>

<p>"To have it near my heart," I said. "I am surprised at you,
Major Haynes."</p>

<p>"I am surprised at you, Heine," he said, "if you keep your
heart under your right arm-pit. You are a physical monstrosity
&mdash; but I suppose you are one of those curious birds that
carry their hearts in their sleeves. Come now, Heine, what is the
code?"</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I replied earnestly, "If you were to give me a
hundred thousand pounds at this moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which I am very unlikely to do," said Major Haynes.</p>

<p>"If you were to give me a million pounds," I said desperately,
"I could not tell you, because I don't know."</p>

<p>He walked back to the other side of the table and sat down.
For some time he did not speak. He lit another cigarette and
looked out of the window, clasping his chin.</p>

<p>"You are a German, Heine, aren't you," he said at last, "and I
am an Anglo-Scot, with a touch of American. Generally speaking I
am British. Now here is the situation," he said, tapping on the
note-pad, "you are a good German patriot" (to my eternal credit,
I didn't deny it!), "I am a British patriot. Now, which of us is
the more devoted to his Motherland?"</p>

<p>It was one of those kind of stupid questions to which there is
no answer. I had quite recovered my notorious sang-froid, and I
laughed.</p>

<p>"Now, how can I answer that, my dear Major Haynes," I said
humorously. "Supposing I were a German, which of course I am not,
and supposing you are a Briton, which of course you are, how can
we determine the extent of our various country-loving? Goethe
says&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blow Goethe!" said Major Haynes rudely. "Can you answer my
question?"</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I replied, "I cannot."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Major Haynes. He looked at his watch. "You
will not tell me the code."</p>

<p>"I know of no code," I replied firmly. He picked up the little
gold whistle and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Very good," he said again, "you will report to me here at
1:30 this afternoon. You will be immediately admitted to my
presence."</p>

<p>"And then?" I said in trepidation.</p>

<p>"Then I will give you the finest lunch you have had for some
time and a bottle of the best <i>Liebfraumilch</i> procurable in
London."</p>

<p>I went down the marble stairs of the War Office smiling. If
this fellow imagined that he could buy my so precious secret for
a lunch, or that he could make me so beastly intoxicated on the
wine of my country, he was a bigger fool than I had imagined.</p>

<p>No sooner was I ushered into his office at 1:30 than he took
his hat and his stick from a peg on the wall and taking me
affectionately by the arm he led me out into Whitehall, hailed a
taxi, and we were driven to a restaurant in the Strand, where an
excellent repast was waiting.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you think we are lunching luxuriously," he
said, as we sat at the table, "but as this is the last meal that
either you or I may ever have in this world I think we may risk
being considered extravagant."</p>

<p>"These are strange words, Major Haynes," I said, "Very
strange," he replied with his foolish smile. "Wine, Heine? Drink
hearty or, as they say, 'Eat, drink and be merry, for to-morrow
we die.' Cheerio!"</p>

<p>Throughout that amazing meal, I was puzzling my brains. I
think I may say without undue conceit that I can grasp a
situation as quickly as any man. I am, so to speak, up to the
tricks of the game&mdash;and then some. That is not low swank. We
Germans say no more than we mean, promise no more than we can
perform, claim no more than we can substantiate. That is why we
are the most respected nation in the world, and why the German
sword, once drawn from its sacred scabbard and brandished aloft,
strikes terror to the heart of its soon-to-be victims.</p>

<p>But despite my mind ability I could only puzzle over his
alarming words and in the end find no solution to the mystery he
had propounded. The British are strange people with no sense of
decency. They frequently joke upon the most sacred subjects, and
I have already described Major Haynes's terrible lack of true
gentlemanliness in speaking of our August Sovereign Lord.
Possibly, I thought, this joke is British or Scottish idea of
humour. What pawkity!</p>

<p>He did not make any further reference to the discussion we had
that afternoon. We finished our meal with coffee and liqueurs and
cigars, and he paid his bill and we strolled out into the Strand.
I offered him my hand when we got outside, and thanked him for
his hospitality.</p>

<p>"You are not going, Heine," said the Major, "oh, dear no! You
don't suppose I have spent quite a lot of money in entertaining
you for the pleasure of your society, though I admit you are
infinitely amusing."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand you, Major Haynes," said I in
surprise; "if there is anything you want me to do I shall be most
happy to do it, as I have told you before."</p>

<p>"It is now three o'clock," he said, "and we have just twenty
minutes to get to the station."</p>

<p>"To the station?" I repeated, flabberfounded so to speak.</p>

<p>He made a beckoning gesture, and a car which was at the other
side of the Strand drew across.</p>

<p>"Hop in, Heine," he said; and I hopped. He took his place by
my side and we were whirled away to Paddington Station. He did
not take a ticket. He simply strolled through the first-class
booking-hall on to the platform, and a train was waiting, also
another officer who, saluting Major Haynes, led us to a carriage
which had been reserved.</p>

<p>"Get in, Heine," said the Major, and again I obeyed, still
dazed and bewildered by the mysterious proceedings. The second
officer got in with us.</p>

<p>"I have telephoned to the factory, sir," he said, "and I have
brought the things you wanted."</p>

<p>He put his hands into his overcoat and took out three pairs of
handcuffs.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Major Haynes.</p>

<p>"The other thing, sir, I couldn't get, but I think a gas-mask
would do as well, one of the old type. They are not so
cumbersome."</p>

<p>From another pocket he drew forth a mask, with mica eyepieces.
It had evidently been adapted for a special purpose, for it had
been cut off at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Try that on, Heine," said the Major. I took it from his hands
and fixed the loops over my ears.</p>

<p>"Look at yourself in the glass," said Major Haynes. One of the
panels above the seats was a long strip of mirror. "Your own
mother wouldn't recognize you," he said.</p>

<p>A hideous sight I presented. The mask did not cover my face.
It left my mouth free. I could not imagine a more horrible
spectacle than I presented.</p>

<p>"Fine," said the Major, "put it in your pocket. I think that
is all, isn't it, Mr. Samson?"</p>

<p>"That's all, sir," said the officer, saluting. He looked at me
with a smile, shook hands with the Major, and left us together.
Soon after this the train began to move and, leaning forward, I
spoke:</p>

<p>"I am sure you will not consider me unnecessarily
inquisitive," I said with gentle sarcasm, "but may I ask why we
are taking this journey, why you are carrying manacles, and why
you have presented me with this curious mask?"</p>

<p>"You may ask," said the Major, "but I shall not tell you for
some time. Here is a copy of Punch. Improve your mind and
morals."</p>

<p>The train was an express. It did not stop until we reached a
junction called Wellsbury, and here we alighted. It was now
half-past one. A closed car was waiting for us and into this we got
and proceeded at a rapid pace through the open country. We had
been travelling for half an hour, and had reached the top of a
hill and were passing over the crest, when the Major tapped the
window behind the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"Get out here for a moment, Heine," he said, and obediently I
followed, We were on the top of a hill looking down on to a
little village, the principal feature of which was a large
factory. On the tops of the hills were a number of hutments, and
it was clear to me that this was a factory erected for war
work.</p>

<p>"This is the Chamborn Shell-Filling Factory," said Major
Haynes. "That large building is the mixing house That smaller
building behind, which you can just see in spite of its being
camouflaged, is the T.N.T store. That long building is the
magazine, and that to its right is the live-shell store. There is
at this moment in that factory about two hundred tons of T.N.T.,
and when I tell you that at the Rivertown explosion, which shook
up half of England, only fifty tons were touched off, you will
understand the nature of the disaster which would follow the
blowing up of that establishment."</p>

<p>"But, Major Haynes," I said in desperation, "why do you tell
me all this and why do you bring me such a long journey to give
me this information?"</p>

<p>"Get into the car," said Major Haynes, "and I will tell
you."</p>

<p>We got into the car, but he did not speak and when I suggested
he should keep his promise he merely said: "Wait awhile."</p>

<p>We passed through the stone-pillared gates of the factory,
along a broad roadway, and came to a set of offices where the car
stopped and we alighted. Again the Major looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Six o'clock," he said, "we have an hour. I want to introduce
you to the manager of the works."</p>

<p>He led me into an office which was comfortably furnished, and
here I met Mr. Perkins, a well-fed typical Englishman, who hoped
I had had a pleasant journey down. A servant brought tea on a
silver tray and we chatted generally about various topics, though
for my part I had very little to say. After about half an hour
the Major again looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you good-bye, Mr. Perkins," he said, "I hope
everything is all right."</p>

<p>A shrill hooter sounded outside.</p>

<p>"I am stopping the women working," said Mr. Perkins, and Major
Haynes nodded.</p>

<p>"I think you are wise. You are getting them out of the factory
on some excuse, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr, Perkins, "I told them we were having a test in
the mixing-room and they quite understand."</p>

<p>I stood with Major Haynes at the entrance of the offices
watching the ceaseless stream of women passing through the gates.
My blood boiled as I thought these women were preparing
explosives to destroy my countrymen. How un-feminine, I thought!
How degraded! Woman, lovely woman, who should create life, who
should be all tenderness and kindness to man, was now engaged in
the low occupation of making shells to blow off the heads of the
world's chosen people. It sickened me.</p>

<p>"Aha! My fine girls," I said between my teeth, "you are not
the only flies in the ointment, for every son of the Fatherland
you kill, loyal and death-defying German women are preparing
explosives to blow off the heads of your husbands and
sweethearts! Beware! Nemesis is on your track!"</p>

<p>I hated this place with its smoke and busy air. Such places
should be blown from the face of the earth. I hoped it would not
be blown while I was nearby, but I looked forward one day to
reading in the paper that Chamborn had gone up to the sky in
smoke and fury.</p>

<p>"Now, Heine," said Major Haynes. We walked across the road,
down another road, then between two long stone buildings, past a
big power-house with two smoking chimneys, and at last we came to
a great brick shed painted in fantastic colours.</p>

<p>"This is the T.N.T. store," explained Major Haynes, "Now where
are those chairs that Perkins said&mdash;Oh, here they are."</p>

<p>Two arm-chairs had been placed against the wall. There was a
small iron-topped table with a bottle of whisky, a big syphon of
soda and two glasses.</p>

<p>"Sit down and make your miserable life happy, Heine," said the
Major, sinking down into one of the chairs and reaching out for
the whisky bottle. "Say when."</p>

<p>When he had filled the glass with sizzling soda, he said:
"Heine, it is an awful thing to realize that within thirty
minutes you and I may be blotted out of life&mdash;be dissolved
in thin air, leaving no trace of ourselves and never knowing what
struck us."</p>

<p>My glass trembled against my teeth and I put down the whisky
untasted.</p>

<p>"Explain yourself, Major Haynes," I said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I will explain to you, Heine," he replied gravely, "I feel it
is due to you. You are probably aware that Chamborn is the most
important shell-filling factory in England. If you are not so
aware I will tell you that it is. If this place went up in smoke
the British Army would be seriously inconvenienced, though not
crippled. Your friends in Berlin imagine that its destruction
would have decisive consequences, and in this, of course they are
wrong, for there are other factories, quite a large number of
them. They have sent two or three agents from Germany," he went
on slowly, "and they are clever men." I did not answer, I looked
at the clock above the offices and noted that the gold hands upon
the black face stood at twenty minutes to seven.</p>

<p>The Major followed my eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>"We have twenty minutes," he said</p>

<p>"What do you mean by all this?" I asked in an agitated voice,
my agitation being of course due to the presence in England of
three gentlemen who were probably well-born and my superiors.
"What do you mean by three agents?"</p>

<p>"Two or three," corrected Major Haynes, "my information is
that there are two; my further information is that they are
employed in these works; that they speak English so perfectly
that it is impossible to detect them, that they are armed with
all sorts of credentials; and&mdash;" he paused, "that they
intend blowing up this factory at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>I half rose from my seat, but he laid his hand upon my arm and
pushed me back. "We have taken the most elaborate
precautions&mdash;when I say we," he apologized, "I mean the
Government. We have weeded out suspicious work-men, but we are
still certain that these men have in some way connected up a
means of detonation which they will touch off at seven o'clock
to-night."</p>

<p>The place swam round. I could feel my knees trembling against
the supports of the iron table. My throat and mouth went dry and
I could only look round helplessly. Major Haynes was quite
cool.</p>

<p>"The only way to save this place from destruction," he said,
"is to bring the men who are engaged in this work to our presence
before the mischief is done, and you, Heine, are the syren who
will call them."</p>

<p>He put his hands in his breast-pocket and took out my little
gold whistle and laid it on the table.</p>

<p>"You may not know the code of the danger whistle, but you may
guess it," he said. " If you are telling the truth and you don't
know the code, then it is very unfortunate for you and most
unfortunate for me, because in a little over a quarter of an
hour, you and I, my dear Heine, will be continuing our debate in
heaven."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;" I gasped.</p>

<p>"It is no use butting, my dear lad," said the Major, "you will
be butting your bead into that wall in less than sixteen minutes
unless you can bring your loyal but startled fellow-countrymen to
this spot."</p>

<p>I picked up the whistle in my shaking fingers.</p>

<p>"But it would be death to me," I said, "and besides, Major
Haynes, I am a loyal man. I cannot betray my friends to their
death."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a patriot," said the Major. "It seems to me that
you are almost as good a patriot as I am. In which case we shall
both die without remorse."</p>

<p>I thought and I thought. Twice I picked up the whistle and
twice I put it down. The hands of the clock moved round
inexorably. It wanted four minutes to the hour when I turned my
perspirationed face towards him.</p>

<p>"They will know I betrayed them," I said; "they will see
me."</p>

<p>"You have a mask in your pocket, which I have thoughtfully
provided," said the Major. "Put it on, my dear Heine, there are
three minutes between you and glory."</p>

<p>With trembling hands I fixed the hideous mask. Better, I
thought, that these unfortunate men should be detected and that a
great and hideous crime should be prevented than that one whose
life was of such service to the Fatherland should be so cruelly
extinguished.</p>

<p>I put the whistle to my lips and blew shrilly; short, long and
trilling blasts, I repeated it, and scarcely had the echoes died
away when two men came blundering round the corner of the
building, one in his shirt-sleeves, one in the black coat of a
clerk. They stopped dead as they saw Major Haynes, and put up
their hands, for his revolver was covering them.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, gentlemen," he said as he snapped the handcuffs
upon them, "Fortunes of war." They glared from him to me, and
one said to the other quickly in German: "We're caught. This is
Voss's work. We ought to have prevented his leaving us."</p>

<p>"Excellent news," said Major Haynes briefly, "so Voss was the
third man. You may comfort yourselves with the knowledge that he
was arrested in London&mdash;to-day, though your detection was
not due to him but to my friend here." I was trembling before the
glare of those haughty German eyes.</p>

<p>"If you'd given us another day," one of them growled in
English, "we'd have settled your cursed factory."</p>

<p>"So I gather," said Major Haynes. "As for this swine," he made
a movement towards me and I stepped back till I realized I was
stepping toward the T.N.T. store, when I stepped sideways. But
the place was alive with detectives now. They seemed to spring
out of the ground and I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw these
unfortunate men being led away.</p>

<p>"You can take off your mask now, Heine, they will never see
you," said Major Haynes. "Poor devils! We will go up to town by a
late train and I'll see what I can do for you in the morning."</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said brokenly, "I don't want to see you
to-morrow. I am very ill. The danger I have been through, the
strain upon my nerves, how I envy you your coolness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The strain upon your nerves, Heine?" said Major Haynes, with
brutal innocence.</p>

<p>"I have not your lack of imagination," I said crossly. "I can
not sit here waiting for a factory to blow up, watching the
minutes pass." I wiped my brow with a silk handkerchief, looked
up at the clock as it struck seven, and shuddered.</p>

<p>"There was no danger, my dear man," said the Major calmly.</p>

<p>"But you told me that they were going to blow up the factory
at seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Major Haynes, "you heard what the gentleman
told you, seven o'clock."</p>

<p>'Well, this is seven o'clock," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I meant seven o'clock to-morrow night," said the
Major.</p>

<p>Such a bluffer!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story17" name="story17">17. &mdash; THE COMING OF THE
BOLSHEVIKS</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, May 11, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">IF there is one quality which we Germans possess
in a superlative quantity it is a sense of justice. We Germans
may be proud, we may be too soft-hearted, we may be romantic, but
we are just. The idea of injustice is abhorrent to the
truly-German. How many quarrels have I seen at the dining tables
in the various German pensions in which I have lived, because one
good German thought another was getting too large a helping! You
see it in every phase of life, and must confess that in my own
case, nothing so irritates me, so rouses my deep German wrath,
which is a terrible thing in itself, as the knowledge that I am
not getting my share.</p>

<p>Understand that I say nothing which may be taken as
disparaging to the heads of those departments under whose
guidance I have worked and for whose interest I have taken
risks&mdash;risks which have not been compensated by the meagre
salary and the grudging letters of thanks which I have received.
We Germans are people of iron will and determination. We are
perhaps the best disciplined people in the world. Give a German
an order to go into battle or to walk to the cannon's mouth,
whether it is loaded or not, and he will obey, marching with
parade step and a calm, stern face to what may very easily be
considerable personal disfigurement.</p>

<p>I myself have taken orders from my superiors with a sharp
"<i>Ja, Herr!</i>" and a stern salute, well knowing that if I
carried those orders out I would be going to certain destruction.
Many of those orders I have obeyed, having carefully reconnoitred
the way and discovered the dangers which might be avoided, for
none but a fool would rush bat-eyed into terrible perils if he
could avoid them.</p>

<p>I have explained the circumstances under which I came to be
under a cloud, not only with the British Government, but,
alas!&mdash;and my soul weeps at the thought!&mdash;with the
Government of my beloved Fatherland. I make no complaint. We
Germans never whine. We have in the Wilhelmstrasse men without
imagination, men without gratitude, men with the brains of
she-asses.</p>

<p>After my deportation from England and the torpedoing of the
ship which carried me, and my return to these shores on a
submarine, I ceased to be what I was, the recognized head and
centre of the Intelligence Service of the Fatherland in England.
Though I had worked independently, I had worked without
success.</p>

<p>Major Haynes, of the British Intelligence Corps, knew I was in
England, probably had me watched night and day, and was, as the
English saying goes, "fair to my face but bitter to my
stomach."</p>

<p>I do not know whether I must hate this man, or whether, in my
professional zeal, admire one who must be clever&mdash;why should
I deny it &mdash; since he had got the better of me. He was a
suave, calm man with a foolish sense of humour which no German
would ever understand, a cynical man who had probably been
crossed in love in his earlier life&mdash;possibly by some
beautiful German girl, who lured the poor fool on and then threw
him over with a sneer. I often used to lie in bed picturing the
circumstances which brought about his snarling views of Germany,
and often I have enacted the scene, in which I was the beautiful
young girl.</p>

<p>What bitter things I have said to him! How I have tossed my
locks at this proud Englishman or Scotsman, standing pale and
dejected before me begging for one rose from my hair!</p>

<p>I had plenty of time to dream. I was out of touch with the
organization I had created with so much labour, forethought and
genius. I was unattached and officially unrecognized. I suspected
that someone else had taken on my work, but I found it difficult
to discover who was in my place owing to the embargo which Major
Haynes had laid upon me against communicating with certain
people, the names of whom in some mysterious way this cunning man
knew, who might inform me upon the situation.</p>

<p>I was sitting one day, morose and brooding, in my new lodgings
in Bayswater, meditating upon my fallen state and wondering if I
had very much farther to fall, I confess there were tears in my
eyes when I remembered the power I had wielded, all the wonderful
letters of encouragement which had come to me from the well-born
and illustrious Captain Baron von Hatzfeld, the chief of the
Military Intelligence Department; and of how I was now without
recognition, a fugitive hunted on the face of the earth,
doubtless mocked at by men to whom I had extended a helping
hand.</p>

<p>It was near coffee-time, that is to say, nearly four o'clock
in the afternoon, when a knock came on my bedroom door and my
landlady entered with telegram in her hand.</p>

<p>"For you, Mr. Smith," she said. I had given the name of Smith
because I thought it was not likely to attract unusual attention.
It is a name very commonly used in England by people who wish to
remain anonymous.</p>

<p>"For me, my dear madam?" I said, taking the telegram in my
hand. "Oh yes, I remember. A friend of mine is coming to London
and he promised to wire the hour of his arrival." With this
pleasant little fiction I waved her out of the room.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I gave any excuse at all, but we Germans
are by nature furtive, and it is part of my business to puzzle
and deceive those with whom I am brought into contact. I opened
the telegram. My address was only known to two or three people
and none of these were compatriots of mine.</p>

<p>Judge then of my surprise when I saw that it was a cable
addressed to me from Stockholm, and read:</p><br>

<p class="telegram">"TWENTY-FIVE KEGS OF BUTTER CONSIGNED TO YOU
PER THE SCANDIA EXPORT COMPANY."</p>

<p>The telegram was signed "Fredericks." I needed no code-book to
understand that message. It was an order from a very powerful and
an extremely illustrious member of my profession, a gentleman
with whom I had had some correspondence and, indeed, one whom I
had met on the occasion to which I have referred in these stories
of my purchasing a newspaper.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five kegs" meant "call upon."</p>

<p>The next morning I sallied forth. A glance at a telephone book
in one of the telephone boxes told me the address of the Scandia
Export Company, which was in Upper Thames Street. You would
think, of course, that I made my way direct to my objective. That
was not the case. I had seen in the telephone book that the
Scandia Company, with whom, by the way, I had never had any
previous dealings, was a wholesale provision merchant.</p>

<p>I hired a cab and drove off to Bisbury's, one of the greatest
wholesale provision merchants in London, asked to see the manager
and demanded from him whether he could supply me with twenty-five
firkins of Danish butter at the current price. Butter at this
time was getting very scarce and the polite manager informed me
that it was impossible for him to supply me.</p>

<p>I drove to another provision merchant's, this time in Long
Acre, and repeated my request. Here an offer was made to sell me
the amount I required, and I noted the price and said I would
call again. From thence my cab took me into the south of London
to another butter merchant, who was unable to supply me. And so
one after the other I called upon six firms, all of which did
business in butter, before I touched the Scandia Export
Company.</p>

<p>I am no fool. We Germans are wide awake. I knew, or guessed,
that Mr., or Major, Haynes (a more un-military person I have
never seen) would have me watched and that probably my shadow was
following me now.</p>

<p>How puzzled he would be! What! Was Heine thinking of opening a
butter shop that he went to all these great merchants? No, sir.
Heine would be no butter-patter, but Heine knew that he had an
excuse for calling at the Scandia Company, and that it was no
more suspicious to call upon this particular firm than it was to
call upon the half a dozen whom he had already visited, or the
three or four more that he would visit in the course of the
day.</p>

<p>And so I came to the Scandia Company and found its offices on
the first floor of a very dark and untidy building. I was met by
a clerk in a large and gloomy room which was furnished with a
desk, a stool and a copying press, and politely stated my
business.</p>

<p>"You wish to see Mr. Brantl, I think," said the clerk. "If you
will wait a moment I will find out if he is engaged." He went out
of the room through a glass-panelled door and was away for a few
minutes. Presently he returned leaving the door open.</p>

<p>"Will you step this way?" he said, and I passed into the room,
closing the door behind me. Mr. Brantl was a short, thick-set man
with a close-cropped beard who looked at me sharply through his
gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he said imperiously, and then without a word of
preliminary he plunged into what I can only describe as an
impertinent and ill-tongued harangue.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Heine," he said, and by his simple, direct
rudeness I perceived that he was no more of a Swede than a turnip
(a play on words which is called a "pun" in English), but a true
Prussian and probably very highly connected. "You have made a
mess of things."</p>

<p>I stared at the man. "I don't understand you," I said
coldly.</p>

<p>"You've made a mess of things, and don't interrupt me," he
barked. "Headquarters are crazy with you. You upset all their
arrangements and you have left your work in England in a
disgraceful condition. Don't interrupt me! You know me?"</p>

<p>I looked at him closely. "I only know," I said after a pause,
and speaking with a hauteur which was quite unmistakable to any
sensitive German, "that you are impertinently discussing a matter
of which I am perfectly ignorant. I can only say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now shut up," said Mr. Brantl. "Swine! Pig! Miserable thief!
Have you never heard of the Captain Baron von Hatzfeld?"</p>

<p>I stared at him closely and gasped. Instantly I was on my
feet, clicking my heels, my hand raised to my forehead, for this
gentleman was the illustrious Chief of the Intelligence Bureau,
whom l had had the honour and privilege to see on one occasion
through the window.</p>

<p>"Sit down," he growled. "I have had to come to England to
clear up the damned mess you've made and I can tell you I am not
feeling cheerful about it. Now tell me what happened."</p>

<p>Briefly I explained to him how Major Haynes had detected me
and had sent me out of the country. I also described my voyage
back in a the submarine and he listened attentively.</p>

<p>"Part of what you tell me is lies," he said, "part of it is
true. British Intelligence Department&mdash;bah! If you hadn't
been a sucking dove, or should I say, a sucking pig&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Whichever pleases you, Herr Baron," I said, with a little
smile.</p>

<p>"Don't you grin, you baboon. If you had exercised the
slightest caution you would never have been caught. You have
simply given yourself into the hands of the Englishman."</p>

<p>"Scotsman," I murmured.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt," he roared, "you needn't be afraid of Haynes,
or whatever the man's name is. You have now a chance
to rehabilitate yourself in the esteem of the Department. I never
agreed to your coming to England. It was against my wishes. Thank
God I told von Papen that I wanted a man of intelligence who at
any rate looked like an English gentleman."</p>

<p>"I flatter myself&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"You do," said the Herr Baron, "that's the trouble with you,
your infernal conceit. Now listen and don't interrupt. In three
days' time there will arrive in this country a very large number
of forged bank and treasury notes. Every agent in England and
Scotland will put those notes into circulation. They are so well
done that you can't tell the difference between them and the real
thing. They are, in fact," he said, "made&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;in Germany," I smiled.</p>

<p>He cursed me for interrupting him.</p>

<p>"You will be in Merson Street, Soho, on Thursday night,
standing outside the Petite Dejeuner restaurant. A man will come
and give you a large travelling case. It will contain the forged
money, and you will spend the rest of your time wandering about
England getting rid of it. It will not be an unpleasant
experience," he said.</p>

<p>"The forgeries will never be detected until the money comes to
the Bank of England. Therefore your job is to get as far away
from London as you possible can."</p>

<p>"But I shall never be able to spend it."</p>

<p>"Give it away, then," said the Herr Baron. "You understand
your orders?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I replied.</p>

<p>"You won't want any real money. You want buy everything except
war bonds."</p>

<p>"I would not think of doing anything so unpatriotic," I cried
indignantly.</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of patriotism, you fool. War bond money
comes back to the Bank."</p>

<p>He was silent so long that at last I plucked up my courage to
say: "Is that all, Herr Baron?"</p>

<p>"No, that is not all," he said slowly, "only I don't know
whether I can trust you with the other matter."</p>

<p>I drew myself up.</p>

<p>"I have been entrusted with many delicate duties," I said, not
without a certain quiet dignity.</p>

<p>"And you made a mess of 'em. I know all about it," said the
Baron, "still I can tell you this because it may not come your
way. Have you heard of Loski?"</p>

<p>To another man I should have said "Yes," but to this
discerning, thought-reading, truth-compelling German, who was,
moreover, of the highest nobility, I replied simply and modestly:
"No."</p>

<p>"Loski is the chief of the Lithuanian Soviet. He is a member
of the Supreme Council at Petrograd, and is a
Bolshevik&mdash;hang all Bolsheviks! but they are very useful to
us. The mad English Government has given him permission to visit
this country on behalf of some industrial corporation at Moscow.
I have had a telegram from Stockholm to say that he will be here
this week. Now, don't forget, this man is working for us, and if
he swims into your orbit you are to do everything you can for
him. Render him any assistance that lies in your power. Find out
where he is lodging and make his acquaintance. That is all."</p>

<p>I bowed and withdrew. I must confess that on my journey back
to my lodgings I was troubled. I did not share this bullying,
browbeating, stupid man's views of Major Haynes. We Germans never
despise an enemy who is worthy of our steel, and I felt that
Major Haynes was not only worthy of my steel, but my carving
knife as well. It is hard to jest with a sad heart! So I was not
surprised the following morning when my landlady came to tell me
that a soldier had come with a message.</p>

<p>He was quite a common soldier, evidently an orderly, and when
he was shown into my room I immediately put him into his place by
telling him to take his cap off. The fact that he took not the
slightest notice of what I said, shows that the English Army is
the worst disciplined and the least respectful of all armies in
the world.</p>

<p>I read the note. It was from Major Haynes, telling me to come
to his office with the least possible delay.</p>

<p>"Tell your master I will be there," I said haughtily,</p>

<p>"Tell who?" said the common soldier.</p>

<p>"Your master, my man."</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together," said the common soldier, "do you
mean Major Haynes?" Of course the low fellow called him 'Aynes. I
resolved to report him for his insolence, but somehow the idea
slipped from my mind on the journey, because I was in some
apprehension (why should I conceal the fact?) as to why this
officer wanted me.</p>

<p>He was busily writing as I entered and jerked his head to a
chair and, since I am a perfect gentleman, I did not interrupt
him until he had finished. He blotted his letter and folded it up
into an envelope before he turned his attention to me.</p>

<p>"I've got a little honest work for you."</p>

<p>I shivered at the words. I remembered the last time I had
assisted him, and he evidently read my thoughts.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is all right," he said with a smile, "no danger,
Heine. You are a good German, I believe?"</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. "What is the use of arguing with you,
Major Haynes?" I said with a smile. "If I were a German I should
certainly be a good German."</p>

<p>"And every good German is afraid of the Russian."</p>

<p>"We Germans fear nobody," I said hotly, and then realizing
that I had betrayed myself, I went on with scarcely a break, "as
a German would say."</p>

<p>"Neatly put," said the Major, "at any rate a well conducted
German does not love the Bolshevik, and especially a Bolshevik
who is not even&mdash;there, I nearly said too much," he smiled,
"and that is not like me, is it?"</p>

<p>I could have told him that anything he said to me was too
much, but I refrained.</p>

<p>"Foreign as I know it to be to your honest nature," the Major
went on, "I am, nevertheless, asking you to do a little
professional espionage work for me&mdash;oh, yes, I am serious,"
he said, "you owe me a great deal, Heine. You owe me your life
amongst other things, and I am going to give you a chance of
paying me back, or rather paying the Government back, without
necessarily betraying any of your own fellow countrymen. From
such a prospect as that," he said with pious hypocrisy, "my very
soul revolts."</p>

<p>And this man who had the brazen effrontery to make a
so-canting statement had deliberately forced me to assist him in
capturing two of my lamentable fellow-countrymen only a few weeks
before! Such is the boasted honour of the British race!</p>

<p>"In reality," said the Major, "the work I want you to do is
very simple, very harmless and yet very necessary, and I believe
that you, of all the people I know, can best perform the service
I require."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"There is a man arriving in this country in the course of this
week, named Loski," said the Major. "He may be a Russian patriot.
He may be an anarchist. He may be only a simple-minded burglar.
On the other hand, he may be engaged by your clever Intelligence
Department to carry on propaganda work. There is a man in London
named Missovitch who I know is in correspondence with the Loski
crowd and is their agent in London. Missovitch lives at 364, Dean
Street, Soho. I will write the address for you," he said, suiting
the action to the words.</p>

<p>"And what do you expect me to do, Major Haynes?" I asked</p>

<p>"I want you to see Missovitch. He is one of those peculiar
Russians who speaks German, the type with which you are well
acquainted."</p>

<p>"Probably from the Baltic Provinces?" I said boldly.</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Major Haynes, with a smile. "Pump him. He
will confide in you. Nobody would mistake you for an English
gentleman. Find out what the game is. No harm can come to our
friend Loski. The worst that can happen is that he will be handed
his passports and returned to the place from whence he came."</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief and was inwardly chuckling.
Somehow I felt in the swing again, an entire master of my
confidence.</p>

<p>I found Missovitch without any trouble. He kept a little
tobacconist's shop at the address Major Haynes had given me, a
pale, unhealthy young man with a slight moustache and a fringe of
beard. He was not very communicative. I might say that from the
very moment I entered the shop till I left he regarded me with
suspicion which he did not attempt to disguise.</p>

<p>I was in a quandary because I could not betray my knowledge of
Loski, nor could I tell this unauthorized person that I was an
agent of the great German Government that wished him no harm. He
grew more and more uneasy at my careless questions, and to my
amazement he also grew paler, and beads of perspiration grew upon
his brow as I asked one question after another.</p>

<p>"I don't know who you are, sir," he said at last, " but I
assure you I have not any knowledge of the Bolsheviks, and I am
not interested in anything which is occurring in Russia."</p>

<p>"Come, come," I said jokingly, "that is fine talk from a man
with your name. Tell me, who is this Loski I hear so much about?"
He looked at me through his half-closed lids.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "if you are the police I can give you no
information. You may arrest me," he said excitedly, though I
tried to calm him, "you may put me in jail, but I can tell you
nothing, and Ivanoff's trouble will be in vain. I am a poor
shop-keeper trying to earn my living. l don't know anything about
the Bolsheviks, anything about M. Loski. I know nothing,
nothing."</p>

<p>This was a bad beginning I thought, as I left the shop,
wondering who was Ivanoff, and certainly not a satisfactory one
for Major Haynes. And yet in many ways it could not have been
better. I had but to tell the truth to Major Haynes and be
relieved of a rather embarrassing mission. Strangely enough, when
I reported to the Intelligence Officer, he accepted my word
without any query, though he was, I could see, rather
troubled.</p>

<p>"The man suspected you, that's bad," he said, frowning.
"Still, I'm sure, Heine, you did your best. By the way, he didn't
mention any other Russian person?"</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "he mentioned a man named&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ivanoff?" said the Major quickly.</p>

<p>"That's the name," I said, stupefied by his intelligence.</p>

<p>"H'm," said Major Haynes, "thank you, Heine. I will let you
know if I want you again."</p>

<p>I did not hear from the Major, but on the Thursday morning a
note was delivered to my lodgings, this time in the well-known
writing of Captain Baron von Hatzfeld. It ran simply:</p>

<p>"Cancel my previous instructions. Meet messenger to-night at
8.30, under the clock at King's Cross Station."</p>

<p>At eight o'clock I was at King's Cross. I gathered that I was
to meet the boat train which was coming in from the north. The
train itself was about five minutes late, and I composed myself
to read the evening newspaper to pass the time. I stood in a
little recess and away from observation, and I was immersed in my
newspaper when suddenly I heard a smothered cry, and, looking up,
I found myself face to face with Missovitch.</p>

<p>He was staring at me with horror. His face was no longer white
but green, and as I took a step towards him he put up his hands
with a strangled cry, and turning, ran like the wind, dodging
between passengers and porters and disappearing through the
archway that leads into the station. I was amazed. What was there
in my appearance which frightened him. Was he following me with
the intention of doing me bodily harm? The thought sent a cold
shiver down my spine.</p>

<p>But I had little time to speculate upon this mystery, for a
few minutes afterwards the boat train drew into the station, and
I took up my position under the clock and waited. The passengers
streamed through the narrow barriers, some bailing taxi-cabs,
some stopping to pick up other friends who were on the train,
some greeting those who were waiting for them.</p>

<p>I had no means of recognizing the man who was to bring me the
forged money, but I supposed that he had been well instructed. Do
not let it be thought that I was quite free from care, that in a
few moments I should be in possession of a vast number of
forgeries gave me no pleasure. Suppose anything went wrong!
Suppose I was captured! A fine end for a great agent, I don't
think, as they say in England.</p>

<p>Presently a man emerged from the crush about the barrier and
walked straight across to me, looking at me thoughtfully. He was
a tall man with a thin black moustache, and he stopped near
me.</p>

<p>"May I take your bag?" I asked softly in German. He smiled,
passed the bag to me, and we walked out of the station
together.</p>

<p>"Which way do you go?" I asked, still in the same
language.</p>

<p>"We shall meet at your place tonight," he said in a low voice.
He turned to the left and I turned to the right. My taxi-cab was
waiting, and I put the bag in. I turned back and saw two men leap
from the shadow upon my late companion. There was a struggle, I
heard a shot, and my blood turned to water. Summoning all my
reserves I said to the taxi-cab driver, in as calm a voice as I
could manage: "Bayswater Square," and in a few seconds I was
being whirled away, as I believed, from the greatest possible
danger, my mind filled with the most distressing and painful
thoughts.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="story18" name="story18">18. &mdash; THE GOING OF
HEINE</a></h2>

<h3>First published in <i>Thomson's Weekly News</i>, Dundee,
Scotland, May 18, 1918</h3>

<p class="first">PICTURE my feelings as I drove away from King's
Cross in a cab, with a fat suitcase at my feet. M. Missovitch had
most mysteriously been struck by terror at the sight of me and
bolted. The messenger with the bag had arrived and in answer to
my inquiry in German whether I should carry his bag had handed to
me and we had separated.</p>

<p>Scarcely had we parted than two mysterious men had leapt upon
him. There had been a struggle in the street, a shot had been
fired, and here was I driving off in a high condition of
perspiration, wondering how much the Government knew, whether
they were aware that I, Heine, was burdened with a bag full of
forged notes.</p>

<p>I summoned up courage to look back out of the window. I could
only see a crowd gathering in the half-darkness, and withdrew my
head. Should I throw the bag out of the window? If I did somebody
might see me and that would be fatal. Besides, I owed duty to the
Fatherland. My chest swelled at the thought.</p>

<p>I did not drive to my lodgings&mdash;believe me, I do not live
in Bayswater Square&mdash;but dismissed the man and pretended I
was going into one of the houses. I waited till he had driven
away and descended the steps and walked rapidly to my own humble
dwelling which was about two streets away. Here I admitted myself
with a key and went straight to my room, locking the door behind
me.</p>

<p>I realized that for the safety of the Fatherland and for the
honour of the great service, of which I was an unworthy member,
my first step must be to prove an alibi. With that forethought
which is so characteristically German, I had made myself
acquainted with Major Haynes' habits. I knew he spent evenings at
Brown's, a well-known club in the West End, and I immediately
called him up. To my surprise and delight I found he was
there.</p>

<p>"I wish to see you, Major Haynes," I said, "When will it be
convenient?"</p>

<p>"Come around to the club if it is important," replied his
voice, and having packed away the suitcase under my bed, I drove
to Brown's, and was met by the Major in the vestibule.</p>

<p>"Let us pretend you are not an alien enemy," he said, as he
signed my name in the book, "if it ever leaked out that I had
entertained a German spy I should be hauled before the committee
and asked to resign."</p>

<p>"You will have your joke, Major Haynes," I smiled.</p>

<p>"Won't I?" he asked. "Now tell me what is the trouble?"</p>

<p>I had made up my excuse in the car.</p>

<p>"When I reported to you that I had interviewed Missovitch," I
said, "you asked me if he had named anybody and I had replied
that he had mentioned a person named Ivanoff."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said the Major, "Alexis Ivanoff."</p>

<p>"It has occurred to me," I went on boldly, for I can be a
bluffer too and had played many games at poker, "that I know this
Ivanoff. Is he not an officer of the Preobrazhensky
Regiment?"</p>

<p>"To be exact," said the Major, "he is not."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said I, with a well-simulated disappointment, "then my
journey has been in vain."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, you have never heard of Alexis Ivanoff.
You don't believe he is a member of that regiment and you have
merely come round to pump me or," he looked at me with cold-devil
scrutinizing eyes, "or as an excuse to show yourself at"&mdash;
he looked up at the clock&mdash;"ten-thirty."</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said eagerly, though my marrow shook within
me. He did not take his eyes off me.</p>

<p>"There is some reason," he said slowly, "now own up,
Heine?"</p>

<p>We Germans are quick thinkers and the idea came to me as an
inspiration.</p>

<p>"I will be frank with you," I said, "I have been summoning up
my courage to ask you a favour, but my heart descended to my
shoes when I saw your official face."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I need permission to leave London," said I. "You were kind
enough to tell me that you would facilitate my journey to
America, and I have many real genuine, bona-fide businesses to do
in England before I depart."</p>

<p>He thought a moment. "I have no objection," he said. "When do
you expect to leave?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow," I replied.</p>

<p>"Now look here, Heine," he said. "I don't dislike you. You are
quite a decent fellow, but you have to promise me that you will
engage yourself in no espionage work, that you will not go into
any of the prohibited areas, and that you will report yourself to
me on your return to London."</p>

<p>"I promise," I said.</p>

<p>We shook hands and parted. Somehow I knew that this time, at
any rate, he was taking me at my word and I was not being
followed. Nevertheless, I altered my appearance as best I could,
but not until within two hours of my departure did I unlock that
suit-case which lay beneath my bed.</p>

<p>You will understand that I had a natural feeling of delicacy
about playing the common part of a forgery-distributor. You must
remember that I was a student of Heidelberg, that my parents were
people of honour, my father being a State district councillor
with a fourth-class order of the Red Eagle. Was it honourable,
thought I, to distribute forged money? More than that, was it
safe?</p>

<p>An examination of the contents of the case satisfied me and
filled me with a certain pride in the skill and genius of our
German workmen. There the money lay in great thick packets of £5,
£10, £50 and £100 notes with innumerable thicker packages of £1
treasury bills. And the cleverness of the forgeries! Not only
were they indistinguishable from real money, both in the texture
of the paper and in the colour of the printing, but every
bank-note bore a different number and the greater proportion of
them had the appearance of having been used very frequently.</p>

<p>You would never have suspected that these soiled notes, with
the fold marks upon them, were not what they pretended to be. I
must confess it gave me greater courage, and filled me with a
certain boyish satisfaction to know how many people would be
deceived.</p>

<p>I left that night for the North. My destination was Scotland,
and I reached Glasgow the following morning. I did not of course
put any money into circulation on the train. Heine is not exactly
a fool. He had to come back by that railway and a fine
flibberty-gibbet he would look if the so-handsomely-tipped guard
or the in-excess-paid sleeping-car attendant were to recognize
the man who had given him forged notes.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the adventures of that week. I
will not tell you how I passed my first £5 note and how I stood
in fear and trembling with my heart thumping so that even the
shopkeeper thought that an aeroplane was passing overhead; of how
I lived in terror for twenty-four hours lest my act be brought
home to me. I was soon to discover that I was chewing more than I
could bite. My friends, it requires an expert to put forged money
into circulation. It must be done note by note, and whenever I
offered large sums, like £50, people looked at me askance. In
Scotland I found it was almost impossible, because the Scottish
people have bank-notes of their own, queer pieces of paper that
looked as if they have fallen into the soup and pave been dried
in a dustbin. I came south of the line to Newcastle, staying at
an hotel not far from the station. My progress was painfully
slow. In one week I had only managed to get rid of £100 and most
of that was in £1 treasury notes, which were accepted without
question.</p>

<p>It was in Newcastle that I got my big fright. I had purchased
an £80 motor-bicycle and paid for it in notes, and after ordering
the machine to be sent to the hotel, I was leaving the shop when
the manager called me back.</p>

<p>"I don't think this £50 note of yours is in order, sir," he
said. I felt my knees tremble.</p>

<p>"Not in order?" I blustered. "My good man, are you mad?"</p>

<p>"I've got the number of a note here which is circulated by the
police as having been stolen. Will you accompany me to the bank?
They have the right numbers there and I may have made a
mistake."</p>

<p>To refuse would have been to invite suspicion. I put a bold
look upon my pale face and swaggered off in company with the
manager with true German insouciance. At the bank my trials and
tribulations (internal) can only be imagined by those who have
enjoyed a similar experience.</p>

<p>It was not the fear that this note would prove to be one which
had been stolen that filled my heart with wild fluttering (as a
young girl's when she is first told by a handsome Prussian lover
that he adores her), it was the <i>tremblement</i> of
apprehension that the bank manager would detect this so perfectly
imitated note as a forgery.</p>

<p>We were ushered into the bank manager's room, an evil,
sinister-looking man with a close-cut moustache. The shopkeeper
explained. For my part I stood a little behind him, having with
my usual thoroughness marked the way of retreat and made my plans
for a grand bolt. The bank manager took the note in his hand and
I set my teeth. He looked at it, turned it over, rustled it, laid
it on the desk, examined the number, then, pulling out a drawer,
he took a thin black book and opened it. He ran his finger down
page after page and at last he stopped.</p>

<p>"This must be the one, Mr. Speddings," he said. "I am afraid,
sir," he said, addressing me, "this gentleman has made a mistake.
Curiously enough, the number of this note is missing but it is
not in this series. Bank-notes, as you know," he explained, "have
a number and a series letter, and the stolen note fortunately is
not yours."</p>

<p>I bowed my head. Had I spoken my shaking voice would have
betrayed me. I shook hands with this benevolent-looking
Englishman, left the note in the shopkeeper's hands and, hailing
a cab, I drove back to my hotel. The shock quite upset me, and I
lay on the bed all that afternoon thinking of some way whereby
not only I could get a quicker departure of the money but a
method which enabled me to do so in safety.</p>

<p>They brought me up the afternoon newspapers and I turned the
pages idly. I have explained before, though the fact needs no
explanation, that we Germans leap to an idea as air to a vacuum.
It was something in the little smudged space reserved for the
latest news which attracted my attention. I rang the bell and the
porter came to me. I pretty shrewdly guessed that this man was
interested in the subject which I broached. All these porters and
common people of England are sport-hunters and race-horse punting
men, as they call them. I assumed the air of a bookmaker as he
came in, and said with a good imitation of a bettor:</p>

<p>"What's the odds for the three o'clock race! "</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>"What's the odds for the three o'clock race, my boy?" I said
jovially. "Six to four the field or ten to one bar one? " You see
I had got the jargon of the race-course by heart, though I
loathed and detested the races. A light dawned in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you want to know the prices of the three o'clock winner.
It's four to one, sir."</p>

<p>"Good," I replied jovially, and putting my hand in my pocket I
gave him a £5 note, to his great astonishment.</p>

<p>"Where is the horse-racing to-morrow?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Same place, sir," said the man when he had recovered from his
dumb-foundedness.</p>

<p>"Where?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, at Newmarket, sir."</p>

<p>"And is there racing on the following day?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied, "it is a three-day meeting. This is
the first day."</p>

<p>"Find me the best train for Newmarket, my good fellow," I
said; "for I am going down to back the field."</p>

<p>He was mystified by my knowledge of sporting terms. That was
easy to see. He went away and came back in about an hour, and
told me that the best thing I could do was to go to London on the
night train, and take another train from there to Newmarket, and
though I did not wish to appear in London, those were the steps I
took, arriving at London at seven o'clock in the morning and
leaving Liverpool Street Station at half-past eight.</p>

<p>I found on my arrival at that historic centre of gambling and
vice, that I was three hours too soon. My pockets were filled
with money, and I carried the remainder in my portmanteau. I had
some difficulty in finding a room at the hotel, but eventually I
was given a small apartment on the second floor of a gloomy inn.
I left my bag under the bed and strode out into the town,
congratulating myself upon the genius which had inspired me to
discover the most rapid way of putting money into
circulation.</p>

<p>It was a bright spring morning and the streets were crowded
with men who were strolling up and down, and who had evidently
spent the night in the town.</p>

<p>I took a brisk walk to what is known as the "Severalls," and
then, coming back, turned into the most respectable bar I could
find and ordered myself a whisky and soda. I made a great display
of my money &mdash; (Do you see Heine's plan?)&mdash;and several
sharp-looking men, who were watching me closely, exchanged
glances which I did not fail to see, though I proceeded
innocently to swallow my drink as though I were oblivious of
their presence.</p>

<p>By-and-by one of them came over to me and asked me if I had
seen the morning paper.</p>

<p>"I think I have met you before," he said, "at Ascot."</p>

<p>"It is very likely," I replied politely. "I usually go to
Ascot three or four times a year."</p>

<p>"Not for the racing? " he said, taken aback. "Yes," I
smiled.</p>

<p>"But," he said, "there's only one meeting at Ascot. A four-day
meeting in the summer."</p>

<p>"Exactly," I said, never at a loss for a reply. "I go every
day."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see what you mean," he said. Then, after a pause. "Do
you think Barleycorn will do it to-day?"</p>

<p>"Do what? " I asked, a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"Do you think Barleycorn will win?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," I said hastily, "Is it running? " He looked
at me queerly.</p>

<p>"Running? Is Barleycorn running for the Babraham handicap?
Why, of course it's running. It will start a hot favourite,
too."</p>

<p>"In that case," said I with a simulation of racing
intelligence, "in that case it will win. I must have a thousand
or so on," I said with careless indifference.</p>

<p>He swallowed hard.</p>

<p>"I know a very good thing for the first race," he said. "It's
a pinch."</p>

<p>"What a curious name for a horse," I said, with a gay
laugh.</p>

<p>"You're a comical chap," said the man, "What I mean is, this
horse is a certainty."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see what you mean," said I. "Forgive me if I am not
used to the patois, but you see I am a Chilean planter and I do
not speak very well." He nodded, and the puzzled look on his face
disappeared, and instead there settled that beautiful look of
peace and contentment which a man assumes when he has found an
unsuspected gold mine.</p>

<p>"I used to live in Chile myself," he said, "at least my
brother did. He is always talking about the Chileans&mdash;that's
where the chillies come from, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I nodded. I do not know where they come from, and I have only
been in Chile once in my life.</p>

<p>"Well, anything I can do for a stranger I am always willing to
do," he said. He was a stoutish man with a large gold watch-chain.
His face was clean-shaven and very red, and he wore a grey
Derby hat on the back of his head and three diamond rings on his
right hand. He asked me if I admired the rings and I told him I
did. He said they were diamonds and I did not tell him he was a
liar, for I know plate-glass when I see it. The end of it was
that we all went out to the course together.</p>

<p>On the way up he told me he knew a bookmaker who gave much
better odds than anybody else, and that if I cared to let him do
my commissions for me he would be happy to put me in the way of
making money. It transpired that the pinch was a horse called
Implex, and I handed over £150 with a coolness which took his
breath away. Implex did not win, and if he had won I should not
have got the money, because my new friend, whose name was Mike,
did not, so far as I could see, go near a bookmaker. He came back
full of apologies, expecting to find me wrathful, but I was
smiling and urbane.</p>

<p>He told me he had another pinch and that he could get ten to
one to a lot of money. I gave him ten notes of £50, the most
difficult notes of all to put into circulation, and he went into
the ring and came back and said that I stood to win £5,000. The
horse was called Molum. I saw that horse going down. I don't know
much about race-horses, but I know a horse when I see one. I
watched the race from the stand, but I did not see Molum till
after the race was over.</p>

<p>For some time Mike did not come near me, but just before the
third race he put in an appearance, full of sorrow and
unhappiness and expressed the wish that he would be deprived of
his sight if he was not the most disappointed man on the
course.</p>

<p>"But you can get all your money back on Barleycorn," he said.
"It's a pinch."</p>

<p>I gave the poor fellow £500 and then strolled into the ring. I
thought I might as well get rid of the money myself. It was a
very simple process. I had merely to go to a bookmaker and say
"Barleycorn," and he shouted a lot of figures in my face,
whereupon I would hand him money, his assistant writing something
in a book and giving me a ticket.</p>

<p>In this way I distributed over £2,000 and Barleycorn was
fourth, or he may have been tenth. When you realize that the
value of the money I had to distribute was nearly £50,000&mdash;I
did not count it, but made a rough calculation&mdash;you can
appreciate that fact that it went all too slowly. I could not
give the book-makers too much money for fear I excited comment.
There was only about a quarter of an hour during which they would
accept money. Some of them refused to take it.</p>

<p>On the fifth race Mike told me that a horse named Hippo was a
stone certainty, and when I went to a bookmaker and said "Hippo "
and handed him a lot of money he shook his head and said: "My
book's full."</p>

<p>"Get another book," I said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I can't take your money. I don't want to lay Hippo."</p>

<p>"What will you lay?" I said.</p>

<p>"I'll lay you six to one Jiggling Boy," he said.</p>

<p>"Then make it Jiggling Boy by all means." I handed him my
money and took his ticket. I knew that in story-books it would
happen that I could not get rid of my money and that the money I
put on the horses would be returned to me as winnings, but I
found no difficulty in discovering horses that could not win.</p>

<p>To my annoyance, however, I found that I had achieved the
result which I was most anxious to avoid. I had attracted
attention, and when the last race was over I found myself the
cynosure of all eyes. Men nudged one another as I passed through
the wicket-gate to the long road which leads to the town and I
heard them say:</p>

<p>"That's 'im. That's the mug," and use other admiring phrases.
I, Heine, who hated and despised the so-called sport, was already
famous as a gambling plunger in this home of rascality. Now, my
plan was a two-fold one and all was going well. Why should I
travel the country distributing forged money when I could find
somebody who would do it for me? I did not know the rascals of
England who received and distributed stolen notes, but I knew
that they existed, as they do in all countries. I knew that once
a bank is robbed, that, with almost lightning speed, the
bank-notes stolen are circulated and all traces of the thief are
hidden. Here, then, was the machinery for a rapid distribution
before the notes began to dribble back into the Bank of England
stamped "forgery" upon their faces. I was joined on the way back
to the town by Pike and one of his friends.</p>

<p>"You had had luck, Mister," said Pike. "But, never mind, I can
make your fortune to-morrow."</p>

<p>I smiled, inwardly. I could make his fortune that night.</p>

<p>"I don't intend staying for tomorrow's horse-racing," I
answered him. "I ought to go back to town. I don't think it is
safe for me to carry so much money about with me."</p>

<p>He looked at me.</p>

<p>"It is very dangerous to carry a lot of money about with you,
but bless you, this is a very law-abiding country, ain't it,
Alf?" addressing his companion.</p>

<p>"Too law-abiding," said the other, a tall, dismal man with a
drooping moustache.</p>

<p>"I can speak to you as a friend," I said to Mike, "of course
I wouldn't tell anybody else."</p>

<p>"You can trust me," said Mike, "with your life."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to ask your advice," I said. "There is a notice
in my bedroom saying that the landlord will not be responsible
for any money stolen unless it is deposited with him. Now, do you
think I am safe in trusting the proprietor of the Beacon Inn with
£30,000?"</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Mike tried to speak twice, and when
he did his voice was husky.</p>

<p>"Thirty thousand pounds," he said in a far-away voice; "no, I
don't think I would trust the landlord in that. It isn't fair to
him. So far as you've got it in a safe place, "under your bed, or
somewhere &mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly," I said, "It is under my bed, speaking as a
friend."</p>

<p>"Well, so long as it's there, leave it there," said Mike.
"It's the last place anybody would think of looking."</p>

<p>He accompanied me to the door of my lodgings, and I was
turning in when Mike said to his friend: "Look here, Alf, why
don't you take this gentleman and show him round the town. It's
worth seeing. There are some regular old antiquities here."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," I said, "if your friend does not object. And
you will accompany us?"</p>

<p>"I've got to see a man in here," he said, pointing to my inn;
"but I'll see you later."</p>

<p>For the next hour, under the guidance of the unhappy Alf, I
walked about Newmarket listening to my guide. Several times I
pretended that I wanted to go back to the hotel, but each time he
prevented me on some excuse or other. And all the time I was
chuckling. I knew the friend that Mike wanted to see was a
certain battered portmanteau under my bed filled with wonderful
treasure. By this time he would have caught the train and would
be on his way to London where his companion would join him later.
When at last I reached the inn, I paused out of curiosity to ask
the landlord if anybody had been for me. As I expected, a
gentleman had called and had gone upstairs saying that he had
come by invitation.</p>

<p>I walked up to my room, smiling broadly. I pulled the bag from
under the bed, that bag which had been a source of such bother
and worry, and back quivering, I pulled it out. As I expected it
was empty save for one thick packet of notes which as they were
wrapped in paper had evidently been left behind by the thief
under the impression that it was some of my personal
belongings.</p>

<p>I cursed him for his carelessness slipped the packet into my
pocket, and taking my few belongings I went downstairs gaily,
paid the bill, this time with genuine money from my own
pocket-book, and drove to the station. I could have sworn I saw
Alf in one of the carriages as I passed, but he turned his face
away quickly. Be not afraid my poor fellow! Didst thou but know,
thou and thy sneak-thief companion are unconscious instruments of
vengeance working the will of the Fatherland upon this perfidious
and mercenary England.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had the carriage to myself and was able to get
rid of the bag through the window choosing the moment when we
were crossing a small river for hiding the evidence.</p>

<p>I reached Liverpool Street Station at 9:20 feeling very
hungry. There were no taxi-cabs procurable and I went to the
station buffet to get a sandwich and a glass of beer. I saw no
sign of Alf, or of his thievish companion, and as a matter of
fact, I did not have the curiosity to look for them. It was
sufficient that I, Heine, had, by my tactics, distributed $60,000
worth of counterfeit coin for the glory of the Fatherland.</p>

<p>What was the object you may ask? Why all this trouble? Cannot
you see that whether it were true or merely a rumour, that there
was a great amount of forged notes in circulation, that the
credit of England at home and abroad would suffer, that people
would be loth to accept paper money, and that confidence, which
is the basis of exchange, would be destroyed? Truly we Germans
are great psychologists and understand the devious arts of making
war ruthlessly.</p>

<p>I resolved to call upon the illustrious Captain Baron von
Hatzfeld on the following morning, and explain to him that my
mission had been accomplished. After that I might turn my
attention to the Bolsheviks, and try to discover what their
little game was. I had had no time to think about them or to
puzzle my brains about the mysterious Ivanoff, but now that my
mission was accomplished, I could devote more time and attention
to that matter.</p>

<p>I stood outside the station waiting for an omnibus or
perchance, I thought, I might have the luck to find a taxi, when
a poorly dressed man who seemed to know what I was thinking
about, came to me and said:</p>

<p>"Are you looking for a taxi, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"You will find one round the corner," he said. "I'll show you
the way." He led me along the ill-lighted street into a deserted
thoroughfare, which led, I believe, into Finsbury Square. There
were no lights and there was no sign of a taxi-cab.</p>

<p>"It's round the corner, sir," said the man again. I had opened
my mouth to speak when suddenly a sack was thrown over my head. I
struggled, but I knew I was in the grip of two or three men. Then
I had been detected. Oh! the wild thoughts that coursed through
my brain I heard a voice say something, and to my amazement it
was in German.</p>

<p>I was lifted bodily from my feet and pushed into what I knew
was the interior of a motor-car, I heard the door slammed, and
presently the car moved. We had been travelling for twenty
minutes when it stopped, the door was again opened and I was
bundled out through a doorway down some stone stairs, led and
pushed along a passage and through another doorway. I heard the
doors closed and locked, and then the sack was removed from my
head. I was in a room about twenty feet square, and there were
about ten people present. They were foreign-looking men and knew
instinctively that the majority of them were Russians. As the
sack was whisked from my head a man, whom I recognized as
Missovitch, said: "That is the man."</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this outrage?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Heine," said an imperious voice. Such an evening of
surprises, for the man who spoke was none other than the
illustrious Captain Baron von Hatzfeld!</p>

<p>"Herr Baron," I stammered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure this is the man?" asked the Baron, turning to
Missovitch.</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain. I saw him take the bag."</p>

<p>"Then," said the Baron, "there will be no difficulty in
recovering the money. There was probably some mistake. Now
Heine," he said more kindly than usual, "this gentleman,"
pointing to a tall man with a red beard who was scowling at me,
"is Herr Loski."</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to meet you," I said.</p>

<p>"You were instructed by me last Thursday week to wait at a
station," said the Baron, "you were told to meet a messenger who
was bringing a bag of forged notes&mdash;I can speak freely
before you, gentlemen. That man arrived," he went on, turning to
me, "but you were not there to meet him."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Herr Baron," I said with a smile, "I not only met
him but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," said the Baron, "the man you met was one of M. Loski's
companions, who brought £65,000 to this country which had been
stolen from the Bank of Petrograd. When I say stolen I should
say," he said, with a bow to Herr Loski, "expropriated. Knowing
that the English agent of the bank, M. Alexis Ivanoff, had
procured a police warrant to arrest M. Loski, should the money be
found in his possession, Herr Loski employed another gentleman to
take the bag direct to M. Missovitch. Unfortunately he mistook
you for M. Missovitch, and the bag containing £65,000 (English)
passed into your possession. Where is the money?"</p>

<p>The room was swimming around me. It seemed like a horrible
dream. For two weeks I had been engaged in getting rid of that
money. I had bought impossible things which I had never handled.
I had gambled thousands on horses which could never win, and
finally I had deliberately tempted a thief to steal it.</p>

<p>"Where is that money?" said the Baron again. I drew myself
erect. "It is spent," I said. When silence fell again, when
everybody had stopped talking and crying and waving their hands,
the Baron spoke.</p>

<p>"You know Major Haynes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"You went to his club the night before you left London?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I admitted.</p>

<p>"You are accused of having betrayed the secrets of our
Department."</p>

<p>"Whoever accuses me of that," I cried indignantly, "is a
liar."</p>

<p>"I accuse you," thundered the Baron.</p>

<p>"Then you are a liar," I said. God knows how I mustered up the
courage to speak so to one so illustrious, but I did this in my
virtuous innocence. The Baron turned to the man called Loski. "My
Government will see that you are repaid," he said; "as to this
traitor, I think, gentlemen, for your own protection there is
only one thing to be done. This man was an agent of ours, but is
no longer in our service. He is in communication with the English
Intelligence Department, and what that means to us all, you
know."</p>

<p>The man called Missovitch bent forward eagerly and spoke in a
low tone and the Baron von Hatzfeld nodded. Missovitch said
something in Russian and I was instantly seized and thrown into a
chair, my hands pulled behind and handcuffed. Missovitch took off
his coat and took from his pocket a red cord which I watched with
a fascinated stare.</p>

<p>I remember it looked like one of those bell-pull you see in
old English houses, without the tassel. He stepped behind me and
I knew rather than saw, that he was making a slip-knot.</p>

<p>In those few ghastly moments I could not think clearly. I
could not pray, I could not scream. I could only sit open-mouthed
staring at the sneering face of one who called himself a German,
and yet could watch a fellow-countryman at die hands of the
barbarian.</p>

<p>"If you have anything to say, Heine, now is your time," said
the Baron.</p>

<p>I drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"I hope that Germany is beaten," I said, "and that swine like
you will black the boots of the Englishmen."</p>

<p>I had hardly finished speaking before the cord was pulled
round my neck. I felt the foot of Missovitch on the back of the
chair behind me as he prepared to take his grip. From where I sat
I could see the door, the key within it, and I could have sworn
that I saw the key turning as though some invisible hand on the
outside was gripping its end.</p>

<p>The cord tightened with a jerk, strangling the cry in my
throat. I felt a tremendous pressure of blood, a horrible,
unbearable sense of suffocation, and then:</p>

<p>"Hands up, everybody!"</p>

<p>The cord relaxed. I stared at the doorway and there stood
Major Haynes, revolver in hand, and behind him I saw the red caps
of the military police.</p>

<p>For a fortnight I lay prostrate in bed and saw nobody but
Major Haynes, who visited me occasionally.</p>

<p>He told me he had secured me a passport and a berth to
America, and also informed me that the ship was one of a convoy.
When I was up and well, and two days before I left, He came to
see me.</p>

<p>"You're going back to America, Heine, and the American police
have been informed of your little weakness. But you are going to
have a square deal and, unless you misbehave yourself, you will
not be interfered with."</p>

<p>"I have had enough, Major Haynes," I said, "I'm through."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't think you know the thing you have been risking,
Heine." For the first time he spoke very seriously, without any
of the facetiousness which was his peculiar <i>métier</i>. "You
think it is an exciting game and a clever game, but I am going to
guarantee that you will never engage in espionage work again. I
am going to send you back to the United States, cured. I want you
to stay the night at an hotel. I am going to get you up very
early to-morrow morning. Don't be afraid, I'm not going to ask
you to do anything for me," he smiled. "You are ready for the
voyage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Major Haynes," I said. "The boat train leaves at ten
o'clock to-morrow morning," he said, "but I shall want to see you
before that; in fact, I shall call at your hotel at five
o'clock."</p>

<p>I did not know what he was driving at, but I made no
objection. As how could I? With my passport and steamboat ticket
in my pocket and my trunk packed, I arrived at the little city
hotel which he had chosen, and at five o'clock on the following
morning I was awakened and found him standing beside my bed.</p>

<p>I got up and dressed, had a cup of coffee and some biscuits,
and leaving my bag behind, I went out with him into the deserted
streets. His car was waiting and we drove through the city to a
large building, which I recognized, passed under a vaulted
archway, and the car stopped in a courtyard.</p>

<p>There was a solemn hush on the world. We heard nothing but the
sound of birds singing. The old trees were dressed in the vivid
green of spring and in my heart was a greater solemnity than I
had ever felt.</p>

<p>Major Haynes looked at his watch and led me to a large bare
room. There were eight soldiers there, standing in a line, their
rifles at the rest. At the other end of the room was a chair. We
took our place behind the soldiers, and a little to the side, and
presently we heard steps, and two soldiers entered and between
them dressed in his shirt and trousers was Captain Baron von
Hatzfeld, his face grey, his eyes downcast. They sat him on the
chair and strapped his hands, and the eight rifles came up
together as if by machinery. I shut my eyes and closed my
ears.</p>

<p>Five seconds later I was in the open air again. I had seen the
figure in the chair limp and bloody and I wanted to see no
more.</p>

<p>The Major drove me back to the hotel and, standing on the
pavement, he shook hands with me.</p>

<p>"War," said he sadly, "is a pitiful business, Heine. Do you
think you will catch your train?"</p>

<p>"Major Haynes," I said, "if you will be kind enough to drive
me to the station now I shall be glad to wait on the platform
until it comes in."</p>
