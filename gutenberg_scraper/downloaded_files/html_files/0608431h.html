<h2><a id="ch1" name="ch1">CHAPTER I. THE LOST ONES</a> </h2>

<p class="first">DIKAR was on his knees, his head bowed against
the side of his cot, his hands palm to palm. The fragrance of the
dried grass with which his mattress was stuffed was in his
nostrils, the rabbit fur of his blanket soft and warm against his
forehead. Behind him there were two long rows of cots, eleven in
each, separated by a wide space. At every cot knelt one of the
Bunch, but the only sound was a low drone.</p>

<p>Dikar's own murmur was a part of that drone. "Now I lay me
down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. And should I die
before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take." Dikar used, as
all of them did, the prayer they had learned before the terror
had come. They had never been taught another.</p>

<p>Dikar stayed on his knees as behind him there was a rustle of
lifting bodies, a chatter of voices. One cried out, loud above
the others, "Hey, fellers!" Jimlane it was. "Who took my bow and
arrows an' didn't bring 'em back?" His changing voice, deep at
first, broke into a high squeal. "If I ketch the guy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They're out by the Fire Stone, foolish." That was Tomball. "I
seen you leave 'em there yourself. You'll be leavin' your head
somewhere one these days, an' forget where. You're sure the prize
dumby of the Bunch."</p>

<p>The other Boys laughed, tauntingly. Dikar heard them, and he
didn't quite hear them.</p>

<p>He was watching for a soft hand to stroke his hair, for sweet,
low tones to say, "The good Lord bless you, my son, and give you
pleasant dreams." He knew they would not come. Hand and voice
were vanished in the mists of Long-Ago, curtained from Dikar by
the dark Time of Fear before which, as he very dimly recalled,
everything had been different from what it was now. But always,
when he had said his "now-I-lay-me," he waited for them...</p>

<p>"Quit callin' me a dumby," Jimlane squealed. "You gotta quit
it."</p>

<p>"Who's gonna make me, dumby? You?"</p>

<p>Dikar rose to his feet, sighing, the burden of his leadership
once more heavy upon him.</p>

<p>From the blaze on the Fire Stone, a wavering light came in
through the unglazed, oblong openings in the wall of the long
narrow Boys' House. It bathed with red the stalwart, naked
bodies; nut-brown skin under which flat muscles moved
smoothly.</p>

<p>Tomball was out in the space between the cots, his bulging
arms hanging loose at his sides, his adolescent, chunky jaw
black-stubbled, his eyes, too closely set, glittering between
slitted lids.</p>

<p>Jimlane faced him and was little more than half his size.
Puny, his hairless countenance rashed with small pimples, the
kid's upper lip trembled but he stood his ground in mid-aisle as
the other advanced, slow and threatening.</p>

<p>"Yes, me," Jimlane answered him bravely. "I ain't scared uh
you, you big bully."</p>

<p>"You ain't, huh," Tomball grunted, closing the distance
between them as Dikar got into motion. "Then I'll teach you to
be."</p>

<p>Tomball had hold of Jimlane's wrist and was twisting it, his
shadowed lip curling. The smaller lad's face went white with
pain. His free hand twisted, batted at his tormentor's hairy
belly. Tomball grinned and kept on twisting. His victim bent
almost double, agonized, but still there was no whimper from the
youngster...</p>

<p>Dikar's fingers closed on Tomball's arm and dug into the hard
muscle. "No fair," Dikar said. "Break!"</p>

<p>Tomball loosed Jimlane, jerked free of Dikar's hold and swung
around. "Says who?" he growled, a redness in his black, small
eyes that was not put there by the light. He was a quarter-head
taller than Dikar and broader across the shaggy chest, and his
thighs were twice the span of Dikar's. "Oh, it's you!"</p>

<p>"It's me," Dikar said quietly. "And I'm orderin' you to quit
pickin' on Jimlane an' on the other little fellows who don't take
your guff." Dikar was lean-flanked and lithe-limbed, his hair and
his silken beard yellow as the other's was black, his eyes a
deep, shining blue.</p>

<p>"There will be no bullyin' here, so long as I'm Boss of the
Bunch."</p>

<p>Their code, like their talk, had been preserved unchanged from
their young childhood, back before the Days of Fear. Isolated,
they had no adult models to copy as they grew to young
manhood.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Tomball said through lips thin and straight beneath
their sparse covering of sprouting hairs, and somehow Dikar knew
what he was going to say next. It had been coming for a long time
and now it was here and Dikar was not altogether sorry.</p>

<p>Tomball said it: "As long as you're Boss." Two gray spots
pitted the skin at the corners of his flat nose. "Maybe. But it's
time you made room for someone else, Dikar. For me."</p>

<p>By Tomball's increasing unwillingness to obey orders, by his
sulking and his endless whisperings with those of the Boys who
had to be watched lest they shirk their share of work, Dikar had
known the challenge was coming.</p>

<p>He had thought out his answer and was ready with it. "All
right," he said, low voiced and very calm. "I'll call a Full
Council tomorrow, of the Boys an' the Girls. I'll tell 'em why I
think I should keep on being Boss an' you'll tell 'em why you
think I should not, an' then the Bunch will decide."</p>

<p>A murmur ran around the ring of Boys that had close-packed
about Dikar and Tomball.</p>

<p>"No!" Tomball refused. "It wasn't the Bunch decided you should
be Boss in the first place. It was the Old Ones." He paused, and
a meaningful grin widened his mouth. "Or so <i>you</i> say."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Dikar smiled, surprised he could smile. "Maybe,
Tomball, you'd like to ask the Old Ones if they picked me to be
Boss when they brought us here and left us. Maybe you'd like to
climb down the Drop an' ask 'em whether you or I should be Boss
from now on."</p>

<p>The Boys gasped in the ring around them, and Dikar's own skin
crawled at the back of his neck.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">DOWN, down as far as the Mountain on which the
Bunch lived was high, fell the great Drop that fully circled its
base. Straight up and down was the Drop's riven rock, and so
barren of foothold that no living thing could hope to scale
it.</p>

<p>Below, for a space twice as wide across as the tallest of the
trees in the forest that robed the Mountain, were tumbled stones
as big as the Boy's House and bigger. White and angry waters
fumed beneath the stones, and beneath stones and waters were the
Old Ones.</p>

<p>Dikar himself had seen these things, from the topmost branch
of a certain tree that gave a view of them, but not even Dikar
had ever gone out from the concealing curtain of the forest to
the brink of the Drop, for of all the Must-Nots the Old Ones had
left behind, this was the most fearful; <i>"You must not go out
of the woods. You must not go near the edge of the Drop."</i></p>

<p>Thinking of all this as he stared into the red hate in
Tomball's eyes, Dikar asked, "Do you dare, Tomball, climb down
the Drop an' talk to the Old Ones?"</p>

<p>"Smart," Tomball sneered. "You think you're smart, don't you?
You want me to go down there an' that way be rid of me. Well, it
don't work, see? I'm just as smart as you are."</p>

<p>Dikar spread his hands. "You will not let the Bunch decide
between us, an' you will not ask the Old Ones. How, then, do you
want this thing settled?"</p>

<p>"How? How have you yourself ordered scraps between the Boys
settled? Dikar! I dare you to fight out with me, fists, or sticks
or knives even, who's gonna be Boss of the Bunch&mdash;you or
me."</p>

<p>"No fair," Jimlane cried out at that. "I say it's no fair.
Tomball's bigger than Dikar an' heavier."</p>

<p>"No fair," Steveland yelped. Billthomas yelled, "We cry the
dare no fair." But others were shouting, "Fight!" Fredalton and
Halross and rabbit-faced Carlberger. "They gotta fight it out.
It's Dikar's own Rule an' he's gotta stick by it."</p>

<p>Most of the Boys shouted, "Fight!"</p>

<p><i>"Shut up!"</i> Dikar bellowed. "Shut up, all of you," and
at once the yelling stopped. But the ring had shrunk till he
could feel their breaths on his back and heard little whimpers in
the Boys' throats and read their eyes, shining in the changing
light of the Fire. "You dare me fight to decide who'll be Boss,"
Dikar said to Tomball, taking up the ritual he himself had set.
"Do you cry a fight between us two fair?"</p>

<p>A cord in Tomball's short neck twitched. "I cry us equal-
matched." (By the Rule, Dikar had a right to appeal to the Bunch
from Tomball's lying response.) "If you refuse my dare, Dikar, I
will cry you yellow, an' claim the right about which we scrap."
Reading the eyes in the ring, Dikar saw that if he appealed and
the Bunch said he and Tomball were not equal matched, he might
remain Boss in name, but Boss in truth he would be no longer.
"That is the Rule you yourself have made." Tomball abandoned the
ritual. "And you gotta stick by it."</p>

<p>Dikar's lips still smiled. "That is the rule I have made,
Tomball. But this over which we scrap is no bird brought down by
an unmarked arrow nor question of whose turn it is to bring water
from the spring. Who shall be Boss affects not only you an' me,
but the whole Bunch. Is it right that it be decided in the way
such small scraps are decided?" Dikar pretended to ask that of
Tomball, but his eyes asked the question of all the eyes in the
crowded circle, and the eyes had already answered him when
Tomball spoke again.</p>

<p>"It is right," Tomball voiced the verdict of the eyes. "It is
the only way that is right. You gotta fight me or crawl." There
was triumph in his voice, and triumph in his swagger. Tomball had
weight on his side, and reach and strength, and he knew he was
already as good as Boss.</p>

<p>Dikar knew it too, and his heart was heavy, but he smiled
still. "All right," he said. "We fight, Tomball. With bare
fists."</p>

<p>The Boys hurrahed, the sound like the bay of the dogpack when
they've brought down their prey under the trees. Even Steveland
and Billthomas hurrahed, and though Jimlane was silent his pale
eyes danced with the dancing red light of the Fire.</p>

<p>Dikar listened, thinking what Tomball would do as Boss of the
Bunch; whether he would let his pals shirk work, whether he would
see that the corn patches were weeded, and the water tank
cleaned, and the roofs of the Boys' House and the Girls' House
kept patched against the rains and the snows and the cold.</p>

<p>It was worry about these things and others like them that
weighted Dikar's heart. He knew how painfully he had learned, in
the long years since the Bunch had come to the Mountain, all the
many little irksome tasks that must be done for the good of the
Bunch; and he remembered that Tomball had always scoffed at
them.</p>

<p>For himself Dikar would be happy to be no longer Boss. It
meant being lonely&mdash;for the Boss must have no pal, lest he
be accused of favoring his friend over any other. It meant
carrying a heavy freight of care through the day, and lying
sleepless through the night, and never knowing rest. It meant
assigning the hunters to the chase, whose joys he never knew; to
judging the games and never playing them; to punish when Rules
were broken but never breaking Rules just for the fun of it and
finding the punishment worth it.</p>

<p>"What are we waiting for?" Tomball's growl broke into Dikar's
thoughts. "Come on outside an' let's go."</p>

<p>"No," Dikar said. "We fight tomorrow, before the whole Bunch.
Tonight, now, we sleep. Already it is Bed-Time, an' long
past."</p>

<p>"I want to fight now," Tomball insisted, standing his ground.
"I don't want to wait till tomorrow."</p>

<p>The smile faded from Dikar's lips, and he felt tiny muscles
knot along the ridge of his jaw, beneath his yellow beard. "Bed-
Time is not my Rule, but a Rule of the Old Ones. Perhaps, when
you are Boss, Tomball, you will let the Bunch break it, but I am
still Boss, an' I do not. To bed, Tomball. To bed, all of you.
Right away!"</p>

<p>Dikar's eyes locked with Tomball's, and blue eyes and black
held for a long minute and there was no sound in the Boys' House,
and no movement at all. Then the black eyes fell, and Tomball
muttered, "It's the Old Ones I obey, Dikar, not you," and the
ring broke up into Boys hurrying to their cots.</p>

<p>Dikar stood spread-legged, the firelight playing on his tall,
well-knit form, his chest moving quietly with his slow breathing,
the taut hollow of his belly heaving, his eyes somber as he
watched the Boys obey him&mdash;perhaps for the last time.</p>

<p>He didn't feel Jimlane's fingers squeeze his. He didn't hear
Jimlane's whisper, "I hope you win tomorrow, Dikar. Gee, how I
hope you win."</p>

<p>Dikar stood there while the curtains woven from slender withes
were dropped over the window-openings, shutting out the red light
of the Fire that the Girls tended tonight.</p>

<p>He stood there, unmoving, till the excited whisperings along
the walls of the Boys' House had faded, and the scrape of the fur
blankets along skin had ended, and there were no more creakings.
Then he turned and padded to his own cot, and knelt beside
it.</p>

<p>Dikar's lips moved, but the words came. He was sending them
out through the wall, past the leaping flames on the great, flat
Fire Stone, past the Girls' House into the night-darkened
woods.</p>

<p>He was speaking to a Presence there, a Someone he had never
seen and never heard, but had always known to be there, because
He showed His work in the carpet of the leaves underfoot, in the
tall and stately trees, in the wind that rustled through the
woods' green roof and the sunlight that shimmered through it.</p>

<p>"I don't care what happens to me tomorrow, Sir," Dikar told
Him. "I don't care how much Tomball hurts me, or what he does to
me if he wins. It's the Bunch I ask you to take care of. Please,
Sir. If Tomball is too strong for me, tomorrow, an' he licks me,
please make it all right for him to be Boss. Please make him
smart enough to be a good Boss. Please make him be a better Boss
for the Bunch than me. They're good kids, Sir, the Boys an' the
Girls, an' mostly they obey the Rules the Old Ones left, an' You
ought to take care of them. You will take care of them, Sir,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Dikar's lips stopped moving, but he stayed on his knees a
little while longer, his head bent as if he were listening.</p>

<p>He heard nothing but the soft breathing sounds, and the wind's
treetop whisper, and the insect chorus of the night.</p>

<p>When at last he stirred and climbed into his cot and drew his
fur blanket up over him he was comforted.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">CHAPTER II. THE NIGHTMARE THAT WAS
TRUE</a> </h2>

<p class="first">SLEEP'S deep emptiness claimed Dikar swiftly and
wholly, as always it claims one whose weariness is clean and
physical.</p>

<p>A voice came into the nothingness, the voice for which Dikar
waited each Bed-Time after he'd said his Now-I-lay-me.</p>

<p>... Mom's voice it was that came through the open door of the
dark room where Dick Carr had awakened. Something in Mom's voice
made Dick afraid: tears, and a trying hard to hide the tears, and
a smile that he somehow knew hurt Mom more than the tears.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself," Mom was saying, "and come back
soon."</p>

<p>Who was going away? There was only Mom and Dick in the flat,
and Henry who was twelve, four years older than Dick, and who
took up more than his half of their bed. Dick pushed out to wake
Henry, and his hand found only bunched sheets.</p>

<p><i>Henry wasn't there!</i> </p>

<p>The next minute Dick heard Henry out in the hall. "Sure, I'll
come back soon. Don't you worry. This thing will be over in a
jiffy, you'll see. We're just being called out
because&mdash;because the last big drive is on, an' they need us
in the rear lines so's all the real soldiers can be free to do
the fightin'. There ain't nothin' to worry about, Mom. They can't
lick us. Maybe they've licked the rest uh the world but they
can't lick the good old U.S.A. We've won every war we were ever
in an' we'll win this one&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look Mom, I got to run. The radio said for my unit to be at
the Eighth Street Armory at eleven o'clock, an' it's four of,
now. Goo'bye, Mom."</p>

<p>There was a kiss, and the flat-door slamming shut, and then
there wasn't any sound coming in through the door at all and the
flat seemed awful empty.</p>

<p>In through the window rang the clatter of feet running in the
street. Dick heard it every night, listening to the big boys who
didn't have to go to bed early and could play in the street after
supper. But Dick knew they weren't playing now, because they all
ran the one way and after a little while he didn't hear them any
more.</p>

<p>Then Dick lay listening to the thunder that had been in the
sky so long he usually didn't hear it. The thunder seemed a
little louder tonight, and a little nearer, and more scary. The
glass in the window kept rattling and that made Dick look at the
window and at the square gold-starred flag that hung in the
window.</p>

<p>The star was for Pop. It was to show everybody how proud we
were that Pop was a hero. Only Dick didn't quite understand why
we should be proud when every window in the block had a flag with
a gold star, a lot of them even with two or three gold stars.</p>

<p>What was there to be proud about in your Pop being a hero when
all the other kids' fathers were heroes too, and their big
brothers, and a lot of their sisters too, being Red Cross nurses
and working in ammunishun plants that was blown up and all?</p>

<p>Dick wished Pop would stop being a hero and come home.</p>

<p>Mom and Henry said Pop wasn't ever going to come home, but
Dick didn't believe that. Dick didn't believe Pop would go away
from them forever and ever.</p>

<p>Now Henry was gone away too. But he was coming back soon. He
had told Mom he was, hadn't he? He wouldn't lie to Mom, would
he?</p>

<p>Dick heard the sound of feet again, coming down the street.
The feet weren't running now. They were marching. Dick knew what
feet sounded like when they were marching. He'd heard them before
Pop went away, when you could hardly hear them for the crowds
shouting and the bands braying soldier-music.</p>

<p>He'd heard the feet marching when Pop went away; there were no
bands then, and no hurrahs, and there were hardly anybody in the
street, only in the windows a lot of women, waving handkerchiefs,
and then holding them up to their faces.</p>

<p>Yes, Dick had heard a lot of marching feet, but they had never
sounded quite like these. The sound of them feet wasn't nearly as
loud as the others.</p>

<p>Dick pushed back the covers and got to the window. The tops of
the street lights were painted black, and the bottoms were blue;
so that the gutter was like blue water, deep and awful, and
across the street was only a black and dreadful wall.</p>

<p>Down the street came the marchers.</p>

<p>They were boys like Henry, some of them bigger and some
smaller, but none of them very much bigger or very much smaller.
Each had a gun slanted across his shoulder. Not one was in
uniform. They were dressed in their everyday clothes, caps and
jackets and pants. Some of the boys wore longies, most wore
knickers or shorts, and a lot were barelegged down to the socks
folded over the tops of their shoes. They were like a bunch of
boys marching out of school on a fire-drill.</p>

<p>They were not playing soldiers. They <i>were</i> soldiers,
real soldiers. The way they marched showed that, straight-backed,
not talking or laughing. Their chins were lifted. Their eyes
looked far ahead, to the end of the street and the end of the
city and farther still, to the dark night out of which came the
sound of thunder that never stopped.</p>

<p>Four abreast they marched, four and four and four, as far as
Dick Carr could see. And alongside each tenth four marched a man
in uniform; a man with one empty sleeve pinned to the breast of
his coat: a man whose leg swung stiff so that Dick knew it was
not a leg at all: a man whose face was broken so it was ugly and
terrible as a Hallowe'en mask.</p>

<p>For a long time the boys and the broken men marched by, to
where the thunder rolled and the black sky flickered with a
lightning whose flashes Dick Carr could not see...</p>

<p>(And Dikar's dream faded into sleep's nothingness.)</p>

<p>... And into sleep's nothingness came a crash of thunder,
shaking the ground. It shook Mom's arms that were tight around
Dick Carr, and her body against which Dick's face was pressed.
Out of the corner of his eye Dick could see the pin on Mom's
black breast. The pin was oblong, and it had a blue border, and
on the white inside the border there were two gold stars. There
were two on the flag in the window now.</p>

<p>Dick was scared, but he wasn't bawling. He hadn't bawled when
the siren waked him up, screaming in through the window, nor when
Mom and he had jumped out of bed, all dressed like the radio said
they should be. He hadn't bawled when, the siren screaming like a
great devil in the black sky, they ran in the dark street, and
then stopped running because all the women and kids were carrying
them along in a rush faster than Dick could run.</p>

<p>No, Dick hadn't bawled even when he and Mom had fallen down
the station steps and the old man had dragged them through the
big, stiff curtains into the station.</p>

<p>The station was crowded with women and kids, and it was like
an ogre's cave. A couple of electric lights made light enough to
see them by, but not enough to keep back the shadows that reached
out of the enormous black holes at each end of the station, like
black arms pawing out to drag the women and the kids into a night
that would never end.</p>

<p>The faces he saw were a queer white, and the eyes were too
big; and they were sort of hunched, as if they were waiting for
something terrible to pounce on them out of the dark.</p>

<p>It came!</p>

<p>Thunder! Thunder louder than before, thunder so loud that when
it stopped Dick couldn't hear himself say, "Don't be scared, Mom.
I'll take care of you." But Mom must have heard him, because she
squeezed him tighter to her and kissed him on top of his head.
Then Dick could hear again. He could hear a woman say, "That must
have been one them half-ton bombs. They tell me they can go right
down through a ten-story building, and they don't blow up till
they hit the cellar, and after they blow up there ain't nothin'
left of the building or anyone was in it. Nothin' at all."</p>

<p>The old man, who stood by the brown curtain that hung over
where the station steps came in, laughed. His laugh was like the
cackle of the hens Dick used to hear when pop used to drive him
and Henry and Mom out into the country.</p>

<p>"Yeah," the old man cackled, his eyes kind of wild. "That's
right. Ef'n one o' them things hits overhead here they won't even
be little pieces of us left ter pick up."</p>

<p>He had on a uniform, but it wasn't like Pop's uniform. It was
very faded but you could see it had once been blue. It was ragged
and much too big.</p>

<p>There was thunder again, not so loud. "Well," said a woman
sitting with a suckling baby in her heavy arms. "I wish one would
hit right over us. That would be God's mercy."</p>

<p>"There ain't no God," someone said. "God is dead." Then
whoever it was laughed, and Dick's insides cringed from the
laughter. It was a woman in the middle of the platform, and she
was standing as still as a rock&mdash;her mouth didn't move, and
the eyes behind the hair that was down all over her face saw
nothing at all. "The End of the World is come and it is too late
to repent. We are doomed, doomed&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thunder again shattering the laughter, but far away now. The
woman who sat next to Mom, with a little girl on her lap and
another, brown-haired and brown eyed and pretty, on the floor
alongside of her whispered: "Poor thing, I hear tell she escaped
from Philadelphia after it was surrendered. She got through the
lines somehow. Did you hear how they went through all the houses
that was left and dragged out&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Hush," Mom begged. "Hush. The children&mdash;"</p>

<p>The little girl's mother laughed quietly. "The children will
know all about it soon. Yours too, girls or boys, it don't make
no difference to those fiends."</p>

<p>"Not mine," Mom said, very low, and she moved a little to show
the other woman what was in her hand. It was a carving knife from
their kitchen&mdash;</p>

<p><i>"Attention!"</i> A loud voice shouted out of the place
where you used to get your change before the subways stopped
running. <i>"Attention, all shelters!"</i> Dick looked and he saw
there was a radio behind the little hole where your money used to
be pushed out. <i>"The raid is over! The raid is
over&mdash;"</i></p>

<p>"It's over," the old man cackled. "And I'm still alive.
Eighty-three years old and not dead yet. I allus said I was born
ter be hanged."</p>

<p><i>"&mdash;where you are. Remain where you are. Gas-tests are
being made. Remain where you are until gas-tests determine that
it is safe to leave. Stand by."</i> </p>

<p>"The Government should of gave us all gas masks," grumbled a
fat lady whom Dick knew. "Like they did in England." She was Tom
Ball's mother and Tom was behind her, hiding his face in her
skirts.</p>

<p>"Much good that did England," the woman with the baby said.
"Much good anything did England&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Attention!"</i> the radio shouted. <i>"Attention all
shelters. Important. An important announcement is about to be
made. Stand by."</i></p>

<p>"Mom," Dick asked. "What is an important annou&mdash;what the
radio said?"</p>

<p>"News, son. Big news."</p>

<p>"Good news, Mom?"</p>

<p>"Maybe. Maybe we've won the battle. Maybe we're driving
Them&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Attention! Attention, all shelters. The next voice you
hear will be that of General Edward Albright, provost-marshal-
general for this area."</i> </p>

<p>"That's Ed Albright," the old man cackled. "I remember when he
was a buck private alone o' me, the both of us down with
dysentery at Key West. In the Spanish War that was,
an&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush. Hush, you old fool."</p>

<p>The voice Dick heard now, coming into a quiet so deep he could
hear Mom's heart beating in his ear, was thin and tired, awful
tired. <i>"Our lines are crumbling. Enemy infantry has already
penetrated to the outskirts of the city, south and east. The
boys, the young women, who have fought so heroically, are still
fighting, but there is no longer any hope. Word has come that the
columns that were marching to our aid have been completely wiped
out by a phalanx of enemy planes."</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">CHAPTER III. AFTER ARMAGEDDON</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE voice stopped, and there wasn't any sound at
all. <i>"We are beaten,"</i> the voice began again. <i>"But we
shall not surrender. We shall not give over the mothers and the
children of this city to the horror that has overtaken the other
municipalities that have surrendered.</i></p>

<p><i>"My people, when our lines finally break, when the enemy
hordes swarm in, I shall press a button on the desk before me to
set off mines that have been laid underneath the streets. Every
soul in the city will perish in that cataclysm; I, and you, and
with us some thousands of those who have made this world of ours
a hell."</i> </p>

<p><i>"Good!"</i> yelled the woman with the babe at her breast.
"Good!"</p>

<p>Mom's arms were tight around Dick, and she was crying, but her
eyes were shining. "We're going to see Henry soon, son, and your
father," she whispered. "Isn't that wonderful?"</p>

<p>And then everyone was quiet again, and the tired voice was
still talking.</p>

<p><i>"To die like that will be, I know, no sacrifice to you who
have laid fathers and husbands, sons and daughters, on the altar
of your country. But there is one more sacrifice I must ask of
you, for your country.</i> </p>

<p><i>"Somehow, in the maneuvering of the past few hours, a gap
has opened in the enemy lines, to the north. It is already being
closed, but the terrain is such that a small and determined force
may be able to keep it open long enough for a few to escape.</i>
</p>

<p><i>"No troops can be moved from their present positions. We
have some arms, some ammunition, available, but no one to use
them. No one&mdash;except you women who hear me. You
mothers."</i> </p>

<p>"That's funny," Mrs. Ball sniffed. "We can escape through a
hole if we get ourselves killed keepin' the hole open. The man
must be crazy."</p>

<p><i>"If you mothers can keep that gap open long enough, we may
be able to take your children out through it, the tots who are
all you have left.</i> </p>

<p><i>"We may&mdash;the possibility is infinitesimal&mdash;be
able to get them away to the hills north of the city. The chances
are that they will die on the way. Even if they do not, it is
possible that they will be hunted down and exterminated, that
Nature, though less cruel than these hordes that have come out of
the East and across the continent from the West and up from the
South, will finish the work of our foes.</i> </p>

<p>"But there is a million-to-one chance that the children will
come through, and it rests with you to choose whether we shall
give them that chance.</p>

<p><i>"I know that it is a bitter choice to make. I know,
mothers, that you would rather that your little daughter, your
little son, when I press this button on my desk, go with you into
the Outer Darkness where there is peace at last.</i> </p>

<p><i>"I know how dreadful it would be for you to die not knowing
what fate awaits your children, and I should not ask you to make
the choice save for this one thing.</i> </p>

<p><i>"This is the dusk of our day, the dusk of democracy, of
liberty, of all that has been the America we lived for, and die
for. If there is to be any hope of a tomorrow, it must rest in
them, in your sons and daughters.</i> </p>

<p><i>"If they perish, America shall have perished. If through
your sacrifice they survive, then, in some tomorrow we cannot
foresee, America will live again and democracy, liberty, freedom
shall reconquer the green and pleasant fields that tonight lie
devastated.</i> </p>

<p><i>"If you choose to give America this faint hope, if you
decide to make this sacrifice, leave your children in charge of
the warden of the shelter where you are, and come at once to
headquarters to receive your weapons and your orders.</i> </p>

<p><i>"We have no way of telling what your decision is until and
unless enough of you come here to make the attempt we contemplate
feasible. We wait for you. Will you come? Mothers, the choice is
yours."</i> </p>

<p>The voice stopped, and for a long time nobody moved, nobody
said a thing. Then, all of a sudden, all the women were standing
up. All the women were kissing their kids, and then they were
going toward the curtain that hung over the bottom of the steps
from the station.</p>

<p>They were pushing aside the brown curtain. They were going up
the steps.</p>

<p>They were going fast, fast, and their faces were shining as
Dick once had seen a bride's face shine as she walked, all in
white, up the aisle.</p>

<p>They were all gone, and in the station there were only the
kids, and the old, old man in the uniform of faded blue that was
too big for him.</p>

<p>It seemed darker here in the ogre's cave. The dark reached out
from the great black holes at the ends of the platform. A small,
cold hand took hold of Dick's hand. "I'm frightened," the little
brown-haired girl whimpered.</p>

<p>"Aw," Dick said, squeezing her hand. "There ain't nothin' to
be frightened about. I'll take care of you."</p>

<p>"Will you," she asked in a very little voice. "Do you
promise?"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart," Dick said, "I'll take care of you, always
and always," and somehow he wasn't quite so frightened any more.
"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Mary Lee. What's yours?"</p>

<p>"Dick Carr."</p>

<p>"Dikar," she murmured, and moved close to Dick, and her head
dropped sleepily on his shoulder.</p>

<p>He liked the way she said it: "Dikar," so he didn't bother to
tell her it was two names. He said "Marilee" in his head, making
one name out of her two, and he liked the sound of that...</p>

<p>And a shadow moved across Dick Carr... A shadow moved across
Dikar, and he stirred and came fully awake out of his dream, and
it seemed to him that someone had passed him, moving silently in
the night.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">CHAPTER IV. WE MEET IN THE NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">DIKAR lay in his cot, alert. The sloughing of
the wind came to him, and the shrilling of the insects of the
night and the breathing of the sleeping Boys. There was no sound
at all out of tune with the harmony of the dark forest.</p>

<p>Yet Dikar was troubled with an uneasy sense of something
wrong.</p>

<p>He tried to quiet himself, tried to find sleep again, sleep
and the dream out of which he had wakened. Dikar was desperate to
find his dream again, for he knew it was one he had dreamed many
times. But always before it had slipped from him in the instant
of wakening and tonight it was still as vivid in his mind as
yesterday.</p>

<p>The small boy of the dream, Dick Carr, was himself in the
Long-Ago that had been only a mist of gray half-memories as
shapeless as the dawn-haze that drifts in the waking forest. The
dream had told Dikar something of himself and something of that
Long-Ago, and if he could find it again it would tell him
more.</p>

<p>But Dikar could not find sleep again, nor the dream, because
his eagerness barred the way, and his sense of something wrong
with the night. So he sighed and rose from his cot, making no
sound.</p>

<p>He groped for his apron of woven leaves and tied it about his
waist, and stole to the curtain of twined withes that closed the
door, moving it a little to peer out.</p>

<p>The leafy boughs of a great oak made a roof that joined the
roofs of the Boys' House and the Girls' House, at the end where
they came nearest the woods. Beneath it the Fire was burning low
on its Stone, and a little distance away from its heat Dikar saw
the two Girls whose task it was tonight to tend the Fire.</p>

<p>The two Girls drowsed, arms about each other's waists. They
had undone their braids, and the hair that cloaked one was black
as the night, and the hair that cloaked the other was brown and
shining. The black hair swallowed the light, but tiny red glints
from the Fire danced merrily on the wavy fall of the brown.</p>

<p>The Girls wore short skirts of plaited grasses, and circlets
of woven leaves covered their deepening breasts; but through
their cloaks of long hair a shoulder peeped shyly, and a rounded
knee, and curve of a thigh.</p>

<p>Now as long as he could recall Dikar had seen the brown bodies
of the Girls as they busied themselves with their tasks or tried
to outdo the Boys in the Games, and so it was strange that
tonight these small glimpses should set a pulse throbbing in his
temples, and stir his breast with a not unpleasant pain.</p>

<p>It was to the Girl whose hair was brown that his eyes clung,
to her knee and the soft swell of her throat, and the pale oval
of her face.</p>

<p>As he looked out at her, he seemed to feel a small hand in
his, to hear a very little voice asking, "Will you take care of
me? Promise?" For this was Marilee, the little Girl of his dream.
Dikar had forgotten his promise, "I'll take care of you always
and always," but now he remembered it.</p>

<p>Remembering, he wanted to hold out his arms to Marilee, wanted
to call her to him. He almost did, and for fear that he might,
looking at her, not longer be able to hold her name in his
throat, he tore his eyes from her and turned them to the Fire.
Little flames, blue and yellow and red, licked along the sides of
a single log that lay across a great heap of orange glowing
embers. That log will not last much longer, Dikar though. I
should wake the Girls and tell them to put more on.</p>

<p>Then he thought, no. Let them sleep. I'll do it myself, and
with the thought his look went to the pile of logs at the base of
the oak.</p>

<p>... To the place where the pile ought to be! There was only
one split log there.</p>

<p>Queer, Dikar thought. I sent up enough for the night from
where we were cutting them in the woods yesterday&mdash;A hand
slid past the trunk of the oak, out of the blackness behind! The
hand took hold of the one log that was left of the pile and drew
it back into the blackness.</p>

<p>A muscle twitched in Dikar's cheek, under his beard.</p>

<p>"Oh," Bessalton exclaimed, the black-haired Girl. "Marilee!
We've been sleepin' an' the Fire's almost out. Quick."</p>

<p>They were running to the Fire, and past it to the oak, and
they were looking, dismayed at the base of the oak. "There isn't
any," Marilee said, her small face puckered in puzzlement. "You
must have put on the last."</p>

<p>"I did no such thing," Bessalton denied. "It was you. You were
the last one to put wood on. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Marilee said slowly. "Yes, I was the last. But there
was more here then. I'm sure there was."</p>

<p>"Looks like it," the black-haired Girl came back, "Don't it?
If I did something like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh what's the use of scrapping about it? We've got to get
more up from the place where the Boys were cutting, before the
Fire burns out."</p>

<p>"We?"</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Bessalton. I know where they were," Marilee said,
and before Dikar could move or cry out, she had gone past the oak
and the night had swallowed her. The night out of which a hand
had slid to draw away the logs from the base of the oak!</p>

<p>Dikar sprang to his cot, snatched up his bow and quiver of
arrows, was back to the door and out through it. Bessalton stared
at the Fire; she neither saw nor heard Dikar flitting by. Then
the damp, fragrant dark of the woods was about him, and the cool
softness of its carpet of leaves was under his noiseless feet,
and he was a shadow slipping through the forest.</p>

<p>All the Bunch was taught to move in the woods with the silence
of its creatures, but Dikar's ears, trained to keenness, caught
the barely audible sound of Marilee's progress ahead of him, the
flick of underbrush against her legs.</p>

<p>He did not call to warn her, because he needed to know who had
lured her into the forest, and why. This was a thing that never
before had been done by one of the Bunch and Dikar must find out
why it was being done.</p>

<p>Moonlight filtered through the foliage overhead and flecked
the night with silver. A small beast scuttered away from beneath
Dikar's feet. Marilee was well away from the Houses now. She was
almost to the place where the Boys had been cutting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh!" he heard her exclaim, and then there was another voice
ahead there. "Hello, Marilee." Tomball's voice. "I've been
waitin' for you."</p>

<p>Dikar froze, as motionless as the tree trunks about him.</p>

<p>"You've been waitin'&mdash;" Marilee was puzzled. "Why? Why
should you be here, waitin' for me?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see you alone."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but why do you want to see me alone?"</p>

<p>"Marilee." Tomball's voice was curiously thick. "Do you like
me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I like you. I like all the Boys."</p>

<p>"Not that way. Do you like me&mdash;like this?" Dikar heard
the sound of flesh, and he sprang into the little clearing ahead,
and Tomball's hands had hold of Marilee's arms, and he was
pulling her to him.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Dikar said, low-voiced, and somehow there was an arrow
hooked in the string of his bow, and the string was tight, and
the arrow was pointed at Tomball's back. The bow was long almost
as Dikar was tall, and the arrow sharp-pointed with stone.
Loosed, it could go clear through a deer&mdash;or a Boy. "Let go
of her."</p>

<p>Tomball turned on Dikar. Crouched knee-deep in fern there was
something about him more animal than Boy. The curling thickness
of his lips; the feral look of his black eyes, and the way his
neck was tense and corded.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;" Tomball grunted. "You again!"</p>

<p>"Me," Dikar said, heavy-tongued with anger. "The Boss.
Tomball, you have left your cot before day. You have laid hands
on a Girl. For breakin' these Must-Nots you are subject to seven
days in the punishment cave, with only water an' dried corn to
eat. What's your excuse?"</p>

<p>Tomball licked his lips, and straightened. "Nothin'," he said.
"Because you won't give me the punishment."</p>

<p>"Won't I? An' why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm not here, that's why. Because I'm in my cot,
asleep. Halross will say so at the Council, an' Carlberger."</p>

<p>"They will lie?" Dikar's brow wrinkled. He could not
understand. "They will lie, at a Council?"</p>

<p>"Sure, they will. What are you goin to do about it?"</p>

<p>"But Marilee here will say different, an' I."</p>

<p>"Course you will," Tomball grinned. "Why shouldn't you, the
Boss of the Bunch an' the Boss of the Girls? Why shouldn't you
say that I left my cot, an' that I laid hands on her, when seven
days in the punishment cave on water an' dried corn will leave me
so weak you'll be sure to lick me, an' stay Boss? Will the Bunch
believe you, Dikar, when I remind 'em of that, or will they
believe me an' Halross an' Carlberger?"</p>

<p>Dikar felt sick. That any should lie at a Council, that any
should talk as he was hearing Tomball talk, was a new and
dreadful thing. "Tomball," he cried. "You're foolin'. You
wouldn't really say those things."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I?" Tomball grinned, licking his lips. "Just try me.
You're licked, Dikar, an' you know it."</p>

<p>Dikar knew it, and he knew that a terrible thing had come
among them, and he could not think how to fight it. He was
licked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dikar!" Marilee's fingers touched his arm. "Dikar. Hold him
here with your arrow while I run an' call the Bunch. When they
see Tomball here in the woods, he an' his pals cannot say that he
is in his cot, asleep." She started away.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Tomball's command halted Marilee. "You can call the
Bunch, Marilee," he said. "But when they get here I'll tell 'em
that Dikar drew his arrow on me an' forced me to come here. An'
Halross will say that, wakin' from sleep in his cot next mine, he
saw this, an' that Dikar said he would kill him if he did not
keep quiet."</p>

<p>Marilee and Dikar stared at Tomball.</p>

<p>"You can't win," Tomball sneered. "I'm too smart for you, see.
An' tomorrow you'll find out I'm too strong for you, Dikar. An'
here's somethin' else for you to remember, Marilee. When I'm
Boss, you better like me the way I want you to like me!"</p>

<p>He laughed, then, and turning his back on Dikar's arrow, and
swaggered away; they heard his laugh coming out of the dark
woods.</p>

<p>"What did he mean?" Marilee whispered, coming close to Dikar.
"He said, 'When I'm Boss.' What did he mean, Dikar?"</p>

<p>Dikar wanted to put his arms around her.</p>

<p>"He meant that we're gunna fight who should be Boss, Marilee.
In the mornin, right after Brekfes, you will call a Full Council
of the Bunch, an' Tomball an' I will fight who shall be
Boss."</p>

<p>Marilee's eyes were upturned to his eyes, her lips were moist
and red. "You must win, Dikar," she whispered. "You heard what he
said. You <i>must</i> win."</p>

<p>The wanting to take her in his arms, the wanting to hold her
close to him, was a great ache in Dikar's arms and in his breast,
and a weakness in his legs.</p>

<p>"I heard him, Marilee," he said, deep-throated. "I will
win."</p>

<p>And then Dikar turned and ran off through the woods, but he
looked back over his shoulder at Marilee once and saw the way she
stood looking after him, mantled in her brown hair, and he saw
the look in her face.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">CHAPTER V. THE OLD ONES</a> </h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Dikar got back to the Boys' House and
slipped inside, all was dark there, and quiet, and Tomball was in
his cot. Dikar put down his bow and arrow, and took off his
apron. He lay down again, and pulled up the blanket of rabbit's
fur.</p>

<p>He lay staring up at the black roof of the house, trembling a
little. It seemed to him that he saw Tomball's face there, black-
stubbled and small-eyed and sneering. And then it was Marilee's
face he saw, the red lips moist, the brown eyes holding his,
telling something her lips could not. And looking into Marilee's
eyes, Dikar's eyes closed and the nothingness of sleep received
him... And out of sleep's nothingness formed a sky that flared
with blue light, and with red, and was streaked with bright
yellow that shimmered and faded; and the sky was filled with
rolling, endless thunder. Against that terrible sky loomed
monstrous black bulks, huge and ominous, hills that overhung a
road and a big truck in which Dick Carr was riding.</p>

<p>In the truck kids were jammed so tight they could not lie
down, and just could move a very little. Dick was in a corner so
that his back was jammed against the iron sides of the truck, and
Marilee was jammed against his side, and her head was on Dick's
shoulder, and she slept.</p>

<p>Most of the kids were asleep, in spite of the terrible lights
in the sky and the awful thunder. But the old man who was driving
the truck wasn't asleep, nor the old woman who sat next to him.
Ahead of them on the road were a lot of trucks, and behind them
were a lot more trucks, but Dick could tell this only by the
noise they made, because none of the trucks had any lights.</p>

<p>Dick knew some of the trucks were loaded high with boxes and
boxes of things, but most of them were jammed tight with kids
like this one.</p>

<p>"Tom," Dick heard the old woman ask. "Do you think we'll get
through?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Helen," the old man answered. "Only God knows.
So you had better pray to God to take us through."</p>

<p>"I can't, Tom. I can't pray any more. I'm all prayed out. God
cannot hear our prayers. He has forgotten us, Tom. He has turned
His face from us."</p>

<p>"Pray, Helen. Not for you or for me, but for the children in
our charge. Pray to God's Son. It was God's Son who once said,
'Suffer ye the little children to come unto Me.'"</p>

<p>"All right, Tom. I'll try."</p>

<p>They didn't say anything more. The truck bounced along, and
the red and blue lights flared in the sky, and yellow streaked
it, and thunder rolled.</p>

<p>Once the road got steep, climbing up into the sky to what
looked like the Jumping-Off Place, and up there against the sky
Dick saw things that stuck up out of the top of the black hill.
They were just a bunch of broken poles, black against the blazing
sky, but Dick knew that once they had been trees. And to one side
there was a chimney sticking up, and Dick knew that was all that
was left of a house that the trees used to shade.</p>

<p>Dick started to get sleepy. His eyes closed. The old woman
woke him up, yelling something.</p>

<p>"Tom!" she yelled. "Tom! Turn into this side road. Quick!"</p>

<p>Dick's head banged against the truck side, and the kids fell
against him, and Marilee woke up, screaming, "Dikar! Dikar!" Dick
grabbed hold of her, telling her it was all right, and then the
truck wasn't going any longer, and Dick could bear the other
trucks going past, somewhere behind.</p>

<p>"You caught me off guard, Helen, and I did it," the old man
said. "But why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Tom," she answered, talking slow. "I saw the
side road ahead and something told me we must turn off into it.
It was like a voice in my ear. No. It was more like a voice in my
brain."</p>

<p>"You're all worked up, Helen. You're excited." Tom's back
moved, and there was a noise of grinding metal. "Watch out
behind. I'm backing up to the highway. As soon as you see a clear
space you tell me, so that I can back out and get into line
again. If we lose the others we won't know where to&mdash;" And
then there was a white light in the sky a light bright as the sun
floating down out of the sky.</p>

<p>And there was a new sound in the sky, like a bee, like a giant
bee, and it became a roar. An enormous black shape came down
under the light, and there was a rattling noise, like a lot of
Boys were running sticks along a lot of picket fences, but
louder, and there were screams and crashes and the rattling noise
kept on.</p>

<p>The rattling noise cut off, and the roar faded and became a
bee-buzz again and the bee-buzz died away in the sky. There were
no more crashes, and no more screams. There was only the rolling
thunder overhead, that never stopped.</p>

<p>Old Tom got down from his seat, and went away into the dark.
The old woman sat very still, and all the kids sat very still,
and nobody moved. After awhile the old man was back, and he was
climbing up again to the truck driver's seat.</p>

<p>"Well?" Helen asked, so low Dick could hardly hear her.</p>

<p>"None," Tom said. "Not one of them all. We're the only ones
left. If we hadn't turned in here&mdash;" He didn't finish.</p>

<p>"I guess," Helen said. "I guess God is still listening, up
there above the sound of the guns." And then she said, "Where do
we go from here?"</p>

<p>"There's a smashed signpost back there, where this road turns
off. One of the boards on it reads, 'To Johnson's Quarry.' Do you
remember, Helen, my heading a committee once that tried to stop
the Johnson Granite Company from cutting down a Mountain? They
were defacing the landscape, you recall, and we wanted to
preserve the beauties of Nature for posterity."</p>

<p>He laughed. It wasn't pretty, that laugh. "We failed. Recently
I heard that they had blasted away almost the entire base of the
Mountain, leaving only a narrow ramp by which their trucks could
reach their camp at the top. There are probably quarters for the
laborers up there, perhaps some supplies. The Mountain, as I
remember, is thickly wooded and there's a possibility we may be
safely enough concealed there, at least for a time."</p>

<p>"If only we can get through to it."</p>

<p>"We can try. This is a State Park we are in. There are woods
almost all the way, and nothing to attract enemy patrols." The
truck started running again.</p>

<p>(Dikar's dream blurred.)</p>

<p>The thunder faded out of it, and the dark, and there was
sunlight, with green trees, and a wide cleared space with two
long houses each side of it, with cots and a wall-less house at
one end in which there were big stoves, and a lot of tables.
There were a bunch of little kids and there were the two Old
Ones.</p>

<p>The Old Ones made the kids work. Helen made the Girls make
beds and cook and things like that. Tom made the Boys go down the
road up which the truck came that first night and hammer deep
holes into the hill of rock on top of which the road climbed up
to where the trees were. When Tom thought the holes were deep
enough he would put fat white sticks into them that he got out of
a big red box they had found where the road started to climb up,
and little, silvery things on top of the sticks.</p>

<p>When it would begin to get dark, they would all eat, and then
the Old Ones would make the Bunch all sit around and they would
tell them things.</p>

<p>They called this a Council. At the first Council the two Old
Ones told the Bunch a lot of things they should do, and they
should not do, and these were the Rules. The Old Ones said
Marilee should be Boss of the Girls, and they said Dick should be
Boss of the Boys, and of the whole Bunch.</p>

<p>Every morning one of the Boys would climb up high in a tree
and watch all day if anybody would come out of the woods on the
other side of the fields down there, where Tom and the Boys were
working.</p>

<p>The Boys took turns doing this. One day (and this is where
Dikar's dream got clear again) Dikar was sitting on top of the
tree. The Boys had got through making the holes yesterday, and
they weren't down there any more. They were in the front of the
house where they slept, and Tom was teaching them how to make
bows and arrows. The Girls were in front of their house and Helen
was teaching them how to make baskets out of twigs from the
bushes in the woods.</p>

<p>Dick was looking at the black smoke, way far off in the sky,
that had been there all the time since they came here. He thought
about a new Rule the Old Ones had made at Council last night, a
Rule they said was most important of all. "You must not go out of
the woods," the Rule said. "You must not go near the edge of the
Drop."</p>

<p>Wondering why the Old Ones had made that rule, Dick looked
down at the edge of the Drop, and at the place where the road
climbed up and over it. His eyes went along the road, and across
the fields, and he saw someone come out of the woods across
there.</p>

<p>The someone looked very little, way down there, but Dick could
see he had a kind of dark-green uniform on, and that his face was
yellow. Then another one and another one came out of the woods.
These were in green too, but their faces were black, and they had
guns. All of a sudden there were a lot of them.</p>

<p>Dick yelled down, "Coo-eee! Coo-eee!" and when Tom looked up
at him Dick pointed down at the men in the green uniforms and
held up his spread fingers and wagged them to show Tom how many
there were.</p>

<p>Tom started running into the woods, and then he came out on
the other side of them, where the road came up over the edge of
the Drop, and he was running down the road. And then Helen was
running after him, and Tom saw her. Tom yelled something and she
stopped, but she didn't go back.</p>

<p>Tom had a little hammer in his hand.</p>

<p>Dick heard a crack, like a twig breaking, and he looked down
and down, and across the fields, and he saw that the men in green
had their guns up to their shoulders, and he saw a little white
puff of smoke floating away from one of them. Then he saw white
puffs come out of all the guns.</p>

<p>Dick looked back at Tom, and just then Tom fell down, but he
didn't stop. He was crawling down the road, and Helen was running
down it now, running fast.</p>

<p>A lot of cracks came to Dick's ear, and across the fields the
air was full of the little white puffs. On the road Helen caught
up with Tom and was lifting him up, and then he was leaning on
her and the two of them were running down again.</p>

<p>The men in green started running across the fields, stopping
every couple of steps to shoot at Tom and Helen, but the Old Ones
got down to the bottom of the road, and around inside of where
the road started to climb up out of the fields, and the men in
green stopped shooting because they couldn't see them any more,
but they kept on running.</p>

<p>Dick could see the Old Ones. They were standing near the rocky
wall of the hill the road climbed on, Helen's arm around Tom, and
the first of the men in green came around to where he could see
them.</p>

<p>Tom lifted his little hammer and hit the rock with it. A cloud
of dust hid the Old Ones, and Dick heard a boom, and then there
was another boom, and another, and one so loud it filled the
whole world. The hill the road climbed on leaned away from the
rest of the Mountain, and it started to fall.</p>

<p>It fell slowly at first, and then faster and faster, down on
where the Old Ones were, and on the men in green, and the noise
was so loud Dick couldn't hear any noise at all, and the air was
so full of dust it was like night.</p>

<p>The whole Mountain shook, and the tree shook so hard Dick had
to grab hold of it to keep from being shaken and his hands
started to slip, and...</p>

<p>(Dikar woke.)</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">CHAPTER VI. SHADOWS AT SUNRISE</a> </h2>

<p class="first">DIKAR lay in his cot, his eyes still closed,
remembering his dream, fitting the things it had shown him into
the things he knew, seeing how it explained a lot that had always
puzzled him.</p>

<p>It explained the Rule that no fire must ever be made except
with wood so dry that it would burn without smoke, and the Rule
that no fire must ever burn at night except the big Fire on the
Fire Stone, and why the big Fire was set not in the center of the
space between the Boys' House and the Girls' House but at one
end, where it was hidden from the sky by the spreading leafy top
of the giant oak. It explained the Rule that when there was a
noise in the sky like a bee buzzing, everyone must run into the
Houses or into the woods and stay very still until the sound was
gone.</p>

<p>But most of all it explained the Must-Not about going out of
the edge of the woods, about going to the edge of the Drop.</p>

<p><i>They</i> were down there, in the woods across the space of
tumbled stones at the bottom of the Drop, beneath which the Old
Ones lay. Dressed in green, with black faces and yellow faces.
They were in the woods, and in all the far country Dikar could
see when he climbed the tall tree, if They saw any of the Bunch
come to the top of the Drop and so found out that the Bunch lived
on the Mountain, They would come and do to the Bunch what, in his
dream, They did to all the kids on that terrible night in the
Long-Ago.</p>

<p>Dikar knew now how the Bunch had come to the Mountain, and he
knew now that the Bunch could not always stay here on the
Mountain. Some day he must lead the Bunch down the Drop, down
into the far, green country that stretched away, fold on fold, to
meet the sky. And now Dikar was glad that he was Boss of the
Bunch, so that he would lead them&mdash;</p>

<p>But after this morning he might be no longer Boss!</p>

<p>Dikar remembered that he must fight Tomball over who should be
Boss, and he remembered what Tomball had done and what Tomball
had said last night, between dream and dream. Dikar threw off his
blanket and leaped from his cot, and all down the length of the
Boys' House bronzed forms leaped from the cots, and curtains were
raised, and the sun streamed in.</p>

<p>But the Boys did not laugh in the sun, and they did not laugh
and play jokes on one another as they ran, behind Dikar, out
through the door in the wall away from the Girls' House, and
through the woods to where a stream leaped from a ledge overhead
into a pool below, and ran brawling out of the pool as if eager
to reach the edge of the Drop and leap again over it, and smash
itself on the tumbled rocks below.</p>

<p>The Boys did not shout as they sprang after Dikar into the icy
pool, and none swam near him, and none joined him when he climbed
on the stone where the stream came down, and stood there, letting
the stream batter him.</p>

<p>But when tingling with the cold of the waters, with the lash
of the spray, Dikar ran back through the woods to the Boys'
House, little Jimlane came up to run beside him.</p>

<p>"Dikar," Jimlane panted. "Oh, Dikar. They're sayin Tomball is
sure to beat you. They're sayin he's too strong for you. An' a
lot are sayin it's a good thing, that they're tired of you being
Boss, and that when Tomball is Boss we won't have to work all the
time, an' we'll have more time for Games, an' for&mdash;an' for
playin' with the Girls."</p>

<p>Dikar ran along, and from his lithe limbs the drops spattered,
shining in the sun, and under his yellow beard his jaw muscles
hardened, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>"An' Tomball says he's goin' to fix me when he's Boss,"
Jimlane whimpered. "An' I'm afraid, Dikar. I'm awful afraid."</p>

<p>Dikar looked down at the little fellow, and he saw the
frightened eyes in the pimply face, and the gray, quivering
lips.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, kid," he grunted. "Tomball won't win." But Dikar
wasn't sure.</p>

<p>Somehow Brekfes was over, and the Bunch was gathered in a
circle in the space between the Houses, the Girls on one side and
the Boys on the other, and Marilee sat in the Boss's Seat beneath
the giant oak, her brown hair still unbraided, mantling her, her
small face color-drained. Dikar stood before her, and Tomball
stood by his side, and Marilee was speaking.</p>

<p>"You fight," Marilee's clear, sweet voice said, "over who
shall be Boss of the Bunch, an' the Bunch will obey as Boss the
one who wins. You fight with bare fists, an' you fight fair. You
begin when I say the word, you end when one is beaten." Her brown
eyes were on Dikar's, and her eyes told Dikar that he must not be
beaten. "That is all."</p>

<p>Dikar turned away and walked toward one end of the cleared
space about which the Bunch stood murmuring. The grass was cool
under his bare feet, and springy.</p>

<p>Marilee had ordered it carefully raked, so that there would be
no branches to trip the fighters, and no small stones to bruise
them if they fell. Many twigs and leaves and small stones had
been raked out of the grass, and so calm was Dikar that he even
noted how the stones had been put in a great circle to mark the
bounds of the space in which he must fight, and how just beyond
the circle the Boys and Girls stood tight-packed.</p>

<p>Dikar came to the end of the space, and turned, and across the
space he saw Tomball turning. Fredalton was whispering something
in Tomball's ear, and Tomball nodded, grinning with his thick
lips.</p>

<p>"Fight!" Marilee cried out.</p>

<p>Dikar started going back toward Tomball, and Tomball came to
meet him, half-crouched, his black-stubbled countenance scowling
fiercely, great pads of muscle across his shaggy chest, his hairy
belly indrawn.</p>

<p>Dikar moved lithely across the raked grass, his beard shining
yellow in the sunlight, his limbs dusted with yellow hair.</p>

<p>All at once Tomball was very close, and Tomball's fist struck
Dikar's cheek, and Dikar's cheek knotted with the pain of the
blow, and his head rocked.</p>

<p>But Dikar's arm jarred with the blow he had landed on
Tomball's chest, and then Dikar no longer felt any pain. He stood
breast to breast with his enemy, his fisted arms were clubs that
pounded the dark face and the hairy body he hated. There was a
salt taste in his mouth that was very pleasant, and there was joy
in the blows he gave, and joy even in the blows he received.</p>

<p>He made no effort to guard himself from Tomball's blows, nor
did Tomball try to guard himself from Dikar's. They fought like
the beasts fight, eager only to hurt, eager only to pound the
other to submission.</p>

<p>And over them washed the shouts and the screams of the
Bunch.</p>

<p>Into a red haze that was all that was left of his vision,
Dikar flung arms so heavy he barely could lift them. Somewhere in
the haze was a darker bulk that moved about, and it was at this
Dikar flung his arms. Sometimes Dikar found it, more often not,
and when he missed the weight of his arms pulled him off balance,
and he would start to fall, and somehow not fall.</p>

<p>Sometimes Dikar would be struck, out of the haze, and he would
sway on his legs that had no strength in them, and almost go
down; but he did not let himself because he must not, though he
no longer knew why.</p>

<p>And out of the haze came an endless thunder of shouting.</p>

<p>Dikar pawed once again at the vague bulk that was his enemy,
and missed, and swayed, and in that instant the bulk struck him,
and Dikar's legs folded, and he sank. His sight cleared, and
lurching at him came Tomball's red-bathed body, Tomball's
distorted face. Somehow Dikar threw a heavy arm at Tomball and
struck him, so that as Dikar settled to the ground Tomball
staggered back.</p>

<p>Tomball did not fall, but was steadying. Dikar, sprawled on
the grass, knew that when Tomball had steadied he would come in
again to finish Dikar, and Dikar did not care&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dikar!" he heard a high, clear voice above the endless roar.
"No!" <i>Marilee!</i> "No, Dikar. No!" And suddenly Dikar cared
desperately that Tomball was beating him, and his fallen body
trembled as he tried to get up, but he had no strength&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh up, Dikar," a voice squeaked, and Jimlane's pimpled face
swam over Dikar, close to Dikar's face, and Jimlane's hand was
tugging at Dikar's hand to pull him up. "You can lick him now,
Dikar." Dikar came up with the pull of Jimlane's hand, Jimlane's
fingers closing Dikar's hand into a fist. And Tomball, grinning
through the red that masked him, lurched in to beat Dikar down
again.</p>

<p>Dikar lifted a heavy arm and flung it at Tomball, and Dikar's
fist fell on Tomball's brow. Tomball crumpled and lay, a still
heap on the grass, with Dikar swaying above him, arms hanging by
his sides, in his ears a deafening roar.</p>

<p>And out of the roar came Marilee, her cheeks rosy, her eyes
alight. "Oh, Dikar."</p>

<p>That was all she said, but Dikar straightened, feeling the
strength flow back into him, hearing the hurrays of the Bunch
clear in his ears, knowing the hurrays were for him.</p>

<p>Marilee took hold of Dikar's wrist to lift his arm and cry him
the winner.</p>

<p>The color fled from her cheeks and from her lips, and the
light went from her eyes as they fell to Dikar's still-fisted
hand.</p>

<p>Dikar's eyes went down to where Marilee's eyes looked, and
they saw what Marilee's eyes saw. In his fist that had pounded
Tomball down was clenched a stone, and there was blood on the
stone, Tomball's blood.</p>

<p>Dikar knew now why Jimlane had closed that hand into a fist,
why Jimlane, tugging him up, had said, "You can lick him now."
Jimlane had&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dikar," Marilee sobbed. "Oh, Dikar," and then Marilee was
lifting Dikar's arm so that all might see what was in Dikar's
fist, and the hurrays stopped, and there was a throbbing
hush.</p>

<p>Marilee's voice was loud and clear in that terrible hush. "I
cry Dikar no fair. I cry Tomball the winner of the fight. I cry
Tomball Boss of the Bunch."</p>

<p>Marilee threw Dikar's arm from her, and it was as if she threw
Dikar from her, and she turned away. Dikar thought he heard
Marilee sob, but she walked away from him head high, back proud.
Dikar's mouth moved but no words came out of it, and he knew
there was no use of his saying that he had not known the stone
was in his fist.</p>

<p>A strange, low sound came from the throats of the Bunch, and
it grew louder. A stone struck Dikar on the shoulder, and
another, and Dikar saw that all the Bunch was bending to pick up
stones, lifting them to throw them at him.</p>

<p>"Run!" Jimlane screamed. "Run, Dikar," and Dikar turned and
ran, the stones falling about him; ran, staggering, straight at
the hating faces of the Bunch, and the Bunch opened a path for
him, and Dikar ran into the woods, the stones spattering about
him.</p>

<p>Dikar ran in the dim woods till he fell, and he crawled till
he could crawl no longer, and he lay still in the woods, and a
sick nothingness took him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">CHAPTER VII. THE FAR GREEN LAND</a> </h2>

<p class="first">DIKAR lived in the woods as the beasts live, and
as the beasts' hurts heal so did his. He set snares for the
rabbits and the birds that were so plentiful in the woods, and
cooked them over his little fires. He found sharp-edged stones,
and used them as knives to make a bow for himself, twisting and
drying the gut of the rabbit for string, and he made arrows,
feathering them, and a quiver out of the bark of a birch.</p>

<p>He hunted with his bow and arrows, and he lay long hours on
the mossy floor of a clearing near the top of the Mountain,
waiting the little creatures of the forest play, looking
sometimes into the great, beautiful eyes of the deer peering out
at him from the brush, watching the birds chirp on the tree
boughs above him.</p>

<p>It was spring and always the small woods creatures played two
by two, and the deer went two by two, and the birds; and seeing
this, Dikar would think of Marilee.</p>

<p>Yes, Dikar's hurts healed but the ache within him did not
heal.</p>

<p>Sometimes Dikar would climb to the topmost branch of a tall
tree that stood on the very top of the Mountain. He would stay
there till dark, gazing at the far green land that stretched,
fold on fold, away to where the sky came down to meet it. He
would think of what he had dreamed the last night he was Boss,
and of his thought that some day he would lead the Bunch down
into that pleasant land, and his heart would be heavy within
him.</p>

<p>Spring warmed into summer, and summer deepened.</p>

<p>Every night Dikar would slip through the woods till he came to
where the trees were black against the red glow of the Fire, and
he could crouch behind the trunk of some tree and look out into
the space between the Houses. He dared not do this till just
before Bed-Time, when he knew most of the Bunch were in the
Houses and there was little danger of one coming upon him.</p>

<p>Dikar would hear the drone of their Now-I-lay-mes, and he
would kneel and say his own with them. With his palms together
and his eyes closed, it was almost as if he knelt by his own cot
in the Boys' House, almost as if he were still one of the
Bunch.</p>

<p>After his Now-I-lay-me was said, Dikar would stay there,
listening to the talk of the Boys or the Girls whose turn it was
to tend the Fire.</p>

<p>What Dikar heard made his heart heavy. As he had feared,
Tomball was letting the Bunch break Rule after Rule, was favoring
his pals and laying double work on those he did not like, was
shirking many of the little things that Dikar knew were needed if
the Bunch was to be warm and comfortable and safe when the cold
came, and the snow.</p>

<p>One of the Rules Tomball allowed to be broken was the Rule
that none must leave his cot after Bed-Time. Dikar would see
Girls come out of the Girls' House and slip off into the woods,
and he would see Boys do the same. Often they had not yet come
back when Dikar tired of watching had gone back to the shelter he
had woven for himself out of twigs. One thing troubled Dikar
above all others. He never saw Marilee tending the Fire. That she
was never one of those who went into the woods after Bed-Time
pleased him, but it was strange that her turn never came to tend
the Fire.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ONE night Dikar heard the reason. He'd heard
that, the day he was stoned, Marilee had said that she no longer
would be Boss of the Girls, that she had made Bessalton Boss in
her place on the promise that she would free Marilee of the duty
of tending to the Fire, or of any other duty that would take her
away from the other Girls. And that this was because Tomball
wanted Marilee to go into the woods with him, and Marilee feared
him.</p>

<p>Dikar's throat grew thick when he heard this. Growling, he
rose from his haunches to stride out into the light of the Fire
and call out Tomball to fight him, not with fists, but with bows
and arrows, and knives, in a fight to the death. His rage
blinding him, Dikar was caught in a bush he did not see, and
before he could get free he heard something else from the tongue
of Jimlane, who was tending the Fire with Billthomas and had
spoken of Marilee and Tomball.</p>

<p>"If Dikar was Boss again, things would be different, but
there's no chance of that, because the minute he shows up the
Bunch will stone him again, the way Tomball has ordered, and he
would not get away again."</p>

<p>Dikar went cold, remembering the way the stones had spattered
about him, and was very still in the bush.</p>

<p>"The Bunch wouldn't stone Dikar," Billthomas said, very low
and looking about with frightened eyes, "if you spoke out.
Tomball's orders or no, they would not stone Dikar if they knew
that it wasn't Dikar's fault he fought no fair."</p>

<p>"I dare not tell them." Jimlane's eyes went big in his white
face. "You remember how I told you, an' how you said yourself the
Bunch would stone me if I told."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't rest, an' I went to Tomball an' told him,
an' Tomball beat me till I could hardly walk. That was the time I
said I fell into a hole in the woods, you remember. An' after
Tomball beat me, he told me that if I said a word to anyone else
he would kill me, an' he would kill anyone I told."</p>

<p>"He did!" Now there was fear in Billthomas's eyes, too, and in
his face. "You should not have told me, Jimlane&mdash;If Tomball
finds out I know&mdash;" His voice was still low, but there was a
scream in it.</p>

<p>"If only," Jimlane sobbed, "Dikar could some way come back and
protect me while I told the Bunch&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the use of all the ifs?" Billthomas broke in.
"Tomball's made sure Dikar would be killed before you had a
chance to say anythin'. The best thing we can do is forget about
Dikar, like everyone else has."</p>

<p>"Yes," Jimlane whispered. "I guess so. Dikar isn't one of the
Bunch any more an' he will never be again."</p>

<p>"Never again," Billthomas agreed.</p>

<p>Now indeed Dikar, rigid in the dark, knew that he was disowned
by his kind. He must live out his life alone, a wild beast in the
woods&mdash;</p>

<p>And then, perhaps from Some unseen Presence in the close-
crowding dark, perhaps from within Dikar, a thought came to him.
He was no longer one of the Bunch, and so he was not bound by the
Rules of the Bunch. He was not bound by the Must-Nots that the
Bunch must obey. There was something for him to do, and no Rule
to say that he must not.</p>

<p>He drifted off into the darkness, silent as a shadow. But
there was no sleep for Dikar that night.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ALL that night, and all the next day, Dikar was
busy, cutting down long vines from the trees, testing each one
for strength. He plaited the vines, never stopping, never
resting, till by nightfall he had made a rope long enough for his
need.</p>

<p>When dark came Dikar hung his quiver of arrows over one
shoulder, and he hung the great coil of green rope over the other
shoulder, and he followed the sound of a stream through the black
forest till he came to where the woods ended and there was a
little space between the edge of the woods and the edge of the
Drop, where the stream leaped out into the night.</p>

<p>Here Dikar paused, and laid the rope down, and passed its end
around the great trunk of a tree that grew beside the stream, and
fastened the rope with many knots, and pulled on it with all his
strength to make certain that the knots would hold.</p>

<p>Dikar bent then, and lifted the coil of rope that he had made
from the vines, and carried it to the edge of the Drop, and let
it fall into the dark.</p>

<p>At his feet the rope tautened, and quivered, and below him
there was the sound of its unwinding coil thumping against the
high, sheer rock of the Drop, and the sound of the stream's
waters, falling down and down into sightless blackness. And then
the rope at Dikar's feet was no longer quivering, so that he knew
the coil was all unwound.</p>

<p>Dikar bent again, and lifted the rope, and moved it over so
that it lay in the water where the stream leaped out over the
Drop, so that when the sun rose again, all the length of the rope
that hung down the Drop would be hidden behind the falling
waters.</p>

<p>Then, without pause, Dikar had hold of the rope with his
hands, and he was over the edge of the Drop, and the icy waters
were rushing about him, were battering him, were fighting to
break loose his hold and send him hurtling down into the dizzy
dark to smash on the rocks below.</p>

<p>Dikar could not see and he could not breathe, and his hands
were slipping on the wet rope. He caught a leg around the rope,
and slid. He could breathe again because he hung between the
rushing waters and the rocky face of the Drop.</p>

<p>Dikar went down and down, endlessly, down into the black and
dizzy darkness, down to where the great stones lay tumbled, and
the waters raged between them, and the Old Ones slept.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">THE sun was high in the sky, but Dikar was
concealed in the leafy shadow of a treetop where he lay
outstretched along a thick bough. He was peering at a sight that
made of his skin an icy, prickling sheath for his body.</p>

<p>The tree was at the other end of the woods through which Dikar
had loped after finally crossing the belt of immense stones that
lay about the Mountain where the Bunch lived. Some time in the
night, sounds ahead, and moving lights, had alarmed him, and he
had climbed the tree to wait for what the day would show him.</p>

<p>Dikar, as comfortable there as on his mossy bed in the
Mountain forest, had slept longer than he intended. Into his feet
had come the sound of marching feet, and he had thought himself
back in his dream of the night before his fight with Tomball. But
his eyes had opened and the marching feet had still sounded in
his ears, and then Dikar had seen those whose feet made the
sound.</p>

<p>The tree in which Dikar wakened was at the edge of the woods
and the edge of a great, flat field. Not far from the tree wires
stretched, one above the other, twice Dikar's height. Fastened to
thin poles, the wires ran away on either hand as far as Dikar
could see, and the wires were thick with long, sharp thorns that
would tear a Boy's flesh to bits.</p>

<p>Beyond this set of wires was another set just like them, as
high and as wickedly barbed, and between the two sets of wires
stood, far apart, figures out of Dikar's dream.</p>

<p>They were dressed in green like the men in the dream who had
run across the fields that now were covered with great stones,
shooting at the Old Ones. Like those, their faces and their hands
were black, and like those they carried the shiny sticks that
Dikar now remembered were called "guns".</p>

<p>But the sound of marching feet came from inside the second
fence. A great crowd of people were marching out of some long,
low houses that were very much like the Bunch's Houses. Just as
Dikar spied them, they stopped marching and stood in a long,
straight line in front of the houses.</p>

<p>They were pretty far away, but Dikar could see them, and he
could see that they were very thin, and they were dressed in
ragged clothes that hung loose on them. He could see that their
faces were white, and that their eyes were sunk deep in their
heads, and that they were all stooped over as if they were very
tired, although it was only early morning.</p>

<p>A voice yelled something, and the white people turned, so that
the lines faced Dikar. Dikar saw that the one who had yelled was
different. His face was yellow, and he was dressed in green, but
there was something different about his green clothes, and he had
no gun.</p>

<p>There were other men in green standing around in there. Some
of them were black-faced, and some yellow-faced, some had guns
and others didn't. One very big one only had green on below his
waist, above that he had nothing on. His body was as yellow as
his face, and his muscles were bigger than Dikar's muscles, or
even Tomball's. He was holding something in one hand. It was long
and thin and black. His other hand was against a thick post
beside which he stood.</p>

<p>The man in the different green clothes yelled something again,
and then Dikar saw two black-faced ones come out of a smaller
house to one side, and between them was a white one who was so
weak they had to almost carry him. They came to the thick post,
and they shoved the white man up against the post with his face
to it, and they tied his arms and his legs around it, and then
they tore off his clothes above the waist, and stepped away.</p>

<p>The yellow-faced man yelled a lot to the white people. Dikar
could hear him, but he couldn't make out what he was saying. When
he finished he made a sign with his hand to the big yellow
man.</p>

<p>That one lifted the long, thin thing he held, and it looked
like a snake. And he lifted it above his head and it straightened
out, and then it came down across the back of the white man who
was tied to the post. Dikar heard the crack it made, and he saw
the red mark across the white man's back.</p>

<p>And the yellow man lifted the thin, snakelike thing again, and
brought it down again, and there was another crack, and another
red mark across the white man's back.</p>

<p>Dikar was sick, seeing that. And then he wasn't sick. He was
mad. He wanted to yell out, "Stop!" but he remembered his dream
now, remembered what the guns could do, and he knew that if he
yelled the men between the wires would see him and shoot him
down.</p>

<p><i>Crack,</i> Dikar heard, and <i>crack</i> again, and now the
back of the man tied to the post was all red, all shining red.
But Dikar was on his feet, on the tree branch. He was pulling
taut the string of his bow, and an arrow was laid across it.</p>

<p>The big yellow lifted his arm again, but when it fell there
was no crack. The big yellow was falling, and the feathers of an
arrow were sticking out of his back. Just the feathers.</p>

<p>Dikar didn't see any more, because he was swinging through the
treetops, a brown and naked Boy flashing through the tops of the
trees, fleeing the death from the guns that he recalled were
swifter and farther reaching than any arrow.</p>

<p>Whether the men in green ever thought to look for him in the
treetops Dikar never knew.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">FAR away from the place of the thorny wires,
Dikar lay on his belly in the tall grass that covered a hill, and
he looked down through the grass at a place where two roads
crossed.</p>

<p>There stood a pole, high as a tall tree, but there was no bark
on it, no branches nor leaves, and because at its top five or six
cross-sticks were fastened, and a lot of wires ran from these
cross-pieces to other cross-sticks at the top of another pole far
away down one of the roads.</p>

<p>Dikar was looking at a rope that hung taut from one of the
cross-sticks at the top of the pole. Dikar was looking at that
which weighed down the rope and kept it taut.</p>

<p>The thing swung back and forth, back and forth, very slowly in
the wind, and rags fluttered about it in the wind, and the rags
were no grayer nor dirtier than the thing was. And Dikar saw that
the thing once had been a man.</p>

<p>... Dikar came to a place where there was a House all of rock,
and it was three or four times as high as the Boys' House, and
ten times as long. The window openings in the wall of this House
were very high and very wide.</p>

<p>Dikar saw a lot of people in there, and there were white men
and women. These were thin and gray and sunken-eyed as those in
the place with the wires, and they were pushing around things
piled high with heavy loads, and they were so weak they could
push the things only slowly. And there were men in green standing
around, and these had little guns hanging at their waists, and
they held black, snakelike things like the big yellow one
held.</p>

<p>And Dikar saw a white woman stumble and fall, and he saw one
of the men in green raise the thing he held and bring it down on
her, again and again till, all bloody, she pulled herself up on
the thing she had been pushing and started pushing it again.</p>

<p>And the other men in green laughed, but the white people just
kept on pushing, all stooped over and weak, their eyes like the
eyes of the woman in Dikar's dream who stood in the subway
station and said that God was dead.</p>

<p>Dikar went far and wide that day, a brown shadow flitting
through the fields and the woods, a silent shadow none saw. Dikar
saw many things that day, and the more he saw the heavier his
heart grew within him. For Dikar knew that the white-faced men
and women were his people and that this green land belonged to
them and to him, and that the black men and yellow men were They
whom the voice in his dream had said, "have come out of the East
to make this world a Hell."</p>

<p>Yes, Dikar saw the Hell they had made... The sky darkened and
the night crept out of the Woods, and Dikar lay belly down in
tall grass of a field near the woods, head buried in his curled
arm, thinking. Last night he had known that he would never return
to the Mountain where the Bunch lived, and now he knew that he
could not stay in this land that had seemed so pleasant when he
had gazed at it from his tall tree in the forest.</p>

<p>Neither there nor here was there place for Dikar. Nowhere was
there place for him&mdash;</p>

<p>Fingers clutched Dikar's arm, bruising fingers. Dikar rolled
over but the fingers held, and there was a growl of words Dikar
could not understand, and in the sunless dusk Dikar saw green-
clothed legs, and a green-clothed breast, and a black, fierce
face goggling at him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8" name="ch8">CHAPTER VIII. IN THE TOMORROW</a> </h2>

<p class="first">DIKAR kicked at the black man's legs, and he saw
the black man's hand dart to the little gun at his waist. Dikar
kicked again, wrenched loose, exploded from the ground.</p>

<p>Dikar's one hand caught the little gun, his other smashed into
the black, goggling face. Somehow the black man was on the ground
and Dikar was atop him, and Dikar was clutching the black throat
with one hand while the other was smashing the little gun down on
the black man's head, smashing and smashing and smashing.</p>

<p>When Dikar fled into the night-shrouded woods he left behind
him something that had legs and a body and arms, but nothing that
was anything like a head.</p>

<p>Deep in the woods, Dikar found a little cave. He crawled into
this and lay there a long time, shuddering. But after awhile he
stirred, and he became aware that he still held in his hands the
little gun, and he sat up, his eyes widening with a sudden
thought.</p>

<p>Dikar hid the little gun under a pile of rotting leaves, and
he went out of the cave and prowled about till he was certain
that no one was anywhere within sound of hearing. Then he went
back into the cave with certain things he had picked up and he
made a fire, and by the light of the fire Dikar studied the
little gun until he had made out how it worked.</p>

<p>Satisfied at last, Dikar put out his fire and buried it with
wet earth, and left the cave. That night Dikar traveled far and
fast, but careful to leave no tracks by which he might be
traced.</p>

<p>Dikar was going back to the Mountain, and he must not leave
any trail the men in green might follow.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">ONE more night Dikar stole down through the dark
forest to the Houses of the Bunch, but this night it was long
after Bed-Time that he did so. This night Dikar did not crouch
behind a tree, looking out at the Fire, but crept, noiselessly,
along the wall of the Boys' House that was away from the Fire
till, under a certain window opening, he came to a stop.</p>

<p>Dikar listened, trembling a bit, and all he could hear was the
whisper of wind in the trees, and the shrill of insects in the
night, and the soft breathing of the sleeping Boys. Dikar lifted,
slowly, slowly, till he stood upright. The ground here was banked
against the wall so that, standing, Dikar's belly was level with
the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>Slowly, he ran his hand over the sill, and touched the curtain
of woven withes; and moved it aside. And then he was peering
through, and a fleck of red light was dancing on a sleeping face,
and the face was rashed with pimples.</p>

<p>Dikar breathed again. He had remembered right. This was
Jimlane.</p>

<p>Dikar got his other hand through the window, and then it was
tight over Jimlane's mouth, and Jimlane's scared eyes were
staring up at Dikar.</p>

<p>"Listen," Dikar breathed. "Listen to me, Jimlane." Dikar spoke
so low that barely he could hear himself, but by the look in
Jimlane's eyes he knew that Jimlane heard him and understood.</p>

<p>After awhile Dikar stole away, and for the first time since
Tomball had challenged him, Dikar was smiling.</p>

<p>There was green all about Dikar, the dancing, leafy green of
the top of the giant oak in which he had spent the rest of that
night. He was still smiling when he awoke, but peering through
the leaves at the Bunch where they chattered, cleaning up after
Brekfes, there was a flutter of some small muscle in the tautness
of his belly.</p>

<p>Across the space between the House Dikar spied Marilee talking
with Bessalton. Dikar saw how thin Marilee had grown, and how wan
her little face, and how her fingers plucked endlessly at her
short skirt of plaited grasses, and Dikar's smile faded.</p>

<p>Tomball strode up to the two Girls, black-stubbled as ever.
His belly was overlaid with fat, but it was still shaggy with
hair, and Tomball's grin was still leering.</p>

<p>Tomball put a hand on Marilee's arm, and Marilee shrank away
from him. Under Dikar's yellow beard little muscles knotted to
ridge his jaw, and there was a growl in his throat.</p>

<p>Tomball laughed, and then from behind the Boys' House came the
loud words of a scrap. "He's mine!" Jimlane's voice piped, and "I
say he's mine," squealed the thin voice of Billthomas, and around
the corner of the Boys' House the two came, and between them was
a half-grown fawn, with a vine wound around its brown neck and
trailing, broken, from it.</p>

<p>Jimlane had hold of the fawn's head and Billthomas of its hind
legs, and each tugged as if to take it from the other.</p>

<p>"It was caught in my snare," Billthomas piped.</p>

<p>"You lie," Jimlane squealed.</p>

<p>And then Billthomas straightened and cried out. "It's you who
lie, Jimlane. I dare you to fight out with me, bare fists, whose
snare he was caught in, and whose he shall be."</p>

<p>Tomball's deep-chested laugh came to Dikar's ears, but
Jimlane's voice, breaking from squeal to bass and back again to
squeal, was answering Billthomas. "You dare me fight whose the
fawn shall be?" it said. "Do you cry a fight between us
fair?"</p>

<p>And Billthomas: "I cry us equal-matched," and all about were
cries of, "Fair. Fair. They're equal-matched!" and the Boys and
Girls of the Bunch were running from all over, and crying,
"Fight! Let them fight!"</p>

<p>And then the Bunch was crowded in a great circle, and the fawn
was tied by the vine about its neck to the Boss's Seat, and
Tomball, grinning, was seated in the Boss's Seat, just beneath
the oak, and Bessalton was seated beside him, mantled in her
black hair, and Jimlane and Billthomas stood before them while
Tomball spoke to them.</p>

<p>But Dikar's look was on Marilee where she stood in the crowd,
her two long brown braids coming down over her shoulders, her
deepening breasts beneath leafy circlets.</p>

<p>Dikar's eyes drank thirstily of Marilee till Tomball was
finished speaking and Jimlane and Billthomas were walking slowly,
each to their end of the cleared space where they were to fight.
Jimlane reached the end of the circle, turned&mdash;</p>

<p>The little gun jumped in Dikar's hand, and the fawn, just
beneath him dropped, wet-redness streaking the brown neck.</p>

<p>A Girl screamed, high and shrill, and then Dikar was shouting:
"Stay where you are or I'll kill each of you as I've killed the
fawn. I'll kill the first one that moves."</p>

<p>"Dikar!" Marilee cried, and then she was silent, and all were
silent and unmoving, the Boys and the Girls in their jammed
circle, Tomball in the Boss's Seat.</p>

<p>"Jimlane," Dikar shouted down into that hush, "tell the Bunch
how the stone came into my hand with which I struck Tomball when
we fought who should be Boss."</p>

<p>Jimlane, white of face and big of eye, but standing straight,
cried out. "I put the stone in Dikar's hand, when he fell at my
feet."</p>

<p>"Did I know you put the stone in my hand?" Dikar shouted from
the tree.</p>

<p>"You did not know, Dikar. You were blinded with your own
blood, an' numbed with Tomball's blows, an' you did not know
there was a stone in your hand."</p>

<p>A murmuring ran around the circle, and a growl, and Dikar saw
that the Bunch did not quite believe that he had not known he was
striking Tomball with a stone though they had agreed to fight
bare fist.</p>

<p>"Jimlane," Dikar shouted. "Have you ever told this thing to
anyone?"</p>

<p>"I told it to Tomball," Jimlane cried, "and Tomball beat me
for saying that you did not know you fought no fair, an' Tomball
said that if I spoke to anyone else he would kill me, an' kill
the one to whom I spoke of it."</p>

<p>"You lie!" Tomball shouted, starting from seat. "You lie,
dumby!" Jimlane screamed with terror of Tomball, but Dikar's
shout beat down Jimlane's scream.</p>

<p>"Back!" Dikar shouted. "Back to your seat, Tomball, or you
die." And Tomball went pasty white under his black stubble, and
he slumped down in his seat.</p>

<p>And Dikar leaped out from the oak bough on which he stood, and
came down, spring-legged, in the clear space around which the
Bunch was jammed, and held aloft the little gun.</p>

<p>"This is the thing that kills," he shouted. "Without it I
cannot kill," and then he flung the little gun from him, flung it
hard so that it went up on the roof of the Boys' House and stayed
there.</p>

<p>"Now I cannot kill," Dikar shouted. "No more than any of
you."</p>

<p>"Stone him," Tomball yelled. "Stone him, Bunch. He is none of
us and we will have none of him." And Dikar saw the Bunch stoop
to pluck up stones. Spraddle-legged, bronze-skinned in the sun,
he saw this, and his heart within him died, but he would not
move.</p>

<p>"No!" It was a high, wild cry in his ear, and it came from
Marilee, and Marilee's was beside Dikar. "I cry no fair. I cry
the Bunch no fair, all of you against this one."</p>

<p>"He fought no fair," Tomball shouted, "and so has no right to
call for fairness. Stand aside, Marilee, and let the Bunch stone
him."</p>

<p>"I will not stand aside," Marilee answered. "Be you Boss or
not, till you tell the Bunch why you said you would kill Jimlane
if he told his tale to anyone, an' would kill anyone he told the
tale to. If you still thought Dikar had fought no fair, why were
you afraid to let the Bunch hear Jimlane's tale and judge for
themselves?"</p>

<p>Now Tomball's little eyes seemed to have grown even smaller,
and his mouth was drawn very tight.</p>

<p>"She's right," someone yelled. "Why, Tomball, did you not let
us judge for ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Jimlane lies," Tomball answered. "He never told me this tale,
and I never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is you who lie," Dikar cut in. "I say you lie, Tomball. I
cry you a liar, Tomball, an' I dare you to fight me whether you
lie or not. I cry that I fought fair, an' I dare you to fight me
whether I fought fair or not. I dare you to fight me who shall be
Boss of the Bunch. I cry us equal-matched, an' if you refuse to
fight me I will cry you a liar and yellow an' not fit to be Boss
of the Bunch an' not fit to be one of the Bunch. Will you fight,
Tomball, bare fists?"</p>

<p>There was only one answer Tomball could make. "I fight you
bare fists, Dikar. I fight you here an' now."</p>

<p>And then they were fighting, were clubbing at each other with
fisted arms, lips drawn back from white teeth, eyes hating. But
Dikar was gaunt and hard-bitten, and toughened by the life he had
led since he'd been stoned from the Bunch, and Tomball was fat
and slow, and short-winded, and so the fight did not last long.
Dikar beat Tomball down, laid him rolling at his feet, and there
was scarcely a mark on Dikar when he stood above his beaten enemy
and heard the shouts of the Bunch.</p>

<p>"Hurray for Dikar. Hurray for the Boss. Hurray and hurray and
hurray."</p>

<p>Dikar scarcely heard the hurrays. He was peering about for
Marilee and he saw her, and he motioned commandingly for her to
come to him. She came to him, her white and slender body shining
in the sun, her eyes shining more brightly than the sun, and then
she was beside Dikar, and Dikar's arm was around her, and he was
holding her close to his side.</p>

<p>Under the thunder of the hurrays, Dikar spoke to Marilee.
"Marilee," he said. "In the time I have been alone in the woods I
have learned many things&mdash;an' one of the things I have
learned is that each creature has his mate, the birds an' the
small beasts of the woods, an' the deer. I learned that He who
made all things meant this to be so, an' meant that we too, each
of us, shall have his mate. Marilee, I want you for my mate." He
was looking down into her face, and now he waited, with a
tightness growing in him that was both keen happiness and
fear.</p>

<p>Marilee's red lips spoke. "Oh, Dikar. This that you have
learned only now, I have known always. Dikar, always I have
wanted you for my mate."</p>

<p>A great joy leaped within Dikar, and he raised his hand and
roared, "Shut up! Shut up, all of you." And the hurrays died
away, and the Bunch was hushed, and Dikar was talking into that
smiling hush.</p>

<p>"There are many things I have to say to you, an' many Rules I
shall have to change. All this will come later. Just now I have
something to say, but not to you, though I wish all the Bunch to
hear it, all the Bunch, an' Another."</p>

<p>Then, in that hush, Dikar turned to the giant oak, and to the
forest beyond the oak, and his voice was low, and slow, and
awed.</p>

<p>"You Whose voice is the whisper of the wind in the trees, an'
the ripple of the water in the streams an' the song of the
insects in the night! You, who watch over us by day, an' by
night! You to Whom we say our Now-I-lay-mes at Bed Time! Sir!
Look upon me and upon this Girl, an' hear me. In your sight an'
your hearin' I take this Girl to be my mate, an' none other than
this Girl, an' to You an' to her I promise that all my life I
will take care of her an' let no harm come near her. I promise
that all my life she shall be bone of my bone an' flesh of my
flesh, all my life an' all her life, an' always an' always."</p>

<p>"Hear me, Sir!" Marilee's clear, young voice rang out. "I
shall be this Boy's mate, an' none other's, an' he shall be bone
of my bone, an' flesh of my flesh, always an' always."</p>

<p>And it seemed to Dikar that a soft hand stroked his hair,
though it might have been the wind. How could it be the wind,
though, that said in his ear, in sweet, low tones, "The Lord
bless you, my son, an' the Lord bless my daughter."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Dikar had climbed to the topmost branch of the tallest tree in
the forest, and Marilee had climbed there with him. For a long
time, clasped in each other's arms, they had gazed out on the
green land that stretched, fold on fold, to the sky, while Dikar
told Marilee of his dream that was not a dream, and of the
terrible things he had seen down there.</p>

<p>"Some day, Marilee," Dikar ended. "I shall lead the Bunch down
there. I have to, because down there is the America of which the
man spoke, an' this is the Tomorrow he talked about, an' we are
the children of yesterday who will reconquer those green and
pleasant fields for democracy, and liberty, and freedom."</p>

<p>And all at once there was a light shining on the land down
there, a great and golden light that cast no shadows.</p>
