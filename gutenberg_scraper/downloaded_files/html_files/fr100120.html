<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<h3>IN WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THIS SINGULAR WORK,<br>
INFORMS THE READER HOW HE ACQUIRED THE<br>
CERTAINTY THAT THE OPERA GHOST REALLY EXISTED.</h3>

<p class="first">THE Opera ghost really existed. He was not, as
was long believed, a creature of the imagination of the artists,
the superstition of the managers, or a product of the absurd and
impressionable brains of the young ladies of the ballet, their
mothers, the box-keepers, the cloak-room attendants or the
concierge. Yes, he existed in flesh and blood, although he
assumed the complete appearance of a real phantom; that is to
say, of a spectral shade.</p>

<p>When I began to ransack the archives of the National Academy
of Music I was at once struck by the surprising coincidences
between the phenomena ascribed to the "ghost" and the most
extraordinary and fantastic tragedy that ever excited the Paris
upper classes; and I soon conceived the idea that this tragedy
might reasonably be explained by the phenomena in question. The
events do not date more than thirty years back; and it would not
be difficult to find at the present day, in the foyer of the
ballet, old men of the highest respectability, men upon whose
word one could absolutely rely, who would remember as though they
happened yesterday the mysterious and dramatic conditions that
attended the kidnapping of Christine Daaé, the disappearance of
the Vicomte de Chagny and the death of his elder brother, Count
Philippe, whose body was found on the bank of the lake that
exists in the lower cellars of the Opera on the Rue-Scribe side.
But none of those witnesses had until that day thought that there
was any reason for connecting the more or less legendary figure
of the Opera ghost with that terrible story.</p>

<p>The truth was slow to enter my mind, puzzled by an inquiry
that at every moment was complicated by events which, at first
sight, might be looked upon as superhuman; and more than once I
was within an ace of abandoning a task in which I was exhausting
myself in the hopeless pursuit of a vain image. At last, I
received the proof that my presentiments had not deceived me, and
I was rewarded for all my efforts on the day when I acquired the
certainty that the Opera ghost was more than a mere shade.</p>

<p>On that day, I had spent long hours over <i>The Memoirs of a
Manager</i>, the light and frivolous work of the too-skeptical
Moncharmin, who, during his term at the Opera, understood nothing
of the mysterious behavior of the ghost and who was making all
the fun of it that he could at the very moment when he became the
first victim of the curious financial operation that went on
inside the "magic envelope."</p>

<p>I had just left the library in despair, when I met the
delightful acting-manager of our National Academy, who stood
chatting on a landing with a lively and well-groomed little old
man, to whom he introduced me gaily. The acting-manager knew all
about my investigations and how eagerly and unsuccessfully I had
been trying to discover the whereabouts of the examining
magistrate in the famous Chagny case, M. Faure. Nobody knew what
had become of him, alive or dead; and here he was back from
Canada, where he had spent fifteen years, and the first thing he
had done, on his return to Paris, was to come to the secretarial
offices at the Opera and ask for a free seat. The little old man
was M. Faure himself.</p>

<p>We spent a good part of the evening together and he told me
the whole Chagny case as he had understood it at the time. He was
bound to conclude in favor of the madness of the viscount and the
accidental death of the elder brother, for lack of evidence to
the contrary; but he was nevertheless persuaded that a terrible
tragedy had taken place between the two brothers in connection
with Christine Daaé. He could not tell me what became of
Christine or the viscount. When I mentioned the ghost, he only
laughed. He, too, had been told of the curious manifestations
that seemed to point to the existence of an abnormal being,
residing in one of the most mysterious corners of the Opera, and
he knew the story of the envelope; but he had never seen anything
in it worthy of his attention as magistrate in charge of the
Chagny case, and it was as much as he had done to listen to the
evidence of a witness who appeared of his own accord and declared
that he had often met the ghost. This witness was none other than
the man whom all Paris called the "Persian" and who was
well-known to every subscriber to the Opera. The magistrate took
him for a visionary.</p>

<p>I was immensely interested by this story of the Persian. I
wanted, if there were still time, to find this valuable and
eccentric witness. My luck began to improve and I discovered him
in his little flat in the Rue de Rivoli, where he had lived ever
since and where he died five months after my visit. I was at
first inclined to be suspicious; but when the Persian had told
me, with child-like candor, all that he knew about the ghost and
had handed me the proofs of the ghost's existence&mdash;including
the strange correspondence of Christine Daaé&mdash;to do as I
pleased with, I was no longer able to doubt. No, the ghost was
not a myth!</p>

<p>I have, I know, been told that this correspondence may have
been forged from first to last by a man whose imagination had
certainly been fed on the most seductive tales; but fortunately I
discovered some of Christine's writing outside the famous bundle
of letters and, on a comparison between the two, all my doubts
were removed. I also went into the past history of the Persian
and found that he was an upright man, incapable of inventing a
story that might have defeated the ends of justice.</p>

<p>This, moreover, was the opinion of the more serious people
who, at one time or other, were mixed up in the Chagny case, who
were friends of the Chagny family, to whom I showed all my
documents and set forth all my inferences. In this connection, I
should like to print a few lines which I received from General
D&mdash;&mdash;.:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">
I can not urge you too strongly to publish the results of your
inquiry. I remember perfectly that, a few weeks before the
disappearance of that great singer, Christine Daaé, and the
tragedy which threw the whole of the Faubourg Saint-Germain into
mourning, there was a great deal of talk, in the foyer of the
ballet, on the subject of the "ghost;" and I believe that it only
ceased to be discussed in consequence of the later affair that
excited us all so greatly. But, if it be possible&mdash;as, after
hearing you, I believe&mdash;to explain the tragedy through the
ghost, then I beg you, sir, to talk to us about the ghost again.
Mysterious though the ghost may at first appear, he will always
be more easily explained than the dismal story in which
malevolent people have tried to picture two brothers killing each
other who had worshiped each other all their lives.</p>

<p class="letter">Believe me, etc.</p>

<br>

<p>Lastly, with my bundle of papers in hand, I once more went
over the ghost's vast domain, the huge building which he had made
his kingdom. All that my eyes saw, all that my mind perceived,
corroborated the Persian's documents precisely; and a wonderful
discovery crowned my labors in a very definite fashion. It will
be remembered that, later, when digging in the substructure of
the Opera, before burying the phonographic records of the
artist's voice, the workmen laid bare a corpse. Well, I was at
once able to prove that this corpse was that of the Opera ghost.
I made the acting-manager put this proof to the test with his own
hand; and it is now a matter of supreme indifference to me if the
papers pretend that the body was that of a victim of the
Commune.</p>

<p>The wretches who were massacred, under the Commune, in the
cellars of the Opera, were not buried on this side; I will tell
where their skeletons can be found in a spot not very far from
that immense crypt which was stocked during the siege with all
sorts of provisions. I came upon this track just when I was
looking for the remains of the Opera ghost, which I should never
have discovered but for the unheard-of chance described
above.</p>

<p>But we will return to the corpse and what ought to be done
with it. For the present, I must conclude this very necessary
introduction by thanking M. Mifroid (who was the commissary of
police called in for the first investigations after the
disappearance of Christine Daaé), M. Rémy, the late secretary, M.
Mercier, the late acting-manager, M. Gabriel, the late
chorus-master, and more particularly Mme. la Baronne de
Castelot-Barbezac, who was once the "little Meg" of the story
(and who is not ashamed of it), the most charming star of our
admirable <i>corps de ballet</i>, the eldest daughter of the
worthy Mme. Giry, now deceased, who had charge of the ghost's
private box. All these were of the greatest assistance to me;
and, thanks to them, I shall be able to reproduce those hours of
sheer love and terror, in their smallest details, before the
reader's eyes.</p>

<p>And I should be ungrateful indeed if I omitted, while standing
on the threshold of this dreadful and veracious story, to thank
the present management of the Opera, which has so kindly assisted
me in all my inquiries, and M. Messager in particular, together
with M. Gabion, the acting-manager, and that most amiable of men,
the architect intrusted with the preservation of the building,
who did not hesitate to lend me the works of Charles Gamier,
although he was almost sure that I would never return them to
him. Lastly, I must pay a public tribute to the generosity of my
friend and former collaborator, M.J. Le Croze, who allowed me to
dip into his splendid theatrical library and to borrow the rarest
editions of books by which he set great store.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>IS IT THE GHOST?</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was the evening on which MM. Debienne and Poligny, the
managers of the Opera, were giving a last gala performance to
mark their retirement. Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli,
one of the principal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young
ladies of the ballet, who had come up from the stage after
"dancing" <i>Polyeucte</i>. They rushed in amid great confusion,
some giving vent to forced and unnatural laughter, others to
cries of terror. Sorelli, who wished to be alone for a moment to
"run through" the speech which she was to make to the resigning
managers, looked around angrily at the mad and tumultuous crowd.
It was little Jammes the girl with the tip-tilted nose, the
forget-me-not eyes, the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white neck
and shoulders&mdash;who gave the explanation in a trembling
voice:</p>

<p>"It's the ghost!" And she locked the door.</p>

<p>Sorelli's dressing-room was fitted up with official,
commonplace elegance. A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and
a cupboard or two provided the necessary furniture. On the walls
hung a few engravings, relics of the mother, who had known the
glories of the old Opera in the Rue le Peletier; portraits of
Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini. But the room seemed a palace
to the brats of the <i>corps de ballet</i>, who were lodged in
common dressing-rooms where they spent their time singing,
quarreling, smacking the dressers and hair-dressers and buying
one another glasses of <i>cassis</i>, beer, or even <i>rhum</i>,
until the call-boy's bell rang.</p>

<p>Sorelli was very superstitious. She shuddered when she heard
little Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a "silly little
fool" and then, as she was the first to believe in ghosts in
general, and the Opera ghost in particular, at once asked for
details:</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"As plainly as I see you now!" said little Jammes, whose legs
were giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a
chair.</p>

<p>Thereupon little Giry&mdash;the girl with eyes black as sloes,
hair black as ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin
stretched over poor little bones&mdash;little Giry added:</p>

<p>"If that's the ghost, he's very ugly!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried the chorus of ballet-girls.</p>

<p>And they all began to talk together. The ghost had appeared to
them in the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had
suddenly stood before them in the passage, without their knowing
where he came from. He seemed to have come straight through the
wall.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said one of them, who had more or less kept her head.
"You see the ghost everywhere!" And it was true. For several
months, there had been nothing discussed at the Opera but this
ghost in dress-clothes who stalked about the building, from top
to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to whom nobody
dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one
knowing how or where. As became a real ghost, he made no noise in
walking. People began by laughing and making fun of this specter
dressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost
legend soon swelled to enormous proportions among the <i>corps de
ballet</i>. All the girls pretended to have met this supernatural
being more or less often. And those who laughed the loudest were
not the most at ease. When he did not show himself, he betrayed
his presence or his passing by accident, comic or serious, for
which the general superstition held him responsible. Had any one
met with a fall, or suffered a practical joke at the hands of one
of the other girls, or lost a powder-puff, it was at once the
fault of the ghost, of the Opera ghost.</p>

<p>After all, who had seen him? You meet so many men in
dress-clothes at the Opera who are not ghosts. But this
dress-suit had a peculiarity of its own. It covered a skeleton.
At least, so the ballet-girls said. And, of course, it had a
death's head.</p>

<p>Was all this serious? The truth is that the idea of the
skeleton came from the description of the ghost given by Joseph
Buquet, the chief scene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost.
He had run up against the ghost on the little staircase, by the
footlights, which leads to "the cellars." He had seen him for a
second&mdash;for the ghost had fled&mdash;and to any one who
cared to listen to him he said:</p>

<p>"He is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a
skeleton frame. His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the
fixed pupils. You just see two big black holes, as in a dead
man's skull. His skin, which is stretched across his bones like a
drumhead, is not white, but a nasty yellow. His nose is so little
worth talking about that you can't see it side-face; and <i>the
absence</i> of that nose is a horrible thing <i>to look at</i>.
All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks on his
forehead and behind his ears."</p>

<p>This chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man,
very slow at imagining things. His words were received with
interest and amazement; and soon there were other people to say
that they too had met a man in dress-clothes with a death's head
on his shoulders. Sensible men who had wind of the story began by
saying that Joseph Buquet had been the victim of a joke played by
one of his assistants. And then, one after the other, there came
a series of incidents so curious and so inexplicable that the
very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.</p>

<p>For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow! He fears nothing,
least of all fire! Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to
make a round of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had
ventured a little farther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the
stage, pale, scared, trembling, with his eyes starting out of his
head, and practically fainted in the arms of the proud mother of
little Jammes.[*] And why? Because he had seen coming toward him,
<i>at the level of his head, but without a body attached to it, a
head of fire!</i> And, as I said, a fireman is not afraid of
fire.</p>

<p>The fireman's name was Pampin.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I have the anecdote, which is quite
authentic, from M. Pedro Gailhard himself, the late manager of
the Opera.]</p>

<p><br>
The <i>corps de ballet</i> was flung into consternation. At
first sight, this fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph
Buquet's description of the ghost. But the young ladies soon
persuaded themselves that the ghost had several heads, which he
changed about as he pleased. And, of course, they at once
imagined that they were in the greatest danger. Once a fireman
did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front-row and back-row
girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made them
quicken their pace when passing some dark corner or ill-lighted
corridor. Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the
fireman, placed a horse-shoe on the table in front of the
stage-door-keeper's box, which every one who entered the Opera
otherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on
the first tread of the staircase. This horse-shoe was not
invented by me any more than any other part of this story, alas!
and may still be seen on the table in the passage out side the
stage-door-keeper's box, when you enter the Opera through the
court known as the Cour de l'Administration.</p>

<p>To return to the evening in question.</p>

<p>"It's the ghost!" little Jammes had cried.</p>

<p>An agonizing silence now reigned in the dressing-room. Nothing
was heard but the hard breathing of the girls. At last, Jammes,
flinging herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every
mark of real terror on her face, whispered:</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door. There
was no sound of footsteps. It was like light silk sliding over
the panel. Then it stopped.</p>

<p>Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others. She went up
to the door and, in a quavering voice, asked:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>But nobody answered. Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching
her last movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said
very loudly:</p>

<p>"Is there any one behind the door?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes! Of course there is!" cried that little dried
plum of a Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze
skirt. "Whatever you do, don't open the door! Oh, Lord, don't
open the door!"</p>

<p>But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned
the key and drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated
to the inner dressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:</p>

<p>"Mother! Mother!"</p>

<p>Sorelli looked into the passage bravely. It was empty; a
gas-flame, in its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light
into the surrounding darkness, without succeeding in dispelling
it. And the dancer slammed the door again, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "there is no one there."</p>

<p>"Still, we saw him!" Jammes declared, returning with timid
little steps to her place beside Sorelli. "He must be somewhere
prowling about. I shan't go back to dress. We had better all go
down to the foyer together, at once, for the 'speech,' and we
will come up again together."</p>

<p>And the child reverently touched the little coral finger-ring
which she wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli,
stealthily, with the tip of her pink right thumb-nail, made a St.
Andrew's cross on the wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger
of her left hand. She said to the little ballet-girls:</p>

<p>"Come, children, pull yourselves together! I dare say no one
has ever seen the ghost."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we saw him&mdash;we saw him just now!" cried the
girls. "He had his death's head and his dress-coat, just as when
he appeared to Joseph Buquet!"</p>

<p>"And Gabriel saw him too!" said Jammes. "Only yesterday!
Yesterday afternoon&mdash;in broad day-light...."</p>

<p>"Gabriel, the chorus-master?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, didn't you know?"</p>

<p>"And he was wearing his dress-clothes, in broad daylight?"</p>

<p>"Who? Gabriel?"</p>

<p>"Why, no, the ghost!"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Gabriel told me so himself. That's what he knew
him by. Gabriel was in the stage-manager's office. Suddenly the
door opened and the Persian entered. You know the Persian has the
evil eye...."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" answered the little ballet-girls in chorus, warding
off ill-luck by pointing their forefinger and little finger at
the absent Persian, while their second and third fingers were
bent on the palm and held down by the thumb.</p>

<p>"And you know how superstitious Gabriel is," continued Jammes.
"However, he is always polite. When he meets the Persian, he just
puts his hand in his pocket and touches his keys. Well, the
moment the Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one jump
from his chair to the lock of the cupboard, so as to touch iron!
In doing so, he tore a whole skirt of his overcoat on a nail.
Hurrying to get out of the room, he banged his forehead against a
hat-peg and gave himself a huge bump; then, suddenly stepping
back, he skinned his arm on the screen, near the piano; he tried
to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his hands and crushed
his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a madman, slipped
on the staircase and came down the whole of the first flight on
his back. I was just passing with mother. We picked him up. He
was covered with bruises and his face was all over blood. We were
frightened out of our lives, but, all at once, he began to thank
Providence that he had got off so cheaply. Then he told us what
had frightened him. He had seen the ghost behind the Persian,
<i>the ghost with the death's head</i>, just like Joseph Buquet's
description!"</p>

<p>Jammes had told her story ever so quickly, as though the ghost
were at her heels, and was quite out of breath at the finish. A
silence followed, while Sorelli polished her nails in great
excitement. It was broken by little Giry, who said:</p>

<p>"Joseph Buquet would do better to hold his tongue."</p>

<p>"Why should he hold his tongue?" asked somebody.</p>

<p>"That's mother's opinion," replied Meg, lowering her voice and
looking all about her as though fearing lest other ears than
those present might overhear.</p>

<p>"And why is it your mother's opinion?"</p>

<p>"Hush! Mother says the ghost doesn't like being talked
about."</p>

<p>"And why does your mother say so?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;nothing...."</p>

<p>This reticence exasperated the curiosity of the young ladies,
who crowded round little Giry, begging her to explain herself.
They were there, side by side, leaning forward simultaneously in
one movement of entreaty and fear, communicating their terror to
one another, taking a keen pleasure in feeling their blood freeze
in their veins.</p>

<p>"I swore not to tell!" gasped Meg.</p>

<p>But they left her no peace and promised to keep the secret,
until Meg, burning to say all she knew, began, with her eyes
fixed on the door:</p>

<p>"Well, it's because of the private box."</p>

<p>"What private box?"</p>

<p>"The ghost's box!"</p>

<p>"Has the ghost a box? Oh, do tell us, do tell us!"</p>

<p>"Not so loud!" said Meg. "It's Box Five, you know, the box on
the grand tier, next to the stage-box, on the left."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I tell you it is. Mother has charge of it. But you swear you
won't say a word?"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the ghost's box. No one has had it for over a
month, except the ghost, and orders have been given at the
box-office that it must never be sold."</p>

<p>"And does the ghost really come there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then somebody does come?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! The ghost comes, but there is nobody there."</p>

<p>The little ballet-girls exchanged glances. If the ghost came
to the box, he must be seen, because he wore a dress-coat and a
death's head. This was what they tried to make Meg understand,
but she replied:</p>

<p>"That's just it! The ghost is not seen. And he has no
dress-coat and no head! All that talk about his death's head and
his head of fire is nonsense! There's nothing in it. You only
hear him when he is in the box. Mother has never seen him, but
she has heard him. Mother knows, because she gives him his
program."</p>

<p>Sorelli interfered. "Giry, child, you're getting at us!"</p>

<p>Thereupon little Giry began to cry.</p>

<p>"I ought to have held my tongue&mdash;if mother ever came to
know! But I was quite right, Joseph Buquet had no business to
talk of things that don't concern him&mdash;it will bring him bad
luck&mdash;mother was saying so last night...."</p>

<p>There was a sound of hurried and heavy footsteps in the
passage and a breathless voice cried:</p>

<p>"Cecile! Cecile! Are you there?"</p>

<p>"It's mother's voice," said Jammes. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>She opened the door. A respectable lady, built on the lines of
a Pomeranian grenadier, burst into the dressing-room and dropped
groaning into a vacant arm-chair. Her eyes rolled madly in her
brick-dust colored face.</p>

<p>"How awful!" she said. "How awful!"</p>

<p>"What? What?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Buquet...."</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Buquet is dead!"</p>

<p>The room became filled with exclamations, with astonished
outcries, with scared requests for explanations.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was found hanging in the third-floor cellar!"</p>

<p>"It's the ghost!" little Giry blurted, as though in spite of
herself; but she at once corrected herself, with her hands
pressed to her mouth: "No, no!&mdash;I didn't say it!&mdash;I
didn't say it!"</p>

<p>All around her, her panic-stricken companions repeated under
their breaths:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it must be the ghost!"</p>

<p>Sorelli was very pale.</p>

<p>"I shall never be able to recite my speech," she said.</p>

<p>Ma Jammes gave her opinion, while she emptied a glass of
liqueur that happened to be standing on a table; the ghost must
have something to do with it.</p>

<p>The truth is that no one ever knew how Joseph Buquet met his
death. The verdict at the inquest was "natural suicide." In his
<i>Memoirs of a Manager</i>, M. Moncharmin, one of the joint
managers who succeeded MM. Debienne and Poligny, describes the
incident as follows:</p>

<br>

<p>"A grievous accident spoiled the little party which MM.
Debienne and Poligny gave to celebrate their retirement. I was in
the manager's office, when Mercier, the acting-manager, suddenly
came darting in. He seemed half mad and told me that the body of
a scene-shifter had been found hanging in the third cellar under
the stage, between a farm-house and a scene from the <i>Roi de
Lahore</i>. I shouted:</p>

<p>"'Come and cut him down!'</p>

<p>"By the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's
ladder, the man was no longer hanging from his rope!"</p>

<br>

<p>So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural. A man
hangs at the end of a rope; they to cut him down; the rope has
disappeared. Oh, M. Moncharmin found a very simple
explanation!</p>

<p>Listen to him:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"It was just after the ballet; and leaders and
dancing-girls lost no time in taking their precautions against
the evil eye."</p>

<br>

<p>There you are! Picture the <i>corps de ballet</i> scuttling
down the Jacob's ladder and dividing the suicide's rope among
themselves in less time than it takes to write! When, on the
other hand, I think of the exact spot where the body was
discovered&mdash;the third cellar underneath the stage&mdash;I
imagine that <i>somebody</i> must have been interested in seeing
that the rope disappeared after it had effected its purpose; and
time will show if I am wrong.</p>

<p>The horrid news soon spread all over the Opera, where Joseph
Buquet was very popular. The dressing-rooms emptied and the
ballet-girls, crowding around Sorelli like timid sheep around
their shepherdess, made for the foyer through the ill-lit
passages and staircases, trotting as fast as their little pink
legs could carry them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE NEW MARGARITA</h3>

<p class="first">
ON the first landing, Sorelli ran against the Comte de Chagny,
who was coming upstairs. The count, who was generally so calm,
seemed greatly excited.</p>

<p>"I was just going to you," he said, taking off his hat. "Oh,
Sorelli, what an evening! And Christine Daaé: what a
triumph!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Meg Giry. "Six months ago, she used to sing
like a <i>crock</i>! But do let us get by, my dear count,"
continues the brat, with a saucy curtsey. "We are going to
inquire after a poor man who was found hanging by the neck."</p>

<p>Just then the acting-manager came fussing past and stopped
when he heard this remark.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed roughly. "Have you girls heard already?
Well, please forget about it for tonight&mdash;and above all
don't let M. Debienne and M. Poligny hear; it would upset them
too much on their last day."</p>

<p>They all went on to the foyer of the ballet, which was already
full of people. The Comte de Chagny was right; no gala
performance ever equalled this one. All the great composers of
the day had conducted their own works in turns. Faure and Krauss
had sung; and, on that evening, Christine Daaé had revealed her
true self, for the first time, to the astonished and enthusiastic
audience. Gounod had conducted the <i>Funeral March of a
Marionnette</i>; Reyer, his beautiful overture to <i>Siguar</i>;
Saint Saëns, the <i>Danse Macabre</i> and a <i>Rêverie
Orientale</i>; Massenet, an unpublished Hungarian march; Guiraud,
his <i>Carnaval</i>; Delibes, the <i>Valse lente</i> from
<i>Sylvia</i> and the <i>Pizzicati</i> from <i>Coppelia</i>.
Mlle. Krauss had sung the bolero in the <i>Vespri Siciliani</i>;
and Mlle. Denise Bloch the drinking song in <i>Lucrezia
Borgia</i>.</p>

<p>But the real triumph was reserved for Christine Daaé, who had
begun by singing a few passages from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. It
was the first time that the young artist sang in this work of
Gounod, which had not been transferred to the Opera and which was
revived at the Opéra Comique after it had been produced at the
old Theatre Lyrique by Mme. Carvalho. Those who heard her say
that her voice, in these passages, was seraphic; but this was
nothing to the superhuman notes that she gave forth in the prison
scene and the final trio in <i>Faust</i>, which she sang in the
place of La Carlotta, who was ill. No one had ever heard or seen
anything like it.</p>

<p>Daaé revealed a new Margarita that night, a Margarita of a
splendor, a radiance hitherto unsuspected. The whole house went
mad, rising to its feet, shouting, cheering, clapping, while
Christine sobbed and fainted in the arms of her fellow-singers
and had to be carried to her dressing-room. A few subscribers,
however, protested. Why had so great a treasure been kept from
them all that time? Till then, Christine Daaé had played a good
Siebel to Carlotta's rather too splendidly material Margarita.
And it had needed Carlotta's incomprehensible and inexcusable
absence from this gala night for the little Daaé, at a moment's
warning, to show all that she could do in a part of the program
reserved for the Spanish diva! Well, what the subscribers wanted
to know was, why had Debienne and Poligny applied to Daaé, when
Carlotta was taken ill? Did they know of her hidden genius? And,
if they knew of it, why had they kept it hidden? And why had she
kept it hidden? Oddly enough, she was not known to have a
professor of singing at that moment. She had often said she meant
to practise alone for the future. The whole thing was a
mystery.</p>

<p>The Comte de Chagny, standing up in his box, listened to all
this frenzy and took part in it by loudly applauding. Philippe
Georges Marie Comte de Chagny was just forty-one years of age. He
was a great aristocrat and a good-looking man, above middle
height and with attractive features, in spite of his hard
forehead and his rather cold eyes. He was exquisitely polite to
the women and a little haughty to the men, who did not always
forgive him for his successes in society. He had an excellent
heart and an irreproachable conscience. On the death of old Count
Philibert, he became the head of one of the oldest and most
distinguished families in France, whose arms dated back to the
fourteenth century. The Chagnys owned a great deal of property;
and, when the old count, who was a widower, died, it was no easy
task for Philippe to accept the management of so large an estate.
His two sisters and his brother, Raoul, would not hear of a
division and waived their claim to their shares, leaving
themselves entirely in Philippe's hands, as though the right of
primogeniture had never ceased to exist. When the two sisters
married, on the same day, they received their portion from their
brother, not as a thing rightfully belonging to them, but as a
dowry for which they thanked him.</p>

<p>The Comtesse de Chagny, <i>née</i> de Moerogis de La
Martyniere, had died in giving birth to Raoul, who was born
twenty years after his elder brother. At the time of the old
count's death, Raoul was twelve years of age. Philippe busied
himself actively with the youngster's education. He was admirably
assisted in this work first by his sisters and afterward by an
old aunt, the widow of a naval officer, who lived at Brest and
gave young Raoul a taste for the sea. The lad entered the
<i>Borda</i> training-ship, finished his course with honors and
quietly made his trip round the world. Thanks to powerful
influence, he had just been appointed a member of the official
expedition on board the <i>Requin</i>, which was to be sent to
the Arctic Circle in search of the survivors of the D'Artoi's
expedition, of whom nothing had been heard for three years.
Meanwhile, he was enjoying a long furlough which would not be
over for six months; and already the dowagers of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain were pitying the handsome and apparently delicate
stripling for the hard work in store for him.</p>

<p>The shyness of the sailor-lad&mdash;I was almost saying his
innocence&mdash;was remarkable. He seemed to have but just left
the women's apron-strings. As a matter of fact, petted as he was
by his two sisters and his old aunt, he had retained from this
purely feminine education manners that were almost candid and
stamped with a charm that nothing had yet been able to sully. He
was a little over twenty-one years of age and looked eighteen. He
had a small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes and a complexion
like a girl's.</p>

<p>Philippe spoiled Raoul. To begin with, he was very proud of
him and pleased to foresee a glorious career for his junior in
the navy in which one of their ancestors, the famous Chagny de La
Roche, had held the rank of admiral. He took advantage of the
young man's leave of absence to show him Paris, with all its
luxurious and artistic delights. The count considered that, at
Raoul's age, it is not good to be too good. Philippe himself had
a character that was very well-balanced in work and pleasure
alike; his demeanor was always faultless; and he was incapable of
setting his brother a bad example. He took him with him wherever
he went. He even introduced him to the foyer of the ballet. I
know that the count was said to be "on terms" with Sorelli. But
it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this nobleman, a
bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his sisters
were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in
the company of a dancer, who, though not so very, very witty, had
the finest eyes that ever were seen! And, besides, there are
places where a true Parisian, when he has the rank of the Comte
de Chagny, is bound to show himself; and at that time the foyer
of the ballet at the Opera was one of those places.</p>

<p>Lastly, Philippe would perhaps not have taken his brother
behind the scenes of the Opera if Raoul had not been the first to
ask him, repeatedly renewing his request with a gentle obstinacy
which the count remembered at a later date.</p>

<p>On that evening, Philippe, after applauding the Daaé, turned
to Raoul and saw that he was quite pale.</p>

<p>"Don't you see," said Raoul, "that the woman's fainting?"</p>

<p>"You look like fainting yourself," said the count. "What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>But Raoul had recovered himself and was standing up.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," he said, "she never sang like that
before."</p>

<p>The count gave his brother a curious smiling glance and seemed
quite pleased. They were soon at the door leading from the house
to the stage. Numbers of subscribers were slowly making their way
through. Raoul tore his gloves without knowing what he was doing
and Philippe had much too kind a heart to laugh at him for his
impatience. But he now understood why Raoul was absent-minded
when spoken to and why he always tried to turn every conversation
to the subject of the Opera.</p>

<p>They reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of
gentlemen, scene-shifters, supers and chorus-girls, Raoul leading
the way, feeling that his heart no longer belonged to him, his
face set with passion, while Count Philippe followed him with
difficulty and continued to smile. At the back of the stage,
Raoul had to stop before the inrush of the little troop of
ballet-girls who blocked the passage which he was trying to
enter. More than one chaffing phrase darted from little made-up
lips, to which he did not reply; and at last he was able to pass,
and dived into the semi-darkness of a corridor ringing with the
name of "Daaé! Daaé!" The count was surprised to find that Raoul
knew the way. He had never taken him to Christine's himself and
came to the conclusion that Raoul must have gone there alone
while the count stayed talking in the foyer with Sorelli, who
often asked him to wait until it was her time to "go on" and
sometimes handed him the little gaiters in which she ran down
from her dressing-room to preserve the spotlessness of her satin
dancing-shoes and her flesh-colored tights. Sorelli had an
excuse; she had lost her mother.</p>

<p>Postponing his usual visit to Sorelli for a few minutes, the
count followed his brother down the passage that led to Daaé's
dressing-room and saw that it had never been so crammed as on
that evening, when the whole house seemed excited by her success
and also by her fainting fit. For the girl had not yet come to;
and the doctor of the theater had just arrived at the moment when
Raoul entered at his heels. Christine, therefore, received the
first aid of the one, while opening her eyes in the arms of the
other. The count and many more remained crowding in the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Doctor, that those gentlemen had better
clear the room?" asked Raoul coolly. "There's no breathing
here."</p>

<p>"You're quite right," said the doctor.</p>

<p>And he sent every one away, except Raoul and the maid, who
looked at Raoul with eyes of the most undisguised astonishment.
She had never seen him before and yet dared not question him; and
the doctor imagined that the young man was only acting as he did
because he had the right to. The viscount, therefore, remained in
the room watching Christine as she slowly returned to life, while
even the joint managers, Debienne and Poligny, who had come to
offer their sympathy and congratulations, found themselves thrust
into the passage among the crowd of dandies. The Comte de Chagny,
who was one of those standing outside, laughed:</p>

<p>"Oh, the rogue, the rogue!" And he added, under his breath:
"Those youngsters with their school-girl airs! So he's a Chagny
after all!"</p>

<p>He turned to go to Sorelli's dressing-room, but met her on the
way, with her little troop of trembling ballet-girls, as we have
seen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Christine Daaé uttered a deep sigh, which was
answered by a groan. She turned her head, saw Raoul and started.
She looked at the doctor, on whom she bestowed a smile, then at
her maid, then at Raoul again.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," she said, in a voice not much above a whisper,
"who are you?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," replied the young man, kneeling on one knee
and pressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, <i>"I am the
little boy who went into the sea to rescue your scarf!"</i>. </p>

<p>Christine again looked at the doctor and the maid; and all
three began to laugh. Raoul turned very red and stood up. </p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "since you are pleased not to
recognize me, I should like to say something to you in private,
something very important."</p>

<p>"When I am better, do you mind?" And her voice shook. "You have
been very good."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must go," said the doctor, with his pleasantest
smile. "Leave me to attend to mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"I am not ill now," said Christine suddenly, with strange and
unexpected energy.</p>

<p>She rose and passed her hand over her eyelids.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doctor. I should like to be alone. Please go away,
all of you. Leave me. I feel very restless this evening."</p>

<p>The doctor tried to make a short protest, but, perceiving the
girl's evident agitation, he thought the best remedy was not to
thwart her. And he went away, saying to Raoul, outside:</p>

<p>"She is not herself to-night. She is usually so gentle."</p>

<p>Then he said good night and Raoul was left alone. The whole of
this part of the theater was now deserted. The farewell ceremony
was no doubt taking place in the foyer of the ballet. Raoul
thought that Daaé might go to it and he waited in the silent
solitude, even hiding in the favoring shadow of a doorway. He
felt a terrible pain at his heart and it was of this that he
wanted to speak to Daaé without delay.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dressing-room door opened and the maid came out
by herself, carrying bundles. He stopped her and asked how her
mistress was. The woman laughed and said that she was quite well,
but that he must not disturb her, for she wished to be left
alone. And she passed on. One idea alone filled Raoul's burning
brain: of course, Daaé wished to be left alone <i>for him</i>!
Had he not told her that he wanted to speak to her privately?</p>

<p>Hardly breathing, he went up to the dressing-room and, with
his ear to the door to catch her reply, prepared to knock. But
his hand dropped. He had heard <i>a man's voice</i> in the
dressing-room, saying, in a curiously masterful tone:</p>

<p>"Christine, you must love me!"</p>

<p>And Christine's voice, infinitely sad and trembling, as though
accompanied by tears, replied:</p>

<p>"How can you talk like that? <i>When I sing only for
you!</i>"</p>

<p>Raoul leaned against the panel to ease his pain. His heart,
which had seemed gone for ever, returned to his breast and was
throbbing loudly. The whole passage echoed with its beating and
Raoul's ears were deafened. Surely, if his heart continued to
make such a noise, they would hear it inside, they would open the
door and the young man would be turned away in disgrace. What a
position for a Chagny! To be caught listening behind a door! He
took his heart in his two hands to make it stop.</p>

<p>The man's voice spoke again:</p>

<p>"Are you very tired?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to-night I gave you my soul and I am dead!" Christine
replied.</p>

<p>"Your soul is a beautiful thing, child," replied the grave
man's voice, "and I thank you. No emperor ever received so fair a
gift. <i>The angels wept to-night</i>."</p>

<p>Raoul heard nothing after that. Nevertheless, he did not go
away, but, as though he feared lest he should be caught, he
returned to his dark corner, determined to wait for the man to
leave the room. At one and the same time, he had learned what
love meant, and hatred. He knew that he loved. He wanted to know
whom he hated. To his great astonishment, the door opened and
Christine Daaé appeared, wrapped in furs, with her face hidden in
a lace veil, alone. She closed the door behind her, but Raoul
observed that she did not lock it. She passed him. He did not
even follow her with his eyes, for his eyes were fixed on the
door, which did not open again.</p>

<p>When the passage was once more deserted, he crossed it, opened
the door of the dressing-room, went in and shut the door. He
found himself in absolute darkness. The gas had been turned
out.</p>

<p>"There is some one here!" said Raoul, with his back against
the closed door, in a quivering voice. "What are you hiding
for?"</p>

<p>All was darkness and silence. Raoul heard only the sound of
his own breathing. He quite failed to see that the indiscretion
of his conduct was exceeding all bounds.</p>

<p>"You shan't leave this until I let you!" he exclaimed. "If you
don't answer, you are a coward! But I'll expose you!"</p>

<p>And he struck a match. The blaze lit up the room. There was no
one in the room! Raoul, first turning the key in the door, lit
the gas-jets. He went into the dressing-closet, opened the
cupboards, hunted about, felt the walls with his moist hands.
Nothing!</p>

<p>"Look here!" he said, aloud. "Am I going mad?" He stood for
ten minutes listening to the gas flaring in the silence of the
empty room; lover though he was, he did not even think of
stealing a ribbon that would have given him the perfume of the
woman he: loved. He went out, not knowing what he was doing nor
where he was going. At a given moment in his wayward progress, an
icy draft struck him in the face. He found himself at the bottom
of a staircase, down which, behind him, a procession of workmen
were carrying a sort of stretcher, covered with a white
sheet.</p>

<p>"Which is the way out, please?" he asked of one of the
men.</p>

<p>"Straight in front of you, the door is open. But let us
pass."</p>

<p>Pointing to the stretcher, he asked mechanically:</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>The workmen answered:</p>

<p>"'That' is Joseph Buquet, who was found in the third cellar,
hanging between a farm-house and a scene from the <i>Roi de
Lahore</i>."</p>

<p>He took off his hat, fell back to make room for the procession
and went out.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS REASON</h3>

<p class="first">
DURING this time, the farewell ceremony was taking place. I
have already said that this magnificent function was being given
on the occasion of the retirement of M. Debienne and M. Poligny,
who had determined to "die game," as we say nowadays. They had
been assisted in the realization of their ideal, though
melancholy, program by all that counted in the social and
artistic world of Paris. All these people met, after the
performance, in the foyer of the ballet, where Sorelli waited for
the arrival of the retiring managers with a glass of champagne in
her hand and a little prepared speech at the tip of her tongue.
Behind her, the members of the <i>corps de ballet</i>, young and
old, discussed the events of the day in whispers or exchanged
discreet signals with their friends, a noisy crowd of whom
surrounded the supper-tables arranged along the slanting
floor.</p>

<p>A few of the dancers had already changed into ordinary dress;
but most of them wore their skirts of gossamer gauze; and all had
thought it the right thing to put on a special face for the
occasion: all, that is, except little Jammes, whose fifteen
summers&mdash;happy age!&mdash;seemed already to have forgotten
the ghost and the death of Joseph Buquet. She never ceased to
laugh and chatter, to hop about and play practical jokes, until
MM. Debienne and Poligny appeared on the steps of the foyer, when
she was severely called to order by the impatient Sorelli.</p>

<p>Everybody remarked that the retiring managers looked cheerful,
as is the Paris way. None will ever be a true Parisian who has
not learned to wear a mask of gaiety over his sorrows and one of
sadness, boredom or indifference over his inward joy. You know
that one of your friends is in trouble; do not try to console
him: he will tell you that he is already comforted; but, should
he have met with good fortune, be careful how you congratulate
him: he thinks it so natural that he is surprised that you should
speak of it. In Paris, our lives are one masked ball; and the
foyer of the ballet is the last place in which two men so
"knowing" as M. Debienne and M. Poligny would have made the
mistake of betraying their grief, however genuine it might be.
And they were already smiling rather too broadly upon Sorelli,
who had begun to recite her speech, when an exclamation from that
little madcap of a Jammes broke the smile of the managers so
brutally that the expression of distress and dismay that lay
beneath it became apparent to all eyes:</p>

<p>"The Opera ghost!"</p>

<p>Jammes yelled these words in a tone of unspeakable terror; and
her finger pointed, among the crowd of dandies, to a face so
pallid, so lugubrious and so ugly, with two such deep black
cavities under the straddling eyebrows, that the death's head in
question immediately scored a huge success.</p>

<p>"The Opera ghost! The Opera ghost!"</p>

<p>Everybody laughed and pushed his neighbor and wanted to offer
the Opera ghost a drink, but he was gone. He had slipped through
the crowd; and the others vainly hunted for him, while two old
gentlemen tried to calm little Jammes and while little Giry stood
screaming like a peacock.</p>

<p>Sorelli was furious; she had not been able to finish her
speech; the managers had kissed her, thanked her and run away as
fast as the ghost himself. No one was surprised at this, for it
was known that they were to go through the same ceremony on the
floor above, in the foyer of the singers, and that finally they
were themselves to receive their personal friends, for the last
time, in the great lobby outside the managers' office, where a
regular supper would be served.</p>

<p>Here they found the new managers, M. Armand Moncharmin and M.
Firmin Richard, whom they hardly knew; nevertheless, they were
lavish in protestations of friendship and received a thousand
flattering compliments in reply, so that those of the guests who
had feared that they had a rather tedious evening in store for
them at once put on brighter faces. The supper was almost gay and
a particularly clever speech of the representative of the
government, mingling the glories of the past with the successes
of the future, caused the greatest cordiality to prevail.</p>

<p>The retiring managers had already handed over to their
successors the two tiny master-keys which opened all the
doors&mdash;thousands of doors&mdash;of the Opera house. And
those little keys, the object of general curiosity, were being
passed from hand to hand, when the attention of some of the
guests was diverted by their discovery, at the end of the table,
of that strange, wan and fantastic face, with the hollow eyes,
which had already appeared in the foyer of the ballet and been
greeted by little Jammes' exclamation:</p>

<p>"The Opera ghost!"</p>

<p>There sat the ghost, as natural as could be, except that he
neither ate nor drank. Those who began by looking at him with a
smile ended by turning away their heads, for the sight of him at
once provoked the most funereal thoughts. No one repeated the
joke of the foyer, no one exclaimed: "There's the Opera
ghost!"</p>

<p>He himself did not speak a word and his very neighbors could
not have stated at what precise moment he had sat down between
them; but every one felt that if the dead did ever come and sit
at the table of the living, they could not cut a more ghastly
figure. The friends of Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin
thought that this lean and skinny guest was an acquaintance of
Debienne's or Poligny's, while Debienne's and Poligny's friends
believed that the cadaverous individual belonged to Firmin
Richard and Armand Moncharmin's party.</p>

<p>The result was that no request was made for an explanation; no
unpleasant remark; no joke in bad taste, which might have
offended this visitor from the tomb. A few of those present who
knew the story of the ghost and the description of him given by
the chief scene-shifter&mdash;they did not know of Joseph
Buquet's death&mdash;thought, in their own minds, that the man at
the end of the table might easily have passed for him; and yet,
according to the story, the ghost had no nose and the person in
question had. But M. Moncharmin declares, in his <i>Memoirs</i>,
that the guest's nose was transparent: "long, thin and
transparent" are his exact words. I, for my part, will add that
this might very well apply to a false nose. M. Moncharmin may
have taken for transparency what was only shininess. Everybody
knows that orthopaedic science provides beautiful false noses for
those who have lost their noses naturally or as the result of an
operation.</p>

<p>Did the ghost really take a seat at the managers' supper-table
that night, uninvited? And can we be sure that the figure was
that of the Opera ghost himself? Who would venture to assert as
much? I mention the incident, not because I wish for a second to
make the reader believe&mdash;or even to try to make him
believe&mdash;that the ghost was capable of such a sublime piece
of impudence; but because, after all, the thing is
impossible.</p>

<p>M. Armand Moncharmin, in chapter eleven of his <i>Memoirs</i>,
says:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">"When I think of this first evening, I can not
separate the secret confided to us by MM. Debienne and Poligny in
their office from the presence at our supper of that
<i>ghostly</i> person whom none of us knew."</p>

<br>

<p>What happened was this: MM. Debienne and Poligny, sitting at
the center of the table, had not seen the man with the death's
head. Suddenly he began to speak.</p>

<p>"The ballet-girls are right," he said. "The death of that poor
Buquet is perhaps not so natural as people think."</p>

<p>Debienne and Poligny gave a start.</p>

<p>"Is Buquet dead?" they cried.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man, or the shadow of a man, quietly. "He
was found, this evening, hanging in the third cellar, between a
farm-house and a scene from the <i>Roi de Lahore</i>."</p>

<p>The two managers, or rather ex-managers, at once rose and
stared strangely at the speaker. They were more excited than they
need have been, that is to say, more excited than any one need be
by the announcement of the suicide of a chief scene-shifter. They
looked at each other. They had both turned whiter than the
table-cloth. At last, Debienne made a sign to MM. Richard and
Moncharmin; Poligny muttered a few words of excuse to the guests;
and all four went into the managers' office. I leave M.
Moncharmin to complete the story. In his <i>Memoirs</i>, he
says:</p>

<br>

<p class="first">
"MM. Debienne and Poligny seemed to grow more and more
excited, and they appeared to have something very difficult to
tell us. First, they asked us if we knew the man, sitting at the
end of the table, who had told them of the death of Joseph
Buquet; and, when we answered in the negative, they looked still
more concerned. They took the master-keys from our hands, stared
at them for a moment and advised us to have new locks made, with
the greatest secrecy, for the rooms, closets and presses that we
might wish to have hermetically closed. They said this so funnily
that we began to laugh and to ask if there were thieves at the
Opera. They replied that there was something worse, which was the
<i>ghost</i>. We began to laugh again, feeling sure that they
were indulging in some joke that was intended to crown our little
entertainment. Then, at their request, we became 'serious,'
resolving to humor them and to enter into the spirit of the game.
They told us that they never would have spoken to us of the
ghost, if they had not received formal orders from the ghost
himself to ask us to be pleasant to him and to grant any request
that he might make. However, in their relief at leaving a domain
where that tyrannical shade held sway, they had hesitated until
the last moment to tell us this curious story, which our
skeptical minds were certainly not prepared to entertain. But the
announcement of the death of Joseph Buquet had served them as a
brutal reminder that, whenever they had disregarded the ghost's
wishes, some fantastic or disastrous event had brought them to a
sense of their dependence.</p>

<p>"During these unexpected utterances made in a tone of the most
secret and important confidence, I looked at Richard. Richard, in
his student days, had acquired a great reputation for practical
joking, and he seemed to relish the dish which was being served
up to him in his turn. He did not miss a morsel of it, though the
seasoning was a little gruesome because of the death of Buquet.
He nodded his head sadly, while the others spoke, and his
features assumed the air of a man who bitterly regretted having
taken over the Opera, now that he knew that there was a ghost
mixed up in the business. I could think of nothing better than to
give him a servile imitation of this attitude of despair.
However, in spite of all our efforts, we could not, at the
finish, help bursting out laughing in the faces of MM. Debienne
and Poligny, who, seeing us pass straight from the gloomiest
state of mind to one of the most insolent merriment, acted as
though they thought that we had gone mad.</p>

<p>"The joke became a little tedious; and Richard asked
half-seriously and half in jest:</p>

<p>"'But, after all, what does this ghost of yours want?'</p>

<p>"M. Poligny went to his desk and returned with a copy of the
memorandum-book. The memorandum-book begins with the well-known
words saying that 'the management of the Opera shall give to the
performance of the National Academy of Music the splendor that
becomes the first lyric stage in France' and ends with Clause 98,
which says that the privilege can be withdrawn if the manager
infringes the conditions stipulated in the memorandum-book. This
is followed by the conditions, which are four in number.</p>

<p>"The copy produced by M. Poligny was written in black ink and
exactly similar to that in our possession, except that, at the
end, it contained a paragraph in red ink and in a queer, labored
handwriting, as though it had been produced by dipping the heads
of matches into the ink, the writing of a child that has never
got beyond the down-strokes and has not learned to join its
letters. This paragraph ran, word for word, as follows:</p>

<p>"'5. Or if the manager, in any month, delay for more than a
fortnight the payment of the allowance which he shall make to the
Opera ghost, an allowance of twenty thousand francs a month, say
two hundred and forty thousand francs a year.'</p>

<p>"M. Poligny pointed with a hesitating finger to this last
clause, which we certainly did not expect.</p>

<p>"'Is this all? Does he not want anything else?' asked Richard,
with the greatest coolness.</p>

<p>"'Yes, he does,' replied Poligny.</p>

<p>"And he turned over the pages of the memorandum-book until he
came to the clause specifying the days on which certain private
boxes were to be reserved for the free use of the president of
the republic, the ministers and so on. At the end of this clause,
a line had been added, also in red ink:</p>

<p>"'Box Five on the grand tier shall be placed at the disposal
of the Opera ghost for every performance.'</p>

<p>"When we saw this, there was nothing else for us to do but to
rise from our chairs, shake our two predecessors warmly by the
hand and congratulate them on thinking of this charming little
joke, which proved that the old French sense of humor was never
likely to become extinct. Richard added that he now understood
why MM. Debienne and Poligny were retiring from the management of
the National Academy of Music. Business was impossible with so
unreasonable a ghost.</p>

<p>"'Certainly, two hundred and forty thousand francs are not be
picked up for the asking,' said M. Poligny, without moving a
muscle of his face. 'And have you considered what the loss over
Box Five meant to us? We did not sell it once; and not only that,
but we had to return the subscription: why, it's awful! We really
can't work to keep ghosts! We prefer to go away!'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' echoed M. Debienne, 'we prefer to go away. Let us
go.'</p>

<p>"And he stood up. Richard said: 'But, after all, it seems to
me that you were much too kind to the ghost. If I had such a
troublesome ghost as that, I should not hesitate to have him
arrested.'</p>

<p>"'But how? Where?' they cried, in chorus. 'We have never seen
him!'</p>

<p>"'But when he comes to his box?' </p>

<p>"'We have never seen him in his box!'</p>

<p>"'Then sell it.'</p>

<p>"'Sell the Opera ghost's box! Well, gentlemen, try it.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon we all four left the office. Richard and I had
'never laughed so much in our lives."</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>BOX FIVE</h3>

<p class="first">
ARMAND MONCHARMIN wrote such voluminous <i>Memoirs</i> during
the fairly long period of his co-management that we may well ask
if he ever found time to attend to the affairs of the Opera
otherwise than by telling what went on there. M. Moncharmin did
not know a note of music, but he called the minister of education
and fine arts by his Christian name, had dabbled a little in
society journalism and enjoyed a considerable private income.
Lastly, he was a charming fellow and showed that he was not
lacking in intelligence, for, as soon as he made up his mind to
be a sleeping partner in the Opera, he selected the best possible
active manager and went straight to Firmin Richard.</p>

<p>Firmin Richard was a very distinguished composer, who had
published a number of successful pieces of all kinds and who
liked nearly every form of music and every sort of musician.
Clearly, therefore, it was the duty of every sort of musician to
like M. Firmin Richard. The only things to be said against him
were that he was rather masterful in his ways and endowed with a
very hasty temper.</p>

<p>The first few days which the partners spent at the Opera were
given over to the delight of finding themselves the head of so
magnificent an enterprise; and they had forgotten all about that
curious, fantastic story of the ghost, when an incident occurred
that proved to them that the joke&mdash;if joke it were&mdash;was
not over. M. Firmin Richard reached his office that morning at
eleven o'clock. His secretary, M. Rémy, showed him half a dozen
letters which he had not opened because they were marked
"private." One of the letters had at once attracted Richard's
attention not only because the envelope was addressed in red ink,
but because he seemed to have seen the writing before. He soon
remembered that it was the red handwriting in which the
memorandum-book had been so curiously completed. He recognized
the clumsy childish hand. He opened the letter and read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Manager:</span></p>

<p class="letter">
I am sorry to have to trouble you at a time when you must be
so very busy, renewing important engagements, signing fresh ones
and generally displaying your excellent taste. I know what you
have done for Carlotta, Sorelli and little Jammes and for a few
others whose admirable qualities of talent or genius you have
suspected.</p>

<p class="letter">
Of course, when I use these words, I do not mean to apply them
to La Carlotta, who sings like a squirt and who ought never to
have been allowed to leave the Ambassadeurs and the Café Jacquin;
nor to La Sorelli, who owes her success mainly to the
coach-builders; nor to little Jammes, who dances like a calf in a
field. And I am not speaking of Christine Daaé either, though her
genius is certain, whereas your jealousy prevents her from
creating any important part. When all is said, you are free to
conduct your little business as you think best, are you not?</p>

<p class="letter">
All the same, I should like to take advantage of the fact that
you have not yet turned Christine Daaé out of doors by hearing
her this evening in the part of Siebel, as that of Margarita has
been forbidden her since her triumph of the other evening; and I
will ask you not to dispose of my box to-day nor on the
<u>following days</u>, for I can not end this letter without
telling you how disagreeably surprised I have been once or twice,
to hear, on arriving at the Opera, that my box had been sold, at
the box-office, by your orders.</p>

<p class="letter">
I did not protest, first, because I dislike scandal, and,
second, because I thought that your predecessors, MM. Debienne
and Poligny, who were always charming to me, had neglected,
before leaving, to mention my little fads to you. I have now
received a reply from those gentlemen to my letter asking for an
explanation, and this reply proves that you know all about my
<u>memorandum-book</u> and, consequently, that you are treating
me with outrageous contempt. <u>If you wish to live in peace, you
must not begin by taking away my private box</u>. </p>

<p class="letter">
Believe me to be, dear Mr. Manager, without prejudice to these
little observations,</p>

<p class="letter">Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Opera Ghost</span>.</p>

<br>

<p>The letter was accompanied by a cutting from the agony-column
of the <i>Revue Théâtrale</i>, which ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">O.G.&mdash;There is no excuse for R. and M. We
told them and left your memorandum-book in their hands. Kind
regards.</p>

<p><br>
M. Firmin Richard had hardly finished reading this letter when
M. Armand Moncharmin entered, carrying one exactly similar. They
looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"They are keeping up the joke," said M. Richard, "but I don't
call it funny."</p>

<p>"What does it all mean?" asked M. Moncharmin. "Do they imagine
that, because they have been managers of the Opera, we are going
to let them have a box for an indefinite period?"</p>

<p>"I am not in the mood to let myself be laughed at long," said
Firmin Richard.</p>

<p>"It's harmless enough," observed Armand Moncharmin. "What is
it they really want? A box for to-night?"</p>

<p>M. Firmin Richard told his secretary to send Box Five on the
grand tier to MM. Debienne and Poligny, if it was not sold. It
was not. It was sent off to them. Debienne lived at the corner of
the Rue Scribe and the Boulevard des Capucines; Poligny, in the
Rue Auber. O. Ghost's two letters had been posted at the
Boulevard des Capucines post-office, as Moncharmin remarked after
examining the envelopes.</p>

<p>"You see!" said Richard.</p>

<p>They shrugged their shoulders and regretted that two men of
that age should amuse themselves with such childish tricks.</p>

<p>"They might have been civil, for all that!" said Moncharmin.
"Did you notice how they treat us with regard to Carlotta,
Sorelli and Little Jammes?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear fellow, these two are mad with jealousy! To
think that they went to the expense of an advertisement in the
<i>Revue Théâtrale</i>! Have they nothing better to do?"</p>

<p>"By the way," said Moncharmin, "they seem to be greatly
interested in that little Christine Daaé!"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do that she has the reputation of being
quite good," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Reputations are easily obtained," replied Moncharmin.
"Haven't I a reputation for knowing all about music? And I don't
know one key from another."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid: you never had that reputation," Richard
declared.</p>

<p>Thereupon he ordered the artists to be shown in, who, for the
last two hours, had been walking up and down outside the door
behind which fame and fortune&mdash;or dismissal&mdash;awaited
them.</p>

<p>The whole day was spent in discussing, negotiating, signing or
cancelling contracts; and the two overworked managers went to bed
early, without so much as casting a glance at Box Five to see
whether M. Debienne and M. Poligny were enjoying the
performance.</p>

<p>Next morning, the managers received a card of thanks from the
ghost:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">
Dear Mr. Manager:</span></p>

<p class="letter">
Thanks. Charming evening. Daaé exquisite. Choruses want waking
up. Carlotta a splendid commonplace instrument. Will write you
soon for the 240,000 francs, or 233,424 fr. 70 c, to be correct.
MM. Debienne and Poligny have sent me the 6,575 fr. 30 c.
representing the first ten days of my allowance for the current
year; their privileges finished on the evening of the tenth inst.
Kind regards.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">O.G.</span></p>

<p><br>
On the other hand, there was a letter from MM. Debienne and
Poligny:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">
We are much obliged for your kind thought of us, but you will
easily understand that the prospect of again hearing "Faust",
pleasant though it is to ex-managers of the Opera, can not make
us forget that we have no right to occupy Box Five on the grand
tier, which is the exclusive property of <u>him</u> of whom we
spoke to you when we went through the memorandum-book with you
for the last time. See Clause 98, final paragraph.</p>

<p class="letter">Accept, gentlemen, etc.</p>

<br>

<p>"Oh, those fellows are beginning to annoy me!" shouted Firmin
Richard, snatching up the letter.</p>

<p>And that evening Box Five was sold.</p>

<p>The next morning, MM. Richard and Moncharmin, on reaching
their office, found an inspector's report relating to an incident
that had happened, the night before, in Box Five. I give the
essential part of the report:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
I was obliged to call in a municipal guard twice, this
evening, to clear Box Five on the grand tier, once at the
beginning and once in the middle of the second act. The
occupants, who arrived as the curtain rose on the second act,
created a regular scandal by their laughter and their ridiculous
observations. There were cries of "Hush!" all around them and the
whole house was beginning to protest, when the box-keeper came to
fetch me. I entered the box and said what I thought necessary.
The people did not seem to me to be in their right mind; and they
made stupid remarks. I said that, if the noise was repeated, I
should be compelled to clear the box. The moment I left, I heard
the laughing again, with fresh protests from the house. I
returned with a municipal guard, who turned them out. They
protested, still laughing, saying they would not go unless they
had their money back. At last, they became quiet and I allowed
them to enter the box again. The laughter at once recommenced;
and, this time, I had them turned out definitely.</p>

<br>

<p>"Send for the inspector," said Richard to his secretary, who
had already read the report and marked it with blue pencil.</p>

<p>M. Rémy, the secretary, had foreseen the order and called the
inspector at once.</p>

<p>"Tell us what happened," said Richard bluntly.</p>

<p>The inspector began to splutter and referred to the
report.</p>

<p>"Well, but what were those people laughing at?" asked
Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"They must have been dining, sir, and seemed more inclined to
lark about than to listen to good music. The moment they entered
the box, they came out again and called the box-keeper, who asked
them what they wanted. They said, 'Look in the box: there's no
one there, is there?' 'No,' said the woman. 'Well,' said they,
'when we went in, we heard a voice saying <i>that the box was
taken!'</i>"</p>

<p>M. Moncharmin could not help smiling as he looked at M.
Richard; but M. Richard did not smile. He himself had done too
much in that way in his time not to recognize, in the inspector's
story, all the marks of one of those practical jokes which begin
by amusing and end by enraging the victims. The inspector, to
curry favor with M. Moncharmin, who was smiling, thought it best
to give a smile too. A most unfortunate smile! M. Richard glared
at his subordinate, who thenceforth made it his business to
display a face of utter consternation.</p>

<p>"However, when the people arrived," roared Richard, "there was
no one in the box, was there?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul, sir, not a soul! Nor in the box on the right, nor
in the box on the left: not a soul, sir, I swear! The box-keeper
told it me often enough, which proves that it was all a
joke."</p>

<p>"Oh, you agree, do you?" said Richard. "You agree! It's a
joke! And you think it funny, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"I think it in very bad taste, sir."</p>

<p>"And what did the box-keeper say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she just said that it was the Opera ghost. That's all she
said!"</p>

<p>And the inspector grinned. But he soon found that he had made
a mistake in grinning, for the words had no sooner left his mouth
than M. Richard, from gloomy, became furious.</p>

<p>"Send for the box-keeper!" he shouted. "Send for her! This
minute! This minute! And bring her in to me here! And turn all
those people out!"</p>

<p>The inspector tried to protest, but Richard closed his mouth
with an angry order to hold his tongue. Then, when the wretched
man's lips seemed shut for ever, the manager commanded him to
open them once more.</p>

<p>"Who is this 'Opera ghost?'" he snarled. But the inspector was
by this time incapable of speaking a word. He managed to convey,
by a despairing gesture, that he knew nothing about it, or rather
that he did not wish to know.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen him, have you seen the Opera ghost?"</p>

<p>The inspector, by means of a vigorous shake of the head,
denied ever having seen the ghost in question.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said M. Richard coldly.</p>

<p>The inspector's eyes started out of his head, as though to ask
why the manager had uttered that ominous "Very well!"</p>

<p>"Because I'm going to settle the account of any one who has
not seen him!" explained the manager. "As he seems to be
everywhere, I can't have people telling me that they see him
nowhere. I like people to work for me when I employ them!"</p>

<p>Having said this, M. Richard paid no attention to the
inspector and discussed various matters of business with his
acting-manager, who had entered the room meanwhile. The inspector
thought he could go and was gently&mdash;oh, so
gently!&mdash;sidling toward the door, when M. Richard nailed the
man to the floor with a thundering:</p>

<p>"Stay where you are!"</p>

<p>M. Rémy had sent for the box-keeper to the Rue de Provence,
close to the Opera, where she was engaged as a porteress. She
soon made her appearance.</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Mame Giry. You know me well enough, sir; I'm the mother of
little Giry, little Meg, what!"</p>

<p>This was said in so rough and solemn a tone that, for a
moment, M. Richard was impressed. He looked at Mame Giry, in her
faded shawl, her worn shoes, her old taffeta dress and dingy
bonnet. It was quite evident from the manager's attitude, that he
either did not know or could not remember having met Mame Giry,
nor even little Giry, nor even "little Meg!" But Mame Giry's
pride was so great that the celebrated box-keeper imagined that
everybody knew her.</p>

<p>"Never heard of her!" the manager declared. "But that's no
reason, Mame Giry, why I shouldn't ask you what happened last
night to make you and the inspector call in a municipal
guard..."</p>

<p>"I was just wanting to see you, sir, and talk to you about it,
so that you mightn't have the same unpleasantness as M. Debienne
and M. Poligny. They wouldn't listen to me either, at first."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking you about all that. I'm asking what happened
last night."</p>

<p>Mame Giry turned purple with indignation. Never had she been
spoken to like that. She rose as though to go, gathering up the
folds of her skirt and waving the feathers of her dingy bonnet
with dignity, but, changing her mind, she sat down again and
said, in a haughty voice:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what happened. The ghost was annoyed
again!"</p>

<p>Thereupon, as M. Richard was on the point of bursting out, M.
Moncharmin interfered and conducted the interrogatory, whence it
appeared that Mame Giry thought it quite natural that a voice
should be heard to say that a box was taken, when there was
nobody in the box. She was unable to explain this phenomenon,
which was not new to her, except by the intervention of the
ghost. Nobody could see the ghost in his box, but everybody could
hear him. She had often heard him; and they could believe her,
for she always spoke the truth. They could ask M. Debienne and M.
Poligny, and anybody who knew her; and also M. Isidore Saack, who
had had a leg broken by the ghost!</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Moncharmin, interrupting her. "Did the ghost
break poor Isidore Saack's leg?"</p>

<p>Mame Giry opened her eyes with astonishment at such ignorance.
However, she consented to enlighten those two poor innocents. The
thing had happened in M. Debienne and M. Poligny's time, also in
Box Five and also during a performance of <i>Faust</i>. Mame Giry
coughed, cleared her throat&mdash;it sounded as though she were
preparing to sing the whole of Gounod's score&mdash;and
began:</p>

<p>"It was like this, sir. That night, M. Maniera and his lady,
the jewelers in the Rue Mogador, were sitting in the front of the
box, with their great friend, M. Isidore Saack, sitting behind
Mme. Maniera. Mephistopheles was singing"&mdash;Mame Giry here
burst into song herself&mdash;"'Catarina, while you play at
sleeping,' and then M. Maniera heard a voice in his right ear
(his wife was on his left) saying, 'Ha, ha! Julie's not playing
at sleeping!' His wife happened to be called Julie. So. M.
Maniera turns to the right to see who was talking to him like
that. Nobody there! He rubs his ear and asks himself if he's
dreaming. Then Mephistopheles went on with his serenade....  But,
perhaps I'm boring you gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"No, no, go on."</p>

<p>"You are too good, gentlemen," with a smirk. "Well, then,
Mephistopheles went on with his serenade"&mdash;Mame Giry, burst
into song again&mdash;"'Saint, unclose thy portals holy and
accord the bliss, to a mortal bending lowly, of a pardon-kiss.'
And then M. Maniera again hears the voice in his right ear,
saying, this time, 'Ha, ha! Julie wouldn't mind according a kiss
to Isidore!' Then he turns round again, but, this time, to the
left; and what do you think he sees? Isidore, who had taken his
lady's hand and was covering it with kisses through the little
round place in the glove&mdash;like this,
gentlemen"&mdash;rapturously kissing the bit of palm left bare in
the middle of her thread gloves. "Then they had a lively time
between them! Bang! Bang! M. Maniera, who was big and strong,
like you, M. Richard, gave two blows to M. Isidore Saack, who was
small and weak like M. Moncharmin, saving his presence. There was
a great uproar. People in the house shouted, 'That will do! Stop
them! He'll kill him!' Then, at last, M. Isidore Saack managed to
run away."</p>

<p>"Then the ghost had not broken his leg?" asked M. Moncharmin,
a little vexed that his figure had made so little impression on
Mame Giry.</p>

<p>"He did break it for him, sir," replied Mame Giry haughtily.
"He broke it for him on the grand staircase, which he ran down
too fast, sir, and it will be long before the poor gentleman will
be able to go up it again!"</p>

<p>"Did the ghost tell you what he said in M. Maniera's right
ear?" asked M. Moncharmin, with a gravity which he thought
exceedingly humorous.</p>

<p>"No, sir, it was M. Maniera himself. So&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you have spoken to the ghost, my good lady?"</p>

<p>"As I'm speaking to you now, my good sir!" Mame Giry
replied.</p>

<p>"And, when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?"</p>

<p>"Well, he tells me to bring him a footstool!"</p>

<p>This time, Richard burst out laughing, as did Moncharmin and
Rémy, the secretary. Only the inspector, warned by experience,
was careful not to laugh, while Mame Giry ventured to adopt an
attitude that was positively threatening.</p>

<p>"Instead of laughing," she cried indignantly, "you'd do better
to do as M. Poligny did, who found out for himself."</p>

<p>"Found out about what?" asked Moncharmin, who had never been
so much amused in his life.</p>

<p>"About the ghost, of course!... Look here..."</p>

<p>She suddenly calmed herself, feeling that this was a solemn
moment in her life:</p>

<p><i>"Look here,"</i> she repeated. "They were playing <i>La
Juive</i>. M. Poligny thought he would watch the performance from
the ghost's box.... Well, when Leopold cries, 'Let us
fly!'&mdash;you know&mdash;and Eleazer stops them and says,
'Whither go ye?'... well, M. Poligny&mdash;I was watching him
from the back of the next box, which was empty&mdash;M. Poligny
got up and walked out quite stiffly, like a statue, and before I
had time to ask him, 'Whither go ye?' like Eleazer, he was down
the staircase, but without breaking his leg...."</p>

<p>"Still, that doesn't let us know how the Opera ghost came to
ask you for a footstool," insisted M. Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"Well, from that evening, no one tried to take the ghost's
private box from him. The manager gave orders that he was to have
it at each performance. And, whenever he came, he asked me for a
footstool."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut! A ghost asking for a footstool! Then this ghost of
yours is a woman?"</p>

<p>"No, the ghost is a man."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"He has a man's voice, oh, such a lovely man's voice! This is
what happens: When he comes to the opera, it's usually in the
middle of the first act. He gives three little taps on the door
of Box Five. The first time I heard those three taps, when I knew
there was no one in the box, you can think how puzzled I was! I
opened the door, listened, looked; nobody! And then I heard a
voice say, 'Mame Jules'&mdash;my poor husband's name was
Jules&mdash;'a footstool, please.' Saving your presence,
gentlemen, it made me feel all-overish like. But the voice went
on, 'Don't be frightened, Mame Jules, I'm the Opera ghost!' And
the voice was so soft and kind that I hardly felt frightened.
<i>The voice was sitting in the corner chair, on the right, in
the front row</i> ."</p>

<p>"Was there any one in the box on the right of Box Five?" asked
Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"No; Box Seven, and Box Three, the one on the left, were both
empty. The curtain had only just gone up."</p>

<p>"And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Well, I brought the footstool. Of course, it wasn't for
himself he wanted it, but for his lady! But I never heard her nor
saw her."</p>

<p>"Eh? What? So now the ghost is married!" The eyes of the two
managers traveled from Mame Giry to the inspector, who, standing
behind the box-keeper, was waving his arms to attract their
attention. He tapped his forehead with a distressful forefinger,
to convey his opinion that the widow Jules Giry was most
certainly mad, a piece of pantomime which confirmed M. Richard in
his determination to get rid of an inspector who kept a lunatic
in his service. Meanwhile, the worthy lady went on about her
ghost, now painting his generosity:</p>

<p>"At the end of the performance, he always gives me two francs,
sometimes five, sometimes even ten, when he has been many days
without coming. Only, since people have begun to annoy him again,
he gives me nothing at all...."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my good woman," said Moncharmin, while Mame Giry
tossed the feathers in her dingy hat at this persistent
familiarity, "excuse me, how does the ghost manage to give you
your two francs?"</p>

<p>"Why, he leaves them on the little shelf in the box, of
course. I find them with the program, which I always give him.
Some evenings, I find flowers in the box, a rose that must have
dropped from his lady's bodice... for he brings a lady with him
sometimes; one day, they left a fan behind them."</p>

<p>"Oh, the ghost left a fan, did he? And what did you do with
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I brought it back to the box next night."</p>

<p>Here the inspector's voice was raised.</p>

<p>"You've broken the rules; I shall have to fine you, Mame
Giry."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you fool!" muttered M. Firmin Richard.</p>

<p>"You brought back the fan. And then?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, they took it away with them, sir; it was not
there at the end of the performance; and in its place they left
me a box of English sweets, which I'm very fond of. That's one of
the ghost's pretty thoughts."</p>

<p>"That will do, Mame Giry. You can go," When Mame Giry had
bowed herself out, with the dignity that never deserted her, the
manager told the inspector that they had decided to dispense with
that old madwoman's services; and, when he had gone in his turn,
they instructed the acting-manager to make up the inspector's
accounts. Left alone, the managers told each other of the idea
which they both had in mind, which was that they should look into
that little matter of Box Five themselves.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE ENCHANTED VIOLIN</h3>

<p class="first">
CHRISTINE DAAÉ, owing to intrigues to which I will return
later, did not immediately continue her triumph at the Opera.
After the famous gala night, she sang once at the Duchess de
Zurich's; but this was the last occasion on which she was heard
in private. She refused, without plausible excuse, to appear at a
charity concert to which she had promised her assistance. She
acted throughout as though she were no longer the mistress of her
own destiny and as though she feared a fresh triumph.</p>

<p>She knew that the Comte de Chagny, to please his brother, had
done his best on her behalf with M. Richard; and she wrote to
thank him and also to ask him to cease speaking in her favor. Her
reason for this curious attitude was never known. Some pretended
that it was due to overweening pride; others spoke of her
heavenly modesty. But people on the stage are not so modest as
all that; and I think that I shall not be far from the truth if I
ascribe her action simply to fear. Yes, I believe that Christine
Daaé was frightened by what had happened to her. I have a letter
of Christine's (it forms part of the Persian's collection),
relating to this period, which suggests a feeling of absolute
dismay:</p>

<p><i>"I don't know myself when I sing,"</i> writes the poor
child.</p>

<p>She showed herself nowhere; and the Vicomte de Chagny tried in
vain to meet her. He wrote to her, asking to call upon her, but
despaired of receiving a reply when, one morning, she sent him
the following note:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Monsieur</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">
I have not forgotten the little boy who went into the sea to
rescue my scarf. I feel that I must write to you to-day, when I
am going to Perros, in fulfilment of a sacred duty. To-morrow is
the anniversary of the death of my poor father, whom you knew and
who was very fond of you. He is buried there, with his violin, in
the graveyard of the little church, at the bottom of the slope
where we used to play as children, beside the road where, when we
were a little bigger, we said good-by for the last time.</p>

<p><br>
The Vicomte de Chagny hurriedly consulted a railway guide,
dressed as quickly as he could, wrote a few lines for his valet
to take to his brother and jumped into a cab which brought him to
the Gare Montparnasse just in time to miss the morning train. He
spent a dismal day in town and did not recover his spirits until
the evening, when he was seated in his compartment in the
Brittany express. He read Christine's note over and over again,
smelling its perfume, recalling the sweet pictures of his
childhood, and spent the rest of that tedious night journey in
feverish dreams that began and ended with Christine Daaé. Day was
breaking when he alighted at Lannion. He hurried to the diligence
for Perros-Guirec. He was the only passenger. He questioned the
driver and learned that, on the evening of the previous day, a
young lady who looked like a Parisian had gene to Perros and put
up at the inn known as the Setting Sun.</p>

<p>The nearer he drew to her, the more fondly he remembered the
story of the little Swedish singer. Most of the details are still
unknown to the public.</p>

<p>There was once, in a little market-town not far from Upsala, a
peasant who lived there with his family, digging the earth during
the week and singing in the choir on Sundays. This peasant had a
little daughter to whom he taught the musical alphabet before she
knew how to read. Daaé's father was a great musician, perhaps
without knowing it. Not a fiddler throughout the length and
breadth of Scandinavia played as he did. His reputation was
widespread and he was always invited to set the couples dancing
at weddings and other festivals. His wife died when Christine was
entering upon her sixth year. Then the father, who cared only for
his daughter and his music, sold his patch of ground and went to
Upsala in search of fame and fortune. He found nothing but
poverty.</p>

<p>He returned to the country, wandering from fair to fair,
strumming his Scandinavian melodies, while his child, who never
left his side, listened to him in ecstasy or sang to his playing.
One day, at Ljimby Fair, Professor Valerius heard them and took
them to Gothenburg. He maintained that the father was the first
violinist in the world and that the daughter had the making of a
great artist. Her education and instruction were provided for.
She made rapid progress and charmed everybody with her
prettiness, her grace of manner and her genuine eagerness to
please.</p>

<p>When Valerius and his wife went to settle in France, they took
Daaé and Christine with them. "Mamma" Valerius treated Christine
as her daughter. As for Daaé, he began to pine away with
homesickness. He never went out of doors in Paris, but lived in a
sort of dream which he kept up with his violin. For hours at a
time, he remained locked up in his bedroom with his daughter,
fiddling and singing, very, very softly. Sometimes Mamma Valerius
would come and listen behind the door, wipe away a tear and go
down-stairs again on tiptoe, sighing for her Scandinavian
skies.</p>

<p>Daaé seemed not to recover his strength until the summer, when
the whole family went to stay at Perros-Guirec, in a far-away
corner of Brittany, where the sea was of the same color as in his
own country. Often he would play his saddest tunes on the beach
and pretend that the sea stopped its roaring to listen to them.
And then he induced Mamma Valerius to indulge a queer whim of
his. At the time of the "pardons," or Breton pilgrimages, the
village festival and dances, he went off with his fiddle, as in
the old days, and was allowed to take his daughter with him for a
week. They gave the smallest hamlets music to last them for a
year and slept at night in a barn, refusing a bed at the inn,
lying close together on the straw, as when they were so poor in
Sweden. At the same time, they were very neatly dressed, made no
collection, refused the halfpence offered them; and the people
around could not understand the conduct of this rustic fiddler,
who tramped the roads with that pretty child who sang like an
angel from Heaven. They followed them from village to
village.</p>

<p>One day, a little boy, who was out with his governess, made
her take a longer walk than he intended, for he could not tear
himself from the little girl whose pure, sweet voice seemed to
bind him to her. They came to the shore of an inlet which is
still called Trestraou, but which now, I believe, harbors a
casino or something of the sort. At that time, there was nothing
but sky and sea and a stretch of golden beach. Only, there was
also a high wind, which blew Christine's scarf out to sea.
Christine gave a cry and put out her arms, but the scarf was
already far on the waves. Then she heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"It's all right, I'll go and fetch your scarf out of the
sea."</p>

<p>And she saw a little boy running fast, in spite of the
outcries and the indignant protests of a worthy lady in black.
The little boy ran into the sea, dressed as he was, and brought
her back her scarf. Boy and scarf were both soaked through. The
lady in black made a great fuss, but Christine laughed merrily
and kissed the little boy, who was none other than the Vicomte
Raoul de Chagny, staying at Lannion with his aunt.</p>

<p>During the season, they saw each other and played together
almost every day. At the aunt's request, seconded by Professor
Valerius, Daaé consented to give the young viscount some violin
lessons. In this way, Raoul learned to love the same airs that
had charmed Christine's childhood. They also both had the same
calm and dreamy little cast of mind. They delighted in stories,
in old Breton legends; and their favorite sport was to go and ask
for them at the cottage-doors, like beggars:</p>

<p>"Ma'am..." or, "Kind gentleman, have you a little story to
tell us, please?"</p>

<p>And it seldom happened that they did not have one "given"
them; for nearly every old Breton grandame has, at least once in
her life, seen the "korrigans" dance by moonlight on the
heather.</p>

<p>But their great treat was, in the twilight, in the great
silence of the evening, after the sun had set in the sea, when
Daaé came and sat down by them on the roadside and, in a low
voice, as though fearing lest he should frighten the ghosts whom
he evoked, told them the legends of the land of the North. And,
the moment he stopped, the children would ask for more.</p>

<p>There was one story that began:</p>

<p>"A king sat in a little boat on one of those deep, still lakes
that open like a bright eye in the midst of the Norwegian
mountains...."</p>

<p>And another:</p>

<p>"Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing. Her hair was
golden as the sun's rays and her soul as clear and blue as her
eyes. She wheedled her mother, was kind to her doll, took great
care of her frock and her little red shoes and her fiddle, but
most of all loved, when she went to sleep, to hear the Angel of
Music...."</p>

<p><br>
While the old man told this story, Raoul looked at Christine's
blue eyes and golden hair; and Christine thought that Lotte was
very lucky to hear the Angel of Music when she went to sleep. The
Angel of Music played a? part in all Daddy Daaé's tales; and he
maintained that every great musician, every great artist received
a visit from the Angel at least once in his life. Sometimes the
Angel leans over their cradle, as happened to Lotte, and that is
how there are little prodigies who play the fiddle at six better
than men at fifty, which, you must admit, is very wonderful.
Sometimes, the Angel comes much later, because the children are
naughty and won't learn their lessons or practise their scales.
And, sometimes, he does not come at all, because the children
have a bad heart or a bad conscience.</p>

<p>No one ever sees the Angel; but he is heard by those who are
meant to hear him. He often comes when they least expect him,
when they are sad and disheartened. Then their ears suddenly
perceive celestial harmonies, a divine voice, which they remember
all their lives. Persons who are visited by the Angel quiver with
a thrill unknown to the rest of mankind. And they can not touch
an instrument, or open their mouths to sing, without producing
sounds that put all other human sounds to shame. Then people who
do not know that the Angel has visited those persons say that
they have genius.</p>

<p>Little Christine asked her father if he had heard the Angel of
Music. But Daddy Daaé shook his head sadly; and then his eyes lit
up, as he said:</p>

<p>"You will hear him one day, my child! When I am in Heaven, I
will send him to you!"</p>

<p>Daddy was beginning to cough at that time. Three years later,
Raoul and Christine met again at Perros. Professor Valerius was
dead, but his widow remained in France with Daddy Daaé and his
daughter, who continued to play the violin and sing, wrapping in
their dream of harmony their kind patroness, who seemed
henceforth to live on music alone. The young man, as he now was,
had come to Perros on the chance of finding them and went
straight to the house in which they used to stay. He first saw
the old man; and then Christine entered, carrying the tea-tray.
She flushed at the sight of Raoul, who went up to her and kissed
her. She asked him a few questions, performed her duties as
hostess prettily, took up the tray again and left the room. Then
she ran into the garden and took refuge on a bench, a prey to
feelings that stirred her young heart for the first time. Raoul
followed her and they talked till the evening, very shyly. They
were quite changed, cautious as two diplomatists, and told each
other things that had nothing to do with their budding
sentiments. When they took leave of each other by the roadside,
Raoul, pressing a kiss on Christine's trembling hand, said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I shall never forget you!"</p>

<p>And he went away regretting his words, for he knew that
Christine could not be the wife of the Vicomte de Chagny.</p>

<p>As for Christine, she tried not to think of him and devoted
herself wholly to her art. She made wonderful progress and those
who heard her prophesied that she would be the greatest singer in
the world. Meanwhile, the father died; and, suddenly, she seemed
to have lost, with him, her voice, her soul and her genius. She
retained just, but only just, enough of this to enter the
<i>conservatoire</i>, where she did not distinguish herself at
all, attending the classes without enthusiasm and taking a prize
only to please old Mamma Valerius, with whom she continued to
live.</p>

<p>The first time that Raoul saw Christine at the Opera, he was
charmed by the girl's beauty and by the sweet images of the past
which it evoked, but was rather surprised at the negative side of
her art. He returned to listen to her. He followed her in the
wings. He waited for her behind a Jacob's ladder. He tried to
attract her attention. More than once, he walked after her to the
door of her box, but she did not see him. She seemed, for that
matter, to see nobody. She was all indifference. Raoul suffered,
for she was very beautiful and he was shy and dared not confess
his love, even to himself. And then came the lightning-flash of
the gala performance: the heavens torn asunder and an angel's
voice heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the utter
capture of his heart.</p>

<p>And then... and then there was that man's voice behind the
door&mdash;"You must love me!"&mdash;and no one in the room.</p>

<p>Why did she laugh when he reminded her of the incident of the
scarf? Why did she not recognize him? And why had she written to
him?</p>

<p>Perros was reached at last. Raoul walked into the smoky
sitting-room of the Setting Sun and at once saw Christine
standing before him, smiling and showing no astonishment.</p>

<p>"So you have come," she said. "I felt that I should find you
here, when I came back from mass. Some one told me so, at the
church."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Raoul, taking her little hand in his.</p>

<p>"Why, my poor father, who is dead."</p>

<p>There was a silence; and then Raoul asked:</p>

<p>"Did your father tell you that I love you, Christine, and that
I can not live without you?"</p>

<p>Christine blushed to the eyes and turned away her head. In a
trembling voice, she said:</p>

<p>"Me? You are dreaming, my friend!"</p>

<p>And she burst out laughing, to put herself in countenance.</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, Christine; I am quite serious," Raoul
answered.</p>

<p>And she replied gravely: "I did not make you come to tell me
such things as that."</p>

<p>"You 'made me come,' Christine; you knew that your letter
would not leave me indignant and that I should hasten to Perros.
How can you have thought that, if you did not think I loved
you?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would remember our games here, as children, in
which my father so often joined. I really don't know what I
thought.... Perhaps I was wrong to write to you.... This
anniversary and your sudden appearance in my room at the Opera,
the other evening, reminded me of the time long past and made me
write to you as the little girl that I then was...."</p>

<p>There was something in Christine's attitude that seemed to
Raoul not natural. He did not feel any hostility in her; far from
it: the distressed affection shining in her eyes told him that.
But why was this affection distressed? That was what he wished to
know and what was irritating him.</p>

<p>"When you saw me in your dressing-room, was that the first
time you noticed me, Christine?"</p>

<p>She was incapable of lying.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I had seen you several times in your
brother's box. And also on the stage."</p>

<p>"I thought so!" said Raoul, compressing his lips. "But then
why, when you saw me in your room, at your feet, reminding you
that I had rescued your scarf from the sea, why did you answer as
though you did not know me and also why did you laugh?"</p>

<p>The tone of these questions was so rough that Christine stared
at Raoul without replying. The young man himself was aghast at
the sudden quarrel which he had dared to raise at the very moment
when he had resolved to speak words of gentleness, love and
submission to Christine. A husband, a lover with all rights,
would talk no differently to a wife, a mistress who had offended
him. But he had gone too far and saw no other way out of the
ridiculous position than to behave odiously.</p>

<p>"You don't answer!" he said angrily and unhappily. "Well, I
will answer for you. It was because there was some one in the
room who was in your way, Christine, some one that you did not
wish to know that you could be interested in any one else!"</p>

<p>"If any one was in my way, my friend," Christine broke in
coldly, "if any one was in my way, that evening, it was yourself,
since I told you to leave the room!"</p>

<p>"Yes, so that you might remain with the other!"</p>

<p>"What are you saying, monsieur?" asked the girl excitedly.
"And to what other do you refer?"</p>

<p>"To the man to whom you said, 'I sing only for you!...
to-night I gave you my soul and I am dead.'"</p>

<p>Christine seized Raoul's arm and clutched it with a strength
which no one would have suspected in so frail a creature.</p>

<p>"Then you were listening behind the door?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because I love you... And I heard everything...."</p>

<p>"You heard what?"</p>

<p>And the young girl, becoming strangely calm, released Raoul's
arm.</p>

<p>"He said to you, 'Christine, you must love me.'"</p>

<p>At these words, a deathly pallor spread over Christine's face,
dark rings formed round her eyes, she staggered and seemed on the
point of swooning. Raoul darted forward, with arms outstretched,
but Christine had overcome her passing faintness and said, in a
low voice:</p>

<p>"Go on! Go on! Tell me all you heard!"</p>

<br>
<a id="pic2"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="fr100120-images/ThePhantomOfTheOpera-1.jpg"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">She staggered, swooning.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>At an utter loss to understand, Raoul answered: "I heard him
reply, when you said you had given him your soul, 'Your soul is a
beautiful thing, child, and I thank you. No emperor ever received
so fair a gift. The angels wept to-night.'"</p>

<p>Christine carried her hand to her heart, a prey to
indescribable emotion. Her eyes stared before her like a
madwoman's. Raoul was terror-stricken. But suddenly Christine's
eyes moistened and two great tears trickled, like two pearls,
down her ivory cheeks.</p>

<p>"Christine!"</p>

<p>"Raoul!"</p>

<p>The young man tried to take her in his arms, but she escaped
and fled in great disorder.</p>

<p>While Christine remained locked in her room, Raoul was at his
wit's end what to do. He refused to breakfast. He was terribly
concerned and bitterly grieved to see the hours, which he had
hoped to find so sweet, slip past without the presence of the
young Swedish girl. Why did she not come to roam with him through
the country where they had so many memories in common? He heard
that she had had a mass said, that morning, for the repose of her
father's soul and spent a long time praying in the little church
and on the fiddler's tomb. Then, as she seemed to have nothing
more to do at Perros and, in fact, was doing nothing there, why
did she not go back to Paris at once?</p>

<p>Raoul walked away, dejectedly, to the graveyard in which the
church stood and was indeed alone among the tombs, reading the
inscriptions; but, when he turned behind the apse, he was
suddenly struck by the dazzling note of the flowers that
straggled over the white ground. They were marvelous red roses
that had blossomed in the morning, in the snow, giving a glimpse
of life among the dead, for death was all around him. It also,
like the flowers, issued from the ground, which had flung back a
number of its corpses. Skeletons and skulls by the hundred were
heaped against the wall of the church, held in position by a wire
that left the whole gruesome stack visible. Dead men's bones,
arranged in rows, like bricks, to form the first course upon
which the walls of the sacristy had been built. The door of the
sacristy opened in the middle of that bony structure, as is often
seen in old Breton churches.</p>

<p>Raoul said a prayer for Daaé and then, painfully impressed by
all those eternal smiles on the mouths of skulls, he climbed the
slope and sat down on the edge of the heath overlooking the sea.
The wind fell with the evening. Raoul was surrounded by icy
darkness, but he did not feel the cold. It was here, he
remembered, that he used to come with little Christine to see the
Korrigans dance at the rising of the moon. He had never seen any,
though his eyes were good, whereas Christine, who was a little
shortsighted, pretended that she had seen many. He smiled at the
thought and then suddenly gave a start. A voice behind him
said:</p>

<p>"Do you think the Korrigans will come this evening?"</p>

<p>It was Christine. He tried to speak. She put her gloved hand
on his mouth.</p>

<p>"Listen, Raoul. I have decided to tell you something serious,
very serious.... Do you remember the legend of the Angel of
Music?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed," he said. "I believe it was here that your
father first told it to us."</p>

<p>"And it was here that he said, 'When I am in Heaven, my child,
I will send him to you.' Well, Raoul, my father is in Heaven, and
I have been visited by the Angel of Music."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it," replied the young man gravely, for it
seemed to him that his friend, in obedience to a pious thought,
was connecting the memory of her father with the brilliancy of
her last triumph.</p>

<p>Christine appeared astonished at the Vicomte de Chagny's
coolness:</p>

<p>"How do you understand it?" she asked, bringing her pale face
so close to his that he might have thought that Christine was
going to give him a kiss; but she only wanted to read his eyes in
spite of the dark.</p>

<p>"I understand," he said, "that no human being can sing as you
sang the other evening without the intervention of some miracle.
No professor on earth can teach you such accents as those. You
have heard the Angel of Music, Christine."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said solemnly, "<i>in my dressing-room</i>. That is
where he comes to give me my lessons daily."</p>

<p>"In your dressing-room?" he echoed stupidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is where I have heard him; and I have not been the
only one to hear him."</p>

<p>"Who else heard him, Christine?"</p>

<p>"You, my friend."</p>

<p>"I? I heard the Angel of Music?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the other evening, it was he who was talking when you
were listening behind the door. It was he who said, 'You must
love me.' But I then thought that I was the only one to hear his
voice. Imagine my astonishment when you told me, this morning,
that you could hear him too."</p>

<p>Raoul burst out laughing. The first rays of the moon came and
shrouded the two young people in their light. Christine turned on
Raoul with a hostile air. Her eyes, usually so gentle, flashed
fire.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at? <i>You</i> think you heard a man's
voice, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well!..." replied the young man, whose ideas began to grow
confused in the face of Christine's determined attitude.</p>

<p>"It's you, Raoul, who say that? You, an old playfellow of my
own! A friend of my father's! But you have changed since those
days. What are you thinking of? I am an honest girl, M. le
Vicomte de Chagny, and I don't lock myself up in my dressing-room
with men's voices. If you had opened the door, you would have
seen that there was nobody in the room!"</p>

<p>"That's true! I did open the door, when you were gone, and I
found no one in the room."</p>

<p>"So you see!... Well?"</p>

<p>The viscount summoned up all his courage.</p>

<p>"Well, Christine, I think that somebody is making game of
you."</p>

<p>She gave a cry and ran away. He ran after her, but, in a tone
of fierce anger, she called out: "Leave me! Leave me!" And she
disappeared.</p>

<p>Raoul returned to the inn feeling very weary, very
low-spirited and very sad. He was told that Christine had gone to
her bedroom saying that she would not be down to dinner. Raoul
dined alone, in a very gloomy mood. Then he went to his room and
tried to read, went to bed and tried to sleep. There was no sound
in the next room.</p>

<p>The hours passed slowly. It was about half-past eleven when he
distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step, in
the room next to his. Then Christine had not gone to bed! Without
troubling for a reason, Raoul dressed, taking care not to make a
sound, and waited. Waited for what? How could he tell? But his
heart thumped in his chest when he heard Christine's door turn
slowly on its hinges. Where could she be going, at this hour,
when every one was fast asleep at Perros? Softly opening the
door, he saw Christine's white form, in the moonlight, slipping
along the passage. She went down the stairs and he leaned over
the baluster above her.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard two voices in rapid conversation. He caught
one sentence: "Don't lose the key."</p>

<p>It was the landlady's voice. The door facing the sea was
opened and locked again. Then all was still.</p>

<p>Raoul ran back to his room and threw back the window.
Christine's white form stood on the deserted quay.</p>

<p>The first floor of the Setting Sun was at no great height and
a tree growing against the wall held out its branches to Raoul's
impatient arms and enabled him to climb down unknown to the
landlady. Her amazement, therefore, was all the greater when, the
next morning, the young man was brought back to her half frozen,
more dead than alive, and when she learned that he had been found
stretched at full length on the steps of the high altar of the
little church. She ran at once to tell Christine, who hurried
down and, with the help of the landlady, did her best to revive
him. He soon opened his eyes and was not long in recovering when
he saw his friend's charming face leaning over him.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, when the tragedy at the Opera compelled the
intervention of the public prosecutor, M. Mifroid, the commissary
of police, examined the Vicomte de Chagny touching the events of
the night at Perros. I quote the questions and answers as given
in the official report pp. 150 <i>et seq</i>.:</p>

<br>

<div class="quote" style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">

<p>Q. "Did Mlle. Daaé not see you come down from your room by the
curious road which you selected?"</p>

<p>R. "No, monsieur, no, although, when walking behind her, I
took no pains to deaden the sound of my footsteps. In fact, I was
anxious that she should turn round and see me. I realized that I
had no excuse for following her and that this way of spying on
her was unworthy of me. But she seemed not to hear me and acted
exactly as though I were not there. She quietly left the quay and
then suddenly walked quickly up the road. The church-clock had
struck a quarter to twelve and I thought that this must have made
her hurry, for she began almost to run and continued hastening
until she came to the church."</p>

<p>Q. "Was the gate open?"</p>

<p>R. "Yes, monsieur, and this surprised me, but did not seem to
surprise Mlle. Daaé."</p>

<p>Q. "Was there no one in the churchyard?"</p>

<p>R. "I did not see any one; and, if there had been, I must have
seen him. The moon was shining on the snow and made the night
quite light."</p>

<p>Q. "Was it possible for any one to hide behind the
tombstones?"</p>

<p>R. "No, monsieur. They were quite small, poor tombstones,
partly hidden under the snow, with their crosses just above the
level of the ground. The only shadows were those of the crosses
and ourselves. The church stood out quite brightly. I never saw
so clear a night. It was very fine and very cold and one could
see everything."</p>

<p>Q. "Are you at all superstitious?"</p>

<p>R. "No, monsieur, I am a practising Catholic."</p>

<p>Q. "In what condition of mind were you?"</p>

<p>R. "Very healthy and peaceful, I assure you. Mlle. Daaé's
curious action in going out at that hour had worried me at first;
but, as soon as I saw her go to the churchyard, I thought that
she meant to fulfil some pious duty on her father's grave and I
considered this so natural that I recovered all my calmness. I
was only surprised that she had not heard me walking behind her,
for my footsteps were quite audible on the hard snow. But she
must have been taken up with her intentions and I resolved not to
disturb her. She knelt down by her father's grave, made the sign
of the cross and began to pray. At that moment, it struck
midnight. At the last stroke, I saw Mlle. Daaé life her eyes to
the sky and stretch out her arms as though in ecstasy. I was
wondering what the reason could be, when I myself raised my head
and everything within me seemed drawn toward the invisible,
<i>which was playing the most perfect music</i>! Christine and I
knew that music; we had heard it as children. But it had never
been executed with such divine art, even by M. Daaé. I remembered
all that Christine had told me of the Angel of Music. The air was
<i>The Resurrection of Lazarus</i>, which old M. Daaé used to
play to us in his hours of melancholy and of faith. If
Christine's Angel had existed, he could not have played better,
that night, on the late musician's violin. When the music
stopped, I seemed to hear a noise from the skulls in the heap of
bones; it was as though they were chuckling and I could not help
shuddering."</p>

<p>Q. "Did it not occur to you that the musician might be hiding
behind that very heap of bones?"</p>

<p>R. "It was the one thought that did occur to me, monsieur, so
much so that I omitted to follow Mlle. Daaé, when she stood up
and walked slowly to the gate. She was so much absorbed just then
that I am not surprised that she did not see me."</p>

<p>Q. "Then what happened that you were found in the morning
lying half-dead on the steps of the high altar?"</p>

<p>R. "First a skull rolled to my feet... then another... then
another.... It was as if I were the mark of that ghastly game of
bowls. And I had an idea that false step must have destroyed the
balance of the structure behind which our musician was concealed.
This surmise seemed to be confirmed when I saw a shadow suddenly
glide along the sacristy wall. I ran up. The shadow had already
pushed open the door and entered the church. But I was quicker
than the shadow and caught hold of a corner of its cloak. At that
moment, we were just in front of the high altar; and the
moonbeams fell straight upon us through the stained-glass windows
of the apse. As I did not let go of the cloak, the shadow turned
round; and I saw a terrible death's head, which darted a look at
me from a pair of scorching eyes. I felt as if I were face to
face with Satan; and, in the presence of this unearthly
apparition, my heart gave way, my courage failed me... and I
remember nothing more until I recovered consciousness at the
Setting Sun."</p>

<h3>A VISIT TO BOX FIVE</h3>

<p class="first">
WE left M. Firmin Richard and M. Armand Moncharmin at the
moment when they were deciding "to look into that little matter
of Box Five."</p>

<p>Leaving behind them the broad staircase which leads from the
lobby outside the managers' offices to the stage and its
dependencies, they crossed the stage, went out by the
subscribers' door and entered the house through the first little
passage on the left. Then they made their way through the front
rows of stalls and looked at Box Five on the grand tier. They
could not see it well, because it was half in darkness and
because great covers were flung over the red velvet of the ledges
of all the boxes.</p>

<p>They were almost alone in the huge, gloomy house; and a great
silence surrounded them. It was the time when most of the
stage-hands go out for a drink. The staff had left the boards for
the moment, leaving a scene half set. A few rays of light, a wan,
sinister light, that seemed to have been stolen from an expiring
luminary, fell through some opening or other upon an old tower
that raised its pasteboard battlements on the stage; everything,
in this deceptive light, adopted a fantastic shape. In the
orchestra stalls, the drugget covering them looked like an angry
sea, whose glaucous waves had been suddenly rendered stationary
by a secret order from the storm phantom, who, as everybody
knows, is called Adamastor. MM. Moncharmin and Richard were the
shipwrecked mariners amid this motionless turmoil of a calico
sea. They made for the left boxes, plowing their way like sailors
who leave their ship and try to struggle to the shore. The eight
great polished columns stood up in the dusk like so many huge
piles supporting the threatening, crumbling, big-bellied cliffs
whose layers were represented by the circular, parallel, waving
lines of the balconies of the grand, first and second tiers of
boxes. At the top, right on top of the cliff, lost in M.
Lenepveu's copper ceiling, figures grinned and grimaced, laughed
and jeered at MM. Richard and Moncharmin's distress. And yet
these figures were usually very serious. Their names were Isis,
Amphitrite, Hebe, Pandora, Psyche, Thetis, Pomona, Daphne,
Clytie, Galatea and Arethusa. Yes, Arethusa herself and Pandora,
whom we all know by her box, looked down upon the two new
managers of the Opera, who ended by clutching at some piece of
wreckage and from there stared silently at Box Five on the grand
tier.</p>

<p>I have said that they were distressed. At least, I presume so.
M. Moncharmin, in any case, admits that he was impressed. To
quote his own words, in his <i>Memoirs</i>:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"This moonshine about the Opera ghost in which, since we first
took over the duties of MM. Poligny and Debienne, we had been so
nicely steeped"&mdash;Moncharmin's style is not always
irreproachable&mdash;"had no doubt ended by blinding my
imaginative and also my visual faculties. It may be that the
exceptional surroundings in which we found ourselves, in the
midst of an incredible silence, impressed us to an unusual
extent. It may be that we were the sport of a kind of
hallucination brought about by the semi-darkness of the
theater and the partial gloom that filled Box Five. At any rate,
I saw and Richard also saw a shape in the box. Richard said
nothing, nor I either. But we spontaneously seized each other's
hand. We stood like that for some minutes, without moving, with
our eyes fixed on the same point; but the figure had disappeared.
Then we went out and, in the lobby, communicated our impressions
to each other and talked about 'the shape.' The misfortune was
that my shape was not in the least like Richard's. I had seen a
thing like a death's head resting on the ledge of the box,
whereas Richard saw the shape of an old woman who looked like
Mame Giry. We soon discovered that we had really been the victims
of an illusion, whereupon, without further delay and laughing
like madmen, we ran to Box Five on the grand tier, went inside
and found no shape of any kind."</p>

<p><br>
Box Five is just like all the other grand tier boxes. There is
nothing to distinguish it from any of the others. M. Moncharmin
and M. Richard, ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each
other, moved the furniture of the box, lifted the cloths and the
chairs and particularly examined the arm-chair in which "the
man's voice" used to sit. But they saw that it was a respectable
arm-chair, with no magic about it. Altogether, the box was the
most ordinary box in the world, with its red hangings, its
chairs, its carpet and its ledge covered in red velvet. After
feeling the carpet in the most serious manner possible, and
discovering nothing more here or anywhere else, they went down to
the corresponding box on the pit tier below. In Box Five on the
pit tier, which is just inside the first exit from the stalls on
the left, they found nothing worth mentioning either.</p>

<p>"Those people are all making fools of us!" Firmin Richard
ended by exclaiming. "It will be <i>Faust</i> on Saturday: let us
both see the performance from Box Five on the grand tier!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FAUST AND WHAT FOLLOWED</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Saturday morning, on reaching their office, the joint
managers found a letter from O.G. worded in these terms:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">My Dear Managers:</span></p>

<p class="letter">
So it is to be war between us? If you still care for peace,
here is my ultimatum. It consists of the four following
conditions:</p>

<p class="letter">
1. You must give me back my private box; and I wish it to be
at my free disposal from henceforward.</p>

<p class="letter">
2. The part of Margarita shall be sung this evening by
Christine Daaé. Never mind about Carlotta; she will be ill.</p>

<p class="letter">
3. I absolutely insist upon the good and loyal services of
Mme. Giry, my box-keeper, whom you will reinstate in her
functions forthwith.</p>

<p class="letter">
4. Let me know by a letter handed to Mme. Giry, who will see
that it reaches me, that you accept, as your predecessors did,
the conditions in my memorandum-book relating to my monthly
allowance. I will inform you later how you are to pay it to
me.</p>

<p class="letter">
If you refuse, you will give "Faust" to-night in a house
with a curse upon it.</p>

<p class="letter">Take my advice and be warned in time.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">O.G.</span></p>

<br>

<p>"Look here, I'm getting sick of him, sick of him!" shouted
Richard, bringing his fists down on his office-table.</p>

<p>Just then, Mercier, the acting-manager, entered.</p>

<p>"Lachenel would like to see one of you gentlemen," he said.
"He says that his business is urgent and he seems quite
upset."</p>

<p>"Who's Lachenel?" asked Richard.</p>

<p>"He's your stud-groom."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? My stud-groom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," explained Mercier, "there are several grooms at
the Opera and M. Lachenel is at the head of them."</p>

<p>"And what does this groom do?"</p>

<p>"He has the chief management of the stable."</p>

<p>"What stable?"</p>

<p>"Why, yours, sir, the stable of the Opera."</p>

<p>"Is there a stable at the Opera? Upon my word, I didn't
<i>know</i>. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the cellars, on the Rotunda side. It's a very important
department; we have twelve horses."</p>

<p>"Twelve horses! And what for, in Heaven's name?"</p>

<p>"Why, we want trained horses for the processions in the
<i>Juive</i>, the <i>Profeta</i> and so on; horses 'used to the
boards.' It is the grooms' business to teach them. M. Lachenel is
very clever at it. He used to manage Franconi's stables."</p>

<p>"Very well... but what does he want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I never saw him in such a state."</p>

<p>"He can come in."</p>

<p>M. Lachenel came in, carrying a riding-whip, with which he
struck his right boot in an irritable manner.</p>

<p>"Good morning, M. Lachenel," said Richard, somewhat impressed.
"To what do we owe the honor of your visit?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Manager, I have come to ask you to get rid of the whole
stable."</p>

<p>"What, you want to get rid of our horses?"</p>

<p>"I'm not talking of the horses, but of the stablemen."</p>

<p>"How many stablemen have you, M. Lachenel?"</p>

<p>"Six."</p>

<p>"Six stablemen! That's at least two too many."</p>

<p>"These are 'places,'" Mercier interposed, "created and forced
upon us by the under-secretary for fine arts. They are filled by
protégées of the government and, if I may venture to...,"</p>

<p>"I don't care a hang for the government!" roared Richard. "We
don't need more than four stablemen for twelve horses."</p>

<p>"Eleven," said the head riding-master, correcting him.</p>

<p>"Twelve," repeated Richard.</p>

<p>"Eleven," repeated Lachenel.</p>

<p>"Oh, the acting-manager told me that you had twelve
horses!"</p>

<p>"I did have twelve, but I have only eleven since César was
stolen."</p>

<p>And M. Lachenel gave himself a great smack on the boot with
his whip.</p>

<p>"Has César been stolen?" cried the acting-manager. "César, the
white horse in the <i>Profeta</i>?"</p>

<p>"There are not two Césars," said the stud-groom dryly. "I was
ten years at Franconi's and I have seen plenty of horses in my
time. Well, there are not two Césars. And he's been stolen."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Nobody knows. That's why I have come to ask you
to sack the whole stable."</p>

<p>"What do your stablemen say?"</p>

<p>"All sorts of nonsense. Some of them accuse the supers. Others
pretend that it's the acting-manager's doorkeeper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My doorkeeper? I'll answer for him as I would for myself!"
protested Mercier.</p>

<p>"But, after all, M. Lachenel," cried Richard, "you must have
some idea."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," M. Lachenel declared. "I have an idea and I'll
tell you what it is. There's no doubt about it in my mind." He
walked up to the two managers and whispered. "It's the ghost who
did the trick!"</p>

<p>Richard gave a jump.</p>

<p>"What, you too! You too!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean, I too? Isn't it natural, after what I
saw?"</p>

<p>"What did you see?"</p>

<p>"I saw, as clearly as I now see you, a black shadow riding a
white horse that was as like César as two peas!"</p>

<p>"And did you run after them?"</p>

<p>"I did and I shouted, but they were too fast for me and
disappeared in the darkness of the underground gallery."</p>

<p>M. Richard rose. "That will do, M. Lachenel. You can go.... We
will lodge a complaint against <i>the ghost</i>."</p>

<p>"And sack my stable?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course! Good morning."</p>

<p>M. Lachenel bowed and withdrew. Richard foamed at the
mouth.</p>

<p>"Settle that idiot's account at once, please."</p>

<p>"He is a friend of the government representative's!" Mercier
ventured to say.</p>

<p>"And he takes his vermouth at Tortoni's with Lagrene, Scholl
and Pertuiset, the lion-hunter," added Moncharmin. "We shall have
the whole press against us! He'll tell the story of the ghost;
and everybody will be laughing at our expense! We may as well be
dead as ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"All right, say no more about it."</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened. It must have been deserted by
its usual Cerberus, for Mame Giry entered without ceremony,
holding a letter in her hand, and said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, excuse me, gentlemen, but I had a letter
this morning from the Opera ghost. He told me to come to you,
that you had something to...."</p>

<p>She did not complete the sentence. She saw Firmin Richard's
face; and it was a terrible sight. He seemed ready to burst. He
said nothing, he could not speak. But suddenly he acted. First,
his left arm seized upon the quaint person of Mame Giry and made
her describe so unexpected a semicircle that she uttered a
despairing cry. Next, his right foot imprinted its sole on the
black taffeta of a skirt which certainly had never before
undergone a similar outrage in a similar place. The thing
happened so quickly that Mame Giry, when in the passage, was
still quite bewildered and seemed not to understand. But,
suddenly, she understood; and the Opera rang with her indignant
yells, her violent protests and threats.</p>

<p>About the same time, Carlotta, who had a small house of her
own in the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore, rang for her maid, who
brought her letters to her bed. Among them was an anonymous
missive, written in red ink, in a hesitating, clumsy hand, which
ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">If you appear to-night, you must be prepared
for a great misfortune at the moment when you open your mouth to
sing&mdash;a misfortune worse than death.</p>

<p><br>
The letter took away Carlotta's appetite for breakfast. She
pushed back her chocolate, sat up in bed and thought hard. It was
not the first letter of the kind which she had received, but she
never had one couched in such threatening terms.</p>

<p>She thought herself, at that time, the victim of a thousand
jealous attempts and went about saying that she had a secret
enemy who had sworn to ruin her. She pretended that a wicked plot
was being hatched against her, a cabal which would come to a head
one of those days; but she added that she was not the woman to be
intimidated.</p>

<p>The truth is that, if there was a cabal, it was led by
Carlotta herself against poor Christine, who had no suspicion of
it. Carlotta had never forgiven Christine for the triumph which
she had achieved when taking her place at a moment's notice. When
Carlotta heard of the astounding reception bestowed upon her
understudy, she was at once cured of an incipient attack of
bronchitis and a bad fit of sulking against the management and
lost the slightest inclination to shirk her duties. From that
time, she worked with all her might to "smother" her rival,
enlisting the services of influential friends to persuade the
managers not to give Christine an opportunity for a fresh
triumph. Certain newspapers which had begun to extol the talent
of Christine now interested themselves only in the fame of
Carlotta. Lastly, in the theater itself, the celebrated, but
heartless and soulless diva made the most scandalous remarks
about Christine and tried to cause her endless minor
unpleasantnesses.</p>

<p>When Carlotta had finished thinking over the threat contained
in the strange letter, she got up.</p>

<p>"We shall see," she said, adding a few oaths in her native
Spanish with a very determined air.</p>

<p>The first thing she saw, when looking out of her window, was a
hearse. She was very superstitious; and the hearse and the letter
convinced her that she was running the most serious dangers that
evening. She collected all her supporters, told them that she was
threatened at that evening's performance with a plot organized by
Christine Daaé and declared that they must play a trick upon that
chit by filling the house with her, Carlotta's, admirers. She had
no lack of them, had she? She relied upon them to hold themselves
prepared for any eventuality and to silence the adversaries, if,
as she feared, they created a disturbance.</p>

<p>M. Richard's private secretary called to ask after the diva's
health and returned with the assurance that she was perfectly
well and that, "were she dying," she would sing the part of
Margarita that evening. The secretary urged her, in his chief's
name, to commit no imprudence, to stay at home all day and to be
careful of drafts; and Carlotta could not help, after he had
gone, comparing this unusual and unexpected advice with the
threats contained in the letter.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock when the post brought a second anonymous
letter in the same hand as the first. It was short and said
simply:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">You have a bad cold. If you are wise, you will
see that it is madness to try to sing to-night.</p>

<p><br>
Carlotta sneered, shrugged her handsome shoulders and sang two
or three notes to reassure herself.</p>

<p>Her friends were faithful to their promise. They were all at
the Opera that night, but looked round in vain for the fierce
conspirators whom they were instructed to suppress. The only
unusual thing was the presence of M. Richard and M. Moncharmin in
Box Five. Carlotta's friends thought that, perhaps, the managers
had wind, on their side, of the proposed disturbance and that
they had determined to be in the house, so as to stop it then and
there; but this was unjustifiable supposition, as the reader
knows. M. Richard and M. Moncharmin were thinking of nothing but
their ghost.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Vain! In vain do I call, through my vigil weary,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On creation and its Lord!<br>
Never reply will break the silence dreary!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;No sign! No single word!"</p>

<p><br>
The famous baritone, Carolus Fonta, had hardly finished Doctor
Faust's first appeal to the powers of darkness, when M. Firmin
Richard, who was sitting in the ghost's own chair, the front
chair on the right, leaned over to his partner and asked him
chaffingly:</p>

<p>"Well, has the ghost whispered a word in your ear yet?"</p>

<p>"Wait, don't be in such a hurry," replied M. Armand
Moncharmin, in the same gay tone. "The performance has only begun
and you know that the ghost does not usually come until the
middle of the first act."</p>

<p>The first act passed without incident, which did not surprise
Carlotta's friends, because Margarita does not sing in this act.
As for the managers, they looked at each other, when the curtain
fell.</p>

<p>"That's one!" said Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"Yes, the ghost is late," said Firmin Richard.</p>

<p>"It's not a bad house," said Moncharmin, "for 'a house with a
curse on it.'"</p>

<p>M. Richard smiled and pointed to a fat, rather vulgar woman,
dressed in black, sitting in a stall in the middle of the
auditorium with a man in a broadcloth frock-coat on either side
of her.</p>

<p>"Who on earth are 'those?'" asked Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"'Those', my dear fellow, are my concierge, her husband and
her brother."</p>

<p>"Did you give them their tickets?"</p>

<p>"I did.... My concierge had never been to the Opera&mdash;this
is the first time&mdash;and, as she is now going to come every
night, I wanted her to have a good seat, before spending her time
showing other people to theirs."</p>

<p>Moncharmin asked what he meant and Richard answered that he
had persuaded his concierge, in whom he had the greatest
confidence, to come and take Mame Giry's place. Yes, he would
like to see if, with that woman instead of the old lunatic, Box
Five would continue to astonish the natives?</p>

<p>"By the way," said Moncharmin, "you know that Mother Giry is
going to lodge a complaint against you."</p>

<p>"With whom? The ghost?"</p>

<p>The ghost! Moncharmin had almost forgotten him. However, that
mysterious person did nothing to bring himself to the memory of
the managers; and they were just saying so to each other for the
second time, when the door of the box suddenly opened to admit
the startled stage-manager.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" they both asked, amazed at seeing him
there at such a time.</p>

<p>"It seems there's a plot got up by Christine Daaé's friends
against Carlotta. Carlotta's furious."</p>

<p>"What on earth...?" said Richard, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>But the curtain rose on the kermess scene and Richard made a
sign to the stage-manager to go away. When the two were alone
again, Moncharmin leaned over to Richard:</p>

<p>"Then Daaé has friends?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, she has."</p>

<p>"Whom?"</p>

<p>Richard glanced across at a box on the grand tier containing
no one but two men. "The Comte de Chagny?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he spoke to me in her favor with such warmth that, if I
had not known him to be Sorelli's friend..."</p>

<p>"Really? Really?" said Moncharmin. "And who is that pale young
man beside him?"</p>

<p>"That's his brother, the viscount."</p>

<p>"He ought to be in his bed. He looks ill."</p>

<p>The stage rang with gay song:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Red or white liquor,<br>
&emsp;Coarse or fine!<br>
What can it matter,<br>
&emsp;So we have wine?"</p>

<p><br>
Students, citizens, soldiers, girls and matrons whirled
light-heartedly before the inn with the figure of Bacchus for a
sign. Siebel made her entrance. Christine Daaé looked charming in
her boy's clothes; and Carlotta's partisans expected to hear her
greeted with an ovation which would have enlightened them as to
the intentions of her friends. But nothing happened.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when Margarita crossed the stage and sang
the only two lines allotted her in this second act:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"No, my lord, not a lady am I, nor yet a beauty,<br>
And do not need an arm to help me on my way."</p>

<p><br>
Carlotta was received with enthusiastic applause. It was so
unexpected and so uncalled for that those who knew nothing about
the rumors looked at one another and asked what was happening.
And this act also was finished without incident.</p>

<p>Then everybody said: "Of course, it will be during the next
act."</p>

<p>Some, who seemed to be better informed than the rest, declared
that the "row" would begin with the ballad of the <i>King of
Thule</i> and rushed to the subscribers' entrance to warn
Carlotta. The managers left the box during the entr'acte to find
out more about the cabal of which the stage-manager had spoken;
but they soon returned to their seats, shrugging their shoulders
and treating the whole affair as silly.</p>

<p>The first thing they saw, on entering the box, was a box of
English sweets on the little shelf of the ledge. Who had put it
there? They asked the box-keepers, but none of them knew. Then
they went back to the shelf and, next to the box of sweets, found
an opera glass. They looked at each other. They had no
inclination to laugh. All that Mme. Giry had told them returned
to their memory... and then... and then... they seemed to feel a
curious sort of draft around them.... They sat down in
silence.</p>

<p>The scene represented Margarita's garden:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Gentle flow'rs in the dew,<br>
&emsp;Be message from me...."</p>

<p><br>
As she sang these first two lines, with her bunch of roses and
lilacs in her hand, Christine, raising her head, saw the Vicomte
de Chagny in his box; and, from that moment, her voice seemed
less sure, less crystal-clear than usual. Something seemed to
deaden and dull her singing.</p>

<p>"What a queer girl she is!" said one of Carlotta's friends in
the stalls, almost aloud. "The other day she was divine; and
to-night she's simply bleating. She has no experience, no
training."</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Gentle flow'rs, lie ye there<br>
&emsp;And tell her from me...."</p>

<p><br>
The viscount put his head under his hands and wept. The count,
behind him, viciously gnawed his mustache, shrugged his shoulders
and frowned. For him, usually so cold and correct, to betray his
inner feelings like that, by outward signs, the count must be
very angry. He was. He had seen his brother return from a rapid
and mysterious journey in an alarming state of health. The
explanation that followed was unsatisfactory and the count asked
Christine Daaé for an appointment. She had the audacity to reply
that she could not see either him or his brother....</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Would she but deign to hear me<br>
And with one smile to cheer me...."</p>

<br>

<p>"The little baggage!" growled the count.</p>

<p>And he wondered what she wanted. What she was hoping for....
She was a virtuous girl, she was said to have no friend, no
protector of any sort.... That angel from the North must be very
artful!</p>

<p>Raoul, behind the curtain of his hands that veiled his boyish
tears, thought only of the letter which he received on his return
to Paris, where Christine, fleeing from Perros like a thief in
the night, had arrived before him:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Little Playfellow</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">
You must have the courage not to see me again, not to speak of
me again. If you love me just a little, do this for me, for me
who will never forget you, my dear Raoul. My life depends upon
it. Your life depends upon it.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Your Little Christine.</span></p>

<br>

<p>Thunders of applause. Carlotta made her entrance.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"I wish I could but know who was he<br>
That addressed me,<br>
If he was noble, or, at least, what his name...."</p>

<p><br>
When Margarita had finished singing the ballad of the <i>King
of Thule</i>, she was loudly cheered and again when she came to
the end of the jewel song:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Ah, the joy of past compare<br>
These jewels bright to wear!...</p>

<p><br>
Thenceforth, certain of herself, certain of her friends in the
house, certain of her voice and her success, fearing nothing,
Carlotta flung herself into her part without restraint of
modesty.... She was no longer Margarita, she was Carmen. She was
applauded all the more; and her debut with Faust seemed about to
bring her a new success, when suddenly... a terrible thing
happened.</p>

<p>Faust had knelt on one knee:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Let me gaze on the form below me,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;While from yonder ether blue<br>
Look how the star of eve, bright and tender, lingers o'er
me,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To love thy beauty too!"</p>

<br>

<p>And Margarita replied:</p>

<br>


<p class="verse">
"Oh, how strange!<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Like a spell does the evening bind me!<br>
And a deep languid charm<br>
&emsp;&emsp;I feel without alarm<br>
With its melody enwind me<br>
&emsp;&emsp;And all my heart subdue."</p>

<br>

<p>At that moment, at that identical moment, the terrible thing
happened.... Carlotta croaked like a toad:</p>

<p>"Co-ack!"</p>

<p>There was consternation on Carlotta's face and consternation
on the faces of all the audience. The two managers in their box
could not suppress an exclamation of horror. Every one felt that
the thing was not natural, that there was witchcraft behind it.
That toad smelt of brimstone. Poor, wretched, despairing, crushed
Carlotta!</p>

<p>The uproar in the house was indescribable. If the thing had
happened to any one but Carlotta, she would have been hooted. But
everybody knew how perfect an instrument her voice was; and there
was no display of anger, but only of horror and dismay, the sort
of dismay which men would have felt if they had witnessed the
catastrophe that broke the arms of the Venus de Milo.... And even
then they would have seen... and understood....</p>

<p>But here that toad was incomprehensible! So much so that,
after some seconds spent in asking herself if she had really
heard that note, that sound, that infernal noise issue from her
throat, she tried to persuade herself that it was not so, that
she was the victim of an illusion, an illusion of the ear, and
not of an act of treachery on the part of her voice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Box Five, Moncharmin and Richard had turned very
pale. This extraordinary and inexplicable incident filled them
with a dread which was the more mysterious inasmuch as for some
little while, they had fallen within the direct influence of the
ghost.</p>

<p>They had felt his breath. Moncharmin's hair stood on end.
Richard wiped the perspiration from his forehead. Yes, the ghost
was there, around them, behind them, beside them; they felt his
presence without seeing him, they heard his breath, close, close,
close to them!... They were sure that there were three people in
the box.... They trembled.... They thought of running away....
They dared not.... They dared not make a movement or exchange a
word that would have told the ghost that they knew that he was
there!... What was going to happen?</p>

<p>This happened.</p>

<p>"Co-ack!"</p>

<p>Their joint exclamation of horror was heard all over the
house. <i>They felt that they were smarting under the ghost's
attacks</i>. Leaning over the ledge of their box, they stared at
Carlotta as though they did not recognize her. That infernal girl
must have given the signal for some catastrophe. Ah, they were
waiting for the catastrophe! The ghost had told them it would
come! The house had a curse upon it! The two managers gasped and
panted under the weight of the catastrophe. Richard's stifled
voice was heard calling to Carlotta: "Well, go on!"</p>

<p>No, Carlotta did not go on.... Bravely, heroically, she
started afresh on the fatal line at the end of which the toad had
appeared.</p>

<p>An awful silence succeeded the uproar. Carlotta's voice alone
once more filled the resounding house:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"I feel without alarm...."</p>

<br>

<p>The audience also felt, but not without alarm....</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"I feel without alarm....<br>
I feel without alarm&mdash;co-ack!<br>
With its melody enwind me&mdash;co-ack!<br>
And all my heart sub&mdash;co-ack!"</p>

<br>

<p>The toad also had started afresh!</p>

<p>The house broke into a wild tumult. The two managers collapsed
in their chairs and dared not even turn round; they had not the
strength; the ghost%was chuckling behind their backs! And, at
last, they distinctly heard his voice in their right ears, the
impossible voice, the mouthless voice, saying:</p>

<p><i>"She is singing to-night to bring the chandelier
down!"</i></p>

<p>With one accord, they raised their eyes to the ceiling and
uttered a terrible cry. The chandelier, the immense mass of the
chandelier was slipping down, coming toward them, at the call of
that fiendish voice. Released from its hook, it plunged from the
ceiling and came smashing into the middle of the stalls, amid a
thousand shouts of terror. A wild rush for the doors
followed.</p>

<p>The papers of the day state that there were numbers wounded
and one killed. The chandelier had crashed down upon the head of
the wretched woman who had come to the Opera for the first time
in her life, the one whom M. Richard had appointed to succeed
Mame Giry, the ghost's box-keeper, in her functions! She died on
the spot and, the next morning, a newspaper appeared with this
heading:</p>

<br>

<p class="headline">Two Hundred Kilos On The Head Of A Concierge</p>

<br>

<p>That was her sole epitaph!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS BROUGHAM</h3>

<p class="first">
THAT tragic evening was bad for everybody. Carlotta fell ill.
As for Christine Daaé, she disappeared after the performance. A
fortnight elapsed during which she was seen neither at the Opera
nor outside.</p>

<p>Raoul, of course, was the first to be astonished at the prima
donna's absence. He wrote to her at Mme. Valerius' flat and
received no reply. His grief increased and he ended by being
seriously alarmed at never seeing her name on the program.
<i>Faust</i> was played without her.</p>

<p>One afternoon he went to the managers' office to ask the
reason of Christine's disappearance. He found them both looking
extremely worried. Their own friends did not recognize them: they
had lost all their gaiety and spirits. They were seen crossing
the stage with hanging heads, care-worn brows, pale cheeks, as
though pursued by some abominable thought or a prey to some
persistent sport of fate.</p>

<p>The fall of the chandelier had involved them in no little
responsibility; but it was difficult to make them speak about it.
The inquest had ended in a verdict of accidental death, caused by
the wear and tear of the chains by which the chandelier was hung
from the ceiling; but it was the duty of both the old and the new
managers to have discovered this wear and tear and to have
remedied it in time. And I feel bound to say that MM. Richard and
Moncharmin at this time appeared so changed, so absent-minded, so
mysterious, so incomprehensible that many of the subscribers
thought that some event even more horrible ' than the fall of the
chandelier must have affected their state of mind.</p>

<p>In their daily intercourse, they showed themselves very
impatient, except with Mine. Giry, who had been reinstated in her
functions. And their reception of the Vicomte de Chagny, when he
came to ask about Christine, was anything but cordial. They
merely told him that she was taking a holiday. He asked how long
the holiday was for, and they replied curtly that it was for an
unlimited period, as Mlle. Daaé had requested leave of absence
for reasons of health.</p>

<p>"Then she is ill!" he cried. "What is the matter with
her?"</p>

<p>"We don't know."</p>

<p>"Didn't you send the doctor of the Opera to see her?"</p>

<p>"No, she did not ask for him; and, as we trust her, we took
her word."</p>

<p>Raoul left the building a prey to the gloomiest thoughts. He
resolved, come what might, to go and inquire of Mamma Valerius.
He remembered the strong phrases in Christine's letter,
forbidding him to make any attempt to see her. But what he had
seen at Perros, what he had heard behind the dressing-room door,
his conversation with Christine at the edge of the moor made him
suspect some machination which, devilish though it might be, was
none the less human. The girl's highly strung imagination, her
affectionate and credulous mind, the primitive education which
had surrounded her childhood with a circle of legends, the
constant brooding over her dead father and, above all, the state
of sublime ecstasy into which music threw her from the moment
that this art was made manifest to her in certain exceptional
conditions, as in the churchyard at Perros; all this seemed to
him to constitute a moral ground only too favorable for the
malevolent designs of some mysterious and unscrupulous person. Of
whom was Christine Daaé the victim? This was the very reasonable
question which Raoul put to himself as he hurried off to Mamma
Valerius.</p>

<p>He trembled as he rang at a little flat in the Rue
Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. The door was opened by the maid whom he
had seen coming out of Christine's dressing-room one evening. He
asked if he could speak to Mme. Valerius. He was told that she
was ill in bed and was not receiving visitors.</p>

<p>"Take in my card, please," he said.</p>

<p>The maid soon returned and showed him into a small and
scantily furnished drawing-room, in which portraits of Professor
Valerius and old Daaé hung on opposite walls.</p>

<p>"Madame begs <i>monsieur le vicomte</i> to excuse her," said
the servant. "She can only see him in her bedroom, because she
can no longer stand on her poor legs."</p>

<p></p>

<p>Five minutes later, Raoul was ushered into an ill-lit room
where he at once recognized the good, kind face of Christine's
benefactress in the semi-darkness of an alcove. Mamma Valerius'
hair was now quite white, but her eyes had grown no older; never,
on the contrary, had their expression been so bright, so pure, so
child-like.</p>

<p>"M. de Chagny!" she cried gaily, putting out both her hands to
her visitor. "Ah, it's Heaven that sends you here!... We can talk
of <i>her</i> ."</p>

<p>This last sentence sounded very gloomily in the young man's
ears. He at once asked:</p>

<p>"Madame... where is Christine?"</p>

<p>And the old lady replied calmly:</p>

<p>"She is with her good genius!"</p>

<p>"What good genius?" exclaimed poor Raoul.</p>

<p>"Why, the Angel of Music!"</p>

<p>The viscount dropped into a chair. Really? Christine was with
the Angel of Music? And there lay Mamma Valerius in bed, smiling
to him and putting her finger to her lips, to warn him to be
silent! And she added:</p>

<p>"You must not tell anybody!"</p>

<p>"You can rely on me," said Raoul.</p>

<p>He hardly knew what he was saying, for his ideas about
Christine, already greatly confused, were becoming more and more
entangled; and it seemed as if everything was beginning to turn
around him, around the room, around that extraordinary good lady
with the white hair and forget-me-not eyes.</p>

<p>"I know! I know I can!" she said, with a happy
laugh. "But why don't you come near me, as you used to do when
you were a little boy? Give me your hands, as when you brought me
the story of little Lotte, which Daddy Daaé had told you. I am
very fond of you, M. Raoul, you know. And so is Christine
too!"</p>

<p>"She is fond of me!" sighed the young man. He found a
difficulty in collecting his thoughts and bringing them to bear
on Mamma Valerius' "good genius," on the Angel of Music of whom
Christine had spoken to him so strangely, on the death's head
which he had seen in a sort of nightmare on the high altar at
Perros and also on the Opera ghost, whose fame had come to his
ears one evening when he was standing behind the scenes, within
hearing of a group of scene-shifters who were repeating the
ghastly description which the hanged man, Joseph Buquet, had
given of the ghost before his mysterious death.</p>

<p>He asked in a low voice: "What makes you think that Christine
is fond of me, madame?"</p>

<p>"She used to speak of you every day."</p>

<p>"Really?... And what did she tell you?"</p>

<p>"She told me that you had made her a proposal!"</p>

<p>And the good old lady began laughing wholeheartedly. Raoul
sprang from his chair, flushing to the temples, suffering
agonies.</p>

<p>"What's this? Where are you going?... Sit down again at once,
will you?... Do you think I will let you go like that?... If
you're angry with me for laughing, I beg your pardon. After all,
what has happened isn't your fault.... Didn't you know?... Did
you think that Christine was free?..."</p>

<p>"Is Christine engaged to be married?" the wretched Raoul
asked, in a choking voice.</p>

<p>"Why no! Why no!... You know as well as I do that Christine
couldn't marry, even if she wanted to!..."</p>

<p>"But I don't know anything about it!... And why can't
Christine marry?"</p>

<p>"Because of the Angel of Music, of course!..."</p>

<p>"I don't follow...."</p>

<p>"Yes, he forbids her to!"</p>

<p>"He forbids her!... The Angel of Music forbids her to
marry!?</p>

<p>"Oh, he forbids her... without forbidding her. It's like this:
he tells her that, if she got married, she would never hear him
again. That's ail! And that he would go away for ever! So, you
understand, she can't let the Angel of Music go. It's quite
natural."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," echoed Raoul submissively, "it's quite
natural."</p>

<p>"Besides, I thought Christine had told you all that, when she
met you at Perros, where she went with her 'good genius'."</p>

<p>"Oh, she went to Perros with her good genius, did she?"</p>

<p>"That is to say, he arranged to meet her down there, in Perros
churchyard, at Daaé's grave. He promised to play her <i>The
Resurrection of Lazarus</i> on her father's violin!"</p>

<p>Raoul de Chagny rose and, with a very authoritative air,
pronounced these peremptory words:</p>

<p>"Madame, you will have the goodness to tell me where that
genius lives."</p>

<p>The old lady did not seem surprised at this indiscreet
command. She raised her eyes and said:</p>

<p>"In Heaven!"</p>

<p>Such simplicity baffled him. He did not know what to say in
the presence of this candid and perfect faith in a genius who
came down nightly from Heaven to haunt the dressing-rooms at the
Opera.</p>

<p>He now realized the possible state of mind of a girl brought
up between a superstitious fiddler and a visionary old lady and
he shuddered when he thought of the consequences of it all.</p>

<p>"Is Christine still a good girl?" he asked suddenly, in spite
of himself.</p>

<p>"I swear it, as I hope to be saved!" exclaimed the old woman,
who, this time, seemed to be incensed. "And, if you doubt it,
sir, I don't know what you are here for!"</p>

<p>Raoul tore at his gloves.</p>

<p>"How long has she known this 'genius?'"</p>

<p>"About three months.... Yes, it's quite three months since he
began to give her lessons."</p>

<p>The viscount threw up his arms with a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>"The genius gives her lessons!... And where, pray?"</p>

<p>"Now that she has gone away with him, I can't gay; but, up to
a fortnight ago, it was in Christine's dressing-room. It would be
impossible in this little flat. The whole house would hear them.
Whereas, at the Opera, at eight o'clock in the morning, there is
no one about, do you see!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I see! I see!" cried the viscount.</p>

<p>And he hurriedly took leave of Mme. Valerius, who asked
herself if the young nobleman was not a little off his head.</p>

<p>He walked home to his brother's house in a pitiful state. He
could have struck himself, banged his head against the walls! To
think that he had believed in her innocence, in her purity! The
Angel of Music! He knew him now! He saw him! It was beyond a
doubt some unspeakable tenor, a good-looking jackanapes, who
mouthed and simpered as he sang! He thought himself as absurd and
as wretched as could be. Oh, what a miserable, little,
insignificant, silly young man was M. le Vicomte de Chagny!
thought Raoul furiously. And she, what a bold and damnable sly
creature!</p>

<p>His brother was waiting for him and Raoul fell into his arms,
like a child. The count consoled him, without asking for
explanations; and Raoul would <i>I</i> certainly have long
hesitated before telling him the > story of the Angel of Music.
His brother suggested taking him out to dinner. Overcome as he
was with despair, Raoul would probably have refused any
invitation that evening, if the count had not, as an inducement,
told him that the lady of his thoughts had been seen, the night
before, in company of the other sex in the Bois. At first, the
viscount refused to believe; but he received such exact details
that he ceased protesting. She had been seen, it appeared,
driving in a brougham, with the window down. She seemed to be
slowly taking in the icy night air. There was a glorious moon
shining. She was recognized beyond a doubt. As for her companion,
only his shadowy outline was distinguished leaning back in the
dark. The carriage was going at a walking pace in a lonely drive
behind the grandstand at Longchamp.</p>

<p>Raoul dressed in frantic haste, prepared to forget his
distress by flinging himself, as people say, into "the vortex of
pleasure." Alas, he was a very sorry guest and, leaving his
brother early, found himself, by ten o'clock in the evening, in a
cab, behind the Long-champ race-course.</p>

<p>It was bitterly cold. The road seemed deserted and very bright
under the moonlight. He told the driver to wait for him patiently
at the corner of a near turning and, hiding himself as well as he
could, stood stamping his feet to keep warm. He had been
indulging in this healthy exercise for half an hour or so, when a
carriage turned the corner of the road and came quietly in his
direction, at a walking pace.</p>

<p>As it approached, he saw that a woman was leaning her head
from the window. And, suddenly, the moon shed a pale gleam over
her features.</p>

<p>"Christine!"</p>

<p>The sacred name of his love had sprung from his heart and his
lips. He could not keep it back. He would have given anything to
withdraw it, for that name, proclaimed in the stillness of the
night, had acted as though it were the preconcerted signal for a
furious rush on the part of the whole turn-out, which dashed past
him before he could put into execution his plan of leaping at the
horses' heads. The carriage window had been closed and the girl's
face had disappeared. And the brougham, behind which he was now
running, was no more than a black spot on the white road.</p>

<p>He called out again: "Christine!"</p>

<p>No reply. And he stopped in the midst of the silence.</p>

<p>With a lack-luster eye, he stared down that cold, desolate
road and into the pale, dead night. Nothing was colder than his
heart, nothing half so dead: he had loved an angel and now he
despised a woman!</p>

<p>Raoul, how that little fairy of the North has trifled with
you! Was it really, was it really necessary to have so fresh and
young a face, a forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself
with the pink blush of modesty in order to pass in the lonely
night, in a carriage and pair, accompanied by a mysterious lover?
Surely there should be some limit to hypocrisy and lying!...</p>

<p>She had passed without answering his cry.... And he was
thinking of dying; and he was twenty years old!...</p>

<p>His valet found him in the morning sitting on his bed. He had
not undressed and the servant feared, at the sight of his face,
that some disaster had occurred. Raoul snatched his letters from
the man's hands. He had recognized Christine's paper and
hand-writing. She said:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Dear</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">
Go to the masked ball at the Opera on the night after
to-morrow. At twelve o'clock, be in the little room behind the
chimney-place of the big crush-room. Stand near the door that
leads to the Rotunda. Don't mention this appointment to any one
on earth. Wear a white domino and be carefully masked. As you
love me, do not let yourself be recognized.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Christine</span>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>AT THE MASKED BALL</h3>

<p class="first">
THE envelope was covered with mud and unstamped. It bore the
words "To be handed to M. le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny," with the
address in pencil. It must have been flung out in the hope that a
passer-by would pick up the note and deliver it, which was what
happened. The note had been picked up on the pavement of the
Place de l'Opéra.</p>

<p>Raoul read it over again with fevered eyes. No more was needed
to revive his hope. The somber picture which he had for a moment
imagined of a Christine forgetting her duty to herself made way
for his original conception of an unfortunate, innocent child,
the victim of imprudence and exaggerated sensibility. To what
extent, at this time, was she really a victim? Whose prisoner was
she? Into what whirlpool had she been dragged? He asked himself
these questions with a cruel anguish; but even this pain seemed
endurable beside the frenzy into which he was thrown at the
thought of a lying and deceitful Christine. What had happened?
What influence had she undergone? What monster had carried her
off and by what means?...</p>

<p>By what means indeed but that of music? He knew Christine's
story. After her father's death, she acquired a distaste of
everything in life, including her art. She went through the
<i>conservatoire</i> like a poor soulless singing-machine. And,
suddenly, she awoke as though through the intervention of a god.
The Angel of Music appeared upon the scene! She sang Margarita in
<i>Faust</i>  and triumphed!...</p>

<p>The Angel of Music!... For three months the Angel of Music had
been giving Christine lessons.... Ah, he was a punctual
singing-master!... And now he was taking her for drives in the
Bois!...</p>

<p>Raoul's fingers clutched at his flesh, above his jealous
heart. In his inexperience, he now asked himself with terror what
game the girl was playing? Up to what point could an opera-singer
make a fool of a good-natured young man, quite new to love? O
misery!...</p>

<p>Thus did Raoul's thoughts fly from one extreme to the other.
He no longer knew whether to pity Christine or to curse her; and
he pitied and cursed her turn and turn about. At all events, he
bought a white domino.</p>

<p>The hour of the appointment came at last. With his face in a
mask trimmed with long, thick lace, looking like a pierrot in his
white wrap, the viscount thought himself very ridiculous. Men of
the world do not go to the Opera ball in fancy-dress! It was
absurd. One thought, however, consoled the viscount: he would
certainly never be recognized!</p>

<p>This ball was an exceptional affair, given some time before
Shrovetide, in honor of the anniversary of the birth of a famous
draftsman; and it was expected to be much gayer, noisier, more
Bohemian than the ordinary masked ball. Numbers of artists had
arranged to go, accompanied by a whole cohort of models and
pupils, who, by midnight, began to create a tremendous din. Raoul
climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to twelve, did not
linger to look at the motley dresses displayed all the way up the
marble steps, one of the richest settings in the world, allowed
no facetious mask to draw him into a war of wits, replied to no
jests and shook off the bold familiarity of a number of couples
who had already become a trifle too gay. Crossing the big
crush-room and escaping from a mad whirl of dancers in which he
was caught for a moment, he at last entered the room mentioned in
Christine's letter. He found it crammed; for this small space was
the point where all those who were going to supper in the Rotunda
crossed those who were returning from taking a glass of
champagne. The fun, here, waxed fast and furious.</p>

<p>Raoul leaned against a door-post and waited. He did not wait
long. A black domino passed and gave a quick squeeze to the tips
of his-fingers. He understood that it was she and followed
her:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Christine?" he asked, between his teeth.</p>

<p>The black domino turned round promptly and raised her finger
to her lips, no doubt to warn him not to mention her name again.
Raoul continued to follow her in silence.</p>

<p>He was afraid of losing her, after meeting her again in such
strange circumstances. His grudge against her was gone. He no
longer doubted that she had "nothing to reproach herself with,"
however peculiar and inexplicable her conduct might seem. He was
ready to make any display of clemency, forgiveness or cowardice.
He was in love. And, no doubt, he would soon receive a very
natural explanation of her curious absence.</p>

<p>The black domino turned back from time to time to see if the
white domino was still following.</p>

<p>As Raoul once more passed through the great crush-room, this
time in the wake of his guide, he could not help noticing a group
crowding round a person whose disguise, eccentric air and
gruesome appearance were causing a sensation. It was a man
dressed all in scarlet, with a huge hat and feathers on the top
of a wonderful death's head. From his shoulders hung an immense
red-velvet cloak, which trailed along the floor like a king's
train; and on this cloak was embroidered, in gold letters, which
every one read and repeated aloud, "Don't touch me! I am Red
Death stalking abroad!"</p>

<p>Then one, greatly daring, did try to touch him... but a
skeleton hand shot out of a crimson sleeve and violently seized
the rash one's wrist; and he, feeling the clutch of the
knucklebones, the furious grasp of Death, uttered a cry of pain
and terror. When Red Death released him at last, he ran away like
a very madman, pursued by the jeers of the bystanders.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Raoul passed in front
of the funereal masquerader, who had just happened to turn in
his direction. And he nearly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"The death's head of Perros-Guirec!"</p>

<p>He had recognized him!... He wanted to dart forward,
forgetting Christine; but the black domino, who also seemed
a prey to some strange excitement, caught him by the arm
and dragged him from the crush-room, far from the mad crowd
through which Red Death was stalking....</p>

<p>The black domino kept on turning back and, apparently, on two
occasions saw something that startled her, for she hurried her
pace and Raoul's as though they were being pursued.</p>

<p>They went up two floors. Here, the stairs and corridors were
almost deserted. The black domino opened the door of a private
box and beckoned to the white domino to follow her. Then
Christine, whom he recognized by the sound of her voice, closed
the door behind them and warned him, in a whisper, to remain at
the back of the box and on no account to show himself. Raoul took
off his mask. Christine kept hers on. And, when Raoul was about
to ask her to remove it, he was surprised to see her put her ear
to the partition and listen eagerly for a sound outside. Then she
opened the door ajar, looked out into the corridor and, in a low
voice, said:</p>

<p>"He must have gone up higher." Suddenly she exclaimed: "He is
coming down again!"</p>

<p>She tried to close the door, but Raoul prevented her; for
he had seen, on the top step of the staircase that led to the
floor above, <i>a red foot</i>, followed by another... and slowly,
majestically, the whole scarlet dress of Red Death met his eyes.
And he once more saw the death's head of Perros-Guirec.</p>

<p>"It's he!" he exclaimed. "This time, he shall not escape
me!..."</p>

<p>But Christian had slammed the door at the moment when Raoul
was on the point of rushing out. He tried to push her aside.</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean by 'he'?" she asked, in a changed voice.
"Who shall not escape you?"</p>

<p>Raoul tried to overcome the girl's resistance by force, but
she repelled him with a strength which he would not have
suspected in her. He understood, or thought he understood, and at
once lost his temper.</p>

<p>"Who?" he repeated angrily. "Why, he, the man who hides behind
that hideous mask of death!... The evil genius of the churchyard at
Perros!... Red Death!... In a word, madam, your friend... your
Angel of Music!... But I shall snatch off his mask, as I shall
snatch off my own; and, this time, we shall look each other in
the face, he and I, with no veil and no lies between us; and I
shall know whom you love and who loves you!"</p>

<p>He burst into a mad laugh, while Christine gave a disconsolate
moan behind her velvet mask. With a tragic gesture, she flung out
her two arms, which fixed a barrier of white flesh against the
door.</p>

<p>"In the name of our love, Raoul, you shall not pass!..."</p>

<p>He stopped. What had she said?... In the name of their
love?... Never before had she confessed that she loved him.
And yet she had had opportunities enough.... Pooh, her only
object was to gain a few seconds!... She wished to give the Red
Death time to escape.... And, in accents of childish hatred, he
said:</p>

<p>"You lie, madam, for you do not love me and you have never
loved me! What a poor fellow I must be to let you mock and flout
me as you have done! Why did you give me every reason for hope,
at Perros... for honest hope, madam, for I am an honest man and I
believed you to be an honest woman, when your only intention was
to deceive me! Alas, you have deceived us all! You have taken a
shameful advantage of the candid affection of your benefactress
herself, who continues to believe in your sincerity while you go
about the Opera ball with Red Death!... I despise you!..."</p>

<p>And he burst into tears. She allowed him to insult her. She
thought of but one thing, to keep him from leaving the box.</p>

<p>"You will beg my pardon, one day, for all those ugly words,
Raoul, and when you do I shall forgive you!"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, no, you have driven me mad! When I
think that I had only one object in life: to give my name to an
opera wench!"</p>

<p>"Raoul!... How can you?"</p>

<p>"I shall die of shame!"</p>

<p>"No, dear, live!" said Christine's grave and changed voice.
"And... good-by. Good-by, Raoul...."</p>

<p>The boy stepped forward, staggering as he went. He risked one
more sarcasm:</p>

<p>"Oh, you must let me come and applaud you from time to
time!"</p>

<p>"I shall never sing again, Raoul!..."</p>

<p>"Really?" he replied, still more satirically. "So he is taking
you off the stage: I congratulate you!... But we shall meet in
the Bois, one of these evenings!"</p>

<p>"Not in the Bois nor anywhere, Raoul: you shall not see me
again..."</p>

<p>"May one ask at least to what darkness you are returning?...
For what hell are you leaving, mysterious lady... or for what
paradise?"</p>

<p>"I came to tell you, dear, but I can't tell you now... you
would not believe me! You have lost faith in me, Raoul; it is
finished!"</p>

<p>She spoke in such a despairing voice that the lad began to
feel remorse for his cruelty.</p>

<p>"But look here!" he cried. "Can't you tell me what all this
means!... You are free, there is no one to interfere with you....
You go about Paris.... You put on a domino to come to the
ball.... Why do you not go home?... What have you been doing this
past fortnight?... What is this tale about the Angel of Music,
which you have been telling Mamma Valerius? Some one may have
taken you in, played upon your innocence. I was a witness of it
myself, at Perros... but you know what to believe now! You seem
to me quite sensible, Christine. You know what you are doing....
And meanwhile Mamma Valerius lies waiting for you at home and
appealing to your 'good genius!'... Explain yourself, Christine,
I beg of you! Any one might have been deceived as I was. What is
this farce?"</p>

<p>Christine simply took oft her mask and said: "Dear, it is a
tragedy!"</p>

<p>Raoul now saw her face and could not restrain an exclamation
of surprise and terror. The fresh complexion of former days was
gone. A mortal pallor covered those features, which he had known
so charming and so gentle, and sorrow had furrowed them with
pitiless lines and traced dark and unspeakably sad shadows under
her eyes.</p>

<p>"My dearest! My dearest!" he moaned, holding out his arms.
"You promised to forgive me..."</p>

<p>"Perhaps!... Some day, perhaps!" she said, resuming her mask;
and she went away, forbidding him, with a gesture, to follow
her.</p>

<p>He tried to disobey her; but she turned round and repeated her
gesture of farewell with such authority that he dared not move a
step.</p>

<p>He watched her till she was out of sight. Then he also went
down among the crowd, hardly knowing what he was doing, with
throbbing temples and an aching heart; and, as he crossed the
dancing-floor, he asked if anybody had seen Red Death. Yes, every
one had seen Red Death; but Raoul could not find him; and, at
two o'clock in the morning, he turned down the passage, behind
the scenes, that led to Christine Daaé's dressing-room.</p>

<p>His footsteps took him to that room where he had first known
suffering. He tapped at the door. There was no answer. He
entered, as he had entered when he looked everywhere for "the
man's voice." The room was empty. A gas-jet was burning, turned
down low. He saw some writing-paper on a little desk. He thought
of writing to Christine, but he heard steps in the passage. He
had only time to hide in the inner room, which was separated from
the dressing-room by a curtain.</p>

<p>Christine entered, took off her mask with a weary movement and
flung it on the table. She sighed and let her pretty head fall
into her two hands. What was she thinking of? Of Raoul? No, for
Raoul heard her murmur: "Poor Erik!"</p>

<p>At first, he thought he must be mistaken. To begin with, he
was persuaded that, if any one was to be pitied, it was he,
Raoul. It would have been quite natural if she had said, "Poor
Raoul," after what had happened between them. But, shaking her
head, she repeated: "Poor Erik!"</p>

<p>What had this Erik to do with Christine's sighs and why was
she pitying Erik when Raoul was so unhappy?</p>

<p>Christine began to write, deliberately, calmly and so placidly
that Raoul, who was still trembling from the effects of the
tragedy that separated them, was painfully impressed.</p>

<p>"What coolness!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>She wrote on, filling two, three, four sheets. Suddenly, she
raised her head and hid the sheets in her bodice.... She seemed
to be listening.</p>

<p>Raoul also listened... Whence came that strange sound, that
distant rhythm?... A faint singing seemed to issue from the
walls... yes, it was as though the walls themselves were
singing!... The song became plainer... the words were now
distinguishable... he heard a voice, a very beautiful, very soft,
very captivating voice... but, for all its softness, it remained
a male voice... The voice came nearer and nearer... it came
through the wall... it approached... and now the voice was <i>in
the room</i>, in front of Christine. Christine rose and
addressed the voice, as though speaking to some one:</p>

<p>"Here I am, Erik," she said. "I am ready. But you are
late."</p>

<p>Raoul, peeping from behind the curtain, could not believe his
eyes, which showed him nothing. Christine's face lit up. A smile
of happiness appeared upon her bloodless lips, a smile like that
of sick people when they receive the first hope of recovery.</p>

<p>The voice without a body went on singing; and certainly Raoul
had never in his life heard anything more absolutely and
heroically sweet, more gloriously insidious, more delicate, more
powerful, in short, more irresistibly triumphant. He listened to
it in a fever and he now began to understand how Christine Daaé
was able to appear one evening, before the stupefied audience,
 with accents of a beauty hitherto unknown, of a superhuman
exaltation, while doubtless still under the influence of the
mysterious and invisible master.</p>

<p>The voice was singing the Wedding-night Song from <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>. Raoul saw Christine stretch out her arms to the voice
as she had done, in Perros churchyard, to the invisible violin
playing <i>The Resurrection of Lazarus</i>. And nothing could
describe the passion with which the voice sang:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"</p>

<br>

<p>The strains went through Raoul's heart. Struggling against the
charm that seemed to deprive him of all his will and all his
energy and of almost all his lucidity at the moment when he
needed them most, he succeeded in drawing back the curtain that
hid him and he walked to where Christine stood. She herself was
moving to the back of the room, the whole wall of which was
occupied by a great mirror that reflected her image, but not his,
for he was just behind her and entirely covered by her.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"</p>

<br>

<p>Christine walked toward her image in the glass and the image
came toward her. The two Christines&mdash;the real one and the
reflection&mdash;ended by touching; and Raoul put out his arms
to clasp the two in one embrace. But, by a sort of dazzling
miracle that sent him staggering, Raoul was suddenly flung back,
while an icy blast swept over his face; he saw, not two, but
four, eight, twenty Christines spinning round him, laughing at
him and fleeing so swiftly that he could not touch one of them.
At last, everything stood still again; and he saw himself in the
glass. But Christine had disappeared.</p>

<p>He rushed up to the glass. He struck at the walls. Nobody! And
meanwhile the room still echoed with a distant passionate
singing:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!"</p>

<br>

<p>Which way, which way had Christine gone?... Which way would
she return?...</p>

<p>Would she return? Alas, had she not declared to him that
everything was finished? And was the voice not repeating:</p>

<p>"Fate links thee to me for ever and a day!" To me? To
whom?</p>

<p>Then, worn out, beaten, empty-brained, he sat down on the
chair which Christine had just left. Like her, he let his head
fall into his hands. When he raised it, the tears were streaming
down his young cheeks, real, heavy tears like those which jealous
children shed, tears that wept for a sorrow which was in no way
fanciful, but which is common to all the lovers on earth and
which he expressed aloud:</p>

<p>"Who is this Erik?" he said.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>FORGET THE NAME OF THE MAN'S VOICE</h3>

<p class="first">
THE day after Christine had vanished before his  eyes in a
sort of dazzlement that still made him doubt the evidence of his
senses, M. le Vicomte de Chagny called to inquire at Mamma
Valerius'. He came upon a charming picture. Christine herself was
seated by the bedside of the old lady, who was sitting up against
the pillows, knitting. The pink and white had returned to the
young girl's cheeks. The dark rings round her eyes had
disappeared. Raoul no longer recognized the tragic face of the
day before. If the veil of melancholy over those adorable
features had not still appeared to the young man as the last
trace of the weird drama in whose toils that mysterious child was
struggling, he could have believed that Christine was not its
heroine at all.</p>

<p>She rose, without showing any emotion, and offered him her
hand. But Raoul's stupefaction was so great that he stood there
dumfounded, without a gesture, without a word.</p>

<p>"Well, M. de Chagny," exclaimed Mamma Valerius, "don't you
know our Christine? Her good genius has sent her back to us!"</p>

<p>"Mamma!" the girl broke in promptly, while a deep blush
mantled to her eyes. "I thought, mamma, that there was to be no
more question of that! >You know there is no such thing as the
Angel of Music!"</p>

<p>"But, child, he gave you lessons for three months!"</p>

<p>"Mamma, I have promised to explain everything to you one of
these days; and I hope to do so... but you have promised me,
until that day, to be silent and to ask me no more questions
whatever!"</p>

<p>"Provided that you promised never to leave me again! But have
you promised that, Christine?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, all this can not interest M. de Chagny."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, mademoiselle," said the young man, in a
voice which he tried to make firm and brave, but which still
trembled, "anything that concerns you interests me to an extent
which perhaps you will one day understand. I do not deny that my
surprise equals my pleasure at finding you with your
adopted mother and that, after what happened between us
yesterday, after what you said and what I was able to guess, I
hardly expected to see you here so soon. I should be the first to
delight at your return, if you were not so bent on preserving a
secrecy that may be fatal to you... and I have been your friend
too long not to be alarmed, with Mme. Valerius, at a disastrous
adventure which will remain dangerous so long as we have not
unraveled its threads and of which you will certainly end by
being the victim, Christine."</p>

<p>At these words, Mamma Valerius tossed about in her bed.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" she cried. "Is Christine in
danger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madame," said Raoul courageously, notwithstanding the
signs which Christine made to him.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the good, simple old woman, gasping for
breath. "You must tell me everything, Christine! Why did you try
to reassure me? And what danger is it, M. de Chagny?"</p>

<p>"An impostor is abusing her good faith."</p>

<p>"Is the Angel of Music an impostor?"</p>

<p>"She told you herself that there is no Angel of Music."</p>

<p>"But then what is it, in Heaven's name? You will be the death
of me!"</p>

<p>"There is a terrible mystery around us, madame, around you,
around Christine, a mystery much more to be feared than any
number of ghosts or genii!"</p>

<p>Mamma Valerius turned a terrified face to Christine, who had
already run to her adopted mother and was holding her in her
arms.</p>

<p>"Don't believe him, mummy, don't believe him," she
repeated.</p>

<p>"Then tell me that you will never leave me again," implored
the widow.</p>

<p>Christine was silent and Raoul resumed.</p>

<p>"That is what you must promise, Christine. It is the only
thing that can reassure your mother and me. We will undertake not
to ask you a single question about the past, if you promise us to
remain under our protection in future."</p>

<p>"That is an undertaking which I have not asked of you and
a promise which I refuse to make you!" said the young girl
haughtily. "I am mistress of my own actions, M. de Chagny: you
have no right to control them, and I will beg you to desist
henceforth. As to what I have done during the last fortnight,
there is only one man in the world who has the right to demand
an account of me: my husband! Well, I have no husband and I
never mean to marry!"</p>

<p>She threw out her hands to emphasize her words and Raoul
turned pale, not only because of the words which he had heard,
but because he had caught sight of a plain gold ring on
Christine's finger.</p>

<p>"You have no husband and yet you wear a wedding-ring."</p>

<p>He tried to seize her hand, but she swiftly drew it back.</p>

<p>"That's a present!" she said, blushing once more and vainly
striving to hide her embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Christine! As you have no husband, that ring can only have
been given by one who hopes to make you his wife! Why deceive us
further? Why torture me still more? That ring is a promise; and
that promise has been accepted!"</p>

<p>"That's what I said!" exclaimed the old lady.</p>

<p>"And what did she answer, madame?"</p>

<p>"What I chose," said Christine, driven to exasperation. "Don't
you think, monsieur, that this cross-examination has lasted long
enough? As far as I am concerned..."</p>

<p>Raoul was afraid to let her finish her speech. He interrupted
her:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for speaking as I did, mademoiselle. You
know the good intentions that make me meddle, just now, in
matters which, you no doubt think, have nothing to do with me.
But allow me to tell you what I have seen&mdash;and I have seen
more than you suspect, Christine&mdash;or what I thought I saw,
for, to tell you the truth, I have sometimes been inclined to
doubt the evidence of my eyes."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you see, sir, or think you saw?"</p>

<p>"I saw your ecstasy <i>at the sound of the voice</i>,
Christine: the voice that came from the wall or the next room to
yours... yes, <i>your ecstasy!</i>  And that is what makes me
alarmed on your behalf. You are under a very dangerous spell. And
yet it seems that you are aware of the imposture, because you say
to-day <i>that there is no Angel of Music!</i>  In that case,
Christine, why did you follow him that time? Why did you stand
up, with radiant features, as though you were really hearing
angels?... Ah, it is a very dangerous voice, Christine, for I
myself, when I heard it, was so much fascinated by it that you
vanished before my eyes without my seeing which way you passed!
Christine, Christine, in the name of Heaven, in the name of your
father who is in Heaven now and who loved you so dearly and who
loved me too, Christine, tell us, tell your benefactress and me,
to whom does that voice belong? If you do, we will save you in
spite of yourself. Come, Christine, the name of the man! The name
of the man who had the audacity to put a ring on your
finger!"</p>

<p>"M. de Chagny," the girl declared coldly, "you shall never
know!"</p>

<p>Thereupon, seeing the hostility with which her ward had
addressed the viscount, Mamma Valerius suddenly took Christine's
part.</p>

<p>"And, if she does love that man, <i>monsieur le vicomte</i>,
even then it is no business of yours!"</p>

<p>"Alas, madame," Raoul humbly replied, unable to restrain his
tears, "alas, I believe that Christine really does love him!...
But it is not only that which drives me to despair; for what I am
not certain of, madame, is that the man whom Christine loves is
worthy of her love!"</p>

<p>"It is for me to be the judge of that, monsieur!" said
Christine, looking Raoul angrily in the face.</p>

<p>"When a man," continued Raoul, "adopts such romantic methods
to entice a young girl's affections...."</p>

<p>"The man must be either a villain, or the girl a fool: is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Christine!"</p>

<p>"Raoul, why do you condemn a man whom you have never seen,
whom no one knows and about whom you yourself know nothing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Christine.... Yes.... I at least know the name that you
thought to keep from me for ever.... The name of your Angel of
Music, mademoiselle, is Erik!"</p>

<p>Christine at once betrayed herself. She turned as white as a
sheet and stammered:</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"You yourself!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"By pitying him the other night, the night of the
masked ball. When you went to your dressing-room, did you not
say, 'Poor Erik?' Well, Christine, there was a poor Raoul who
overheard you."</p>

<p>"This is the second time that you have listened behind the
door, M. de Chagny!"</p>

<p>"I was not behind the door.... I was in the dressing-room, in
the inner room, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Oh, unhappy man!" moaned the girl, showing every sign of
unspeakable terror. "Unhappy man! Do you want to be killed?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>Raoul uttered this "perhaps" with so much love and despair in
his voice that Christine could not keep back a sob. She took his
hands and looked at him with all the pure affection of which she
was capable:</p>

<p>"Raoul," she said, "forget <i>the man's voice</i>  and do not
even remember its name... You must never try to fathom the
mystery of <i>the man's voice</i> ...."</p>

<p>"Is the mystery so very terrible?"</p>

<p>"There is no more awful mystery on this earth. Swear to me
that you will make no attempt to find <p>out," she insisted.
"Swear to me that you will never come to my dressing-room,
unless I send for you."</p>

<p>"Then you promise to send for me sometimes, Christine?"</p>

<p>"I promise."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then I swear to do as you ask." He kissed her hands and went
away, cursing Erik and resolving to be patient.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>ABOVE THE TRAP-DOORS</h3>

<p class="first">
THE next day, he saw her at the Opera. She was still wearing
the plain gold ring. She was gentle and kind to him. She talked
to him of the plans which he was forming, of his future, of his
career.</p>

<p>He told her that the date of the Polar expedition had been put
forward and that he would leave France in three weeks, or a month
at latest. She suggested, almost gaily, that he must look upon
the voyage with delight, as a stage toward his coming fame.
And when he replied that fame without love was no attraction in
his eyes, she treated him as a child whose sorrows were only
short-lived.</p>

<p>"How can you speak so lightly of such serious things?" he
asked. "Perhaps we shall never see each other again! I may die
during that expedition."</p>

<p>"Or I," she said simply.</p>

<p>She no longer smiled or jested. She seemed to be thinking of
some new thing that had entered her mind for the first time. Her
eyes were all aglow with it.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of, Christine?"</p>

<p>"I am thinking that we shall not see each other again..."</p>

<p>"And does that make you so radiant?"</p>

<p>"And that, in a month, we shall have to say good-by for
ever!"</p>

<p>"Unless, Christine, we pledge our faith and wait for each
other for ever."</p>

<p>She put her hand on his mouth.</p>

<p>"Hush, Raoul!... You know there is no question of that... And
'2 shall never be married: that is understood!"</p>

<p>She seemed suddenly almost unable to contain an overpowering
gaiety. She clapped her hands with childish glee. Raoul stared at
her in amazement.</p>

<p>"But... but," she continued, holding out her two hands to
Raoul, or rather giving them to him, as though she had suddenly
resolved to make him a present of them, "but if we can not be
married, we can... we can be engaged! Nobody will know but
ourselves, Raoul. There have been plenty of secret marriages:
why not a secret engagement? We are engaged, dear, for a month!
In a month, you will go away, and I can be happy at the thought
of that month all my life long!"</p>

<p>She was enchanted with her inspiration. Then she became
serious again.</p>

<p>"This," she said, <i>"is a happiness that will harm no
one."</i></p>

<p>Raoul jumped at the idea. He bowed to Christine and said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I have the honor to ask for your hand."</p>

<p>"Why, you have both of them already, my dear betrothed!... Oh,
Raoul, how happy we shall be!... We must play at being engaged
all day long."</p>

<p>It was the prettiest game in the world and they enjoyed it
like the children that they were. Oh, the wonderful speeches they
made to each other and the eternal vows they exchanged! They
played at hearts as other children might play at ball; only, as
it was really their two hearts that they flung to and fro, they
had to be very, very handy to catch them, each time, without
hurting them.</p>

<p>One day, about a week after the game began, Raoul's heart was
badly hurt and he stopped playing and uttered these wild words:
</p>

<p>"I shan't go to the North Pole!"</p>

<p>Christine, who, in her innocence, had not dreamed of such a
possibility, suddenly discovered the danger of the game and
reproached herself bitterly. She did not say a word in reply to
Raoul's remark and went straight home.</p>

<p>This happened in the afternoon, in the singer's dressing-room,
where they met every day and where they amused themselves by
dining on three biscuits, two glasses of port and a bunch of
violets. In the evening, she did not sing; and he did not receive
his usual letter, though they had arranged to write to each other
daily during that month. The next morning, he ran off to Mamma
Valerius, who told him that Christine had gone away for two days.
She had left at live o'clock the day before.</p>

<p>Raoul was distracted. He hated Mamma Valerius for giving him
such news as that with such stupefying calmness. He tried to
sound her, but the old lady obviously knew nothing.</p>

<p>Christine returned on the following day. She returned in
triumph. She renewed her extraordinary success of the gala
performance. Since the adventure of the "toad," Carlotta had not
been able to appear on the stage. The terror of a fresh "co-ack"
filled her heart and deprived her of all her power of singing;
and the theater that had witnessed her incomprehensible disgrace
had become odious to her. She contrived to cancel her contract.
Daaé was offered the vacant place for the time. She received
thunders of applause in the <i>Juive</i>.</p>

<p>The viscount, who, of course, was present, was the only one to
suffer on hearing the thousand echoes of this fresh triumph; for
Christine still wore her plain gold ring. A distant voice
whispered in the young man's ear:</p>

<p>"She is wearing the ring again to-night; and you did not give
it to her. She gave her soul again tonight and did not give it to
you.... If she will not tell you what she has been doing the past
two days you must go and ask Erik!"</p>

<p>He ran behind the scenes and placed himself in her way. She
saw him for her eyes were looking for him. She said:</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick!... Come!"</p>

<p>And she dragged him to her dressing-room.</p>

<p>Raoul at once threw himself on his knees before her. He
swore to her that he would go and he entreated her never again
to withhold a single hour of the ideal happiness which she
had promised him. She let her tears flow. They kissed like a
despairing brother and sister who have been smitten with a
common loss and who meet to mourn a dead parent.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she snatched herself from the young man's soft and
timid embrace, seemed to listen to something, and, with a quick
gesture, pointed to the door. When he was on the threshold, she
said, in so low a voice that the viscount guessed rather than
heard her words:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, my dear betrothed! And be happy, Raoul: I sang for
you to-night!"</p>

<p>He returned the next day. But those two days of absence had
broken the charm of their delightful make-believe. They looked at
each other, in the dressing-room, with their sad eyes, without
exchanging a word. Raoul had to restrain himself not to cry
out:</p>

<p>"I am jealous! I am jealous! I am jealous!" But she heard him
all the same. Then she said: "Come for a walk, dear. The air will
do you good."</p>

<p>Raoul thought that she would propose a stroll in the country,
far from that building which he detested as a prison whose jailer
he could feel walking within the walls... the jailer Erik.... But
she took him to the stage and made him sit on the wooden curb of
a well, in the doubtful peace and coolness of a first scene set
for the evening's performance.</p>

<p>On another day, she wandered with him, hand in hand, along the
deserted paths of a garden whose creepers had been cut out by a
decorator's skilful hands. It was as though the real sky, the
real flowers, the real earth were forbidden her for all time and
she condemned to breathe no other air than that of the theater.
An occasional fireman passed, watching over their melancholy
idyll from afar. And she would drag him up above the clouds, in
the magnificent disorder of the grid, where she loved to make him
giddy by running in front of him along the frail bridges,
among the thousands of ropes fastened to the pulleys, the
windlasses, the rollers, in the midst of a regular forest of
yards and masts. If he hesitated, she said, with an adorable pout
of her lips:</p>

<p>"You, a sailor!"</p>

<p>And then they returned to <i>terra firma</i>, that is to say,
to some passage that led them to the little girls'
dancing-school, where brats between six and ten were practising
their steps, in the hope of becoming great dancers one day,
"covered with diamonds"... Meanwhile, Christine gave them sweets
instead.</p>

<p>She took him to the wardrobe and property-rooms, took him all
over her empire, which was artificial, but immense, covering
seventeen stories from the ground-floor to the roof and inhabited
by an army of subjects. She moved among them like a popular
queen, encouraging them in their labors, sitting down in the
workshops, giving words of advice to the workmen whose hands
hesitated to cut into the rich stuffs that were to clothe heroes.
There were inhabitants of that country who practised every trade.
There were cobblers, there were goldsmiths. All had learned to
know her and to love her, for she always interested herself in
all their troubles and all their little hobbies.</p>

<p>She knew unsuspected corners that were secretly occupied by
little old couples. She knocked at their door and introduced
Raoul to them as a Prince Charming who had asked for her hand;
and the two of them, sitting on some worm-eaten "property,"
would listen to the legends of the Opera, even as, in their
childhood, they had listened to the old Breton tales. Those old
people remembered nothing outside the Opera. They had lived
there for years without number. Past managements had forgotten
them; palace revolutions had taken no notice of them; the
history of France had run its course unknown to them; and nobody
recollected their existence.</p>

<p>The precious days sped in this way; and Raoul and Christine,
by affecting excessive interest in outside matters, strove
awkwardly to hide from each other the one thought of their
hearts. One fact was certain, that Christine, who until then had
shown herself the stronger of the two, became suddenly
inexpressibly nervous. When on their expeditions, she would start
running without reason or else suddenly stop; and her hand,
turning ice-cold in a moment, would hold the young man back.
Sometimes her eyes seemed to pursue imaginary shadows. She cried,
"This way," and "This way," and "This way," laughing a breathless
laugh that often ended in tears. Then Raoul tried to speak, to
question her, in spite of his promises.</p>

<p>But, even before he had worded his question, she answered
feverishly:</p>

<p>"Nothing... I swear it is nothing."</p>

<p>Once, when they were passing before an open trapdoor on the
stage, Raoul stopped over the dark cavity.</p>

<p>"You have shown me over the upper part of your empire,
Christine, but there are strange stories told of the lower part.
Shall we go down?"</p>

<p>She caught him in her arms, as though she feared to see him
disappear down the black hole, and, in a trembling voice,
whispered:</p>

<p>"Never!... I will not have you go there I... Besides, it's not
mine... <i>everything that is underground belongs to him!</i>"</p>

<p>Raoul looked her in the eyes and said roughly:</p>

<p>"So he lives down there, does he?"</p>

<p>"I never said so.... Who told you a thing like that? Come
away! I sometimes wonder if you are quite sane, Raoul.... You
always take things in such an impossible way.... Come along!
Come!"</p>

<p>And she literally dragged him away, for he was obstinate and
wanted to remain by the trap-door; that hole attracted him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the trap-door was closed and so quickly that they
did not even see the hand that worked it; and they remained quite
dazed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps <i>he</i>  was there," Raoul said, at last.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, but did not seem easy.</p>

<p>"No, no, it was the 'trap-door-shutters.' They must do
something, you know.... They open and shut the trap-doors
without any particular reason.... It's like the 'door-shutters:'
they must spend their time somehow."</p>

<p>"But suppose it were <i>he</i>, Christine?"</p>

<p>"No, no! He has shut himself up, he is working."</p>

<p>"Oh, really! He's working, is he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he can't open and shut the trap-doors and work at the
same time." She shivered.</p>

<p>"What is he working at?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something terrible!... But it's all the better for us....
When he's working at that, he sees nothing; he does not eat,
drink, or breathe for days and nights at a time... he becomes a
living dead man and has no time to amuse himself with the
trap-doors."</p>

<p>She shivered again. She was still holding him in her arms.
Then she sighed and said, in her turn:</p>

<p>"Suppose it were <i>he!</i>"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not," she said.</p>

<p>For all that, on the next day and the following days,
Christine was careful to avoid the trap-doors. Her agitation only
increased as the hours passed. At last, one afternoon, she
arrived very late, with her face so desperately pale and her eyes
so desperately red, that Raoul resolved to go to all lengths,
including that which he foreshadowed when he blurted out that he
would not go on the North Pole expedition unless she first told
him the secret of the man's voice.</p>

<p>"Hush! Hush, in Heaven's name! Suppose <i>he</i>  heard you,
you unfortunate Raoul!"</p>

<p>And Christine's eyes stared wildly at everything around
her.</p>

<p>"I will remove you from his power, Christine, I swear it. And
you shall not think of him any more."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>She allowed herself this doubt, which was an encouragement,
while dragging the young man up to the topmost floor of the
theater, far, very far from the trap-doors.</p>

<p>"I shall hide you in some unknown corner of the world, where
<i>he</i>  can not come to look for you. You will be safe; and
then I shall go away... as you have sworn never to marry."</p>

<p>Christine seized Raoul's hands and squeezed them with
incredible rapture. But, suddenly becoming alarmed again, she
turned away her head.</p>

<p>"Higher!" was all she said. "Higher still!"</p>

<p>And she dragged him up toward the summit.</p>

<p>He had a difficulty in following her. They were soon under the
very roof, in the maze of timber-work. They slipped through the
buttresses, the rafters, the joists; they ran from beam to beam
as they might have run from tree to tree in a forest.</p>

<p>And, despite the care which she took to look behind her at
every moment, she failed to see a shadow which followed her like
her own shadow, which stopped when she stopped, which started
again when she did and which made no more noise than a
well-conducted shadow should. As for Raoul, he saw nothing
either; for, when he had Christine in front of him, nothing
interested him that happened behind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>APOLLO'S LYRE</h3>

<p class="first">
IN this way, they reached the roof. Christine tripped over
it as lightly as a swallow. Their eyes swept the empty space
between the three domes and the triangular pediment. She
breathed freely over Paris, the whole valley of which was seen
at work below. She called Raoul to come quite close to her and
they walked side by side along the zinc streets, in the leaden
avenues; they looked at their twin shapes in the huge tanks,
full of stagnant water, where, in the hot weather, the little
boys of the ballet, a score or so, learn to swim and dive.</p>

<p>The shadow had followed behind them, clinging to their steps;
and the two children little suspected its presence when they at
last sat down, trustingly, under the mighty protection of Apollo,
who, with a great bronze gesture, lifted his huge lyre to the
heart of a crimson sky.</p>

<p class="caption">They sat like that for a moment in silence.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>It was a gorgeous spring evening. Clouds, which had just
received their gossamer robe of gold and purple from the setting
sun, drifted slowly by; and Christine said to Raoul:</p>

<p>"Soon we shall go farther and faster than the clouds, to the
end of the world, and then you will leave me, Raoul. But, if,
when the moment comes for you to take me away, I refuse to go
with you&mdash;well you must carry me off by force!"</p>

<p>"Are you afraid that you will change your mind,
Christine?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, shaking her head in an odd fashion.
"He is a demon!" And she shivered and nestled in his arms with a
moan. "I am afraid now of going back to live with him... in the
ground!"</p>

<p>"What compels you to go back, Christine?"</p>

<p>"If I do not go back to him, terrible misfortunes may
happen!... But I can't do it, I can't do it!... I know one ought
to be sorry for people who live underground.... But he is too
horrible! And yet the time is at hand; I have only a day left;
and, if I do not go, he will come and fetch me with his voice.
And he will drag me with him, underground, and go on his knees
before me, with his death's head. And he will tell me that he
loves me! And he will cry! Oh, those tears, Raoul, those tears In
the two black eye-sockets of the death's head! I can not see
those tears flow again!"</p>

<p>She wrung her hands in anguish, while Raoul pressed her to his
heart.</p>

<p>"No, no, you shall never again hear him tell you that he loves
you! You shall not see his tears! Let us fly, Christine, let us
fly at once!"</p>

<p>And he tried to drag her away, then and there. But she stopped
him.</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, shaking her head sadly. "Not now!... It
would be too cruel... let him hear me sing to-morrow evening...
and then we will go away. You must come and fetch me in my
dressing-room at midnight exactly. He will then be waiting for me
in the dining-room by the lake... we shall be free and you shall
take me away.... You must promise me that, Raoul, even if I
refuse; for I feel that, if I go back this time, I shall perhaps
never return."</p>

<p>And she gave a sigh to which it seemed to her that another
sigh, behind her, replied.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear?"</p>

<p>Her teeth chattered.</p>

<p>"No," said Raoul, "I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"It is too terrible," she confessed, "to be always trembling
like this!... And yet we run no danger here; we are at home, in
the sky, in the open air, in the light. The sun is flaming...
and night-birds can not bear to look at the sun. I have never
seen <i>him</i> by daylight... it must be awful! Oh, the first
time I saw him!... I thought that he was going to die."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Raoul, really frightened at the aspect which this
strange confidence was taking. <i>"Because had seen him!"</i>
</p>

<p>This time, Raoul and Christine turned round at the same
time:</p>

<p>"There is some one in pain," said Raoul. "Perhaps some one has
been hurt. Did you hear?"</p>

<p>"I can't say," Christine confessed. "Even when he is not
there, my ears are full of his sighs. Still, if you
heard...."</p>

<p>They stood up and looked around them. They were quite alone on
the immense lead roof. They sat down again and Raoul said:</p>

<p>"Tell me how you saw him first."</p>

<p>"I had heard him for three months without seeing him. The
first time I heard it, I thought, as you did, that that adorable
voice was singing in another room. I went out and looked
everywhere; but, as you know, Raoul, my dressing-room is very
much by itself; and I could not find the voice outside my room,
whereas It went on steadily inside. And it not only sang, but it
spoke to me and answered my questions, like a real man's voice,
with this difference, that it was as beautiful as the voice of
an angel. I had never got the Angel of Music whom my poor father
had promised to send me as soon as he was dead. I really think
that Mamma Valerius was a little bit to blame. I told her about
it; and she at once said, 'It must be the Angel; at any rate,
you can do no harm by asking him.' I did so; and the man's voice
replied that, yes, it was the Angel's voice, the voice which I
was expecting and which my father had promised me. From that
time onward, the voice and I became great friends. It asked
leave to give me lessons every day. I agreed and never failed
to keep the appointment which it gave me in my dressing-room.
You have no idea, though you have heard the voice, of what those
lessons were like."</p>

<p>"No, I have no idea," said Raoul. "What was your
accompaniment?"</p>

<p>"We were accompanied by a music which I do not know: it was
behind the wall and wonderfully accurate. The voice seemed to
understand mine exactly, to know precisely where my father had
left off teaching me. In a few weeks' time, I hardly knew myself
when I sang. I was even frightened. I seemed to dread a sort of
witchcraft behind it; but Mamma Valerius reassured me. She said
that she knew I was much too simple a girl to give the devil a
hold on me.... My progress, by the voice's own order, was kept a
secret between the voice, Mamma Valerius and myself. It was a
curious thing, but, outside the dressing-room, I sang with my
ordinary, every-day voice and nobody noticed anything. I did all
that the voice asked. It said, 'Wait and see: we shall astonish
Paris!' And I waited and lived on in a sort of ecstatic dream. It
was then that I saw you for the first time one evening, in the
house. I was so glad that I never thought of concealing my
delight when I reached my dressing-room. Unfortunately, the voice
was there before me and soon noticed, by my air, that something
had happened. It asked what was the matter and I saw no reason
for keeping our story secret or concealing the place which you
filled in my heart. Then the voice was silent. I called to it,
but it did not reply; I begged and entreated, but in vain. I was
terrified lest it had gone for good. I wish to Heaven it had,
dear! That night, I went home in a desperate condition. I told
Mamma Valerius, who said, 'Why, of course, the voice is jealous!'
And that, dear, first revealed to me that I loved you."</p>

<p>Christine stopped and laid her head on Raoul's shoulder. They
sat like that for a moment, in silence, and they did not see, did
not perceive the movement, at a few steps from them, of the
creeping shadow of two great black wings, a shadow that came
along the roof so near, so near them that it could have stifled
them by closing over them.</p>

<p>"The next day," Christine continued, with a sigh, "I went back
to my dressing-room in a very pensive frame of mind. The voice
was there, spoke to me with great sadness and told me plainly
that, if I must bestow my heart on earth, there was nothing for
the voice to do but to go back to Heaven. And it said this with
such an accent of HUMAN sorrow that I ought then and there to
have suspected and begun to believe that I was the victim of my
deluded senses. But my faith in the voice, with which the memory
of my father was so closely intermingled, remained undisturbed. I
feared nothing so much as that I might never hear it again; I had
thought about my love for you and realized all the useless danger
of it; and I did not even know if you remembered me. Whatever
happened, your position in society forbade me to contemplate the
possibility of ever marrying you; and I swore to the voice that
you were no more than a brother to me nor ever would be and that
my heart was incapable of any earthly love. And that, dear, was
why I refused to recognize or see you when I met you on the stage
or in the passages. Meanwhile, the hours during which the voice
taught me were spent in a divine frenzy, until, at last, the
voice said to me, 'You can now, Christine Daaé, give to men a
little of the music of Heaven.' I don't know how it was that
Carlotta did not come to the theater that night nor why I was
called upon to sing in her stead; but I sang with a rapture I had
never known before and I felt for a moment as if my soul were
leaving my body!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Christine," said Raoul, "my heart quivered that night at
every accent of your voice. I saw the tears stream down your
cheeks and I wept with you. How could you sing, sing like that
while crying?"</p>

<p>"I felt myself fainting," said Christine, "I closed my eyes.
When I opened them, you were by my side. But the voice was there
also, Raoul! I was afraid for your sake and again I would not
recognize you and began to laugh when you reminded me that you
had picked up my scarf in the sea!... Alas, there is no deceiving
the voice!... The voice recognized you and the voice was
jealous!... It said that, if I did not love you, I would not
avoid you, but treat you like any other old friend. It made me
scene upon scene. At last, I said to the voice, 'That will do! I
am going to Perros to-morrow, to pray on my father's grave, and I
shall ask M. Raoul de Chagny to go with me.' 'Do as you please,'
replied the voice, 'but I shall be at Perros too, for I am
wherever you are, Christine; and, if you are still worthy of me,
if you have not lied to me, I will play you The Resurrection of
Lazarus, on the stroke of midnight, on your father's tomb and on
your father's violin.' That, dear, was how I came to write you
the letter that brought you to Perros. How could I have been so
beguiled? How was it, when I saw the personal, the selfish point
of view of the voice, that I did not suspect some impostor? Alas,
I was no longer mistress of myself: I had become his thing!"</p>

<p>"But, after all," cried Raoul, "you soon came to know the
truth! Why did you not at once rid yourself of that abominable
nightmare?"</p>

<p>"Know the truth, Raoul? Rid myself of that nightmare? But, my
poor boy, I was not caught in the nightmare until the day when I
learned the truth!... Pity me, Raoul, pity me!... You remember
the terrible evening when Carlotta thought that she had been
turned into a toad on the stage and when the house was suddenly
plunged in darkness through the chandelier crashing to the floor?
There were killed and wounded that night and the whole theater
rang with terrified screams. My first thought was for you and the
voice. I was at once easy, where you were concerned, for I had
seen you in your brother's box and I knew that you were not in
danger. But the voice had told me that it would be at the
performance and I was really afraid for it, just as if it had
been an ordinary person who was capable of dying. I thought to
myself, 'The chandelier may have come down upon the voice.' I was
then on the stage and was nearly running into the house, to look
for the voice among the killed and wounded, when I thought that,
if the voice was safe, it would be sure to be in my dressing-room
and I rushed to my room. The voice was net there. I locked my
door and, with tears in my eyes, besought it, if it were still
alive, to manifest itself to me. The voice did not reply, but
suddenly I heard a long, beautiful wail which I knew well. It is
the plaint of Lazarus when, at the sound of the Redeemer's voice,
he begins to open his eyes and see the light of day. It was the
music which you and I, Raoul, heard at Perros. And then the voice
began to sing the leading phrase, 'Come! And believe in me! Whoso
believes in me shall live! Walk! Whoso hath believed in me shall
never die!...' I can not tell you the effect which that music had
upon me. It seemed to command me, personally, to come, to stand
up and come to it. It retreated and I followed. 'Come! And
believe in me!' I believed in it, I came... I came and&mdash;this
was the extraordinary thing&mdash;my dressing-room, as I moved,
seemed to lengthen out... to lengthen out. Evidently, it must
have been an effect of mirrors, for I had the mirror in front cf
me... And, suddenly, I was outside the room without knowing
how!"</p>

<p>"What! Without knowing how? Christine, Christine, you must
really stop dreaming!"</p>

<p>"I was not dreaming, dear, I was outside my room without
knowing how. You, who saw me disappear from my room one evening,
may be able to explain it; but I can not. I can only tell you
that, suddenly, there was no mirror before me and no
dressing-room. I was in a dark passage, I was frightened and I
cried out. It was quite dark, but for a faint red glimmer at a
distant corner of the wall. I cried out. My voice was the only
sound, for the singing and the violin had stopped. And, suddenly,
a hand was laid on mine... or rather a stone-cold, bony thing
that seized my wrist and did not let go. I cried out again. An
arm took me round the waist and supported me. I struggled for a
little while and then gave up the attempt. I was dragged toward
the little red light and then I saw that I was in the hands of a
man wrapped in a large cloak and wearing a mask that hid his
whole face. I made one last effort; my limbs stiffened, my mouth
opened to scream, but a hand closed it, a hand which I felt on my
lips, on my skin... a hand that smelt of death. Then I fainted
away.</p>

<p>"When I opened my eyes, we were still surrounded by darkness.
A lantern, standing on the ground, showed a bubbling well. The
water splashing from the well disappeared, almost at once, under
the floor on which I was lying, with my head on the knee of the
man in the black cloak and the black mask. He was bathing my
temples and his hands smelt of death. I tried to push them away
and asked, 'Who are you? Where is the voice?' His only answer was
a sigh. Suddenly, a hot breath passed over my face and I
perceived a white shape, beside the man's black shape, in the
darkness. The black shape lifted me on to the white shape, a glad
neighing greeted my astounded ears and I murmured, 'César!' The
animal quivered. Raoul, I was lying half back on a saddle and I
had recognized the white horse out of the <i>Profeta</i>, which
I had so often fed with sugar and sweets. I remembered that, one
evening, there was a rumor in the theater that the horse had
disappeared arid that it had been stolen by the Opera ghost. I
believed in the voice, but had never believed in the ghost. Now,
however, I began to wonder, with a shiver, whether I was the
ghost's prisoner. I called upon the voice to help me, for I
should never have imagined that the voice and the ghost were one.
You have heard about the Opera ghost, have you not, Raoul?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but tell me what happened when you were on the white
horse of the <i>Profeta</i>?"</p>

<p>"I made no movement and let myself go. The black shape held me
up, and I made no effort to escape. A curious feeling of
peacefulness came over me and I thought that I must be under the
influence of some cordial. I had the full command of my senses;
and my eyes became used to the darkness, which was lit, here and
there, by fitful gleams. I calculated that we were in a narrow
circular gallery, probably running all round the Opera, which is
immense, underground. I had once been down into those cellars,
but had stopped at the third floor, though there were two lower
still, large enough to hold a town. But the figures of which I
caught sight had made me run away. There are demons down there,
quite black, standing in front of boilers, and they wield shovels
and pitchforks and poke up fires and stir up flames and, if you
come too near them, they frighten you by suddenly opening the red
mouths of their furnaces.... Well, while César was quietly
carrying me on his back, I saw those black demons in the
distance, looking quite small, in front of the red fires of their
furnaces: they came into sight, disappeared and came into sight
again, as we went on our winding way. At last, they disappeared
altogether. The shape was still holding me up and César walked
on, unled and sure-footed. I could not tell you, even
approximately, how long this ride lasted; I only know that we
seemed to turn and turn and often went down a spiral stair into
the very heart of the earth. Even then, it may be that my head
was turning, but I don't think so: no, my mind was quite clear.
At last, César raised his nostrils, sniffed the air and quickened
his pace a little. I felt a moistness in the air and César
stopped. The darkness had lifted. A sort of bluey light
surrounded us. We were on the edge of a lake, whose leaden waters
stretched into the distance, into the darkness; but the blue
light lit up the bank and I saw a little boat fastened to an iron
ring on the wharf!"</p>

<p>"A boat!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I knew that all that existed and that there was
nothing supernatural about that underground lake and boat. But
think of the exceptional conditions in which I arrived upon that
shore! I don't know whether the effects of the cordial had worn
off when the man's shape lifted me into the boat, but my terror
began all over again. My gruesome escort must have noticed it,
for he sent César back and I heard his hoofs trampling up a
staircase while the man jumped into the boat, untied the rope
that held it and seized the oars. He rowed with a quick, powerful
stroke; and his eyes, under the mask, never left me. We slipped
across the noiseless water in the bluey light which I told you
of; then we were in the dark again and we touched shore. And I
was once more taken up in the man's arms. I cried aloud. And
then, suddenly, I was silent, dazed by the light.... Yes, a
dazzling light in the midst of which I had been put down. I
sprang to my feet. I was in the middle of a drawing-room that
seemed to me to be decorated, adorned and furnished with nothing
but flowers, flowers both magnificent and stupid, because of the
silk ribbons that tied them to baskets, like those which they
sell in the shops on the boulevards. They were much too civilized
flowers, like those which I used to find in my dressing-room
after a first night. And, in the midst of all these flowers,
stood the black shape of the man in the mask, with arms crossed,
and he said, 'Don't be afraid, Christine; you are in no danger.'
<i>It was the voice!</i></p>

<p>"My anger equaled my amazement. I rushed at the mask and tried
to snatch it away, so as to see the face of the voice. The man
said, 'You are in no danger, so long as you do not touch the
mask.' And, taking me gently by the wrists, he forced me into a
chair and then went down on his knees before me and said nothing
more! His humility gave me back some of my courage; and the light
restored me to the realities of life. However extraordinary the
adventure might be, I was now surrounded by mortal, visible,
tangible things. The furniture, the hangings, the candles, the
vases and the very flowers in their baskets, of which I could
almost have told whence they came and what they cost, were bound
to confine my imagination to the limits of a drawing-room quite
as commonplace as any that, at least, had the excuse of not being
in the cellars of the Opera. I had, no doubt, to do with a
terrible, eccentric person, who, in some mysterious fashion, had
succeeded in taking up his abode there, under the Opera house,
five stories below the level of the ground. And the voice, the
voice which I had recognized under the mask, was on its knees
before me, <i>was a man!</i>  And I began to cry.... The man,
still kneeling, must have understood the cause of my tears, for
he said, 'It is true, Christine!... I am not an Angel, nor a
genius, nor a ghost... I am Erik!'"</p>

<p>Christine's narrative was again interrupted. An echo behind
them seemed to repeat the word after her.</p>

<p>"Erik!"</p>

<p>What echo?... They both turned round and saw that night had
fallen. Raoul made a movement as though to rise, but Christine
kept him beside her.</p>

<p>"Don't go," she said. "I want you to know everything
<i>here!</i>"</p>

<p>"But why here, Christine? I am afraid of your catching
cold."</p>

<p>"We have nothing to fear except the trap-doors, dear,
and here we are miles away from the trap-doors... and I
am not allowed to see you outside the theater. This is not the
time to annoy him. We must not arouse his suspicion."</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine! Something tells me that we are wrong to
wait till to-morrow evening and that we ought to fly at
once."</p>

<p>"I tell you that, if he does not hear me sing tomorrow, it
will cause him infinite pain."</p>

<p>"It is difficult not to cause him pain and yet to escape from
him for good."</p>

<p>"You are right in that, Raoul, for certainly he will die of my
flight." And she added in a dull voice, "But then it counts both
ways . . for we risk his killing us."</p>

<p>"Does he love you so much?"</p>

<p>"He would commit murder for me."</p>

<p>"But one can find out where he lives. One can go in search of
him. Now that we know that Erik is not a ghost, one can speak to
him and force him to answer!"</p>

<p>Christine shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, no! There is nothing to be done with Erik, except to run
away!"</p>

<p>"Then why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to
him?"</p>

<p>"Because I had to. And you will understand that when I tell
you how I left him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate him!" cried Raoul. "And you, Christine, tell me,
do you hate him too?"</p>

<p>"No," said Christine simply.</p>

<p>"No, of course not.... Why, you love him! Your fear, your
terror, all of that is just love and love of the most exquisite
kind, the kind which people do not admit even to themselves,"
said Raoul bitterly. "The kind that gives you a thrill, when you
think of it.... Picture it: a man who lives in a palace
underground!" And he gave a leer.</p>

<p>"Then you want me to go back there?" said the young girl
cruelly. "Take care, Raoul; I have told you: I should never
return!"</p>

<p>There was an appalling silence between the three of them: the
two who spoke and the shadow that listened, behind them.</p>

<p>"Before answering that," said Raoul, at last, speaking very
slowly, "I should like to know with what feeling he inspires you,
since you do not hate him."</p>

<p>"With horror!" she said. "That is the terrible thing about it.
He fills me with horror 'and I do not hate him. How can I hate
him, Raoul? Think of Erik at my feet, in the house on the lake,
underground. He accuses himself, he curses himself, he implores
my forgiveness!... He confesses his cheat. He loves me! He lays
at my feet an immense and tragic love.... He has carried me off
for love!... He has imprisoned me with him, underground, for
love!... But he respects me: he crawls, he moans, he weeps!...
And, when I stood up, Raoul, and told him that I could only
despise him if he did not, then and there, give me my liberty...
he offered it... he offered to show me the mysterious road.
Only... only he rose too... and I was made to remember that,
though he was not an angel, nor a ghost, nor a genius, he
remained the voice... for he sang. And I listened... and
stayed!... That night, we did not exchange another word. He sang
me to sleep.</p>

<p>"When I woke up, I was alone, lying on a sofa in a simply
furnished little bedroom, with an ordinary mahogany bedstead, lit
by a lamp standing on the marble top of an old Louis-Philippe
chest of drawers. I soon discovered that I was a prisoner and
that the only outlet from my room led to a very comfortable
bath-room. On returning to the bedroom, I saw on the chest of
drawers a note, in red ink, which said, 'My dear Christine, you
need have no concern as to your fate. You have no better nor more
respectful friend in the world than myself. You are alone, at
present, in this home which is yours. I am going out shopping to
fetch you all the things that you can need.' I felt sure that I
had fallen into the hands of a madman. I ran round my little
apartment, looking for a way of escape which I could not find. I
upbraided myself for my absurd superstition, which had caused me
to fall into the trap. I felt inclined to laugh and to cry at the
same time.</p>

<p>"This was the state of mind in which Erik found me. After
giving three taps on the wall, he walked in quietly through a
door which I had not noticed and which he left open. He had his
arms full of boxes and parcels and arranged them on the bed,
in a leisurely fashion, while I overwhelmed him with abuse and
called upon him to take off his mask, if it covered the face of
an honest man. He replied serenely, 'You shall never see Erik's
face.' And he reproached me with not having finished dressing at
that time of day: he was good enough to tell me that it was two
o'clock in the afternoon. He said he would give me half an hour
and, while he spoke, wound up my watch and set it for me. After
which, he asked me to come to the dining-room, where a nice
lunch was waiting for us.</p>

<p>"I was very angry, slammed the door in his face and went to
the bath-room.... When I came out again, feeling greatly
refreshed, Erik said that he loved me, but that he would never
tell me so except when I allowed him and that the rest of the
time would be devoted to music. 'What do you mean by the rest of
the time?' I asked. 'Five days,' he said, with decision. I asked
him if I should then be free and he said, 'You will be free,
Christine, for, when those five days are past, you will have
learned not to see me; and then, from time to time, you will come
to see your poor Erik!' He pointed to a chair opposite him, at a
small table, and I sat down, feeling greatly perturbed. However,
I ate a few prawns and the wing of a chicken and drank half a
glass of tokay, which he had himself, he told me, brought from
the Königsberg cellars. Erik did not eat or drink. I asked him
what his nationality was and if that name of Erik did not point
to his Scandinavian origin. He said that he had no name and no
country and that he had taken the name of Erik by accident.</p>

<p>"After lunch, he rose and gave me the tips of his fingers,
saying he would like to show me over his flat; but I snatched
away my hand and gave a cry. What I had touched was cold and, at
the same time, bony; and I remembered that his hands smelt of
death. 'Oh. forgive me!' he moaned. And he opened a door before
me. 'This is my bedroom, if you care to see it. It is rather
curious.' His manners, his words, his attitude gave me confidence
and I went in without hesitation. I felt as if I were entering
the room of a dead person. The walls were all hung with black,
but, instead of the white trimmings that usually set off that
funereal upholstery, there was an enormous stave of music with
the notes of the <i>Dies Irae</i>  many times repeated. In the
middle of the room was a canopy, from which hung curtains of red
brocaded stuff, and, under the canopy, an open coffin. 'That is
where I sleep,' said Erik. 'One has to get used to everything in
life, even to eternity.' The sight upset me so much that I turned
away my head.</p>

<p>"Then I saw the keyboard of an organ which filled one whole
side of the walls. On the desk was a music-book covered with red
notes. I asked leave to look at it and read, <i>'Don Juan
Triumphant'</i>  'Yes,' he said, 'I compose sometimes. I began
that work twenty years ago. When I have finished, I shall take it
away with me in that coffin and never wake up again.' 'You must
work at it as seldom as you can,' I said. He replied, 'I
sometimes work at it for fourteen days and nights together,
during which I live on music only, and then I rest for years at a
time.' 'Will you play me something out of your <i>Don Juan
Triumphant</i>?' I asked, thinking to please him. 'You must never
ask me that,' he said, in a gloomy voice. 'I will play you
Mozart, if you like, which will only make you weep; but my <i>Don
Juan</i>, Christine, burns; and yet he is not struck by fire from
Heaven.' Thereupon we returned to the drawing-room. I noticed
that there was no mirror in the whole apartment. I was going to
remark upon this, but Erik had already sat down to the piano. He
said, 'You see, Christine, there is some music that is so
terrible that it consumes all those who approach it. Fortunately,
you have not come to that music yet, for you would lose all your
pretty coloring and nobody would know you when you returned to
Paris. Let us sing something from the Opera, Christine Daaé.' He
spoke these last words as though he were flinging an insult at
me."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I had no time to think about the meaning he put into his
words. We at once began the duet in <i>Othello</i>  and already
the catastrophe was upon us. I sang <i>Desdemona</i>  with a
despair, a terror which I had never displayed before. As for him,
his voice thundered forth his revengeful soul at every note.
Love, jealousy, hatred, burst out around us in harrowing cries.
Erik's black mask made me think of the natural mask of the Moor
of Venice. He was Othello himself. Suddenly, I felt a need to see
beneath the mask. I wanted to know the <i>face</i>  of the voice,
and, with a movement which I was utterly unable to control, swiftly
my fingers tore away the mask. Oh, horror, horror, horror!"</p>

<p>Christine stopped, at the thought of the vision that had
scared her, while the echoes of the night, which had repeated the
name of Erik, now thrice moaned the cry:</p>

<p>"Horror!... Horror!... Horror!"</p>

<p>Raoul and Christine, clasping each other closely, raised their
eyes to the stars that shone in a clear and peaceful sky. Raoul
said:</p>

<p>"Strange, Christine, that this calm, soft night should be so
full of plaintive sounds. One would think that it was sorrowing
with us."</p>

<p>"When you know the secret, Raoul, your ears, like mine, will
be full of lamentations."</p>

<p>She took Raoul's protecting hands in hers and, with a long
shiver, continued:</p>

<p>"Yes, if I lived to be a hundred, I should always hear the
superhuman cry of grief and rage which he uttered when the
terrible sight appeared before my eyes.... Raoul, you have seen
death's heads, when they have been dried and withered by the
centuries, and, perhaps, if you were not the victim of a
nightmare, you saw <i>his</i>  death's head at Perros. And then
you saw Red Death stalking about at the last masked ball. But all
those death's heads were motionless and their dumb horror was not
alive. But imagine, if you can, Red Death's mask suddenly coming
to life in order to express, with the four black holes of its
eyes, its nose, and its mouth, the extreme anger, the mighty fury
of a demon; <i>and not a ray of light from the sockets</i>, for,
as I learned later, you can not see his blazing eyes except in
the dark....</p>

<p>"I fell back against the wall and he came up to me, grinding
his teeth, and, as I fell upon my knees, he hissed mad,
incoherent words and curses at me. Leaning over me, he cried,
'Look! You want to see! See! Feast your eyes, glut your soul on
my cursed ugliness! Look at Erik's face! Now you know the face of
the voice! You were not content to hear me, eh? You wanted to
know what I looked like! Oh, you women are so inquisitive! Well,
are you satisfied? I'm a very good-looking fellow, eh? When a
woman has seen me, as you have, she belongs to me. She loves me
for ever. I am a kind of Don Juan, you know!' And, drawing
himself up to his full height, with his hand on his hip, wagging
the hideous thing that was his head on his shoulders, he roared,
'Look at me! <i>I am Don Juan triumphant</i>.' And, when I turned
away my head and begged for mercy, he drew it to him, brutally,
twisting his dead fingers into my hair."</p>

<p>"Enough! Enough!" cried Raoul. "I will kill him. In Heaven's
name, Christine, tell me where the dining-room on the lake is! I
must kill him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet, Raoul, if you want to know!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I want to know how and why you went back; I must
know!... But, in any case, I will kill him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Raoul, listen, listen!... He dragged me by my hair and
then... and then... Oh, it is too horrible!"</p>

<p>"Well, what? Out with it!" exclaimed Raoul fiercely. "Out with
it, quick!"</p>

<p>"Then he hissed at me. 'Ah, I frighten you, do I?... I dare
say!... Perhaps you think that I have another mask, eh, and
that this... this... my head is a mask? Well&mdash;' he roared,
'tear it off as you did the other! Come! Come along! I insist!
Your hands! Your hands! Give me your hands!' And he seized my
hands and dug them into his awful face. He tore his flesh with
my nails, tore his terrible dead flesh with my nails!... 'Know,'
he shouted, while his throat throbbed and panted like a furnace,
'know that I am built up of death from head to foot and that
it is a corpse that loves you and adores you and will never,
never leave you!... Look, I am not laughing now, I am crying,
crying for you, Christine, who have torn off my mask and who
therefore can never leave me again!... As long as you thought me
handsome, you could have come back, I know you would have come
back... but, now that you know my hideousness, you would run
away for good.... So I shall keep you here!... Why did you want
to see me? Oh, mad Christine, who wanted to see me!... When my
own father never saw me and when my mother, so as not to see me,
made me a present of my first mask!'</p>

<p>"He had let go of me at last and was dragging himself
about on the floor, uttering terrible sobs. And then
he crawled away like a snake, went into his room, closed the door
and left me alone to my reflections. Presently I heard the sound
of the organ; and then I began to understand Erik's contemptuous
phrase when he spoke about Opera music. What I now heard was
utterly different from what I had heard up to then. His <i>Don
Juan Triumphant</i>  (for I had not a doubt but that he had
rushed to his masterpiece to forget the horror of the moment)
seemed to me at first one long, awful, magnificent sob. But,
little by little, it expressed every emotion, every suffering of
which mankind is capable. It intoxicated me; and I opened the
door that separated us. Erik rose, as I entered, <i>but dared not
turn in my direction</i>. 'Erik,' I cried, 'show me your face
without fear! I swear that you are the most unhappy and sublime
of men; and, if ever again I shiver when I look at you, it will
be because I am thinking of the splendor of your genius!' Then
Erik turned round, for he believed me, and I also had faith in
myself. He fell at my feet, with words of love . . with words of
love in his dead mouth... and the music had ceased... He kissed
the hem of my dress and did not see that I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>"What more can I tell you, dear? You now know the tragedy. It
went on for a fortnight&mdash;a fortnight during which I lied to
him. My lies were as hideous as the monster who inspired them;
but they were the price of my liberty. I burned his mask; and I
managed so well that, even when he was not singing, he tried to
catch my eye, like a dog sitting by its master. He was my
faithful slave and paid me endless little attentions. Gradually,
I gave him such confidence that he ventured to take me walking on
the banks of the lake and to row me in the boat on its leaden
waters; toward the end of my captivity he let me out through the
gates that closed the underground passages in the Rue Scribe.
Here a carriage awaited us and took us to the Bois. The night
when we met you was nearly fatal to me, for he is terribly
jealous of you and I had to tell him that you were soon going
away.... Then, at last, after a fortnight of that horrible
captivity, during which I was filled with pity, enthusiasm,
despair and horror by turns, he believed me when I said, <i>'I
will come back!'</i>"</p>

<p>"And you went back, Christine," groaned Raoul.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, and I must tell you that it was not his frightful
threats when setting me free that helped me to keep my word, but
the harrowing sob which he gave on the threshold of the tomb....
That sob attached me to the unfortunate man more than I myself
suspected when saying good-by to him. Poor Erik! Poor Erik!"</p>

<p>"Christine," said Raoul, rising, "you tell me that you love
me; but you had recovered your liberty hardly a few hours before
you returned to Erik! Remember the masked ball!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and do you remember those hours which I passed with you,
Raoul... to the great danger of both of us?"</p>

<p>"I doubted your love for me, during those hours."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt it still, Raoul?... Then know that each of my
visits to Erik increased my horror of him; for each of those
visits, instead of calming him, as I hoped, made him mad with
love! . . And I am so frightened, so frightened!..."</p>

<p>"You are frightened... but do you love me? If Erik were
good-looking, would you love me, Christine?"</p>

<p>She rose in her turn, put her two trembling arms round the
young man's neck and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, my betrothed of a day, if I did not love you, I would not
give you my lips! Take them, for the first time and the
last."</p>

<p>He kissed her lips; but the night that surrounded them was
rent asunder, they fled as at the approach of a storm and their
eyes, filled with dread of Erik, showed them, before they
disappeared, high up above them, an immense night-bird that
stared at them with its blazing eyes and seemed to cling to the
string of Apollo's lyre.</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A MASTER-STROKE OF THE TRAP-DOOR LOVER</h3>

<p class="first">RAOUL and Christine ran, eager to escape from the roof and the
blazing eyes that showed only in the dark; and they did not stop
before they came to the eighth floor on the way down.</p>

<p>There was no performance at the Opera that night and the
passages were empty. Suddenly, a queer-looking form stood before
them and blocked the road:</p>

<p>"No, not this way!"</p>

<p>And the form pointed to another passage by which they were to
reach the wings. Raoul wanted to stop and ask for an explanation.
But the form, which wore a sort of long frock-coat and a pointed
cap, said: "Quick! Go away quickly!"</p>

<p>Christine was already dragging Raoul, compelling him to start
running again.</p>

<p>"But who is he? Who is that man?" he asked.</p>

<p>Christine replied: "It's the Persian."</p>

<p>"What's he doing here?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows. He is always in the Opera."</p>

<p>"You are making me run away, for the first time in my life. If
we really saw Erik, what I ought to have done was to nail him to
Apollo's lyre, just as we nail the owls to the walls of our
Breton farms; and there would have been no more question of
him."</p>

<p>"My dear Raoul, you would first have had to climb up to
Apollo's lyre: that is no easy matter."</p>

<p>"The blazing eyes were there!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you are getting like me now, seeing him everywhere! What
I took for blazing eyes was probably a couple of stars shining
through the strings of the lyre."</p>

<p>And Christine went down another floor, with Raoul following
her.</p>

<p>"As you have quite made up your mind to go, Christine, I
assure you it would be better to go at once. Why wait for
to-morrow? He may have heard us to-night."</p>

<p>"No, no, he is working, I tell you, at his <i>Don Juan
Triumphant</i>  and not thinking of us."</p>

<p>"You're so sure of that you keep on looking behind you!"</p>

<p>"Come to my dressing-room."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better meet outside the Opera?"</p>

<p>"Never, till we go away for good! It would bring us bad luck,
if I did not keep my word. I promised him to see you only
here."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing for me that he allowed you even that. Do
you know," said Raoul bitterly, "that it was very plucky of you
to let us play at being engaged?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear, he knows all about it! He said, 'I trust you,
Christine. M. de Chagny is in love with you and is going abroad.
Before he goes, I want him to be as happy as I am.' Are people so
unhappy when they love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Christine, when they love and are not sure of being
loved."</p>

<p>They came to Christine's dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Why do you think that you are safer in this room than on the
stage?" asked Raoul. "You heard him through the walls here,
therefore he can certainly hear us."</p>

<p>"No. He gave me his word not to be behind the walls of my
dressing-room again and I believe Erik's word. This room and my
bedroom on the lake are for me, exclusively, and not to be
approached by him."</p>

<p>"How can you have gone from this room into that dark passage,
Christine? Suppose we try to repeat your movements; shall
we?"</p>

<p>"It is dangerous, dear, for the glass might carry me off
again; and, instead of running away, I should be obliged to go to
the end of the secret passage to the lake and there call
Erik."</p>

<p>"Would he hear you?"</p>

<p>"Erik will hear me wherever I call him. He told me so. He is a
very curious genius. You must not think, Raoul, that he is simply
a man who amuses himself by living underground. He does things
that no other man could do; he knows things which nobody in the
world knows."</p>

<p>"Take care, Christine, you are making a ghost of him
again!"</p>

<p>"No, he is not a ghost; he is a man of Heaven and earth, that
is all."</p>

<p>"A man of Heaven and earth, that is all! A nice way to speak
of him!... And are you still resolved to run away from him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, you will have no resolve left!"</p>

<p>"Then, Raoul, you must run away with me in spite of myself; is
that understood?"</p>

<p>"I shall be here at twelve to-morrow night; I shall keep my
promise, whatever happens. You say that, after listening to the
performance, he is to wait for you in the dining-room on the
lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And how are you to reach him, if you don't know how to go out
by the glass?"</p>

<p>"Why, by going straight to the edge of the lake,"</p>

<p>Christine opened a box, took out an enormous key and showed it
to Raoul. "What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The key of the gate to the underground passage in the Rue
Scribe."</p>

<p>"I understand, Christine. It leads straight to the lake. Give
it to me, Christine, will you?"</p>

<p>"Never!" she said. "That would be treacherous!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Christine changed color. A mortal pallor overspread
her features.</p>

<p>"Oh heavens!" she cried. "Erik! Erik! Have pity on me!"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" said Raoul. "You told me he could hear
you!"</p>

<p>But the singer's attitude became more and more inexplicable.
She wrung her fingers, repeating, with a distraught air:</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven! Oh, Heaven!"</p>

<p>"But what is it? What is it?" Raoul implored.</p>

<p>"The ring... the gold ring he gave me."</p>

<p>"Oh, so Erik gave you that ring!"</p>

<p>"You know he did, Raoul! But what you don't know is that, when
he gave it to me, he said, 'I give you back your liberty,
Christine, on condition that this ring is always on your finger.
As long as you keep it, you will be protected against all danger
and Erik will remain your friend. But woe to you if you ever part
with it, for Erik will have his revenge!... My dear, my dear, the
ring is gone!... Woe to us both!"</p>

<p>They both looked for the ring, but could not find it.
Christine refused to be pacified.</p>

<p>"It was while I gave you that kiss, up above, under
Apollo's lyre," she said. "The ring must have slipped
from my finger and dropped into the street! We can
never find it. And what misfortunes are in store for
us now! Oh, to run away!"</p>

<p>"Let us run away at once," Raoul insisted, once more.</p>

<p>She hesitated. He thought that she was going to say yes....
Then her bright pupils became dimmed and she said:</p>

<p>"No! To-morrow!"</p>

<p>And she left him hurriedly, still wringing and rubbing her
fingers, as though she hoped to bring the ring back like
that.</p>

<p>Raoul went home, greatly perturbed at all that he had
heard.</p>

<p>"If I don't save her from the hands of that humbug," he said,
aloud, as he went to bed, "she is lost. But I shall save
her."</p>

<p>He put out his lamp and felt a need to insult Erik in the
dark. Thrice over, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Humbug!... Humbug!... Humbug!..."</p>

<p>But, suddenly, he raised himself on his elbow. A cold sweat
poured from his temples. Two eyes, like blazing coals, had
appeared at the foot of his bed. They stared at him fixedly,
terribly, in the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Raoul was no coward; and yet he trembled. He put out a
groping, hesitating hand toward the table by his bedside. He
found the matches and lit his candle. The eyes disappeared.</p>

<p>Still uneasy in his mind, he thought to himself: "She told me
that <i>his</i>  eyes only showed in the dark. His eyes have
disappeared in the light, but <i>he</i>  may be there still."</p>

<p>And he rose, hunted about, went round the room. He looked
under his bed, like a child. Then he thought himself absurd, got
into bed again and blew out the candle. The eyes reappeared.</p>

<p>He sat up and stared back at them with all the courage he
possessed. Then he cried:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Erik? Man, genius, or ghost, is it you?"</p>

<p>He reflected: "If it's he, he's on the balcony!" Then he ran
to the chest of drawers and groped for his revolver. He opened
the balcony window, looked out, saw nothing and closed the
window again. He went back to bed, shivering, for the night was
cold, and put the revolver on the table within his reach.</p>

<p>The eyes were still there, at the foot of the bed. Were they
between the bed and the window-pane or behind the pane, that is
to say, on the balcony? That was what Raoul wanted to know. He
also wanted to know if those eyes belonged to a human being....
He wanted to know everything.</p>

<p>Then, patiently, calmly, he seized his revolver and took aim.
He aimed a little above the two eyes. Surely, if they were eyes
and if above those two eyes there was a forehead and if Raoul was
not too clumsy....</p>

<p>The shot made a terrible din amid the silence of the
slumbering house. And, while footsteps came hurrying along the
passages, Raoul sat up with outstretched arm, ready to fire
again, if need be.</p>

<p>This time, the two eyes had disappeared.</p>

<p>Servants appeared, carrying lights; Count Philippe, terribly
anxious:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I think I have been dreaming," replied the young man. "I
fired at two stars that kept me from sleeping."</p>

<p>"You're raving! Are you ill? For God's sake, tell me,
Raoul: what happened?"</p>

<p>And the count seized hold of the revolver.</p>

<p>"No, no, I'm not raving... Besides, we shall soon see..."</p>

<p>He got out of bed, put on a dressing-gown and slippers, took a
light from the hands of a servant and, opening the window,
stepped out on the balcony.</p>

<p>The count saw that the window had been pierced by a bullet at
a man's height. Raoul was leaning over the balcony with his
candle:</p>

<p>"Aha!" he said. "Blood!... Blood!... Here, there, more
blood!... That's a good thing! A ghost who bleeds is less
dangerous!" he grinned.</p>

<p>"Raoul! Raoul! Raoul!"</p>

<p>The count was shaking him as though he were trying to waken a
sleep-walker.</p>

<p>"But, my dear brother, I'm not asleep!" Raoul protested
impatiently. "You can see the blood for yourself. I thought I had
been dreaming and firing at two stars. It was Erik's eyes... and
here is his blood!... After all, perhaps I was wrong to shoot;
and Christine is quite capable of never forgiving me.... All this
would not have happened if I had drawn the curtains before going
to bed."</p>

<p>"Raoul, have you suddenly gone mad? Wake up!"</p>

<p>"What, still? You would do better to help me find Erik... for,
after all, a ghost who bleeds can always be found."</p>

<p>The count's valet said:</p>

<p>"That is so, sir; there is blood on the balcony." The other
man-servant brought a lamp, by the light of which they examined
the balcony carefully. The marks of blood followed the rail till
they reached a gutter-spout; then they went up the
gutter-spout.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Count Philippe, "you have fired at a
cat."</p>

<p>"The misfortune is," said Raoul, with a grin, "that it's quite
possible. With Erik, you never know. Is it Erik? Is it the cat?
Is it the ghost? No, with Erik, you can't tell!"</p>

<p>Raoul went on making this strange sort of remarks which
corresponded so intimately and logically with the preoccupation
of his brain and which, at the same time, tended to persuade many
people that his mind was unhinged. The count himself was seized
with this idea; and, later, the examining magistrate, on
receiving the report of the commissary of police, came to the
same conclusion.</p>

<p>"Who is Erik?" asked the count, pressing his brother's
hand.</p>

<p>"He is my rival. And, if he's not dead, it's a pity."</p>

<p>He dismissed the servants with a wave of the hand and the two
Chagnys were left alone. But the men were not out of earshot
before the count's valet heard Raoul say, distinctly and
emphatically:</p>

<p>"I shall carry off Christine Daaé to-night."</p>

<p>This phrase was afterward repeated to M. Faure, the
examining-magistrate. But no one ever knew exactly what passed
between the two brothers at this interview. The servants declared
that this was not their first quarrel. Their voices penetrated
the wall; and it was always an actress called Christine Daaé that
was in question.</p>

<p>At breakfast&mdash;the early morning breakfast, which the
count took in his study&mdash;Philippe sent for his brother.
Raoul arrived silent and gloomy. The scene was a very short one.
Philippe handed his brother a copy of the <i>Époque</i>  and
said:</p>

<p>"Read that!"</p>

<p>The viscount read:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"The latest news in the Faubourg is that there is a promise of
marriage between Mlle. Christine Daaé, the opera-singer, and M.
le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny. If the gossips are to be credited,
Count Philippe has sworn that, for the first time on record, the
Chagnys shall not keep their promise. But, as love is
all-powerful, at the Opera as&mdash;and even more
than&mdash;elsewhere, we wonder how Count Philippe intends to
prevent the viscount, his brother, from leading the new Margarita
to the altar. The two brothers are said to adore each other; but
the count is curiously mistaken if he imagines that brotherly
love will triumph over love pure and simple."</p>

<br>

<p>"You see, Raoul," said the count, "you are making us
ridiculous! That little girl has turned your head with her
ghost-stories."</p>

<p>The viscount had evidently repeated Christine's narrative to
his brother, during the night. All that he now said was:</p>

<p>"Good-by, Philippe."</p>

<p>"Have you quite made up your mind? You are going to-night?
With her?" No reply.</p>

<p>"Surely you will not do anything so foolish? I <i>shall</i>
know how to prevent you!"</p>

<p>"Good-by, Philippe," said the viscount again and left the
room.</p>

<p>This scene was described to the examining-magistrate by the
count himself, who did not see Raoul again until that evening, at
the Opera, a few minutes before Christine's disappearance.</p>

<p>Raoul, in fact, devoted the whole day to his preparations for
the flight. The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the
provisions, the luggage, the money required for the journey, the
road to be taken (he had resolved not to go by train, so as to
throw the ghost off the scent): all this had to be settled and
provided for; and it occupied him until nine o'clock at
night.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock, a sort of traveling-barouche with the
curtains of its windows close-down, took its place in the rank on
the Rotunda side. It was drawn by two powerful horses driven by a
coachman whose face was almost concealed in the long folds of a
muffler. In front of this traveling-carriage were three
broughams, belonging respectively to Carlotta, who had suddenly
returned to Paris, to Sorelli and, at the head of the rank, to
Comte Philippe de Chagny. No one left the barouche. The coachman
remained on his box, and the three other coachmen remained on
theirs.</p>

<p>A shadow in a long black cloak and a soft black felt hat
passed along the pavement between the Rotunda and the carriages,
examined the barouche carefully, went up to the horses and the
coachman and then moved away without saying a word. The
magistrate afterward believed that this shadow was that of the
Vicomte Raoul de Chagny; but I do not agree, seeing that that
evening, as every evening, the Vicomte de Chagny was wearing a
tall hat, which hat, besides, was subsequently found. I am more
inclined to think that the shadow was that of the ghost, who knew
all about the whole affair, as the reader will soon perceive.</p>

<p>They were giving <i>Faust</i>, as it happened, before a
splendid house. The Faubourg was magnificently represented; and
the paragraph in that morning's <i>Époque</i>  had already
produced its effect, for all eyes were turned to the box in which
Count Philippe sat alone, apparently in a very indifferent and
careless frame of mind. The feminine element in the brilliant
audience seemed curiously puzzled; and the viscount's absence
gave rise to any amount of whispering behind the fans. Christine
Daaé met with a rather cold reception. That special audience
could not forgive her for aiming so high.</p>

<p>The singer noticed this unfavorable attitude of a portion of
the house and was confused by it.</p>

<p>The regular frequenters of the Opera, who pretended to know
the truth about the viscount's love-story, exchanged significant
smiles at certain passages in Margarita's part; and they made a
show of turning and looking at Philippe de Chagny's box when
Christine sang:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"I wish I could but know who was he<br>
That addressed me,<br>
If he was noble, or, at least, what his name is."</p>

<br>

<p>The count sat with his chin on his hand and seemed to pay no
attention to these manifestations. He kept his eyes fixed on the
stage; but his thoughts appeared to be far away.</p>

<p>Christine lost her self-assurance more and more. She trembled.
She felt on the verge of a breakdown.... Carolus Fonta wondered
if she was ill, if she could keep the stage until the end of the
Garden Act. In the front of the house, people remembered the
catastrophe that had befallen Carlotta at the end of that act and
the historic "cr-ack" which had momentarily interrupted her
career in Paris.</p>

<p>Just then, Carlotta made her entrance in a box facing the
stage, a sensational entrance. Poor Christine raised her eyes
upon this fresh subject of excitement. She recognized her rival.
She thought she saw a sneer on her lips. That saved her. She
forgot everything, in order to triumph once more.</p>

<p>From that moment the prima donna sang with all her heart and
soul. She tried to surpass all that she had done till then; and
she succeeded. In the last act when she began the invocation to
the angels, she made all the members of the audience feel as
though they too had wings.</p>

<p>In the center of the amphitheater a man stood up and remained
standing, facing the singer. It was Raoul.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Holy angel, in Heaven blessed....</p>

<br>

<p>And Christine, her arms outstretched, her throat filled with
music, the glory of her hair falling over her bare shoulders,
uttered the divine cry:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"My spirit longs with thee to rest!"</p>

<br>

<p>It was at that moment that the stage was suddenly plunged in
darkness. It happened so quickly that the spectators hardly had
time to utter a sound of stupefaction, for the gas at once lit up
the stage again. But Christine Daaé was no longer there!</p>

<p>What had become of her? What was that miracle? All exchanged
glances without understanding, and the excitement at once reached
its height. Nor was the tension any less great on the stage
itself. Men rushed from the wings to the spot where Christine had
been singing that very instant. The performance was interrupted
amid the greatest disorder.</p>

<p>Where had Christine gone? What witchcraft had snatched her
away before the eyes of thousands of enthusiastic onlookers and
from the arms of Carolus Fonta himself? It was as though the
angels had really carried her up "to rest."</p>

<p>Raoul, still standing up in the amphitheater, had uttered a
cry. Count Philippe had sprung to his feet r in his box. People
looked at the stage, at the count, at Raoul, and wondered if this
curious event was connected in any way with the paragraph in that
morning's paper. But Raoul hurriedly left his seat, the count
disappeared from his box and, while the curtain was lowered, the
subscribers rushed to the door that led behind the scenes. The
rest of the audience waited amid an indescribable hubbub. Every
one spoke at once. Every one tried to suggest an explanation
of the extraordinary incident.</p>

<p>At last, the curtain rose slowly and Carolus Fonta stepped to
the conductor's desk and, in a sad and serious voice, said:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, an unprecedented event has taken place
and thrown us into a state of the greatest alarm. Our
sister-artist, Christine Daaé, has disappeared before our eyes
and nobody can tell us how!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE SINGULAR ATTITUDE OF A SAFETY-PIN</h3>

<p class="first">
BEHIND the curtain, there was an indescribable crowd. Artists,
scene-shifters, dancers, supers, choristers, subscribers were all
asking questions, shouting and hustling one another.</p>

<p>"What became of her?"</p>

<p>"She's run away."</p>

<p>"With the Vicomte de Chagny, of course!"</p>

<p>"No, with the count!"</p>

<p>"Ah, here's Carlotta! Carlotta did the trick!"</p>

<p>"No, it was the ghost!"</p>

<p>And a few laughed, especially as a careful examination of the
trap-doors and boards had put the idea of an accident out of the
question.</p>

<p>Amid this noisy throng, three men stood talking in a low voice
and with despairing gestures. They were Gabriel, the
chorus-master; Mercier, the acting-manager; and Rémy, the
secretary. They retired to a corner of the lobby by which the
stage communicates with the wide passage leading to the foyer of
the ballet. Here they stood and argued behind some enormous
"properties."</p>

<p>"I knocked at the door," said Rémy. "They did not answer.
Perhaps they are not in the office. In any case, it's impossible
to find out, for they took the keys with them."</p>

<p>"They" were obviously the managers, who had given orders,
during the last entr'acte, that they were not to be disturbed on
any pretext whatever. They were not in to anybody.</p>

<p>"All the same," exclaimed Gabriel, "a singer isn't run away
with, from the middle of the stage, every day!"</p>

<p>"Did you shout that to them?" asked Mercier, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'll go back again," said Rémy, and disappeared at a run.</p>

<p>Thereupon the stage-manager arrived.</p>

<p>"Well, M. Mercier, are you coming? What are you two doing
here? You're wanted, Mr. Acting-Manager."</p>

<p>"I refuse to know or to do anything before the commissary
arrives," declared Mercier. "I have sent for Mifroid. We shall
see when he comes!"</p>

<p>"And I tell you that you ought to go down to the organ at
once."</p>

<p>"Not before the commissary comes."</p>

<p>"I've been down to the organ myself already."</p>

<p>"Ah! And what did you see?"</p>

<p>"Well, I saw nobody! Do you hear&mdash;nobody!"</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do down there for?"</p>

<p>"You're right!" said the stage-manager, frantically pushing
his hands through his rebellious hair. "You're right! But there
might be some one at the organ who could tell us how the stage
came to be suddenly darkened. Now Mauclair is nowhere to be
found. Do you understand that?"</p>

<p>Mauclair was the gas-man, who dispensed day and night at will
on the stage of the Opera.</p>

<p>"Mauclair is not to be found!" repeated Mercier, taken aback.
"Well, what about his assistants?"</p>

<p>"There's no Mauclair and no assistants! No one at the lights,
I tell you! You can imagine," roared the stage-manager, "that
that little girl must have been carried off by somebody else:
she didn't run away by herself! It was a calculated stroke and
we have to find out about it. And what are the managers doing
all this time?... I gave orders that no one was to go down to
the lights and I posted a fireman in front of the gas-man's box
beside the organ. Wasn't that right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, quite right, quite right. And now let's wait for
the commissary."</p>

<p>The stage-manager walked away, shrugging his shoulders,
fuming, muttering insults at those milksops who remained quietly
squatting in a corner while the whole theater was topsyturvy.</p>

<p>Gabriel and Mercier were not so quiet as all that. Only they
had received an order that paralyzed them. The managers were not
to be disturbed on any account. Rémy had violated that order and
met with no success.</p>

<p>At that moment he returned from his new expedition, wearing a
curiously startled air.</p>

<p>"Well, have you seen them?" asked Mercier.</p>

<p>"Moncharmin opened the door at last. His eyes were starting
out of his head. I thought he meant to strike me. I could not
get a word in; and what do you think he shouted at me? 'Have
you a safety-pin?' 'No!' 'Well, then, clear out!' I tried to
tell him that an unheard-of thing had happened on the stage, but
he roared, 'A safety-pin! Give me a safety-pin at once!' A boy
heard him&mdash;he was bellowing like a bull&mdash;ran up with a
safety-pin and gave it to him; whereupon Moncharmin slammed the
door in my face, and there you are!"</p>

<p>"And couldn't you have said, 'Christine Daaé.'"</p>

<p>"I should like to have seen you in my place. He was foaming at
the mouth. He thought of nothing but his safety-pin. I believe,
if they hadn't brought him one on the spot, he would have fallen
down in a fit! . . Oh, all this isn't natural; and our managers
are going mad! . . Besides, it can't go on like this! I'm not
used to being treated in that fashion!"</p>

<p>Suddenly Gabriel whispered:</p>

<p>"It's another trick of O.G.'s."</p>

<p>Rémy gave a grin, Mercier a sigh and seemed about to speak...
but, meeting Gabriel's eye, said nothing.</p>

<p>However, Mercier felt his responsibility increased as the
minutes passed without the managers' appearing; and, at last, he
could stand it no longer.</p>

<p>"Look here, I'll go and hunt them out myself!"</p>

<p>Gabriel, turning very gloomy and serious, stopped him.</p>

<p>"Be careful what you're doing, Mercier! If they're staying in
their office, it's probably because they have to! O.G.
has more than one trick in his bag!"</p>

<p>But Mercier shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's their lookout! I'm going! If people had listened to
me, the police would have known everything long ago!"</p>

<p>And he went.</p>

<p>"What's everything?" asked Rémy. "What was there to tell the
police? Why don't you answer, Gabriel?... Ah, so you know
something! Well, you would do better to tell me, too, if you
don't want me to shout out that you are all going mad! Yes,
that's what you are: mad!"</p>

<p>Gabriel put on a stupid look and pretended not to understand
the private secretary's unseemly outburst.</p>

<p>"What 'something' am I supposed to know?" he said. "I don't
know what you mean."</p>

<p>Rémy began to lose his temper.</p>

<p>"This evening, Richard and Moncharmin were behaving like
lunatics, here, between the acts."</p>

<p>"I never noticed it," growled Gabriel, very much annoyed.</p>

<p>"Then you're the only one!... Do you think that I didn't see
them?... And that M. Parabise, the manager of the Crédit Central,
noticed nothing?... And that M. de La Borderie, the ambassador,
has no eyes to see with?... Why, all the subscribers were pointing
at our managers!"</p>

<p>"But what were our managers doing?" asked Gabriel, putting on
his most innocent air.</p>

<p>"What were they doing? You know better than any one what they
were doing!... You were there!... And you were watching them, you
and Mercier!... And you were the only two who didn't laugh...."
</p>

<p>"I don't understand!"</p>

<p>Gabriel raised his arms and dropped them to his sides again,
which gesture was meant to convey that the question did not
interest him in the least. Rémy continued:</p>

<p>"What is the sense of this new mania of theirs? <i>Why won't
they have any one come near them now?</i>"</p>

<p>"What? <i>Won't they have any one come near them?</i>"</p>

<p><i>"And they won't let any one touch them!"</i> </p>

<p>"Really? Have you noticed <i>that they won't let any one touch
them?</i> That is certainly odd!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so you admit it! And high time, too! And <i>then, they
walk backward!</i>"</p>

<p><i>"Backward!</i> You have seen our managers <i>walk
backward</i>? Why, I thought that only crabs walked
backward!"</p>

<p>"Don't laugh, Gabriel; don't laugh!"</p>

<p>"I'm not laughing," protested Gabriel, looking as solemn as a
judge.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you can tell me this, Gabriel, as you're an intimate
friend of the management: When I went up to M. Richard, outside
the foyer, during the Garden interval, with my hand out before
me, why did M. Moncharmin hurriedly whisper to me, 'Go away! Go
away! Whatever you do, don't touch <i>'M. le directeur!'</i> Am I
supposed to have an infectious disease?"</p>

<p>"It's incredible!"</p>

<p>"And, a little later, when M. de La Borderie went up to M.
Richard, didn't you see M. Moncharmin  them and hear him exclaim,
'<i>M. l'ambassadeur</i>, I entreat you not to touch <i>M. le
directeur</i>'?"</p>

<p>"It's terrible!... And what was Richard doing meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"What was he doing? Why, you saw him! He turned about,
<i>bowed in front of him, though there was nobody in front of
him</i>, and withdrew <i>backward</i> ...."</p>

<p><i>"Backward?"</i> </p>

<p>"And Moncharmin, behind Richard, also turned about; that is,
he described a semicircle behind Richard and also <i>walked
backward!</i>. . . And they went <i>like that</i> to the
staircase leading to the managers' office: <i>backward, backward,
backward</i>! Well, if they are not mad, will you explain what it
means?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were practising a figure in the ballet,"
suggested Gabriel, without much conviction in his voice.</p>

<p>The secretary was furious at this wretched joke, made at so
dramatic a moment. He knit his brows and contracted his lips.
Then he put his mouth to Gabriel's ear:</p>

<p>"Don't be so sly, Gabriel. There are things going on for which
you and Mercier are partly responsible."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Christine Daaé is not the only one who suddenly, disappeared
to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>

<p>"There's no nonsense about it. Perhaps you can tell me why,
when Mother Giry came down to the foyer just now, Mercier took
her by the hand and hurried her away with him?"</p>

<p>"Really?" said Gabriel, "I never saw it."</p>

<p>"You did see it, Gabriel, for you went with Mercier and Mother
Giry to Mercier's office. Since then, you and Mercier have been
seen, but no one has seen Mother Giry."</p>

<p>"Do you think we've eaten her?"</p>

<p>"No, but you've locked her up in the office; and any one
passing the office can hear her yelling, 'Oh, the scoundrels!
Oh, the scoundrels!'"</p>

<p>At this point of this singular conversation, Mercier arrived,
all out of breath.</p>

<p>"There!" he said, in a gloomy voice. "It's worse than ever!...
I shouted, 'It's a serious matter! Open the door! It's I,
Mercier.' I heard footsteps. The door opened and Moncharmin
appeared. He was very pale. He said, 'What do you want?' I
answered, 'Some one has run away with Christine Daaé.' What do
you think he said? 'And a good job, too!' And he shut the door,
after putting this in my hand."</p>

<p>Mercier opened his hand; Rémy and Gabriel looked.</p>

<p>"The safety-pin!" cried Rémy.</p>

<p>"Strange! Strange!" muttered Gabriel, who could not help
shivering.</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice made them all three turn round.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen. Could you tell me where
Christine Daaé is?"</p>

<p>In spite of the seriousness of the circumstances, the
absurdity of the question would have made them roar with
laughter, if they had not caught sight of a face so
sorrow-stricken that they were at once seized with pity. It was
the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>CHRISTINE! CHRISTINE!</h3>

<p class="first">
RAOUL'S first thought, after Christine Daaé's A\ fantastic
disappearance, was to accuse Erik. He no longer doubted the
almost supernatural powers of the Angel of Music, in this domain
of the Opera in which he had set up his empire. And Raoul rushed
on the stage, in a mad fit of love and despair.</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine!" he moaned, calling to her as he felt
that she must be calling to him from the depths of that dark pit
to which the monster had carried her. "Christine! Christine!"</p>

<p>And he seemed to hear the girl's screams through the frail
boards that separated him from her. He bent forward, he
listened,... he wandered over the stage like a madman. Ah, to
descend, to descend into that pit of darkness every entrance to
which was closed to him,... for the stairs that led below the
stage were forbidden to one and all that night!</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine!..."</p>

<p>People pushed him aside, laughing. They made fun of him. They
thought the poor lover's brain was gone!</p>

<p>By what mad road, through what passages of mystery and
darkness known to him alone had Erik dragged that pure-souled
child to the awful haunt, with the Louis-Philippe room, opening
out on the lake?</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine!... Why don't you answer?... Are you
alive?..."</p>

<p>Hideous thoughts flashed through Raoul's congested brain. Of
course, Erik must have discovered their secret, must have known
that Christine had played him false. What a vengeance would be
his!</p>

<p>And Raoul thought again of the yellow stars that had come, the
night before, and roamed over his balcony. Why had he not put
them out for good? There were some men's eyes that dilated in the
darkness and shone like stars or like cats' eyes. Certainly
Albinos, who seemed to have rabbits' eyes by day, had cats' eyes
at night: everybody knew that! Yes, yes, he had undoubtedly fired
at Erik. Why had he not killed him? The monster had fled up the
gutter-spout like a cat or a convict who&mdash;everybody knew
that also&mdash;would scale the very skies, with the help of a
gutter-spout.... No doubt Erik was at that time contemplating
some decisive step against Raoul, but he had been wounded and had
escaped to turn against poor Christine instead.</p>

<p>Such were the cruel thoughts that haunted Raoul as he ran to
the singer's dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine!"</p>

<p>Bitter tears scorched the boy's eyelids as he saw scattered
over the furniture the clothes which his beautiful bride was to
have worn at the hour of their flight. Oh, why had she refused to
leave earlier?</p>

<p>Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe? Why toyed
with the monster's heart? Why, in a final access of pity, had she
insisted on flinging, as a last sop to that demon's soul, her
divine song:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"Holy angel, in Heaven blessed,<br>
My spirit longs with thee to rest!"</p>

<br>

<p>Raoul, his throat filled with sobs, oaths and insults, fumbled
awkwardly at the great mirror that had opened one night, before
his eyes, to let Christine pass to the murky dwelling below. He
pushed, pressed, groped about, but the glass apparently obeyed no
one but Erik.... Perhaps actions were not enough with a glass of
the kind? Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words? When he
was a little boy, he had heard that there were things that obeyed
the spoken word!</p>

<p>Suddenly, Raoul remembered something about a gate opening into
the Rue Scribe, an underground passage running straight to the
Rue Scribe from the lake.... Yes, Christine had told him about
that.... And, when he found that the key was no longer in the
box, he nevertheless ran to the Rue Scribe.</p>

<p>Outside, in the street, he passed his trembling hands over the
huge stones, felt for outlets... met with iron bars... were those
they?... Or these?... Or could it be that air-hole?</p>

<p>He plunged his useless eyes through the bars.... How dark it
was in there!... He listened.... All was silence!... He went
round the building and came to bigger bars, immense gates!... It
was the entrance to the Cour de l'Administration.</p>

<p>Raoul rushed into the doorkeeper's lodge.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madame, could you tell me where to find a
gate or door, made of bars, iron bars, opening into the Rue
Scribe... and leading to the lake?... You know the lake I
mean?... Yes, the underground lake... under the Opera."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I know there is a lake under the Opera, but I don't
know which door leads to it. I have never been there!"</p>

<p>"And the Rue Scribe, madame, the Rue Scribe? Have you never
been to the Rue Scribe?"</p>

<p>The woman laughed, screamed with laughter! Raoul darted away,
roaring with anger, ran up-stairs, four stairs at a time,
down-stairs, rushed through the whole of the business side of the
opera-house, found himself once more in the light of the
stage.</p>

<p>He stopped, with his heart thumping in his chest: suppose
Christine Daaé had been found? He saw a group of men and
asked:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen. Could you tell me where
Christine Daaé is?" And somebody laughed.</p>

<p>At the same moment the stage buzzed with a new sound and, amid
a crowd of men in evening-dress, all talking and gesticulating
together, appeared a man who seemed very calm and displayed a
pleasant face, all pink and chubby-checked, crowned with curly
hair and lit up by a pair of wonderfully serene blue eyes.</p>

<p>Mercier, the acting-manager, called the Vicomte de</p>

<p>Chagny's attention to him and said:</p>

<p>"This is the gentleman to whom you should put your
question, monsieur. Let me introduce M. Mifroid, the
commissary of police."</p>

<p>"Ah, M. le Vicomte de Chagny! Delighted to meet you,
monsieur," said the commissary. "Would you mind coming with
me?... And now where are the managers?... Where are the
managers?..."</p>

<p>Mercier did not answer, and Rémy, the secretary, volunteered
the information that the managers were locked up in their office
and that they knew nothing as yet of what had happened.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say so! Let us go up to the office!"</p>

<p>And M. Mifroid, followed by an ever-increasing crowd,
turned toward the business side of the building.
Mercier took advantage of the confusion to slip a key into
Gabriel's hand:</p>

<p>"This is all going very badly," he whispered. "You had better
let Mother Giry out."</p>

<p>And Gabriel moved away.</p>

<p>They soon came to the managers' door. Mercier stormed in vain:
the door remained closed.</p>

<p>"Open in the name of the law!" commanded M. Mifroid, in a loud
and rather anxious voice.</p>

<p>At last the door was opened. All rushed in to the office, on
the commissary's heels.</p>

<p>Raoul was the last to enter. As he was about to follow the
rest into the room, a hand was laid on his shoulder and he heard
these words spoken in his ear:</p>

<p><i>"Erik's secrets concern no one but himself!"</i> </p>

<p>He turned around, with a stifled exclamation. The hand that
was laid on his shoulder was now placed on the lips of a person
with an ebony skin, with eyes of jade and with an astrakhan cap
on his head: the Persian!</p>

<p>The stranger kept up the gesture that recommended discretion
and then, at the moment when the astonished viscount was about to
ask the reason of his mysterious intervention, bowed and
disappeared.</p>

<h3>MME. GIRY'S ASTOUNDING REVELATIONS AS TO<br>
HER PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH THE OPERA GHOST</h3>

<p class="first">
BEFORE following the commissary into the manager's office I
must describe certain extraordinary occurrences that took place
in that office which Rémy and Mercier had vainly tried to enter
and into which MM. Richard and Moncharmin had locked themselves
with an object which the reader does not yet know, but which it
is my duty, as an historian, to reveal without further
postponement.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to say that the managers' mood had
undergone a disagreeable change for some time past and to convey
the fact that this change was due not only to the fall of the
chandelier on the famous night of the gala performance.</p>

<p>The reader must know that the ghost had calmly been paid his
first twenty thousand francs. Oh, there had been wailing and
gnashing of teeth, indeed! And yet the thing had happened as
simply as could be.</p>

<p>One morning, the managers found on their table an envelope
addressed to "Monsieur O.G. (private)" and accompanied by a note
from O.G. himself:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"> The time has come to carry out the clause in
the memorandum-book. Please put twenty notes of a thousand francs
each into this envelope, seal it with your own seal and hand it
to Mme. Giry, who will do what is necessary.</p>

<p><br>
The managers did not hesitate; without wasting time in asking
how these confounded communications came to be delivered in an
office which they were careful to keep locked, they seized this
opportunity of laying hands on the mysterious blackmailer. And,
after telling the whole story, under the promise of secrecy, to Gabriel and Mercier, they put the twenty thousand
francs into the envelope and without asking for explanations,
handed it to Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions.
The box-keeper displayed no astonishment. I need hardly say that
she was well watched. She went straight to the ghost's box and
placed the precious envelope on the little shelf attached to the
ledge. The two managers, as well as Gabriel and Mercier, were
hidden in such a way that they did not lose sight of the envelope
for a second during the performance and even afterward, for, as
the envelope had not moved, those who watched it did not move
either; and Mme. Giry went away while the managers, Gabriel and
Mercier were still there. At last, they became tired of waiting
and opened the envelope, after ascertaining that the seals had
not been broken.</p>

<p>At first sight, Richard and Moncharmin thought that the notes
were still there; but soon they perceived that they were not the
same. The twenty real notes were gone and had been replaced by
twenty notes of the "Bank of St. Farce"![*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[*Flash notes drawn on the "Bank of St.
Farce" in France correspond with those drawn on the "Bank of
Engraving" in England.&mdash;Translator's Note.]</p>
<br>

<p>The managers' rage and fright were unmistakable. Moncharmin
wanted to send for the commissary of police, but Richard
objected. He no doubt had a plan, for he said:</p>

<p>"Don't let us make ourselves ridiculous! All Paris would laugh
at us. O.G. has won the first game: we will win the second."</p>

<p>He was thinking of the next month's allowance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they had been so absolutely tricked that they
were bound to suffer a certain dejection. And, upon my word, it
was not difficult to understand. We must not forget that the
managers had an idea at the back of their minds, all the time,
that this strange incident might be an unpleasant practical joke
on the part of their predecessors and that it would not do to
divulge it prematurely. On the other hand, Moncharmin was
sometimes troubled with a suspicion of Richard himself, who
occasionally took fanciful whims into his head. And so they were
content to await events, while keeping an eye on Mother Giry.
Richard would not have her spoken to.</p>

<p>"If she is a confederate," he said, "the notes are gone long
ago. But, in my opinion, she is merely an idiot."</p>

<p>"She's not the only idiot in this business," said Moncharmin
pensively.</p>

<p>"Well, who could have thought it?" moaned Richard. "But don't
be afraid... next time: I shall have taken my precautions."</p>

<p>The next time fell on the same day that beheld the
disappearance of Christine Daaé. In the morning, a note from the
ghost reminded them that the money was due. It read:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">Do just as you did last time. It went very
well. Put the twenty thousand in the envelope and hand it to our
excellent Mme. Giry.</p>

<br>

<p>And the note was accompanied by the usual envelope. They had
only to insert the notes.</p>

<p>This was done about half an hour before the curtain rose on
the first act of <i>Faust</i>. Richard showed the envelope to
Moncharmin. Then he counted the twenty thousand-franc notes in
front of him and put the notes into the envelope, but without
closing it.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "let's have Mother Giry in."</p>

<p>The old woman was sent for. She entered with a sweeping
courtesy. She still wore her black taffeta dress, the color of
which was rapidly turning to rust and lilac, to say nothing of
the dingy bonnet. She seemed in a good temper. She at once said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, gentlemen! It's for the envelope, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mme. Giry," said Richard, most amiably. "For the
envelope&mdash;and something else besides."</p>

<p>"At your service, M. Richard, at your service. And what is
the something else, please?"</p>

<p>"First of all, Mme. Giry, I have a little question to put to
you."</p>

<p>"By all means, M. Richard: Mme. Giry is here to answer
you."</p>

<p>"Are you still on good terms with the ghost?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't be better, sir; couldn't be better."</p>

<p>"Ah, we are delighted.... Look here, Mme. Giry," said Richard,
in the tone of making an important confidence. "We may just as
well tell you, among ourselves... you're no fool!"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," exclaimed the box-keeper, stopping the pleasant
nodding of the black feathers in her dingy bonnet, "I assure you
no one has ever doubted that!"</p>

<p>"We are quite agreed and we shall soon understand one another.
The story of the ghost is all humbug, isn't it?... Well, still
between ourselves, it has lasted long enough." Mme. Giry looked
at the managers as though they were talking Chinese. She walked
up to Richard's table and asked, rather anxiously:</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, you understand quite well. In any case, you've got to
understand.... And, first of all, tell us his name."</p>

<p>"Whose name?"</p>

<p>"The name of the man whose accomplice you are, Mme. Giry!"</p>

<p>"I am the ghost's accomplice? I?... His accomplice in what,
pray?"</p>

<p>"You do all he wants."</p>

<p>"Oh! He's not very troublesome, you know."</p>

<p>"And does he still tip you?"</p>

<p>"I mustn't complain."</p>

<p>"How much does he give you for bringing him that
envelope?"</p>

<p>"Ten francs."</p>

<p>"You poor thing! That's not much, is it?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that presently, Mme. Giry. Just now we should
like to know for what extraordinary reason you have given
yourself body and soul, to this ghost.... Mme. Giry's friendship
and devotion are not to be bought for five francs or ten
francs."</p>

<p>"That's true enough.... And I can tell you the reason, sir.
There's no disgrace about it... on the contrary."</p>

<p>"We're quite sure of that, Mme. Giry!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's like this... only the ghost doesn't like me to
talk about his business."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" sneered Richard.</p>

<p>"But this is a matter that concerns myself alone.... Well, it
was in Box Five one evening, I found a letter addressed to
myself, a sort of note written in red ink. I needn't read the
letter to you, sir; I know it by heart, and I shall never forget
it if I live to be a hundred!"</p>

<p>And Mme. Giry, drawing herself up, recited the letter with
touching eloquence:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">"Madam</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">"1825. Mlle. Ménétrier, leader of the ballet,
became Marquise de Cussy.</p>

<p class="letter">"1832. Mlle. Marie Taglioni, a dancer, became
Comtesse Gilbert des Voisins.</p>

<p class="letter">"1846. La Sota, a dancer, married a brother of
the King of Spain.</p>

<p class="letter">"1847. Lola Montes, a dancer, became the
morganatic wife of King Louis of Bavaria and was created Countess
of Landsfeld.</p>

<p class="letter">"1848. Mlle. Maria, a dancer, became Baronne
d'Herneville.</p>

<p class="letter">"1870. Theresa Hessier, a dancer, married Dom
Fernando, brother to the King of Portugal."</p>

<br>

<p>Richard and Moncharmin listened to the old woman, who, as she
proceeded with the enumeration of these glorious nuptials,
swelled out, took courage and, at last, in a voice bursting with
pride, flung out the last sentence of the prophetic letter:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"1885. Meg Giry, Empress!"</p>

<br>

<p>Exhausted by this supreme effort, the box-keeper fell into a
chair, saying:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the letter was signed, 'Opera Ghost.' I had heard
much of the ghost, but only half believed in him. From the day
when he declared that my little Meg, the flesh of my flesh, the
fruit of my womb, would be empress, I believed in him
altogether."</p>

<p>And really it was not necessary to make a long study of Mme.
Giry's excited features to understand what could be got out of
that fine intellect with the two words "ghost" and "empress."</p>

<p>But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet? That
was the question.</p>

<p>"You have never seen him; he speaks to you and you believe all
he says?" asked Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"Yes. To begin with, I owe it to him that my little Meg was
promoted to be the leader of a row. I said to the ghost, 'If she
is to be empress in 1885, there is no time to lose; she must
become a leader at once.' He said, 'Look upon it as done.' And he
had only a word to say to M. Poligny and the thing was done."</p>

<p>"So you see that M. Poligny saw him!"</p>

<p>"No, not any more than I did; but he heard him. The ghost said
a word in his ear, you know, on the evening when he left Box
Five, looking so dreadfully pale."</p>

<p>Moncharmin heaved a sigh. "What a business!" he groaned.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mme. Giry. "I always thought there were secrets
between the ghost and M. Poligny. Anything that the ghost asked
M. Poligny to do M. Poligny did. M. Poligny could refuse the
ghost nothing."</p>

<p>"You hear, Richard: Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I hear!" said Richard. "M. Poligny is a
friend of the ghost; and, as Mme. Giry is a friend of M.
Poligny, there we are!... But I don't care a hang about M.
Poligny," he added roughly. "The only person whose fate really
interests me is Mme. Giry.... Mme. Giry, do you know what is in
this envelope?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, look."</p>

<p>Mme. Giry looked into the envelope with a lackluster eye,
which soon recovered its brilliancy. . "Thousand-franc notes!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mme. Giry, thousand-franc notes! And you knew it!"</p>

<p>"I, sir? I?... I swear...."</p>

<p>"Don't swear, Mme. Giry!... And now I will tell you the second
reason why I sent for you. Mme. Giry, I am going to have you
arrested."</p>

<p>The two black feathers on the dingy bonnet, which usually
affected the attitude of two notes of interrogation, changed into
two notes of exclamation; as for the bonnet itself, it swayed in
menace on the old lady's tempestuous chignon. Surprise,
indignation, protest and dismay were furthermore displayed by
little Meg's mother in a sort of extravagant movement of offended
virtue, half bound, half slide, that brought her right under the
nose of M. Richard, who could not help pushing back his chair.</p>

<p><i>"Have me arrested!"</i></p>

<p>The mouth that spoke those words seemed to spit the three
teeth that were left to it into Richard's face.</p>

<p>M. Richard behaved like a hero. He retreated no farther. His
threatening forefinger seemed already to be pointing out the
keeper of Box Five to the absent magistrates.</p>

<p>"I am going to have you arrested, Mme. Giry, as a thief!"</p>

<p>"Say that again!"</p>

<p>And Mme. Giry caught Mr. Manager Richard a mighty box on the
ear, before Mr. Manager Moncharmin had time to intervene. But it
was not the withered hand of the angry old beldame that fell on
the managerial ear, but the envelope itself, the cause of
all the trouble, the magic envelope that opened with
the blow, scattering the bank-notes, which escaped in a fantastic
whirl of giant butterflies.</p>

<p>The two managers gave a shout, and the same thought made them
both go on their knees, feverishly picking up and hurriedly
examining the precious scraps of paper.</p>

<p>"Are they still genuine, Moncharmin?"</p>

<p>"Are they still genuine, Richard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are still genuine!"</p>

<p>Above their heads, Mame Giry's three teeth were clashing in a
noisy contest, full of hideous interjections. But all that could
be clearly distinguished was this <i>Leitmotif</i>:</p>

<p>"I, a thief!... I, a thief, I?"</p>

<p>She choked with rage. She shouted:</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing!"</p>

<p>And, suddenly, she darted up to Richard again.</p>

<p>"In any case," she yelped, "you, M. Richard, ought to know
better than I where the twenty thousand francs went to!"</p>

<p>"I?" asked Richard, astounded. "And how should I know?"</p>

<p>Moncharmin, looking severe and dissatisfied, at
once insisted that the good lady should explain herself.</p>

<p>"What does this mean, Mme. Giry?" he asked. "And why do you
say that M. Richard ought to know better than you where the
twenty-thousand francs went to?"</p>

<p>As for Richard, who felt himself turning red under
Moncharmin's eyes, he took Mme. Giry by the wrist and shook it
violently. In a voice growling and rolling like thunder, he
roared:</p>

<p>"Why should I know better than you where the twenty-thousand
francs went to? Why? Answer me!"</p>

<p>"Because they went into your pocket!" gasped the old woman,
looking at him as if he were the devil incarnate.</p>

<p>Richard would have rushed upon Mme. Giry, if Moncharmin had
not stayed his avenging hand and hastened to ask her, more
gently:</p>

<p>"How can you suspect my partner, M. Richard, of putting
twenty-thousand francs in his pocket?"</p>

<p>"I never said that," declared Mame Giry, "seeing that it was
myself who put the twenty-thousand francs into M. Richard's
pocket." And she added, under her voice, "There! It's out!... And
may the ghost forgive me!"</p>

<p>Richard began bellowing anew, but Moncharmin authoritatively
ordered him to be silent.</p>

<p>"Allow me! Allow me! Let the woman explain herself. Let me
question her." And he added: "It is really astonishing that you
should take up such a tone!... We are on the verge of clearing
up the whole mystery. And you're in a rage!... You're wrong
to behave like that... I'm enjoying myself immensely."</p>

<p>Mame Giry, like the martyr that she was, raised her head, her
face beaming with faith in her own innocence.</p>

<p>"You tell me there were twenty-thousand francs in the envelope
which I put into M. Richard's pocket; but I tell you again that I
knew nothing about it.... Nor M. Richard either, for that
matter!"</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Richard, suddenly assuming a swaggering air which
Moncharmin did not like. "I knew nothing either! You put
twenty-thousand francs in my pocket and I knew nothing either! I
am very glad to hear it, Mme. Giry!"</p>

<p>"Yes," the terrible dame agreed, "yes, it's true. We neither
of us knew anything. But you, you must have ended by finding
out!"</p>

<p>Richard would certainly have swallowed Mame Giry alive, if
Moncharmin had not been there! But Moncharmin protected her. He
resumed his questions:</p>

<p>"What sort of envelope did you put in M. Richard's pocket? It
was not the one which we gave you, the one which you took to Box
Five before our eyes; and yet that was the one which contained
the twenty-thousand francs."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. The envelope which <i>M. le directeur</i>
gave me was the one which I slipped into <i>M. le directeur's</i>
pocket," explained Mame Giry. "The one which I took to the
ghost's box was another envelope, just like it, which the ghost
gave me beforehand and which I hid up my sleeve."</p>

<p>So saying, Mame Giry took from her sleeve an envelope ready
prepared and similarly addressed to that containing the
twenty-thousand francs. The managers took it from her. They
examined it and saw that it was fastened with seals stamped with
their own managerial seal. They opened it. It contained twenty
Bank of St. Farce notes like those which had so much astounded
them the month before.</p>

<p>"How simple!" said Richard.</p>

<p>"How simple!" repeated Moncharmin. And he continued with his
eyes fixed upon Mame Giry, as though trying to hypnotize her.</p>

<p>"So it was the ghost who gave you this envelope and told you
to substitute it for the one which we gave you? And it was the
ghost who told you to put the other into M. Richard's
pocket?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was the ghost."</p>

<p>"Then would you mind giving us a specimen of your little
talents? Here is the envelope. Act as though we knew
nothing."</p>

<p>"As you please, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Mame Giry took the envelope with the twenty notes inside it
and made for the door. She was on the point of going out when the
two managers rushed at her:</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Oh, no! We're not going to be 'done' a second time!
Once bitten, twice shy!"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, gentlemen," said the old woman, in
self-excuse, "you told me to act as though you knew nothing....
Well, if you knew nothing, I should go away with your
envelope!"</p>

<p>"And then how would you slip it into my pocket?" argued
Richard, whom Moncharmin fixed with his left eye, while keeping
his right on Mame Giry: a proceeding likely to strain his sight,
but Moncharmin was prepared to go to any length to discover the
truth.</p>

<p>"I am to slip it into your pocket when you least expect it,
sir. You know that I always take a little turn behind the scenes,
in the course of the evening, and I often go with my daughter to
the ballet-foyer, which I am entitled to do, as her mother; I
bring her her shoes, when the ballet is about to begin... in
fact, I come and go as I please.... The subscribers come and go
too.... So do you, sir.... There are lots of people about. I go
behind you and slip the envelope into the tail-pocket of your
dress-coat.... There's no witchcraft about that!"</p>

<p>"No witchcraft!" growled Richard, rolling his eyes like
Jupiter Tonans. "No witchcraft! Why, I've just caught you in a
lie, you old witch!"</p>

<p>Mame Giry bristled, with her three teeth sticking out of her
mouth.</p>

<p>"And why, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Because I spent that evening watching Box Five and the sham
envelope which you put there. I did not go to the ballet-foyer
for a second."</p>

<p>"No, sir, and I did not give you the envelope that evening,
but at the next performance... on the evening when the
under-secretary of state for fine arts...."</p>

<p>At these words, M. Richard suddenly interrupted Mame Giry:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true, I remember now! The undersecretary went
behind the scenes. He asked for me.</p>

<p>I went down to the ballet-foyer for a moment. I was on the
foyer steps.... The under-secretary and his chief clerk were in
the foyer itself.... I suddenly turned around... you had
passed behind me, Mme. Giry.... You seemed to push against
me... Oh, I can see you still... I can see you still!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it, sir, that's it. I had just finished my little
business. That pocket of yours, sir, is very handy!"</p>

<p>And Mame Giry once more suited the action to the word. She
passed behind M. Richard and, so nimbly that Moncharmin himself
was impressed by it, slipped the envelope into the pocket of one
of the tails of M. Richard's dress-coat.</p>

<p>"Of course!" exclaimed Richard, looking a little pale. "It's
very clever of O. G. The problem which he had to solve was this:
how to do away with any dangerous intermediary between the man
who gives the twenty-thousand francs and the man who receives it.
And by far the best thing he could hit upon was to come and take
the money from my pocket without my noticing it, as I myself did
not know that it was there. It's wonderful!"</p>

<p>"Oh, wonderful, no doubt!" Moncharmin agreed. "Only, you
forget, Richard, that I provided ten-thousand francs of the
twenty and that nobody put anything in my pocket!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>THE SAFETY-PIN AGAIN</h3>

<p class="first">
MONCHARMIN'S last phrase so clearly expressed the suspicion in
which he now held his partner that it was bound to cause a stormy
explanation, at the end of which it was agreed that Richard
should yield to all Moncharmin's wishes, with the object of
helping him to discover the miscreant who was victimizing
them.</p>

<p>This brings us to the interval after the Garden Act, with the
strange conduct observed by M. Rémy and those curious lapses from
the dignity that might be expected of the managers. It was
arranged between Richard and Moncharmin, first, that Richard
should repeat the exact movements which he had made on the night
of the disappearance of the first twenty-thousand francs; and,
second, that Moncharmin should not for an instant lose sight of
Richard's coat-tail pocket, into which Mame Giry was to slip the
twenty-thousand francs.</p>

<p>M. Richard went and placed himself at the identical spot where
he had stood when he bowed to the under-secretary for fine arts.
M. Moncharmin took up his position a few steps behind him.</p>

<p>Mame Giry passed, rubbed up against M. Richard, got rid of her
twenty-thousand francs in the manager's coat-tail pocket and
disappeared.... Or rather she was conjured away. In accordance
with the instructions received from Moncharmin a few minutes
earlier, Mercier took the good lady to the acting-manager's
office and turned the key on her, thus making it impossible for
her to communicate with her ghost.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, M. Richard was bending and bowing and scraping and
walking backward, just as if he had that high and mighty
minister, the under-secretary for fine arts, before him. Only,
though these marks of politeness would have created no
astonishment if the under-secretary of state had really been in
front of M. Richard, they caused an easily comprehensible
amazement to the spectators of this very natural but quite
inexplicable scene when M. Richard had nobody in front of
him.</p>

<p>M. Richard bowed... to nobody; bent his back... before nobody;
and walked backward... before nobody.... And, a few steps behind
him, M. Moncharmin did the same thing that he was doing, in
addition to pushing away M. Rémy and begging M. de la Borderie,
the ambassador, and the manager of the Credit Central "not to
touch <i>M. le directeur</i>."</p>

<p>Moncharmin, who had his own ideas, did not want Richard to
come to him presently, when the twenty-thousand francs were gone,
and say:</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was the ambassador... or the manager of the Credit
Central... or Rémy."</p>

<p>The more so as, at the time of the first scene, as</p>

<p>Richard himself admitted, Richard had met nobody in that part
of the theater after Mame Giry had brushed up against him.</p>

<p>Having begun by walking backward in order to bow, Richard
continued to do so from prudence, until he reached the passage
leading to the offices of the management. In this way, he was
constantly watched by Moncharmin from behind and himself kept an
eye on any one approaching from the front. Once more, this novel
method of walking behind the scenes, adopted by the managers of
our National Academy of Music, attracted attention; but the
managers themselves thought of nothing but their twenty-thousand
francs.</p>

<p>On reaching the half-dark passage, Richard said to Moncharmin,
in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I am sure that nobody has touched me.... You had now better
keep at some distance from me and watch me till I come to door of
the office: it is better not to arouse suspicion and we can see
anything that happens."</p>

<p>But Moncharmin replied. "No, Richard, no! You walk ahead and
I'll walk immediately behind you! I won't leave you by a
step!"</p>

<p>"But, in that case," exclaimed Richard, "they will never steal
our twenty-thousand francs!"</p>

<p>"I should hope not, indeed!" declared Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"Then what we are doing is absurd!"</p>

<p>"We are doing exactly what we did last time.... Last time,
I joined you as you were leaving the stage and followed close
behind you down this passage."</p>

<p>"That's true!" sighed Richard, shaking his head and passively
obeying Moncharmin.</p>

<p>Two minutes later, the joint managers locked themselves into
their office. Moncharmin himself put the key in his pocket:</p>

<p>"We remained locked up like this, last time," he said, "until
you left the Opera to go home."</p>

<p>"That's so. No one came and disturbed us, I suppose</p>

<p>"No one."</p>

<p>"Then," said Richard, who was trying to collect his memory,
"then I must certainly have been robbed on my way home from the
Opera."</p>

<p>"No," said Moncharmin in a drier tone than ever, "no, that's
impossible. For I dropped you in my cab. The twenty-thousand
francs disappeared at your place: there's not a shadow of a doubt
about that."</p>

<p>"It's incredible!" protested Richard. "I am sure of my
servants... and if one of them had done it, he would have
disappeared since."</p>

<p>Moncharmin shrugged his shoulders, as though to say that he
did not wish to enter into details, and Richard began to think
that Moncharmin was treating him in a very insupportable
fashion.</p>

<p>"Moncharmin, I've had enough of this!"</p>

<p>"Richard, I've had too much of it!"</p>

<p>"Do you dare to suspect me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of a silly joke."</p>

<p>"One doesn't joke with twenty-thousand francs."</p>

<p>"That's what I think," declared Moncharmin, unfolding a
newspaper and ostentatiously studying its contents.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked Richard. "Are you going to read
the paper next?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Richard, until I take you home."</p>

<p>"Like last time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, like last time."</p>

<p>Richard snatched the paper from Moncharmin's hands. Moncharmin
stood up, more irritated than ever, and found himself faced by an
exasperated Richard, who, crossing his arms on his chest,
said:</p>

<p>"Look here, I'm thinking of this, <i>I'm thinking of what I
might think</i> if, like last time, after my spending the evening
alone with you, you brought me home and if, at the moment of
parting, I perceived that twenty-thousand francs had disappeared
from my coat-pocket... like last time."</p>

<p>"And what might you think?" asked Moncharmin, crimson with
rage.</p>

<p>"I might think that, as you hadn't left me by a foot's breadth
and as, by your own wish, you were the only one to approach me,
like last time, I might think that, if that twenty-thousand
francs was no longer in my pocket, it stood a very good chance of
being in yours!"</p>

<p>Moncharmin leaped up at the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he shouted. "A safety-pin!"</p>

<p>"What do you want a safety-pin for?"</p>

<p>"To fasten you up with!... A safety-pin!... A safety-pin!"</p>

<p>"You want to fasten me with a safety-pin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to fasten you to the twenty-thousand francs! Then,
whether it's here, or on the drive from here to your place, or at
your place, you will feel the hand that pulls at your pocket and
you will see if it's mine! Oh, so you're suspecting me now, are
you? A safety-pin!"</p>

<p>And that was the moment when Moncharmin opened the door on the
passage and shouted:</p>

<p>"A safety-pin!... somebody give me a safety-pin!"</p>

<p>And we also know how, at the same moment, Rémy, who had no
safety-pin, was received by Moncharmin, while a boy procured the
pin so eagerly longed for. And what happened was this: Moncharmin
first locked the door again. Then he knelt down behind Richard's
back.</p>

<p>"I hope," he said, "that the notes are still there?"</p>

<p>"So do I," said Richard.</p>

<p>"The real ones?" asked Moncharmin, resolved not to be "had"
this time.</p>

<p>"Look for yourself," said Richard. "I refuse to touch
them."</p>

<p>Moncharmin took the envelope from Richard's pocket and drew
out the bank-notes with a trembling hand, for, this time, in
order frequently to make sure of the presence of the notes, he
had not sealed the envelope nor even fastened it. He felt
reassured on finding that they were all there and quite genuine.
He put them back in the tail-pocket and pinned them with
great care. Then he sat down behind Richard's coat-tails
and kept his eyes fixed on them, while Richard, sitting at his
writing-table, did not stir.</p>

<p>"A little patience, Richard," said Moncharmin. "We have only a
few minutes to wait.... The clock will soon strike twelve. Last
time, we left at the last stroke of twelve."</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall have all the patience necessary!"</p>

<p>The time passed, slow, heavy, mysterious, stifling. Richard
tried to laugh.</p>

<p>"I shall end by believing in the omnipotence of the ghost," he
said. "Just now, don't you find something uncomfortable,
disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?"</p>

<p>"You're quite right," said Moncharmin, who was really
impressed.</p>

<p>"The ghost!" continued Richard, in a low voice, as though
fearing lest he should be overheard by invisible ears. "The
ghost! Suppose, all the same, it were a ghost who puts the magic
envelopes on the table... who talks in Box Five... who killed
Joseph Buquet... who unhooked the chandelier... and who robs us!
For, after all, after all, after all, there is no one here except
you and me, and, if the notes disappear and neither you nor I
have anything to do with it, well, we shall have to believe in
the ghost... in the ghost."</p>

<p>At that moment, the clock on the mantlepiece gave its warning
click and the first stroke of twelve struck.</p>

<p>The two managers shuddered. The perspiration
treamed from their foreheads. The twelfth stroke sounded
strangely in their ears.</p>

<p>When the clock stopped, they gave a sigh and rose from their
chairs.</p>

<p>"I think we can go now," said Moncharmin.</p>

<p>"I think so," Richard agreed.</p>

<p>"Before we go, do you mind if I look in your pocket?"</p>

<p>"But, of course, Moncharmin, <i>you must!</i>... Well?" he
asked, as Moncharmin was feeling at the pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, I can feel the pin."</p>

<p>"Of course, as you said, we can't be robbed without noticing
it."</p>

<p>But Moncharmin, whose hands were still fumbling, bellowed:</p>

<p>"I can feel the pin, but I can't feel the notes!"</p>

<p>"Come, no joking, Moncharmin!... This isn't the time for
it."</p>

<p>"Well, feel for yourself."</p>

<p>Richard tore off his coat. The two managers turned the pocket
inside out. <i>The pocket was empty</i>. And the curious thing
was that the pin remained, stuck in the same place.</p>

<p>Richard and Moncharmin turned pale. There was no longer any
doubt about the witchcraft.</p>

<p>"The ghost!" muttered Moncharmin.</p>

<p>But Richard suddenly sprang upon his partner.</p>

<p>"No one but you has touched my pocket! Give me back my
twenty-thousand francs!... Give me back my twenty-thousand
francs!..."</p>

<p>"On my soul," sighed Moncharmin, who was ready to swoon, "on
my soul, I swear that I haven't got it!"</p>

<p>Then somebody knocked at the door. Moncharmin opened it
automatically, seemed hardly to recognize Mercier, his
business-manager, exchanged a few words with him, without knowing
what he was saying and, with an unconscious movement, put the
safety-pin, for which he had no further use, into the hands of
his bewildered subordinate....</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE COMMISSARY, THE VISCOUNT and THE PERSIAN</h3>

<p class="first">
THE first words of the commissary of police, on entering the
managers' office, were to ask after the missing prima donna. "Is
Christine Daaé here?"</p>

<p>"Christine Daaé here?" echoed Richard. "No. Why?"</p>

<p>As for Moncharmin, he had not the strength left to utter a
word.</p>

<p>Richard repeated, for the commissary and the compact crowd
which had followed him into the office observed an impressive
silence.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask if Christine Daaé is here, <i>M. le
commissaire</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because she has to be found," declared the commissary of
police solemnly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, she has to be found? Has she
disappeared?"</p>

<p>"In the middle of the performance!"</p>

<p>"In the middle of the performance? This is extraordinary!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it? And what is quite as extraordinary is that you
should first learn it from me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richard, taking his head in his hands
and muttering, "What is this new business? Oh, it's enough
to make a man send in his resignation!"</p>

<p>And he pulled a few hairs out of his mustache without even
knowing what he was doing.</p>

<p>"So she... so she disappeared in the middle of the
performance?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was carried off in the Prison Act, at the moment
when she was invoking the aid of the angels; but I doubt if she
was carried off by an angel."</p>

<p>"And I am sure that she was!"</p>

<p>Everybody looked round. A young man, pale and trembling with
excitement, repeated:</p>

<p>"I am sure of it!"</p>

<p>"Sure of what?" asked Mifroid.</p>

<p>"That Christine Daaé was carried off by an angel, <i>'M. le
commissaire</i>, and I can tell you his name."</p>

<p>"Aha, M. le Vicomte de Chagny! So you maintain that Christine
Daaé was carried off by an angel: an angel of the Opera, no
doubt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, by an angel of the Opera; and I will tell you
where he lives.... when we are alone."</p>

<p>"You are right, monsieur."</p>

<p>And the commissary of police, inviting Raoul to take a chair,
cleared the room of all the rest, excepting the managers.</p>

<p>Then Raoul spoke:</p>

<p><i>"M. le commissaire</i>, the angel is called Erik, he lives
in the Opera and he is the Angel of Music!"</p>

<p>"The Angel of Music! Really! That is very curious!... The
Angel of Music!" And, turning to the managers, M. Mifroid asked,
"Have you an Angel of Music on the premises, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Richard and Moncharmin shook their heads, without even
speaking.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the viscount, "those gentlemen have heard of the
Opera ghost. Well, I am in a position to state that the Opera
ghost and the Angel of Music are one and the same person;
and his real name is Erik."</p>

<p>M. Mifroid rose and looked at Raoul attentively.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, monsieur, but is it your intention to make
fun of the law? And, if not, what is all this about the Opera
ghost?"</p>

<p>"I say that these gentlemen have heard of him."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, it appears that you know the Opera ghost?"</p>

<p>Richard rose, with the remaining hairs of has mustache in his
hand.</p>

<p>"No, M. Commissary, no, we do not know him, but we wish that
we did, for this very evening he has robbed us of twenty-thousand
francs!"</p>

<p>And Richard turned a terrible look on Moncharmin, which seemed
to say:</p>

<p>"Give me back the twenty-thousand francs, or I'll tell the
whole story."</p>

<p>Moncharmin understood what he meant, for, with a distracted
gesture, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, tell everything and have done with it!"</p>

<p>As for Mifroid, he looked at the managers and at Raoul by
turns and wondered whether he had strayed into a lunatic asylum.
He passed his hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"A ghost," he said, "who, on the same evening,
carries off an opera-singer and steals twenty-thousand francs
is a ghost who must have his hands very full! If you don't mind,
we will take the questions in order. The singer first, the
twenty-thousand francs after. Come, M. de Chagny, let us try to
talk seriously. You believe that Mlle. Christine Daaé has been
carried off by an individual called Erik. Do you know this
person? Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In a churchyard."</p>

<p>M. Mifroid gave a start, began to scrutinize Raoul again and
said:</p>

<p>"Of course!... That's where ghosts usually hang out!....
And what were you doing in that churchyard?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Raoul, "I can quite understand how absurd my
replies must seem to you. But I beg you to believe that I am in
full possession of my faculties. The safety of the person dearest
to me in the world is at stake. I should like to convince you in
a few words, for time is pressing and every minute is valuable.
Unfortunately, if I do not tell you the strangest story that ever
was from the beginning, you will not believe me. I will tell
you all I know about the Opera ghost, M. Commissary. Alas, I do
not know much!..."</p>

<p>"Never mind, go on, go on!" exclaimed Richard and Moncharmin,
suddenly greatly interested.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for their hopes of learning some detail that
could put them on the track of their hoaxer,
they were soon compelled to accept the fact that M.
Raoul de Chagny had completely lost his head. All that story
about Perros-Guirec, death's heads and enchanted violins, could
only have taken birth in the disordered brain of a youth mad with
love. It was evident, also, that Mr. Commissary Mifroid shared
their view; and the magistrate would certainly have cut short the
incoherent narrative if circumstances had not taken it upon
themselves to interrupt it.</p>

<p>The door opened and a man entered, curiously dressed in an
enormous frock-coat and a tall hat, at once shabby and shiny,
that came down to his ears. He went up to the commissary and
spoke to him in a whisper. It was doubtless a detective come to
deliver an important communication.</p>

<p>During this conversation, M. Mifroid did not take his eyes off
Raoul. At last, addressing him, he said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, we have talked enough about the ghost. We will now
talk about yourself a little, if you have no objection: you were
to carry off Mlle. Christine Daaé to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>M. le commissaire</i>."</p>

<p>"After the performance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>M. le commissaire</i>."</p>

<p>"All your arrangements were made?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>M. le commissaire</i>."</p>

<p>"The carriage that brought you was to take you both away.....
There were fresh horses in readiness at every stage....."</p>

<p>"That is true, <i>M. le commissaire</i>"....</p>

<p>"And nevertheless your carriage is still outside the Rotunda
awaiting your orders, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>M le commissaire</i>."</p>

<p>"Did you know that there were three other carriages there, in
addition to yours?"</p>

<p>"I did not pay the least attention."</p>

<p>"They were the carriages of Mlle. Sorelli, which could not
find room in the Cour de l'Administration; of Carlotta; and of
your brother, M. le Comte de Chagny...."</p>

<p>"Very likely...."</p>

<p>"What is certain is that, though your carriage and Sorelli's
and Carlotta's are still there, by the Rotunda pavement, M. le
Comte de Chagny's carriage is gone."</p>

<p>"This has nothing to say to...."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. Was not M. le Comte opposed to your
marriage with Mlle. Daaé?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter that only concerns the family."</p>

<p>"You have answered my question: he was opposed to it... and
that was why you were carrying Christine Daaé out of your
brother's reach.... Well, M. de Chagny, allow me to inform you
that your brother has been smarter than you! It is he who has
carried off Christine Daaé!"</p>

<p>"Oh, impossible!" moaned Raoul, pressing his hand to his
heart. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Immediately after the artist's disappearance, which was
procured by means which we have still to ascertain, he flung into
his carriage, which drove right across Paris at a furious
pace."</p>

<p>"Across Paris?" asked poor Raoul, in a hoarse voice. "What do
you mean by across Paris?"</p>

<p>"Across Paris and out of Paris... by the Brussels road."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the young man, "I shall catch them!"</p>

<p>And he rushed out of the office.</p>

<p>"And bring her back to us!" cried the commissary gaily.....
"Ah, that's a trick worth two of the Angel of Music's!"</p>

<p>And, turning to his audience, M. Mifroid delivered a little
lecture on police methods.</p>

<p>"I don't know for a moment whether M. le Comte de Chagny has
really carried Christine Daaé off or not.... but I want to know
and I believe that, at this moment, no one is more anxious to
inform us than his brother..... And now he is flying in pursuit
of him! He is my chief auxiliary I This, gentlemen, is the art of
the police, which is believed to be so complicated and which,
nevertheless, appears so simple as soon as you see that it
consists in getting your work done by people who have nothing to
do with the police."</p>

<p>But M. le Commissaire de Police Mifroid would not have been
quite so satisfied with himself if he had known that the rush of
his rapid emissary was stopped at the entrance to the very first
corridor. A tall figure blocked Raoul's way.</p>

<p>"Where are you going so fast, M. de Chagny?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>Raoul impatiently raised his eyes and recognized
the astrakhan cap of an hour ago. He stopped:</p>

<p>"It's you!" he cried, in a feverish voice. "You, who know
Erik's secrets and don't want me to speak of them. Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"You know who I am!... I am the Persian!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>THE VISCOUNT AND THE PERSIAN</h3>

<p class="first">
RAOUL now remembered that his brother had once shown him that
mysterious person, of whom nothing was known except that he was a
Persian and that he lived in a little old-fashioned flat in the
Rue de Rivoli.</p>

<p>The man with the ebony skin, the eyes of jade and the
astrakhan cap bent over Raoul.</p>

<p>"I hope, M. de Chagny," he said, "that you have not betrayed
Erik's secret?"</p>

<p>"And why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?" Raoul
rejoined haughtily, trying to shake off the intruder. "Is he your
friend, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"I hope that you said nothing about Erik, sir, because Erik's
secret is also Christine Daaé's and to talk about one is to talk
about the other!"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said Raoul, becoming more and more impatient, "you
seem to know about many things that interest me; and yet I have
no time to listen to you...."</p>

<p>"Once more, M. de Chagny, where are you going so fast?"</p>

<p>"Can not you guess? To Christine Daaé's assistance...."</p>

<p>"Then, sir, stay here, for Christine Daaé is here!"</p>

<p>"With Erik?"</p>

<p>"With Erik."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I was at the performance and no one in the world but Erik
could contrive an abduction like that!... Oh," he said, with a
deep sigh, "I recognized the monster's touch!..."</p>

<p>"You know him then?"</p>

<p>The Persian did not reply, but heaved a fresh sigh.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Raoul, "I do not know what your intentions are,
but can you do anything to help me? I mean, to help Christine
Daaé?"</p>

<p>"I think so, M. de Chagny, and that is why I spoke to
you."</p>

<p>"What can you do?"</p>

<p>"Try to take you to her... and to him."</p>

<p>"If you can do me that service, sir, my life is yours!... One
word more: the commissary of police tells me that Christine Daaé
has been carried off by my brother, Count Philippe."</p>

<p>"Oh, M. de Chagny, I don't believe a word of it."</p>

<p>"It's not possible, is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know if it is possible or not; but there are ways and
ways of carrying people off; and M. le Comte Philippe has never,
as far as I know, had anything to do with witchcraft."</p>

<p>"Your arguments are convincing, sir, and I am a fool!... Oh,
let us make haste! I place myself entirely in your hands!... How
should I not believe you, when you arc the only one to believe
me.... when you are the only one not to smile when Erik's name is
mentioned?"</p>

<p>And the young man impetuously seized the Persian's hands. They
were ice-cold.</p>

<p>"Silence!" said the Persian, stopping and listening to the
distant sounds of the theater. "We must not mention that name
here. Let us say 'he' and 'him;' then there will be less danger
of attracting his attention."</p>

<p>"Do you think he is near us?"</p>

<p>"It is quite possible, sir, if he is not, at this moment, with
his victim, <i>in the house on the lake</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah, so you know that house too?"</p>

<p>"If he is not there, he may be here, in this wall, in this
floor, in this ceiling!... Come!"</p>

<p>And the Persian, asking Raoul to deaden the sound of his
footsteps, led him down passages which Raoul had never seen
before, even at the time when Christine used to take him for
walks through that labyrinth.</p>

<p>"If only Darius has come!" said the Persian.</p>

<p>"Who is Darius?"</p>

<p>"Darius? My servant."</p>

<p>They were now in the center of a real deserted square, an
immense apartment ill-lit by a small lamp. The Persian stopped
Raoul and, in the softest of whispers, asked:</p>

<p>"What did you say to the commissary?"</p>

<p>"I said that Christine Daaé's abductor was the Angel of Music,
<i>alias</i> the Opera ghost, and that the real name was...."</p>

<p>"Hush!... And did he believe you?"</p>

<p>"He attached no importance to what you said?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He took you for a bit of a madman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So much the better!" sighed the Persian.</p>

<p>And they continued their road. After going up and down several
staircases which Raoul had never seen before, the two men found
themselves in front of a door which the Persian opened with a
master-key. The Persian and Raoul were both, of course, in
dress-clothes; but, whereas Raoul had a tall hat, the Persian
wore the astrakhan cap which I have already mentioned. It was an
infringement of the rule which insists upon the tall hat behind
the scenes; but in France foreigners are allowed every license:
the Englishman his traveling-cap, the Persian his cap of
astrakhan.</p>

<p>"Sir," said the Persian, "your tall hat will be in your way:
you would do well to leave it in the dressing-room."</p>

<p>"What dressing-room?" asked Raoul. "Christine Daaé's."</p>

<p>And the Persian, letting Raoul through the door which he had
just opened, showed him the actress' room opposite.</p>

<p>They were at the end of the passage the whole length of which
Raoul had been accustomed to traverse before knocking at
Christine's door.</p>

<p>"How well you know the Opera, sir!"</p>

<p>"Not so well as 'he' does!" said the Persian modestly.</p>

<p>And he pushed the young man into Christine's dressing-room,
which was as Raoul had left it a few minutes earlier.</p>

<p>Closing the door, the Persian went to a very thin partition
that separated the dressing-room from a big lumber-room next to
it. He listened and then coughed loudly.</p>

<p>There was a sound of some one stirring in the lumber-room;
and, a few seconds later, a finger tapped at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," said the Persian.</p>

<p>A man entered, also wearing an astrakhan cap and dressed in a
long overcoat. He bowed and took a richly carved case from under
his coat, put it on the dressing-table, bowed once again and went
to the door.</p>

<p>"Did no one see you come in, Darius?"</p>

<p>"No, master."</p>

<p>"Let no one see you go out."</p>

<p>The servant glanced down the passage and swiftly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The Persian opened the case. It contained a pair of long
pistols.</p>

<p>"When Christine Daaé was carried off, sir, I sent word to my
servant to bring me these pistols. I have had them a long time
and they can be relied upon."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to fight a duel?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"It will certainly be a duel which we shall have to fight,"
said the other, examining the priming of his pistols. "And what
a duel!" Handing one of the pistols to Raoul, he added, "In
this duel, we shall be two to one; but you must be prepared for
everything, for we shall be fighting the most terrible adversary
that you can imagine. But you love Christine Daaé, do you
not?"</p>

<p>MI worship the ground she stands on! But you, sir, who do not
love her, tell me why I find you ready to risk your life for her!
You must certainly hate Erik!"</p>

<p>"No, sir," said the Persian sadly, "I do not hate him. If I
hated him, he would long ago have ceased doing harm."</p>

<p>"Has he done you harm?"</p>

<p>"I have forgiven him the harm which he has done me."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you. You treat him as a monster, you
speak of his crime, he has done you harm and I find in you the
same inexplicable pity that drove me to despair when I saw it
in Christine!"</p>

<p>The Persian did not reply. He fetched a stool and set it
against the wall facing the great mirror that filled the whole of
the wall-space opposite. Then he climbed on the stool and, with
his nose to the wallpaper, seemed to be looking for
something.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, after a long search, "I have it!"</p>

<p>And, raising his finger above his head, he pressed against a
corner in the pattern of the paper. Then he turned round and
jumped off the stool:</p>

<p>"In half a minute," he said, "we shall be <i>on his road!</i>"
and crossing the whole length of the dressing-room he felt the
great mirror.</p>

<p>"No, it is not yielding yet," he muttered.</p>

<p>"Oh, are we going out by the mirror?" asked Raoul. "Like
Christine Daaé."</p>

<p>"So you knew that Christine Daaé went out by that mirror?"</p>

<p>"She did so before my eyes, sir! I was hidden behind the
curtain of the inner room and I saw her vanish not by the glass,
but in the glass!"</p>

<p>"And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I thought it was an aberration of my senses, a mad
dream...."</p>

<p>"Or some new fancy of the ghost's!" chuckled the Persian. "Ah,
M. de Chagny," he continued, still with his hand on the mirror,
"would that we had to do with a ghost! We could then leave our
pistols in their case.... Put down your hat, please... there...
and now cover your shirt-front as much as you can with your
coat... as I am doing..... Bring the lapels forward... turn up
the collar.... We must make ourselves as invisible as
possible...."</p>

<p>Bearing against the mirror, after a short silence, he
said:</p>

<p>"It takes some time to release the counterbalance, when you
press on the spring from the inside of the room. It is different
when you are behind the wall and can act directly on the
counterbalance. Then the mirror turns at once and is moved with
incredible rapidity."</p>

<p>"What counterbalance?" asked Raoul.</p>

<p>"Why, the counterbalance that lifts the whole of this wall on
to its pivot. You surely don't expect it to move of itself, by
enchantment! If you watch, you will see the mirror first rise an
inch or two and then shift an inch or two from left to right It
will then be on a pivot and will swing round."</p>

<p>"It's not turning!" said Raoul impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait! You have time enough to be impatient, sir! The
mechanism has obviously become rusty, or else the spring isn't
working.... Unless it is something else," added the Persian
anxiously.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He may simply have cut the cord of the counterbalance and
blocked the whole apparatus."</p>

<p>"Why should he? He does not know that we are coming this
way!"</p>

<p>"I dare say he suspects it, for he knows that I understand the
system."</p>

<p>"It's not turning!... And Christine, sir, Christine?"</p>

<p>The Persian said coldly:</p>

<p>"We shall do all that it is humanly possible to do!... But he
may stop us at the first step!... He commands the walls, the
doors and the trap-doors. In my country, he was known by a name
which means the 'trap-door lover.'"</p>

<p>"But why do these walls obey him alone? He did not build
them!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that is just what he did!"</p>

<p>Raoul looked at him in amazement; but the Persian made a sign
to him to be silent and pointed to the glass.... There was a sort
of shivering reflection. Their image was troubled as in a
rippling sheet of water and then all became stationary again.</p>

<p>"You see, sir, that it is not turning! Let us take another
road!"</p>

<p>"To-night, there is no other!" declared the Persian, in a
singularly mournful voice. "And now, look out! And be ready to
fire."</p>

<p>He himself raised his pistol opposite the glass. Raoul
imitated his movement. With his free arm, the Persian drew the
young man to his chest and, suddenly, the mirror turned, in a
blinding daze of cross-lights: it turned like one of those
revolving doors which have lately been fixed to the entrances of
most restaurants, it turned, carrying Raoul and the Persian with
it and suddenly hurling them from the full light into the deepest
darkness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>IN THE CELLARS OF THE OPERA</h3>

<p class="first">"YOUR hand high, ready to fire!" repeated
Raoul's companion quickly.</p>

<p>The wall, behind them, having completed the circle which it
described upon itself, closed again; and the two men stood
motionless for a moment, holding their breath.</p>

<p>At last, the Persian decided to make a movement; and Raoul
heard him slip on his knees and feel for something in the dark
with his groping hands. Suddenly, the darkness was made visible
by a small dark lantern and Raoul instinctively stepped backward
as though to escape the scrutiny of a secret enemy. But he soon
perceived that the light belonged to the Persian, whose movements
he was closely observing.</p>

 <p>The little red disk was turned in every direction and Raoul
 saw that the floor, the walls and the ceiling were all formed of
 planking. It must have been the ordinary road taken by Erik to
 reach Christine's >dressing-room and impose upon her innocence. And
 Raoul, remembering the Persian's remark, thought that it had been
 mysteriously constructed by the ghost himself. Later, he learned that
 Erik had found, all prepared for him, a secret passage, long known to
 himself alone and contrived at the time of the Paris Commune to allow
 the jailers to convey their prisoners straight to the dungeons that
 had been constructed for them in the cellars; for the Federates had
 occupied the opera-house immediately after the eighteenth of March
 and had made a starting-place right at the top for their Mongolfier
 balloons, which carried their incendiary proclamations to the
 departments, and a state prison right at the bottom.</p>

<p>The Persian went on his knees and put his lantern on the
ground. He seemed to be working at the floor; and suddenly he
turned off his light. Then Raoul heard a faint click and saw a
very pale luminous square in the floor of the passage. It was as
though a window had opened on the Opera cellars, which were still
lit. Raoul no longer saw the Persian, but he suddenly felt him by
his side and heard him whisper:</p>

<p>"Follow me and do all that I do."</p>

<p>Raoul turned to the luminous aperture. Then he saw the
Persian, who was still on his knees, hang by his hands from the
rim of the opening, with his pistol between his teeth, and
slide into the cellar below.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the viscount had absolute confidence in the
Persian, though he knew nothing about him. His emotion when
speaking of the "monster" struck him as sincere; and, if the
Persian had cherished any sinister designs against him, he would
not have armed him with his own hands. Besides, Raoul must reach
Christine at all costs. He therefore went on his knees also and
hung from the trap with both hands.</p>

<p>"Let go!" said a voice.</p>

<p>And he dropped into the arms of the Persian, who told him to
lie down flat, closed the trap-door above him and crouched down
beside him. Raoul tried to ask a question, but the Persian's hand
was on his mouth and he heard a voice which he recognized as that
of the commissary of police.</p>

<p>Raoul and the Persian were completely hidden behind a wooden
partition. Near them, a small staircase led to a little room in
which the commissary appeared to be walking up and down, asking
questions. The faint light was just enough to enable Raoul to
distinguish the shape of things around him. And he could not
restrain a dull cry: there were three corpses there.</p>

<p>The first lay on the narrow landing of the little staircase;
the two others had rolled to the bottom of the staircase. Raoul
could have touched one of the two poor wretches by passing his
fingers through the partition.</p>

<p>"Silence!" whispered the Persian. He too had seen the bodies
and he gave one word in explanation: <i>"He!"</i></p>

<p>The commissary's voice was now heard more distinctly. He was
asking for information about the system of lighting, which the
stage-manager supplied. The commissary therefore must be in the
"organ" or its immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>Contrary to what one might think, especially in connection
with an opera-house, the "organ" is not a musical instrument. At
that time, electricity was employed only for a very few scenic
effects and for the bells. The immense building and the stage
itself were still lit by gas; hydrogen was used to regulate and
modify the lighting of a scene; and this was done by means of a
special apparatus which, because of the multiplicity of its
pipes, was known as the "organ." A box beside the prompter's box
was reserved for the chief gas-man, who from there gave his
orders to his assistants and saw that they were executed.
Mauclair stayed in this box during all the performances.</p>

<p>But now Mauclair was not in his box and his assistants not in
their places.</p>

<p>"Mauclair! Mauclair!"</p>

<p>The stage-manager's voice echoed through the cellars. But
Mauclair did not reply.</p>

<p>I have said that a door opened on a little staircase that led
to the second cellar. The commissary pushed it, but it
resisted.</p>

<p>"I say," he said to the stage-manager, "I can't open this
door: is it always so difficult?"</p>

<p>The stage-manager forced it open with his shoulder. He saw
that, at the same time, he was pushing a human body and he could
not keep back an exclamation, for he recognized the body at
once:</p>

<p>"Mauclair! Poor devil! He is dead!"</p>

<p>But Mr. Commissary Mifroid, whom nothing surprised, was
stooping over that big body.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "he is dead-drunk, which is not quite the same
thing."</p>

<p>"It's the first time, if so," said the stage-manager.</p>

<p>"Then some one has given him a narcotic. That is quite
possible."</p>

<p>Mifroid went down a few steps and said: "Look!"</p>

<p>By the light of a little red lantern, at the foot of the
stairs, they saw two other bodies. The stage-manager recognized
Mauclair's assistants. Mifroid went down and listened to their
breathing.</p>

<p>"They are sound asleep," he said. "Very curious business! Some
person unknown must have interfered with the gas-man and his
staff.... and that person unknown was obviously working on behalf
of the kidnapper..... But what a funny idea to kidnap a performer
on the stage! Send for the doctor of the theater, please." And
Mifroid repeated, "Curious, decidedly curious business!"</p>

<p>Then he turned to the little room, addressing the people whom
Raoul and the Persian were unable to see from where they lay.</p>

<p>"What do you say to all this, gentlemen? You are the only ones
who have not given your views. And yet you must have an opinion
of some sort."</p>

<p>Thereupon, Raoul and the Persian saw the startled faces of the
joint managers appear above the landing&mdash;and they heard
Moncharmin's excited voice:</p>

<p>"There are things happening here, Mr. Commissary, which we are
unable to explain."</p>

<p>And the two faces disappeared.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the information, gentlemen," said Mifroid, with
a jeer.</p>

<p>But the stage-manager, holding his chin in the hollow of his
right hand, which is the attitude of profound thought, said:</p>

<p>"It is not the first time that Mauclair has fallen asleep in
the theater. I remember finding him, one evening, snoring in his
little recess, with his snuff-box beside him."</p>

<p>"Is that long ago?" asked M. Mifroid, carefully wiping his
eye-glasses.</p>

<p>"No, not so very long ago.... Wait a bit!... It was the
night... of course, yes... It was the night when
Carlotta&mdash;you know, Mr. Commissary&mdash;gave her famous
'co-ack'!"</p>

<p>"Really? The night when Carlotta gave her famous
'co-ack'?"</p>

<p>And M. Mifroid, replacing his gleaming glasses on his nose,
fixed the stage-manager with a contemplative stare.</p>

<p>"So Mauclair takes snuff, does he?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Commissary..... Look, there is his snuff-box on that
little shelf..... Oh, he's a great snuff-taker!"</p>

<p>"So am I," said Mifroid and put the snuff-box in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Raoul and the Persian, themselves unobserved, watched the
removal of the three bodies by a number of scene-shifters, who
were followed by the commissary and all the people with him.
Their steps were heard for a few minutes on the stage above. When
they were alone the Persian made a sign to Raoul to stand up.
Raoul did so; but, as he did not lift his hand in front of his
eyes, ready to fire, the Persian told him to resume that attitude
and to continue it, whatever happened.</p>

<p>"But it tires the hand unnecessarily," whispered Raoul. "If I
do fire, I shan't be sure of my aim."</p>

<p>"Then shift your pistol to the other hand," said the
Persian.</p>

<p>"I can't shoot with my left hand."</p>

<p>Thereupon, the Persian made this queer reply, which was
certainly not calculated to throw light into the young man's
flurried brain:</p>

<p>"It's not a question of shooting with the right hand or the
left; it's a question of holding one of your hands as though you
were going to pull the trigger of a pistol with your arm bent. As
for the pistol itself, when all is said, you can put that in your
pocket!" And he added, "Let this be clearly understood, or I will
answer for nothing. It is a matter of life and death. And now,
silence and follow me!"</p>

<p>The cellars of the Opera are enormous and they are five in
number. Raoul followed the Persian and wondered what he would
have done without his companion in that extraordinary labyrinth.
They went down to the third cellar; and their progress was still
lit by some distant lamp.</p>

<p>The lower they went, the more precautions the Persian seemed
to take. He kept on turning to Raoul to see if he was holding
his arm properly, showing him how he himself carried his hand
as if always ready to fire, though the pistol was in his
pocket.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a loud voice made them stop. Some one above them
shouted:</p>

<p>"All the door-shutters on the stage! The commissary of police
wants them!"</p>

<p>Steps were heard and shadows glided through the darkness. The
Persian drew Raoul behind a set piece. They saw passing before
and above them old men bent by age and the past burden of
opera-scenery. Some could hardly drag themselves along; others,
from habit, with stooping bodies and outstretched hands, looked
for doors to shut.</p>

<p>They were the door-shutters, the old, worn-out scene-shifters,
on whom a charitable management had taken pity, giving them the
job of shutting doors above and below the stage. They went about
incessantly, from top to bottom of the building, shutting the
doors; and they were also called "The draft-expellers," at least
at that time, for I have little doubt that by now they are all
dead. Drafts are very bad for the voice, wherever they may come
from.[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* M. Pedro Gailhard has himself told me that
he created a few additional posts as door-shutters for old stage-
carpenters whom he was unwilling to dismiss from the service of
the Opera.]</p>
<br>

<p>The Persian and Raoul welcomed this incident, which relieved
them of inconvenient witnesses, for some of those door-shutters,
having nothing else to do or nowhere to lay their heads, stayed
at the Opera, from idleness or necessity, and spent the night
there.</p>

<p>The two men might have stumbled over them, waking them up and
provoking a request for explanations. For the moment, M.
Mifroid's inquiry saved them from any such unpleasant
encounters.</p>

<p>But they were not left to enjoy their solitude for long. Other
shades now came down by the same way by which the door-shutters
had gone up. Each of these shades carried a little lantern and
moved it about, above, below and all around, as though looking
for something or somebody.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" muttered the Persian. "I don't know what they are
looking for, but they might easily find us.... Let us get away,
quick!... Your hand up, sir, ready to fire!... Bend your arm....
more.... that's it!... Hand at the level of your eye, as though
you were fighting a duel and waiting for the word to fire!... Oh,
leave your pistol in your pocket. Quick, come along, down-stairs.
Level of your eye! Question of life or death!... Here, this way,
these stairs!" They reached the fifth cellar. "Oh, what a duel,
sir, what a duel!"</p>

<p>Once in the fifth cellar, the Persian drew breath. He seemed
to enjoy a rather greater sense of security than he had displayed
when they both stopped in the third; but he never altered the
attitude of his hand. And Raoul, remembering the Persian's
observation&mdash;"I know these pistols can be relied
upon"&mdash;was more and more astonished, wondering why any one
should be so gratified at being able to rely upon a pistol which
he did not intend to use!</p>

<p>But the Persian left him no time for reflection. Telling Raoul
to stay where he was, he ran up a few steps of the staircase
which they had just left and then returned.</p>

<p>"How stupid of us!" he whispered. "We shall soon have seen the
end of those men with their lanterns. It is the firemen going
their rounds."[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In those days, it was still part of the
firemen's duty to watch over the safety of the Opera house
outside the performances; but this service has since been
suppressed. I asked M. Pedro Gailhard the reason, and he replied:
"It was because the management was afraid that, in their utter
inexperience of the cellars of the Opera, the firemen might set
fire to the building!"]</p>

<br>

<p>The two men waited five minutes longer. Then the Persian took
Raoul up the stairs again; but suddenly he stopped him with a
gesture. Something moved in the darkness before them.</p>

<p>"Flat on your stomach!" whispered the Persian.</p>

<p>The two men lay flat on the floor.</p>

<p>They were only just in time. A shade, this time carrying no
light, just a shade in the shade, passed. It passed close to
them, near enough to touch them.</p>

<p>They felt the warmth of its cloak upon them. For they could
distinguish the shade sufficiently to see that it wore a cloak
which shrouded it from head to foot. On its head it had a soft
felt hat....</p>

<p>It moved away, drawing its feet against the walls and
sometimes giving a kick into a corner.</p>

<p><br>
"Whew!" said the Persian. "We've had a narrow escape; that
shade knows me and has twice taken me to the managers'
office."</p>

<p>"Is it some one belonging to the theater police?" asked
Raoul.</p>

<p>"It's some one much worse than that!" replied the Persian,
without giving any further explanation.[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Like the Persian, I can give no further
explanation touching the apparition of this shade. Whereas, in
this historic narrative, everything else will be normally
explained, however abnormal the course of events may seem, I can
not give the reader expressly to understand what the Persian
meant by the words, "It is some one much worse than that!" The
reader must try to guess for himself, for I promised M. Pedro
Gailhard, the former manager of the Opera, to keep his secret
regarding the extremely interesting and useful personality of the
wandering, cloaked shade which, while condemning itself to live
in the cellars of the Opera, rendered such immense services to
those who, on gala evenings, for instance, venture to stray away
from the stage. I am speaking of state services; and, upon my
word of honor, I can say no more.]</p>

<br>

<p>"It's not... <i>he</i>?"</p>

<p>"<i>He?</i>... If he does not come behind us, we shall always
see his yellow eyes!... That is more or less our safeguard
to-night.... But he may come from behind, stealing up; and we are
dead men if we do not keep our hands as though about to fire, at
the level of our eyes, in front!"</p>

<p>The Persian had hardly finished speaking, when a fantastic
face came in sight... a whole fiery face, not only two yellow
eyes!</p>

<p>Yes, a head of fire came toward them, at a man's height, but
with no body attached to it. The face shed fire, looked in the
darkness like a flame shaped as a man's face.</p>

<br>
<a id="pic4"></a>
<div align="center">
<img src="fr100120-images/ThePhantomOfTheOpera-3.jpg"
alt="Illustration"
title="Illustration">
<p class="caption">A head of fire came toward them.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"Oh," said the Persian, between his teeth. "I have never seen
this before!... Pampin was not mad, after all: he had seen it!...
What can that flame be? It is not <i>he</i>, but he may have sent
it!... Take care!... Take care!... Your hand at the level of your
eyes, in Heaven's name, at the level of your eyes!... I know most
of his tricks... but not this one.... Come, let us run... It is
safer.... Hand at the level of your eyes!"</p>

<p>And they fled down the long passage that opened before
them.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, that seemed to them like long minutes,
they stopped.</p>

<p>"He doesn't often come this way," said the Persian. "This side
has nothing to do with him. This side does not lead to the lake
nor to the house on the lake..... But perhaps he knows that we
are at his heels... although I promised him to leave him alone
and never to meddle in his business again!"</p>

<p>So saying, he turned his head and Raoul also turned his head;
and they again saw the head of fire behind their two heads. It
had followed them. And it must have run also, and perhaps faster
than they, for it seemed to be nearer to them.</p>

<p>At the same time, they began to perceive a certain noise of
which they could not guess the nature. They simply noticed that
the sound seemed to move and to approach with the fiery face. It
was a noise as though thousands of nails had been scraped against
a blackboard, the perfectly unendurable noise that is sometimes
made by a little stone inside the chalk that grates on the
blackboard.</p>

<p>They continued to retreat, but the fiery face came on, came
on, gaining on them. They could see its features clearly now. The
eyes were round and staring, the nose a little crooked and the
mouth large, with a hanging lower lip, very like the eyes, nose
and lip of the moon, when the moon is quite red, bright red.</p>

<p>How did that red moon manage to glide through the darkness, at
a man's height, with nothing to support it, at least apparently?
And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring,
staring eyes? And what was that scratching, scraping, grating
sound which it brought with it?</p>

<p>The Persian and Raoul could retreat no farther and flattened
themselves against the wall, not knowing what was going to happen
because of that incomprehensible head of fire, and especially
now, because of the more intense, swarming, living, "numerous"
sound, for the sound was certainly made up of hundreds of little
sounds that moved in the darkness, under the fiery face.</p>

<p>And the fiery face came on... with its noise... came level
with them!...</p>

<p>And the two companions, flat against their wall, felt their
hair stand on end with horror, for they now knew what the
thousand noises meant. They came in a troop, hustled along in the
shadow by innumerable little hurried waves, swifter than the
waves that rush over the sands at high tide, little night-waves
foaming under the moon, under the fiery head that was like a
moon. And the little waves passed between their legs, climbing up
their legs, irresistibly, and Raoul and the Persian could no
longer restrain their cries of horror, dismay and pain. Nor could
they continue to hold their hands at the level of their eyes:
their hands went down to their legs to push back the waves, which
were full of little legs and nails and claws and teeth.</p>

<p>Yes, Raoul and the Persian were ready to faint, like Pampin
the fireman. But the head of fire turned round in answer to their
cries, and spoke to them:</p>

<p>"Don't move! Don't move!... Whatever you do, don't come after
me!... I am the rat-catcher!... Let me pass, with my
rats!..."</p>

<p>And the head of fire disappeared, vanished in the darkness,
while the passage in front of it lit up, as the result of the
change which the rat-catcher had made in his dark lantern.
Before, so as not to scare the rats in front of him, he had
turned his dark lantern on himself, lighting up his own head;
now, to hasten their flight, he lit the dark space in front of
him. And he jumped along, dragging with him the waves of
scratching rats, all the thousand sounds.</p>

<p>Raoul and the Persian breathed again, though still
trembling.</p>

<p>"I ought to have remembered that Erik talked to me about the
rat-catcher," said the Persian. "But he never told me that he
looked like that... and it's funny that I should never have met
him before.... Of course, Erik never comes to this part!"</p>

<p>"Are we very far from the lake, sir?" asked Raoul. "When shall
we get there?... Take me to the lake, oh, take me to the lake!...
When we are at the lake, we will call out!... Christine will hear
us!.. And <i>he</i> will hear us, too!... And, as you know him,
we shall talk to him!"</p>

<p>"Baby!" said the Persian. "We shall never enter the house on
the lake by the lake!... I myself have never landed on the other
bank... the bank on which the house stands.... You have to cross
the lake first... and it is well guarded!... I fear that more
than one of those men&mdash;old scene-shifters, old
door-shutters&mdash;who have never been seen again were simply
tempted to cross the lake.... It is terrible.... I myself would
have been nearly killed there... if the monster had not
recognized me in time!... One piece of advice, sir; never go near
the lake..... And, above all, shut your ears if you hear the
voice singing under the water, the siren's voice!"</p>

<p>"But then, what are we here for?" asked Raoul, in a transport
of fever, impatience and rage. "If <i>you</i> can do nothing for
Christine, at least let <i>me</i> die for her!"</p>

<p>The Persian tried to calm the young man.</p>

<p>"We have only one means of saving Christine Daaé, believe me,
which is to enter the house unperceived by the monster."</p>

<p>"And is there any hope of that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah, if I had not that hope, I would not have come to fetch
you!"</p>

<p>"And how can one enter the house on the lake without crossing
the lake?"</p>

<p>"From the third cellar, from which we were so unluckily driven
away. We will go back there now.... I will tell you," said the
Persian, with a sudden change in his voice, "I will tell you the
exact place, sir: it is between a set piece and a discarded scene
from <i>Roi de Lahore</i>, exactly at the spot where Joseph
Buquet died.... Come, sir, take courage and follow me! And hold
your hand at the level of your eyes!... But where are we?"</p>

<p>The Persian lit his lamp again and flung its rays down two
enormous corridors that crossed each other at right angles.</p>

<p>"We must be," he said, "in the part used more particularly for
the waterworks. I see no fire coming from the furnaces."</p>

<p>He went in front of Raoul, seeking his road, stopping abruptly
when he was afraid of meeting some waterman. Then they had to
protect themselves against the glow of a sort of underground
forge, which the men were extinguishing, and at which Raoul
recognized the demons whom Christine had seen at the time of her
first captivity.</p>

<p>In this way, they gradually arrived beneath the huge cellars
below the stage. They must at this time have been at the very
bottom of the "tub" and at an extremely great depth, when we
remember that the earth was dug out at fifty feet below the water
that lay under the whole of that part of Paris.[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* All the water had to be exhausted, in the
building of the Opera. To give an idea of the amount of water
that was pumped up, I can tell the reader that it represented the
area of the court-yard of the Louvre and a height half as deep
again as the towers of Nôtre Dame. And nevertheless the engineers
had to leave a lake.]</p>

<br>

<p>The Persian touched a partition-wall and said: "If I am not
mistaken, this is a wall that might easily belong to the house on
the lake."</p>

<p>He was striking a partition-wall of the "tub," and perhaps it
would be as well for the reader to know how the bottom and the
partition-walls of the tub were built. In order to prevent the
water surrounding the building-operations from remaining in
immediate contact with the walls supporting the whole of the
theatrical machinery, the architect was obliged to build a double
case in every direction. The work of constructing this double
case took a whole yean It was the wall of the first inner case
that the Persian struck when speaking to Raoul of the house on
the lake. To any one understanding the architecture of the
edifice, the Persian's action would seem to indicate that Erik's
mysterious house had been built in the double case, formed of a
thick wall constructed as an embankment or dam, then of a brick
wall, a tremendous layer of cement and another wall several yards
in thickness.</p>

<p>At the Persian's words, Raoul flung himself against the wall
and listened eagerly. But he heard nothing... nothing... except
distant steps sounding on the floor of the upper portions of the
theater.</p>

<p>The Persian darkened his lantern again.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he said. "Keep your hand up! And silence! For we
shall try another way of getting in."</p>

<p>And he led him to the little staircase by which they had come
down lately.</p>

<p>They went up, stopping at each step, peering into the darkness
and the silence, till they came to the third cellar. Here the
Persian motioned to Raoul to go on his knees; and, in this way,
crawling on both knees and one hand&mdash;for the other hand was
held in the position indicated&mdash;they reached the end
wall.</p>

<p>Against this wall stood a large discarded scene from the
<i>Roi de Lahore</i>. Close to this scene was a set piece.
Between the scene and the set piece there was just room for a
body... for a body which one day was found hanging there. The
body of Joseph Buquet.</p>

<p>The Persian, still kneeling, stopped and listened. For a
moment, he seemed to hesitate and looked at Raoul; then he turned
his eyes upward, toward the second cellar, which sent down the
faint glimmer of a lantern, through a cranny between two boards.
This glimmer seemed to trouble the Persian.</p>

<p>At last, he tossed his head and made up his mind to act. He
slipped between the set piece and the scene from the <i>Roi de
Lahore</i>, with Raoul close upon his heels. With his free hand,
the Persian felt the wall. Raoul saw him bear heavily upon the
wall, just as he had pressed against the wall in Christine's
dressing-room. Then a stone gave way, leaving a hole in the
wall.</p>

<p>This time, the Persian took his pistol from his pocket and
made a sign to Raoul to do as he did. He cocked the pistol.</p>

<p>And, resolutely, still on his knees, he wiggled through the
hole in the wall. Raoul, who had wished to pass first, had to be
content to follow him.</p>

<p>The hole was very narrow. The Persian stopped almost at once.
Raoul heard him feeling the stones around him. Then the Persian
took out his dark lantern again, stooped forward, examined
something beneath him and immediately extinguished his lantern.
Raoul heard him say, in a whisper:</p>

<p>"We shall have to drop a few yards, without making a noise;
take off your boots."</p>

<p>The Persian handed his own shoes to Raoul.</p>

<p>"Put them outside the wall," he said. "We shall find them
there when we leave."[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* These two pairs of boots, which were
placed, according to the Persian's papers, just between the set
piece and the scene from the <i>Roi de Lahore</i>, on the spot
where Joseph Buquet was found hanging, were never discovered.
They must have been taken by some stage-carpenter or "door-
shutter."]</p>

<br>

<p>He crawled a little farther on his knees, then turned right
round and said:</p>

<p>"I am going to hang by my hands from the edge of the stone and
let myself drop <i>into his house</i>. You must do exactly the
same. Do not be afraid. I will catch you in my arms."</p>

<p>Raoul soon heard a dull sound, evidently produced by the fall
of the Persian, and then dropped down.</p>

<p>He felt himself clasped in the Persian's arms.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Persian.</p>

<p>And they stood motionless, listening.</p>

<p>The darkness was thick around them, the silence heavy and
terrible.</p>

<p>Then the Persian began to make play with the dark lantern
again, turning the rays over their heads, looking for the hole
through which they had come, and failing to find it:</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "The stone has closed of itself!"</p>

<p>And the light of the lantern swept down the wall and over the
floor.</p>

<p>The Persian stooped and picked up something, a sort of cord,
which he examined for a second and flung away with horror.</p>

<p>"The Punjab lasso!" he muttered.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Raoul.</p>

<p>The Persian shivered. "It might very well be the rope by which
the man was hanged, and which was looked for so long."</p>

<p>And, suddenly seized with fresh anxiety, he moved the little
red disk of his lantern over the walls. In this way, he lit up a
curious thing: the trunk of a tree, which seemed still quite
alive, with its leaves; and the branches of that tree ran right
up the walls and disappeared in the ceiling.</p>

<p>Because of the smallness of the luminous disk, it was
difficult at first to make out the appearance of things: they saw
a corner of a branch... and a leaf... and another leaf... and,
next to it, nothing at all, nothing but the ray of light that
seemed to reflect itself.... Raoul passed his hand over that
nothing, over that reflection.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he said. "The wall is a looking-glass!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a looking-glass!" said the Persian, in a tone of deep
emotion. And, passing the hand that held the pistol over his
moist forehead, he added, "We have dropped into the
torture-chamber!"</p>

<h3>INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE VICISSITUDES<br>
OF A PERSIAN IN THE CELLARS OF THE OPERA</h3>

<h3><i>The Persian's Narrative</i></h3>

<p class="first">
IT WAS the first time that I entered the house on the lake. I
had often begged the "trap-door lover," as we used to call Erik
in my country, to open its mysterious doors to me. He always
refused. I made very many attempts, but in vain, to obtain
admittance. Watch him as I might, after I first learned that he
had taken up his permanent abode at the Opera, the darkness was
always too thick to enable me to see how he worked the door in
the wall on the lake. One day, when I thought myself alone, I
stepped into the boat and rowed toward that part of the wall
through which I had seen Erik disappear. It was then that I came
into contact with the siren who guarded the approach and whose
charm was very nearly fatal to me.</p>

<p>I had no sooner put off from the bank than the silence amid
which I floated on the water was disturbed by a sort of whispered
singing that hovered all around me. It was half breath, half
music; it rose softly from the waters of the lake; and I was
surrounded by it through I knew not what artifice.</p>

<p>It followed me, moved with me and was so soft that it did not
alarm me. On the contrary, in my longing to approach the source
of that sweet and enticing harmony, I leaned out of my little
boat over the water, for there was no doubt in my mind that the
singing came from the water itself. By this time, I was alone in
the boat in the middle of the lake; the voice&mdash;for it was
now distinctly a voice&mdash;was beside me, on the water. I
leaned over, leaned still farther. The lake was perfectly calm,
and a moonbeam that passed through the air hole in the Rue Scribe
showed me absolutely nothing on its surface, which was smooth and
black as ink. I shook my ears to get rid of a possible humming;
but I soon had to accept the fact that there was no humming in
the ears so harmonious as the singing whisper that followed and
now attracted me.</p>

<p>Had I been inclined to superstition, I should have certainly
thought that I had to do with some siren whose business it was to
confound the traveler who should venture on the waters of the
house on the lake. Fortunately, I come from a country where we
are too fond of fantastic things not to know them through and
through; and I had no doubt but that I was face to face with some
new invention of Erik's. But this invention was so perfect that,
as I leaned out of the boat, I was impelled less by a desire to
discover its trick than to enjoy its charm; and I leaned out,
leaned out until I almost overturned the boat.</p>

<p>Suddenly, two monstrous arms issued from the bosom of the
waters and seized me by the neck, dragging me down to the depths
with irresistible force.</p>

<p>I should certainly have been lost, if I had not had time to
give a cry by which Erik knew me. For it was he; and, instead of
drowning me, as was certainly his first intention, he swam with
me and laid me gently on the bank:</p>

<p>"How imprudent you are!" he said, as he stood before me,
dripping with water. "Why try to enter my house? I never invited
you! I don't want you there, nor anybody! Did you save my life
only to make it unbearable to me? However great the service you
rendered him, Erik may end by forgetting it; and you know that
nothing can restrain Erik, not even Erik himself."</p>

<p>He spoke, but I had now no other wish than to know what I
already called the trick of the siren. He satisfied my curiosity,
for Erik, who is a real monster&mdash;I have seen him at work in
Persia, alas&mdash;is also, in certain respects, a regular child,
vain and self-conceited, and there is nothing he loves so much,
after astonishing people, as to prove all the really miraculous
ingenuity of his mind.</p>

<p>He laughed and showed me a long reed.</p>

<p>"It's the silliest trick you ever saw," he said, "but it's
very useful for breathing and singing in the water. I learned it
from the Tonkin pirates, who are able to remain hidden for hours
in the beds of the rivers."[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* An official report from Tonkin, received
in Paris at the end of July, 1909, relates how the famous pirate
chief De Tham was tracked, together with his men, by our
soldiers, and how all of them succeeded in escaping, thanks to
this trick of the reeds.}</p>

<br>

<p>I spoke to him severely.</p>

<p>"It's a trick that nearly killed me!" I said. "And it may have
been fatal to others! You know what you promised me, Erik? No
more murders!"</p>

<p>"Have I really committed murders?" he asked, putting on his
most amiable air.</p>

<p>"Wretched man!" I cried. "Have you forgotten the rosy hours of
Mazenderan?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, in a sadder tone, "I prefer to forget them.
I used to make the little sultana laugh, though!"</p>

<p>"All that belongs to the past," I declared; "but there is the
present... and you are responsible to me for the present,
because, if I had wished, there would have been none at all for
you. Remember that, Erik: I saved your life!"</p>

<p>And I took advantage of the turn of conversation to speak to
him of something that had long been on my mind:</p>

<p>"Erik," I asked, "Erik, swear that...."</p>

<p>"What?" he retorted. "You know I never keep my oaths. Oaths
are made to catch gulls with."</p>

<p>"Tell me... you can tell me, at any rate...."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, the chandelier... the chandelier, Erik?..."</p>

<p>"What about the chandelier?"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh," he sniggered, "I don't mind telling you about the
chandelier!... <i>It wasn't I!</i>... The chandelier was very old
and worn."</p>

<p>When Erik laughed, he was more terrible than ever. He jumped
into the boat, chuckling so horribly that I could not help
trembling.</p>

<p>"Very old and worn, my dear daroga![*] Very old and worn, the
chandelier!... It fell of itself!... It came down with a
smash!... And now, daroga, take my advice and go and dry
yourself, or you'll catch a cold in the head!... And never get
into my boat again. . 'And, whatever you do, don't try to enter
my house: I'm not always there.... daroga! And I should be sorry
to have to dedicate my Requiem Mass to you!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Daroga</i> is Persian for chief of
police.]</p>

<br>

<p>So saying, swinging to and fro, like a monkey, and still
chuckling, he pushed off and soon disappeared in the darkness of
the lake.</p>

<p>From that day, I gave up all thought of penetrating into his
house by the lake. That entrance was obviously too well guarded,
especially since he had learned that I knew about it. But I felt
that there must be another entrance, for I had often seen Erik
disappear in the third cellar, when I was watching him, though I
could not imagine how.</p>

<p>Ever since I had discovered Erik installed in the Opera, I
lived in a perpetual terror of his horrible fancies, not in so
far as I was concerned, but I dreaded everything for others.[*]
And whenever some accident, some fatal event happened, I always
thought to myself, "I should not be surprised if that were Erik,"
even as others used to say, "It's the ghost!" How often have I
not heard people utter that phrase with a smile! Poor devils! If
they had known that the ghost existed in the flesh, I swear they
would not have laughed!</p>

<p class="footnote">]* The Persian might easily have admitted
that Erik's fate also interested himself, for he was well aware
that, if the government of Teheran had learned that Erik was
still alive, it would have been all up with the modest pension of
the erstwhile daroga. It is only fair, however, to add that the
Persian had a noble and generous heart; and I do not doubt for a
moment that the catastrophes which he feared for others greatly
occupied his mind. His conduct, throughout this business, proves
it and is above all praise.]</p>

<br>

<p>Although Erik announced to me very solemnly that he had
changed and that he had become the most virtuous of men <i>since
he was loved for himself</i>&mdash;a sentence that, at first,
perplexed me most terribly&mdash;I could not help shuddering when
I thought of the monster. His horrible, unparalleled and
repulsive ugliness put him without the pale of humanity; and it
often seemed to me that, for this reason, he no longer believed
that he had any duty toward the human race. The way in which he
spoke of his love-affairs only increased my alarm, for I foresaw
the cause of fresh and more hideous tragedies in this event to
which he alluded so boastfully.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I soon discovered the curious moral traffic
established between the monster and Christine Daaé. Hiding in the
lumber-room next to the young prima donna's dressing-room, I
listened to wonderful musical displays that evidently flung
Christine into marvelous ecstasy; but, all the same, I would
never have thought that Erik's voice&mdash;which was loud as
thunder or soft as angels' voices, at will&mdash;could have made
her forget his ugliness. I understood all when I learned that
Christine had not yet seen him! I had occasion to go to the
dressing-room and, remembering the lessons he had once given me,
I had no difficulty in discovering the trick that made the wall
with the mirror swing round and I ascertained the means&mdash;of
hollow bricks and so on&mdash;by which he made his voice carry to
Christine as though she heard it close beside her. In this way
also I discovered the road that led to the well and the
dungeon&mdash;the Communists' dungeon&mdash;and also the
trap-door that enabled Erik to go straight to the cellars below
the stage.</p>

<p>A few days later, what was not my amazement to learn by my own
eyes and ears that Erik and Christine Daaé saw each other and to
catch the monster stooping over the little well, in the
Communists' road and sprinkling the forehead of Christine Daaé,
who had fainted. A white horse, the horse out of the
<i>Profeta</i>, which had disappeared from the stables under the
Opera, was standing quietly beside them. I showed myself. It was
terrible. I saw sparks fly from those yellow eyes and, before I
had time to say a word, I received a blow on the head that
stunned me.</p>

<p>When I came to myself, Erik, Christine and the white horse had
disappeared. I felt sure that the poor girl was a prisoner in the
house on the lake. Without hesitation, I resolved to return to
the bank, notwithstanding the attendant danger. For twenty-four
hours, I lay in wait for the monster to appear; for I felt that
he must go out, driven by the need of obtaining provisions. And,
in this connection, I may say, that, when he went out in the
streets or ventured to show himself in public, he wore a
pasteboard nose, with a mustache attached to it, instead of his
own horrible hole of a nose. This did not quite take away his
corpse-like air, but it made him almost, I say almost, endurable
to look at.</p>

<p>I therefore watched on the bank of the lake and, weary of long
waiting, was beginning to think that he had gone through the
other door, the door in the third cellar, when I heard a slight
splashing in the dark, I saw the two yellow eyes shining like
candles and soon the boat touched shore. Erik jumped out and
walked up to me:</p>

<p>"You've been here for twenty-four hours," he said, "and you're
annoying me. I tell you, all this will end very badly. And you
will have brought it upon yourself; for I have been
extraordinarily patient with you. You think you are following me,
you great booby, whereas it's I who am following you; and I know
all that you know about me, here. I spared you yesterday, in
<i>my Communists' road</i>; but I warn you, seriously, don't let
me catch you there again! Upon my word, you don't seem able to
take a hint!"</p>

<p>He was so furious that I did not think, for the moment, of
interrupting him. After puffing and blowing like a walrus, he put
his horrible thought into words:</p>

<p>"Yes, you must learn, once and for all&mdash;once and for all,
I say&mdash;to take a hint! I tell you that, with your
recklessness&mdash;for you have already been twice arrested by
the shade in the felt hat, who did not know what you were doing
in the cellars and took you to the managers, who looked upon you
as an eccentric Persian interested in stage mechanism and life
behind the scenes: I know all about it, I was there, in the
office; you know I am everywhere&mdash;well, I tell you that,
with your recklessness, they will end by wondering what you are
after here... and they will end by knowing that you are after
Erik... and then they will be after Erik themselves and they will
discover the house on the lake.... If they do, it will be a bad
lookout for you, old chap, a bad lookout!... I won't answer for
anything."</p>

<p>Again he puffed and blew like a walrus.</p>

<p>"I won't answer for anything!... If Erik's secrets cease to be
Erik's secrets, <i>it will be a bad look out for a goodly number
of the human race!</i> That's all I have to tell you, and unless
you are a great booby, it ought to be enough for you.... except
that you don't know how to take a hint."</p>

<p>He had sat down on the stern of his boat and was kicking his
heels against the planks, waiting to hear what I had to answer. I
simply said:</p>

<p>"It's not Erik that I'm after here!"</p>

<p>"Who then?"</p>

<p>"You know as well as I do: it's Christine Daaé," I
answered.</p>

<p>He retorted: "I have every right to see her in my own house. I
am loved for my own sake."</p>

<p>"That's not true," I said. "You have carried her off and are
keeping her locked up."</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "Will you promise never to meddle with my
affairs again, if I prove to you that I am loved for my own
sake?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise you," I replied, without hesitation, for I
felt convinced that for such a monster the proof was
impossible.</p>

<p>"Well, then, it's quite simple..... Christine Daaé shall leave
this as she pleases and come back again!... Yes, come back again,
because she wishes.... come back of herself, because she loves me
for myself!..."</p>

<p>"Oh, I doubt if she will come back!... But it is your duty to
let her go."</p>

<p>"My duty, you great booby!... It is my wish.... my wish to let
her go; and she will come back again.... for she loves me!... All
this will end in a marriage... a marriage at the Madeleine, you
great booby! Do you believe me now? When I tell you that my
nuptial mass is written.... wait till you hear the
<i>Kyrie</i>...."</p>

<p>He beat time with his heels on the planks of the boat and
sang:</p>

<p><i>"Kyrie!... Kyrie!... Kyrie eleison</i>!... Wait till you
hear, wait till you hear that mass."</p>

<p>"Look here," I said. "I shall believe you if I see Christine
Daaé come out of the house on the lake and go back to it of her
own accord."</p>

<p>"And you won't meddle any more in my affairs?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Very well, you shall see that to-night. Come to the masked
ball. Christine and I will go and have a look round. Then you can
hide in the lumber-room and you shall see Christine, who will
have gone to her dressing-room, delighted to come back by the
Communists' road.... And, now, be off, for I must go and do some
shopping!"</p>

<p>To my intense astonishment, things happened as he had
announced. Christine Daaé left the house on the lake and returned
to it several times, without, apparently, being forced to do so.
It was very difficult for me to clear my mind of Erik. However, I
resolved to be extremely prudent, and did not make the mistake of
returning to the shore of the lake, or of going by the
Communists' road. But the idea of the secret entrance in the
third cellar haunted me, and I repeatedly went and waited for
hours behind a scene' from the <i>Roi de Lahore</i>, which had
been left there for some reason or other. At last my patience was
rewarded. One day, I saw the monster come toward me, on his
knees. I was certain that he could not see me. He passed between
the scene behind which I stood and a set piece, went to the wall
and pressed on a spring that moved a stone and afforded him an
ingress. He passed through this, and the stone closed behind
him.</p>

<p>I waited for at least thirty minutes and then pressed the
spring in my turn. Everything happened as with Erik. But I was
careful not to go through the hole myself, for I knew that Erik
was inside. On the other hand, the idea that I might be caught by
Erik suddenly made me think of the death of Joseph Buquet. I did
not wish to jeopardize the advantages of so great a discovery
which might be useful to many people, "to a goodly number of the
human race," in Erik's words; and I left the cellars of the Opera
after carefully replacing the stone.</p>

<p>I continued to be greatly interested in the relations between
Erik and Christine Daaé, not from any morbid curiosity, but
because of the terrible thought which obsessed my mind that Erik
was capable of anything, if he once discovered that he was not
loved for his own sake, as he imagined. I continued to wander,
very cautiously, about the Opera and soon learned the truth about
the monster's dreary love-affair.</p>

<p>He filled Christine's mind, through the terror with which he
inspired her, but the dear child's heart belonged wholly to the
Vicomte Raoul de Chagny. While they played about, like an
innocent engaged couple, on the upper floors of the Opera, to
avoid the monster, they little suspected that some one was
watching over them. I was prepared to do anything: to kill the
monster, if necessary, and explain to the police afterward. But
Erik did not show himself; and I felt none the more comfortable
for that.</p>

<p>I must explain my whole plan. I thought that the monster,
being driven from his house by jealousy, would thus enable me to
enter it, without danger, through the passage in the third
cellar. It was important, for everybody's sake, that I should
know exactly what was inside. One day, tired of waiting for an
opportunity, I moved the stone and at once heard an astounding
music: the monster was working at his <i>Don Juan Triumphant</i>,
with every door in his house wide open. I knew that this was the
work of his life. I was careful not to stir and remained
prudently in my dark hole.</p>

<p>He stopped playing, for a moment, and began walking about his
place, like a madman. And he said aloud, at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p>"It must be finished <i>first</i>! Quite finished!"</p>

<p>This speech was not calculated to reassure me and, when the
music recommenced, I closed the stone very softly.</p>

<p>On the day of the abduction of Christine Daaé, I did not come
to the theater until rather late in the evening, trembling lest I
should hear bad news. I had spent a horrible day, for, after
reading in a morning paper the announcement of a forthcoming
marriage between Christine and the Vicomte de Chagny, I wondered
whether, after all, I should not do better to denounce the
monster. But reason returned to me, and I was persuaded that this
action could only precipitate a possible catastrophe.</p>

<p>When my cab set me down before the Opera, I was really almost
astonished to see it still standing! But I am something of a
fatalist, like all good Orientals, and I entered ready for
anything.</p>

<p>Christine Daaé's abduction in the Prison Act, which naturally
surprised everybody, found me prepared. I was quite certain that
she had been juggled away by Erik, that prince of conjurers. And
I thought positively that this was the end of Christine and
perhaps of everybody, so much so that I thought of advising all
these people who were staying on at the theater to make good
their escape. I felt, however, that they would be sure to look
upon me as mad and I refrained.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I resolved to act without further delay, as
far as I was concerned. The chances were in my favor that Erik,
at that moment, was thinking only of his captive. This was the
moment to enter his house through the third cellar; and I
resolved to take with me that poor little desperate viscount,
who, at the first suggestion, accepted, with an amount of
confidence in myself that touched me profoundly. I had sent my
servant for my pistols. I gave one to the viscount and advised
him to hold himself ready to fire, for, after all, Erik might be
waiting for us behind the wall. We were to go by the Communists'
road and through the trap-door.</p>

<p>Seeing my pistols, the little viscount asked me if we were
going to fight a duel. I said:</p>

<p>"Yes; and what a duel!"</p>

<p>But, of course, I had no time to explain anything to him. The
little viscount is a brave fellow, but he knew hardly anything
about his adversary; and it was so much the better. My great fear
was that he was already somewhere near us, preparing the Punjab
lasso. No one knows better than he how to throw the Punjab lasso,
for he is the king of stranglers even as he is the prince of
conjurors. When he had finished making the little sultana laugh,
at the time of the "rosy hours of Mazenderan," she herself used
to ask him to amuse her by giving her a thrill. It was then that
he introduced the sport of the Punjab lasso.</p>

<p>He had lived in India and acquired an incredible skill in the
art of strangulation. He would make them lock him into a
courtyard to which they brought a warrior&mdash;usually, a man
condemned to death&mdash;armed with a long pike and broadsword.
Erik had only his lasso; and it was always just when the warrior
thought that he was going to fell Erik with a tremendous blow
that we heard the lasso whistle through the air. With a turn of
the wrist, Erik tightened the noose round his adversary's neck
and, in this fashion, dragged him before the little sultana and
her women, who sat looking from a window and applauding. The
little sultana herself learned to wield the Punjab lasso and
killed several of her women and even of the friends who visited
her. But I prefer to drop this terrible subject of the rosy hours
of Mazenderan. I have mentioned it only to explain why, on
arriving with the Vicomte de Chagny in the cellars of the Opera,
I was bound to protect my companion against the ever-threatening
danger of death by strangling. My pistols could serve no purpose,
for Erik was not likely to show himself; but Erik could always
strangle us. I had no time to explain all this to the viscount;
besides, there was nothing to be gained by complicating the
position. I simply told M. de Chagny to keep his hand at the
level of his eyes, with the arm bent, as though waiting for the
command to fire. With his victim in this attitude, it is
impossible even for the most expert strangler to throw the lasso
with advantage. It catches you not only round the neck, but also
round the arm or hand. This enables you easily to unloose the
lasso, which then becomes harmless.</p>

<p>After avoiding the commissary of police, a number of
door-shutters and the firemen, after meeting the rat-catcher and
passing the man in the felt hat unperceived, the viscount and I
arrived without obstacle in the third cellar, between the set
piece and the scene from the <i>Roi de Lahore</i>. I worked the
stone, and we jumped into the house which Erik had built himself
in the double case of the foundation-walls of the Opera. And this
was the easiest thing in the world for him to do, because Erik
was one of the chief contractors under Philippe Gamier, the
architect of the Opera, and continued to work by himself when the
works were officially suspended, during the war, the siege of
Paris and the Commune.</p>

<p>I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping
into his house. I knew what he had made of a certain palace at
Mazenderan. From being the most honest building conceivable, he
soon turned it into a house of the very devil, where you could
not utter a word but it was overheard or repeated by an echo.
With his trap-doors the monster was responsible for endless
tragedies of all kinds. He hit upon astonishing inventions. Of
these, the most curious, horrible and dangerous was the so-called
torture-chamber. Except in special cases, when the little sultana
amused herself by inflicting suffering upon some unoffending
citizen, no one was let into it but wretches condemned to death.
And, even then, when these had "had enough," they were always at
liberty to put an end to themselves with a Punjab lasso or
bowstring, left for their use at the foot of an iron tree.</p>

<p>My alarm, therefore, was great when I saw that the room into
which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and I had dropped was an exact copy
of the torture-chamber of the rosy hours of Mazenderan. At our
feet, I found the Punjab lasso which I had been dreading all the
evening. I was convinced that this rope had already done duty for
Joseph Buquet, who, like myself, must have caught Erik one
evening working the stone in the third cellar. He probably tried
it in his turn, fell into the torture-chamber and only left it
hanged. I can well imagine Erik dragging the body, in order to
get rid of it, to the scene from the <i>Roi de Lahore</i>, and
hanging it there as an example, or to increase the superstitious
terror that was to help him in guarding the approaches to his
lair! Then, upon reflection, Erik went back to fetch the Punjab
lasso, which is very curiously made out of catgut, and which
might have set an examining magistrate thinking. This explains
the disappearance of the rope.</p>

<p>And now I discovered the lasso, at our feet, in the
torture-chamber!... I am no coward, but a cold sweat covered my
forehead as I moved the little red disk of my lantern over the
walls.</p>

<p>M. de Chagny noticed it and asked:</p>

<p>"What is the matter, sir?"</p>

<p>I made him a violent sign to be silent.</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>IN THE TORTURE CHAMBER</h3>

<h3>The Persian's Narrative Continued</h3>

<p class="first">
WE were in the middle of a little six-cornered room, the sides
of which were covered with mirrors from top to bottom. In the
corners, we could clearly see the "joins" in the glasses, the
segments intended to turn on their gear; yes, I recognized them
and I recognized the iron tree in the corner, at the bottom of
one of those segments.... the iron tree, with its iron branch,
for the hanged men.</p>

<p>I seized my companion's arm: the Vicomte de Chagny was all
a-quiver, eager to shout to his betrothed that he was bringing
her help. I feared that he would not be able to contain
himself.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we heard a noise on our left. It sounded at first
like a door opening and shutting in the next room; and then there
was a dull moan. I clutched M. de Chagny's arm more firmly still;
and then we distinctly heard these words:</p>

<p>"You must make your choice! The wedding mass or the requiem
mass!"</p>

<p>I recognized the voice of the monster.</p>

<p>There was another moan, followed by a long silence.</p>

<p>I was persuaded by now that the monster was unaware of our
presence in his house, for otherwise he would certainly have
managed not to let us hear him. He would only have had to close
the little invisible window through which the torture-lovers look
down into the torture-chamber. Besides, I was certain that, if he
had known of our presence, the tortures would have begun at
once.</p>

<p>The important thing was not to let him know; and I dreaded
nothing so much as the impulsiveness of the Vicomte de Chagny,
who wanted to rush through the walls to Christine Daaé, whose
moans we continued to hear at intervals.</p>

<p>"The requiem mass is not at all gay," Erik's voice resumed,
"whereas the wedding mass&mdash;you can take my word for
it&mdash;is magnificent! You must take a resolution and know your
own mind! I can't go on living like this, like a mole in a
burrow! <i>Don Juan Triumphant</i> is finished; and now I want to
live like everybody else. I want to have a wife like everybody
else and to take her out on Sundays. I have invented a mask that
makes me look like anybody. People will not even turn round in
the streets. You will be the happiest of women. And we will sing,
all by ourselves, till we swoon away with delight. You are
crying! You are afraid of me! And yet I am not really wicked.
Love me and you shall see! All I wanted was to be loved for
myself. If you loved me I should be as gentle as a lamb; and you
could do anything with me that you pleased."</p>

<p>Soon the moans that accompanied this sort of love's litany
increased and increased. I have never heard anything more
despairing; and M. de Chagny and I recognized that this terrible
lamentation came from Erik himself. Christine seemed to be
standing dumb with horror, without the strength to cry out, while
the monster was on his knees before her.</p>

<p>Three times over, Erik fiercely bewailed his fate: "You don't
love me! You don't love me! You don't love me!"</p>

<p>And then, more gently:</p>

<p>"Why do you cry? You know it gives me pain to see you
cry!"</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>Each silence gave us fresh hope. We said to ourselves:</p>

<p>"Perhaps he has left Christine behind the wall. And we
thought only of the possibility of warning. Christine Daaé of our
presence, unknown to the monster. We were unable to leave the
torture-chamber now, unless Christine opened the door to us; and
it was only on this condition that we could hope to help her, for
we did not even know where the door might be.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the silence in the next room was disturbed by the
ringing of an electric bell. There was a bound on the other side
of the wall and Erik's voice of thunder:</p>

<p>"Somebody ringing! Walk in, please!"</p>

<p>A sinister chuckle.</p>

<p>"Who has come bothering now? Wait for me here.... <i>I am
going to tell the siren to open the door</i>."</p>

<p>Steps moved away, a door closed. I had no time to think of the
fresh horror that was preparing; I forgot that the monster was
only going out perhaps to perpetrate a fresh crime; I understood
but one thing: Christine was alone behind the wall!</p>

<p>The Vicomte de Chagny was already calling to her:</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine!"</p>

<p>As we could hear what was said in the next room, there was no
reason why my companion should not be heard in his turn.
Nevertheless, the viscount had to repeat his cry time after
time.</p>

<p>At last, a faint voice reached us.</p>

<p>"I am dreaming!" it said.</p>

<p>"Christine, Christine, it is I, Raoul!"</p>

<p>A silence.</p>

<p>"But answer me, Christine!... In Heaven's name, if you are
alone, answer me!"</p>

<p>Then Christine's voice whispered Raoul's name.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! It is I! It is not a dream!... Christine, trust
me!... We are here to save you... but be prudent! When you hear
the monster, warn us!"</p>

<p>Then Christine gave way to fear. She trembled lest Erik should
discover where Raoul was hidden; she told us in a few hurried
words that Erik had gone quite mad with love and that he had
decided <i>to kill everybody and himself with everybody</i> if
she did not consent to become his wife. He had given her till
eleven o'clock the next evening for reflection. It was the last
respite. She must choose, as he said, between the wedding mass
and the requiem.</p>

<p>And Erik had then uttered a phrase which Christine did not
quite understand:</p>

<p>"Yes or no! If your answer is no, everybody will be dead
<i>and buried!</i>"</p>

<p>But I understood the sentence perfectly, for it corresponded
in a terrible manner with my own dreadful thought.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us where Erik is?" I asked.</p>

<p>She replied that he must have left the house.</p>

<p>"Could you make sure?"</p>

<p>"No. I am fastened. I can not stir a limb."</p>

<p>When we heard this, M. de Chagny and I gave a yell of fury.
Our safety, the safety of all three of us, depended on the girl's
liberty of movement.</p>

<p>"But where are you?" asked Christine. "There are only two
doors in my room, the Louis-Philippe room of which I told you,
Raoul; a door through which Erik comes and goes, and another
which he has never opened before me and which he has forbidden me
ever to go through, because he says it is the most dangerous of
the doors, the door of the torture-chamber!"</p>

<p>"Christine, that is where we are!"</p>

<p>"You are in the torture-chamber?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we can not see the door."</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could only drag myself so far! I would knock at the
door and that would tell you where it is."</p>

<p>"Is it a door with a lock to it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, with a lock."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I said, "it is absolutely necessary that you
should open that door to us!"</p>

<p>"But how?" asked the poor girl tearfully.</p>

<p>We heard her straining, trying to free herself from the bonds
that held her.</p>

<p>"I know where the key is," she said, in a voice that seemed
exhausted by the effort she had made. "But I am fastened so
tight.... Oh, the wretch!"</p>

<p>And she gave a sob.</p>

<p>"Where is the key?" I asked, signing to M. de Chagny not to
speak and to leave the business to me, for we had not a moment to
lose.</p>

<p>"In the next room, near the organ, with another little bronze
key, which he also forbade me to touch. They are both in a little
leather bag which he calls the bag of life and death..... Raoul!
Raoul! Fly! Everything is mysterious and terrible here, and Erik
will soon have gone quite mad, and you are in the
torture-chamber! Go back by the way you came. There must be a
reason why the room is called by that name!"</p>

<p>"Christine," said the young man, "we will go from here
together or die together!"</p>

<p>"We must keep cool," I whispered. "Why has he fastened you,
mademoiselle? You can't escape from his house; and he knows
it!"</p>

<p>"I tried to commit suicide! The monster went out last night,
after carrying me here fainting and half chloroformed. He was
going <i>to his banker</i>, so he said!... When he returned he
found me with my face covered with blood.... I had tried to kill
myself by striking my forehead against the walls."</p>

<p>"Christine!" groaned Raoul; and he began to sob.</p>

<p>"Then he bound me... I am not allowed to die until eleven
o'clock to-morrow evening."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," I declared, "the monster bound you... and he
shall unbind you. You have only to play the necessary part!
Remember that he loves you!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" we heard. "Am I likely to forget it!"</p>

<p>"Remember it and smile to him... entreat him... tell him that
your bonds hurt you."</p>

<p>But Christine Daaé said:</p>

<p>"Hush!... I hear something in the wall on the lake!... It is
he!... Go away! Go away! Go away!"</p>

<p>"We could not go away, even if we wanted to," I said, as
impressively as I could. "We can not leave this! And we are in
the torture-chamber!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Christine again.</p>

<p>Heavy steps sounded slowly behind the wall, then stopped and
made the floor creak once more. Next came a tremendous sigh,
followed by a cry of horror from Christine, and we heard Erik's
voice:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for letting you see a face like this! What
a state I am in, am I not? It's <i>the other one's fault</i>! Why
did he ring? Do <i>I</i> ask people who pass to tell me the time?
He will never ask anybody the time again! It is the siren's
fault."</p>

<p>Another sigh, deeper, more tremendous still, came from the
abysmal depths of a soul.</p>

<p>"Why did you cry out, Christine?"</p>

<p>"Because I am in pain, Erik."</p>

<p>"I thought I had frightened you."</p>

<p>"Erik, unloose my bonds.... Am I not your prisoner?"</p>

<p>"You will try to kill yourself again."</p>

<p>"You have given me till eleven o'clock to-morrow evening,
Erik."</p>

<p>The footsteps dragged along the floor again.</p>

<p>"After all, as we are to die together, and I am just as eager
as you... yes, I have had enough of this life, you know.... Wait,
don't move, I will release you.... You have only one word to say:
<i>'No!'</i> And it will at once be over <i>with
everybody</i>!... You are right, you are right; why wait till
eleven o'clock to-morrow evening? True, it would have been
grander, finer.... But that is childish nonsense.... We should
only think of ourselves in this life, of our own death.... the
rest doesn't matter.... <i>You're looking at me because I am all
wet?</i>....Oh, my dear, it's raining cats and dogs outside!...
Apart from that, Christine, I think I am subject to
hallucinations.... You know, the man who rang at the siren's door
just now&mdash;go and look if he's ringing at the bottom of the
lake-well; he was rather like.... There, turn round... are you
glad? You're free now.... Oh, my poor Christine, look at your
wrists: tell me, have I hurt them?... That alone deserves
death.... Talking of death,  <i>I must sing his requiem!</i>"</p>

<p class="caption">"Talking of death, I must sing...."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Hearing these terrible remarks, I received an awful
presentiment... I too had once rung at the monster's door....
and, without knowing it, must have set some warning current in
motion.... And I remembered the two arms that had emerged from
the inky waters.... What poor wretch had strayed to that shore
this time? Who was 'the other one,' the one whose requiem we now
heard sung?</p>

<p>Erik sang like the god of thunder, sang a <i>Dies Irae</i>
that enveloped us as in a storm. The elements seemed to rage
around us. Suddenly, the organ and the voice ceased so suddenly
that M. de Chagny sprang back, on the other side of the wall,
with emotion. And the voice, changed and transformed, distinctly
grated out these metallic syllables:</p>

<p><i>"What have you done with my bag?"</i></p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE TORTURES BEGIN</h3>

<h3><i>The Persian's Narrative Continued</i></h3>

<p class="first">
THE voice repeated angrily: "What have you done with my bag?
So it was to take my bag that you asked me to release you!"</p>

<p>We heard hurried steps, Christine running back to the
Louis-Philippe room, as though to seek shelter on the other side
of our wall.</p>

<p>"What are you running away for?" asked the furious voice,
which had followed her. "Give me back my bag, will you? Don't you
know that it is the bag of life and death?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Erik," sighed the girl. "As it is settled that
we are to live together... what difference can it make to
you?"</p>

<p>"You know there are only two keys in it," said the monster.
"What do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"I want to look at this room which I have never seen and which
you have always kept from me.... It's woman's curiosity!" she
said, in a tone which she tried to render playful.</p>

<p>But the trick was too childish for Erik to be taken in by
it.</p>

<p>"I don't like curious women," he retorted, "and you had better
remember the story of <i>Blue-Beard</i>, and be careful.... Come,
give me back my bag!... Give me back my bag!... Leave the key
alone, will you, you inquisitive little thing?"</p>

<p>And he chuckled, while Christine gave a cry of pain. Erik had
evidently recovered the bag from her.</p>

<p>At that moment, the viscount could not help uttering an
exclamation of impotent rage.</p>

<p>"Why, what's that?" said the monster. "Did you hear,
Christine?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the poor girl. "I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a cry."</p>

<p>"A cry! Are you going mad, Erik? Whom do you expect to give a
cry, in this house?... I cried out, because you hurt me! I heard
nothing."</p>

<p>"I don't like the way you said that!... You're trembling....
You're quite excited.... You're lying!... That was a cry, there
was a cry!... There is some one in the torture-chamber!... Ah, I
understand now!"</p>

<p>"There is no one there, Erik!"</p>

<p>"I understand!"</p>

<p>"No one!"</p>

<p>"The man you want to marry, perhaps!"</p>

<p>"I don't want to marry anybody, you know I don't."</p>

<p>Another nasty chuckle.</p>

<p>"Well, it won't take long to find out. Christine, my love, we
need not open the door to see what is happening in the
torture-chamber. Would you like to see? Would you like to see?
Look here! If there is some one, if there is really some one
there, you will see the invisible window light up at the top,
near the ceiling. We need only draw the black curtain and put out
the light in here. There, that's it.... Let's put out the light!
You're not afraid of the dark, when you're with your little
husband!"</p>

<p>Then we heard Christine's voice of anguish:</p>

<p>"No!... I'm frightened!... I tell you, I'm afraid of the
dark!... I don't care about that room now.... You're always
frightening me, like a child, with your torture-chamber!... And
so I became inquisitive.... But I don't care about it now... not
a bit... not a bit!"</p>

<p>And that which I feared above all things began,
<i>automatically</i>. We were suddenly flooded with light! Yes,
on our side of the wall, everything seemed aglow. The Vicomte de
Chagny was so much taken aback that he staggered. And the angry
voice roared:</p>

<p>"I told you there was some one! Do you see the window now? The
lighted window, right up there? The man behind the wall can't see
it! But you shall go up the folding steps: that is what they are
there for!... You have often asked me to tell you; and now you
know!... They are there to give a peep into the
torture-chamber... you inquisitive little thing!"</p>

<p>"What tortures?.... Who is being tortured?... Erik, Erik, say
you are only trying to frighten me!... Say it, if you love me,
Erik!... There are no tortures, are there?"</p>

<p>"Go and look at the little window, dear!"</p>

<p>I do not know if the viscount heard the girl's swooning voice,
for he was too much occupied by the astounding spectacle that now
appeared before his distracted gaze. As for me, I had seen that
sight too often, through the little window, at the time of the
rosy hours of Mazenderan; and I cared only for what was being
said next door, seeking for a hint how to act, what resolution to
take.</p>

<p>"Go and peep through the little window! Tell me what he looks
like!"</p>

<p>We heard the steps being dragged against the wall.</p>

<p>"Up with you!... No!... No, I will go up myself, dear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, I will go up. Let me go!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling!... How sweet of you!... How nice
of you to save me the exertion at my age!... Tell me what he
looks like!"</p>

<p>At that moment, we distinctly heard these words above our
heads:</p>

<p>"There is no one there, dear!"</p>

<p>"No one?... Are you sure there is no one?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not... no one!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right!... What's the matter, Christine?
You're not going to faint, are you... as there is no one
there?... Here... come down... there!... Pull yourself
together... as there is no one there!... <i>But how do you like
the landscape?</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, very much!"</p>

<p>"There, that's better!... You're better now, are you not?...
That's all right, you're better!... No excitement!... And what a
funny house, isn't it, with landscapes like that in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's like the Musée Grevin.... But, I say, Erik... there
are no tortures in there!... What a fright you gave me!"</p>

<p>"Why... as there is no one there?"</p>

<p>"Did you design that room? It's very handsome. You're a great
artist, Erik."</p>

<p>"Yes, a great artist, in my own line."</p>

<p>"But tell me, Erik, why did you call that room the
torture-chamber?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's very simple. First of all, what did you see?"</p>

<p>"I saw a forest."</p>

<p>"And what is in a forest?"</p>

<p>"Trees."</p>

<p>"And what is in a tree?"</p>

<p>"Birds."</p>

<p>"Did you see any birds?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not see any birds."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you see? Think! You saw branches! And what are
the branches?" asked the terrible voice. "<i>There's a
gibbet!</i> That is why I call my wood the torture-chamber!...
You see, it's all a joke. I never express myself like other
people. But I am very tired of it!... I'm sick and tired of
having a forest and a torture-chamber in my house and of living
like a mountebank, in a house with a false bottom!... I'm tired
of it! I want to have a nice, quiet fiat, with ordinary doors and
windows and a wife inside it, like anybody else! A wife whom I
could love and take out on Sundays and keep amused on
week-days.... Here, shall I show you some card-tricks? That will
help us to pass a few minutes, while waiting for eleven o'clock
to-morrow evening.... My dear little Christine!... Are you
listening to me?.... Tell me you love me!... No, you don't love
me... but no matter, you will!... Once, you could not look at my
mask because you knew what was behind. And now you don't mind
looking at it and you forget what is behind!... One can get used
to everything... if one wishes.... Plenty of young people who did
not care for each other before marriage have adored each other
since! Oh, I don't know what I am talking about! But you would
have lots of fun with me. For instance, I am the greatest
ventriloquist that ever lived, I am the first ventriloquist in
the world!... You're laughing.... Perhaps you don't believe me?
Listen."</p>

<p>The wretch, who really was the first ventriloquist in the
world, was only trying to divert the child's attention from the
torture-chamber; but it was a stupid scheme, for Christine
thought of nothing but us! She repeatedly besought him, in the
gentlest tones which she could assume:</p>

<p>"Put out the light in the little window! Erik, do put out the
light in the little window!"</p>

<p>For she saw that this light, which appeared so suddenly and of
which the monster had spoken in so threatening a voice, must mean
something terrible. One thing must have pacified her for a
moment; and that was seeing the two of us, behind the wall, in
the midst of that resplendent light, alive and well. But she
would certainly have felt much easier if the light had been put
out.</p>

<p>Meantime, the other had already begun to play the
ventriloquist. He said:</p>

<p>"Here, I raise my mask a little.... Oh, only a little!... You
see my lips, such lips as I have? They're not moving!... My mouth
is closed&mdash;such mouth as I have&mdash;and yet you hear my
voice.... Where will you have it? In your left ear? In your right
ear? In the table? In those little ebony boxes on the
mantelpiece?... Listen, dear, it's in the little box on the right
of the mantelpiece: what does it say? <i>'Shall I turn the
scorpion?</i>... And now, crack! What does it say in the little
box on the left? <i>'Shall I turn the grasshopper?</i>... And
now, crack! Here it is in the little leather bag.... What does it
say? <i>'I am the little hag of life and death!'</i>.... And now,
crack! It is in Carlotta's throat, in Carlotta's golden throat,
in Carlotta's crystal throat, as I live! What does it say? It
says, 'It's I, Mr. Toad, it's I singing! '<i>I feel without
alarm&mdash;co-ack&mdash;with its melody enwind me&mdash;
co-ack!'</i>... And now, crack! It is on a chair in the ghost's
box and it says, <i>'Madame Carlotta is singing to-night to bring
the chandelier down!'</i>... And now, crack! Aha! Where is Erik's
voice now? Listen, Christine, darling! Listen! It is behind the
door of the torture-chamber! Listen! It's myself in the
torture-chamber! And what do I say? I say, 'Woe to them that have
a nose, a real nose, and come to look round the torture-chamber!
Aha, aha, aha!"</p>

<p>Oh, the ventriloquist's terrible voice! It was everywhere,
everywhere. It passed through the little invisible window,
through the walls. It ran around us, between us. Erik was there,
speaking to us! We made a movement as though to fling ourselves
upon him. But, already, swifter, more fleeting than the voice of
the echo, Erik's voice had leaped back behind the wall!</p>

<p>Soon we heard nothing more at all, for this is what
happened:</p>

<p>"Erik! Erik!" said Christine's voice. "You tire me with your
voice. Don't go on, Erik! Isn't it very hot here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Erik's voice, "the heat is
unendurable!"</p>

<p>"But what does this mean?... The wall is really getting quite
hot!... The wall is burning!..."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Christine, dear: it is because of the forest
next door."</p>

<p>"Well, what has that to do with it? The forest?"</p>

<p><i>"Why, didn't you see that it was an African
forest?"</i></p>

<p>And the monster laughed so loudly and hideously that we could
no longer distinguish Christine's supplicating cries! The Vicomte
de Chagny shouted and banged against the walls like a madman. I
could not restrain him. But we heard nothing except the monster's
laughter, and the monster himself can have heard nothing else.
And then there was the sound of a body falling on the floor and
being dragged along and a door slammed and then nothing, nothing
more around us save the scorching silence of the south in the
heart of a tropical forest!</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>"BARRELS!... BARRELS!... ANY BARRELS TO SELL?"</h3>

<h3><i>The Persian's Narrative Continued</i></h3>

<p class="first">
I HAVE said that the room in which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and
I were imprisoned was a regular hexagon, lined entirely with
mirrors. Plenty of these rooms have been seen since, mainly at
exhibitions: they are called "palaces of illusion," or some such
name. But the invention belongs entirely to Erik, who built the
first room of this kind under my eyes, at the time of the rosy
hours of Mazenderan. A decorative object, such as a column, for
instance, was placed in one of the corners and immediately
produced a hall of a thousand columns; for, thanks to the
mirrors, the real room was multiplied by six hexagonal rooms,
each of which, in its turn, was multiplied indefinitely. But the
little sultana soon tired of this infantile illusion, whereupon
Erik altered his invention into a "torture-chamber." For the
architectural motive placed in one corner, he substituted an iron
tree. This tree, with its painted leaves, was absolutely true to
life and was made of iron so as to resist all the attacks of the
"patient" who was locked into the torture-chamber. We shall see
how the scene thus obtained was twice altered instantaneously
into two successive other scenes, by means of the automatic
rotation of the drums or rollers in the corners. These were
divided into three sections, fitting into the angles of the
mirrors and each supporting a decorative scheme that came into
sight as the roller revolved upon its axis.</p>

<p>The walls of this strange room gave the patient nothing to lay
hold of, because, apart from the solid decorative object, they
were simply furnished with mirrors, thick enough to withstand any
onslaught of the victim, who was flung into the chamber
empty-handed and barefoot.</p>

<p>There was no furniture. The ceiling was capable of being lit
up. An ingenious system of electric heating, which has since been
imitated, allowed the temperature of the walls and room to be
increased at will.</p>

<p>I am giving all these details of a perfectly natural
invention, producing, with a few painted branches, the
supernatural illusion of an equatorial forest blazing under the
tropical sun, so that no one may doubt the present balance of my
brain or feel entitled to say that I am mad or lying or that I
take him for a fool.[*]</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is very natural that, at the time when
the Persian was writing, he should take so many precautions
against any spirit of incredulity on the part of those who were
likely to read his narrative. Nowadays, when we have all seen
this sort of room, his precautions would be superfluous.]</p>

<br>

<p>I now return to the facts where I left them. When the ceiling
lit up and the forest became visible around us, the viscount's
stupefaction was immense. That impenetrable forest, with its
innumerable trunks and branches, threw him into a terrible state
of consternation. He passed his hands over his forehead, as
though to drive away a dream; his eyes blinked; and, for a
moment, he forgot to listen.</p>

<p>I have already said that the sight of the forest did not
surprise me at all; and therefore I listened for the two of us to
what was happening next door. Lastly, my attention was especially
attracted, not so much to the scene, as to the mirrors that
produced it. These mirrors were broken in parts. Yes, they were
marked and scratched; they had been "starred," in spite of their
solidity; and this proved to me that the torture-chamber in which
we now were <i>had already served a purpose</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, some wretch, whose feet were not bare like those of the
victims of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, had certainly fallen
into this "mortal illusion" and, mad with rage, had kicked
against those mirrors which, nevertheless, continued to reflect
his agony. And the branch of the tree on which he had put an end
to his own sufferings was arranged in such a way that, before
dying, he had seen, for his last consolation, a thousand men
writhing in his company.</p>

<p>Yes, Joseph Buquet had undoubtedly been through all this! Were
we to die as he had done? I did not think so, for I knew that we
had a few hours before us and that I could employ them to better
purpose than Joseph Buquet was able to do. After all, I was
thoroughly acquainted with most of Erik's "tricks" and now or
never was the time to turn my knowledge to account.</p>

<p>To begin with, I gave up every idea of returning to the
passage that had brought us to that accursed chamber. I did not
trouble about the possibility of working the inside stone that
closed the passage; and this for the simple reason that to do so
was out of the question. We had dropped from too great a height
into the torture-chamber; there was no furniture to help us reach
that passage; not even the branch of the iron tree, not even each
other's shoulders were of any avail.</p>

<p>There was only one possible outlet, that opening into the
Louis-Philippe room in which Erik and Christine Daaé were. But,
though this outlet looked like an ordinary door on Christine's
side, it was absolutely invisible to us. We must therefore try to
open it without even knowing where it was.</p>

<p>When I was quite sure that there was no hope for us from
Christine Daaé's side, when I had heard the monster dragging the
poor girl from the Louis-Philippe room <i>lest she should
interfere with oar tortures</i>, I resolved to set to work
without delay.</p>

<p>But I had first to calm M. de Chagny, who was already walking
about like a madman, uttering incoherent cries. The snatches of
conversation which he had caught between Christine and the
monster had contributed not a little to drive him beside himself:
add to that the shock of the magic forest and the scorching heat
which was beginning to make the perspiration stream down his
temples and you will have no difficulty in understanding his
state of mind. He shouted Christine's name, brandished his
pistol, knocked his forehead against the glass in his endeavors
to run down the glades of the illusive forest. In short, the
torture was beginning to work its spell upon a brain unprepared
for it.</p>

<p>I did my best to induce the poor viscount to listen to reason.
I made him touch the mirrors and the iron tree and the branches
and explained to him, by optical laws, all the luminous imagery
by which we were surrounded and of which we need not allow
ourselves to be the victims, like ordinary, ignorant people.</p>

<p>"We are in a room, a little room; that is what you must keep
saying to yourself. And we shall leave the room as soon as we
have found the door."</p>

<p>And I promised him that, if he let me act, without disturbing
me by shouting and walking up and down, I would discover the
trick of the door in less than an hour's time.</p>

<p>Then he lay flat on the floor, as one does in a wood, and
declared that he would wait until I found the door of the forest,
as there was nothing better to do! And he added that, from where
he was, "the view was splendid!" The torture was working, in
spite of all that I had said.</p>

<p>Myself, forgetting the forest, I tackled a glass panel and
began to finger it in every direction, hunting for the weak point
on which to press in order to turn the door in accordance with
Erik's system of pivots. This weak point might be a mere speck on
the glass, no larger than a pea, under which the spring lay
hidden. I hunted and hunted. I felt as high as my hands could
reach. Erik was about the same height as myself and I thought
that he would not have placed the spring higher than suited his
stature.</p>

<p>While groping over the successive panels with the greatest
care, I endeavored not to lose a minute, for I was feeling more
and more overcome with the heat and we were literally roasting in
that blazing forest.</p>

<p>I had been working like this for half an hour and had finished
three panels, when, as ill-luck would have it, I turned round on
hearing a muttered exclamation from the viscount.</p>

<p>"I am stifling," he said. "All those mirrors are sending out
an infernal heat! Do you think you will find that spring soon? If
you are much longer about it, we shall be roasted alive!"</p>

<p>I was not sorry to hear him talk like this. He had not said a
word of the forest and I hoped that my companion's reason would
hold out some time longer against the torture. But he added:</p>

<p>"What consoles me is that the monster has given Christine
until eleven to-morrow evening. If we can't get out of here and
go to her assistance, at least we shall be dead before her! Then
Erik's mass can serve for all of us!"</p>

<p>And he gulped down a breath of hot air that nearly made him
faint.</p>

<p>As I had not the same desperate reasons as M. le Vicomte for
accepting death, I returned, after giving him a word of
encouragement, to my panel, but I had made the mistake of taking
a few steps while speaking and, in the tangle of the illusive
forest, I was no longer able to find my panel for certain! I had
to begin all over again, at random, feeling, fumbling,
groping.</p>

<p>Now the fever laid hold of me in my turn... for I found
nothing, absolutely nothing. In the next room, all was silence.
We were quite lost in the forest, without an outlet, a compass, a
guide or anything. Oh, I knew what awaited us if nobody came to
our aid.... or if I did not find the spring! But, look as I
might, I found nothing but branches, beautiful branches that
stood straight up before me, or spread gracefully over my head.
But they gave no shade. And this was natural enough, as we were
in an equatorial forest, with the sun right above our heads, an
African forest.</p>

<p>M. de Chagny and I had repeatedly taken off our coats and put
them on again, finding at one time that they made us feel still
hotter and at another that they protected us against the heat. I
was still making a moral resistance, but M. de Chagny seemed to
me quite "gone." He pretended that he had been walking in that
forest for three days and nights, without stopping, looking for
Christine Daaé! From time to time, he thought he saw her behind
the trunk of a tree, or gliding between the branches; and he
called to her with words of supplication that brought the tears
to my eyes. And then, at last:</p>

<p>"Oh, how thirsty I am!" he cried, in delirious accents.</p>

<p>I too was thirsty. My throat was on fire. And, yet, squatting
on the floor, I went on hunting, hunting, hunting for the spring
of the invisible door... especially as it was dangerous to remain
in the forest as evening drew nigh. Already the shades of night
were beginning to surround us. It had happened very quickly:
night falls quickly in tropical countries...suddenly, with hardly
any twilight.</p>

<p>Now night, in the forests of the equator, is always dangerous,
particularly when, like ourselves, one has not the materials for
a fire to keep off the beasts of prey. I did indeed try for a
moment to break off the branches, which I would have lit with my
dark lantern, but I knocked myself also against the mirrors and
remembered, in time, that we had only images of branches to do
with.</p>

<p>The heat did not go with the daylight; on the contrary, it was
now still hotter under the blue rays of the moon. I urged the
viscount to hold our weapons ready to fire and not to stray from
camp, while I went on looking for my spring.</p>

<p>Suddenly, we heard a lion roaring a few yards away.</p>

<p>"Oh," whispered the viscount, "he is quite close!... Don't you
see him?... There... through the trees... in that thicket!... If
he roars again, I will fire!..."</p>

<p>And the roaring began again, louder than before. And the
viscount fired, but I do not think that he hit the lion; only, he
smashed a mirror, as I perceived the next morning, at daybreak.
We must have covered a good distance during the night, for we
suddenly found ourselves on the edge of the desert, an immense
desert of sand, stones and rocks. It was really not worth while
leaving the forest to come upon the desert. Tired out, I flung
myself down beside the viscount, for I had had enough of looking
for springs which I could not find.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised&mdash;and I said so to the
viscount&mdash;that we had encountered no other dangerous animals
during the night. Usually, after the lion came the leopard and
sometimes the buzz of the tsetse fly. These were easily obtained
effects; and I explained to M. de Chagny that Erik imitated the
roar of a lion on a long tabour or timbrel, with an ass's skin at
one end. Over this skin he tied a string of catgut, which was
fastened at the middle to another similar string passing through
the whole length of the tabour. Erik had only to rub this string
with a glove smeared with resin and, according to the manner in
which he rubbed it, he imitated to perfection the voice of the
lion or the leopard, or even the buzzing of the tsetse fly.</p>

<p>The idea that Erik was probably in the room beside us, working
his trick, made me suddenly resolve to enter into a parley with
him, for we must obviously give up all thought of taking him by
surprise. And by this time he must be quite aware who were the
occupants of his torture-chamber. I called him: "Erik! Erik!"</p>

<p>I shouted as loudly as I could across the desert, but there
was no answer to my voice. All around us lay the silence and the
bare immensity of that stony desert. What was to become of us in
the midst of that awful solitude?</p>

<p>We were beginning literally to die of heat, hunger and
thirst... of thirst especially. At last, I saw M. de Chagny raise
himself on his elbow and point to a spot on the horizon. He had
discovered an oasis!</p>

<p>Yes, far in the distance was an oasis... an oasis with limpid
water, which reflected the iron trees!... Tush, it was the scene
of the mirage.... I recognized it at once... the worst of the
three!... No one had been able to fight against it... no one....
I did my utmost to keep my head <i>and not to hope for water</i>,
because I knew that, if a man hoped for water, the water that
reflected the iron tree, and if, after hoping for water, he
struck against the mirror, then there was only one thing for him
to do: to hang himself on the iron tree!</p>

<p>So I cried to M. de Chagny:</p>

<p>"It's the mirage!... It's the mirage!... Don't believe in the
water!... It's another trick of the mirrors!..."</p>

<p>Then he flatly told me to shut up, with my tricks of the
mirrors, my springs, my revolving doors and my palaces of
illusions! He angrily declared that I must be either blind or mad
to imagine that all that water flowing over there, among those
splendid, numberless trees, was not real water!... And the desert
was real!... And so was the forest!... And it was no use trying
to take him in... he was an old, experienced traveler... he had
been all over the place!</p>

<p>And he dragged himself along, saying: "Water! Water!"</p>

<p>And his mouth was open, as though he were drinking.</p>

<p>And my mouth was open too, as though I were drinking.</p>

<p>For we not only saw the water, but <i>we heard it!</i>... We
heard it flow, we heard it ripple!... Do you understand that word
"ripple"?... <i>It is a sound which you hear with your
tongue!</i>... You put your tongue out of your mouth to listen to
it better!</p>

<p>Lastly&mdash;and this was the most pitiless torture of
all&mdash;we heard the rain and it was not raining! This was an
infernal invention.... Oh, I knew well enough how Erik obtained
it! He filled with little stones a very long and narrow box,
broken up inside with wooden and metal projections. The stones,
in falling, struck against these projections and rebounded from
one to another; and the result was a series of pattering sounds
that exactly imitated a rainstorm.</p>

<p>Ah, you should have seen us putting out our tongues and
dragging ourselves toward the rippling river-bank! Our eyes and
ears were full of water, but our tongues were hard and dry as
horn!</p>

<p>When we reached the mirror, M. de Chagny licked it... and I
also licked the glass.</p>

<p>It was burning hot!</p>

<p>Then we rolled on the floor with a hoarse cry of despair. M.
de Chagny put the one pistol that was still loaded to his temple;
and I stared at the Punjab lasso at the foot of the iron tree. I
knew why the iron tree had returned, in this third change of
scene!... The iron tree was waiting for me!...</p>

<p>But, as I stared at the Punjab lasso, I saw a thing that made
me start so violently that M. de Chagny delayed his attempt at
suicide. I took his arm. And then I caught the pistol from him...
and then I dragged myself on my knees toward what I had seen.</p>

<p>I had discovered, near the Punjab lasso, in a groove in the
floor, a black-headed nail of which I knew the use. At last I had
discovered the spring! I felt the nail.... I lifted a radiant
face to M. de Chagny..... The black-headed nail yielded to my
pressure....</p>

<p>And then....</p>

<p>And then we saw not a door opened in the wall, but a
cellar-flap released in the floor. Cool air came up to us from
the black hole below. We stooped over that square of darkness as
though over a limpid well. With our chins in the cool shade, we
drank it in.</p>

<p>And we bent lower and lower over the trap-door.</p>

<p>What could there be in that cellar which opened before us?
Water? Water to drink?</p>

<p>I thrust my arm into the darkness and came upon a stone and
another stone... a staircase... a dark staircase leading into the
cellar. The viscount wanted to fling himself down the hole; but
I, fearing a new trick of the monster's, stopped him, turned on
my dark lantern and went down first.</p>

<p>The staircase was a winding one and led down into pitchy
darkness. But oh, how deliciously cool were the darkness and the
stairs? The lake could not be far away.</p>

<p>We soon reached the bottom. Our eyes were beginning to
accustom themselves to the dark, to distinguish shapes around
us... circular shapes... on which I turned the light of my
lantern.</p>

<p>Barrels!</p>

<p>We were in Erik's cellar: it was here that he must keep his
wine and perhaps his drinking-water. I knew that Erik was a great
lover of good wine. Ah, there was plenty to drink here!</p>

<p>M. de Chagny patted the round shapes and kept on saying:</p>

<p>"Barrels! Barrels!... What a lot of barrels!..."</p>

<p>Indeed, there was quite a number of them, symmetrically
arranged in two rows, one on either side of us. They were small
barrels and I thought that Erik must have selected them of that
size to facilitate their carriage to the house on the lake.</p>

<p>We examined them successively, to see if one of them had not a
funnel, showing that it had been tapped at some time or another.
But all the barrels were hermetically closed.</p>

<p>Then, after half lifting one to make sure it was full, we went
on our knees and, with the blade of a small knife which I
carried, I prepared to stave in the bung-hole.</p>

<p>At that moment, I seemed to hear, coming from very far, a sort
of monotonous chant which I knew well, from often hearing it in
the streets of Paris:</p>

<p>"Barrels!... Barrels!... Any barrels to sell?..."</p>

<p>My hand desisted from its work. M. de Chagny had also heard.
He said:</p>

<p>"That's funny! It sounds as if the barrel were singing!"</p>

<p>The song was renewed, farther away: "Barrels!... Barrels!...
Any barrels to sell?..."</p>

<p>"Oh, I swear," said the viscount, "that the tune dies away in
the barrel!..."</p>

<p>We stood up and went to look behind the barrel.</p>

<p>"It's inside," said M. de Chagny, "it's inside!"</p>

<p>But we heard nothing there and were driven to accuse the bad
condition of our senses. And we returned to the bung-hole. M. de
Chagny put his two hands together underneath it and, with a last
effort, I burst the bung.</p>

<p>"What's this?" cried the viscount. "This isn't water!"</p>

<p>The viscount put his two full hands close to my lantern... I
stooped to look... and at once threw away the lantern with such
violence that it broke and went out, leaving us in utter
darkness.</p>

<p>What I had seen in M. de Chagny's hands... was gun-powder!</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>THE SCORPION OR THE GRASSHOPPER: WHICH?</h3>

<h3><i>The Persian's Narrative Concluded</i></h3>

<p class="first">
THE discovery flung us into a state of alarm that made us
forget all our past and present sufferings. We now knew all that
the monster meant to convey when he said to Christine Daaé:</p>

<p>"Yes or no! If your answer is no, everybody will be dead
<i>and buried!</i>"</p>

<p>Yes, buried under the ruins of the Paris Grand Opera!</p>

<p>The monster had given her until eleven o'clock in the evening.
He had chosen his time well. There would be many people, many
"members of the human race," up there, in the resplendent
theater. What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral? He
would go down to the tomb escorted by the whitest shoulders in
the world, decked with the richest jewels.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!</p>

<p>We were all to be blown up in the middle of the performance...
if Christine Daaé said no!</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!...</p>

<p>And what else could Christine say but no? Would she not prefer
to espouse death itself rather than that living corpse? She did
not know that on her acceptance or refusal depended the awful
fate of many members of the human race!</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!</p>

<p>And we dragged ourselves through the darkness, feeling our way
to the stone steps, for the light in the trap-door overhead that
led to the room of mirrors was now extinguished; and we repeated
to ourselves:</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!"</p>

<p>At last, I found the staircase. But, suddenly I drew myself up
on the first step, for a terrible thought had come to my
mind:</p>

<p>"What is the time?"</p>

<p>Ah, what was the time?... For, after all, eleven o'clock
to-morrow evening might be now, might be this very moment! Who
could tell us the time? We seemed to have been imprisoned in that
hell for days and days... for years... since the beginning of
the world. Perhaps we should be blown up then and there! Ah, a
sound! A crack!</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?... There, in the corner... good heavens!
Like a sound of machinery!... Again!... Oh, for a light!...
Perhaps it's the machinery that is to blow everything up!... I
tell you, a cracking sound: are you deaf?"</p>

<p>M. de Chagny and I began to yell like madmen. Fear spurred us
on. We rushed up the treads of the staircase, stumbling as we
went, anything to escape the dark, to return to the mortal light
of the room of mirrors!</p>

<p>We found the trap-door still open, but it was now as dark in
the room of mirrors as in the cellar which we had left. We
dragged ourselves along the floor of the torture-chamber, the
floor that separated us from the powder-magazine. What was the
time? We shouted, we called: M. de Chagny to Christine, I to
Erik. I reminded him that I had saved his life. But no answer,
save that of our despair, of our madness: what was the time? We
argued, we tried to calculate the time which we had spent there,
but we were incapable of reasoning. If only we could see the face
of a watch!... Mine had stopped, but M. de Chagny's was still
going.... He told me that he had wound it up before dressing for
the Opera.... We had not a match upon us.... And yet we must
know.... M. de Chagny broke the glass of his watch and felt the
two hands.... He questioned the hands of the watch with his
finger-tips, going by the position of the ring of the watch....
Judging by the space between the hands, he thought it might be
just eleven o'clock!</p>

<p>But perhaps it was not the eleven o'clock of which we stood in
dread. Perhaps we had still twelve hours before us!</p>

<p>Suddenly, I exclaimed: "Hush!"</p>

<p>I seemed to hear footsteps in the next room. Some one tapped
against the wall. Christine Daaé's voice said:</p>

<p>"Raoul! Raoul!"</p>

<p>We were now all talking at once, on either side of the wall.
Christine sobbed; she was not sure that she would find M. de
Chagny alive. The monster had been terrible, it seemed, had done
nothing but rave, waiting for her to give him the "yes" which she
refused. And yet she had promised him that "yes," if he would
take her to the torture-chamber. But he had obstinately declined,
and had uttered hideous threats against all the members of the
human race! At last, after hours and hours of that hell, he had
that moment gone out, leaving her alone to reflect for the last
time.</p>

<p>"Hours and hours? What is the time now? What is the time,
Christine?"</p>

<p>"It is eleven o'clock! Eleven o'clock, all but five
minutes!"</p>

<p>"But which eleven o'clock?"</p>

<p>"The eleven o'clock that is to decide life or death!
He told me so just before he went.... He is terrible.... He is
quite mad: he tore off his mask and his yellow eyes shot
flames!... He did nothing but laugh!... He said, 'I give you five
minutes to spare your blushes! Here,' he said, taking a key from
the little bag of life and death, 'here is the little bronze key
that opens the two ebony caskets on the mantelpiece in the
Louis-Philippe room.... In one of the caskets, you will find a
scorpion, in the other, a grasshopper, both very cleverly
imitated in Japanese bronze: they will say yes or no for you. If
you turn the scorpion round, that will mean to me, when I return,
that you have said yes. The grasshopper will mean no.' And he
laughed like a drunken demon. I did nothing but beg and entreat
him to give me the key of the torture-chamber, promising to be
his wife if he granted me that request.... But he told me that
there was no future need for that key and that he was going to
throw it into the lake!... And he again laughed like a drunken
demon and left me. Oh, his last words were, 'The grasshopper! Be
careful of the grasshopper! A grasshopper does not only turn: it
hops! It hops! And it hops jolly high!'"</p>

<p>The five minutes had nearly elapsed and the scorpion and the
grasshopper were scratching at my brain. Nevertheless, I had
sufficient lucidity left to understand that, if the grasshopper
were turned, it would hop.... and with it many members of the
human race! There was no doubt but that the grasshopper
controlled an electric current intended to blow up the
powder-magazine!</p>

<p>M. de Chagny, who seemed to have recovered all his moral force
from hearing Christine's voice, explained to her, in a few
hurried words, the situation in which we and all the Opera were.
He told her to turn the scorpion at once.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>"Christine," I cried, "where are you?"</p>

<p>"By the scorpion."</p>

<p>"Don't touch it!"</p>

<p>The idea had come to me&mdash;for I knew my Erik&mdash;that
the monster had perhaps deceived the girl once more. Perhaps it
was the scorpion that would blow everything up. After all, why
wasn't he there? The five minutes were long past.... and he was
not back.... Perhaps he had taken shelter and was waiting for the
explosion!... Why had he not returned?.... He could not really
expect Christine ever to consent to become his voluntary prey!...
Why had he not returned?</p>

<p>"Don't touch the scorpion!" I said.</p>

<p>"Here he comes!" cried Christine. "I hear him! Here he
is!"</p>

<p>We heard his steps approaching the Louis-Philippe room. He
came up to Christine, but did not speak.</p>

<p>Then I raised my voice:</p>

<p>"Erik! It is I! Do you know me?"</p>

<p>With extraordinary calmness, he at once replied:</p>

<p>"So you are not dead in there? Well, then, see that you keep
quiet."</p>

<p>I tried to speak, but he said coldly:</p>

<p>"Not a word, daroga, or I shall blow everything up." And he
added, "The honor rests with mademoiselle.... Mademoiselle has
not touched the scorpion"&mdash;how deliberately he
spoke!&mdash;"mademoiselle has not touched the
grasshopper"&mdash;with that composure!&mdash;"but it is not too
late to do the right thing. There, I open the caskets without a
key, for I am a trap-door lover and I open and shut what I please
and as I please. I open the little ebony caskets: mademoiselle,
look at the little dears inside. Aren't they pretty? If you turn
the grasshopper, mademoiselle, we shall all be blown up. There is
enough gun-powder under our feet to blow up a whole quarter of
Paris. If you turn the scorpion, mademoiselle, all that powder
will be soaked and drowned. Mademoiselle, to celebrate our
wedding, you shall make a very handsome present to a few hundred
Parisians who are at this moment applauding a poor masterpiece of
Meyerbeer's... you shall make them a present of their lives....
For, with your own fair hands, you shall turn the scorpion....
And merrily, merrily, we will be married!"</p>

<p>A pause; and then:</p>

<p>"If, in two minutes, mademoiselle, you have not turned the
scorpion, I shall turn the grasshopper... and the grasshopper, I
tell you, <i>hops jolly high!</i>"</p>

<p>The terrible silence began anew. The Vicomte de Chagny,
realizing that there was nothing left to do but pray, went down
on his knees and prayed. As for me, my blood beat so fiercely
that I had to take my heart in both hands, lest it should burst.
At last, we heard Erik's voice:</p>

<p>"The two minutes are past.... Good-by, mademoiselle.... Hop,
grasshopper!..."</p>

<p>"Erik," cried Christine, "do you swear to me, monster, do you
swear to me that the scorpion is the one to turn?..."</p>

<p>"Yes, to hop at our wedding."</p>

<p>"Ah, you see! You said, to hop!"</p>

<p>"At our wedding, ingenuous child!... The scorpion opens the
ball.... But that will do!... You won't have the scorpion? Then I
turn the grasshopper!"</p>

<p>"Erik!"</p>

<p>"Enough!"</p>

<p>I was crying out in concert with Christine. M. de Chagny was
still on his knees, praying.</p>

<p>"Erik! I have turned the scorpion!"</p>

<p><br>
Oh, the second through which we passed!</p>

<p>Waiting! Waiting to find ourselves in fragments, amid the roar
and the ruins!</p>

<p>Feeling something crack beneath our feet, hearing an appalling
hiss through the open trap-door, a hiss like the first sound of a
rocket!</p>

<p>It came softly, at first, then louder, then very loud. But it
was not the hiss of fire. It was more like the hiss of water. And
now it became a gurgling sound: "Guggle! Guggle!"</p>

<p>We rushed to the trap-door. All our thirst, which vanished
when the terror came, now returned with the lapping of the
water.</p>

<p>The water rose in the cellar, above the barrels, the
powder-barrels&mdash;"Barrels!... Barrels! Any barrels to
sell?"&mdash;and we went down to it with parched throats. It rose
to our chins, to our mouths. And we drank. We stood on the floor
of the cellar and drank. And we went up the stairs again in the
dark, step by step, went up with the water.</p>

<p>The water came out of the cellar with us and spread over the
floor of the room. If this went on, the whole house on the lake
would be swamped. The floor of the torture-chamber had itself
become a regular little lake, in which our feet splashed. Surely
there was water enough now! Erik must turn off the tap!</p>

<p>"Erik! Erik! That is water enough for the gunpowder! Turn off
the tap! Turn off the scorpion!"</p>

<p>But Erik did not reply. We heard nothing but the water rising:
it was half-way to our waists!</p>

<p>"Christine!" cried M. de Chagny. "Christine! The water is up
to our knees!"</p>

<p>But Christine did not reply.... We heard nothing but the water
rising.</p>

<p>No one, no one in the next room, no one to turn the tap, no
one to turn the scorpion!</p>

<p>We were all alone, in the dark, with the dark water that
seized us and clasped us and froze us!</p>

<p>"Erik! Erik!"</p>

<p>"Christine! Christine!"</p>

<p>By this time, we had lost our foothold and were spinning round
in the water, carried away by an irresistible whirl, for the
water turned with us and dashed us against the dark mirror, which
thrust us back again; and our throats, raised above the
whirlpool, roared aloud.</p>

<p>Were we to die here, drowned in the torture-chamber? I had
never seen that. Erik, at the time of the rosy hours of
Mazenderan, had never shown me that, through the little invisible
window.</p>

<p>"Erik! Erik!" I cried. "I saved your life! Remember!... You
were sentenced to death! But for me, you would be dead now!...
Erik!"</p>

<p>We whirled around in the water like so much wreckage. But,
suddenly, my straying hands seized the trunk of the iron tree! I
called M. de Chagny, and we both hung to the branch of the iron
tree.</p>

<p>And the water rose still higher.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Can you remember? How much space is there between the
branch of the tree and the dome-shaped ceiling? Do try to
remember!... After all, the water may stop, it must find its
level!... There, I think it is stopping!... No, no, oh,
horrible!... Swim! Swim for your life!"</p>

<p>Our arms became entangled in the effort of swimming; we
choked; we fought in the dark water; already we could hardly
breathe the dark air above the dark water, the air which escaped,
which we could hear escaping through some vent-hole or other.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us turn and turn and turn until we find the air hole
and then glue our mouths to it!"</p>

<p>But I lost my strength; I tried to lay hold of the walls! Oh,
how those glass walls slipped from under my groping fingers!...
We whirled round again!... We began to sink!... One last
effort!... A last cry:</p>

<p>"Erik!... Christine!..."</p>

<p>"Guggle, guggle, guggle!" in our ears. "Guggle! Guggle!" At
the bottom of the dark water, our ears went, "Guggle!
Guggle!"</p>

<p>And, before losing consciousness entirely, I seemed to hear,
between two guggles:</p>

<p>"Barrels! Barrels! Any barrels to sell?"</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>THE END OF THE GHOST'S LOVE STORY</h3>

<p class="first">THE previous chapter marks the conclusion of the
written narrative which the Persian left behind him.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the horrors of a situation which seemed
definitely to abandon them to their deaths, M. de Chagny and his
companion were saved by the sublime devotion of Christine Daaé.
And I had the rest of the story from the lips of the daroga
himself.</p>

<p>When I went to see him, he was still living in his little flat
in the Rue de Rivoli, opposite the Tuileries. He was very ill,
and it required all my ardor as an historian pledged to the truth
to persuade him to live the incredible tragedy over again for my
benefit. His faithful old servant Darius showed me in to him. The
daroga received me at a window overlooking the garden of the
Tuileries. He still had his magnificent eyes, but his poor face
looked very worn. He had shaved the whole of his head, which was
usually covered with an astrakhan cap; he was dressed in a long,
plain coat and amused himself by unconsciously twisting his
thumbs inside the sleeves; but his mind was quite clear, and he
told me his story with perfect lucidity.</p>

<p>It seems that, when he opened his eyes, the daroga found
himself lying on a bed. M. de Chagny was on a sofa, beside the
wardrobe. An angel and a devil were watching over them.</p>

<p>After the deceptions and illusions of the torture-chamber, the
precision of the details of that quiet little middle-class room
seemed to have been invented for the express purpose of puzzling
the mind of the mortal rash enough to stray into that abode of
living nightmare. The wooden bedstead, the waxed mahogany chairs,
the chest of drawers, those brasses, the little square
antimacassars carefully placed on the backs of the chairs, the
clock on the mantelpiece and the harmless-looking ebony caskets
at either end, lastly, the whatnot filled with shells, with red
pincushions, with mother-of-pearl boats and an enormous
ostrich-egg, the whole discreetly lighted by a shaded lamp
standing on a small round table: this collection of ugly,
peaceable, reasonable furniture, <i>at the bottom of the Opera
cellars</i>, bewildered the imagination more than all the late
fantastic happenings.</p>

<p>And the figure of the masked man seemed all the more
formidable in this old-fashioned, neat and trim little frame. It
bent down over the Persian and said, in his ear:</p>

<p>"Are you better, daroga?... You are looking at my furniture?
It is all that I have left of my poor unhappy mother."</p>

<p>Christine Daaé did not say a word: she moved about
noiselessly, like a sister of charity, who had taken a vow of
silence. She brought a cup of cordial, or of hot tea, he did
not remember which. The man in the mask took it from her
hands and gave it to the Persian. M. de Chagny was still
sleeping.</p>

<p>Erik poured a drop of rum into the daroga's cup and, pointing
to the viscount, said:</p>

<p>"He came to himself long before we knew if you were still
alive, daroga. He is quite well. He is asleep. We must not wake
him."</p>

<p>Erik left the room for a moment, and the Persian raised
himself on his elbow, looked around him and saw Christine Daaé
sitting by the fireside. He spoke to her, called her, but he was
still very weak and fell back on his pillow. Christine came to
him, laid her hand on his forehead and went away again. And the
Persian remembered that, as she went, she did not give a glance
at M. de Chagny, who, it is true, was sleeping peacefully; and
she sat down again in her chair by the chimney-corner, silent as
a sister of charity who had taken a vow of silence.</p>

<p>Erik returned with some little bottles which he placed on the
mantelpiece. And, again in a whisper, so as not to wake M. de
Chagny, he said to the Persian, after sitting down and feeling
his pulse:</p>

<p>"You are now saved, both of you. And soon I shall take you up
to the surface of the earth, <i>to please my wife</i>."</p>

<p>Thereupon he rose, without any further explanation, and
disappeared once more.</p>

<p>The Persian now looked at Christine's quiet profile under the
lamp. She was reading a tiny book, with gilt edges, like a
religious book. There are editions of <i>The Imitation</i> that
look like that. The Persian still had in his ears the natural
tone in which the other had said, "to please my wife." Very
gently, he called her again; but Christine was wrapped up in her
book and did not hear him.</p>

<p>Erik returned, mixed the daroga a draft and advised him not to
speak to "his wife" again nor to any one, <i>because it might be
very dangerous to every-body's health</i>. </p>

<p>Eventually, the Persian fell asleep, like M. de Chagny, and
did not wake until he was in his own room, nursed by his faithful
Darius, who told him that, on the night before, he was found
propped against the door of his flat, where he had been brought
by a stranger, who rang the bell before going away.</p>

<p>As soon as the daroga recovered his strength and his wits, he
sent to Count Philippe's house to inquire after the viscount's
health. The answer was that the young man had not been seen and
that Count Philippe was dead. His body was found on the bank of
the Opera lake, on the Rue-Scribe side. The Persian remembered
the requiem mass which he had heard from behind the wall of the
torture-chamber, and had no doubt concerning the crime and the
criminal. Knowing Erik as he did, he easily reconstructed the
tragedy. Thinking that his brother had run away with Christine
Daaé, Philippe had dashed in pursuit of him along the Brussels
Road, where he knew that everything was prepared for the
elopement. Failing to find the pair, he hurried back to the
Opera, remembered Raoul's strange confidence about his fantastic
rival and learned that the viscount had made every effort to
enter the cellars of the theater and that he had disappeared,
leaving his hat in the prima donna's dressing-room beside an
empty pistol-case. And the count, who no longer entertained any
doubt of his brother's madness, in his turn darted into that
infernal underground maze. This was enough, in the Persian's
eyes, to explain the discovery of the Comte de Chagny's corpse on
the shore of the lake, where the siren, Erik's siren, kept
watch.</p>

<p>The Persian did not hesitate. He determined to Inform the
police. Now the case was in the hands of an examining-magistrate
called Faure, an incredulous, commonplace, superficial sort of
person, (I write as I think), with a mind utterly unprepared to
receive a confidence of this kind. M. Faure took down the
daroga's depositions and proceeded to treat him as a madman.</p>

<p>Despairing of ever obtaining a hearing, the Persian sat down
to write. As the police did not want his evidence, perhaps the
press would be glad of it; and he had just written the last line
of the narrative I have quoted in the preceding chapters, when
Darius announced the visit of a stranger who refused his name,
who would not show his face and declared simply that he did not
intend to leave the place until he had spoken to the daroga.</p>

<p>The Persian at once felt who his singular visitor was and
ordered him to be shown in. The daroga was right. It was the
ghost, it was Erik!</p>

<p>He looked extremely weak and leaned against the wall, as
though he were afraid of falling. Taking off his hat, he revealed
a forehead white as wax. The rest of the horrible face was hidden
by the mask.</p>

<p>The Persian rose to his feet as Erik entered.</p>

<p>"Murderer of Count Philippe, what have you done with his
brother and Christine Daaé?"</p>

<p>Erik staggered under this direct attack, kept silent for a
moment, dragged himself to a chair and heaved a deep sigh. Then,
speaking in short phrases and gasping for breath between the
words:</p>

<p>"Daroga, don't talk to me... about Count Philippe.... He was
dead... by the time... I left my house... he was dead... when...
the siren sang. It was an accident... a sad... a very sad...
accident. He fell very awkwardly... but simply and naturally...
into the lake!..."</p>

<p>"You lie!" shouted the Persian.</p>

<p>Erik bowed his head and said:</p>

<p>"I have not come here... to talk about Count Philippe... but
to tell you that... I am going... to die...."</p>

<p>"Where are Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daaé?"</p>

<p>"I am going to die...."</p>

<p>"Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daaé?"</p>

<p>"Of love... daroga... I am dying of love.... That is how it
is.... I loved her so!... And I love her still... daroga... and I
am dying of love for her, I... I tell you!... If you knew how
beautiful she was... when she let me kiss her... alive.... It was
the first... time, daroga, the first . time I ever kissed a
woman.... Yes, alive.... I kissed her alive... and she looked as
beautiful as if she had been dead!"</p>

<p>The Persian shook Erik by the arm:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me if she is alive or dead."</p>

<p>"Why do you shake me like that?" asked Erik, making an effort
to speak more connectedly. "I tell you that I am going to die....
Yes, I kissed her alive...."</p>

<p>"And now she is dead?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I kissed her just like that, on her forehead...
and she did not draw back her forehead from my lips!... Oh, she
is a good girl!... As to her being dead, I don't think so; but it
has nothing to do with me.... No, no, she is not dead! And no one
shall touch a hair of her head! She is a good, honest girl, and
she saved your life, daroga, at a moment when I would not have
given twopence for your Persian skin. As a matter of fact, nobody
bothered about you. Why were you there with that little chap? You
would have died as well as he! My word, how she entreated me for
her little chap! But I told her that, as she had turned the
scorpion, she had, through that very fact, and of her own free
will, become engaged to me and that she did not need to have two
men engaged to her, which was true enough.</p>

<p>"As for you, you did not exist, you had ceased to exist, I
tell you, and you were going to die with the other!... Only, mark
me, daroga, when you were yelling like the devil, because of the
water, Christine came to me with her beautiful blue eyes wide
open, and swore to me, as she hoped to be saved, that she
consented to be <i>my living wife</i>!... Until then, in the
depths of her eyes, daroga, I had always seen my dead wife; it
was the first time I saw <i>my living wife</i> there. She was
sincere, as she hoped to be saved. She would not kill herself. It
was a bargain.... Half a minute later, all the
water was back in the lake; and I had a hard job with you,
daroga, for, upon my honor, I thought you were done for!...
However! There you were!... It was understood that I was to take
you both up to the surface of the earth. When, at last, I cleared
the Louis-Philippe room of you, I came back alone...."</p>

<p>"What have you done with the Vicomte de Chagny?" asked the
Persian, interrupting him.</p>

<p>"Ah, you see, daroga, I couldn't carry <i>him</i> up like
that, at once.... He was a hostage.... But I could not keep him
in the house on the lake either, because of Christine; so I
locked him up comfortably, I chained him up nicely&mdash;a whiff
of the Mazenderan scent had left him as limp as a rag&mdash;in
the Communists' dungeon, which is in the most deserted and remote
part of the Opera, below the fifth cellar, where no one ever
comes, and where no one ever hears you. Then I came back to
Christine. She was waiting for me..."</p>

<p>Erik here rose solemnly. Then he continued, but, as he spoke,
he was overcome by all his former emotion and began to tremble
like a leaf:</p>

<p>"Yes, she was waiting for me... waiting for me erect and
alive, a real, living bride, as she hoped to be saved.... And,
when I came forward, more timid than a little child, she did not
run away... no, no... she stayed...she waited for me.... I even
believe... daroga... that she put out her forehead... a little...
oh, not much... just a little... like a living bride... And...
and I kissed her!... I!... I!... I!... And she did not die!...
Oh, how good it is, daroga, to kiss somebody on the forehead! You
can't tell! ....But I! I!... My mother, daroga, my poor, unhappy
mother would never... let me kiss her.... She used to run away...
and throw me my mask!... Nor any other woman... ever, ever!...
Ah, you can understand, my happiness was so great, I cried. And I
fell at her feet, crying... and I kissed her feet... her little
feet... crying. You're crying, too, daroga... and she cried
also... the angel cried!..."</p>

<p>Erik sobbed aloud and the Persian himself could not retain his
tears in the presence of that masked man, who, with his shoulders
shaking and his hands clutched at his chest, was moaning with
pain and love by turns.</p>

<p>"Yes, daroga... I felt her tears flow on my forehead... on
mine, mine! They were soft... they were sweet! They trickled
under my mask... they mingled with my tears in my eyes... they
flowed between my lips.... Listen, daroga, listen to what I
did.... I tore off my mask so as not to lose one of her tears...
and she did not runaway!... And she did not die!... She remained
alive, weeping over me, with me. We cried together! I have tasted
all the happiness the world can offer!"</p>

<p>And Erik fell into a chair, choking for breath: "Ah, I am not
going to die yet... presently I shall... but let me cry!...
Listen, daroga... listen to this.... While I was at her feet... I
heard her say, 'Poor, unhappy Erik!'.... <i>And she took my
hand!</i> ....I had become no more, you know, than a poor dog
ready to die for her.... I mean it, daroga!... I held in my hand
a ring, a plain gold ring which I had given her... which she had
lost... and which I had found again a wedding-ring, you know....
I slipped it into her little hand and said, 'There!... Take
it!... Take it for you... and him!... It shall be my
wedding-present... a present from your poor, unhappy Erik.... I
know you love the boy... don't cry any more!"... She asked me, in
a very soft voice, what I meant.... Then I made her understand
that, where she was concerned, I was only a poor dog, ready to
die for her... but that she could marry the young man when she
pleased, because she had cried with me and mingled her tears with
mine!..."</p>

<p>Erik's emotion was so great that he had to tell the Persian
not to look at him, for he was choking and must take off his
mask. The daroga went to the window and opened it. His heart was
full of pity, but he took care to keep his eyes fixed on the
trees in the Tuileries gardens, lest he should see the monster's
face.</p>

<p>"I went and released the young man," Erik continued, "and told
him to come with me to Christine... They kissed before me in the
Louis-Philippe room... Christine had my ring... I made Christine
swear to come back, one night, when I was dead, crossing the lake
from the Rue-Scribe side, and bury me in the greatest secrecy
with the gold ring, which she was to wear until that moment... I
told her where she would find my body and what to do with it...
Then Christine kissed me, for the first time, herself, here, on
the forehead&mdash;don't look, daroga!&mdash;here, on the
forehead... on my forehead, mine&mdash;don't look,
daroga!&mdash;and they went off together. Christine had stopped
crying... I alone cried... Daroga, daroga, if Christine keeps her
promise, she will come back soon!..."</p>

<p>The Persian asked him no questions. He was quite reassured as
to the fate of Raoul Chagny and Christine Daaé; no one could have
doubted the word of the weeping Erik that night.</p>

<p>The monster resumed his mask and collected his strength to
leave the daroga. He told him that, when he felt his end to be
very near at hand, he would send him, in gratitude for the
kindness which the Persian had once shown him, that which he held
dearest in the world: all Christine Daaé's papers, which she had
written for Raoul's benefit and left with Erik, together with a
few objects belonging to her, such as a pair of gloves, a
shoe-buckle and two pocket-handkerchiefs. In reply to the
Persian's questions, Erik told him that the two young people, as
soon as they found themselves free, had resolved to go and look
for a priest in some lonely spot where they could hide their
happiness and that, with this object in view, they had started
from "the northern railway station of the world." Lastly, Erik
relied on the Persian, as soon as he received the promised relics
and papers, to inform the young couple of his death and to
advertise it in the <i>Époque</i>.</p>

<p>That was all. The Persian saw Erik to the door of his flat,
and Darius helped him down to the street.</p>

<p>A cab was waiting for him. Erik stepped in; and the Persian,
who had gone back to the window, heard him say to the driver:</p>

<p>"Go to the Opera."</p>

<p>And the cab drove off into the night.</p>

<p>The Persian had seen the poor, unfortunate Erik for the last
time. Three weeks later, the <i>Époque</i> published this
advertisement:</p>

<p class="headline">"ERIK IS DEAD."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

<p class="first">
I HAVE now told the singular, but veracious story of the Opera
ghost. As I declared on the first page of this work, it is no
longer possible to deny that Erik really lived. There are to-day
so many proofs of his existence within the reach of everybody
that we can follow Erik's actions logically through the whole
tragedy of the Chagnys.</p>

<p>There is no need to repeat here how greatly the case excited
the capital. The kidnapping of the artist, the death of the Comte
de Chagny under such exceptional conditions, the disappearance of
his brother, the drugging of the gas-man at the Opera and of his
two assistants: what tragedies, what passions, what crimes had
surrounded the idyll of Raoul and the sweet and charming
Christine!... What had become of that wonderful, mysterious
artist of whom the world was never, never to hear again?</p>

<p>She was represented as the victim of a rivalry between the two
brothers; and nobody suspected what had really happened, nobody
understood that, as Raoul and Christine had both disappeared,
both had withdrawn far from the world to enjoy a happiness which
they would not have cared to make public after the inexplicable
death of Count Philippe... They took the train one day from "the
northern railway station of the world." ... Possibly, I too shall
take the train at that station, one day, and go and seek around
thy lakes, O Norway, O silent Scandinavia, for the perhaps still
living traces of Raoul and Christine and also of Mamma Valerius,
who disappeared at the same time!</p>

<p>Possibly, some day, I shall hear the lonely echoes of the
North repeat the singing of her who knew the Angel of
Music!...</p>

<p>Long after the case was pigeonholed by the unintelligent care
of M. le Juge d'Instruction Faure, the newspapers made efforts,
at intervals, to fathom the mystery. One evening paper alone,
which knew all the gossip of the theaters, said:</p>

<p>"We recognize the touch of the Opera ghost."</p>

<p>And even that was written by way of irony.</p>

<p>The Persian alone knew the whole truth and held the main
proofs, which came to him with the pious relics promised by the
ghost. It fell to my lot to complete those proofs with the aid of
the daroga himself. Day by day, I kept him informed of the
progress of my inquiries; and he directed them. He had not been
to the Opera for years and years, but he had preserved the most
accurate recollection of the building, and there was no better
guide than he possible to help me discover its most secret
recesses. He also told me where to gather further information,
whom to ask; and he sent me to call on M. Poligny, at a moment
when the poor man was nearly drawing his last breath. I had no
idea that he was so very ill, and I shall never forget the effect
which my questions about the ghost produced upon him. He looked
at me as if I were the devil and answered only in a few
incoherent sentences, which showed, however&mdash;and that was
the main thing&mdash;the extent of the perturbation which O.G.,
in his time, had brought into that already very restless life
(for M. Poligny was what people call a man of pleasure).</p>

<p>When I came and told the Persian of the poor result of my
visit to M. Poligny, the daroga gave a faint smile and said:</p>

<p>"Poligny never knew how far that extraordinary blackguard of
an Erik humbugged him."&mdash;The Persian, by the way, spoke of
Erik sometimes as a demigod and sometimes as the lowest of the
low&mdash;"Poligny was superstitious and Erik knew it. Erik knew
most things about the public and private affairs of the Opera.
When M. Poligny heard a mysterious voice tell him, in Box Five,
of the manner in which he used to spend his time and abuse his
partner's confidence, he did not wait to hear any more. Thinking
at first that it was a voice from Heaven, he believed himself
damned; and then, when the voice began to ask for money, he saw
that he was being victimized by a shrewd blackmailer to whom
Debienne himself had fallen a prey. Both of them, already tired
of management for various reasons, went away without trying to
investigate further into the personality of that curious O. G.,
who had forced such a singular memorandum-book upon them. They
bequeathed the whole mystery to their successors and heaved a
sigh of relief when they were rid of a business that had puzzled
them without amusing them in the least."</p>

<p>I then spoke of the two successors and expressed my surprise
that, in his <i>Memoirs of a Manager</i>, M. Moncharmin should
describe the Opera ghost's behavior at such length in the first
part of the book and hardly mention it at all in the second. In
reply to this, the Persian, who knew the <i>Memoirs</i> as
thoroughly as if he had written them himself, observed that I
should find the explanation of the whole business if I would just
recollect the few lines which Moncharmin devotes to the ghost in
the second part aforesaid. I quote these lines, which are
particularly interesting because they describe the very simple
manner in which the famous incident of the twenty-thousand francs
was closed:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
"As for O.G., some of whose curious tricks I have related in
the first part of my Memoirs, I will only say that he redeemed by
one spontaneous fine action all the worry which he had caused my
dear friend and partner and, I am bound to say, myself. He felt,
no doubt, that there are limits to a joke, especially when it is
so expensive and when the commissary of police has been informed,
for, at the moment when we had made an appointment in our office
with M. Mifroid to tell him the whole story, a few days after the
disappearance of Christine Daaé, we found, on Richard's table, a
large envelope, inscribed, in red ink, <i>'With O. G.'s
compliments.'</i> It contained the large sum of money which he
had succeeded in playfully extracting, for the time being, from
the treasury. Richard was at once of the opinion that we must be
content with that and drop the business. I agreed with Richard.
All's well that ends well. What do you say, O.G.?"</p>

<p><br>
Of course, Moncharmin, especially after the money had been
restored, continued to believe that he had, for a short while,
been the butt of Richard's sense of humor, whereas Richard, on
his side, was convinced that Moncharmin had amused himself by
inventing the whole of the affair of the Opera ghost, in order to
revenge himself for a few jokes.</p>

<p>I asked the Persian to tell me by what trick the ghost had
taken twenty-thousand francs from Richard's pocket in spite of
the safety-pin. He replied that he had not gone into this little
detail, but that, if I myself cared to make an investigation on
the spot, I should certainly find the solution to the riddle in
the managers' office by remembering that Erik had not been
nicknamed the trap-door lover for nothing. I promised the Persian
to do so as soon as I had time, and I may as well tell the reader
at once that the results of my investigation were perfectly
satisfactory; and I hardly believed that I should ever discover
so many undeniable proofs of the authenticity of the feats
ascribed to the ghost.</p>

<p>The Persian's manuscript, Christine Daaé's papers, the
statements made to me by the people who used to work under MM.
Richard and Moncharmin, by little Meg herself (the worthy Madame
Giry, I am sorry to say, is no more) and by Sorelli, who is now
living in retirement at Louveciennes: all the documents relating
to the existence of the ghost, which I propose to deposit in the
archives of the Opera, have been checked and confirmed by a
number of important discoveries of which I am justly proud. I
have not been able to find the house on the lake, Erik having
blocked up all the secret entrances.[*] On the other hand, I have
discovered the secret passage of the Communists, the planking of
which is falling to pieces in parts, and also the trapdoor
through which Raoul and the Persian penetrated into the cellars
of the opera-house. In the Communists' dungeon, I noticed numbers
of initials  by the unfortunate people confined in it; and among
these were an "R" and a "C." R.C.: Raoul de Chagny. The letters
are there to this day.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Even so, I am convinced that it would be easy to reach it by
draining the lake, as I have repeatedly requested the Ministry of
Fine Arts to do. I was speaking about it to M. Dujardin-Beaumetz,
the under-secretary for fine arts, only forty-eight hours before
the publication of this book. Who knows but that the score of
<i>Don Juan Triumphant</i> might yet be discovered in the house
on the lake?]</p>

<p><br>
If the reader will visit the Opera one morning and ask leave
to stroll where he pleases, without being accompanied by a stupid
guide, let him go to Box Five and knock with his fist or stick on
the enormous column that separates this from the stage-box. He
will find that the column sounds hollow. After that, do not be
astonished by the suggestion that it was occupied by the voice of
the ghost: there is room inside the column for two men. If you
are surprised that, when the various incidents occurred, no one
turned round to look at the column, you must remember that it
presented the appearance of solid marble, and that the voice
contained in it seemed rather to come from the opposite side,
for, as we have seen, the ghost was an expert ventriloquist. The
column was elaborately carved and decorated with the sculptor's
chisel; and I do not despair of one day discovering the ornament
that could be raised or lowered at will, so as to admit of the
ghost's mysterious correspondence with Mame Giry and of his
generosity.</p>

<p>However, all these discoveries are nothing, to my mind,
compared with that which I was able to make, in the presence of
the acting-manager, in the managers' office, within a couple of
inches from the desk-chair, and which consisted of a trap-door,
the width of a board in the flooring and the length of a man's
fore-arm and no longer; a trap-door that falls back like the lid
of a box; a trap-door through which I can see a hand come and
dexterously fumble at the pocket of a swallow-tail coat.</p>

<p>That is the way the forty-thousand francs went!... And that
also is the way by which, through some trick or other, they were
returned.</p>

<p>Speaking about this to the Persian, I said:</p>

<p>"So we may take it, as the forty-thousand francs were
returned, that Erik was simply amusing himself with that
memorandum-book of his?"</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it!" he replied. "Erik wanted money.
Thinking himself without the pale of humanity, he was restrained
by no scruples and he employed his extraordinary gifts of
dexterity and imagination, which he had received by way of
compensation for his extraordinary uglinesss, to prey upon his
fellow-men. His reason for restoring the forty-thousand francs,
of his own accord, was that he no longer wanted it. He had
relinquished his marriage with Christine Daaé. He had
relinquished everything above the surface of the earth."</p>

<p>According to the Persian's account, Erik was born in a small
town not far from Rouen. He was the son of a master-mason. He ran
away at an early age from his father's house, where his ugliness
was a subject of horror and terror to his parents. For a time, he
frequented the fairs, where a showman exhibited him as the
"living corpse." He seems to have crossed the whole of Europe,
from fair to fair, and to have completed his strange education as
an artist and magician at the very fountain-head of art and
magic, among the Gipsies. A period of Erik's life remained quite
obscure. He was seen at the fair of Nijni-Novgorod, where he
displayed himself in all his hideous glory. He already sang as
nobody on this earth had ever sung before; he practised
ventriloquism and gave displays of legerdemain so extraordinary
that the caravans returning to Asia talked about it during the
whole length of their journey. In this way, his reputation
penetrated the walls of the palace at Mazenderan, where the
little sultana, the favorite of the Shah-in-Shah, was boring
herself to death. A dealer in furs, returning to Samarkand from
Nijni-Novgorod, told of the marvels which he had seen performed
in Erik's tent. The trader was summoned to the palace and the
daroga of Mazenderan was told to question him. Next the daroga
was instructed to go and find Erik. He brought him to Persia,
where for some months Erik's will was law. He was guilty of not a
few horrors, for he seemed not to know the difference between
good and evil. He took part calmly in a number of political
assassinations; and he turned his diabolical inventive powers
against the Emir of Afghanistan, who was at war with the Persian
empire. The Shah took a liking to him.</p>

<p>This was the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, of which
the daroga's narrative has given us a glimpse. Erik had very
original ideas on the subject of architecture and thought out a
palace much as a conjuror contrives a trick-casket. The Shah
ordered him to construct an edifice of this kind. Erik did so;
and the building appears to have been so ingenious that His
Majesty was able to move about in it unseen and to disappear
without a possibility of the trick's being discovered. When the
Shah-in-Shah found himself the possessor of this gem, he ordered
Erik's yellow eyes to be put out. But he reflected that, even
when blind, Erik would still be able to build so remarkable a
house for another sovereign; and also that, as long as Erik was
alive, some one would know the secret of the wonderful palace.
Erik's death was decided upon, together with that of all the
laborers who had worked under his orders. The execution of this
abominable decree devolved upon the daroga of Mazenderan. Erik
had shown him some slight services and procured him many a hearty
laugh. He saved Erik by providing him with the means of escape,
but nearly paid with his head for his generous indulgence.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the daroga, a corpse, half-eaten by the birds
of prey, was found on the shore of the Caspian Sea, and was taken
for Erik's body, because the daroga's friends had dressed the
remains in clothing that belonged to Erik. The daroga was let off
with the loss of the imperial favor, the confiscation of his
property and an order of perpetual banishment. As a member of the
Royal House, however, he continued to receive a monthly pension
of a few hundred francs from the Persian treasury; and on this he
came to live in Paris.</p>

<p>As for Erik, he went to Asia Minor and thence to
Constantinople, where he entered the Sultan's employment. In
explanation of the services which he was able to render a monarch
haunted by perpetual terrors, I need only say that it was Erik
who constructed all the famous trap-doors and secret chambers and
mysterious strong-boxes which were found at Yildiz-Kiosk after
the last Turkish revolution. He also invented those automata,
dressed like the Sultan and resembling the Sultan in all
respects,[*] which made people believe that the Commander of the
Faithful was awake at one place, when, in reality, he was asleep
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* See the interview of the special
correspondent of the <i>Matin</i>, with Mohammed-Ali Bey, on the
day after the entry of the Salonika troops into
Constantinople.]</p>

<br>

<p>Of course, he had to leave the Sultan's service for the same
reasons that made him fly from Persia: he knew too much. Then,
tired of his adventurous, formidable and monstrous life, he
longed to be some one "like everybody else." And he became a
contractor, like any ordinary contractor, building ordinary
houses with ordinary bricks. He tendered for part of the
foundations in the Opera. His estimate was accepted. When he
found himself in the cellars of the enormous playhouse, his
artistic, fantastic, wizard nature resumed the upper hand.
Besides, was he not as ugly as ever? He dreamed of creating for
his own use a dwelling unknown to the rest of the earth, where he
could hide from men's eyes for all time.</p>

<p>The reader knows and guesses the rest. It is all in keeping
with this incredible and yet veracious story. Poor, unhappy Erik!
Shall we pity him? Shall we curse him? He asked only to be "some
one," like everybody else. But he was too ugly! And he had to
hide his genius <i>or use it to play tricks with</i>, when, with
an ordinary face, he would have been one of the most
distinguished of mankind! He had a heart that could have held the
empire of the world; and, in the end, he had to content himself
with a cellar. Ah, yes, we must needs pity the Opera ghost.</p>

<p>I have prayed over his mortal remains, that God might show him
mercy notwithstanding his crimes. Yes, I am sure, quite sure that
I prayed beside his body, the other day, when they took it from
the spot where they were burying the phonographic records. It was
his skeleton. I did not recognize it by the ugliness of the head,
for all men are ugly when they have been dead as long as that,
but by the plain gold ring which he wore and which Christine Daaé
had certainly slipped on his finger, when she came to bury him in
accordance with her promise.</p>

<p>The skeleton was lying near the little well, in the place
where the Angel of Music first held Christine Daaé fainting in
his trembling arms, on the night when he carried her down to the
cellars of the opera-house.</p>

<p>And, now, what do they mean to do with that skeleton? Surely
they will not bury it in the common grave!... I say that the
place of the skeleton of the Opera ghost is in the archives of
the National Academy of Music. It is no ordinary skeleton.</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>THE PARIS OPERA HOUSE</h2>

<h3>THE SCENE OF GASTON LEROUX'S NOVEL,<BR>
"THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA"</h3>

<p class="first">
THAT Mr. Leroux has used, for the scene of his story, the
Paris Opera House as it really is and has not created a building
out of his imagination, is shown by this interesting description
of it taken from an article which appeared in <i>Scribner's
Magazine</i> in 1879, a short time after the building was
completed:</p>

<p>"The new Opera House, commenced under the Empire and finished
under the Republic, is the most complete building of the kind in
the world and in many respects the most beautiful. No European
capital possesses an opera house so comprehensive in plan and
execution, and none can boast an edifice equally vast and
splendid.</p>

<p>"The site of the Opera House was chosen in 1861. It was
determined to lay the foundation exceptionally deep and strong.
It was well known that water would be met with, but it was
impossible to foresee at what depth or in what quantity it would
be found. Exceptional depth also was necessary, as the stage
arrangements were to be such as to admit a scene fifty feet high
to be lowered on its frame. It was therefore necessary to lay a
foundation in a soil soaked with water which should be
sufficiently solid to sustain a weight of 22,000,000 pounds, and
at the same time to be perfectly dry, as the cellars were
intended for the storage of scenery and properties. While the
work was in progress, the excavation was kept free from water by
means of eight pumps, worked by steam power, and in operation,
without interruption, day and night, from March second to October
thirteenth. The floor of the cellar was covered with a layer of
concrete, then with two coats of cement, another layer of
concrete and a coat of bitumen. The wall includes an outer wall
built as a coffer-dam, a brick wall, a coat of cement, and a wall
proper, a little over a yard thick. After all this was done the
whole was filled with water, in order that the fluid, by
penetrating into the most minute interstices, might deposit a
sediment which would close them more surely and perfectly than it
would be possible to do by hand. Twelve years elapsed before the
completion of the building, and during that time it was
demonstrated that the precautions taken secured absolute
impermeability and solidity.</p>

<p>"The events of 1870 interrupted work just as it was about to
be prosecuted most vigorously, and the new Opera House was put to
new and unexpected uses. During the siege, it was converted into
a vast military storehouse and filled with a heterogeneous mass
of goods. After the siege the building fell into the hands of the
Commune and the roof was turned into a balloon station. The
damage done, however, was slight.</p>

<p>"The fine stone employed in the construction was brought from
quarries in Sweden, Scotland, Italy, Algeria, Finland, Spain,
Belgium and France. While work on the exterior was in progress,
the building was covered in by a wooden shell, rendered
transparent by thousands of small panes of glass. In 1867 a swarm
of men, supplied with hammers and axes, stripped the house of its
habit, and showed in all its splendor the great structure. No
picture can do justice to the rich colors of the edifice or to
the harmonious tone resulting from the skilful use of many
diverse materials. The effect of the frontage is completed by the
cupola of the auditorium, topped with a cap of bronze sparingly
adorned with gilding. Farther on, on a level with the towers of
Notre-Dame, is the gable end of the roof of the stage, a
'Pegasus', by M. Lequesne, rising at either end of the roof, and
a bronze group by M. Millet, representing 'Apollo lifting his
golden lyre', commanding the apex. Apollo, it may here be
mentioned, is useful as well as ornamental, for his lyre is
tipped with a metal point which does duty as a lightning-rod, and
conducts the fluid to the body and down the nether limbs of the
god.</p>

<p>"The spectator, having climbed ten steps and left behind him a
gateway, reaches a vestibule in which are statues of Lully,
Rameau, Gluck, and Handel. Ten steps of green Swedish marble lead
to a second vestibule for ticket-sellers. Visitors who enter the
pavilion reserved for carriages pass through a hallway where
ticket offices are situated. The larger number of the audience,
before entering the auditorium, traverse a large circular
vestibule located exactly beneath it. The ceiling of this portion
of the building is upheld by sixteen fluted columns of Jura
stone, with white marble capitals, forming a portico. Here
servants are to await their masters, and spectators may remain
until their carriages are summoned. The third entrance, which is
quite distinct from the others, is reserved for the Executive.
The section of the building set aside for the use of the Emperor
Napoleon was to have included an antechamber for the bodyguards;
a salon for the aides-de-camp; a large salon and a smaller one
for the Empress; hat and cloak rooms, etc. Moreover, there were
to be in close proximity to the entrance, stables for three
coaches, for the outriders' horses, and for the twenty-one
horsemen acting as an escort; a station for a squad of infantry
of thirty-one men and ten <i>cent-gardes</i>, and a stable for
the horses of the latter; and, besides, a salon for fifteen or
twenty domestics. Thus arrangements had to be made to accommodate
in this part of the building about one hundred persons, fifty
horses, and half-a-dozen carriages. The fall of the Empire
suggested some changes, but ample provision still exists for
emergencies.</p>

<p>"Its novel conception, perfect fitness, and rare splendor of
material, make the grand stairway unquestionably one of the most
remarkable features of the building. It presents to the
spectator, who has just passed through the subscribers' pavilion,
a gorgeous picture. From this point he beholds the ceiling formed
by the central landing; this and the columns sustaining it, built
of Echaillon stone, are honeycombed with arabesques and heavy
with ornaments; the steps are of white marble, and antique red
marble balusters rest on green marble sockets and support a
balustrade of onyx. To the right and to the left of this landing
are stairways to the floor, on a plane with the first row of
boxes. On this floor stand thirty monolith columns of Sarrancolin
marble, with white marble bases and capitals. Pilasters of
peach-blossom and violet stone are against the corresponding
walls. More than fifty blocks had to be extracted from the quarry
to find thirty perfect monoliths.</p>

<p>"The <i>foyer de la danse</i> has particular interest for the
habitués of the Opera. It is a place of reunion to which
subscribers to three performances a week are admitted between the
acts in accordance with a usage established in 1870. Three
immense looking-glasses cover the back wall of the <i>foyer</i>,
and a chandelier with one hundred and seven burners supplies it
with light. The paintings include twenty oval medallions, in
which are portrayed the twenty <i>danseuses</i> of most celebrity
since the opera has existed in France, and four panels by M.
Boulanger, typifying 'The War Dance', 'The Rustic Dance', 'The
Dance of Love' and 'The Bacchic Dance.' While the ladies of the
ballet receive their admirers in this <i>foyer</i>, they can
practise their steps. Velvet-cushioned bars have to this end been
secured at convenient points, and the floor has been given the
same slope as that of the stage, so that the labor expended may
be thoroughly profitable to the performance. The singers'
<i>foyer</i>, on the same floor, is a much lees lively resort
than the <i>foyer de la danse</i>, as vocalists rarely leave
their dressing-rooms before they are summoned to the stage.
Thirty panels with portraits of the artists of repute in the
annals of the Opera adorn this <i>foyer</i>. </p>

<p>"Some estimate... may be arrived at by sitting before the
<i>concierge</i> an hour or so before the representation
commences. First appear the stage carpenters, who are always
seventy, and sometimes, when <i>L'Africaine</i>, for example,
with its ship scene, is the opera, one hundred and ten strong.
Then come stage upholsterers, whose sole duty is to lay carpets,
hang curtains, etc.; gas-men, and a squad of firemen.
<i>Claqueurs</i>, call-boys, property-men, dressers,
<i>coiffeurs</i>, supernumeraries, and artists, follow. The
supernumeraries number about one hundred; some are hired by the
year, but the 'masses' are generally recruited at the last minute
and are generally working-men who seek to add to their meagre
earnings. There are about a hundred choristers, and about eighty
musicians.</p>

<p>"Next we behold equeries, whose horses are hoisted on the
stage by means of an elevator; electricians who manage the
light-producing batteries; <i>hydrauliciens</i> to take charge of
the water-works in ballets like <i>La Source</i>; artificers who
prepare the conflagration in <i>Le Profeta</i>; florists who make
ready Margarita's garden, and a host of minor employees. This
personnel is provided for as follows: Eighty dressing-rooms are
reserved for the artists, each including a small antechamber, the
dressing-room proper, and a little closet. Besides these
apartments, the Opera has a dressing-room for sixty male, and
another for fifty female choristers; a third for thirty-four male
dancers; four dressing-rooms for twenty female dancers of
different grades; a dressing-room for one hundred and ninety
supernumeraries, etc."</p>

<p>A few figures taken from the article will suggest the enormous
capacity and the perfect convenience of the house. "There are
2,531 doors and 7,593 keys; 14 furnaces and 450 grates heat the
house; the gas-pipes if connected would form a pipe almost 16
miles long; 9 reservoirs, and two tanks hold 22,222 gallons of
water and distribute their contents through 22,829 2-5 feet of
piping; 538 persons have places assigned wherein to change their
attire. The musicians have a <i>foyer</i> with 100 closets for
their instruments."'</p>

<p>The author remarks of his visit to the Opera House that it
"was almost as bewildering as it was agreeable. Giant stairways
and colossal halls, huge frescoes and enormous mirrors, gold and
marble, satin and velvet, met the eye at every turn."</p>

<p>In a recent letter Mr. André Castaigne, whose remarkable
pictures illustrate the text, speaks of a river or lake under the
Opera House and mentions the fact that there are now also three
metropolitan railway tunnels, one on top of the other.</p>
