<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Of the many illustrious thinkers whom the schools of France have
contributed to the intellectual philosophy of our age, Victor
Cousin, the most accomplished, assigns to Maine de Biran the rank
of the most original.</p>

<p>In the successive developments of his own mind, Maine de Biran
may, indeed, be said to represent the change that has been silently
at work throughout the general mind of Europe since the close of
the last century. He begins his career of philosopher with blind
faith in Condillac and Materialism. As an intellect severely
conscientious in the pursuit of truth expands amidst the
perplexities it revolves, phenomena which cannot be accounted for
by Condillac's sensuous theories open to his eye. To the first
rudimentary life of man, the animal life, "characterized by
impressions, appetites, movements, organic in their origin and
ruled by the Law of Necessity," (1) he is compelled to add, "the
second, or human life, from which Free-will and Self-consciousness
emerge." He thus arrives at the union of mind and matter; but still
a something is wanted,&mdash;some key to the marvels which neither
of these conditions of vital being suffices to explain. And at last
the grand self-completing Thinker attains to the Third Life of Man
in Man's Soul.</p>

<pre>
   "There are not," says this philosopher, towards the close of his last
    and loftiest work,&mdash;"there are not only two principles opposed to
    each other in Man,&mdash;there are three.  For there are in him three
    lives and three orders of faculties.  Though all should be in accord
    and in harmony between the sensitive and the active faculties
    which constitute Man, there would still be a nature superior, a
    third life which would not be satisfied; which would make felt
    (ferait sentir) the truth that there is another happiness, another
    wisdom, another perfection, at once above the greatest human
    happiness, above the highest wisdom, or intellectual and moral
    perfection of which the human being is susceptible." (2)
</pre>

<p>Now, as Philosophy and Romance both take their origin in the
Principle of Wonder, so in the "Strange Story" submitted to the
Public it will be seen that Romance, through the freest exercise of
its wildest vagaries, conducts its bewildered hero towards the same
goal to which Philosophy leads its luminous Student, through far
grander portents of Nature, far higher visions of Supernatural
Power, than Fable can yield to Fancy. That goal is defined in these
noble words:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "The relations (rapports) which exist between the elements and the
    products of the three lives of Man are the subjects of meditation,
    the fairest and finest, but also the most difficult.  The Stoic
    Philosophy shows us all which can be most elevated in active life;
    but it makes abstraction of the animal nature, and absolutely fails
    to recognize all which belongs to the life of the spirit.
    Its practical morality is beyond the forces of humanity.  Christianity
    alone embraces the whole Man.  It dissimulates none of the sides of
    his nature, and avails itself of his miseries and his weakness in
    order to conduct him to his end in showing him all the want that he
    has of a succor more exalted." (3)
</pre>

<p>In the passages thus quoted, I imply one of the objects for
which this tale has been written; and I cite them, with a wish to
acknowledge one of those priceless obligations which writings the
lightest and most fantastic often incur to reasoners the most
serious and profound.</p>

<p>But I here construct a romance which should have, as a romance,
some interest for the general reader. I do not elaborate a treatise
submitted to the logic of sages. And it is only when "in fairy
fiction drest" that Romance gives admission to "truths severe."</p>

<p>I venture to assume that none will question my privilege to
avail myself of the marvellous agencies which have ever been at the
legitimate command of the fabulist.</p>

<p>To the highest form of romantic narrative, the Epic, critics,
indeed, have declared that a supernatural machinery is
indispensable. That the Drama has availed itself of the same
license as the Epic, it would be unnecessary to say to the
countrymen of Shakspeare, or to the generation that is yet studying
the enigmas of Goethe's "Faust." Prose Romance has immemorially
asserted, no less than the Epic or the Drama, its heritage in the
Realm of the Marvellous. The interest which attaches to the
supernatural is sought in the earliest Prose Romance which modern
times take from the ancient, and which, perhaps, had its origin in
the lost Novels of Miletus; (4) and the right to invoke such
interest has, ever since, been maintained by Romance through all
varieties of form and fancy,&mdash;from the majestic epopee of
"Telemaque" to the graceful fantasies of "Undine," or the mighty
mockeries of "Gulliver's Travels" down to such comparatively
commonplace elements of wonder as yet preserve from oblivion "The
Castle of Otranto" and "The Old English Baron."</p>

<p>Now, to my mind, the true reason why a supernatural agency is
indispensable to the conception of the Epic, is that the Epic is
the highest and the completest form in which Art can express either
Man or Nature, and that without some gleams of the supernatural,
Man is not man nor Nature, nature.</p>

<p>It is said, by a writer to whom an eminent philosophical critic
justly applies the epithets of "pious and profound:" (5)</p>

<pre>
   "Is it unreasonable to confess that we believe in God, not by reason
    of the Nature which conceals Him, but by reason of the Supernatural
    in Man which alone reveals and proves Him to exist?...  Man reveals
    God: for Man, by his intelligence, rises above Nature; and in virtue
    of this intelligence is conscious of himself as a power not only
    independent of, but opposed to, Nature, and capable of resisting,
    conquering, and controlling her." (6)
</pre>

<p>If the meaning involved in the argument, of which I have here
made but scanty extracts, be carefully studied, I think that we
shall find deeper reasons than the critics who dictated canons of
taste to the last century discovered,&mdash;why the supernatural is
indispensable to the Epic, and why it is allowable to all works of
imagination, in which Art looks on Nature with Man's inner sense of
a something beyond and above her.</p>

<p>But the Writer who, whether in verse or prose, would avail
himself of such sources of pity or terror as flow from the
Marvellous, can only attain his object in proportion as the wonders
he narrates are of a kind to excite the curiosity of the age he
addresses.</p>

<p>In the brains of our time, the faculty of Causation is very
markedly developed. People nowadays do not delight in the
Marvellous according to the old childlike spirit. They say in one
breath, "Very extraordinary!" and in the next breath ask, "How do
you account for it?" If the Author of this work has presumed to
borrow from science some elements of interest for Romance, he
ventures to hope that no thoughtful reader&mdash;and certainly no
true son of science&mdash;will be disposed to reproach him. In
fact, such illustrations from the masters of Thought were essential
to the completion of the purpose which pervades the work.</p>

<p>That purpose, I trust, will develop itself in proportion as the
story approaches the close; and whatever may appear violent or
melodramatic in the catastrophe, will, perhaps, be found, by a
reader capable of perceiving the various symbolical meanings
conveyed in the story, essential to the end in which those meanings
converge, and towards which the incidents that give them the
character and interest of of fiction, have been planned and
directed from the commencement.</p>

<p>Of course, according to the most obvious principles of art, the
narrator of a fiction must be as thoroughly in earnest as if he
were the narrator of facts. One could not tell the most extravagant
fairy-tale so as to rouse and sustain the attention of the most
infantine listener, if the tale were told as if the taleteller did
not believe in it. But when the reader lays down this "Strange
Story," perhaps he will detect, through all the haze of romance,
the outlines of these images suggested to his reason: Firstly, the
image of sensuous, soulless Nature, such as the Materialist had
conceived it; secondly, the image of Intellect, obstinately
separating all its inquiries from the belief in the spiritual
essence and destiny of man, and incurring all kinds of perplexity
and resorting to all kinds of visionary speculation before it
settles at last into the simple faith which unites the philosopher
and the infant; and thirdly, the image of the erring but
pure-thoughted visionary, seeking over-much on this earth to
separate soul from mind, till innocence itself is led astray by a
phantom, and reason is lost in the space between earth and the
stars. Whether in these pictures there be any truth worth the
implying, every reader must judge for himself; and if he doubt or
deny that there be any such truth, still, in the process of thought
which the doubt or denial enforces, he may chance on a truth which
it pleases himself to discover.</p>

<pre>
   "Most of the Fables of AEsop,"&mdash;thus says Montaigne in his
    charming essay "Of Books" (7)&mdash;"have several senses and meanings, of
    which the Mythologists choose some one that tallies with the fable.
    But for the most part 't is only what presents itself at the first
    view, and is superficial; there being others more lively, essential,
    and internal, into which they had not been able to penetrate;
    and"&mdash;adds Montaigne&mdash;"the case is the very same with me."

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>In the year 18&mdash; I settled as a physician at one of the
wealthiest of our great English towns, which I will designate by
the initial L&mdash;&mdash;. I was yet young, but I had acquired
some reputation by a professional work, which is, I believe, still
amongst the received authorities on the subject of which it treats.
I had studied at Edinburgh and at Paris, and had borne away from
both those illustrious schools of medicine whatever guarantees for
future distinction the praise of professors may concede to the
ambition of students. On becoming a member of the College of
Physicians, I made a tour of the principal cities of Europe, taking
letters of introduction to eminent medical men, and gathering from
many theories and modes of treatment hints to enlarge the
foundations of unprejudiced and comprehensive practice. I had
resolved to fix my ultimate residence in London. But before this
preparatory tour was completed, my resolve was changed by one of
those unexpected events which determine the fate man in vain would
work out for himself. In passing through the Tyro, on my way into
the north of Italy, I found in a small inn, remote from medical
attendance, an English traveller seized with acute inflammation of
the lungs, and in a state of imminent danger. I devoted myself to
him night and day; and, perhaps more through careful nursing than
active remedies, I had the happiness to effect his complete
recovery. The traveller proved to be Julius Faber, a physician of
great distinction, contented to reside, where he was born, in the
provincial city of L&mdash;&mdash;, but whose reputation as a
profound and original pathologist was widely spread, and whose
writings had formed no unimportant part of my special studies. It
was during a short holiday excursion, from which he was about to
return with renovated vigour, that he had been thus stricken down.
The patient so accidentally met with became the founder of my
professional fortunes. He conceived a warm attachment for
me,&mdash;perhaps the more affectionate because he was a childless
bachelor, and the nephew who would succeed to his wealth evinced no
desire to succeed to the toils by which the wealth had been
acquired. Thus, having an heir for the one, he had long looked
about for an heir to the other, and now resolved on finding that
heir in me. So when we parted Dr. Faber made me promise to
correspond with him regularly, and it was not long before he
disclosed by letter the plans he had formed in my favour. He said
that he was growing old; his practice was beyond his strength; he
needed a partner; he was not disposed to put up to sale the health
of patients whom he had learned to regard as his children: money
was no object to him, but it was an object close at his heart that
the humanity he had served, and the reputation he had acquired,
should suffer no loss in his choice of a successor. In fine, he
proposed that I should at once come to L&mdash;&mdash; as his
partner, with the view of succeeding to his entire practice at the
end of two years, when it was his intention to retire.</p>

<p>The opening into fortune thus afforded to me was one that rarely
presents itself to a young man entering upon an overcrowded
profession; and to an aspirant less allured by the desire of
fortune than the hope of distinction, the fame of the physician who
thus generously offered to me the inestimable benefits of his long
experience and his cordial introduction was in itself an assurance
that a metropolitan practice is not essential to a national
renown.</p>

<p>I went, then, to L&mdash;&mdash;, and before the two years of my
partnership had expired, my success justified my kind friend's
selection, and far more than realized my own expectations. I was
fortunate in effecting some notable cures in the earliest cases
submitted to me, and it is everything in the career of a physician
when good luck wins betimes for him that confidence which patients
rarely accord except to lengthened experience. To the rapid
facility with which my way was made, some circumstances apart from
professional skill probably contributed. I was saved from the
suspicion of a medical adventurer by the accidents of birth and
fortune. I belonged to an ancient family (a branch of the once
powerful border-clan of the Fenwicks) that had for many generations
held a fair estate in the neighbourhood of Windermere. As an only
son I had succeeded to that estate on attaining my majority, and
had sold it to pay off the debts which had been made by my father,
who had the costly tastes of an antiquary and collector. The
residue on the sale insured me a modest independence apart from the
profits of a profession; and as I had not been legally bound to
defray my father's debts, so I obtained that character for
disinterestedness and integrity which always in England tends to
propitiate the public to the successes achieved by industry or
talent. Perhaps, too, any professional ability I might possess was
the more readily conceded, because I had cultivated with assiduity
the sciences and the scholarship which are collaterally connected
with the study of medicine. Thus, in a word, I established a social
position which came in aid of my professional repute, and silenced
much of that envy which usually embitters and sometimes impedes
success.</p>

<p>Dr. Faber retired at the end of the two years agreed upon. He
went abroad; and being, though advanced in years, of a frame still
robust, and habits of mind still inquiring and eager, he commenced
a lengthened course of foreign travel, during which our
correspondence, at first frequent, gradually languished, and
finally died away.</p>

<p>I succeeded at once to the larger part of the practice which the
labours of thirty years had secured to my predecessor. My chief
rival was a Dr. Lloyd, a benevolent, fervid man, not without
genius, if genius be present where judgment is absent; not without
science, if that may be science which fails in precision,&mdash;one
of those clever desultory men who, in adopting a profession, do not
give up to it the whole force and heat of their minds. Men of that
kind habitually accept a mechanical routine, because in the
exercise of their ostensible calling their imaginative faculties
are drawn away to pursuits more alluring. Therefore, in their
proper vocation they are seldom bold or inventive,&mdash;out of it
they are sometimes both to excess. And when they do take up a
novelty in their own profession they cherish it with an obstinate
tenacity, and an extravagant passion, unknown to those quiet
philosophers who take up novelties every day, examine them with the
sobriety of practised eyes, to lay down altogether, modify in part,
or accept in whole, according as inductive experiment supports or
destroys conjecture.</p>

<p>Dr. Lloyd had been esteemed a learned naturalist long before he
was admitted to be a tolerable physician. Amidst the privations of
his youth he had contrived to form, and with each succeeding year
he had perseveringly increased, a zoological collection of
creatures, not alive, but, happily for the beholder, stuffed or
embalmed. From what I have said, it will be truly inferred that Dr.
Lloyd's early career as a physician had not been brilliant; but of
late years he had gradually rather aged than worked himself into
that professional authority and station which time confers on a
thoroughly respectable man whom no one is disposed to envy, and all
are disposed to like.</p>

<p>Now in L&mdash;&mdash; there were two distinct social
circles,&mdash;that of the wealthy merchants and traders, and that
of a few privileged families inhabiting a part of the town aloof
from the marts of commerce, and called the Abbey Hill. These superb
Areopagites exercised over the wives and daughters of the inferior
citizens to whom all of L&mdash;&mdash;, except the Abbey Hill,
owed its prosperity, the same kind of mysterious influence which
the fine ladies of May Fair and Belgravia are reported to hold over
the female denizens of Bloomsbury and Marylebone.</p>

<p>Abbey Hill was not opulent; but it was powerful by a
concentration of its resources in all matters of patronage. Abbey
Hill had its own milliner and its own draper, its own confectioner,
butcher, baker, and tea-dealer; and the patronage of Abbey Hill was
like the patronage of royalty,&mdash;less lucrative in itself than
as a solemn certificate of general merit. The shops on which Abbey
Hill conferred its custom were certainly not the cheapest, possibly
not the best; but they were undeniably the most imposing. The
proprietors were decorously pompous, the shopmen superciliously
polite. They could not be more so if they had belonged to the
State, and been paid by a public which they benefited and despised.
The ladies of Low Town (as the city subjacent to the Hill had been
styled from a date remote in the feudal ages) entered those shops
with a certain awe, and left them with a certain pride. There they
had learned what the Hill approved; there they had bought what the
Hill had purchased. It is much in this life to be quite sure that
we are in the right, whatever that conviction may cost us. Abbey
Hill had been in the habit of appointing, amongst other objects of
patronage, its own physician. But that habit had fallen into disuse
during the latter years of my predecessor's practice. His
superiority over all other medical men in the town had become so
incontestable, that, though he was emphatically the doctor of Low
Town, the head of its hospitals and infirmaries, and by birth
related to its principal traders, still as Abbey Hill was
occasionally subject to the physical infirmities of meaner mortals,
so on those occasions it deemed it best not to push the point of
honour to the wanton sacrifice of life. Since Low Town possessed
one of the most famous physicians in England, Abbey Hill
magnanimously resolved not to crush him by a rival. Abbey Hill let
him feel its pulse.</p>

<p>When my predecessor retired, I had presumptuously expected that
the Hill would have continued to suspend its normal right to a
special physician, and shown to me the same generous favour it had
shown to him, who had declared me worthy to succeed to his honours.
I had the more excuse for this presumption because the Hill had
already allowed me to visit a fair proportion of its invalids, had
said some very gracious things to me about the great respectability
of the Fenwick family, and sent me some invitations to dinner, and
a great many invitations to tea.</p>

<p>But my self-conceit received a notable check. Abbey Hill
declared that the time had come to reassert its dormant privilege;
it must have a doctor of its own choosing,&mdash;a doctor who
might, indeed, be permitted to visit Low Town from motives of
humanity or gain, but who must emphatically assert his special
allegiance to Abbey Hill by fixing his home on that venerable
promontory. Miss Brabazon, a spinster of uncertain age but
undoubted pedigree, with small fortune but high nose, which she
would pleasantly observe was a proof of her descent from Humphrey
Duke of Gloucester (with whom, indeed, I have no doubt, in spite of
chronology, that she very often dined), was commissioned to inquire
of me diplomatically, and without committing Abbey Hill too much by
the overture, whether I would take a large and antiquated mansion,
in which abbots were said to have lived many centuries ago, and
which was still popularly styled Abbots' House, situated on the
verge of the Hill, as in that case the "Hill" would think of
me.</p>

<p>"It is a large house for a single man, I allow," said Miss
Brabazon, candidly; and then added, with a sidelong glance of
alarming sweetness, "but when Dr. Fenwick has taken his true
position (so old a family!) amongst us, he need not long remain
single, unless he prefer it."</p>

<p>I replied, with more asperity than the occasion called for, that
I had no thought of changing my residence at present, and if the
Hill wanted me, the Hill must send for me.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards Dr. Lloyd took Abbots' House, and in less
than a week was proclaimed medical adviser to the Hill. The
election had been decided by the fiat of a great lady, who reigned
supreme on the sacred eminence, under the name and title of Mrs.
Colonel Poyntz.</p>

<p>"Dr. Fenwick," said this lady, "is a clever young man and a
gentleman, but he gives himself airs,&mdash;the Hill does not allow
any airs but its own. Besides, he is a new comer: resistance to new
comers, and, indeed, to all things new, except caps and novels, is
one of the bonds that keep old established societies together.
Accordingly, it is by my advice that Dr. Lloyd has taken Abbots'
House; the rent would be too high for his means if the Hill did not
feel bound in honour to justify the trust he has placed in its
patronage. I told him that all my friends, when they were in want
of a doctor, would send for him; those who are my friends will do
so. What the Hill does, plenty of common people down there will do
also,&mdash;so that question is settled!" And it was settled.</p>

<p>Dr. Lloyd, thus taken by the hand, soon extended the range of
his visits beyond the Hill, which was not precisely a mountain of
gold to doctors, and shared with myself, though in a comparatively
small degree, the much more lucrative practice of Low Town.</p>

<p>I had no cause to grudge his success, nor did I. But to my
theories of medicine his diagnosis was shallow, and his
prescriptions obsolete. When we were summoned to a joint
consultation, our views as to the proper course of treatment seldom
agreed. Doubtless he thought I ought to have deferred to his
seniority in years; but I held the doctrine which youth deems a
truth and age a paradox,&mdash;namely, that in science the young
men are the practical elders, inasmuch as they are schooled in the
latest experiences science has gathered up, while their seniors are
cramped by the dogmas they were schooled to believe when the world
was some decades the younger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my reputation continued rapidly to advance; it became
more than local; my advice was sought even by patients from the
metropolis. That ambition, which, conceived in early youth, had
decided my career and sweetened all its labours,&mdash;the ambition
to take a rank and leave a name as one of the great pathologists to
whom humanity accords a grateful, if calm, renown,&mdash;saw before
it a level field and a certain goal.</p>

<p>I know not whether a success far beyond that usually attained at
the age I had reached served to increase, but it seemed to myself
to justify, the main characteristic of my moral
organization,&mdash;intellectual pride.</p>

<p>Though mild and gentle to the sufferers under my care, as a
necessary element of professional duty, I was intolerant of
contradiction from those who belonged to my calling, or even from
those who, in general opinion, opposed my favourite theories. I had
espoused a school of medical philosophy severely rigid in its
inductive logic. My creed was that of stern materialism. I had a
contempt for the understanding of men who accepted with credulity
what they could not explain by reason. My favourite phrase was
"common-sense." At the same time I had no prejudice against bold
discovery, and discovery necessitates conjecture, but I dismissed
as idle all conjecture that could not be brought to a practical
test.</p>

<p>As in medicine I had been the pupil of Broussais, so in
metaphysics I was the disciple of Condillac. I believed with that
philosopher that "all our knowledge we owe to Nature; that in the
beginning we can only instruct ourselves through her lessons; and
that the whole art of reasoning consists in continuing as she has
compelled us to commence." Keeping natural philosophy apart from
the doctrines of revelation, I never assailed the last; but I
contended that by the first no accurate reasoner could arrive at
the existence of the soul as a third principle of being equally
distinct from mind and body. That by a miracle man might live
again, was a question of faith and not of understanding. I left
faith to religion, and banished it from philosophy. How define with
a precision to satisfy the logic of philosophy what was to live
again? The body? We know that the body rests in its grave till by
the process of decomposition its elemental parts enter into other
forms of matter. The mind? But the mind was as clearly the result
of the bodily organization as the music of the harpsichord is the
result of the instrumental mechanism. The mind shared the
decrepitude of the body in extreme old age, and in the full vigour
of youth a sudden injury to the brain might forever destroy the
intellect of a Plato or a Shakspeare. But the third
principle,&mdash;the soul,&mdash;the something lodged within the
body, which yet was to survive it? Where was that soul hidden out
of the ken of the anatomist? When philosophers attempted to define
it, were they not compelled to confound its nature and its actions
with those of the mind? Could they reduce it to the mere moral
sense, varying according to education, circumstances, and physical
constitution? But even the moral sense in the most virtuous of men
may be swept away by a fever. Such at the time I now speak of were
the views I held,&mdash;views certainly not original nor pleasing;
but I cherished them with as fond a tenacity as if they had been
consolatory truths of which I was the first discoverer. I was
intolerant to those who maintained opposite
doctrines,&mdash;despised them as irrational, or disliked them as
insincere. Certainly if I had fulfilled the career which my
ambition predicted,&mdash;become the founder of a new school in
pathology, and summed up my theories in academical
lectures,&mdash;I should have added another authority, however
feeble, to the sects which circumscribe the interest of man to the
life that has its close in his grave.</p>

<p>Possibly that which I have called my intellectual pride was more
nourished than I should have been willing to grant by the
self-reliance which an unusual degree of physical power is apt to
bestow. Nature had blessed me with the thews of an athlete. Among
the hardy youths of the Northern Athens I had been preeminently
distinguished for feats of activity and strength. My mental
labours, and the anxiety which is inseparable from the
conscientious responsibilities of the medical profession, kept my
health below the par of keen enjoyment, but had in no way
diminished my rare muscular force. I walked through the crowd with
the firm step and lofty crest of the mailed knight of old, who felt
himself, in his casement of iron, a match against numbers. Thus the
sense of a robust individuality, strong alike in disciplined reason
and animal vigour, habituated to aid others, needing no aid for
itself, contributed to render me imperious in will and arrogant in
opinion. Nor were such defects injurious to me in my profession; on
the contrary, aided as they were by a calm manner, and a presence
not without that kind of dignity which is the livery of
self-esteem, they served to impose respect and to inspire
trust.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>I had been about six years at L&mdash;&mdash; when I became
suddenly involved in a controversy with Dr. Lloyd. Just as this
ill-fated man appeared at the culminating point of his professional
fortunes, he had the imprudence to proclaim himself not only an
enthusiastic advocate of mesmerism as a curative process, but an
ardent believer of the reality of somnambular clairvoyance as an
invaluable gift of certain privileged organizations. To these
doctrines I sternly opposed myself,&mdash;the more sternly,
perhaps, because on these doctrines Dr. Lloyd founded an argument
for the existence of soul, independent of mind, as of matter, and
built thereon a superstructure of physiological fantasies, which,
could it be substantiated, would replace every system of
metaphysics on which recognized philosophy condescends to
dispute.</p>

<p>About two years before he became a disciple rather of Puysegur
than Mesmer (for Mesmer hard little faith in that gift of
clairvoyance of which Puysegur was, I believe, at least in modern
times, the first audacious asserter), Dr. Lloyd had been afflicted
with the loss of a wife many years younger than himself, and to
whom he had been tenderly attached. And this bereavement, in
directing the hopes that consoled him to a world beyond the grave,
had served perhaps to render him more credulous of the phenomena in
which he greeted additional proofs of purely spiritual existence.
Certainly, if, in controverting the notions of another
physiologist, I had restricted myself to that fair antagonism which
belongs to scientific disputants anxious only for the truth, I
should need no apology for sincere conviction and honest argument;
but when, with condescending good-nature, as if to a man much
younger than himself, who was ignorant of the phenomena which he
nevertheless denied, Dr. Lloyd invited me to attend his seances and
witness his cures, my amour propre became aroused and nettled, and
it seemed to me necessary to put down what I asserted to be too
gross an outrage on common-sense to justify the ceremony of
examination. I wrote, therefore, a small pamphlet on the subject,
in which I exhausted all the weapons that irony can lend to
contempt. Dr. Lloyd replied; and as he was no very skilful arguer,
his reply injured him perhaps more than my assault. Meanwhile, I
had made some inquiries as to the moral character of his favourite
clairvoyants. I imagined that I had learned enough to justify me in
treating them as flagrant cheats, and himself as their egregious
dupe.</p>

<p>Low Town soon ranged itself, with very few exceptions, on my
side. The Hill at first seemed disposed to rally round its insulted
physician, and to make the dispute a party question, in which the
Hill would have been signally worsted, when suddenly the same lady
paramount, who had secured to Dr. Lloyd the smile of the Eminence,
spoke forth against him, and the Eminence frowned.</p>

<p>"Dr. Lloyd," said the Queen of the Hill, "is an amiable
creature, but on this subject decidedly cracked. Cracked poets may
be all the better for being cracked,&mdash;cracked doctors are
dangerous. Besides, in deserting that old-fashioned routine, his
adherence to which made his claim to the Hill's approbation, and
unsettling the mind of the Hill with wild revolutionary theories,
Dr. Lloyd has betrayed the principles on which the Hill itself
rests its social foundations. Of those principles Dr. Fenwick has
made himself champion; and the Hill is bound to support him. There,
the question is settled!"</p>

<p>And it was settled.</p>

<p>From the moment Mrs. Colonel Poyntz thus issued the word of
command, Dr. Lloyd was demolished. His practice was gone, as well
as his repute. Mortification or anger brought on a stroke of
paralysis which, disabling my opponent, put an end to our
controversy. An obscure Dr. Jones, who had been the special pupil
and protege of Dr. Lloyd, offered himself as a candidate for the
Hill's tongues and pulses. The Hill gave him little encouragement.
It once more suspended its electoral privileges, and, without
insisting on calling me up to it, the Hill quietly called me in
whenever its health needed other advice than that of its visiting
apothecary. Again it invited me, sometimes to dinner, often to tea;
and again Miss Brabazon assured me by a sidelong glance that it was
no fault of hers if I were still single.</p>

<p>I had almost forgotten the dispute which had obtained for me so
conspicuous a triumph, when one winter's night I was roused from
sleep by a summons to attend Dr Lloyd, who, attacked by a second
stroke a few hours previously, had, on recovering sense, expressed
a vehement desire to consult the rival by whom he had suffered so
severely. I dressed myself in haste and hurried to his house.</p>

<p>A February night, sharp and bitter; an iron-gray frost below, a
spectral melancholy moon above. I had to ascend the Abbey Hill by a
steep, blind lane between high walls. I passed through stately
gates, which stood wide open, into the garden ground that
surrounded the old Abbots' House. At the end of a short
carriage-drive the dark and gloomy building cleared itself from
leafless skeleton trees,&mdash;the moon resting keen and cold on
its abrupt gables and lofty chimney-stacks. An old woman-servant
received me at the door, and, without saying a word, led me through
a long low hall, and up dreary oak stairs, to a broad landing, at
which she paused for a moment, listening. Round and about hall,
staircase, and landing were ranged the dead specimens of the savage
world which it had been the pride of the naturalist's life to
collect. Close where I stood yawned the open jaws of the fell
anaconda, its lower coils hidden, as they rested on the floor
below, by the winding of the massive stairs. Against the dull
wainscot walls were pendent cases stored with grotesque unfamiliar
mummies, seen imperfectly by the moon that shot through the
window-panes, and the candle in the old woman's hand. And as now
she turned towards me, nodding her signal to follow, and went on up
the shadowy passage, rows of gigantic birds&mdash;ibis and vulture,
and huge sea glaucus&mdash;glared at me in the false light of their
hungry eyes.</p>

<p>So I entered the sick-room, and the first glance told me that my
art was powerless there.</p>

<p>The children of the stricken widower were grouped round his bed,
the eldest apparently about fifteen, the youngest four; one little
girl&mdash;the only female child&mdash;was clinging to her father's
neck, her face pressed to his bosom, and in that room her sobs
alone were loud.</p>

<p>As I passed the threshold, Dr. Lloyd lifted his face, which had
been bent over the weeping child, and gazed on me with an aspect of
strange glee, which I failed to interpret. Then as I stole towards
him softly and slowly, he pressed his lips on the long fair tresses
that streamed wild over his breast, motioned to a nurse who stood
beside his pillow to take the child away, and in a voice clearer
than I could have expected in one on whose brow lay the
unmistakable hand of death, he bade the nurse and the children quit
the room. All went sorrowfully, but silently, save the little girl,
who, borne off in the nurse's arms, continued to sob as if her
heart were breaking.</p>

<p>I was not prepared for a scene so affecting; it moved me to the
quick. My eyes wistfully followed the children so soon to be
orphans, as one after one went out into the dark chill shadow, and
amidst the bloodless forms of the dumb brute nature, ranged in
grisly vista beyond the death-room of man. And when the last infant
shape had vanished, and the door closed with a jarring click, my
sight wandered loiteringly around the chamber before I could bring
myself to fix it on the broken form, beside which I now stood in
all that glorious vigour of frame which had fostered the pride of
my mind. In the moment consumed by my mournful survey, the whole
aspect of the place impressed itself ineffaceably on lifelong
remembrance. Through the high, deepsunken casement, across which
the thin, faded curtain was but half drawn, the moonlight rushed,
and then settled on the floor in one shroud of white glimmer, lost
under the gloom of the death-bed. The roof was low, and seemed
lower still by heavy intersecting beams, which I might have touched
with my lifted hand. And the tall guttering candle by the bedside,
and the flicker from the fire struggling out through the fuel but
newly heaped on it, threw their reflection on the ceiling just over
my head in a reek of quivering blackness, like an angry cloud.</p>

<p>Suddenly I felt my arm grasped; with his left hand (the right
side was already lifeless) the dying man drew me towards him nearer
and nearer, till his lips almost touched my ear, and, in a voice
now firm, now splitting into gasp and hiss, thus he said, "I have
summoned you to gaze on your own work! You have stricken down my
life at the moment when it was most needed by my children, and most
serviceable to mankind. Had I lived a few years longer, my children
would have entered on manhood, safe from the temptations of want
and undejected by the charity of strangers. Thanks to you, they
will be penniless orphans. Fellow-creatures afflicted by maladies
your pharmacopoeia had failed to reach came to me for relief, and
they found it. 'The effect of imagination,' you say. What matters,
if I directed the imagination to cure? Now you have mocked the
unhappy ones out of their last chance of life. They will suffer and
perish. Did you believe me in error? Still you knew that my object
was research into truth. You employed against your brother in art
venomous drugs and a poisoned probe. Look at me! Are you satisfied
with your work?"</p>

<p>I sought to draw back and pluck my arm from the dying man's
grasp. I could not do so without using a force that would have been
inhuman. His lips drew nearer still to my ear.</p>

<p>"Vain pretender, do not boast that you brought a genius for
epigram to the service of science. Science is lenient to all who
offer experiment as the test of conjecture. You are of the stuff of
which inquisitors are made. You cry that truth is profaned when
your dogmas are questioned. In your shallow presumption you have
meted the dominions of nature, and where your eye halts its vision,
you say, 'There nature must close;' in the bigotry which adds crime
to presumption, you would stone the discoverer who, in annexing new
realms to her chart, unsettles your arbitrary landmarks. Verily,
retribution shall await you! In those spaces which your sight has
disdained to explore you shall yourself be a lost and bewildered
straggler. Hist! I see them already! The gibbering phantoms are
gathering round you!"</p>

<p>The man's voice stopped abruptly; his eye fixed in a glazing
stare; his hand relaxed its hold; he fell back on his pillow. I
stole from the room; on the landing-place I met the nurse and the
old woman-servant. Happily the children were not there. But I heard
the wail of the female child from some room not far distant.</p>

<p>I whispered hurriedly to the nurse, "All is over!" passed again
under the jaws of the vast anaconda, and on through the blind lane
between the dead walls, on through the ghastly streets, under the
ghastly moon, went back to my solitary home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>It was some time before I could shake off the impression made on
me by the words and the look of that dying man.</p>

<p>It was not that my conscience upbraided me. What had I done?
Denounced that which I held, in common with most men of sense in or
out of my profession, to be one of those illusions by which
quackery draws profit from the wonder of ignorance. Was I to blame
if I refused to treat with the grave respect due to asserted
discovery in legitimate science pretensions to powers akin to the
fables of wizards? Was I to descend from the Academe of decorous
science to examine whether a slumbering sibyl could read from a
book placed at her back, or tell me at L&mdash;&mdash; what at that
moment was being done by my friend at the Antipodes?</p>

<p>And what though Dr. Lloyd himself might be a worthy and honest
man, and a sincere believer in the extravagances for which he
demanded an equal credulity in others, do not honest men every day
incur the penalty of ridicule if, from a defect of good sense, they
make themselves ridiculous? Could I have foreseen that a satire so
justly provoked would inflict so deadly a wound? Was I inhumanly
barbarous because the antagonist destroyed was morbidly sensitive?
My conscience, therefore, made me no reproach, and the public was
as little severe as my conscience. The public had been with me in
our contest; the public knew nothing of my opponent's deathbed
accusations; the public knew only that I had attended him in his
last moments; it saw me walk beside the bier that bore him to his
grave; it admired the respect to his memory which I evinced in the
simple tomb that I placed over his remains, inscribed with an
epitaph that did justice to his unquestionable benevolence and
integrity; above all, it praised the energy with which I set on
foot a subscription for his orphan children, and the generosity
with which I headed that subscription by a sum that was large in
proportion to my means.</p>

<p>To that sum I did not, indeed, limit my contribution. The sobs
of the poor female child rang still on my heart. As her grief had
been keener than that of her brothers, so she might be subjected to
sharper trials than they, when the time came for her to fight her
own way through the world; therefore I secured to her, but with
such precautions that the gift could not be traced to my hand, a
sum to accumulate till she was of marriageable age, and which then
might suffice for a small wedding portion; or if she remained
single, for an income that would place her beyond the temptation of
want, or the bitterness of a servile dependence.</p>

<p>That Dr. Lloyd should have died in poverty was a matter of
surprise at first, for his profits during the last few years had
been considerable, and his mode of life far from extravagant. But
just before the date of our controversy he had been induced to
assist the brother of his lost wife, who was a junior partner in a
London bank, with the loan of his accumulated savings. This man
proved dishonest; he embezzled that and other sums intrusted to
him, and fled the country. The same sentiment of conjugal affection
which had cost Dr. Lloyd his fortune kept him silent as to the
cause of the loss. It was reserved for his executors to discover
the treachery of the brother-in-law whom he, poor man, would have
generously screened from additional disgrace.</p>

<p>The Mayor of L&mdash;&mdash;, a wealthy and public-spirited
merchant, purchased the museum, which Dr. Lloyd's passion for
natural history had induced him to form; and the sum thus obtained,
together with that raised by subscription, sufficed not only to
discharge all debts due by the deceased, but to insure to the
orphans the benefits of an education that might fit at least the
boys to enter fairly armed into that game, more of skill than of
chance, in which Fortune is really so little blinded that we see,
in each turn of her wheel, wealth and its honours pass away from
the lax fingers of ignorance and sloth, to the resolute grasp of
labour and knowledge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a relation in a distant county undertook the charge of
the orphans; they disappeared from the scene, and the tides of life
in a commercial community soon flowed over the place which the dead
man had occupied in the thoughts of his bustling townsfolk.</p>

<p>One person at L&mdash;&mdash;, and only one, appeared to share
and inherit the rancour with which the poor physician had denounced
me on his death-bed. It was a gentleman named Vigors, distantly
related to the deceased, and who had been, in point of station, the
most eminent of Dr. Lloyd's partisans in the controversy with
myself, a man of no great scholastic acquirements, but of
respectable abilities. He had that kind of power which the world
concedes to respectable abilities when accompanied with a temper
more than usually stern, and a moral character more than usually
austere. His ruling passion was to sit in judgment upon others; and
being a magistrate, he was the most active and the most rigid of
all the magistrates L&mdash;&mdash; had ever known.</p>

<p>Mr. Vigors at first spoke of me with great bitterness, as having
ruined, and in fact killed, his friend, by the uncharitable and
unfair acerbity which he declared I had brought into what ought to
have been an unprejudiced examination of simple matter of fact. But
finding no sympathy in these charges, he had the discretion to
cease from making them, contenting himself with a solemn shake of
his head if he heard my name mentioned in terms of praise, and an
oracular sentence or two, such as "Time will show," "All's well
that ends well," etc. Mr. Vigors, however, mixed very little in the
more convivial intercourse of the townspeople. He called himself
domestic; but, in truth, he was ungenial,&mdash;a stiff man,
starched with self-esteem. He thought that his dignity of station
was not sufficiently acknowledged by the merchants of Low Town, and
his superiority of intellect not sufficiently recognized by the
exclusives of the Hill. His visits were, therefore, chiefly
confined to the houses of neighbouring squires, to whom his
reputation as a magistrate, conjoined with his solemn exterior,
made him one of those oracles by which men consent to be awed on
condition that the awe is not often inflicted. And though he opened
his house three times a week, it was only to a select few, whom he
first fed and then biologized. Electro-biology was very naturally
the special entertainment of a man whom no intercourse ever pleased
in which his will was not imposed upon others. Therefore he only
invited to his table persons whom he could stare into the
abnegation of their senses, willing to say that beef was lamb, or
brandy was coffee, according as he willed them to say. And, no
doubt, the persons asked would have said anything he willed, so
long as they had, in substance, as well as in idea, the beef and
the brandy, the lamb and the coffee. I did not, then, often meet
Mr. Vigors at the houses in which I occasionally spent my evenings.
I heard of his enmity as a man safe in his home hears the sough of
a wind on a common without. If now and then we chanced to pass in
the streets, he looked up at me (he was a small man walking on
tiptoe) with a sullen scowl of dislike; and from the height of my
stature, I dropped upon the small man and sullen scowl the affable
smile of supreme indifference.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>I had now arrived at that age when an ambitious man, satisfied
with his progress in the world without, begins to feel in the
cravings of unsatisfied affection the void of a solitary hearth. I
resolved to marry, and looked out for a wife. I had never hitherto
admitted into my life the passion of love. In fact, I had regarded
that passion, even in my earlier youth, with a certain superb
contempt,&mdash;as a malady engendered by an effeminate idleness,
and fostered by a sickly imagination.</p>

<p>I wished to find in a wife a rational companion, an affectionate
and trustworthy friend. No views of matrimony could be less
romantic, more soberly sensible, than those which I conceived. Nor
were my requirements mercenary or presumptuous. I cared not for
fortune; I asked nothing from connections. My ambition was
exclusively professional; it could be served by no titled kindred,
accelerated by no wealthy dower. I was no slave to beauty. I did
not seek in a wife the accomplishments of a finishing-school
teacher.</p>

<p>Having decided that the time had come to select my helpmate, I
imagined that I should find no difficulty in a choice that my
reason would approve. But day upon day, week upon week, passed
away, and though among the families I visited there were many young
ladies who possessed more than the qualifications with which I
conceived that I should be amply contented, and by whom I might
flatter myself that my proposals would not be disdained, I saw not
one to whose lifelong companionship I should not infinitely have
preferred the solitude I found so irksome.</p>

<p>One evening, in returning home from visiting a poor female
patient whom I attended gratuitously, and whose case demanded more
thought than that of any other in my list,&mdash;for though it had
been considered hopeless in the hospital, and she had come home to
die, I felt certain that I could save her, and she seemed
recovering under my care,&mdash;one evening&mdash;it was the
fifteenth of May&mdash;I found myself just before the gates of the
house that had been inhabited by Dr. Lloyd. Since his death the
house had been unoccupied; the rent asked for it by the proprietor
was considered high; and from the sacred Hill on which it was
situated, shyness or pride banished the wealthier traders. The
garden gates stood wide open, as they had stood on the winter night
on which I had passed through them to the chamber of death. The
remembrance of that deathbed came vividly before me, and the dying
man's fantastic threat rang again in my startled ears. An
irresistible impulse, which I could not then account for, and which
I cannot account for now,&mdash;an impulse the reverse of that
which usually makes us turn away with quickened step from a spot
that recalls associations of pain,&mdash;urged me on through the
open gates up the neglected grass-grown road, urged me to look,
under the weltering sun of the joyous spring, at that house which I
had never seen but in the gloom of a winter night, under the
melancholy moon. As the building came in sight, with dark-red
bricks, partially overgrown with ivy, I perceived that it was no
longer unoccupied. I saw forms passing athwart the open windows; a
van laden with articles of furniture stood before the door; a
servant in livery was beside it giving directions to the men who
were unloading. Evidently some family was just entering into
possession. I felt somewhat ashamed of my trespass, and turned
round quickly to retrace my steps. I had retreated but a few yards,
when I saw before me, at the entrance gates, Mr. Vigors, walking
beside a lady apparently of middle age; while, just at hand, a path
cut through the shrubs gave view of a small wicketgate at the end
of the grounds. I felt unwilling not only to meet the lady, whom I
guessed to be the new occupier, and to whom I should have to make a
somewhat awkward apology for intrusion, but still more to encounter
the scornful look of Mr. Vigors in what appeared to my pride a
false or undignified position. Involuntarily, therefore, I turned
down the path which would favour my escape unobserved. When about
half way between the house and the wicket-gate, the shrubs that had
clothed the path on either side suddenly opened to the left,
bringing into view a circle of sward, surrounded by irregular
fragments of old brickwork partially covered with ferns, creepers,
or rockplants, weeds, or wild flowers; and, in the centre of the
circle, a fountain, or rather well, over which was built a Gothic
monastic dome, or canopy, resting on small Norman columns,
time-worn, dilapidated. A large willow overhung this unmistakable
relic of the ancient abbey. There was an air of antiquity, romance,
legend about this spot, so abruptly disclosed amidst the delicate
green of the young shrubberies. But it was not the ruined wall nor
the Gothic well that chained my footstep and charmed my eye.</p>

<p>It was a solitary human form, seated amidst the mournful
ruins.</p>

<p>The form was so slight, the face so young, that at the first
glance I murmured to myself, "What a lovely child!" But as my eye
lingered it recognized in the upturned thoughtful brow, in the
sweet, serious aspect, in the rounded outlines of that slender
shape, the inexpressible dignity of virgin woman.</p>

<p>A book was on her lap, at her feet a little basket, half-filled
with violets and blossoms culled from the rock-plants that nestled
amidst the ruins. Behind her, the willow, like an emerald
waterfall, showered down its arching abundant green, bough after
bough, from the tree-top to the sward, descending in wavy verdure,
bright towards the summit, in the smile of the setting sun, and
darkening into shadow as it neared the earth.</p>

<p>She did not notice, she did not see me; her eyes were fixed upon
the horizon, where it sloped farthest into space, above the
treetops and the ruins,&mdash;fixed so intently that mechanically I
turned my own gaze to follow the flight of hers. It was as if she
watched for some expected, familiar sign to grow out from the
depths of heaven; perhaps to greet, before other eyes beheld it,
the ray of the earliest star.</p>

<p>The birds dropped from the boughs on the turf around her so
fearlessly that one alighted amidst the flowers in the little
basket at her feet. There is a famous German poem, which I had read
in my youth, called the Maiden from Abroad, variously supposed to
be an allegory of Spring, or of Poetry, according to the choice of
commentators: it seemed to me as if the poem had been made for her.
Verily, indeed, in her, poet or painter might have seen an image
equally true to either of those adornments of the earth; both
outwardly a delight to sense, yet both wakening up thoughts within
us, not sad, but akin to sadness.</p>

<p>I heard now a step behind me, and a voice which I recognized to
be that of Mr. Vigors. I broke from the charm by which I had been
so lingeringly spell-bound, hurried on confusedly, gained the
wicket-gate, from which a short flight of stairs descended into the
common thoroughfare. And there the every-day life lay again before
me. On the opposite side, houses, shops, church-spires; a few steps
more, and the bustling streets! How immeasurably far from, yet how
familiarly near to, the world in which we move and have being is
that fairy-land of romance which opens out from the hard earth
before us, when Love steals at first to our side, fading back into
the hard earth again as Love smiles or sighs its farewell!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>And before that evening I had looked on Mr. Vigors with supreme
indifference! What importance he now assumed in my eyes! The lady
with whom I had seen him was doubtless the new tenant of that house
in which the young creature by whom my heart was so strangely moved
evidently had her home. Most probably the relation between the two
ladies was that of mother and daughter. Mr. Vigors, the friend of
one, might himself be related to both, might prejudice them against
me, might&mdash;Here, starting up, I snapped the thread of
conjecture, for right before my eyes, on the table beside which I
had seated myself on entering my room, lay a card of
invitation:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
            MRS. POYNTZ.
              At Home,
         Wednesday, May 15th.
      Early.
</pre>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz,&mdash;Mrs. Colonel Poyntz, the Queen of the Hill?
There, at her house, I could not fail to learn all about the new
comers, who could never without her sanction have settled on her
domain.</p>

<p>I hastily changed my dress, and, with beating heart, wound my
way up the venerable eminence.</p>

<p>I did not pass through the lane which led direct to Abbots'
House (for that old building stood solitary amidst its grounds a
little apart from the spacious platform on which the society of the
Hill was concentrated), but up the broad causeway, with vistaed
gaslamps; the gayer shops still-unclosed, the tide of busy life
only slowly ebbing from the still-animated street, on to a square,
in which the four main thoroughfares of the city converged, and
which formed the boundary of Low Town. A huge dark archway,
popularly called Monk's Gate, at the angle of this square, made the
entrance to Abbey Hill. When the arch was passed, one felt at once
that one was in the town of a former day. The pavement was narrow
and rugged; the shops small, their upper stories projecting, with
here and there plastered fronts, quaintly arabesque. An ascent,
short, but steep and tortuous, conducted at once to the old Abbey
Church, nobly situated in a vast quadrangle, round which were the
genteel and gloomy dwellings of the Areopagites of the Hill. More
genteel and less gloomy than the rest&mdash;lights at the windows
and flowers on the balcony&mdash;stood forth, flanked by a garden
wall at either side, the mansion of Mrs. Colonel Poyntz.</p>

<p>As I entered the drawing-room, I heard the voice of the hostess;
it was a voice clear, decided, metallic, bell-like, uttering these
words: "Taken Abbots' House? I will tell you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz was seated on the sofa; at her right sat fat Mrs.
Bruce, who was a Scotch lord's grand-daughter; at her left thin
Miss Brabazon, who was an Irish baronet's niece. Around her&mdash;a
few seated, many standing&mdash;had grouped all the guests, save
two old gentlemen, who had remained aloof with Colonel Poyntz near
the whist-table, waiting for the fourth old gentleman who was to
make up the rubber, but who was at that moment spell-bound in the
magic circle which curiosity, that strongest of social demons, had
attracted round the hostess.</p>

<p>"Taken Abbots' House? I will tell you.&mdash;Ah, Dr. Fenwick,
charmed to see you. You know Abbots' House is let at last? Well,
Miss Brabazon, dear, you ask who has taken it. I will inform
you,&mdash;a particular friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Dear me!" said Miss Brabazon, looking confused. "I hope
I did not say anything to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wound my feelings. Not in the least. You said your uncle Sir
Phelim employed a coachmaker named Ashleigh, that Ashleigh was an
uncommon name, though Ashley was a common one; you intimated an
appalling suspicion that the Mrs. Ashleigh who had come to the Hill
was the coach maker's widow. I relieve your mind,&mdash;she is not;
she is the widow of Gilbert Ashleigh, of Kirby Hall."</p>

<p>"Gilbert Ashleigh," said one of the guests, a bachelor, whose
parents had reared him for the Church, but who, like poor
Goldsmith, did not think himself good enough for it, a mistake of
over-modesty, for he matured into a very harmless creature.
"Gilbert Ashleigh? I was at Oxford with him,&mdash;a gentleman
commoner of Christ Church. Good-looking man, very;
sapped&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sapped! what's that?&mdash;Oh, studied. That he did all his
life. He married young,&mdash;Anne Chaloner; she and I were girls
together; married the same year. They settled at Kirby
Hall&mdash;nice place, but dull. Poyntz and I spent a Christmas
there. Ashleigh when he talked was charming, but he talked very
little. Anne, when she talked, was commonplace, and she talked very
much. Naturally, poor thing,&mdash;-she was so happy. Poyntz and I
did not spend another Christmas there. Friendship is long, but life
is short. Gilbert Ashleigh's life was short indeed; he died in the
seventh year of his marriage, leaving only one child, a girl. Since
then, though I never spent another Christmas at Kirby Hall, I have
frequently spent a day there, doing my best to cheer up Anne. She
was no longer talkative, poor dear. Wrapped up in her child, who
has now grown into a beautiful girl of eighteen&mdash;such eyes,
her father's&mdash;the real dark blue&mdash;rare; sweet creature,
but delicate; not, I hope, consumptive, but delicate; quiet, wants
life. My girl Jane adores her. Jane has life enough for two."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Ashleigh the heiress to Kirby Hall?" asked Mrs. Bruce,
who had an unmarried son.</p>

<p>"No. Kirby Hall passed to Ashleigh Sumner, the male heir, a
cousin. And the luckiest of cousins! Gilbert's sister, showy woman
(indeed all show), had contrived to marry her kinsman, Sir Walter
Ashleigh Haughton, the head of the Ashleigh family,&mdash;just the
man made to be the reflector of a showy woman! He died years ago,
leaving an only son, Sir James, who was killed last winter, by a
fall from his horse. And here, again, Ashleigh Summer proved to be
the male heir-at-law. During the minority of this fortunate youth,
Mrs. Ashleigh had rented Kirby Hall of his guardian. He is now just
coming of age, and that is why she leaves. Lilian Ashleigh will
have, however, a very good fortune,&mdash;is what we genteel
paupers call an heiress. Is there anything more you want to
know?"</p>

<p>Said thin Miss Brabazon, who took advantage of her thinness to
wedge herself into every one's affairs, "A most interesting
account. What a nice place Abbots' House could be made with a
little taste! So aristocratic! Just what I should like if I could
afford it! The drawing-room should be done up in the Moorish style,
with geranium-coloured silk curtains, like dear Lady
L&mdash;&mdash;'s boudoir at Twickenham. And Mrs. Ashleigh has
taken the house on lease too, I suppose!" Here Miss Brabazon
fluttered her fan angrily, and then exclaimed, "But what on earth
brings Mrs. Ashleigh here?"</p>

<p>Answered Mrs. Colonel Poyntz, with the military frankness by
which she kept her company in good humour, as well as
awe,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why do any of us come here? Can any one tell me?"</p>

<p>There was a blank silence, which the hostess herself was the
first to break.</p>

<p>"None of us present can say why we came here. I can tell you why
Mrs. Ashleigh came. Our neighbour, Mr. Vigors, is a distant
connection of the late Gilbert Ashleigh, one of the executors to
his will, and the guardian to the heir-at-law. About ten days ago
Mr. Vigors called on me, for the first time since I felt it my duty
to express my disapprobation of the strange vagaries so unhappily
conceived by our poor dear friend Dr. Lloyd. And when he had taken
his chair, just where you now sit, Dr. Fenwick, he said in a
sepulchral voice, stretching out two fingers, so,&mdash;as if I
were one of the what-do-you-call-'ems who go to sleep when he bids
them, 'Marm, you know Mrs. Ashleigh? You correspond with her?'
'Yes, Mr. Vigors; is there any crime in that? You look as if there
were.' 'No crime, marm,' said the man, quite seriously. 'Mrs.
Ashleigh is a lady of amiable temper, and you are a woman of
masculine understanding.'"</p>

<p>Here there was a general titter. Mrs. Colonel Poyntz hushed it
with a look of severe surprise. "What is there to laugh at? All
women would be men if they could. If my understanding is masculine,
so much the better for me. I thanked Mr. Vigors for his very
handsome compliment, and he then went on to say that though Mrs.
Ashleigh would now have to leave Kirby Hall in a very few weeks,
she seemed quite unable to make up her mind where to go; that it
had occurred to him that, as Miss Ashleigh was of an age to see a
little of the world, she ought not to remain buried in the country;
while, being of quiet mind, she recoiled from the dissipation of
London. Between the seclusion of the one and the turmoil of the
other, the society of L&mdash;&mdash; was a happy medium. He should
be glad of my opinion. He had put off asking for it, because he
owned his belief that I had behaved unkindly to his lamented
friend, Dr. Lloyd; but he now found himself in rather an awkward
position. His ward, young Sumner, had prudently resolved on fixing
his country residence at Kirby Hall, rather than at Haughton Park,
the much larger seat which had so suddenly passed to his
inheritance, and which he could not occupy without a vast
establishment, that to a single man, so young, would be but a
cumbersome and costly trouble. Mr. Vigors was pledged to his ward
to obtain him possession of Kirby Hall, the precise day agreed
upon, but Mrs. Ashleigh did not seem disposed to stir,&mdash;could
not decide where else to go. Mr. Vigors was loth to press hard on
his old friend's widow and child. It was a thousand pities Mrs
Ashleigh could not make up her mind; she had had ample time for
preparation. A word from me at this moment would be an effective
kindness. Abbots' House was vacant, with a garden so extensive that
the ladies would not miss the country. Another party was after it,
but&mdash;'Say no more,' I cried; 'no party but my dear old friend
Anne Ashleigh shall have Abbots' House. So that question is
settled.' I dismissed Mr. Vigors, sent for my carriage, that is,
for Mr. Barker's yellow fly and his best horses,&mdash;and drove
that very day to Kirby Hall, which, though not in this county, is
only twenty-five miles distant. I slept there that night. By nine
o'clock the next morning I had secured Mrs. Ashleigh's consent, on
the promise to save her all trouble; came back, sent for the
landlord, settled the rent, lease, agreement; engaged Forbes' vans
to remove the furniture from Kirby Hall; told Forbes to begin with
the beds. When her own bed came, which was last night, Anne
Ashleigh came too. I have seen her this morning. She likes the
place, so does Lilian. I asked them to meet you all here to-night;
but Mrs. Ashleigh was tired. The last of the furniture was to
arrive today; and though dear Mrs. Ashleigh is an undecided
character, she is not inactive. But it is not only the planning
where to put tables and chairs that would have tried her today: she
has had Mr. Vigors on her hands all the afternoon, and he has
been&mdash;here's her little note&mdash;what are the words? No
doubt 'most overpowering and oppressive;' no, 'most kind and
attentive,'&mdash;different words, but, as applied to Mr. Vigors,
they mean the same thing.</p>

<p>"And now, next Monday&mdash;-we must leave them in peace till
then&mdash;you will all call on the Ashleighs. The Hill knows what
is due to itself; it cannot delegate to Mr. Vigors, a respectable
man indeed, but who does not belong to its set, its own proper
course of action towards those who would shelter themselves on its
bosom. The Hill cannot be kind and attentive, overpowering or
oppressive by proxy. To those newborn into its family circle it
cannot be an indifferent godmother; it has towards them all the
feelings of a mother,&mdash;or of a stepmother, as the case may be.
Where it says 'This can be no child of mine,' it is a stepmother
indeed; but in all those whom I have presented to its arms, it has
hitherto, I am proud to say, recognized desirable acquaintances,
and to them the Hill has been a mother. And now, my dear Mr.
Sloman, go to your rubber; Poyntz is impatient, though he don't
show it. Miss Brabazon, love, we all long to see you seated at the
piano,&mdash;you play so divinely! Something gay, if you please;
something gay, but not very noisy,&mdash;Mr. Leopold Symthe will
turn the leaves for you. Mrs. Bruce, your own favourite set at
vingt-un, with four new recruits. Dr. Fenwick, you are like me,
don't play cards, and don't care for music; sit here, and talk or
not, as you please, while I knit."</p>

<p>The other guests thus disposed of, some at the card-tables, some
round the piano, I placed myself at Mrs. Poyntz's side, on a seat
niched in the recess of a window which an evening unusually warm
for the month of May permitted to be left open. I was next to one
who had known Lilian as a child, one from whom I had learned by
what sweet name to call the image which my thoughts had already
shrined. How much that I still longed to know she could tell me!
But in what form of question could I lead to the subject, yet not
betray my absorbing interest in it? Longing to speak, I felt as if
stricken dumb; stealing an unquiet glance towards the face beside
me, and deeply impressed with that truth which the Hill had long
ago reverently acknowledged,&mdash;namely, that Mrs. Colonel Poyntz
was a very superior woman, a very powerful creature.</p>

<p>And there she sat knitting, rapidly, firmly; a woman somewhat on
the other side of forty, complexion a bronze paleness, hair a
bronze brown, in strong ringlets cropped short
behind,&mdash;handsome hair for a man; lips that, when closed,
showed inflexible decision, when speaking, became supple and
flexible with an easy humour and a vigilant finesse; eyes of a red
hazel, quick but steady,&mdash;observing, piercing, dauntless eyes;
altogether a fine countenance,&mdash;would have been a very fine
countenance in a man; profile sharp, straight, clear-cut, with an
expression, when in repose, like that of a sphinx; a frame robust,
not corpulent; of middle height, but with an air and carriage that
made her appear tall; peculiarly white firm hands, indicative of
vigorous health, not a vein visible on the surface.</p>

<p>There she sat knitting, knitting, and I by her side, gazing now
on herself, now on her work, with a vague idea that the threads in
the skein of my own web of love or of life were passing quick
through those noiseless fingers. And, indeed, in every web of
romance, the fondest, one of the Parcae is sure to be some
matter-of-fact She, Social Destiny, as little akin to romance
herself as was this worldly Queen of the Hill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>I have given a sketch of the outward woman of Mrs. Colonel
Poyntz. The inner woman was a recondite mystery deep as that of the
sphinx, whose features her own resembled. But between the outward
and the inward woman there is ever a third woman,&mdash;the
conventional woman,&mdash;such as the whole human being appears to
the world,&mdash;always mantled, sometimes masked.</p>

<p>I am told that the fine people of London do not recognize the
title of "Mrs. Colonel." If that be true, the fine people of London
must be clearly in the wrong, for no people in the universe could
be finer than the fine people of Abbey Hill; and they considered
their sovereign had as good a right to the title of Mrs. Colonel as
the Queen of England has to that of "our Gracious Lady." But Mrs.
Poyntz herself never assumed the title of Mrs. Colonel; it never
appeared on her cards,&mdash;any more than the title of "Gracious
Lady" appears on the cards which convey the invitation that a Lord
Steward or Lord Chamberlain is commanded by her Majesty to issue.
To titles, indeed, Mrs. Poyntz evinced no superstitious reverence.
Two peeresses, related to her, not distantly, were in the habit of
paying her a yearly visit which lasted two or three days. The Hill
considered these visits an honour to its eminence. Mrs. Poyntz
never seemed to esteem them an honour to herself; never boasted of
them; never sought to show off her grand relations, nor put herself
the least out of the way to receive them. Her mode of life was free
from ostentation. She had the advantage of being a few hundreds a
year richer than any other inhabitant of the Hill; but she did not
devote her superior resources to the invidious exhibition of
superior splendour. Like a wise sovereign, the revenues of her
exchequer were applied to the benefit of her subjects, and not to
the vanity of egotistical parade. As no one else on the Hill kept a
carriage, she declined to keep one. Her entertainments were simple,
but numerous. Twice a week she received the Hill, and was genuinely
at home to it. She contrived to make her parties proverbially
agreeable. The refreshments were of the same kind as those which
the poorest of her old maids of honour might proffer; but they were
better of their kind, the best of their kind,&mdash;the best tea,
the best lemonade, the best cakes. Her rooms had an air of comfort,
which was peculiar to them. They looked like rooms accustomed to
receive, and receive in a friendly way; well warmed, well lighted,
card-tables and piano each in the place that made cards and music
inviting; on the walls a few old family portraits, and three or
four other pictures said to be valuable and certainly
pleasing,&mdash;two Watteaus, a Canaletti, a Weenix; plenty of
easy-chairs and settees covered with a cheerful chintz,&mdash;in
the arrangement of the furniture generally an indescribable
careless elegance. She herself was studiously plain in dress, more
conspicuously free from jewelry and trinkets than any married lady
on the Hill. But I have heard from those who were authorities on
such a subject that she was never seen in a dress of the last
year's fashion. She adopted the mode as it came out, just enough to
show that she was aware it was out; but with a sober reserve, as
much as to say, "I adopt the fashion as far as it suits myself; I
do not permit the fashion to adopt me." In short, Mrs. Colonel
Poyntz was sometimes rough, sometimes coarse, always masculine, and
yet somehow or other masculine in a womanly way; but she was never
vulgar because never affected. It was impossible not to allow that
she was a thorough gentlewoman, and she could do things that lower
other gentlewomen, without any loss of dignity. Thus she was an
admirable mimic, certainly in itself the least ladylike
condescension of humour. But when she mimicked, it was with so
tranquil a gravity, or so royal a good humour, that one could only
say, "What talents for society dear Mrs. Colonel has!" As she was a
gentlewoman emphatically, so the other colonel, the he-colonel, was
emphatically a gentleman; rather shy, but not cold; hating trouble
of every kind, pleased to seem a cipher in his own house. If the
sole study of Mrs. Colonel had been to make her husband
comfortable, she could not have succeeded better than by bringing
friends about him and then taking them off his hands. Colonel
Poyntz, the he-colonel, had seen, in his youth, actual service; but
had retired from his profession many years ago, shortly after his
marriage. He was a younger brother of one of the principal squires
in the country; inherited the house he lived in, with some other
valuable property in and about L&mdash;&mdash;, from an uncle; was
considered a good landlord; and popular in Low Town, though he
never interfered in its affairs. He was punctiliously neat in his
dress; a thin youthful figure, crowned with a thick youthful wig.
He never seemed to read anything but the newspapers and the
"Meteorological Journal:" was supposed to be the most weatherwise
man in all L&mdash;&mdash;. He had another intellectual
predilection,&mdash;whist; but in that he had less reputation for
wisdom. Perhaps it requires a rarer combination of mental faculties
to win an odd trick than to divine a fall in the glass. For the
rest, the he-colonel, many years older than his wife, despite the
thin youthful figure, was an admirable aid-de-camp to the general
in command, Mrs. Colonel; and she could not have found one more
obedient, more devoted, or more proud of a distinguished chief.</p>

<p>In giving to Mrs. Colonel Poyntz the appellation of Queen of the
Hill, let there be no mistake. She was not a constitutional
sovereign; her monarchy was absolute. All her proclamations had the
force of laws.</p>

<p>Such ascendancy could not have been attained without
considerable talents for acquiring and keeping it. Amidst all her
off-hand, brisk, imperious frankness, she had the ineffable
discrimination of tact. Whether civil or rude, she was never civil
or rude but what she carried public opinion along with her. Her
knowledge of general society must have been limited, as must be
that of all female sovereigns; but she seemed gifted with an
intuitive knowledge of human nature, which she applied to her
special ambition of ruling it. I have not a doubt that if she had
been suddenly transferred, a perfect stranger, to the world of
London, she would have soon forced her way to its selectest
circles, and, when once there, held her own against a duchess.</p>

<p>I have said that she was not affected: this might be one cause
of her sway over a set in which nearly every other woman was trying
rather to seem, than to be, a somebody.</p>

<p>But if Mrs. Colonel Poyntz was not artificial, she was artful,
or perhaps I might more justly say artistic. In all she said and
did there were conduct, system, plan. She could be a most
serviceable friend, a most damaging enemy; yet I believe she seldom
indulged in strong likings or strong hatreds. All was
policy,&mdash;a policy akin to that of a grand party chief,
determined to raise up those whom, for any reason of state, it was
prudent to favour, and to put down those whom, for any reason of
state, it was expedient to humble or to crush.</p>

<p>Ever since the controversy with Dr. Lloyd, this lady had
honoured me with her benignest countenance; and nothing could be
more adroit than the manner in which, while imposing me on others
as an oracular authority, she sought to subject to her will the
oracle itself.</p>

<p>She was in the habit of addressing me in a sort of motherly way,
as if she had the deepest interest in my welfare, happiness, and
reputation. And thus, in every compliment, in every seeming mark of
respect, she maintained the superior dignity of one who takes from
responsible station the duty to encourage rising merit; so that,
somehow or other, despite all that pride which made me believe that
I needed no helping hand to advance or to clear my way through the
world, I could not shake off from my mind the impression that I was
mysteriously patronized by Mrs. Colonel Poyntz.</p>

<p>We might have sat together five minutes, side by side in silence
as complete as if in the cave of Trophonius&mdash;when without
looking up from her work, Mrs. Poyntz said abruptly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am thinking about you, Dr. Fenwick. And you&mdash;are
thinking about some other woman. Ungrateful man!"</p>

<p>"Unjust accusation! My very silence should prove how intently my
thoughts were fixed on you, and on the weird web which springs
under your hand in meshes that bewilder the gaze and snare the
attention."</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz looked up at me for a moment&mdash;one rapid glance
of the bright red hazel eye&mdash;and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was I really in your thoughts? Answer truly."</p>

<p>"Truly, I answer, you were."</p>

<p>"That is strange! Who can it be?"</p>

<p>"Who can it be? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"If you were thinking of me, it was in connection with some
other person,&mdash;some other person of my own sex. It is
certainly not poor dear Miss Brabazon. Who else can it be?"</p>

<p>Again the red eye shot over me, and I felt my cheek redden
beneath it.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, lowering her voice; "you are in love!"</p>

<p>"In love!&mdash;I! Permit me to ask you why you think so?"</p>

<p>"The signs are unmistakable; you are altered in your manner,
even in the expression of your face, since I last saw you; your
manner is generally quiet and observant,&mdash;it is now restless
and distracted; your expression of face is generally proud and
serene,&mdash;it is now humbled and troubled. You have something on
your mind! It is not anxiety for your reputation,&mdash;that is
established; nor for your fortune,&mdash;that is made; it is not
anxiety for a patient or you would scarcely be here. But anxiety it
is,&mdash;an anxiety that is remote from your profession, that
touches your heart and is new to it!"</p>

<p>I was startled, almost awed; but I tried to cover my confusion
with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>"Profound observer! Subtle analyst! You have convinced me that I
must be in love, though I did not suspect it before. But when I
strive to conjecture the object, I am as much perplexed as
yourself; and with you, I ask, who can it be?"</p>

<p>"Whoever it be," said Mrs. Poyntz, who had paused, while I
spoke, from her knitting, and now resumed it very slowly and very
carefully, as if her mind and her knitting worked in unison
together,&mdash;"whoever it be, love in you would be serious; and,
with or without love, marriage is a serious thing to us all. It is
not every pretty girl that would suit Allen Fenwick."</p>

<p>"Alas! is there any pretty girl whom Allen Fenwick would
suit?"</p>

<p>"Tut! You should be above the fretful vanity that lays traps for
a compliment. Yes; the time has come in your life and your career
when you would do well to marry. I give my consent to that," she
added with a smile as if in jest, and a slight nod as if in
earnest. The knitting here went on more decidedly, more quickly.
"But I do not yet see the person. No! 'T is a pity, Allen Fenwick"
(whenever Mrs. Poyntz called me by my Christian name, she always
assumed her majestic motherly manner),&mdash;"a pity that, with
your birth, energies, perseverance, talents, and, let me add, your
advantages of manner and person,&mdash;a pity that you did not
choose a career that might achieve higher fortunes and louder fame
than the most brilliant success can give to a provincial physician.
But in that very choice you interest me. My choice has been much
the same,&mdash;a small circle, but the first in it. Yet, had I
been a man, or had my dear Colonel been a man whom it was in the
power of a woman's art to raise one step higher in that
metaphorical ladder which is not the ladder of the angels, why,
then&mdash;what then? No matter! I am contented. I transfer my
ambition to Jane. Do you not think her handsome?"</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of that," said I, carelessly and
naturally.</p>

<p>"I have settled Jane's lot in my own mind," resumed Mrs. Poyntz,
striking firm into another row of knitting. "She will marry a
country gentleman of large estate. He will go into parliament. She
will study his advancement as I study Poyntz's comfort. If he be
clever, she will help to make him a minister; if he be not clever,
his wealth will make her a personage, and lift him into a
personage's husband. And, now that you see I have no matrimonial
designs on you, Allen Fenwick, think if it will be worth while to
confide in me. Possibly I may be useful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know not how to thank you; but, as yet, I have nothing to
confide."</p>

<p>While thus saying, I turned my eyes towards the open window
beside which I sat. It was a beautiful soft night, the May moon in
all her splendour. The town stretched, far and wide, below with all
its numberless lights,&mdash;below, but somewhat distant; an
intervening space was covered, here, by the broad quadrangle (in
the midst of which stood, massive and lonely, the grand old
church), and, there, by the gardens and scattered cottages or
mansions that clothed the sides of the hill.</p>

<p>"Is not that house," I said, after a short pause, "yonder with
the three gables, the one in which&mdash;in which poor Dr. Lloyd
lived&mdash;Abbots' House?"</p>

<p>I spoke abruptly, as if to intimate my desire to change the
subject of conversation. My hostess stopped her knitting, half
rose, looked forth.</p>

<p>"Yes. But what a lovely night! How is it that the moon blends
into harmony things of which the sun only marks the contrast? That
stately old church tower, gray with its thousand years, those
vulgar tile-roofs and chimney-pots raw in the freshness of
yesterday,&mdash;now, under the moonlight, all melt into one
indivisible charm!"</p>

<p>As my hostess thus spoke, she had left her seat, taking her work
with her, and passed from the window into the balcony. It was not
often that Mrs. Poyntz condescended to admit what is called
"sentiment" into the range of her sharp, practical, worldly talk;
but she did so at times,&mdash;always, when she did, giving me the
notion of an intellect much too comprehensive not to allow that
sentiment has a place in this life, but keeping it in its proper
place, by that mixture of affability and indifference with which
some high-born beauty allows the genius, but checks the
presumption, of a charming and penniless poet. For a few minutes
her eyes roved over the scene in evident enjoyment; then, as they
slowly settled upon the three gables of Abbots' House, her face
regained that something of hardness which belonged to its decided
character; her fingers again mechanically resumed her knitting, and
she said, in her clear, unsoftened, metallic chime of voice, "Can
you guess why I took so much trouble to oblige Mr. Vigors and
locate Mrs. Ashleigh yonder?"</p>

<p>"You favoured us with a full explanation of your reasons."</p>

<p>"Some of my reasons; not the main one. People who undertake the
task of governing others, as I do, be their rule a kingdom or a
hamlet, must adopt a principle of government and adhere to it. The
principle that suits best with the Hill is Respect for the
Proprieties. We have not much money; entre nous, we have no great
rank. Our policy is, then, to set up the Proprieties as an
influence which money must court and rank is afraid of. I had
learned just before Mr. Vigors called on me that Lady Sarah
Bellasis entertained the idea of hiring Abbots' House. London has
set its face against her; a provincial town would be more
charitable. An earl's daughter, with a good income and an awfully
bad name, of the best manners and of the worst morals, would have
made sad havoc among the Proprieties. How many of our primmest old
maids would have deserted tea and Mrs. Poyntz for champagne and her
ladyship! The Hill was never in so imminent a danger. Rather than
Lady Sarah Bellasis should have had that house, I would have taken
it myself, and stocked it with owls.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashleigh turned up just in the critical moment. Lady Sarah
is foiled, the Proprieties safe, and so that question is
settled."</p>

<p>"And it will be pleasant to have your early friend so near
you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz lifted her eyes full upon me.</p>

<p>"Do you know Mrs. Ashleigh?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"She has many virtues and few ideas. She is commonplace weak, as
I am commonplace strong. But commonplace weak can be very lovable.
Her husband, a man of genius and learning, gave her his whole
heart,&mdash;a heart worth having; but he was not ambitious, and he
despised the world."</p>

<p>"I think you said your daughter was very much attached to Miss
Ashleigh? Does her character resemble her mother's?"</p>

<p>I was afraid while I spoke that I should again meet Mrs.
Poyntz's searching gaze, but she did not this time look up from her
work.</p>

<p>"No; Lilian is anything but commonplace."</p>

<p>"You described her as having delicate health; you implied a hope
that she was not consumptive. I trust that there is no serious
reason for apprehending a constitutional tendency which at her age
would require the most careful watching!"</p>

<p>"I trust not. If she were to die&mdash;Dr. Fenwick, what is the
matter?"</p>

<p>So terrible had been the picture which this woman's words had
brought before me, that I started as if my own life had received a
shock.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," I said falteringly, pressing my hand to my
heart; "a sudden spasm here,&mdash;it is over now. You were saying
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was about to say-" and here Mrs. Poyntz laid her hand lightly
on mine,&mdash;"I was about to say that if Lilian Ashleigh were to
die, I should mourn for her less than I might for one who valued
the things of the earth more. But I believe there is no cause for
the alarm my words so inconsiderately excited in you. Her mother is
watchful and devoted; and if the least thing ailed Lilian, she
would call in medical advice. Mr. Vigors would, I know, recommend
Dr. Jones."</p>

<p>Closing our conference with those stinging words, Mrs. Poyntz
here turned back into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>I remained some minutes on the balcony, disconcerted, enraged.
With what consummate art had this practised diplomatist wound
herself into my secret! That she had read my heart better than
myself was evident from that Parthian shaft, barbed with Dr. Jones,
which she had shot over her shoulder in retreat. That from the
first moment in which she had decoyed me to her side, she had
detected "the something" on my mind, was perhaps but the ordinary
quickness of female penetration. But it was with no ordinary craft
that the whole conversation afterwards had been so shaped as to
learn the something, and lead me to reveal the some one to whom the
something was linked. For what purpose? What was it to her? What
motive could she have beyond the mere gratification of curiosity?
Perhaps, at first, she thought I had been caught by her daughter's
showy beauty, and hence the half-friendly, half-cynical frankness
with which she had avowed her ambitious projects for that young
lady's matrimonial advancement. Satisfied by my manner that I
cherished no presumptuous hopes in that quarter, her scrutiny was
doubtless continued from that pleasure in the exercise of a wily
intellect which impels schemers and politicians to an activity for
which, without that pleasure itself, there would seem no adequate
inducement. And besides, the ruling passion of this petty sovereign
was power; and if knowledge be power, there is no better instrument
of power over a contumacious subject than that hold on his heart
which is gained in the knowledge of its secret.</p>

<p>But "secret"! Had it really come to this? Was it possible that
the mere sight of a human face, never beheld before, could disturb
the whole tenor of my life,&mdash;a stranger of whose mind and
character I knew nothing, whose very voice I had never heard? It
was only by the intolerable pang of anguish that had rent my heart
in the words, carelessly, abruptly spoken, "if she were to die,"
that I had felt how the world would be changed to me, if indeed
that face were seen in it no more! Yes, secret it was no longer to
myself, I loved! And like all on whom love descends, sometimes
softly, slowly, with the gradual wing of the cushat settling down
into its nest, sometimes with the swoop of the eagle on his
unsuspecting quarry, I believed that none ever before loved as I
loved; that such love was an abnormal wonder, made solely for me,
and I for it. Then my mind insensibly hushed its angrier and more
turbulent thoughts, as my gaze rested upon the roof-tops of
Lilian's home, and the shimmering silver of the moonlit willow,
under which I had seen her gazing into the roseate heavens.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>When I returned to the drawing-room, the party was evidently
about to break up. Those who had grouped round the piano were now
assembled round the refreshment-table. The cardplayers had risen,
and were settling or discussing gains and losses. While I was
searching for my hat, which I had somewhere mislaid, a poor
gentleman, tormented by tic-doloureux, crept timidly up to
me,&mdash;the proudest and the poorest of all the hidalgos settled
on the Hill. He could not afford a fee for a physician's advice;
but pain had humbled his pride, and I saw at a glance that he was
considering how to take a surreptitious advantage of social
intercourse, and obtain the advice without paying the fee. The old
man discovered the hat before I did, stooped, took it up, extended
it to me with the profound bow of the old school, while the other
hand, clenched and quivering, was pressed into the hollow of his
cheek, and his eyes met mine with wistful mute entreaty. The
instinct of my profession seized me at once. I could never behold
suffering without forgetting all else in the desire to relieve
it.</p>

<p>"You are in pain," said I, softly. "Sit down and describe the
symptoms. Here, it is true, I am no professional doctor, but I am a
friend who is fond of doctoring, and knows something about it."</p>

<p>So we sat down a little apart from the other guests, and after a
few questions and answers, I was pleased to find that his "tic" did
not belong to the less curable kind of that agonizing neuralgia. I
was especially successful in my treatment of similar sufferings,
for which I had discovered an anodyne that was almost specific. I
wrote on a leaf of my pocketbook a prescription which I felt sure
would be efficacious, and as I tore it out and placed it in his
hand, I chanced to look up, and saw the hazel eyes of my hostess
fixed upon me with a kinder and softer expression than they often
condescended to admit into their cold and penetrating lustre. At
that moment, however, her attention was drawn from me to a servant,
who entered with a note, and I heard him say, though in an
undertone, "From Mrs. Ashleigh."</p>

<p>She opened the note, read it hastily, ordered the servant to
wait without the door, retired to her writing-table, which stood
near the place at which I still lingered, rested her face on her
hand, and seemed musing. Her meditation was very soon over. She
turned her head, and to my surprise, beckoned to me. I
approached.</p>

<p>"Sit here," she whispered: "turn your back towards those people,
who are no doubt watching us. Read this."</p>

<p>She placed in my hand the note she had just received. It
contained but a few words, to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   DEAR MARGARET,&mdash;I am so distressed.  Since I wrote to you a few
   hours ago, Lilian is taken suddenly ill, and I fear seriously.  What
   medical man should I send for?  Let my servant have his name and
   address.

                                                    A.  A.
</pre>

<p>I sprang from my seat.</p>

<p>"Stay," said Mrs. Poyntz. "Would you much care if I sent the
servant to Dr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"Ah, madam, you are cruel! What have I done that you should
become my enemy?"</p>

<p>"Enemy! No. You have just befriended one of my friends. In this
world of fools intellect should ally itself with intellect. No; I
am not your enemy! But you have not yet asked me to be your
friend."</p>

<p>Here she put into my hands a note she had written while thus
speaking. "Receive your credentials. If there be any cause for
alarm, or if I can be of use, send for me." Resuming the work she
had suspended, but with lingering, uncertain fingers, she added,
"So far, then, this is settled. Nay, no thanks; it is but little
that is settled as yet."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>In a very few minutes I was once more in the grounds of that old
gable house; the servant, who went before me, entered them by the
stairs and the wicket-gate of the private entrance; that way was
the shortest. So again I passed by the circling glade and the
monastic well,&mdash;sward, trees, and ruins all suffused in the
limpid moonlight.</p>

<p>And now I was in the house; the servant took up-stairs the note
with which I was charged, and a minute or two afterwards returned
and conducted me to the corridor above, in which Mrs. Ashleigh
received me. I was the first to speak.</p>

<p>"Your daughter&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;not seriously ill, I
hope. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she said, under her breath. "Will you step this way for
a moment?" She passed through a doorway to the right. I followed
her, and as she placed on the table the light she had been holding,
I looked round with a chill at the heart,&mdash;it was the room in
which Dr. Lloyd had died. Impossible to mistake. The furniture
indeed was changed, there was no bed in the chamber; but the shape
of the room, the position of the high casement, which was now wide
open, and through which the moonlight streamed more softly than on
that drear winter night, the great square beams intersecting the
low ceiling,&mdash;all were impressed vividly on my memory. The
chair to which Mrs. Ashleigh beckoned me was placed just on the
spot where I had stood by the bedhead of the dying man.</p>

<p>I shrank back,&mdash;I could not have seated myself there. So I
remained leaning against the chimney-piece, while Mrs. Ashleigh
told her story.</p>

<p>She said that on their arrival the day before, Lilian had been
in more than usually good health and spirits, delighted with the
old house, the grounds, and especially the nook by the Monk's Well,
at which Mrs. Ashleigh had left her that evening in order to make
some purchases in the town, in company with Mr. Vigors. When Mrs.
Ashleigh returned, she and Mr. Vigors had sought Lilian in that
nook, and Mrs. Ashleigh then detected, with a mother's eye, some
change in Lilian which alarmed her. She seemed listless and
dejected, and was very pale; but she denied that she felt unwell.
On regaining the house she had sat down in the room in which we
then were,&mdash;"which," said Mrs. Ashleigh, "as it is not
required for a sleeping-room, my daughter, who is fond of reading,
wished to fit up as her own morning-room, or study. I left her here
and went into the drawing-room below with Mr. Vigors. When he
quitted me, which he did very soon, I remained for nearly an hour
giving directions about the placing of furniture, which had just
arrived, from our late residence. I then went up-stairs to join my
daughter, and to my terror found her apparently lifeless in her
chair. She had fainted away."</p>

<p>I interrupted Mrs. Ashleigh here. "Has Miss Ashleigh been
subject to fainting fits?"</p>

<p>"No, never. When she recovered she seemed bewildered,
disinclined to speak. I got her to bed, and as she then fell
quietly to sleep, my mind was relieved. I thought it only a passing
effect of excitement, in a change of abode; or caused by something
like malaria in the atmosphere of that part of the grounds in which
I had found her seated."</p>

<p>"Very likely. The hour of sunset at this time of year is trying
to delicate constitutions. Go on."</p>

<p>"About three quarters of an hour ago she woke up with a loud
cry, and has been ever since in a state of great agitation, weeping
violently, and answering none of my questions. Yet she does not
seem light-headed, but rather what we call hysterical."</p>

<p>"You will permit me now to see her. Take comfort; in all you
tell me I see nothing to warrant serious alarm."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>To the true physician there is an inexpressible sanctity in the
sick chamber. At its threshold the more human passions quit their
hold on his heart. Love there would be profanation; even the grief
permitted to others he must put aside. He must enter that
room&mdash;a calm intelligence. He is disabled for his mission if
he suffer aught to obscure the keen quiet glance of his science.
Age or youth, beauty or deformity, innocence or guilt, merge their
distinctions in one common attribute&mdash;human suffering
appealing to human skill.</p>

<p>Woe to the households in which the trusted Healer feels not on
his conscience the solemn obligations of his glorious art!
Reverently as in a temple, I stood in the virgin's chamber. When
her mother placed her hand in mine, and I felt the throb of its
pulse, I was aware of no quicker beat of my own heart. I looked
with a steady eye on the face more beautiful from the flush that
deepened the delicate hues of the young cheek, and the lustre that
brightened the dark blue of the wandering eyes. She did not at
first heed me, did not seem aware of my presence; but kept
murmuring to herself words which I could not distinguish.</p>

<p>At length, when I spoke to her, in that low, soothing tone which
we learn at the sick-bed, the expression of her face altered
suddenly; she passed the hand I did not hold over her forehead,
turned round, looked at me full and long, with unmistakable
surprise, yet not as if the surprise displeased her,&mdash;less the
surprise which recoils from the sight of a stranger than that which
seems doubtfully to recognize an unexpected friend. Yet on the
surprise there seemed to creep something of apprehension, of fear;
her hand trembled, her voice quivered, as she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Can it be, can it be? Am I awake? Mother, who is this?"</p>

<p>"Only a kind visitor, Dr. Fenwick, sent by Mrs. Poyntz, for I
was uneasy about you, darling. How are you now?"</p>

<p>"Better. Strangely better."</p>

<p>She removed her hand gently from mine, and with an involuntary
modest shrinking turned towards Mrs. Ashleigh, drawing her mother
towards herself, so that she became at once hidden from me.</p>

<p>Satisfied that there was here no delirium, nor even more than
the slight and temporary fever which often accompanies a sudden
nervous attack in constitutions peculiarly sensitive, I retired
noiselessly from the room, and went, not into that which had been
occupied by the ill-fated Naturalist, but down-stairs into the
drawing-room, to write my prescription. I had already sent the
servant off with it to the chemist's before Mrs. Ashleigh joined
me.</p>

<p>"She seems recovering surprisingly; her forehead is cooler; she
is perfectly self-possessed, only she cannot account for her own
seizure,&mdash;cannot account either for the fainting or the
agitation with which she awoke from sleep."</p>

<p>"I think I can account for both. The first room in which she
entered&mdash;that in which she fainted&mdash;had its window open;
the sides of the window are overgrown with rank creeping plants in
full blossom. Miss Ashleigh had already predisposed herself to
injurious effects from the effluvia by fatigue, excitement,
imprudence in sitting out at the fall of a heavy dew. The sleep
after the fainting fit was the more disturbed, because Nature,
always alert and active in subjects so young, was making its own
effort to right itself from an injury. Nature has nearly succeeded.
What I have prescribed will a little aid and accelerate that which
Nature has yet to do, and in a day or two I do not doubt that your
daughter will be perfectly restored. Only let me recommend care to
avoid exposure to the open air during the close of the day. Let her
avoid also the room in which she was first seized, for it is a
strange phenomenon in nervous temperaments that a nervous attack
may, without visible cause, be repeated in the same place where it
was first experienced. You had better shut up the chamber for at
least some weeks, burn fires in it, repaint and paper it, sprinkle
chloroform. You are not, perhaps, aware that Dr. Lloyd died in that
room after a prolonged illness. Suffer me to wait till your servant
returns with the medicine, and let me employ the interval in asking
you a few questions. Miss Ashleigh, you say, never had a fainting
fit before. I should presume that she is not what we call strong.
But has she ever had any illness that alarmed you?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"No great liability to cold and cough, to attacks of the chest
or lungs?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Still I have feared that she may have a tendency
to consumption. Do you think so? Your questions alarm me!"</p>

<p>"I do not think so; but before I pronounce a positive opinion,
one question more. You say you have feared a tendency to
consumption. Is that disease in her family? She certainly did not
inherit it from you. But on her father's side?"</p>

<p>"Her father," said Mrs. Ashleigh, with tears in her eyes, "died
young, but of brain fever, which the medical men said was brought
on by over study."</p>

<p>"Enough, my dear madam. What you say confirms my belief that
your daughter's constitution is the very opposite to that in which
the seeds of consumption lurk. It is rather that far nobler
constitution, which the keenness of the nervous susceptibility
renders delicate but elastic,&mdash;as quick to recover as it is to
suffer."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, Dr. Fenwick, for what you say. You take a
load from my heart; for Mr. Vigors, I know, thinks Lilian
consumptive, and Mrs. Poyntz has rather frightened me at times by
hints to the same effect. But when you speak of nervous
susceptibility, I do not quite understand you. My daughter is not
what is commonly called nervous. Her temper is singularly
even."</p>

<p>"But if not excitable, should you also say that she is not
impressionable? The things which do not disturb her temper may,
perhaps, deject her spirits. Do I make myself understood?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I understand your distinction; but I am not quite
sure if it applies. To most things that affect the spirits she is
not more sensitive than other girls, perhaps less so; but she is
certainly very impressionable in some things."</p>

<p>"In what?"</p>

<p>"She is more moved than any one I ever knew by objects in
external nature, rural scenery, rural sounds, by music, by the
books that she reads,&mdash;even books that are not works of
imagination. Perhaps in all this she takes after her poor father,
but in a more marked degree,&mdash;at least, I observe it more in
her; for he was very silent and reserved. And perhaps also her
peculiarities have been fostered by the seclusion in which she has
been brought up. It was with a view to make her a little more like
girls of her own age that our friend, Mrs. Poyntz, induced me to
come here. Lilian was reconciled to this change; but she shrank
from the thoughts of London, which I should have preferred. Her
poor father could not endure London."</p>

<p>"Miss Ashleigh is fond of reading?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is fond of reading, but more fond of musing. She will
sit by herself for hours without book or work, and seem as
abstracted as if in a dream. She was so even in her earliest
childhood. Then she would tell me what she had been conjuring up to
herself. She would say that she had seen&mdash;positively
seen&mdash;beautiful lands far away from earth; flowers and trees
not like ours. As she grew older this visionary talk displeased me,
and I scolded her, and said that if others heard her, they would
think that she was not only silly but very untruthful. So of late
years she never ventures to tell me what, in such dreamy moments,
she suffers herself to imagine; but the habit of musing continues
still. Do you not agree with Mrs. Poyntz that the best cure would
be a little cheerful society amongst other young people?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said I, honestly, though with a jealous pang. "But
here comes the medicine. Will you take it up to her, and then sit
with her half an hour or so? By that time I expect she will be
asleep. I will wait here till you return. Oh, I can amuse myself
with the newspapers and books on your table. Stay! one caution: be
sure there are no flowers in Miss Ashleigh's sleeping-room. I think
I saw a treacherous rose-tree in a stand by the window. If so,
banish it."</p>

<p>Left alone, I examined the room in which, oh, thought of joy! I
had surely now won the claim to become a privileged guest. I
touched the books Lilian must have touched; in the articles of
furniture, as yet so hastily disposed that the settled look of home
was not about them, I still knew that I was gazing on things which
her mind must associate with the history of her young life. That
luteharp must be surely hers, and the scarf, with a girl's
favourite colours,&mdash;pure white and pale blue,&mdash;and the
bird-cage, and the childish ivory work-case, with implements too
pretty for use,&mdash;all spoke of her.</p>

<p>It was a blissful, intoxicating revery, which Mrs. Ashleigh's
entrance disturbed.</p>

<p>Lilian was sleeping calmly. I had no excuse to linger there any
longer.</p>

<p>"I leave you, I trust, with your mind quite at ease," said I.
"You will allow me to call to-morrow, in the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, gratefully."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh held out her hand as I made towards the door.</p>

<p>Is there a physician who has not felt at times how that
ceremonious fee throws him back from the garden-land of humanity
into the market-place of money,&mdash;seems to put him out of the
pale of equal friendship, and say, "True, you have given health and
life. Adieu! there, you are paid for it!" With a poor person there
would have been no dilemma, but Mrs. Ashleigh was affluent: to
depart from custom here was almost impertinence. But had the
penalty of my refusal been the doom of never again beholding
Lilian, I could not have taken her mother's gold. So I did not
appear to notice the hand held out to me, and passed by with a
quickened step.</p>

<p>"But, Dr. Fenwick, stop!"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, no! Miss Ashleigh would have recovered as soon
without me. Whenever my aid is really wanted, then&mdash;but Heaven
grant that time may never come! We will talk again about her
to-morrow."</p>

<p>I was gone,&mdash;now in the garden ground, odorous with
blossoms; now in the lane, inclosed by the narrow walls; now in the
deserted streets, over which the moon shone full as in that winter
night when I hurried from the chamber of death. But the streets
were not ghastly now, and the moon was no longer Hecate, that
dreary goddess of awe and spectres, but the sweet, simple Lady of
the Stars, on whose gentle face lovers have gazed ever since (if
that guess of astronomers be true) she was parted from earth to
rule the tides of its deeps from afar, even as love, from love
divided, rules the heart that yearns towards it with mysterious
law.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>With what increased benignity I listened to the patients who
visited me the next morning! The whole human race seemed to be
worthier of love, and I longed to diffuse amongst all some rays of
the glorious hope that had dawned upon my heart. My first call,
when I went forth, was on the poor young woman from whom I had been
returning the day before, when an impulse, which seemed like a
fate, had lured me into the grounds where I had first seen Lilian.
I felt grateful to this poor patient; without her Lilian herself
might be yet unknown to me.</p>

<p>The girl's brother, a young man employed in the police, and
whose pay supported a widowed mother and the suffering sister,
received me at the threshold of the cottage.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, she is so much better to-day; almost free from pain.
Will she live now; can she live?"</p>

<p>"If my treatment has really done the good you say; if she be
really better under it, I think her recovery may be pronounced. But
I must first see her."</p>

<p>The girl was indeed wonderfully better. I felt that my skill was
achieving a signal triumph; but that day even my intellectual pride
was forgotten in the luxurious unfolding of that sense of heart
which had so newly waked into blossom.</p>

<p>As I recrossed the threshold, I smiled on the brother, who was
still lingering there,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your sister is saved, Wady. She needs now chiefly wine, and
good though light nourishment; these you will find at my house;
call there for them every day."</p>

<p>"God bless you, sir! If ever I can serve you&mdash;" His tongue
faltered, he could say no more.</p>

<p>Serve me, Allen Fenwick&mdash;that poor policeman! Me, whom a
king could not serve! What did I ask from earth but Fame and
Lilian's heart? Thrones and bread man wins from the aid of others;
fame and woman's heart he can only gain through himself.</p>

<p>So I strode gayly up the hill, through the iron gates, into the
fairy ground, and stood before Lilian's home.</p>

<p>The man-servant, on opening the door, seemed somewhat confused,
and said hastily before I spoke,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not at home, sir; a note for you."</p>

<p>I turned the note mechanically in my hand; I felt stunned.</p>

<p>"Not at home! Miss Ashleigh cannot be out. How is she?"</p>

<p>"Better, sir, thank you."</p>

<p>I still could not open the note; my eyes turned wistfully
towards the windows of the house, and there&mdash;at the
drawing-room window&mdash;I encountered the scowl of Mr. Vigors. I
coloured with resentment, divined that I was dismissed, and walked
away with a proud crest and a firm step.</p>

<p>When I was out of the gates, in the blind lane, I opened the
note. It began formally. "Mrs. Ashleigh presents her compliments,"
and went on to thank me, civilly enough, for my attendance the
night before, would not give me the trouble to repeat my visit, and
inclosed a fee, double the amount of the fee prescribed by custom.
I flung the money, as an asp that had stung me, over the high wall,
and tore the note into shreds. Having thus idly vented my rage, a
dull gnawing sorrow came heavily down upon all other emotions,
stifling and replacing them. At the mouth of the lane I halted. I
shrank from the thought of the crowded streets beyond; I shrank yet
more from the routine of duties, which stretched before me in the
desert into which daily life was so suddenly smitten. I sat down by
the roadside, shading my dejected face with a nervous hand. I
looked up as the sound of steps reached my ear, and saw Dr. Jones
coming briskly along the lane, evidently from Abbots' House. He
must have been there at the very time I had called. I was not only
dismissed but supplanted. I rose before he reached the spot on
which I had seated myself, and went my way into the town, went
through my allotted round of professional visits; but my attentions
were not so tenderly devoted, my skill so genially quickened by the
glow of benevolence, as my poorer patients had found them in the
morning. I have said how the physician should enter the sick-room.
"A Calm Intelligence!" But if you strike a blow on the heart, the
intellect suffers. Little worth, I suspect, was my "calm
intelligence" that day. Bichat, in his famous book upon Life and
Death, divides life into two classes,&mdash;animal and organic.
Man's intellect, with the brain for its centre, belongs to life
animal; his passions to life organic, centred in the heart, in the
viscera. Alas! if the noblest passions through which alone we lift
ourselves into the moral realm of the sublime and beautiful really
have their centre in the life which the very vegetable, that lives
organically, shares with us! And, alas! if it be that life which we
share with the vegetable, that can cloud, obstruct, suspend, annul
that life centred in the brain, which we share with every being
howsoever angelic, in every star howsoever remote, on whom the
Creator bestows the faculty of thought!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>But suddenly I remembered Mrs. Poyntz. I ought to call on her.
So I closed my round of visits at her door. The day was then far
advanced, and the servant politely informed me that Mrs. Poyntz was
at dinner. I could only leave my card, with a message that I would
pay my respects to her the next day. That evening I received from
her this note:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   Dear Dr. Fenwick,&mdash;I regret much that I cannot have the pleasure of
   seeing you to-morrow.  Poyntz and I are going to visit his brother, at
   the other end of the county, and we start early.  We shall be away some
   days.  Sorry to hear from Mrs. Ashleigh that she has been persuaded by
   Mr. Vigors to consult Dr. Jones about Lilian. Vigors and Jones both
   frighten the poor mother, and insist upon consumptive tendencies.
   Unluckily, you seem to have said there was little the matter.  Some
   doctors train their practice as some preachers fill their churches,&mdash;by
   adroit use of the appeals to terror.  You do not want patients, Dr.
   Jones does.  And, after all, better perhaps as it is.
                           Yours, etc.
                                                 M. Poyntz.
</pre>

<p>To my more selfish grief, anxiety for Lilian was now added. I
had seen many more patients die from being mistreated for
consumption than from consumption itself. And Dr. Jones was a
mercenary, cunning, needy man, with much crafty knowledge of human
foibles, but very little skill in the treatment of human maladies.
My fears were soon confirmed. A few days after I heard from Miss
Brabazon that Miss Ashleigh was seriously ill, kept her room. Mrs.
Ashleigh made this excuse for not immediately returning the visits
which the Hill had showered upon her. Miss Brabazon had seen Dr.
Jones, who had shaken his head, said it was a serious case; but
that time and care (his time and his care!) might effect
wonders.</p>

<p>How stealthily at the dead of the night I would climb the Hill
and look towards the windows of the old sombre house,&mdash;one
window, in which a light burned dim and mournful, the light of a
sick-room,&mdash;of hers!</p>

<p>At length Mrs. Poyntz came back, and I entered her house, having
fully resolved beforehand on the line of policy to be adopted
towards the potentate whom I hoped to secure as an ally. It was
clear that neither disguise nor half-confidence would baffle the
penetration of so keen an intellect, nor propitiate the good will
of so imperious and resolute a temper. Perfect frankness here was
the wisest prudence; and after all, it was most agreeable to my own
nature, and most worthy of my own honour.</p>

<p>Luckily, I found Mrs. Poyntz alone, and taking in both mine the
hand she somewhat coldly extended to me, I said, with the
earnestness of suppressed emotion,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You observed when I last saw you, that I had not yet asked you
to be my friend. I ask it now. Listen to me with all the indulgence
you can vouchsafe, and let me at least profit by your counsel if
you refuse to give me your aid."</p>

<p>Rapidly, briefly, I went on to say how I had first seen Lilian,
and how sudden, how strange to myself, had been the impression
which that first sight of her had produced.</p>

<p>"You remarked the change that had come over me," said I; "you
divined the cause before I divined it myself,&mdash;divined it as I
sat there beside you, thinking that through you I might see, in the
freedom of social intercourse, the face that was then haunting me.
You know what has since passed. Miss Ashleigh is ill; her case is,
I am convinced, wholly misunderstood. All other feelings are merged
in one sense of anxiety,&mdash;of alarm. But it has become due to
me, due to all, to incur the risk of your ridicule even more than
of your reproof, by stating to you thus candidly, plainly, bluntly,
the sentiment which renders alarm so poignant, and which, if
scarcely admissible to the romance of some wild dreamy boy, may
seem an unpardonable folly in a man of my years and my sober
calling,&mdash;due to me, to you, to Mrs. Ashleigh, because still
the dearest thing in life to me is honour. And if you, who know
Mrs. Ashleigh so intimately, who must be more or less aware of her
plans or wishes for her daughter's future,&mdash;if you believe
that those plans or wishes lead to a lot far more ambitious than an
alliance with me could offer to Miss Ashleigh, then aid Mr. Vigors
in excluding me from the house; aid me in suppressing a
presumptuous, visionary passion. I cannot enter that house without
love and hope at my heart; and the threshold of that house I must
not cross if such love and such hope would be a sin and a treachery
in the eyes of its owner. I might restore Miss Ashleigh to health;
her gratitude might&mdash;I cannot continue. This danger must not
be to me nor to her, if her mother has views far above such a
son-in-law. And I am the more bound to consider all this while it
is yet time, because I heard you state that Miss Ashleigh had a
fortune, was what would be here termed an heiress. And the full
consciousness that whatever fame one in my profession may live to
acquire, does not open those vistas of social power and grandeur
which are opened by professions to my eyes less noble in
themselves,&mdash;that full consciousness, I say, was forced upon
me by certain words of your own. For the rest, you know my descent
is sufficiently recognized as that amidst well-born gentry to have
rendered me no mesalliance to families the most proud of their
ancestry, if I had kept my hereditary estate and avoided the career
that makes me useful to man. But I acknowledge that on entering a
profession such as mine&mdash;entering any profession except that
of arms or the senate&mdash;all leave their pedigree at its door,
an erased or dead letter. All must come as equals, high-born or
low-born, into that arena in which men ask aid from a man as he
makes himself; to them his dead forefathers are idle dust.
Therefore, to the advantage of birth I cease to have a claim. I am
but a provincial physician, whose station would be the same had he
been a cobbler's son. But gold retains its grand privilege in all
ranks. He who has gold is removed from the suspicion that attaches
to the greedy fortune-hunter. My private fortune, swelled by my
savings, is sufficient to secure to any one I married a larger
settlement than many a wealthy squire can make. I need no fortune
with a wife; if she have one, it would be settled on herself.
Pardon these vulgar details. Now, have I made myself
understood?"</p>

<p>"Fully," answered the Queen of the Hill, who had listened to me
quietly, watchfully, and without one interruption, "fully; and you
have done well to confide in me with so generous an unreserve. But
before I say further, let me ask, what would be your advice for
Lilian, supposing that you ought not to attend her? You have no
trust in Dr. Jones; neither have I. And Annie Ashleigh's note
received to-day, begging me to call, justifies your alarm. Still
you think there is no tendency to consumption?"</p>

<p>"Of that I am certain so far as my slight glimpse of a case that
to me, however, seems a simple and not uncommon one, will permit.
But in the alternative you put&mdash;that my own skill, whatever
its worth, is forbidden&mdash;my earnest advice is that Mrs.
Ashleigh should take her daughter at once to London, and consult
there those great authorities to whom I cannot compare my own
opinion or experience; and by their counsel abide."</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz shaded her eyes with her hand for a few moments, and
seemed in deliberation with herself. Then she said, with her
peculiar smile, half grave, half ironical,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In matters more ordinary you would have won me to your side
long ago. That Mr. Vigors should have presumed to cancel my
recommendation to a settler on the Hill was an act of rebellion,
and involved the honour of my prerogative; but I suppressed my
indignation at an affront so unusual, partly out of pique against
yourself, but much more, I think, out of regard for you."</p>

<p>"I understand. You detected the secret of my heart; you knew
that Mrs. Ashleigh would not wish to see her daughter the wife of a
provincial physician."</p>

<p>"Am I sure, or are you sure, that the daughter herself would
accept that fate; or if she accepted it, would not repent?"</p>

<p>"Do you not think me the vainest of men when I say
this,&mdash;that I cannot believe I should be so enthralled by a
feeling at war with my reason, unfavoured by anything I can detect
in my habits of mind, or even by the dreams of a youth which
exalted science and excluded love, unless I was intimately
convinced that Miss Ashleigh's heart was free, that I could win,
and that I could keep it! Ask me why I am convinced of this, and I
can tell you no more why I think that she could love me than I can
tell you why I love her!"</p>

<p>"I am of the world, worldly; but I am a woman,
womanly,&mdash;though I may not care to be thought it. And,
therefore, though what you say is, regarded in a worldly point of
view, sheer nonsense, regarded in a womanly point of view, it is
logically sound. But still you cannot know Lilian as I do. Your
nature and hers are in strong contrast. I do not think she is a
safe wife for you. The purest, the most innocent creature
imaginable, certainly that, but always in the seventh heaven; and
you in the seventh heaven just at this moment, but with an
irresistible gravitation to the solid earth, which will have its
way again when the honeymoon is over&mdash;I do not believe you two
would harmonize by intercourse. I do not believe Lilian would
sympathize with you, and I am sure you could not sympathize with
her throughout the long dull course of this workday life. And,
therefore, for your sake, as well as hers, I was not displeased to
find that Dr. Jones had replaced you; and now, in return for your
frankness, I say frankly, do not go again to that house. Conquer
this sentiment, fancy, passion, whatever it be. And I will advise
Mrs. Ashleigh to take Lilian to town. Shall it be so settled?"</p>

<p>I could not speak. I buried my face in my hands&mdash;misery,
misery, desolation!</p>

<p>I know not how long I remained thus silent, perhaps many
minutes. At length I felt a cold, firm, but not ungentle hand
placed upon mine; and a clear, full, but not discouraging voice
said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Leave me to think well over this conversation, and to ponder
well the value of all you have shown that you so deeply feel. The
interests of life do not fill both scales of the balance. The
heart, which does not always go in the same scale with the
interests, still has its weight in the scale opposed to them. I
have heard a few wise men say, as many a silly woman says, 'Better
be unhappy with one we love, than be happy with one we love not.'
Do you say that too?"</p>

<p>"With every thought of my brain, every beat of my pulse, I say
it."</p>

<p>"After that answer, all my questionings cease. You shall hear
from me to-morrow. By that time, I shall have seen Annie and
Lilian. I shall have weighed both scales of the balance,&mdash;and
the heart here, Allen Fenwick, seems very heavy. Go, now. I hear
feet on the stairs, Poyntz bringing up some friendly gossiper;
gossipers are spies."</p>

<p>I passed my hand over my eyes, tearless, but how tears would
have relieved the anguish that burdened them! and, without a word,
went down the stairs, meeting at the landing-place Colonel Poyntz
and the old man whose pain my prescription had cured. The old man
was whistling a merry tune, perhaps first learned on the
playground. He broke from it to thank, almost to embrace me, as I
slid by him. I seized his jocund blessing as a good omen, and
carried it with me as I passed into the broad sunlight.
Solitary&mdash;solitary! Should I be so evermore?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>The next day I had just dismissed the last of my visiting
patients, and was about to enter my carriage and commence my round,
when I received a twisted note containing but these
words:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   Call on me to-day, as soon as you can.

                                           M. Poyntz.
</pre>

<p>A few minutes afterwards I was in Mrs. Poyntz's
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Well, Allen Fenwick" said she, "I do not serve friends by
halves. No thanks! I but adhere to a principle I have laid down for
myself. I spent last evening with the Ashleighs. Lilian is
certainly much altered,&mdash;very weak, I fear very ill, and I
believe very unskillfully treated by Dr. Jones. I felt that it was
my duty to insist on a change of physician; but there was something
else to consider before deciding who that physician should be. I
was bound, as your confidante, to consult your own scruples of
honour. Of course I could not say point-blank to Mrs. Ashleigh,
'Dr. Fenwick admires your daughter, would you object to him as a
son-in-law?' Of course I could not touch at all on the secret with
which you intrusted me; but I have not the less arrived at a
conclusion, in agreement with my previous belief, that not being a
woman of the world, Annie Ashleigh has none of the ambition which
women of the world would conceive for a daughter who has a good
fortune and considerable beauty; that her predominant anxiety is
for her child's happiness, and her predominant fear is that her
child will die. She would never oppose any attachment which Lilian
might form; and if that attachment were for one who had preserved
her daughter's life, I believe her own heart would gratefully go
with her daughter's. So far, then, as honour is concerned, all
scruples vanish."</p>

<p>I sprang from my seat, radiant with joy. Mrs. Poyntz dryly
continued: "You value yourself on your common-sense, and to that I
address a few words of counsel which may not be welcome to your
romance. I said that I did not think you and Lilian would suit each
other in the long run; reflection confirms me in that supposition.
Do not look at me so incredulously and so sadly. Listen, and take
heed. Ask yourself what, as a man whose days are devoted to a
laborious profession, whose ambition is entwined with its success,
whose mind must be absorbed in its pursuits,&mdash;ask yourself
what kind of a wife you would have sought to win; had not this
sudden fancy for a charming face rushed over your better reason,
and obliterated all previous plans and resolutions. Surely some one
with whom your heart would have been quite at rest; by whom your
thoughts would have been undistracted from the channels into which
your calling should concentrate their flow; in short, a serene
companion in the quiet holiday of a trustful home! Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>"You interpret my own thoughts when they have turned towards
marriage. But what is there in Lilian Ashleigh that should mar the
picture you have drawn?"</p>

<p>"What is there in Lilian Ashleigh which in the least accords
with the picture? In the first place, the wife of a young physician
should not be his perpetual patient. The more he loves her, and the
more worthy she may be of love, the more her case will haunt him
wherever he goes. When he returns home, it is not to a holiday; the
patient he most cares for, the anxiety that most gnaws him, awaits
him there."</p>

<p>"But, good heavens! why should Lilian Ashleigh be a perpetual
patient? The sanitary resources of youth are incalculable.
And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me stop you; I cannot argue against a physician in love! I
will give up that point in dispute, remaining convinced that there
is something in Lilian's constitution which will perplex, torment,
and baffle you. It was so with her father, whom she resembles in
face and in character. He showed no symptoms of any grave malady.
His outward form was, like Lilian's, a model of symmetry, except in
this, that, like hers, it was too exquisitely delicate; but when
seemingly in the midst of perfect health, at any slight jar on the
nerves he would become alarmingly ill. I was sure that he would die
young, and he did so."</p>

<p>"Ay, but Mrs. Ashleigh said that his death was from brain-fever,
brought on by over-study. Rarely, indeed, do women so fatigue the
brain. No female patient, in the range of my practice, ever died of
purely mental exertion."</p>

<p>"Of purely mental exertion, no; but of heart emotion, many
female patients, perhaps? Oh, you own that! I know nothing about
nerves; but I suppose that, whether they act on the brain or the
heart, the result to life is much the same if the nerves be too
finely strung for life's daily wear and tear. And this is what I
mean, when I say you and Lilian will not suit. As yet, she is a
mere child; her nature undeveloped, and her affections therefore
untried. You might suppose that you had won her heart; she might
believe that she gave it to you, and both be deceived. If fairies
nowadays condescended to exchange their offspring with those of
mortals, and if the popular tradition did not represent a fairy
changeling as an ugly peevish creature, with none of the grace of
its parents, I should be half inclined to suspect that Lilian was
one of the elfin people. She never seems at home on earth; and I do
not think she will ever be contented with a prosaic earthly lot.
Now I have told you why I do not think she will suit you. I must
leave it to yourself to conjecture how far you would suit her. I
say this in due season, while you may set a guard upon your
impulse; while you may yet watch, and weigh, and meditate; and from
this moment on that subject I say no more. I lend advice, but I
never throw it away."</p>

<p>She came here to a dead pause, and began putting on her bonnet
and scarf, which lay on the table beside her. I was a little
chilled by her words, and yet more by the blunt, shrewd, hard look
and manner which aided the effect of their delivery; but the chill
melted away in the sudden glow of my heart when she again turned
towards me and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course you guess, from these preliminary cautions, that you
are going into danger? Mrs. Ashleigh wishes to consult you about
Lilian, and I propose to take you to her house."</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend, my dear friend, how can I ever repay you?" I
caught her hand, the white firm hand, and lifted it to my lips.</p>

<p>She drew it somewhat hastily away, and laying it gently on my
shoulder, said, in a soft voice, "Poor Allen, how little the world
knows either of us! But how little perhaps we know ourselves! Come,
your carriage is here? That is right; we must put down Dr. Jones
publicly and in all our state."</p>

<p>In the carriage Mrs. Poyntz told me the purport of that
conversation with Mrs. Ashleigh to which I owed my re-introduction
to Abbots' House. It seems that Mr. Vigors had called early the
morning after my first visit! had evinced much discomposure on
hearing that I had been summoned! dwelt much on my injurious
treatment of Dr. Lloyd, whom, as distantly related to himself, and
he (Mr. Vigors) being distantly connected with the late Gilbert
Ashleigh, he endeavoured to fasten upon his listener as one of her
husband's family, whose quarrel she was bound in honour to take up.
He spoke of me as an infidel "tainted with French doctrines," and
as a practitioner rash and presumptuous; proving his own freedom
from presumption and rashness by flatly deciding that my opinion
must be wrong. Previously to Mrs. Ashleigh's migration to
L&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Vigors had interested her in the pretended
phenomena of mesmerism. He had consulted a clairvoyante, much
esteemed by poor Dr. Lloyd, as to Lilian's health, and the
clairvoyante had declared her to be constitutionally predisposed to
consumption. Mr. Vigors persuaded Mrs. Ashleigh to come at once
with him and see this clairvoyante herself, armed with a lock of
Lilian's hair and a glove she had worn, as the media of mesmerical
rapport.</p>

<p>The clairvoyante, one of those I had publicly denounced as an
impostor, naturally enough denounced me in return. On being asked
solemnly by Mr. Vigors "to look at Dr. Fenwick and see if his
influence would be beneficial to the subject," the sibyl had become
violently agitated, and said that, "when she looked at us together,
we were enveloped in a black cloud; that this portended affliction
and sinister consequences; that our rapport was antagonistic." Mr.
Vigors then told her to dismiss my image, and conjure up that of
Dr. Jones. Therewith the somnambule became more tranquil, and said:
"Dr. Jones would do well if he would be guided by higher lights
than his own skill, and consult herself daily as to the proper
remedies. The best remedy of all would be mesmerism. But since Dr.
Lloyd's death, she did not know of a mesmerist, sufficiently
gifted, in affinity with the patient." In fine, she impressed and
awed Mrs. Ashleigh, who returned in haste, summoned Dr. Jones, and
dismissed myself.</p>

<p>"I could not have conceived Mrs. Ashleigh to be so utterly
wanting in common-sense," said I. "She talked rationally enough
when I saw her."</p>

<p>"She has common-sense in general, and plenty of the sense most
common," answered Mrs. Poyntz; "but she is easily led and easily
frightened wherever her affections are concerned, and therefore,
just as easily as she had been persuaded by Mr. Vigors and
terrified by the somnambule, I persuaded her against the one, and
terrified her against the other. I had positive experience on my
side, since it was clear that Lilian had been getting rapidly worse
under Dr. Jones's care. The main obstacles I had to encounter in
inducing Mrs. Ashleigh to consult you again were, first, her
reluctance to disoblige Mr. Vigors, as a friend and connection of
Lilian's father; and, secondly, her sentiment of shame in
re-inviting your opinion after having treated you with so little
respect. Both these difficulties I took on myself. I bring you to
her house, and, on leaving you, I shall go on to Mr. Vigors, and
tell him what is done is my doing, and not to be undone by him; so
that matter is settled. Indeed, if you were out of the question, I
should not suffer Mr. Vigors to re-introduce all these mummeries of
clairvoyance and mesmerism into the precincts of the Hill. I did
not demolish a man I really liked in Dr. Lloyd, to set up a Dr.
Jones, whom I despise, in his stead. Clairvoyance on Abbey Hill,
indeed! I saw enough of it before."</p>

<p>"True; your strong intellect detected at once the absurdity of
the whole pretence,&mdash;the falsity of mesmerism, the
impossibility of clairvoyance."</p>

<p>"No, my strong intellect did nothing of the kind. I do not know
whether mesmerism be false or clairvoyance impossible; and I don't
wish to know. All I do know is, that I saw the Hill in great
danger,&mdash;young ladies allowing themselves to be put to sleep
by gentlemen, and pretending they had no will of their own against
such fascination! Improper and shocking! And Miss Brabazon
beginning to prophesy, and Mrs. Leopold Smythe questioning her maid
(whom Dr. Lloyd declared to be highly gifted) as to all the secrets
of her friends. When I saw this, I said, 'The Hill is becoming
demoralized; the Hill is making itself ridiculous; the Hill must be
saved!' I remonstrated with Dr. Lloyd as a friend; he remained
obdurate. I annihilated him as an enemy, not to me but to the
State. I slew my best lover for the good of Rome. Now you know why
I took your part,&mdash;not because I have any opinion, one way or
the other, as to the truth or falsehood of what Dr. Lloyd asserted;
but I have a strong opinion that, whether they be true or false,
his notions were those which are not to be allowed on the Hill. And
so, Allen Fenwick, that matter was settled."</p>

<p>Perhaps at another time I might have felt some little
humiliation to learn that I had been honoured with the influence of
this great potentate not as a champion of truth, but as an
instrument of policy; and I might have owned to some twinge of
conscience in having assisted to sacrifice a fellow-seeker after
science&mdash;misled, no doubt, but preferring his independent
belief to his worldly interest&mdash;and sacrifice him to those
deities with whom science is ever at war,&mdash;the Prejudices of a
Clique sanctified into the Proprieties of the World. But at that
moment the words I heard made no perceptible impression on my mind.
The gables of Abbots' House were visible above the evergreens and
lilacs; another moment, and the carriage stopped at the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh received us in the dining-room. Her manner to me,
at first, was a little confused and shy. But my companion soon
communicated something of her own happy ease to her gentler friend.
After a short conversation we all three went to Lilian, who was in
a little room on the ground-floor, fitted up as her study. I was
glad to perceive that my interdict of the deathchamber had been
respected.</p>

<p>She reclined on a sofa near the window, which was, however,
jealously closed; the light of the bright May-day obscured by
blinds and curtains; a large fire on the hearth; the air of the
room that of a hot-house,&mdash;the ignorant, senseless, exploded
system of nursing into consumption those who are confined on
suspicion of it! She did not heed us as we entered noiselessly; her
eyes were drooped languidly on the floor, and with difficulty I
suppressed the exclamation that rose to my lips on seeing her. She
seemed within the last few days so changed, and on the aspect of
the countenance there was so profound a melancholy! But as she
slowly turned at the sound of our footsteps, and her eyes met mine,
a quick blush came into the wan cheek, and she half rose, but sank
back as if the effort exhausted her. There was a struggle for
breath, and a low hollow cough. Was it possible that I had been
mistaken, and that in that cough was heard the warning knell of the
most insidious enemy to youthful life?</p>

<p>I sat down by her side; I lured her on to talk of indifferent
subjects,&mdash;the weather, the gardens, the bird in the cage,
which was placed on the table near her. Her voice, at first low and
feeble, became gradually stronger, and her face lighted up with a
child's innocent, playful smile. No, I had not been mistaken! That
was no lymphatic, nerveless temperament, on which consumption
fastens as its lawful prey; here there was no hectic pulse, no
hurried waste of the vital flame. Quietly and gently I made my
observations, addressed my questions, applied my stethoscope; and
when I turned my face towards her mother's anxious, eager eyes,
that face told my opinion; for her mother sprang forward, clasped
my hand, and said, through her struggling tears,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You smile! You see nothing to fear?"</p>

<p>"Fear! No, indeed! You will soon be again yourself, Miss
Ashleigh, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, with her sweet laugh, "I shall be well now very
soon. But may I not have the window open; may I not go into the
garden? I so long for fresh air."</p>

<p>"No, no, darling," exclaimed Mrs. Ashleigh, "not while the east
winds last. Dr. Jones said on no account. On no account, Dr.
Fenwick, eh?"</p>

<p>"Will you take my arm, Miss Ashleigh, for a few turns up and
down the room?" said I. "We will then see how far we may rebel
against Dr. Jones."</p>

<p>She rose with some little effort, but there was no cough. At
first her step was languid; it became lighter and more elastic
after a few moments.</p>

<p>"Let her come out," said I to Mrs. Ashleigh. "The wind is not in
the east, and, while we are out, pray bid your servant lower to the
last bar in the grate that fire,&mdash;only fit for Christmas."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, no buts! He is a poor doctor who is not a stern
despot."</p>

<p>So the straw hat and mantle were sent for. Lilian was wrapped
with unnecessary care, and we all went forth into the garden.
Involuntarily we took the way to the Monk's Well, and at every step
Lilian seemed to revive under the bracing air and temperate sun. We
paused by the well.</p>

<p>"You do not feel fatigued, Miss Ashleigh?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But your face seems changed. It is grown sadder."</p>

<p>"Not sadder."</p>

<p>"Sadder than when I first saw it,&mdash;saw it when you were
seated here!" I said this in a whisper. I felt her hand tremble as
it lay on my arm.</p>

<p>"You saw me seated here!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I will tell you how some day."</p>

<p>Lilian lifted her eyes to mine, and there was in them that same
surprise which I had noticed on my first visit,&mdash;a surprise
that perplexed me, blended with no displeasure, but yet with a
something of vague alarm.</p>

<p>We soon returned to the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh made me a sign to follow her into the
drawing-room, leaving Mrs. Poyntz with Lilian.</p>

<p>"Well?" said she, tremblingly.</p>

<p>"Permit me to see Dr. Jones's prescriptions. Thank you. Ay, I
thought so. My dear madam, the mistake here has been in depressing
nature instead of strengthening; in narcotics instead of
stimulants. The main stimulants which leave no reaction are air and
light. Promise me that I may have my own way for a week,&mdash;that
all I recommend will be implicitly heeded?"</p>

<p>"I promise. But that cough,&mdash;you noticed it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The nervous system is terribly lowered, and nervous
exhaustion is a strange impostor; it imitates all manner of
complaints with which it has no connection. The cough will soon
disappear! But pardon my question. Mrs. Poyntz tells me that you
consulted a clairvoyants about your daughter. Does Miss Ashleigh
know that you did so?"</p>

<p>"No; I did not tell her."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that. And pray, for Heaven's sake, guard her
against all that may set her thinking on such subjects. Above all,
guard her against concentring attention on any malady that your
fears erroneously ascribe to her. It is amongst the phenomena of
our organization that you cannot closely rivet your consciousness
on any part of the frame, however healthy, but it will soon begin
to exhibit morbid sensibility. Try to fix all your attention on
your little finger for half an hour, and before the half hour is
over the little finger will be uneasy, probably even painful. How
serious, then, is the danger to a young girl, at the age in which
imagination is most active, most intense, if you force upon her a
belief that she is in danger of a mortal disease! It is a
peculiarity of youth to brood over the thought of early death much
more resignedly, much more complacently, than we do in maturer
years. Impress on a young imaginative girl, as free from pulmonary
tendencies as you and I are, the conviction that she must fade away
into the grave, and though she may not actually die of consumption,
you instil slow poison into her system. Hope is the natural aliment
of youth. You impoverish nourishment where you discourage hope. As
soon as this temporary illness is over, reject for your daughter
the melancholy care which seems to her own mind to mark her out
from others of her age. Rear her for the air, which is the kindest
life-giver; to sleep with open windows: to be out at sunrise.
Nature will do more for her than all our drugs can do. You have
been hitherto fearing Nature; now trust to her."</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Poyntz joined us, and having, while I had been
speaking, written my prescription and some general injunctions, I
closed my advice with an appeal to that powerful protectress.</p>

<p>"This, my dear madam, is a case in which I need your aid, and I
ask it. Miss Ashleigh should not be left with no other companion
than her mother. A change of faces is often as salutary as a change
of air. If you could devote an hour or two this very evening to sit
with Miss Ashleigh, to talk to her with your usual cheerfulness,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Annie," interrupted Mrs. Poyntz, "I will come and drink tea
with you at half-past seven, and bring my knitting; and perhaps, if
you ask him, Dr. Fenwick will come too! He can be tolerably
entertaining when he likes it."</p>

<p>"It is too great a tax on his kindness, I fear," said Mrs.
Ashleigh. "But," she added cordially, "I should be grateful indeed
if he would spare us an hour of his time."</p>

<p>I murmured an assent which I endeavoured to make not too
joyous.</p>

<p>"So that matter is settled," said Mrs. Poyntz; "and now I shall
go to Mr. Vigors and prevent his further interference."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Margaret, pray don't offend him,&mdash;a connection of
my poor dear Gilbert's. And so tetchy! I am sure I do not know how
you'll manage to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To get rid of him? Never fear. As I manage everything and
everybody," said Mrs. Poyntz, bluntly. So she kissed her friend on
the forehead, gave me a gracious nod, and, declining the offer of
my carriage, walked with her usual brisk, decided tread down the
short path towards the town.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh timidly approached me, and again the furtive hand
bashfully insinuated the hateful fee.</p>

<p>"Stay," said I; "this is a case which needs the most constant
watching. I wish to call so often that I should seem the most
greedy of doctors if my visits were to be computed at guineas. Let
me be at ease to effect my cure; my pride of science is involved in
it. And when amongst all the young ladies of the Hill you can point
to none with a fresher bloom, or a fairer promise of healthful
life, than the patient you intrust to my care, why, then the fee
and the dismissal. Nay, nay; I must refer you to our friend Mrs.
Poyntz. It was so settled with her before she brought me here to
displace Dr. Jones." Therewith I escaped.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>In less than a week Lilian was convalescent; in less than a
fortnight she regained her usual health,&mdash;nay, Mrs. Ashleigh
declared that she had never known her daughter appear so cheerful
and look so well. I had established a familiar intimacy at Abbots'
House; most of my evenings were spent there. As horse exercise
formed an important part of my advice, Mrs. Ashleigh had purchased
a pretty and quiet horse for her daughter; and, except the weather
was very unfavourable, Lilian now rode daily with Colonel Poyntz,
who was a notable equestrian, and often accompanied by Miss Jane
Poyntz, and other young ladies of the Hill. I was generally
relieved from my duties in time to join her as she returned
homewards. Thus we made innocent appointments, openly, frankly, in
her mother's presence, she telling me beforehand in what direction
excursions had been planned with Colonel Poyntz, and I promising to
fall in with the party&mdash;if my avocations would permit. At my
suggestion, Mrs. Ashleigh now opened her house almost every evening
to some of the neighbouring families; Lilian was thus habituated to
the intercourse of young persons of her own age. Music and dancing
and childlike games made the old house gay. And the Hill gratefully
acknowledged to Mrs. Poyntz, "that the Ashleighs were indeed a
great acquisition."</p>

<p>But my happiness was not uncheckered. In thus unselfishly
surrounding Lilian with others, I felt the anguish of that jealousy
which is inseparable from those earlier stages of love, when the
lover as yet has won no right to that self-confidence which can
only spring from the assurance that he is loved.</p>

<p>In these social reunions I remained aloof from Lilian. I saw her
courted by the gay young admirers whom her beauty and her fortune
drew around her,&mdash;her soft face brightening in the exercise of
the dance, which the gravity of my profession rather than my years
forbade to join; and her laugh, so musically subdued, ravishing my
ear and fretting my heart as if the laugh were a mockery on my
sombre self and my presumptuous dreams. But no, suddenly, shyly,
her eyes would steal away from those about her, steal to the corner
in which I sat, as if they missed me, and, meeting my own gaze,
their light softened before they turned away; and the colour on her
cheek would deepen, and to her lip there came a smile different
from the smile that it shed on others. And then&mdash;and
then&mdash;all jealousy, all sadness vanished, and I felt the glory
which blends with the growing belief that we are loved.</p>

<p>In that diviner epoch of man's mysterious passion, when ideas of
perfection and purity, vague and fugitive before, start forth and
concentre themselves round one virgin shape,&mdash;that rises out
from the sea of creation, welcomed by the Hours and adorned by the
Graces,&mdash;how the thought that this archetype of sweetness and
beauty singles himself from the millions, singles himself for her
choice, ennobles and lifts up his being! Though after-experience
may rebuke the mortal's illusion, that mistook for a daughter of
Heaven a creature of clay like himself, yet for a while the
illusion has grandeur. Though it comes from the senses which shall
later oppress and profane it, the senses at first shrink into
shade, awed and hushed by the presence that charms them. All that
is brightest and best in the man has soared up like long-dormant
instincts of Heaven, to greet and to hallow what to him seems
life's fairest dream of the heavenly! Take the wings from the image
of Love, and the god disappears from the form!</p>

<p>Thus, if at moments jealous doubt made my torture, so the
moment's relief from it sufficed for my rapture. But I had a cause
for disquiet less acute but less varying than jealousy.</p>

<p>Despite Lilian's recovery from the special illness which had
more immediately absorbed my care, I remained perplexed as to its
cause and true nature. To her mother I gave it the convenient
epithet of "nervous;" but the epithet did not explain to myself all
the symptoms I classified by it. There was still, at times, when no
cause was apparent or conjecturable, a sudden change in the
expression of her countenance, in the beat of her pulse; the eye
would become fixed, the bloom would vanish, the pulse would sink
feebler and feebler till it could be scarcely felt; yet there was
no indication of heart disease, of which such sudden lowering of
life is in itself sometimes a warning indication. The change would
pass away after a few minutes, during which she seemed unconscious,
or, at least, never spoke&mdash;never appeared to heed what was
said to her. But in the expression of her countenance there was no
character of suffering or distress; on the contrary, a wondrous
serenity, that made her beauty more beauteous, her very
youthfulness younger; and when this spurious or partial kind of
syncope passed, she recovered at once without effort, without
acknowledging that she had felt faint or unwell, but rather with a
sense of recruited vitality, as the weary obtain from a sleep. For
the rest her spirits were more generally light and joyous than I
should have premised from her mother's previous description. She
would enter mirthfully into the mirth of young companions round
her: she had evidently quick perception of the sunny sides of life;
an infantine gratitude for kindness; an infantine joy in the
trifles that amuse only those who delight in tastes pure and
simple. But when talk rose into graver and more contemplative
topics, her attention became earnest and absorbed; and sometimes a
rich eloquence, such as I have never before nor since heard from
lips so young, would startle me first into a wondering silence, and
soon into a disapproving alarm: for the thoughts she then uttered
seemed to me too fantastic, too visionary, too much akin to the
vagaries of a wild though beautiful imagination. And then I would
seek to check, to sober, to distract fancies with which my reason
had no sympathy, and the indulgence of which I regarded as
injurious to the normal functions of the brain.</p>

<p>When thus, sometimes with a chilling sentence, sometimes with a
half-sarcastic laugh, I would repress outpourings frank and musical
as the songs of a forest-bird, she would look at me with a kind of
plaintive sorrow,&mdash;often sigh and shiver as she turned away.
Only in those modes did she show displeasure; otherwise ever sweet
and docile, and ever, if, seeing that I had pained her, I asked
forgiveness, humbling herself rather to ask mine, and brightening
our reconciliation with her angel smile. As yet I had not dared to
speak of love; as yet I gazed on her as the captive gazes on the
flowers and the stars through the gratings of his cell, murmuring
to himself, "When shall the doors unclose?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>It was with a wrath suppressed in the presence of the fair
ambassadress, that Mr. Vigors had received from Mrs. Poyntz the
intelligence that I had replaced Dr. Jones at Abbots' House not
less abruptly than Dr. Jones had previously supplanted me. As Mrs.
Poyntz took upon herself the whole responsibility of this change,
Mr. Vigors did not venture to condemn it to her face; for the
Administrator of Laws was at heart no little in awe of the Autocrat
of Proprieties; as Authority, howsoever established, is in awe of
Opinion, howsoever capricious.</p>

<p>To the mild Mrs. Ashleigh the magistrate's anger was more
decidedly manifested. He ceased his visits; and in answer to a long
and deprecatory letter with which she endeavoured to soften his
resentment and win him back to the house, he replied by an
elaborate combination of homily and satire. He began by excusing
himself from accepting her invitations, on the ground that his time
was valuable, his habits domestic; and though ever willing to
sacrifice both time and habits where he could do good, he owed it
to himself and to mankind to sacrifice neither where his advice was
rejected and his opinion contemned. He glanced briefly, but not
hastily, at the respect with which her late husband had deferred to
his judgment, and the benefits which that deference had enabled him
to bestow. He contrasted the husband's deference with the widow's
contumely, and hinted at the evils which the contumely would not
permit him to prevent. He could not presume to say what women of
the world might think due to deceased husbands, but even women of
the world generally allowed the claims of living children, and did
not act with levity where their interests were concerned, still
less where their lives were at stake. As to Dr. Jones, he, Mr.
Vigors, had the fullest confidence in his skill. Mrs. Ashleigh must
judge for herself whether Mrs. Poyntz was as good an authority upon
medical science as he had no doubt she was upon shawls and ribbons.
Dr. Jones was a man of caution and modesty; he did not indulge in
the hollow boasts by which charlatans decoy their dupes; but Dr.
Jones had privately assured him that though the case was one that
admitted of no rash experiments, he had no fear of the result if
his own prudent system were persevered in. What might be the
consequences of any other system, Dr. Jones would not say, because
he was too high-minded to express his distrust of the rival who had
made use of underhand arts to supplant him. But Mr. Vigors was
convinced, from other sources of information (meaning, I presume,
the oracular prescience of his clairvoyants), that the time would
come when the poor young lady would herself insist on discarding
Dr. Fenwick, and when "that person" would appear in a very
different light to many who now so fondly admired and so
reverentially trusted him. When that time arrived, he, Mr. Vigors,
might again be of use; but, meanwhile, though he declined to renew
his intimacy at Abbots' House, or to pay unavailing visits of mere
ceremony, his interest in the daughter of his old friend remained
undiminished, nay, was rather increased by compassion; that he
should silently keep his eye upon her; and whenever anything to her
advantage suggested itself to him, he should not be deterred by the
slight with which Mrs. Ashleigh had treated his judgment from
calling on her, and placing before her conscience as a mother his
ideas for her child's benefit, leaving to herself then, as now, the
entire responsibility of rejecting the advice which he might say,
without vanity, was deemed of some value by those who could
distinguish between sterling qualities and specious pretences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh's was that thoroughly womanly nature which
instinctively leans upon others. She was diffident, trustful, meek,
affectionate. Not quite justly had Mrs. Poyntz described her as
"commonplace weak," for though she might be called weak, it was not
because she was commonplace; she had a goodness of heart, a
sweetness of disposition, to which that disparaging definition
could not apply. She could only be called commonplace inasmuch as
in the ordinary daily affairs of life she had a great deal of
ordinary daily commonplace good-sense. Give her a routine to
follow, and no routine could be better adhered to. In the allotted
sphere of a woman's duties she never seemed in fault. No household,
not even Mrs. Poyntz's, was more happily managed. The old Abbots'
House had merged its original antique gloom in the softer character
of pleasing repose. All her servants adored Mrs. Ashleigh; all
found it a pleasure to please her; her establishment had the
harmony of clockwork; comfort diffused itself round her like quiet
sunshine round a sheltered spot. To gaze on her pleasing
countenance, to listen to the simple talk that lapsed from her
guileless lips, in even, slow, and lulling murmur, was in itself a
respite from "eating cares." She was to the mind what the colour of
green is to the eye. She had, therefore, excellent sense in all
that relates to every-day life. There, she needed not to consult
another; there, the wisest might have consulted her with profit.
But the moment anything, however trivial in itself, jarred on the
routine to which her mind had grown wedded, the moment an incident
hurried her out of the beaten track of woman's daily life, then her
confidence forsook her; then she needed a confidant, an adviser;
and by that confidant or adviser she could be credulously lured or
submissively controlled. Therefore, when she lost, in Mr. Vigors,
the guide she had been accustomed to consult whenever she needed
guidance, she turned; helplessly and piteously, first to Mrs.
Poyntz, and then yet more imploringly to me, because a woman of
that character is never quite satisfied without the advice of a
man; and where an intimacy more familiar than that of his formal
visits is once established with a physician, confidence in him
grows fearless and rapid, as the natural result of sympathy
concentrated on an object of anxiety in common between himself and
the home which opens its sacred recess to his observant but tender
eye. Thus Mrs. Ashleigh had shown me Mr. Vigors's letter, and,
forgetting that I might not be as amiable as herself, besought me
to counsel her how to conciliate and soften her lost husband's
friend and connection. That character clothed him with dignity and
awe in her soft forgiving eyes. So, smothering my own resentment,
less perhaps at the tone of offensive insinuation against myself
than at the arrogance with which this prejudiced intermeddler
implied to a mother the necessity of his guardian watch over a
child under her own care, I sketched a reply which seemed to me
both dignified and placatory, abstaining from all discussion, and
conveying the assurance that Mrs. Ashleigh would be at all times
glad to hear, and disposed to respect, whatever suggestion so
esteemed a friend of her husband would kindly submit to her for the
welfare of her daughter.</p>

<p>There all communication had stopped for about a month since the
date of my reintroduction to Abbots' House. One afternoon I
unexpectedly met Mr. Vigors at the entrance of the blind lane, I on
my way to Abbots' House, and my first glance at his face told me
that he was coming from it, for the expression of that face was
more than usually sinister; the sullen scowl was lit into
significant menace by a sneer of unmistakable triumph. I felt at
once that he had succeeded in some machination against me, and with
ominous misgivings quickened my steps.</p>

<p>I found Mrs. Ashleigh seated alone in front of the house, under
a large cedar-tree that formed a natural arbour in the centre of
the sunny lawn. She was perceptibly embarrassed as I took my seat
beside her.</p>

<p>"I hope," said I, forcing a smile, "that Mr. Vigors has not been
telling you that I shall kill my patient, or that she looks much
worse than she did under Dr. Jones's care?"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "He owned cheerfully that Lilian had grown quite
strong, and said, without any displeasure, that he had heard how
gay she had been, riding out and even dancing,&mdash;which is very
kind in him, for he disapproves of dancing, on principle."</p>

<p>"But still I can see he has said something to vex or annoy you;
and, to judge by his countenance when I met him in the lane, I
should conjecture that that something was intended to lower the
confidence you so kindly repose in me."</p>

<p>"I assure you not; he did not mention your name, either to me or
to Lilian. I never knew him more friendly; quite like old times. He
is a good man at heart, very, and was much attached to my poor
husband."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Ashleigh profess a very high opinion of Mr.
Vigors?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't quite know that, because my dear Gilbert never
spoke to me much about him. Gilbert was naturally very silent. But
he shrank from all trouble&mdash;all worldly affairs&mdash;and Mr.
Vigors managed his estate, and inspected his steward's books, and
protected him through a long lawsuit which he had inherited from
his father. It killed his father. I don't know what we should have
done without Mr. Vigors, and I am so glad he has forgiven me."</p>

<p>"Hem! Where is Miss Ashleigh? Indoors?"</p>

<p>"No; somewhere in the grounds. But, my dear Dr. Fenwick, do not
leave me yet; you are so very, very kind, and somehow I have grown
to look upon you quite as an old friend. Something has happened
which has put me out, quite put me out."</p>

<p>She said this wearily and feebly, closing her eyes as if she
were indeed put out in the sense of extinguished.</p>

<p>"The feeling of friendship you express," said I, with
earnestness, "is reciprocal. On my side it is accompanied by a
peculiar gratitude. I am a lonely man, by a lonely fireside, no
parents, no near kindred, and in this town, since Dr. Faber left
it, without cordial intimacy till I knew you. In admitting me so
familiarly to your hearth, you have given me what I have never
known before since I came to man's estate,&mdash;a glimpse of the
happy domestic life; the charm and relief to eye, heart, and spirit
which is never known but in households cheered by the face of
woman. Thus my sentiment for you and yours is indeed that of an old
friend; and in any private confidence you show me, I feel as if I
were no longer a lonely man, without kindred, without home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh seemed much moved by these words, which my heart
had forced from my lips; and, after replying to me with simple
unaffected warmth of kindness, she rose, took my arm, and continued
thus as we walked slowly to and fro the lawn: "You know, perhaps,
that my poor husband left a sister, now a widow like myself, Lady
Haughton."</p>

<p>"I remember that Mrs. Poyntz said you had such a sister-in-law,
but I never heard you mention Lady Haughton till now. Well!"</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Vigors has brought me a letter from her, and it is
that which has put me out. I dare say you have not heard me speak
before of Lady Haughton, for I am ashamed to say I had almost
forgotten her existence. She is many years older than my husband
was; of a very different character. Only came once to see him after
our marriage. Hurt me by ridiculing him as a bookworm; offended him
by looking a little down on me, as a nobody without spirit and
fashion, which was quite true. And, except by a cold and unfeeling
letter of formal condolence after I lost my dear Gilbert, I have
never heard from her since I have been a widow, till to-day. But,
after all, she is my poor husband's sister, and his eldest sister,
and Lilian's aunt; and, as Mr. Vigors says, 'Duty is duty.'"</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Ashleigh said "Duty is torture," she could not have
uttered the maxim with more mournful and despondent
resignation.</p>

<p>"And what does this lady require of you, which Mr. Vigors deems
it your duty to comply with?"</p>

<p>"Dear me! What penetration! You have guessed the exact truth.
But I think you will agree with Mr. Vigors. Certainly I have no
option; yes, I must do it."</p>

<p>"My penetration is in fault now. Do what? Pray explain."</p>

<p>"Poor Lady Haughton, six months ago, lost her only son, Sir
James. Mr. Vigors says he was a very fine young man, of whom any
mother would have been proud. I had heard he was wild; Mr. Vigors
says, however, that he was just going to reform, and marry a young
lady whom his mother chose for him, when, unluckily, he would ride
a steeplechase, not being quite sober at the time, and broke his
neck. Lady Haughton has been, of course, in great grief. She has
retired to Brighton; and she wrote to me from thence, and Mr.
Vigors brought the letter. He will go back to her to-day."</p>

<p>"Will go back to Lady Haughton? What! Has he been to her? Is he,
then, as intimate with Lady Haughton as he was with her
brother?"</p>

<p>"No; but there has been a long and constant correspondence. She
had a settlement on the Kirby Estate,&mdash;a sum which was not
paid off during Gilbert's life; and a very small part of the
property went to Sir James, which part Mr. Ashleigh Sumner, the
heir-at-law to the rest of the estate, wished Mr. Vigors, as his
guardian, to buy during his minority, and as it was mixed up with
Lady Haughton's settlement her consent was necessary as well as Sir
James's. So there was much negotiation, and, since then, Ashleigh
Sumner has come into the Haughton property, on poor Sir James's
decease; so that complicated all affairs between Mr. Vigors and
Lady Haughton, and he has just been to Brighton to see her. And
poor Lady Haughton, in short, wants me and Lilian to go and visit
her. I don't like it at all. But you said the other day you thought
sea air might be good for Lilian during the heat of the summer, and
she seems well enough now for the change. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"She is well enough, certainly. But Brighton is not the place I
would recommend for the summer; it wants shade, and is much hotter
than L&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; but unluckily Lady Haughton foresaw that objection, and
she has a jointure-house some miles from Brighton, and near the
sea. She says the grounds are well wooded, and the place is
proverbially cool and healthy, not far from St. Leonard's Forest.
And, in short, I have written to say we will come. So we must,
unless, indeed, you positively forbid it."</p>

<p>"When do you think of going?"</p>

<p>"Next Monday. Mr. Vigors would make me fix the day. If you knew
how I dislike moving when I am once settled; and I do so dread Lady
Haughton, she is so fine, and so satirical! But Mr. Vigors says she
is very much altered, poor thing! I should like to show you her
letter, but I had just sent it to Margaret&mdash;Mrs.
Poyntz&mdash;a minute or two before you came. She knows something
of Lady Haughton. Margaret knows everybody. And we shall have to go
in mourning for poor Sir James, I suppose; and Margaret will choose
it, for I am sure I can't guess to what extent we should be
supposed to mourn. I ought to have gone in mourning
before&mdash;poor Gilbert's nephew&mdash;but I am so stupid, and I
had never seen him. And&mdash;But oh, this is kind! Margaret
herself,&mdash;my dear Margaret!"</p>

<p>We had just turned away from the house, in our up-and-down walk;
and Mrs. Poyntz stood immediately fronting us. "So, Anne, you have
actually accepted this invitation&mdash;and for Monday next?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Did I do wrong?"</p>

<p>"What does Dr. Fenwick say? Can Lilian go with safety?"</p>

<p>I could not honestly say she might not go with safety, but my
heart sank like lead as I answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Ashleigh does not now need merely medical care; but more
than half her cure has depended on keeping her spirits free from
depression. She may miss the cheerful companionship of your
daughter, and other young ladies of her own age. A very melancholy
house, saddened by a recent bereavement, without other guests; a
hostess to whom she is a stranger, and whom Mrs. Ashleigh herself
appears to deem formidable,&mdash;certainly these do not make that
change of scene which a physician would recommend. When I spoke of
sea air being good for Miss Ashleigh, I thought of our own northern
coasts at a later time of the year, when I could escape myself for
a few weeks and attend her. The journey to a northern
watering-place would be also shorter and less fatiguing; the air
there more invigorating."</p>

<p>"No doubt that would be better," said Mrs. Poyntz, dryly; "but
so far as your objections to visiting Lady Haughton have been
stated, they are groundless. Her house will not be melancholy; she
will have other guests, and Lilian will find companions, young like
herself,&mdash;young ladies&mdash;and young gentlemen too!"</p>

<p>There was something ominous, something compassionate, in the
look which Mrs. Poyntz cast upon me, in concluding her speech,
which in itself was calculated to rouse the fears of a lover.
Lilian away from me, in the house of a worldly-fine lady&mdash;such
as I judged Lady Haughton to be&mdash;surrounded by young
gentlemen, as well as young ladies, by admirers, no doubt, of a
higher rank and more brilliant fashion than she had yet known! I
closed my eyes, and with strong effort suppressed a groan.</p>

<p>"My dear Annie, let me satisfy myself that Dr. Fenwick really
does consent to this journey. He will say to me what he may not to
you. Pardon me, then, if I take him aside for a few minutes. Let me
find you here again under this cedar-tree."</p>

<p>Placing her arm in mine, and without waiting for Mrs. Ashleigh's
answer, Mrs. Poyntz drew me into the more sequestered walk that
belted the lawn; and when we were out of Mrs. Ashleigh's sight and
hearing, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"From what you have now seen of Lilian Ashleigh, do you still
desire to gain her as your wife?"</p>

<p>"Still? Oh, with an intensity proportioned to the fear with
which I now dread that she is about to pass away from my
eyes&mdash;from my life!"</p>

<p>"Does your judgment confirm the choice of your heart? Reflect
before you answer."</p>

<p>"Such selfish judgment as I had before I knew her would not
confirm but oppose it. The nobler judgment that now expands all my
reasonings, approves and seconds my heart. No, no; do not smile so
sarcastically. This is not the voice of a blind and egotistical
passion. Let me explain myself if I can. I concede to you that
Lilian's character is undeveloped; I concede to you, that amidst
the childlike freshness and innocence of her nature, there is at
times a strangeness, a mystery, which I have not yet traced to its
cause. But I am certain that the intellect is organically as sound
as the heart, and that intellect and heart will ultimately&mdash;if
under happy auspices&mdash;blend in that felicitous union which
constitutes the perfection of woman. But it is because she does,
and may for years, may perhaps always, need a more devoted,
thoughtful care than natures less tremulously sensitive, that my
judgment sanctions my choice; for whatever is best for her is best
for me. And who would watch over her as I should?"</p>

<p>"You have never yet spoken to Lilian as lovers speak?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed."</p>

<p>"And, nevertheless, you believe that your affection would not be
unreturned?"</p>

<p>"I thought so once; I doubt now,&mdash;yet, in doubting, hope.
But why do you alarm me with these questions? You, too, forebode
that in this visit I may lose her forever?"</p>

<p>"If you fear that, tell her so, and perhaps her answer may
dispel your fear."</p>

<p>"What! now, already, when she has scarcely known me a month.
Might I not risk all if too premature?"</p>

<p>"There is no almanac for love. With many women love is born the
moment they know they are beloved. All wisdom tells us that a
moment once gone is irrevocable. Were I in your place, I should
feel that I approached a moment that I must not lose. I have said
enough; now I shall rejoin Mrs. Ashleigh."</p>

<p>"Stay&mdash;tell me first what Lady Haughton's letter really
contains to prompt the advice with which you so transport, and yet
so daunt, me when you proffer it."</p>

<p>"Not now; later, perhaps,&mdash;not now. If you wish to see
Lilian alone, she is by the Old Monk's Well; I saw her seated there
as I passed that way to the house."</p>

<p>"One word more,&mdash;only one. Answer this question frankly,
for it is one of honour. Do you still believe that my suit to her
daughter would not be disapproved of by Mrs. Ashleigh?"</p>

<p>"At this moment I am sure it would not; a week hence I might not
give you the same answer."</p>

<p>So she passed on with her quick but measured tread, back through
the shady walk, on to the open lawn, till the last glimpse of her
pale gray robe disappeared under the boughs of the cedar-tree.
Then, with a start, I broke the irresolute, tremulous suspense in
which I had vainly endeavoured to analyze my own mind, solve my own
doubts, concentrate my own will, and went the opposite way,
skirting the circle of that haunted ground,&mdash;as now, on one
side its lofty terrace, the houses of the neighbouring city came
full and close into view, divided from my fairy-land of life but by
the trodden murmurous thoroughfare winding low beneath the ivied
parapets; and as now, again, the world of men abruptly vanished
behind the screening foliage of luxuriant June.</p>

<p>At last the enchanted glade opened out from the verdure, its
borders fragrant with syringa and rose and woodbine; and there, by
the gray memorial of the gone Gothic age, my eyes seemed to close
their unquiet wanderings, resting spell-bound on that image which
had become to me the incarnation of earth's bloom and youth.</p>

<p>She stood amidst the Past, backed by the fragments of walls
which man had raised to seclude him from human passion, locking,
under those lids so downcast, the secret of the only knowledge I
asked from the boundless Future.</p>

<p>Ah! what mockery there is in that grand word, the world's fierce
war-cry,&mdash;Freedom! Who has not known one period of life, and
that so solemn that its shadows may rest over all life hereafter,
when one human creature has over him a sovereignty more supreme and
absolute than Orient servitude adores in the symbols of diadem and
sceptre? What crest so haughty that has not bowed before a hand
which could exalt or humble! What heart so dauntless that has not
trembled to call forth the voice at whose sound open the gates of
rapture or despair! That life alone is free which rules, and
suffices for itself. That life we forfeit when we love!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p>How did I utter it? By what words did my heart make itself
known? I remember not. All was as a dream that falls upon a
restless, feverish night, and fades away as the eyes unclose on the
peace of a cloudless heaven, on the bliss of a golden sun. A new
morrow seemed indeed upon the earth when I woke from a life-long
yesterday,&mdash;her dear hand in mine, her sweet face bowed upon
my breast.</p>

<p>And then there was that melodious silence in which there is no
sound audible from without; yet within us there is heard a lulling
celestial music, as if our whole being, grown harmonious with the
universe, joined from its happy deeps in the hymn that unites the
stars.</p>

<p>In that silence our two hearts seemed to make each other
understood, to be drawing nearer and nearer, blending by mysterious
concord into the completeness of a solemn union, never henceforth
to be rent asunder.</p>

<p>At length I said softly: "And it was here on this spot that I
first saw you,&mdash;here that I for the first time knew what power
to change our world and to rule our future goes forth from the
charm of a human face!"</p>

<p>Then Lilian asked me timidly, and without lifting her eyes, how
I had so seen her, reminding me that I promised to tell her, and
had never yet done so.</p>

<p>And then I told her of the strange impulse that had led me into
the grounds, and by what chance my steps had been diverted down the
path that wound to the glade; how suddenly her form had shone upon
my eyes, gathering round itself the rose hues of the setting sun,
and how wistfully those eyes had followed her own silent gaze into
the distant heaven.</p>

<p>As I spoke, her hand pressed mine eagerly, convulsively, and,
raising her face from my breast, she looked at me with an intent,
anxious earnestness. That look!&mdash;twice before it had thrilled
and perplexed me.</p>

<p>"What is there in that look, oh, my Lilian, which tells me that
there is something that startles you,&mdash;something you wish to
confide, and yet shrink from explaining? See how, already, I study
the fair book from which the seal has been lifted! but as yet you
must aid me to construe its language."</p>

<p>"If I shrink from explaining, it is only because I fear that I
cannot explain so as to be understood or believed. But you have a
right to know the secrets of a life which you would link to your
own. Turn your face aside from me; a reproving look, an incredulous
smile, chill&mdash;oh, you cannot guess how they chill me, when I
would approach that which to me is so serious and so solemnly
strange."</p>

<p>I turned my face away, and her voice grew firmer as, after a
brief pause, she resumed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"As far back as I can remember in my infancy, there have been
moments when there seems to fall a soft hazy veil between my sight
and the things around it, thickening and deepening till it has the
likeness of one of those white fleecy clouds which gather on the
verge of the horizon when the air is yet still, but the winds are
about to rise; and then this vapour or veil will suddenly open, as
clouds open, and let in the blue sky."</p>

<p>"Go on," I said gently, for here she came to a stop. She
continued, speaking somewhat more hurriedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then, in that opening, strange appearances present them selves
to me, as in a vision. In my childhood these were chiefly
landscapes of wonderful beauty. I could but faintly describe them
then; I could not attempt to describe them now, for they are almost
gone from my memory. My dear mother chid me for telling her what I
saw, so I did not impress it on my mind by repeating it. As I grew
up, this kind of vision&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash;became much
less frequent, or much less distinct; I still saw the soft veil
fall, the pale cloud form and open, but often what may then have
appeared was entirely forgotten when I recovered myself, waking as
from a sleep. Sometimes, however, the recollection would be vivid
and complete; sometimes I saw the face of my lost father; sometimes
I heard his very voice, as I had seen and heard him in my early
childhood, when he would let me rest for hours beside him as he
mused or studied, happy to be so quietly near him, for I loved him,
oh, so dearly! and I remember him so distinctly, though I was only
in my sixth year when he died. Much more recently&mdash;indeed,
within the last few months&mdash;the images of things to come are
reflected on the space that I gaze into as clearly as in a glass.
Thus, for weeks before I came hither, or knew that such a place
existed, I saw distinctly the old House, yon trees, this sward,
this moss-grown Gothic fount; and, with the sight, an impression
was conveyed to me that in the scene before me my old childlike
life would pass into some solemn change. So that when I came here,
and recognized the picture in my vision, I took an affection for
the spot,&mdash;an affection not without awe, a powerful,
perplexing interest, as one who feels under the influence of a fate
of which a prophetic glimpse has been vouchsafed. And in that
evening, when you first saw me, seated here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lilian, on that evening&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I saw you also, but in my vision&mdash;yonder, far in the deeps
of space,&mdash;and&mdash;and my heart was stirred as it had never
been before; and near where your image grew out from the cloud I
saw my father's face, and I heard his voice, not in my ear, but as
in my heart, whispering&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lilian&mdash;whispering&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"These words,&mdash;only these,&mdash;'Ye will need one
another.' But then, suddenly, between my upward eyes and the two
forms they had beheld, there rose from the earth, obscuring the
skies, a vague, dusky vapour, undulous, and coiling like a vast
serpent,&mdash;nothing, indeed, of its shape and figure definite,
but of its face one abrupt glare; a flash from two dread luminous
eyes, and a young head, like the Medusa's, changing, more rapidly
than I could have drawn breath, into a grinning skull. Then my
terror made me bow my head, and when I raised it again, all that I
had seen was vanished. But the terror still remained, even when I
felt my mother's arm round me and heard her voice. And then, when I
entered the house, and sat down again alone, the recollection of
what I had seen&mdash;those eyes, that face, that skull&mdash;grew
on me stronger and stronger till I fainted, and remember no more,
until my eyes, opening, saw you by my side, and in my wonder there
was not terror. No, a sense of joy, protection, hope, yet still
shadowed by a kind of fear or awe, in recognizing the countenance
which had gleamed on me from the skies before the dark vapour had
risen, and while my father's voice had murmured, 'Ye will need one
another.' And now&mdash;and now&mdash;will you love me less that
you know a secret in my being which I have told to no
other,&mdash;cannot construe to myself? Only&mdash;only, at least,
do not mock me; do not disbelieve me! Nay, turn from me no longer
now: now I ask to meet your eyes. Now, before our hands can join
again, tell me that you do not despise me as untruthful, do not
pity me as insane."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" I said, drawing her to my breast. "Of all you tell
me we will talk hereafter. The scales of our science have no
weights fine enough for the gossamer threads of a maiden's pure
fancies. Enough for me&mdash;for us both&mdash;if out from all such
illusions start one truth, told to you, lovely child, from the
heavens; told to me, ruder man, on the earth; repeated by each
pulse of this heart that woos you to hear and to trust,&mdash;now
and henceforth through life unto death, 'Each has need of the
other,'&mdash;I of you, I of you! my Lilian! my Lilian!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p>In spite of the previous assurance of Mrs. Poyntz, it was not
without an uneasy apprehension that I approached the cedar-tree,
under which Mrs. Ashleigh still sat, her friend beside her. I
looked on the fair creature whose arm was linked in mine. So young,
so singularly lovely, and with all the gifts of birth and fortune
which bend avarice and ambition the more submissively to youth and
beauty, I felt as if I had wronged what a parent might justly deem
her natural lot.</p>

<p>"Oh, if your mother should disapprove!" said I, falteringly.
Lilian leaned on my arm less lightly. "If I had thought so," she
said with her soft blush, "should I be thus by your side?"</p>

<p>So we passed under the boughs of the dark tree, and Lilian left
me and kissed Mrs. Ashleigh's cheek; then, seating herself on the
turf, laid her head on her mother's lap. I looked on the Queen of
the Hill, whose keen eye shot over me. I thought there was a
momentary expression of pain or displeasure on her countenance; but
it passed. Still there seemed to me something of irony, as well as
of triumph or congratulation, in the half-smile with which she
quitted her seat, and in the tone with which she whispered, as she
glided by me to the open sward, "So, then, it is settled."</p>

<p>She walked lightly and quickly down the lawn. When she was out
of sight I breathed more freely. I took the seat which she had
left, by Mrs. Ashleigh's side, and said, "A little while ago I
spoke of myself as a man without kindred, without home, and now I
come to you and ask for both."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh looked at me benignly, then raised her daughter's
face from her lap, and whispered, "Lilian;" and Lilian's lips
moved, but I did not hear her answer. Her mother did. She took
Lilian's hand, simply placed it in mine, and said, "As she chooses,
I choose; whom she loves, I love."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p>From that evening till the day Mrs. Ashleigh and Lilian went on
the dreaded visit, I was always at their house, when my avocations
allowed me to steal to it; and during those few days, the happiest
I had ever known, it seemed to me that years could not have more
deepened my intimacy with Lilian's exquisite nature, made me more
reverential of its purity, or more enamoured of its sweetness. I
could detect in her but one fault, and I rebuked myself for
believing that it was a fault. We see many who neglect the minor
duties of life, who lack watchful forethought and considerate care
for others, and we recognize the cause of this failing in levity or
egotism. Certainly, neither of those tendencies of character could
be ascribed to Lilian. Yet still in daily trifles there was
something of that neglect, some lack of that care and forethought.
She loved her mother with fondness and devotion, yet it never
occurred to her to aid in those petty household cares in which her
mother centred so much of habitual interest. She was full of
tenderness and pity to all want and suffering, yet many a young
lady on the Hill was more actively beneficent,&mdash;visiting the
poor in their sickness, or instructing their children in the Infant
Schools. I was persuaded that her love for me was deep and
truthful; it was clearly void of all ambition; doubtless she would
have borne, unflinching and contented, whatever the world considers
to be a sacrifice and privation,&mdash;yet I should never have
expected her to take her share in the troubles of ordinary life. I
could never have applied to her the homely but significant name of
helpmate. I reproach myself while I write for noticing such
defect&mdash;if defect it were&mdash;in what may be called the
practical routine of our positive, trivial, human existence. No
doubt it was this that had caused Mrs. Poyntz's harsh judgment
against the wisdom of my choice. But such chiller shade upon
Lilian's charming nature was reflected from no inert, unamiable
self-love. It was but the consequence of that self-absorption which
the habit of revery had fostered. I cautiously abstained from all
allusion to those visionary deceptions, which she had confided to
me as the truthful impressions of spirit, if not of sense. To me
any approach to what I termed "superstition" was displeasing; any
indulgence of fantasies not within the measured and beaten track of
healthful imagination more than displeased me in her,&mdash;it
alarmed. I would not by a word encourage her in persuasions which I
felt it would be at present premature to reason against, and cruel
indeed to ridicule. I was convinced that of themselves these mists
round her native intelligence, engendered by a solitary and musing
childhood, would subside in the fuller daylight of wedded life. She
seemed pained when she saw how resolutely I shunned a subject dear
to her thoughts. She made one or two timid attempts to renew it,
but my grave looks sufficed to check her. Once or twice indeed, on
such occasions, she would turn away and leave me, but she soon came
back; that gentle heart could not bear one unkindlier shade between
itself and what it loved. It was agreed that our engagement should
be, for the present, confided only to Mrs. Poyntz. When Mrs.
Ashleigh and Lilian returned, which would be in a few weeks at
furthest, it should be proclaimed; and our marriage could take
place in the autumn, when I should be most free for a brief holiday
from professional toils.</p>

<p>So we parted-as lovers part. I felt none of those jealous fears
which, before we were affianced, had made me tremble at the thought
of separation, and had conjured up irresistible rivals. But it was
with a settled, heavy gloom that I saw her depart. From earth was
gone a glory; from life a blessing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p>During the busy years of my professional career, I had snatched
leisure for some professional treatises, which had made more or
less sensation, and one of them, entitled "The Vital Principle; its
Waste and Supply," had gained a wide circulation among the general
public. This last treatise contained the results of certain
experiments, then new in chemistry, which were adduced in support
of a theory I entertained as to the re-invigoration of the human
system by principles similar to those which Liebig has applied to
the replenishment of an exhausted soil,&mdash;namely, the giving
back to the frame those essentials to its nutrition, which it has
lost by the action or accident of time; or supplying that special
pabulum or energy in which the individual organism is
constitutionally deficient; and neutralizing or counterbalancing
that in which it super-abounds,&mdash;a theory upon which some
eminent physicians have more recently improved with signal success.
But on these essays, slight and suggestive, rather than dogmatic, I
set no value. I had been for the last two years engaged on a work
of much wider range, endeared to me by a far bolder
ambition,&mdash;a work upon which I fondly hoped to found an
enduring reputation as a severe and original physiologist. It was
an Inquiry into Organic Life, similar in comprehensiveness of
survey to that by which the illustrious Muller, of Berlin, has
enriched the science of our age; however inferior, alas! to that
august combination of thought and learning in the judgment which
checks presumption, and the genius which adorns speculation. But at
that day I was carried away by the ardour of composition, and I
admired my performance because I loved my labour. This work had
been entirely laid aside for the last agitated month; now that
Lilian was gone, I resumed it earnestly, as the sole occupation
that had power and charm enough to rouse me from the aching sense
of void and loss.</p>

<p>The very night of the day she went, I reopened my manuscript. I
had left off at the commencement of a chapter Upon Knowledge as
derived from our Senses. As my convictions on this head were
founded on the well-known arguments of Locke and Condillac against
innate ideas, and on the reasonings by which Hume has resolved the
combination of sensations into a general idea to an impulse arising
merely out of habit, so I set myself to oppose, as a dangerous
concession to the sentimentalities or mysticism of a
pseudo-philosophy, the doctrine favoured by most of our recent
physiologists, and of which some of the most eminent of German
metaphysicians have accepted the substance, though refining into a
subtlety its positive form,&mdash;I mean the doctrine which Muller
himself has expressed in these words:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "That innate ideas may exist cannot in the slightest degree be denied:
    it is, indeed, a fact.  All the ideas of animals, which are induced by
    instinct, are innate and immediate: something presented to the mind, a
    desire to attain which is at the same time given.  The new-born lamb
    and foal have such innate ideas, which lead them to follow their
    mother and suck the teats.  Is it not in some measure the same with
    the intellectual ideas of man?" (1)
</pre>

<p>To this question I answered with an indignant "No!" A "Yes"
would have shaken my creed of materialism to the dust. I wrote on
rapidly, warmly. I defined the properties and meted the limits of
natural laws, which I would not admit that a Deity himself could
alter. I clamped and soldered dogma to dogma in the links of my
tinkered logic, till out from my page, to my own complacent eye,
grew Intellectual Man, as the pure formation of his material
senses; mind, or what is called soul, born from and nurtured by
them alone; through them to act, and to perish with the machine
they moved. Strange, that at the very time my love for Lilian might
have taught me that there are mysteries in the core of the feelings
which my analysis of ideas could not solve, I should so stubbornly
have opposed as unreal all that could be referred to the spiritual!
Strange, that at the very time when the thought that I might lose
from this life the being I had known scarce a month had just before
so appalled me, I should thus complacently sit down to prove that,
according to the laws of the nature which my passion obeyed, I must
lose for eternity the blessing I now hoped I had won to my life!
But how distinctly dissimilar is man in his conduct from man in his
systems! See the poet reclined under forest boughs, conning odes to
his mistress; follow him out into the world; no mistress ever lived
for him there!(2) See the hard man of science, so austere in his
passionless problems; follow him now where the brain rests from its
toil, where the heart finds its Sabbath&mdash;what child is so
tender, so yielding, and soft?</p>

<p>But I had proved to my own satisfaction that poet and sage are
dust, and no more, when the pulse ceases to beat. And on that
consolatory conclusion my pen stopped.</p>

<p>Suddenly, beside me I distinctly heard a sigh,&mdash;a
compassionate, mournful sigh. The sound was unmistakable. I started
from my seat, looked round, amazed to discover no one,&mdash;no
living thing! The windows were closed, the night was still. That
sigh was not the wail of the wind. But there, in the darker angle
of the room, what was that? A silvery whiteness, vaguely shaped as
a human form, receding, fading, gone! Why, I know not&mdash;for no
face was visible, no form, if form it were, more distinct than the
colourless outline,&mdash;why, I know not, but I cried aloud,
"Lilian! Lilian!" My voice came strangely back to my own ear; I
paused, then smiled and blushed at my folly. "So I, too, have
learned what is superstition," I muttered to myself. "And here is
an anecdote at my own expense (as Muller frankly tells us anecdotes
of the illusions which would haunt his eyes, shut or
open),&mdash;an anecdote I may quote when I come to my chapter on
the Cheats of the Senses and Spectral Phantasms." I went on with my
book, and wrote till the lights waned in the gray of the dawn. And
I said then, in the triumph of my pride, as I laid myself down to
rest, "I have written that which allots with precision man's place
in the region of nature; written that which will found a school,
form disciples; and race after race of those who cultivate truth
through pure reason shall accept my bases if they enlarge my
building." And again I heard the sigh, but this time it caused no
surprise. "Certainly," I murmured, "a very strange thing is the
nervous system!" So I turned on my pillow, and, wearied out, fell
asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p>The next day, the last of the visiting patients to whom my
forenoons were devoted had just quitted me, when I was summoned in
haste to attend the steward of a Sir Philip Derval not residing at
his family seat, which was about five miles from L&mdash;&mdash;.
It was rarely indeed that persons so far from the town, when of no
higher rank than this applicant, asked my services.</p>

<p>But it was my principle to go wherever I was summoned; my
profession was not gain, it was healing, to which gain was the
incident, not the essential. This case the messenger reported as
urgent. I went on horseback, and rode fast; but swiftly as I
cantered through the village that skirted the approach to Sir
Philip Derval's park, the evident care bestowed on the
accommodation of the cottagers forcibly struck me. I felt that I
was on the lands of a rich, intelligent, and beneficent proprietor.
Entering the park, and passing before the manor-house, the contrast
between the neglect and the decay of the absentee's stately Hall
and the smiling homes of his villagers was disconsolately
mournful.</p>

<p>An imposing pile, built apparently by Vanbrugh, with decorated
pilasters, pompous portico, and grand perron (or double flight of
stairs to the entrance), enriched with urns and statues, but
discoloured, mildewed, chipped, half-hidden with unpruned creepers
and ivy. Most of the windows were closed with shutters, decaying
for want of paint; in some of the casements the panes were broken;
the peacock perched on the shattered balustrade, that fenced a
garden overgrown with weeds. The sun glared hotly on the place, and
made its ruinous condition still more painfully apparent. I was
glad when a winding in the park-road shut the house from my sight.
Suddenly I emerged through a copse of ancient yew-trees, and before
me there gleamed, in abrupt whiteness, a building evidently
designed for the family mausoleum, classical in its outline, with
the blind iron door niched into stone walls of massive thickness,
and surrounded by a funereal garden of roses and evergreens, fenced
with an iron rail, party-gilt.</p>

<p>The suddenness with which this House of the Dead came upon me
heightened almost into pain, if not into awe, the dismal impression
which the aspect of the deserted home in its neighbourhood had
made. I spurred my horse, and soon arrived at the door of my
patient, who lived in a fair brick house at the other extremity of
the park.</p>

<p>I found my patient, a man somewhat advanced in years, but of a
robust conformation, in bed: he had been seized with a fit, which
was supposed to be apoplectic, a few hours before; but was already
sensible, and out of immediate danger. After I had prescribed a few
simple remedies, I took aside the patient's wife, and went with her
to the parlour below stairs, to make some inquiry about her
husband's ordinary regimen and habits of life. These seemed
sufficiently regular; I could discover no apparent cause for the
attack, which presented symptoms not familiar to my experience.
"Has your husband ever had such fits before?"</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>"Had he experienced any sudden emotion? Had he heard any
unexpected news; or had anything happened to put him out?"</p>

<p>The woman looked much disturbed at these inquiries. I pressed
them more urgently. At last she burst into tears, and clasping my
hand, said, "Oh, doctor, I ought to tell you&mdash;I sent for you
on purpose&mdash;yet I fear you will not believe me: my good man
has seen a ghost!"</p>

<p>"A ghost!" said I, repressing a smile. "Well, tell me all, that
I may prevent the ghost coming again."</p>

<p>The woman's story was prolix. Its substance was this. Her
husband, habitually an early riser, had left his bed that morning
still earlier than usual, to give directions about some cattle that
were to be sent for sale to a neighbouring fair. An hour afterwards
he had been found by a shepherd, near the mausoleum, apparently
lifeless. On being removed to his own house, he had recovered
speech, and bidding all except his wife leave the room, he then
told her that on walking across the park towards the cattle-sheds,
he had seen what appeared to him at first a pale light by the iron
door of the mausoleum. On approaching nearer, this light changed
into the distinct and visible form of his master, Sir Philip
Derval, who was then abroad,&mdash;supposed to be in the East,
where he had resided for many years. The impression on the
steward's mind was so strong, that he called out, "Oh, Sir Philip!"
when looking still more intently, he perceived that the face was
that of a corpse. As he continued to gaze, the apparition seemed
gradually to recede, as if vanishing into the sepulchre itself. He
knew no more; he became unconscious. It was the excess of the poor
woman's alarm, on hearing this strange tale, that made her resolve
to send for me instead of the parish apothecary. She fancied so
astounding a cause for her husband's seizure could only be properly
dealt with by some medical man reputed to have more than ordinary
learning; and the steward himself objected to the apothecary in the
immediate neighbourhood, as more likely to annoy him by gossip than
a physician from a comparative distance.</p>

<p>I took care not to lose the confidence of the good wife by
parading too quickly my disbelief in the phantom her husband
declared that he had seen; but as the story itself seemed at once
to decide the nature of the fit to be epileptic, I began to tell
her of similar delusions which, in my experience, had occurred to
those subjected to epilepsy, and finally soothed her into the
conviction that the apparition was clearly reducible to natural
causes. Afterwards, I led her on to talk about Sir Philip Derval,
less from any curiosity I felt about the absent proprietor than
from a desire to re-familiarize her own mind to his image as a
living man. The steward had been in the service of Sir Philip's
father, and had known Sir Philip himself from a child. He was
warmly attached to his master, whom the old woman described as a
man of rare benevolence and great eccentricity, which last she
imputed to his studious habits. He had succeeded to the title and
estates as a minor. For the first few years after attaining his
majority, he had mixed much in the world. When at Derval Court his
house had been filled with gay companions, and was the scene of
lavish hospitality; but the estate was not in proportion to the
grandeur of the mansion, still less to the expenditure of the
owner. He had become greatly embarrassed; and some love
disappointment (so it was rumoured) occurring simultaneously with
his pecuniary difficulties, he had suddenly changed his way of
life, shut himself up from his old friends, lived in seclusion,
taking to books and scientific pursuits, and as the old woman said
vaguely and expressively, "to odd ways." He had gradually by an
economy that, towards himself, was penurious, but which did not
preclude much judicious generosity to others, cleared off his
debts; and, once more rich, he had suddenly quitted the country,
and taken to a life of travel. He was now about forty-eight years
old, and had been eighteen years abroad. He wrote frequently to his
steward, giving him minute and thoughtful instructions in regard to
the employment, comforts, and homes of the peasantry, but
peremptorily ordering him to spend no money on the grounds and
mansion, stating as a reason why the latter might be allowed to
fall into decay, his intention to pull it down whenever he returned
to England.</p>

<p>I stayed some time longer than my engagements well warranted at
my patient's house, not leaving till the sufferer, after a quiet
sleep, had removed from his bed to his armchair, taken food, and
seemed perfectly recovered from his attack.</p>

<p>Riding homeward, I mused on the difference that education makes,
even pathologically, between man and man. Here was a brawny
inhabitant of rural fields, leading the healthiest of lives, not
conscious of the faculty we call imagination, stricken down almost
to Death's door by his fright at an optical illusion, explicable,
if examined, by the same simple causes which had impressed me the
night before with a moment's belief in a sound and a
spectre,&mdash;me who, thanks to sublime education, went so quietly
to sleep a few minutes after, convinced that no phantom, the
ghostliest that ear ever heard or eye ever saw, can be anything
else but a nervous phenomenon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p>That evening I went to Mrs. Poyntz's; it was one of her ordinary
"reception nights," and I felt that she would naturally expect my
attendance as "a proper attention."</p>

<p>I joined a group engaged in general conversation, of which Mrs.
Poyntz herself made the centre, knitting as usual,&mdash;rapidly
while she talked, slowly when she listened.</p>

<p>Without mentioning the visit I had paid that morning, I turned
the conversation on the different country places in the
neighbourhood, and then incidentally asked, "What sort of a man is
Sir Philip Derval? Is it not strange that he should suffer so fine
a place to fall into decay?" The answers I received added little to
the information I had already obtained. Mrs. Poyntz knew nothing of
Sir Philip Derval, except as a man of large estates, whose rental
had been greatly increased by a rise in the value of property he
possessed in the town of L&mdash;&mdash;, and which lay contiguous
to that of her husband. Two or three of the older inhabitants of
the Hill had remembered Sir Philip in his early days, when he was
gay, high-spirited, hospitable, lavish. One observed that the only
person in L&mdash;&mdash; whom he had admitted to his subsequent
seclusion was Dr. Lloyd, who was then without practice, and whom he
had employed as an assistant in certain chemical experiments.</p>

<pre>
Here a gentleman struck into the conversation. He was a stranger to
me and to L&mdash;&mdash;, a visitor to one of the dwellers on the Hill, who had
asked leave to present him to its queen as a great traveller and an
accomplished antiquary.

 Said this gentleman: "Sir Philip Derval?  I know him.  I met him in the
East. He was then still, I believe, very fond of chemical science; a
clever, odd, philanthropical man; had studied medicine, or at least
practised it; was said to have made many marvellous cures. I became
acquainted with him in Aleppo. He had come to that town, not much
frequented by English travellers, in order to inquire into the murder of
two men, of whom one was his friend and the other his countryman."

</pre>

<p>"This is interesting," said Mrs. Poyntz, dryly. "We who live on
this innocent Hill all love stories of crime; murder is the
pleasantest subject you could have hit on. Pray give us the
details."</p>

<p>"So encouraged," said the traveller, good-humouredly, "I will
not hesitate to communicate the little I know. In Aleppo there had
lived for some years a man who was held by the natives in great
reverence. He had the reputation of extraordinary wisdom, but was
difficult of access; the lively imagination of the Orientals
invested his character with the fascinations of fable,&mdash;in
short, Haroun of Aleppo was popularly considered a magician. Wild
stories were told of his powers, of his preternatural age, of his
hoarded treasures. Apart from such disputable titles to homage,
there seemed no question, from all I heard, that his learning was
considerable, his charities extensive, his manner of life
irreproachably ascetic. He appears to have resembled those Arabian
sages of the Gothic age to whom modern science is largely
indebted,&mdash;a mystic enthusiast, but an earnest scholar. A
wealthy and singular Englishman, long resident in another part of
the East, afflicted by some languishing disease, took a journey to
Aleppo to consult this sage, who, among his other acquirements, was
held to have discovered rare secrets in medicine,&mdash;his
countrymen said in 'charms.' One morning, not long after the
Englishman's arrival, Haroun was found dead in his bed, apparently
strangled, and the Englishman, who lodged in another part of the
town, had disappeared; but some of his clothes, and a crutch on
which he habitually supported himself, were found a few miles
distant from Aleppo, near the roadside. There appeared no doubt
that he, too, had been murdered, but his corpse could not be
discovered. Sir Philip Derval had been a loving disciple of this
Sage of Aleppo, to whom he assured me he owed not only that
knowledge of medicine which, by report, Sir Philip possessed, but
the insight into various truths of nature, on the promulgation of
which, it was evident, Sir Philip cherished the ambition to found a
philosophical celebrity for himself."</p>

<p>"Of what description were those truths of nature?" I asked,
somewhat sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Sir, I am unable to tell you, for Sir Philip did not inform me,
nor did I much care to ask; for what may be revered as truths in
Asia are usually despised as dreams in Europe. To return to my
story: Sir Philip had been in Aleppo a little time before the
murder; had left the Englishman under the care of Haroun. He
returned to Aleppo on hearing the tragic events I have related, and
was busy in collecting such evidence as could be gleaned, and
instituting inquiries after our missing countryman at the time I
myself chanced to arrive in the city. I assisted in his researches,
but without avail. The assassins remained undiscovered. I do not
myself doubt that they were mere vulgar robbers. Sir Philip had a
darker suspicion of which he made no secret to me; but as I confess
that I thought the suspicion groundless, you will pardon me if I do
not repeat it. Whether since I left the East the Englishman's
remains have been discovered, I know not. Very probably; for I
understand that his heirs have got hold of what fortune he
left,&mdash;less than was generally supposed. But it was reported
that he had buried great treasures, a rumour, however absurd, not
altogether inconsistent with his character."</p>

<p>"What was his character?" asked Mrs. Poyntz.</p>

<p>"One of evil and sinister repute. He was regarded with terror by
the attendants who had accompanied him to Aleppo. But he had lived
in a very remote part of the East, little known to Europeans, and,
from all I could learn, had there established an extraordinary
power, strengthened by superstitious awe. He was said to have
studied deeply that knowledge which the philosophers of old called
'occult,' not, like the Sage of Aleppo, for benevolent, but for
malignant ends. He was accused of conferring with evil spirits, and
filling his barbaric court (for he lived in a kind of savage
royalty) with charmers and sorcerers. I suspect, after all, that he
was only, like myself, an ardent antiquary, and cunningly made use
of the fear he inspired in order to secure his authority, and
prosecute in safety researches into ancient sepulchres or temples.
His great passion was, indeed, in excavating such remains, in his
neighbourhood; with what result I know not, never having penetrated
so far into regions infested by robbers and pestiferous with
malaria. He wore the Eastern dress, and always carried jewels about
him. I came to the conclusion that for the sake of these jewels he
was murdered, perhaps by some of his own servants (and, indeed, two
at least of his suite were missing), who then at once buried his
body, and kept their own secret. He was old, very infirm; could
never have got far from the town without assistance."</p>

<p>"You have not yet told us his name," said Mrs. Poyntz.</p>

<p>"His name was Grayle."</p>

<p>"Grayle!" exclaimed Mrs. Poyntz, dropping her work. "Louis
Grayle?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Louis Grayle. You could not have known him?"</p>

<p>"Known him! No; but I have often heard my father speak of him.
Such, then, was the tragic end of that strong dark creature, for
whom, as a young girl in the nursery, I used to feel a kind of
fearful admiring interest?"</p>

<p>"It is your turn to narrate now," said the traveller.</p>

<p>And we all drew closer round our hostess, who remained silent
some moments, her brow thoughtful, her work suspended.</p>

<p>"Well," said she at last, looking round us with a lofty air,
which seemed half defying, "force and courage are always
fascinating, even when they are quite in the wrong. I go with the
world, because the world goes with me; if it did not&mdash;" Here
she stopped for a moment, clenched the firm white hand, and then
scornfully waved it, left the sentence unfinished, and broke into
another.</p>

<p>"Going with the world, of course we must march over those who
stand against it. But when one man stands single-handed against our
march, we do not despise him; it is enough to crush. I am very glad
I did not see Louis Grayle when I was a girl of sixteen." Again she
paused a moment, and resumed: "Louis Grayle was the only son of a
usurer, infamous for the rapacity with which he had acquired
enormous wealth. Old Grayle desired to rear his heir as a
gentleman; sent him to Eton. Boys are always aristocratic; his
birth was soon thrown in his teeth; he was fierce; he struck boys
bigger than himself,&mdash;fought till he was half killed. My
father was at school with him; described him as a tiger-whelp. One
day he&mdash;still a fag&mdash;struck a sixth-form boy. Sixth-form
boys do not fight fags; they punish them. Louis Grayle was ordered
to hold out his hand to the cane; he received the blow, drew forth
his schoolboy knife, and stabbed the punisher. After that, he left
Eton. I don't think he was publicly expelled&mdash;too mere a child
for that honour&mdash;but he was taken or sent away; educated with
great care under the first masters at home. When he was of age to
enter the University, old Grayle was dead. Louis was sent by his
guardians to Cambridge, with acquirements far exceeding the average
of young men, and with unlimited command of money. My father was at
the same college, and described him again,&mdash;haughty,
quarrelsome, reckless, handsome, aspiring, brave. Does that kind of
creature interest you, my dears?" (appealing to the ladies).</p>

<p>"La!" said Miss Brabazon; "a horrid usurer's son!"</p>

<p>"Ay, true; the vulgar proverb says it is good to be born with a
silver spoon in one's mouth: so it is when one has one's own family
crest on it; but when it is a spoon on which people recognize their
family crest, and cry out, 'Stolen from our plate chest,' it is a
heritage that outlaws a babe in his cradle. However, young men at
college who want money are less scrupulous about descent than boys
at Eton are. Louis Grayle found, while at college, plenty of
wellborn acquaintances willing to recover from him some of the
plunder his father had extorted from theirs. He was too wild to
distinguish himself by academical honours, but my father said that
the tutors of the college declared there were not six
undergraduates in the University who knew as much hard and dry
science as wild Louis Grayle. He went into the world, no doubt,
hoping to shine; but his father's name was too notorious to admit
the son into good society. The Polite World, it is true, does not
examine a scutcheon with the nice eye of a herald, nor look upon
riches with the stately contempt of a stoic; still the Polite World
has its family pride and its moral sentiment. It does not like to
be cheated,&mdash;I mean, in money matters; and when the son of a
man who has emptied its purse and foreclosed on its acres rides by
its club-windows, hand on haunch, and head in the air, no lion has
a scowl more awful, no hyena a laugh more dread, than that same
easy, good-tempered, tolerant, polite, well-bred World which is so
pleasant an acquaintance, so languid a friend, and&mdash;so
remorseless an&mdash;enemy. In short, Louis Grayle claimed the
right to be courted,&mdash;he was shunned; to be admired,&mdash;he
was loathed. Even his old college acquaintances were shamed out of
knowing him. Perhaps he could have lived through all this had he
sought to glide quietly into position; but he wanted the tact of
the well-bred, and strove to storm his way, not to steal it.
Reduced for companions to needy parasites, he braved and he shocked
all decorous opinion by that ostentation of excess, which made
Richelieus and Lauzuns the rage. But then Richelieus and Lauzuns
were dukes! He now very naturally took the Polite World into
hate,&mdash;gave it scorn for scorn. He would ally himself with
Democracy; his wealth could not get him into a club, but it would
buy him into parliament; he could not be a Lauzun, nor, perhaps, a
Mirabeau, but he might be a Danton. He had plenty of knowledge and
audacity, and with knowledge and audacity a good hater is sure to
be eloquent. Possibly, then, this poor Louis Grayle might have made
a great figure, left his mark on his age and his name in history;
but in contesting the borough, which he was sure to carry, he had
to face an opponent in a real fine gentleman whom his father had
ruined, cool and highbred, with a tongue like a rapier, a sneer
like an adder. A quarrel of course; Louis Grayle sent a challenge.
The fine gentleman, known to be no coward (fine gentlemen never
are), was at first disposed to refuse with contempt. But Grayle had
made himself the idol of the mob; and at a word from Grayle, the
fine gentleman might have been ducked at a pump, or tossed in a
blanket,&mdash;that would have made him ridiculous; to be shot at
is a trifle, to be laughed at is serious. He therefore condescended
to accept the challenge, and my father was his second.</p>

<p>"It was settled, of course, according to English custom, that
both combatants should fire at the same time, and by signal. The
antagonist fired at the right moment; his ball grazed Louis
Grayle's temple. Louis Grayle had not fired. He now seemed to the
seconds to take slow and deliberate aim. They called out to him not
to fire; they were rushing to prevent him, when the trigger was
pulled, and his opponent fell dead on the field. The fight was,
therefore, considered unfair; Louis Grayle was tried for his life:
he did not stand the trial in person.(1) He escaped to the
Continent; hurried on to some distant uncivilized lands; could not
be traced; reappeared in England no more. The lawyer who conducted
his defence pleaded skilfully. He argued that the delay in firing
was not intentional, therefore not criminal,&mdash;the effect of
the stun which the wound in the temple had occasioned. The judge
was a gentleman, and summed up the evidence so as to direct the
jury to a verdict against the low wretch who had murdered a
gentleman; but the jurors were not gentlemen, and Grayle's advocate
had of course excited their sympathy for a son of the people, whom
a gentleman had wantonly insulted. The verdict was manslaughter;
but the sentence emphatically marked the aggravated nature of the
homicide,&mdash;three years' imprisonment. Grayle eluded the
prison, but he was a man disgraced and an exile,&mdash;his ambition
blasted, his career an outlaw's, and his age not yet twenty-three.
My father said that he was supposed to have changed his name; none
knew what had become of him. And so this creature, brilliant and
daring, whom if born under better auspices we might now be all
fawning on, cringing to,&mdash;after living to old age, no one
knows how,&mdash;dies murdered at Aleppo, no one, you say, knows by
whom."</p>

<p>"I saw some account of his death in the papers about three years
ago," said one of the party; "but the name was misspelled, and I
had no idea that it was the same man who had fought the duel which
Mrs. Colonel Poyntz has so graphically described. I have a very
vague recollection of the trial; it took place when I was a boy,
more than forty years since. The affair made a stir at the time,
but was soon forgotten."</p>

<p>"Soon forgotten," said Mrs. Poyntz; "ay, what is not? Leave your
place in the world for ten minutes, and when you come back somebody
else has taken it; but when you leave the world for good, who
remembers that you had ever a place even in the parish
register?"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said I, "a great poet has said, finely and
truly,</p>

<pre>
   "'The sun of Homer shines upon us still.'"

</pre>

<p>"But it does not shine upon Homer; and learned folks tell me
that we know no more who and what Homer was, if there was ever a
single Homer at all, or rather, a whole herd of Homers, than we
know about the man in the moon,&mdash;if there be one man there, or
millions of men. Now, my dear Miss Brabazon, it will be very kind
in you to divert our thoughts into channels less gloomy. Some
pretty French air&mdash;Dr. Fenwick, I have something to say to
you." She drew me towards the window. "So Annie Ashleigh writes me
word that I am not to mention your engagement. Do you think it
quite prudent to keep it a secret?"</p>

<p>"I do not see how prudence is concerned in keeping it secret one
way or the other,&mdash;it is a mere matter of feeling. Most people
wish to abridge, as far as they can, the time in which their
private arrangements are the topic of public gossip."</p>

<p>"Public gossip is sometimes the best security for the due
completion of private arrangements. As long as a girl is not known
to be engaged, her betrothed must be prepared for rivals. Announce
the engagement, and rivals are warned off."</p>

<p>"I fear no rivals."</p>

<p>"Do you not? Bold man! I suppose you will write to Lilian?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Do so, and constantly. By-the-way, Mrs. Ashleigh, before she
went, asked me to send her back Lady Haughton's letter of
invitation. What for,&mdash;to show to you?"</p>

<p>"Very likely. Have you the letter still? May I see it?"</p>

<p>"Not just at present. When Lilian or Mrs. Ashleigh writes to
you, come and tell me how they like their visit, and what other
guests form the party."</p>

<p>Therewith she turned away and conversed apart with the
traveller.</p>

<p>Her words disquieted me, and I felt that they were meant to do
so, wherefore I could not guess. But there is no language on earth
which has more words with a double meaning than that spoken by the
Clever Woman, who is never so guarded as when she appears to be
frank.</p>

<p>As I walked home thoughtfully, I was accosted by a young man,
the son of one of the wealthiest merchants in the town. I had
attended him with success some months before, in a rheumatic fever:
he and his family were much attached to me.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Fenwick, I am so glad to see you; I owe you an
obligation of which you are not aware,&mdash;an exceedingly
pleasant travelling-companion. I came with him to-day from London,
where I have been sight-seeing and holidaymaking for the last
fortnight."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean that you kindly bring me a patient?"</p>

<p>"No, only an admirer. I was staying at Fenton's Hotel. It so
happened one day that I had left in the coffee-room your last work
on the Vital Principle, which, by the by, the bookseller assures me
is selling immensely among readers as non-professional as myself.
Coming into the coffee-room again, I found a gentleman reading the
book. I claimed it politely; he as politely tendered his excuse for
taking it. We made acquaintance on the spot. The next day we were
intimate. He expressed great interest and curiosity about your
theory and your experiments. I told him I knew you. You may guess
if I described you as less clever in your practice than you are in
your writings; and, in short, he came with me to L&mdash;&mdash;,
partly to see our flourishing town, principally on my promise to
introduce him to you. My mother, you know, has what she calls a
dejeuner tomorrow,&mdash;dejeuner and dance. You will be
there?"</p>

<p>"Thank you for reminding me of her invitation. I will avail
myself of it if I can. Your new friend will be present? Who and
what is he,&mdash;a medical student?"</p>

<p>"No, a mere gentleman at ease, but seems to have a good deal of
general information. Very young, apparently very rich, wonderfully
good-looking. I am sure you will like him; everybody must."</p>

<p>"It is quite enough to prepare me to like him that he is a
friend of yours." And so we shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>(1) Mrs. Poyntz here makes a mistake in law which, though very
evident, her listeners do not seem to have noticed. Her mistake
will be referred to later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of the following day before I was
able to join the party assembled at the merchant's house; it was a
villa about two miles out of the town, pleasantly situated amidst
flower-gardens celebrated in the neighbourhood for their beauty.
The breakfast had been long over; the company was scattered over
the lawn,&mdash;some formed into a dance on the smooth lawn; some
seated under shady awnings; others gliding amidst parterres, in
which all the glow of colour took a glory yet more vivid under the
flush of a brilliant sunshine; and the ripple of a soft western
breeze. Music, loud and lively, mingled with the laughter of happy
children, who formed much the larger number of the party.</p>

<p>Standing at the entrance of an arched trellis, that led from the
hardier flowers of the lawn to a rare collection of tropical plants
under a lofty glass dome (connecting, as it were, the familiar
vegetation of the North with that of the remotest East), was a form
that instantaneously caught and fixed my gaze. The entrance of the
arcade was covered with parasite creepers, in prodigal luxuriance,
of variegated gorgeous tints,&mdash;scarlet, golden, purple; and
the form, an idealized picture of man's youth fresh from the hand
of Nature, stood literally in a frame of blooms.</p>

<p>Never have I seen human face so radiant as that young man's.
There was in the aspect an indescribable something that literally
dazzled. As one continued to gaze, it was with surprise; one was
forced to acknowledge that in the features themselves there was no
faultless regularity; nor was the young man's stature imposing,
about the middle height. But the effect of the whole was not less
transcendent. Large eyes, unspeakably lustrous; a most harmonious
colouring; an expression of contagious animation and joyousness;
and the form itself so critically fine, that the welded strength of
its sinews was best shown in the lightness and grace of its
movements.</p>

<p>He was resting one hand carelessly on the golden locks of a
child that had nestled itself against his knees, looking up to his
face in that silent loving wonder with which children regard
something too strangely beautiful for noisy admiration; he himself
was conversing with the host, an old gray-haired, gouty man,
propped on his crutched stick, and listening with a look of
mournful envy. To the wealth of the old man all the flowers in that
garden owed their renewed delight in the summer air and sun. Oh,
that his wealth could renew to himself one hour of the youth whose
incarnation stood beside him, Lord, indeed, of Creation; its
splendour woven into his crown of beauty, its enjoyments subject to
his sceptre of hope and gladness.</p>

<p>I was startled by the hearty voice of the merchant's son. "Ah,
my dear Fenwick, I was afraid you would not come,&mdash;you are
late. There is the new friend of whom I spoke to you last night;
let me now make you acquainted with him." He drew my arm in his,
and led me up to the young man, where he stood under the arching
flowers, and whom he then introduced to me by the name of
Margrave.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more frankly cordial than Mr. Margrave's
manner. In a few minutes I found myself conversing with him
familiarly, as if we had been reared in the same home, and sported
together in the same playground. His vein of talk was peculiar,
off-hand, careless, shifting from topic to topic with a bright
rapidity.</p>

<p>He said that he liked the place; proposed to stay in it some
weeks; asked my address, which I gave to him; promised to call soon
at an early hour, while my time was yet free from professional
visits. I endeavoured, when I went away, to analyze to myself the
fascination which this young stranger so notably exercised over all
who approached him; and it seemed to me, ever seeking to find
material causes for all moral effects, that it rose from the
contagious vitality of that rarest of all rare gifts in
highly-civilized circles,&mdash;perfect health; that health which
is in itself the most exquisite luxury; which, finding happiness in
the mere sense of existence, diffuses round it, like an atmosphere,
the harmless hilarity of its bright animal being. Health, to the
utmost perfection, is seldom known after childhood; health to the
utmost cannot be enjoyed by those who overwork the brain, or admit
the sure wear and tear of the passions. The creature I had just
seen gave me the notion of youth in the golden age of the
poets,&mdash;the youth of the careless Arcadian, before nymph or
shepherdess had vexed his heart with a sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p>The house I occupied at L&mdash;&mdash; was a quaint,
old-fashioned building, a corner-house. One side, in which was the
front entrance, looked upon a street which, as there were no shops
in it, and it was no direct thoroughfare to the busy centres of the
town, was always quiet, and at some hours of the day almost
deserted. The other side of the house fronted a lane; opposite to
it was the long and high wall of the garden to a Young Ladies'
Boarding-school. My stables adjoined the house, abutting on a row
of smaller buildings, with little gardens before them, chiefly
occupied by mercantile clerks and retired tradesmen. By the lane
there was a short and ready access both to the high turnpike-road,
and to some pleasant walks through green meadows and along the
banks of a river.</p>

<p>This house I had inhabited since my arrival at L&mdash;&mdash;,
and it had to me so many attractions, in a situation sufficiently
central to be convenient for patients, and yet free from noise, and
favourable to ready outlet into the country for such foot or horse
exercise as my professional avocations would allow me to carve for
myself out of what the Latin poet calls the "solid day," that I had
refused to change it for one better suited to my increased income;
but it was not a house which Mrs. Ashleigh would have liked for
Lilian. The main objection to it in the eyes of the "genteel" was,
that it had formerly belonged to a member of the healing profession
who united the shop of an apothecary to the diploma of a surgeon;
but that shop had given the house a special attraction to me; for
it had been built out on the side of the house which fronted the
lane, occupying the greater portion of a small gravel court, fenced
from the road by a low iron palisade, and separated from the body
of the house itself by a short and narrow corridor that
communicated with the entrance-hall. This shop I turned into a rude
study for scientific experiments, in which I generally spent some
early hours of the morning, before my visiting patients began to
arrive. I enjoyed the stillness of its separation from the rest of
the house; I enjoyed the glimpse of the great chestnut-trees, which
overtopped the wall of the school-garden; I enjoyed the ease with
which, by opening the glazed sash-door, I could get out, if
disposed for a short walk, into the pleasant fields; and so
completely had I made this sanctuary my own, that not only my
man-servant knew that I was never to be disturbed when in it,
except by the summons of a patient, but even the housemaid was
forbidden to enter it with broom or duster, except upon special
invitation. The last thing at night, before retiring to rest, it
was the man-servant's business to see that the sash-window was
closed, and the gate to the iron palisade locked; but during the
daytime I so often went out of the house by that private way that
the gate was then very seldom locked, nor the sash-door bolted from
within. In the town of L&mdash;&mdash; there was little
apprehension of house-robberies,&mdash;especially in the
daylight,&mdash;and certainly in this room, cut off from the main
building, there was nothing to attract a vulgar cupidity. A few of
the apothecary's shelves and cases still remained on the walls,
with, here and there, a bottle of some chemical preparation for
experiment; two or three worm-eaten, wooden chairs; two or three
shabby old tables; an old walnut-tree bureau without a lock, into
which odds and ends were confusedly thrust, and sundry ugly-looking
inventions of mechanical science, were, assuredly, not the articles
which a timid proprietor would guard with jealous care from the
chances of robbery. It will be seen later why I have been thus
prolix in description. The morning after I had met the young
stranger by whom I had been so favourably impressed, I was up as
usual, a little before the sun, and long before any of my servants
were astir. I went first into the room I have mentioned, and which
I shall henceforth designate as my study, opened the window,
unlocked the gate, and sauntered for some minutes up and down the
silent lane skirting the opposite wall, and overhung by the
chestnut-trees rich in the garniture of a glorious summer; then,
refreshed for work, I re-entered my study, and was soon absorbed in
the examination of that now well-known machine, which was then, to
me at least, a novelty,&mdash;invented, if I remember right, by
Dubois-Reymond, so distinguished by his researches into the
mysteries of organic electricity. It is a wooden cylinder fixed
against the edge of a table; on the table two vessels filled with
salt and water are so placed that, as you close your hands on the
cylinder, the forefinger of each hand can drop into the water; each
of the vessels has a metallic plate, and communicates by wires with
a galvanometer with its needle. Now the theory is, that if you
clutch the cylinder firmly with the right hand, leaving the left
perfectly passive, the needle in the galvanometer will move from
west to south; if, in like manner, you exert the left arm, leaving
the right arm passive, the needle will deflect from west to north.
Hence, it is argued that the electric current is induced through
the agency of the nervous system, and that, as human Will produces
the muscular contraction requisite, so is it human Will that causes
the deflection of the needle. I imagine that if this theory were
substantiated by experiment, the discovery might lead to some
sublime and unconjectured secrets of science. For human Will, thus
actively effective on the electric current, and all matter, animate
or inanimate, having more or less of electricity, a vast field
became opened to conjecture. By what series of patient experimental
deduction might not science arrive at the solution of problems
which the Newtonian law of gravitation does not suffice to solve;
and&mdash;But here I halt. At the date which my story has reached,
my mind never lost itself long in the Cloudland of Guess.</p>

<p>I was dissatisfied with my experiment. The needle stirred,
indeed, but erratically, and not in directions which, according to
the theory, should correspond to my movement. I was about to
dismiss the trial with some uncharitable contempt of the foreign
philosopher's dogmas, when I heard a loud ring at my street-door.
While I paused to conjecture whether my servant was yet up to
attend to the door, and which of my patients was the most likely to
summon me at so unseasonable an hour, a shadow darkened my window.
I looked up, and to my astonishment beheld the brilliant face of
Mr. Margrave. The sash to the door was already partially opened; he
raised it higher, and walked into the room. "Was it you who rang at
the street-door, and at this hour?" said I.</p>

<p>"Yes; and observing, after I had rung, that all the shutters
were still closed, I felt ashamed of my own rash action, and made
off rather than brave the reproachful face of some injured
housemaid, robbed of her morning dreams. I turned down that pretty
lane,&mdash;lured by the green of the chestnut-trees,&mdash;caught
sight of you through the window, took courage, and here I am! You
forgive me?" While thus speaking, he continued to move along the
littered floor of the dingy room, with the undulating restlessness
of some wild animal in the confines of its den, and he now went on,
in short fragmentary sentences, very slightly linked together, but
smoothed, as it were, into harmony by a voice musical and fresh as
a sky lark's warble. "Morning dreams, indeed! dreams that waste the
life of such a morning. Rosy magnificence of a summer dawn! Do you
not pity the fool who prefers to lie a bed, and to dream rather
than to live? What! and you, strong man, with those noble limbs, in
this den! Do you not long for a rush through the green of the
fields, a bath in the blue of the river?"</p>

<p>Here he came to a pause, standing, still in the gray light of
the growing day, with eyes whose joyous lustre forestalled the
sun's, and lips which seemed to laugh even in repose.</p>

<p>But presently those eyes, as quick as they were bright, glanced
over the walls, the floor, the shelves, the phials, the mechanical
inventions, and then rested full on my cylinder fixed to the table.
He approached, examined it curiously, asked what it was. I
explained. To gratify him I sat down and renewed my experiment,
with equally ill success. The needle, which should have moved from
west to south, describing an angle of from thirty degrees to forty
or even fifty degrees, only made a few troubled, undecided
oscillations.</p>

<p>"Tut," cried the young man, "I see what it is; you have a wound
in your right hand."</p>

<p>That was true; I had burned my band a few days before in a
chemical experiment, and the sore had not healed.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "and what does that matter?"</p>

<p>"Everything; the least scratch in the skin of the hand produces
chemical actions on the electric current, independently of your
will. Let me try."</p>

<p>He took my place, and in a moment the needle in the galvanometer
responded to his grasp on the cylinder, exactly as the inventive
philosopher had stated to be the due result of the experiment.</p>

<p>I was startled.</p>

<p>"But how came you, Mr. Margrave, to be so well acquainted with a
scientific process little known, and but recently discovered?"</p>

<p>"I well acquainted! not so. But I am fond of all experiments
that relate to animal life. Electricity, especially, is full of
interest."</p>

<p>On that I drew him out (as I thought), and he talked volubly. I
was amazed to find this young man, in whose brain I had conceived
thought kept one careless holiday, was evidently familiar with the
physical sciences, and especially with chemistry, which was my own
study by predilection. But never had I met with a student in whom a
knowledge so extensive was mixed up with notions so obsolete or so
crotchety. In one sentence he showed that he had mastered some late
discovery by Faraday or Liebig; in the next sentence he was talking
the wild fallacies of Cardan or Van Helmont. I burst out laughing
at some paradox about sympathetic powders, which he enounced as if
it were a recognized truth.</p>

<p>"Pray tell me," said I, "who was your master in physics; for a
cleverer pupil never had a more crack-brained teacher."</p>

<p>"No," he answered, with his merry laugh, "it is not the
teacher's fault. I am a mere parrot; just cry out a few scraps of
learning picked up here and there. But, however, I am fond of all
researches into Nature; all guesses at her riddles. To tell you the
truth, one reason why I have taken to you so heartily is not only
that your published work caught my fancy in the dip which I took
into its contents (pardon me if I say dip, I never do more than dip
into any book), but also because young &mdash;&mdash; tells me that
which all whom I have met in this town confirm; namely, that you
are one of those few practical chemists who are at once exceedingly
cautious and exceedingly bold,&mdash;willing to try every new
experiment, but submitting experiment to rigid tests. Well, I have
an experiment running wild in this giddy head of mine, and I want
you, some day when at leisure, to catch it, fix it as you have
fixed that cylinder, make something of it. I am sure you can."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Something akin to the theories in your work. You would
replenish or preserve to each special constitution the special
substance that may fail to the equilibrium of its health. But you
own that in a large proportion of cases the best cure of disease is
less to deal with the disease itself than to support and stimulate
the whole system, so as to enable Nature to cure the disease and
restore the impaired equilibrium by her own agencies. Thus, if you
find that in certain cases of nervous debility a substance like
nitric acid is efficacious, it is because the nitric acid has a
virtue in locking up, as it were, the nervous energy,&mdash;that
is, preventing all undue waste. Again, in some cases of what is
commonly called feverish cold, stimulants like ammonia assist
Nature itself to get rid of the disorder that oppresses its normal
action; and, on the same principle, I apprehend, it is contended
that a large average of human lives is saved in those hospitals
which have adopted the supporting system of ample nourishment and
alcoholic stimulants."</p>

<p>"Your medical learning surprises me," said I, smiling; "and
without pausing to notice where it deals somewhat superficially
with disputable points in general, and my own theory in particular,
I ask you for the deduction you draw from your premises."</p>

<p>"It is simply this: that to all animate bodies, however various,
there must be one principle in common,&mdash;the vital principle
itself. What if there be one certain means of recruiting that
principle; and what if that secret can be discovered?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! The old illusion of the mediaeval empirics."</p>

<p>"Not so. But the mediaeval empirics were great discoverers. You
sneer at Van Helmont, who sought, in water, the principle of all
things; but Van Helmont discovered in his search those invisible
bodies called gases. Now the principle of life must be certainly
ascribed to a gas.(1) And what ever is a gas chemistry should not
despair of producing! But I can argue no longer now,&mdash;never
can argue long at a stretch; we are wasting the morning; and, joy!
the sun is up! See! Out! come out! out! and greet the great
Lifegiver face to face."</p>

<p>I could not resist the young man's invitation. In a few minutes
we were in the quiet lane under the glinting chestnut-trees.
Margrave was chanting, low, a wild tune,&mdash;words in a strange
language.</p>

<p>"What words are those,&mdash;no European language, I think; for
I know a little of most of the languages which are spoken in our
quarter of the globe, at least by its more civilized races."</p>

<p>"Civilized race! What is civilization? Those words were uttered
by men who founded empires when Europe itself was not civilized!
Hush, is it not a grand old air?" and lifting his eyes towards the
sun, he gave vent to a voice clear and deep as a mighty bell! The
air was grand; the words had a sonorous swell that suited it, and
they seemed to me jubilant and yet solemn. He stopped abruptly as a
path from the lane had led us into the fields, already half-bathed
in sunlight, dews glittering on the hedgerows.</p>

<p>"Your song," said I, "would go well with the clash of cymbals or
the peal of the organ. I am no judge of melody, but this strikes me
as that of a religious hymn."</p>

<p>"I compliment you on the guess. It is a Persian
fire-worshipper's hymn to the sun. The dialect is very different
from modern Persian. Cyrus the Great might have chanted it on his
march upon Babylon."</p>

<p>"And where did you learn it?"</p>

<p>"In Persia itself."</p>

<p>"You have travelled much, learned much,&mdash;and are so young
and so fresh. Is it an impertinent question if I ask whether your
parents are yet living, or are you wholly lord of yourself?"</p>

<p>"Thank you for the question,&mdash;pray make my answer known in
the town. Parents I have not,&mdash;never had."</p>

<p>"Never had parents!"</p>

<p>"Well, I ought rather to say that no parents ever owned me. I am
a natural son, a vagabond, a nobody. When I came of age I received
an anonymous letter, informing me that a sum&mdash;I need not say
what, but more than enough for all I need&mdash;was lodged at an
English banker's in my name; that my mother had died in my infancy;
that my father was also dead&mdash;but recently; that as I was a
child of love, and he was unwilling that the secret of my birth
should ever be traced, he had provided for me, not by will, but in
his life, by a sum consigned to the trust of the friend who now
wrote to me; I need give myself no trouble to learn more. Faith, I
never did! I am young, healthy, rich,&mdash;yes, rich! Now you know
all, and you had better tell it, that I may win no man's courtesy
and no maiden's love upon false pretences. I have not even a right,
you see, to the name I bear. Hist! let me catch that squirrel."</p>

<p>With what a panther-like bound he sprang! The squirrel eluded
his grasp, and was up the oak-tree; in a moment he was up the
oak-tree too. In amazement I saw him rising from bough to bough;
saw his bright eyes and glittering teeth through the green leaves.
Presently I heard the sharp piteous cry of the squirrel, echoed by
the youth's merry laugh; and down, through that maze of green,
Hargrave came, dropping on the grass and bounding up, as Mercury
might have bounded with his wings at his heels.</p>

<p>"I have caught him. What pretty brown eyes!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the gay expression of his face changed to that of a
savage; the squirrel had wrenched itself half-loose, and bitten
him. The poor brute! In an instant its neck was wrung, its body
dashed on the ground; and that fair young creature, every feature
quivering with rage, was stamping his foot on his victim again and
again! It was horrible. I caught him by the arm indignantly. He
turned round on me like a wild beast disturbed from its
prey,&mdash;his teeth set, his hand lifted, his eyes like balls of
fire.</p>

<p>"Shame!" said I, calmly; "shame on you!"</p>

<p>He continued to gaze on me a moment or so, his eye glaring, his
breath panting; and then, as if mastering himself with an
involuntary effort, his arm dropped to his side, and he said quite
humbly, "I beg your pardon; indeed I do. I was beside myself for a
moment; I cannot bear pain;" and he looked in deep compassion for
himself at his wounded hand. "Venomous brute!" And he stamped again
on the body of the squirrel, already crushed out of shape.</p>

<p>I moved away in disgust, and walked on.</p>

<p>But presently I felt my arm softly drawn aside, and a voice,
dulcet as the coo of a dove, stole its way into my ears. There was
no resisting the charm with which this extraordinary mortal could
fascinate even the hard and the cold; nor them, perhaps, the least.
For as you see in extreme old age, when the heart seems to have
shrunk into itself, and to leave but meagre and nipped affections
for the nearest relations if grown up, the indurated egotism
softens at once towards a playful child; or as you see in middle
life, some misanthrope, whose nature has been soured by wrong and
sorrow, shrink from his own species, yet make friends with inferior
races, and respond to the caress of a dog,&mdash;so, for the
worldling or the cynic, there was an attraction in the freshness of
this joyous favourite of Nature,&mdash;an attraction like that of a
beautiful child, spoilt and wayward, or of a graceful animal, half
docile, half fierce.</p>

<p>"But," said I, with a smile, as I felt all displeasure gone,
"such indulgence of passion for such a trifle is surely unworthy a
student of philosophy!"</p>

<p>"Trifle," he said dolorously. "But I tell you it is pain; pain
is no trifle. I suffer. Look!"</p>

<p>I looked at the hand, which I took in mine. The bite no doubt
had been sharp; but the hand that lay in my own was that which the
Greek sculptor gives to a gladiator; not large (the extremities are
never large in persons whose strength comes from the just
proportion of all the members, rather than the factitious and
partial force which continued muscular exertion will give to one
part of the frame, to the comparative weakening of the rest), but
with the firm-knit joints, the solid fingers, the finished nails,
the massive palm, the supple polished skin, in which we recognize
what Nature designs the human hand to be,&mdash;the skilled, swift,
mighty doer of all those marvels which win Nature herself from the
wilderness.</p>

<p>"It is strange," said I, thoughtfully; "but your susceptibility
to suffering confirms my opinion, which is different from the
popular belief,&mdash;namely, that pain is most acutely felt by
those in whom the animal organization being perfect, and the sense
of vitality exquisitely keen, every injury or lesion finds the
whole system rise, as it were, to repel the mischief and
communicate the consciousness of it to all those nerves which are
the sentinels to the garrison of life. Yet my theory is scarcely
borne out by general fact. The Indian savages must have a health as
perfect as yours; a nervous system as fine,&mdash;witness their
marvellous accuracy of ear, of eye, of scent, probably also of
touch; yet they are indifferent to physical pain; or must I mortify
your pride by saying that they have some moral quality defective in
you which enables them to rise superior to it?"</p>

<p>"The Indian savages," said Margrave, sullenly, "have not a
health as perfect as mine, and in what you call vitality&mdash;the
blissful consciousness of life&mdash;they are as sticks and stones
compared to me."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because I have lived with them. It is a fallacy to suppose that
the savage has a health superior to that of the civilized
man,&mdash;if the civilized man be but temperate; and even if not,
he has the stamina that can resist for years the effect of excesses
which would destroy the savage in a month. As to the savage's fine
perceptions of sense, such do not come from exquisite equilibrium
of system, but are hereditary attributes transmitted from race to
race, and strengthened by training from infancy. But is a pointer
stronger and healthier than a mastiff, because the pointer through
long descent and early teaching creeps stealthily to his game and
stands to it motionless? I will talk of this later; now I suffer!
Pain, pain! Has life any ill but pain?"</p>

<p>It so happened that I had about me some roots of the white lily,
which I meant, before returning home, to leave with a patient
suffering from one of those acute local inflammations, in which
that simple remedy often affords great relief. I cut up one of
these roots, and bound the cooling leaves to the wounded hand with
my handkerchief.</p>

<p>"There," said I. "Fortunately if you feel pain more sensibly
than others, you will recover from it more quickly." And in a few
minutes my companion felt perfectly relieved, and poured out his
gratitude with an extravagance of expression and a beaming delight
of countenance which positively touched me.</p>

<p>"I almost feel," said I, "as I do when I have stilled an
infant's wailing, and restored it smiling to its mother's
breast."</p>

<p>"You have done so. I am an infant, and Nature is my mother. Oh,
to be restored to the full joy of life, the scent of wild flowers,
the song of birds, and this air&mdash;summer air&mdash;summer
air!"</p>

<p>I know not why it was, but at that moment, looking at him and
hearing him, I rejoiced that Lilian was not at L&mdash;&mdash;.
"But I came out to bathe. Can we not bathe in that stream?"</p>

<p>"No. You would derange the bandage round your hand; and for all
bodily ills, from the least to the gravest, there is nothing like
leaving Nature at rest the moment we have hit on the means which
assist her own efforts at cure."</p>

<p>"I obey, then; but I so love the water."</p>

<p>"You swim, of course?"</p>

<p>"Ask the fish if it swim. Ask the fish if it can escape me! I
delight to dive down&mdash;down; to plunge after the startled
trout, as an otter does; and then to get amongst those cool,
fragrant reeds and bulrushes, or that forest of emerald weed which
one sometimes finds waving under clear rivers. Man! man! could you
live but an hour of my life you would know how horrible a thing it
is to die!"</p>

<p>"Yet the dying do not think so; they pass away calm and smiling,
as you will one day."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I! die one day&mdash;die!" and he sank on the grass,
and buried his face amongst the herbage, sobbing aloud.</p>

<p>Before I could get through half a dozen words I meant to soothe,
he had once more bounded up, dashed the tears from his eyes, and
was again singing some wild, barbaric chant. Abstracting itself
from the appeal to its outward sense by melodies of which the
language was unknown, my mind soon grew absorbed in meditative
conjectures on the singular nature, so wayward, so impulsive, which
had forced intimacy on a man grave and practical as myself.</p>

<p>I was puzzled how to reconcile so passionate a childishness, so
undisciplined a want of self-control, with an experience of mankind
so extended by travel, with an education desultory and irregular
indeed, but which must, at some time or other, have been
familiarized to severe reasonings and laborious studies. In
Margrave there seemed to be wanting that mysterious something which
is needed to keep our faculties, however severally brilliant,
harmoniously linked together,&mdash;as the string by which a child
mechanically binds the wildflowers it gathers, shaping them at
choice into the garland or the chain.</p>

<p>(1) "According to the views we have mentioned, we must ascribe
life to a gas, that is, to an aeriform body."&mdash;Liebig:
"Organic Chemistry," Mayfair's translation, p.363.&mdash;It is
perhaps not less superfluous to add that Liebig does not support
the views "according to which life must be ascribed to a gas," than
it would be to state, had Dugald Stewart been quoted as writing,
"According to the views we have mentioned the mind is but a bundle
of impressions," that Dugald Stewart was not supporting, but
opposing, the views of David Hume. The quotation is merely meant to
show, in the shortest possible compass, that there are views
entertained by speculative reasoners of our day which, according to
Liebig, would lead to the inference at which Margrave so boldly
arrives. Margrave is, however, no doubt, led to his belief by his
reminiscences of Van Helmont, to whose discovery of gas he is
referring. Van Helmont plainly affirms "that the arterial spirit of
our life is of the nature of a gas;" and in the same chapter (on
the fiction of elementary complexions and mixtures) says, "Seeing
that the spirit of our life, since it is a gas, is most mightily
and swiftly affected by any other gas," etc. He repeats the same
dogma in his treatise on "Long Life," and indeed very generally
throughout his writings, observing, in his chapter on the Vital
Air, that the spirit of life is a salt, sharp vapour, made of the
arterial blood, etc. Liebig, therefore, in confuting some modern
notions as to the nature of contagion by miasma, is leading their
reasonings back to that assumption in the Brawn of physiological
science by which the discoverer of gas exalted into the principle
of life the substance to which he first gave the name, now so
familiarly known. It is nevertheless just to Van Helmont to add
that his conception of the vital principle was very far from being
as purely materialistic as it would seem to those unacquainted with
his writings; for he carefully distinguishes that principle of life
which he ascribes to a gas, and by which he means the sensuous
animal life, from the intellectual immortal principle of soul. Van
Helmont, indeed, was a sincere believer of Divine Revelation. "The
Lord Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life," says with earnest
humility this daring genius, in that noble chapter "On the
completing of the mind by the 'prayer of silence,' and the loving
offering tip of the heart, soul, and strength to the obedience of
the Divine will," from which some of the most eloquent of recent
philosophers, arguing against materialism, have borrowed largely in
support and in ornament of their lofty cause.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p>My intercourse with Margrave grew habitual and familiar. He came
to my house every morning before sunrise; in the evenings we were
again brought together: sometimes in the houses to which we were
both invited, sometimes at his hotel, sometimes in my own home.</p>

<p>Nothing more perplexed me than his aspect of extreme
youthfulness, contrasted with the extent of the travels, which, if
he were to be believed, had left little of the known world
unexplored. One day I asked him bluntly how old he was.</p>

<p>"How old do I look? How old should you suppose me to be?"</p>

<p>"I should have guessed you to be about twenty, till you spoke of
having come of age some years ago."</p>

<p>"Is it a sign of longevity when a man looks much younger than he
is?"</p>

<p>"Conjoined with other signs, certainly!"</p>

<p>"Have I the other signs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a magnificent, perhaps a matchless, constitutional
organization. But you have evaded my question as to your age; was
it an impertinence to put it?"</p>

<p>"No. I came of age&mdash;let me see&mdash;three years ago."</p>

<p>"So long since? Is it possible? I wish I had your secret!"</p>

<p>"Secret! What secret?"</p>

<p>"The secret of preserving so much of boyish freshness in the
wear and tear of man-like passions and man-like thoughts."</p>

<p>"You are still young yourself,&mdash;under forty?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! some years under forty."</p>

<p>"And Nature gave you a grander frame and a finer symmetry of
feature than she bestowed on me."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh! You have the beauty that must charm the eyes of
woman, and that beauty in its sunny forenoon of youth. Happy man!
if you love and wish to be sure that you are loved again."</p>

<p>"What you call love&mdash;the unhealthy sentiment, the feverish
folly&mdash;left behind me, I think forever, when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed,&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"I came of age!"</p>

<p>"Hoary cynic! and you despise love! So did I once. Your time may
come."</p>

<p>"I think not. Does any animal, except man, love its fellow
she-animal as man loves woman?"</p>

<p>"As man loves woman? No, I suppose not."</p>

<p>"And why should the subject animals be wiser than their king?
But to return: you would like to have my youth and my careless
enjoyment of youth?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask,&mdash;who would not?" Margrave looked at me for a
moment with unusual seriousness, and then, in the abrupt changes
common to his capricious temperament, began to sing softly one of
his barbaric chants,&mdash;a chant different from any I had heard
him sing before, made, either by the modulation of his voice or the
nature of the tune, so sweet that, little as music generally
affected me, this thrilled to my very heart's core. I drew closer
and closer to him, and murmured when he paused,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is not that a love-song?"</p>

<p>"No;" said he, "it is the song by which the serpent-charmer
charms the serpent."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p>Increased intimacy with my new acquaintance did not diminish the
charm of his society, though it brought to light some startling
defects, both in his mental and moral organization. I have before
said that his knowledge, though it had swept over a wide circuit
and dipped into curious, unfrequented recesses, was desultory and
erratic. It certainly was not that knowledge, sustained and
aspiring, which the poet assures us is "the wing on which we mount
to heaven." So, in his faculties themselves there were singular
inequalities, or contradictions. His power of memory in some things
seemed prodigious, but when examined it was seldom accurate; it
could apprehend, but did not hold together with a binding grasp
what metaphysicians call "complex ideas." He thus seemed unable to
put it to any steadfast purpose in the sciences of which it
retained, vaguely and loosely, many recondite principles. For the
sublime and beautiful in literature he had no taste whatever. A
passionate lover of nature, his imagination had no response to the
arts by which nature is expressed or idealized; wholly unaffected
by poetry or painting. Of the fine arts, music alone attracted and
pleased him. His conversation was often eminently suggestive,
touching on much, whether in books or mankind, that set one
thinking; but I never remember him to have uttered any of those
lofty or tender sentiments which form the connecting links between
youth and genius; for if poets sing to the young, and the young
hail their own interpreters in poets, it is because the tendency of
both is to idealize the realities of life,&mdash;finding everywhere
in the real a something that is noble or fair, and making the fair
yet fairer, and the noble nobler still.</p>

<p>In Margrave's character there seemed no special vices, no
special virtues; but a wonderful vivacity, joyousness, animal
good-humour. He was singularly temperate, having a dislike to wine,
perhaps from that purity of taste which belongs to health
absolutely perfect. No healthful child likes alcohol; no animal,
except man, prefers wine to water.</p>

<p>But his main moral defect seemed to me in a want of sympathy,
even where he professed attachment. He who could feel so acutely
for himself, be unmanned by the bite of a squirrel, and sob at the
thought that he should one day die, was as callous to the
sufferings of another as a deer who deserts and butts from him a
wounded comrade.</p>

<p>I give an instance of this hardness of heart where I should have
least expected to find it in him.</p>

<p>He had met and joined me as I was walking to visit a patient on
the outskirts of the town, when we fell in with a group of
children, just let loose for an hour or two from their day-school.
Some of these children joyously recognized him as having played
with them at their homes; they ran up to him, and he seemed as glad
as themselves at the meeting.</p>

<p>He suffered them to drag him along with them, and became as
merry and sportive as the youngest of the troop.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, laughing, "if you are going to play at
leap-frog, pray don't let it be on the high road, or you will be
run over by carts and draymen; see that meadow just in front to the
left,&mdash;off with you there!"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," cried Margrave, "while you pay your visit.
Come along, boys."</p>

<p>A little urchin, not above six years old, but who was lame,
began to cry; he could not run,&mdash;he should be left behind.</p>

<p>Margrave stooped. "Climb on my shoulder, little one, and I'll be
your horse."</p>

<p>The child dried its tears, and delightedly obeyed. "Certainly,"
said I to myself, "Margrave, after all, must have a nature as
gentle as it is simple. What other young man, so courted by all the
allurements that steal innocence from pleasure, would stop in the
thoroughfares to play with children?"</p>

<p>The thought had scarcely passed through my mind when I heard a
scream of agony. Margrave had leaped the railing that divided the
meadow from the road, and, in so doing, the poor child, perched on
his shoulder, had, perhaps from surprise or fright, loosened its
hold and fallen heavily; its cries were piteous. Margrave clapped
his hands to his ears, uttered an exclamation of anger, and not
even stopping to lift up the boy, or examine what the hurt was,
called to the other children to come on, and was soon rolling with
them on the grass, and pelting them with daisies. When I came up,
only one child remained by the sufferer,-his little brother, a year
older than himself. The child had fallen on his arm, which was not
broken, but violently contused. The pain must have been intense. I
carried the child to his home, and had to remain there some time. I
did not see Margrave till the next morning. When he then called, I
felt so indignant that I could scarcely speak to him. When at last
I rebuked him for his inhumanity, he seemed surprised; with
difficulty remembered the circumstance, and then merely said, as if
it were the most natural confession in the world,</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing so discordant as a child's wail. I hate discords. I
am pleased with the company of children; but they must be children
who laugh and play. Well, why do you look at me so sternly? What
have I said to shock you?"</p>

<p>"Shock me! you shock manhood itself! Go; I cannot talk to you
now. I am busy."</p>

<p>But he did not go; and his voice was so sweet, and his ways so
winning, that disgust insensibly melted into that sort of
forgiveness one accords (let me repeat the illustration) to the
deer that forsakes its comrade. The poor thing knows no better. And
what a graceful beautiful thing this was!</p>

<p>The fascination&mdash;I can give it no other name&mdash;which
Margrave exercised, was not confined to me; it was
universal,&mdash;old, young, high, low, man, woman, child, all felt
it. Never in Low Town had stranger, even the most distinguished by
fame, met with a reception so cordial, so flattering. His frank
confession that he was a natural son, far from being to his injury,
served to interest people more in him, and to prevent all those
inquiries in regard to his connections and antecedents which would
otherwise have been afloat. To be sure, he was evidently
rich,&mdash;at least he had plenty of money. He lived in the best
rooms in the principal hotel; was very hospitable; entertained the
families with whom he had grown intimate; made them bring their
children,&mdash;music and dancing after dinner. Among the houses in
which he had established familiar acquaintance was that of the
mayor of the town, who had bought Dr. Lloyd's collection of
subjects in natural history. To that collection the mayor had added
largely by a very recent purchase. He had arranged these various
specimens, which his last acquisitions had enriched by the
interesting carcasses of an elephant and a hippopotamus, in a large
wooden building contiguous to his dwelling, which had been
constructed by a former proprietor (a retired fox-hunter) as a
riding-house; and being a man who much affected the diffusion of
knowledge, he proposed to open this museum to the admiration of the
general public, and, at his death, to bequeath it to the Athenaeum
or Literary Institute of his native town. Margrave, seconded by the
influence of the mayor's daughters, had scarcely been three days at
L&mdash;&mdash; before he had persuaded this excellent and
public-spirited functionary to inaugurate the opening of his museum
by the popular ceremony of a ball. A temporary corridor should
unite the drawing-rooms, which were on the ground floor, with the
building that contained the collection; and thus the fete would be
elevated above the frivolous character of a fashionable amusement,
and consecrated to the solemnization of an intellectual institute.
Dazzled by the brilliancy of this idea, the mayor announced his
intention to give a ball that should include the surrounding
neighbourhood, and be worthy, in all expensive respects, of the
dignity of himself and the occasion. A night had been fixed for the
ball,&mdash;a night that became memorable indeed to me! The
entertainment was anticipated with a lively interest, in which even
the Hill condescended to share. The Hill did not much patronize
mayors in general; but when a Mayor gave a ball for a purpose so
patriotic, and on a scale so splendid, the Hill liberally
acknowledged that Commerce was, on the whole, a thing which the
Eminence might, now and then, condescend to acknowledge without
absolutely derogating from the rank which Providence had assigned
to it amongst the High Places of earth. Accordingly, the Hill was
permitted by its Queen to honour the first magistrate of Low Town
by a promise to attend his ball. Now, as this festivity had
originated in the suggestion of Margrave, so, by a natural
association of ideas, every one, in talking of the ball, talked
also of Margrave.</p>

<p>The Hill had at first affected to ignore a stranger whose debut
had been made in the mercantile circle of Low Town. But the Queen
of the Hill now said, sententiously, "This new man in a few days
has become a Celebrity. It is the policy of the Hill to adopt
Celebrities, if the Celebrities pay respect to the Proprieties. Dr.
Fenwick is requested to procure Mr. Margrave the advantage of being
known to the Hill."</p>

<p>I found it somewhat difficult to persuade Margrave to accept the
Hill's condescending overture. He seemed to have a dislike to all
societies pretending to aristocratic distinction,&mdash;a dislike
expressed with a fierceness so unwonted, that it made one suppose
he had, at some time or other, been subjected to mortification by
the supercilious airs that blow upon heights so elevated. However,
he yielded to my instances, and accompanied me one evening to Mrs.
Poyntz's house. The Hill was encamped there for the occasion. Mrs.
Poyntz was exceedingly civil to him, and after a few commonplace
speeches, hearing that he was fond of music, consigned him to the
caressing care of Miss Brabazon, who was at the head of the musical
department in the Queen of the Hill's administration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz retired to her favourite seat near the window,
inviting me to sit beside her; and while she knitted in silence, in
silence my eye glanced towards Margrave, in the midst of the group
assembled round the piano.</p>

<p>Whether he was in more than usually high spirits, or whether he
was actuated by a malign and impish desire to upset the established
laws of decorum by which the gayeties of the Hill were habitually
subdued into a serene and somewhat pensive pleasantness, I know
not; but it was not many minutes before the orderly aspect of the
place was grotesquely changed.</p>

<p>Miss Brabazon having come to the close of a complicated and
dreary sonata, I heard Margrave abruptly ask her if she could play
the Tarantella, that famous Neapolitan air which is founded on the
legendary belief that the bite of the tarantula excites an
irresistible desire to dance. On that highbred spinster's
confession that she was ignorant of the air, and had not even heard
of the legend, Margrave said, "Let me play it to you, with
variations of my own." Miss Brabazon graciously yielded her place
at the instrument. Margrave seated himself,&mdash;there was great
curiosity to hear his performance. Margrave's fingers rushed over
the keys, and there was a general start, the prelude was so unlike
any known combination of harmonious sounds. Then he began a
chant&mdash;song I can scarcely call it&mdash;words certainly not
in Italian, perhaps in some uncivilized tongue, perhaps in
impromptu gibberish. And the torture of the instrument now
commenced in good earnest: it shrieked, it groaned, wilder and
noisier. Beethoven's Storm, roused by the fell touch of a German
pianist, were mild in comparison; and the mighty voice, dominating
the anguish of the cracking keys, had the full diapason of a
chorus. Certainly I am no judge of music, but to my ear the discord
was terrific,&mdash;to the ears of better informed amateurs it
seemed ravishing. All were spellbound; even Mrs. Poyntz paused from
her knitting, as the Fates paused from their web at the lyre of
Orpheus. To this breathless delight, however, soon succeeded a
general desire for movement. To my amazement, I beheld these formal
matrons and sober fathers of families forming themselves into a
dance, turbulent as a children's ball at Christmas; and when,
suddenly desisting from his music, Margrave started up, caught the
skeleton hand of lean Miss Brabazon, and whirled her into the
centre of the dance, I could have fancied myself at a witch's
sabbat. My eye turned in scandalized alarm towards Mrs. Poyntz.
That great creature seemed as much astounded as myself. Her eyes
were fixed on the scene in a stare of positive stupor. For the
first time, no doubt, in her life, she was overcome, deposed,
dethroned. The awe of her presence was literally whirled away. The
dance ceased as suddenly as it had begun. Darting from the
galvanized mummy whom he had selected as his partner, Margrave shot
to Mrs. Poyntz's side, and said, "Ten thousand pardons for quitting
you so soon, but the clock warns me that I have an engagement
elsewhere." In another moment he was gone.</p>

<p>The dance halted, people seemed slowly returning to their
senses, looking at each other bashfully and ashamed.</p>

<p>"I could not help it, dear," sighed Miss Brabazon at last,
sinking into a chair, and casting her deprecating, fainting eyes
upon the hostess.</p>

<p>"It is witchcraft," said fat Mrs. Bruce, wiping her
forehead.</p>

<p>"Witchcraft!" echoed Mrs. Poyntz; "it does indeed look like it.
An amazing and portentous exhibition of animal spirits, and not to
be endured by the Proprieties. Where on earth can that young savage
have come from?"</p>

<p>"From savage lands," said I,&mdash;"so he says."</p>

<p>"Do not bring him here again," said Mrs. Poyntz. "He would soon
turn the Hill topsy-turvy. But how charming! I should like to see
more of him," she added, in an under voice, "if he would call on me
some morning, and not in the presence of those for whose
Proprieties I am responsible. Jane must be out in her ride with the
colonel."</p>

<p>Margrave never again attended the patrician festivities of the
Hill. Invitations were poured upon him, especially by Miss Brabazon
and the other old maids, but in vain.</p>

<p>"Those people," said he, "are too tamed and civilized for me;
and so few young persons among them. Even that girl Jane is only
young on the surface; inside, as old as the World or her mother. I
like youth, real youth,&mdash;I am young, I am young!"</p>

<p>And, indeed, I observed he would attach himself to some young
person, often to some child, as if with cordial and special favour,
yet for not more than an hour or so, never distinguishing them by
the same preference when he next met them. I made that remark to
him, in rebuke of his fickleness, one evening when he had found me
at work on my Ambitious Book, reducing to rule and measure the Laws
of Nature.</p>

<p>"It is not fickleness," said he,&mdash;"it is necessity."</p>

<p>"Necessity! Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"I seek to find what I have not found," said he; "it is my
necessity to seek it, and among the young; and disappointed in one,
I turn to the other. Necessity again. But find it at last I
must."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean what the young usually seek in the young;
and if, as you said the other day, you have left love behind you,
you now wander back to re-find it."</p>

<p>"Tush! If I may judge by the talk of young fools, love may be
found every day by him who looks out for it. What I seek is among
the rarest of all discoveries. You might aid me to find it, and in
so doing aid yourself to a knowledge far beyond all that your
formal experiments can bestow."</p>

<p>"Prove your words, and command my services," said I, smiling
somewhat disdainfully.</p>

<p>"You told me that you had examined into the alleged phenomena of
animal magnetism, and proved some persons who pretend to the gift
which the Scotch call second sight to be bungling impostors. You
were right. I have seen the clairvoyants who drive their trade in
this town; a common gipsy could beat them in their own calling. But
your experience must have shown you that there are certain
temperaments in which the gift of the Pythoness is stored, unknown
to the possessor, undetected by the common observer; but the signs
of which should be as apparent to the modern physiologist, as they
were to the ancient priest."</p>

<p>"I at least, as a physiologist, am ignorant of the signs: what
are they?"</p>

<p>"I should despair of making you comprehend them by mere verbal
description. I could guide your observation to distinguish them
unerringly were living subjects before us. But not one in a million
has the gift to an extent available for the purposes to which the
wise would apply it. Many have imperfect glimpses; few, few indeed,
the unveiled, lucent sight. They who have but the imperfect
glimpses mislead and dupe the minds that consult them, because,
being sometimes marvellously right, they excite a credulous belief
in their general accuracy; and as they are but translators of
dreams in their own brain, their assurances are no more to be
trusted than are the dreams of commonplace sleepers. But where the
gift exists to perfection, he who knows how to direct and to profit
by it should be able to discover all that he desires to know for
the guidance and preservation of his own life. He will be
forewarned of every danger, forearmed in the means by which danger
is avoided. For the eye of the true Pythoness matter has no
obstruction, space no confines, time no measurement."</p>

<p>"My dear Margrave, you may well say that creatures so gifted are
rare; and, for my part, I would as soon search for a unicorn, as,
to use your affected expression, for a Pythoness."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, whenever there come across the course of your
practice some young creature to whom all the evil of the world is
as yet unknown, to whom the ordinary cares and duties of the world
are strange and unwelcome; who from the earliest dawn of reason has
loved to sit apart and to muse; before whose eyes visions pass
unsolicited; who converses with those who are not dwellers on the
earth, and beholds in the space landscapes which the earth does not
reflect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Margrave, Margrave! of whom do you speak?"</p>

<p>"Whose frame, though exquisitely sensitive, has still a health
and a soundness in which you recognize no disease; whose mind has a
truthfulness that you know cannot deceive you, and a simple
intelligence too clear to deceive itself; who is moved to a
mysterious degree by all the varying aspects of external
nature,&mdash;innocently joyous, or unaccountably sad,&mdash;when,
I say, such a being comes across your experience, inform me; and
the chances are that the true Pythoness is found."</p>

<p>I had listened with vague terror, and with more than one
exclamation of amazement, to descriptions which brought Lilian
Ashleigh before me; and I now sat mute, bewildered, breathless,
gazing upon Margrave, and rejoicing that, at least, Lilian he had
never seen.</p>

<p>He returned my own gaze steadily, searchingly, and then,
breaking into a slight laugh, resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You call my word 'Pythoness' affected. I know of no better. My
recollections of classic anecdote and history are confused and dim;
but somewhere I have read or heard that the priests of Delphi were
accustomed to travel chiefly into Thrace or Thessaly, in search of
the virgins who might fitly administer their oracles, and that the
oracles gradually ceased in repute as the priests became unable to
discover the organization requisite in the priestesses, and
supplied by craft and imposture, or by such imperfect fragmentary
developments as belong now to professional clairvoyants, the gifts
which Nature failed to afford. Indeed, the demand was one that mast
have rapidly exhausted so limited a supply. The constant strain
upon faculties so wearying to the vital functions in their
relentless exercise, under the artful stimulants by which the
priests heightened their power, was mortal, and no Pythoness ever
retained her life more than three years from the time that her gift
was elaborately trained and developed."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I know of no classical authority for the details you so
confidently cite. Perhaps some such legends may be found in the
Alexandrian Platonists, but those mystics are no authority on such
a subject. After all;" I added, recovering from my first surprise,
or awe, "the Delphic oracles were proverbially ambiguous, and their
responses might be read either way,&mdash;a proof that the priests
dictated the verses, though their arts on the unhappy priestess
might throw her into real convulsions, and the real convulsions,
not the false gift, might shorten her life. Enough of such idle
subjects! Yet no! one question more. If you found your Pythoness,
what then?"</p>

<p>"What then? Why, through her aid I might discover the process of
an experiment which your practical science would assist me to
complete."</p>

<p>"Tell me of what kind is your experiment; and precisely because
such little science as I possess is exclusively practical, I may
assist you without the help of the Pythoness."</p>

<p>Margrave was silent for some minutes, passing his hand several
times across his forehead, which was a frequent gesture of his, and
then rising, he answered, in listless accents,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I cannot say more now, my brain is fatigued; and you are not
yet in the right mood to hear me. By the way, how close and
reserved you are with me!"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"You never told me that you were engaged to be married. You
leave me, who thought to have won your friendship, to hear what
concerns you so intimately from a comparative stranger."</p>

<p>"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"That woman with eyes that pry and lips that scheme, to whose
house you took me."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Poyntz! is it possible? When?"</p>

<p>"This afternoon. I met her in the street; she stopped me, and,
after some unmeaning talk, asked if I had seen you lately; if I did
not find you very absent and distracted: no wonder;&mdash;you were
in love. The young lady was away on a visit, and wooed by a
dangerous rival."</p>

<p>"Wooed by a dangerous rival!"</p>

<p>"Very rich, good-looking, young. Do you fear him? You turn
pale."</p>

<p>"I do not fear, except so far as he who loves truly, loves
humbly, and fears not that another may be preferred, but that
another may be worthier of preference than himself. But that Mrs.
Poyntz should tell you all this does amaze me. Did she mention the
name of the young lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Lilian Ashleigh. Henceforth be more frank with me. Who
knows? I may help you. Adieu!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p>When Margrave had gone, I glanced at the clock,&mdash;not yet
nine. I resolved to go at once to Mrs. Poyntz. It was not an
evening on which she received, but doubtless she would see me. She
owed me an explanation. How thus carelessly divulge a secret she
had been enjoined to keep; and this rival, of whom I was ignorant?
It was no longer a matter of wonder that Margrave should have
described Lilian's peculiar idiosyncrasies in his sketch of his
fabulous Pythoness. Doubtless Mrs. Poyntz had, with unpardonable
levity of indiscretion, revealed all of which she disapproved in my
choice. But for what object? Was this her boasted friendship for
me? Was it consistent with the regard she professed for Mrs.
Ashleigh and Lilian? Occupied by these perplexed and indignant
thoughts, I arrived at Mrs. Poyntz's house, and was admitted to her
presence. She was fortunately alone; her daughter and the colonel
had gone to some party on the Hill. I would not take the hand she
held out to me on entrance; seated myself in stern displeasure, and
proceeded at once to inquire if she had really betrayed to Mr.
Margrave the secret of my engagement to Lilian.</p>

<p>"Yes, Allen Fenwick; I have this day told, not only Mr.
Margrave, but every person I met who is likely to tell it to some
one else, the secret of your engagement to Lilian Ashleigh. I never
promised to conceal it; on the contrary, I wrote word to Anne
Ashleigh that I would therein act as my own judgment counselled me.
I think my words to you were that 'public gossip was sometimes the
best security for the completion of private engagements.'"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that Mrs. or Miss Ashleigh recoils from the
engagement with me, and that I should meanly compel them both to
fulfil it by calling in the public to censure
them&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;Oh, madam, this is worldly artifice
indeed!"</p>

<p>"Be good enough to listen to me quietly. I have never yet showed
you the letter to Mrs. Ashleigh, written by Lady Haughton, and
delivered by Mr. Vigors. That letter I will now show to you; but
before doing so I must enter into a preliminary explanation. Lady
Haughton is one of those women who love power, and cannot obtain it
except through wealth and station,&mdash;by her own intellect never
obtain it. When her husband died she was reduced from an income of
twelve thousand a year to a jointure of twelve hundred, but with
the exclusive guardianship of a young son, a minor, and adequate
allowances for the charge; she continued, therefore, to preside as
mistress over the establishments in town and country; still had the
administration of her son's wealth and rank. She stinted his
education, in order to maintain her ascendancy over him. He became
a brainless prodigal, spendthrift alike of health and fortune.
Alarmed, she saw that, probably, he would die young and a beggar;
his only hope of reform was in marriage. She reluctantly resolved
to marry him to a penniless, well-born, soft-minded young lady whom
she knew she could control; just before this marriage was to take
place he was killed by a fall from his horse. The Haughton estate
passed to his cousin, the luckiest young man alive,&mdash;the same
Ashleigh Sumner who had already succeeded, in default of male
issue, to poor Gilbert Ashleigh's landed possessions. Over this
young man Lady Haughton could expect no influence. She would be a
stranger in his house. But she had a niece! Mr. Vigors assured her
the niece was beautiful. And if the niece could become Mrs.
Ashleigh Sumner, then Lady Haughton would be a less unimportant
Nobody in the world, because she would still have her nearest
relation in a Somebody at Haughton Park. Mr. Vigors has his own
pompous reasons for approving an alliance which he might help to
accomplish. The first step towards that alliance was obviously to
bring into reciprocal attraction the natural charms of the young
lady and the acquired merits of the young gentleman. Mr. Vigors
could easily induce his ward to pay a visit to Lady Haughton, and
Lady Haughton had only to extend her invitations to her niece;
hence the letter to Mrs. Ashleigh, of which Mr. Vigors was the
bearer, and hence my advice to you, of which you can now understand
the motive. Since you thought Lilian Ashleigh the only woman you
could love, and since I thought there were other women in the world
who might do as well for Ashleigh Sumner, it seemed to me fair for
all parties that Lilian should not go to Lady Haughton's in
ignorance of the sentiments with which she had inspired you. A girl
can seldom be sure that she loves until she is sure that she is
loved. And now," added Mrs. Poyntz, rising and walking across the
room to her bureau,&mdash;"now I will show you Lady Haughton's
invitation to Mrs. Ashleigh. Here it is!"</p>

<p>I ran my eye over the letter, which she thrust into my hand,
resuming her knitting-work while I read.</p>

<p>The letter was short, couched in conventional terms of hollow
affection. The writer blamed herself for having so long neglected
her brother's widow and child; her heart had been wrapped up too
much in the son she had lost; that loss had made her turn to the
ties of blood still left to her; she had heard much of Lilian from
their common friend, Mr. Vigors; she longed to embrace so charming
a niece. Then followed the invitation and the postscript. The
postscript ran thus, so far as I can remember:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "Whatever my own grief at my irreparable bereavement, I am no egotist;
    I keep my sorrow to myself.  You will find some pleasant guests at my
    house, among others our joint connection, young Ashleigh Sumner."

</pre>

<p>"Woman's postscripts are proverbial for their significance,"
said Mrs. Poyntz, when I had concluded the letter and laid it on
the table; "and if I did not at once show you this hypocritical
effusion, it was simply because at the name Ashleigh Sumner its
object became transparent, not perhaps to poor Anne Ashleigh nor to
innocent Lilian, but to my knowledge of the parties concerned, as
it ought to be to that shrewd intelligence which you derive partly
from nature, partly from the insight into life which a true
physician cannot fail to acquire. And if I know anything of you,
you would have romantically said, had you seen the letter at first,
and understood its covert intention, 'Let me not shackle the choice
of the woman I love, and to whom an alliance so coveted in the eyes
of the world might, if she were left free, be proffered.'"</p>

<p>"I should not have gathered from the postscript all that you see
in it; but had its purport been so suggested to me, you are right,
I should have so said. Well, and as Mr. Margrave tells me that you
informed him that I have a rival, I am now to conclude that the
rival is Mr. Ashleigh Sumner?"</p>

<p>"Has not Mrs. Ashleigh or Lilian mentioned him in writing to
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, both; Lilian very slightly, Mrs. Ashleigh with some
praise, as a young man of high character, and very courteous to
her."</p>

<p>"Yet, though I asked you to come and tell me who were the guests
at Lady Haughton's, you never did so."</p>

<p>"Pardon me; but of the guests I thought nothing, and letters
addressed to my heart seemed to me too sacred to talk about. And
Ashleigh Sumner then courts Lilian! How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I know everything that concerns me; and here, the explanation
is simple. My aunt, Lady Delafield, is staying with Lady Haughton.
Lady Delafield is one of the women of fashion who shine by their
own light; Lady Haughton shines by borrowed light, and borrows
every ray she can find."</p>

<p>"And Lady Delafield writes you word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That Ashleigh Sumner is caught by Lilian's beauty."</p>

<p>"And Lilian herself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Women like Lady Delafield do not readily believe that any girl
could refuse Ashleigh Sumner; considered in himself, he is steady
and good-looking; considered as owner of Kirby Hall and Haughton
Park, he has, in the eyes of any sensible mother, the virtues of
Cato and the beauty of Antinous."</p>

<p>I pressed my hand to my heart; close to my heart lay a letter
from Lilian, and there was no word in that letter which showed that
her heart was gone from mine. I shook my head gently, and smiled in
confiding triumph.</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz surveyed me with a bent brow and a compressed
lip.</p>

<p>"I understand your smile," she said ironically. "Very likely
Lilian may be quite untouched by this young man's admiration, but
Anne Ashleigh may be dazzled by so brilliant a prospect for her
daughter; and, in short, I thought it desirable to let your
engagement be publicly known throughout the town to-day. That
information will travel; it will reach Ashleigh Sumner through Mr.
Vigors, or others in this neighbourhood, with whom I know that he
corresponds. It will bring affairs to a crisis, and before it may
be too late. I think it well that Ashleigh Sumner should leave that
house; if he leave it for good, so much the better. And, perhaps,
the sooner Lilian returns to L&mdash;&mdash; the lighter your own
heart will be."</p>

<p>"And for these reasons you have published the secret
of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your engagement? Yes. Prepare to be congratulated wherever you
go. And now if you hear either from mother or daughter that
Ashleigh Sumner has proposed, and been, let us say, refused, I do
not doubt that, in the pride of your heart, you will come and tell
me."</p>

<p>"Rely upon it, I will; but before I take leave, allow me to ask
why you described to a young man like Mr. Margrave&mdash;, whose
wild and strange humours you have witnessed and not
approved&mdash;any of those traits of character in Miss Ashleigh
which distinguish her from other girls of her age?"</p>

<p>"I? You mistake. I said nothing to him of her character. I
mentioned her name, and said she was beautiful, that was all."</p>

<p>"Nay, you said that she was fond of musing, of solitude; that in
her fancies she believed in the reality of visions which might flit
before her eyes as they flit before the eyes of all imaginative
dreamers."</p>

<p>"Not a word did I say to Mr. Margrave of such peculiarities in
Lilian; not a word more than what I have told you, on my
honour!"</p>

<p>Still incredulous, but disguising my incredulity with that
convenient smile by which we accomplish so much of the polite
dissimulation indispensable to the decencies of civilized life, I
took my departure, returned home, and wrote to Lilian.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p>The conversation with Mrs. Poyntz left my mind restless and
disquieted. I had no doubt, indeed, of Lilian's truth; but could I
be sure that the attentions of a young man, with advantages of
fortune so brilliant, would not force on her thoughts the contrast
of the humbler lot and the duller walk of life in which she had
accepted as companion a man removed from her romantic youth less by
disparity of years than by gravity of pursuits? And would my suit
now be as welcomed as it had been by a mother even so unworldly as
Mrs. Ashleigh? Why, too, should both mother and daughter have left
me so unprepared to hear that I had a rival; why not have implied
some consoling assurance that such rivalry need not cause me alarm?
Lilian's letters, it is true, touched but little on any of the
persons round her; they were filled with the outpourings of an
ingenuous heart, coloured by the glow of a golden fancy. They were
written as if in the wide world we two stood apart alone,
consecrated from the crowd by the love that, in linking us
together, had hallowed each to the other. Mrs. Ashleigh's letters
were more general and diffusive,&mdash;detailed the habits of the
household, sketched the guests, intimated her continued fear of
Lady Haughton, but had said nothing more of Mr. Ashleigh Sumner
than I had repeated to Mrs. Poyntz. However, in my letter to Lilian
I related the intelligence that had reached me, and impatiently I
awaited her reply.</p>

<p>Three days after the interview with Mrs. Poyntz, and two days
before the long-anticipated event of the mayor's ball, I was
summoned to attend a nobleman who had lately been added to my list
of patients, and whose residence was about twelve miles from
L&mdash;&mdash;. The nearest way was through Sir Philip Derval's
park. I went on horseback, and proposed to stop on the way to
inquire after the steward, whom I had seen but once since his fit,
and that was two days after it, when he called himself at my house
to thank me for my attendance, and to declare that he was quite
recovered.</p>

<p>As I rode somewhat fast through the park, I came, however, upon
the steward, just in front of the house. I reined in my horse and
accosted him. He looked very cheerful.</p>

<p>"Sir," said he, in a whisper, "I have heard from Sir Philip; his
letter is dated since&mdash;since-my good woman told you what I
saw,&mdash;well, since then. So that it must have been all a
delusion of mine, as you told her. And yet,
well&mdash;well&mdash;we will not talk of it, doctor; but I hope
you have kept the secret. Sir Philip would not like to hear of it,
if he comes back."</p>

<p>"Your secret is quite safe with me. But is Sir Philip likely to
come back?"</p>

<p>"I hope so, doctor. His letter is dated Paris, and that's nearer
home than he has been for many years; and&mdash;but bless me! some
one is coming out of the house,&mdash;a young gentleman! Who can it
be?"</p>

<p>I looked, and to my surprise I saw Margrave descending the
stately stairs that led from the front door. The steward turned
towards him, and I mechanically followed, for I was curious to know
what had brought Margrave to the house of the long-absent
traveller.</p>

<p>It was easily explained. Mr. Margrave had heard at
L&mdash;&mdash; much of the pictures and internal decorations of
the mansion. He had, by dint of coaxing (he said, with his
enchanting laugh), persuaded the old housekeeper to show him the
rooms.</p>

<p>"It is against Sir Philip's positive orders to show the house to
any stranger, sir; and the housekeeper has done very wrong," said
the steward.</p>

<p>"Pray don't scold her. I dare say Sir Philip would not have
refused me a permission he might not give to every idle sightseer.
Fellow-travellers have a freemasonry with each other; and I have
been much in the same far countries as himself. I heard of him
there, and could tell you more about him, I dare say, than you know
yourself."</p>

<p>"You, sir! pray do then."</p>

<p>"The next time I come," said Margrave, gayly; and, with a nod to
me, he glided off through the trees of the neighbouring grove,
along the winding footpath that led to the lodge.</p>

<p>"A very cool gentleman," muttered the steward; "but what
pleasant ways he has! You seem to know him, sir. Who is he, may I
ask?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Margrave,&mdash;a visitor at L&mdash;&mdash;, and he has
been a great traveller, as he says; perhaps he met Sir Philip
abroad."</p>

<p>"I must go and hear what he said to Mrs. Gates; excuse me, sir,
but I am so anxious about Sir Philip."</p>

<p>"If it be not too great a favour, may I be allowed the same
privilege granted to Mr. Margrave? To judge by the outside of the
house, the inside must be worth seeing; still, if it be against Sir
Philip's positive orders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His orders were, not to let the Court become a
show-house,&mdash;to admit none without my consent; but I should be
ungrateful indeed, doctor, if I refused that consent to you."</p>

<p>I tied my horse to the rusty gate of the terrace-walk, and
followed the steward up the broad stairs of the terrace. The great
doors were unlocked. We entered a lofty hall with a domed ceiling;
at the back of the hall the grand staircase ascended by a double
flight. The design was undoubtedly Vanbrugh's,&mdash;an architect
who, beyond all others, sought the effect of grandeur less in space
than in proportion; but Vanbrugh's designs need the relief of
costume and movement, and the forms of a more pompous generation,
in the bravery of velvets and laces, glancing amid those gilded
columns, or descending with stately tread those broad palatial
stairs. His halls and chambers are so made for festival and throng,
that they become like deserted theatres, inexpressibly desolate, as
we miss the glitter of the lamps and the movement of the
actors.</p>

<p>The housekeeper had now appeared,&mdash;a quiet, timid old
woman. She excused herself for admitting Margrave&mdash;not very
intelligibly. It was plain to see that she had, in truth, been
unable to resist what the steward termed his "pleasant ways."</p>

<p>As if to escape from a scolding, she talked volubly all the
time, bustling nervously through the rooms, along which I followed
her guidance with a hushed footstep. The principal apartments were
on the ground-floor, or rather, a floor raised some ten or fifteen
feet above the ground; they had not been modernized since the date
in which they were built. Hangings of faded silk; tables of rare
marble, and mouldered gilding; comfortless chairs at drill against
the walls; pictures, of which connoisseurs alone could estimate the
value, darkened by dust or blistered by sun and damp, made a
general character of discomfort. On not one room, on not one nook,
still lingered some old smile of home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I gathered from the housekeeper's rambling answers to
questions put to her by the steward, as I moved on, glancing at the
pictures, that Margrave's visit that day was not his first. He had
been to the house twice before,&mdash;his ostensible excuse that he
was an amateur in pictures (though, as I had before observed, for
that department of art he had no taste); but each time he had
talked much of Sir Philip. He said that though not personally known
to him, he had resided in the same towns abroad, and had friends
equally intimate with Sir Philip; but when the steward inquired if
the visitor had given any information as to the absentee, it became
very clear that Margrave had been rather asking questions than
volunteering intelligence.</p>

<p>We had now come to the end of the state apartments, the last of
which was a library. "And," said the old woman, "I don't wonder the
gentleman knew Sir Philip, for he seemed a scholar, and looked very
hard over the books, especially those old ones by the fireplace,
which Sir Philip, Heaven bless him, was always poring into."</p>

<p>Mechanically I turned to the shelves by the fireplace, and
examined the volumes ranged in that department. I found they
contained the works of those writers whom we may class together
under the title of mystics,&mdash;Iamblichus and Plotinus;
Swedenborg and Behmen; Sandivogius, Van Helmont, Paracelsus,
Cardan. Works, too, were there, by writers less renowned, on
astrology, geomancy, chiromancy, etc. I began to understand among
what class of authors Margrave had picked up the strange notions
with which he was apt to interpolate the doctrines of practical
philosophy.</p>

<p>"I suppose this library was Sir Philip's usual sitting-room?"
said I.</p>

<p>"No, sir; he seldom sat here. This was his study;" and the old
woman opened a small door, masked by false book backs. I followed
her into a room of moderate size, and evidently of much earlier
date than the rest of the house. "It is the only room left of an
older mansion," said the steward in answer to my remark. "I have
heard it was spared on account of the chimneypiece. But there is a
Latin inscription which will tell you all about it. I don't know
Latin myself."</p>

<p>The chimneypiece reached to the ceiling. The frieze of the lower
part rested on rude stone caryatides; the upper part was formed of
oak panels very curiously carved in the geometrical designs
favoured by the taste prevalent in the reigns of Elizabeth and
James, but different from any I had ever seen in the drawings of
old houses,&mdash;and I was not quite unlearned in such matters,
for my poor father was a passionate antiquary in all that relates
to mediaeval art. The design in the oak panels was composed of
triangles interlaced with varied ingenuity, and enclosed in
circular bands inscribed with the signs of the Zodiac.</p>

<p>On the stone frieze supported by the caryatides, immediately
under the woodwork, was inserted a metal plate, on which was
written, in Latin, a few lines to the effect that "in this room,
Simon Forman, the seeker of hidden truth, taking refuge from unjust
persecution, made those discoveries in nature which he committed,
for the benefit of a wiser age, to the charge of his protector and
patron, the worshipful Sir Miles Derval, knight."</p>

<p>Forman! The name was not quite unfamiliar to me; but it was not
without an effort that my memory enabled me to assign it to one of
the most notorious of those astrologers or soothsayers whom the
superstition of an earlier age alternately persecuted and
honoured.</p>

<p>The general character of the room was more cheerful than the
statelier chambers I had hitherto passed through, for it had still
the look of habitation,&mdash;the armchair by the fireplace; the
kneehole writing-table beside it; the sofa near the recess of a
large bay-window, with book-prop and candlestick screwed to its
back; maps, coiled in their cylinders, ranged under the cornice;
low strong safes, skirting two sides of the room, and apparently
intended to hold papers and title-deeds, seals carefully affixed to
their jealous locks. Placed on the top of these old-fashioned
receptacles were articles familiar to modern use,&mdash;a
fowling-piece here, fishing-rods there, two or three simple
flower-vases, a pile of music books, a box of crayons. All in this
room seemed to speak of residence and ownership,&mdash;of the
idiosyncrasies of a lone single man, it is true, but of a man of
one's own time,&mdash;a country gentleman of plain habits but not
uncultivated tastes.</p>

<p>I moved to the window; it opened by a sash upon a large balcony,
from which a wooden stair wound to a little garden, not visible in
front of the house, surrounded by a thick grove of evergreens,
through which one broad vista was cut, and that vista was closed by
a view of the mausoleum.</p>

<p>I stepped out into the garden,&mdash;a patch of sward with a
fountain in the centre, and parterres, now more filled with weeds
than flowers. At the left corner was a tall wooden summer-house or
pavilion,&mdash;its door wide open. "Oh, that's where Sir Philip
used to study many a long summer's night," said the steward.</p>

<p>"What! in that damp pavilion?"</p>

<p>"It was a pretty place enough then, sir; but it is very
old,&mdash;they say as old as the room you have just left."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I must look at it, then."</p>

<p>The walls of this summer-house had once been painted in the
arabesques of the Renaissance period; but the figures were now
scarcely traceable. The woodwork had started in some places, and
the sunbeams stole through the chinks and played on the floor,
which was formed from old tiles quaintly tessellated and in
triangular patterns; similar to those I had observed in the
chimneypiece. The room in the pavilion was large, furnished with
old worm-eaten tables and settles. "It was not only here that Sir
Philip studied, but sometimes in the room above," said the
steward.</p>

<p>"How do you get to the room above? Oh, I see; a stair case in
the angle." I ascended the stairs with some caution, for they were
crooked and decayed; and, on entering the room above, comprehended
at once why Sir Philip had favoured it.</p>

<p>The cornice of the ceiling rested on pilasters, within which the
compartments were formed into open unglazed arches, surrounded by a
railed balcony. Through these arches, on three sides of the room,
the eye commanded a magnificent extent of prospect. On the fourth
side the view was bounded by the mausoleum. In this room was a
large telescope; and on stepping into the balcony, I saw that a
winding stair mounted thence to a platform on the top of the
pavilion,&mdash;perhaps once used as an observatory by Forman
himself.</p>

<p>"The gentleman who was here to-day was very much pleased with
this look-out, sir," said the housekeeper. "Who would not be? I
suppose Sir Philip has a taste for astronomy."</p>

<p>"I dare say, sir," said the steward, looking grave; "he likes
most out-of-the-way things."</p>

<p>The position of the sun now warned me that my time pressed, and
that I should have to ride fast to reach my new patient at the hour
appointed. I therefore hastened back to my horse, and spurred on,
wondering whether, in the chain of association which so subtly
links our pursuits in manhood to our impressions in childhood, it
was the Latin inscription on the chimneypiece that had originally
biassed Sir Philip Derval's literary taste towards the mystic
jargon of the books at which I had contemptuously glanced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p>I did not see Margrave the following day, but the next morning,
a little after sunrise, he walked into my study, according to his
ordinary habit.</p>

<p>"So you know something about Sir Philip Derval?" said I. "What
sort of a man is he?"</p>

<p>"Hateful!" cried Margrave; and then checking himself, burst out
into his merry laugh. "Just like my exaggerations! I am not
acquainted with anything to his prejudice. I came across his track
once or twice in the East. Travellers are always apt to be jealous
of each other."</p>

<p>"You are a strange compound of cynicism and credulity; but I
should have fancied that you and Sir Philip would have been
congenial spirits, when I found, among his favourite books, Van
Helmont and Paracelsus. Perhaps you, too, study Swedenborg, or,
worse still, Ptolemy and Lilly?"</p>

<p>"Astrologers? No! They deal with the future! I live for the day;
only I wish the day never had a morrow!"</p>

<p>"Have you not, then that vague desire for the something
beyond,&mdash;that not unhappy, but grand discontent with the
limits of the immediate Present, from which man takes his passion
for improvement and progress, and from which some sentimental
philosophers have deduced an argument in favour of his destined
immortality?"</p>

<p>"Eh!" said Margrave, with as vacant a stare as that of a peasant
whom one has addressed in Hebrew. "What farrago of words is this? I
do not comprehend you."</p>

<p>"With your natural abilities," I asked with interest, "do you
never feel a desire for fame?"</p>

<p>"Fame? Certainly not. I cannot even understand it!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, would you have no pleasure in the thought that you
had rendered a service to humanity?"</p>

<p>Margrave looked bewildered; after a moment's pause, he took from
the table a piece of bread that chanced to be there, opened the
window, and threw the crumbs into the lane. The sparrows gathered
round the crumbs.</p>

<p>"Now," said Margrave, "the sparrows come to that dull pavement
for the bread that recruits their lives in this world; do you
believe that one sparrow would be silly enough to fly to a
house-top for the sake of some benefit to other sparrows, or to be
chirruped about after he was dead? I care for science as the
sparrow cares for bread,&mdash;it may help me to something good for
my own life; and as for fame and humanity, I care for them as the
sparrow cares for the general interest and posthumous approbation
of sparrows!"</p>

<p>"Margrave, there is one thing in you that perplexes me more than
all else&mdash;human puzzle as you are&mdash;in your many
eccentricities and self-contradictions."</p>

<p>"What is that one thing in me most perplexing?"</p>

<p>"This: that in your enjoyment of Nature you have all the
freshness of a child, but when you speak of Man and his objects in
the world, you talk in the vein of some worn-out and hoary cynic.
At such times, were I to close my eyes, I should say to myself,
'What weary old man is thus venting his spleen against the ambition
which has failed, and the love which has forsaken him?' Outwardly
the very personation of youth, and revelling like a butterfly in
the warmth of the sun and the tints of the herbage, why have you
none of the golden passions of the young,&mdash;their bright dreams
of some impossible love, their sublime enthusiasm for some
unattainable glory? The sentiment you have just clothed in the
illustration by which you place yourself on a level with the
sparrows is too mean and too gloomy to be genuine at your age.
Misanthropy is among the dismal fallacies of gray beards. No man,
till man's energies leave him, can divorce himself from the bonds
of our social kind."</p>

<p>"Our kind! Your kind, possibly; but I&mdash;" He swept his hand
over his brow, and resumed, in strange, absent, and wistful
accents: "I wonder what it is that is wanting here, and of which at
moments I have a dim reminiscence." Again he paused, and gazing on
me, said with more appearance of friendly interest than I had ever
before remarked in his countenance, "You are not looking well.
Despite your great physical strength, you suffer like your own
sickly patients."</p>

<p>"True! I suffer at this moment, but not from bodily pain."</p>

<p>"You have some cause of mental disquietude?"</p>

<p>"Who in this world has not?"</p>

<p>"I never have."</p>

<p>"Because you own you have never loved. Certainly, you never seem
to care for any one but yourself; and in yourself you find an
unbroken sunny holiday,&mdash;high spirits, youth, health, beauty,
wealth. Happy boy!"</p>

<p>At that moment my heart was heavy within me.</p>

<p>Margrave resumed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among the secrets which your knowledge places at the command of
your art, what would you give for one which would enable you to
defy and to deride a rival where you place your affections, which
could lock to yourself, and imperiously control, the will of the
being whom you desire to fascinate, by an influence paramount,
transcendent?"</p>

<p>"Love has that secret," said I,&mdash;"and love alone."</p>

<p>"A power stronger than love can suspend, can change love itself.
But if love be the object or dream of your life, love is the rosy
associate of youth and beauty. Beauty soon fades, youth soon
departs. What if in nature there were means by which beauty and
youth can be fixed into blooming duration,&mdash;means that could
arrest the course, nay, repair the effects, of time on the elements
that make up the human frame?"</p>

<p>"Silly boy! Have the Rosicrucians bequeathed to you a
prescription for the elixir of life?"</p>

<p>"If I had the prescription I should not ask your aid to discover
its ingredients."</p>

<p>"And is it in the hope of that notable discovery you have
studied chemistry, electricity, and magnetism? Again I say, Silly
boy!"</p>

<p>Margrave did not heed my reply. His face was overcast, gloomy,
troubled.</p>

<p>"That the vital principle is a gas," said he, abruptly, "I am
fully convinced. Can that gas be the one which combines caloric
with oxygen?"</p>

<p>"Phosoxygen? Sir Humphrey Davy demonstrates that gas not to be,
as Lavoisier supposed, caloric, but light, combined with oxygen;
and he suggests, not indeed that it is the vital principle itself,
but the pabulum of life to organic beings." (1)</p>

<p>"Does he?" said Margrave, his, face clearing up. "Possibly,
possibly, then, here we approach the great secret of secrets. Look
you, Allen Fenwick: I promise to secure to you unfailing security
from all the jealous fears that now torture your heart; if you care
for that fame which to me is not worth the scent of a flower, the
balm of a breeze, I will impart to you a knowledge which, in the
hands of ambition, would dwarf into commonplace the boasted wonders
of recognized science. I will do all this, if, in return, but for
one month you will give yourself up to my guidance in whatever
experiments I ask, no matter how wild they may seem to you."</p>

<p>"My dear Margrave, I reject your bribes as I would reject the
moon and the stars which a child might offer to me in exchange for
a toy; but I may give the child its toy for nothing, and I may test
your experiments for nothing some day when I have leisure."</p>

<p>I did not hear Margrave's answer, for at that moment my servant
entered with letters. Lilian's hand! Tremblingly, breathlessly, I
broke the seal. Such a loving, bright, happy letter; so sweet in
its gentle chiding of my wrongful fears! It was implied rather than
said that Ashleigh Sumner had proposed and been refused. He had now
left the house. Lilian and her mother were coming back; in a few
days we should meet. In this letter were inclosed a few lines from
Mrs. Ashleigh. She was more explicit about my rival than Lilian had
been. If no allusion to his attentions had been made to me before,
it was from a delicate consideration for myself. Mrs. Ashleigh said
that "the young man had heard from L&mdash;&mdash; of our
engagement, and&mdash;disbelieved it;" but, as Mrs. Poyntz had so
shrewdly predicted, hurried at once to the avowal of his own
attachment, and the offer of his own hand. On Lilian's refusal his
pride had been deeply mortified. He had gone away manifestly in
more anger than sorrow.</p>

<pre>
   "Lady Delafield, dear Margaret Poyntz's aunt, had been most kind in
    trying to soothe Lady Haughton's disappointment, which was rudely
    expressed,&mdash;so rudely," added Mrs. Ashleigh, "that it gives us an
    excuse to leave sooner than had been proposed,&mdash;which I am very glad
    of.  Lady Delafield feels much for Mr. Sumner; has invited him to
    visit her at a place she has near Worthing.  She leaves to-morrow in
    order to receive him; promises to reconcile him to our rejection,
    which, as he was my poor Gilbert's heir, and was very friendly at
    first, would be a great relief to my mind.  Lilian is well, and so
    happy at the thoughts of coming back."

</pre>

<p>When I lifted my eyes from these letters I was as a new man, and
the earth seemed a new earth. I felt as if I had realized
Margrave's idle dreams,&mdash;as if youth could never fade, love
could never grow cold.</p>

<p>"You care for no secrets of mine at this moment," said Margrave,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Secrets!" I murmured; "none now are worth knowing. I am loved!
I am loved!"</p>

<p>"I bide my time," said Margrave; and as my eyes met his, I saw
there a look I had never seen in those eyes before, sinister,
wrathful, menacing. He turned away, went out through the sash-door
of the study; and as he passed towards the fields under the
luxuriant chestnut-trees, I heard his musical, barbaric
chant,&mdash;the song by which the serpent-charmer charms the
serpent,&mdash;sweet, so sweet, the very birds on the boughs hushed
their carol as if to listen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p>I called that day on Mrs. Poyntz, and communicated to her the
purport of the glad news I had received.</p>

<p>She was still at work on the everlasting knitting, her firm
fingers linking mesh into mesh as she listened; and when I had
done, she laid her skein deliberately down, and said, in her
favourite characteristic formula,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So at last?&mdash;that is settled!"</p>

<p>She rose and paced the room as men are apt to do in reflection,
women rarely need such movement to aid their thoughts; her eyes
were fixed on the floor, and one hand was lightly pressed on the
palm of the other,&mdash;the gesture of a musing reasoner who is
approaching the close of a difficult calculation.</p>

<p>At length she paused, fronting me, and said dryly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Accept my congratulations. Life smiles on you now; guard that
smile, and when we meet next, may we be even firmer friends than we
are now!"</p>

<p>"When we meet next,&mdash;that will be to-night&mdash;you surely
go to the mayor's great ball? All the Hill descends to Low Town
to-night."</p>

<p>"No; we are obliged to leave L&mdash;&mdash; this afternoon; in
less than two hours we shall be gone,&mdash;a family engagement. We
may be weeks away; you will excuse me, then, if I take leave of you
so unceremoniously. Stay, a motherly word of caution. That friend
of yours, Mr. Margrave! Moderate your intimacy with him; and
especially after you are married. There is in that stranger, of
whom so little is known, a something which I cannot
comprehend,&mdash;a something that captivates and yet revolts. I
find him disturbing my thoughts, perplexing my conjectures,
haunting my fancies,&mdash;I, plain woman of the world! Lilian is
imaginative; beware of her imagination, even when sure of her
heart. Beware of Margrave. The sooner he quits L&mdash;&mdash; the
better, believe me, for your peace of mind. Adieu! I must prepare
for our journey."</p>

<p>"That woman," muttered I, on quitting her house, "seems to have
some strange spite against my poor Lilian, ever seeking to rouse my
own distrust of that exquisite nature which has just given me such
proof of its truth. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;is that woman so
wrong here? True! Margrave with his wild notions, his strange
beauty!&mdash;true&mdash;true&mdash;he might dangerously encourage
that turn for the mystic and visionary which distresses me in
Lilian. Lilian should not know him. How induce him to leave
L&mdash;&mdash;? Ah, those experiments on which he asks my
assistance! I might commence them when he comes again, and then
invent some excuse to send him for completer tests to the famous
chemists of Paris or Berlin."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p>It is the night of the mayor's ball! The guests are assembling
fast; county families twelve miles round have been invited, as well
as the principal families of the town. All, before proceeding to
the room set apart for the dance, moved in procession through the
museum,&mdash;homage to science before pleasure!</p>

<p>The building was brilliantly lighted, and the effect was
striking, perhaps because singular and grotesque. There, amidst
stands of flowers and evergreens, lit up with coloured lamps, were
grouped the dead representatives of races all inferior&mdash;some
deadly&mdash;to man. The fancy of the ladies had been permitted to
decorate and arrange these types of the animal world. The tiger
glared with glass eyes from amidst artificial reeds and herbage, as
from his native jungle; the grisly white bear peered from a mimic
iceberg. There, in front, stood the sage elephant, facing a hideous
hippopotamus; whilst an anaconda twined its long spire round the
stem of some tropical tree in zinc. In glass cases, brought into
full light by festooned lamps, were dread specimens of the reptile
race,&mdash;scorpion and vampire, and cobra capella, with insects
of gorgeous hues, not a few of them with venomed stings.</p>

<p>But the chief boast of the collection was in the varieties of
the Genus Simia,&mdash;baboons and apes, chimpanzees, with their
human visage, mockeries of man, from the dwarf monkeys perched on
boughs lopped from the mayor's shrubberies, to the formidable
ourangoutang, leaning on his huge club.</p>

<p>Every one expressed to the mayor admiration, to each other
antipathy, for this unwonted and somewhat ghastly, though
instructive, addition to the revels of a ballroom.</p>

<p>Margrave, of course, was there, and seemingly quite at home,
gliding from group to group of gayly-dressed ladies, and brilliant
with a childish eagerness to play off the showman. Many of these
grim fellow-creatures he declared he had seen, played, or fought
with. He had something true or false to say about each. In his high
spirits he contrived to make the tiger move, and imitated the hiss
of the terribly anaconda. All that he did had its grace, its charm;
and the buzz of admiration and the flattering glances of ladies'
eyes followed him wherever he moved.</p>

<p>However, there was a general feeling of relief when the mayor
led the way from the museum into the ballroom. In provincial
parties guests arrive pretty much within the same hour, and so few
who had once paid their respects to the apes and serpents, the
hippopotamus and the tiger, were disposed to repeat the visit, that
long before eleven o'clock the museum was as free from the
intrusion of human life as the wilderness in which its dead
occupants had been born.</p>

<p>I had gone my round through the rooms, and, little disposed to
be social, had crept into the retreat of a window-niche, pleased to
think myself screened by its draperies,&mdash;not that I was
melancholy, far from it; for the letter I had received that morning
from Lilian had raised my whole being into a sovereignty of
happiness high beyond the reach of the young pleasure-hunters,
whose voices and laughter blended with that vulgar music.</p>

<p>To read her letter again I had stolen to my nook, and now, sure
that none saw me kiss it, I replaced it in my bosom. I looked
through the parted curtain; the room was comparatively empty; but
there, through the open folding-doors, I saw the gay crowd gathered
round the dancers, and there again, at right angles, a vista along
the corridor afforded a glimpse of the great elephant in the
deserted museum.</p>

<p>Presently I heard, close beside me, my host's voice.</p>

<p>"Here's a cool corner, a pleasant sofa, you can have it all to
yourself. What an honour to receive you under my roof, and on this
interesting occasion! Yes, as you say, there are great changes in
L&mdash;&mdash; since you left us. Society has much improved. I
must look about and find some persons to introduce to you. Clever!
oh, I know your tastes. We have a wonderful man,&mdash;a new
doctor. Carries all before him; very high character, too; good old
family, greatly looked up to, even apart from his profession.
Dogmatic a little,&mdash;a Sir Oracle,&mdash;'Lets no dog bark;'
you remember the quotation,&mdash;Shakspeare. Where on earth is he?
My dear Sir Philip, I am sure you would enjoy his
conversation."</p>

<p>Sir Philip! Could it be Sir Philip Derval to whom the mayor was
giving a flattering yet scarcely propitiatory description of
myself? Curiosity combined with a sense of propriety in not keeping
myself an unsuspected listener; I emerged from the curtain, but
silently, and reached the centre of the room before the mayor
perceived me. He then came up to me eagerly, linked his arm in
mine, and leading me to a gentleman seated on a sofa, close by the
window I had quitted, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doctor, I must present you to Sir Philip Derval, just returned
to England, and not six hours in L&mdash;&mdash;. If you would like
to see the museum again, Sir Philip, the doctor, I am sure, will
accompany you."</p>

<p>"No, I thank you; it is painful to me at present to see, even
under your roof, the collection which my poor dear friend, Dr.
Lloyd, was so proudly beginning to form when I left these
parts."</p>

<p>"Ay, Sir Philip, Dr. Lloyd was a worthy man in his way, but
sadly duped in his latter years; took to mesmerism, only think! But
our young doctor here showed him up, I can tell you."</p>

<p>Sir Philip, who had acknowledged my first introduction to his
acquaintance by the quiet courtesy with which a well-bred man goes
through a ceremony that custom enables him to endure with equal
ease and indifference, now evinced by a slight change of manner how
little the mayor's reference to my dispute with Dr. Lloyd advanced
me in his good opinion. He turned away with a bow more formal than
his first one, and said calmly,</p>

<p>"I regret to hear that a man so simple-minded and so sensitive
as Dr. Lloyd should have provoked an encounter in which I can well
conceive him to have been worsted. With your leave, Mr. Mayor, I
will look into your ballroom. I may perhaps find there some old
acquaintances."</p>

<p>He walked towards the dancers, and the mayor, linking his arm in
mine, followed close behind, saying in his loud hearty
tones,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come along, you too, Dr. Fenwick, my girls are there; you have
not spoken to them yet."</p>

<p>Sir Philip, who was then half way across the room, turned round
abruptly, and, looking me full in the face, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fenwick, is your name Fenwick,&mdash;Allen Fenwick?"</p>

<p>"That is my name, Sir Philip."</p>

<p>"Then permit me to shake you by the hand; you are no stranger,
and no mere acquaintance to me. Mr. Mayor, we will look into your
ballroom later; do not let us keep you now from your other
guests."</p>

<p>The mayor, not in the least offended by being thus summarily
dismissed, smiled, walked on, and was soon lost amongst the
crowd.</p>

<p>Sir Philip, still retaining my hand, reseated himself on the
sofa, and I took my place by his side. The room was still deserted;
now and then a straggler from the ballroom looked in for a moment,
and then sauntered back to the central place of attraction.</p>

<p>"I am trying to guess," said I, "how my name should be known to
you. Possibly you may, in some visit to the Lakes, have known my
father?"</p>

<p>"No; I know none of your name but yourself,&mdash;if, indeed, as
I doubt not, you are the Allen Fenwick to whom I owe no small
obligation. You were a medical student at Edinburgh in the year
&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So! At that time there was also at Edinburgh a young man, named
Richard Strahan. He lodged in a fourth flat in the Old Town."</p>

<p>"I remember him very well."</p>

<p>"And you remember, also, that a fire broke out at night in the
house in which he lodged; that when it was discovered there seemed
no hope of saving him. The flames wrapped the lower part of the
house; the staircase had given way. A boy, scarcely so old as
himself, was the only human being in the crowd who dared to scale
the ladder that even then scarcely reached the windows from which
the smoke rolled in volumes; that boy penetrated into the room,
found the inmate almost insensible, rallied, supported, dragged him
to the window, got him on the ladder,&mdash;saved his life then:
and his life later, by nursing with a woman's tenderness, through
the fever caused by terror and excitement, the fellow-creature he
had rescued by a man's daring. The name of that gallant student was
Allen Fenwick, and Richard Strahan is my nearest living relation.
Are we friends now?"</p>

<p>I answered confusedly. I had almost forgotten the circumstances
referred to. Richard Strahan had not been one of my more intimate
companions, and I had never seen nor heard of him since leaving
college. I inquired what had become of him.</p>

<p>"He is at the Scotch Bar," said Sir Philip, "and of course
without practice. I understand that he has fair average abilities,
but no application. If I am rightly informed, he is, however, a
thoroughly honourable, upright man, and of an affectionate and
grateful disposition."</p>

<p>"I can answer for all you have said in his praise. He had the
qualities you name too deeply rooted in youth to have lost them
now."</p>

<p>Sir Philip remained for some moments in a musing silence; and I
took advantage of that silence to examine him with more minute
attention than I had done before, much as the first sight of him
had struck me.</p>

<p>He was somewhat below the common height,&mdash;so delicately
formed that one might call him rather fragile than slight. But in
his carriage and air there was remarkable dignity. His countenance
was at direct variance with his figure; for as delicacy was the
attribute of the last, so power was unmistakably the characteristic
of the first. He looked fully the age his steward had ascribed to
him,&mdash;about forty-eight; at a superficial glance, more, for
his hair was prematurely white,&mdash;not gray, but white as snow.
But his eyebrows were still jet black, and his eyes, equally dark,
were serenely bright. His forehead was magnificent,&mdash;lofty and
spacious, and with only one slight wrinkle between the brows. His
complexion was sunburnt, showing no sign of weak health. The
outline of his lips was that which I have often remarked in men
accustomed to great dangers, and contracting in such dangers the
habit of self-reliance,&mdash;firm and quiet, compressed without an
effort. And the power of this very noble countenance was not
intimidating, not aggressive; it was mild, it was benignant. A man
oppressed by some formidable tyranny, and despairing to find a
protector, would, on seeing that face, have said, "Here is one who
can protect me, and who will!"</p>

<p>Sir Philip was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>"I have so many relations scattered over England, that
fortunately not one of them can venture to calculate on my property
if I die childless, and therefore not one of them can feel himself
injured when, a few weeks hence, he shall read in the newspapers
that Philip Derval is married. But for Richard Strahan at least,
though I never saw him, I must do something before the newspapers
make that announcement. His sister was very dear to me."</p>

<p>"Your neighbours, Sir Philip, will rejoice at your marriage,
since, I presume, it may induce you to settle amongst them at
Derval Court."</p>

<p>"At Derval Court! No! I shall not settle there." Again he paused
a moment or so, and then went on: "I have long lived a wandering
life, and in it learned much that the wisdom of cities cannot
teach. I return to my native land with a profound conviction that
the happiest life is the life most in common with all. I have gone
out of my way to do what I deemed good, and to avert or mitigate
what appeared to me evil. I pause now and ask myself, whether the
most virtuous existence be not that in which virtue flows
spontaneously from the springs of quiet everyday action; when a man
does good without restlessly seeking it, does good unconsciously,
simply because he is good and he lives. Better, perhaps, for me, if
I had thought so long ago! And now I come back to England with the
intention of marrying, late in life though it be, and with such
hopes of happiness as any matter-of-fact man may form. But my hope
will not be at Derval Court. I shall reside either in London or its
immediate neighbourhood, and seek to gather round me minds by which
I can correct, if I cannot confide to them, the knowledge I myself
have acquired."</p>

<p>"Nay, if, as I have accidentally heard, you are fond of
scientific pursuits, I cannot wonder, that after so long an absence
from England, you should feel interest in learning what new
discoveries have been made, what new ideas are unfolding the germs
of discoveries yet to be. But, pardon me, if in answer to your
concluding remark, I venture to say that no man can hope to correct
any error in his own knowledge, unless he has the courage to
confide the error to those who can correct. La Place has said,
'Tout se tient dans le chaine immense des verites;' and the mistake
we make in some science we have specially cultivated is often only
to be seen by the light of a separate science as specially
cultivated by another. Thus, in the investigation of truth, frank
exposition to congenial minds is essential to the earnest
seeker."</p>

<p>"I am pleased with what you say," said Sir Philip, "and I shall
be still more pleased to find in you the very confidant I require.
But what was your controversy with my old friend, Dr. Lloyd? Do I
understand our host rightly, that it related to what in Europe has
of late days obtained the name of mesmerism?"</p>

<p>I had conceived a strong desire to conciliate the good opinion
of a man who had treated me with so singular and so familiar a
kindness, and it was sincerely that I expressed my regret at the
acerbity with which I had assailed Dr. Lloyd; but of his theories
and pretensions I could not disguise my contempt. I enlarged on the
extravagant fallacies involved in a fabulous "clairvoyance," which
always failed when put to plain test by sober-minded examiners. I
did not deny the effects of imagination on certain nervous
constitutions. "Mesmerism could cure nobody; credulity could cure
many. There was the well-known story of the old woman tried as a
witch; she cured agues by a charm. She owned the impeachment, and
was ready to endure gibbet or stake for the truth of her
talisman,&mdash;more than a mesmerist would for the truth of his
passes! And the charm was a scroll of gibberish sewn in an old bag
and given to the woman in a freak by the judge himself when a young
scamp on the circuit. But the charm cured? Certainly; just as
mesmerism cures. Fools believed in it. Faith, that moves mountains,
may well cure agues."</p>

<p>Thus I ran on, supporting my views with anecdote and facts, to
which Sir Philip listened with placid gravity.</p>

<p>When I had come to an end he said: "Of mesmerism, as practised
in Europe, I know nothing except by report. I can well understand
that medical men may hesitate to admit it amongst the legitimate
resources of orthodox pathology; because, as I gather from what you
and others say of its practice, it must, at the best, be far too
uncertain in its application to satisfy the requirements of
science. Yet an examination of its pretensions may enable you to
perceive the truth that lies hid in the powers ascribed to
witchcraft; benevolence is but a weak agency compared to malignity;
magnetism perverted to evil may solve half the riddles of sorcery.
On this, however, I say no more at present. But as to that which
you appear to reject as the most preposterous and incredible
pretension of the mesmerists, and which you designate by the word
'clairvoyance,' it is clear to me that you have never yourself
witnessed even those very imperfect exhibitions which you decide at
once to be imposture. I say imperfect, because it is only a limited
number of persons whom the eye or the passes of the mesmerist can
effect; and by such means, unaided by other means, it is rarely
indeed that the magnetic sleep advances beyond the first vague
shadowy twilight-dawn of that condition to which only in its fuller
developments I would apply the name of 'trance.' But still trance
is as essential a condition of being as sleep or as waking, having
privileges peculiar to itself. By means within the range of the
science that explores its nature and its laws, trance, unlike the
clairvoyance you describe, is producible in every human being,
however unimpressible to mere mesmerism."</p>

<p>"Producible in every human being! Pardon me if I say that I will
give any enchanter his own terms who will produce that effect upon
me."</p>

<p>"Will you? You consent to have the experiment tried on
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Consent most readily."</p>

<p>"I will remember that promise. But to return to the subject. By
the word 'trance' I do not mean exclusively the spiritual trance of
the Alexandrian Platonists. There is one kind of trance,&mdash;that
to which all human beings are susceptible,&mdash;in which the soul
has no share: for of this kind of trance, and it was of this I
spoke, some of the inferior animals are susceptible; and,
therefore, trance is no more a proof of soul than is the
clairvoyance of the mesmerists, or the dream of our ordinary sleep,
which last has been called a proof of soul, though any man who has
kept a dog must have observed that dogs dream as vividly as we do.
But in this trance there is an extraordinary cerebral activity, a
projectile force given to the mind, distinct from the soul, by
which it sends forth its own emanations to a distance in spite of
material obstacles, just as a flower, in an altered condition of
atmosphere, sends forth the particles of its aroma. This should not
surprise you. Your thought travels over land and sea in your waking
state; thought, too, can travel in trance, and in trance may
acquire an intensified force. There is, however, another kind of
trance which is truly called spiritual, a trance much more rare,
and in which the soul entirely supersedes the mere action of the
mind."</p>

<p>"Stay!" said I; "you speak of the soul as something distinct
from the mind. What the soul may be, I cannot pretend to
conjecture; but I cannot separate it from the intelligence!"</p>

<p>"Can you not? A blow on the brain can destroy the intelligence!
Do you think it can destroy the soul?</p>

<pre>
   'From Marlbro's eyes the tears of dotage flow,
    And Swift expires, a driveller and a show.'
</pre>

<p>"Towards the close of his life even Kant's giant intellect left
him. Do you suppose that in these various archetypes of
intellectual man the soul was worn out by the years that loosened
the strings, or made tuneless the keys, of the perishing instrument
on which the mind must rely for all notes of its music? If you
cannot distinguish the operations of the mind from the essence of
the soul, I know not by what rational inductions you arrive at the
conclusion that the soul is imperishable."</p>

<p>I remained silent. Sir Philip fixed on me his dark eyes quietly
and searchingly, and, after a short pause, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Almost every known body in nature is susceptible of three
several states of existence,&mdash;the solid, the liquid, the
aeriform. These conditions depend on the quantity of heat they
contain. The same object at one moment may be liquid; at the next
moment solid; at the next aeriform. The water that flows before
your gaze may stop consolidated into ice, or ascend into air as a
vapour. Thus is man susceptible of three states of
existence,&mdash;the animal, the mental, the spiritual; and
according as he is brought into relation or affinity with that
occult agency of the whole natural world, which we familiarly call
heat, and which no science has yet explained, which no scale can
weigh, and no eye discern, one or the other of these three states
of being prevails, or is subjected."</p>

<p>I still continued silent, for I was unwilling discourteously to
say to a stranger so much older than myself, that he seemed to me
to reverse all the maxims of the philosophy to which he made
pretence, in founding speculations audacious and abstruse upon
unanalogous comparisons that would have been fantastic even in a
poet. And Sir Philip, after another pause, resumed with a half
smile,&mdash;</p>

<p>"After what I have said, it will perhaps not very much surprise
you when I add that but for my belief in the powers I ascribe to
trance, we should not be known to each other at this moment."</p>

<p>"How? Pray explain!"</p>

<p>"Certain circumstances, which I trust to relate to you in detail
hereafter, have imposed on me the duty to discover, and to bring
human laws to bear upon, a creature armed with terrible powers of
evil. This monster, for without metaphor, monster it is, not man
like ourselves, has, by arts superior to those of ordinary
fugitives, however dexterous in concealment, hitherto for years
eluded my research. Through the trance of an Arab child, who, in
her waking state, never heard of his existence, I have learned that
this being is in England, is in L&mdash;&mdash;. I am here to
encounter him. I expect to do so this very night, and under this
very roof."</p>

<p>"Sir Philip!"</p>

<p>"And if you wonder, as you well may, why I have been talking to
you with this startling unreserve, know that the same Arab child,
on whom I thus implicitly rely, informs me that your life is mixed
up with that of the being I seek to unmask and disarm,&mdash;to be
destroyed by his arts or his agents, or to combine in the causes by
which the destroyer himself shall be brought to destruction."</p>

<p>"My life!&mdash;your Arab child named me, Allen Fenwick?"</p>

<p>"My Arab child told me that the person in whom I should thus
naturally seek an ally was he who had saved the life of the man
whom I then meant for my heir, if I died unmarried and childless.
She told me that I should not be many hours in this town, which she
described minutely, before you would be made known to me. She
described this house, with yonder lights, and yon dancers. In her
trance she saw us sitting together, as we now sit. I accepted the
invitation of our host, when he suddenly accosted me on entering
the town, confident that I should meet you here, without even
asking whether a person of your name were a resident in the place;
and now you know why I have so freely unbosomed myself of much that
might well make you, a physician, doubt the soundness of my
understanding. The same infant, whose vision has been realized up
to this moment, has warned me also that I am here at great peril.
What that peril may be I have declined to learn, as I have ever
declined to ask from the future what affects only my own life on
this earth. That life I regard with supreme indifference, conscious
that I have only to discharge, while it lasts, the duties for which
it is bestowed on me, to the best of my imperfect power; and aware
that minds the strongest and souls the purest may fall into the
sloth habitual to predestinarians, if they suffer the action due to
the present hour to be awed and paralyzed by some grim shadow on
the future! It is only where, irrespectively of aught that can
menace myself, a light not struck out of my own reason can guide me
to disarm evil or minister to good, that I feel privileged to avail
myself of those mirrors on which things, near and far, reflect
themselves calm and distinct as the banks and the mountain peak are
reflected in the glass of a lake. Here, then, under this roof, and
by your side, I shall behold him who&mdash;Lo! the moment has
come,&mdash;I behold him now!"</p>

<p>As he spoke these last words, Sir Philip had risen, and,
startled by his action and voice, I involuntarily rose too. Resting
one hand on my shoulder, he pointed with the other towards the
threshold of the ballroom. There, the prominent figure of a gay
group&mdash;the sole male amidst a fluttering circle of silks and
lawn, of flowery wreaths, of female loveliness and female
frippery&mdash;stood the radiant image of Margrave. His eyes were
not turned towards us. He was looking down, and his light laugh
came soft, yet ringing, through the general murmur.</p>

<p>I turned my astonished gaze back to Sir Philip; yes,
unmistakably it was on Margrave that his look was fixed. Impossible
to associate crime with the image of that fair youth! Eccentric
notions, fantastic speculations, vivacious egotism, defective
benevolence,&mdash;yes. But crime! No! impossible!</p>

<p>"Impossible," I said aloud. As I spoke, the group had moved on.
Margrave was no longer in sight. At the same moment some other
guests came from the ballroom, and seated themselves near us.</p>

<p>Sir Philip looked round, and, observing the deserted museum at
the end of the corridor, drew me into it.</p>

<p>When we were alone, he said in a voice quick and low, but
decided,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is of importance that I should convince you at once of the
nature of that prodigy which is more hostile to mankind than the
wolf is to the sheepfold. No words of mine could at present suffice
to clear your sight from the deception which cheats it. I must
enable you to judge for yourself. It must be now and here. He will
learn this night, if he has not learned already, that I am in the
town. Dim and confused though his memories of myself may be, they
are memories still; and he well knows what cause he has to dread
me. I must put another in possession of his secret. Another, and at
once! For all his arts will be brought to bear against me, and I
cannot foretell their issue. Go, then; enter that giddy crowd,
select that seeming young man, bring him hither. Take care only not
to mention my name; and when here, turn the key in the door, so as
to prevent interruption,&mdash;five minutes will suffice."</p>

<p>"Am I sure that I guess whom you mean? The young light-hearted
man, known in this place under the name of Margrave? The young man
with the radiant eyes, and the curls of a Grecian statue?"</p>

<p>"The same; him whom I pointed out. Quick, bring him hither."</p>

<p>My curiosity was too much roused to disobey. Had I conceived
that Margrave, in the heat of youth, had committed some offence
which placed him in danger of the law and in the power of Sir
Philip Derval, I possessed enough of the old borderer's black-mail
loyalty to have given the man whose hand I had familiarly clasped a
hint and a help to escape. But all Sir Philip's talk had been so
out of the reach of common-sense, that I rather expected to see him
confounded by some egregious illusion than Margrave exposed to any
well-grounded accusation. All, then, that I felt as I walked into
the ballroom and approached Margrave was that curiosity which, I
think, any one of my readers will acknowledge that, in my position,
he himself would have felt.</p>

<p>Margrave was standing near the dancers, not joining them, but
talking with a young couple in the ring. I drew him aside.</p>

<p>"Come with me for a few minutes into the museum; I wish to talk
to you."</p>

<p>"What about,&mdash;an experiment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, an experiment."</p>

<p>"Then I am at your service."</p>

<p>In a minute more, he had followed me into the desolate dead
museum. I looked round, but did not see Sir Philip.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p>MARGRAVE threw himself on a seat just under the great anaconda;
I closed and locked the door. When I had done so, my eye fell on
the young man's face, and I was surprised to see that it had lost
its colour; that it showed great anxiety, great distress; that his
hands were visibly trembling.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he said in feeble tones, and raising himself
half from his seat as if with great effort. "Help me up! come away!
Something in this room is hostile to me, hostile, overpowering!
What can it be?"</p>

<p>"Truth and my presence," answered a stern, low voice; and Sir
Philip Derval, whose slight form the huge bulk of the dead elephant
had before obscured from my view, came suddenly out from the shadow
into the full rays of the lamps which lit up, as if for Man's
revel, that mocking catacomb for the playmates of Nature which he
enslaves for his service or slays for his sport. As Sir Philip
spoke and advanced, Margrave sank back into his seat, shrinking,
collapsing, nerveless; terror the most abject expressed in his
staring eyes and parted lips. On the other hand, the simple dignity
of Sir Philip Derval's bearing, and the mild power of his
countenance, were alike inconceivably heightened. A change had come
over the whole man, the more impressive because wholly
undefinable.</p>

<p>Halting opposite Margrave he uttered some words in a language
unknown to me, and stretched one hand over the young man's head.
Margrave at once became stiff and rigid, as if turned to stone. Sir
Philip said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Place one of those lamps on the floor,&mdash;there, by his
feet."</p>

<p>I took down one of the coloured lamps from the mimic tree round
which the huge anaconda coiled its spires, and placed it as I was
told.</p>

<p>"Take the seat opposite to him, and watch."</p>

<p>I obeyed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sir Philip had drawn from his breast-pocket a small
steel casket, and I observed, as he opened it, that the interior
was subdivided into several compartments, each with its separate
lid; from one of these he took and sprinkled over the flame of the
lamp a few grains of a powder, colourless and sparkling as diamond
dust. In a second or so, a delicate perfume, wholly unfamiliar to
my sense, rose from the lamp.</p>

<p>"You would test the condition of trance; test it, and in the
spirit."</p>

<p>And, as he spoke, his hand rested lightly on my head. Hitherto,
amidst a surprise not unmixed with awe, I had preserved a certain
defiance, a certain distrust. I had been, as it were, on my
guard.</p>

<p>But as those words were spoken, as that hand rested on my head,
as that perfume arose from the lamp, all power of will deserted me.
My first sensation was that of passive subjugation; but soon I was
aware of a strange intoxicating effect from the odour of the lamp,
round which there now played a dazzling vapour. The room swam
before me. Like a man oppressed by a nightmare, I tried to move, to
cry out, feeling that to do so would suffice to burst the thrall
that bound me: in vain.</p>

<p>A time that seemed to me inexorably long, but which, as I found
afterwards, could only have occupied a few seconds, elapsed in this
preliminary state, which, however powerless, was not without a
vague luxurious sense of delight. And then suddenly came
pain,&mdash;pain, that in rapid gradations passed into a rending
agony. Every bone, sinew, nerve, fibre of the body, seemed as if
wrenched open, and as if some hitherto unconjectured Presence in
the vital organization were forcing itself to light with all the
pangs of travail. The veins seemed swollen to bursting, the heart
labouring to maintain its action by fierce spasms. I feel in this
description how language fails me. Enough that the anguish I then
endured surpassed all that I have ever experienced of physical
pain. This dreadful interval subsided as suddenly as it had
commenced. I felt as if a something undefinable by any name had
rushed from me, and in that rush that a struggle was over. I was
sensible of the passive bliss which attends the release from
torture, and then there grew on me a wonderful calm, and, in that
calm, a consciousness of some lofty intelligence immeasurably
beyond that which human memory gathers from earthly knowledge. I
saw before me the still rigid form of Margrave, and my sight
seemed, with ease, to penetrate through its covering of flesh, and
to survey the mechanism of the whole interior being.</p>

<p>"View that tenement of clay which now seems so fair, as it was
when I last beheld it, three years ago, in the house of Haroun of
Aleppo!"</p>

<p>I looked, and gradually, and as shade after shade falls on the
mountain side, while the clouds gather, and the sun vanishes at
last, so the form and face on which I looked changed from exuberant
youth into infirm old age,&mdash;the discoloured wrinkled skin, the
bleared dim eye, the flaccid muscles, the brittle sapless bones.
Nor was the change that of age alone; the expression of the
countenance had passed into gloomy discontent, and in every furrow
a passion or a vice had sown the seeds of grief.</p>

<p>And the brain now opened on my sight, with all its labyrinth of
cells. I seemed to have the clew to every winding in the maze.</p>

<p>I saw therein a moral world, charred and ruined, as, in some
fable I have read, the world of the moon is described to be; yet
withal it was a brain of magnificent formation. The powers abused
to evil had been originally of rare order,&mdash;imagination, and
scope, the energies that dare, the faculties that discover. But the
moral part of the brain had failed to dominate the
mental,&mdash;defective veneration of what is good or great;
cynical disdain of what is right and just; in fine, a great
intellect first misguided, then perverted, and now falling with the
decay of the body into ghastly but imposing ruins,&mdash;such was
the world of that brain as it had been three years ago. And still
continuing to gaze thereon, I observed three separate emanations of
light,&mdash;the one of a pale red hue, the second of a pale azure,
the third a silvery spark.</p>

<p>The red light, which grew paler and paler as I looked, undulated
from the brain along the arteries, the veins, the nerves. And I
murmured to myself, "Is this the principle of animal life?"</p>

<p>The azure light equally permeated the frame, crossing and
uniting with the red, but in a separate and distinct ray, exactly
as, in the outer world, a ray of light crosses or unites with a ray
of heat, though in itself a separate individual agency. And again I
murmured to myself, "Is this the principle of intellectual being,
directing or influencing that of animal life; with it, yet not of
it?"</p>

<p>But the silvery spark! What was that? Its centre seemed the
brain; but I could fix it to no single organ. Nay, wherever I
looked through the system, it reflected itself as a star reflects
itself upon water. And I observed that while the red light was
growing feebler and feebler, and the azure light was confused,
irregular,&mdash;now obstructed, now hurrying, now almost
lost,&mdash;the silvery spark was unaltered, undisturbed. So
independent was it of all which agitated and vexed the frame, that
I became strangely aware that if the heart stopped in its action,
and the red light died out; if the brain were paralyzed, that
energetic mind smitten into idiotcy, and the azure light wandering
objectless as a meteor wanders over the morass,&mdash;still that
silver spark would shine the same, indestructible by aught that
shattered its tabernacle. And I murmured to myself, "Can that
starry spark speak the presence of the soul? Does the silver light
shine within creatures to which no life immortal has been promised
by Divine Revelation?"</p>

<p>Involuntarily I turned my sight towards the dead forms in the
motley collection, and lo, in my trance or my vision, life returned
to them all!&mdash;to the elephant and the serpent; to the tiger,
the vulture, the beetle, the moth; to the fish and the polypus, and
to yon mockery of man in the giant ape.</p>

<p>I seemed to see each as it lived in its native realm of earth,
or of air, or of water; and the red light played more or less warm
through the structure of each, and the azure light, though duller
of hue, seemed to shoot through the red, and communicate to the
creatures an intelligence far inferior indeed to that of man, but
sufficing to conduct the current of their will, and influence the
cunning of their instincts. But in none, from the elephant to the
moth, from the bird in which brain was the largest to the hybrid in
which life seemed to live as in plants,&mdash;in none was visible
the starry silver spark. I turned my eyes from the creatures
around, back again to the form cowering under the huge anaconda,
and in terror at the animation which the carcasses took in the
awful illusions of that marvellous trance; for the tiger moved as
if scenting blood, and to the eyes of the serpent the dread
fascination seemed slowly returning.</p>

<p>Again I gazed on the starry spark in the form of the man. And I
murmured to myself, "But if this be the soul, why is it so
undisturbed and undarkened by the sins which have left such trace
and such ravage in the world of the brain?" And gazing yet more
intently on the spark, I became vaguely aware that it was not the
soul, but the halo around the soul, as the star we see in heaven is
not the star itself, but its circle of rays; and if the light
itself was undisturbed and undarkened, it was because no sins done
in the body could annihilate its essence, nor affect the eternity
of its duration. The light was clear within the ruins of its
lodgment, because it might pass away, but could not be
extinguished.</p>

<p>But the soul itself in the heart of the light reflected back on
my own soul within me its ineffable trouble, humiliation, and
sorrow; for those ghastly wrecks of power placed at its sovereign
command it was responsible, and, appalled by its own sublime fate
of duration, was about to carry into eternity the account of its
mission in time. Yet it seemed that while the soul was still there,
though so forlorn and so guilty, even the wrecks around it were
majestic. And the soul, whatever sentence it might merit, was not
among the hopelessly lost; for in its remorse and its shame, it
might still have retained what could serve for redemption. And I
saw that the mind was storming the soul, in some terrible
rebellious war,&mdash;all of thought, of passion, of desire,
through which the azure light poured its restless flow, were
surging up round the starry spark, as in siege. And I could not
comprehend the war, nor guess what it was that the mind demanded
the soul to yield. Only the distinction between the two was made
intelligible by their antagonism. And I saw that the soul, sorely
tempted, looked afar for escape from the subjects it had ever so
ill controlled, and who sought to reduce to their vassal the power
which had lost authority as their king. I could feel its terror in
the sympathy of my own terror, the keenness of my own supplicating
pity. I knew that it was imploring release from the perils it
confessed its want of strength to encounter. And suddenly the
starry spark rose from the ruins and the tumult around
it,&mdash;rose into space and vanished; and where my soul had
recognized the presence of soul, there was a void. But the red
light burned still, becoming more and more vivid; and as it thus
repaired and recruited its lustre, the whole animal form, which had
been so decrepit, grew restored from decay, grew into vigour and
youth: and I saw Margrave as I had seen him in the waking world,
the radiant image of animal life in the beauty of its fairest
bloom.</p>

<p>And over this rich vitality and this symmetric mechanism now
reigned only, with the animal life, the mind. The starry light fled
and the soul vanished, still was left visible the mind,&mdash;mind,
by which sensations convey and cumulate ideas, and muscles obey
volition; mind, as in those animals that have more than the
elementary, instincts; mind, as it might be in men, were men not
immortal. As my eyes, in the Vision, followed the azure light,
undulating as before, through the cells of the brain, and crossing
the red amidst the labyrinth of the nerves, I perceived that the
essence of that azure light had undergone a change: it had lost
that faculty of continuous and concentred power by which man
improves on the works of the past, and weaves schemes to be
developed in the future of remote generations; it had lost all
sympathy in the past, because it had lost all conception of a
future beyond the grave; it had lost conscience, it had lost
remorse; the being it informed was no longer accountable through
eternity for the employment of time. The azure light was even more
vivid in certain organs useful to the conservation of existence, as
in those organs I had observed it more vivid among some of the
inferior animals than it is in man,&mdash;secretiveness,
destructiveness, and the ready perception of things immediate to
the wants of the day; and the azure light was brilliant in cerebral
cells, where before it had been dark, such as those which harbour
mirthfulness and hope, for there the light was recruited by the
exuberant health of the joyous animal-being. But it was lead-like,
or dim, in the great social organs, through which man subordinates
his own interest to that of his species, and utterly lost in those
through which man is reminded of his duties to the throne of his
Maker.</p>

<p>In that marvellous penetration with which the Vision endowed me,
I perceived that in this mind, though in energy far superior to
many; though retaining, from memories of the former existence, the
relics of a culture wide and in some things profound; though
sharpened and quickened into formidable, if desultory, force
whenever it schemed or aimed at the animal self-conservation which
now made its master&mdash;impulse or instinct; and though among the
reminiscences of its state before its change were arts which I
could not comprehend, but which I felt were dark and terrible,
lending to a will never checked by remorse arms that no healthful
philosophy has placed in the arsenal of disciplined genius; though
the mind in itself had an ally in a body as perfect in strength and
elasticity as man can take from the favour of nature,&mdash;still,
I say, I felt that the mind wanted the something without which men
never could found cities, frame laws, bind together, beautify,
exalt the elements of this world, by creeds that habitually subject
them to a reference to another. The ant and the bee and the beaver
congregate and construct; but they do not improve. Man improves
because the future impels onward that which is not found in the
ant, the bee, and the beaver,&mdash;that which was gone from the
being before me.</p>

<p>I shrank appalled into myself, covered my face with my hands,
and groaned aloud: "Have I ever then doubted that soul is distinct
from mind?"</p>

<p>A hand here again touched my forehead, the light in the lamp was
extinguished, I became insensible; and when I recovered I found
myself back in the room in which I had first conversed with Sir
Philip Derval, and seated, as before, on the sofa, by his side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>

<p>My recollections of all which I have just attempted to describe
were distinct and vivid; except with respect to time, it seemed to
me as if many hours must have elapsed since I had entered the
museum with Margrave; but the clock on the mantelpiece met my eyes
as I turned them wistfully round the room; and I was indeed amazed
to perceive that five minutes had sufficed for all which it has
taken me so long to narrate, and which in their transit had hurried
me through ideas and emotions so remote from anterior
experience.</p>

<p>To my astonishment now succeeded shame and
indignation,&mdash;shame that I, who had scoffed at the possibility
of the comparatively credible influences of mesmeric action, should
have been so helpless a puppet under the hand of the slight
fellow-man beside me, and so morbidly impressed by phantasmagorieal
illusions; indignation that, by some fumes which had special
potency over the brain, I had thus been, as it were, conjured out
of my senses; and looking full into the calm face at my side, I
said, with a smile to which I sought to convey disdain,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Sir Philip Derval, on having learned in
your travels in the East so expert a familiarity with the tricks of
its jugglers."</p>

<p>"The East has a proverb," answered Sir Philip, quietly, "that
the juggler may learn much from the dervish, but the dervish can
learn nothing from the juggler. You will pardon me, however, for
the effect produced on you for a few minutes, whatever the cause of
it may be, since it may serve to guard your whole life from
calamities, to which it might otherwise have been exposed. And
however you may consider that which you have just experienced to be
a mere optical illusion, or the figment of a brain super-excited by
the fumes of a vapour, look within yourself, and tell me if you do
not feel an inward and unanswerable conviction that there is more
reason to shun and to fear the creature you left asleep under the
dead jaws of the giant serpent, than there would be in the serpent
itself, could hunger again move its coils, and venom again arm its
fangs."</p>

<p>I was silent, for I could not deny that that conviction had come
to me.</p>

<p>"Henceforth, when you recover from the confusion or anger which
now disturbs your impressions, you will be prepared to listen to my
explanations and my recital in a spirit far different from that
with which you would have received them before you were subjected
to the experiment, which, allow me to remind you, you invited and
defied. You will now, I trust, be fitted to become my confidant and
my assistant; you will advise with me how, for the sake of
humanity, we should act together against the incarnate lie, the
anomalous prodigy which glides through the crowd in the image of
joyous beauty. For the present I quit you. I have an engagement, on
worldly affairs, in the town this night. I am staying at
L&mdash;&mdash;, which I shall leave for Derval Court tomorrow
evening. Come to me there the day after to-morrow, at any hour that
may suit you the best. Adieu!"</p>

<p>Here Sir Philip Derval rose and left the room. I made no effort
to detain him. My mind was too occupied in striving to recompose
itself and account for the phenomena that had scared it, and for
the strength of the impressions it still retained.</p>

<p>I sought to find natural and accountable causes for effects so
abnormal.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon suggests that the ointments with which witches
anointed themselves might have had the effect of stopping the pores
and congesting the rain, and thus impressing the sleep of the
unhappy dupes of their own imagination with dreams so vivid that,
on waking, they were firmly convinced that they had been borne
through the air to the Sabbat.</p>

<p>I remember also having heard a distinguished French
traveller&mdash;whose veracity was unquestionable&mdash;say, that
he had witnessed extraordinary effects produced on the sensorium by
certain fumigations used by an African pretender to magic. A
person, of however healthy a brain; subjected to the influence of
these fumigations, was induced to believe that he saw the most
frightful apparitions.</p>

<p>However extraordinary such effects, they were not
incredible,&mdash;not at variance with our notions of the known
laws of nature. And to the vapour or the odours which a powder
applied to a lamp had called forth, I was, therefore, prepared to
ascribe properties similar to those which Bacon's conjecture
ascribed to the witches' ointment, and the French traveller to the
fumigations of the African conjuror.</p>

<p>But, as I came to that conclusion, I was seized with an intense
curiosity to examine for myself those chemical agencies with which
Sir Philip Derval appeared so familiar; to test the contents in
that mysterious casket of steel. I also felt a curiosity no less
eager, but more, in spite of myself, intermingled with fear, to
learn all that Sir Philip had to communicate of the past history of
Margrave. I could but suppose that the young man must indeed be a
terrible criminal, for a person of years so grave, and station so
high, to intimate accusations so vaguely dark, and to use means so
extraordinary, in order to enlist my imagination rather than my
reason against a youth in whom there appeared none of the signs
which suspicion interprets into guilt.</p>

<p>While thus musing, I lifted my eyes and saw Margrave himself
there at the threshold of the ballroom,&mdash;there, where Sir
Philip had first pointed him out as the criminal he had come to
L&mdash;&mdash; to seek and disarm; and now, as then, Margrave was
the radiant centre of a joyous group. Not the young boy-god
Iacchus, amidst his nymphs, could, in Grecian frieze or picture,
have seemed more the type of the sportive, hilarious vitality of
sensuous nature. He must have passed unobserved by me, in my
preoccupation of thought, from the museum and across the room in
which I sat; and now there was as little trace in that animated
countenance of the terror it had exhibited at Sir Philip's
approach, as of the change it had undergone in my trance or my
fantasy.</p>

<p>But he caught sight of me, left his young companions, came gayly
to my side.</p>

<p>"Did you not ask me to go with you into that museum about half
an hour ago, or did I dream that I went with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you went with me into that museum."</p>

<p>"Then pray what dull theme did you select to set me asleep
there?"</p>

<p>I looked hard at him, and made no reply. Somewhat to my relief,
I now heard my host's voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Fenwick, what has become of Sir Philip Derval?"</p>

<p>"He has left; he had business." And, as I spoke, again I looked
hard on Margrave.</p>

<p>His countenance now showed a change; not surprise, not dismay,
but rather a play of the lip, a flash of the eye, that indicated
complacency,&mdash;even triumph.</p>

<p>"So! Sir Philip Derval! He is in L&mdash;&mdash;; he has been
here to-night? So! as I expected."</p>

<p>"Did you expect it?" said our host. "No one else did. Who could
have told you?"</p>

<p>"The movements of men so distinguished need never take us by
surprise. I knew he was in Paris the other day. It is natural eno'
that he should come here. I was prepared for his coming."</p>

<p>Margrave here turned away towards the window, which he threw
open and looked out.</p>

<p>"There is a storm in the air," said he, as he continued to gaze
into the night.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Margrave was so wholly unconscious of what
had passed in the museum as to include in oblivion even the
remembrance of Sir Philip Derval's presence before he had been
rendered insensible, or laid asleep? Was it now only for the first
time that he learned of Sir Philip's arrival in L&mdash;&mdash;,
and visit to that house? Was there any intimation of menace in his
words and his aspect?</p>

<p>I felt that the trouble of my thoughts communicated itself to my
countenance and manner; and, longing for solitude and fresh air, I
quitted the house. When I found myself in the street I turned round
and saw Margrave still standing at the open window, but he did not
appear to notice me; his eyes seemed fixed abstractedly on
space.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p>I walked on slowly and with the downcast brow of a man absorbed
in meditation. I had gained the broad place in which the main
streets of the town converged, when I was overtaken by a violent
storm of rain. I sought shelter under the dark archway of that
entrance to the district of Abbey Hill which was still called
Monk's Gate. The shadow within the arch was so deep that I was not
aware that I had a companion till I heard my own name, close at my
side. I recognized the voice before I could distinguish the form of
Sir Philip Derval.</p>

<p>"The storm will soon be over," said he, quietly. "I saw it
coming on in time. I fear you neglected the first warning of those
sable clouds, and must be already drenched."</p>

<p>I made no reply, but moved involuntarily away towards the mouth
of the arch.</p>

<p>"I see that you cherish a grudge against me!" resumed Sir
Philip. "Are you, then, by nature vindictive?"</p>

<p>Somewhat softened by the friendly tone of this reproach, I
answered, half in jest, half in earnest,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You must own, Sir Philip, that I have some little reason for
the uncharitable anger your question imputes to me. But I can
forgive you, on one condition."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The possession for half an hour of that mysterious steel casket
which you carry about with you, and full permission to analyze and
test its contents."</p>

<p>"Your analysis of the contents," returned Sir Philip, dryly,
"would leave you as ignorant as before of the uses to which they
can be applied; but I will own to you frankly, that it is my
intention to select some confidant among men of science, to whom I
may safely communicate the wonderful properties which certain
essences in that casket possess. I invite your acquaintance, nay,
your friendship, in the hope that I may find such a confidant in
you. But the casket contains other combinations, which, if wasted,
could not be resupplied,&mdash;at least by any process which the
great Master from whom I received them placed within reach of my
knowledge. In this they resemble the diamond; when the chemist has
found that the diamond affords no other substance by its combustion
than pure carbonic-acid gas, and that the only chemical difference
between the costliest diamond and a lump of pure charcoal is a
proportion of hydrogen less than 1/100000 part of the weight of the
substance, can the chemist make you a diamond?</p>

<p>"These, then, the more potent, but also the more perilous of the
casket's contents, shall be explored by no science, submitted to no
test. They are the keys to masked doors in the ramparts of Nature,
which no mortal can pass through without rousing dread sentries
never seen upon this side her wall. The powers they confer are
secrets locked in my breast, to be lost in my grave; as the casket
which lies on my breast shall not be transferred to the hands of
another, till all the rest of my earthly possessions pass away with
my last breath in life and my first in eternity."</p>

<p>"Sir Philip Derval," said I, struggling against the appeals to
fancy or to awe, made in words so strange, uttered in a tone of
earnest conviction, and heard amidst the glare of the lightning,
the howl of the winds, and the roll of the thunder,&mdash;"Sir
Philip Derval, you accost me in a language which, but for my
experience of the powers at your command, I should hear with the
contempt that is due to the vaunts of a mountebank, or the pity we
give to the morbid beliefs of his dupe. As it is, I decline the
confidence with which you would favour me, subject to the
conditions which it seems you would impose. My profession abandons
to quacks all drugs which may not be analyzed, all secrets which
may not be fearlessly told. I cannot visit you at Derval Court. I
cannot trust myself, voluntarily, again in the power of a man, who
has arts of which I may not examine the nature, by which he can
impose on my imagination and steal away my reason."</p>

<p>"Reflect well before you decide," said Sir Philip, with a
solemnity that was stern. "If you refuse to be warned and to be
armed by me, your reason and your imagination will alike be
subjected to influences which I can only explain by telling you
that there is truth in those immemorial legends which depose to the
existence of magic."</p>

<p>"Magic!"</p>

<p>"There is magic of two kinds,&mdash;the dark and evil,
appertaining to witchcraft or necromancy; the pure and beneficent,
which is but philosophy, applied to certain mysteries in Nature
remote from the beaten tracks of science, but which deepened the
wisdom of ancient sages, and can yet unriddle the myths of departed
races."</p>

<p>"Sir Philip," I said, with impatient and angry interruption, "if
you think that a jargon of this kind be worthy a man of your
acquirements and station, it is at least a waste of time to address
it to me. I am led to conclude that you desire to make use of me
for some purpose which I have a right to suppose honest and
blameless, because all you know of me is, that I rendered to your
relation services which can not lower my character in your eyes. If
your object be, as you have intimated, to aid you in exposing and
disabling man whose antecedents have been those of guilt, and who
threatens with danger the society which receives him, you must give
me proofs that are not reducible to magic; and you must prepossess
me against the person you accuse, not by powders and fumes that
disorder the brain, but by substantial statements, such as justify
one man in condemning another. And, since you have thought fit to
convince me that there are chemical means at your disposal, by
which the imagination can be so affected as to accept, temporarily,
illusions for realities, so I again demand, and now still more
decidedly than before, that while you address yourself to my
reason, whether to explain your object or to vindicate your charges
against a man whom I have admitted to my acquaintance, you will
divest yourself of all means and agencies to warp my judgment so
illicit and fraudulent as those which you own yourself to possess.
Let the casket, with all its contents, be transferred to my hands,
and pledge me your word that, in giving that casket, you reserve to
yourself no other means by which chemistry can be abused to those
influences over physical organization, which ignorance or imposture
may ascribe to&mdash;magic."</p>

<p>"I accept no conditions for my confidence, though I think the
better of you for attempting to make them. If I live, you will seek
me yourself, and implore my aid. Meanwhile, listen to me,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No; I prefer the rain and the thunder to the whispers that
steal to my ear in the dark from one of whom I have reason to
beware."</p>

<p>So saying, I stepped forth, and at that moment the lightning
flashed through the arch, and brought into full view the face of
the man beside me. Seen by that glare, it was pale as the face of a
corpse, but its expression was compassionate and serene.</p>

<p>I hesitated, for the expression of that hueless countenance
touched me; it was not the face which inspires distrust or
fear.</p>

<p>"Come," said I, gently; "grant my demand. The casket&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is no scruple of distrust that now makes that demand; it is
a curiosity which in itself is a fearful tempter. Did you now
possess what at this moment you desire, how bitterly you would
repent!"</p>

<p>"Do you still refuse my demand?"</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>"If then you really need me, it is you who will repent."</p>

<p>I passed from the arch into the open space. The rain had passed,
the thunder was more distant. I looked back when I had gained the
opposite side of the way, at the angle of a street which led to my
own house. As I did so, again the skies lightened, but the flash
was comparatively slight and evanescent; it did not penetrate the
gloom of the arch; it did not bring the form of Sir Philip into
view; but, just under the base of the outer buttress to the
gateway, I descried the outline of a dark figure, cowering down,
huddled up for shelter, the outline so indistinct, and so soon lost
to sight as the flash faded, that I could not distinguish if it
were man or brute. If it were some chance passer-by, who had sought
refuge from the rain, and overheard any part of our strange talk,
"the listener," thought I with a half-smile, "must have been
mightily perplexed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<p>On reaching my own home, I found my servant sitting up for me
with the information that my attendance was immediately required.
The little boy whom Margrave's carelessness had so injured, and for
whose injury he had shown so little feeling, had been weakened by
the confinement which the nature of the injury required, and for
the last few days had been generally ailing. The father had come to
my house a few minutes before I reached it, in great distress of
mind, saying that his child had been seized with fever, and had
become delirious. Hearing that I was at the mayor's house, he had
hurried thither in search of me.</p>

<p>I felt as if it were almost a relief to the troubled and
haunting thoughts which tormented me, to be summoned to the
exercise of a familiar knowledge. I hastened to the bedside of the
little sufferer, and soon forgot all else in the anxious struggle
for a human life. The struggle promised to be successful; the worst
symptoms began to yield to remedies prompt and energetic, if
simple. I remained at the house, rather to comfort and support the
parents, than because my continued attendance was absolutely
needed, till the night was well-nigh gone; and all cause of
immediate danger having subsided, I then found myself once more in
the streets. An atmosphere palely clear in the gray of dawn had
succeeded to the thunder-clouds of the stormy night; the
streetlamps, here and there, burned wan and still. I was walking
slowly and wearily, so tired out that I was scarcely conscious of
my own thoughts, when, in a narrow lane, my feet stopped almost
mechanically before a human form stretched at full length in the
centre of the road right in my path. The form was dark in the
shadow thrown from the neighbouring houses. "Some poor drunkard,"
thought I, and the humanity inseparable from my calling not
allowing me to leave a fellow-creature thus exposed to the risk of
being run over by the first drowsy wagoner who might pass along the
thoroughfare, I stooped to rouse and to lift the form. What was my
horror when my eyes met the rigid stare of a dead man's. I started,
looked again; it was the face of Sir Philip Derval! He was lying on
his back, the countenance upturned, a dark stream oozing from the
breast,&mdash;murdered by two ghastly wounds, murdered not long
since, the blood was still warm. Stunned and terror-stricken, I
stood bending over the body. Suddenly I was touched on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hollo! what is this?" said a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"Murder!" I answered in hollow accents, which sounded strangely
to my own ear.</p>

<p>"Murder! so it seems." And the policeman who had thus accosted
me lifted the body.</p>

<p>"A gentleman by his dress. How did this happen? How did you come
here?" and the policeman glanced suspiciously at me.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, there came up another policeman, in
whom I recognized the young man whose sister I had attended and
cured.</p>

<p>"Dr. Fenwick," said the last, lifting his hat respectfully, and
at the sound of my name his fellow-policeman changed his manner and
muttered an apology.</p>

<p>I now collected myself sufficiently to state the name and rank
of the murdered man. The policemen bore the body to their station,
to which I accompanied them. I then returned to my own house, and
had scarcely sunk on my bed when sleep came over me. But what a
sleep! Never till then had I known how awfully distinct dreams can
be. The phantasmagoria of the naturalist's collection revived. Life
again awoke in the serpent and the tiger, the scorpion moved, and
the vulture flapped its wings. And there was Margrave, and there
Sir Philip; but their position of power was reversed, and
Margrave's foot was on the breast of the dead man. Still I slept on
till I was roused by the summons to attend on Mr. Vigors, the
magistrate to whom the police had reported the murder.</p>

<p>I dressed hastily and went forth. As I passed through the
street, I found that the dismal news had already spread. I was
accosted on my way to the magistrate by a hundred eager, tremulous,
inquiring tongues.</p>

<p>The scanty evidence I could impart was soon given.</p>

<p>My introduction to Sir Philip at the mayor's house, our
accidental meeting under the arch, my discovery of the corpse some
hours afterwards on my return from my patient, my professional
belief that the deed must have been done a very short time, perhaps
but a few minutes, before I chanced upon its victim. But, in that
case, how account for the long interval that had elapsed between
the time in which I had left Sir Philip under the arch and the time
in which the murder must have been committed? Sir Philip could not
have been wandering through the streets all those hours. This
doubt, however, was easily and speedily cleared up. A Mr. Jeeves,
who was one of the principal solicitors in the town, stated that he
had acted as Sir Philip's legal agent and adviser ever since Sir
Philip came of age, and was charged with the exclusive management
of some valuable house-property which the deceased had possessed in
L&mdash;&mdash;; that when Sir Philip had arrived in the town late
in the afternoon of the previous day, he had sent for Mr. Jeeves;
informed him that he, Sir Philip, was engaged to be married; that
he wished to have full and minute information as to the details of
his house property (which had greatly increased in value since his
absence from England), in connection with the settlements his
marriage would render necessary; and that this information was also
required by him in respect to a codicil he desired to add to his
will.</p>

<p>He had, accordingly, requested Mr. Jeeves to have all the books
and statements concerning the property ready for his inspection
that night, when he would call, after leaving the ball which he had
promised the mayor, whom he had accidentally met on entering the
town, to attend. Sir Philip had also asked Mr. Jeeves to detain one
of his clerks in his office, in order to serve, conjointly with Mr.
Jeeves, as a witness to the codicil he desired to add to his will.
Sir Philip had accordingly come to Mr. Jeeves's house a little
before midnight; had gone carefully through all the statements
prepared for him, and had executed the fresh codicil to his
testament, which testament he had in their previous interview given
to Mr. Jeeves's care, sealed up. Mr. Jeeves stated that Sir Philip,
though a man of remarkable talents and great acquirements, was
extremely eccentric, and of a very peremptory temper, and that the
importance attached to a promptitude for which there seemed no
pressing occasion did not surprise him in Sir Philip as it might
have done in an ordinary client. Sir Philip said, indeed, that he
should devote the next morning to the draft for his wedding
settlements, according to the information of his property which he
had acquired; and after a visit of very brief duration to Derval
Court, should quit the neighbourhood and return to Paris, where his
intended bride then was, and in which city it had been settled that
the marriage ceremony should take place.</p>

<p>Mr. Jeeves had, however, observed to him, that if he were so
soon to be married, it was better to postpone any revision of
testamentary bequests, since after marriage he would have to make a
new will altogether.</p>

<p>And Sir Philip had simply answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Life is uncertain; who can be sure of the morrow?"</p>

<p>Sir Philip's visit to Mr. Jeeves's house had lasted some hours,
for the conversation between them had branched off from actual
business to various topics. Mr. Jeeves had not noticed the hour
when Sir Philip went; he could only say that as he attended him to
the street-door, he observed, rather to his own surprise, that it
was close upon daybreak.</p>

<p>Sir Philip's body had been found not many yards distant from the
hotel at which he had put up, and to which, therefore, he was
evidently returning when he left Mr. Jeeves,&mdash;an old-fashioned
hotel, which had been the principal one at L&mdash;&mdash; when Sir
Philip left England, though now outrivalled by the new and more
central establishment in which Margrave was domiciled.</p>

<p>The primary and natural supposition was that Sir Philip had been
murdered for the sake of plunder; and this supposition was borne
out by the fact to which his valet deposed, namely,&mdash;</p>

<p>That Sir Philip had about his person, on going to the mayor's
house, a purse containing notes and sovereigns; and this purse was
now missing.</p>

<p>The valet, who, though an Albanian, spoke English fluently, said
that the purse had a gold clasp, on which Sir Philip's crest and
initials were engraved. Sir Philip's watch was, however, not
taken.</p>

<p>And now, it was not without a quick beat of the heart that I
heard the valet declare that a steel casket, to which Sir Philip
attached extraordinary value, and always carried about with him,
was also missing.</p>

<p>The Albanian described this casket as of ancient Byzantine
workmanship, opening with a peculiar spring, only known to Sir
Philip, in whose possession it had been, so far as the servant
knew, about three years: when, after a visit to Aleppo, in which
the servant had not accompanied him, he had first observed it in
his master's hands. He was asked if this casket contained articles
to account for the value Sir Philip set on it,&mdash;such as
jewels, bank-notes, letters of credit, etc. The man replied that it
might possibly do so; he had never been allowed the opportunity of
examining its contents; but that he was certain the casket held
medicines, for he had seen Sir Philip take from it some small
phials, by which he had performed great cures in the East, and
especially during a pestilence which had visited Damascus, just
after Sir Philip had arrived at that city on quitting Aleppo.
Almost every European traveller is supposed to be a physician; and
Sir Philip was a man of great benevolence, and the servant firmly
believed him also to be of great medical skill. After this
statement, it was very naturally and generally conjectured that Sir
Philip was an amateur disciple of homoeopathy, and that the casket
contained the phials or globules in use among homoeopathists.</p>

<p>Whether or not Mr. Vigors enjoyed a vindictive triumph in making
me feel the weight of his authority, or whether his temper was
ruffled in the excitement of so grave a case, I cannot say, but his
manner was stern and his tone discourteous in the questions which
he addressed to me. Nor did the questions themselves seem very
pertinent to the object of investigation.</p>

<p>"Pray, Dr. Fenwick," said he, knitting his brows, and fixing his
eyes on me rudely, "did Sir Philip Derval in his conversation with
you mention the steel casket which it seems he carried about with
him?"</p>

<p>I felt my countenance change slightly as I answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you what it contained?"</p>

<p>"He said it contained secrets."</p>

<p>"Secrets of what nature,&mdash;medicinal or chemical? Secrets
which a physician might be curious to learn and covetous to
possess?"</p>

<p>This question seemed to me so offensively significant that it
roused my indignation, and I answered haughtily, that "a physician
of any degree of merited reputation did not much believe in, and
still less covet, those secrets in his art which were the boast of
quacks and pretenders."</p>

<p>"My question need not offend you, Dr. Fenwick. I put it in
another shape: Did Sir Philip Derval so boast of the secrets
contained in his casket that a quack or pretender might deem such
secrets of use to him?"</p>

<p>"Possibly he might, if he believed in such a boast."</p>

<p>"Humph!&mdash;he might if he so believed. I have no more
questions to put to you at present, Dr. Fenwick."</p>

<p>Little of any importance in connection with the deceased or his
murder transpired in the course of that day's examination and
inquiries.</p>

<p>The next day, a gentleman distantly related to the young lady to
whom Sir Philip was engaged, and who had been for some time in
correspondence with the deceased, arrived at L&mdash;&mdash;. He
had been sent for at the suggestion of the Albanian servant, who
said that Sir Philip had stayed a day at this gentleman's house in
London, on his way to L&mdash;&mdash;, from Dover.</p>

<p>The new comer, whose name was Danvers, gave a more touching
pathos to the horror which the murder had excited. It seemed that
the motives which had swayed Sir Philip in the choice of his
betrothed were singularly pure and noble. The young lady's
father&mdash;an intimate college friend&mdash;had been visited by a
sudden reverse of fortune, which had brought on a fever that proved
mortal. He had died some years ago, leaving his only child
penniless, and had bequeathed her to the care and guardianship of
Sir Philip.</p>

<p>The orphan received her education at a convent near Paris; and
when Sir Philip, a few weeks since, arrived in that city from the
East, he offered her his hand and fortune.</p>

<p>"I know," said Mr. Danvers, "from the conversation I held with
him when he came to me in London, that he was induced to this offer
by the conscientious desire to discharge the trust consigned to him
by his old friend. Sir Philip was still of an age that could not
permit him to take under his own roof a female ward of eighteen,
without injury to her good name. He could only get over that
difficulty by making the ward his wife. 'She will be safer and
happier with the man she will love and honour for her father's
sake,' said the chivalrous gentleman, 'than she will be under any
other roof I could find for her.'"</p>

<p>And now there arrived another stranger to L&mdash;&mdash;, sent
for by Mr. Jeeves, the lawyer,&mdash;a stranger to L&mdash;&mdash;,
but not to me; my old Edinburgh acquaintance, Richard Strahan.</p>

<p>The will in Mr. Jeeves's keeping, with its recent codicil, was
opened and read. The will itself bore date about six years anterior
to the testator's tragic death: it was very short, and, with the
exception of a few legacies, of which the most important was
L10,000 to his ward, the whole of his property was left to Richard
Strahan, on the condition that he took the name and arms of Derval
within a year from the date of Sir Philip's decease. The codicil,
added to the will the night before his death, increased the legacy
to the young lady from L10,000 to L30,000, and bequeathed an
annuity of L100 a year to his Albanian servant. Accompanying the
will, and within the same envelope, was a sealed letter, addressed
to Richard Strahan, and dated at Paris two weeks before Sir
Philip's decease. Strahan brought that letter to me. It ran
thus:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "Richard Strahan, I advise you to pull down the house called Derval
    Court, and to build another on a better site, the plans of which, to
    be modified according to your own taste and requirements, will be
    found among my papers.  This is a recommendation, not a command.  But
    I strictly enjoin you entirely to demolish the more ancient part,
    which was chiefly occupied by myself, and to destroy by fire, without
    perusal, all the books and manuscripts found in the safes in my study.
    I have appointed you my sole executor, as well as my heir, because I
    have no personal friends in whom I can confide as I trust I may do in
    the man I have never seen, simply because he will bear my name and
    represent my lineage.  There will be found in my writing-desk, which
    always accompanies me in my travels, an autobiographical work, a
    record of my own life, comprising discoveries, or hints at discovery,
    in science, through means little cultivated in our age.  You will not
    be surprised that before selecting you as my heir and executor, from a
    crowd of relations not more distant, I should have made inquiries in
    order to justify my selection.  The result of those inquiries informs
    me that you have not yourself the peculiar knowledge nor the habits of
    mind that could enable you to judge of matters which demand the
    attainments and the practice of science; but that you are of an
    honest, affectionate nature, and will regard as sacred the last
    injunctions of a benefactor.  I enjoin you, then, to submit the
    aforesaid manuscript memoir to some man on whose character for
    humanity and honour you can place confidential reliance, and who is
    accustomed to the study of the positive sciences, more especially
    chemistry, in connection with electricity and magnetism.  My desire is
    that he shall edit and arrange this memoir for publication; and that,
    wherever he feels a conscientious doubt whether any discovery, or hint
    of discovery, therein contained would not prove more dangerous than
    useful to mankind, he shall consult with any other three men of
    science whose names are a guarantee for probity and knowledge, and
    according to the best of his judgment, after such consultation,
    suppress or publish the passage of which he has so doubted.  I own the
    ambition which first directed me towards studies of a very unusual
    character, and which has encouraged me in their pursuit through many
    years of voluntary exile, in lands where they could be best
    facilitated or aided,&mdash;the ambition of leaving behind me the renown of
    a bold discoverer in those recesses of nature which philosophy has
    hitherto abandoned to superstition.  But I feel, at the moment in
    which I trace these lines, a fear lest, in the absorbing interest of
    researches which tend to increase to a marvellous degree the power of
    man over all matter, animate or inanimate, I may have blunted my own
    moral perceptions; and that there may be much in the knowledge which I
    sought and acquired from the pure desire of investigating hidden
    truths, that could be more abused to purposes of tremendous evil than
    be likely to conduce to benignant good.  And of this a mind
    disciplined to severe reasoning, and uninfluenced by the enthusiasm
    which has probably obscured my own judgment, should be the
    unprejudiced arbiter.  Much as I have coveted and still do covet
    that fame which makes the memory of one man the common inheritance of
    all, I would infinitely rather that my name should pass away with my
    breath, than that I should transmit to my fellowmen any portion of
    a knowledge which the good might forbear to exercise and the bad might
    unscrupulously pervert.  I bear about with me, wherever I wander, a
    certain steel casket.  I received this casket, with its contents, from
    a man whose memory I hold in profound veneration.  Should I live to
    find a person whom, after minute and intimate trial of his character,
    I should deem worthy of such confidence, it is my intention to
    communicate to him the secret how to prepare and how to use such of
    the powders and essences stored within that casket as I myself have
    ventured to employ.  Others I have never tested, nor do I know how
    they could be resupplied if lost or wasted.  But as the contents of
    this casket, in the hands of any one not duly instructed as to the
    mode of applying them, would either be useless, or conduce, through
    inadvertent and ignorant misapplication, to the most dangerous
    consequences; so, if I die without having found, and in writing named,
    such a confidant as I have described above, I command you immediately
    to empty all the powders and essences found therein into any running
    stream of water, which will at once harmlessly dissolve them.  On
    no account must they be cast into fire!

   "This letter, Richard Strahan, will only come under your eyes in case
    the plans and the hopes which I have formed for my earthly future
    should be frustrated by the death on which I do not calculate, but
    against the chances of which this will and this letter provide.  I am
    about to revisit England, in defiance of a warning that I shall be
    there subjected to some peril which I refused to have defined, because
    I am unwilling that any mean apprehension of personal danger should
    enfeeble my nerves in the discharge of a stern and solemn duty.  If I
    overcome that peril, you will not be my heir; my testament will be
    remodelled; this letter will be recalled and destroyed.  I shall form
    ties which promise me the happiness I have never hitherto found,
    though it is common to all men,&mdash;the affections of home, the caresses
    of children, among whom I may find one to whom hereafter I may
    bequeath, in my knowledge, a far nobler heritage than my lands.  In
    that case, however, my first care would be to assure your own
    fortunes.  And the sum which this codicil assures to my betrothed
    would be transferred to yourself on my wedding-day.  Do you know why,
    never having seen you, I thus select you for preference to all my
    other kindred; why my heart, in writing thus, warms to your image?
    Richard Strahan, your only sister, many years older than yourself&mdash;you
    were then a child&mdash;was the object of my first love.  We were to have
    been wedded, for her parents deceived me into the belief that she
    returned my affection.  With a rare and nobler candour, she herself
    informed me that her heart was given to another, who possessed not my
    worldly gifts of wealth and station.  In resigning my claims to her
    hand, I succeeded in propitiating her parents to her own choice.  I
    obtained for her husband the living which he held, and I settled on
    your sister the dower which, at her death, passed to you as the
    brother to whom she had shown a mother's love, and the interest of
    which has secured you a modest independence.

   "If these lines ever reach you, recognize my title to reverential
    obedience to commands which may seem to you wild, perhaps irrational;
    and repay, as if a debt due from your own lost sister, the affection
    I have borne to you for her sake."

</pre>

<p>While I read this long and strange letter, Strahan sat by my
side, covering his face with his hands, and weeping with honest
tears for the man whose death had made him powerful and rich.</p>

<p>"You will undertake the trust ordained to me in this letter,"
said he, struggling to compose himself. "You will read and edit
this memoir; you are the very man he himself would have selected.
Of your honour and humanity there can be no doubt, and you have
studied with success the sciences which he specifies as requisite
for the discharge of the task he commands."</p>

<p>At this request, though I could not be wholly unprepared for it,
my first impulse was that of a vague terror. It seemed to me as if
I were becoming more and more entangled in a mysterious and fatal
web. But this impulse soon faded in the eager yearnings of an
ardent and irresistible curiosity.</p>

<p>I promised to read the manuscript, and in order that I might
fully imbue my mind with the object and wish of the deceased, I
asked leave to make a copy of the letter I had just read. To this
Strahan readily assented, and that copy I have transcribed in the
preceding pages.</p>

<p>I asked Strahan if he had yet found the manuscript. He said,
"No, he had not yet had the heart to inspect the papers left by the
deceased. He would now do so. He should go in a day or two to
Derval Court, and reside there till the murderer was discovered, as
doubtless he soon must be through the vigilance of the police. Not
till that discovery was made should Sir Philip's remains, though
already placed in their coffin, be consigned to the family
vault."</p>

<p>Strahan seemed to have some superstitious notion that the
murderer might be more secure from justice if his victim were
thrust unavenged into the tomb.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<p>The belief prevalent in the town ascribed the murder of Sir
Philip to the violence of some vulgar robber, probably not an
inhabitant of L&mdash;&mdash;. Mr. Vigors did not favour that
belief. He intimated an opinion, which seemed extravagant and
groundless, that Sir Philip had been murdered, for the sake not of
the missing purse, but of the missing casket. It was currently
believed that the solemn magistrate had consulted one of his
pretended clairvoyants, and that this impostor had gulled him with
assurances, to which he attached a credit that perverted into
egregiously absurd directions his characteristic activity and
zeal.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the coroner's inquest closed without casting
any light on so mysterious a tragedy.</p>

<p>What were my own conjectures I scarcely dared to admit,&mdash;I
certainly could not venture to utter them; but my suspicions
centred upon Margrave. That for some reason or other he had cause
to dread Sir Philip's presence in L&mdash;&mdash; was clear, even
to my reason. And how could my reason reject all the influences
which had been brought to bear on my imagination, whether by the
scene in the museum or my conversation with the deceased? But it
was impossible to act on such suspicions,&mdash;impossible even to
confide them. Could I have told to any man the effect produced on
me in the museum, he would have considered me a liar or a madman.
And in Sir Philip's accusations against Margrave, there was nothing
tangible,&mdash;nothing that could bear repetition. Those
accusations, if analyzed, vanished into air. What did they
imply?&mdash;that Margrave was a magician, a monstrous prodigy, a
creature exceptional to the ordinary conditions of humanity. Would
the most reckless of mortals have ventured to bring against the
worst of characters such a charge, on the authority of a deceased
witness, and to found on evidence so fantastic the awful accusation
of murder? But of all men, certainly I&mdash;a sober, practical
physician&mdash;was the last whom the public could excuse for such
incredible implications; and certainly, of all men, the last
against whom any suspicion of heinous crime would be readily
entertained was that joyous youth in whose sunny aspect life and
conscience alike seemed to keep careless holiday. But I could not
overcome, nor did I attempt to reason against, the horror akin to
detestation, that had succeeded to the fascinating attraction by
which Margrave had before conciliated a liking founded rather on
admiration than esteem.</p>

<p>In order to avoid his visits I kept away from the study in which
I had habitually spent my mornings, and to which he had been
accustomed to so ready an access; and if he called at the front
door, I directed my servant to tell him that I was either from home
or engaged. He did attempt for the first few days to visit me as
before, but when my intention to shun him became thus manifest,
desisted naturally enough, as any other man so pointedly repelled
would have done.</p>

<p>I abstained from all those houses in which I was likely to meet
him, and went my professional round of visits in a close carriage,
so that I might not be accosted by him in his walks.</p>

<p>One morning, a very few days after Strahan had shown me Sir
Philip Derval's letter, I received a note from my old college
acquaintance, stating that he was going to Derval Court that
afternoon; that he should take with him the memoir which he had
found, and begging me to visit him at his new home the next day,
and commence my inspection of the manuscript. I consented
eagerly.</p>

<p>That morning, on going my round, my carriage passed by another
drawn up to the pavement, and I recognized the figure of Margrave
standing beside the vehicle, and talking to some one seated within
it. I looked back, as my own carriage whirled rapidly by, and saw
with uneasiness and alarm that it was Richard Strahan to whom
Margrave was thus familiarly addressing himself. How had the two
made acquaintance?</p>

<p>Was it not an outrage on Sir Philip Derval's memory, that the
heir he had selected should be thus apparently intimate with the
man whom he had so sternly denounced? I became still more impatient
to read the memoir: in all probability it would give such
explanations with respect to Margrave's antecedents, as, if not
sufficing to criminate him of legal offences, would at least
effectually terminate any acquaintance between Sir Philip's
successor and himself.</p>

<p>All my thoughts were, however, diverted to channels of far
deeper interest even than those in which my mind had of late been
so tumultuously whirled along, when, on returning home, I found a
note from Mrs. Ashleigh. She and Lilian had just come back to
L&mdash;&mdash;, sooner than she had led me to anticipate. Lilian
had not seemed quite well the last day or two, and had been anxious
to return.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>

<p>Let me recall it&mdash;softly,&mdash;softly! Let me recall that
evening spent with her!&mdash;that evening, the last before
darkness rose between us like a solid wall.</p>

<p>It was evening, at the close of summer. The sun had set, the
twilight was lingering still. We were in the old monastic
garden,&mdash;garden so quiet, so cool, so fragrant. She was seated
on a bench under the one great cedar-tree that rose sombre in the
midst of the grassy lawn with its little paradise of flowers. I had
thrown myself on the sward at her feet; her hand so confidingly lay
in the clasp of mine. I see her still,&mdash;how young, how fair,
how innocent!</p>

<p>Strange, strange! So inexpressibly English; so thoroughly the
creature of our sober, homely life! The pretty delicate white robe
that I touch so timorously, and the ribbon-knots of blue that so
well become the soft colour of the fair cheek, the wavy silk of the
brown hair! She is murmuring low her answer to my trembling
question.</p>

<p>"As well as when last we parted? Do you love me as well
still?"</p>

<p>"There is no 'still' written here," said she, softly pressing
her hand to her heart. "Yesterday is as to-morrow in the
Forever."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lilian! if I could reply to you in words as akin to poetry
as your own!"</p>

<p>"Fie! you who affect not to care for poetry!"</p>

<p>"That was before you went away; before I missed you from my
eyes, from my life; before I was quite conscious how precious you
were to me, more precious than common words can tell! Yes, there is
one period in love when all men are poets, however the penury of
their language may belie the luxuriance of their fancies. What
would become of me if you ceased to love me?"</p>

<p>"Or of me, if you could cease to love?"</p>

<p>"And somehow it seems to me this evening as if my heart drew
nearer to you,&mdash;nearer as if for shelter."</p>

<p>"It is sympathy," said she, with tremulous
eagerness,&mdash;"that sort of mysterious sympathy which I have
often heard you deny or deride; for I, too, feel drawn nearer to
you, as if there were a storm at hand. I was oppressed by an
indescribable terror in returning home, and the moment I saw you
there came a sense of protection."</p>

<p>Her head sank on my shoulder: we were silent some moments; then
we both rose by the same involuntary impulse, and round her slight
form I twined my strong arm of man. And now we are winding slow
under the lilacs and acacias that belt the lawn. Lilian has not yet
heard of the murder, which forms the one topic of the town, for all
tales of violence and blood affected her as they affect a fearful
child. Mrs. Ashleigh, therefore, had judiciously concealed from her
the letters and the journals by which the dismal news had been
carried to herself. I need scarcely say that the grim subject was
not broached by me. In fact, my own mind escaped from the events
which had of late so perplexed and tormented it; the tranquillity
of the scene, the bliss of Lilian's presence, had begun to chase
away even that melancholy foreboding which had overshadowed me in
the first moments of our reunion. So we came gradually to converse
of the future,&mdash;of the day, not far distant, when we two
should be as one. We planned our bridal excursion. We would visit
the scenes endeared to her by song, to me by childhood,&mdash;the
banks and waves of my native Windermere,&mdash;our one brief
holiday before life returned to labour, and hearts now so
disquieted by hope and joy settled down to the calm serenity of
home.</p>

<p>As we thus talked, the moon, nearly rounded to her full, rose
amidst skies without a cloud. We paused to gaze on her solemn
haunting beauty, as where are the lovers who have not paused to
gaze? We were then on the terrace walk, which commanded a view of
the town below. Before us was a parapet wall, low on the garden
side, but inaccessible on the outer side, forming part of a
straggling irregular street that made one of the boundaries
dividing Abbey Hill from Low Town. The lamps of the thoroughfares,
in many a line and row beneath us, stretched far away, obscured,
here and there, by intervening roofs and tall church towers. The
hum of the city came to our ears, low and mellowed into a lulling
sound. It was not displeasing to be reminded that there was a world
without, as close and closer we drew each to each,&mdash;worlds to
one another! Suddenly there carolled forth the song of a human
voice,&mdash;a wild, irregular, half-savage melody, foreign,
uncomprehended words,&mdash;air and words not new to me. I
recognized the voice and chant of Margrave. I started, and uttered
an angry exclamation.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Lilian, and I felt her frame shiver within my
encircling arm. "Hush! listen! Yes; I have heard that voice
before&mdash;last night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Last night! you were not here; you were more than a hundred
miles away."</p>

<p>"I heard it in a dream! Hush, hush!"</p>

<p>The song rose louder; impossible to describe its effect, in the
midst of the tranquil night, chiming over the serried rooftops, and
under the solitary moon. It was not like the artful song of man,
for it was defective in the methodical harmony of tune; it was not
like the song of the wild-bird, for it had no monotony in its
sweetness: it was wandering and various as the sounds from an
AEolian harp. But it affected the senses to a powerful degree, as
in remote lands and in vast solitudes I have since found the note
of the mocking-bird, suddenly heard, affects the listener half with
delight, half with awe, as if some demon creature of the desert
were mimicking man for its own merriment. The chant now had changed
into an air of defying glee, of menacing exultation; it might have
been the triumphant war-song of some antique barbarian race. The
note was sinister; a shadow passed through me, and Lilian had
closed her eyes, and was sighing heavily; then with a rapid change,
sweet as the coo with which an Arab mother lulls her babe to sleep,
the melody died away. "There, there, look," murmured Lilian, moving
from me, "the same I saw last night in sleep; the same I saw in the
space above, on the evening I first knew you!"</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed, her hand raised; my look followed hers, and
rested on the face and form of Margrave. The moon shone full upon
him, so full as if concentrating all its light upon his image. The
place on which he stood (a balcony to the upper story of a house
about fifty yards distant) was considerably above the level of the
terrace from which we gazed on him. His arms were folded on his
breast, and he appeared to be looking straight towards us. Even at
that distance, the lustrous youth of his countenance appeared to me
terribly distinct, and the light of his wondrous eye seemed to rest
upon us in one lengthened, steady ray through the limpid moonshine.
Involuntarily I seized Lilian's hand, and drew her away almost by
force, for she was unwilling to move, and as I led her back, she
turned her head to look round; I, too, turned in jealous rage! I
breathed more freely. Margrave had disappeared!</p>

<p>"How came he there? It is not his hotel. Whose house is it?" I
said aloud, though speaking to myself.</p>

<p>Lilian remained silent, her eyes fixed upon the ground as if in
deep revery. I took her hand; it did not return my pressure. I felt
cut to the heart when she drew coldly from me that hand, till then
so frankly cordial. I stopped short: "Lilian, what is this? you are
chilled towards me. Can the mere sound of that man's voice, the
mere glimpse of that man's face, have&mdash;" I paused; I did not
dare to complete my question.</p>

<p>Lilian lifted her eyes to mine, and I saw at once in those eyes
a change. Their look was cold; not haughty, but abstracted. "I do
not understand you," she said, in a weary, listless accent. "It is
growing late; I must go in."</p>

<p>So we walked on moodily, no longer arm in arm, nor hand in hand.
Then it occurred to me that, the next day, Lilian would be in that
narrow world of society; that there she could scarcely fail to hear
of Margrave, to meet, to know him. Jealousy seized me with all its
imaginary terrors, and amidst that jealousy, a nobler, purer
apprehension for herself. Had I been Lilian's brother instead of
her betrothed, I should not have trembled less to foresee the
shadow of Margrave's mysterious influence passing over a mind so
predisposed to the charm which Mystery itself has for those whose
thoughts fuse their outlines in fancies, whose world melts away
into Dreamland. Therefore I spoke.</p>

<p>"Lilian, at the risk of offending you-alas! I have never done so
before this night&mdash;I must address to you a prayer which I
implore you not to regard as the dictate of a suspicion unworthy
you and myself. The person whom you have just heard and seen is, at
present, much courted in the circles of this town. I entreat you
not to permit any one to introduce him to you. I entreat you not to
know him. I cannot tell you all my reasons for this petition;
enough that I pledge you my honour that those reasons are grave.
Trust, then, in my truth, as I trust in yours. Be assured that I
stretch not the rights which your heart has bestowed upon mine in
the promise I ask, as I shall be freed from all fear by a promise
which I know will be sacred when once it is given."</p>

<p>"What promise?" asked Lilian, absently, as if she had not heard
my words.</p>

<p>"What promise? Why, to refuse all acquaintance with that man;
his name is Margrave. Promise me, dearest, promise me."</p>

<p>"Why is your voice so changed?" said Lilian. "Its tone jars on
my ear," she added, with a peevishness so unlike her, that it
startled me more than it offended; and without a word further, she
quickened her pace, and entered the house.</p>

<p>For the rest of the evening we were both taciturn and distant
towards each other. In vain Mrs. Ashleigh kindly sought to break
down our mutual reserve. I felt that I had the right to be
resentful, and I clung to that right the more because Lilian made
no attempt at reconciliation. This, too, was wholly unlike herself,
for her temper was ordinarily sweet,&mdash;sweet to the extreme of
meekness; saddened if the slightest misunderstanding between us had
ever vexed me, and yearning to ask forgiveness if a look or a word
had pained me. I was in hopes that, before I went away, peace
between us would be restored. But long ere her usual hour for
retiring to rest, she rose abruptly, and, complaining of fatigue
and headache, wished me "good-night," and avoided the hand I
sorrowfully held out to her as I opened the door.</p>

<p>"You must have been very unkind to poor Lilian," said Mrs.
Ashleigh, between jest and earnest, "for I never saw her so cross
to you before. And the first day of her return, too!"</p>

<p>"The fault is not mine," said I, somewhat sullenly; "I did but
ask Lilian, and that as a humble prayer, not to make the
acquaintance of a stranger in this town against whom I have reasons
for distrust and aversion. I know not why that prayer should
displease her."</p>

<p>"Nor I. Who is the stranger?"</p>

<p>"A person who calls himself Margrave. Let me at least entreat
you to avoid him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no desire to make acquaintance with strangers. But,
now Lilian is gone, do tell me all about this dreadful murder. The
servants are full of it, and I cannot keep it long concealed from
Lilian. I was in hopes that you would have broken it to her."</p>

<p>I rose impatiently; I could not bear to talk thus of an event
the tragedy of which was associated in my mind with circumstances
so mysterious. I became agitated and even angry when Mrs. Ashleigh
persisted in rambling woman-like inquiries,&mdash;"Who was
suspected of the deed? Who did I think had committed it? What sort
of a man was Sir Philip? What was that strange story about a
casket?" Breaking from such interrogations, to which I could give
but abrupt and evasive answers, I seized my hat and took my
departure.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>

<h3>Letter from Allen Fenwick to Lilian Ashleigh.</h3>

<pre>
   "I have promised to go to Derval Court to-day, and shall not return
    till to-morrow.  I cannot bear the thought that so many hours should
    pass away with one feeling less kind than usual resting like a cloud
    upon you and me.  Lilian, if I offended you, forgive me!  Send me one
    line to say so!&mdash;one line which I can place next to my heart and
    cover with grateful kisses till we meet again!"

</pre>

<p>Reply.</p>

<pre>
   "I scarcely know what you mean, nor do I quite understand my own state
    of mind at this moment.  It cannot be that I love you less&mdash;and
    yet&mdash;but I will not write more now.  I feel glad that we shall not
    meet for the next day or so, and then I hope to be quite recovered.  I
    am not well at this moment.  Do not ask me to forgive you; but if it
    is I who am in fault, forgive me, oh, forgive me, Allen!"

</pre>

<p>And with this unsatisfactory note, not worn next to my heart,
not covered with kisses, but thrust crumpled into my desk like a
creditor's unwelcome bill, I flung myself on my horse and rode to
Derval Court. I am naturally proud; my pride came now to my aid. I
felt bitterly indignant against Lilian, so indignant that I
resolved on my return to say to her, "If in those words, 'And yet,'
you implied a doubt whether you loved me less, I cancel your vows,
I give you back your freedom." And I could have passed from her
threshold with a firm foot, though with the certainty that I should
never smile again.</p>

<p>Does her note seem to you who may read these pages to justify
such resentment? Perhaps not. But there is an atmosphere in the
letters of the one we love which we alone&mdash;we who
love&mdash;can feel, and in the atmosphere of that letter I felt
the chill of the coming winter.</p>

<p>I reached the park lodge of Derval Court late in the day. I had
occasion to visit some patients whose houses lay scattered many
miles apart, and for that reason, as well as from the desire for
some quick bodily exercise which is so natural an effect of
irritable perturbation of mind, I had made the journey on horseback
instead of using a carriage that I could not have got through the
lanes and field-paths by which alone the work set to myself could
be accomplished in time.</p>

<p>Just as I entered the park, an uneasy thought seized hold of me
with the strength which is ascribed to presentiments. I had passed
through my study (which has been so elaborately described) to my
stables, as I generally did when I wanted my saddle-horse, and, in
so doing, had doubtless left open the gate to the iron palisade,
and probably the window of the study itself. I had been in this
careless habit for several years, without ever once having cause
for self-reproach. As I before said, there was nothing in my study
to tempt a thief; the study was shut out from the body of the
house, and the servant sure at nightfall both to close the window
and lock the gate; yet now, for the first time, I felt an impulse,
urgent, keen, and disquieting, to ride back to the town, and see
those precautions taken. I could not guess why, but something
whispered to me that my neglect had exposed me to some great
danger. I even checked my horse and looked at my watch; too
late!&mdash;already just on the stroke of Strahan's dinner-hour as
fixed in his note; my horse, too, was fatigued and spent: besides,
what folly! what bearded man can believe in the warnings of a
"presentiment"? I pushed on, and soon halted before the
old-fashioned flight of stairs that led up to the Hall. Here I was
accosted by the old steward; he had just descended the stairs, and
as I dismounted he thrust his arm into mine unceremoniously, and
drew me a little aside.</p>

<p>"Doctor, I was right; it was his ghost that I saw by the iron
door of the mausoleum. I saw it again at the same place last night,
but I had no fit then. Justice on his murderer! Blood for
blood!"</p>

<p>"Ay!" said I, sternly; for if I suspected Margrave before, I
felt convinced now that the inexpiable deed was his. Wherefore
convinced? Simply because I now hated him more, and hate is so
easily convinced! "Lilian! Lilian!" I murmured to myself that name;
the flame of my hate was fed by my jealousy. "Ay!" said I, sternly,
"murder will out."</p>

<p>"What are the police about?" said the old man, querulously;
"days pass on days, and no nearer the truth. But what does the new
owner care? He has the rents and acres; what does he care for the
dead? I will never serve another master. I have just told Mr.
Strahan so. How do I know whether he did not do the deed? Who else
had an interest in it?"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" I cried; "you do not know how wildly you are
talking."</p>

<p>The old man stared at me, shook his head, released my arm, and
strode away.</p>

<p>A labouring man came out of the garden, and having unbuckled the
saddle-bags, which contained the few things required for so short a
visit, I consigned my horse to his care, and ascended the perron.
The old housekeeper met me in the hall, and conducted me up the
great staircase, showed me into a bedroom prepared for me, and told
me that Mr. Strahan was already waiting dinner for me. I should
find him in the study. I hastened to join him. He began
apologizing, very unnecessarily, for the state of his
establishment. He had as yet engaged no new servants. The
housekeeper with the help of a housemaid did all the work.</p>

<p>Richard Strahan at college had been as little distinguishable
from other young men as a youth neither rich nor poor, neither
clever nor stupid, neither handsome nor ugly, neither audacious
sinner nor formal saint, possibly could be.</p>

<p>Yet, to those who understood him well, he was not without some
of those moral qualities by which a youth of mediocre intellect
often matures into a superior man.</p>

<p>He was, as Sir Philip had been rightly informed, thoroughly
honest and upright. But with a strong sense of duty, there was also
a certain latent hardness. He was not indulgent. He had outward
frankness with acquaintances, but was easily roused to suspicion.
He had much of the thriftiness and self-denial of the North
countryman, and I have no doubt that he had lived with calm content
and systematic economy on an income which made him, as a bachelor,
independent of his nominal profession, but would not have sufficed,
in itself, for the fitting maintenance of a wife and family. He
was, therefore, still single.</p>

<p>It seems to me even during the few minutes in which we conversed
before dinner was announced, that his character showed a new phase
with his new fortunes. He talked in a grandiose style of the duties
of station and the woes of wealth. He seemed to be very much afraid
of spending, and still more appalled at the idea of being cheated.
His temper, too, was ruffled; the steward had given him notice to
quit. Mr. Jeeves, who had spent the morning with him, had said the
steward would be a great loss, and a steward at once sharp and
honest was not to be easily found.</p>

<p>What trifles can embitter the possession of great goods! Strahan
had taken a fancy to the old house; it was conformable to his
notions, both of comfort and pomp, and Sir Philip had expressed a
desire that the old house should be pulled down. Strahan had
inspected the plans for the new mansion to which Sir Philip had
referred, and the plans did not please him; on the contrary, they
terrified.</p>

<p>"Jeeves says that I could not build such a house under L70,000
or L80,000, and then it will require twice the establishment which
will suffice for this. I shall be ruined," cried the man who had
just come into possession of at least ten thousand a year.</p>

<p>"Sir Philip did not enjoin you to pull down the old house; he
only advised you to do so. Perhaps he thought the site less healthy
than that which he proposes for a new building, or was aware of
some other drawback to the house, which you may discover later.
Wait a little and see before deciding."</p>

<p>"But, at all events, I suppose I must pull down this curious old
room,&mdash;the nicest part of the old house!"</p>

<p>Strahan, as he spoke, looked wistfully round at the quaint oak
chimneypiece; the carved ceiling; the well-built solid walls, with
the large mullion casement, opening so pleasantly on the
sequestered gardens. He had ensconced himself in Sir Philip's
study, the chamber in which the once famous mystic, Forman, had
found a refuge.</p>

<p>"So cozey a room for a single man!" sighed Strahan. "Near the
stables and dog-kennels, too! But I suppose I must pull it down. I
am not bound to do so legally; it is no condition of the will. But
in honour and gratitude I ought not to disobey poor Sir Philip's
positive injunction."</p>

<p>"Of that," said I, gravely, "there cannot be a doubt." Here our
conversation was interrupted by Mrs. Gates, who informed us that
dinner was served in the library. Wine of great age was brought
from the long neglected cellars; Strahan filled and re-filled his
glass, and, warmed into hilarity, began to talk of bringing old
college friends around him in the winter season, and making the
roof-tree ring with laughter and song once more.</p>

<p>Time wore away, and night had long set in, when Strahan at last
rose from the table, his speech thick and his tongue unsteady. We
returned to the study, and I reminded my host of the special object
of my visit to him,&mdash;namely, the inspection of Sir Philip's
manuscript.</p>

<p>"It is tough reading," said Strahan; "better put it off till
tomorrow. You will stay here two or three days."</p>

<p>"No; I must return to L&mdash;&mdash; to-morrow. I cannot absent
myself from my patients. And it is the more desirable that no time
should be lost before examining the contents of the manuscript,
because probably they may give some clew to the detection of the
murderer."</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?" cried Strahan, startled from the
drowsiness that was creeping over him.</p>

<p>"Because the manuscript may show that Sir Philip had some enemy,
and who but an enemy could have had a motive for such a crime?
Come, bring forth the book. You of all men are bound to be alert in
every research that may guide the retribution of justice to the
assassin of your benefactor."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I will offer a reward of L5,000 for the discovery.
Allen, that wretched old steward had the insolence to tell me that
I was the only man in the world who could have an interest in the
death of his master; and he looked at me as if he thought that I
had committed the crime. You are right; it becomes me, of all men,
to be alert. The assassin must be found. He must hang."</p>

<p>While thus speaking, Strahan had risen, unlocked a desk, which
stood on one of the safes, and drawn forth a thick volume, the
contents of which were protected by a clasp and lock. Strahan
proceeded to open this lock by one of a bunch of keys, which he
said had been found on Sir Philip's person.</p>

<p>"There, Allen, this is the memoir. I need not tell you what
store I place on it,&mdash;not, between you and me, that I expect
it will warrant poor Sir Philip's high opinion of his own
scientific discoveries; that part of his letter seems to me very
queer, and very flighty. But he evidently set his heart on the
publication of his work, in part if not in whole; and, naturally, I
must desire to comply with a wish so distinctly intimated by one to
whom I owe so much. I beg you, therefore, not to be too fastidious.
Some valuable hints in medicine, I have reason to believe, the
manuscript will contain, and those may help you in your profession,
Allen."</p>

<p>"You have reason to believe! Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a charming young fellow, who, with most of the other gentry
resident at L&mdash;&mdash;, called on me at my hotel, told me that
he had travelled in the East, and had there heard much of Sir
Philip's knowledge of chemistry, and the cures it had enabled him
to perform."</p>

<p>"You speak of Mr. Margrave. He called on you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You did not, I trust, mention to him the existence of Sir
Philip's manuscript."</p>

<p>"Indeed I did; and I said you had promised to examine it. He
seemed delighted at that, and spoke most highly of your peculiar
fitness for the task."</p>

<p>"Give me the manuscript," said I, abruptly, "and after I have
looked at it to-night, I may have something to say to you tomorrow
in reference to Mr. Margrave."</p>

<p>"There is the book," said Strahan; "I have just glanced at it,
and find much of it written in Latin; and I am ashamed to say that
I have so neglected the little Latin I learned in our college days
that I could not construe what I looked at."</p>

<p>I sat down and placed the book before me; Strahan fell into a
doze, from which he was wakened by the housekeeper, who brought in
the tea-things.</p>

<p>"Well," said Strahan, languidly, "do you find much in the book
that explains the many puzzling riddles in poor Sir Philip's
eccentric life and pursuits?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I. "Do not interrupt me."</p>

<p>Strahan again began to doze, and the housekeeper asked if we
should want anything more that night, and if I thought I could find
my way to my bedroom.</p>

<p>I dismissed her impatiently, and continued to read. Strahan woke
up again as the clock struck eleven, and finding me still absorbed
in the manuscript, and disinclined to converse, lighted his candle,
and telling me to replace the manuscript in the desk when I had
done with it, and be sure to lock the desk and take charge of the
key, which he took off the bunch and gave me, went upstairs,
yawning.</p>

<p>I was alone in the wizard Forman's chamber, and bending over a
stranger record than had ever excited my infant wonder, or, in
later years, provoked my sceptic smile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>

<p>The Manuscript was written in a small and peculiar handwriting,
which, though evidently by the same person whose letter to Strahan
I had read, was, whether from haste or some imperfection in the
ink, much more hard to decipher. Those parts of the Memoir which
related to experiments, or alleged secrets in Nature, that the
writer intimated a desire to submit exclusively to scholars or men
of science, were in Latin,&mdash;and Latin which, though
grammatically correct, was frequently obscure. But all that
detained the eye and attention on the page necessarily served to
impress the contents more deeply on remembrance.</p>

<p>The narrative commenced with the writer's sketch of his
childhood. Both his parents had died before he attained his seventh
year. The orphan had been sent by his guardians to a private
school, and his holidays had been passed at Derval Court. Here his
earliest reminiscences were those of the quaint old room, in which
I now sat, and of his childish wonder at the inscription on the
chimneypiece&mdash;who and what was the Simon Forman who had there
found a refuge from persecution? Of what nature were the studies he
had cultivated, and the discoveries he boasted to have made?</p>

<p>When he was about sixteen, Philip Derval had begun to read the
many mystic books which the library contained; but without other
result on his mind than the sentiment of disappointment and
disgust. The impressions produced on the credulous imagination of
childhood vanished. He went to the University; was sent abroad to
travel: and on his return took that place in the circles of London
which is so readily conceded to a young idler of birth and fortune.
He passed quickly over that period of his life, as one of
extravagance and dissipation, from which he was first drawn by the
attachment for his cousin to which his letter to Strahan referred.
Disappointed in the hopes which that affection had conceived, and
his fortune impaired, partly by some years of reckless profusion,
and partly by the pecuniary sacrifices at which he had effected his
cousin's marriage with another, he retired to Derval Court, to live
there in solitude and seclusion. On searching for some old
title-deeds required for a mortgage, he chanced upon a collection
of manuscripts much discoloured, and, in part, eaten away by moth
or damp. These, on examination, proved to be the writings of
Forman. Some of them were astrological observations and
predictions; some were upon the nature of the Cabbala; some upon
the invocation of spirits and the magic of the dark ages. All had a
certain interest, for they were interspersed with personal remarks,
anecdotes of eminent actors in a very stirring time, and were
composed as Colloquies, in imitation of Erasmus,&mdash;the second
person in the dialogue being Sir Miles Derval, the patron and
pupil; the first person being Forman, the philosopher and
expounder.</p>

<p>But along with these shadowy lucubrations were treatises of a
more uncommon and a more startling character,&mdash;discussions on
various occult laws of nature, and detailed accounts of analytical
experiments. These opened a new, and what seemed to Sir Philip a
practical, field of inquiry,&mdash;a true border-land between
natural science and imaginative speculation. Sir Philip had
cultivated philosophical science at the University; he resumed the
study, and tested himself the truth of various experiments
suggested by Forman. Some, to his surprise, proved successful, some
wholly failed. These lucubrations first tempted the writer of the
memoir towards the studies in which the remainder of his life had
been consumed. But he spoke of the lucubrations themselves as
valuable only where suggestive of some truths which Forman had
accidentally approached, without being aware of their true nature
and importance. They were debased by absurd puerilities, and
vitiated by the vain and presumptuous ignorance which characterized
the astrology of the middle ages. For these reasons the writer
intimated his intention (if he lived to return to England) to
destroy Forman's manuscripts, together with sundry other books, and
a few commentaries of his own upon studies which had for a while
misled him,&mdash;all now deposited in the safes of the room in
which I sat.</p>

<p>After some years passed in the retirement of Derval Court, Sir
Philip was seized with the desire to travel, and the taste he had
imbibed for occult studies led him towards those Eastern lands in
which they took their origin, and still retain their
professors.</p>

<p>Several pages of the manuscript were now occupied with minute
statements of the writer's earlier disappointment in the objects of
his singular research. The so-called magicians, accessible to the
curiosity of European travellers, were either but ingenious
jugglers, or produced effects that perplexed him by practices they
had mechanically learned, but of the rationale of which they were
as ignorant as himself. It was not till he had resided some
considerable time in the East, and acquired a familiar knowledge of
its current languages and the social habits of its various
populations, that he became acquainted with men in whom he
recognized earnest cultivators of the lore which tradition ascribes
to the colleges and priesthoods of the ancient world,&mdash;men
generally living remote from others, and seldom to be bribed by
money to exhibit their marvels or divulge their secrets. In his
intercourse with these sages, Sir Philip arrived at the conviction
that there does exist an art of magic, distinct from the guile of
the conjuror, and applying to certain latent powers and affinities
in nature,&mdash;a philosophy akin to that which we receive in our
acknowledged schools, inasmuch as it is equally based on
experiment, and produces from definite causes definite results. In
support of this startling proposition, Sir Philip now devoted more
than half his volume to the details of various experiments, to the
process and result of which he pledged his guarantee as the actual
operator. As most of these alleged experiments appeared to me
wholly incredible, and as all of them were unfamiliar to my
practical experience, and could only be verified or falsified by
tests that would require no inconsiderable amount of time and care,
I passed with little heed over the pages in which they were set
forth. I was impatient to arrive at that part of the manuscript
which might throw light on the mystery in which my interest was the
keenest. What were the links which connected the existence of
Margrave with the history of Sir Philip Derval? Thus hurrying on,
page after page, I suddenly, towards the end of the volume, came
upon a name that arrested all my attention,&mdash;Haroun of Aleppo.
He who has read the words addressed to me in my trance may well
conceive the thrill that shot through my heart when I came upon
that name, and will readily understand how much more vividly my
memory retains that part of the manuscript to which I now proceed,
than all which had gone before.</p>

<pre>
   "It was," wrote Sir Philip, "in an obscure suburb of Aleppo that I at
    length met with the wonderful man from whom I have acquired a
    knowledge immeasurably more profound and occult than that which may be
    tested in the experiments to which I have devoted so large a share of
    this memoir.  Haroun of Aleppo had, indeed, mastered every secret in
    nature which the nobler, or theurgic, magic seeks to fathom.

   "He had discovered the great Principle of Animal Life, which had
    hitherto baffled the subtlest anatomist.  Provided only that the great
    organs were not irreparably destroyed, there was no disease that he
    could not cure; no decrepitude to which he could not restore vigour:
    yet his science was based on the same theory as that espoused by the
    best professional practitioner of medicine, namely, that the true art
    of healing is to assist nature to throw off the disease; to summon, as
    it were, the whole system to eject the enemy that has fastened on a
    part.  And thus his processes, though occasionally varying in the
    means employed, all combined in this,&mdash;namely, the re-invigourating
    and recruiting of the principle of life."

</pre>

<p>No one knew the birth or origin of Haroun; no one knew his age.
In outward appearance he was in the strength and prime of mature
manhood; but, according to testimonies in which the writer of the
memoir expressed a belief that, I need scarcely say, appeared to me
egregiously credulous, Haroun's existence under the same name, and
known by the same repute, could be traced back to more than a
hundred years. He told Sir Philip that he had thrice renewed his
own life, and had resolved to do so no more; he had grown weary of
living on. With all his gifts, Haroun owned himself to be consumed
by a profound melancholy. He complained that there was nothing new
to him under the sun; he said that, while he had at his command
unlimited wealth, wealth had ceased to bestow enjoyment, and he
preferred living as simply as a peasant; he had tired out all the
affections and all the passions of the human heart; he was in the
universe as in a solitude. In a word, Haroun would often repeat,
with mournful solemnity: "'The soul is not meant to inhabit this
earth and in fleshy tabernacle for more than the period usually
assigned to mortals; and when by art in repairing the walls of the
body we so retain it, the soul repines, becomes inert or dejected.
He only," said Haroun, "would feel continued joy in continued
existence who could preserve in perfection the sensual part of man,
with such mind or reason as may be independent of the spiritual
essence, but whom soul itself has quitted!&mdash;man, in short, as
the grandest of the animals, but without the sublime discontent of
earth, which is the peculiar attribute of soul."</p>

<p>One evening Sir Philip was surprised to find at Haroun's house
another European. He paused in his narrative to describe this man.
He said that for three or four years previously he had heard
frequent mention, amongst the cultivators of magic, of an
orientalized Englishman engaged in researches similar to his own,
and to whom was ascribed a terrible knowledge in those branches of
the art which, even in the East, are condemned as instrumental to
evil. Sir Philip here distinguished at length, as he had so briefly
distinguished in his conversation with me, between the two kinds of
magic,&mdash;that which he alleged to be as pure from sin as any
other species of experimental knowledge, and that by which the
agencies of witchcraft are invoked for the purposes of guilt.</p>

<p>The Englishman, to whom the culture of this latter and darker
kind of magic was ascribed, Sir Philip Derval had never hitherto
come across. He now met him at the house of Haroun; decrepit,
emaciated, bowed down with infirmities, and racked with pain.
Though little more than sixty, his aspect was that of extreme old
age; but still on his face there were seen the ruins of a once
singular beauty, and still, in his mind, there was a force that
contrasted the decay of the body. Sir Philip had never met with an
intellect more powerful and more corrupt. The son of a notorious
usurer, heir to immense wealth, and endowed with the talents which
justify ambition, he had entered upon life burdened with the odium
of his father's name. A duel, to which he had been provoked by an
ungenerous taunt on his origin, but in which a temperament fiercely
vindictive had led him to violate the usages prescribed by the
social laws that regulate such encounters, had subjected him to a
trial in which he escaped conviction either by a flaw in the
technicalities of legal procedure, or by the compassion of the
jury;(1) but the moral presumptions against him were sufficiently
strong to set an indelible brand on his honour, and an
insurmountable barrier to the hopes which his early ambition had
conceived. After this trial he had quitted his country, to return
to it no more. Thenceforth, much of his life had been passed out of
sight or conjecture of civilized men in remote regions and amongst
barbarous tribes. At intervals, however, he had reappeared in
European capitals; shunned by and shunning his equals, surrounded
by parasites, amongst whom were always to be found men of
considerable learning, whom avarice or poverty subjected to the
influences of his wealth. For the last nine or ten years he had
settled in Persia, purchased extensive lands, maintained the
retinue, and exercised more than the power of an Oriental prince.
Such was the man who, prematurely worn out, and assured by
physicians that he had not six weeks of life, had come to Aleppo
with the gaudy escort of an Eastern satrap, had caused himself to
be borne in his litter to the mud-hut of Haroun the Sage, and now
called on the magician, in whose art was his last hope, to reprieve
him from the&mdash;grave.</p>

<p>He turned round to Sir Philip, when the latter entered the room,
and exclaimed in English, "I am here because you are. Your intimacy
with this man was known to me. I took your character as the
guarantee of his own. Tell me that I am no credulous dupe. Tell him
that I, Louis Grayle, am no needy petitioner. Tell me of his
wisdom; assure him of my wealth."</p>

<p>Sir Philip looked inquiringly at Haroun, who remained seated on
his carpet in profound silence.</p>

<p>"What is it you ask of Haroun?"</p>

<p>"To live on&mdash;to live on! For every year of life he can give
me, I will load these floors with gold."</p>

<p>"Gold will not tempt Haroun."</p>

<p>"What will?"</p>

<p>"Ask him yourself; you speak his language."</p>

<p>"I have asked him; he vouchsafes me no answer."</p>

<p>Haroun here suddenly roused himself as from a revery. He drew
from under his robe a small phial, from which he let fall a single
drop into a cup of water, and said, "Drink this; send to me
tomorrow for such medicaments as I may prescribe. Return hither
yourself in three days; not before!"</p>

<p>When Grayle was gone, Sir Philip, moved to pity, asked Haroun
if, indeed, it were within the compass of his art to preserve life
in a frame that appeared so thoroughly exhausted. Haroun answered,
"A fever may so waste the lamp of life that one ruder gust of air
could extinguish the flame, yet the sick man recovers. This sick
man's existence has been one long fever; this sick man can
recover."</p>

<p>"You will aid him to do so?"</p>

<p>"Three days hence I will tell you."</p>

<p>On the third day Grayle revisited Haroun, and, at Haroun's
request, Sir Philip came also. Grayle declared that he had already
derived unspeakable relief from the remedies administered; he was
lavish in expressions of gratitude; pressed large gifts on Haroun,
and seemed pained when they were refused. This time Haroun
conversed freely, drawing forth Grayle's own irregular, perverted,
stormy, but powerful intellect.</p>

<p>I can best convey the general nature of Grayle's share in the
dialogue between himself, Haroun, and Derval&mdash;recorded in the
narrative in words which I cannot trust my memory to repeat in
detail&mdash;by stating the effect it produced on my own mind. It
seemed, while I read, as if there passed before me some convulsion
of Nature,&mdash;a storm, an earthquake,&mdash;outcries of rage, of
scorn, of despair, a despot's vehemence of will, a rebel's scoff at
authority; yet, ever and anon, some swell of lofty thought, some
burst of passionate genius,&mdash;abrupt variations from the vaunt
of superb defiance to the wail of intense remorse.</p>

<p>The whole had in it, I know not what of uncouth but
colossal,&mdash;like the chant, in the old lyrical tragedy, of one
of those mythical giants, who, proud of descent from Night and
Chaos, had held sway over the elements, while still crude and
conflicting, to be crushed under the rocks, upheaved in their
struggle, as Order and Harmony subjected a brightening Creation to
the milder influences throned in Olympus. But it was not till the
later passages of the dialogue in which my interest was now
absorbed, that the language ascribed to this sinister personage
lost a gloomy pathos not the less impressive for the awe with which
it was mingled. For, till then, it seemed to me as if in that
tempestuous nature there were still broken glimpses of starry
light; that a character originally lofty, if irregular and fierce,
had been embittered by early and continuous war with the social
world, and had, in that war, become maimed and distorted; that,
under happier circumstances, its fiery strength might have been
disciplined to good; that even now, where remorse was so evidently
poignant, evil could not be irredeemably confirmed.</p>

<p>At length all the dreary compassion previously inspired vanished
in one unqualified abhorrence.</p>

<p>The subjects discussed changed from those which, relating to the
common world of men, were within the scope of my reason. Haroun led
his wild guest to boast of his own proficiency in magic, and,
despite my incredulity, I could not overcome the shudder with which
fictions, however extravagant, that deal with that dark Unknown
abandoned to the chimeras of poets, will, at night and in solitude,
send through the veins of men the least accessible to imaginary
terrors.</p>

<p>Grayle spoke of the power he had exercised through the agency of
evil spirits,&mdash;a power to fascinate and to destroy. He spoke
of the aid revealed to him, now too late, which such direful allies
could afford, not only to a private revenge, but to a kingly
ambition. Had he acquired the knowledge he declared himself to
possess before the feebleness of the decaying body made it
valueless, how he could have triumphed over that world which had
expelled his youth from its pale! He spoke of means by which his
influence could work undetected on the minds of others, control
agencies that could never betray, and baffle the justice that could
never discover. He spoke vaguely of a power by which a spectral
reflection of the material body could be cast, like a shadow, to a
distance; glide through the walls of a prison, elude the sentinels
of a camp,&mdash;a power that he asserted to be when enforced by
concentrated will, and acting on the mind, where in each individual
temptation found mind the weakest&mdash;almost infallible in its
effect to seduce or to appall. And he closed these and similar
boasts of demoniacal arts, which I remember too obscurely to
repeat, with a tumultuous imprecation on their nothingness to avail
against the gripe of death. All this lore he would communicate to
Haroun, in return for what? A boon shared by the meanest
peasant,&mdash;life, common life; to breathe yet a while the air,
feel yet a while the sun.</p>

<p>Then Haroun replied. He said, with a quiet disdain, that the
dark art to which Grayle made such boastful pretence was the
meanest of all abuses of knowledge, rightly abandoned, in all ages,
to the vilest natures. And then, suddenly changing his tone, he
spoke, so far as I can remember the words assigned to him in the
manuscript, to this effect,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fallen and unhappy wretch, and you ask me for prolonged
life!&mdash;a prolonged curse to the world and to yourself. Shall I
employ spells to lengthen the term of the Pestilence, or profane
the secrets of Nature to restore vigour and youth to the failing
energies of Crime?"</p>

<p>Grayle, as if stunned by the rebuke, fell on his knees with
despairing entreaties that strangely contrasted his previous
arrogance. "And it was," he said, "because his life had been evil
that he dreaded death. If life could be renewed he would repent, he
would change; he retracted his vaunts, he would forsake the arts he
had boasted, he would re-enter the world as its benefactor."</p>

<p>"So ever the wicked man lies to himself when appalled by the
shadow of death," answered Haroun. "But know, by the remorse which
preys on thy soul, that it is not thy soul that addresses this
prayer to me. Couldst thou hear, through the storms of the Mind,
the Soul's melancholy whisper, it would dissuade thee from a wish
to live on. While I speak, I behold it, that Soul,&mdash;sad for
the stains on its essence, awed by the account it must render, but
dreading, as the direst calamity, a renewal of years below, darker
stains and yet heavier accounts! Whatever the sentence it may now
undergo, it has a hope for mercy in the remorse which the mind
vainly struggles to quell. But darker its doom if longer retained
to earth, yoked to the mind that corrupts it, and enslaved to the
senses which thou bidst me restore to their tyrannous forces."</p>

<p>And Grayle bowed his head and covered his face with his hands in
silence and in trembling.</p>

<p>Then Sir Philip, seized with compassion, pleaded for him. "At
least, could not the soul have longer time on earth for
repentance?" And while Sir Philip was so pleading, Grayle fell
prostrate in a swoon like that of death. When he recovered, his
head was leaning on Haroun's knee, and his opening eyes fixed on
the glittering phial which Haroun held, and from which his lips had
been moistened.</p>

<p>"Wondrous!" he murmured: "how I feel life flowing back to me.
And that, then, is the elixir! it is no fable!"</p>

<p>His hands stretched greedily as to seize the phial, and he cried
imploringly, "More, more!" Haroun replaced the vessel in the folds
of his robe, and answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not renew thy youth, but I will release thee from bodily
suffering: I will leave the mind and the soul free from the pangs
of the flesh, to reconcile, if yet possible, their long war. My
skill may afford thee months yet for repentance; Seek, in that
interval, to atone for the evil of sixty years; apply thy wealth
where it may most compensate for injury done, most relieve the
indigent, and most aid the virtuous. Listen to thy remorse; humble
thyself in prayer."</p>

<p>Grayle departed, sighing heavily and muttering to himself. The
next day Haroun summoned Sir Philip Derval, and said to
him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Depart to Damascus. In that city the Pestilence has appeared.
Go thither thou, to heal and to save. In this casket are stored the
surest antidotes to the poison of the plague. Of that essence,
undiluted and pure, which tempts to the undue prolongation of soul
in the prison of flesh, this casket contains not a drop. I curse
not my friend with so mournful a boon. Thou hast learned enough of
my art to know by what simples the health of the temperate is
easily restored to its balance, and their path to the grave
smoothed from pain. Not more should Man covet from Nature for the
solace and weal of the body. Nobler gifts far than aught for the
body this casket contains. Herein are the essences which quicken
the life of those duplicate senses that lie dormant and coiled in
their chrysalis web, awaiting the wings of a future
development,&mdash;the senses by which we can see, though not with
the eye, and hear, but not by the ear. Herein are the links between
Man's mind and Nature's; herein are secrets more precious even than
these,&mdash;those extracts of light which enable the Soul to
distinguish itself from the Mind, and discriminate the spiritual
life, not more from life carnal than life intellectual. Where thou
seest some noble intellect, studious of Nature, intent upon Truth,
yet ignoring the fact that all animal life has a mind and Man alone
on the earth ever asked, and has asked, from the hour his step trod
the earth, and his eye sought the Heaven, 'Have I not a soul; can
it perish?'&mdash;there, such aids to the soul, in the innermost
vision vouchsafed to the mind, thou mayst lawfully use. But the
treasures contained in this casket are like all which a mortal can
win from the mines he explores,&mdash;good or ill in their uses as
they pass to the hands of the good or the evil. Thou wilt never
confide them but to those who will not abuse! and even then, thou
art an adept too versed in the mysteries of Nature not to
discriminate between the powers that may serve the good to good
ends, and the powers that may tempt the good&mdash;where less wise
than experience has made thee and me&mdash;to the ends that are
evil; and not even to thy friend the most virtuous&mdash;if less
proof against passion than thou and I have become&mdash;wilt thou
confide such contents of the casket as may work on the fancy, to
deafen the conscience and imperil the soul."</p>

<p>Sir Philip took the casket, and with it directions for use,
which he did not detail. He then spoke to Haroun about Louis
Grayle, who had inspired him with a mingled sentiment of admiration
and abhorrence, of pity and terror. And Haroun answered thus,
repeating the words ascribed to him, so far as I can trust, in
regard to them&mdash;as to all else in this marvellous
narrative&mdash;to a memory habitually tenacious even in ordinary
matters, and strained to the utmost extent of its power, by the
strangeness of the ideas presented to it, and the intensity of my
personal interest in whatever admitted a ray into that cloud which,
gathering fast over my reason, now threatened storm to my
affections,&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the mortal deliberately allies himself to the spirits of
evil, he surrenders the citadel of his being to the guard of its
enemies; and those who look from without can only dimly guess what
passes within the precincts abandoned to Powers whose very nature
we shrink to contemplate, lest our mere gaze should invite them.
This man, whom thou pitiest, is not yet everlastingly consigned to
the fiends, because his soul still struggles against them. His life
has been one long war between his intellect, which is mighty, and
his spirit, which is feeble. The intellect, armed and winged by the
passions, has besieged and oppressed the soul; but the soul has
never ceased to repine and to repent. And at moments it has gained
its inherent ascendancy, persuaded revenge to drop the prey it had
seized, turned the mind astray from hatred and wrath into unwonted
paths of charity and love. In the long desert of guilt, there have
been green spots and fountains of good. The fiends have occupied
the intellect which invoked them, but they have never yet
thoroughly mastered the soul which their presence appalls. In the
struggle that now passes within that breast, amidst the flickers of
waning mortality, only Allah, whose eye never slumbers, can
aid."</p>

<p>Haroun then continued, in words yet more strange and yet more
deeply graved in my memory,&mdash;</p>

<p>"There have been men (thou mayst have known such), who, after an
illness in which life itself seemed suspended, have arisen, as out
of a sleep, with characters wholly changed. Before, perhaps, gentle
and good and truthful, they now become bitter, malignant, and
false. To the persons and the things they had before loved, they
evince repugnance and loathing. Sometimes this change is so marked
and irrational that their kindred ascribe it to madness,&mdash;not
the madness which affects them in the ordinary business of life,
but that which turns into harshness and discord the moral harmony
that results from natures whole and complete. But there are
dervishes who hold that in that illness, which had for its time the
likeness of death, the soul itself has passed away, and an evil
genius has fixed itself into the body and the brain, thus left void
of their former tenant, and animates them in the unaccountable
change from the past to the present existence. Such mysteries have
formed no part of my study, and I tell you the conjecture received
in the East without hazarding a comment whether of incredulity or
belief. But if, in this war between the mind which the fiends have
seized, and the soul which implores refuge of Allah; if, while the
mind of yon traveller now covets life lengthened on earth for the
enjoyments it had perverted its faculties to seek and to find in
sin, and covets so eagerly that it would shrink from no crime and
revolt from no fiend that could promise the gift, the soul
shudderingly implores to be saved from new guilt, and would rather
abide by the judgment of Allah on the sins that have darkened it
than pass forever irredeemably away to the demons,&mdash;if this be
so, what if the soul's petition be heard; what if it rise from the
ruins around it; what if the ruins be left to the witchcraft that
seeks to rebuild them? There, if demons might enter, that which
they sought as their prize has escaped them; that which they find
would mock them by its own incompleteness even in evil. In vain
might animal life the most perfect be given to the machine of the
flesh; in vain might the mind, freed from the check of the soul, be
left to roam at will through a brain stored with memories of
knowledge and skilled in the command of its faculties; in vain, in
addition to all that body and brain bestow on the normal condition
of man, might unhallowed reminiscences gather all the arts and the
charms of the sorcery by which the fiends tempted the soul, before
it fled, through the passions of flesh and the cravings of mind:
the Thing, thus devoid of a soul, would be an instrument of evil,
doubtless,&mdash;but an instrument that of itself could not design,
invent, and complete. The demons themselves could have no permanent
hold on the perishable materials. They might enter it for some
gloomy end which Allah permits in his inscrutable wisdom; but they
could leave it no trace when they pass from it, because there is no
conscience where soul is wanting. The human animal without soul,
but otherwise made felicitously perfect in its mere vital
organization, might ravage and destroy, as the tiger and the
serpent may destroy and ravage, and, the moment after, would sport
in the sunlight harmless and rejoicing, because, like the serpent
and the tiger, it is incapable of remorse."</p>

<p>"Why startle my wonder," said Derval, "with so fantastic an
image?"</p>

<p>"Because, possibly, the image may come into palpable form! I
know, while I speak to thee, that this miserable man is calling to
his aid the evil sorcery over which he boasts his control. To gain
the end he desires, he must pass through a crime. Sorcery whispers
to him how to pass through it, secure from the detection of man.
The soul resists, but in resisting, is weak against the tyranny of
the mind to which it has submitted so long. Question me no more.
But if I vanish from thine eyes, if thou hear that the death which,
to my sorrow and in my foolishness I have failed to recognize as
the merciful minister of Heaven, has removed me at last from the
earth, believe that the pale Visitant was welcome, and that I
humbly accept as a blessed release the lot of our common
humanity."</p>

<p>Sir Philip went to Damascus. There he found the pestilence
raging, there he devoted himself to the cure of the afflicted; in
no single instance, so at least he declared, did the antidotes
stored in the casket fail in their effect. The pestilence had
passed, his medicaments were exhausted, when the news reached him
that Haroun was no more. The Sage had been found, one morning,
lifeless in his solitary home, and, according to popular rumour,
marks on his throat betrayed the murderous hand of the strangler.
Simultaneously, Louis Grayle had disappeared from the city, and was
supposed to have shared the fate of Haroun, and been secretly
buried by the assassins who had deprived him of life. Sir Philip
hastened to Aleppo. There he ascertained that on the night in which
Haroun died, Grayle did not disappear alone; with him were also
missing two of his numerous suite,&mdash;the one, an Arab woman,
named Ayesha, who had for some years been his constant companion,
his pupil and associate in the mystic practices to which his
intellect had been debased, and who was said to have acquired a
singular influence over him, partly by her beauty and partly by the
tenderness with which she had nursed him through his long decline;
the other, an Indian, specially assigned to her service, of whom
all the wild retainers of Grayle spoke with detestation and terror.
He was believed by them to belong to that murderous sect of
fanatics whose existence as a community has only recently been made
known to Europe, and who strangle their unsuspecting victim in the
firm belief that they thereby propitiate the favour of the goddess
they serve. The current opinion at Aleppo was, that if those two
persons had conspired to murder Haroun, perhaps for the sake of the
treasures he was said to possess, it was still more certain that
they had made away with their own English lord, whether for the
sake of the jewels he wore about him, or for the sake of treasures
less doubtful than those imputed to Haroun, and of which the
hiding-place would be to them much better known.</p>

<pre>
   "I did not share that opinion," wrote the narrator, "for I assured
    myself that Ayesha sincerely loved her awful master; and that love
    need excite no wonder, for Louis Grayle was one whom if a woman, and
    especially a woman of the East, had once loved, before old age and
    infirmity fell on him, she would love and cherish still more devotedly
    when it became her task to protect the being who, in his day of power
    and command, had exalted his slave into the rank of his pupil and
    companion.  And the Indian whom Grayle had assigned to her service was
    allowed to have that brute kind of fidelity which, though it recoils
    from no crime for a master, refuses all crime against him.

   "I came to the conclusion that Haroun had been murdered by order
    of Louis Grayle,&mdash;for the sake of the elixir of life,&mdash;murdered by
    Juma the Strangler; and that Grayle himself had been aided in his
    flight from Aleppo, and tended, through the effects of the
    life-giving drug thus murderously obtained, by the womanly love of the
    Arab woman Ayesha.  These convictions (since I could not, without
    being ridiculed as the wildest of dupes, even hint at the vital
    elixir) I failed to impress on the Eastern officials, or even on a
    countryman of my own whom I chanced to find at Aleppo.  They only
    arrived at what seemed the common-sense verdict,&mdash;namely, that Haroun
    might have been strangled, or might have died in a fit (the body,
    little examined, was buried long before I came to Aleppo); and that
    Louis Grayle was murdered by his own treacherous dependents.  But all
    trace of the fugitives was lost.

   "And now," wrote Sir Philip, "I will state by what means I discovered
    that Louis Grayle still lived,&mdash;changed from age into youth; a new
    form, a new being; realizing, I verily believe, the image which
    Haroun's words had raised up, in what then seemed to me the
    metaphysics of fantasy,&mdash;-criminal, without consciousness of crime;
    the dreadest of the mere animal race; an incarnation of the blind
    powers of Nature,&mdash;beautiful and joyous, wanton and terrible and
    destroying!  Such as ancient myths have personified in the idols of
    Oriental creeds; such as Nature, of herself, might form man in her
    moments of favour, if man were wholly the animal, and spirit were no
    longer the essential distinction between himself and the races to
    which by superior formation and subtler perceptions he would still be
    the king.

   "But this being is yet more dire and portentous than the mere animal
    man, for in him are not only the fragmentary memories of a pristine
    intelligence which no mind, unaided by the presence of soul, could
    have originally compassed, but amidst that intelligence are the
    secrets of the magic which is learned through the agencies of spirits
    the most hostile to our race.  And who shall say whether the fiends do
    not enter at their will this void and deserted temple whence the soul
    has departed, and use as their tools, passive and unconscious, all the
    faculties which, skilful in sorcery, still place a mind at the
    control of their malice?

   "It was in the interest excited in me by the strange and terrible fate
    that befell an Armenian family with which I was slightly acquainted,
    that I first traced&mdash;in the creature I am now about to describe, and
    whose course I devote myself to watch, and trust to bring to a
    close&mdash;the murderer of Haroun for the sake of the elixir of youth.

   "In this Armenian family there were three daughters; one of them&mdash;"

</pre>

<p>I had just read thus far when a dim shadow fell over the page,
and a cold air seemed to breathe on me,&mdash;cold, so cold, that
my blood halted in my veins as if suddenly frozen! Involuntarily I
started, and looked up, sure that some ghastly presence was in the
room. And then, on the opposite side of the wall, I beheld an
unsubstantial likeness of a human form. Shadow I call it, but the
word is not strictly correct, for it was luminous, though with a
pale shine. In some exhibition in London there is shown a curious
instance of optical illusion; at the end of a corridor you see,
apparently in strong light, a human skull. You are convinced it is
there as you approach; it is, however, only a reflection from a
skull at a distance. The image before me was less vivid, less
seemingly prominent than is the illusion I speak of. I was not
deceived. I felt it was a spectrum, a phantasm; but I felt no less
surely that it was a reflection from an animate form,&mdash;the
form and face of Margrave; it was there, distinct, unmistakable.
Conceiving that he himself must be behind me, I sought to rise, to
turn round, to examine. I could not move: limb and muscle were
overmastered by some incomprehensible spell. Gradually my senses
forsook me; I became unconscious as well as motionless. When I
recovered, I heard the clock strike three. I must have been nearly
two hours insensible! The candles before me were burning low. My
eyes rested on the table; the dead man's manuscript was gone!</p>

<p>(1) The reader will here observe a discrepancy between Mrs.
Poyntz's account and Sir Philip Derval's narrative. According to
the former, Louis Grayle was tried in his absence from England, and
sentenced to three years' imprisonment, which his flight enabled
him to evade. According to the latter, Louis Grayle stood his
trial, and obtained an acquittal. Sir Philip's account must, at
least, be nearer the truth than the lady's, because Louis Grayle
could not, according to English law, have been tried on a capital
charge without being present in court. Mrs. Poyntz tells her story
as a woman generally does tell a story,&mdash;sure to make a
mistake when she touches on a question of law;
and&mdash;unconsciously perhaps to herself&mdash;the woman of the
World warps the facts in her narrative so as to save the personal
dignity of the hero, who has captivated her interest, not from the
moral odium of a great crime, but the debasing position of a
prisoner at the bar. Allen Fenwick, no doubt, purposely omits to
notice the discrepancy between these two statements, or to
animadvert on the mistake which, in the eyes of a lawyer, would
discredit Mrs. Poyntz's. It is consistent with some of the objects
for which Allen Fenwick makes public his Strange Story, to invite
the reader to draw his own inferences from the contradictions by
which, even in the most commonplace matters (and how much more in
any tale of wonder!), a fact stated by one person is made to differ
from the same fact stated by another. The rapidity with which a
truth becomes transformed into fable, when it is once sent on its
travels from lip to lip, is illustrated by an amusement at this
moment in fashion. The amusement is this: In a party of eight or
ten persons, let one whisper to another an account of some supposed
transaction, or a piece of invented gossip relating to absent
persons, dead or alive; let the person, who thus first hears the
story, proceed to whisper it, as exactly as he can remember what he
has just heard, to the next; the next does the same to his
neighbour, and so on, till the tale has run the round of the party.
Each narrator, as soon as he has whispered his version of the tale,
writes down what he has whispered. And though, in this game, no one
has had any interest to misrepresent, but, on the contrary, each
for his own credit's sake strives to repeat what he has heard as
faithfully as he can, it will be almost invariably found that the
story told by the first person has received the most material
alterations before it has reached the eighth or the tenth.
Sometimes the most important feature of the whole narrative is
altogether omitted; sometimes a feature altogether new and
preposterously absurd has been added. At the close of the
experiment one is tempted to exclaim, "How, after this, can any of
those portions of history which the chronicler took from hearsay be
believed?" But, above all, does not every anecdote of scandal which
has passed, not through ten lips, but perhaps through ten thousand,
before it has reached us, become quite as perplexing to him who
would get at the truth, as the marvels he recounts are to the
bewildered reason of Fenwick the Sceptic?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>

<p>The dead man's manuscript was gone. But how? A phantom might
delude my eye, a human will, though exerted at a distance, might,
if the tales of mesmerism be true, deprive me of movement and of
consciousness; but neither phantom nor mesmeric will could surely
remove from the table before me the material substance of the book
that had vanished! Was I to seek explanation in the arts of sorcery
ascribed to Louis Grayle in the narrative? I would not pursue that
conjecture. Against it my reason rose up half alarmed, half
disdainful. Some one must have entered the room, some one have
removed the manuscript. I looked round. The windows were closed,
the curtains partly drawn over the shutters, as they were before my
consciousness had left me: all seemed undisturbed. Snatching up one
of the candles, fast dying out, I went into the adjoining library,
the desolate state-rooms, into the entrance-hall, and examined the
outer door, barred and locked! The robber had left no vestige of
his stealthy presence.</p>

<p>I resolved to go at once to Strahan's room and tell him of the
loss sustained. A deposit had been confided to me, and I felt as if
there were a slur on my honour every moment in which I kept its
abstraction concealed from him to whom I was responsible for the
trust. I hastily ascended the great staircase, grim with faded
portraits, and found myself in a long corridor opening on my own
bedroom; no doubt also on Strahan's. Which was his? I knew not. I
opened rapidly door after door, peered into empty chambers, went
blundering on, when to the right, down a narrow passage. I
recognized the signs of my host's whereabouts,&mdash;signs
familiarly commonplace and vulgar; signs by which the inmate of any
chamber in lodging-house or inn makes himself known,&mdash;a chair
before a doorway, clothes negligently thrown on it, beside it a
pair of shoes. And so ludicrous did such testimony of common
every-day life, of the habits which Strahan would necessarily have
contracted in his desultory unluxurious bachelor's
existence,&mdash;so ludicrous, I say, did these homely details seem
to me, so grotesquely at variance with the wonders of which I had
been reading, with the wonders yet more incredible of which I
myself had been witness and victim, that as I turned down the
passage, I heard my own unconscious half-hysterical laugh; and,
startled by the sound of that laugh as if it came from some one
else, I paused, my hand on the door, and asked myself: "Do I dream?
Am I awake? And if awake what am I to say to the commonplace mortal
I am about to rouse? Speak to him of a phantom! Speak to him of
some weird spell over this strong frame! Speak to him of a mystic
trance in which has been stolen what he confided to me, without my
knowledge! What will he say? What should I have said a few days ago
to any man who told such a tale to me?" I did not wait to resolve
these questions. I entered the room. There was Strahan sound asleep
on his bed. I shook him roughly. He started up, rubbed his eyes.
"You, Allen,&mdash;you! What the deuce?&mdash;what 's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"Strahan, I have been robbed!&mdash;robbed of the manuscript you
lent me. I could not rest till I had told you."</p>

<p>"Robbed, robbed! Are you serious?"</p>

<p>By this time Strahan had thrown off the bed-clothes, and sat
upright, staring at me.</p>

<p>And then those questions which my mind had suggested while I was
standing at his door repeated themselves with double force. Tell
this man, this unimaginative, hard-headed, raw-boned, sandy-haired
North countryman,&mdash;tell this man a story which the most
credulous school-girl would have rejected as a fable!
Impossible!</p>

<p>"I fell asleep," said I, colouring and stammering, for the
slightest deviation from truth was painful to me,
"and-and&mdash;when I awoke&mdash;the manuscript was gone. Some one
must have entered and committed the theft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some one entered the house at this hour of the night and then
only stolen a manuscript which could be of no value to him! Absurd!
If thieves have come in it must be for other objects,&mdash;for
plate, for money. I will dress; we will see!"</p>

<p>Strahan hurried on his clothes, muttering to himself and
avoiding my eye. He was embarrassed. He did not like to say to an
old friend what was on his mind; but I saw at once that he
suspected I had resolved to deprive him of the manuscript, and had
invented a wild tale in order to conceal my own dishonesty.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he proceeded to search the house. I followed him
in silence, oppressed with my own thoughts, and longing for
solitude in my own chamber. We found no one, no trace of any one,
nothing to excite suspicion. There were but two female servants
sleeping in the house,&mdash;the old housekeeper, and a country
girl who assisted her. It was not possible to suspect either of
these persons; but in the course of our search we opened the doors
of their rooms. We saw that they were both in bed, both seemingly
asleep: it seemed idle to wake and question them. When the
formality of our futile investigation was concluded, Strahan
stopped at the door of my bedroom, and for the first time fixing
his eyes on me steadily, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Allen Fenwick, I would have given half the fortune I have come
into rather than this had happened. The manuscript, as you know,
was bequeathed to me as a sacred trust by a benefactor whose
slightest wish it is my duty to observe religiously. If it
contained aught valuable to a man of your knowledge and profession,
why, you were free to use its contents. Let me hope, Allen, that
the book will reappear to-morrow."</p>

<p>He said no more, drew himself away from the hand I involuntarily
extended, and walked quickly back towards his own room.</p>

<p>Alone once more, I sank on a seat, buried my face in my hands,
and strove in vain to collect into some definite shape my own
tumultuous and disordered thoughts. Could I attach serious credit
to the marvellous narrative I had read? Were there, indeed, such
powers given to man, such influences latent in the calm routine of
Nature? I could not believe it; I must have some morbid affection
of the brain; I must be under an hallucination. Hallucination? The
phantom, yes; the trance, yes. But still, how came the book gone?
That, at least, was not hallucination.</p>

<p>I left my room the next morning with a vague hope that I should
find the manuscript somewhere in the study; that, in my own trance,
I might have secreted it, as sleep-walkers are said to secrete
things, without remembrance of their acts in their waking
state.</p>

<p>I searched minutely in every conceivable place. Strahan found me
still employed in that hopeless task. He had breakfasted in his own
room, and it was past eleven o'clock when he joined me. His manner
was now hard, cold, and distant, and his suspicion so bluntly shown
that my distress gave way to resentment.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," I cried indignantly, "that you, who have known
me so well, can suspect me of an act so base, and so gratuitously
base? Purloin, conceal a book confided to me, with full power to
copy from it whatever I might desire, use its contents in any way
that might seem to me serviceable to science, or useful to me in my
own calling!"</p>

<p>"I have not accused you," answered Strahan, sullenly. "But what
are we to say to Mr. Jeeves; to all others who know that this
manuscript existed? Will they believe what you tell me?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Jeeves," I said, "cannot suspect a fellow-townsman, whose
character is as high as mine, of untruth and theft. And to whom
else have you communicated the facts connected with a memoir and a
request of so extraordinary a nature?"</p>

<p>"To young Margrave; I told you so!"</p>

<p>"True, true. We need not go farther to find the thief. Margrave
has been in this house more than once. He knows the position of the
rooms. You have named the robber!"</p>

<p>"Tut! what on earth could a gay young fellow like Margrave want
with a work of such dry and recondite nature as I presume my poor
kinsman's memoir must be?"</p>

<p>I was about to answer, when the door was abruptly opened, and
the servant-girl entered, followed by two men, in whom I recognized
the superintendent of the L&mdash;&mdash; police and the same
subordinate who had found me by Sir Philip's corpse.</p>

<p>The superintendent came up to me with a grave face, and
whispered in my ear. I did not at first comprehend him. "Come with
you," I said, "and to Mr. Vigors, the magistrate? I thought my
deposition was closed."</p>

<p>The superintendent shook his head. "I have the authority here,
Dr. Fenwick."</p>

<p>"Well, I will come, of course. Has anything new transpired?"</p>

<p>The superintendent turned to the servant-girl, who was standing
with gaping mouth and staring eyes.</p>

<p>"Show us Dr. Fenwick's room. You had better put up, sir,
whatever things you have brought here. I will go upstairs with
you," he whispered again. "Come, Dr. Fenwick, I am in the discharge
of my duty."</p>

<p>Something in the man's manner was so sinister and menacing that
I felt at once that some new and strange calamity had befallen me.
I turned towards Strahan. He was at the threshold, speaking in a
low voice to the subordinate policeman, and there was an expression
of amazement and horror in his countenance. As I came towards him
he darted away without a word.</p>

<p>I went up the stairs, entered my bedroom, the superintendent
close behind me. As I took up mechanically the few things I had
brought with me, the police-officer drew them from me with an
abruptness that appeared insolent, and deliberately searched the
pockets of the coat which I had worn the evening before, then
opened the drawers in the room, and even pried into the bed.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked haughtily.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. Duty. You are-"</p>

<p>"Well, I am what?"</p>

<p>"My prisoner; here is the warrant."</p>

<p>"Warrant! on what charge?"</p>

<p>"The murder of Sir Philip Derval."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I! Murder!" I could say no more.</p>

<p>I must hurry over this awful passage in my marvellous record. It
is torture to dwell on the details; and indeed I have so sought to
chase them from my recollection, that they only come back to me in
hideous fragments, like the incoherent remains of a horrible
dream.</p>

<p>All that I need state is as follows: Early on the very morning
on which I had been arrested, a man, a stranger in the town, had
privately sought Mr. Vigors, and deposed that on the night of the
murder, he had been taking refuge from a sudden storm under shelter
of the eaves and buttresses of a wall adjoining an old archway;
that he had heard men talking within the archway; had heard one say
to the other, "You still bear me a grudge." The other had replied,
"I can forgive you on one condition." That he then lost much of the
conversation that ensued, which was in a lower voice; but he
gathered enough to know that the condition demanded by the one was
the possession of a casket which the other carried about with him;
that there seemed an altercation on this matter between the two
men, which, to judge by the tones of voice, was angry on the part
of the man demanding the casket; that, finally, this man said in a
loud key, "Do you still refuse?" and on receiving the answer, which
the witness did not overhear, exclaimed threateningly, "It is you
who will repent," and then stepped forth from the arch into the
street. The rain had then ceased, but by a broad flash of lightning
the witness saw distinctly the figure of the person thus quitting
the shelter of the arch,&mdash;a man of tall stature, powerful
frame, erect carriage. A little time afterwards, witness saw a
slighter and older man come forth from the arch, whom he could only
examine by the flickering ray of the gas-lamp near the wall, the
lightning having ceased, but whom he fully believed to be the
person he afterwards discovered to be Sir Philip Derval.</p>

<p>He said that he himself had only arrived at the town a few hours
before; a stranger to L&mdash;&mdash;, and indeed to England,
having come from the United States of America, where he had passed
his life from childhood. He had journeyed on foot to
L&mdash;&mdash;, in the hope of finding there some distant
relatives. He had put up at a small inn, after which he had
strolled through the town, when the storm had driven him to seek
shelter. He had then failed to find his way back to the inn, and
after wandering about in vain, and seeing no one at that late hour
of night of whom he could ask the way, he had crept under a portico
and slept for two or three hours. Waking towards the dawn, he had
then got up, and again sought to find his way to the inn, when he
saw, in a narrow street before him, two men, one of whom he
recognized as the taller of the two to whose conversation he had
listened under the arch; the other he did not recognize at the
moment. The taller man seemed angry and agitated, and he heard him
say, "The casket; I will have it." There then seemed to be a
struggle between these two persons, when the taller one struck down
the shorter, knelt on his breast, and he caught distinctly the
gleam of some steel instrument. That he was so frightened that he
could not stir from the place, and that though he cried out, he
believed his voice was not heard. He then saw the taller man rise,
the other resting on the pavement motionless; and a minute or so
afterwards beheld policemen coming to the place, on which he, the
witness, walked away. He did not know that a murder had been
committed; it might be only an assault; it was no business of his,
he was a stranger. He thought it best not to interfere, the police
having cognizance of the affair. He found out his inn; for the next
few days he was absent from L&mdash;&mdash; in search of his
relations, who had left the town, many years ago, to fix their
residence in one of the neighbouring villages.</p>

<p>He was, however, disappointed; none of these relations now
survived. He had now returned to L&mdash;&mdash;, heard of the
murder, was in doubt what to do, might get himself into trouble if,
a mere stranger, he gave an unsupported testimony. But, on the day
before the evidence was volunteered, as he was lounging in the
streets, he had seen a gentleman pass by on horseback, in whom he
immediately recognized the man who, in his belief, was the murderer
of Sir Philip Derval. He inquired of a bystander the name of the
gentleman; the answer was "Dr. Fenwick." That, the rest of the day,
he felt much disturbed in his mind, not liking to volunteer such a
charge against a man of apparent respectability and station; but
that his conscience would not let him sleep that night, and he had
resolved at morning to go to the magistrate and make a clean breast
of it.</p>

<p>The story was in itself so improbable that any other magistrate
but Mr. Vigors would perhaps have dismissed it in contempt. But Mr.
Vigors, already so bitterly prejudiced against me, and not sorry,
perhaps, to subject me to the humiliation of so horrible a charge,
immediately issued his warrant to search my house. I was absent at
Derval Court; the house was searched. In the bureau in my favourite
study, which was left unlocked, the steel casket was discovered,
and a large case-knife, on the blade of which the stains of blood
were still perceptible. On this discovery I was apprehended; and on
these evidences, and on the deposition of this vagrant stranger, I
was not, indeed, committed to take my trial for murder, but placed
in confinement, all bail for my appearance refused, and the
examination adjourned to give time for further evidence and
inquiries. I had requested the professional aid of Mr. Jeeves. To
my surprise and dismay, Mr. Jeeves begged me to excuse him. He said
he was pre-engaged by Mr. Strahan to detect and prosecute the
murderer of Sir P. Derval, and could not assist one accused of the
murder. I gathered from the little he said that Strahan had already
been to him that morning and told him of the missing manuscript,
that Strahan had ceased to be my friend. I engaged another
solicitor, a young man of ability, and who professed personal
esteem for me. Mr. Stanton (such was the lawyer's name) believed in
my innocence; but he warned me that appearances were grave, he
implored me to be perfectly frank with him. Had I held conversation
with Sir Philip under the archway as reported by the witness? Had I
used such or similar words? Had the deceased said, "I had a grudge
against him"? Had I demanded the casket? Had I threatened Sir
Philip that he would repent? And of what,&mdash;his refusal?</p>

<p>I felt myself grow pale, as I answered, "Yes; I thought such or
similar expressions had occurred in my conversation with the
deceased."</p>

<p>"What was the reason of the grudge? What was the nature of this
casket, that I should so desire its possession?"</p>

<p>There, I became terribly embarrassed. What could I say to a
keen, sensible, worldly man of law,&mdash;tell him of the powder
and the fumes, of the scene in the museum, of Sir Philip's tale, of
the implied identity of the youthful Margrave with the aged Grayle,
of the elixir of life, and of magic arts? I&mdash;I tell such a
romance! I,&mdash;the noted adversary of all pretended mysticism;
I,&mdash;I a sceptical practitioner of medicine! Had that
manuscript of Sir Philip's been available,&mdash;a substantial
record of marvellous events by a man of repute for intellect and
learning,&mdash;I might perhaps have ventured to startle the
solicitor of L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; with my revelations. But the
sole proof that all which the solicitor urged me to confide was not
a monstrous fiction or an insane delusion had disappeared; and its
disappearance was a part of the terrible mystery that enveloped the
whole. I answered therefore, as composedly as I could, that "I
could have no serious grudge against Sir Philip, whom I had never
seen before that evening; that the words which applied to my
supposed grudge were lightly said by Sir Philip, in reference to a
physiological dispute on matters connected with mesmerical
phenomena; that the deceased had declared his casket, which he had
shown me at the mayor's house, contained drugs of great potency in
medicine; that I had asked permission to test those drugs myself;
and that when I said he would repent of his refusal, I merely meant
that he would repent of his reliance on drugs not warranted by the
experiments of professional science."</p>

<p>My replies seemed to satisfy the lawyer so far, but "how could I
account for the casket and the knife being found in my room?"</p>

<p>"In no way but this; the window of my study is a door-window
opening on the lane, from which any one might enter the room. I was
in the habit, not only of going out myself that way, but of
admitting through that door any more familiar private
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Whom, for instance?"</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment, and then said, with a significance I could
not forbear, "Mr. Margrave! He would know the locale perfectly; he
would know that the door was rarely bolted from within during the
daytime: he could enter at all hours; he could place, or instruct
any one to deposit, the knife and casket in my bureau, which he
knew I never kept locked; it contained no secrets, no private
correspondence,&mdash;chiefly surgical implements, or such things
as I might want for professional experiments."</p>

<p>"Mr. Margrave! But you cannot suspect him&mdash;a lively,
charming young man, against whose character not a whisper was ever
heard&mdash;of connivance with such a charge against you,&mdash;a
connivance that would implicate him in the murder itself; for if
you are accused wrongfully, he who accuses you is either the
criminal or the criminal's accomplice, his instigator or his
tool."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanton," I said firmly, after a moment's pause, "I do
suspect Mr. Margrave of a hand in this crime. Sir Philip, on seeing
him at the mayor's house, expressed a strong abhorrence of him,
more than hinted at crimes he had committed, appointed me to come
to Derval Court the day after that on which the murder was
committed. Sir Philip had known something of this Margrave in the
East; Margrave might dread exposure, revelations&mdash;of what I
know not; but, strange as it may seem to you, it is my conviction
that this young man, apparently so gay and so thoughtless, is the
real criminal, and in some way which I cannot conjecture has
employed this lying vagabond in the fabrication of a charge against
myself. Reflect: of Mr. Margrave's antecedents we know nothing; of
them nothing was known even by the young gentleman who first
introduced him to the society of this town. If you would serve and
save me, it is to that quarter that you will direct your vigilant
and unrelaxing researches."</p>

<p>I had scarcely so said when I repented my candour, for I
observed in the face of Mr. Stanton a sudden revulsion of feeling,
an utter incredulity of the accusation I had thus hazarded, and for
the first time a doubt of my own innocence. The fascination
exercised by Margrave was universal; nor was it to be wondered at:
for besides the charm of his joyous presence, he seemed so
singularly free from even the errors common enough with the
young,&mdash;so gay and boon a companion, yet a shunner of wine; so
dazzling in aspect, so more than beautiful, so courted, so idolized
by women, yet no tale of seduction, of profligacy, attached to his
name! As to his antecedents, he had so frankly owned himself a
natural son, a nobody, a traveller, an idler; his expenses, though
lavish, were so unostentatious, so regularly defrayed; he was so
wholly the reverse of the character assigned to criminals, that it
seemed as absurd to bring a charge of homicide against a butterfly
or a goldfinch as against this seemingly innocent and delightful
favourite of humanity and nature.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Stanton said little or nothing, and shortly
afterwards left me, with a dry expression of hope that my innocence
would be cleared in spite of evidence that, he was bound to say,
was of the most serious character.</p>

<p>I was exhausted. I fell into a profound sleep early that night;
it might be a little after twelve when I woke, and woke as fully,
as completely, as much restored to life and consciousness, as it
was then my habit to be at the break of day. And so waking, I saw,
on the wall opposite my bed, the same luminous phantom I had seen
in the wizard's study at Derval Court. I have read in Scandinavian
legends of an apparition called the Scin-Laeca, or shining corpse.
It is supposed in the northern superstition, sometimes to haunt
sepulchres, sometimes to foretell doom. It is the spectre of a
human body seen in a phosphoric light; and so exactly did this
phantom correspond to the description of such an apparition in
Scandinavian fable that I knew not how to give it a better name
than that of Scin-Laeca,&mdash;the shining corpse.</p>

<p>There it was before me, corpse-like, yet not dead; there, as in
the haunted study of the wizard Forman!&mdash;the form and the face
of Margrave. Constitutionally, my nerves are strong, and my temper
hardy, and now I was resolved to battle against any impression
which my senses might receive from my own deluding fancies. Things
that witnessed for the first time daunt us witnessed for the second
time lose their terror. I rose from my bed with a bold aspect, I
approached the phantom with a firm step; but when within two paces
of it, and my hand outstretched to touch it, my arm became fixed in
air, my feet locked to the ground. I did not experience fear; I
felt that my heart beat regularly, but an invincible something
opposed itself to me. I stood as if turned to stone. And then from
the lips of this phantom there came a voice, but a voice which
seemed borne from a great distance,&mdash;very low, muffled, and
yet distinct; I could not even be sure that my ear heard it, or
whether the sound was not conveyed to me by an inner sense.</p>

<p>"I, and I alone, can save and deliver you," said the voice. "I
will do so; and the conditions I ask, in return, are simple and
easy."</p>

<p>"Fiend or spectre, or mere delusion of my own brain," cried I,
"there can be no compact between thee and me. I despise thy malice,
I reject thy services; I accept no conditions to escape from the
one or to obtain the other."</p>

<p>"You may give a different answer when I ask again."</p>

<p>The Scin-Laeca slowly waned, and, fading first into a paler
shadow, then vanished. I rejoiced at the reply I had given. Two
days elapsed before Mr. Stanton again came to me; in the interval
the Scin-Laeca did not reappear. I had mustered all my courage, all
my common-sense, noted down all the weak points of the false
evidence against me, and felt calm and supported by the strength of
my innocence.</p>

<p>The first few words of the solicitor dashed all my courage to
the ground; for I was anxious to hear news of Lilian, anxious to
have some message from her that might cheer and strengthen me, and
my first question was this,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Stanton, you are aware that I am engaged in marriage to
Miss Ashleigh. Your family are not unacquainted with her. What
says, what thinks she of this monstrous charge against her
betrothed?"</p>

<p>"I was for two hours at Mrs. Ashleigh's house last evening,"
replied the lawyer; "she was naturally anxious to see me as
employed in your defence. Who do you think was there? Who, eager to
defend you, to express his persuasion of your innocence, to declare
his conviction that the real criminal would be soon
discovered,&mdash;who but that same Mr. Margrave; whom, pardon me
my frankness, you so rashly and groundlessly suspected."</p>

<p>"Heavens! Do you say that he is received in that house; that
he&mdash;he is familiarly admitted to her presence?"</p>

<p>"My good sir, why these unjust prepossessions against a true
friend? It was as your friend that, as soon as the charge against
you amazed and shocked the town of L&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. Margrave
called on Mrs. Ashleigh, presented to her by Miss Brabazon, and was
so cheering and hopeful that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough!" I exclaimed,&mdash;"enough!"</p>

<p>I paced the room in a state of excitement and rage, which the
lawyer in vain endeavoured to calm, until at length I halted
abruptly: "Well, and you saw Miss Ashleigh? What message does she
send to me&mdash;her betrothed?"</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton looked confused. "Message! Consider, sir, Miss
Ashleigh's situation&mdash;the
delicacy&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand, no message, no word, from a young lady so
respectable to a man accused of murder."</p>

<p>Mr. Stanton was silent for some moments, and then said quietly,
"Let us change this subject; let us think of what more immediately
presses. I see you have been making some notes: may I look at
them?"</p>

<p>I composed myself and sat down. "This accuser! Have inquiries
really been made as to himself, and his statement of his own
proceedings? He comes, he says, from America: in what ship? At what
port did he land? Is there any evidence to corroborate his story of
the relations he tried to discover; of the inn at which he first
put up, and to which he could not find his way?"</p>

<p>"Your suggestions are sensible, Dr. Fenwick. I have forestalled
them. It is true that the man lodged at a small inn,&mdash;the
Rising Sun; true that he made inquiries about some relations of the
name of Walls, who formerly resided at L&mdash;&mdash;, and
afterwards removed to a village ten miles distant,&mdash;two
brothers, tradesmen of small means but respectable character. He at
first refused to say at what seaport he landed, in what ship he
sailed. I suspect that he has now told a falsehood as to these
matters. I sent my clerk to Southampton, for it is there he said
that he was put on shore; we shall see: the man himself is detained
in close custody. I hear that his manner is strange and excitable;
but that he preserves silence as much as possible. It is generally
believed that he is a bad character, perhaps a returned convict,
and that this is the true reason why he so long delayed giving
evidence, and has been since so reluctant to account for himself.
But even if his testimony should be impugned, should break down,
still we should have to account for the fact that the casket and
the case-knife were found in your bureau; for, granting that a
person could, in your absence, have entered your study and placed
the articles in your bureau, it is clear that such a person must
have been well acquainted with your house, and this stranger to
L&mdash;&mdash; could not have possessed that knowledge."</p>

<p>"Of course not. Mr. Margrave did possess it!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Margrave again! oh, sir!"</p>

<p>I arose and moved away with an impatient gesture. I could not
trust myself to speak. That night I did not sleep; I watched
impatiently, gazing on the opposite wall for the gleam of the
Scin-Laeca. But the night passed away, and the spectre did not
appear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>

<p>The lawyer came the next day, and with something like a smile on
his lips. He brought me a few lines in pencil from Mrs. Ashleigh;
they were kindly expressed, bade me be of good cheer; "she never
for a moment believed in my guilt; Lilian bore up wonderfully under
so terrible a trial; it was an unspeakable comfort to both to
receive the visits of a friend so attached to me, and so confident
of a triumphant refutation of the hideous calumny under which I now
suffered as Mr. Margrave!"</p>

<p>The lawyer had seen Margrave again,&mdash;seen him in that
house. Margrave seemed almost domiciled there!</p>

<p>I remained sullen and taciturn during this visit. I longed again
for the night. Night came. I heard the distant clock strike twelve,
when again the icy wind passed through my hair, and against the
wall stood the luminous Shadow.</p>

<p>"Have you considered?" whispered the voice, still as from afar.
"I repeat it,&mdash;I alone can save you."</p>

<p>"Is it among the conditions which you ask, in return, that I
shall resign to you the woman I love?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is it one of the conditions that I should commit some
crime,&mdash;a crime perhaps heinous as that of which I am
accused?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"With such reservations, I accept the conditions you may name,
provided I, in my turn, may demand one condition from
yourself."</p>

<p>"Name it."</p>

<p>"I ask you to quit this town. I ask you, meanwhile, to cease
your visits to the house that holds the woman betrothed to me."</p>

<p>"I will cease those visits. And before many days are over, I
will quit this town."</p>

<p>"Now, then, say what you ask from me. I am prepared to concede
it. And not from fear for myself, but because I fear for the pure
and innocent being who is under the spell of your deadly
fascination. This is your power over me. You command me through my
love for another. Speak."</p>

<p>"My conditions are simple. You will pledge yourself to desist
from all charges of insinuation against myself, of what nature
soever. You will not, when you meet me in the flesh, refer to what
you have known of my likeness in the Shadow. You will be invited to
the house at which I may be also a guest; you will come; you will
meet and converse with me as guest speaks with guest in the house
of a host."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"It is all."</p>

<p>"Then I pledge you my faith; keep your own."</p>

<p>"Fear not; sleep secure in the certainty that you will soon be
released from these walls."</p>

<p>The Shadow waned and faded. Darkness settled back, and a sleep,
profound and calm, fell over me.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Stanton again visited me. He had received that
morning a note from Mr. Margrave, stating that he had left
L&mdash;&mdash; to pursue, in person, an investigation which he had
already commenced through another, affecting the man who had given
evidence against me, and that, if his hope should prove well
founded, he trusted to establish my innocence, and convict the real
murderer of Sir Philip Derval. In the research he thus volunteered,
he had asked for, and obtained, the assistance of the policeman
Waby, who, grateful to me for saving the life of his sister, had
expressed a strong desire to be employed in my service.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my most cruel assailant was my old college friend,
Richard Strahan. For Jeeves had spread abroad Strahan's charge of
purloining the memoir which had been entrusted to me; and that
accusation had done me great injury in public opinion, because it
seemed to give probability to the only motive which ingenuity could
ascribe to the foul deed imputed to me. That motive had been first
suggested by Mr. Vigors. Cases are on record of men whose life had
been previously blameless, who have committed a crime which seemed
to belie their nature, in the monomania of some intense desire. In
Spain, a scholar reputed of austere morals murdered and robbed a
traveller for money in order to purchase books,&mdash;books
written, too, by Fathers of his Church! He was intent on solving
some problem of theological casuistry. In France, an antiquary,
esteemed not more for his learning than for amiable and gentle
qualities, murdered his most intimate friend for the possession of
a medal, without which his own collection was incomplete. These,
and similar anecdotes, tending to prove how fatally any vehement
desire, morbidly cherished, may suspend the normal operations of
reason and conscience, were whispered about by Dr. Lloyd's
vindictive partisan; and the inference drawn from them and applied
to the assumptions against myself was the more credulously
received, because of that over-refining speculation on motive and
act which the shallow accept, in their eagerness to show how
readily they understand the profound.</p>

<p>I was known to be fond of scientific, especially of chemical
experiments; to be eager in testing the truth of any novel
invention. Strahan, catching hold of the magistrate's fantastic
hypothesis, went about repeating anecdotes of the absorbing passion
for analysis and discovery which had characterized me in youth as a
medical student, and to which, indeed, I owed the precocious
reputation I had obtained.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Derval, according not only to report, but to the
direct testimony of his servant, had acquired in the course of his
travels many secrets in natural science, especially as connected
with the healing art,&mdash;his servant had deposed to the
remarkable cures he had effected by the medicinals stored in the
stolen casket. Doubtless Sir Philip, in boasting of these
medicinals in the course of our conversation, had excited my
curiosity, inflamed my imagination; and thus when I afterwards
suddenly met him in a lone spot, a passionate impulse had acted on
a brain heated into madness by curiosity and covetous desire.</p>

<p>All these suppositions, reduced into system, were corroborated
by Strahan's charge that I had made away with the manuscript
supposed to contain the explanations of the medical agencies
employed by Sir Philip, and had sought to shelter my theft by a
tale so improbable, that a man of my reputed talent could not have
hazarded it if in his sound senses. I saw the web that had thus
been spread around me by hostile prepossessions and ignorant
gossip: how could the arts of Margrave scatter that web to the
winds? I knew not, but I felt confidence in his promise and his
power. Still, so great had been my alarm for Lilian, that the hope
of clearing my own innocence was almost lost in my joy that
Margrave, at least, was no longer in her presence, and that I had
received his pledge to quit the town in which she lived.</p>

<p>Thus, hours rolled on hours, till, I think, on the third day
from that night in which I had last beheld the mysterious Shadow,
my door was hastily thrown open, a confused crowd presented itself
at the threshold,&mdash;the governor of the prison, the police
superintendent, Mr. Stanton, and other familiar faces shut out from
me since my imprisonment. I knew at the first glance that I was no
longer an outlaw beyond the pale of human friendship. And proudly,
sternly, as I had supported myself hitherto in solitude and
suspense, when I felt warm hands clasping mine, heard joyous voices
proffering congratulations, saw in the eyes of all that my
innocence had been cleared, the revulsion of emotion was too strong
for me,&mdash;the room reeled on my sight, I fainted. I pass, as
quickly as I can, over the explanations that crowded on me when I
recovered, and that were publicly given in evidence in court next
morning. I had owed all to Margrave. It seems that he had construed
to my favour the very supposition which had been bruited abroad to
my prejudice. "For," said he, "it is conjectured that Fenwick
committed the crime of which he is accused in the impulse of a
disordered reason. That conjecture is based upon the probability
that a madman alone could have committed a crime without adequate
motive. But it seems quite clear that the accused is not mad; and I
see cause to suspect that the accuser is." Grounding this
assumption on the current reports of the witness's manner and
bearing since he had been placed under official surveillance,
Margrave had commissioned the policeman Waby to make inquiries in
the village to which the accuser asserted he had gone in quest of
his relations, and Waby had there found persons who remembered to
have heard that the two brothers named Walls lived less by the
gains of the petty shop which they kept than by the proceeds of
some property consigned to them as the nearest of kin to a lunatic
who had once been tried for his life. Margrave had then examined
the advertisements in the daily newspapers. One of them, warning
the public against a dangerous maniac, who had effected his escape
from an asylum in the west of England, caught his attention. To
that asylum he had repaired.</p>

<p>There he learned that the patient advertised was one whose
propensity was homicide, consigned for life to the asylum on
account of a murder, for which he had been tried. The description
of this person exactly tallied with that of the pretended American.
The medical superintendent of the asylum, hearing all particulars
from Margrave, expressed a strong persuasion that the witness was
his missing patient, and had himself committed the crime of which
he had accused another. If so, the superintendent undertook to coax
from him the full confession of all the circumstances. Like many
other madmen, and not least those whose propensity is to crime, the
fugitive maniac was exceedingly cunning, treacherous, secret, and
habituated to trick and stratagem,&mdash;more subtle than even the
astute in possession of all their faculties, whether to achieve his
purpose or to conceal it, and fabricate appearances against
another. But while, in ordinary conversation, he seemed rational
enough to those who were not accustomed to study him, he had one
hallucination which, when humoured, led him always, not only to
betray himself, but to glory in any crime proposed or committed. He
was under the belief that he had made a bargain with Satan, who, in
return for implicit obedience, would bear him harmless through all
the consequences of such submission, and finally raise him to great
power and authority. It is no unfrequent illusion of homicidal
maniacs to suppose they are under the influence of the Evil One, or
possessed by a Demon. Murderers have assigned as the only reason
they themselves could give for their crime, that "the Devil got
into them," and urged the deed. But the insane have, perhaps, no
attribute more in common than that of superweening self-esteem. The
maniac who has been removed from a garret sticks straws in his hair
and calls them a crown. So much does inordinate arrogance
characterize mental aberration, that, in the course of my own
practice, I have detected, in that infirmity, the certain symptom
of insanity, long before the brain had made its disease manifest
even to the most familiar kindred.</p>

<p>Morbid self-esteem accordingly pervaded the dreadful illusion by
which the man I now speak of was possessed. He was proud to be the
protected agent of the Fallen Angel. And if that self-esteem were
artfully appealed to, he would exult superbly in the evil he held
himself ordered to perform, as if a special prerogative, an
official rank and privilege; then, he would be led on to boast
gleefully of thoughts which the most cynical of criminals in whom
intelligence was not ruined would shrink from owning; then, he
would reveal himself in all his deformity with as complacent and
frank a self-glorying as some vain good man displays in parading
his amiable sentiments and his beneficent deeds.</p>

<p>"If," said the superintendent, "this be the patient who has
escaped from me, and if his propensity to homicide has been, in
some way, directed towards the person who has been murdered, I
shall not be with him a quarter of an hour before he will inform me
how it happened, and detail the arts he employed in shifting his
crime upon another; all will be told as minutely as a child tells
the tale of some school-boy exploit, in which he counts on your
sympathy, and feels sure of your applause."</p>

<p>Margrave brought this gentleman back to L&mdash;&mdash;, took
him to the mayor, who was one of my warmest supporters: the mayor
had sufficient influence to dictate and arrange the rest. The
superintendent was introduced to the room in which the pretended
American was lodged. At his own desire a select number of witnesses
were admitted with him. Margrave excused himself; he said candidly
that he was too intimate a friend of mine to be an impartial
listener to aught that concerned me so nearly.</p>

<p>The superintendent proved right in his suspicions, and verified
his promises. My false accuser was his missing patient; the man
recognized Dr. &mdash;&mdash; with no apparent terror, rather with
an air of condescension, and in a very few minutes was led to tell
his own tale, with a gloating complacency both at the agency by
which he deemed himself exalted, and at the dexterous cunning with
which he had acquitted himself of the task, that increased the
horror of his narrative.</p>

<p>He spoke of the mode of his escape, which was extremely
ingenious, but of which the details, long in themselves, did not
interest me, and I understood them too imperfectly to repeat. He
had encountered a sea-faring traveller on the road, whom he had
knocked down with a stone, and robbed of his glazed hat and
pea-jacket, as well as of a small sum in coin, which last enabled
him to pay his fare in a railway that conveyed him eighty miles
away from the asylum. Some trifling remnant of this money still in
his pocket, he then travelled on foot along the high-road till he
came to a town about twenty miles distant from L&mdash;&mdash;;
there he had stayed a day or two, and there he said "that the Devil
had told him to buy a case-knife, which he did." "He knew by that
order that the Devil meant him to do something great." "His
Master," as he called the fiend, then directed him the road he
should take. He came to L&mdash;&mdash;, put up, as he had
correctly stated before, at a small inn, wandered at night about
the town, was surprised by the sudden storm, took shelter under the
convent arch, overheard somewhat more of my conversation with Sir
Philip than he had previously deposed,&mdash;heard enough to excite
his curiosity as to the casket: "While he listened his Master told
him he must get possession of that casket." Sir Philip had quitted
the archway almost immediately after I had done so, and he would
then have attacked him if he had not caught sight of a policeman
going his rounds. He had followed Sir Philip to a house (Mr.
Jeeves's). "His Master told him to wait and watch." He did so. When
Sir Philip came forth, towards the dawn, he followed him, saw him
enter a narrow street, came up to him, seized him by the arm,
demanded all he had about him. Sir Philip tried to shake him
off,&mdash;struck at him. What follows I spare the reader. The deed
was done. He robbed the dead man both of the casket and the purse
that he found in the pockets; had scarcely done so when he heard
footsteps. He had just time to get behind the portico of a detached
house at angles with the street when I came up. He witnessed, from
his hiding-place, the brief conference between myself and the
policemen, and when they moved on, bearing the body, stole
unobserved away. He was going back towards the inn, when it
occurred to him that it would be safer if the casket and purse were
not about his person; that he asked his Master to direct him how to
dispose of them: that his Master guided him to an open yard (a
stone-mason's) at a very little distance from the inn; that in this
yard there stood an old wych-elm tree, from the gnarled roots of
which the earth was worn away, leaving chinks and hollows, in one
of which he placed the casket and purse, taking from the latter
only two sovereigns and some silver, and then heaping loose mould
over the hiding-place. That he then repaired to his inn, and left
it late in the morning, on the pretence of seeking for his
relations,&mdash;persons, indeed, who really had been related to
him, but of whose death years ago he was aware. He returned to
L&mdash;&mdash; a few days afterwards, and in the dead of the night
went to take up the casket and the money. He found the purse with
its contents undisturbed; but the lid of the casket was unclosed.
From the hasty glance he had taken of it before burying it, it had
seemed to him firmly locked,&mdash;he was alarmed lest some one had
been to the spot. But his Master whispered to him not to mind, told
him that he might now take the casket, and would be guided what to
do with it; that he did so, and, opening the lid, found the casket
empty-; that he took the rest of the money out of the purse, but
that he did not take the purse itself, for it had a crest and
initials on it, which might lead to the discovery of what had been
done; that he therefore left it in the hollow amongst the roots,
heaping the mould over it as before; that in the course of the day
he heard the people at the inn talk of the murder, and that his own
first impulse was to get out of the town immediately, but that his
Master "made him too wise for that," and bade him stay; that
passing through the streets, he saw me come out of the sash-window
door, go to a stable-yard on the other side of the house, mount on
horseback and ride away; that he observed the sash-door was left
partially open; that he walked by it and saw the room empty; there
was only a dead wall opposite; the place was solitary, unobserved;
that his Master directed him to lift up the sash gently, enter the
room, and deposit the knife and the casket in a large walnut-tree
bureau which stood unlocked near the window. All that
followed&mdash;his visit to Mr. Vigors, his accusation against
myself, his whole tale&mdash;was, he said, dictated by his Master,
who was highly pleased with him, and promised to bring him safely
through. And here he turned round with a hideous smile, as if for
approbation of his notable cleverness and respect for his high
employ.</p>

<p>Mr. Jeeves had the curiosity to request the keeper to inquire
how, in what form, or in what manner, the Fiend appeared to the
narrator, or conveyed his infernal dictates. The man at first
refused to say; but it was gradually drawn from him that the Demon
had no certain and invariable form: sometimes it appeared to him in
the form of a rat; sometimes even of a leaf, or a fragment of wood,
or a rusty nail; but that his Master's voice always came to him
distinctly, whatever shape he appeared in; only, he said, with an
air of great importance, his Master, this time, had graciously
condescended, ever since he left the asylum, to communicate with
him in a much more pleasing and imposing aspect than he had ever
done before,&mdash;in the form of a beautiful youth, or, rather,
like a bright rose-coloured shadow, in which the features of a
young man were visible, and that he had heard the voice more
distinctly than usual, though in a milder tone, and seeming to come
to him from a great distance.</p>

<p>After these revelations the man became suddenly disturbed. He
shook from limb to limb, he seemed convulsed with terror; he cried
out that he had betrayed the secret of his Master, who had warned
him not to describe his appearance and mode of communication, or he
would surrender his servant to the tormentors. Then the maniac's
terror gave way to fury; his more direful propensity made itself
declared; he sprang into the midst of his frightened listeners,
seized Mr. Vigors by the throat, and would have strangled him but
for the prompt rush of the superintendent and his satellites.
Foaming at the mouth, and horribly raving, he was then manacled, a
strait-waistcoat thrust upon him, and the group so left him in
charge of his captors. Inquiries were immediately directed towards
such circumstantial evidence as might corroborate the details he
had so minutely set forth. The purse, recognized as Sir Philip's,
by the valet of the deceased, was found buried under the wych-elm.
A policeman despatched, express, to the town in which the maniac
declared the knife to have been purchased, brought back word that a
cutler in the place remembered perfectly to have sold such a knife
to a seafaring man, and identified the instrument when it was shown
to him. From the chink of a door ajar, in the wall opposite my
sash-window, a maid-servant, watching for her sweetheart (a
journeyman carpenter, who habitually passed that way on going home
to dine), had, though unobserved by the murderer, seen him come out
of my window at a time that corresponded with the dates of his own
story, though she had thought nothing of it at the moment. He might
be a patient, or have called on business; she did not know that I
was from home. The only point of importance not cleared up was that
which related to the opening of the casket,&mdash;the disappearance
of the contents; the lock had been unquestionably forced. No one,
however, could suppose that some third person had discovered the
hiding-place and forced open the casket to abstract its contents
and then rebury it. The only probable supposition was that the man
himself had forced it open, and, deeming the contents of no value,
had thrown them away before he had hidden the casket and purse,
and, in the chaos of his reason, had forgotten that he had so done.
Who could expect that every link in a madman's tale would be found
integral and perfect? In short, little importance was attached to
this solitary doubt. Crowds accompanied me to my door, when I was
set free, in open court, stainless; it was a triumphal procession.
The popularity I had previously enjoyed, superseded for a moment by
so horrible a charge, came back to me tenfold as with the reaction
of generous repentance for a momentary doubt. One man shared the
public favour,&mdash;the young man whose acuteness had delivered me
from the peril, and cleared the truth from so awful a mystery; but
Margrave had escaped from congratulation and compliment; he had
gone on a visit to Strahan, at Derval Court.</p>

<p>Alone, at last, in the welcome sanctuary of my own home, what
were my thoughts? Prominent amongst them all was that assertion of
the madman, which had made me shudder when repeated to me: he had
been guided to the murder and to all the subsequent proceedings by
the luminous shadow of the beautiful youth,&mdash;the Scin-Laeca to
which I had pledged myself. If Sir Philip Derval could be believed,
Margrave was possessed of powers, derived from fragmentary
recollections of a knowledge acquired in a former state of being,
which would render his remorseless intelligence infinitely dire and
frustrate the endeavours of a reason, unassisted by similar powers,
to thwart his designs or bring the law against his crimes. Had he
then the arts that could thus influence the minds of others to
serve his fell purposes, and achieve securely his own evil ends
through agencies that could not be traced home to himself?</p>

<p>But for what conceivable purpose had I been subjected as a
victim to influences as much beyond my control as the Fate or
Demoniac Necessity of a Greek Myth? In the legends of the classic
world some august sufferer is oppressed by powers more than mortal,
but with an ethical if gloomy vindication of his
chastisement,&mdash;he pays the penalty of crime committed by his
ancestors or himself, or he has braved, by arrogating equality with
the gods, the mysterious calamity which the gods alone can inflict.
But I, no descendant of Pelops, no OEdipus boastful of a wisdom
which could interpret the enigmas of the Sphynx, while ignorant
even of his own birth&mdash;what had I done to be singled out from
the herd of men for trials and visitations from the Shadowland of
ghosts and sorcerers? It would be ludicrously absurd to suppose
that Dr. Lloyd's dying imprecation could have had a prophetic
effect upon my destiny; to believe that the pretences of
mesmerizers were specially favoured by Providence, and that to
question their assumptions was an offence of profanation to be
punished by exposure to preternatural agencies. There was not even
that congruity between cause and effect which fable seeks in excuse
for its inventions. Of all men living, I, unimaginative disciple of
austere science, should be the last to become the sport of that
witchcraft which even imagination reluctantly allows to the
machinery of poets, and science casts aside into the mouldy
lumber-room of obsolete superstition.</p>

<p>Rousing my mind from enigmas impossible to solve, it was with
intense and yet most melancholy satisfaction that I turned to the
image of Lilian, rejoicing, though with a thrill of awe, that the
promise so mysteriously conveyed to my senses had, hereto, been
already fulfilled,&mdash;Margrave had left the town; Lilian was no
longer subjected to his evil fascination. But an instinct told me
that that fascination had already produced an effect adverse to all
hope of happiness for me. Lilian's love for myself was gone.
Impossible otherwise that she&mdash;in whose nature I had always
admired that generous devotion which is more or less inseparable
from the romance of youth&mdash;should have never conveyed to me
one word of consolation in the hour of my agony and trial; that
she, who, till the last evening we had met, had ever been so
docile, in the sweetness of a nature femininely submissive to my
slightest wish, should have disregarded my solemn injunction, and
admitted Margrave to acquaintance, nay, to familiar
intimacy,&mdash;at the very time, too, when to disobey my
injunctions was to embitter my ordeal, and add her own contempt to
the degradation imposed upon my honour! No, her heart must be
wholly gone from me; her very nature wholly warped. A union between
us had become impossible. My love for her remained unshattered; the
more tender, perhaps, for a sentiment of compassion. But my pride
was shocked, my heart was wounded. My love was not mean and
servile. Enough for me to think that she would be at least saved
from Margrave. Her life associated with his!&mdash;contemplation
horrible and ghastly!&mdash;from that fate she was saved. Later,
she would recover the effect of an influence happily so brief. She
might form some new attachment, some new tie; but love once
withdrawn is never to be restored&mdash;and her love was withdrawn
from me. I had but to release her, with my own lips, from our
engagement,&mdash;she would welcome that release. Mournful but firm
in these thoughts and these resolutions, I sought Mrs. Ashleigh's
house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>

<p>It was twilight when I entered, unannounced (as had been my wont
in our familiar intercourse), the quiet sitting-room in which I
expected to find mother and child. But Lilian was there alone,
seated by the open window, her hands crossed and drooping on her
knee, her eye fixed upon the darkening summer skies, in which the
evening star had just stolen forth, bright and steadfast, near the
pale sickle of a half-moon that was dimly visible, but gave as yet
no light.</p>

<p>Let any lover imagine the reception he would expect to meet from
his betrothed coming into her presence after he had passed
triumphant through a terrible peril to life and fame&mdash;and
conceive what ice froze my blood, what anguish weighed down my
heart, when Lilian, turning towards me, rose not, spoke not, gazed
at me heedlessly as if at some indifferent
stranger&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;But no matter. I cannot bear to
recall it even now, at the distance of years! I sat down beside
her, and took her hand, without pressing it; it rested languidly,
passively in mine, one moment; I dropped it then, with a bitter
sigh.</p>

<p>"Lilian," I said quietly, "you love me no longer. Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to mine, looked at me wistfully, and pressed
her hand on her forehead; then said, in a strange voice, "Did I
ever love you? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Lilian, Lilian, rouse yourself; are you not, while you speak,
under some spell, some influence which you cannot describe nor
account for?"</p>

<p>She paused a moment before she answered, calmly, "No! Again I
ask what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean? Do you forget that we are betrothed? Do you
forget how often, and how recently, our vows of affection and
constancy have been exchanged?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not forget; but I must have deceived you and
myself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is true, then, that you love me no more?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"But, oh, Lilian, is it that your heart is only closed to me; or
is it&mdash;oh, answer truthfully&mdash;is it given to
another,&mdash;to him&mdash;to him&mdash;against whom I warned you,
whom I implored you not to receive? Tell me, at least, that your
love is not gone to Margrave&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To him! love to him! Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, then, is your feeling towards him?"</p>

<p>Lilian's face grew visibly paler, even in that dim light. "I
know not," she said, almost in a whisper; "but it is partly
awe&mdash;partly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Abhorrence!" she said almost fiercely, and rose to her feet,
with a wild defying start.</p>

<p>"If that be so," I said gently, "you would not grieve were you
never again to see him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I shall see him again," she murmured in a tone of weary
sadness, and sank back once more into her chair.</p>

<p>"I think not," said I, "and I hope not. And now hear me and heed
me, Lilian. It is enough for me, no matter what your feelings
towards another, to learn from yourself that the affection you once
professed for me is gone. I release you from your troth. If folks
ask why we two henceforth separate the lives we had agreed to join,
you may say, if you please, that you could not give your hand to a
man who had known the taint of a felon's prison, even on a false
charge. If that seems to you an ungenerous reason, we will leave it
to your mother to find a better. Farewell! For your own sake I can
yet feel happiness,&mdash;happiness to hear that you do not love
the man against whom I warn you still more solemnly than before!
Will you not give me your hand in parting&mdash;and have I not
spoken your own wish?"</p>

<p>She turned away her face, and resigned her hand to me in
silence. Silently I held it in mine, and my emotions nearly stifled
me. One symptom of regret, of reluctance, on her part, and I should
have fallen at her feet, and cried, "Do not let us break a tie
which our vows should have made indisoluble; heed not my offers,
wrung from a tortured heart! You cannot have ceased to love me!"
But no such symptom of relenting showed itself in her, and with a
groan I left the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>

<p>I was just outside the garden door, when I felt an arm thrown
round me, my cheek kissed and wetted with tears. Could it be
Lilian? Alas, no! It was her mother's voice, that, between laughing
and crying, exclaimed hysterically: "This is joy, to see you again,
and on these thresholds. I have just come from your house; I went
there on purpose to congratulate you, and to talk to you about
Lilian. But you have seen her?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have but this moment left her. Come this way." I drew
Mrs. Ashleigh back into the garden, along the old winding walk,
which the shrubs concealed from view of the house. We sat down on a
rustic seat where I had often sat with Lilian, midway between the
house and the Monks' Well. I told the mother what had passed
between me and her daughter; I made no complaint of Lilian's
coldness and change; I did not hint at its cause. "Girls of her age
will change," said I, "and all that now remains is for us two to
agree on such a tale to our curious neighbours as may rest the
whole blame on me. Man's name is of robust fibre; it could not push
its way to a place in the world, if it could not bear, without
sinking, the load idle tongues may lay on it. Not so Woman's Name:
what is but gossip against Man, is scandal against Woman."</p>

<p>"Do not be rash, my dear Allen," said Mrs. Ashleigh, in great
distress. "I feel for you, I understand you; in your case I might
act as you do. I cannot blame you. Lilian is changed,&mdash;changed
unaccountably. Yet sure I am that the change is only on the
surface, that her heart is really yours, as entirely and as
faithfully as ever it was; and that later, when she recovers from
the strange, dreamy kind of torpor which appears to have come over
all her faculties and all her affections, she would awake with a
despair which you cannot conjecture to the knowledge that you had
renounced her."</p>

<p>"I have not renounced her," said I, impatiently; "I did but
restore her freedom of choice. But pass by this now, and explain to
me more fully the change in your daughter, which I gather from your
words is not confined to me."</p>

<p>"I wished to speak of it before you saw her, and for that reason
came to your house. It was on the morning in which we left her
aunt's to return hither that I first noticed some thing peculiar in
her look and manner. She seemed absorbed and absent, so much so
that I asked her several times to tell me what made her so grave;
but I could only get from her that she had had a confused dream
which she could not recall distinctly enough to relate, but that
she was sure it boded evil. During the journey she became gradually
more herself, and began to look forward with delight to the idea of
seeing you again. Well, you came that evening. What passed between
you and her you know best. You complained that she slighted your
request to shun all acquaintance with Mr. Margrave. I was surprised
that, whether your wish were reasonable or not, she could have
hesitated to comply with it. I spoke to her about it after you had
gone, and she wept bitterly at thinking she had displeased
you."</p>

<p>"She wept! You amaze me. Yet the next day what a note she
returned to mine!"</p>

<p>"The next day the change in her became very visible to me. She
told me, in an excited manner, that she was convinced she ought not
to marry you. Then came, the following day, the news of your
committal. I heard of it, but dared not break it to her. I went to
our friend the mayor, to consult with him what to say, what to do;
and to learn more distinctly than I had done from terrified,
incoherent servants, the rights of so dreadful a story. When I
returned, I found, to my amazement, a young stranger in the
drawing-room; it was Mr. Margrave,&mdash;Miss Brabazon had brought
him at his request. Lilian was in the room, too, and my
astonishment was increased, when she said to me with a singular
smile, vague but tranquil: 'I know all about Allen Fenwick; Mr.
Margrave has told me all. He is a friend of Allen's. He says there
is no cause for fear.' Mr. Margrave then apologized to me for his
intrusion in a caressing, kindly manner, as if one of the family.
He said he was so intimate with you that he felt that he could best
break to Miss Ashleigh information she might receive elsewhere, for
that he was the only man in the town who treated the charge with
ridicule. You know the wonderful charm of this young man's manner.
I cannot explain to you how it was, but in a few moments I was as
much at home with him as if he had been your brother. To be brief,
having once come, he came constantly. He had moved, two days before
you went to Derval Court, from his hotel to apartments in Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;'s house, just opposite. We could see him on his
balcony from our terrace; he would smile to us and come across. I
did wrong in slighting your injunction, and suffering Lilian to do
so. I could not help it, he was such a comfort to me,&mdash;to her,
too&mdash;in her tribulation. He alone had no doleful words, wore
no long face; he alone was invariably cheerful. 'Everything,' he
said, 'would come right in a day or two.'"</p>

<p>"And Lilian could not but admire this young man, he is so
beautiful."</p>

<p>"Beautiful? Well, perhaps. But if you have a jealous feeling,
you were never more mistaken. Lilian, I am convinced, does more
than dislike him; he has inspired her with repugnance, with terror.
And much as I own I like him, in his wild, joyous, careless,
harmless way, do not think I flatter you if I say that Mr. Margrave
is not the man to make any girl untrue to you,&mdash;untrue to a
lover with infinitely less advantages than you may pretend to. He
would be a universal favourite, I grant; but there is something in
him, or a something wanting in him, which makes liking and
admiration stop short of love. I know not why; perhaps, because,
with all his good humour, he is so absorbed in himself, so
intensely egotistical, so light; were he less clever, I should say
so frivolous. He could not make love, he could not say in the
serious tone of a man in earnest, 'I love you.' He owned as much to
me, and owned, too, that he knew not even what love was. As to
myself, Mr. Margrave appears rich; no whisper against his character
or his honour ever reached me. Yet were you out of the question,
and were there no stain on his birth, nay, were he as high in rank
and wealth as he is favoured by Nature in personal advantages, I
confess I could never consent to trust him with my daughter's fate.
A voice at my heart would cry, 'No!' It may be an unreasonable
prejudice, but I could not bear to see him touch Lilian's
hand!"</p>

<p>"Did she never, then&mdash;never suffer him even to take her
hand?"</p>

<p>"Never. Do not think so meanly of her as to suppose that she
could be caught by a fair face, a graceful manner. Reflect: just
before she had refused, for your sake, Ashleigh Sumner, whom Lady
Haughton said 'no girl in her senses could refuse;' and this change
in Lilian really began before we returned to
L&mdash;&mdash;,&mdash;before she had even seen Mr. Margrave. I am
convinced it is something in the reach of your skill as
physician,&mdash;it is on the nerves, the system. I will give you a
proof of what I say, only do not betray me to her. It was during
your imprisonment, the night before your release, that I was
awakened by her coming to my bedside. She was sobbing as if her
heart would break. 'O mother, mother!' she cried, 'pity me, help
me! I am so wretched.' 'What is the matter, darling?' 'I have been
so cruel to Allen, and I know I shall be so again. I cannot help
it. Do not question me; only if we are separated, if he cast me
off, or I reject him, tell him some day perhaps when I am in my
grave&mdash;not to believe appearances; and that I, in my heart of
hearts, never ceased to love him!'"</p>

<p>"She said that! You are not deceiving me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! how can you think so?"</p>

<p>"There is hope still," I murmured; and I bowed my head upon my
hands, hot tears forcing their way through the clasped fingers.</p>

<p>"One word more," said I; "you tell me that Lilian has a
repugnance to this Margrave, and yet that she found comfort in his
visits,&mdash;a comfort that could not be wholly ascribed to
cheering words he might say about myself, since it is all but
certain that I was not, at that time, uppermost in her mind. Can
you explain this apparent contradiction?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, otherwise than by a conjecture which you would
ridicule."</p>

<p>"I can ridicule nothing now. What is your conjecture?"</p>

<p>"I know how much you disbelieve in the stories one hears of
animal magnetism and electro-biology, otherwise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You think that Margrave exercises some power of that kind over
Lilian? Has he spoken of such a power?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly; but he said that he was sure Lilian possessed a
faculty that he called by some hard name, not clairvoyance, but a
faculty, which he said, when I asked him to explain, was akin to
prevision,&mdash;to second sight. Then he talked of the Priestesses
who had administered the ancient oracles. Lilian, he said, reminded
him of them, with her deep eyes and mysterious smile."</p>

<p>"And Lilian heard him? What said she?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; she seemed in fear while she listened."</p>

<p>"He did not offer to try any of those arts practised by
professional mesmerists and other charlatans?"</p>

<p>"I thought he was about to do so, but I forestalled him, saying
I never would consent to any experiment of that kind, either on
myself or my daughter."</p>

<p>"And he replied&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With his gay laugh, 'that I was very foolish; that a person
possessed of such a faculty as he attributed to Lilian would, if
the faculty were developed, be an invaluable adviser.' He would
have said more, but I begged him to desist. Still I fancy at
times&mdash;do not be angry&mdash;that he does somehow or other
bewitch her, unconsciously to herself; for she always knows when he
is coming. Indeed, I am not sure that he does not bewitch myself,
for I by no means justify my conduct in admitting him to an
intimacy so familiar, and in spite of your wish; I have reproached
myself, resolved to shut my door on him, or to show by my manner
that his visits were unwelcome; yet when Lilian has said, in the
drowsy lethargic tone which has come into her voice (her voice
naturally earnest and impressive, though always low), 'Mother, he
will be here in two minutes; I wish to leave the room and cannot,'
I, too, have felt as if something constrained me against my will;
as if, in short, I were under that influence which Mr.
Vigors&mdash;whom I will never forgive for his conduct to
you&mdash;would ascribe to mesmerism. But will you not come in and
see Lilian again?"</p>

<p>"No, not to-night; but watch and heed her, and if you see aught
to make you honestly believe that she regrets the rupture of the
old tic from which I have released her&mdash;why, you know, Mrs.
Ashleigh, that&mdash;that&mdash;" My voice failed; I wrung the good
woman's hand, and went my way.</p>

<p>I had always till then considered Mrs. Ashleigh&mdash;if not as
Mrs. Poyntz described her&mdash;"commonplace weak"&mdash;still of
an intelligence somewhat below mediocrity. I now regarded her with
respect as well as grateful tenderness; her plain sense had divined
what all my boasted knowledge had failed to detect in my earlier
intimacy with Margrave,&mdash;namely, that in him there was a
something present, or a something wanting, which forbade love and
excited fear. Young, beautiful, wealthy, seemingly blameless in
life as he was, she would not have given her daughter's hand to
him!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>

<p>The next day my house was filled with visitors. I had no notion
that I had so many friends. Mr. Vigors wrote me a generous and
handsome letter, owning his prejudices against me on account of his
sympathy with poor Dr. Lloyd, and begging my pardon for what he now
felt to have been harshness, if not distorted justice. But what
most moved me was the entrance of Strahan, who rushed up to me with
the heartiness of old college days. "Oh, my dear Allen, can you
ever forgive me; that I should have disbelieved your
word,&mdash;should have suspected you of abstracting my poor
cousin's memoir?"</p>

<p>"Is it found, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; you must thank Margrave. He, clever fellow, you know,
came to me on a visit yesterday. He put me at once on the right
scent. Only guess; but you never can! It was that wretched old
housekeeper who purloined the manuscript. You remember she came
into the room while you were looking at the memoir. She heard us
talk about it; her curiosity was roused; she longed to know the
history of her old master, under his own hand; she could not sleep;
she heard me go up to bed; she thought you might leave the book on
the table when you, too, went to rest. She stole downstairs, peeped
through the keyhole of the library, saw you asleep, the book lying
before you, entered, took away the book softly, meant to glance at
its contents and to return it. You were sleeping so soundly she
thought you would not wake for an hour; she carried it into the
library, leaving the door open, and there began to pore over it.
She stumbled first on one of the passages in Latin; she hoped to
find some part in plain English, turned over the leaves, putting
her candle close to them, for the old woman's eyes were dim, when
she heard you make some sound in your sleep. Alarmed, she looked
round; you were moving uneasily in your seat, and muttering to
yourself. From watching you she was soon diverted by the
consequences of her own confounded curiosity and folly. In moving,
she had unconsciously brought the poor manuscript close to the
candle; the leaves caught the flame; her own cap and hand burning
first made her aware of the mischief done. She threw down the book;
her sleeve was in flames; she had first to tear off the sleeve,
which was, luckily for her, not sewn to her dress. By the time she
recovered presence of mind to attend to the book, half its leaves
were reduced to tinder. She did not dare then to replace what was
left of the manuscript on your table; returned with it to her room,
hid it, and resolved to keep her own secret. I should never have
guessed it; I had never even spoken to her of the occurrence; but
when I talked over the disappearance of the book to Margrave last
night, and expressed my disbelief of your story, he said, in his
merry way: 'But do you think that Fenwick is the only person
curious about your cousin's odd ways and strange history? Why,
every servant in the household would have been equally curious. You
have examined your servants, of course?' 'No, I never thought of
it.' 'Examine them now, then. Examine especially that old
housekeeper. I observe a great change in her manner since I came
here, weeks ago, to look over the house. She has something on her
mind,&mdash;I see it in her eyes.' Then it occurred to me, too,
that the woman's manner had altered, and that she seemed always in
a tremble and a fidget. I went at once to her room, and charged her
with stealing the book. She fell on her knees, and told the whole
story as I have told it to you, and as I shall take care to tell it
to all to whom I have so foolishly blabbed my yet more foolish
suspicions of yourself. But can you forgive me, old friend?"</p>

<p>"Heartily, heartily! And the book is burned?"</p>

<p>"See;" and he produced a mutilated manuscript. Strange, the part
burned&mdash;reduced, indeed, to tinder&mdash;was the concluding
part that related to Haroun,&mdash;to Grayle: no vestige of that
part was left; the earlier portions were scorched and mutilated,
though in some places still decipherable; but as my eye hastily ran
over those places, I saw only mangled sentences of the experimental
problems which the writer had so minutely elaborated.</p>

<p>"Will you keep the manuscript as it is, and as long as you
like?" said Strahan.</p>

<p>"No, no; I will have nothing more to do with it. Consult some
other man of science. And so this is the old woman's whole story?
No accomplice,&mdash;none? No one else shared her curiosity and her
task?"</p>

<p>"No. Oddly enough, though, she made much the same excuse for her
pitiful folly that the madman made for his terrible crime; she
said, 'the Devil put it into her head.' Of course he did, as he
puts everything wrong into any one's head. That does not mend the
matter."</p>

<p>"How! did she, too, say she saw a Shadow and heard a voice?"</p>

<p>"No; not such a liar as that, and not mad enough for such a lie.
But she said that when she was in bed, thinking over the book,
something irresistible urged her to get up and go down into the
study; swore she felt something lead her by the hand; swore, too,
that when she first discovered the manuscript was not in English,
something whispered in her ear to turn over the leaves and approach
them to the candle. But I had no patience to listen to all this
rubbish. I sent her out of the house, bag and baggage. But, alas!
is this to be the end of all my wise cousin's grand
discoveries?"</p>

<p>True, of labours that aspired to bring into the chart of science
new worlds, of which even the traditionary rumour was but a voice
from the land of fable&mdash;nought left but broken vestiges of a
daring footstep! The hope of a name imperishable amidst the
loftiest hierarchy of Nature's secret temple, with all the pomp of
recorded experiment, that applied to the mysteries of Egypt and
Chaldaea the inductions of Bacon, the tests of Liebig&mdash;was
there nothing left of this but what, here and there, some puzzled
student might extract, garbled, mutilated, perhaps unintelligible,
from shreds of sentences, wrecks of problems! O mind of man, can
the works, on which thou wouldst found immortality below, be
annulled into smoke and tinder by an inch of candle in the hand of
an old woman!</p>

<p>When Strahan left me, I went out, but not yet to visit patients.
I stole through by-paths into the fields; I needed solitude to
bring my thoughts into shape and order. What was delusion, and what
not? Was I right or the Public? Was Margrave really the most
innocent and serviceable of human beings, kindly affectionate,
employing a wonderful acuteness for benignant ends? Was I, in
truth, indebted to him for the greatest boon one man can bestow on
another,&mdash;for life rescued, for fair name justified? Or had
he, by some demoniac sorcery, guided the hand of the murderer
against the life of the person who alone could imperil his own? Had
he, by the same dark spells, urged the woman to the act that had
destroyed the only record of his monstrous being,&mdash;the only
evidence that I was not the sport of an illusion in the horror with
which he inspired me?</p>

<p>But if the latter supposition could be admissible, did he use
his agents only to betray them afterwards to exposure, and that,
without any possible clew to his own detection as the instigator?
Then, there came over me confused recollections of tales of
mediaeval witchcraft, which I had read in boyhood. Were there not
on judicial record attestation and evidence, solemn and
circumstantial, of powers analogous to those now exercised by
Margrave,&mdash;of sorcerers instigating to sin through influences
ascribed to Demons; making their apparitions glide through guarded
walls, their voices heard from afar in the solitude of dungeons or
monastic cells; subjugating victims to their will, by means which
no vigilance could have detected, if the victims themselves had not
confessed the witchcraft that had ensnared, courting a sure and
infamous death in that confession, preferring such death to a life
so haunted? Were stories so gravely set forth in the pomp of
judicial evidence, and in the history of times comparatively
recent, indeed to be massed, pell-mell together, as a moles
indigesta of senseless superstition,&mdash;all the witnesses to be
deemed liars; all the victims and tools of the sorcerers, lunatics;
all the examiners or judges, with their solemn gradations&mdash;lay
and clerical&mdash;from Commissions of Inquiry to Courts of
Appeal,&mdash;to be despised for credulity, loathed for cruelty;
or, amidst records so numerous, so imposingly attested, were there
the fragments of a terrible truth? And had our ancestors been so
unwise in those laws we now deem so savage, by which the world was
rid of scourges more awful and more potent than the felon with his
candid dagger? Fell instigators of the evil in men's secret hearts,
shaping into action the vague, half-formed desire, and guiding with
agencies impalpable, unseen, their spell-bound instruments of
calamity and death.</p>

<p>Such were the gloomy questions that I&mdash;by repute, the
sternest advocate of common-sense against fantastic errors; by
profession, the searcher into flesh and blood, and tissue and nerve
and sinew, for the causes of all that disease the mechanism of the
universal human frame; I, self-boasting physician, sceptic,
philosopher, materialist&mdash;revolved, not amidst gloomy pines,
under grim winter skies, but as I paced slow through laughing
meadows, and by the banks of merry streams, in the ripeness of the
golden August: the hum of insects in the fragrant grass, the
flutter of birds amid the delicate green of boughs checkered by
playful sunbeams and gentle shadows, and ever in sight of the
resorts of busy workday man,&mdash;walls, roof-tops, church-spires
rising high; there, white and modern, the handwriting of our race,
in this practical nineteenth century, on its square plain masonry
and Doric shafts, the Town-Hall, central in the animated
marketplace. And I&mdash;I&mdash;prying into long-neglected corners
and dust-holes of memory for what my reason had flung there as
worthless rubbish; reviving the jargon of French law, in the proces
verbal, against a Gille de Retz, or an Urbain Grandier, and sifting
the equity of sentences on witchcraft!</p>

<p>Bursting the links of this ghastly soliloquy with a laugh at my
own folly, I struck into a narrow path that led back towards the
city, by a quiet and rural suburb; the path wound on through a wide
and solitary churchyard, at the base of the Abbey-hill. Many of the
former dwellers on that eminence now slept in the lowly
burial-ground at its foot; and the place, mournfully decorated with
the tombs which still jealously mark distinctions of rank amidst
the levelling democracy of the grave, was kept trim with the care
which comes half from piety, and half from pride.</p>

<p>I seated myself on a bench, placed between the clipped yew-trees
that bordered the path from the entrance to the church porch,
deeming vaguely that my own perplexing thoughts might imbibe a
quiet from the quiet of the place.</p>

<p>"And oh," I murmured to myself, "oh that I had one bosom friend
to whom I might freely confide all these torturing riddles which I
cannot solve,&mdash;one who could read my heart, light up its
darkness, exorcise its spectres; one in whose wisdom I could
welcome a guide through the Nature which now suddenly changes her
aspect, opening out from the walls with which I had fenced and
enclosed her as mine own formal garden;&mdash;all her pathways,
therein, trimmed to my footstep; all her blooms grouped and
harmonized to my own taste in colour; all her groves, all her
caverns, but the soothing retreats of a Muse or a Science; opening
out&mdash;opening out, desert on desert, into clewless and
measureless space! Gone is the garden! Were its confines too narrow
for Nature? Be it so! The Desert replaces the garden, but where
ends the Desert? Reft from my senses are the laws which gave order
and place to their old questionless realm. I stand lost and
appalled amidst Chaos. Did my Mind misconstrue the laws it deemed
fixed and immutable? Be it so! But still Nature cannot be lawless;
Creation is not a Chaos. If my senses deceive me in some things,
they are still unerring in others; if thus, in some things,
fallacious, still, in other things, truthful. Are there within me
senses finer than those I have cultured, or without me vistas of
knowledge which instincts, apart from my senses, divine? So long as
I deal with the Finite alone, my senses suffice me; but when the
Infinite is obtruded upon me there, are my senses faithless
deserters? If so, is there aught else in my royal resources of
Man&mdash;whose ambition it is, from the first dawn of his glory as
Thinker, to invade and to subjugate Nature,&mdash;is there aught
else to supply the place of those traitors, the senses, who report
to my Reason, their judge and their sovereign, as truths seen and
heard tales which my Reason forfeits her sceptre if she does not
disdain as lies? Oh, for a friend! oh, for a guide!"</p>

<p>And as I so murmured, my eye fell upon the form of a kneeling
child,&mdash;at the farther end of the burial-ground, beside a
grave with its new headstone gleaming white amidst the older
moss-grown tombs, a female child, her head bowed, her hands
clasped. I could see but the outline of her small form in its sable
dress,&mdash;an infant beside the dead. My eye and my thoughts were
turned from that silent figure, too absorbed in my own restless
tumult of doubt and dread, for sympathy with the grief or the
consolation of a kneeling child. And yet I should have remembered
that tomb! Again I murmured with a fierce impatience, "Oh, for a
friend! oh, for a guide!"</p>

<p>I heard steps on the walk under the yews; and an old man came in
sight, slightly bent, with long gray hair, but still with enough of
vigour for years to come, in his tread, firm, though slow, in the
unshrunken muscle of his limbs and the steady light of his clear
blue eye. I started. Was it possible? That countenance, marked,
indeed, with the lines of laborious thought, but sweet in the
mildness of humanity, and serene in the peace of conscience! I
could not be mistaken. Julius Faber was before me,&mdash;the
profound pathologist, to whom my own proud self-esteem acknowledged
inferiority, without humiliation; the generous benefactor to whom I
owed my own smooth entrance into the arduous road of fame and
fortune. I had longed for a friend, a guide; what I sought stood
suddenly at my side.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<p>Explanation on Faber's part was short and simple. The nephew
whom he designed as the heir to his wealth had largely outstripped
the liberal allowance made to him, had incurred heavy debts; and in
order to extricate himself from the debts, had plunged into ruinous
speculations. Faber had come back to England to save his heir from
prison or outlawry, at the expense of more than three-fourths of
the destined inheritance. To add to all, the young man had married
a young lady without fortune; the uncle only heard of this marriage
on arriving in England. The spendthrift was hiding from his
creditors in the house of his father-in-law, in one of the western
counties. Faber there sought him; and on becoming acquainted with
his wife, grew reconciled to the marriage, and formed hopes of his
nephew's future redemption. He spoke, indeed, of the young wife
with great affection. She was good and sensible; willing and
anxious to encounter any privation by which her husband might
reprieve the effects of his folly. "So," said Faber, "on
consultation with this excellent creature&mdash;for my poor nephew
is so broken down by repentance, that others must think for him how
to exalt repentance into reform&mdash;my plans were determined. I
shall remove my prodigal from all scenes of temptation. He has
youth, strength, plenty of energy, hitherto misdirected. I shall
take him from the Old World into the New. I have decided on
Australia. The fortune still left to me, small here, will be ample
capital there. It is not enough to maintain us separately, so we
must all live together. Besides, I feel that, though I have neither
the strength or the experience which could best serve a young
settler on a strange soil, still, under my eye, my poor boy will be
at once more prudent and more persevering. We sail next week."</p>

<p>Faber spoke so cheerfully that I knew not how to express
compassion; yet, at his age, after a career of such prolonged and
distinguished labour, to resign the ease and comforts of the
civilized state for the hardships and rudeness of an infant colony,
seemed to me a dreary prospect; and, as delicately, as tenderly as
I could to one whom I loved and honoured as a father, I placed at
his disposal the fortune which, in great part, I owed to
him,&mdash;pressing him at least to take from it enough to secure
to himself, in his own country, a home suited to his years and
worthy of his station. He rejected all my offers, however earnestly
urged on him, with his usual modest and gentle dignity; and
assuring me that he looked forward with great interest to a
residence in lands new to his experience, and affording ample scope
for the hardy enjoyments which had always most allured his tastes,
he hastened to change the subject.</p>

<p>"And who, think you, is the admirable helpmate my scape-grace
has had the saving good luck to find? A daughter of the worthy man
who undertook the care of poor Dr. Lloyd's orphans,&mdash;the
orphans who owed so much to your generous exertions to secure a
provision for them; and that child, now just risen from her
father's grave, is my pet companion, my darling ewe lamb,&mdash;Dr.
Lloyd's daughter Amy."</p>

<p>Here the child joined us, quickening her pace as she recognized
the old man, and nestling to his side as she glanced wistfully
towards myself. A winning, candid, lovable child's face, somewhat
melancholy, somewhat more thoughtful than is common to the face of
childhood, but calm, intelligent, and ineffably mild. Presently she
stole from the old man, and put her hand in mine.</p>

<p>"Are you not the kind gentleman who came to see him that night
when he passed away from us, and who, they all say at home, was so
good to my brothers and me? Yes, I recollect you now." And she put
her pure face to mine, wooing me to kiss it.</p>

<p>I kind! I good! I&mdash;I! Alas! she little knew, little
guessed, the wrathful imprecation her father had bequeathed to me
that fatal night!</p>

<p>I did not dare to kiss Dr. Lloyd's orphan daughter, but my tears
fell over her hand. She took them as signs of pity, and, in her
infant thankfulness, silently kissed me.</p>

<p>"Oh, my friend!" I murmured to Faber, "I have much that I yearn
to say to you&mdash;alone&mdash;alone! Come to my house with me, be
at least my guest as long as you stay in this town."</p>

<p>"Willingly," said Faber, looking at me more intently than he had
done before, and with the true eye of the practised Healer, at once
soft and penetrating.</p>

<p>He rose, took my arm, and whispering a word in the ear of the
little girl, she went on before us, turning her head, as she gained
the gate, for another look at her father's grave. As we walked to
my house, Julius Faber spoke to me much of this child. Her brothers
were all at school; she was greatly attached to his nephew's wife;
she had become yet more attached to Faber himself, though on so
short an acquaintance; it had been settled that she was to
accompany the emigrants to Australia.</p>

<p>"There," said he, "the sum, that some munificent, but unknown
friend of her father has settled on her, will provide her no mean
dower for a colonist's wife, when the time comes for her to bring a
blessing to some other hearth than ours." He went on to say that
she had wished to accompany him to L&mdash;&mdash;, in order to
visit her father's grave before crossing the wide seas; "and she
has taken such fond care of me all the way, that you might fancy I
were the child of the two. I come back to this town, partly to
dispose of a few poor houses in it which still belong to me,
principally to bid you farewell before quitting the Old World, no
doubt forever. So, on arriving to-day, I left Amy by herself in the
churchyard while I went to your house, but you were from home. And
now I must congratulate you on the reputation you have so rapidly
acquired, which has even surpassed my predictions."</p>

<p>"You are aware," said I, falteringly, "of the extraordinary
charge from which that part of my reputation dearest to all men has
just emerged!"</p>

<p>He had but seen a short account in a weekly journal, written
after my release. He asked details, which I postponed.</p>

<p>Reaching my home, I hastened to provide for the comfort of my
two unexpected guests; strove to rally myself, to be cheerful. Not
till night, when Julius Faber and I were alone together, did I
touch on what was weighing at my heart. Then, drawing to his side,
I told him all,&mdash;all of which the substance is herein written,
from the deathscene in Dr. Lloyd's chamber to the hour in which I
had seen Dr. Lloyd's child at her father's grave. Some of the
incidents and conversations which had most impressed me I had
already committed to writing, in the fear that, otherwise, my fancy
might forge for its own thraldom the links of reminiscence which my
memory might let fall from its chain. Faber listened with a silence
only interrupted by short pertinent questions; and when I had done,
he remained thoughtful for some moments; then the great physician
replied thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I take for granted your conviction of the reality of all you
tell me, even of the Luminous Shadow, of the bodiless Voice; but,
before admitting the reality itself, we must abide by the old
maxim, not to accept as cause to effect those agencies which belong
to the Marvellous, when causes less improbable for the effect can
be rationally conjectured. In this case are there not such causes?
Certainly there are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are?"</p>

<p>"Listen; you are one of those men who attempt to stifle their
own imagination. But in all completed intellect, imagination
exists, and will force its way; deny it healthful vents, and it may
stray into morbid channels. The death-room of Dr. Lloyd deeply
impressed your heart, far more than your pride would own. This is
clear from the pains you took to exonerate your conscience, in your
generosity to the orphans. As the heart was moved, so was the
imagination stirred; and, unaware to yourself, prepared for much
that subsequently appealed to it. Your sudden love, conceived in
the very grounds of the house so associated with recollections in
themselves strange and romantic; the peculiar temperament and
nature of the girl to whom your love was attracted; her own
visionary beliefs, and the keen anxiety which infused into your
love a deeper poetry of sentiment,&mdash;all insensibly tended to
induce the imagination to dwell on the Wonderful; and, in
overstriving to reconcile each rarer phenomenon to the most
positive laws of Nature, your very intellect could discover no
solution but in the Preternatural.</p>

<p>"You visit a man who tells you he has seen Sir Philip Derval's
ghost; on that very evening, you hear a strange story, in which Sir
Philip's name is mixed up with a tale of murder, implicating two
mysterious pretenders to magic,&mdash;Louis Grayle and the Sage of
Aleppo. The tale so interests your fancy that even the glaring
impossibility of a not unimportant part of it escapes your
notice,&mdash;namely, the account of a criminal trial in which the
circumstantial evidence was more easily attainable than in all the
rest of the narrative, but which could not legally have taken place
as told. Thus it is whenever the mind begins, unconsciously, to
admit the shadow of the Supernatural; the Obvious is lost to the
eye that plunges its gaze into the Obscure. Almost immediately
afterwards you become acquainted with a young stranger, whose
traits of character interest and perplex, attract yet revolt you.
All this time you are engaged in a physiological work which
severely tasks the brain, and in which you examine the intricate
question of soul distinct from mind.</p>

<p>"And, here, I can conceive a cause deep-hid amongst what
metaphysicians would call latent associations, for a train of
thought which disposed you to accept the fantastic impressions
afterwards made on you by the scene in the Museum and the visionary
talk of Sir Philip Derval. Doubtless, when at college you first
studied metaphysical speculation you would have glanced over
Beattie's 'Essay on Truth' as one of the works written in
opposition to your favourite, David Hume."</p>

<p>"Yes, I read the book, but I have long since forgotten its
arguments."</p>

<p>"Well in that essay, Beattie(1) cites the extraordinary instance
of Simon Browne, a learned and pious clergyman, who seriously
disbelieved the existence of his own soul; and imagined that, by
interposition of Divine power, his soul was annulled, and nothing
left but a principle of animal life, which he held in common with
the brutes! When, years ago, a thoughtful imaginative student, you
came on that story, probably enough you would have paused, revolved
in your own mind and fancy what kind of a creature a man might be,
if, retaining human life and merely human understanding, he was
deprived of the powers and properties which reasoners have ascribed
to the existence of soul. Something in this young man,
unconsciously to yourself, revives that forgotten train of
meditative ideas. His dread of death as the final cessation of
being, his brute-like want of sympathy with his kind, his
incapacity to comprehend the motives which carry man on to scheme
and to build for a future that extends beyond his grave,&mdash;all
start up before you at the very moment your reason is overtasked,
your imagination fevered, in seeking the solution of problems
which, to a philosophy based upon your system, must always remain
insoluble. The young man's conversation not only thus excites your
fancies,&mdash;it disturbs your affections. He speaks not only of
drugs that renew youth, but of charms that secure love. You tremble
for your Lilian while you hear him! And the brain thus tasked, the
imagination thus inflamed, the heart thus agitated, you are
presented to Sir Philip Derval, whose ghost your patient had
supposed he saw weeks ago.</p>

<p>"This person, a seeker after an occult philosophy, which had
possibly acquainted him with some secrets in nature beyond the pale
of our conventional experience, though, when analyzed, they might
prove to be quite reconcilable with sober science, startles you
with an undefined mysterious charge against the young man who had
previously seemed to you different from ordinary mortals. In a room
stored with the dead things of the brute soulless world, your brain
becomes intoxicated with the fumes of some vapour which produces
effects not uncommon in the superstitious practices of the East;
your brain, thus excited, brings distinctly before you the vague
impressions it had before received. Margrave becomes identified
with the Louis Grayle of whom you had previously heard an obscure
and, legendary tale, and all the anomalies in his character are
explained by his being that which you had contended, in your
physiological work, it was quite possible for man to
be,&mdash;namely, mind and body without soul! You were startled by
the monster which man would be were your own theory possible; and
in order to reconcile the contradictions in this very monster, you
account for knowledge, and for powers that mind without soul could
not have attained, by ascribing to this prodigy broken memories of
a former existence, demon attributes from former proficiency in
evil magic. My friend, there is nothing here which your own study
of morbid idiosyncracies should not suffice to solve."</p>

<p>"So, then," said I, "you would reduce all that have affected my
senses as realities into the deceit of illusions? But," I added, in
a whisper, terrified by my own question, "do not physiologists
agree in this: namely, that though illusory phantasms may haunt the
sane as well as the insane, the sane know that they are only
illusions, and the insane do not."</p>

<p>"Such a distinction," answered Faber, "is far too arbitrary and
rigid for more than a very general and qualified acceptance.
Muller, indeed, who is perhaps the highest authority on such a
subject, says, with prudent reserve, 'When a person who is not
insane sees spectres and believes, them to be real, his intellect
must be imperfectly exercised.'(2) He would, indeed, be a bold
physician who maintained that every man who believed he had really
seen a ghost was of unsound mind. In Dr. Abercrombie's interesting
account of spectral illusions, he tells us of a servant-girl who
believed she saw, at the foot of her bed, the apparition of Curran,
in a sailor's jacket and an immense pair of whiskers.(3) No doubt
the spectre was an illusion, and Dr. Abercrombie very ingeniously
suggests the association of ideas by which the apparition was
conjured up with the grotesque adjuncts of the jacket and the
whiskers; but the servant-girl, in believing the reality of the
apparition, was certainly not insane. When I read in the American
public journals(4) of 'spirit manifestations,' in which large
numbers of persons, of at least the average degree of education,
declare that they have actually witnessed various phantasms, much
more extraordinary than all which you have confided to me, and
arrive, at once, at the conclusion that they are thus put into
direct communication with departed souls, I must assume that they
are under an illusion; but I should be utterly unwarranted in
supposing that, because they credited that illusion, they were
insane. I should only say with Muller, that in their reasoning on
the phenomena presented to them, 'their intellect was imperfectly
exercised.' And an impression made on the senses, being in itself
sufficiently rare to excite our wonder, may be strengthened till it
takes the form of a positive fact, by various coincidences which
are accepted as corroborative testimony, yet which are,
nevertheless, nothing more than coincidences found in every day
matters of business, but only emphatically noticed when we can
exclaim, 'How astonishing!' In your case such coincidences have
been, indeed, very signal, and might well aggravate the
perplexities into which your reason was thrown. Sir Philip Derval's
murder, the missing casket, the exciting nature of the manuscript,
in which a superstitious interest is already enlisted by your
expectation to find in it the key to the narrator's boasted powers,
and his reasons for the astounding denunciation of the man whom you
suspect to be his murderer,&mdash;in all this there is much to
confirm, nay, to cause, an illusion; and for that very reason, when
examined by strict laws of evidence, in all this there is but
additional proof that the illusion was&mdash;only illusion. Your
affections contribute to strengthen your fancy in its war on your
reason. The girl you so passionately love develops, to your
disquietude and terror, the visionary temperament which, at her
age, is ever liable to fantastic caprices. She hears Margrave's
song, which you say has a wildness of charm that affects and
thrills even you. Who does not know the power of music? and of all
music, there is none so potential as that of the human voice. Thus,
in some languages, charm and song are identical expressions; and
even when a critic, in our own sober newspapers, extols a Malibran
or a Grisi, you may be sure that he will call her 'enchantress.'
Well, this lady, your betrothed, in whom the nervous system is
extremely impressionable, hears a voice which, even to your ear, is
strangely melodious, and sees a form and face which, even to your
eye, are endowed with a singular character of beauty. Her fancy is
impressed by what she thus hears and sees; and impressed the more
because, by a coincidence not very uncommon, a face like that which
she beholds has before been presented to her in a dream or a
revery. In the nobleness of genuine, confiding, reverential love,
rather than impute to your beloved a levity of sentiment that would
seem to you a treason, you accept the chimera of 'magical
fascination.' In this frame of mind you sit down to read the memoir
of a mystical enthusiast. Do you begin now to account for the
Luminous Shadow? A dream! And a dream no less because your eyes
were open and you believed yourself awake. The diseased imagination
resembles those mirrors which, being themselves distorted,
represent distorted pictures as correct.</p>

<p>"And even this Memoir of Sir Philip Derval's&mdash;can you be
quite sure that you actually read the part which relates to Haroun
and Louis Grayle? You say that, while perusing the manuscript, you
saw the Luminous Shadow, and became insensible. The old woman says
you were fast asleep. May you not really have fallen into a
slumber, and in that slumber have dreamed the parts of the tale
that relate to Grayle,&mdash;dreamed that you beheld the Shadow? Do
you remember what is said so well by Dr. Abercrombie, to authorize
the explanation I suggest to you: 'A person under the influence of
some strong mental impression falls asleep for a few seconds,
perhaps without being sensible of it: some scene or person appears
in a dream, and he starts up under the conviction that it was a
spectral appearance.'" (5)</p>

<p>"But," said I, "the apparition was seen by me again, and when,
certainly, I was not sleeping."</p>

<p>"True; and who should know better than a physician so well read
as yourself that a spectral illusion once beheld is always apt to
return again in the same form? Thus, Goethe was long haunted by one
image,&mdash;the phantom of a flower unfolding itself, and
developing new flowers.(6) Thus, one of our most distinguished
philosophers tells us of a lady known to himself, who would see her
husband, hear him move and speak, when he was not even in the
house.(7) But instances of the facility with which phantasms, once
admitted, repeat themselves to the senses, are numberless. Many are
recorded by Hibbert and Abercrombie, and every physician in
extensive practice can add largely, from his own experience, to the
list. Intense self-concentration is, in itself, a mighty magician.
The magicians of the East inculcate the necessity of fast,
solitude, and meditation for the due development of their imaginary
powers. And I have no doubt with effect; because fast, solitude,
and meditation&mdash;in other words, thought or fancy intensely
concentred&mdash;will both raise apparitions and produce the
invoker's belief in them. Spinello, striving to conceive the image
of Lucifer for his picture of the Fallen Angels, was at last
actually haunted by the Shadow of the Fiend. Newton himself has
been subjected to a phantom, though to him, Son of Light, the
spectre presented was that of the sun! You remember the account
that Newton gives to Locke of this visionary appearance. He says
that 'though he had looked at the sun with his right eye only, and
not with the left, yet his fancy began to make an impression upon
his left eye as well as his right; for if he shut his right and
looked upon the clouds, or a book, or any bright object with his
left eye, he could see the sun almost as plain as with the right,
if he did but intend his fancy a little while on it;' nay, 'for
some months after, as often as he began to meditate on the
phenomena, the spectrum of the sun began to return, even though he
lay in bed at midnight, with his curtains drawn!' Seeing, then, how
any vivid impression once made will recur, what wonder that you
should behold in your prison the Shining Shadow that had first
startled you in a wizard's chamber when poring over the records of
a murdered visionary? The more minutely you analyze your own
hallucinations&mdash;pardon me the word&mdash;the more they assume
the usual characteristics of a dream; contradictory, illogical,
even in the marvels they represent. Can any two persons be more
totally unlike each other, not merely as to form and years, but as
to all the elements of character, than the Grayle of whom you read,
or believe you read, and the Margrave in whom you evidently think
that Grayle is existent still? The one represented, you say, as
gloomy, saturnine, with vehement passions, but with an original
grandeur of thought and will, consumed by an internal remorse; the
other you paint to me as a joyous and wayward darling of Nature,
acute yet frivolous, free from even the ordinary passions of youth,
taking delight in innocent amusements, incapable of continuous
study, without a single pang of repentance for the crimes you so
fancifully impute to him. And now, when your suspicions, so
romantically conceived, are dispelled by positive facts, now, when
it is clear that Margrave neither murdered Sir Philip Derval nor
abstracted the memoir, you still, unconsciously to yourself, draw
on your imagination in order to excuse the suspicion your pride of
intellect declines to banish, and suppose that this youthful
sorcerer tempted the madman to the murder, the woman to the
theft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you forget the madman said 'that he was led on by the
Luminous Shadow of a beautiful youth,' that the woman said also
that she was impelled by some mysterious agency."</p>

<p>"I do not forget those coincidences; but how your learning would
dismiss them as nugatory were your imagination not disposed to
exaggerate them! When you read the authentic histories of any
popular illusion, such as the spurious inspirations of the
Jansenist Convulsionaries, the apparitions that invaded convents,
as deposed in the trial of Urbain Grandier, the confessions of
witches and wizards in places the most remote from each other, or,
at this day, the tales of 'spirit-manifestation' recorded in half
the towns and villages of America,&mdash;do not all the
superstitious impressions of a particular time have a common family
likeness? What one sees, another sees, though there has been no
communication between the two. I cannot tell you why these
phantasms thus partake of the nature of an atmospheric epidemic;
the fact remains incontestable. And strange as may be the
coincidence between your impressions of a mystic agency and those
of some other brains not cognizant of the chimeras of your own,
still, is it not simpler philosophy to say, 'They are coincidences
of the same nature which made witches in the same epoch all tell
much the same story of the broomsticks they rode and the sabbats at
which they danced to the fiend's piping,' and there leave the
matter, as in science we must leave many of the most elementary and
familiar phenomena inexplicable as to their causes,&mdash;is not
this, I say, more philosophical than to insist upon an explanation
which accepts the supernatural rather than leave the extraordinary
unaccounted for?"</p>

<p>"As you speak," said I, resting my downcast face upon my hand,
"I should speak to any patient who had confided to me the tale I
have told to you."</p>

<p>"And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy you? Very
likely: to some phenomena there is, as yet, no explanation. Perhaps
Newton himself could not explain quite to his own satisfaction why
he was haunted at midnight by the spectrum of a sun; though I have
no doubt that some later philosopher whose ingenuity has been
stimulated by Newton's account, has, by this time, suggested a
rational solution of that enigma.(8) To return to your own case. I
have offered such interpretations of the mysteries that confound
you as appear to me authorized by physiological science. Should you
adduce other facts which physiological science wants the data to
resolve into phenomena always natural, however rare, still hold
fast to that simple saying of Goethe: 'Mysteries are not
necessarily miracles.' And if all which physiological science
comprehends in its experience wholly fails us, I may then hazard
certain conjectures in which, by acknowledging ignorance, one is
compelled to recognize the Marvellous (for as where knowledge
enters, the Marvellous recedes, so where knowledge falters, the
Marvellous advances); yet still, even in those conjectures, I will
distinguish the Marvellous from the Supernatural. But, for the
present, I advise you to accept the guess that may best quiet the
fevered imagination which any bolder guess would only more
excite."</p>

<p>"You are right," said I, rising proudly to the full height of my
stature, my head erect and my heart defying. "And so let this
subject be renewed no more between us. I will brood over it no more
myself. I regain the unclouded realm of my human intelligence; and,
in that intelligence, I mock the sorcerer and disdain the
spectre."</p>

<p>This author, not more to be admired for his intelligence than
his candour, and who is entitled to praise for a higher degree of
original thought than that to which he modestly pretends, relates a
curious anecdote illustrating "the analogy between dreaming and
spectral illusion, which he received from the gentleman to which it
occurred,&mdash;an eminent medical friend:" "Having sat up late one
evening, under considerable anxiety for one of his children, who
was ill, he fell asleep in his chair, and had a frightful dream, in
which the prominent figure was an immense baboon. He awoke with the
fright, got up instantly, and walked to a table which was in the
middle of the room. He was then quite awake, and quite conscious of
the articles around him; but close by the wall in the end of the
apartment he distinctly saw the baboon making the same grimaces
which he had seen in his dreams; and this spectre continued visible
for about half a minute." Now, a man who saw only a baboon would be
quite ready to admit that it was but an optical illusion; but if,
instead of a baboon, he had seen an intimate friend, and that
friend, by some coincidence of time, had died about that date, he
would be a very strong-minded man if he admitted for the mystery of
seeing his friend the same natural solution which he would readily
admit for seeing a baboon.</p>

<p>(6) See Muller's observations on this phenomenon, "Physiology of
the Senses," Baley's translation, p. 1395.</p>

<p>(7) Sir David Brewster's Letters on Natural Magic, p. 39.</p>

<p>(8) Newton's explanation is as follows: "This story I tell you
to let you understand, that in the observation related by Mr.
Boyle, the man's fancy probably concurred with the impression made
by the sun's light to produce that phantasm of the sun which he
constantly saw in bright objects, and so your question about the
cause of this phantasm involves another about the power of the
fancy, which I must confess is too hard a knot for me to untie. To
place this effect in a constant motion is hard, because the sun
ought then to appear perpetually. It seems rather to consist in a
disposition of the sensorium to move the imagination strongly, and
to be easily moved both by the imagination and by the light as
often as bright objects are looked upon."&mdash;Letter from Sir I.
Newton to Locke, Lord Kinq's Life of Locke, vol. i. pp.
405-408.</p>

<p>Dr. Roget (Animal and Vegetable Physiology considered with
reference to Natural Theology, "Bridgewater Treatise," pp. 524,
525) thus refers to this phenomenon, which he states "all of us may
experience ":&mdash;</p>

<p>"When the impressions are very vivid" (Dr. Roget is speaking of
visual impressions), "another phenomenon often takes
place,&mdash;namely, their <i>subsequent recurrence after a certain
interval, during which they are not felt, and quite independently
of any renewed application of the cause which had originally
excited them."</i> (I mark by italics the words which more
precisely coincide with Julius Faber's explanations.) "If, for
example, we look steadfastly at the sun for a second or two, and
then immediately close our eyes, the image, or spectrum, of the sun
remains for a long time present to the mind, as if the light were
still acting on the retina. It then gradually fades and disappears;
but if we continue to keep the eyes shut, the same impression will,
after a certain time, recur, and again vanish: and this phenomenon
will be repeated at intervals, the sensation becoming fainter at
each renewal. It is probable that these reappearances of the image,
after the light which produced the original impression has been
withdrawn, are occasioned by spontaneous affections of the retina
itself which are conveyed to the sensorium. In other cases, where
the impressions are less strong, the physical changes producing
these changes are perhaps confined to the sensorium."</p>

<p>It may be said that there is this difference between the
spectrum of the sun and such a phantom as that which perplexed
Allen Fenwick,&mdash;namely, that the sun has been actually beheld
before its visionary appearance can be reproduced, and that Allen
Fenwick only imagines he has seen the apparition which repeats
itself to his fancy. "But there are grounds for the suspicion"
(says Dr. Hibbert, "Philosophy of Apparitions," p. 250), "that when
ideas of vision are vivified to the height of sensation, a
corresponding affection of the optic nerve accompanies the
illusion." Muller ("Physiology of the Senses," p. 1392, Baley's
translation) states the same opinion still more strongly; and Sir
David Brewster, quoted by Dr. Hibbert (p. 251) says: "In examining
these mental impressions, I have found that they follow the motions
of the eyeball exactly like the spectral impressions of luminous
objects, and that they resemble them also in their apparent
immobility when the eye is displaced by an external force. If this
result (which I state with much diffidence, from having only my own
experience in its favour) shall be found generally true by others,
it will follow that the objects of mental contemplation may be seen
as distinctly as external objects, and will occupy the same local
position in the axis of vision, as if they had been formed by the
agency of light." Hence the impression of an image once conveyed to
the senses, no matter how, whether by actual or illusory vision, is
liable to renewal, "independently of any renewed application of the
cause which had originally excited it," and the image can be seen
in that renewal "as distinctly as external objects," for indeed
"the revival of the fantastic figure really does affect those
points of the retina which had been previously impressed."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>

<p>Julius Faber and Amy Lloyd stayed in my house three days, I and
in their presence I felt a healthful sense of security and peace.
Amy wished to visit her father's house, and I asked Faber, in
taking her there, to seize the occasion to see Lilian, that he
might communicate to me his impression of a case so peculiar. I
prepared Mrs. Ashleigh for this visit by a previous note. When the
old man and the child came back, both brought me comfort. Amy was
charmed with Lilian, who had received her with the sweetness
natural to her real character, and I loved to hear Lilian's praise
from those innocent lips.</p>

<p>Faber's report was still more calculated to console me.</p>

<p>"I have seen, I have conversed with her long and familiarly. You
were quite right,&mdash;there is no tendency to consumption in that
exquisite, if delicate, organization; nor do I see cause for the
fear to which your statement had pre-inclined me. That head is too
nobly formed for any constitutional cerebral infirmity. In its
organization, ideality, wonder, veneration, are large, it is true,
but they are balanced by other organs, now perhaps almost dormant,
but which will come into play as life passes from romance into
duty. Something at this moment evidently oppresses her mind. In
conversing with her, I observe abstraction, listlessness; but I am
so convinced of her truthfulness, that if she has once told you she
returned your affection, and pledged to you her faith, I should, in
your place, rest perfectly satisfied that whatever be the cloud
that now rests on her imagination, and for the time obscures the
idea of yourself, it will pass away."</p>

<p>Faber was a believer in the main divisions of phrenology, though
he did not accept all the dogmas of Gall and Spurzheim; while, to
my mind, the refutation of phrenology in its fundamental
propositions had been triumphantly established by the lucid
arguments of Sir W. Hamilton.(1) But when Faber rested on
phrenological observations assurances in honour of Lilian, I forgot
Sir W. Hamilton, and believed in phrenology. As iron girders and
pillars expand and contract with the mere variations of
temperature, so will the strongest conviction on which the human
intellect rests its judgment vary with the changes of the human
heart; and the building is only safe where these variations are
foreseen and allowed for by a wisdom intent on
self-knowledge.(2)</p>

<p>There was much in the affection that had sprung up between
Julius Faber and Amy Lloyd which touched my heart and softened all
its emotions. This man, unblessed, like myself, by conjugal and
parental ties, had, in his solitary age, turned for solace to the
love of a child, as I, in the pride of manhood, had turned to the
love of woman. But his love was without fear, without jealousy,
without trouble. My sunshine came to me in a fitful ray, through
clouds that had gathered over my noon; his sunshine covered all his
landscape, hallowed and hallowing by the calm of declining day.</p>

<p>And Amy was no common child. She had no exuberant imagination;
she was haunted by no whispers from Afar; she was a creature fitted
for the earth,&mdash;to accept its duties and to gladden its cares.
Her tender observation, fine and tranquil, was alive to all the
important household trifles by which, at the earliest age, man's
allotted soother asserts her privilege to tend and to comfort. It
was pleasant to see her moving so noiselessly through the rooms I
had devoted to her venerable protector, knowing all his simple
wants, and providing for them as if by the mechanism of a heart
exquisitely moulded to the loving uses of life. Sometimes when I
saw her setting his chair by the window (knowing, as I did, how
much he habitually loved to be near the light) and smoothing his
papers (in which he was apt to be unmethodical), placing the mark
in his book when he ceased to read, divining, almost without his
glance, some wish passing through his mind, and then seating
herself at his feet, often with her work&mdash;which was always
destined for him or for one of her absent brothers,&mdash;now and
then with the one small book that she had carried with her, a
selection of Bible stories compiled for children,&mdash;sometimes
when I saw her thus, how I wished that Lilian, too, could have seen
her, and have compared her own ideal fantasies with those young
developments of the natural heavenly Woman!</p>

<p>But was there nothing in that sight from which I, proud of my
arid reason even in its perplexities, might have taken lessons for
myself?</p>

<p>On the second evening of Faber's visit I brought to him the
draft of deeds for the sale of his property. He had never been a
man of business out of his profession; he was impatient to sell his
property, and disposed to accept an offer at half its value. I
insisted on taking on myself the task of negotiator; perhaps, too,
in this office I was egotistically anxious to prove to the great
physician that which he believed to be my "hallucination" had in no
way obscured my commonsense in the daily affairs of life. So I
concluded, and in a few hours, terms for his property that were
only just, but were infinitely more advantageous than had appeared
to himself to be possible. But as I approached him with the papers,
he put his finger to his lips. Amy was standing by him with her
little book in her hand, and his own Bible lay open on the table.
He was reading to her from the Sacred Volume itself, and impressing
on her the force and beauty of one of the Parables, the adaptation
of which had perplexed her; when he had done, she kissed him, bade
him goodnight, and went away to rest. Then said Faber thoughtfully,
and as if to himself more than me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a lovely bridge between old age and childhood is religion!
How intuitively the child begins with prayer and worship on
entering life, and how intuitively on quitting life the old man
turns back to prayer and worship, putting himself again side by
side with the infant!"</p>

<p>I made no answer, but, after a pause, spoke of fines and
freeholds, title-deeds and money; and when the business on hand was
concluded, asked my learned guest if, before he departed, he would
deign to look over the pages of my ambitious Physiological Work.
There were parts of it on which I much desired his opinion,
touching on subjects in which his special studies made him an
authority as high as our land possessed.</p>

<p>He made me bring him the manuscript, and devoted much of that
night and the next day to its perusal.</p>

<p>When he gave it me back, which was not till the morning of his
departure, he commenced with eulogies on the scope of its design,
and the manner of its execution, which flattered my vanity so much
that I could not help exclaiming, "Then, at least, there is no
trace of 'hallucination' here!"</p>

<p>"Alas, my poor Allen! here, perhaps, hallucination, or
self-deception, is more apparent than in all the strange tales you
confided to me. For here is the hallucination of the man seated on
the shores of Nature, and who would say to its measureless sea, 'So
far shalt thou go and no farther;' here is the hallucination of the
creature, who, not content with exploring the laws of the Creator,
ends with submitting to his interpretation of some three or four
laws, in the midst of a code of which all the rest are in a
language unknown to him, the powers and free-will of the Lawgiver
Himself; here is the hallucination by which Nature is left Godless,
because Man is left soulless. What would matter all our
speculations on a Deity who would cease to exist for us when we are
in the grave? Why mete out, like Archytas, the earth and the sea,
and number the sands on the shore that divides them, if the end of
this wisdom be a handful of dust sprinkled over a skull!</p>

<p>"Your book is a proof of the soul that you fail to discover.
Without a soul, no man would work for a Future that begins for his
fame when the breath is gone from his body. Do you remember how you
saw that little child praying at the grave of her father? Shall I
tell you that in her simple orisons she prayed for the
benefactor,&mdash;who had cared for the orphan; who had reared over
dust that tomb which, in a Christian burial-ground, is a mute but
perceptible memorial of Christian hopes; that the child prayed,
haughty man, for you? And you sat by, knowing nought of this; sat
by, amongst the graves, troubled and tortured with ghastly doubts,
vain of a reason that was sceptical of eternity, and yet shaken
like a reed by a moment's marvel. Shall I tell the child to pray
for you no more; that you disbelieve in a soul? If you do so, what
is the efficacy of prayer? Speak, shall I tell her this? Shall the
infant pray for you never more?"</p>

<p>I was silent; I was thrilled.</p>

<p>"Has it never occurred to you, who, in denying all innate
perceptions as well as ideas, have passed on to deductions from
which poor Locke, humble Christian that he was, would have shrunk
in dismay,&mdash;has it never occurred to you as a wonderful fact,
that the easiest thing in the world to teach a child is that which
seems to metaphysical schoolmen the abstrusest of all problems?
Read all those philosophers wrangling about a First Cause, deciding
on what are miracles, and then again deciding that such miracles
cannot be; and when one has answered another, and left in the
crucible of wisdom a caput mortuum of ignorance, then turn your
eyes, and look at the infant praying to the invisible God at his
mother's knees. This idea, so miraculously abstract, of a Power the
infant has never seen, that cannot be symbolled forth and explained
to him by the most erudite sage,&mdash;a Power, nevertheless, that
watches over him, that hears him, that sees him, that will carry
him across the grave, that will enable him to live on
forever,&mdash;this double mystery of a Divinity and of a Soul, the
infant learns with the most facile readiness, at the first glimpse
of his reasoning faculty. Before you can teach him a rule in
addition, before you can venture to drill him into his horn-book,
he leaps, with one intuitive spring of all his ideas, to the
comprehension of the truths which are only incomprehensible to
blundering sages! And you, as you stand before me, dare not say,
'Let the child pray for me no more!' But will the Creator accept
the child's prayer for the man who refuses prayer for himself? Take
my advice, pray! And in this counsel I do not overstep my province.
I speak not as a preacher, but as a physician. For health is a word
that comprehends our whole organization, and a just equilibrium of
all faculties and functions is the condition of health. As in your
Lilian the equilibrium is deranged by the over-indulgence of a
spiritual mysticism which withdraws from the nutriment of duty the
essential pabulum of sober sense, so in you the resolute negation
of disciplined spiritual communion between Thought and Divinity
robs imagination of its noblest and safest vent. Thus, from
opposite extremes, you and your Lilian meet in the same region of
mist and cloud, losing sight of each other and of the true ends of
life, as her eyes only gaze on the stars and yours only bend to the
earth. Were I advising her, I should say: 'Your Creator has placed
the scene of your trial below, and not in the stars.' Advising you,
I say: 'But in the trial below, man should recognize education for
heaven.' In a word, I would draw somewhat more downward her fancy,
raise somewhat more upward your reason. Take my advice
then,&mdash;Pray. Your mental system needs the support of prayer in
order to preserve its balance. In the embarrassment and confusion
of your senses, clearness of perception will come with habitual and
tranquil confidence in Him who alike rules the universe and reads
the heart. I only say here what has been said much better before by
a reasoner in whom all Students of Nature recognize a guide. I see
on your table the very volume of Bacon which contains the passage I
commend to your reflection. Here it is. Listen: 'Take an example of
a dog, and mark what a generosity and courage he will put on when
he finds himself maintained by a man who, to him, is instead of a
God, or melior natura, which courage is manifestly such as that
creature, without that confidence of a better nature than his own,
could never attain. So man, when he resteth and assureth himself
upon Divine protection and favour, gathereth a force and faith
which human nature could not obtain.'(3) You are silent, but your
gesture tells me your doubt,&mdash;a doubt which your heart, so
femininely tender, will not speak aloud lest you should rob the old
man of a hope with which your strength of manhood
dispenses,&mdash;you doubt the efficacy of prayer! Pause and
reflect, bold but candid inquirer into the laws of that guide you
call Nature. If there were no efficacy in prayer; if prayer were as
mere an illusion of superstitious fantasy as aught against which
your reason now struggles, do you think that Nature herself would
have made it amongst the most common and facile of all her
dictates? Do you believe that if there really did not exist that
tie between Man and his Maker&mdash;that link between life here and
life hereafter which is found in what we call Soul alone&mdash;that
wherever you look through the universe, you would behold a child at
Prayer? Nature inculcates nothing that is superfluous. Nature does
not impel the leviathan or the lion, the eagle or the moth, to
pray; she impels only man. Why? Because man only has soul, and Soul
seeks to commune with the Everlasting, as a fountain struggles up
to its source. Burn your book. It would found you a reputation for
learning and intellect and courage, I allow; but learning and
intellect and courage wasted against a truth, like spray against a
rock! A truth valuable to the world, the world will never part
with. You will not injure the truth, but you will mislead and may
destroy many, whose best security is in the truth which you so
eruditely insinuate to be a fable. Soul and Hereafter are the
heritage of all men; the humblest, journeyman in those streets, the
pettiest trader behind those counters, have in those beliefs their
prerogatives of royalty. You would dethrone and embrute the lords
of the earth by your theories. For my part, having given the
greater part of my life to the study and analysis of facts, I would
rather be the author of the tritest homily, or the baldest poem,
that inculcated that imperishable essence of the soul to which I
have neither scalpel nor probe, than be the founder of the subtlest
school, or the framer of the loftiest verse, that robbed my
fellow-men of their faith in a spirit that eludes the
dissecting-knife,&mdash;in a being that escapes the grave-digger.
Burn your book! Accept This Book instead; Read and Pray."</p>

<p>He placed his Bible in my hand, embraced me, and, an hour
afterwards, the old man and the child left my hearth solitary once
more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>

<p>That night, as I sat in my study, very thoughtful and very
mournful, I resolved all that Julius Faber had said; and the
impression his words had produced became gradually weaker and
weaker, as my reason, naturally combative, rose up with all the
replies which my philosophy suggested. No; if my imagination had
really seduced and betrayed me into monstrous credulities, it was
clear that the best remedy to such morbid tendencies towards the
Superstitious was in the severe exercise of the faculties most
opposed to Superstition,&mdash;in the culture of pure reasoning, in
the science of absolute fact. Accordingly, I placed before me the
very book which Julius Faber had advised me to burn; I forced all
my powers of mind to go again over the passages which contained the
doctrines that his admonition had censured; and before daybreak, I
had stated the substance of his argument, and the logical reply to
it, in an elaborate addition to my chapter on "Sentimental
Philosophers." While thus rejecting the purport of his parting
counsels, I embodied in another portion of my work his views on my
own "illusions;" and as here my commonsense was in concord with
his, I disposed of all my own previous doubts in an addition to my
favourite chapter "On the Cheats of the Imagination." And when the
pen dropped from my hand, and the day-star gleamed through the
window, my heart escaped from the labour of my mind, and flew back
to the image of Lilian. The pride of the philosopher died out of
me, the sorrow of the man reigned supreme, and I shrank from the
coming of the sun, despondent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>

<p>Not till the law had completed its proceedings, and satisfied
the public mind as to the murder of Sir Philip Derval, were the
remains of the deceased consigned to the family mausoleum. The
funeral was, as may be supposed, strictly private, and when it was
over, the excitement caused by an event so tragical and singular
subsided. New topics engaged the public talk, and&mdash;in my
presence, at least&mdash;the delicate consideration due to one
whose name had been so painfully mixed up in the dismal story
forbore a topic which I could not be expected to hear without
distressful emotion. Mrs. Ashleigh I saw frequently at my own
house; she honestly confessed that Lilian had not shown that grief
at the cancelling of our engagement which would alone justify Mrs.
Ashleigh in asking me again to see her daughter, and retract my
conclusions against our union. She said that Lilian was quiet, not
uncheerful, never spoke of me nor of Margrave, but seemed absent
and pre-occupied as before, taking pleasure in nothing that had
been wont to please her; not in music, nor books, nor that tranquil
pastime which women call work, and in which they find excuse to
meditate, in idleness, their own fancies. She rarely stirred out,
even in the garden; when she did, her eyes seemed to avoid the
house in which Margrave had lodged, and her steps the old favourite
haunt by the Monks' Well. She would remain silent for long hours
together, but the silence did not appear melancholy. For the rest,
her health was more than usually good. Still Mrs. Ashleigh
persisted in her belief that, sooner or later, Lilian would return
to her former self, her former sentiments for me; and she entreated
me not, as yet, to let the world know that our engagement was
broken off. "For if," she said, with good sense, "if it should
prove not to be broken off, only suspended, and afterwards happily
renewed, there will be two stories to tell when no story be needed.
Besides, I should dread the effect on Lilian, if offensive gossips
babbled to her on a matter that would excite so much curiosity as
the rupture of a union in which our neighbours have taken so
general an interest."</p>

<p>I had no reason to refuse acquiescence in Mrs. Ashleigh's
request, but I did not share in her hopes; I felt that the fair
prospects of my life were blasted; I could never love another,
never wed another; I resigned myself to a solitary hearth,
rejoiced, at least, that Margrave had not revisited at Mrs.
Ashleigh's,&mdash;had not, indeed, reappeared in the town. He was
still staying with Strahan, who told me that his guest had
ensconced himself in Forman's old study, and amused himself with
reading&mdash;though not for long at a time&mdash;the curious old
books and manuscripts found in the library, or climbing trees like
a schoolboy, and familiarizing himself with the deer and the
cattle, which would group round him quite tame, and feed from his
hand. Was this the description of a criminal? But if Sir Philip's
assertion were really true; if the criminal were man without soul;
if without soul, man would have no conscience, never be troubled by
repentance, and the vague dread of a future world,&mdash;why, then,
should not the criminal be gay despite his crimes, as the white
bear gambols as friskly after his meal on human flesh? These
questions would haunt me, despite my determination to accept as the
right solution of all marvels the construction put on my narrative
by Julius Faber.</p>

<p>Days passed; I saw and heard nothing of Margrave. I began half
to hope that, in the desultory and rapid changes of mood and mind
which characterized his restless nature, he had forgotten my
existence.</p>

<p>One morning I went out early on my rounds, when I met Straban
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"I was in search of you," he said, "for more than one person has
told me that you are looking ill and jaded. So you are! And the
town now is hot and unhealthy. You must come to Derval Court for a
week or so. You can ride into town every day to see your patients.
Don't refuse. Margrave, who is still with me, sends all kind
messages, and bade me say that he entreats you to come to the house
at which he also is a guest!"</p>

<p>I started. What had the Scin-Laeca required of me, and obtained
to that condition my promise? "If you are asked to the house at
which I also am a guest, you will come; you will meet and converse
with me as guest speaks to guest in the house of a host!" Was this
one of the coincidences which my reason was bound to accept as
coincidences, and nothing more? Tut, tut! Was I returning again to
my "hallucinations"? Granting that Faber and common-sense were in
the right, what was this Margrave? A man to whose friendship,
acuteness, and energy I was under the deepest obligations,&mdash;to
whom I was indebted for active services that had saved my life from
a serious danger, acquitted my honour of a horrible suspicion. "I
thank you," I said to Strahan, "I will come; not, indeed, for a
week, but, at all events, for a day or two."</p>

<p>"That's right; I will call for you in the carriage at six
o'clock. You will have done your day's work by then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I will so arrange."</p>

<p>On our way to Derval Court that evening, Strahan talked much
about Margrave, of whom, nevertheless, he seemed to be growing
weary.</p>

<p>"His high spirits are too much for one," said he; "and then so
restless,&mdash;so incapable of sustained quiet conversation. And,
clever though he is, he can't help me in the least about the new
house I shall build. He has no notion of construction. I don't
think he could build a barn."</p>

<p>"I thought you did not like to demolish the old house, and would
content yourself with pulling down the more ancient part of
it?"</p>

<p>"True. At first it seemed a pity to destroy so handsome a
mansion; but you see, since poor Sir Philip's manuscript, on which
he set such store, has been too mutilated, I fear, to allow me to
effect his wish with regard to it, I think I ought at least
scrupulously to obey his other whims. And, besides, I don't know,
there are odd noises about the old house. I don't believe in
haunted houses; still there is something dreary in strange sounds
at the dead of night, even if made by rats, or winds through
decaying rafters. You, I remember at college, had a taste for
architecture, and can draw plans. I wish to follow out Sir Philip's
design, but on a smaller scale, and with more attention to
comfort."</p>

<p>Thus he continued to run on, satisfied to find me a silent and
attentive listener. We arrived at the mansion an hour before
sunset, the westering light shining full against the many windows
cased in mouldering pilasters, and making the general dilapidation
of the old place yet more mournfully evident.</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes to the dinner-hour. I went up at once
to the room appropriated to me,&mdash;not the one I had before
occupied. Strahan had already got together a new establishment. I
was glad to find in the servant who attended me an old
acquaintance. He had been in my own employ when I first settled at
L&mdash;&mdash;, and left me to get married. He and his wife were
now both in Strahan's service. He spoke warmly of his new master
and his contentment with his situation, while he unpacked my
carpet-bag and assisted me to change my dress. But the chief object
of his talk and his praise was Mr. Margrave.</p>

<p>"Such a bright young gentleman, like the first fine day in
May!"</p>

<p>When I entered the drawing-room, Margrave and Strahan were both
there. The former was blithe and genial, as usual, in his welcome.
At dinner, and during the whole evening till we retired severally
to our own rooms, he was the principal talker,&mdash;recounting
incidents of travel, always very loosely strung together, jesting,
good-humouredly enough, at Strahan's sudden hobby for building,
then putting questions to me about mutual acquaintances, but never
waiting for an answer; and every now and then, as if at random,
startling us with some brilliant aphorism, or some suggestion drawn
from abstract science or unfamiliar erudition. The whole effect was
sparkling, but I could well understand that, if long continued, it
would become oppressive. The soul has need of pauses of
repose,&mdash;intervals of escape, not only from the flesh, but
even from the mind. A man of the loftiest intellect will experience
times when mere intellect not only fatigues him, but amidst its
most original conceptions, amidst its proudest triumphs, has a
something trite and commonplace compared with one of those vague
intimations of a spiritual destiny which are not within the
ordinary domain of reason; and, gazing abstractedly into space,
will leave suspended some problem of severest thought, or
uncompleted some golden palace of imperial poetry, to indulge in
hazy reveries, that do not differ from those of an innocent, quiet
child! The soul has a long road to travel&mdash;from time through
eternity. It demands its halting hours of contemplation.
Contemplation is serene. But with such wants of an immortal
immaterial spirit, Margrave had no fellowship, no sympathy; and for
myself, I need scarcely add that the lines I have just traced I
should not have written at the date at which my narrative has now
arrived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>

<p>I had no case that necessitated my return to L&mdash;&mdash; the
following day. The earlier hours of the forenoon I devoted to
Strahan and his building plans. Margrave flitted in and out of the
room fitfully as an April sunbeam, sometimes flinging himself on a
sofa, and reading for a few minutes one of the volumes of the
ancient mystics, in which Sir Philip's library was so rich. I
remember it was a volume of Proclus. He read that crabbed and
difficult Greek with a fluency that surprised me. "I picked up the
ancient Greek," said he, "years ago, in learning the modern." But
the book soon tired him; then he would come and disturb us, archly
enjoying Strahan's peevishness at interruption; then he would throw
open the window and leap down, chanting one of his wild savage
airs; and in another moment he was half hid under the drooping
boughs of a broad lime-tree, amidst the antlers of deer that
gathered fondly round him. In the afternoon my host was called away
to attend some visitors of importance, and I found myself on the
sward before the house, right in view of the mausoleum and alone
with Margrave.</p>

<p>I turned my eyes from that dumb House of Death wherein rested
the corpse of the last lord of the soil, so strangely murdered,
with a strong desire to speak out to Margrave the doubts respecting
himself that tortured me. But&mdash;setting aside the promise to
the contrary, which I had given, or dreamed I had given, to the
Luminous Shadow&mdash;to fulfil that desire would have been
impossible,&mdash;impossible to any one gazing on that radiant
youthful face! I think I see him now as I saw him then: a white
doe, that even my presence could not scare away from him, clung
lovingly to his side, looking up at him with her soft eyes. He
stood there like the incarnate principle of mythological sensuous
life. I have before applied to him that illustration; let the
repetition be pardoned. Impossible, I repeat it, to say to that
creature, face to face, "Art thou the master of demoniac arts, and
the instigator of secret murder?" As if from redundant happiness
within himself, he was humming, or rather cooing, a strain of
music, so sweet, so wildly sweet, and so unlike the music one hears
from tutored lips in crowded rooms! I passed my hand over my
forehead in bewilderment and awe.</p>

<p>"Are there," I said unconsciously,&mdash;"are there, indeed,
such prodigies in Nature?"</p>

<p>"Nature!" he cried, catching up the word; "talk to me of Nature!
Talk of her, the wondrous blissful mother! Mother I may well call
her. I am her spoiled child, her darling! But oh, to die, ever to
die, ever to lose sight of Nature!&mdash;to rot senseless, whether
under these turfs or within those dead walls&mdash;"</p>

<p>I could not resist the answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Like yon murdered man! murdered, and by whom?"</p>

<p>"By whom? I thought that was clearly proved."</p>

<p>"The hand was proved; what influence moved the hand?"</p>

<p>"Tush! the poor wretch spoke of a Demon. Who can tell? Nature
herself is a grand destroyer. See that pretty bird, in its beak a
writhing worm! All Nature's children live to take life; none,
indeed, so lavishly as man. What hecatombs slaughtered, not to
satisfy the irresistible sting of hunger, but for the wanton
ostentation of a feast, which he may scarcely taste, or for the
mere sport that he finds in destroying! We speak with dread of the
beasts of prey: what beast of prey is so dire a ravager as
man,&mdash;so cruel and so treacherous? Look at yon flock of sheep,
bred and fattened for the shambles; and this hind that I
caress,&mdash;if I were the park-keeper, and her time for my bullet
had come, would you think her life was the safer because, in my own
idle whim, I had tamed her to trust to the hand raised to slay
her?"</p>

<p>"It is true," said I,&mdash;"a grim truth. Nature, on the
surface so loving and so gentle, is full of terror in her deeps
when our thought descends into their abyss!"</p>

<p>Strahan now joined us with a party of country visitors.
"Margrave is the man to show you the beauties of this park," said
he. "Margrave knows every bosk and dingle, twisted old thorn-tree,
or opening glade, in its intricate, undulating ground."</p>

<p>Margrave seemed delighted at this proposition; and as he led us
through the park, though the way was long, though the sun was
fierce, no one seemed fatigued. For the pleasure he felt in
pointing out detached beauties which escaped an ordinary eye was
contagious. He did not talk as talks the poet or the painter; but
at some lovely effect of light amongst the tremulous leaves, some
sudden glimpse of a sportive rivulet below, he would halt, point it
out to us in silence, and with a kind of childlike ecstasy in his
own bright face, that seemed to reflect the life and the bliss of
the blithe summer day itself.</p>

<p>Thus seen, all my doubts in his dark secret nature faded
away,&mdash;all my horror, all my hate; it was impossible to resist
the charm that breathed round him, not to feel a tender,
affectionate yearning towards him as to some fair happy child. Well
might he call himself the Darling of Nature. Was he not the
mysterious likeness of that awful Mother, beautiful as Apollo in
one aspect, direful as Typhon in another?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>

<p>"What a strange-looking cane you have, sir!" said a little girl,
who was one of the party, and who had entwined her arm round
Margrave's. "Let me look at it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Strahan, "that cane, or rather walking-staff, is
worth looking at. Margrave bought it in Egypt, and declares that it
is very ancient."</p>

<p>This staff seemed constructed from a reed: looked at, it seemed
light, in the hand it felt heavy; it was of a pale, faded yellow,
wrought with black rings at equal distances, and graven with half
obliterated characters that seemed hieroglyphic. I remembered to
have seen Margrave with it before, but I had never noticed it with
any attention until now, when it was passed from hand to hand. At
the head of the cane there was a large unpolished stone of a dark
blue.</p>

<p>"Is this a pebble or a jewel?" asked one of the party.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you its name or nature," said Margrave; "but it
is said to cure the bite of serpents(1), and has other supposed
virtues,&mdash;a talisman, in short."</p>

<p>He here placed the staff in my hands, and bade me look at it
with care. Then he changed the conversation and renewed the way,
leaving the staff with me, till suddenly I forced it back on him. I
could not have explained why, but its touch, as it warmed in my
clasp, seemed to send through my whole frame a singular thrill, and
a sensation as if I no longer felt my own weight,&mdash;as if I
walked on air.</p>

<p>Our rambles came to a close; the visitors went away; I
re-entered the house through the sash-window of Forman's study.
Margrave threw his hat and staff on the table, and amused himself
with examining minutely the tracery on the mantelpiece. Strahan and
myself left him thus occupied, and, going into the adjoining
library, resumed our task of examining the plans for the new house.
I continued to draw outlines and sketches of various alterations,
tending to simplify and contract Sir Philip's general design.
Margrave soon joined us, and this time took his seat patiently
beside our table, watching me use ruler and compass with unwonted
attention.</p>

<p>"I wish I could draw," he said; "but I can do nothing
useful."</p>

<p>"Rich men like you," said Strahan, peevishly, "can engage
others, and are better employed in rewarding good artists than in
making bad drawings themselves."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can employ others; and&mdash;Fenwick, when you have
finished with Strahan I will ask permission to employ you, though
without reward; the task I would impose will not take you a
minute."</p>

<p>He then threw himself back in his chair, and seemed to fall into
a doze.</p>

<p>The dressing-bell rang; Strahan put away the
plans,&mdash;indeed, they were now pretty well finished and decided
on. Margrave woke up as our host left the room to dress, and
drawing me towards another table in the room, placed before me one
of his favourite mystic books, and, pointing to an old woodcut,
said,</p>

<p>"I will ask you to copy this for me; it pretends to be a
facsimile of Solomon's famous seal. I have a whimsical desire to
have a copy of it. You observe two triangles interlaced and
inserted in a circle?&mdash;the pentacle, in short. Yes, just so.
You need not add the astrological characters: they are the
senseless superfluous accessories of the dreamer who wrote the
book. But the pentacle itself has an intelligible meaning; it
belongs to the only universal language, the language of symbol, in
which all races that think&mdash;around, and above, and below
us&mdash;can establish communion of thought. If in the external
universe any one constructive principle can be detected, it is the
geometrical; and in every part of the world in which magic pretends
to a written character, I find that its hieroglyphics are
geometrical figures. Is it not laughable that the most positive of
all the sciences should thus lend its angles and circles to the use
of&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;the ignorance?&mdash;ay, that
is the word&mdash;the ignorance of dealers in magic?"</p>

<p>He took up the paper, on which I had hastily described the
triangles and the circle, and left the room, chanting the
serpent-charmer's song.</p>

<p>(1) The following description of a stone at Corfu, celebrated as
an antidote to the venom of the serpent's bite, was given to me by
an eminent scholar and legal functionary in that island:&mdash;</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION of THE BLUESTONE.&mdash;This stone is of an oval
shape 1 2/10 in. long, 7/10 broad, 3/10 thick, and, having been
broken formerly, is now set in gold.</p>

<p>When a person is bitten by a poisonous snake, the bite must be
opened by a cut of a lancet or razor longways, and the stone
applied within twenty-four hours. The stone then attaches itself
firmly on the wound, and when it has done its office falls off; the
cure is then complete. The stone must then be thrown into milk,
whereupon it vomits the poison it has absorbed, which remains green
on the top of the milk, and the stone is then again fit for
use.</p>

<p>This stone has been from time immemorial in the family of
Ventura, of Corfu, a house of Italian origin, and is notorious, so
that peasants immediately apply for its aid. Its virtue has not
been impaired by the fracture. Its nature or composition is
unknown.</p>

<p>In a case where two were stung at the same time by serpents, the
stone was applied to one, who recovered; but the other, for whom it
could not be used, died.</p>

<p>It never failed but once, and then it was applied after the
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Its colour is so dark as not to be distinguished from black.</p>

<p>Corfu, 7th Nov., 1860.</p>

<p>Sir Emerson Tennent, in his popular and excellent work on
Ceylon, gives an account of "snake stones" apparently similar to
the one at Corfu, except that they are "intensely black and highly
polished," and which are applied, in much the same manner, to the
wounds inflicted by the cobra-capella.</p>

<p>QUERY.-Might it not be worth while to ascertain the chemical
properties of these stones, and, if they be efficacious in the
extraction of venom conveyed by a bite, might they not be as
successful if applied to the bite of a mad dog as to that of a
cobra-capella?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>

<p>When we separated for the night, which we did at eleven o'clock,
Margrave said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-night and good-by. I must leave you to-morrow, Strahan,
and before your usual hour for rising. I took the liberty of
requesting one of your men to order me a chaise from
L&mdash;&mdash;. Pardon my seeming abruptness, but I always avoid
long leave-takings, and I had fixed the date of my departure almost
as soon as I accepted your invitation."</p>

<p>"I have no right to complain. The place must be dull indeed to a
gay young fellow like you. It is dull even to me. I am meditating
flight already. Are you going back to L&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Not even for such things as I left at my lodgings. When I
settle somewhere and can give an address, I shall direct them to be
sent to me. There are, I hear, beautiful patches of scenery towards
the north, only known to pedestrian tourists. I am a good walker;
and you know, Fenwick, that I am also a child of Nature. Adieu to
you both; and many thanks to you, Strahan, for your
hospitality."</p>

<p>He left the room.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry he is going," said Strahan, after a pause, and
with a quick breath as if of relief. "Do you not feel that he
exhausts one? An excess of oxygen, as you would say in a
lecture."</p>

<p>I was alone in my own chamber; I felt indisposed for bed and for
sleep; the curious conversation I had held with Margrave weighed on
me. In that conversation, we had indirectly touched upon the
prodigies which I had not brought myself to speak of with frank
courage, and certainly nothing in Margrave's manner had betrayed
consciousness of my suspicions; on the contrary, the open frankness
with which he evinced his predilection for mystic speculation, or
uttered his more unamiable sentiments, rather tended to disarm than
encourage belief in gloomy secrets or sinister powers. And as he
was about to quit the neighbourhood, he would not again see Lilian,
not even enter the town of L&mdash;&mdash;. Was I to ascribe this
relief from his presence to the promise of the Shadow; or was I not
rather right in battling firmly against any grotesque illusion, and
accepting his departure as a simple proof that my jealous fears had
been amongst my other chimeras, and that as he had really only
visited Lilian out of friendship to me, in my peril, so he might,
with his characteristic acuteness, have guessed my jealousy, and
ceased his visits from a kindly motive delicately concealed? And
might not the same motive now have dictated the words which were
intended to assure me that L&mdash;&mdash; contained no attractions
to tempt him to return to it? Thus, gradually soothed and cheered
by the course to which my reflections led me, I continued to muse
for hours. At length, looking at my watch, I was surprised to find
it was the second hour after midnight. I was just about to rise
from my chair to undress, and secure some hours of sleep, when the
well-remembered cold wind passed through the room, stirring the
roots of my hair; and before me stood, against the wall, the
Luminous Shadow.</p>

<p>"Rise and follow me," said the voice, sounding much nearer than
it had ever done before.</p>

<p>And at those words I rose mechanically, and like a
sleepwalker.</p>

<p>"Take up the light."</p>

<p>I took it. The Scin-Laeca glided along the wall towards the
threshold, and motioned me to open the door. I did so. The Shadow
flitted on through the corridor. I followed, with hushed footsteps,
down a small stair into Forman's study. In all my subsequent
proceedings, about to be narrated, the Shadow guided me, sometimes
by voice, sometimes by sign. I obeyed the guidance, not only
unresistingly, but without a desire to resist. I was unconscious
either of curiosity or of awe,&mdash;only of a calm and passive
indifference, neither pleasurable nor painful. In this obedience,
from which all will seemed extracted, I took into my hands the
staff which I had examined the day before, and which lay on the
table, just where Margrave had cast it on re-entering the house. I
unclosed the shutter to the casement, lifted the sash, and, with
the light in my left hand, the staff in my right, stepped forth
into the garden. The night was still; the flame of the candle
scarcely trembled in the air; the Shadow moved on before me towards
the old pavilion described in an earlier part of this narrative,
and of which the mouldering doors stood wide open. I followed the
Shadow into the pavilion, up the crazy stair to the room above,
with its four great blank unglazed windows, or rather arcades,
north, south, east, and west. I halted on the middle of the floor:
right before my eyes, through the vista made by breathless boughs,
stood out from the moonlit air the dreary mausoleum. Then, at the
command conveyed to me, I placed the candle on a wooden settle,
touched a spring in the handle of the staff; a lid flew back, and I
drew from the hollow, first a lump of some dark bituminous
substance, next a smaller slender wand of polished steel, of which
the point was tipped with a translucent material, which appeared to
me like crystal. Bending down, still obedient to the direction
conveyed to me, I described on the floor with the lump of bitumen
(if I may so call it) the figure of the pentacle with the
interlaced triangles, in a circle nine feet in diameter, just as I
had drawn it for Margrave the evening before. The material used
made the figure perceptible, in a dark colour of mingled black and
red. I applied the flame of the candle to the circle, and
immediately it became lambent with a low steady splendour that rose
about an inch from the floor; and gradually front this light there
emanated a soft, gray, transparent mist and a faint but exquisite
odour. I stood in the midst of the circle, and within the circle
also, close by my side, stood the Scin-Laeca,&mdash;no longer
reflected on the wall, but apart from it, erect, rounded into more
integral and distinct form, yet impalpable, and from it there
breathed an icy air. Then lifting the wand, the broader end of
which rested in the palm of my hand, the two forefingers closing
lightly over it in a line parallel with the point, I directed it
towards the wide aperture before me, fronting the mausoleum. I
repeated aloud some words whispered to me in a language I knew not:
those words I would not trace on this paper, could I remember them.
As they came to a close, I heard a howl from the watch-dog in the
yard,&mdash;a dismal, lugubrious howl. Other dogs in the distant
village caught up the sound, and bayed in a dirge-like chorus; and
the howling went on louder and louder. Again strange words were
whispered to me, and I repeated them in mechanical submission; and
when they, too, were ended, I felt the ground tremble beneath me,
and as my eyes looked straight forward down the vista, that,
stretching from the casement, was bounded by the solitary
mausoleum, vague formless shadows seemed to pass across the
moonlight,&mdash;below, along the sward, above, in the air; and
then suddenly a terror, not before conceived, came upon me.</p>

<p>And a third time words were whispered; but though I knew no more
of their meaning than I did of those that had preceded them, I felt
a repugnance to utter them aloud. Mutely I turned towards the
Scin-Laeca, and the expression of its face was menacing and
terrible; my will became yet more compelled to the control imposed
upon it, and my lips commenced the formula again whispered into my
ear, when I heard distinctly a voice of warning and of anguish,
that murmured "Hold!" I knew the voice; it was Lilian's. I paused;
I turned towards the quarter from which the voice had come, and in
the space afar I saw the features, the form of Lilian. Her arms
were stretched towards me in supplication, her countenance was
deadly pale, and anxious with unutterable distress. The whole image
seemed in unison with the voice,&mdash;the look, the attitude, the
gesture of one who sees another in deadly peril, and cries,
"Beware!"</p>

<p>This apparition vanished in a moment; but that moment sufficed
to free my mind from the constraint which had before enslaved it. I
dashed the wand to the ground, sprang from the circle, rushed from
the place. How I got into my own room I can remember not,&mdash;I
know not; I have a vague reminiscence of some intervening
wandering, of giant trees, of shroud-like moonlight, of the Shining
Shadow and its angry aspect, of the blind walls and the iron door
of the House of the Dead, of spectral images,&mdash;a confused and
dreary phantasmagoria. But all I can recall with distinctness is
the sight of my own hueless face in the mirror in my own still
room, by the light of the white moon through the window; and,
sinking down, I said to myself, "This, at least, is an
hallucination or a dream!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>

<p>A heavy sleep came over me at daybreak, but I did not undress
nor go to bed. The sun was high in the heavens when, on waking, I
saw the servant who had attended me bustling about the room.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, I am afraid I disturbed you; but I have
been three times to see if you were not coming down, and I found
you so soundly asleep I did not like to wake you. Mr. Strahan has
finished breakfast, and gone out riding; Mr. Margrave has
left,&mdash;left before six o'clock."</p>

<p>"Ah, he said he was going early."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and he seemed so cross when he went. I could never
have supposed so pleasant a gentleman could put himself into such a
passion!"</p>

<p>"What was the matter?"</p>

<p>"Why, his walking-stick could not be found; it was not in the
hall. He said he had left it in the study; we could not find it
there. At last he found it himself in the old summerhouse, and
said&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;he said he was sure you had taken it
there: that some one, at all events, had been meddling with it.
However, I am very glad it was found, since he seems to set such
store on it."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Margrave go himself into the summer-house to look for
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; no one else would have thought of such a place; no
one likes to go there, even in the daytime."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, they say it is haunted since poor Sir Philip's death;
and, indeed, there are strange noises in every part of the house. I
am afraid you had a bad night, sir," continued the servant, with
evident curiosity, glancing towards the bed, which I had not
pressed, and towards the evening-dress which, while he spoke, I was
rapidly changing for that which I habitually wore in the morning.
"I hope you did not feel yourself ill?"</p>

<p>"No! but it seems I fell asleep in my chair."</p>

<p>"Did you hear, sir, how the dogs howled about two o'clock in the
morning? They woke me. Very frightful!"</p>

<p>"The moon was at her full. Dogs will bay at the moon."</p>

<p>I felt relieved to think that I should not find Strahan in the
breakfast-room; and hastening through the ceremony of a meal which
I scarcely touched, I went out into the park unobserved, and
creeping round the copses and into the neglected gardens, made my
way to the pavilion. I mounted the stairs; I looked on the floor of
the upper room; yes, there still was the black figure of the
pentacle, the circle. So, then, it was not a dream! Till then I had
doubted. Or might it not still be so far a dream that I had walked
in my sleep, and with an imagination preoccupied by my
conversations with Margrave,&mdash;by the hieroglyphics on the
staff I had handled, by the very figure associated with
superstitious practices which I had copied from some weird book at
his request, by all the strange impressions previously stamped on
my mind,&mdash;might I not, in truth, have carried thither in sleep
the staff, described the circle, and all the rest been but
visionary delusion? Surely, surely, so common-sense, and so Julius
Faber would interpret the riddles that perplexed me! Be that as it
may, my first thought was to efface the marks on the floor. I found
this easier than I had ventured to hope. I rubbed the circle and
the pentacle away from the boards with the sole of my foot, leaving
but an undistinguishable smudge behind. I know not why, but I felt
the more nervously anxious to remove all such evidences of my
nocturnal visit to that room, because Margrave had so openly gone
thither to seek for the staff, and had so rudely named me to the
servant as having meddled with it. Might he not awake some
suspicion against me? Suspicion, what of? I knew not, but I
feared!</p>

<p>The healthful air of day gradually nerved my spirits and
relieved my thoughts. But the place had become hateful to me. I
resolved not to wait for Strahan's return, but to walk back to
L&mdash;&mdash;, and leave a message for my host. It was sufficient
excuse that I could not longer absent myself from my patients;
accordingly I gave directions to have the few things which I had
brought with me sent to my house by any servant who might be going
to L&mdash;&mdash;, and was soon pleased to find myself outside the
park-gates and on the high-road.</p>

<p>I had not gone a mile before I met Strahan on horseback. He
received my apologies for not waiting his return to bid him
farewell without observation, and, dismounting, led his horse and
walked beside me on my road. I saw that there was something on his
mind; at last he said, looking down,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you hear the dogs howl last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes! the full moon!"</p>

<p>"You were awake, then, at the time. Did you hear any other
sound? Did you see anything?"</p>

<p>"What should I hear or see?"</p>

<p>Strahan was silent for some moments; then he said, with great
seriousness,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I could not sleep when I went to bed last night; I felt
feverish and restless. Somehow or other, Margrave got into my head,
mixed up in some strange way with Sir Philip Derval. I heard the
dogs howl, and at the same time, or rather a few minutes later, I
felt the whole house tremble, as a frail corner-house in London
seems to tremble at night when a carriage is driven past it. The
howling had then ceased, and ceased as suddenly as it had begun. I
felt a vague, superstitious alarm; I got up, and went to my window,
which was unclosed (it is my habit to sleep with my windows open);
the moon was very bright, and I saw, I declare I saw along the
green alley that leads from the old part of the house to the
mausoleum&mdash;No, I will not say what I saw or believed I
saw,&mdash;you would ridicule me, and justly. But, whatever it
might be, on the earth without or in the fancy within my brain, I
was so terrified, that I rushed back to my bed, and buried my face
in my pillow. I would have come to you; but I did not dare to stir.
I have been riding hard all the morning in order to recover my
nerves. But I dread sleeping again under that roof, and now that
you and Margrave leave me, I shall go this very day to London. I
hope all that I have told you is no bad sign of any coming disease;
blood to the head, eh?"</p>

<p>"No; but imagination overstrained can produce wondrous effects.
You do right to change the scene. Go to London at once, amuse
yourself, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not return, till the old house is razed to the ground. That is
my resolve. You approve? That's well. All success to you, Fenwick.
I will canter back and get my portmanteau ready and the carriage
out, in time for the five o'clock train."</p>

<p>So then he, too, had seen&mdash;what? I did not dare and I did
not desire to ask him. But he, at least, was not walking in his
sleep! Did we both dream, or neither?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>

<p>There is an instance of the absorbing tyranny of every-day life
which must have struck all such of my readers as have ever
experienced one of those portents which are so at variance with
every-day life, that the ordinary epithet bestowed on them is
"supernatural."</p>

<p>And be my readers few or many, there will be no small proportion
of them to whom once, at least, in the course of their existence, a
something strange and eerie has occurred,&mdash;a something which
perplexed and baffled rational conjecture, and struck on those
chords which vibrate to superstition. It may have been only a dream
unaccountably verified,&mdash;an undefinable presentiment or
forewarning; but up from such slighter and vaguer tokens of the
realm of marvel, up to the portents of ghostly apparitions or
haunted chambers, I believe that the greater number of persons
arrived at middle age, however instructed the class, however
civilized the land, however sceptical the period, to which they
belong, have either in themselves experienced, or heard recorded by
intimate associates whose veracity they accept as indisputable in
all ordinary transactions of life, phenomena which are not to be
solved by the wit that mocks them, nor, perhaps, always and
entirely, to the contentment of the reason or the philosophy that
explains them away. Such phenomena, I say, are infinitely more
numerous than would appear from the instances currently quoted and
dismissed with a jest; for few of those who have witnessed them are
disposed to own it, and they who only hear of them through others,
however trustworthy, would not impugn their character for
common-sense by professing a belief to which common-sense is a
merciless persecutor. But he who reads my assertion in the quiet of
his own room, will perhaps pause, ransack his memory, and find
there, in some dark corner which he excludes from "the babbling and
remorseless day," a pale recollection that proves the assertion not
untrue.</p>

<p>And it is, I say, an instance of the absorbing tyranny of
everyday life, that whenever some such startling incident disturbs
its regular tenor of thought and occupation, that same every-day
life hastens to bury in its sands the object which has troubled its
surface; the more unaccountable, the more prodigious, has been the
phenomenon which has scared and astounded us, the more, with
involuntary effort, the mind seeks to rid itself of an enigma which
might disease the reason that tries to solve it. We go about our
mundane business with renewed avidity; we feel the necessity of
proving to ourselves that we are still sober, practical men, and
refuse to be unfitted for the world which we know, by unsolicited
visitations from worlds into which every glimpse is soon lost amid
shadows. And it amazes us to think how soon such incidents, though
not actually forgotten, though they can be recalled&mdash;and
recalled too vividly for health&mdash;at our will, are nevertheless
thrust, as it were, out of the mind's sight as we cast into
lumber-rooms the crutches and splints that remind us of a broken
limb which has recovered its strength and tone. It is a felicitous
peculiarity in our organization, which all members of my profession
will have noticed, how soon, when a bodily pain is once passed, it
becomes erased from the recollection,&mdash;how soon and how
invariably the mind refuses to linger over and recall it. No man
freed an hour before from a raging toothache, the rack of a
neuralgia, seats himself in his armchair to recollect and ponder
upon the anguish he has undergone. It is the same with certain
afflictions of the mind,&mdash;not with those that strike on our
affections, or blast our fortunes, overshadowing our whole future
with a sense of loss; but where a trouble or calamity has been an
accident, an episode in our wonted life, where it affects ourselves
alone, where it is attended with a sense of shame and humiliation,
where the pain of recalling it seems idle, and if indulged would
almost madden us,&mdash;agonies of that kind we do not brood over
as we do over the death or falsehood of beloved friends, or the
train of events by which we are reduced from wealth to penury. No
one, for instance, who has escaped from a shipwreck, from the brink
of a precipice, from the jaws of a tiger, spends his days and
nights in reviving his terrors past, re-imagining dangers not to
occur again, or, if they do occur, from which the experience
undergone can suggest no additional safeguards. The current of our
life, indeed, like that of the rivers, is most rapid in the midmost
channel, where all streams are alike comparatively slow in the
depth and along the shores in which each life, as each river, has a
character peculiar to itself. And hence, those who would sail with
the tide of the world, as those who sail with the tide of a river,
hasten to take the middle of the stream, as those who sail against
the tide are found clinging to the shore. I returned to my habitual
duties and avocations with renewed energy; I did not suffer my
thoughts to dwell on the dreary wonders that had haunted me, from
the evening I first met Sir Philip Derval to the morning on which I
had quitted the house of his heir; whether realities or
hallucinations, no guess of mine could unravel such marvels, and no
prudence of mine guard me against their repetition. But I had no
fear that they would be repeated, any more than the man who had
gone through shipwreck, or the hairbreadth escape from a fall down
a glacier, fears again to be found in a similar peril. Margrave had
departed, whither I knew not, and, with his departure, ceased all
sense of his influence. A certain calm within me, a tranquillizing
feeling of relief, seemed to me like a pledge of permanent
delivery.</p>

<p>But that which did accompany and haunt me, through all my
occupations and pursuits, was the melancholy remembrance of the
love I had lost in Lilian. I heard from Mrs. Ashleigh, who still
frequently visited me, that her daughter seemed much in the same
quiet state of mind,&mdash;perfectly reconciled to our separation,
seldom mentioning my name, if mentioning it, with indifference; the
only thing remarkable in her state was her aversion to all society,
and a kind of lethargy that would come over her, often in the
daytime. She would suddenly fall into sleep and so remain for
hours, but a sleep that seemed very serene and tranquil, and from
which she woke of herself. She kept much within her own room, and
always retired to it when visitors were announced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh began reluctantly to relinquish the persuasion she
had so long and so obstinately maintained, that this state of
feeling towards myself&mdash;and, indeed, this general change in
Lilian&mdash;was but temporary and abnormal; she began to allow
that it was best to drop all thoughts of a renewed
engagement,&mdash;a future union. I proposed to see Lilian in her
presence and in my professional capacity; perhaps some physical
cause, especially for this lethargy, might be detected and removed.
Mrs. Ashleigh owned to me that the idea had occurred to herself:
she had sounded Lilian upon it: but her daughter had so resolutely
opposed it,&mdash;had said with so quiet a firmness "that all being
over between us, a visit from me would be unwelcome and
painful,"&mdash;that Mrs. Ashleigh felt that an interview thus
deprecated would only confirm estrangement. One day, in calling,
she asked my advice whether it would not be better to try the
effect of change of air and scene, and, in some other place, some
other medical opinion might be taken? I approved of this suggestion
with unspeakable sadness.</p>

<p>"And," said Mrs. Ashleigh, shedding tears, "if that experiment
prove unsuccessful, I will write and let you know; and we must then
consider what to say to the world as a reason why the marriage is
broken off. I can render this more easy by staying away. I will not
return to L&mdash;&mdash; till the matter has ceased to be the
topic of talk, and at a distance any excuse will be less questioned
and seem more natural. But still&mdash;still&mdash;let us hope
still."</p>

<p>"Have you one ground for hope?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; but you will think it very frail and
fallacious."</p>

<p>"Name it, and let me judge."</p>

<p>"One night&mdash;in which you were on a visit to Derval
Court&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay, that night."</p>

<p>"Lilian woke me by a loud cry (she sleeps in the next room to
me, and the door was left open); I hastened to her bedside in
alarm; she was asleep, but appeared extremely agitated and
convulsed. She kept calling on your name in a tone of passionate
fondness, but as if in great terror. She cried, 'Do not go,
Allen&mdash;do not go&mdash;you know not what you brave!&mdash;what
you do!' Then she rose in her bed, clasping her hands. Her face was
set and rigid; I tried to awake her, but could not. After a little
time, she breathed a deep sigh, and murmured, 'Allen, Allen! dear
love! did you not hear, did you not see me? What could thus baffle
matter and traverse space but love and soul? Can you still doubt
me, Allen?&mdash;doubt that I love you now, shall love you
evermore?&mdash;yonder, yonder, as here below?' She then sank back
on her pillow, weeping, and then I woke her."</p>

<p>"And what did she say on waking?"</p>

<p>"She did not remember what she had dreamed, except that she had
passed through some great terror; but added, with a vague smile,
'It is over, and I feel happy now.' Then she turned round and fell
asleep again, but quietly as a child, the tears dried, the smile
resting."</p>

<p>"Go, my dear friend, go; take Lilian away from this place as
soon as you can; divert her mind with fresh scenes. I hope!&mdash;I
do hope! Let me know where you fix yourself. I will seize a
holiday,&mdash;I need one; I will arrange as to my patients; I will
come to the same place; she need not know of it, but I must be by
to watch, to hear your news of her. Heaven bless you for what you
have said! I hope!&mdash;I do hope!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>

<p>Some days after, I received a few lines from Mrs. Ashleigh. Her
arrangements for departure were made. They were to start the next
morning. She had fixed on going into the north of Devonshire, and
staying some weeks either at Ilfracombe or Lynton, whichever place
Lilian preferred. She would write as soon as they were settled.</p>

<p>I was up at my usual early hour the next morning. I resolved to
go out towards Mrs. Ashleigh's house, and watch, unnoticed, where I
might, perhaps, catch a glimpse of Lilian as the carriage that
would convey her to the railway passed my hiding-place.</p>

<p>I was looking impatiently at the clock; it was yet two hours
before the train by which Mrs. Ashleigh proposed to leave. A loud
ring at my bell! I opened the door. Mrs. Ashleigh rushed in,
falling on my breast.</p>

<p>"Lilian! Lilian!"</p>

<p>"Heavens! What has happened?"</p>

<p>"She has left! she is gone,&mdash;gone away! Oh, Allen,
how?&mdash;whither? Advise me. What is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Come in&mdash;compose yourself&mdash;tell me
all,&mdash;clearly, quickly. Lilian gone,&mdash;gone away?
Impossible! She must be hid somewhere in the house,&mdash;the
garden; she, perhaps, did not like the journey. She may have crept
away to some young friend's house. But I talk when you should talk:
tell me all."</p>

<p>Little enough to tell! Lilian had seemed unusually cheerful the
night before, and pleased at the thought of the excursion. Mother
and daughter retired to rest early: Mrs. Ashleigh saw Lilian
sleeping quietly before she herself went to bed. She woke betimes
in the morning, dressed herself, went into the next room to call
Lilian&mdash;Lilian was not there. No suspicion of flight occurred
to her. Perhaps her daughter might be up already, and gone
downstairs, remembering something she might wish to pack and take
with her on the journey. Mrs. Ashleigh was confirmed in this idea
when she noticed that her own room door was left open. She went
downstairs, met a maidservant in the hall, who told her, with alarm
and surprise, that both the street and garden doors were found
unclosed. No one had seen Lilian. Mrs. Ashleigh now became
seriously uneasy. On remounting to her daughter's room, she missed
Lilian's bonnet and mantle. The house and garden were both searched
in vain. There could be no doubt that Lilian had gone,&mdash;must
have stolen noiselessly at night through her mother's room, and let
herself out of the house and through the garden.</p>

<p>"Do you think she could have received any letter, any message,
any visitor unknown to you?"</p>

<p>"I cannot think it. Why do you ask? Oh, Allen, you do not
believe there is any accomplice in this disappearance! No, you do
not believe it. But my child's honour! What will the world
think?"</p>

<p>Not for the world cared I at that moment. I could think only of
Lilian, and without one suspicion that imputed blame to her.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, be silent; perhaps she has gone on some visit and
will return. Meanwhile, leave inquiry to me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LV.</h2>

<p>It seemed incredible that Lilian could wander far without being
observed. I soon ascertained that she had not gone away by the
railway&mdash;by any public conveyance&mdash;had hired no carriage;
she must therefore be still in the town, or have left it on foot.
The greater part of the day was consumed in unsuccessful inquiries,
and faint hopes that she would return; meanwhile the news of her
disappearance had spread: how could such news fail to do so?</p>

<p>An acquaintance of mine met me under the archway of Monks' Gate.
He wrung my hand and looked at me with great compassion.</p>

<p>"I fear," said he, "that we were all deceived in that young
Margrave. He seemed so well conducted, in spite of his lively
manners. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Ashleigh was, perhaps, imprudent to admit him into her
house so familiarly. He was certainly very handsome. Young ladies
will be romantic."</p>

<p>"How dare you, sir!" I cried, choked with rage. "And without any
colouring to so calumnious a suggestion! Margrave has not been in
the town for many days. No one knows even where he is."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it is known where he is. He wrote to order the effects
which he had left here to be sent to Penrith."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"The letter arrived the day before yesterday. I happened to be
calling at the house where he last lodged, when at L&mdash;&mdash;,
the house opposite Mrs. Ashleigh's garden. No doubt the servants in
both houses gossip with each other. Miss Ashleigh could scarcely
fail to hear of Mr. Margrave's address from her maid; and since
servants will exchange gossip, they may also convey letters. Pardon
me, you know I am your friend."</p>

<p>"Not from the moment you breathe a word against my betrothed
wife," said I, fiercely.</p>

<p>I wrenched myself from the clasp of the man's hand, but his
words still rang in my ears. I mounted my horse; I rode into the
adjoining suburbs, the neighbouring villages; there, however, I
learned nothing, till, just at nightfall, in a hamlet about ten
miles from L&mdash;&mdash;, a labourer declared he had seen a young
lady dressed as I described, who passed by him in a path through
the fields a little before noon; that he was surprised to see one
so young, so well dressed, and a stranger to the neighbourhood (for
he knew by sight the ladies of the few families scattered around)
walking alone; that as he stepped out of the path to make way for
her, he looked hard into her face, and she did not heed
him,&mdash;seemed to gaze right before her, into space. If her
expression had been less quiet and gentle, he should have thought,
he could scarcely say why, that she was not quite right in her
mind; there was a strange unconscious stare in her eyes, as if she
were walking in her sleep. Her pace was very steady,&mdash;neither
quick nor slow. He had watched her till she passed out of sight,
amidst a wood through which the path wound its way to a village at
some distance.</p>

<p>I followed up this clew. I arrived at the village to which my
informant directed me, but night had set in. Most of the houses
were closed, so I could glean no further information from the
cottages or at the inn. But the police superintendent of the
district lived in the village, and to him I gave instructions which
I had not given, and, indeed, would have been disinclined to give,
to the police at L&mdash;&mdash;. He was intelligent and kindly; he
promised to communicate at once with the different police-stations
for miles round, and with all delicacy and privacy. It was not
probable that Lilian could have wandered in one day much farther
than the place at which I then was; it was scarcely to be conceived
that she could baffle my pursuit and the practised skill of the
police. I rested but a few hours, at a small public-house, and was
on horseback again at dawn. A little after sunrise I again heard of
the wanderer. At a lonely cottage, by a brick-kiln, in the midst of
a wide common, she had stopped the previous evening, and asked for
a draught of milk. The woman who gave it to her inquired if she had
lost her way. She said "No;" and, only tarrying a few minutes, had
gone across the common; and the woman supposed she was a visitor at
a gentleman's house which was at the farther end of the waste, for
the path she took led to no town, no village. It occurred to me
then that Lilian avoided all high-roads, all places, even the
humblest, where men congregated together. But where could she have
passed the night? Not to fatigue the reader with the fruitless
result of frequent inquiries, I will but say that at the end of the
second day I had succeeded in ascertaining that I was still on her
track; and though I had ridden to and fro nearly double the
distance&mdash;coming back again to places I had left
behind&mdash;it was at the distance of forty miles from
L&mdash;&mdash; that I last heard of her that second day. She had
been sitting alone by a little brook only an hour before. I was led
to the very spot by a woodman&mdash;it was at the hour of twilight
when he beheld her; she was leaning her face on her hand, and
seemed weary. He spoke to her; she did not answer, but rose and
resumed her way along the banks of the streamlet. That night I put
up at no inn; I followed the course of the brook for miles, then
struck into every path that I could conceive her to have
taken,&mdash;in vain. Thus I consumed the night on foot, tying my
horse to a tree, for he was tired out, and returning to him at
sunrise. At noon, the third day, I again heard of her, and in a
remote, savage part of the country. The features of the landscape
were changed; there was little foliage and little culture, but the
ground was broken into moulds and hollows, and covered with patches
of heath and stunted brushwood. She had been seen by a shepherd,
and he made the same observation as the first who had guided me on
her track,&mdash;she looked to him "like some one walking in her
sleep." An hour or two later, in a dell, amongst the furze-bushes,
I chanced on a knot of ribbon. I recognized the colour Lilian
habitually wore; I felt certain that the ribbon was hers.
Calculating the utmost speed I could ascribe to her, she could not
be far off, yet still I failed to discover her. The scene now was
as solitary as a desert. I met no one on my way. At length, a
little after sunset, I found myself in view of the sea. A small
town nestled below the cliffs, on which I was guiding my weary
horse. I entered the town, and while my horse was baiting went in
search of the resident policeman. The information I had directed to
be sent round the country had reached him; he had acted on it, but
without result. I was surprised to hear him address me by name, and
looking at him more narrowly, I recognized him for the policeman
Waby. This young man had always expressed so grateful a sense of my
attendance on his sister, and had, indeed, so notably evinced his
gratitude in prosecuting with Margrave the inquiries which
terminated in the discovery of Sir Philip Derval's murderer, that I
confided to him the name of the wanderer, of which he had not been
previously informed; but which it would be, indeed, impossible to
conceal from him should the search in which his aid was asked prove
successful,&mdash;as he knew Miss Ashleigh by sight. His face
immediately became thoughtful. He paused a minute or two, and then
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think I have it, but I do not like to say; I may pain you,
sir."</p>

<p>"Not by confidence; you pain me by concealment."</p>

<p>The man hesitated still: I encouraged him, and then he spoke out
frankly.</p>

<p>"Sir, did you never think it strange that Mr. Margrave should
move from his handsome rooms in the hotel to a somewhat
uncomfortable lodging, from the window of which he could look down
on Mrs. Ashleigh's garden? I have seen him at night in the balcony
of that window, and when I noticed him going so frequently into
Mrs. Ashleigh's house during your unjust detention, I own, sir, I
felt for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Mr. Margrave went to Mrs. Ashleigh's house as my
friend. He has left L&mdash;&mdash; weeks ago. What has all this to
do with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Patience, sir; hear me out. I was sent from L&mdash;&mdash; to
this station (on promotion, sir) a fortnight since last Friday, for
there has been a good deal of crime hereabouts; it is a bad
neighbourhood, and full of smugglers. Some days ago, in watching
quietly near a lonely house, of which the owner is a suspicious
character down in my books, I saw, to my amazement, Mr. Margrave
come out of that house,&mdash;come out of a private door in it,
which belongs to a part of the building not inhabited by the owner,
but which used formerly, when the house was a sort of inn, to be
let to night lodgers of the humblest description. I followed him;
he went down to the seashore, walked about, singing to himself;
then returned to the house, and re-entered by the same door. I soon
learned that he lodged in the house,&mdash;had lodged there for
several days. The next morning, a fine yacht arrived at a tolerably
convenient creek about a mile from the house, and there anchored.
Sailors came ashore, rambling down to this town. The yacht belonged
to Mr. Margrave; he had purchased it by commission in London. It is
stored for a long voyage. He had directed it to come to him in this
out-of-the-way place, where no gentleman's yacht ever put in
before, though the creek or bay is handy enough for such craft.
Well, sir, is it not strange that a rich young gentleman should
come to this unfrequented seashore, put up with accommodation that
must be of the rudest kind, in the house of a man known as a
desperate smuggler, suspected to be worse; order a yacht to meet
him here; is not all this strange? But would it be strange if he
were waiting for a young lady? And if a young lady has fled at
night from her home, and has come secretly along bypaths, which
must have been very fully explained to her beforehand, and is now
near that young gentleman's lodging, if not actually in it&mdash;if
this be so, why, the affair is not so very strange after all. And
now do you forgive me, sir?"</p>

<p>"Where is this house? Lead me to it."</p>

<p>"You can hardly get to it except on foot; rough walking, sir,
and about seven miles off by the shortest cut."</p>

<p>"Come, and at once; come quickly. We must be there
before&mdash;before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Before the young lady can get to the place. Well, from what you
say of the spot in which she was last seen, I think, on reflection,
we may easily do that. I am at your service, sir. But I should warn
you that the owners of the house, man and wife, are both of
villanous character,&mdash;would do anything for money. Mr.
Margrave, no doubt, has money enough; and if the young lady chooses
to go away with Mr. Margrave, you know I have no power to help
it."</p>

<p>"Leave all that to me; all I ask of you is to show me the
house."</p>

<p>We were soon out of the town; the night had closed in; it was
very dark, in spite of a few stars; the path was rugged and
precipitous, sometimes skirting the very brink of perilous cliffs,
sometimes delving down to the seashore&mdash;there stopped by rock
or wave&mdash;and painfully rewinding up the ascent.</p>

<p>"It is an ugly path, sir, but it saves four miles; and anyhow
the road is a bad one."</p>

<p>We came, at last, to a few wretched fishermen's huts. The moon
had now risen, and revealed the squalor of poverty-stricken ruinous
hovels; a couple of boats moored to the shore, a moaning, fretful
sea; and at a distance a vessel, with lights on board, lying
perfectly still at anchor in a sheltered curve of the bold rude
shore. The policeman pointed to the vessel.</p>

<p>"The yacht, sir; the wind will be in her favour if she sails
tonight."</p>

<p>We quickened our pace as well as the nature of the path would
permit, left the huts behind us, and about a mile farther on came
to a solitary house, larger than, from the policeman's description
of Margrave's lodgement, I should have presupposed: a house that in
the wilder parts of Scotland might be almost a laird's; but even in
the moonlight it looked very dilapidated and desolate. Most of the
windows were closed, some with panes broken, stuffed with wisps of
straw; there were the remains of a wall round the house; it was
broken in some parts (only its foundation left). On approaching the
house I observed two doors,&mdash;one on the side fronting the sea,
one on the other side, facing a patch of broken ground that might
once have been a garden, and lay waste within the enclosure of the
ruined wall, encumbered with various litter; heaps of rubbish, a
ruined shed, the carcass of a worn-out boat. This latter door stood
wide open,&mdash;the other was closed. The house was still and
dark, as if either deserted, or all within it retired to rest.</p>

<p>"I think that open door leads at once to the rooms Mr. Margrave
hires; he can go in and out without disturbing the other inmates.
They used to keep, on the side which they inhabit, a beer-house,
but the magistrates shut it up; still, it is a resort for bad
characters. Now, sir, what shall we do?</p>

<p>"Watch separately. You wait within the enclosure of the wall,
hid by those heaps of rubbish, near the door; none can enter but
what you will observe them. If you see her, you will accost and
stop her, and call aloud for me; I shall be in hearing. I will go
back to the high part of the ground yonder&mdash;it seems to me
that she must pass that way; and I would desire, if possible, to
save her from the humiliation, the&mdash;the shame of coming within
the precincts of that man's abode. I feel I may trust you now and
hereafter. It is a great thing for the happiness and honour of this
poor young lady and her mother, that I may be able to declare that
I did not take her from that man, from any man&mdash;from that
house, from any house. You comprehend me, and will obey? I speak to
you as a confidant,&mdash;a friend."</p>

<p>"I thank you with my whole heart, sir, for so doing. You saved
my sister's life, and the least I can do is to keep secret all that
would pain your life if blabbed abroad. I know what mischief folks'
tongues can make. I will wait by the door, never fear, and will
rather lose my place than not strain all the legal power I possess
to keep the young lady back from sorrow."</p>

<p>This dialogue was interchanged in close hurried whisper behind
the broken wall, and out of all hearing. Waby now crept through a
wide gap into the inclosure, and nestled himself silently amidst
the wrecks of the broken boat, not six feet from the open door, and
close to the wall of the house itself. I went back some thirty
yards up the road, to the rising ground which I had pointed out to
him. According to the best calculation I could
make&mdash;considering the pace at which I had cleared the
precipitous pathway, and reckoning from the place and time at which
Lilian had been last seen-she could not possibly have yet entered
that house. I might presume it would be more than half an hour
before she could arrive; I was in hopes that, during the interval,
Margrave might show himself, perhaps at the door, or from the
windows, or I might even by some light from the latter be guided to
the room in which to find him. If, after waiting a reasonable time,
Lilian should fail to appear, I had formed my plan of action; but
it was important for the success of that plan that I should not
lose myself in the strange house, nor bring its owners to
Margrave's aid,&mdash;that I should surprise him alone and
unawares. Half an hour, three quarters, a whole hour thus passed.
No sign of my poor wanderer; but signs there were of the enemy from
whom I resolved, at whatever risk, to free and to save her. A
window on the ground-floor, to the left of the door, which had long
fixed my attention because I had seen light through the chinks of
the shutters, slowly unclosed, the shutters fell back, the casement
opened, and I beheld Margrave distinctly; he held something in his
hand that gleamed in the moonlight, directed not towards the mound
on which I stood, nor towards the path I had taken, but towards an
open space beyond the ruined wall to the right. Hid by a cluster of
stunted shrubs I watched him with a heart that beat with rage, not
with terror. He seemed so intent in his own gaze as to be unheeding
or unconscious of all else. I stole from my post, and, still under
cover, sometimes of the broken wall, sometimes of the shaggy ridges
that skirted the path, crept on, on till I reached the side of the
house itself; then, there secure from his eyes, should he turn
them, I stepped over the ruined wall, scarcely two feet high in
that place, on&mdash;on towards the door. I passed the spot on
which the policeman had shrouded himself; he was seated, his back
against the ribs of the broken boat. I put my hand to his mouth
that he might not cry out in surprise, and whispered in his ear; he
stirred not. I shook him by the arm: still he stirred not. A ray of
the moon fell on his face. I saw that he was in a profound slumber.
Persuaded that it was no natural sleep, and that he had become
useless to me, I passed him by. I was at the threshold of the open
door, the light from the window close by falling on the ground; I
was in the passage; a glimmer came through the chinks of a door to
the left; I turned the handle noiselessly, and, the next moment,
Margrave was locked in my grasp.</p>

<p>"Call out," I hissed in his ear, "and I strangle you before any
one can come to your help."</p>

<p>He did not call out; his eye, fixed on mine as he writhed round,
saw, perhaps, his peril if he did. His countenance betrayed fear,
but as I tightened my grasp that expression gave way to one of
wrath and fierceness; and as, in turn, I felt the grip of his hand,
I knew that the struggle between us would be that of two strong
men, each equally bent on the mastery of the other.</p>

<p>I was, as I have said before, endowed with an unusual degree of
physical power, disciplined in early youth by athletic exercise and
contest. In height and in muscle I had greatly the advantage over
my antagonist; but such was the nervous vigour, the elastic energy
of his incomparable frame, in which sinews seemed springs of steel,
that had our encounter been one in which my strength was less
heightened by rage, I believe that I could no more have coped with
him than the bison can cope with the boa; but I was animated by
that passion which trebles for a time all our forces,&mdash;which
makes even the weak man a match for the strong. I felt that if I
were worsted, disabled, stricken down, Lilian might be lost in
losing her sole protector; and on the other hand, Margrave had been
taken at the disadvantage of that surprise which will half unnerve
the fiercest of the wild beasts; while as we grappled, reeling and
rocking to and fro in our struggle, I soon observed that his
attention was distracted,&mdash;that his eye was turned towards an
object which he had dropped involuntarily when I first seized him.
He sought to drag me towards that object, and when near it stooped
to seize. It was a bright, slender, short wand of steel. I
remembered when and where I had seen it, whether in my waking state
or in vision; and as his hand stole down to take it from the floor,
I set on the wand my strong foot. I cannot tell by what rapid
process of thought and association I came to the belief that the
possession of a little piece of blunted steel would decide the
conflict in favor of the possessor; but the struggle now was
concentred on the attainment of that seemingly idle weapon. I was
becoming breathless and exhausted, while Margrave seemed every
moment to gather up new force, when collecting all my strength for
one final effort, I lifted him suddenly high in the air, and hurled
him to the farthest end of the cramped arena to which our contest
was confined. He fell, and with a force by which most men would
have been stunned; but he recovered himself with a quick rebound,
and, as he stood facing me, there was something grand as well as
terrible in his aspect. His eyes literally flamed, as those of a
tiger; his rich hair, flung back from his knitted forehead, seemed
to erect itself as an angry mane; his lips, slightly parted, showed
the glitter of his set teeth; his whole frame seemed larger in the
tension of the muscles, and as, gradually relaxing his first
defying and haughty attitude, he crouched as the panther crouches
for its deadly spring, I felt as if it were a wild beast, whose
rush was coming upon me,&mdash;wild beast, but still Man, the king
of the animals, fashioned forth from no mixture of humbler races by
the slow revolutions of time, but his royalty stamped on his form
when the earth became fit for his coming.(1)</p>

<p>At that moment I snatched up the wand, directed it towards him,
and advancing with a fearless stride, cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down to my feet, miserable sorcerer!"</p>

<p>To my own amaze, the effect was instantaneous. My terrible
antagonist dropped to the floor as a dog drops at the word of his
master. The muscles of his frowning countenance relaxed, the glare
of his wrathful eyes grew dull and rayless; his limbs lay prostrate
and unnerved, his head rested against the wall, his arms limp and
drooping by his side. I approached him slowly and cautiously; he
seemed cast into a profound slumber.</p>

<p>"You are at my mercy now!" said I.</p>

<p>He moved his head as in sign of deprecating submission.</p>

<p>"You hear and understand me? Speak!"</p>

<p>His lips faintly muttered, "Yes."</p>

<p>"I command you to answer truly the questions I shall address to
you."</p>

<p>"I must, while yet sensible of the power that has passed to your
hand."</p>

<p>"Is it by some occult magnetic property in this wand that you
have exercised so demoniac an influence over a creature so pure as
Lilian Ashleigh?"</p>

<p>"By that wand and by other arts which you could not
comprehend."</p>

<p>"And for what infamous object,&mdash;her seduction, her
dishonour?"</p>

<p>"No! I sought in her the aid of a gift which would cease did she
cease to be pure. At first I but cast my influence upon her that
through her I might influence yourself. I needed your help to
discover a secret. Circumstances steeled your mind against me. I
could no longer hope that you would voluntarily lend yourself to my
will. Meanwhile, I had found in her the light of a loftier
knowledge than that of your science; through that knowledge, duly
heeded and cultivated, I hoped to divine what I cannot of myself
discover. Therefore I deepened over her mind the spells I command;
therefore I have drawn her hither as the loadstone draws the steel,
and therefore I would have borne her with me to the shores to which
I was about this night to sail. I had cast the inmates of the house
and all around it into slumber, in order that none might witness
her departure; had I not done so, I should have summoned others to
my aid, in spite of your threat."</p>

<p>"And would Lilian Ashleigh have passively accompanied you, to
her own irretrievable disgrace?"</p>

<p>"She could not have helped it; she would have been unconscious
of her acts; she was, and is, in a trance; nor, had she gone with
me, would she have waked from that state while she lived; that
would not have been long."</p>

<p>"Wretch! and for what object of unhallowed curiosity do you
exert an influence which withers away the life of its victim?"</p>

<p>"Not curiosity, but the instinct of self-preservation. I count
on no life beyond the grave. I would defy the grave, and live
on."</p>

<p>"And was it to learn, through some ghastly agencies, the secret
of renewing existence, that you lured me by the shadow of your own
image on the night when we met last?"</p>

<p>The voice of Margrave here became very faint as he answered me,
and his countenance began to exhibit the signs of an exhaustion
almost mortal.</p>

<p>"Be quick," he murmured, "or I die. The fluid which emanates
from that wand, in the hand of one who envenoms that fluid with his
own hatred and rage, will prove fatal to my life. Lower the wand
from my forehead! low&mdash;low,&mdash;lower still!"</p>

<p>"What was the nature of that rite in which you constrained me to
share?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say. You are killing me. Enough that you were saved
from a great danger by the apparition of the protecting image
vouchsafed to your eye; otherwise you would&mdash;you
would&mdash;Oh, release me! Away! away!"</p>

<p>The foam gathered to his lips; his limbs became fearfully
convulsed.</p>

<p>"One question more: where is Lilian at this moment? Answer that
question, and I depart."</p>

<p>He raised his head, made a visible effort to rally his strength,
and gasped out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yonder. Pass through the open space up the cliff, beside a
thorn-tree; you will find her there, where she halted when the wand
dropped from my hand. But&mdash;but&mdash;beware! Ha! you will
serve me yet, and through her! They said so that night, though you
heard them not. They said it!" Here his face became death-like; he
pressed his hand on his heart, and shrieked out, "Away! away! or
you are my murderer!"</p>

<p>I retreated to the other end of the room, turning the wand from
him, and when I gained the door, looked back; his convulsions had
ceased, but he seemed locked in a profound swoon.</p>

<p>I left the room,&mdash;the house,&mdash;paused by Waby; he was
still sleeping. "Awake!" I said, and touched him with the wand. He
started up at once, rubbed his eyes, began stammering out excuses.
I checked them, and bade him follow me. I took the way up the open
ground towards which Margrave had pointed the wand, and there,
motionless, beside a gnarled fantastic thorn-tree, stood Lilian.
Her arms were folded across her breast; her face, seen by the
moonlight, looked so innocent and so infantine, that I needed no
other evidence to tell me how unconscious she was of the peril to
which her steps had been drawn. I took her gently by the hand.
"Come with me," I said in a whisper, and she obeyed me silently,
and with a placid smile.</p>

<p>Rough though the way, she seemed unconscious of fatigue. I
placed her arm in mine, but she did not lean on it. We got back to
the town. I obtained there an old chaise and a pair of horses. At
morning Lilian was under her mother's roof. About the noon of that
day fever seized her; she became rapidly worse, and, to all
appearance, in imminent danger. Delirium set in; I watched beside
her night and day, supported by an inward conviction of her
recovery, but tortured by the sight of her sufferings. On the third
day a change for the better became visible; her sleep was calm, her
breathing regular.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards she woke out of danger. Her eyes fell at once
on me, with all their old ineffable tender sweetness.</p>

<p>"Oh, Allen, beloved, have I not been very ill? But I am almost
well now. Do not weep; I shall live for you,&mdash;for your sake."
And she bent forward, drawing my hand from my streaming eyes, and
kissed me with a child's guileless kiss on my burning forehead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>

<p>Lilian recovered, but the strange thing was this: all memory of
the weeks that had elapsed since her return from visiting her aunt
was completely obliterated; she seemed in profound ignorance of the
charge on which I had been confined,&mdash;perfectly ignorant even
of the existence of Margrave. She had, indeed, a very vague
reminiscence of her conversation with me in the garden,&mdash;the
first conversation which had ever been embittered by a
disagreement,&mdash;but that disagreement itself she did not
recollect. Her belief was that she had been ill and light-headed
since that evening. From that evening to the hour of her waking,
conscious and revived, all was a blank. Her love for me was
restored, as if its thread had never been broken. Some such
instances of oblivion after bodily illness or mental shock are
familiar enough to the practice of all medical men;(1) and I was
therefore enabled to appease the anxiety and wonder of Mrs.
Ashleigh, by quoting various examples of loss, or suspension, of
memory. We agreed that it would be necessary to break to Lilian,
though very cautiously, the story of Sir Philip Derval's murder,
and the charge to which I had been subjected. She could not fail to
hear of those events from others. How shall I express her womanly
terror, her loving, sympathizing pity, on hearing the tale, which I
softened as well as I could?</p>

<p>"And to think that I knew nothing of this!" she cried, clasping
my hand; "to think that you were in peril, and that I was not by
your side!"</p>

<p>Her mother spoke of Margrave, as a visitor,&mdash;an agreeable,
lively stranger; Lilian could not even recollect his name, but she
seemed shocked to think that any visitor had been admitted while I
was in circumstances so awful! Need I say that our engagement was
renewed? Renewed! To her knowledge and to her heart it had never
been interrupted for a moment. But oh! the malignity of the wrong
world! Oh, that strange lust of mangling reputations, which seizes
on hearts the least wantonly cruel! Let two idle tongues utter a
tale against some third person, who never offended the babblers,
and how the tale spreads, like fire, lighted none know how, in the
herbage of an American prairie! Who shall put it out?</p>

<p>What right have we to pry into the secrets of other men's
hearths? True or false, the tale that is gabbled to us, what
concern of ours can it be? I speak not of cases to which the law
has been summoned, which law has sifted, on which law has
pronounced. But how, when the law is silent, can we assume its
verdicts? How be all judges where there has been no witness-box, no
cross-examination, no jury? Yet, every day we put on our ermine,
and make ourselves judges,&mdash;judges sure to condemn, and on
what evidence? That which no court of law will receive. Somebody
has said something to somebody, which somebody repeats to
everybody!</p>

<p>The gossip of L&mdash;&mdash; had set in full current against
Lilian's fair name. No ladies had called or sent to congratulate
Mrs. Ashleigh on her return, or to inquire after Lilian herself
during her struggle between life and death.</p>

<p>How I missed the Queen of the Hill at this critical moment! How
I longed for aid to crush the slander, with which I knew not how to
grapple,&mdash;aid in her knowledge of the world and her ascendancy
over its judgments! I had heard from her once since her absence,
briefly but kindly expressing her amazement at the ineffable
stupidity which could for a moment have subjected me to a suspicion
of Sir Philip Derval's strange murder, and congratulating me
heartily on my complete vindication from so monstrous a charge. To
this letter no address was given. I supposed the omission to be
accidental, but on calling at her house to inquire her direction, I
found that the servants did not know it.</p>

<p>What, then, was my joy when just at this juncture I received a
note from Mrs. Poyntz, stating that she had returned the night
before, and would be glad to see me.</p>

<p>I hastened to her house. "Ah," thought I, as I sprang lightly up
the ascent to the Hill, "how the tattlers will be silenced by a
word from her imperial lips!" And only just as I approached her
door did it strike me how difficult&mdash;nay, how
impossible&mdash;to explain to her&mdash;the hard positive woman,
her who had, less ostensibly but more ruthlessly than myself,
destroyed Dr. Lloyd for his belief in the comparatively rational
pretensions of clairvoyance&mdash;all the mystical excuses for
Lilian's flight from her home? How speak to her&mdash;or, indeed,
to any one&mdash;about an occult fascination and a magic wand? No
matter: surely it would be enough to say that at the time Lilian
had been light-headed, under the influence of the fever which had
afterwards nearly proved fatal, The early friend of Anne Ashleigh
would not be a severe critic on any tale that might right the good
name of Anne Ashleigh's daughter. So assured, with a light heart
and a cheerful face, I followed the servant into the great lady's
pleasant but decorous presence-chamber.</p>

<p>(1) Such instances of suspense of memory are recorded in most
physiological and in some metaphysical works. Dr. Abercrombie
notices some, more or less similar to that related in the text: "A
young lady who was present at a catastrophe in Scotland, in which
many people lost their lives by the fall of the gallery of a
church, escaped without any injury, but with the complete loss of
the recollection of any of the circumstances; and this extended not
only to the accident, but to everything that had occurred to her
for a certain time before going to church. A lady whom I attended
some years ago in a protracted illness, in which her memory became
much impaired, lost the recollection of a period of about ten or
twelve years, but spoke with perfect consistency of things as they
stood before that time." Dr. Aberercmbie adds: "As far as I have
been able to trace it, the principle in such cases seems to be,
that when the memory is impaired to a certain degree, the loss of
it extends backward to some event or some period by which a
particularly deep impression had been made upon the
mind."&mdash;ABERCROMBIE: On the Intellectual Powers, pp. 118, 119

<h2>CHAPTER LVII.</h2>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz was on her favourite seat by the window, and for a
wonder, not knitting&mdash;that classic task seemed done; but she
was smoothing and folding the completed work with her white comely
hand, and smiling over it, as if in complacent approval, when I
entered the room. At the fire-side sat the he-colonel inspecting a
newly-invented barometer; at another window, in the farthest recess
of the room, stood Miss Jane Poyntz, with a young gentleman whom I
had never before seen, but who turned his eyes full upon me with a
haughty look as the servant announced my name. He was tall, well
proportioned, decidedly handsome, but with that expression of cold
and concentred self-esteem in his very attitude, as well as his
countenance, which makes a man of merit unpopular, a man without
merit ridiculous.</p>

<p>The he-colonel, always punctiliously civil, rose from his seat,
shook hands with me cordially, and said, "Coldish weather to-day;
but we shall have rain to-morrow. Rainy seasons come in cycles. We
are about to commence a cycle of them with heavy showers." He
sighed, and returned to his barometer.</p>

<p>Miss Jane bowed to me graciously enough, but was evidently a
little confused,&mdash;a circumstance which might well attract my
notice, for I had never before seen that high-bred young lady
deviate a hairsbreadth from the even tenor of a manner admirable
for a cheerful and courteous ease, which, one felt convinced, would
be unaltered to those around her if an earthquake swallowed one up
an inch before her feet.</p>

<p>The young gentleman continued to eye me loftily, as the
heir-apparent to some celestial planet might eye an inferior
creature from a half-formed nebula suddenly dropped upon his
sublime and perfected, star.</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz extended to me two fingers, and said frigidly,
"Delighted to see you again! How kind to attend so soon to my
note!"</p>

<p>Motioning me to a seat beside her, she here turned to her
husband, and said, "Poyntz, since a cycle of rain begins tomorrow,
better secure your ride to-day. Take these young people with you. I
want to talk with Dr. Fenwick."</p>

<p>The colonel carefully put away his barometer, and saying to his
daughter, "Come!" went forth. Jane followed her father; the young
gentleman followed Jane.</p>

<p>The reception I had met chilled and disappointed me. I felt that
Mrs. Poyntz was changed, and in her change the whole house seemed
changed. The very chairs looked civilly unfriendly, as if preparing
to turn their backs on me. However, I was not in the false position
of an intruder; I had been summoned; it was for Mrs. Poyntz to
speak first, and I waited quietly for her to do so.</p>

<p>She finished the careful folding of her work, and then laid it
at rest in the drawer of the table at which she sat. Having so
done, she turned to me, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"By the way, I ought to have introduced to you my young guest,
Mr. Ashleigh Sumner. You would like him. He has talents,&mdash;not
showy, but solid. He will succeed in public life."</p>

<p>"So that young man is Mr. Ashleigh Sumner? I do not wonder that
Miss Ashleigh rejected him."</p>

<p>I said this, for I was nettled, as well as surprised, at the
coolness with which a lady who had professed a friendship for me
mentioned that fortunate young gentleman, with so complete an
oblivion of all the antecedents that had once made his name painful
to my ear.</p>

<p>In turn, my answer seemed to nettle Mrs. Poyntz.</p>

<p>"I am not so sure that she did reject; perhaps she rather
misunderstood him; gallant compliments are not always proposals of
marriage. However that be, his spirits were not much damped by Miss
Ashleigh's disdain, nor his heart deeply smitten by her charms; for
he is now very happy, very much attached to another young lady, to
whom he proposed three days ago, at Lady Delafield's, and not to
make a mystery of what all our little world will know before
tomorrow, that young lady is my daughter Jane."</p>

<p>"Were I acquainted with Mr. Sumner, I should offer to him my
sincere congratulations."</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz resumed, without heeding a reply more complimentary
to Miss Jane than to the object of her choice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I told you that I meant Jane to marry a rich country gentleman,
and Ashleigh Sumner is the very country gentleman I had then in my
thoughts. He is cleverer and more ambitious than I could have
hoped; he will be a minister some day, in right of his talents, and
a peer, if he wishes it, in right of his lands. So that matter is
settled."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which my mind passed rapidly through
links of reminiscence and reasoning, which led me to a mingled
sentiment of admiration for Mrs. Poyntz as a diplomatist and of
distrust for Mrs. Poyntz as a friend. It was now clear why Mrs.
Poyntz, before so little disposed to approve my love, had urged me
at once to offer my hand to Lilian, in order that she might depart
affianced and engaged to the house in which she would meet Mr.
Ashleigh Sumner. Hence Mrs. Poyntz's anxiety to obtain all the
information I could afford her of the sayings and doings at Lady
Haughton's; hence, the publicity she had so suddenly given to my
engagement; hence, when Mr. Sumner had gone away a rejected suitor,
her own departure from L&mdash;&mdash;; she had seized the very
moment when a vain and proud man, piqued by the mortification
received from one lady, falls the easier prey to the arts which
allure his suit to another. All was so far clear to me. And
I&mdash;was my self-conceit less egregious and less readily duped
than that of yon glided popinjay's! How skilfully this woman had
knitted me into her work with the noiseless turn of her white
hands! and yet, forsooth, I must vaunt the superior scope of my
intellect, and plumb all the fountains of Nature,&mdash;I, who
could not fathom the little pool of this female schemer's mind!</p>

<p>But that was no time for resentment to her or rebuke to myself.
She was now the woman who could best protect and save from slander
my innocent, beloved Lilian. But how approach that perplexing
subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz approached it, and with her usual decision of
purpose, which bore so deceitful a likeness to candour of mind.</p>

<p>"But it was not to talk of my affairs that I asked you to call,
Allen Fenwick." As she uttered my name, her voice softened, and her
manner took that maternal, caressing tenderness which had sometimes
amused and sometimes misled me. "No, I do not forget that you asked
me to be your friend, and I take without scruple the license of
friendship. What are these stories that I have heard already about
Lilian Ashleigh, to whom you were once engaged?"</p>

<p>"To whom I am still engaged."</p>

<p>"Is it possible? Oh, then, of course the stories I have heard
are all false. Very likely; no fiction in scandal ever surprises
me. Poor dear Lilian, then, never ran away from her mother's
house?"</p>

<p>I smothered the angry pain which this mode of questioning caused
me; I knew how important it was to Lilian to secure to her the
countenance and support of this absolute autocrat; I spoke of
Lilian's long previous distemper of mind; I accounted for it as any
intelligent physician, unacquainted with all that I could not
reveal, would account. Heaven forgive me for the venial falsehood,
but I spoke of the terrible charge against myself as enough to
unhinge for a time the intellect of a girl so acutely sensitive as
Lilian; I sought to create that impression as to the origin of all
that might otherwise seem strange; and in this state of cerebral
excitement she had wandered from home&mdash;but alone. I had
tracked every step of her way; I had found and restored her to her
home. A critical delirium had followed, from which she now rose,
cured in health, unsuspicious that there could be a whisper against
her name. And then, with all the eloquence I could command, and in
words as adapted as I could frame them to soften the heart of a
woman, herself a mother, I implored Mrs. Poyntz's aid to silence
all the cruelties of calumny, and extend her shield over the child
of her own early friend.</p>

<p>When I came to an end, I had taken, with caressing force, Mrs.
Poyntz's reluctant hands in mine. There were tears in my voice,
tears in my eyes. And the sound of her voice in reply gave me hope,
for it was unusually gentle. She was evidently moved. The hope was
soon quelled.</p>

<p>"Allen Fenwick," she said, "you have a noble heart; I grieve to
see how it abuses your reason. I cannot aid Lilian Ashleigh in the
way you ask. Do not start back so indignantly. Listen to me as
patiently as I have listened to you. That when you brought back the
unfortunate young woman to her poor mother, her mind was
disordered, and became yet more dangerously so, I can well believe;
that she is now recovered, and thinks with shame, or refuses to
think at all, of her imprudent flight, I can believe also; but I do
not believe, the World cannot believe, that she did not, knowingly
and purposely, quit her mother's roof, and in quest of that young
stranger so incautiously, so unfeelingly admitted to her mother's
house during the very time you were detained on the most awful of
human accusations. Every one in the town knows that Mr. Margrave
visited daily at Mrs. Ashleigh's during that painful period; every
one in the town knows in what strange out-of-the-way place this
young man had niched himself; and that a yacht was bought, and
lying in wait there. What for? It is said that the chaise in which
you brought Miss Ashleigh back to her home was hired in a village
within an easy reach of Mr. Margrave's lodging&mdash;of Mr.
Margrave's yacht. I rejoice that you saved the poor girl from ruin;
but her good name is tarnished; and if Anne Ashleigh, whom I
sincerely pity, asks me my advice, I can but give her this: 'Leave
L&mdash;&mdash;, take your daughter abroad; and if she is not to
marry Mr. Margrave, marry her as quietly and as quickly as possible
to some foreigner.'"</p>

<p>"Madam! madam! this, then, is your friendship to her&mdash;to
me! Oh, shame on you to insult thus an affianced husband! Shame on
me ever to have thought you had a heart!"</p>

<p>"A heart, man!" she exclaimed, almost fiercely, springing up,
and startling me with the change in her countenance and voice. "And
little you would have valued, and pitilessly have crushed this
heart, if I had suffered myself to show it to you! What right have
you to reproach me? I felt a warm interest in your career, an
unusual attraction in your conversation and society. Do you blame
me for that, or should I blame myself? Condemned to live amongst
brainless puppets, my dull occupation to pull the strings that
moved them, it was a new charm to my life to establish friendship
and intercourse with intellect and spirit and courage. Ah! I
understand that look, half incredulous, half inquisitive."</p>

<p>"Inquisitive, no; incredulous, yes! You desired my friendship,
and how does your harsh judgment of my betrothed wife prove either
to me or to her mother, whom you have known from your girlhood, the
first duty of a friend,&mdash;which is surely not that of leaving a
friend's side the moment that he needs countenance in calumny,
succour in trouble!"</p>

<p>"It is a better duty to prevent the calumny and avert the
trouble. Leave aside Anne Ashleigh, a cipher that I can add or
abstract from my sum of life as I please. What is my duty to
yourself? It is plain. It is to tell you that your honour commands
you to abandon all thoughts of Lilian Ashleigh as your wife.
Ungrateful that you are! Do you suppose it was no mortification to
my pride of woman and friend, that you never approached me in
confidence except to ask my good offices in promoting your
courtship to another; no shock to the quiet plans I had formed as
to our familiar though harmless intimacy, to hear that you were
bent on a marriage in which my friend would be lost to me?"</p>

<p>"Not lost! not lost! On the contrary, the regard I must suppose
you had for Lilian would have been a new link between our
homes."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Between me and that dreamy girl there could have been no
sympathy, there could have grown up no regard. You would have been
chained to your fireside, and&mdash;and&mdash;but no matter. I
stifled my disappointment as soon as I felt it,&mdash;stifled it,
as all my life I have stifled that which either destiny or
duty&mdash;duty to myself as to others&mdash;forbids me to indulge.
Ah, do not fancy me one of the weak criminals who can suffer a
worthy liking to grow into a debasing love! I was not in love with
you, Allen Fenwick."</p>

<p>"Do you think I was ever so presumptuous a coxcomb as to fancy
it?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, more softly; "I was not so false to my household
ties and to my own nature. But there are some friendships which are
as jealous as love. I could have cheerfully aided you in any choice
which my sense could have approved for you as wise; I should have
been pleased to have found in such a wife my most intimate
companion. But that silly child!&mdash;absurd! Nevertheless, the
freshness and enthusiasm of your love touched me; you asked my aid,
and I gave it. Perhaps I did believe that when you saw more of
Lilian Ashleigh you would be cured of a fancy conceived by the
eye&mdash;I should have known better what dupes the wisest men can
be to the witcheries of a fair face and eighteen! When I found your
illusion obstinate, I wrenched myself away from a vain regret,
turned to my own schemes and my own ambition, and smiled bitterly
to think that, in pressing you to propose so hastily to Lilian, I
made your blind passion an agent in my own plans. Enough of this. I
speak thus openly and boldly to you now, because now I have not a
sentiment that can interfere with the dispassionate soundness of my
counsels. I repeat, you cannot now marry Lilian Ashleigh; I cannot
take my daughter to visit her; I cannot destroy the social laws
that I myself have set in my petty kingdom."</p>

<p>"Be it as you will. I have pleaded for her while she is still
Lilian Ashleigh. I plead for no one to whom I have once given my
name. Before the woman whom I have taken from the altar, I can
place, as a shield sufficient, my strong breast of man. Who has so
deep an interest in Lilian's purity as I have? Who is so fitted to
know the exact truth of every whisper against her? Yet when I, whom
you admit to have some reputation for shrewd intelligence,&mdash;I,
who tracked her way,&mdash;I, who restored her to her
home,&mdash;when I, Allen Fenwick, am so assured of her inviolable
innocence in thought as in deed, that I trust my honour to her
keeping,&mdash;surely, surely, I confute the scandal which you
yourself do not believe, though you refuse to reject and to annul
it?"</p>

<p>"Do not deceive yourself, Allen Fenwick," said she, still
standing beside me, her countenance now hard and stern. "Look where
I stand, I am the World! The World, not as satirists depreciate, or
as optimists extol its immutable properties, its all-persuasive
authority. I am the World! And my voice is the World's voice when
it thus warns you. Should you make this marriage, your dignity of
character and position would be gone! If you look only to lucre and
professional success, possibly they may not ultimately suffer. You
have skill, which men need; their need may still draw patients to
your door and pour guineas into your purse. But you have the pride,
as well as the birth of a gentleman, and the wounds to that pride
will be hourly chafed and never healed. Your strong breast of man
has no shelter to the frail name of woman. The World, in its
health, will look down on your wife, though its sick may look up to
you. This is not all. The World, in its gentlest mood of
indulgence, will say compassionately, 'Poor man! how weak, and how
deceived! What an unfortunate marriage!' But the World is not often
indulgent,&mdash;it looks most to the motives most seen on the
surface. And the World will more frequently say, 'No; much too
clever a man to be duped! Miss Ashleigh had money. A good match to
the man who liked gold better than honour.'"</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, with difficulty suppressing my rage; and,
remembering it was a woman who spoke to me, "Farewell, madam," said
I, through my grinded teeth. "Were you, indeed, the Personation of
The World, whose mean notions you mouth so calmly, I could not
disdain you more." I turned to the door, and left her still
standing erect and menacing, the hard sneer on her resolute lip,
the red glitter in her remorseless eye.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>

<p>If ever my heart vowed itself to Lilian, the vow was now the
most trustful and the most sacred. I had relinquished our
engagement before; but then her affection seemed, no matter from
what cause; so estranged from me, that though I might be miserable
to lose her, I deemed that she would be unhappy in our union. Then,
too, she was the gem and darling of the little world in which she
lived; no whisper assailed her: now I knew that she loved me; I
knew that her estrangement had been involuntary; I knew that
appearances wronged her, and that they never could be explained. I
was in the true position of man to woman: I was the shield, the
bulwark, the fearless confiding protector! Resign her now because
the world babbled, because my career might be impeded, because my
good name might be impeached,&mdash;resign her, and, in that
resignation, confirm all that was said against her! Could I do so,
I should be the most craven of gentlemen, the meanest of men!</p>

<p>I went to Mrs. Ashleigh, and entreated her to hasten my union
with her daughter, and fix the marriage-day.</p>

<p>I found the poor lady dejected and distressed. She was now
sufficiently relieved from the absorbing anxiety for Lilian to be
aware of the change on the face of that World which the woman I had
just quitted personified and concentred; she had learned the cause
from the bloodless lips of Miss Brabazon.</p>

<p>"My child! my poor child!" murmured the mother. "And she so
guileless,&mdash;so sensitive! Could she know what is said, it
would kill her. She would never marry you, Allen,&mdash;she would
never bring shame to you!"</p>

<p>"She never need learn the barbarous calumny. Give her to me, and
at once; patients, fortune, fame, are not found only at
L&mdash;&mdash;. Give her to me at once. But let me name a
condition: I have a patrimonial independence, I have amassed large
savings, I have my profession and my repute. I cannot touch her
fortune&mdash;I cannot,&mdash;never can! Take it while you live;
when you die, leave it to accumulate for her children, if children
she have; not to me; not to her&mdash;unless I am dead or
ruined!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Allen, what a heart! what a heart! No, not heart,
Allen,&mdash;that bird in its cage has a heart: soul&mdash;what a
soul!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIX.</h2>

<p>How innocent was Lilian's virgin blush when I knelt to her, and
prayed that she would forestall the date that had been fixed for
our union, and be my bride before the breath of the autumn had
withered the pomp of the woodland and silenced the song of the
birds! Meanwhile, I was so fearfully anxious that she should risk
no danger of hearing, even of surmising, the cruel slander against
her&mdash;should meet no cold contemptuous looks, above all, should
be safe from the barbed talk of Mrs. Poyntz&mdash;that I insisted
on the necessity of immediate change of air and scene. I proposed
that we should all three depart, the next day, for the banks of my
own beloved and native Windermere. By that pure mountain air,
Lilian's health would be soon re-established; in the church
hallowed to me by the graves of my fathers our vows should be
plighted. No calumny had ever cast a shadow over those graves. I
felt as if my bride would be safer in the neighbourhood of my
mother's tomb.</p>

<p>I carried my point: it was so arranged. Mrs. Ashleigh, however,
was reluctant to leave before she had seen her dear friend,
Margaret Poyntz. I had not the courage to tell her what she might
expect to hear from that dear friend, but, as delicately as I
could, I informed her that I had already seen the Queen of the
Hill, and contradicted the gossip that had reached her; but that as
yet, like other absolute sovereigns, the Queen of the Hill thought
it politic to go with the popular stream, reserving all check on
its direction till the rush of its torrent might slacken; and that
it would be infinitely wiser in Mrs. Ashleigh to postpone
conversation with Mrs. Poyntz until Lilian's return to
L&mdash;&mdash; as my wife. Slander by that time would have wearied
itself out, and Mrs. Poyntz (assuming her friendship to Mrs.
Ashleigh to be sincere) would then be enabled to say with authority
to her subjects, "Dr. Fenwick alone knows the facts of the story,
and his marriage with Miss Ashleigh refutes all the gossip to her
prejudice."</p>

<p>I made that evening arrangements with a young and rising
practitioner to secure attendance on my patients during my absence.
I passed the greater part of the night in drawing up memoranda to
guide my proxy in each case, however humble the sufferer. This task
finished, I chanced, in searching for a small microscope, the
wonders of which I thought might interest and amuse Lilian, to open
a drawer in which I kept the manuscript of my cherished
Physiological Work, and, in so doing, my eye fell upon the wand
which I had taken from Margrave. I had thrown it into that drawer
on my return home, after restoring Lilian to her mother's house,
and, in the anxiety which had subsequently preyed upon my mind, had
almost forgotten the strange possession I had as strangely
acquired. There it now lay, the instrument of agencies over the
mechanism of nature which no doctrine admitted by my philosophy
could accept, side by side with the presumptuous work which had
analyzed the springs by which Nature is moved, and decided the
principles by which reason metes out, from the inch of its
knowledge, the plan of the Infinite Unknown.</p>

<p>I took up the wand and examined it curiously. It was evidently
the work of an age far remote from our own, scored over with
half-obliterated characters in some Eastern tongue, perhaps no
longer extant. I found that it was hollow within. A more accurate
observation showed, in the centre of this hollow, an exceedingly
fine thread-like wire, the unattached end of which would slightly
touch the palm when the wand was taken into the hand. Was it
possible that there might be a natural and even a simple cause for
the effects which this instrument produced? Could it serve to
collect, from that great focus of animal heat and nervous energy
which is placed in the palm of the human hand, some such latent
fluid as that which Reichenbach calls the "odic," and which,
according to him, "rushes through and pervades universal Nature"?
After all, why not? For how many centuries lay unknown all the
virtues of the loadstone and the amber? It is but as yesterday that
the forces of vapour have become to men genii more powerful than
those conjured up by Aladdin; that light, at a touch, springs forth
from invisible air; that thought finds a messenger swifter than the
wings of the fabled Afrite. As, thus musing, my hand closed over
the wand, I felt a wild thrill through my frame. I recoiled; I was
alarmed lest (according to the plain common-sense theory of Julius
Faber) I might be preparing my imagination to form and to credit
its own illusions. Hastily I laid down the wand. But then it
occurred to me that whatever its properties, it had so served the
purposes of the dread Fascinator from whom it had been taken, that
he might probably seek to repossess himself of it; he might
contrive to enter my house in my absence; more prudent to guard in
my own watchful keeping the incomprehensible instrument of
incomprehensible arts. I resolved, therefore, to take the wand with
me, and placed it in my travelling-trunk, with such effects as I
selected for use in the excursion that was to commence with the
morrow. I now lay down to rest, but I could not sleep. The
recollections of the painful interview with Mrs. Poyntz became
vivid and haunting. It was clear that the sentiment she had
conceived for me was that of no simple friendship,&mdash;something
more or something less, but certainly something else; and this
conviction brought before me that proud hard face, disturbed by a
pang wrestled against but not subdued, and that clear metallic
voice, troubled by the quiver of an emotion which, perhaps, she had
never analyzed to herself. I did not need her own assurance to know
that this sentiment was not to be confounded with a love which she
would have despised as a weakness and repelled as a crime; it was
an inclination of the intellect, not a passion of the heart. But
still it admitted a jealousy little less keen than that which has
love for its cause,&mdash;so true it is that jealousy is never
absent where self-love is always present. Certainly, it was no
susceptibility of sober friendship which had made the stern
arbitress of a coterie ascribe to her interest in me her pitiless
judgment of Lilian. Strangely enough, with the image of this
archetype of conventional usages and the trite social life, came
that of the mysterious Margrave, surrounded by all the attributes
with which superstition clothes the being of the shadowy
border-land that lies beyond the chart of our visual world itself.
By what link were creatures so dissimilar riveted together in the
metaphysical chain of association? Both had entered into the record
of my life when my life admitted its own first romance of love.
Through the aid of this cynical schemer I had been made known to
Lilian. At her house I had heard the dark story of that Louis
Grayle, with whom, in mocking spite of my reason, conjectures,
which that very reason must depose itself before it could resolve
into distempered fancies, identified the enigmatical Margrave. And
now both she, the representative of the formal world most opposed
to visionary creeds, and he, who gathered round him all the terrors
which haunt the realm of fable, stood united against me,&mdash;foes
with whom the intellect I had so haughtily cultured knew not how to
cope. Whatever assault I might expect from either, I was unable to
assail again. Alike, then, in this, are the Slander and the
Phantom,&mdash;that which appalls us most in their power over us is
our impotence against them.</p>

<p>But up rose the sun, chasing the shadows from the earth, and
brightening insensibly the thoughts of man. After all, Margrave had
been baffled and defeated, whatever the arts he had practised and
the secrets he possessed. It was, at least, doubtful whether his
evil machinations would be renewed. He had seemed so incapable of
long-sustained fixity of purpose, that it was probable he was
already in pursuit of some new agent or victim; and as to this
commonplace and conventional spectre, the so-called World, if it is
everywhere to him whom it awes, it is nowhere to him who despises
it. What was the good or bad word of a Mrs. Poyntz to me? Ay, but
to Lilian? There, indeed, I trembled; but still, even in trembling,
it was sweet to think that my home would be her shelter,&mdash;my
choice her vindication. Ah! how unutterably tender and reverential
Love becomes when it assumes the duties of the guardian, and
hallows its own heart into a sanctuary of refuge for the
beloved!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LX.</h2>

<p>The beautiful lake! We two are on its grassy
margin,&mdash;twilight melting into night; the stars stealing
forth, one after one. What a wonderful change is made within us
when we come from our callings amongst men, chafed, wearied,
wounded; gnawed by our cares, perplexed by the doubts of our very
wisdom, stung by the adder that dwells in cities,&mdash;Slander;
nay, even if renowned, fatigued with the burden of the very names
that we have won! What a change is made within us when suddenly we
find ourselves transported into the calm solitudes of
Nature,&mdash;into scenes familiar to our happy dreaming childhood;
back, back from the dusty thoroughfares of our toil-worn manhood to
the golden fountain of our youth! Blessed is the change, even when
we have no companion beside us to whom the heart can whisper its
sense of relief and joy. But if the one in whom all our future is
garnered up be with us there, instead of that weary World which has
so magically vanished away from the eye and the thought, then does
the change make one of those rare epochs of life in which the charm
is the stillness. In the pause from all by which our own turbulent
struggles for happiness trouble existence, we feel with a rapt
amazement how calm a thing it is to be happy. And so as the night,
in deepening, brightened, Lilian and I wandered by the starry lake.
Conscious of no evil in ourselves, how secure we felt from evil! A
few days more&mdash;a few days more, and we two should be as one!
And that thought we uttered in many forms of words, brooding over
it in the long intervals of enamoured silence.</p>

<p>And when we turned back to the quiet inn at which we had taken
up our abode, and her mother, with her soft face, advanced to meet
us, I said to Lilian,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would that in these scenes we could fix our home for life, away
and afar from the dull town we have left behind us, with the fret
of its wearying cares and the jar of its idle babble!"</p>

<p>"And why not, Allen? Why not? But no, you would not be
happy."</p>

<p>"Not be happy, and with you? Sceptic, by what reasoning do you
arrive at that ungracious conclusion?"</p>

<p>"The heart loves repose and the soul contemplation, but the mind
needs action. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Where learned you that aphorism, out of place on such rosy
lips?"</p>

<p>"I learned it in studying you," murmured Lilian, tenderly.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Ashleigh joined us. For the first time I slept under
the same roof as Lilian. And I forgot that the universe contained
an enigma to solve or an enemy to fear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXI.</h2>

<p>Twenty days&mdash;the happiest my life had ever known&mdash;thus
glided on. Apart from the charm which love bestows on the beloved,
there was that in Lilian's conversation which made her a delightful
companion. Whether it was that, in this pause from the toils of my
career, my mind could more pliantly supple itself to her graceful
imagination, or that her imagination was less vague and dreamy
amidst those rural scenes, which realized in their loveliness and
grandeur its long-conceived ideals, than it had been in the petty
garden-ground neighboured by the stir and hubbub of the busy
town,&mdash;in much that I had once slighted or contemned as the
vagaries of undisciplined fancy, I now recognized the sparkle and
play of an intuitive genius, lighting up many a depth obscure to
instructed thought. It is with some characters as with the subtler
and more ethereal order of poets,&mdash;to appreciate them we must
suspend the course of artificial life; in the city we call them
dreamers, on the mountain-top we find them interpreters.</p>

<p>In Lilian, the sympathy with Nature was not, as in Margrave,
from the joyous sense of Nature's lavish vitality; it was refined
into exquisite perception of the diviner spirit by which that
vitality is informed. Thus, like the artist, from outward forms of
beauty she drew forth the covert types, lending to things the most
familiar exquisite meanings unconceived before. For it is truly
said by a wise critic of old, that "the attribute of Art is to
suggest infinitely more than it expresses;" and such suggestions,
passing from the artist's innermost thought into the mind that
receives them, open on and on into the Infinite of Ideas, as a
moonlit wave struck by a passing oar impels wave upon wave along
one track of light.</p>

<p>So the days glided by, and brought the eve of our bridal morn.
It had been settled that, after the ceremony (which was to be
performed by license in the village church, at no great distance,
which adjoined my paternal home, now passed away to strangers), we
should make a short excursion into Scotland, leaving Mrs. Ashleigh
to await our return at the little inn.</p>

<p>I had retired to my own room to answer some letters from anxious
patients, and having finished these I looked into my trunk for a
Guide-Book to the North, which I had brought with me. My hand came
upon Margrave's wand, and remembering that strange thrill which had
passed through me when I last handled it, I drew it forth, resolved
to examine calmly if I could detect the cause of the sensation. It
was not now the time of night in which the imagination is most
liable to credulous impressions, nor was I now in the anxious and
jaded state of mind in which such impressions may be the more
readily conceived. The sun was slowly setting over the delicious
landscape; the air cool and serene; my thoughts
collected,&mdash;heart and conscience alike at peace. I took, then,
the wand, and adjusted it to the palm of the hand as I had done
before. I felt the slight touch of the delicate wire within, and
again the thrill! I did not this time recoil; I continued to grasp
the wand, and sought deliberately to analyze my own sensations in
the contact. There came over me an increased consciousness of vital
power; a certain exhilaration, elasticity, vigour, such as a strong
cordial may produce on a fainting man. All the forces of my frame
seemed refreshed, redoubled; and as such effects on the physical
system are ordinarily accompanied by correspondent effects on the
mind, so I was sensible of a proud elation of spirits,&mdash;a kind
of defying, superb self-glorying. All fear seemed blotted out from
my thought, as a weakness impossible to the grandeur and might
which belong to Intellectual Man; I felt as if it were a royal
delight to scorn Earth and its opinions, brave Hades and its
spectres. Rapidly this new-born arrogance enlarged itself into
desires vague but daring. My mind reverted to the wild phenomena
associated with its memories of Margrave. I said half-aloud, "if a
creature so beneath myself in constancy of will and completion of
thought can wrest from Nature favours so marvellous, what could not
be won from her by me, her patient persevering seeker? What if
there be spirits around and about, invisible to the common eye, but
whom we can submit to our control; and what if this rod be charged
with some occult fluid, that runs through all creation, and can be
so disciplined as to establish communication wherever life and
thought can reach to beings that live and think? So would the
mystics of old explain what perplexes me. Am I sure that the
mystics of old duped them selves or their pupils? This, then, this
slight wand, light as a reed in my grasp, this, then, was the
instrument by which Margrave sent his irresistible will through air
and space, and by which I smote himself, in the midst of his
tiger-like wrath, into the helplessness of a sick man's swoon! Can
the instrument at this distance still control him; if now
meditating evil, disarm and disable his purpose?" Involuntarily, as
I revolved these ideas, I stretched forth the wand, with a
concentred energy of desire that its influence should reach
Margrave and command him. And since I knew not his whereabout, yet
was vaguely aware that, according to any conceivable theory by
which the wand could be supposed to carry its imagined virtues to
definite goals in distant space, it should be pointed in the
direction of the object it was intended to affect, so I slowly
moved the wand as if describing a circle; and thus, in some point
of the circle&mdash;east, west, north, or south&mdash;the direction
could not fail to be true. Before I had performed half the circle,
the wand of itself stopped, resisting palpably the movement of my
hand to impel it onward. Had it, then, found the point to which my
will was guiding it, obeying my will by some magnetic sympathy
never yet comprehended by any recognized science? I know not; but I
had not held it thus fixed for many seconds, before a cold air,
well remembered, passed by me, stirring the roots of my hair; and,
reflected against the opposite wall, stood the hateful Scin-Laeca.
The Shadow was dimmer in its light than when before beheld, and the
outline of the features was less distinct; still it was the
unmistakable lemur, or image, of Margrave.</p>

<p>And a voice was conveyed to my senses, saying, as from a great
distance, and in weary yet angry accents,</p>

<p>"You have summoned me? Wherefore?"</p>

<p>I overcame the startled shudder with which, at first, I beheld
the Shadow and heard the Voice.</p>

<p>"I summoned you not," said I; "I sought but to impose upon you
my will, that you should persecute, with your ghastly influences,
me and mine no more. And now, by whatever authority this wand
bestows on me, I so abjure and command you!"</p>

<p>I thought there was a sneer of disdain on the lip through which
the answer seemed to come,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vain and ignorant, it is but a shadow you command. My body you
have cast into a sleep, and it knows not that the shadow is here;
nor, when it wakes, will the brain be aware of one reminiscence of
the words that you utter or the words that you hear."</p>

<p>"What, then, is this shadow that simulates the body? Is it that
which in popular language is called the soul?"</p>

<p>"It is not: soul is no shadow."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Ask not me. Use the wand to invoke Intelligences higher than
mine."</p>

<p>"And how?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you not. Of yourself you may learn, if you guide
the wand by your own pride of will and desire; but in the hands of
him who has learned not the art, the wand has its dangers. Again I
say you have summoned me! Wherefore?"</p>

<p>"Lying shade, I summoned thee not."</p>

<p>"So wouldst thou say to the demons, did they come in their
terrible wrath, when the bungler, who knows not the springs that he
moves, calls them up unawares, and can neither control nor dispel.
Less revengeful than they, I leave thee unharmed, and depart."</p>

<p>"Stay. If, as thou sayest, no command I address to thee&mdash;to
thee, who art only the image or shadow&mdash;can have effect on the
body and mind of the being whose likeness thou art, still thou
canst tell me what passes now in his brain. Does it now harbour
schemes against me through the woman I love? Answer truly."</p>

<p>"I reply for the sleeper, of whom I am more than a likeness,
though only the shadow. His thought speaks thus: 'I know, Allen
Fenwick, that in thee is the agent I need for achieving the end
that I seek. Through the woman thou lovest, I hope to subject thee.
A grief that will harrow thy heart is at hand; when that grief
shall befall, thou wilt welcome my coming. In me alone thy hope
will be placed; through me alone wilt thou seek a path out of thy
sorrow. I shall ask my conditions: they will make thee my tool and
my slave!'"</p>

<p>The shadow waned,&mdash;it was gone. I did not seek to detain
it, nor, had I sought, could I have known by what process. But a
new idea now possessed me. This shadow, then, that had once so
appalled and controlled me, was, by its own confession, nothing
more than a shadow! It had spoken of higher Intelligences; from
them I might learn what the Shadow could not reveal. As I still
held the wand firmer and firmer in my grasp, my thoughts grew
haughtier and bolder. Could the wand, then, bring those loftier
beings thus darkly referred to before me? With that thought,
intense and engrossing, I guided the wand towards the space,
opening boundless and blue from the casement that let in the skies.
The wand no longer resisted my hand.</p>

<p>In a few moments I felt the floors of the room vibrate; the air
was darkened; a vaporous, hazy cloud seemed to rise from the ground
without the casement; an awe, infinitely more deep and solemn than
that which the Scin-Laeca had caused in its earliest apparition,
curdled through my veins, and stilled the very beat of my
heart.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard, without, the voice of Lilian, singing a
simple, sacred song which I had learned at my mother's knees, and
taught to her the day before: singing low, and as with a warning
angel's voice. By an irresistible impulse I dashed the wand to the
ground, and bowed my head as I had bowed it when my infant mind
comprehended, without an effort, mysteries more solemn than those
which perplexed me now. Slowly I raised my eyes, and looked round;
the vaporous, hazy cloud had passed away, or melted into the
ambient rose-tints amidst which the sun had sunk.</p>

<p>Then, by one of those common reactions from a period of
overstrained excitement, there succeeded to that sentiment of
arrogance and daring with which these wild, half-conscious
invocations had been fostered and sustained, a profound humility, a
warning fear.</p>

<p>"What!" said I, inly, "have all those sound resolutions, which
my reason founded on the wise talk of Julius Faber, melted away in
the wrack of haggard, dissolving fancies! Is this my boasted
intellect, my vaunted science! I&mdash;I, Allen Fenwick, not only
the credulous believer, but the blundering practitioner, of an evil
magic! Grant what may be possible, however
uncomprehended,&mdash;grant that in this accursed instrument of
antique superstition there be some real powers&mdash;chemical,
magnetic, no matter what&mdash;by which the imagination can be
aroused, inflamed, deluded, so that it shapes the things I have
seen, speaks in the tones I have heard,&mdash;grant this, shall I
keep ever ready, at the caprice of will, a constant tempter to
steal away my reason and fool my senses? Or if, on the other hand,
I force my sense to admit what all sober men must reject; if I
unschool myself to believe that in what I have just experienced
there is no mental illusion; that sorcery is a fact, and a demon
world has gates which open to a key that a mortal can
forge,&mdash;who but a saint would not shrink from the practice of
powers by which each passing thought of ill might find in a fiend
its abettor? In either case&mdash;in any case&mdash;while I keep
this direful relic of obsolete arts, I am haunted,&mdash;cheated
out of my senses, unfitted for the uses of life. If, as my ear or
my fancy informs me, grief&mdash;human grief&mdash;is about to
befall me, shall I, in the sting of impatient sorrow, have recourse
to an aid which, the same voice declares, will reduce me to a tool
and a slave,&mdash;tool and slave to a being I dread as a foe? Out
on these nightmares! and away with the thing that bewitches the
brain to conceive them!"</p>

<p>I rose; I took up the wand, holding it so that its hollow should
not rest on the palm of the hand. I stole from the house by the
back way, in order to avoid Lilian, whose voice I still heard,
singing low, on the lawn in front. I came to a creek, to the bank
of which a boat was moored, undid its chain, rowed on to a deep
part of the lake, and dropped the wand into its waves. It sank at
once; scarcely a ripple furrowed the surface, not a bubble arose
from the deep. And, as the boat glided on, the star mirrored itself
on the spot where the placid waters had closed over the tempter to
evil.</p>

<p>Light at heart, I sprang again on the shore, and hastening to
Lilian, where she stood on the silvered, shining sward, clasped her
to my breast.</p>

<p>"Spirit of my life!" I murmured, "no enchantments for me but
thine! Thine are the spells by which creation is beautified, and,
in that beauty, hallowed. What though we can see not into the
measureless future from the verge of the moment; what though sorrow
may smite us while we are dreaming of bliss, let the future not rob
me of thee, and a balm will be found for each wound! Love me ever
as now, oh, my Lilian; troth to troth, side by side, till the
grave!"</p>

<p>"And beyond the grave," answered Lilian, softly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXII.</h2>

<p>Our vows are exchanged at the altar, the rite which made Lilian
my wife is performed; we are returned from the church amongst the
hills, in which my fathers had worshipped; the joy-bells that had
pealed for my birth had rung for my marriage. Lilian has gone to
her room to prepare for our bridal excursion; while the carriage we
have hired is waiting at the door. I am detaining her mother on the
lawn, seeking to cheer and compose her spirits, painfully affected
by that sense of change in the relations of child and parent which
makes itself suddenly felt by the parent's heart on the day that
secures to the child another heart on which to lean.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Ashleigh's was one of those gentle womanly natures
which, if easily afflicted, are easily consoled. And, already
smiling through her tears, she was about to quit me and join her
daughter, when one of the inn-servants came to me with some
letters, which had just been delivered by the postman. As I took
them from the servant, Mrs. Ashleigh asked if there were any for
her. She expected one from her housekeeper at L&mdash;&mdash;, who
had been taken ill in her absence, and about whom the kind mistress
felt anxious. The servant replied that there was no letter for her,
but one directed to Miss Ashleigh, which he had just sent up to the
young lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashleigh did not doubt that her housekeeper had written to
Lilian, whom she had known from the cradle and to whom she was
tenderly attached, instead of to her mistress; and, saying
something to me to that effect, quickened her steps towards the
house.</p>

<p>I was glancing over my own letters, chiefly from patients, with
a rapid eye, when a cry of agony, a cry as if of one suddenly
stricken to the heart, pierced my ear,&mdash;a cry from within the
house. "Heavens! was that Lilian's voice?" The same doubt struck
Mrs. Ashleigh, who had already gained the door. She rushed on,
disappearing within the threshold and calling to me to follow. I
bounded forward, passed her on the stairs, was in Lilian's room
before her.</p>

<p>My bride was on the floor prostrate, insensible: so still, so
colourless, that my first dreadful thought was that life had gone.
In her hand was a letter, crushed as with a convulsive sudden
grasp.</p>

<p>It was long before the colour came back to her cheek, before the
breath was perceptible on her lip. She woke, but not to health, not
to sense. Hours were passed in violent convulsions, in which I
momentarily feared her death. To these succeeded stupor, lethargy,
not benignant sleep. That night, my bridal night, I passed as in
some chamber to which I had been summoned to save youth from the
grave. At length&mdash;at length&mdash;life was rescued, was
assured! Life came back, but the mind was gone. She knew me not,
nor her mother. She spoke little and faintly; in the words she
uttered there was no reason.</p>

<p>I pass hurriedly on; my experience here was in fault, my skill
ineffectual. Day followed day, and no ray came back to the darkened
brain. We bore her, by gentle stages, to London. I was sanguine of
good result from skill more consummate than mine, and more
especially devoted to diseases of the mind. I summoned the first
advisers. In vain! in vain!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.</h2>

<p>And the cause of this direful shock? Not this time could it be
traced to some evil spell, some phantasmal influence. The cause was
clear, and might have produced effects as sinister on nerves of
stronger fibre if accompanied by a heart as delicately sensitive,
an honour as exquisitely pure.</p>

<p>The letter found in her hand was without name; it was dated from
L&mdash;&mdash;, and bore the postmark of that town. It conveyed to
Lilian, in the biting words which female malice can make so sharp,
the tale we had sought sedulously to guard from her ear,&mdash;her
flight, the construction that scandal put upon it. It affected for
my blind infatuation a contemptuous pity; it asked her to pause
before she brought on the name I offered to her an indelible
disgrace. If she so decided, she was warned not to return to
L&mdash;&mdash;, or to prepare there for the sentence that would
exclude her from the society of her own sex. I cannot repeat more,
I cannot minute down all that the letter expressed or implied, to
wither the orange blossoms in a bride's wreath. The heart that took
in the venom cast its poison on the brain, and the mind fled before
the presence of a thought so deadly to all the ideas which its
innocence had heretofore conceived.</p>

<p>I knew not whom to suspect of the malignity of this mean and
miserable outrage, nor did I much care to know. The handwriting,
though evidently disguised, was that of a woman, and, therefore,
had I discovered the author, my manhood would have forbidden me the
idle solace of revenge. Mrs. Poyntz, however resolute and pitiless
her hostility when once aroused, was not without a certain
largeness of nature irreconcilable with the most dastardly of all
the weapons that envy or hatred can supply to the vile. She had too
lofty a self-esteem and too decorous a regard for the moral
sentiment of the world that she typified, to do, or connive at, an
act which degrades the gentlewoman. Putting her aside, what other
female enemy had Lilian provoked? No matter! What other woman at
L&mdash;&mdash; was worth the condescension of a conjecture?</p>

<p>After listening to all that the ablest of my professional
brethren in the metropolis could suggest to guide me, and trying in
vain their remedies, I brought back my charge to L&mdash;&mdash;.
Retaining my former residence for the visits of patients, I
engaged, for the privacy of my home, a house two miles from the
town, secluded in its own grounds, and guarded by high walls.</p>

<p>Lilian's mother removed to my mournful dwelling-place. Abbot's
House, in the centre of that tattling coterie, had become
distasteful to her, and to me it was associated with thoughts of
anguish and of terror. I could not, without a shudder, have entered
its grounds,&mdash;could not, without a stab at the heart, have
seen again the old fairy-land round the Monks' Well, nor the dark
cedar-tree under which Lilian's hand had been placed in mine; and a
superstitious remembrance, banished while Lilian's angel face had
brightened the fatal precincts, now revived in full force. The
dying man's curse&mdash;had it not been fulfilled?</p>

<p>A new occupant for the old house was found within a week after
Mrs. Ashleigh had written from London to a house-agent at
L&mdash;&mdash;, intimating her desire to dispose of the lease.
Shortly before we had gone to Windermere, Miss Brabazon had become
enriched by a liberal life-annuity bequeathed to her by her uncle,
Sir Phelim. Her means thus enabled her to move from the
comparatively humble lodging she had hitherto occupied to Abbot's
House; but just as she had there commenced a series of ostentatious
entertainments, implying an ambitious desire to dispute with Mrs.
Poyntz the sovereignty of the Hill, she was attacked by some severe
malady which appeared complicated with spinal disease, and after my
return to L&mdash;&mdash; I sometimes met her, on the spacious
platform of the Hill, drawn along slowly in a Bath chair, her livid
face peering forth from piles of Indian shawls and Siberian furs,
and the gaunt figure of Dr. Jones stalking by her side, taciturn
and gloomy as some sincere mourner who conducts to the grave the
patron on whose life he himself had conveniently lived. It was in
the dismal month of February that I returned to L&mdash;&mdash;,
and I took possession of my plighted nuptial home on the
anniversary of the very day in which I had passed through the dead
dumb world from the naturalist's gloomy death-room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.</h2>

<p>Lilian's wondrous gentleness of nature did not desert her in the
suspension of her reason. She was habitually calm,&mdash;very
silent; when she spoke it was rarely on earthly things, on things
familiar to her past, things one could comprehend. Her thought
seemed to have quitted the earth, seeking refuge in some imaginary
heaven. She spoke of wanderings with her father as if he were
living still; she did not seem to understand the meaning we attach
to the word "Death." She would sit for hours murmuring to herself:
when one sought to catch the words, they seemed in converse with
invisible spirits. We found it cruel to disturb her at such times,
for if left unmolested, her face was serene,&mdash;more serenely
beautiful than I had seen it even in our happiest hours; but when
we called her back to the wrecks of her real life, her eye became
troubled, restless, anxious, and she would sigh&mdash;oh, so
heavily! At times, if we did not seem to observe her, she would
quietly resume her once favourite accomplishments,&mdash;drawing,
music. And in these her young excellence was still apparent, only
the drawings were strange and fantastic: they had a resemblance to
those with which the painter Blake, himself a visionary,
illustrated the Poems of the "Night Thoughts" and "The
Grave,"&mdash;faces of exquisite loveliness, forms of aerial grace,
coming forth from the bells of flowers, or floating upwards amidst
the spray of fountains, their outlines melting away in fountain or
in flower. So with her music: her mother could not recognize the
airs she played, for a while so sweetly and with so ineffable a
pathos, that one could scarcely hear her without weeping; and then
would come, as if involuntarily, an abrupt discord, and, starting,
she would cease and look around, disquieted, aghast.</p>

<p>And still she did not recognize Mrs. Ashleigh nor myself as her
mother, her husband; but she had by degrees learned to distinguish
us both from others. To her mother she gave no name, seemed pleased
to see her, but not sensibly to miss her when away; me she called
her brother: if longer absent than usual, me she missed. When,
after the toils of the day, I came to join her, even if she spoke
not, her sweet face brightened. When she sang, she beckoned me to
come near to her, and looked at me fixedly, with eyes ever tender,
often tearful; when she drew she would pause and glance over her
shoulder to see that I was watching her, and point to the drawings
with a smile of strange significance, as if they conveyed in some
covert allegory messages meant for me; so, at least, I interpreted
her smile, and taught myself to say, "Yes, Lilian, I
understand!"</p>

<p>And more than once, when I had so answered, she rose, and kissed
my forehead. I thought my heart would have broken when I felt that
spirit-like melancholy kiss.</p>

<p>And yet how marvellously the human mind teaches itself to
extract consolations from its sorrows. The least wretched of my
hours were those that I had passed in that saddened room, seeking
how to establish fragments of intercourse, invent signs, by which
each might interpret each, between the intellect I had so
laboriously cultured, so arrogantly vaunted, and the fancies
wandering through the dark, deprived of their guide in reason. It
was something even of joy to feel myself needed for her
guardianship, endeared and yearned for still by some unshattered
instinct of her heart; and when, parting from her for the night, I
stole the moment in which on her soft face seemed resting least of
shadow, to ask, in a trembling whisper, "Lilian, are the angels
watching over you?" and she would answer "Yes," sometimes in words,
sometimes with a mysterious happy smile&mdash;then&mdash;then I
went to my lonely room, comforted and thankful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXV.</h2>

<p>The blow that had fallen on my hearth effectually, inevitably
killed all the slander that might have troubled me in joy. Before
the awe of a great calamity the small passions of a mean malignity
slink abashed. I had requested Mrs. Ashleigh not to mention the
vile letter which Lilian had received. I would not give a triumph
to the unknown calumniator, nor wring forth her vain remorse, by
the pain of acknowledging an indignity to my darling's honour; yet,
somehow or other, the true cause of Lilian's affliction had crept
out,&mdash;perhaps through the talk of servants,&mdash;and the
public shock was universal. By one of those instincts of justice
that lie deep in human hearts, though in ordinary moments overlaid
by many a worldly layer, all felt (all mothers felt especially)
that innocence alone could have been so unprepared for reproach.
The explanation I had previously given, discredited then, was now
accepted without a question. Lilian's present state accounted for
all that ill nature had before misconstrued. Her good name was
restored to its maiden whiteness, by the fate that had severed the
ties of the bride. The formal dwellers on the Hill vied with the
franker, warmer-hearted households of Low Town in the nameless
attentions by which sympathy and respect are rather delicately
indicated than noisily proclaimed. Could Lilian have then recovered
and been sensible of its repentant homage, how reverently that
petty world would have thronged around her! And, ah! could fortune
and man's esteem have atoned for the blight of hopes that had been
planted and cherished on ground beyond their reach, ambition and
pride might have been well contented with the largeness of the
exchange that courted their acceptance. Patients on patients
crowded on me. Sympathy with my sorrow seemed to create and endear
a more trustful belief in my skill. But the profession I had once
so enthusiastically loved became to me wearisome, insipid,
distasteful; the kindness heaped on me gave no comfort,&mdash;it
but brought before me more vividly the conviction that it came too
late to avail me: it could not restore to me the mind, the love,
the life of my life, which lay dark and shattered in the brain of
my guileless Lilian. Secretly I felt a sullen resentment. I knew
that to the crowd the resentment was unjust. The world itself is
but an appearance; who can blame it if appearances guide its laws?
But to those who had been detached from the crowd by the
professions of friendship,&mdash;those who, when the slander was
yet new, and might have been awed into silence had they stood by my
side,&mdash;to the pressure of their hands, now, I had no
response.</p>

<p>Against Mrs. Poyntz, above all others, I bore a remembrance of
unrelaxed, unmitigable indignation. Her schemes for her daughter's
marriage had triumphed: Jane was Mrs. Ashleigh Sumner. Her mind
was, perhaps, softened now that the object which had sharpened its
worldly faculties was accomplished: but in vain, on first hearing
of my affliction, had this she-Machiavel owned a humane remorse,
and, with all her keen comprehension of each facility that
circumstances gave to her will, availed herself of the general
compassion to strengthen the popular reaction in favour of Lilian's
assaulted honour; in vain had she written to me with a gentleness
of sympathy foreign to her habitual characteristics; in vain
besought me to call on her; in vain waylaid and accosted me with a
humility that almost implored forgiveness. I vouchsafed no
reproach, but I could imply no pardon. I put between her and my
great sorrow the impenetrable wall of my freezing silence.</p>

<p>One word of hers at the time that I had so pathetically besought
her aid, and the parrot-flock that repeated her very whisper in
noisy shrillness would have been as loud to defend as it had been
to defame; that vile letter might never have been written. Whoever
its writer, it surely was one of the babblers who took their malice
itself from the jest or the nod of their female despot; and the
writer might have justified herself in saying she did but coarsely
proclaim what the oracle of worldly opinion, and the early friend
of Lilian's own mother, had authorized her to believe.</p>

<p>By degrees, the bitterness at my heart diffused itself to the
circumference of the circle in which my life went its cheerless
mechanical round. That cordial brotherhood with his patients, which
is the true physician's happiest gift and humanest duty, forsook my
breast. The warning words of Mrs. Poyntz had come true. A patient
that monopolized my thought awaited me at my own hearth! My
conscience became troubled; I felt that my skill was lessened. I
said to myself, "The physician who, on entering the sick-room,
feels, while there, something that distracts the finest powers of
his intellect from the sufferer's case is unfit for his calling." A
year had scarcely passed since my fatal wedding day, before I had
formed a resolution to quit L&mdash;&mdash; and abandon my
profession; and my resolution was confirmed, and my goal
determined, by a letter I received from Julius Faber.</p>

<p>I had written at length to him, not many days after the blow
that had fallen on me, stating all circumstances as calmly and
clearly as my grief would allow; for I held his skill at a higher
estimate than that of any living brother of my art, and I was not
without hope in the efficacy of his advice. The letter I now
received from him had been begun, and continued at some length,
before my communication reached him; and this earlier portion
contained animated and cheerful descriptions of his Australian life
and home, which contrasted with the sorrowful tone of the
supplement written in reply to the tidings with which I had wrung
his friendly and tender heart. In this, the latter part of his
letter, he suggested that if time had wrought no material change
for the better, it might be advisable to try the effect of foreign
travel. Scenes entirely new might stimulate observation, and the
observation of things external withdraw the sense from that
brooding over images delusively formed within, which characterized
the kind of mental alienation I had described. "Let any intellect
create for itself a visionary world, and all reasonings built on it
are fallacious: the visionary world vanishes in proportion as we
can arouse a predominant interest in the actual."</p>

<p>This grand authority, who owed half his consummate skill as a
practitioner to the scope of his knowledge as a philosopher, then
proceeded to give me a hope which I had not dared of myself to
form. He said:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "I distinguish the case you so minutely detail from that insanity which
    is reason lost; here it seems rather to be reason held in suspense.
    Where there is hereditary predisposition, where there is organic
    change of structure in the brain,&mdash;nay, where there is that kind of
    insanity which takes the epithet of moral, whereby the whole
    character becomes so transformed that the prime element of sound
    understanding, conscience itself, is either erased or warped into the
    sanction of what in a healthful state it would most disapprove,&mdash;it is
    only charlatans who promise effectual cure.  But here I assume that
    there is no hereditary taint; here I am convinced, from my own
    observation, that the nobility of the organs, all fresh as yet in the
    vigour of youth, would rather submit to death than to the permanent
    overthrow of their equilibrium in reason; here, where you tell me the
    character preserves all its moral attributes of gentleness and purity,
    and but over-indulges its own early habit of estranged contemplation;
    here, without deceiving you in false kindness, I give you the
    guarantee of my experience when I bid you 'hope!'  I am persuaded
    that, sooner or later, the mind, thus for a time affected, will right
    itself; because here, in the cause of the malady, we do but deal with
    the nervous system.  And that, once righted, and the mind once
    disciplined in those practical duties which conjugal life
    necessitates, the malady itself will never return; never be
    transmitted to the children on whom your wife's restoration to health
    may permit you to count hereafter.  If the course of travel I
    recommend and the prescriptions I conjoin with that course fail you,
    let me know; and though I would fain close my days in this land, I
    will come to you.  I love you as my son.  I will tend your wife as my
    daughter."

</pre>

<p>Foreign travel! The idea smiled on me. Julius Faber's
companionship, sympathy, matchless skill! The very thought seemed
as a raft to a drowning mariner. I now read more attentively the
earlier portions of his letter. They described, in glowing colours,
the wondrous country in which he had fixed his home; the joyous
elasticity of its atmosphere; the freshness of its primitive,
pastoral life; the strangeness of its scenery, with a Flora and a
Fauna which have no similitudes in the ransacked quarters of the
Old World. And the strong impulse seized me to transfer to the
solitudes of that blithesome and hardy Nature a spirit no longer at
home in the civilized haunts of men, and household gods that shrank
from all social eyes, and would fain have found a wilderness for
the desolate hearth, on which they had ceased to be sacred if
unveiled. As if to give practical excuse and reason for the idea
that seized me, Julius Faber mentioned, incidentally, that the
house and property of a wealthy speculator in his immediate
neighbourhood were on sale at a price which seemed to me alluringly
trivial, and, according to his judgment, far below the value they
would soon reach in the hands of a more patient capitalist. He
wrote at the period of the agricultural panic in the colony which
preceded the discovery of its earliest gold-fields. But his
geological science had convinced him that strata within and around
the property now for sale were auriferous, and his intelligence
enabled him to predict how inevitably man would be attracted
towards the gold, and how surely the gold would fertilize the soil
and enrich its owners. He described the house thus to be
sold&mdash;in case I might know of a purchaser. It had been built
at a cost unusual in those early times, and by one who clung to
English tastes amidst Australian wilds, so that in this purchase a
settler would escape the hardships he had then ordinarily to
encounter; it was, in short, a home to which a man more luxurious
than I might bear a bride with wants less simple than those which
now sufficed for my darling Lilian.</p>

<p>This communication dwelt on my mind through the avocations of
the day on which I received it, and in the evening I read all,
except the supplement, aloud to Mrs. Ashleigh in her daughter's
presence. I desired to see if Faber's descriptions of the country
and its life, which in themselves were extremely spirited and
striking, would arouse Lilian's interest. At first she did not seem
to heed me while I read; but when I came to Faber's loving account
of little Amy, Lilian turned her eyes towards me, and evidently
listened with attention. He wrote how the child had already become
the most useful person in the simple household. How watchful the
quickness of the heart had made the service of the eye; all their
associations of comfort had grown round her active, noiseless
movements; it was she who had contrived to monopolize the
management, or supervision, of all that added to Home the nameless,
interior charm. Under her eyes the rude furniture of the log-house
grew inviting with English neatness; she took charge of the dairy;
she had made the garden gay with flowers selected from the wild,
and suggested the trellised walk, already covered with hardy vine.
She was their confidant in every plan of improvement, their
comforter in every anxious doubt, their nurse in every passing
ailment, her very smile a refreshment in the weariness of daily
toil. "How all that is best in womanhood," wrote the old man, with
the enthusiasm which no time had reft from his hearty, healthful
genius,&mdash;"how all that is best in womanhood is here opening
fast into flower from the bud of the infant's soul! The atmosphere
seems to suit it,&mdash;the child-woman in the child-world!"</p>

<p>I heard Lilian sigh; I looked towards her furtively; tears stood
in her softened eyes; her lip was quivering. Presently, she began
to rub her right hand over the left&mdash;over the
wedding-ring&mdash;at first slowly; then with quicker movement.</p>

<p>"It is not here," she said impatiently; "it is not here!"</p>

<p>"What is not here?" asked Mrs. Ashleigh, hanging over her.</p>

<p>Lilian leaned back her head on her mother's bosom, and answered
faintly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"The stain! Some one said there was a stain on this hand. I do
not see it, do you?"</p>

<p>"There is no stain, never was," said I; "the hand is white as
your own innocence, or the lily from which you take your name."</p>

<p>"Hush! you do not know my name. I will whisper it.
Soft!&mdash;my name is Nightshade! Do you want to know where the
lily is now, brother? I will tell you. There, in that letter. You
call her Amy,&mdash;she is the lily; take her to your breast, hide
her. Hist! what are those bells? Marriage-bells. Do not let her
hear them; for there is a cruel wind that whispers the bells, and
the bells ring out what it whispers, louder and louder,</p>

<pre>
"'Stain on lily  Shame on lily,
  Wither lily.'
</pre>

<p>"If she hears what the wind whispers to the bells, she will
creep away into the dark, and then she, too, will turn to
Nightshade."</p>

<p>"Lilian, look up, awake! You have been in a long, long dream: it
is passing away. Lilian, my beloved, my blessed Lilian!"</p>

<p>Never till then had I heard from her even so vague an allusion
to the fatal calumny and its dreadful effect, and while her words
now pierced my heart, it beat, amongst its pangs, with a thrilling
hope.</p>

<p>But, alas! the idea that had gleamed upon her had vanished
already. She murmured something about Circles of Fire, and a Veiled
Woman in black garments; became restless, agitated, and unconscious
of our presence, and finally sank into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>That night (my room was next to hers with the intervening door
open) I heard her cry out. I hastened to her side. She was still
asleep, but there was an anxious labouring expression on her young
face, and yet not an expression wholly of pain&mdash;for her lips
were parted with a smile,&mdash;that glad yet troubled smile with
which one who has been revolving some subject of perplexity or fear
greets a sudden thought that seems to solve the riddle, or prompt
the escape from danger; and as I softly took her hand she returned
my gentle pressure, and inclining towards me, said, still in
sleep,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let us go."</p>

<p>"Whither?" I answered, under my breath, so as not to awake her;
"is it to see the child of whom I read, and the land that is
blooming out of the earth's childhood?"</p>

<p>"Out of the dark into the light; where the leaves do not change;
where the night is our day, and the winter our summer. Let us go!
let us go!"</p>

<p>"We will go. Dream on undisturbed, my bride. Oh, that the dream
could tell you that my love has not changed in our sorrow, holier
and deeper than on the day in which our vows were exchanged! In you
still all my hopes fold their wings; where you are, there still I
myself have my dreamland!"</p>

<p>The sweet face grew bright as I spoke; all trouble left the
smile; softly she drew her hand from my clasp, and rested it for a
moment on my bended head, as if in blessing.</p>

<p>I rose; stole back to my own room, closing the door, lest the
sob I could not stifle should mar her sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.</h2>

<p>I unfolded my new prospects to Mrs. Ashleigh. She was more
easily reconciled to them than I could have supposed, judging by
her habits, which were naturally indolent, and averse to all that
disturbed their even tenor. But the great grief which had befallen
her had roused up that strength of devotion which lies dormant in
all hearts that are capable of loving another more than self. With
her full consent I wrote to Faber, communicating my intentions,
instructing him to purchase the property he had so commended, and
inclosing my banker's order for the amount, on an Australian firm.
I now announced my intention to retire from my profession; made
prompt arrangements with a successor to my practice; disposed of my
two houses at L&mdash;&mdash;; fixed the day of my departure.
Vanity was dead within me, or I might have been gratified by the
sensation which the news of my design created. My faults became at
once forgotten; such good qualities as I might possess were
exaggerated. The public regret vented and consoled itself in a
costly testimonial, to which even the poorest of my patients
insisted on the privilege to contribute, graced with an inscription
flattering enough to have served for the epitaph on some great
man's tomb. No one who has served an art and striven for a name is
a stoic to the esteem of others; and sweet indeed would such
honours have been to me had not publicity itself seemed a wrong to
the sanctity of that affliction which set Lilian apart from the
movement and the glories of the world.</p>

<p>The two persons most active in "getting up" this testimonial
were, nominally, Colonel Poyntz&mdash;in truth, his wife&mdash;and
my old disparager, Mr. Vigors! It is long since my narrative has
referred to Mr. Vigors. It is due to him now to state that, in his
capacity of magistrate, and in his own way, he had been both active
and delicate in the inquiries set on foot for Lilian during the
unhappy time in which she had wandered, spellbound, from her home.
He, alone, of all the more influential magnates of the town, had
upheld her innocence against the gossips that aspersed it; and
during the last trying year of my residence at L&mdash;&mdash;, he
had sought me, with frank and manly confessions of his regret for
his former prejudice against me, and assurances of the respect in
which he had held me ever since my marriage&mdash;marriage but in
rite&mdash;with Lilian. He had then, strong in his ruling passion,
besought me to consult his clairvoyants as to her case. I declined
this invitation so as not to affront him,&mdash;declined it, not as
I should once have done, but with no word nor look of incredulous
disdain. The fact was, that I had conceived a solemn terror of all
practices and theories out of the beaten track of sense and
science. Perhaps in my refusal I did wrong. I know not. I was
afraid of my own imagination. He continued not less friendly in
spite of my refusal. And, such are the vicissitudes in human
feeling, I parted from him whom I had regarded as my most bigoted
foe with a warmer sentiment of kindness than for any of those on
whom I had counted on friendship. He had not deserted Lilian. It
was not so with Mrs. Poyntz. I would have paid tenfold the value of
the testimonial to have erased, from the list of those who
subscribed to it, her husband's name.</p>

<p>The day before I quitted L&mdash;&mdash;, and some weeks after I
had, in fact, renounced my practice, I received an urgent entreaty
from Miss Brabazon to call on her. She wrote in lines so blurred
that I could with difficulty decipher them, that she was very ill,
given over by Dr. Jones, who had been attending her. She implored
my opinion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVII.</h2>

<p>On reaching the house, a formal man-servant, with indifferent
face, transferred me to the guidance of a hired nurse, who led me
up the stairs, and, before I was well aware of it, into the room in
which Dr. Lloyd had died. Widely different, indeed, the aspect of
the walls, the character of the furniture! The dingy paperhangings
were replaced by airy muslins, showing a rose-coloured ground
through their fanciful openwork; luxurious fauteuils, gilded
wardrobes, full-length mirrors, a toilet-table tricked out with
lace and ribbons; and glittering with an array of silver gewgaws
and jewelled trinkets,&mdash;all transformed the sick chamber of
the simple man of science to a boudoir of death for the vain
coquette. But the room itself, in its high lattice and heavy
ceiling, was the same&mdash;as the coffin itself has the same
confines, whether it be rich in velvets and bright with blazoning,
or rude as a pauper's shell.</p>

<p>And the bed, with its silken coverlet, and its pillows edged
with the thread-work of Louvain, stood in the same sharp angle as
that over which had flickered the frowning smoke-reek above the
dying, resentful foe. As I approached, a man, who was seated beside
the sufferer, turned round his face, and gave me a silent kindly
nod of recognition. He was Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, one of the clergy
of the town, the one with whom I had the most frequently come into
contact wherever the physician resigns to the priest the language
that bids man hope. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;-, as a preacher, was
renowned for his touching eloquence; as a pastor, revered for his
benignant piety; as friend and neighbour, beloved for a sweetness
of nature which seemed to regulate all the movements of a mind
eminently masculine by the beat of a heart tender as the gentlest
woman's.</p>

<p>This good man; then whispering something to the sufferer which I
did not overhear, stole towards me, took me by the hand, and said,
also in a whisper, "Be merciful as Christians are." He led me to
the bedside, there left me, went out, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Do you think I am really dying, Dr. Fenwick?" said a feeble
voice. "I fear Dr. Jones has misunderstood my case. I wish I had
called you in at the first, but&mdash;but I could not&mdash;I could
not! Will you feel my pulse? Don't you think you could do me
good?"</p>

<p>I had no need to feel the pulse in that skeleton wrist; the
aspect of the face sufficed to tell me that death was drawing
near.</p>

<p>Mechanically, however, I went through the hackneyed formulae of
professional questions. This vain ceremony done, as gently and
delicately as I could, I implied the expediency of concluding, if
not yet settled, those affairs which relate to this world.</p>

<p>"This duty," I said, "in relieving the mind from care for others
to whom we owe the forethought of affection, often relieves the
body also of many a gnawing pain, and sometimes, to the surprise of
the most experienced physician, prolongs life itself."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the old maid, peevishly, "I understand! But it is not
my will that troubles me. I should not be left to a nurse from a
hospital if my relations did not know that my annuity dies with me;
and I forestalled it in furnishing this house, Dr. Fenwick, and all
these pretty things will be sold to pay those horrid
tradesmen!&mdash;very hard!&mdash;so hard!&mdash;just as I got
things about me in the way I always said I would have them if I
could ever afford it! I always said I would have my bedroom hung
with muslin, like dear Lady L&mdash;&mdash;'s; and the drawing-room
in geranium-coloured silk: so pretty. You have not seen it: you
would not know the house, Dr. Fenwick. And just when all is
finished, to be taken away and thrust into the grave. It is so
cruel!" And she began to weep. Her emotion brought on a violent
paroxysm, which, when she recovered from it, had produced one of
those startling changes of mind that are sometimes witnessed before
death,&mdash;changes whereby the whole character of a life seems to
undergo solemn transformation. The hard will becomes gentle, the
proud meek, the frivolous earnest. That awful moment when the
things of earth pass away like dissolving scenes, leaving death
visible on the background by the glare that shoots up in the last
flicker of life's lamp.</p>

<p>And when she lifted her haggard face from my shoulder, and heard
my pitying, soothing voice, it was not the grief of a trifler at
the loss of fondled toys that spoke in the fallen lines of her lip,
in the woe of her pleading eyes.</p>

<p>"So this is death," she said. "I feel it hurrying on. I must
speak. I promised Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; that I would. Forgive me, can
you&mdash;can you? That letter&mdash;that letter to Lilian
Ashleigh, I wrote it! Oh, do not look at me so terribly; I never
thought it could do such evil! And am I not punished enough? I
truly believed when I wrote that Miss Ashleigh was deceiving you,
and once I was silly enough to fancy that you might have liked me.
But I had another motive; I had been so poor all my life&mdash;I
had become rich unexpectedly; I set my heart on this house&mdash;I
had always fancied it&mdash;and I thought if I could prevent Miss
Ashleigh marrying you, and scare her and her mother from coming
back to L&mdash;&mdash;, I could get the house. And I did get it.
What for?&mdash;to die. I had not been here a week before I got the
hurt that is killing me&mdash;a fall down the stairs,&mdash;coming
out of this very room; the stairs had been polished. If I had
stayed in my old lodging, it would not have happened. Oh, say you
forgive me! Say, say it, even if you do not feel you can! Say it!"
And the miserable woman grasped me by the arm as Dr. Lloyd had
grasped me.</p>

<p>I shaded my averted face with my hands; my heart heaved with the
agony of my suppressed passion. A wrong, however deep, only to
myself, I could have pardoned without effort; such a wrong to
Lilian,&mdash;no! I could not say "I forgive."</p>

<p>The dying wretch was perhaps more appalled by my silence than
she would have been by my reproach. Her voice grew shrill in her
despair.</p>

<p>"You will not pardon me! I shall die with your curse on my head!
Mercy! mercy! That good man, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, assured me you
would be merciful. Have you never wronged another? Has the Evil One
never tempted you?"</p>

<p>Then I spoke in broken accents: "Me! Oh, had it been I whom you
defamed&mdash;but a young creature so harmless, so unoffending, and
for so miserable a motive!"</p>

<p>"But I tell you, I swear to you, I never dreamed I could cause
such sorrow; and that young man, that Margrave, put it into my
head!"</p>

<p>"Margrave! He had left L&mdash;&mdash; long before that letter
was written!"</p>

<p>"But he came back for a day just before I wrote: it was the very
day. I met him in the lane yonder. He asked after you,&mdash;after
Miss Ashleigh; and when he spoke he laughed, and I said, 'Miss
Ashleigh had been ill, and was gone away;' and he laughed again.
And I thought he knew more than he would tell me, so I asked him if
he supposed Mrs. Ashleigh would come back, and said how much I
should like to take this house if she did not; and again he
laughed, and said, 'Birds never stay in the nest after the young
ones are hurt,' and went away singing. When I got home, his laugh
and his song haunted me. I thought I saw him still in my room,
prompting me to write, and I sat down and wrote. Oh, pardon, pardon
me! I have been a foolish poor creature, but never meant to do such
harm. The Evil One tempted me! There he is, near me now! I see him
yonder! there, at the doorway. He comes to claim me! As you hope
for mercy yourself, free me from him! Forgive me!"</p>

<p>I made an effort over myself. In naming Margrave as her tempter,
the woman had suggested an excuse, echoed from that innermost cell
of my mind, which I recoiled from gazing into, for there I should
behold his image. Inexpiable though the injury she had wrought
against me and mine, still the woman was
human&mdash;fellow-creature-like myself;&mdash;but he?</p>

<p>I took the pale hand that still pressed my arm, and said, with
firm voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be comforted. In the name of Lilian, my wife, I forgive you for
her and for me as freely and as fully as we are enjoined by Him,
against whose precepts the best of us daily sin, to
forgive&mdash;we children of wrath&mdash;to forgive one
another!"</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you!&mdash;oh, bless you!" she murmured, sinking
back upon her pillow.</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought I, "what if the pardon I grant for a wrong far
deeper than I inflicted on him whose imprecation smote me in this
chamber, should indeed be received as atonement, and this blessing
on the lips of the dying annul the dark curse that the dead has
left on my path through the Valley of the Shadow!"</p>

<p>I left my patient sleeping quietly,&mdash;the sleep that
precedes the last. As I went down the stairs into the hall, I saw
Mrs. Poyntz standing at the threshold, speaking to the man-servant
and the nurse.</p>

<p>I would have passed her with a formal bow, but she stopped
me.</p>

<p>"I came to inquire after poor Miss Brabazon," said she.</p>

<p>"You can tell me more than the servants can: is there no
hope?"</p>

<p>"Let the nurse go up and watch beside her. She may pass away in
the sleep into which she has fallen."</p>

<p>"Allen Fenwick, I must speak with you&mdash;nay, but for a few
minutes. I hear that you leave L&mdash;&mdash; to-morrow. It is
scarcely among the chances of life that we should meet again."
While thus saying, she drew me along the lawn down the path that
led towards her own home. "I wish," said she, earnestly, "that you
could part with a kindlier feeling towards me; but I can scarcely
expect it. Could I put myself in your place, and be moved by your
feelings, I know that I should be implacable; but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you, madam, are The World! and the World governs itself,
and dictates to others, by laws which seem harsh to those who ask
from its favour the services which the World cannot tender, for the
World admits favourites, but ignores friends. You did but act to me
as the World ever acts to those who mistake its favour for its
friendship."</p>

<p>"It is true," said Mrs. Poyntz, with blunt candour; and we
continued to walk on silently. At length she said abruptly, "But do
you not rashly deprive yourself of your only consolation in sorrow?
When the heart suffers, does your skill admit any remedy like
occupation to the mind? Yet you abandon that occupation to which
your mind is most accustomed; you desert your career; you turn
aside, in the midst of the race, from the fame which awaits at the
goal; you go back from civilization itself, and dream that all your
intellectual cravings can find content in the life of a herdsman,
amidst the monotony of a wild! No, you will repent, for you are
untrue to your mind!"</p>

<p>"I am sick of the word 'mind'!" said I, bitterly. And therewith
I relapsed into musing.</p>

<p>The enigmas which had foiled my intelligence in the unravelled
Sibyl Book of Nature were mysteries strange to every man's normal
practice of thought, even if reducible to the fraudulent
impressions of outward sense; for illusions in a brain otherwise
healthy suggest problems in our human organization which the
colleges that record them rather guess at than solve. But the blow
which had shattered my life had been dealt by the hand of a fool.
Here, there were no mystic enchantments. Motives the most
commonplace and paltry, suggested to a brain as trivial and shallow
as ever made the frivolity of woman a theme for the satire of
poets, had sufficed, in devastating the field of my affections, to
blast the uses for which I had cultured my mind; and had my
intellect been as great as heaven ever gave to man, it would have
been as vain a shield as mine against the shaft that had lodged in
my heart. While I had, indeed, been preparing my reason and my
fortitude to meet such perils, weird and marvellous, as those by
which tales round the winter fireside scare the credulous child, a
contrivance&mdash;so vulgar and hackneyed that not a day passes but
what some hearth is vexed by an anonymous libel&mdash;had wrought a
calamity more dread than aught which my dark guess into the
Shadow-Land unpierced by Philosophy could trace to the prompting of
malignant witchcraft. So, ever this truth runs through all legends
of ghost and demon&mdash;through the uniform records of what wonder
accredits and science rejects as the supernatural&mdash;lo! the
dread machinery whose wheels roll through Hades! What need such
awful engines for such mean results? The first blockhead we meet in
our walk to our grocer's can tell us more than the ghost tells us;
the poorest envy we ever aroused hurts us more than the demon. How
true an interpreter is Genius to Hell as to Earth! The Fiend comes
to Faust, the tired seeker of knowledge; Heaven and Hell stake
their cause in the Mortal's temptation. And what does the Fiend to
astonish the Mortal? Turn wine into fire, turn love into crime. We
need no Mephistopheles to accomplish these marvels every day!</p>

<p>Thus silently thinking, I walked by the side of the world-wise
woman; and when she next spoke, I looked up, and saw that we were
at the Monks' Well, where I had first seen Lilian gazing into
heaven!</p>

<p>Mrs. Poyntz had, as we walked, placed her hand on my arm; and,
turning abruptly from the path into the glade, I found myself
standing by her side in the scene where a new sense of being had
first disclosed to my sight the hues with which Love, the
passionate beautifier, turns into purple and gold the gray of the
common air. Thus, when romance has ended in sorrow, and the
Beautiful fades from the landscape, the trite and positive forms of
life, banished for a time, reappear, and deepen our mournful
remembrance of the glories they replace. And the Woman of the
World, finding how little I was induced to respond to her when she
had talked of myself, began to speak, in her habitual clear,
ringing accents, of her own social schemes and devices,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall miss you when you are gone, Allen Fenwick; for though,
during the last year or so, all actual intercourse between us has
ceased, yet my interest in you gave some occupation to my thoughts
when I sat alone,&mdash;having lost my main object of ambition in
settling my daughter, and having no longer any one in the house
with whom I could talk of the future, or for whom I could form a
project. It is so wearisome to count the changes which pass within
us, that we take interest in the changes that pass without. Poyntz
still has his weather-glass; I have no longer my Jane."</p>

<p>"I cannot linger with you on this spot," said I, impatiently
turning back into the path; she followed, treading over fallen
leaves. And unheeding my interruption, she thus continued her hard
talk,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But I am not sick of my mind, as you seem to be of yours; I am
only somewhat tired of the little cage in which, since it has been
alone, it ruffles its plumes against the flimsy wires that confine
it from wider space. I shall take up my home for a time with the
new-married couple: they want me. Ashleigh Sumner has come into
parliament. He means to attend regularly and work hard, but he does
not like Jane to go into the world by herself, and he wishes her to
go into the world, because he wants a wife to display his wealth
for the improvement of his position. In Ashleigh Sumner's house I
shall have ample scope for my energies, such as they are. I have a
curiosity to see the few that perch on the wheels of the State and
say, 'It is we who move the wheels!' It will amuse me to learn if I
can maintain in a capital the authority I have won in a country
town; if not, I can but return to my small principality. Wherever I
live I must sway, not serve. If I succeed&mdash;as I ought, for in
Jane's beauty and Ashleigh's fortune I have materials for the woof
of ambition, wanting which here, I fall asleep over my
knitting&mdash;if I succeed, there will be enough to occupy the
rest of my life. Ashleigh Sumner must be a power; the power will be
represented and enjoyed by my child, and created and maintained by
me! Allen Fenwick, do as I do. Be world with the world, and it will
only be in moments of spleen and chagrin that you will sigh to
think that the heart may be void when the mind is full. Confess you
envy me while you listen."</p>

<p>"Not so; all that to you seems so great appears to me so small!
Nature alone is always grand, in her terrors as well as her charms.
The World for you, Nature for me. Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Nature!" said Mrs. Poyntz, compassionately. "Poor Allen
Fenwick! Nature indeed,&mdash;intellectual suicide! Nay, shake
hands, then, if for the last time."</p>

<p>So we shook hands and parted, where the wicket-gate and the
stone stairs separated my blighted fairy-land from the common
thoroughfare.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h2>

<p>That night as I was employed in collecting the books and
manuscripts which I proposed to take with me, including my
long-suspended physiological work, and such standard authorities as
I might want to consult or refer to in the portions yet
incompleted, my servant entered to inform me, in answer to the
inquiries I had sent him to make, that Miss Brabazon had peacefully
breathed her last an hour before. Well! my pardon had perhaps
soothed her last moments; but how unavailing her death-bed
repentance to undo the wrong she had done!</p>

<p>I turned from that thought, and, glancing at the work into which
I had thrown all my learning, methodized into system with all my
art, I recalled the pity which Mrs. Poyntz had expressed for my
meditated waste of mind. The tone of superiority which this
incarnation of common-sense accompanied by uncommon will assumed
over all that was too deep or too high for her comprehension had
sometimes amused me; thinking over it now, it piqued. I said to
myself, "After all, I shall bear with me such solace as
intellectual occupation can afford. I shall have leisure to
complete this labour; and a record that I have lived and thought
may outlast all the honours which worldly ambition may bestow upon
Ashleigh Summer!" And, as I so murmured, my hand, mechanically
selecting the books I needed, fell on the Bible that Julius Faber
had given to me.</p>

<p>It opened at the Second Book of Esdras, which our Church places
amongst the Apocrypha, and is generally considered by scholars to
have been written in the first or second century of the Christian
era,(1)&mdash;but in which the questions raised by man in the
remotest ages, to which we can trace back his desire "to comprehend
the ways of the Most High," are invested with a grandeur of thought
and sublimity of word to which I know of no parallel in writers we
call profane.</p>

<p>My eye fell on this passage in the lofty argument between the
Angel whose name was Uriel, and the Prophet, perplexed by his own
cravings for knowledge:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "He (the Angel) answered me, and said, I went into a forest, into a
    plain, and the trees took counsel,

   "And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea, that it may
    depart away before us, and that we may make us more woods.

   "The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, and said,
    Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, that there also
    we may make us another country.

   "The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came and consumed it.

   "The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought, for the
    sand stood up and stopped them.

   "If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldst thou begin to
    justify; or whom wouldst thou condemn?

   "I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that they both
    have devised; for the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea also
    hath his place to bear his floods.

   "Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a right judgment; but
    why judgest thou not thyself also?

   "For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea to his
    floods, even so they that dwell upon the earth may understand nothing
    but that which is upon the earth; and He that dwelleth above the
    heavens may only understand the things that are above the height of
    the heavens."

</pre>

<p>I paused at those words, and, closing the Sacred Volume, fell
into deep, unquiet thought.</p>

<p>(1) Such is the supposition of Jahn. Dr. Lee, however, is of
opinion that the author was contemporary, and, indeed, identical,
with the author of the Book of Enoch.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIX.</h2>

<p>I had hoped that the voyage would produce some beneficial effect
upon Lilian; but no effect, good or bad, was perceptible, except,
perhaps, a deeper silence, a gentler calm. She loved to sit on the
deck when the nights were fair, and the stars mirrored on the deep.
And once thus, as I stood beside her, bending over the rail of the
vessel, and gazing on the long wake of light which the moon made
amidst the darkness of an ocean to which no shore could be seen, I
said to myself, "Where is my track of light through the measureless
future? Would that I could believe as I did when a child! Woe is
me, that all the reasonings I take from my knowledge should lead me
away from the comfort which the peasant who mourns finds in faith!
Why should riddles so dark have been thrust upon me,&mdash;me, no
fond child of fancy; me, sober pupil of schools the severest? Yet
what marvel&mdash;the strangest my senses have witnessed or feigned
in the fraud they have palmed on me&mdash;is greater than that by
which a simple affection, that all men profess to have known, has
changed the courses of life prearranged by my hopes and confirmed
by my judgment? How calmly before I knew love I have anatomized its
mechanism, as the tyro who dissects the web-work of tissues and
nerves in the dead! Lo! it lives, lives in me; and, in living,
escapes from my scalpel, and mocks all my knowledge. Can love be
reduced to the realm of the senses? No; what nun is more barred by
her grate from the realm of the senses than my bride by her solemn
affliction? Is love, then, the union of kindred, harmonious minds?
No, my beloved one sits by my side, and I guess not her thoughts,
and my mind is to her a sealed fountain. Yet I love her
more&mdash;oh, ineffably more!&mdash;for the doom which destroys
the two causes philosophy assigns to love&mdash;in the form, in the
mind! How can I now, in my vain physiology, say what is love, what
is not? Is it love which must tell me that man has a soul, and that
in soul will be found the solution of problems never to be solved
in body or mind alone?"</p>

<p>My self-questionings halted here as Lilian's hand touched my
shoulder. She had risen from her seat, and had come to me.</p>

<p>"Are not the stars very far from earth?" she said.</p>

<p>"Very far."</p>

<p>"Are they seen for the first time to-night?"</p>

<p>"They were seen, I presume, as we see them, by the fathers of
all human races!"</p>

<p>"Yet close below us they shine reflected in the waters; and yet,
see, wave flows on wave before we can count it!"</p>

<p>"Lilian, by what sympathy do you read and answer my
thought?"</p>

<p>Her reply was incoherent and meaningless. If a gleam of
intelligence had mysteriously lighted my heart to her view, it was
gone. But drawing her nearer towards me, my eye long followed
wistfully the path of light, dividing the darkness on either hand,
till it closed in the sloping horizon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXX.</h2>

<p>The voyage is over. At the seaport at which we landed I found a
letter from Faber. My instructions had reached him in time to
effect the purchase on which his descriptions had fixed my desire.
The stock, the implements of husbandry, the furniture of the house,
were included in the purchase. All was prepared for my arrival, and
I hastened from the then miserable village, which may some day rise
into one of the mightiest capitals of the world, to my lodge in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>It was the burst of the Australian spring, which commences in
our autumn month of October. The air was loaded with the perfume of
the acacias. Amidst the glades of the open forest land, or climbing
the craggy banks of winding silvery creeks,(1) creepers and flowers
of dazzling hue contrasted the olive-green of the surrounding
foliage. The exhilarating effect of the climate in that season
heightens the charm of the strange scenery. In the brilliancy of
the sky, in the lightness of the atmosphere, the sense of life is
wondrously quickened. With the very breath the Adventurer draws in
from the racy air, he feels as if inhaling hope.</p>

<p>We have reached our home, we are settled in it; the early
unfamiliar impressions are worn away. We have learned to dispense
with much that we at first missed, and are reconciled to much that
at first disappointed or displeased.</p>

<p>The house is built but of logs; the late proprietor had
commenced, upon a rising ground, a mile distant, a more imposing
edifice of stone, but it is not half finished.</p>

<p>This log-house is commodious, and much has been done, within and
without, to conceal or adorn its primitive rudeness. It is of
irregular, picturesque form, with verandas round three sides of it,
to which the grape-vine has been trained, with glossy leaves that
clamber up to the gable roof. There is a large garden in front, in
which many English fruit-trees have been set, and grow fast amongst
the plants of the tropics and the orange-trees of Southern Europe.
Beyond stretch undulous pastures, studded not only with sheep, but
with herds of cattle, which my speculative predecessor had bred
from parents of famous stock, and imported from England at mighty
cost; but as yet the herds had been of little profit, and they
range their luxuriant expanse of pasture with as little heed. To
the left soar up, in long range, the many-coloured hills; to the
right meanders a creek, belted by feathery trees; and on its
opposite bank a forest opens, through frequent breaks, into
park-like glades and alleys. The territory, of which I so suddenly
find myself the lord, is vast, even for a colonial capitalist.</p>

<p>It had been originally purchased as "a special survey,"
comprising twenty thousand acres, with the privilege of pasture
over forty thousand more. In very little of this land, though it
includes some of the most fertile districts in the known world, has
cultivation been even commenced. At the time I entered into
possession, even sheep were barely profitable; labour was scarce
and costly. Regarded as a speculation, I could not wonder that my
predecessor fled in fear from his domain. Had I invested the bulk
of my capital in this lordly purchase, I should have deemed myself
a ruined man; but a villa near London, with a hundred acres, would
have cost me as much to buy, and thrice as much to keep up. I could
afford the investment I had made. I found a Scotch bailiff already
on the estate, and I was contented to escape from rural
occupations, to which I brought no experience, by making it worth
his while to serve me with zeal. Two domestics of my own, and two
who had been for many years with Mrs. Ashleigh, had accompanied us:
they remained faithful and seemed contented. So the clockwork of
our mere household arrangements went on much the same as in our
native home. Lilian was not subjected to the ordinary privations
and discomforts that await the wife even of the wealthy emigrant.
Alas! would she have heeded them if she had been?</p>

<p>The change of scene wrought a decided change for the better in
her health and spirits, but not such as implied a dawn of reviving
reason. But her countenance was now more rarely overcast. Its usual
aspect was glad with a soft mysterious smile. She would murmur
snatches of songs, that were partly borrowed from English poets,
and partly glided away into what seemed spontaneous additions of
her own,&mdash;wanting intelligible meaning, but never melody nor
rhyme. Strange, that memory and imitation&mdash;the two earliest
parents of all inventive knowledge&mdash;should still be so active,
and judgment&mdash;the after faculty, that combines the rest into
purpose and method&mdash;be annulled!</p>

<p>Julius Faber I see continually, though his residence is a few
miles distant. He is sanguine as to Lilian's ultimate recovery;
and, to my amazement and to my envy, he has contrived, by some art
which I cannot attain, to establish between her and himself
intelligible communion. She comprehends his questions, when mine,
though the simplest, seem to her in unknown language; and he
construes into sense her words, that to me are meaningless
riddles.</p>

<p>"I was right," he said to me one day, leaving her seated in the
garden beside her quiet, patient mother, and joining me where I
lay&mdash;listless yet fretful&mdash;under the shadeless gum-trees,
gazing not on the flocks and fields that I could call my own, but
on the far mountain range, from which the arch of the horizon
seemed to spring,&mdash;"I was right," said the great physician;
"this is reason suspended, not reason lost. Your wife will recover;
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"Give me your arm as I walk homeward, and I will tell you the
conclusion to which I have come."</p>

<p>I rose, the old man leaned on me, and we went down the valley
along the craggy ridges of the winding creek. The woodland on the
opposite bank was vocal with the chirp and croak and chatter of
Australian birds,&mdash;all mirthful, all songless, save that
sweetest of warblers, which some early irreverent emigrant degraded
to the name of magpie, but whose note is sweeter than the
nightingale's, and trills through the lucent air with a distinct
ecstatic melody of joy that dominates all the discords, so
ravishing the sense, that, while it sings, the ear scarcely heeds
the scream of the parrots.</p>

<p>(1) Creek is the name given by Australian colonists to
precarious water Courses and tributary streams.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXI.</h2>

<p>"You may remember," said Julius Faber, "Sir Humphry Davy's
eloquent description of the effect produced on him by the
inhalation of nitrous oxide. He states that he began to lose the
perception of external things; trains of vivid visible images
rapidly passed through his mind, and were connected with words in
such a manner as to produce perceptions perfectly novel. 'I
existed,' he said, 'in a world of newly-connected and
newly-modified ideas.' When he recovered, he exclaimed: 'Nothing
exists but thoughts; the universe is composed of impressions,
ideas, pleasures, and pains!'</p>

<p>"Now observe, that thus a cultivator of positive science,
endowed with one of the healthiest of human brains, is, by the
inhalation of a gas, abstracted from all external
life,&mdash;enters into a new world, which consists of images he
himself creates and animates so vividly that, on waking, he
resolves the universe itself into thoughts."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "but what inference do you draw from that
voluntary experiment, applicable to the malady of which you bid me
hope the cure?"</p>

<p>"Simply this: that the effect produced on a healthful brain by
the nitrous oxide may be produced also by moral causes operating on
the blood, or on the nerves. There is a degree of mental excitement
in which ideas are more vivid than sensations, and then the world
of external things gives way to the world within the brain.(1) But
this, though a suspension of that reason which comprehends accuracy
of judgment, is no more a permanent aberration of reason than were
Sir Humphry Davy's visionary ecstasies under the influence of the
gas. The difference between the two states of suspension is that of
time, and it is but an affair of time with our beloved patient. Yet
prepare yourself. I fear that the mind will not recover without
some critical malady of the body!"</p>

<p>"Critical! but not dangerous?&mdash;say not dangerous! I can
endure the pause of her reason; I could not endure the void in the
universe if her life were to fade from the earth."</p>

<p>"Poor friend! would not you yourself rather lose life than
reason?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes! But we men are taught to set cheap value on our
own lives; we do not estimate at the same rate the lives of those
we love. Did we do so, Humanity would lose its virtues."</p>

<p>"What, then! Love teaches that there is something of nobler
value than mere mind? Yet surely it cannot be the mere body? What
is it, if not that continuance of being which your philosophy
declines to acknowledge,&mdash;namely, soul? If you fear so
painfully that your Lilian should die, is it not that you fear to
lose her forever?"</p>

<p>"Oh, cease, cease!" I cried impatiently. "I cannot now argue on
metaphysics. What is it that you anticipate of harm to her life?
Her health has been stronger ever since her affliction. She never
seems to know ailment now. Do you not perceive that her cheek has a
more hardy bloom, her frame a more rounded symmetry, than when you
saw her in England?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably. Her physical forces have been silently
recruiting themselves in the dreams which half lull, half amuse her
imagination. Imagination! that faculty, the most glorious which is
bestowed on the human mind, because it is the faculty which enables
thought to create, is of all others the most exhausting to life
when unduly stimulated and consciously reasoning on its own
creations. I think it probable that had this sorrow not befallen
you, you would have known a sorrow yet graver,&mdash;you would have
long survived your Lilian. As it is now, when she recovers, her
whole organization, physical and mental, will have undergone a
beneficent change. But, I repeat my prediction,&mdash;some severe
malady of the body will precede the restoration of the mind; and it
is my hope that the present suspense or aberration of the more
wearing powers of the mind may fit the body to endure and surmount
the physical crisis. I remember a case, within my own professional
experience, in many respects similar to this, but in other respects
it was less hopeful. I was consulted by a young student of a very
delicate physical frame, of great mental energies, and consumed by
an intense ambition. He was reading for university honours. He
would not listen to me when I entreated him to rest his mind. I
thought that he was certain to obtain the distinction for which he
toiled, and equally certain to die a few months after obtaining it.
He falsified both my prognostics. He so overworked himself that, on
the day of examination, his nerves were agitated, his memory failed
him; he passed, not without a certain credit, but fell far short of
the rank amongst his fellow competitors to which he aspired. Here,
then, the irritated mind acted on the disappointed heart, and
raised a new train of emotions. He was first visited by spectral
illusions; then he sank into a state in which the external world
seemed quite blotted out. He heeded nothing that was said to him;
seemed to see nothing that was placed before his eyes,&mdash;in a
word, sensations became dormant, ideas preconceived usurped their
place, and those ideas gave him pleasure. He believed that his
genius was recognized, and lived amongst its supposed creations
enjoying an imaginary fame. So it went on for two years, during
which suspense of his reason, his frail form became robust and
vigorous. At the end of that time he was seized with a fever, which
would have swept him in three days to the grave had it occurred
when I was first called in to attend him. He conquered the fever,
and, in recovering, acquired the full possession of the
intellectual faculties so long suspended. When I last saw him, many
years afterwards, he was in perfect health, and the object of his
young ambition was realized; the body had supported the
mind,&mdash;he had achieved distinction. Now what had so, for a
time, laid this strong intellect into visionary sleep? The most
agonizing of human emotions in a noble spirit,&mdash;shame! What
has so stricken down your Lilian? You have told me the story:
shame!&mdash;the shame of a nature pre-eminently pure. But observe
that, in his case as in hers, the shock inflicted does not produce
a succession of painful illusions: on the contrary, in both, the
illusions are generally pleasing. Had the illusions been painful,
the body would have suffered, the patient died. Why did a painful
shock produce pleasing illusions? Because, no matter how a shock on
the nerves may originate, if it affects the reason, it does but
make more vivid than impressions from actual external objects the
ideas previously most cherished. Such ideas in the young student
were ideas of earthly fame; such ideas in the young maiden are
ideas of angel comforters and heavenly Edens. You miss her mind on
the earth, and, while we speak, it is in paradise."</p>

<p>"Much that you say, my friend, is authorized by the speculations
of great writers, with whom I am not unfamiliar; but in none of
those writers, nor in your encouraging words, do I find a solution
for much that has no precedents in my experience,&mdash;much,
indeed, that has analogies in my reading, but analogies which I
have hitherto despised as old wives' fables. I have bared to your
searching eye the weird mysteries of my life. How do you account
for facts which you cannot resolve into illusions,&mdash;for the
influence which that strange being, Margrave, exercised over
Lilian's mind or fancy, so that for a time her love for me was as
dormant as is her reason now; so that he could draw her&mdash;her
whose nature you admit to be singularly pure and modest&mdash;from
her mother's home? The magic wand; the trance into which that wand
threw Margrave himself; the apparition which it conjured up in my
own quiet chamber when my mind was without a care and my health
without a flaw,&mdash;how account for all this: as you endeavoured,
and perhaps successfully, to account for all my impressions of the
Vision in the Museum, of the luminous, haunting shadow in its
earlier apparitions, when my fancy was heated, my heart tormented,
and, it might be, even the physical forces of this strong frame
disordered?"</p>

<p>"Allen," said the old pathologist, "here we approach a ground
which few physicians have dared to examine. Honour to those who,
like our bold contemporary, Elliotson, have braved scoff and
sacrificed dross in seeking to extract what is practical in uses,
what can be tested by experiment, from those exceptional phenomena
on which magic sought to found a philosophy, and to which
philosophy tracks the origin of magic."</p>

<p>"What! do I understand you? Is it you, Julius Faber, who attach
faith to the wonders attributed to animal magnetism and
electro-biology, or subscribe to the doctrines which their
practitioners teach?"</p>

<p>"I have not examined into those doctrines, nor seen with my own
eyes the wonders recorded, upon evidence too respectable,
nevertheless, to permit me peremptorily to deny what I have not
witnessed.(2) But wherever I look through the History of Mankind in
all ages and all races, I find a concurrence in certain beliefs
which seem to countenance the theory that there is in some peculiar
and rare temperaments a power over forms of animated organization,
with which they establish some unaccountable affinity; and even,
though much more rarely, a power over inanimate matter. You are
familiar with the theory of Descartes, 'that those particles of the
blood which penetrate to the brain do not only serve to nourish and
sustain its substance, but to produce there a certain very subtle
Aura, or rather a flame very vivid and pure, that obtains the name
of the Animal Spirits;' (3) and at the close of his great fragment
upon Man, he asserts that 'this flame is of no other nature than
all the fires which are in inanimate bodies.'(4) This notion does
but forestall the more recent doctrine that electricity is more or
less in all, or nearly all, known matter. Now, whether in the
electric fluid or some other fluid akin to it of which we know
still less, thus equally pervading all matter, there may be a
certain magnetic property more active, more operative upon sympathy
in some human constitutions than in others, and which can account
for the mysterious power I have spoken of, is a query I might
suggest, but not an opinion I would hazard. For an opinion I must
have that basis of experience or authority which I do not need when
I submit a query to the experience and authority of others. Still,
the supposition conveyed in the query is so far worthy of notice,
that the ecstatic temperament (in which phrase I comprehend all
constitutional mystics) is peculiarly sensitive to electric
atmospheric influences. This is a fact which most medical observers
will have remarked in the range of their practice. Accordingly, I
was prepared to find Mr. Hare Townshend, in his interesting
work,(5) state that he himself was of 'the electric temperament,'
sparks flying from his hair when combed in the dark, etc. That
accomplished writer, whose veracity no one would impugn, affirms
that between this electrical endowment and whatever mesmeric
properties he might possess, there is a remarkable relationship and
parallelism. Whatever state of the atmosphere tends to accumulate
and insulate electricity in the body, promotes equally' (says Mr.
Townshend) 'the power and facility with which I influence others
mesmerically.' What Mr. Townshend thus observes in himself,
American physicians and professors of chemistry depose to have
observed in those modern magicians, the mediums of (so-called)
'spirit manifestation.' They state that all such mediums are of the
electric temperament, thus everywhere found allied with the
ecstatic, and their power varies in proportion as the state of the
atmosphere serves to depress or augment the electricity stored in
themselves. Here, then, in the midst of vagrant phenomena, either
too hastily dismissed as altogether the tricks of fraudful
imposture, or too credulously accepted as supernatural
portents&mdash;here, at least, in one generalized fact, we may,
perhaps, find a starting point, from which inductive experiment may
arrive, soon or late, at a rational theory. But however the power
of which we are speaking (a power accorded to special physical
temperament) may or may not be accounted for by some patient
student of nature, I am persuaded that it is in that power we are
to seek for whatever is not wholly imposture, in the attributes
assigned to magic or witchcraft. It is well said, by a writer who
has gone into the depth of these subjects with the research of a
scholar and the science of a pathologist, 'that if magic had
exclusively reposed on credulity and falsehood, its reign would
never have endured so long; but that its art took its origin in
singular phenomena, proper to certain affections of the nerves, or
manifested in the conditions of sleep. These phenomena, the
principle of which was at first unknown, served to root faith in
magic, and often abused even enlightened minds. The enchanters and
magicians arrived, by divers practices, at the faculty of provoking
in other brains a determined order of dreams, of engendering
hallucinations of all kinds, of inducing fits of hypnotism, trance,
mania, during which the persons so affected imagined that they saw,
heard, touched, supernatural beings, conversed with them, proved
their influences, assisted at prodigies of which magic proclaimed
itself to possess the secret. The public, the enchanters, and the
enchanted were equally dupes.'(6) Accepting this explanation,
unintelligible to no physician of a practice so lengthened as mine
has been, I draw from it the corollary, that as these phenomena are
exhibited only by certain special affections, to which only certain
special constitutions are susceptible, so not in any superior
faculties of intellect, or of spiritual endowment, but in peculiar
physical temperaments, often strangely disordered, the power of the
sorcerer in affecting the imagination of others is to be sought. In
the native tribes of Australasia the elders are instructed in the
arts of this so-called sorcery, but only in a very few
constitutions does instruction avail to produce effects in which
the savages recognize the powers of a sorcerer: it is so with the
Obi of the negroes. The fascination of Obi is an unquestionable
fact, but the Obi man cannot be trained by formal lessons; he is
born a fascinator, as a poet is born a poet. It is so with the
Laplanders, of whom Tornoeus reports that of those instructed in
the magical art 'only a few are capable of it.' 'Some,' he says,
'are naturally magicians.' And this fact is emphatically insisted
upon by the mystics of our own middle ages, who state that a man
must be born a magician; in other words, that the gift is
constitutional, though developed by practice and art. Now, that
this gift and its practice should principally obtain in imperfect
states of civilization, and fade into insignificance in the busy
social enlightenment of cities, may be accounted for by reference
to the known influences of imagination. In the cruder states of
social life not only is imagination more frequently predominant
over all other faculties, but it has not the healthful vents which
the intellectual competition of cities and civilization affords.
The man who in a savage tribe, or in the dark feudal ages, would be
a magician, is in our century a poet, an orator, a daring
speculator, an inventive philosopher. In other words, his
imagination is drawn to pursuits congenial to those amongst whom it
works. It is the tendency of all intellect to follow the directions
of the public opinion amidst which it is trained. Where a magician
is held in reverence or awe, there will be more practitioners of
magic than where a magician is despised as an impostor or shut up
as a lunatic. In Scandinavia, before the introduction of
Christianity, all tradition records the wonderful powers of the
Vala, or witch, who was then held in reverence and honour.
Christianity was introduced, and the early Church denounced the
Vala as the instrument of Satan, and from that moment down dropped
the majestic prophetess into a miserable and execrated old
hag!"</p>

<p>"The ideas you broach," said I, musingly, "have at moments
crossed me, though I have shrunk from reducing them to a theory
which is but one of pure hypothesis. But this magic, after all,
then, you would place in the imagination of the operator, acting on
the imagination of those whom it affects? Here, at least, I can
follow you, to a certain extent, for here we get back into the
legitimate realm of physiology."</p>

<p>"And possibly," said Faber, "we may find hints to guide us to
useful examination, if not to complete solution of problems that,
once demonstrated, may lead to discoveries of infinite
value,&mdash;hints, I say, in two writers of widely opposite
genius, Van Helmont and Bacon. Van Helmont, of all the mediaeval
mystics, is, in spite of his many extravagant whims, the one whose
intellect is the most suggestive to the disciplined reasoners of
our day. He supposed that the faculty which he calls Fantasy, and
which we familiarly call Imagination,&mdash;is invested with the
power of creating for itself ideas independent of the senses, each
idea clothed in a form fabricated by the imagination, and becoming
an operative entity. This notion is so far favoured by modern
physiologists, that Lincke reports a case where the eye itself was
extirpated; yet the extirpation was followed by the appearance of
luminous figures before the orbit. And again, a woman, stone-blind,
complained of 'luminous images, with pale colours, before her
eyes.' Abercrombie mentions the case 'of a lady quite blind, her
eyes being also disorganized and sunk, who never walked out without
seeing a little old woman in a red cloak, who seemed to walk before
her.'(7) Your favourite authority, the illustrious Miller, who was
himself in the habit of 'seeing different images in the field of
vision when he lay quietly down to sleep, asserts that these images
are not merely presented to the fancy, but that even the images of
dreams are really seen,' and that 'any one may satisfy himself of
this by accustoming himself regularly to open his eyes when waking
after a dream,&mdash;the images seen in the dream are then
sometimes visible, and can be observed to disappear gradually.' He
confirms this statement not only by the result of his own
experience, but by the observations made by Spinoza, and the yet
higher authority of Aristotle, who accounts for spectral appearance
as the internal action of the sense of vision.(8) And this opinion
is favoured by Sir David Brewster, whose experience leads him to
suggest 'that the objects of mental contemplation may be seen as
distinctly as external objects, and will occupy the same local
position in the axis of vision as if they had been formed by the
agency of light.' Be this as it may, one fact remains,&mdash;that
images can be seen even by the blind as distinctly and vividly as
you and I now see the stream below our feet and the opossums at
play upon yonder boughs. Let us come next to some remarkable
suggestions of Lord Bacon. In his Natural History, treating of the
force of the imagination, and the help it receives 'by one man
working by another,' he cites an instance he had witnessed of a
kind of juggler, who could tell a person what card he thought of.
He mentioned this 'to a pretended learned man, curious in such
things,' and this sage said to him, 'It is not the knowledge of the
man's thought, for that is proper to God, but the enforcing of a
thought upon him, and binding his imagination by a stronger, so
that he could think of no other card.' You see this sage
anticipated our modern electro-biologists! And the learned man then
shrewdly asked Lord Bacon, 'Did the juggler tell the card to the
man himself who had thought of it, or bid another tell it?' 'He
bade another tell it,' answered Lord Bacon. 'I thought so,'
returned his learned acquaintance, 'for the juggler himself could
not have put on so strong an imagination; but by telling the card
to the other, who believed the juggler was some strange man who
could do strange things, that other man caught a strong
imagination.'(9) The whole story is worth reading, because Lord
Bacon evidently thinks it conveys a guess worth examining. And Lord
Bacon, were he now living, would be the man to solve the mysteries
that branch out of mesmerism or (so-called) spiritual
manifestation, for he would not pretend to despise their phenomena
for fear of hurting his reputation for good sense. Bacon then goes
on to state that there are three ways to fortify the imagination.
'First, authority derived from belief in an art and in the man who
exercises it; secondly, means to quicken and corroborate the
imagination; thirdly, means to repeat and refresh it.' For the
second and the third he refers to the practices of magic, and
proceeds afterwards to state on what things imagination has most
force,&mdash;'upon things that have the lightest and easiest
motions, and, therefore, above all, upon the spirits of men, and,
in them, on such affections as move lightest,&mdash;in love, in
fear, in irresolution. And,' adds Bacon, earnestly, in a very
different spirit from that which dictates to the sages of our time
the philosophy of rejecting without trial that which belongs to the
Marvellous,&mdash;'and whatsoever is of this kind, should be
thoroughly inquired into.' And this great founder or renovator of
the sober inductive system of investigation even so far leaves it a
matter of speculative inquiry, whether imagination may not be so
powerful that it can actually operate upon a plant, that he says:
'This likewise should be made upon plants, and that diligently; as
if you should tell a man that such a tree would die this year, and
will him, at these and these times, to go unto it and see how it
thriveth.' I presume that no philosopher has followed such
recommendations: had some great philosopher done so, possibly we
should by this time know all the secrets of what is popularly
called witchcraft."</p>

<p>And as Faber here paused, there came a strange laugh from the
fantastic she-oak-tree overhanging the stream,&mdash;a wild, impish
laugh.</p>

<p>"Pooh! it is but the great kingfisher, the laughing-bird of the
Australian bush," said Julius Faber, amused at my start of
superstitious alarm.</p>

<p>We walked on for some minutes in musing silence, and the rude
log-hut in which my wise companion had his home came in
view,&mdash;the flocks grazing on undulous pastures, the lone
drinking at a watercourse fringed by the slender gum-trees, and a
few fields, laboriously won from the luxuriant grassland, rippling
with the wave of corn.</p>

<p>I halted, and said, "Rest here for a few moments, till I gather
up the conclusions to which your speculative reasoning seems to
invite me."</p>

<p>We sat down on a rocky crag, half mantled by luxuriant creepers
with vermilion buds.</p>

<p>"From the guesses," said I, "which you have drawn from the
erudition of others and your own ingenious and reflective
inductions, I collect this solution of the mysteries, by which the
experience I gain from my senses confounds all the dogmas approved
by my judgment. To the rational conjectures by which, when we first
conversed on the marvels that perplexed me, you ascribe to my
imagination, predisposed by mental excitement, physical fatigue or
derangement, and a concurrence of singular events tending to
strengthen such predisposition, the phantasmal impressions produced
on my senses,&mdash;to these conjectures you now add a new one,
more startling and less admitted by sober physiologists. You
conceive it possible that persons endowed with a rare and peculiar
temperament can so operate on imagination, and, through the
imagination, on the senses of others, as to exceed even the powers
ascribed to the practitioners of mesmerism and electro-biology, and
give a certain foundation of truth to the old tales of magic and
witchcraft. You imply that Margrave may be a person thus gifted,
and hence the influence he unquestionably exercised over Lilian,
and over, perhaps, less innocent agents, charmed or impelled by his
will. And not discarding, as I own I should have been originally
induced to do, the queries or suggestions adventured by Bacon in
his discursive speculations on Nature, to wit, 'that there be many
things, some of them inanimate, that operate upon the spirits of
men by secret sympathy and antipathy,' and to which Bacon gave the
quaint name of 'imaginants,' so even that wand, of which I have
described to you the magic-like effects, may have had properties
communicated to it by which it performs the work of the magician,
as mesmerists pretend that some substance mesmerized by them can
act on the patient as sensibly as if it were the mesmerizer
himself. Do I state your suppositions correctly?"</p>

<p>"Yes; always remembering that they are only suppositions, and
volunteered with the utmost diffidence. But since, thus seated in
the early wilderness, we permit ourselves the indulgence of
childlike guess, may it not be possible, apart from the doubtful
question whether a man can communicate to an inanimate material
substance a power to act upon the mind or imagination of another
man&mdash;may it not, I say, be possible that such a substance may
contain in itself such a virtue or property potent over certain
constitutions, though not over all. For instance, it is in my
experience that the common hazel-wood will strongly affect some
nervous temperaments, though wholly without effect on others. I
remember a young girl, who having taken up a hazel-stick freshly
cut, could not relax her hold of it; and when it was wrenched away
from her by force, was irresistibly attracted towards it,
repossessed herself of it, and, after holding it a few minutes, was
cast into a kind of trance, in which she beheld phantasmal visions.
Mentioning this curious case, which I supposed unique, to a learned
brother of our profession, he told me that he had known other
instances of the effect of the hazel upon nervous temperaments in
persons of both sexes. Possibly it was some such peculiar property
in the hazel that made it the wood selected for the old
divining-rod. Again, we know that the bay-tree, or laurel, was
dedicated to the oracular Pythian Apollo. Now wherever, in the old
world, we find that the learning of the priests enabled them to
exhibit exceptional phenomena, which imposed upon popular
credulity, there was a something or other which is worth a
philosopher's while to explore; and, accordingly, I always
suspected that there was in the laurel some property favourable to
ecstatic vision in highly impressionable temperaments. My
suspicion, a few years ago, was justified by the experience of a
German physician, who had under his care a cataleptic or ecstatic
patient, and who assured me that he found nothing in this patient
so stimulated the state of 'sleep-waking,' or so disposed that
state to indulge in the hallucinations of prevision, as the berry
of the laurel.(10) Well, we do not know what this wand that
produced a seemingly magical effect upon you was really composed
of. You did not notice the metal employed in the wire, which you
say communicated a thrill to the sensitive nerves in the palm of
the hand. You cannot tell how far it might have been the vehicle of
some fluid force in nature. Or still more probably, whether the
pores of your hand insensibly imbibed, and communicated to the
brain, some of those powerful narcotics from which the Buddhists
and the Arabs make unguents that induce visionary hallucinations,
and in which substances undetected in the hollow of the wand, or
the handle of the wand itself, might be steeped.(11) One thing we
do know, namely, that amongst the ancients, and especially in the
East, the construction of wands for magical purposes was no
commonplace mechanical craft, but a special and secret art
appropriated to men who cultivated with assiduity all that was then
known of natural science in order to extract from it agencies that
might appear supernatural. Possibly, then, the rods or wands of the
East, of which Scripture makes mention, were framed upon some
principles of which we in our day are very naturally ignorant,
since we do not ransack science for the same secrets; and thus, in
the selection or preparation of the material employed, mainly
consisted whatever may be referrible to natural philosophical
causes in the antique science of Rhabdomancy, or divination and
enchantment by wands. The staff, or wand, of which you tell me,
was, you say, made of iron or steel and tipped with crystal.
Possibly iron and crystal do really contain some properties not
hitherto scientifically analyzed, and only, indeed, potential over
exceptional temperaments, which may account for the fact that iron
and crystal have been favourites with all professed mystics,
ancient and modern. The Delphic Pythoness had her iron tripod,
Mesmer his iron bed; and many persons, indisputably honest, cannot
gaze long upon a ball of crystal but what they begin to see
visions. I suspect that a philosophical cause for such seemingly
preternatural effects of crystal and iron will be found in
connection with the extreme impressionability to changes in
temperatures which is the characteristic both of crystal and iron.
But if these materials do contain certain powers over exceptional
constitutions, we do not arrive at a supernatural but at a natural
phenomenon."</p>

<p>"Still," said I, "even granting that your explanatory hypotheses
hit or approach the truth;&mdash;still what a terrible power you
would assign to man's will over men's reason and deeds!"</p>

<p>"Man's will," answered Faber, "has over men's deeds and reason,
habitual and daily, power infinitely greater and, when
uncounterbalanced, infinitely more dangerous than that which
superstition exaggerates in magic. Man's will moves a war that
decimates a race, and leaves behind it calamities little less dire
than slaughter. Man's will frames, but it also corrupts laws;
exalts, but also demoralizes opinion; sets the world mad with
fanaticism, as often as it curbs the heart's fierce instincts by
the wisdom of brother-like mercy. You revolt at the exceptional,
limited sway over some two or three individuals which the arts of a
sorcerer (if sorcerer there be) can effect; and yet, at the very
moment in which you were perplexed and appalled by such sway, or by
your reluctant belief in it, your will was devising an engine to
unsettle the reason and wither the hopes of millions!"</p>

<p>"My will! What engine?"</p>

<p>"A book conceived by your intellect, adorned by your learning,
and directed by your will, to steal from the minds of other men
their persuasion of the soul's everlasting Hereafter."</p>

<p>I bowed my head, and felt myself grow pale.</p>

<p>"And if we accept Bacon's theory of 'secret sympathy,' or the
plainer physiological maxim that there must be in the imagination,
morbidly impressed by the will of another, some trains of idea in
affinity with such influence and preinclined to receive it, no
magician could warp you to evil, except through thoughts that
themselves went astray. Grant that the Margrave who still haunts
your mind did really, by some occult, sinister magnetism, guide the
madman to murder, did influence the servant-woman's vulgar desire
to pry into the secrets of her ill-fated master, or the old maid's
covetous wish and envious malignity: what could this awful magician
do more than any commonplace guilty adviser, to a mind predisposed
to accept the advice?"</p>

<p>"You forget one example which destroys your argument,&mdash;the
spell which this mysterious fascinator could cast upon a creature
so pure from all guilt as Lilian!"</p>

<p>"Will you forgive me if I answer frankly?"</p>

<p>"Speak."</p>

<p>"Your Lilian is spotless and pure as you deem her, and the
fascination, therefore, attempts no lure through a sinful desire;
it blends with its attraction no sentiment of affection untrue to
yourself. Nay, it is justice to your Lilian, and may be melancholy
comfort to you, to state my conviction, based on the answers my
questions have drawn from her, that you were never more cherished
by her love than when that love seemed to forsake you. Her
imagination impressed her with the illusion that through your love
for her you were threatened with a great peril. What seemed the
levity of her desertion was the devotion of self-sacrifice. And, in
her strange, dream-led wanderings, do not think that she was
conscious of the fascination you impute to this mysterious
Margrave: in her belief it was your own guardian angel that guided
her steps, and her pilgrimage was ordained to disarm the foe that
menaced you, and dissolve the spell that divided her life from
yours! But had she not, long before this, willingly prepared
herself to be so deceived? Had not her fancies been deliberately
encouraged to dwell remote from the duties we are placed on the
earth to perform? The loftiest faculties in our nature are those
that demand the finest poise, not to fall from their height and
crush all the walls that they crown. With exquisite beauty of
illustration, Hume says of the dreamers of 'bright fancies,' 'that
they may be compared to those angels whom the Scriptures represent
as covering their eyes with their wings.' Had you been, like my
nephew, a wrestler for bread with the wilderness, what helpmate
would your Lilian have been to you? How often would you have cried
out in justifiable anger, 'I, son of Adam, am on earth, not in
Paradise! Oh, that my Eve were at home on my hearth, and not in the
skies with the seraphs!' No Margrave, I venture to say, could have
suspended the healthful affections, or charmed into danger the
wide-awake soul of my Amy. When she rocks in its cradle the babe
the young parents intrust to her heed; when she calls the kine to
the milking, the chicks to their corn; when she but flits through
my room to renew the flowers on the stand, or range in neat order
the books that I read, no spell on her fancy could lead her a step
from the range of her provident cares! At day she is contented to
be on the commonplace earth; at evening she and I knock together at
the one door of heaven, which opes to thanksgiving and prayer; and
thanksgiving and prayer send us back, calm and hopeful, to the task
that each morrow renews."</p>

<p>I looked up as the old man paused, and in the limpid clearness
of the Australian atmosphere, I saw the child he thus praised
standing by the garden-gate, looking towards us, and though still
distant she seemed near. I felt wroth with her. My heart so
cherished my harmless, defenceless Lilian, that I was jealous of
the praise taken from her to be bestowed on another.</p>

<p>"Each of us," said I, coldly, "has his or her own nature, and
the uses harmonious to that nature's idiosyncrasy. The world, I
grant, would get on very ill if women were not more or less
actively useful and quietly good, like your Amy. But the world
would lose standards that exalt and refine, if no woman were
permitted to gain, through the indulgence of fancy, thoughts
exquisite as those which my Lilian conceived, while thought, alas!
flowed out of fancy. I do not wound you by citing your Amy as a
type of the mediocre; I do not claim for Lilian the rank we accord
to the type of genius. But both are alike to such types in this:
namely, that the uses of mediocrity are for every-day life, and the
uses of genius, amidst a thousand mistakes which mediocrity never
commits, are to suggest and perpetuate ideas which raise the
standard of the mediocre to a nobler level. There would be fewer
Amys in life if there were no Lilian! as there would be far fewer
good men of sense if there were no erring dreamer of genius!"</p>

<p>"You say well, Allen Fenwick. And who should be so indulgent to
the vagaries of the imagination as the philosophers who taught your
youth to doubt everything in the Maker's plan of creation which
could not be mathematically proved? 'The human mind,' said Luther,
'is like a drunkard on horseback; prop it on one side, and it falls
on the other.' So the man who is much too enlightened to believe in
a peasant's religion, is always sure to set up some insane
superstition of his own. Open biographical volumes wherever you
please, and the man who has no faith in religion is a man who has
faith in a nightmare. See that type of the elegant
sceptics,&mdash;Lord Herbert of Cherbury. He is writing a book
against Revelation; he asks a sign from heaven to tell him if his
book is approved by his Maker, and the man who cannot believe in
the miracles performed by his Saviour gravely tells us of a miracle
vouchsafed to himself. Take the hardest and strongest intellect
which the hardest and strongest race of mankind ever schooled and
accomplished. See the greatest of great men, the great Julius
Caesar! Publicly he asserts in the Senate that the immortality of
the soul is a vain chimera. He professes the creed which Roman
voluptuaries deduced from Epicurus, and denies all Divine
interference in the affairs of the earth. A great authority for the
Materialists&mdash;they have none greater! They can show on their
side no intellect equal to Caesar's! And yet this magnificent
freethinker, rejecting a soul and a Deity, habitually entered his
chariot muttering a charm; crawled on his knees up the steps of a
temple to propitiate the abstraction called 'Nemesis;' and did not
cross the Rubicon till he had consulted the omens. What does all
this prove?&mdash;a very simple truth. Man has some instincts with
the brutes; for instance, hunger and sexual love. Man has one
instinct peculiar to himself, found universally (or with alleged
exceptions in savage States so rare, that they do not affect the
general law(12)),&mdash;an instinct of an invisible power without
this earth, and of a life beyond the grave, which that power
vouchsafes to his spirit. But the best of us cannot violate an
instinct with impunity. Resist hunger as long as you can, and,
rather than die of starvation, your instinct will make you a
cannibal; resist love when youth and nature impel to it, and what
pathologist does not track one broad path into madness or crime? So
with the noblest instinct of all. Reject the internal conviction by
which the grandest thinkers have sanctioned the hope of the
humblest Christian, and you are servile at once to some faith
inconceivably more hard to believe. The imagination will not be
withheld from its yearnings for vistas beyond the walls of the
flesh, and the span of the present hour. Philosophy itself, in
rejecting the healthful creeds by which man finds his safeguards in
sober prayer and his guide through the wilderness of visionary
doubt, invents systems compared to which the mysteries of theology
are simple. Suppose any man of strong, plain understanding had
never heard of a Deity like Him whom we Christians adore, then ask
this man which he can the better comprehend in his mind, and accept
as a natural faith,&mdash;namely, the simple Christianity of his
shepherd or the Pantheism of Spinoza? Place before an accomplished
critic (who comes with a perfectly unprejudiced mind to either
inquiry), first, the arguments of David Hume against the gospel
miracles, and then the metaphysical crotchets of David Hume
himself. This subtle philosopher, not content, with Berkeley, to
get rid of matter,&mdash;not content, with Condillac, to get rid of
spirit or mind,&mdash;proceeds to a miracle greater than any his
Maker has yet vouchsafed to reveal. He, being then alive and in the
act of writing, gets rid of himself altogether. Nay, he confesses
he cannot reason with any one who is stupid enough to think he has
a self. His words are: 'What we call a mind is nothing but a heap
or collection of different perceptions or objects united together
by certain relations, and supposed, though falsely, to be endowed
with perfect simplicity and identity. If any one, upon serious and
candid reflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I
must confess I can reason with him no longer.' Certainly I would
rather believe all the ghost stories upon record than believe that
I am not even a ghost, distinct and apart from the perceptions
conveyed to me, no matter how,&mdash;just as I am distinct and
apart from the furniture in my room, no matter whether I found it
there or whether I bought it. If some old cosmogonist asked you to
believe that the primitive cause of the solar system was not to 'be
traced to a Divine Intelligence, but to a nebulosity, originally so
diffused that its existence can with difficulty be conceived, and
that the origin of the present system of organized beings equally
dispensed with the agency of a creative mind, and could be referred
to molecules formed in the water by the power of attraction, till
by modifications of cellular tissue in the gradual lapse of ages,
one monad became an oyster and another a Man,&mdash;would you not
say this cosmogony could scarce have misled the human understanding
even in the earliest dawn of speculative inquiry? Yet such are the
hypotheses to which the desire to philosophize away that simple
proposition of a Divine First Cause, which every child can
comprehend, led two of the greatest geniuses and profoundest
reasoners of modern times,&mdash;La Place and La Marck.(13)
Certainly, the more you examine those arch phantasmagorists, the
philosophers who would leave nothing in the universe but their own
delusions, the more your intellectual pride may be humbled. The
wildest phenomena which have startled you are not more extravagant
than the grave explanations which intellectual presumption
adventures on the elements of our own organism and the relations
between the world of matter and the world of ideas."</p>

<p>Here our conversation stopped, for Amy had now joined us, and,
looking up to reply, I saw the child's innocent face between me and
the furrowed brow of the old man.</p>

<p>(1) See, on the theory elaborated from this principle, Dr.
Hibbert's interesting and valuable work on the "Philosophy of
Apparitions."</p>

<p>(2) What Faber here says is expressed with more authority by one
of the most accomplished metaphysicians of our time (Sir W.
Hamilton):</p>

<p>"Somnambulism is a phenomenon still more astonishing (than
dreaming). In this singular state a person performs a regular
series of rational actions, and those frequently of the most
difficult and delicate nature; and what is still more marvellous,
with a talent to which he could make no pretension when awake. (Cr.
Ancillon, Essais Philos. ii. 161.) His memory and reminiscence
supply him with recollections of words and things which, perhaps,
never were at his disposal in the ordinary state,&mdash;he speaks
more fluently a more refined language. And if we are to credit what
the evidence on which it rests hardly allows us to disbelieve, he
has not only perception of things through other channels than the
common organs of sense, but the sphere of his cognition is
amplified to an extent far beyond the limits to which sensible
perception is confined. This subject is one of the most perplexing
in the whole compass of philosophy; for, on the one hand, the
phenomena are so remarkable that they cannot be believed, and yet,
on the other, they are of so unambiguous and palpable a character,
and the witnesses to their reality are so numerous, so intelligent,
and so high above every suspicion of deceit, that it is equally
impossible to deny credit to what is attested by such ample and un
exceptionable evidence."&mdash;Sir W. Hamilton: Lectures on
Metaphysics and Logic, vol. ii. p. 274.</p>

<p>This perplexity, in which the distinguished philosopher leaves
the judgment so equally balanced that it finds it impossible to
believe, and yet impossible to disbelieve, forms the right state of
mind in which a candid thinker should come to the examination of
those more extraordinary phenomena which he has not himself yet
witnessed, but the fair inquiry into which may be tendered to him
by persons above the imputation of quackery and fraud. Muffler, who
is not the least determined, as he is certainly one of the most
distinguished, disbelievers of mesmeric phenomena, does not appear
to have witnessed, or at least to have carefully examined, them, or
he would, perhaps, have seen that even the more extraordinary of
those phenomena confirm, rather than contradict, his own general
theories, and may be explained by the sympathies one sense has with
another,&mdash;"the laws of reflection through the medium of the
brain." (Physiology of the Senses, p. 1311.) And again by the maxim
"that the mental principle, or cause of the mental phenomena,
cannot be confined to the brain, but that it exists in a latent
state in every part of the organism." (Ibid., p. 1355.) The "nerve
power," contended for by Mr. Bain, also may suggest a rational
solution of much that has seemed incredible to those physiologists
who have not condescended to sift the genuine phenomena of
mesmerism from the imposture to which, in all ages, the phenomena
exhibited by what may be called the ecstatic temperament have been
applied.</p>

advances in other words, namely, "the return of the nervous
currents exactly on their old track in revived sensations."</p>

<p>(9) Perhaps it is for the reason suggested in the text, namely,
that the magician requires the interposition of a third imagination
between his own and that of the consulting believer, that any
learned adept in (so-called) magic will invariably refuse to
exhibit without the presence of a third person. Hence the author of
"Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magic," printed at Parisy
1852-53&mdash;a book less remarkable for its learning than for the
earnest belief of a scholar of our own day in the reality of the
art of which he records the history&mdash;insists much on the
necessity of rigidly observing Le Ternaire, in the number of

asserted by Julius Faber in the text.</p>

<p>(12) It seems extremely doubtful whether the very few instances
in which it has been asserted that a savage race has been found
without recognition of a Deity and a future state would bear
searching examination. It is set forth, for example, in most of the
popular works on Australia, that the Australian savages have no
notion of a Deity or a Hereafter, that they only worship a devil,
or evil spirit. This assumption, though made more peremptorily, and
by a greater number of writers than any similar one regarding other
savages, is altogether erroneous, and has no other foundation than
the ignorance of the writers. The Australian savages recognize a
Deity, but He is too august for a name in their own language; in
English they call Him the Great Master,&mdash;an expression
synonymous with "The Great Lord." They believe in a hereafter of
eternal joy, and place it amongst the stars.&mdash;See Strzelecki's
Physical Description of New South Wales.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXII.</h2>

<p>I turned back alone. The sun was reddening the summits of the
distant mountain-range, but dark clouds, that portended rain, were
gathering behind my way and deepening the shadows in many a chasm
and hollow which volcanic fires had wrought on the surface of
uplands undulating like diluvian billows fixed into stone in the
midst of their stormy swell. I wandered on and away from the beaten
track, absorbed in thought. Could I acknowledge in Julius Faber's
conjectures any basis for logical ratiocination; or were they not
the ingenious fancies of that empirical Philosophy of Sentiment by
which the aged, in the decline of severer faculties, sometimes
assimilate their theories to the hazy romance of youth? I can well
conceive that the story I tell will be regarded by most as a wild
and fantastic fable; that by some it may be considered a vehicle
for guesses at various riddles of Nature, without or within us,
which are free to the license of romance, though forbidden to the
caution of science. But, I&mdash;I&mdash;know unmistakably my own
identity, my own positive place in a substantial universe. And
beyond that knowledge, what do I know? Yet had Faber no ground for
his startling parallels between the chimeras of superstition and
the alternatives to faith volunteered by the metaphysical
speculations of knowledge? On the theorems of Condillac, I, in
common with numberless contemporaneous students (for, in my youth,
Condillac held sway in the schools, as now, driven forth from the
schools, his opinions float loose through the talk and the scribble
of men of the world, who perhaps never opened his page),&mdash;on
the theorems of Condillac I had built up a system of thought
designed to immure the swathed form of material philosophy from all
rays and all sounds of a world not material, as the walls of some
blind mausoleum shut out, from the mummy within, the whisper of
winds and the gleaming of stars.</p>

<p>And did not those very theorems, when carried out to their
strict and completing results by the close reasonings of Hume,
resolve my own living identity, the one conscious indivisible me,
into a bundle of memories derived from the senses which had bubbled
and duped my experience, and reduce into a phantom, as spectral as
that of the Luminous Shadow, the whole solid frame of creation?</p>

<p>While pondering these questions, the storm whose forewarnings I
had neglected to heed burst forth with all the suddenness peculiar
to the Australian climes. The rains descended like the rushing of
floods. In the beds of watercourses, which, at noon, seemed dried
up and exhausted, the torrents began to swell and to rave; the gray
crags around them were animated into living waterfalls. I looked
round, and the landscape was as changed as a scene that replaces a
scene on the player's stage. I was aware that I had wandered far
from my home, and I knew not what direction I should take to regain
it. Close at hand, and raised above the torrents that now rushed in
many a gully and tributary creek, around and before me, the mouth
of a deep cave, overgrown with bushes and creeping flowers tossed
wildly to and fro between the rain from above and the spray of
cascades below, offered a shelter from the storm. I
entered,&mdash;scaring innumerable flocks of bats striking against
me, blinded by the glare of the lightning that followed me into the
cavern, and hastening to resettle themselves on the pendants of
stalactites, or the jagged buttresses of primaeval wall.</p>

<p>From time to time the lightning darted into the gloom and
lingered amongst its shadows; and I saw, by the flash, that the
floors on which I stood were strewed with strange bones, some
amongst them the fossilized relics of races destroyed by the
Deluge. The rain continued for more than two hours with unabated
violence; then it ceased almost as suddenly as it had come on, and
the lustrous moon of Australia burst from the clouds shining bright
as an English dawn, into the hollows of the cave. And then
simultaneously arose all the choral songs of the
wilderness,&mdash;creatures whose voices are heard at
night,&mdash;the loud whir of the locusts, the musical boom of the
bullfrog, the cuckoo note of the morepork, and, mournful amidst all
those merrier sounds, the hoot of the owl, through the wizard
she-oaks and the pale green of the gum-trees.</p>

<p>I stepped forth into the open air and gazed, first instinctively
on the heavens, next, with more heedful eye, upon the earth. The
nature of the soil bore the evidence of volcanic fires long since
extinguished. Just before my feet, the rays fell full upon a bright
yellow streak in the block of quartz half imbedded in the soft
moist soil. In the midst of all the solemn thoughts and the intense
sorrows which weighed upon heart and mind, that yellow gleam
startled the mind into a direction remote from philosophy,
quickened the heart to a beat that chimed with no household
affections. Involuntarily I stooped; impulsively I struck the block
with the hatchet, or tomahawk, I carried habitually about me, for
the purpose of marking the trees that I wished to clear from the
waste of my broad domain. The quartz was shattered by the stroke,
and left disburied its glittering treasure. My first glance had not
deceived me. I, vain seeker after knowledge, had, at least,
discovered gold. I took up the bright metal&mdash;gold! I paused; I
looked round; the land that just before had seemed to me so
worthless took the value of Ophir. Its features had before been as
unknown to me as the Mountains of the Moon, and now my memory
became wonderfully quickened. I recalled the rough map of my
possessions, the first careless ride round their boundaries. Yes,
the land on which I stood&mdash;for miles, to the spur of those
farther mountains&mdash;the land was mine, and, beneath its
surface, there was gold! I closed my eyes; for some moments visions
of boundless wealth, and of the royal power which such wealth could
command, swept athwart my brain. But my heart rapidly settled back
to its real treasure. "What matters," I sighed, "all this dross?
Could Ophir itself buy back to my Lilian's smile one ray of the
light which gave 'glory to the grass and splendour to the
flower'?"</p>

<p>So muttering, I flung the gold into the torrent that raged
below, and went on through the moonlight, sorrowing
silently,&mdash;only thankful for the discovery that had quickened
my reminiscence of the landmarks by which to steer my way through
the wilderness.</p>

<p>The night was half gone, for even when I had gained the familiar
track through the pastures, the swell of the many winding creeks
that now intersected the way obliged me often to retrace my steps;
to find, sometimes, the bridge of a felled tree which had been
providently left unremoved over the now foaming torrent, and, more
than once, to swim across the current, in which swimmers less
strong or less practised would have been dashed down the falls,
where loose logs and torn trees went clattering and whirling: for I
was in danger of life. A band of the savage natives were stealthily
creeping on my track,&mdash;the natives in those parts were not
then so much awed by the white man as now. A boomerang(1) had
whirred by me, burying itself amongst the herbage close before my
feet. I had turned, sought to find and to face these dastardly
foes; they contrived to elude me. But when I moved on, my ear,
sharpened by danger, heard them moving, too, in my rear. Once only
three hideous forms suddenly faced me, springing up from a thicket,
all tangled with honeysuckles and creepers of blue and vermilion. I
walked steadily up to them. They halted a moment or so in suspense;
but perhaps they were scared by my stature or awed by my aspect;
and the Unfamiliar, though Human, had terror for them, as the
Unfamiliar, although but a Shadow, had had terror for me. They
vanished, and as quickly as if they had crept into the earth.</p>

<p>At length the air brought me the soft perfume of my well-known
acacias, and my house stood before me, amidst English flowers and
English fruit-trees, under the effulgent Australian moon. Just as I
was opening the little gate which gave access from the pastureland
into the garden, a figure in white rose up from under light,
feathery boughs, and a hand was laid on my arm. I started; but my
surprise was changed into fear when I saw the pale face and sweet
eyes of Lilian.</p>

<p>"Heavens! you here! you! at this hour! Lilian, what is
this?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, clinging to me; "hush! do not tell: no
one knows. I missed you when the storm came on; I have missed you
ever since. Others went in search of you and came back. I could not
sleep, but the rest are sleeping, so I stole down to watch for you.
Brother, brother, if any harm chanced to you, even the angels could
not comfort me; all would be dark, dark! But you are safe, safe,
safe!" And she clung to me yet closer.</p>

<p>"Ah, Lilian, Lilian, your vision in the hour I first beheld you
was indeed prophetic,&mdash;'each has need of the other.' Do you
remember?"</p>

<p>"Softly, softly," she said, "let me think!" She stood quietly by
my side, looking up into the sky, with all its numberless stars,
and its solitary moon now sinking slow behind the verge of the
forest. "It comes back to me," she murmured softly,&mdash;"the Long
ago,&mdash;the sweet Long ago!"</p>

<p>I held my breath to listen.</p>

<p>"There, there!" she resumed, pointing to the heavens; "do you
see? You are there, and my father, and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh! that
terrible face, those serpent eyes, the dead man's skull! Save me!
save me!"</p>

<p>She bowed her head upon my bosom, and I led her gently back
towards the house. As we gained the door which she had left open,
the starlight shining across the shadowy gloom within, she lifted
her face from my breast, and cast a hurried fearful look round the
shining garden, then into the dim recess beyond the threshold.</p>

<p>"It is there&mdash;there!&mdash;the Shadow that lured me on,
whispering that if I followed it I should join my beloved. False,
dreadful Shadow! it will fade soon,&mdash;fade into the grinning
horrible skull. Brother, brother, where is my Allen? Is he
dead&mdash;dead&mdash;or is it I who am dead to him?"</p>

<p>I could but clasp her again to my breast, and seek to mantle her
shivering form with my dripping garments, all the while my
eyes&mdash;following the direction which hers had taken&mdash;dwelt
on the walls of the nook within the threshold, half lost in
darkness, half white in starlight. And there I, too, beheld the
haunting Luminous Shadow, the spectral effigies of the mysterious
being, whose very existence in the flesh was a riddle unsolved by
my reason. Distinctly I saw the Shadow, but its light was far
paler, its outline far more vague, than when I had beheld it
before. I took courage, as I felt Lilian's heart beating against my
own. I advanced, I crossed the threshold,&mdash;the Shadow was
gone.</p>

<p>"There is no Shadow here,&mdash;no phantom to daunt thee, my
life's life," said I, bending over Lilian.</p>

<p>"It has touched me in passing; I feel it&mdash;cold, cold,
cold!" she answered faintly.</p>

<p>I bore her to her room, placed her on her bed, struck a light,
watched over her. At dawn there was a change in her face, and from
that time health gradually left her; strength slowly, slowly, yet
to me perceptibly, ebbed from her life away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIII.</h2>

<p>Months upon months have rolled on since the night in which
Lilian had watched for my coming amidst the chilling
airs&mdash;under the haunting moon. I have said that from the date
of that night her health began gradually to fail, but in her mind
there was evidently at work some slow revolution. Her visionary
abstractions were less frequent; when they occurred, less
prolonged. There was no longer in her soft face that celestial
serenity which spoke her content in her dreams, but often a look of
anxiety and trouble. She was even more silent than before; but when
she did speak, there were now evident some struggling gleams of
memory. She startled us, at times, by a distinct allusion to the
events and scenes of her early childhood. More than once she spoke
of commonplace incidents and mere acquaintances at L&mdash;&mdash;.
At last she seemed to recognize Mrs. Ashleigh as her mother; but
me, as Allen Fenwick, her betrothed, her bridegroom, no! Once or
twice she spoke to me of her beloved as of a stranger to myself,
and asked me not to deceive her&mdash;should she ever see him
again? There was one change in this new phase of her state that
wounded me to the quick. She had always previously seemed to
welcome my presence; now there were hours, sometimes days together,
in which my presence was evidently painful to her. She would become
agitated when I stole into her room, make signs to me to leave her,
grow yet more disturbed if I did not immediately obey, and become
calm again when I was gone.</p>

<p>Faber sought constantly to sustain my courage and administer to
my hopes by reminding me of the prediction he had
hazarded,&mdash;namely, that through some malady to the frame the
reason would be ultimately restored.</p>

<p>He said, "Observe! her mind was first roused from its slumber by
the affectionate, unconquered impulse of her heart. You were
absent; the storm alarmed her, she missed you,&mdash;feared for
you. The love within her, not alienated, though latent, drew her
thoughts into definite human tracks. And thus, the words that you
tell me she uttered when you appeared before her were words of
love, stricken, though as yet irregularly, as the winds strike the
harp-strings from chords of awakened memory. The same unwonted
excitement, together with lengthened exposure to the cold
night-air, will account for the shock to her physical system, and
the languor and waste of strength by which it has been
succeeded."</p>

<p>"Ay, and the Shadow that we both saw within the threshold. What
of that?"</p>

<p>"Are there no records on evidence, which most physicians of very
extended practice will perhaps allow that their experience more or
less tend to confirm&mdash;no records of the singular coincidences
between individual impressions which are produced by sympathy? Now,
whether you or your Lilian were first haunted by this Shadow I know
not. Perhaps before it appeared to you in the wizard's chamber it
had appeared to her by the Monks' Well. Perhaps, as it came to you
in the prison, so it lured her through the solitudes, associating
its illusory guidance with dreams of you. And again, when she saw
it within your threshold, your fantasy, so abruptly invoked, made
you see with the eyes of your Lilian! Does this doctrine of
sympathy, though by that very mystery you two loved each other at
first,&mdash;though, without it, love at first sight were in itself
an incredible miracle,&mdash;does, I say, this doctrine of sympathy
seem to you inadmissible? Then nothing is left for us but to
revolve the conjecture I before threw out. Have certain
organizations like that of Margrave the power to impress, through
space, the imaginations of those over whom they have forced a
control? I know not. But if they have, it is not supernatural; it
is but one of those operations in Nature so rare and exceptional,
and of which testimony and evidence are so imperfect and so liable
to superstitious illusions, that they have not yet been
traced&mdash;as, if truthful, no doubt they can be, by the patient
genius of science&mdash;to one of those secondary causes by which
the Creator ordains that Nature shall act on Man."</p>

<p>By degrees I became dissatisfied with my conversations with
Faber. I yearned for explanations; all guesses but bewildered me
more. In his family, with one exception, I found no congenial
association. His nephew seemed to me an ordinary specimen of a very
trite human nature,&mdash;a young man of limited ideas, fair moral
tendencies, going mechanically right where not tempted to wrong.
The same desire of gain which had urged him to gamble and speculate
when thrown in societies rife with such example, led him, now in
the Bush, to healthful, industrious, persevering labour. "Spes
fovet agricolas," says the poet; the same Hope which entices the
fish to the hook impels the plough of the husband-man. The young
farmer's young wife was somewhat superior to him; she had more
refinement of taste, more culture of mind, but, living in his life,
she was inevitably levelled to his ends and pursuits; and, next to
the babe in the cradle, no object seemed to her so important as
that of guarding the sheep from the scab and the dingoes. I was
amazed to see how quietly a man whose mind was so stored by life
and by books as that of Julius Faber&mdash;a man who had loved the
clash of conflicting intellects, and acquired the rewards of
fame&mdash;could accommodate himself to the cabined range of his
kinsfolks' half-civilized existence, take interest in their trivial
talk, find varying excitement in the monotonous household of a
peasant-like farmer. I could not help saying as much to him once.
"My friend," replied the old man, "believe me that the happiest art
of intellect, however lofty, is that which enables it to be
cheerfully at home with the Real!"</p>

<p>The only one of the family in which Faber was domesticated in
whom I found an interest, to whose talk I could listen without
fatigue, was the child Amy. Simple though she was in language,
patient of labour as the most laborious, I recognized in her a
quiet nobleness of sentiment, which exalted above the commonplace
the acts of her commonplace life. She had no precocious intellect,
no enthusiastic fancies, but she had an exquisite activity of
heart. It was her heart that animated her sense of duty, and made
duty a sweetness and a joy. She felt to the core the kindness of
those around her; exaggerated, with the warmth of her gratitude,
the claims which that kindness imposed. Even for the blessing of
life, which she shared with all creation, she felt as if singled
out by the undeserved favour of the Creator, and thus was filled
with religion, because she was filled with love.</p>

<p>My interest in this child was increased and deepened by my
saddened and not wholly unremorseful remembrance of the night on
which her sobs had pierced my ear,&mdash;the night from which I
secretly dated the mysterious agencies that had wrenched from their
proper field and career both my mind and my life. But a gentler
interest endeared her to my thoughts in the pleasure that Lilian
felt in her visits, in the affectionate intercourse that sprang up
between the afflicted sufferer and the harmless infant. Often when
we failed to comprehend some meaning which Lilian evidently wished
to convey to us&mdash;we, her mother and her husband&mdash;she was
understood with as much ease by Amy, the unlettered child, as by
Faber, the gray-haired thinker.</p>

<p>"How is it,&mdash;how is it?" I asked, impatiently and
jealously, of Faber. "Love is said to interpret where wisdom fails,
and you yourself talk of the marvels which sympathy may effect
between lover and beloved; yet when, for days together, I cannot
succeed in unravelling Lilian's wish or her thought&mdash;and her
own mother is equally in fault&mdash;you or Amy, closeted alone
with her for five minutes, comprehend and are comprehended."</p>

<p>"Allen," answered Faber, "Amy and I believe in spirit; and she,
in whom mind is dormant but spirit awake, feels in such belief a
sympathy which she has not, in that respect, with yourself, nor
even with her mother. You seek only through your mind to conjecture
hers. Her mother has sense clear enough where habitual experience
can guide it, but that sense is confused, and forsakes her when
forced from the regular pathway in which it has been accustomed to
tread. Amy and I through soul guess at soul, and though mostly
contented with earth, we can both rise at times into heaven. We
pray."</p>

<p>"Alas!" said I, half mournfully, half angrily, "when you thus
speak of Mind as distinct from Soul, it was only in that Vision
which you bid me regard as the illusion of a fancy stimulated by
chemical vapours, producing on the brain an effect similar to that
of opium or the inhalation of the oxide gas, that I have ever seen
the silver spark of the Soul distinct from the light of the Mind.
And holding, as I do, that all intellectual ideas are derived from
the experiences of the body, whether I accept the theory of Locke,
or that of Condillac, or that into which their propositions reach
their final development in the wonderful subtlety of Hume, I cannot
detect the immaterial spirit in the material substance,&mdash;much
less follow its escape from the organic matter in which the
principle of thought ceases with the principle of life. When the
metaphysician, contending for the immortality of the thinking
faculty, analyzes Mind, his analysis comprehends the mind of the
brute, nay, of the insect, as well as that of man. Take Reid's
definition of Mind, as the most comprehensive which I can at the
moment remember: 'By the mind of a man we understand that in him
which thinks, remembers, reasons, and wills.(1) But this definition
only distinguishes the mind of man from that of the brute by
superiority in the same attributes, and not by attributes denied to
the brute. An animal, even an insect, thinks, remembers, reasons,
and wills.(1) Few naturalists will now support the doctrine that
all the mental operations of brute or insect are to be exclusively
referred to instincts; and, even if they do, the word 'instinct' is
a very vague word,&mdash;loose and large enough to cover an abyss
which our knowledge has not sounded. And, indeed, in proportion as
an animal like the dog becomes cultivated by intercourse, his
instincts grow weaker, and his ideas formed by experience (namely,
his mind), more developed, often to the conquest of the instincts
themselves. Hence, with his usual candour, Dr. Abercrombie&mdash;in
contending 'that everything mental ceases to exist after death,
when we know that everything corporeal continues to exist, is a
gratuitous assumption contrary to every rule of philosophical
inquiry'&mdash;feels compelled, by his reasoning, to admit the
probability of a future life even to the lower animals. His words
are: 'To this anode of reasoning it has been objected that it would
go to establish an immaterial principle in the lower animals which
in them exhibits many of the phenomena of mind. I have only to
answer, Be it so. There are in the lower animals many of the
phenomena of mind, and with regard to these, we also contend that
they are entirely distinct from anything we know of the properties
of matter, which is all that we mean, or can mean, by being
immaterial.'(2) Am I then driven to admit that if man's mind is
immaterial and imperishable, so also is that of the ape and the
ant?"</p>

<p>"I own," said Faber, with his peculiar smile, arch and genial,
"that if I were compelled to make that admission, it would not
shock my pride. I do not presume to set any limit to the goodness
of the Creator; and should be as humbly pleased as the Indian, if
in&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "'yonder sky,
    My faithful dog should bear me company.'
</pre>

<p>"You are too familiar with the works of that Titan in wisdom and
error, Descartes, not to recollect the interesting correspondence
between the urbane philosopher and our combative countryman, Henry
More,(3) on this very subject; in which certainly More has the best
of it when Descartes insists on reducing what he calls the soul
(l'ame) of brutes into the same kind of machines as man constructs
from inorganized matter. The learning, indeed, lavished on the
insoluble question involved in the psychology of the inferior
animals is a proof at least of the all-inquisitive, redundant
spirit of man.(4) We have almost a literature in itself devoted to
endeavours to interpret the language of brutes.(5) Dupont de
Nemours has discovered that dogs talk in vowels, using only two
consonants, G, Z, when they are angry. He asserts that cats employ
the same vowels as dogs; but their language is more affluent in
consonants, including M, N, B, R, V, F. How many laborious efforts
have been made to define and to construe the song of the
nightingale! One version of that song, by Beckstein, the
naturalist, published in 1840, I remember to have seen. And I heard
a lady, gifted with a singularly charming voice, chant the
mysterious vowels with so exquisite a pathos, that one could not
refuse to believe her when she declared that she fully comprehended
the bird's meaning, and gave to the nightingale's warble the tender
interpretation of her own woman's heart.</p>

<p>"But leaving all such discussions to their proper place amongst
the Curiosities of Literature, I come in earnest to the question
you have so earnestly raised; and to me the distinction between man
and the lower animals in reference to a spiritual nature designed
for a future existence, and the mental operations whose uses are
bounded to an existence on earth, seems ineffaceably clear. Whether
ideas or even perceptions be innate or all formed by experience is
a speculation for metaphysicians, which, so far as it affects the
question of as immaterial principle, I am quite willing to lay
aside. I can well understand that a materialist may admit innate
ideas in Man, as he must admit them in the instinct of brutes,
tracing them to hereditary predispositions. On the other hand, we
know that the most devout believers in our spiritual nature have
insisted, with Locke, in denying any idea, even of the Deity, to be
innate.</p>

<p>"But here comes my argument. I care not how ideas are
formed,&mdash;the material point is, how are the capacities to
receive ideas formed? The ideas may all come from experience, but
the capacity to receive the ideas must be inherent. I take the word
'capacity' as a good plain English word, rather than the more
technical word 'receptivity,' employed by Kant. And by capacity I
mean the passive power(6) to receive ideas, whether in man or in
any living thing by which ideas are received. A man and an elephant
is each formed with capacities to receive ideas suited to the
several places in the universe held by each.</p>

<p>"The more I look through Nature the more I find that on all
varieties of organized life is carefully bestowed the capacity to
receive the impressions, be they called perceptions or ideas, which
are adapted to the uses each creature is intended to derive from
them. I find, then, that Man alone is endowed with the capacity to
receive the ideas of a God, of Soul, of Worship, of a Hereafter. I
see no trace of such a capacity in the inferior races; nor, however
their intelligence may be refined by culture, is such capacity ever
apparent in them.</p>

<p>"But wherever capacities to receive impressions are sufficiently
general in any given species of creature to be called universal to
that species, and yet not given to another species, then, from all
analogy throughout Nature, those capacities are surely designed by
Providence for the distinct use and conservation of the species to
which they are given.</p>

<p>"It is no answer to me to say that the inherent capacities thus
bestowed on Man do not suffice in themselves to make him form right
notions of a Deity or a Hereafter; because it is plainly the design
of Providence that Man must learn to correct and improve all his
notions by his own study and observation. He must build a hut
before he can build a Parthenon; he must believe with the savage or
the heathen before he can believe with the philosopher or
Christian. In a word, in all his capacities, Man has only given to
him, not the immediate knowledge of the Perfect, but the means to
strive towards the Perfect. And thus one of the most accomplished
of modern reasoners, to whose lectures you must have listened with
delight, in your college days, says well:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "'Accordingly the sciences always studied with keenest interest are
     those in a state of progress and uncertainty; absolute certainty and
     absolute completion would be the paralysis of any study, and the last
     worst calamity that could befall Man, as he is at present
     constituted, would be that full and final possession of speculative
     truth which he now vainly anticipates as the consummation of his
     intellectual happiness.'(7)
</pre>

<p>"Well, then, in all those capacities for the reception of
impressions from external Nature which are given to Man and not to
the brutes, I see the evidence of Man's Soul. I can understand why
the inferior animal has no capacity to receive the idea of a Deity
and of Worship&mdash;simply because the inferior animal, even if
graciously admitted to a future life, may not therein preserve the
sense of its identity. I can understand even why that sympathy with
each other which we men possess and which constitutes the great
virtue we emphatically call Humanity, is not possessed by the
lesser animals (or, at least, in a very rare and exceptional
degree) even where they live in communities, like beavers, or bees,
or ants; because men are destined to meet, to know, and to love
each other in the life to come, and the bond between the brute
ceases here.</p>

<p>"Now the more, then, we examine the inherent capacities bestowed
distinctly and solely on Man, the more they seem to distinguish him
from the other races by their comprehension of objects beyond his
life upon this earth.</p>

<pre>
   "'Man alone,' says Muller, 'can conceive abstract notions; and it is in
     abstract notions&mdash;such as time, space, matter, spirit, light, form,
     quantity, essence&mdash;that man grounds, not only all philosophy, all
     science, but all that practically improves one generation for the
     benefit of the next.'
</pre>

<p>"And why? Because all these abstract notions unconsciously lead
the mind away from the material into the immaterial,&mdash;from the
present into the future. But if Man ceases to exist when he
disappears in the grave, you must be compelled to affirm that he is
the only creature in existence whom Nature or Providence has
condescended to deceive and cheat by capacities for which there are
no available objects. How nobly and how truly has Chalmers
said:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
   "'What inference shall we draw from this remarkable law in Nature that
     there is nothing waste and nothing meaningless in the feelings and
     faculties wherewith living creatures are endowed?  For each desire
     there is a counterpart object; for each faculty there is room and
     opportunity for exercise either in the present or the coming
     futurity.  Now, but for the doctrine of immortality, Man would be an
     exception to this law,-he would stand forth as an anomaly in Nature,
     with aspirations in his heart for which the universe had no antitype
     to offer, with capacities of understanding and thought that never
     were to be followed by objects of corresponding greatness through the
     whole history of his being!

              ............

   "'With the inferior animals there is a certain squareness of
     adjustment, if we may so term it, between each desire and its
     correspondent gratification.  The one is evenly met by the other, and
     there is a fulness and definiteness of enjoyment up to the capacity
     of enjoyment.  Not so with Man, who, both from the vastness of his
     propensities and the vastness of his powers, feels himself chained
     and beset in a field too narrow for him.  He alone labours under the
     discomfort of an incongruity between his circumstances and his
     powers; and unless there be new circumstances awaiting him in a more
     advanced state of being, he, the noblest of Nature's products here,
     would turn out to be the greatest of her failures.'(8)
</pre>

<p>"This, then, I take to be the proof of Soul in Man, not that he
has a mind&mdash;because, as you justly say, inferior animals have
that, though in a lesser degree&mdash;but because he has the
capacities to comprehend, as soon as he is capable of any abstract
ideas whatsoever, the very truths not needed for self-conservation
on earth, and therefore not given to yonder ox and
opossum,&mdash;namely, the nature of Deity, Soul, Hereafter. And in
the recognition of these truths, the Human society, that excels the
society of beavers, bees, and ants, by perpetual and progressive
improvement on the notions inherited from its progenitors, rests
its basis. Thus, in fact, this world is benefited for men by their
belief in the next, while the society of brutes remains age after
age the same. Neither the bee nor the beaver has, in all
probability, improved since the Deluge.</p>

<p>"But inseparable from the conviction of these truths is the
impulse of prayer and worship. It does not touch my argument when a
philosopher of the school of Bolingbroke or Lucretius says, 'that
the origin of prayer is in Man's ignorance of the phenomena of
Nature.' That it is fear or ignorance which, 'when rocked the
mountains or when groaned the ground, taught the weak to bend, the
proud to pray.' My answer is, the brutes are much more forcibly
impressed by natural phenomena than Man is; the bird and the beast
know before you and I do when the mountain will rock and the ground
groan, and their instinct leads them to shelter; but it does not
lead them to prayer. If my theory be right that Soul is to be
sought not in the question whether mental ideas be innate or formed
by experience, by the sense, by association or habit, but in the
inherent capacity to receive ideas, then, the capacity bestowed on
Man alone, to be impressed by Nature herself with the idea of a
Power superior to Nature, with which Power he can establish
commune, is a proof that to Man alone the Maker has made Nature
itself proclaim His existence,&mdash;that to Man alone the Deity
vouchsafes the communion with Himself which comes from prayer."</p>

<p>"Even were this so," said I, "is not the Creator omniscient? If
all-wise, all-foreseeing? If all-foreseeing, all-pre-ordaining? Can
the prayer of His creature alter the ways of His will?"</p>

<p>"For the answer to a question," returned Faber, "which is not
unfrequently asked by the clever men of the world, I ought to refer
you to the skilled theologians who have so triumphantly carried the
reasoner over that ford of doubt which is crossed every day by the
infant. But as we have not their books in the wilderness, I am
contented to draw my reply as a necessary and logical sequence from
the propositions I have sought to ground on the plain observation
of Nature. I can only guess at the Deity's Omniscience, or His
modes of enforcing His power by the observation of His general
laws; and of all His laws, I know of none more general than the
impulse which bids men pray,&mdash;which makes Nature so act, that
all the phenomena of Nature we can conceive, however startling and
inexperienced, do not make the brute pray, but there is not a
trouble that can happen to Man, but what his impulse is to
pray,&mdash;always provided, indeed, that he is not a philosopher.
I say not this in scorn of the philosopher, to whose wildest guess
our obligations are infinite, but simply because for all which is
impulsive to Man, there is a reason in Nature which no philosophy
can explain away. I do not, then, bewilder myself by seeking to
bind and limit the Omniscience of the Deity to my finite ideas. I
content myself with supposing that somehow or other, He has made it
quite compatible with His Omniscience that Man should obey the
impulse which leads him to believe that, in addressing a Deity, he
is addressing a tender, compassionate, benignant Father, and in
that obedience shall obtain beneficial results. If that impulse be
an illusion, then we must say that Heaven governs the earth by a
lie; and that is impossible, because, reasoning by analogy, all
Nature is truthful,&mdash;that is, Nature gives to no species
instincts or impulses which are not of service to it. Should I not
be a shallow physician if, where I find in the human organization a
principle or a property so general that I must believe it normal to
the healthful conditions of that organization, I should refuse to
admit that Nature intended it for use? Reasoning by all analogy,
must I not say the habitual neglect of its use must more or less
injure the harmonious well-being of the whole human system? I could
have much to add upon the point in dispute by which the creed
implied in your question would enthrall the Divine mercy by the
necessities of its Divine wisdom, and substitute for a benignant
Deity a relentless Fate. But here I should exceed my province. I am
no theologian. Enough for me that in all my afflictions, all my
perplexities, an impulse, that I obey as an instinct, moves me at
once to prayer. Do I find by experience that the prayer is heard,
that the affliction is removed, the doubt is solved? That, indeed,
would be presumptuous to say. But it is not presumptuous to think
that by the efficacy of prayer my heart becomes more fortified
against the sorrow, and my reason more serene amidst the
doubt."</p>

<p>I listened, and ceased to argue. I felt as if in that solitude,
and in the pause of my wonted mental occupations, my intellect was
growing languid, and its old weapons rusting in disuse. My pride
took alarm. I had so from my boyhood cherished the idea of fame,
and so glorified the search after knowledge, that I recoiled in
dismay from the thought that I had relinquished knowledge, and cut
myself off from fame. I resolved to resume my once favourite
philosophical pursuits, re-examine and complete the Work to which I
had once committed my hopes of renown; and, simultaneously, a
restless desire seized me to communicate, though but at brief
intervals, with other minds than those immediately within my
reach,&mdash;minds fresh from the old world, and reviving the
memories of its vivid civilization. Emigrants frequently passed my
doors, but I had hitherto shrunk from tendering the hospitalities
so universally accorded in the colony. I could not endure to expose
to such rough strangers my Lilian's mournful affliction, and that
thought was not less intolerable to Mrs. Ashleigh. I now hastily
constructed a log-building a few hundred yards from the house, and
near the main track taken by travellers through the spacious
pastures. I transported to this building my books and scientific
instruments. In an upper story I placed my telescopes and lenses,
my crucibles and retorts. I renewed my chemical experiments; I
sought to invigorate my mind by other branches of science which I
had hitherto less cultured,&mdash;meditated new theories on Light
and Colour, collected specimens in Natural History, subjected
animalcules to my microscope, geological fossils to my hammer. With
all these quickened occupations of thought, I strove to distract
myself from sorrow, and strengthen my reason against the illusion
of my fantasy. The Luminous Shadow was not seen again on my wall,
and the thought of Margrave himself was banished.</p>

<p>In this building I passed many hours of each day; more and more
earnestly plunging my thoughts into depths of abstract study, as
Lilian's unaccountable dislike to my presence became more and more
decided. When I thus ceased to think that my life cheered and
comforted hers, my heart's occupation was gone. I had annexed to
the apartment reserved for myself in the log-hut a couple of spare
rooms, in which I could accommodate passing strangers. I learned to
look forward to their coming with interest, and to see them depart
with regret; yet, for the most part, they were of the ordinary
class of colonial adventurers,&mdash;bankrupt tradesmen, unlucky
farmers, forlorn mechanics, hordes of unskilled labourers, now and
then a briefless barrister, or a sporting collegian who had lost
his all on the Derby. One day, however, a young man of education
and manners that unmistakably proclaimed the cultured gentleman of
Europe, stopped at my door. He was a cadet of a noble Prussian
family, which for some political reasons had settled itself in
Paris; there he had become intimate with young French nobles, and
living the life of a young French noble had soon scandalized his
German parents, forestalled his slender inheritance, and been
compelled to fly his father's frown and his tailor's bills. All
this he told me with a lively frankness which proved how much the
wit of a German can be quickened in the atmosphere of Paris. An old
college friend, of birth inferior to his own, had been as
unfortunate in seeking to make money as this young prodigal had
been an adept in spending it. The friend, a few years previously,
had accompanied other Germans in a migration to Australia, and was
already thriving; the spendthrift noble was on his way to join the
bankrupt trader, at a German settlement fifty miles distant from my
house. This young man was unlike any German I ever met. He had all
the exquisite levity by which the well-bred Frenchman gives to the
doctrines of the Cynic the grace of the Epicurean. He owned himself
to be good for nothing with an elegance of candour which not only
disarmed censure, but seemed to challenge admiration; and, withal,
the happy spendthrift was so inebriate with hope,&mdash;sure that
he should be rich before he was thirty. How and wherefore rich, he
could have no more explained than I can square the circle. When the
grand serious German nature does Frenchify itself, it can become so
extravagantly French!</p>

<p>I listened, almost enviously, to this light-hearted profligate's
babble, as we sat by my rude fireside,&mdash;I, sombre man of
science and sorrow, he, smiling child of idleness and pleasure, so
much one of Nature's courtier-like nobles, that there, as he smoked
his villanous pipe, in his dust-soiled shabby garments, and with
his ruffianly revolver stuck into his belt, I would defy the
daintiest Aristarch who ever presided as critic over the holiday
world not to have said, "There smiles the genius beyond my laws,
the born darling of the Graces, who in every circumstance, in every
age, like Aristippus, would have socially charmed; would have been
welcome to the orgies of a Caesar or a Clodius, to the boudoirs of
a Montespan or a Pompadour; have lounged through the Mulberry
Gardens with a Rochester and a Buckingham, or smiled from the
death-cart, with a Richelieu and a Lauzun, a gentleman's disdain of
a mob!"</p>

<p>I was so thinking as we sat, his light talk frothing up from his
careless lips, when suddenly from the spray and the sparkle of that
light talk was flung forth the name of Margrave.</p>

<p>"Margrave!" I exclaimed. "Pardon me. What of him?"</p>

<p>"What of him! I asked if, by chance, you knew the only
Englishman I ever had the meanness to envy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you speak of one person, and I thought of another."</p>

<p>"Pardieu, my dear host, there can scarcely be two Margraves! The
one of whom I speak flashed like a meteor upon Paris, bought from a
prince of the Bourse a palace that might have lodged a prince of
the blood-royal, eclipsed our Jew bankers in splendour, our
jeunesse doree in good looks and hair-brain adventures, and,
strangest of all, filled his salons with philosophers and
charlatans, chemists and spirit-rappers; insulting the gravest dons
of the schools by bringing them face to face with the most impudent
quacks, the most ridiculous dreamers,&mdash;and yet, withal,
himself so racy and charming, so bon prince, so bon enfant! For six
months he was the rage at Paris: perhaps he might have continued to
be the rage there for six years, but all at once the meteor
vanished as suddenly as it had flashed. Is this the Margrave whom
you know?"</p>

<p>"I should not have thought the Margrave whom I knew could have
reconciled his tastes to the life of cities."</p>

<p>"Nor could this man: cities were too tame for him. He has gone
to some far-remote wilds in the East,&mdash;some say in search of
the Philosopher's Stone; for he actually maintained in his house a
Sicilian adventurer, who, when at work on that famous discovery,
was stifled by the fumes of his own crucible. After that
misfortune, Margrave took Paris in disgust, and we lost him."</p>

<p>"So this is the only Englishman whom you envy! Envy him?
Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he is the only Englishman I ever met who contrived to
be rich and yet free from the spleen; I envied him because one had
only to look at his face and see how thoroughly he enjoyed the life
of which your countrymen seem to be so heartily tired. But now that
I have satisfied your curiosity, pray satisfy mine. Who and what is
this Englishman?"</p>

<p>"Who and what was he supposed at Paris to be?"</p>

<p>"Conjectures were numberless. One of your countrymen suggested
that which was the most generally favoured. This gentleman, whose
name I forget, but who was one of those old roues who fancy
themselves young because they live with the young, no sooner set
eyes upon Margrave, than he exclaimed, 'Louis Grayle come to life
again, as I saw him forty-four years ago! But no&mdash;still
younger, still handsomer&mdash;it must be his son!"</p>

<p>"Louis Grayle, who was said to be murdered at Aleppo?"</p>

<p>"The same. That strange old man was enormously rich; but it
seems that he hated his lawful heirs, and left behind him a fortune
so far below that which he was known to possess that he must
certainly have disposed of it secretly before his death. Why so
dispose of it, if not to enrich some natural son, whom, for private
reasons, he might not have wished to acknowledge, or point out to
the world by the signal bequest of his will? All that Margrave ever
said of himself and the source of his wealth confirmed this belief.
He frankly proclaimed himself a natural son, enriched by a father
whose name he knew not nor cared to know."</p>

<p>"It is true. And Margrave quitted Paris for the East. When?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you the date within a day or two, for his flight
preceded mine by a week; and, happily, all Paris was so busy in
talking of it, that I slipped away without notice."</p>

<p>And the Prussian then named a date which it thrilled me to hear,
for it was in that very month, and about that very day, that the
Luminous Shadow had stood within my threshold.</p>

<p>The young count now struck off into other subjects of talk:
nothing more was said of Margrave. An hour or two afterwards he
went on his way, and I remained long gazing musingly on the embers
of the dying glow on my hearth.</p>

<p>(1) "Are intelligence and instinct, thus differing in their
relative proportion in man as compared with all other animals, yet
the same in kind and manner of operation in both? To this question
we must give at once an affirmative answer. The expression of
Cuvier, regarding the faculty of reasoning in lower animals, 'Leur
intelligence execute des operations du meme genre,' is true in its
full sense. We can in no manner define reason so as to exclude acts
which are at every moment present to our observation, and which we
find in many instances to contravene the natural instincts of the
species. The demeanour and acts of the dog in reference to his
master, or the various uses to which he is put by man, are as
strictly logical as those we witness in the ordinary transactions
of life."&mdash;Sir Henry Holland, chapters on "Mental Physiology,"
p. 220.</p>

<p>The whole of the chapter on Instincts and Habits in this work
should be read in connection with the passage just quoted. The work
itself, at once cautious and suggestive, is not one of the least
obligations which philosophy and religion alike owe to the
lucubrations of English medical men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIV.</h2>

<p>My Work, my Philosophical Work&mdash;the ambitious hope of my
intellectual life&mdash;how eagerly I returned to it again! Far
away from my household grief, far away from my haggard
perplexities&mdash;neither a Lilian nor a Margrave there!</p>

<p>As I went over what I had before written, each link in its chain
of reasoning seemed so serried, that to alter one were to derange
all; and the whole reasoning was so opposed to the possibility of
the wonders I myself had experienced, so hostile to the subtle
hypotheses of a Faber, or the childlike belief of an Amy, that I
must have destroyed the entire work if I had admitted such
contradictions to its design!</p>

<p>But the work was I myself!&mdash;I, in my solid, sober,
healthful mind, before the brain had been perplexed by a phantom.
Were phantoms to be allowed as testimonies against science? No; in
returning to my Book, I returned to my former Me!</p>

<p>How strange is that contradiction between our being as man and
our being as Author! Take any writer enamoured of a system: a
thousand things may happen to him every day which might shake his
faith in that system; and while he moves about as mere man, his
faith is shaken. But when he settles himself back into the phase of
his being as author, the mere act of taking pen in hand and
smoothing the paper before him restores his speculations to their
ancient mechanical train. The system, the beloved system, reasserts
its tyrannic sway, and he either ignores, or moulds into fresh
proofs of his theory as author, all which, an hour before, had
given his theory the lie in his living perceptions as man.</p>

<p>I adhered to my system,&mdash;I continued my work. Here, in the
barbarous desert, was a link between me and the Cities of Europe.
All else might break down under me. The love I had dreamed of was
blotted out from the world, and might never be restored; my heart
might be lonely, my life be an exile's. My reason might, at last,
give way before the spectres which awed my senses, or the sorrow
which stormed my heart. But here at least was a monument of my
rational thoughtful Me,&mdash;of my individualized identity in
multiform creation. And my mind, in the noon of its force, would
shed its light on the earth when my form was resolved to its
elements. Alas! in this very yearning for the Hereafter, though but
the Hereafter of a Name, could I see only the craving of Mind, and
hear not the whisper of Soul!</p>

<p>The avocation of a colonist, usually so active, had little
interest for me. This vast territorial lordship, in which, could I
have endeared its possession by the hopes that animate a Founder, I
should have felt all the zest and the pride of ownership, was but
the run of a common to the passing emigrant, who would leave no son
to inherit the tardy products of his labour. I was not goaded to
industry by the stimulus of need. I could only be ruined if I
risked all my capital in the attempt to improve. I lived,
therefore, amongst my fertile pastures, as careless of culture as
the English occupant of the Highland moor, which he rents for the
range of its solitudes.</p>

<p>I knew, indeed, that if ever I became avaricious, I might swell
my modest affluence into absolute wealth. I had revisited the spot
in which I had discovered the nugget of gold, and had found the
precious metal in rich abundance just under the first coverings of
the alluvial soil. I concealed my discovery from all. I knew that,
did I proclaim it, the charm of my bush-life would be gone. My
fields would be infested by all the wild adventurers who gather to
gold as the vultures of prey round a carcass; my servants would
desert me, my very flocks would be shepherdless!</p>

<p>Months again rolled on months. I had just approached the close
of my beloved Work, when it was again suspended, and by an anguish
keener than all which I had previously known.</p>

<p>Lilian became alarmingly ill. Her state of health, long
gradually declining, had hitherto admitted checkered intervals of
improvement, and exhibited no symptoms of actual danger. But now
she was seized with a kind of chronic fever, attended with absolute
privation of sleep, an aversion to even the lightest nourishment,
and an acute nervous susceptibility to all the outward impressions
of which she had long seemed so unconscious; morbidly alive to the
faintest sound, shrinking from the light as from a torture. Her
previous impatience at my entrance into her room became aggravated
into vehement emotions, convulsive paroxysms of distress; so that
Faber banished me from her chamber, and, with a heart bleeding at
every fibre, I submitted to the cruel sentence.</p>

<p>Faber had taken up his abode in my house and brought Amy with
him; one or the other never left Lilian, night or day. The great
physician spoke doubtfully of the case, but not despairingly.</p>

<p>"Remember," he said, "that in spite of the want of sleep, the
abstinence from food, the form has not wasted as it would do were
this fever inevitably mortal. It is upon that phenomenon I build a
hope that I have not been mistaken in the opinion I hazarded from
the first. We are now in the midst of the critical struggle between
life and reason; if she preserve the one, my conviction is that she
will regain the other. That seeming antipathy to yourself is a good
omen. You are inseparably associated with her intellectual world;
in proportion as she revives to it, must become vivid and powerful
the reminiscences of the shock that annulled, for a time, that
world to her. So I welcome, rather than fear, the
over-susceptibility of the awakening senses to external sights and
sounds. A few days will decide if I am right. In this climate the
progress of acute maladies is swift, but the recovery from them is
yet more startlingly rapid. Wait, endure, be prepared to submit to
the will of Heaven; but do not despond of its mercy."</p>

<p>I rushed away from the consoler,&mdash;away into the thick of
the forests, the heart of the solitude. All around me, there, was
joyous with life; the locust sang amidst the herbage; the cranes
gambolled on the banks of the creek; the squirrel-like opossums
frolicked on the feathery boughs. "And what," said I to
myself,&mdash;"what if that which seems so fabulous in the distant
being whose existence has bewitched my own, be substantially true?
What if to some potent medicament Margrave owes his glorious
vitality, his radiant youth? Oh, that I had not so disdainfully
turned away from his hinted solicitations&mdash;to what?&mdash;to
nothing guiltier than lawful experiment. Had I been less devoted a
bigot to this vain schoolcraft, which we call the Medical Art, and
which, alone in this age of science, has made no perceptible
progress since the days of its earliest teachers&mdash;had I said,
in the true humility of genuine knowledge, 'these alchemists were
men of genius and thought; we owe to them nearly all the grand
hints of our chemical science,&mdash;is it likely that they would
have been wholly drivellers and idiots in the one faith they clung
to the most?'&mdash;had I said that, I might now have no fear of
losing my Lilian. Why, after all, should there not be in Nature one
primary essence, one master substance; in which is stored the
specific nutriment of life?"</p>

<p>Thus incoherently muttering to the woods what my pride of reason
would not have suffered me gravely to say to my fellow-men, I
fatigued my tormented spirits into a gloomy calm, and mechanically
retraced my steps at the decline of day. I seated myself at the
door of my solitary log-hut, lean ing my cheek upon my hand, and
musing. Wearily I looked up, roused by a discord of clattering
hoofs and lumbering wheels on the hollow-sounding grass-track. A
crazy groaning vehicle, drawn by four horses, emerged from the
copse of gum-trees,&mdash;fast, fast along the road, which no such
pompous vehicle had traversed since that which had borne
me&mdash;luxurious satrap for an early colonist&mdash;to my lodge
in the wilderness. What emigrant rich enough to squander in the
hire of such an equipage more than its cost in England, could thus
be entering on my waste domain? An ominous thrill shot through
me.</p>

<p>The driver&mdash;perhaps some broken-down son of luxury in the
Old World, fit for nothing in the New World but to ply, for hire,
the task that might have led to his ruin when plied in
sport&mdash;stopped at the door of my hut, and called out, "Friend,
is not this the great Fenwick Section, and is not yonder long pile
of building the Master's house?"</p>

<p>Before I could answer I heard a faint voice, within the vehicle,
speaking to the driver; the last nodded, descended from his seat,
opened the carriage-door, and offered his arm to a man, who, waving
aside the proffered aid, descended slowly and feebly; paused a
moment as if for breath, and then, leaning on his staff, walked
from the road, across the sward rank with luxuriant herbage,
through the little gate in the new-set fragrant wattle-fence,
wearily, languidly, halting often, till he stood facing me, leaning
both wan and emaciated hands upon his staff, and his meagre form
shrinking deep within the folds of a cloak lined thick with costly
sables. His face was sharp, his complexion of a livid yellow, his
eyes shone out from their hollow orbits, unnaturally enlarged and
fatally bright. Thus, in ghastly contrast to his former splendour
of youth and opulence of life, Margrave stood before me.</p>

<p>"I come to you," said Margrave, in accents hoarse and broken,
"from the shores of the East. Give me shelter and rest. I have that
to say which will more than repay you."</p>

<p>Whatever, till that moment, my hate and my fear of this
unexpected visitant, hate would have been inhumanity, fear a
meanness, conceived for a creature so awfully stricken down.</p>

<p>Silently, involuntarily, I led him into the house. There he
rested a few minutes, with closed eyes and painful gasps for
breath. Meanwhile, the driver brought from the carriage a
travelling-bag and a small wooden chest or coffer, strongly banded
with iron clamps. Margrave, looking up as the man drew near,
exclaimed fiercely, "Who told you to touch that chest? How dare
you? Take it from that man, Fenwick! Place it here,&mdash;here by
my side!"</p>

<p>I took the chest from the driver, whose rising anger at being so
imperiously rated in the land of democratic equality was appeased
by the gold which Margrave lavishly flung to him.</p>

<p>"Take care of the poor gentleman, squire," he whispered to me,
in the spontaneous impulse of gratitude, "I fear he will not
trouble you long. He must be monstrous rich. Arrived in a vessel
hired all to himself, and a train of outlandish attendants, whom he
has left behind in the town yonder. May I bait my horses in your
stables? They have come a long way."</p>

<p>I pointed to the neighbouring stables, and the man nodded his
thanks, remounted his box, and drove off.</p>

<p>I returned to Margrave. A faint smile came to his lips as I
placed the chest beside him.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," he muttered. "Safe! safe! I shall soon be well
again,&mdash;very soon! And now I can sleep in peace!"</p>

<p>I led him into an inner room, in which there was a bed. He threw
himself on it with a loud sigh of relief. Soon, half raising
himself on his elbow, he exclaimed, "The chest&mdash;bring it
hither! I need it always beside me! There, there! Now for a few
hours of sleep; and then, if I can take food, or some such
restoring cordial as your skill may suggest, I shall be strong
enough to talk. We will talk! we will talk!"</p>

<p>His eyes closed heavily as his voice fell into a drowsy mutter:
a moment more and he was asleep.</p>

<p>I watched beside him, in mingled wonder and compassion. Looking
into that face, so altered yet still so young, I could not sternly
question what had been the evil of that mystic life, which seemed
now oozing away through the last sands in the hour-glass. I placed
my hand softly on his pulse: it scarcely beat. I put my ear to his
breast, and involuntarily sighed, as I distinguished in its
fluttering heave that dull, dumb sound, in which the heart seems
knelling itself to the greedy grave!</p>

<p>Was this, indeed, the potent magician whom I had so
feared!&mdash;this the guide to the Rosicrucian's secret of life's
renewal, in whom, but an hour or two ago, my fancies gulled my
credulous trust!</p>

<p>But suddenly, even while thus chiding my wild superstitions, a
fear, that to most would seem scarcely less superstitious, shot
across me. Could Lilian be affected by the near neighbourhood of
one to whose magnetic influence she had once been so strangely
subjected? I left Margrave still sleeping, closed and locked the
door of the hut, went back to my dwelling, and met Amy at the
threshold. Her smile was so cheering that I felt at once
relieved.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the child, putting her finger to her lips, "she is
so quiet! I was coming in search of you, with a message from
her."</p>

<p>"From Lilian to me&mdash;what! to me!"</p>

<p>"Hush! About an hour ago, she beckoned me to draw near to her,
and then said, very softly: 'Tell Allen that light is coming back
to me, and it all settles on him&mdash;on him. Tell him that I pray
to be spared to walk by his side on earth, hand-in-hand to that
heaven which is no dream, Amy. Tell him that,&mdash;no dream!'"</p>

<p>While the child spoke my tears gushed, and the strong hands in
which I veiled my face quivered like the leaf of the aspen. And
when I could command my voice, I said plaintively,&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I not, then, see her?&mdash;only for a moment, and answer
her message though but by a look?"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"No! Where is Faber?"</p>

<p>"Gone into the forest, in search of some herbs, but he gave me
this note for you."</p>

<p>I wiped the blinding tears from my eyes, and read these
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have, though with hesitation, permitted Amy to tell you the
cheering words, by which our beloved patient confirms my belief
that reason is coming back to her,&mdash;slowly, labouringly, but
if she survive, for permanent restoration. On no account attempt to
precipitate or disturb the work of nature. As dangerous as a sudden
glare of light to eyes long blind and newly regaining vision in the
friendly and soothing dark would be the agitation that your
presence at this crisis would cause. Confide in me."</p>

<p>I remained brooding over these lines and over Lilian's message
long and silently, while Amy's soothing whispers stole into my ear,
soft as the murmurs of a rill heard in the gloom of forests.
Rousing myself at length, my thoughts returned to Margrave.
Doubtless he would soon awake. I bade Amy bring me such slight
nutriment as I thought best suited to his enfeebled state, telling
her it was for a sick traveller, resting himself in my hut. When
Amy returned, I took from her the little basket with which she was
charged, and having, meanwhile, made a careful selection from the
contents of my medicine-chest, went back to the hut. I had not long
resumed my place beside Margrave's pillow before he awoke.</p>

<p>"What o'clock is it?" he asked, with an anxious voice.</p>

<p>"About seven."</p>

<p>"Not later? That is well; my time is precious."</p>

<p>"Compose yourself, and eat."</p>

<p>I placed the food before him, and he partook of it, though
sparingly, and as if with effort. He then dozed for a short time,
again woke up, and impatiently demanded the cordial, which I had
prepared in the mean while. Its effect was greater and more
immediate than I could have anticipated, proving, perhaps, how much
of youth there was still left in his system, however undermined and
ravaged by disease. Colour came back to his cheek, his voice grew
perceptibly stronger. And as I lighted the lamp on the table near
us&mdash;for it was growing dark&mdash;he gathered himself up, and
spoke thus,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You remember that I once pressed on you certain experiments. My
object then was to discover the materials from which is extracted
the specific that enables the organs of life to expel disease and
regain vigour. In that hope I sought your intimacy,&mdash;an
intimacy you gave, but withdrew."</p>

<p>"Dare you complain? Who and what was the being from whose
intimacy I shrank appalled?"</p>

<p>"Ask what questions you please," cried Margrave, impatiently,
"later&mdash;if I have strength left to answer them; but do not
interrupt me, while I husband my force to say what alone is
important to me and to you. Disappointed in the hopes I had placed
in you, I resolved to repair to Paris,&mdash;that great furnace of
all bold ideas. I questioned learned formalists; I listened to
audacious empirics. The first, with all their boasted knowledge,
were too timid to concede my premises; the second, with all their
speculative daring, too knavish to let me trust to their
conclusions. I found but one man, a Sicilian, who comprehended the
secrets that are called occult, and had the courage to meet Nature
and all her agencies face to face. He believed, and sincerely, that
he was approaching the grand result, at the very moment when he
perished from want of the common precautions which a tyro in
chemistry would have taken. At his death the gaudy city became
hateful; all its pretended pleasures only served to exhaust life
the faster. The true joys of youth are those of the wild bird and
wild brute, in the healthful enjoyment of Nature. In cities, youth
is but old age with a varnish. I fled to the East; I passed through
the tents of the Arabs; I was guided&mdash;no matter by whom or by
what&mdash;to the house of a Dervish, who had had for his teacher
the most erudite master of secrets occult, whom I knew years ago at
Aleppo&mdash;-Why that exclamation?"</p>

<p>"Proceed. What I have to say will come&mdash;later."</p>

<p>"From this Dervish I half forced and half purchased the secret I
sought to obtain. I now know from what peculiar substance the
so-called elixir of life is extracted; I know also the steps of the
process through which that task is accomplished. You smile
incredulously. What is your doubt? State it while I rest for a
moment. My breath labours; give me more of the cordial."</p>

<p>"Need I tell you my doubt? You have, you say, at your command
the elixir of life of which Cagliostro did not leave his disciples
the recipe; and you stretch out your hand for a vulgar cordial
which any village chemist could give you!"</p>

<p>"I can explain this apparent contradiction. The process by which
the elixir is extracted from the material which hoards its essence
is one that requires a hardihood of courage which few possess. This
Dervish, who had passed through that process once, was deaf to all
prayer, and unmoved by all bribes, to attempt it again. He was
poor; for the secret by which metals may be transmuted is not, as
the old alchemists seem to imply, identical with that by which the
elixir of life is extracted. He had only been enabled to discover,
in the niggard strata of the lands within range of his travel, a
few scanty morsels of the glorious substance. From these he had
extracted scarcely enough of the elixir to fill a third of that
little glass which I have just drained. He guarded every drop for
himself. Who that holds healthful life as the one boon above all
price to the living, would waste upon others what prolongs and
recruits his own being? Therefore, though he sold me his secret, he
would not sell me his treasure."</p>

<p>"Any quack may sell you the information how to make not only an
elixir, but a sun and a moon, and then scare you from the
experiment by tales of the danger of trying it! How do you know
that this essence which the Dervish possessed was the elixir of
life, since, it seems, you have not tried on yourself what effect
its precious drops could produce? Poor wretch, who once seemed to
me so awfully potent! do you come to the Antipodes in search of a
drug that only exists in the fables by which a child is
amused?"</p>

<p>"The elixir of life is no fable," cried Margrave, with a
kindling of eye, a power of voice, a dilatation of form, that
startled me in one just before so feeble. "That elixir was bright
in my veins when we last met. From that golden draught of the
life-spring of joy I took all that can gladden creation. What sage
would not have exchanged his wearisome knowledge for my lusty
revels with Nature? What monarch would not have bartered his crown,
with its brain-ache of care, for the radiance that circled my
brows, flashing out from the light that was in me? Oh again, oh
again! to enjoy the freedom of air with the bird, and the glow of
the sun with the lizard; to sport through the blooms of the earth,
Nature's playmate and darling; to face, in the forest and desert,
the pard and the lion,&mdash;Nature's bravest and
fiercest,&mdash;her firstborn, the heir of her realm, with the rest
of her children for slaves!"</p>

<p>As these words burst from his lips, there was a wild grandeur in
the aspect of this enigmatical being which I had never beheld in
the former time of his affluent, dazzling youth. And, indeed, in
his language, and in the thoughts it clothed, there was an
earnestness, a concentration, a directness, a purpose, which had
seemed wanting to his desultory talk in the earlier days I expected
that reaction of languor and exhaustion would follow his vehement
outbreak of passion, but, after a short pause, he went on with
steady accents. His will was sustaining his strength. He was
determined to force his convictions on me, and the vitality, once
so rich, rallied all its lingering forces to the aid of its intense
desire.</p>

<p>"I tell you, then," he resumed, with deliberate calmness, "that,
years ago, I tested in my own person that essence which is the
sovereign medicament. In me, as you saw me at L&mdash;&mdash;, you
beheld the proof of its virtues. Feeble and ill as I am now, my
state was incalculably more hopeless when formerly restored by the
elixir. He from whom I then took the sublime restorative died
without revealing the secret of its composition. What I obtained
was only just sufficient to recruit the lamp of my life, then dying
down&mdash;and no drop was left for renewing the light which wastes
its own rays in the air that it gilds. Though the Dervish would not
sell me his treasure, he permitted me to see it. The appearance and
odour of this essence are strangely peculiar,&mdash;unmistakable by
one who has once beheld and partaken of it. In short, I recognized
in the hands of the Dervish the bright life-renewer, as I had borne
it away from the corpse of the Sage of Aleppo."</p>

<p>"Hold! Are you then, in truth, the murderer of Haroun, and is
your true name Louis Grayle?"</p>

<p>"I am no murderer, and Louis Grayle did not leave me his name. I
again adjure you to postpone, for this night at least, the
questions you wish to address to me.</p>

<p>"Seeing that this obstinate pauper possessed that for which the
pale owners of millions, at the first touch of palsy or gout, would
consent to be paupers, of course I coveted the possession of the
essence even more than the knowledge of the substance from which it
is extracted. I had no coward fear of the experiment, which this
timid driveller had not the nerve to renew. But still the
experiment might fail. I must traverse land and sea to find the fit
place for it, while, in the rags of the Dervish, the unfailing
result of the experiment was at hand. The Dervish suspected my
design, he dreaded my power. He fled on the very night in which I
had meant to seize what he refused to sell me. After all, I should
have done him no great wrong; for I should have left him wealth
enough to transport himself to any soil in which the material for
the elixir may be most abundant; and the desire of life would have
given his shrinking nerves the courage to replenish its ravished
store. I had Arabs in my pay, who obeyed me as hounds their master.
I chased the fugitive. I came on his track, reached a house in a
miserable village, in which, I was told, he had entered but an hour
before. The day was declining, the light in the room imperfect. I
saw in a corner what seemed to me the form of the
Dervish,&mdash;stooped to seize it, and my hand closed on an asp.
The artful Dervish had so piled his rags that they took the shape
of the form they had clothed, and he had left, as a substitute for
the giver of life, the venomous reptile of death.</p>

<p>"The strength of my system enabled me to survive the effect of
the poison; but during the torpor that numbed me, my Arabs,
alarmed, gave no chase to my quarry. At last, though enfeebled and
languid, I was again on my horse. Again the pursuit, again the
track! I learned&mdash;but this time by a knowledge surer than
man's&mdash;that the Dervish had taken his refuge in a hamlet that
had sprung up over the site of a city once famed through Assyria.
The same voice that informed me of his whereabouts warned me not to
pursue. I rejected the warning. In my eager impatience I sprang on
to the chase; in my fearless resolve I felt sure of the prey. I
arrived at the hamlet wearied out, for my forces were no longer the
same since the bite of the asp. The Dervish eluded me still; he had
left the floor, on which I sank exhausted, but a few minutes before
my horse stopped at the door. The carpet, on which he had rested,
still lay on the ground. I dismissed the youngest and keenest of my
troop in search of the fugitive. Sure that this time he would not
escape, my eyes closed in sleep.</p>

<p>"How long I slept I know not,&mdash;a long dream of solitude,
fever, and anguish. Was it the curse of the Dervish's carpet? Was
it a taint in the walls of the house, or of the air, which broods
sickly and rank over places where cities lie buried? I know not;
but the Pest of the East had seized me in slumber. When my senses
recovered I found myself alone, plundered of my arms, despoiled of
such gold as I had carried about me. All had deserted and left me,
as the living leave the dead whom the Plague has claimed for its
own. As soon as I could stand I crawled from the threshold. The
moment my voice was heard, my face seen, the whole squalid populace
rose as on a wild beast,&mdash;a mad dog. I was driven from the
place with imprecations and stones, as a miscreant whom the Plague
had overtaken while plotting the death of a holy man. Bruised and
bleeding, but still defying, I turned in wrath on that dastardly
rabble; they slunk away from my path. I knew the land for miles
around. I had been in that land years, long years ago. I came at
last to the road which the caravans take on their way to Damascus.
There I was found, speechless and seemingly lifeless, by some
European travellers. Conveyed to Damascus, I languished for weeks
between life and death. But for the virtue of that essence, which
lingered yet in my veins, I could not have survived&mdash;even thus
feeble and shattered. I need not say that I now abandoned all
thought of discovering the Dervish. I had at least his secret, if I
had failed of the paltry supply he had drawn from its uses. Such
appliances as he had told me were needful are procured in the East
with more ease than in Europe. To sum up, I am here, instructed in
all the knowledge, and supplied with all the aids, which warrant me
in saying, 'Do you care for new life in its richest enjoyments, if
not for yourself, for one whom you love and would reprieve from the
grave? Then, share with me in a task that a single night will
accomplish, and ravish a prize by which the life that you value the
most will be saved from the dust and the worm, to live on, ever
young, ever blooming, when each infant, new-born while I speak,
shall have passed to the grave. Nay, where is the limit to life,
while the earth hides the substance by which life is renewed?"</p>

<p>I give as faithfully as I can recall them the words in which
Margrave addressed me. But who can guess by cold words transcribed,
even were they artfully ranged by a master of language, the effect
words produce when warm from the breath of the speaker? Ask one of
an audience which some orator held enthralled, why his words do not
quicken a beat in the reader's pulse, and the answer of one who had
listened will be, "The words took their charm from the voice and
the eye, the aspect, the manner, the man!" So it was with the
incomprehensible being before me. Though his youth was faded,
though his beauty was dimmed, though my fancies clothed him with
memories of abhorrent dread, though my reason opposed his audacious
beliefs and assumptions, still he charmed and spell-bound me; still
he was the mystical fascinator; still, if the legends of magic had
truth for their basis, he was the born magician,&mdash;as genius,
in what calling soever, is born with the gift to enchant and subdue
us.</p>

<p>Constraining myself to answer calmly, I said, "You have told me
your story; you have defined the object of the experiment in which
you ask me to aid. You do right to bid me postpone my replies or my
questions. Seek to recruit by sleep the strength you have so sorely
tasked. To-morrow&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, ere night, you will decide whether the man whom out
of all earth I have selected to aid me shall be the foe to condemn
me to perish! I tell you plainly I need your aid, and your prompt
aid. Three days from this, and all aid will be too late!"</p>

<p>I had already gained the door of the room, when he called to me
to come back.</p>

<p>"You do not live in this but, but with your family yonder. Do
not tell them that I am here; let no one but yourself see me as I
now am. Lock the door of the hut when you quit it. I should not
close my eyes if I were not secure from intruders."</p>

<p>"There is but one in my house, or in these parts, whom I would
except from the interdict you impose. You are aware of your own
imminent danger; the life, which you believe the discovery of a
Dervish will indefinitely prolong, seems to my eye of physician to
hang on a thread. I have already formed my own conjecture as to the
nature of the disease that enfeebles you. But I would fain compare
that conjecture with the weightier opinion of one whose experience
and skill are superior to mine. Permit me, then, when I return to
you to-morrow, to bring with me the great physician to whom I
refer. His name will not, perhaps, be unknown to you: I speak of
Julius Faber."</p>

<p>"A physician of the schools! I can guess well enough how
learnedly he would prate, and how little he could do. But I will
not object to his visit, if it satisfies you that, since I should
die under the hands of the doctors, I may be permitted to indulge
my own whim in placing my hopes in a Dervish. Yet stay. You have,
doubtless, spoken of me to this Julius Faber, your fellow-physician
and friend? Promise me, if you bring him here, that you will not
name me,&mdash;that you will not repeat to him the tale I have told
you, or the hope which has led me to these shores. What I have told
you, no matter whether, at this moment, you consider me the dupe of
a chimera, is still under the seal of the confidence which a
patient reposes in the physician he himself selects for his
confidant. I select you, and not Julius Faber!"</p>

<p>"Be it as you will," said I, after a moment's reflection. "The
moment you make yourself my patient, I am bound to consider what is
best for you. And you may more respect, and profit by, an opinion
based upon your purely physical condition than by one in which you
might suppose the advice was directed rather to the disease of the
mind than to that of the body."</p>

<p>"How amazed and indignant your brother-physician will be if he
ever see me a second time! How learnedly he will prove that,
according to all correct principles of science and nature, I ought
to be dead!"</p>

<p>He uttered this jest with a faint weary echo of his old merry,
melodious laugh, then turned his face to the wall; and so I left
him to repose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXV.</h2>

<p>I found Mrs. Ashleigh waiting for me in our usual sitting-room.
She was in tears. She had begun to despond of Lilian's recovery,
and she infected me with her own alarm. However, I disguised my
participation in her fears, soothed and sustained her as I best
could, and persuaded her to retire to rest. I saw Faber for a few
minutes before I sought my own chamber. He assured me that there
was no perceptible change for the worse in Lilian's physical state
since he had last seen me, and that her mind, even within the last
few hours, had become decidedly more clear. He thought that, within
the next twenty-four hours, the reason would make a strong and
successful effort for complete recovery; but he declined to hazard
more than a hope that the effort would not exhaust the enfeebled
powers of the frame. He himself was so in need of a few hours of
rest that I ceased to harass him with questions which he could not
answer, and fears which he could not appease. Before leaving him
for the night, I told him briefly that there was a traveller in my
but smitten by a disease which seemed to me so grave that I would
ask his opinion of the case, if he could accompany me to the hut
the next morning.</p>

<p>My own thoughts that night were not such as would suffer me to
sleep.</p>

<p>Before Margrave's melancholy state much of my former fear and
abhorrence faded away. This being, so exceptional that fancy might
well invest him with preternatural attributes, was now reduced by
human suffering to human sympathy and comprehension; yet his utter
want of conscience was still as apparent as in his day of joyous
animal spirits. With what hideous candour he had related his
perfidy and ingratitude to the man to whom, in his belief, he owed
an inestimable obligation, and with what insensibility to the
signal retribution which in most natures would have awakened
remorse!</p>

<p>And by what dark hints and confessions did he seem to confirm
the incredible memoir of Sir Philip Derval! He owned that he had
borne from the corpse of Haroun the medicament to which he ascribed
his recovery from a state yet more hopeless than that under which
he now laboured! He had alluded, rapidly, obscurely, to some
knowledge at his command "surer than man's." And now, even now the
mere wreck of his former existence&mdash;by what strange charm did
he still control and confuse my reason? And how was it that I felt
myself murmuring, again and again, "But what, after all, if his
hope be no chimera, and if Nature do hide a secret by which I could
save the life of my beloved Lilian?"</p>

<p>And again and again, as that thought would force itself on me, I
rose and crept to Lilian's threshold, listening to catch the
faintest sound of her breathing. All still, all dark! In that
sufferer recognized science detects no mortal disease, yet dares
not bid me rely on its amplest resources of skill to turn aside
from her slumber the stealthy advance of death; while in yon
log-hut one whose malady recognized science could not doubt to be
mortal has composed himself to sleep, confident of life! Recognized
science?&mdash;recognized ignorance! The science of to-day is the
ignorance of to-morrow! Every year some bold guess lights up a
truth to which, but the year before, the schoolmen of science were
as blinded as moles.</p>

<p>"What, then," my lips kept repeating,&mdash;"what if Nature do
hide a secret by which the life of my life can be saved? What do we
know of the secrets of Nature? What said Newton himself of his
knowledge? 'I am like a child picking up pebbles and shells on the
sand, while the great ocean of Truth lies all undiscovered around
me!' And did Newton himself, in the ripest growth of his matchless
intellect, hold the creed of the alchemists in scorn? Had he not
given to one object of their research, in the transmutation of
metals, his days and his nights? Is there proof that he ever
convinced himself that the research was the dream, which we, who
are not Newtons, call it?(1) And that other great sage, inferior
only to Newton&mdash;the calculating doubt-weigher,
Descartes&mdash;had he not believed in the yet nobler hope of the
alchemists,&mdash;believed in some occult nostrum or process by
which human life could attain to the age of the Patriarchs?"
(2)</p>

<p>In thoughts like these the night wore away, the moonbeams that
streamed through my window lighting up the spacious solitudes
beyond,&mdash;mead and creek, forest-land, mountaintop,&mdash;and
the silence without broken by the wild cry of the night hawk and
the sibilant melancholy dirge of the shining
chrysococyx,(3)&mdash;bird that never sings but at night, and
obstinately haunts the roofs of the sick and dying, ominous of woe
and death.</p>

<p>But up sprang the sun, and, chasing these gloomy sounds, out
burst the wonderful chorus of Australian groves, the great
kingfisher opening the jocund melodious babble with the glee of his
social laugh.</p>

<p>And now I heard Faber's step in Lilian's room,&mdash;heard
through the door her soft voice, though I could not distinguish the
words. It was not long before I saw the kind physician standing at
the threshold of my chamber. He pressed his finger to his lip, and
made me a sign to follow him. I obeyed, with noiseless tread and
stifled breathing. He awaited me in the garden under the flowering
acacias, passed his arm in mine, and drew me into the open
pasture-land.</p>

<p>"Compose yourself," he then said; "I bring you tidings both of
gladness and of fear. Your Lilian's mind is restored: even the
memories which had been swept away by the fever that followed her
return to her home in L&mdash;&mdash; are returning, though as yet
indistinct. She yearns to see you, to bless you for all your noble
devotion, your generous, greathearted love; but I forbid such
interview now. If, in a few hours, she become either decidedly
stronger or decidedly more enfeebled, you shall be summoned to her
side. Even if you are condemned to a loss for which the sole
consolation must be placed in the life hereafter, you shall have,
at least, the last mortal commune of soul with soul. Courage!
courage! You are man! Bear as man what you have so often bid other
men submit to endure."</p>

<p>I had flung myself on the ground,&mdash;writhing worm that had
no home but on earth! Man, indeed! Man! All, at that moment, I took
from manhood was its acute sensibility to love and to anguish!</p>

<p>But after all such paroxysms of mortal pain, there comes a
strange lull. Thought itself halts, like the still hush of water
between two descending torrents. I rose in a calm, which Faber
might well mistake for fortitude.</p>

<p>"Well," I said quietly, "fulfil your promise. If Lilian is to
pass away from me, I shall see her, at least, again; no wall, you
tell me, between our minds; mind to mind once more,&mdash;once
more!"</p>

<p>"Allen," said Faber, mournfully and softly, "why do you shun to
repeat my words&mdash;soul to soul?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay,&mdash;I understand. Those words mean that you have
resigned all hope that Lilian's life will linger here, when her
mind comes back in full consciousness; I know well that last
lightning flash and the darkness which swallows it up!"</p>

<p>"You exaggerate my fears. I have not resigned the hope that
Lilian will survive the struggle through which she is passing, but
it will be cruel to deceive you&mdash;my hope is weaker than it
was."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay. Again, I understand! Your science is in fault,&mdash;it
desponds. Its last trust is in the wonderful resources of Nature,
the vitality stored in the young!"</p>

<p>"You have said,&mdash;those resources of Nature are wondrous.
The vitality of youth is a fountain springing up from the deeps out
of sight, when, a moment before, we had measured the drops oozing
out from the sands, and thought that the well was exhausted."</p>

<p>"Come with me,&mdash;come. I told you of another sufferer
yonder. I want your opinion of his case. But can you be spared a
few minutes from Lilian's side?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I left her asleep. What is the case that perplexes your
eye of physician, which is usually keener than mine, despite all
the length of my practice?"</p>

<p>"The sufferer is young, his organization rare in its vigour. He
has gone through and survived assaults upon life that are commonly
fatal. His system has been poisoned by the fangs of a venomous asp,
and shattered by the blast of the plague. These alone, I believe,
would not suffice to destroy him. But he is one who has a strong
dread of death; and while the heart was thus languid and feeble, it
has been gnawed by emotions of hope or of fear. I suspect that he
is dying, not from the bite of the reptile, not from the taint of
the pestilence, but from the hope and the fear that have overtasked
the heart's functions. Judge for yourself."</p>

<p>We were now at the door of the hut. I unlocked it: we entered.
Margrave had quitted his bed, and was pacing the room slowly. His
step was less feeble, his countenance less haggard than on the
previous evening.</p>

<p>He submitted himself to Faber's questioning with a quiet
indifference, and evidently cared nothing for any opinion which the
great physician might found on his replies.</p>

<p>When Faber had learned all he could, he said, with a grave
smile: "I see that my advice will have little weight with you; such
as it is, at least reflect on it. The conclusions to which your
host arrived in his view of your case, and which he confided to me,
are, in my humble judgment, correct. I have no doubt that the great
organ of the heart is involved in the cause of your sufferings; but
the heart is a noble and much-enduring organ. I have known men in
whom it has been more severely and unequivocally affected with
disease than it is in you, live on for many years, and ultimately
die of some other disorder. But then life was held, as yours must
be held, upon one condition,&mdash;repose. I enjoin you to abstain
from all violent action, to shun all excitements that cause moral
disturbance. You are young: would you live on, you must live as the
old. More than this,&mdash;it is my duty to warn you that your
tenure on earth is very precarious; you may attain to many years;
you may be suddenly called hence tomorrow. The best mode to regard
this uncertainty with the calm in which is your only chance of long
life, is so to arrange all your worldly affairs, and so to
discipline all your human anxieties, as to feel always prepared for
the summons that may come without warning. For the rest, quit this
climate as soon as you can,&mdash;it is the climate in which the
blood courses too quickly for one who should shun all excitement.
Seek the most equable atmosphere, choose the most tranquil
pursuits; and Fenwick himself, in his magnificent pride of stature
and strength, may be nearer the grave than you are."</p>

<p>"Your opinion coincides with that I have just heard?" asked
Margrave, turning to me.</p>

<p>"In much&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"It is more favourable than I should have supposed. I am far
from disdaining the advice so kindly offered. Permit me, in turn,
two or three questions, Dr. Faber. Do you prescribe to me no drugs
from your pharmacopoeia?"</p>

<p>"Drugs may palliate many sufferings incidental to organic
disease, but drugs cannot reach organic disease itself."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that, even where disease is plainly organic,
Nature herself has no alternative and reparative powers, by which
the organ assailed may recover itself?"</p>

<p>"A few exceptional instances of such forces in Nature are upon
record; but we must go by general laws, and not by exceptions."</p>

<p>"Have you never known instances&mdash;do you not at this moment
know one&mdash;in which a patient whose malady baffles the doctor's
skill, imagines or dreams of a remedy? Call it a whim if you
please, learned sir; do you not listen to the whim, and, in despair
of your own prescriptions, comply with those of the patient?"</p>

<p>Faber changed countenance, and even started. Margrave watched
him and laughed.</p>

<p>"You grant that there are such cases, in which the patient gives
the law to the physician. Now, apply your experience to my case.
Suppose some strange fancy had seized upon my
imagination&mdash;that is the doctor's cant word for all phenomena
which we call exceptional&mdash;some strange fancy that I had
thought of a cure for this disease for which you have no drugs; and
suppose this fancy of mine to be so strong, so vivid, that to deny
me its gratification would produce the very emotion from which you
warn me as fatal,&mdash;storm the heart, that you would soothe to
repose, by the passions of rage and despair,&mdash;would you, as my
trusted physician, concede or deny me my whim?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask? I should grant it at once, if I had no reason to
know that the thing that you fancied was harmful."</p>

<p>"Good man and wise doctor! I have no other question to ask. I
thank you."</p>

<p>Faber looked hard on the young, wan face, over which played a
smile of triumph and irony; then turned away with an expression of
doubt and trouble on his own noble countenance. I followed him
silently into the open air.</p>

<p>"Who and what is this visitor of yours?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Who and what? I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>Faber remained some moments musing, and muttering slowly to
himself, "Tut! but a chance coincidence,&mdash;a haphazard allusion
to a fact which he could not have known!"</p>

<p>"Faber," said I, abruptly, "can it be that Lilian is the patient
in whose self-suggested remedies you confide more than in the
various learning at command of your practised skill?"</p>

<p>"I cannot deny it," replied Faber, reluctantly. "In the
intervals of that suspense from waking sense, which in her is not
sleep, nor yet altogether catalepsy, she has, for the last few
days, stated accurately the precise moment in which the
trance&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash;would pass away, and
prescribed for herself the remedies that should be then
administered. In every instance, the remedies so self-prescribed,
though certainly not those which would have occurred to my mind,
have proved efficacious. Her rapid progress to reason I ascribe to
the treatment she herself ordained in her trance, without
remembrance of her own suggestions when she awoke. I had meant to
defer communicating these phenomena in the idiosyncrasy of her case
until our minds could more calmly inquire into the process by which
ideas&mdash;not apparently derived, as your metaphysical school
would derive all ideas, from preconceived experiences&mdash;will
thus sometimes act like an instinct on the human sufferer for
self-preservation, as the bird is directed to the herb or the berry
which heals or assuages its ailments. We know how the mesmerists
would account for this phenomenon of hygienic introvision and
clairvoyance. But here, there is no mesmerizer, unless the patient
can be supposed to mesmerize herself. Long, however, before
mesmerism was heard of, medical history attests examples in which
patients who baffled the skill of the ablest physicians have fixed
their fancies on some remedy that physicians would call inoperative
for good or for harm, and have recovered by the remedies thus
singularly self-suggested. And Hippocrates himself, if I construe
his meaning rightly, recognizes the powers for self-cure which the
condition of trance will sometimes bestow on the sufferer, 'where'
(says the father of our art) 'the sight being closed to the
external, the soul more truthfully perceives the affections of the
body.' In short&mdash;I own it&mdash;in this instance, the skill of
the physician has been a compliant obedience to the instinct called
forth in the patient; and the hopes I have hitherto permitted
myself to give you were founded on my experience that her own
hopes, conceived in trance, had never been fallacious or
exaggerated. The simples that I gathered for her yesterday she had
described; they are not in our herbal. But as they are sometimes
used by the natives, I had the curiosity to analyze their chemical
properties shortly after I came to the colony, and they seemed to
me as innocent as lime-blossoms. They are rare in this part of
Australia, but she told me where I should find them,&mdash;a remote
spot, which she has certainly never visited. Last night, when you
saw me disturbed, dejected, it was because, for the first time, the
docility with which she had hitherto, in her waking state, obeyed
her own injunctions in the state of trance, forsook her. She could
not be induced to taste the decoction I had made from the herbs;
and if you found me this morning with weaker hopes than before,
this is the real cause,&mdash;namely, that when I visited her at
sunrise, she was not in sleep but in trance, and in that trance she
told me that she had nothing more to suggest or reveal; that on the
complete restoration of her senses, which was at hand, the abnormal
faculties vouchsafed to trance would be withdrawn. 'As for my
life,' she said quietly, as if unconscious of our temporary joy or
woe in the term of its tenure here,&mdash;'as for my life, your aid
is now idle; my own vision obscure; on my life a dark and cold
shadow is resting. I cannot foresee if it will pass away. When I
strive to look around, I see but my Allen&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"And so," said I, mastering my emotions, "in bidding me hope,
you did not rely on your own resources of science, but on the
whisper of Nature in the brain of your patient?"</p>

<p>"It is so."</p>

<p>We both remained silent some moments, and then, as he
disappeared within my house, I murmured,&mdash;</p>

<p>"And when she strives to look beyond the shadow, she sees only
me! Is there some prophet-hint of Nature there also, directing me
not to scorn the secret which a wanderer, so suddenly dropped on my
solitude, assures me that Nature will sometimes reveal to her
seeker? And oh! that dark wanderer&mdash;has Nature a marvel more
weird than himself?"</p>

<p>(1) "Besides the three great subjects of Newton's
labours&mdash;the fluxional calculus, physical astronomy, and
optics&mdash;a very large portion of his time, while resident in
his college, was devoted to researches of which scarcely a trace
remains. Alchemy, which had fascinated so many eager and ambitious
minds, seems to have tempted Newton with an overwhelming force.
What theories he formed, what experiments he tried, in that
laboratory where, it is said, the fire was scarcely extinguished
for weeks together, will never be known. It is certain that no
success attended his labours; and Newton was not a man&mdash;like
Kepler&mdash;to detail to the world all the hopes and
disappointments, all the crude and mystical fancies, which mixed
themselves up with his career of philosophy... Many years later we
find Newton in correspondence with Locke, with reference to a
mysterious red earth by which Boyle, who was then recently dead,
had asserted that he could effect the grand desideratum of
multiplying gold. By this time, however, Newton's faith had become
somewhat shaken by the unsatisfactory communications which he had
himself received from Boyle on the subject of the golden recipe,
though he did not abandon the idea of giving the experiment a
further trial as soon as the weather should become suitable for
furnace experiments."&mdash;Quarterly Review, No. 220, pp. 125,
126.</p>

<p>(2) Southey, in his "Doctor," vol. vi. p. 2, reports the
conversation of Sir Kenelm Digby with Descartes, in which the great
geometrician said, "That as for rendering man immortal, it was what
he could not venture to promise, but that he was very sure he could
prolong his life to the standard of the patriarchs." And Southey
adds, "that St. Evremond, to whom Digby repeated this, says that
this opinion of Descartes was well known both to his friends in
Holland and in France." By the stress Southey lays on this hearsay
evidence, it is clear that he was not acquainted with the works and
biography of Descartes, or he would have gone to the fountain-head
for authority on Descartes's opinions, namely, Descartes himself.
It is to be wished that Southey had done so, for no one more than
he would have appreciated the exquisitely candid and lovable nature
of the illustrious Frenchman, and the sincerity with which he
cherished in his heart whatever doctrine he conceived in his
understanding. Descartes, whose knowledge of anatomy was
considerable, had that passion for the art of medicine which is
almost inseparable from the pursuit of natural philosophy. At the
age of twenty-four he had sought (in Germany) to obtain initiation
into the brotherhood of the Rosicrucians, but unluckily could not
discover any member of the society to introduce him. "He desired,"
says Cousin, "to assure the health of man, diminish his ills,
extend his existence. He was terrified by the rapid and almost
momentary passage of man upon earth. He believed it was not,
perhaps, impossible to prolong its duration." There is a hidden
recess of grandeur in this idea, and the means proposed by
Descartes for the execution of his project were not less grand. In
his "Discourse on Method," Descartes says, "If it is possible to
find some means to render generally men more wise and more able
than they have been till now, it is, I believe, in medicine that
those means must be sought... I am sure that there is no one, even
in the medical profession, who will not avow that all which one
knows of the medical art is almost nothing in comparison to that
which remains to learn, and that one could be exempted from an
infinity of maladies, both of body and mind, and even, perhaps,
from the decrepitude of old age, if one had sufficient lore of
their causes and of all the remedies which nature provides for
them. Therefore, having design to employ all my life in the
research of a science so necessary, and having discovered a path
which appears to me such that one ought infallibly, in following,
to find it, if one is not hindered prematurely by the brevity of
life or by the defects of experience, I consider that there is no
better remedy against those two hindrances than to communicate
faithfully to the public the little I have found," etc. ("Discours
de la Methode," vol. i. OEuvres de Descartes, Cousin's Edition.)
And again, in his "Correspondence" (vol. ix. p. 341), he says: "The
conservation of health has been always the principal object of my
studies, and I have no doubt that there is a means of acquiring
much knowledge touching medicine which, up to this time, is
ignored." He then refers to his meditated Treatise on Animals as
only an entrance upon that knowledge. But whatever secrets
Descartes may have thought to discover, they are not made known to
the public according to his promise. And in a letter to M. Chanut,
written in 1646 (four years before he died), he says ingenuously:
"I will tell you in confidence that the notion, such as it is,
which I have endeavoured to acquire in physical philosophy, had
greatly assisted me to establish certain foundations for moral
philosophy; and that I am more easily satisfied upon this point
than I am on many others touching medicine, to which I have,
nevertheless, devoted much more time. So that"&mdash;(adds the
grand thinker, with a pathetic nobleness )&mdash;"so that, instead
of finding the means to preserve life, I have found another good,
more easy and more sure, which is&mdash;not to fear death."</p>

the shining or bronzed cuckoo. "Its note is an exceedingly
melancholy whistle, heard at night, when it is very annoying to any
sick or nervous person who may be inclined to sleep. I have known
many instances where the bird has been perched on a tree in the
vicinity of the room of an invalid, uttering its mournful notes,
and it was only with the greatest difficulty that it could be
dislodged from its position."&mdash;Dr. Bennett: Gatherings of a

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVI.</h2>

<p>I strayed through the forest till noon, in debate with myself,
and strove to shape my wild doubts into purpose, before I could
nerve and compose myself again to face Margrave alone.</p>

<p>I re-entered the hut. To my surprise, Margrave was not in the
room in which I had left him, nor in that which adjoined it. I
ascended the stairs to the kind of loft in which I had been
accustomed to pursue my studies, but in which I had not set foot
since my alarm for Lilian had suspended my labours. There I saw
Margrave quietly seated before the manuscript of my Ambitious Work,
which lay open on the rude table, just as I had left it, in the
midst of its concluding summary.</p>

<p>"I have taken the license of former days, you see," said
Margrave, smiling, "and have hit by chance on a passage I can
understand without effort. But why such a waste of argument to
prove a fact so simple? In man, as in brute, life once lost is lost
forever; and that is why life is so precious to man."</p>

<p>I took the book from his hand, and flung it aside in wrath. His
approval revolted me more with my own theories than all the
argumentative rebukes of Faber.</p>

<p>"And now," I said, sternly, "the time has come for the
explanation you promised. Before I can aid you in any experiment
that may serve to prolong your life, I must know how far that life
has been a baleful and destroying influence?"</p>

<p>"I have some faint recollection of having saved your life from
an imminent danger, and if gratitude were the attribute of man, as
it is of the dog, I should claim your aid to serve mine as a right.
Ask me what you will. You must have seen enough of me to know that
I do not affect either the virtues or vices of others. I regard
both with so supreme an indifference, that I believe I am vicious
or virtuous unawares. I know not if I can explain what seems to
have perplexed you, but if I cannot explain I have no intention to
lie. Speak&mdash;I listen! We have time enough now before us."</p>

<p>So saying, he reclined back in the chair, stretching out his
limbs wearily. All round this spoilt darling of Material Nature
were the aids and appliances of Intellectual Science,&mdash;books
and telescopes and crucibles, with the light of day coming through
a small circular aperture in the boarded casement, as I had
constructed the opening for my experimental observation of the
prismal rays.</p>

<p>While I write, his image is as visible before my remembrance as
if before the actual eye,&mdash;beautiful even in its decay, awful
even in its weakness, mysterious as is Nature herself amidst all
the mechanism by which our fancied knowledge attempts to measure
her laws and analyze her light.</p>

<p>But at that moment no such subtle reflections delayed my
inquisitive eager mind from its immediate purpose,&mdash;who and
what was this creature boasting of a secret through which I might
rescue from death the life of her who was my all upon the
earth?</p>

<p>I gathered rapidly and succinctly together all that I knew and
all that I guessed of Margrave's existence and arts. I commenced
from my vision in that mimic Golgotha of creatures inferior to man,
close by the scene of man's most trivial and meaningless pastime. I
went on,&mdash;Derval's murder; the missing contents of the casket;
the apparition seen by the maniac assassin guiding him to the
horrid deed; the luminous haunting shadow; the positive charge in
the murdered man's memoir connecting Margrave with Louis Grayle,
and accusing him of the murder of Haroun; the night in the moonlit
pavilion at Derval Court; the baneful influence on Lilian; the
struggle between me and himself in the house by the
seashore,&mdash;the strange All that is told in this Strange
Story.</p>

<p>But warming as I spoke, and in a kind of fierce joy to be
enabled thus to free my own heart of the doubts that had burdened
it, now that I was fairly face to face with the being by whom my
reason had been so perplexed and my life so tortured. I was
restrained by none of the fears lest my own fancy deceived me, with
which in his absence I had striven to reduce to natural causes the
portents of terror and wonder. I stated plainly, directly, the
beliefs, the impressions which I had never dared even to myself to
own without seeking to explain them away. And coming at last to a
close, I said: "Such are the evidences that seem to me to justify
abhorrence of the life that you ask me to aid in prolonging. Your
own tale of last night but confirms them. And why to me&mdash;to
me&mdash;do you come with wild entreaties to lengthen the life that
has blighted my own? How did you even learn the home in which I
sought unavailing refuge? How&mdash;as your hint to Faber clearly
revealed&mdash;were you aware that, in yon house, where the sorrow
is veiled, where the groan is suppressed, where the foot-tread
falls ghostlike, there struggles now between life and death my
heart's twin, my world's sunshine? Ah! through my terror for her,
is it a demon that tells you how to bribe my abhorrence into
submission, and supple my reason into use to your ends?"</p>

<p>Margrave had listened to me throughout with a fixed attention,
at times with a bewildered stare, at times with exclamations of
surprise, but not of denial. And when I had done, he remained for
some moments silent, seemingly stupefied, passing his hand
repeatedly over his brow, in the gesture so familiar to him in
former days.</p>

<p>At length he said quietly, without evincing any sign either of
resentment or humiliation,&mdash;</p>

<p>"In much that you tell me I recognize myself; in much I am as
lost in amazement as you in wild doubt or fierce wrath. Of the
effect that you say Philip Derval produced on me I have no
recollection. Of himself I have only this,&mdash;that he was my
foe, that he came to England intent on schemes to shorten my life
or destroy its enjoyments. All my faculties tend to
self-preservation; there, they converge as rays in a focus; in that
focus they illume and&mdash;they burn. I willed to destroy my
intended destroyer. Did my will enforce itself on the agent to
which it was guided? Likely enough. Be it so. Would you blame me
for slaying the tiger or serpent&mdash;not by the naked hand, but
by weapons that arm it? But what could tiger and serpent do more
against me than the man who would rob me of life? He had his arts
for assault, I had mine for self-defence. He was to me as the tiger
that creeps through the jungle, or the serpent uncoiling his folds
for the spring. Death to those whose life is destruction to mine,
be they serpent or tiger or man! Derval perished. Yes! the spot in
which the maniac had buried the casket was revealed to me&mdash;no
matter how; the contents of the casket passed into my hands. I
coveted that possession because I believed that Derval had learned
from Haroun of Aleppo the secret by which the elixir of life is
prepared, and I supposed that some stores of the essence would be
found in his casket. I was deceived&mdash;not a drop! What I there
found I knew not how to use or apply, nor did I care to learn. What
I sought was not there. You see a luminous shadow of myself; it
haunts, it accosts, it compels you. Of this I know nothing. Was it
the emanation of my intense will really producing this spectre of
myself, or was it the thing of your own imagination,&mdash;an
imagination which my will impressed and subjugated? I know not. At
the hours when my shadow, real or supposed, was with you, my senses
would have been locked in sleep. It is true, however, that I
intensely desire to learn from races always near to man, but
concealed from his every-day vision, the secret that I believed
Philip Derval had carried with him to the tomb; and from some cause
or another I cannot now of myself alone, as I could years ago,
subject those races to my command,&mdash;I must, in that, act
through or with the mind of another. It is true that I sought to
impress upon your waking thoughts the images of the circle, the
powers of the wand, which, in your trance or sleep-walking, made
you the involuntary agent of my will. I knew by a dream&mdash;for
by dreams, more or less vivid, are the results of my waking will
sometimes divulged to myself&mdash;that the spell had been broken,
the discovery I sought not effected. All my hopes were then
transferred from yourself, the dull votary of science, to the girl
whom I charmed to my thraldom through her love for you and through
her dreams of a realm which the science of schools never enters. In
her, imagination was all pure and all potent; and tell me, O
practical reasoner, if reason has ever advanced one step into
knowledge except through that imaginative faculty which is
strongest in the wisdom of ignorance, and weakest in the ignorance
of the wise. Ponder this, and those marvels that perplex you will
cease to be marvellous. I pass on to the riddle that puzzles you
most. By Philip Derval's account I am, in truth, Louis Grayle
restored to youth by the elixir, and while yet infirm, decrepit,
murdered Haroun,&mdash;a man of a frame as athletic as yours! By
accepting this notion you seem to yourself alone to unravel the
mysteries you ascribe to my life and my powers. O wise philosopher!
O profound logician! you accept that notion, yet hold my belief in
the Dervish's tale a chimera! I am Grayle made young by the elixir,
and yet the elixir itself is a fable!"</p>

<p>He paused and laughed, but the laugh was no longer even an echo
of its former merriment or playfulness,&mdash;a sinister and
terrible laugh, mocking, threatening, malignant.</p>

<p>Again he swept his hand over his brow, and resumed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it not easier to so accomplished a sage as you to believe
that the idlers of Paris have guessed the true solution of that
problem, my place on this earth? May I not be the love-son of Louis
Grayle? And when Haroun refused the elixir to him, or he found that
his frame was too far exhausted for even the elixir to repair
organic lesions of structure in the worn frame of old age, may he
not have indulged the common illusion of fathers, and soothed his
death-pangs with the thought that he should live again in his son?
Haroun is found dead on his carpet&mdash;rumour said strangled.
What proof of the truth of that rumour? Might he not have passed
away in a fit? Will it lessen your perplexity if I state
recollections? They are vague,&mdash;they often perplex myself; but
so far from a wish to deceive you, my desire is to relate them so
truthfully that you may aid me to reduce them into more definite
form."</p>

<p>His face now became very troubled, the tone of his voice very
irresolute,&mdash;the face and the voice of a man who is either
blundering his way through an intricate falsehood, or through
obscure reminiscences.</p>

<p>"This Louis Grayle! this Louis Grayle! I remember him well, as
one remembers a nightmare. Whenever I look back, before the illness
of which I will presently speak, the image of Louis Grayle returns
to me. I see myself with him in African wilds, commanding the
fierce Abyssinians. I see myself with him in the fair Persian
valley,&mdash;lofty, snow-covered mountains encircling the garden
of roses. I see myself with him in the hush of the golden noon,
reclined by the spray of cool fountains,&mdash;now listening to
cymbals and lutes, now arguing with graybeards on secrets
bequeathed by the Chaldees,&mdash;with him, with him in moonlit
nights, stealing into the sepulchres of mythical kings. I see
myself with him in the aisles of dark caverns, surrounded by awful
shapes, which have no likeness amongst the creatures of earth.
Louis Grayle! Louis Grayle! all my earlier memories go back to
Louis Grayle! All my arts and powers, all that I have learned of
the languages spoken in Europe, of the sciences taught in her
schools, I owe to Louis Grayle. But am I one and the same with him?
No&mdash;I am but a pale reflection of his giant intellect. I have
not even a reflection of his childlike agonies of sorrow. Louis
Grayle! He stands apart from me, as a rock from the tree that grows
out from its chasms. Yes, the gossip was right; I must be his
son."</p>

<p>He leaned his face on both hands, rocking himself to and fro. At
length, with a sigh, he resumed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I remember, too, a long and oppressive illness, attended with
racking pains, a dismal journey in a wearisome litter, the light
hand of the woman Ayesha, so sad and so stately, smoothing my
pillow or fanning my brows. I remember the evening on which my
nurse drew the folds of the litter aside, and said, 'See Aleppo!
and the star of thy birth shining over its walls!'</p>

<p>"I remember a face inexpressibly solemn and mournful. I remember
the chill that the calm of its ominous eye sent through my
veins,&mdash;the face of Haroun, the Sage of Aleppo. I remember the
vessel of crystal he bore in his hand, and the blessed relief from
my pains that a drop from the essence which flashed through the
crystal bestowed! And then&mdash;and then&mdash;I remember no more
till the night on which Ayesha came to my couch and said,
'Rise.'</p>

<p>"And I rose, leaning on her, supported by her. We went through
dim narrow streets, faintly lit by wan stars, disturbing the prowl
of the dogs, that slunk from the look of that woman. We came to a
solitary house, small and low, and my nurse said, 'Wait.'</p>

<p>"She opened the door and went in; I seated myself on the
threshold. And after a time she came out from the house, and led
me, still leaning on her, into her chamber.</p>

<p>"A man lay, as in sleep, on the carpet, and beside him stood
another man, whom I recognized as Ayesha's special
attendant,&mdash;an Indian. 'Haroun is dead,' said Ayesha. 'Search
for that which will give thee new life. Thou hast seen, and wilt
know it, not I.'</p>

<p>"And I put my hand on the breast of Haroun&mdash;for the dead
man was he&mdash;and drew from it the vessel of crystal.</p>

<p>"Having done so, the frown of his marble brow appalled me. I
staggered back, and swooned away.</p>

<p>"I came to my senses, recovering and rejoicing, miles afar from
the city, the dawn red on its distant wall. Ayesha had tended me;
the elixir had already restored me.</p>

<p>"My first thought, when full consciousness came back to me,
rested on Louis Grayle, for he also had been at Aleppo; I was but
one of his numerous train. He, too, was enfeebled and suffering; he
had sought the known skill of Haroun for himself as for me; and
this woman loved and had tended him as she had loved and tended me.
And my nurse told me that he was dead, and forbade me henceforth to
breathe his name.</p>

<p>"We travelled on,&mdash;she and I, and the Indian her
servant,&mdash;my strength still renewed by the wondrous elixir. No
longer supported by her, what gazelle ever roved through its
pasture with a bound more elastic than mine?</p>

<p>"We came to a town, and my nurse placed before me a mirror. I
did not recognize myself. In this town we rested, obscure, till the
letter there reached me by which I learned that I was the offspring
of love, and enriched by the care of a father recently dead. Is it
not clear that Louis Grayle was this father?"</p>

<p>"If so, was the woman Ayesha your mother?"</p>

<p>"The letter said that 'my mother had died in my infancy.'
Nevertheless, the care with which Ayesha had tended me induced a
suspicion that made me ask her the very question you put. She wept
when I asked her, and said, 'No, only my nurse. And now I needed a
nurse no more.' The day after I received the letter which announced
an inheritance that allowed me to vie with the nobles of Europe,
this woman left me, and went back to her tribe."</p>

<p>"Have you never seen her since?"</p>

<p>Margrave hesitated a moment, and then answered, though with
seeming reluctance, "Yes, at Damascus. Not many days after I was
borne to that city by the strangers who found me half-dead on their
road, I woke one morning to find her by my side. And she said, 'In
joy and in health you did not need me. I am needed now."'</p>

<p>"Did you then deprive yourself of one so devoted? You have not
made this long voyage&mdash;from Egypt to
Australia&mdash;alone,&mdash;you, to whom wealth gave no excuse for
privation?"</p>

<p>"The woman came with me; and some chosen attendants. I engaged
to ourselves the vessel we sailed in."</p>

<p>"Where have you left your companions?"</p>

<p>"By this hour," answered Margrave, "they are in reach of my
summons; and when you and I have achieved the discovery&mdash;in
the results of which we shall share&mdash;I will exact no more from
your aid. I trust all that rests for my cure to my nurse and her
swarthy attendants. You will aid me now, as a matter of course; the
physician whose counsel you needed to guide your own skill enjoins
you to obey my whim&mdash;if whim you still call it; you will obey
it, for on that whim rests your own sole hope of
happiness,&mdash;you, who can love&mdash;I love nothing but life.
Has my frank narrative solved all the doubts that stood between you
and me, in the great meeting-grounds of an interest in common?"</p>

<p>"Solved all the doubts! Your wild story but makes some the
darker, leaving others untouched: the occult powers of which you
boast, and some of which I have witnessed,&mdash;your very insight
into my own household sorrows, into the interests I have, with
yourself, in the truth of a faith so repugnant to
reason&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me," interrupted Margrave, with that slight curve of the
lip which is half smile and half sneer, "if, in my account of
myself, I omitted what I cannot explain, and you cannot conceive:
let me first ask how many of the commonest actions of the commonest
men are purely involuntary and wholly inexplicable. When, for
instance, you open your lips and utter a sentence, you have not the
faintest idea beforehand what word will follow another. When you
move a muscle can you tell me the thought that prompts to the
movement? And, wholly unable thus to account for your own simple
sympathies between impulse and act, do you believe that there
exists a man upon earth who can read all the riddles in the heart
and brain of another? Is it not true that not one drop of water,
one atom of matter, ever really touches another? Between each and
each there is always a space, however infinitesimally small. How,
then, could the world go on, if every man asked another to make his
whole history and being as lucid as daylight before he would buy
and sell with him? All interchange and alliance rest but on
this,&mdash;an interest in common. You and I have established that
interest: all else, all you ask more, is superfluous. Could I
answer each doubt you would raise, still, whether the answer should
please or revolt you, your reason would come back to the same
starting-point,&mdash;namely, In one definite proposal have we two
an interest in common?"</p>

<p>And again Margrave laughed, not in mirth, but in mockery. The
laugh and the words that preceded it were not the laugh and the
words of the young. Could it be possible that Louis Grayle had
indeed revived to false youth in the person of Margrave, such might
have been his laugh and such his words. The whole mind of Margrave
seemed to have undergone change since I last saw him; more rich in
idea, more crafty even in candour, more powerful, more concentred.
As we see in our ordinary experience, that some infirmity,
threatening dissolution, brings forth more vividly the
reminiscences of early years, when impressions were vigorously
stamped, so I might have thought that as Margrave neared the tomb,
the memories he had retained from his former existence, in a being
more amply endowed, more formidably potent, struggled back to the
brain; and the mind that had lived in Louis Grayle moved the lips
of the dying Margrave.</p>

<p>"For the powers and the arts that it equally puzzles your reason
to assign or deny to me," resumed my terrible guest, "I will say
briefly but this: they come from faculties stored within myself,
and doubtless conduce to my self-preservation,&mdash;faculties more
or less, perhaps (so Van Helmont asserts), given to all men, though
dormant in most; vivid and active in me because in me
self-preservation has been and yet is the strong master-passion, or
instinct; and because I have been taught how to use and direct such
faculties by disciplined teachers,&mdash;some by Louis Grayle, the
enchanter; some by my nurse, the singer of charmed songs. But in
much that I will to have done, I know no more than yourself how the
agency acts. Enough for me to will what I wish, and sink calmly
into slumber, sure that the will would work somehow its way. But
when I have willed to know what, when known, should shape my own
courses, I could see, without aid from your pitiful telescopes, all
objects howsoever far. What wonder in that? Have you no learned
puzzle-brained metaphysicians who tell you that space is but an
idea, all this palpable universe an idea in the mind, and no more?
Why am I an enigma as dark as the Sibyls, and your metaphysicians
as plain as a hornbook?" Again the sardonic laugh. "Enough: let
what I have said obscure or enlighten your guesses, we come back to
the same link of union, which binds man to man, bids States arise
from the desert, and foeman embrace as brothers. I need you and you
need me; without your aid my life is doomed; without my secret the
breath will have gone from the lips of your Lilian before the sun
of to-morrow is red on the hill-tops."</p>

<p>"Fiend or juggler," I cried in rage, "you shall not so enslave
and enthrall me by this mystic farrago and jargon. Make your
fantastic experiment on yourself if you will: trust to your arts
and your powers. My Lilian's life shall not hang on your fiat. I
trust it&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To what&mdash;to man's skill? Hear what the sage of the college
shall tell you, before I ask you again for your aid. Do you trust
to God's saving mercy? Ah, of course you believe in a God? Who,
except a philosopher, can reason a Maker away? But that the Maker
will alter His courses to hear you; that, whether or not you trust
in Him, or in your doctor, it will change by a hairbreadth the
thing that must be&mdash;do you believe this, Allen Fenwick?"</p>

<p>And there sat this reader of hearts! a boy in his aspect,
mocking me and the graybeards of schools.</p>

<p>I could listen no more; I turned to the door and fled down the
stairs, and heard, as I fled, a low chant: feeble and faint, it was
still the old barbaric chant, by which the serpent is drawn from
its hole by the charmer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVII.</h2>

<p>To those of my readers who may seek with Julius Faber to
explore, through intelligible causes, solutions of the marvels I
narrate, Margrave's confession may serve to explain away much that
my own superstitious beliefs had obscured. To them Margrave is
evidently the son of Louis Grayle. The elixir of life is reduced to
some simple restorative, owing much of its effect to the faith of a
credulous patient: youth is so soon restored to its joy in the sun,
with or without an elixir. To them Margrave's arts of enchantment
are reduced to those idiosyncrasies of temperament on which the
disciples of Mesmer build up their theories,&mdash;exaggerated, in
much, by my own superstitions; aided, in part, by such natural,
purely physical magic as, explored by the ancient priest-crafts, is
despised by the modern philosophies, and only remains occult
because Science delights no more in the slides of the lantern which
fascinated her childhood with simulated phantoms. To them Margrave
is, perhaps, an enthusiast, but, because an enthusiast, not less an
impostor. "L'Homme se pique," says Charron. Man cogs the dice for
himself ere he rattles the box for his dupes. Was there ever
successful impostor who did not commence by a fraud on his own
understanding? Cradled in Orient Fableland, what though Margrave
believes in its legends; in a wand, an elixir; in sorcerers or
Afrites? That belief in itself makes him keen to detect, and
skilful to profit by, the latent but kindred credulities of others.
In all illustrations of Duper and Duped through the records of
superstition&mdash;from the guile of a Cromwell, a Mahomet, down to
the cheats of a gypsy&mdash;professional visionaries are amongst
the astutest observers. The knowledge that Margrave had gained of
my abode, of my affliction, or of the innermost thoughts in my
mind, it surely demanded no preternatural aids to acquire. An Old
Bailey attorney could have got at the one, and any quick student of
human hearts have readily mastered the other. In fine, Margrave,
thus rationally criticised, is no other prodigy (save in degree and
concurrence of attributes simple, though not very common) than may
be found in each alley that harbours a fortune-teller who has just
faith enough in the stars or the cards to bubble himself while he
swindles his victims; earnest, indeed, in the self-conviction that
he is really a seer, but reading the looks of his listeners,
divining the thoughts that induce them to listen, and acquiring by
practice a startling ability to judge what the listeners will deem
it most seer-like to read in the cards or divine from the
stars.</p>

<p>I leave this interpretation unassailed. It is that which is the
most probable; it is clearly that which, in a case not my own, I
should have accepted; and yet I revolved and dismissed it. The
moment we deal with things beyond our comprehension, and in which
our own senses are appealed to and baffled, we revolt from the
Probable, as it seems to the senses of those who have not
experienced what we have. And the same principle of Wonder that led
our philosophy up from inert ignorance into restless knowledge, now
winding back into shadow land, reverses its rule by the way, and,
at last, leaves us lost in the maze, our knowledge inert, and our
ignorance restless.</p>

<p>And putting aside all other reasons for hesitating to believe
that Margrave was the son of Louis Grayle,&mdash;reasons which his
own narrative might suggest,&mdash;was it not strange that Sir
Philip Derval, who had instituted inquiries so minute, and reported
them in his memoir with so faithful a care, should not have
discovered that a youth, attended by the same woman who had
attended Grayle, had disappeared from the town on the same night as
Grayle himself disappeared? But Derval had related truthfully,
according to Margrave's account, the flight of Ayesha and her
Indian servant, yet not alluded to the flight, not even to the
existence of the boy, who must have been of no mean importance in
the suite of Louis Grayle, if he were, indeed, the son whom Grayle
had made his constant companion, and constituted his principal
heir. Not many minutes did I give myself up to the cloud of
reflections through which no sunbeam of light forced its way. One
thought overmastered all; Margrave had threatened death to my
Lilian, and warned me of what I should learn from the lips of
Faber, "the sage of the college." I stood, shuddering, at the door
of my home; I did not dare to enter.</p>

<p>"Allen," said a voice, in which my ear detected the unwonted
tremulous faltering, "be firm,&mdash;be calm. I keep my promise.
The hour is come in which you may again see the Lilian of old, mind
to mind, soul to soul."</p>

<p>Faber's hand took mine, and led me into the house.</p>

<p>"You do, then, fear that this interview will be too much for her
strength?" said I, whisperingly.</p>

<p>"I cannot say; but she demands the interview, and I dare not
refuse it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXVIII.</h2>

<p>I left Faber on the stairs, and paused at the door of Lilian's
room. The door opened suddenly, noiselessly, and her mother came
out with one hand before her face, and the other locked in Amy's,
who was leading her as a child leads the blind. Mrs. Ashleigh
looked up, as I touched her, with a vacant, dreary stare. She was
not weeping, as was her womanly wont in every pettier grief, but
Amy was. No word was exchanged between us. I entered, and closed
the door; my eyes turned mechanically to the corner in which was
placed the small virgin bed, with its curtains white as a shroud.
Lilian was not there. I looked around, and saw her half reclined on
a couch near the window. She was dressed, and with care. Was not
that her bridal robe?</p>

<p>"Allen! Allen!" she murmured. "Again, again my
Allen&mdash;again, again your Lilian!" And, striving in vain to
rise, she stretched out her arms in the yearning of reunited love.
And as I knelt beside her, those arms closed round me for the first
time in the frank, chaste, holy tenderness of a wife's embrace.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, in her low voice (her voice, like Cordelia's,
was ever low), "all has come back to me,&mdash;all that I owe to
your protecting, noble, trustful, guardian love!"</p>

<p>"Hush! hush! the gratitude rests with me; it is so sweet to
love, to trust, to guard! my own, my beautiful&mdash;still my
beautiful! Suffering has not dimmed the light of those dear eyes to
me! Put your lips to my ear. Whisper but these words: 'I love you,
and for your sake I wish to live.'"</p>

<p>"For your sake, I pray&mdash;with my whole weak human
heart&mdash;I pray to live! Listen. Some day hereafter, if I am
spared, under the purple blossoms of yonder waving trees I shall
tell you all, as I see it now; all that darkened or shone on me in
my long dream, and before the dream closed around me, like a night
in which cloud and star chase each other! Some day hereafter, some
quiet, sunlit, happy, happy day! But now, all I would say is this:
Before that dreadful morning&mdash;" Here she paused, shuddered,
and passionately burst forth, "Allen, Allen! you did not believe
that slanderous letter! God bless you! God bless you!
Great-hearted, high-souled&mdash;God bless you, my darling! my
husband! And He will! Pray to Him humbly as I do, and He will bless
you." She stooped and kissed away my tears; then she resumed,
feebly, meekly, sorrowfully,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Before that morning I was not worthy of such a heart, such a
love as yours. No, no; hear me. Not that a thought of love for
another ever crossed me! Never, while conscious and reasoning, was
I untrue to you, even in fancy. But I was a child,&mdash;wayward as
the child who pines for what earth cannot give, and covets the moon
for a toy. Heaven had been so kind to my lot on earth, and yet with
my lot on earth I was secretly discontented. When I felt that you
loved me, and my heart told me that I loved again, I said to
myself, 'Now the void that my soul finds on earth will be filled.'
I longed for your coming, and yet when you went I murmured, 'But is
this the ideal of which I have dreamed?' I asked for an impossible
sympathy. Sympathy with what? Nay, smile on me,
dearest!&mdash;sympathy with what? I could not have said. Ah,
Allen, then, then, I was not worthy of you! Infant that I was, I
asked you to understand me: now I know that I am a woman, and my
task is to study you. Do I make myself clear? Do you forgive me? I
was not untrue to you; I was untrue to my own duties in life. I
believed, in my vain conceit, that a mortal's dim vision of heaven
raised me above the earth; I did not perceive the truth that earth
is a part of the same universe as heaven! Now, perhaps, in the
awful affliction that darkened my reason, my soul has been made
more clear. As if to chastise but to teach me, my soul has been
permitted to indulge its own presumptuous desire; it has wandered
forth from the trammels of mortal duties and destinies; it comes
back, alarmed by the dangers of its own rash and presumptuous
escape from the tasks which it should desire upon earth to perform.
Allen, Allen, I am less unworthy of you now! Perhaps in my darkness
one rapid glimpse of the true world of spirit has been vouchsafed
to me. If so, how unlike to the visions my childhood indulged as
divine! Now, while I know still more deeply that there is a world
for the angels, I know, also, that the mortal must pass through
probation in the world of mortals. Oh, may I pass through it with
you, grieving in your griefs, rejoicing in your joy!"</p>

<p>Here language failed her. Again the dear arms embraced me, and
the dear face, eloquent with love, hid itself on my human
breast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXIX.</h2>

<p>That interview is over! Again I am banished from Lilian's room;
the agitation, the joy of that meeting has overstrained her
enfeebled nerves. Convulsive tremblings of the whole frame,
accompanied with vehement sobs, succeeded our brief interchange of
sweet and bitter thoughts. Faber, in tearing me from her side,
imperiously and sternly warned me that the sole chance yet left of
preserving her life was in the merciful suspense of the emotions
that my presence excited. He and Amy resumed their place in her
chamber. Even her mother shared my sentence of banishment. So Mrs.
Ashleigh and I sat facing each other in the room below; over me a
leaden stupor had fallen, and I heard, as a voice from afar or in a
dream, the mother's murmured wailings,</p>

<p>"She will die! she will die! Her eyes have the same heavenly
look as my Gilbert's on the day on which his closed forever. Her
very words are his last words,&mdash;'Forgive me all my faults to
you.' She will die! she will die!"</p>

<p>Hours thus passed away. At length Faber entered the room; he
spoke first to Mrs. Ashleigh,&mdash;meaningless soothings, familiar
to the lips of all who pass from the chamber of the dying to the
presence of mourners, and know that it is a falsehood to say
"hope," and a mockery as yet, to say, "endure."</p>

<p>But he led her away to her own room, docile as a wearied child
led to sleep, stayed with her some time, and then returned to me,
pressing me to his breast father-like.</p>

<p>"No hope! no hope!" said I, recoiling from his embrace. "You are
silent. Speak! speak! Let me know the worst."</p>

<p>"I have a hope, yet I scarcely dare to bid you share it; for it
grows rather out of my heart as man than my experience as
physician. I cannot think that her soul would be now so reconciled
to earth, so fondly, so earnestly, cling to this mortal life, if it
were about to be summoned away. You know how commonly even the
sufferers who have dreaded death the most become calmly resigned to
its coming, when death visibly reveals itself out from the shadows
in which its shape has been guessed and not seen. As it is a bad
sign for life when the patient has lost all will to live on, so
there is hope while the patient, yet young and with no perceptible
breach in the great centres of life (however violently their forts
may be stormed), has still intense faith in recovery, perhaps drawn
(who can say?) from the whispers conveyed from above to the
soul.</p>

<p>"I cannot bring myself to think that all the uses for which a
reason, always so lovely even in its errors, has been restored, are
yet fulfilled. It seems to me as if your union, as yet so
imperfect, has still for its end that holy life on earth by which
two mortal beings strengthen each other for a sphere of existence
to which this is the spiritual ladder. Through yourself I have hope
yet for her. Gifted with powers that rank you high in the manifold
orders of man,&mdash;thoughtful, laborious, and brave; with a heart
that makes intellect vibrate to every fine touch of humanity; in
error itself, conscientious; in delusion, still eager for truth; in
anger, forgiving; in wrong, seeking how to repair; and, best of
all, strong in a love which the mean would have shrunk to defend
from the fangs of the slanderer,&mdash;a love, raising passion
itself out of the realm of the senses, made sublime by the sorrows
that tried its devotion,&mdash;with all these noble proofs in
yourself of a being not meant to end here, your life has stopped
short in its uses, your mind itself has been drifted, a bark
without rudder or pilot, over seas without shore, under skies
without stars. And wherefore? Because the mind you so haughtily
vaunted has refused its companion and teacher in Soul.</p>

<p>"And therefore, through you, I hope that she will be spared yet
to live on; she, in whom soul has been led dimly astray, by
unheeding the checks and the definite goals which the mind is
ordained to prescribe to its wanderings while here; the mind taking
thoughts from the actual and visible world, and the soul but vague
glimpses and hints from the instinct of its ultimate heritage. Each
of you two seems to me as yet incomplete, and your destinies yet
uncompleted. Through the bonds of the heart, through the trials of
time, ye have both to consummate your marriage. I do
not&mdash;believe me&mdash;I do not say this in the fanciful wisdom
of allegory and type, save that, wherever deeply examined, allegory
and type run through all the most commonplace phases of outward and
material life. I hope, then, that she may yet be spared to you;
hope it, not from my skill as physician, but my inward belief as a
Christian. To perfect your own being and end, 'Ye will need one
another!'"</p>

<p>I started&mdash;the very words that Lilian had heard in her
vision!</p>

<p>"But," resumed Faber, "how can I presume to trace the numberless
links of effect up to the First Cause, far off&mdash;oh; far
off&mdash;out of the scope of my reason. I leave that to
philosophers, who would laugh my meek hope to scorn. Possibly,
probably, where I, whose calling has been but to save flesh from
the worm, deem that the life of your Lilian is needed yet, to
develop and train your own convictions of soul, Heaven in its
wisdom may see that her death would instruct you far more than her
life. I have said, Be prepared for either,&mdash;wisdom through
joy, or wisdom through grief. Enough that, looking only through the
mechanism by which this moral world is impelled and improved, you
know that cruelty is impossible to wisdom. Even a man, or man's
law, is never wise but when merciful. But mercy has general
conditions; and that which is mercy to the myriads may seem hard to
the one, and that which seems hard to the one in the pang of a
moment may be mercy when viewed by the eye that looks on through
eternity."</p>

<p>And from all this discourse&mdash;of which I now, at calm
distance of time, recall every word&mdash;my human, loving heart
bore away for the moment but this sentence, "Ye will need one
another;" so that I cried out, "Life, life, life! Is there no hope
for her life? Have you no hope as physician? I am a physician, too;
I will see her. I will judge. I will not be banished from my
post."</p>

<p>"Judge, then, as physician, and let the responsibility rest with
you. At this moment, all convulsion, all struggle, has ceased; the
frame is at rest. Look on her, and perhaps only the physician's eye
could distinguish her state from death. It is not sleep, it is not
trance, it is not the dooming coma from which there is no awaking.
Shall I call it by the name received in our schools? Is it the
catalepsy in which life is suspended, but consciousness acute? She
is motionless, rigid; it is but with a strain of my own sense that
I know that the breath still breathes, and the heart still beats.
But I am convinced that though she can neither speak, nor stir, nor
give sign, she is fully, sensitively conscious of all that passes
around her. She is like those who have seen the very coffin carried
into their chamber, and been unable to cry out, 'Do not bury me
alive!' Judge then for yourself, with this intense consciousness
and this impotence to evince it, what might be the effect of your
presence,&mdash;first an agony of despair, and then the complete
extinction of life!"</p>

<p>"I have known but one such case,&mdash;a mother whose heart was
wrapped up in a suffering infant. She had lain for two days and two
nights, still, as if in her shroud. All save myself said, 'Life is
gone.' I said, 'Life still is there.' They brought in the infant,
to try what effect its presence would produce; then her lips moved,
and the hands crossed upon her bosom trembled."</p>

<p>"And the result?" exclaimed Faber, eagerly. "If the result of
your experience sanction your presence, come; the sight of the babe
rekindled life?"</p>

<p>"No; extinguished its last spark! I will not enter Lilian's
room. I will go away,&mdash;away from the house itself. That acute
consciousness! I know it well! She may even hear me move in the
room below, hear me speak at this moment. Go back to her, go back!
But if hers be the state which I have known in another, which may
be yet more familiar to persons of far ampler experience than mine,
there is no immediate danger of death. The state will last through
to-day, through to-night, perhaps for days to come. Is it so?"</p>

<p>"I believe that for at least twelve hours there will be no
change in her state. I believe also that if she recover from it,
calm and refreshed, as from a sleep, the danger of death will have
passed away."</p>

<p>"And for twelve hours my presence would be hurtful?"</p>

<p>"Rather say fatal, if my diagnosis be right."</p>

<p>I wrung my friend's hand, and we parted.</p>

<p>Oh, to lose her now!&mdash;now that her love and her reason had
both returned, each more vivid than before! Futile, indeed, might
be Margrave's boasted secret; but at least in that secret was hope.
In recognized science I saw only despair.</p>

<p>And at that thought all dread of this mysterious visitor
vanished,&mdash;all anxiety to question more of his attributes or
his history. His life itself became to me dear and precious. What
if it should fail me in the steps of the process, whatever that
was, by which the life of my Lilian might be saved!</p>

<p>The shades of evening were now closing in. I remembered that I
had left Margrave without even food for many hours. I stole round
to the back of the house, filled a basket with elements more
generous than those of the former day; extracted fresh drugs from
my stores, and, thus laden, hurried back to the hut. I found
Margrave in the room below, seated on his mysterious coffer,
leaning his face on his hand. When I entered, he looked up, and
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have neglected me. My strength is waning. Give me more of
the cordial, for we have work before us to-night, and I need
support."</p>

<p>He took for granted my assent to his wild experiment; and he was
right.</p>

<p>I administered the cordial. I placed food before him, and this
time he did not eat with repugnance. I poured out wine, and he
drank it sparingly, but with ready compliance, saying, "In perfect
health, I looked upon wine as poison; now it is like a foretaste of
the glorious elixir."</p>

<p>After he had thus recruited himself, he seemed to acquire an
energy that startlingly contrasted his languor the day before; the
effort of breathing was scarcely perceptible; the colour came back
to his cheeks; his bended frame rose elastic and erect.</p>

<p>"If I understood you rightly," said I, "the experiment you ask
me to aid can be accomplished in a single night?"</p>

<p>"In a single night,&mdash;this night."</p>

<p>"Command me. Why not begin at once? What apparatus or chemical
agencies do you need?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Margrave, "formerly, how I was misled! Formerly, how
my conjectures blundered! I thought, when I asked you to give a
month to the experiment I wish to make, that I should need the
subtlest skill of the chemist. I then believed, with Van Helmont,
that the principle of life is a gas, and that the secret was but in
the mode by which the gas might be rightly administered. But now
all that I need is contained in this coffer, save one very simple
material,&mdash;fuel sufficient for a steady fire for six hours. I
see even that is at hand, piled up in your outhouse. And now for
the substance itself,&mdash;to that you must guide me."</p>

<p>"Explain."</p>

<p>"Near this very spot is there not gold&mdash;in mines yet
undiscovered?&mdash;and gold of the purest metal?"</p>

<p>"There is. What then? Do you, with the alchemists, blend in one
discovery gold and life?"</p>

<p>"No. But it is only where the chemistry of earth or of man
produces gold, that the substance from which the great pabulum of
life is extracted by ferment can be found. Possibly, in the
attempts at that transmutation of metals, which I think your own
great chemist, Sir Humphry Davy, allowed might be possible, but
held not to be worth the cost of the process,&mdash;possibly, in
those attempts, some scanty grains of this substance were found by
the alchemists, in the crucible, with grains of the metal as
niggardly yielded by pitiful mimicry of Nature's stupendous
laboratory; and from such grains enough of the essence might,
perhaps, have been drawn forth, to add a few years of existence to
some feeble graybeard,&mdash;granting, what rests on no proofs,
that some of the alchemists reached an age rarely given to man. But
it is not in the miserly crucible, it is in the matrix of Nature
herself, that we must seek in prolific abundance Nature's grand
principle,&mdash;life. As the loadstone is rife with the magnetic
virtue, as amber contains the electric, so in this substance, to
which we yet want a name, is found the bright life-giving fluid. In
the old goldmines of Asia and Europe the substance exists, but can
rarely be met with. The soil for its nutriment may there be
well-nigh exhausted. It is here, where Nature herself is all vital
with youth, that the nutriment of youth must be sought. Near this
spot is gold; guide me to it."</p>

<p>"You cannot come with me. The place which I know as auriferous
is some miles distant, the way rugged. You can not walk to it. It
is true I have horses, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think I have come this distance and not foreseen and
forestalled all that I want for my object? Trouble your self not
with conjectures how I can arrive at the place. I have provided the
means to arrive at and leave it. My litter and its bearers are in
reach of my call. Give me your arm to the rising ground, fifty
yards from your door."</p>

<p>I obeyed mechanically, stifling all surprise. I had made my
resolve, and admitted no thought that could shake it. When we
reached the summit of the grassy hillock, which sloped from the
road that led to the seaport, Margrave, after pausing to recover
breath, lifted up his voice, in a key, not loud, but shrill and
slow and prolonged, half cry and half chant, like the nighthawk's.
Through the air&mdash;so limpid and still, bringing near far
objects, far sounds&mdash;the voice pierced its way, artfully
pausing, till wave after wave of the atmosphere bore and
transmitted it on.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the call seemed re-echoed, so exactly, so
cheerily, that for the moment I thought that the note was the
mimicry of the shy mocking Lyre-Bird, which mimics so merrily all
that it hears in its coverts, from the whir of the locust to the
howl of the wild dog.</p>

<p>"What king," said the mystical charmer, and as he spoke he
carelessly rested his hand on my shoulder, so that I trembled to
feel that this dread son of Nature, Godless and soulless, who had
been&mdash;and, my heart whispered, who still could be&mdash;my
bane and mind-darkener, leaned upon me for support, as the spoilt
younger-born on his brother,&mdash;"what king," said this cynical
mocker, with his beautiful boyish face,&mdash;"what king in your
civilized Europe has the sway of a chief of the East? What link is
so strong between mortal and mortal, as that between lord and
slave? I transport yon poor fools from the land of their birth;
they preserve here their old habits,&mdash;obedience and awe. They
would wait till they starved in the solitude,&mdash;wait to hearken
and answer my call. And I, who thus rule them, or charm
them&mdash;I use and despise them. They know that, and yet serve
me! Between you and me, my philosopher, there is but one thing
worth living for,&mdash;life for oneself."</p>

<p>Is it age, is it youth, that thus shocks all my sense, in my
solemn completeness of man? Perhaps, in great capitals, young men
of pleasure will answer, "It is youth; and we think what he says!"
Young friends, I do not believe you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXX.</h2>

<p>Along the grass-track I saw now, under the moon, just risen, a
strange procession, never seen before in Australian pastures. It
moved on, noiselessly but quickly. We descended the hillock, and
met it on the way,&mdash;a sable litter, borne by four men, in
unfamiliar Eastern garments; two other servitors, more bravely
dressed, with yataghans and silver-hilted pistols in their belts,
preceded this sombre equipage. Perhaps Margrave divined the
disdainful thought that passed through my mind, vaguely and
half-unconsciously; for he said, with a hollow, bitter laugh that
had replaced the lively peal of his once melodious
mirth,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A little leisure and a little gold, and your raw colonist, too,
will have the tastes of a pacha."</p>

<p>I made no answer. I had ceased to care who and what was my
tempter. To me his whole being was resolved into one problem: Had
he a secret by which death could be turned from Lilian?</p>

<p>But now, as the litter halted, from the long dark shadow which
it cast upon the turf the figure of a woman emerged and stood
before us. The outlines of her shape were lost in the loose folds
of a black mantle, and the features of her face were hidden by a
black veil, except only the dark, bright, solemn eyes. Her stature
was lofty, her bearing majestic, whether in movement or repose.</p>

<p>Margrave accosted her in some language unknown to me. She
replied in what seemed to me the same tongue. The tones of her
voice were sweet, but inexpressibly mournful. The words that they
uttered appeared intended to warn, or deprecate, or dissuade; but
they called to Margrave's brow a lowering frown, and drew from his
lips a burst of unmistakable anger. The woman rejoined, in the same
melancholy music of voice. And Margrave then, leaning his arm upon
her shoulder, as he had leaned it on mine, drew her away from the
group into a neighbouring copse of the flowering
eucalypti,&mdash;mystic trees, never changing the hues of their
pale-green leaves, ever shifting the tints of their ash-gray,
shedding bark. For some moments I gazed on the two human forms,
dimly seen by the glinting moonlight through the gaps in the
foliage. Then turning away my eyes, I saw, standing close at my
side, a man whom I had not noticed before. His footstep, as it
stole to me, had fallen on the sward without sound. His dress,
though Oriental, differed from that of his companions, both in
shape and colour; fitting close to the breast, leaving the arms
bare to the elbow, and of a uniform ghastly white, as are the
cerements of the grave. His visage was even darker than those of
the Syrians or Arabs behind him, and his features were those of a
bird of prey,&mdash;the beak of the eagle, but the eye of the
vulture. His cheeks were hollow; the arms, crossed on his breast,
were long and fleshless. Yet in that skeleton form there was a
something which conveyed the idea of a serpent's suppleness and
strength; and as the hungry, watchful eyes met my own startled
gaze, I recoiled impulsively with that inward warning of danger
which is conveyed to man, as to inferior animals, in the very
aspect of the creatures that sting or devour. At my movement the
man inclined his head in the submissive Eastern salutation, and
spoke in his foreign tongue, softly, humbly, fawningly, to judge by
his tone and his gesture.</p>

<p>I moved yet farther away from him with loathing, and now the
human thought flashed upon me: was I, in truth, exposed to no
danger in trusting myself to the mercy of the weird and remorseless
master of those hirelings from the East,&mdash;seven men in number,
two at least of them formidably armed, and docile as bloodhounds to
the hunter, who has only to show them their prey? But fear of man
like myself is not my weakness; where fear found its way to my
heart, it was through the doubts or the fancies in which man like
myself disappeared in the attributes, dark and unknown, which we
give to a fiend or a spectre. And, perhaps, if I could have paused
to analyze my own sensations, the very presence of this
escort-creatures of flesh and blood-lessened the dread of my
incomprehensible tempter. Rather, a hundred times, front and defy
those seven Eastern slaves&mdash;I, haughty son of the Anglo-Saxon
who conquers all races because he fears no odds&mdash;than have
seen again on the walls of my threshold the luminous, bodiless
Shadow! Besides: Lilian! Lilian! for one chance of saving her life,
however wild and chimerical that chance might be, I would have
shrunk not a foot from the march of an army.</p>

<p>Thus reassured and thus resolved, I advanced, with a smile of
disdain, to meet Margrave and his veiled companion, as they now
came from the moonlit copse.</p>

<p>"Well," I said to him, with an irony that unconsciously mimicked
his own, "have you taken advice with your nurse? I assume that the
dark form by your side is that of Ayesha."</p>

<p>The woman looked at me from her sable veil, with her steadfast
solemn eyes, and said, in English, though with a foreign accent:
"The nurse born in Asia is but wise through her love; the pale son
of Europe is wise through his art. The nurse says, 'Forbear!' Do
you say, 'Adventure'?"</p>

<p>"Peace!" exclaimed Margrave, stamping his foot on the ground. "I
take no counsel from either; it is for me to resolve, for you to
obey, and for him to aid. Night is come, and we waste it; move
on."</p>

<p>The woman made no reply, nor did I. He took my arm and walked
back to the hut. The barbaric escort followed. When we reached the
door of the building, Margrave said a few words to the woman and to
the litter-bearers. They entered the hut with us. Margrave pointed
out to the woman his coffer, to the men the fuel stowed in the
outhouse. Both were borne away and placed within the litter.
Meanwhile, I took from the table, on which it was carelessly
thrown, the light hatchet that I habitually carried with me in my
rambles.</p>

<p>"Do you think that you need that idle weapon?" said Margrave.
"Do you fear the good faith of my swarthy attendants?"</p>

<p>"Nay, take the hatchet yourself; its use is to sever the gold
from the quartz in which we may find it embedded, or to clear, as
this shovel, which will also be needed, from the slight soil above
it, the ore that the mine in the mountain flings forth, as the sea
casts its waifs on the sands."</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, fellow-labourer!" said Margrave, joyfully.
"Ah, there is no faltering terror in this pulse! I was not mistaken
in the Man. What rests, but the Place and the Hour? I shall live! I
shall live!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXI.</h2>

<p>Margrave now entered the litter, and the Veiled Woman drew the
black curtains round him. I walked on, as the guide, some yards in
advance. The air was still, heavy, and parched with the breath of
the Australasian sirocco.</p>

<p>We passed through the meadow-lands, studded with slumbering
flocks; we followed the branch of the creek, which was linked to
its source in the mountains by many a trickling waterfall; we
threaded the gloom of stunted, misshapen trees, gnarled with the
stringy bark which makes one of the signs of the strata that
nourish gold; and at length the moon, now in all her pomp of light,
mid-heaven amongst her subject stars, gleamed through the fissures
of the cave, on whose floor lay the relics of antediluvian races,
and rested in one flood of silvery splendour upon the hollows of
the extinct volcano, with tufts of dank herbage, and wide spaces of
paler sward, covering the gold below,&mdash;Gold, the dumb symbol
of organized Matter's great mystery, storing in itself, according
as Mind, the informer of Matter, can distinguish its uses, evil and
good, bane and blessing.</p>

<p>Hitherto the Veiled Woman had remained in the rear, with the
white-robed, skeleton-like image that had crept to my side unawares
with its noiseless step. Thus in each winding turn of the difficult
path at which the convoy following behind me came into sight, I had
seen, first, the two gayly-dressed, armed men, next the black
bier-like litter, and last the Black-veiled Woman and the
White-robed Skeleton.</p>

<p>But now, as I halted on the tableland, backed by the mountain
and fronting the valley, the woman left her companion, passed by
the litter and the armed men, and paused by my side, at the mouth
of the moonlit cavern.</p>

<p>There for a moment she stood, silent, the procession below
mounting upward laboriously and slow; then she turned to me, and
her veil was withdrawn.</p>

<p>The face on which I gazed was wondrously beautiful, and severely
awful. There was neither youth nor age, but beauty, mature and
majestic as that of a marble Demeter.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in that which you seek?" she asked, in her
foreign, melodious, melancholy accents.</p>

<p>"I have no belief," was my answer. "True science has none. True
science questions all things, takes nothing upon credit. It knows
but three states of the mind,&mdash;Denial, Conviction, and that
vast interval between the two, which is not belief, but suspense of
judgment."</p>

<p>The woman let fall her veil, moved from me, and seated herself
on a crag above that cleft between mountain and creek, to which,
when I had first discovered the gold that the land nourished, the
rain from the clouds had given the rushing life of the cataract;
but which now, in the drought and the hush of the skies, was but a
dead pile of stones.</p>

<p>The litter now ascended the height: its bearers halted; a lean
hand tore the curtains aside, and Margrave descended, leaning, this
time, not on the Black-veiled Woman, but on the White-robed
Skeleton.</p>

<p>There, as he stood, the moon shone full on his wasted form; on
his face, resolute, cheerful, and proud, despite its hollowed
outlines and sicklied hues. He raised his head, spoke in the
language unknown to me, and the armed men and the litter-bearers
grouped round him, bending low, their eyes fixed on the ground. The
Veiled Woman rose slowly and came to his side, motioning away, with
a mute sign, the ghastly form on which he leaned, and passing round
him silently, instead, her own sustaining arm. Margrave spoke again
a few sentences, of which I could not even guess the meaning. When
he had concluded, the armed men and the litter-bearers came nearer
to his feet, knelt down, and kissed his hand. They then rose, and
took from the bier-like vehicle the coffer and the fuel. This done,
they lifted again the litter, and again, preceded by the armed men,
the procession descended down the sloping hillside, down into the
valley below.</p>

<p>Margrave now whispered, for some moments, into the ear of the
hideous creature who had made way for the Veiled Woman. The grim
skeleton bowed his head submissively, and strode noiselessly away
through the long grasses,&mdash;the slender stems, trampled under
his stealthy feet, relifting themselves, as after a passing wind.
And thus he, too, sank out of sight down into the valley below. On
the tableland of the hill remained only we three,&mdash;Margrave,
myself, and the Veiled Woman.</p>

<p>She had reseated herself apart, on the gray crag above the dried
torrent. He stood at the entrance of the cavern, round the sides of
which clustered parasital plants, with flowers of all colours, some
amongst them opening their petals and exhaling their fragrance only
in the hours of night; so that, as his form filled up the jaws of
the dull arch, obscuring the moonbeam that strove to pierce the
shadows that slept within, it stood now&mdash;wan and
blighted&mdash;as I had seen it first, radiant and joyous,
literally "framed in blooms."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXII.</h2>

<p>"So," said Margrave, turning to me, "under the soil that spreads
around us lies the gold which to you and to me is at this moment of
no value, except as a guide to its twin-born,&mdash;the regenerator
of life!"</p>

<p>"You have not yet described to me the nature of the substance
which we are to explore, nor of the process by which the virtues
you impute to it are to be extracted."</p>

<p>"Let us first find the gold, and instead of describing the
life-amber, so let me call it, I will point it out to your own
eyes. As to the process, your share in it is so simple, that you
will ask me why I seek aid from a chemist. The life-amber, when
found, has but to be subjected to heat and fermentation for six
hours; it will be placed, in a small caldron which that coffer
contains, over the fire which that fuel will feed. To give effect
to the process, certain alkalies and other ingredients are
required; but these are prepared, and mine is the task to commingle
them. From your science as chemist I need and ask nought. In you I
have sought only the aid of a man."</p>

<p>"If that be so, why, indeed, seek me at all? Why not confide in
those swarthy attendants, who doubtless are slaves to your
orders?"</p>

<p>"Confide in slaves! when the first task enjoined to them would
be to discover, and refrain from purloining gold! Seven such
unscrupulous knaves, or even one such, and I, thus defenceless and
feeble! Such is not the work that wise masters confide to fierce
slaves. But that is the least of the reasons which exclude them
from my choice, and fix my choice of assistant on you. Do you
forget what I told you of the danger which the Dervish declared no
bribe I could offer could tempt him a second time to brave?"</p>

<p>"I remember now; those words had passed away from my mind."</p>

<p>"And because they had passed away from your mind, I chose you
for my comrade. I need a man by whom danger is scorned."</p>

<p>"But in the process of which you tell me I see no possible
danger unless the ingredients you mix in your caldron have
poisonous fumes."</p>

<p>"It is not that. The ingredients I use are not poisons."</p>

<p>"What other danger, except you dread your own Eastern slaves?
But, if so, why lead them to these solitudes; and, if so, why not
bid me be armed?"</p>

<p>"The Eastern slaves, fulfilling my commands, wait for my summons
where their eyes cannot see what we do. The danger is of a kind in
which the boldest son of the East would be more craven, perhaps,
than the daintiest Sybarite of Europe, who would shrink from a
panther and laugh at a ghost. In the creed of the Dervish, and of
all who adventure into that realm of nature which is closed to
philosophy and open to magic, there are races in the magnitude of
space unseen as animalcules in the world of a drop. For the tribes
of the drop, science has its microscope. Of the host of yon azure
Infinite magic gains sight, and through them gains command over
fluid conductors that link all the parts of creation. Of these
races, some are wholly indifferent to man, some benign to him, and
some dreadly hostile. In all the regular and prescribed conditions
of mortal being, this magic realm seems as blank and tenantless as
yon vacant air. But when a seeker of powers beyond the rude
functions by which man plies the clockwork that measures his hours,
and stops when its chain reaches the end of its coil, strives to
pass over those boundaries at which philosophy says, 'Knowledge
ends,'&mdash;then he is like all other travellers in regions
unknown; he must propitiate or brave the tribes that are
hostile,&mdash;must depend for his life on the tribes that are
friendly. Though your science discredits the alchemist's dogmas,
your learning informs you that all alchemists were not ignorant
impostors; yet those whose discoveries prove them to have been the
nearest allies to your practical knowledge, ever hint in their
mystical works at the reality of that realm which is open to
magic,&mdash;ever hint that some means less familiar than furnace
and bellows are essential to him who explores the elixir of life.
He who once quaffs that elixir, obtains in his very veins the
bright fluid by which he transmits the force of his will to
agencies dormant in nature, to giants unseen in the space. And
here, as he passes the boundary which divides his allotted and
normal mortality from the regions and races that magic alone can
explore, so, here, he breaks down the safeguard between himself and
the tribes that are hostile. Is it not ever thus between man and
man? Let a race the most gentle and timid and civilized dwell on
one side a river or mountain, and another have home in the region
beyond, each, if it pass not the intervening barrier, may with each
live in peace. But if ambitious adventurers scale the mountain, or
cross the river, with design to subdue and enslave the population
they boldly invade, then all the invaded arise in wrath and
defiance,&mdash;the neighbours are changed into foes. And therefore
this process&mdash;by which a simple though rare material of nature
is made to yield to a mortal the boon of a life which brings, with
its glorious resistance to Time, desires and faculties to subject
to its service beings that dwell in the earth and the air and the
deep&mdash;has ever been one of the same peril which an invader
must brave when he crosses the bounds of his nation. By this key
alone you unlock all the cells of the alchemist's lore; by this
alone understand how a labour, which a chemist's crudest apprentice
could perform, has baffled the giant fathers of all your dwarfed
children of science. Nature, that stores this priceless boon, seems
to shrink from conceding it to man; the invisible tribes that abhor
him, oppose themselves to the gain that might give them a master.
The duller of those who were the life-seekers of old would have
told you how some chance, trivial, unlooked-for, foiled their grand
hope at the very point of fruition,&mdash;some doltish mistake,
some improvident oversight, a defect in the sulphur, a wild
overflow in the quicksilver, or a flaw in the bellows, or a pupil
who failed to replenish the fuel, by falling asleep by the furnace.
The invisible foes seldom vouchsafe to make themselves visible
where they can frustrate the bungler, as they mock at his toils
from their ambush. But the mightier adventurers, equally foiled in
despite of their patience and skill, would have said, 'Not with us
rests the fault; we neglected no caution, we failed from no
oversight. But out from the caldron dread faces arose, and the
spectres or demons dismayed and baffled us.' Such, then, is the
danger which seems so appalling to a son of the East, as it seemed
to a seer in the dark age of Europe. But we can deride all its
threats, you and I. For myself, I own frankly I take all the safety
that the charms and resources of magic bestow. You, for your
safety, have the cultured and disciplined reason which reduces all
fantasies to nervous impressions; and I rely on the courage of one
who has questioned, unquailing, the Luminous Shadow, and wrested
from the hand of the magician himself the wand which concentred the
wonders of will!"</p>

<p>To this strange and long discourse I listened without
interruption, and now quietly answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not merit the trust you affect in my courage; but I am now
on my guard against the cheats of the fancy, and the fumes of a
vapour can scarcely bewilder the brain in the open air of this
mountain-land. I believe in no races like those which you tell me
lie viewless in space, as do gases. I believe not in magic; I ask
not its aids, and I dread not its terrors. For the rest, I am
confident of one mournful courage,&mdash;the courage that comes
from despair. I submit to your guidance, whatever it be, as a
sufferer whom colleges doom to the grave submits to the quack who
says, 'Take my specific and live!' My life is nought in itself; my
life lives in another. You and I are both brave from despair; you
would turn death from yourself, I would turn death from one I love
more than myself. Both know how little aid we can win from the
colleges, and both, therefore, turn to the promises most
audaciously cheering. Dervish or magician, alchemist or phantom,
what care you and I? And if they fail us, what then? They cannot
fail us more than the colleges do!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIII.</h2>

<p>The gold has been gained with an easy labour. I knew where to
seek for it, whether under the turf or in the bed of the creek. But
Margrave's eyes, hungrily gazing round every spot from which the
ore was disburied, could not detect the substance of which he alone
knew the outward appearance. I had begun to believe that, even in
the description given to him of this material, he had been
credulously duped, and that no such material existed, when, coming
back from the bed of the watercourse, I saw a faint yellow gleam
amidst the roots of a giant parasite plant, the leaves and blossoms
of which climbed up the sides of the cave with its antediluvian
relics. The gleam was the gleam of gold, and on removing the loose
earth round the roots of the plant, we came on&mdash;No, I will
not, I dare not, describe it. The gold-digger would cast it aside,
the naturalist would pause not to heed it; and did I describe it,
and chemistry deign to subject it to analysis, could chemistry
alone detach or discover its boasted virtues?</p>

<p>Its particles, indeed, are very minute, not seeming readily to
crystallize with each other; each in itself of uniform shape and
size, spherical as the egg which contains the germ of life, and
small as the egg from which the life of an insect may quicken.</p>

<p>But Margrave's keen eye caught sight of the atoms upcast by the
light of the moon. He exclaimed to me, "Found! I shall live!" And
then, as he gathered up the grains with tremulous hands, he called
out to the Veiled Woman, hitherto still seated motionless on the
crag. At his word she rose and went to the place hard by, where the
fuel was piled, busying herself there. I had no leisure to heed
her. I continued my search in the soft and yielding soil that time
and the decay of vegetable life had accumulated over the
Pre-Adamite strata on which the arch of the cave rested its mighty
keystone.</p>

<p>When we had collected of these particles about thrice as much as
a man might hold in his hand, we seemed to have exhausted their
bed. We continued still to find gold, but no more of the delicate
substance, to which, in our sight, gold was as dross.</p>

<p>"Enough," then said Margrave, reluctantly desisting. "What we
have gained already will suffice for a life thrice as long as
legend attributes to Haroun. I shall live,&mdash;I shall live
through the centuries."</p>

<p>"Forget not that I claim my share."</p>

<p>"Your share&mdash;yours! True&mdash;your half of my life! It is
true." He paused with a low, ironical, malignant laugh; and then
added, as he rose and turned away, "But the work is yet to be
done."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIV.</h2>

<p>While we had thus laboured and found, Ayesha had placed the fuel
where the moonlight fell fullest on the sward of the
tableland,&mdash;a part of it already piled as for a fire, the rest
of it heaped confusedly close at hand; and by the pile she had
placed the coffer. And there she stood, her arms folded under her
mantle, her dark image seeming darker still as the moonlight
whitened all the ground from which the image rose motionless.
Margrave opened his coffer, the Veiled Woman did not aid him, and I
watched in silence, while he as silently made his weird and
wizard-like preparations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXV.</h2>

<p>On the ground a wide circle was traced by a small rod, tipped
apparently with sponge saturated with some combustible naphtha-like
fluid, so that a pale lambent flame followed the course of the rod
as Margrave guided it, burning up the herbage over which it played,
and leaving a distinct ring, like that which, in our lovely native
fable-talk, we call the "Fairy's Ring," but yet more visible
because marked in phosphorescent light. On the ring thus formed
were placed twelve small lamps, fed with the fluid from the same
vessel, and lighted by the same rod. The light emitted by the lamps
was more vivid and brilliant than that which circled round the
ring.</p>

<p>Within the circumference, and immediately round the woodpile,
Margrave traced certain geometrical figures, in which&mdash;not
without a shudder, that I overcame at once by a strong effort of
will in murmuring to myself the name of "Lilian"&mdash;I recognized
the interlaced triangles which my own hand, in the spell enforced
on a sleep-walker, had described on the floor of the wizard's
pavilion. The figures were traced, like the circle, in flame, and
at the point of each triangle (four in number) was placed a lamp,
brilliant as those on the ring. This task performed, the caldron,
based on an iron tripod, was placed on the wood-pile. And then the
woman, before inactive and unheeding, slowly advanced, knelt by the
pile, and lighted it. The dry wood crackled and the flame burst
forth, licking the rims of the caldron with tongues of fire.</p>

<p>Margrave flung into the caldron the particles we had collected,
poured over them first a liquid, colourless as water, from the
largest of the vessels drawn from his coffer, and then, more
sparingly, drops from small crystal phials, like the phials I had
seen in the hand of Philip Derval.</p>

<p>Having surmounted my first impulse of awe, I watched these
proceedings, curious yet disdainful, as one who watches the
mummeries of an enchanter on the stage.</p>

<p>"If," thought I, "these are but artful devices to inebriate and
fool my own imagination, my imagination is on its guard, and reason
shall not, this time, sleep at her post!"</p>

<p>"And now," said Margrave, "I consign to you the easy task by
which you are to merit your share of the elixir. It is my task to
feed and replenish the caldron; it is Ayesha's to heed the fire,
which must not for a moment relax in its measured and steady heat.
Your task is the lightest of all it is but to renew from this
vessel the fluid that burns in the lamps, and on the ring. Observe,
the contents of the vessel must be thriftily husbanded; there is
enough, but not more than enough, to sustain the light in the
lamps, on the lines traced round the caldron, and on the farther
ring, for six hours. The compounds dissolved in this fluid are
scarce,&mdash;only obtainable in the East, and even in the East
months might have passed before I could have increased my
supply.</p>

<p>"I had no months to waste. Replenish, then, the light only when
it begins to flicker or fade. Take heed, above all, that no part of
the outer ring&mdash;no, not an inch&mdash;and no lamp of the
twelve, that are to its zodiac like stars, fade for one moment in
darkness."</p>

<p>I took the crystal vessel from his hand.</p>

<p>"The vessel is small," said I, "and what is yet left of its
contents is but scanty; whether its drops suffice to replenish the
lights I cannot guess,&mdash;I can but obey your instructions. But,
more important by far than the light to the lamps and the circle,
which in Asia or Africa might scare away the wild beasts unknown to
this land&mdash;more important than light to a lamp, is the
strength to your frame, weak magician! What will support you
through six weary hours of night-watch?"</p>

<p>"Hope," answered Margrave, with a ray of his old dazzling style.
"Hope! I shall live,&mdash;I shall live through the centuries!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVI.</h2>

<p>One hour passed away; the fagots under the caldron burned clear
in the sullen sultry air. The materials within began to seethe, and
their colour, at first dull and turbid, changed into a pale-rose
hue; from time to time the Veiled Woman replenished the fire, after
she had done so reseating herself close by the pyre, with her head
bowed over her knees, and her face hid under her veil.</p>

<p>The lights in the lamps and along the ring and the triangles now
began to pale. I resupplied their nutriment from the crystal
vessel. As yet nothing strange startled my eye or my ear beyond the
rim of the circle,&mdash;nothing audible, save, at a distance, the
musical wheel-like click of the locusts, and, farther still, in the
forest, the howl of the wild dogs, that never bark; nothing
visible, but the trees and the mountain-range girding the plains
silvered by the moon, and the arch of the cavern, the flush of wild
blooms on its sides, and the gleam of dry bones on its floor, where
the moonlight shot into the gloom.</p>

<p>The second hour passed like the first. I had taken my stand by
the side of Margrave, watching with him the process at work in the
caldron, when I felt the ground slightly vibrate beneath my feet,
and, looking up, it seemed as if all the plains beyond the circle
were heaving like the swell of the sea, and as if in the air itself
there was a perceptible tremor.</p>

<p>I placed my hand on Margrave's shoulder and whispered, "To me
earth and air seem to vibrate. Do they seem to vibrate to you?"</p>

<p>"I know not, I care not," he answered impetuously. "The essence
is bursting the shell that confined it. Here are my air and my
earth! Trouble me not. Look to the circle! feed the lamps if they
fail."</p>

<p>I passed by the Veiled Woman as I walked towards a place in the
ring in which the flame was waning dim; and I whispered to her the
same question which I had whispered to Margrave. She looked slowly
around, and answered, "So is it before the Invisible make
themselves visible! Did I not bid him forbear?" Her head again
drooped on her breast, and her watch was again fixed on the
fire.</p>

<p>I advanced to the circle and stooped to replenish the light
where it waned. As I did so, on my arm, which stretched somewhat
beyond the line of the ring, I felt a shock like that of
electricity. The arm fell to my side numbed and nerveless, and from
my hand dropped, but within the ring, the vessel that contained the
fluid. Recovering my surprise or my stun, hastily with the other
hand I caught up the vessel, but some of the scanty liquid was
already spilled on the sward; and I saw with a thrill of dismay,
that contrasted indeed the tranquil indifference with which I had
first undertaken my charge, how small a supply was now left.</p>

<p>I went back to Margrave, and told him of the shock, and of its
consequence in the waste of the liquid.</p>

<p>"Beware," said he, "that not a motion of the arm, not an inch of
the foot, pass the verge of the ring; and if the fluid be thus
unhappily stinted, reserve all that is left for the protecting
circle and the twelve outer lamps! See how the Grand Work advances!
how the hues in the caldron are glowing blood-red through the film
on the surface!"</p>

<p>And now four hours of the six were gone; my arm had gradually
recovered its strength. Neither the ring nor the lamps had again
required replenishing; perhaps their light was exhausted less
quickly, as it was no longer to be exposed to the rays of the
intense Australian moon. Clouds had gathered over the sky, and
though the moon gleamed at times in the gaps that they left in blue
air, her beam was more hazy and dulled. The locusts no longer were
heard in the grass, nor the howl of the dogs in the forest. Out of
the circle, the stillness was profound.</p>

<p>And about this time I saw distinctly in the distance a vast Eye!
It drew nearer and nearer, seeming to move from the ground at the
height of some lofty giant. Its gaze riveted mine; my blood curdled
in the blaze from its angry ball; and now as it advanced larger and
larger, other Eyes, as if of giants in its train, grew out from the
space in its rear; numbers on numbers, like the spearheads of some
Eastern army, seen afar by pale warders of battlements doomed to
the dust. My voice long refused an utterance to my awe; at length
it burst forth shrill and loud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look! look! Those terrible Eyes! Legions on legions! And hark!
that tramp of numberless feet; they are not seen, but the hollows
of earth echo the sound of their march!"</p>

<p>Margrave, more than ever intent on the caldron, in which, from
time to time, he kept dropping powders or essences drawn forth from
his coffer, looked up, defyingly, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Ye come," he said, in a low mutter, his once mighty voice
sounding hollow and labouring, but fearless and firm,&mdash;"ye
come,&mdash;not to conquer, vain rebels!&mdash;ye whose dark chief
I struck down at my feet in the tomb where my spell had raised up
the ghost of your first human master, the Chaldee! Earth and air
have their armies still faithful to me, and still I remember the
war-song that summons them up to confront you! Ayesha! Ayesha!
recall the wild troth that we pledged amongst roses; recall the
dread bond by which we united our sway over hosts that yet own thee
as queen, though my sceptre is broken, my diadem reft from my
brows!"</p>

<p>The Veiled Woman rose at this adjuration. Her veil now was
withdrawn, and the blaze of the fire between Margrave and herself
flushed, as with the rosy bloom of youth, the grand beauty of her
softened face. It was seen, detached as it were, from her
dark-mantled form; seen through the mist of the vapours which rose
from the caldron, framing it round like the clouds. that are
yieldingly pierced by the light of the evening star.</p>

<p>Through the haze of the vapour came her voice, more musical,
more plaintive than I had heard it before, but far softer, more
tender; still in her foreign tongue; the words unknown to me, and
yet their sense, perhaps, made intelligible by the love, which has
one common language and one common look to all who have
loved,&mdash;the love unmistakably heard in the loving tone,
unmistakably seen in the loving face.</p>

<p>A moment or so more, and she had come round from the opposite
side of the fire-pile, and bending over Margrave's upturned brow,
kissed it quietly, solemnly; and then her countenance grew fierce,
her crest rose erect; it was the lioness protecting her young. She
stretched forth her arm from the black mantle, athwart the pale
front that now again bent over the caldron,&mdash;stretched it
towards the haunted and hollow-sounding space beyond, in the
gesture of one whose right hand has the sway of the sceptre. And
then her voice stole on the air in the music of a chant, not loud,
yet far-reaching; so thrilling, so sweet, and yet so solemn, that I
could at once comprehend how legend united of old the spell of
enchantment with the power of song. All that I recalled of the
effects which, in the former time, Margrave's strange chants had
produced on the ear that they ravished and the thoughts they
confused, was but as the wild bird's imitative carol, compared to
the depth and the art and the soul of the singer, whose voice
seemed endowed with a charm to enthrall all the tribes of creation,
though the language it used for that charm might to them, as to me,
be unknown. As the song ceased, I heard, from behind, sounds like
those I had heard in the spaces before me,&mdash;the tramp of
invisible feet, the whir of invisible wings, as if armies were
marching to aid against armies in march to destroy.</p>

<p>"Look not in front nor around," said Ayesha. "Look, like him, on
the caldron below. The circle and the lamps are yet bright; I will
tell you when the light again fails."</p>

<p>I dropped my eyes on the caldron.</p>

<p>"See," whispered Margrave, "the sparkles at last begin to arise,
and the rose-hues to deepen,&mdash;signs that we near the last
process."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVII.</h2>

<p>The fifth hour had passed away, when Ayesha said to me, "Lo! the
circle is fading; the lamps grow dim. Look now without fear on the
space beyond; the eyes that appalled thee are again lost in air, as
lightnings that fleet back into cloud."</p>

<p>I looked up, and the spectres had vanished. The sky was tinged
with sulphurous hues, the red and the black intermixed. I
replenished the lamps and the ring in front, thriftily, heedfully;
but when I came to the sixth lamp, not a drop in the vessel that
fed them was left. In a vague dismay, I now looked round the half
of the wide circle in rear of the two bended figures intent on the
caldron. All along that disk the light was already broken, here and
there flickering up, here and there dying down; the six lamps in
that half of the circle still twinkled, but faintly, as stars
shrinking fast from the dawn of day. But it was not the fading
shine in that half of the magical ring which daunted my eye and
quickened with terror the pulse of my heart; the Bushland beyond
was on fire. From the background of the forest rose the flame and
the smoke,&mdash;the smoke, there, still half smothering the flame.
But along the width of the grasses and herbage, between the verge
of the forest and the bed of the water-creek just below the raised
platform from which I beheld the dread conflagration, the fire was
advancing,&mdash;wave upon wave, clear and red against the columns
of rock behind,&mdash;as the rush of a flood through the mists of
some Alp crowned with lightnings.</p>

<p>Roused from my stun at the first sight of a danger not foreseen
by the mind I had steeled against far rarer portents of Nature, I
cared no more for the lamps and the circle. Hurrying back to
Ayesha, I exclaimed: "The phantoms have gone from the spaces in
front; but what incantation or spell can arrest the red march of
the foe, speeding on in the rear! While we gazed on the caldron of
life, behind us, unheeded, behold the Destroyer!"</p>

<p>Ayesha looked, and made no reply; but, as by involuntary
instinct, bowed her majestic head, then rearing it erect, placed
herself yet more immediately before the wasted form of the young
magician (he still bending over the caldron, and hearing me not in
the absorption and hope of his watch),&mdash;placed herself before
him, as the bird whose first care is her fledgling.</p>

<p>As we two there stood, fronting the deluge of fire, we heard
Margrave behind us, murmuring low, "See the bubbles of light, how
they sparkle and dance! I shall live, I shall live!" And his words
scarcely died in our ears before, crash upon crash, came the fall
of the age-long trees in the forest; and nearer, all near us,
through the blazing grasses, the hiss of the serpents, the scream
of the birds, and the bellow and tramp of the herds plunging wild
through the billowy red of their pastures.</p>

<p>Ayesha now wound her arms around Margrave, and wrenched him,
reluctant and struggling, from his watch over the seething caldron.
In rebuke; of his angry exclamations, she pointed to the march of
the fire, spoke in sorrowful tones a few words in her own language,
and then, appealing to me in English, said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tell him that here the Spirits who oppose us have summoned a
foe that is deaf to my voice, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And," exclaimed Margrave, no longer with gasp and effort, but
with the swell of a voice which drowned all the discords of terror
and of agony sent forth from the Phlegethon burning
below,&mdash;"and this witch, whom I trusted, is a vile slave and
impostor, more desiring my death than my life. She thinks that in
life I should scorn and forsake her, that in death I should die in
her arms! Sorceress, avaunt! Art thou useless and powerless now
when I need thee most? Go! Let the world be one funeral pyre! What
to me is the world? My world is my life! Thou knowest that my last
hope is here,&mdash;that all the strength left me this night will
die down, like the lamps in the circle, unless the elixir restore
it. Bold friend, spurn that sorceress away. Hours yet ere those
flames can assail us! A few minutes more, and life to your Lilian
and me!"</p>

<p>Thus having said, Margrave turned from us, and cast into the
caldron the last essence yet left in his empty coffer. Ayesha
silently drew her black veil over her face; and turned, with the
being she loved, from the terror he scorned, to share in the hope
that he cherished.</p>

<p>Thus left alone, with my reason disenthralled, disenchanted, I
surveyed more calmly the extent of the actual peril with which we
were threatened, and the peril seemed less, so surveyed.</p>

<p>It is true all the Bush-land behind, almost up to the bed of the
creek, was on fire; but the grasses, through which the flame spread
so rapidly, ceased at the opposite marge of the creek. Watery pools
were still, at intervals, left in the bed of the creek, shining
tremulous, like waves of fire, in the glare reflected from the
burning land; and even where the water failed, the stony course of
the exhausted rivulet was a barrier against the march of the
conflagration. Thus, unless the wind, now still, should rise, and
waft some sparks to the parched combustible herbage immediately
around us, we were saved from the fire, and our work might yet be
achieved.</p>

<p>I whispered to Ayesha the conclusion to which I came. "Thinkest
thou," she answered, without raising her mournful head, "that the
Agencies of Nature are the movements of chance? The Spirits I
invoked to his aid are leagued with the hosts that assail. A
mightier than I am has doomed him!"</p>

<p>Scarcely had she uttered these words before Margrave exclaimed,
"Behold how the Rose of the alchemist's dream enlarges its blooms
from the folds of its petals! I shall live, I shall live!"</p>

<p>I looked, and the liquid which glowed in the caldron had now
taken a splendour that mocked all comparisons borrowed from the
lustre of gems. In its prevalent colour it had, indeed, the dazzle
and flash of the ruby; but out from the mass of the molten red,
broke coruscations of all prismal hues, shooting, shifting, in a
play that made the wavelets them selves seem living things,
sensible of their joy. No longer was there scum or film upon the
surface; only ever and anon a light rosy vapour floating up, and
quick lost in the haggard, heavy, sulphurous air, hot with the
conflagration rushing towards us from behind. And these
coruscations formed, on the surface of the molten ruby, literally
the shape of a Rose, its leaves made distinct in their outlines by
sparks of emerald and diamond and sapphire.</p>

<p>Even while gazing on this animated liquid lustre, a buoyant
delight seemed infused into my senses; all terrors conceived before
were annulled; the phantoms, whose armies had filled the wide
spaces in front, were forgotten; the crash of the forest behind was
unheard. In the reflection of that glory, Margrave's wan cheek
seemed already restored to the radiance it wore when I saw it first
in the framework of blooms.</p>

<p>As I gazed, thus enchanted, a cold hand touched my own.</p>

<p>"Hush!" whispered Ayesha, from the black veil, against which the
rays of the caldron fell blunt, and absorbed into Dark. "Behind us,
the light of the circle is extinct, but there we are guarded from
all save the brutal and soulless destroyers. But before!&mdash;but
before!&mdash;see, two of the lamps have died out!&mdash;see the
blank of the gap in the ring Guard that breach,&mdash;there the
demons will enter."</p>

<p>"Not a drop is there left in his vessel by which to replenish
the lamps on the ring."</p>

<p>"Advance, then; thou hast still the light of the soul, and the
demons may recoil before a soul that is dauntless and guiltless. If
not, Three are lost!&mdash;as it is, One is doomed."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, silently, involuntarily, I passed from the Veiled
Woman's side, over the sere lines on the turf which had been traced
by the triangles of light long since extinguished, and towards the
verge of the circle. As I advanced, overhead rushed a dark cloud of
wings,&mdash;birds dislodged from the forest on fire, and
screaming, in dissonant terror, as they flew towards the
farthermost mountains; close by my feet hissed and glided the
snakes, driven forth from their blazing coverts, and glancing
through the ring, unscared by its waning lamps; all undulating by
me, bright-eyed and hissing, all made innocuous by fear,&mdash;even
the terrible Death-adder, which I trampled on as I halted at the
verge of the circle, did not turn to bite, but crept harmless away.
I halted at the gap between the two dead lamps, and bowed my head
to look again into the crystal vessel. Were there, indeed, no
lingering drops yet left, if but to recruit the lamps for some
priceless minutes more? As I thus stood, right into the gap between
the two dead lamps strode a gigantic Foot. All the rest of the form
was unseen; only, as volume after volume of smoke poured on from
the burning land behind, it seemed as if one great column of
vapour, eddying round, settled itself aloft from the circle, and
that out from that column strode the giant Foot. And, as strode the
Foot, so with it came, like the sound of its tread, a roll of
muttered thunder.</p>

<p>I recoiled, with a cry that rang loud through the lurid air.</p>

<p>"Courage!" said the voice of Ayesha. "Trembling soul, yield not
an inch to the demon!"</p>

<p>At the charm, the wonderful charm, in the tone of the Veiled
Woman's voice, my will seemed to take a force more sublime than its
own. I folded my arms on my breast, and stood as if rooted to the
spot, confronting the column of smoke and the stride of the giant
Foot. And the Foot halted, mute.</p>

<p>Again, in the momentary hush of that suspense, I heard a
voice,&mdash;it was Margrave's.</p>

<p>"The last hour expires, the work is accomplished! Come! come!
Aid me to take the caldron from the fire; and quick!&mdash;or a
drop may be wasted in vapour&mdash;the Elixir of Life from the
caldron!"</p>

<p>At that cry I receded, and the Foot advanced.</p>

<p>And at that moment, suddenly, unawares, from behind, I was
stricken down. Over me, as I lay, swept a whirlwind of trampling
hoofs and glancing horns. The herds, in their flight from the
burning pastures, had rushed over the bed of the watercourse,
scaled the slopes of the banks. Snorting and bellowing, they
plunged their blind way to the mountains. One cry alone, more wild
than their own savage blare, pierced the reek through which the
Brute Hurricane swept. At that cry of wrath and despair I struggled
to rise, again dashed to earth by the hoofs and the horns. But was
it the dream-like deceit of my reeling senses, or did I see that
giant Foot stride past through the close-serried ranks of the
maddening herds? Did I hear, distinct through all the huge uproar
of animal terror, the roll of low thunder which followed the stride
of that Foot?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXVIII.</h2>

<p>When my sense had recovered its shock, and my eyes looked
dizzily round, the charge of the beasts had swept by; and of all
the wild tribes which had invaded the magical circle, the only
lingerer was the brown Death-adder, coiled close by the spot where
my head had rested. Beside the extinguished lamps which the hoofs
had confusedly scattered, the fire, arrested by the watercourse,
had consumed the grasses that fed it, and there the plains
stretched, black and desert as the Phlegroean Field of the Poet's
Hell. But the fire still raged in the forest beyond,&mdash;white
flames, soaring up from the trunks of the tallest trees, and
forming, through the sullen dark of the smoke-reek, innumerable
pillars of fire, like the halls in the City of fiends.</p>

<p>Gathering myself up, I turned my eyes from the terrible pomp of
the lurid forest, and looked fearfully down on the hoof-trampled
sward for my two companions.</p>

<p>I saw the dark image of Ayesha still seated, still bending, as I
had seen it last. I saw a pale hand feebly grasping the rim of the
magical caldron, which lay, hurled down from its tripod by the rush
of the beasts, yards away from the dim fading embers of the
scattered wood-pyre. I saw the faint writhings of a frail wasted
frame, over which the Veiled Woman was bending. I saw, as I moved
with bruised limbs to the place, close by the lips of the dying
magician, the flash of the ruby-like essence spilled on the sward,
and, meteor-like, sparkling up from the torn tufts of herbage.</p>

<p>I now reached Margrave's side. Bending over him as the Veiled
Woman bent, and as I sought gently to raise him, he turned his
face, fiercely faltering out, "Touch me not, rob me not! You share
with me! Never! never! These glorious drops are all mine! Die all
else! I will live! I will live!" Writhing himself from my pitying
arms, he plunged his face amidst the beautiful, playful flame of
the essence, as if to lap the elixir with lips scorched away from
its intolerable burning. Suddenly, with a low shriek, he fell back,
his face upturned to mine, and on that face unmistakably reigned
Death!</p>

<p>Then Ayesha tenderly, silently, drew the young head to her lap,
and it vanished from my sight behind her black veil.</p>

<p>I knelt beside her, murmuring some trite words of comfort; but
she heeded me not, rocking herself to and fro as the mother who
cradles a child to sleep. Soon the fast-flickering sparkles of the
lost elixir died out on the grass; and with their last sportive
diamond-like tremble of light, up, in all the suddenness of
Australian day, rose the sun, lifting himself royally above the
mountain-tops, and fronting the meaner blaze of the forest as a
young king fronts his rebels. And as there, where the bush-fires
had ravaged, all was a desert, so there, where their fury had not
spread, all was a garden. Afar, at the foot of the mountains, the
fugitive herds were grazing; the cranes, flocking back to the
pools, renewed the strange grace of their gambols; and the great
kingfisher, whose laugh, half in mirth, half in mockery, leads the
choir that welcome the morn,&mdash;which in Europe is
night,&mdash;alighted bold on the roof of the cavern, whose floors
were still white with the bones of races, extinct before&mdash;so
helpless through instincts, so royal through Soul&mdash;rose
Man!</p>

<p>But there, on the ground where the dazzling elixir had wasted
its virtues,&mdash;there the herbage already had a freshness of
verdure which, amid the duller sward round it, was like an oasis of
green in a desert. And there wild-flowers, whose chill hues the eye
would have scarcely distinguished the day before, now glittered
forth in blooms of unfamiliar beauty. Towards that spot were
attracted myriads of happy insects, whose hum of intense joy was
musically loud. But the form of the life-seeking sorcerer lay rigid
and stark; blind to the bloom of the wild-flowers, deaf to the glee
of the insects,&mdash;one hand still resting heavily on the rim of
the emptied caldron, and the face still hid behind the Black Veil.
What! the wondrous elixir, sought with such hope and well-nigh
achieved through such dread, fleeting back to the earth from which
its material was drawn, to give bloom, indeed,&mdash;but to herbs:
joy indeed,&mdash;but to insects!</p>

<p>And now, in the flash of the sun, slowly wound up the slopes
that led to the circle the same barbaric procession which had sunk
into the valley under the ray of the moon. The armed men came
first, stalwart and tall, their vests brave with crimson and golden
lace, their weapons gayly gleaming with holiday silver. After them,
the Black Litter. As they came to the place, Ayesha, not raising
her head, spoke to them in her own Eastern tongue. A wail was her
answer. The armed men bounded forward, and the bearers left the
litter.</p>

<p>All gathered round the dead form with the face concealed under
the black veil; all knelt, and all wept. Far in the distance, at
the foot of the blue mountains, a crowd of the savage natives had
risen up as if from the earth; they stood motionless, leaning on
their clubs and spears, and looking towards the spot on which we
were,&mdash;strangely thus brought into the landscape, as if they
too, the wild dwellers on the verge which Humanity guards from the
Brute, were among the mourners for the mysterious Child of
mysterious Nature! And still, in the herbage, hummed the small
insects, and still, from the cavern, laughed the great kingfisher.
I said to Ayesha, "Farewell! your love mourns the dead, mine calls
me to the living. You are now with your own people, they may
console you; say if I can assist."</p>

<p>"There is no consolation for me! What mourner can be consoled if
the dead die forever? Nothing for him is left but a grave; that
grave shall be in the land where the song of Ayesha first lulled
him to sleep. Thou assist Me,&mdash;thou, the wise man of Europe!
From me ask assistance. What road wilt thou take to thy home?"</p>

<p>"There is but one road known to me through the maze of the
solitude,&mdash;that which we took to this upland."</p>

<p>"On that road Death lurks, and awaits thee! Blind dupe, couldst
thou think that if the grand secret of life had been won, he whose
head rests on my lap would have yielded thee one petty drop of the
essence which had filched from his store of life but a moment? Me,
who so loved and so cherished him,&mdash;me he would have doomed to
the pitiless cord of my servant, the Strangler, if my death could
have lengthened a hair-breadth the span of his being. But what
matters to me his crime or his madness? I loved him! I loved
him!"</p>

<p>She bowed her veiled head lower and lower; perhaps, under the
veil, her lips kissed the lips of the dead. Then she said
whisperingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Juma the Strangler, whose word never failed to his master,
whose prey never slipped from his snare, waits thy step on the road
to thy home! But thy death cannot now profit the dead, the beloved.
And thou hast had pity for him who took but thine aid to design thy
destruction. His life is lost, thine is saved."</p>

<p>She spoke no more in the tongue that I could interpret. She
spoke, in the language unknown, a few murmured words to her swarthy
attendants; then the armed men, still weeping, rose, and made a
dumb sign to me to go with them. I understood by the sign that
Ayesha had told them to guard me on my way; but she gave no reply
to my parting thanks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXXIX.</h2>

<p>I descended into the valley; the armed men followed. The path,
on that side of the watercourse not reached by the flames, wound
through meadows still green, or amidst groves still unscathed. As a
turning in the way brought in front of my sight the place I had
left behind, I beheld the black litter creeping down the descent,
with its curtains closed, and the Veiled Woman walking by its side.
But soon the funeral procession was lost to my eyes, and the
thoughts that it roused were erased. The waves in man's brain are
like those of the sea, rushing on, rushing over the wrecks of the
vessels that rode on their surface, to sink, after storm, in their
deeps. One thought cast forth into the future now mastered all in
the past: "Was Lilian living still?" Absorbed in the gloom of that
thought, hurried on by the goad that my heart, in its tortured
impatience, gave to my footstep, I outstripped the slow stride of
the armed men, and, midway between the place I had left and the
home which I sped to, came, far in advance of my guards, into the
thicket in which the bushmen had started up in my path on the night
that Lilian had watched for my coming. The earth at my feet was
rife with creeping plants and many-coloured flowers, the sky
overhead was half-hid by motionless pines. Suddenly, whether
crawling out from the herbage, or dropping down from the trees, by
my side stood the white-robed and skeleton form,&mdash;Ayesha's
attendant, the Strangler.</p>

<p>I sprang from him shuddering, then halted and faced him. The
hideous creature crept towards me, cringing and fawning, making
signs of humble good-will and servile obeisance. Again I
recoiled,&mdash;wrathfully, loathingly; turned my face homeward,
and fled on. I thought I had baffled his chase, when, just at the
mouth of the thicket, he dropped from a bough in my path close
behind me. Before I could turn, some dark muffling substance fell
between my sight and the sun, and I felt a fierce strain at my
throat. But the words of Ayesha had warned me; with one rapid hand
I seized the noose before it could tighten too closely, with the
other I tore the bandage away from my eyes, and, wheeling round on
the dastardly foe, struck him down with one spurn of my foot. His
hand, as he fell, relaxed its hold on the noose; I freed my throat
from the knot, and sprang from the copse into the broad sunlit
plain. I saw no more of the armed men or the Strangler. Panting and
breathless, I paused at last before the fence, fragrant with
blossoms, that divided my home from the solitude.</p>

<p>The windows of Lilian's room were darkened; all within the house
seemed still.</p>

<p>Darkened and silenced Home! with the light and sounds of the
jocund day all around it. Was there yet hope in the Universe for
me? All to which I had trusted Hope had broken down! The anchors I
had forged for her hold in the beds of the ocean, her stay from the
drifts of the storm, had snapped like the reeds which pierce the
side that leans on the barb of their points, and confides in the
strength of their stems. No hope in the baffled resources of
recognized knowledge! No hope in the daring adventures of Mind into
regions unknown; vain alike the calm lore of the practised
physician, and the magical arts of the fated Enchanter! I had fled
from the commonplace teachings of Nature, to explore in her
Shadow-land marvels at variance with reason. Made brave by the
grandeur of love, I had opposed without quailing the stride of the
Demon, and by hope, when fruition seemed nearest, had been trodden
into dust by the hoofs of the beast! And yet, all the while, I had
scorned, as a dream more wild than the word of a sorcerer, the hope
that the old man and the child, the wise and the ignorant, took
from their souls as inborn. Man and fiend had alike failed a mind,
not ignoble, not skilless, not abjectly craven; alike failed a
heart not feeble and selfish, not dead to the hero's devotion,
willing to shed every drop of its blood for a something more dear
than an animal's life for itself! What remained&mdash;what remained
for man's hope?&mdash;man's mind and man's heart thus exhausting
their all with no other result but despair! What remained but the
mystery of mysteries, so clear to the sunrise of childhood, the
sunset of age, only dimmed by the clouds which collect round the
noon of our manhood? Where yet was Hope found? In the soul; in its
every-day impulse to supplicate comfort and light, from the Giver
of soul, wherever the heart is afflicted, the mind is obscured.</p>

<p>Then the words of Ayesha rushed over me: "What mourner can be
consoled, if the Dead die forever?" Through every pulse of my frame
throbbed that dread question. All Nature around seemed to murmur
it. And suddenly, as by a flash from heaven, the grand truth in
Faber's grand reasoning shone on me, and lighted up all, within and
without. Man alone, of all earthly creatures, asks, "Can the Dead
die forever?" and the instinct that urges the question is God's
answer to man! No instinct is given in vain.</p>

<p>And born with the instinct of soul is the instinct that leads
the soul from the seen to the unseen, from time to eternity, from
the torrent that foams towards the Ocean of Death, to the source of
its stream, far aloft from the Ocean.</p>

<p>"Know thyself," said the Pythian of old. "That precept descended
from Heaven." Know thyself! Is that maxim wise? If so, know thy
soul. But never yet did man come to the thorough conviction of soul
but what he acknowledged the sovereign necessity of prayer. In my
awe, in my rapture, all my thoughts seemed enlarged and illumined
and exalted. I prayed,&mdash;all my soul seemed one prayer. All my
past, with its pride and presumption and folly, grew distinct as
the form of a penitent, kneeling for pardon before setting forth on
the pilgrimage vowed to a shrine. And, sure now, in the deeps of a
soul first revealed to myself, that the Dead do not die forever, my
human love soared beyond its brief trial of terror and sorrow.
Daring not to ask from Heaven's wisdom that Lilian, for my sake,
might not yet pass away from the earth, I prayed that my soul might
be fitted to bear with submission whatever my Maker might ordain.
And if surviving her&mdash;without whom no beam from yon material
sun could ever warm into joy a morrow in human life&mdash;so to
guide my steps that they might rejoin her at last, and, in
rejoining, regain forever!</p>

<p>How trivial now became the weird riddle that, a little while
before, had been clothed in so solemn an awe! What mattered it to
the vast interests involved in the clear recognition of Soul and
Hereafter, whether or not my bodily sense, for a moment, obscured
the face of the Nature I should one day behold as a spirit?
Doubtless the sights and the sounds which had haunted the last
gloomy night, the calm reason of Faber would strip of their magical
seemings; the Eyes in the space and the Foot in the circle might be
those of no terrible Demons, but of the wild's savage children whom
I had seen, halting, curious and mute, in the light of the morning.
The tremor of the ground (if not, as heretofore, explicable by the
illusory impression of my own treacherous senses) might be but the
natural effect of elements struggling yet under a soil unmistakably
charred by volcanoes. The luminous atoms dissolved in the caldron
might as little be fraught with a vital elixir as are the
splendours of naphtha or phosphor. As it was, the weird rite had no
magic result. The magician was not rent limb from limb by the
fiends. By causes as natural as ever extinguished life's spark in
the frail lamp of clay, he had died out of sight&mdash;under the
black veil.</p>

<p>What mattered henceforth to Faith, in its far grander questions
and answers, whether Reason, in Faber, or Fancy, in me, supplied
the more probable guess at a hieroglyph which, if construed aright,
was but a word of small mark in the mystical language of Nature? If
all the arts of enchantment recorded by Fable were attested by
facts which Sages were forced to acknowledge, Sages would sooner or
later find some cause for such portents&mdash;not supernatural. But
what Sage, without cause supernatural, both without and within him,
can guess at the wonders he views in the growth of a blade of
grass, or the tints on an insect's wing? Whatever art Man can
achieve in his progress through time, Man's reason, in time, can
suffice to explain. But the wonders of God? These belong to the
Infinite; and these, O Immortal! will but develop new wonder on
wonder, though thy sight be a spirit's, and thy leisure to track
and to solve an eternity.</p>

<p>As I raised my face from my clasped hands, my eyes fell full
upon a form standing in the open doorway. There, where on the night
in which Lilian's long struggle for reason and life had begun, the
Luminous Shadow had been beheld in the doubtful light of a dying
moon and a yet hazy dawn; there, on the threshold, gathering round
her bright locks the aureole of the glorious sun, stood Amy, the
blessed child! And as I gazed, drawing nearer and nearer to the
silenced house, and that Image of Peace on its threshold, I felt
that Hope met me at the door,&mdash;Hope in the child's steadfast
eyes, Hope in the child's welcoming smile!</p>

<p>"I was at watch for you," whispered Amy. "All is well."</p>

<p>"She lives still&mdash;she lives! Thank God! thank God!"</p>

<p>"She lives,&mdash;she will recover!" said another voice, as my
head sunk on Faber's shoulder. "For some hours in the night her
sleep was disturbed, convulsed. I feared, then, the worst.
Suddenly, just before the dawn, she called out aloud, still in
sleep,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The cold and dark shadow has passed away from me and from
Allen,&mdash;passed away from us both forever!'</p>

<p>"And from that moment the fever left her; the breathing became
soft, the pulse steady, and the colour stole gradually back to her
cheek. The crisis is past. Nature's benign Disposer has permitted
Nature to restore your life's gentle partner, heart to heart, mind
to mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And soul to soul," I cried, in my solemn joy. "Above as below,
soul to soul!" Then, at a sign from Faber, the child took me by the
hand and led me up the stairs into Lilian's room.</p>

<p>Again those clear arms closed around me in wife-like and holy
love, and those true lips kissed away my tears,&mdash;even as now,
at the distance of years from that happy morn, while I write the
last words of this Strange Story, the same faithful arms close
around me, the same tender lips kiss away my tears.</p>
