<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter I.</h2>

<p>Tucked away in many corners of London are streets and squares,
which appear to be entirely alienate from their surroundings.
Outside their boundaries is the noise and rush of modern
commercialism. Within their precinct a peace that borders, almost,
on stagnation.</p>

<p>Such a place was Pontin Square. A long narrow street joined it
to Oxford Street entering the Square on the south side. The lines
of houses to the west and north were unbroken, but on the east a
short lane led past the mews entrance into Manchester Street. No.
14 Pontin Square was on the east side of the Square.</p>

<p>Pontin Square contained excellent houses. Built at a period when
interior comfort was preferred to exterior display, they gave to
the visitor a blank, stolid view. Within, while old fashioned in
design and furnishings, they attracted by their air of homely
comfort.</p>

<p>To many, 14 Pontin Square held a peculiar fascination. Casual
passers turned to look at the darkened windows, behind which lived
Ezra Gleed, the one time Wheat King.</p>

<p>Until the day when Ezra Gleed wound up his many business
interests and retired from the Chicago Wheat pit to Pontin Square,
his history had been no different from many another money monarch.
From the humble beginnings of street arab he had risen rapidly, his
path marked by the ruins of his opponents. Day by day he had
accumulated money until with one sharp, bold stroke of genius and
forethought, he held for three days the world's wheat supply in his
hand. He had succeeded where others had failed.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had the good sense to realise the structure he
had built was not permanent. Taking a rapid but enormous profit he
announced his retirement from business and sailed immediately for
England, ultimately buying 14 Pontin Square. Years passed and Ezra
Gleed became but a name in the financial world he had once
ruled.</p>

<p>At intervals stories were printed of his great financial
battles, told as of one who had passed the portals of death; yet he
had lived on in that old house, almost forgotten. Now he was dying.
He lay on an old-fashioned four-posted bed in the centre of the
room, drearily dark in spite of the fact that the windows were wide
open. The furniture was old and solid in pattern, some of it of
great value. By one of the windows stood a large writing table and
seated at it a man. On the mantelpiece a clock ticked noisily.</p>

<p>"Have they come yet?"</p>

<p>As Ezra Gleed whispered the question the house bell tinkled
faintly in the distance. He raised his head at the sound.</p>

<p>"Go and see Smeardon."</p>

<p>The man at the desk rose and left the room, returning almost
immediately.</p>

<p>"The doctors and Mr. Waverill," he announced softly.</p>

<p>Gleed made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>"Bring them here at once. My time is running short."</p>

<p>In a while the three men stood by the bedside. Gleed looked at
them for a few minutes in silence.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he said slowly and distinctly to the doctors. "My
secretary, Mr. Smeardon, has explained to you why I desire your
attendance. Make your examination quickly. I have much to do."</p>

<p>It was a short examination and after a few words of consultation
the doctors again approached the bed.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We suggest you complete your business arrangements as soon as
possible," said one of the doctors gravely.</p>

<p>"I am aware of that. What of my mental conditions?"</p>

<p>"Your brain is unimpaired."</p>

<p>"Will you certify to that?"</p>

<p>The doctor looked at his colleague, who nodded.</p>

<p>"If you wish us to do so."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Is Mr. Waverill there?"</p>

<p>The lawyer approached the bed.</p>

<p>"Have you my will?" asked Gleed.</p>

<p>"It is here."</p>

<p>"Read it aloud. I wish these gentlemen to hear it read and then
witness it."</p>

<p>The solicitor drew the will from his pocket. Seating himself
beside the bed he commenced to read in a low even voice.</p>

<p>"This is the last Will and Testament of me Ezra Gleed of 14
Pontin Square Oxford Street in the county of London England,
financier. I revoke all former wills and testaments and I give
devise and bequeath to each of my servants now in my employ the sum
of one hundred pounds sterling free of legacy duty for each
completed year of their service with me. I give devise and bequeath
to my nephew Claude Wilton Merrivale, the only son of my sister
Jane Merrivale, the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling free of
legacy duty. I give devise and bequeath to Matthew Smeardon, my
private secretary, the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling free of
legacy duty on condition he continues to occupy my house 14 Pontin
Square for the term of twelve calendar months from the date of my
death and shall particularly remain in the said house between the
hours of 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on each full noon night during the above
mentioned period of twelve months, such legacy to be paid to him on
the fulfilment of the said conditions and I direct that my executor
pay to the said Matthew Smeardon such sums as he may consider
advisable for the upkeep of the said house during the said period.
I give devise and bequeath to my niece, Olga Mary Pellet, of the
United States of America, the daughter of my sister Mary Pellet,
the residue of my real and personal estate on condition that on one
of the aforesaid full moon nights during the said period and
between the said hours of 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. she applies in person
to the said Matthew Smeardon at the said house, 14 Pontin Square,
for a sealed envelope bearing the seal of the Nine Stars and that
such application shall not be made in the presence of my said
nephew, Claude Wilton Merrivale, nor while my said nephew is on the
said premises, such legacy to take effect only on the fulfilment of
the said conditions, and should the said Olga Mary Pellet fail to
carry out the said conditions I give devise and bequeath the said
residue of my real and personal property to my said nephew, Claude
Wilton Merrivale, absolutely and without condition and I appoint
Edward William Waverill, solicitor, of Holborn Inn to be the
executor and trustee of this my will."</p>

<p>When the lawyer had concluded reading, Gleed turned to the
doctors.</p>

<p>"You have heard, gentlemen. Will you witness this will as
certifying that I am of sound mind?"</p>

<p>The doctors nodded assent. Waverill placed the will on the bed
and Gleed signed with a firm hand. Thee the doctors signed. When
the solicitor had placed the will in its envelope again, Gleed
beckoned to Smeardon.</p>

<p>"You heard the will read, Smeardon. Will you swear to carry out
the conditions binding you faithfully?"</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>Gleed looked at the man searchingly.</p>

<p>"I know you for a rogue, Smeardon. For some years I have known
no good of you. I know you for a rogue, yet I have employed you,
for a rogue, at times, was useful to me. In this trust I have
placed on you I shall not be here to watch you. It is a big
responsibility, the happiness and welfare of two people depends on
your faithful obedience. Swear you will carry out my instructions
to the letter without thought of a further reward than I have given
you in my will."</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"You swear; yet swear falsely. When I am no longer here to
watch, you will turn traitor to your trust. I know you for a
traitor, and because I know that, I have laid this responsibility
on you. I know, too, that these children to whom I have willed my
fortune, are worthy of their race and will defeat your feeble
plottings. They will beat you, Matthew Smeardon, and you will lose
that which might have been honestly yours."</p>

<p>The dying man paused for breath, motioning Smeardon away from
him. When he had regained some strength he beckoned to the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"Give me the letters. My time is short."</p>

<p>When he had signed the letters he handed them back to the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"See that they are posted immediately I am dead. Do not allow
them out of your charge until then, and let no one see to whom they
are addressed. Post them with your own hands. Now go, all of you. I
have finished with this world."</p>

<p>An hour later the body of Ezra Gleed lay in the gloomy chamber
alone. A few hours more and that clay would be placed in the
silence of the tomb. Ezra Gleed, the financier, was dead.</p>

<p>Through the streets of London the newsboys shouted the tidings.
A king of finance had gone to a kingdom where gold held no sway.
Autobiographies recounted how he had gathered his wealth,
speculating on the extent of the fortune he had been forced to
leave behind him. They acclaimed him a ruler; he, whom they had
cursed in the past when he had cornered the people's bread. They
speculated as to the personality of his heirs, and to what use they
would put the vast hoards bequeathed to them. Some rumour of the
peculiar will had filtered through to the newspapers, and they
speculated as to what action the heirs would take--if such a will
would result in a long, costly, and sensational legal war. They had
no part or lot in the millions Ezra Gleed had bequeathed, but gold
was a lure that they could not withstand. Even in the hands of
others they felt its deadly fascination; a fascination that breeds
only envy and crime.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter II.</h2>

<p>Matthew Smeardon took possession of the house in Pontin Square.
In the many interviews he had with Mr. Waverill, while they were
sorting and docketing the dead man's papers he had fished
assiduously for the addresses of the heirs. Ezra Gleed had not
trusted him, and all he knew of the heirs was the brief description
in the will. Only the dead man and the lawyer knew where to find
these heirs. The letters Gleed had signed on his deathbed had been
to them, but no questioning on Smeardon's part could exact any
information from the lawyer.</p>

<p>Smeardon had hated, and still hated, Ezra Gleed. He had known
that Gleed had never trusted him, that he had been retained in his
employment, because, in the first instance, of his
untrustworthiness. The old financier had found a sardonic pleasure
in watching and circumventing the intrigues of his secretary. He
had at times even used the dishonesty of the man to serve his ends.
Yet in the matter of the will Smeardon felt that Gleed had had a
more serious project in mind than simply to taunt him with his
impotency. The financier had guessed that Smeardon would seek to
betray his trust, if it were possible to do so to his advantage.
Even row Smeardon was fumbling in the dark of his mind to find a
way whereby he could obtain a further part of the Gleed millions.
Yet knowing all this, Gleed had placed him in this position of
trust. To what end Smeardon could not guess.</p>

<p>Smeardon was fixedly determined that no part of the Gleed
millions should pass to either of the heirs, without paying toll to
him. What was a paltry ten thousand pounds besides the many
millions Gleed had possessed? Smeardon coveted riches, not for what
the money could bring, but for the sake of the yellow gold itself.
He wanted to feel the gold trickle through his fingers, piece by
piece. He wanted to play with it, to watch the light glance on the
surface of each sovereign as he piled it on its fellow. What did it
matter that, with these millions, the luxury of the world could be
bought; that love and power were purchasable--at a price? It was
the gold itself that counted, the beautiful shining gold.</p>

<p>More than once in the days past he had dreaded to turn for fear
of the old financier's eyes on him. Smeardon had acquired a habit
of taking the money from the safe to trickle the gold coins through
his fingers, gloating on their beauty. More than once the old
financier had left large sums about merely to see the greed light
in his secretary's eyes. Smeardon remembered with a shudder one
occasion when the old man had stood for some time watching him play
with a heap of gold. Gleed had taunted him with his miser heart,
then, with a change of mood, had tried to teach him the true value
of money--to show him how its possession only counted for what
power and authority it brought. But Smeardon could not follow the
old man's reasoning. It was the gold only that counted, the velvet
feel of its surface as it trickled between his fingers.</p>

<p>At last the lawyer left him in solitary possession of the house,
and Smeardon commenced a search for some indication of the
whereabouts of Olga Pellet, and Claude Merrivale. All he had was
their names and the fact that Olga Pellet lived in the United
States. Bat the search was useless; the old financier had covered
up the tracks too carefully. Smeardon prosecuted the search with
all his vigour. The phantoms of his brain tortured him. From
somewhere out of the world's spaces would come a man and a woman.
About him they would fight for the Gleed millions and he would be
helpless. He was to be but a puppet. At a given date and time a
woman would step before him and demand from him his trust and he
would be powerless to refuse her. It was maddening. Who was this
woman? Why, he might even pass her in the streets and not know her.
And then, one day she would stand before him, her hand outstretched
for his gold.</p>

<p>Many weary hours the agent spent bent over the directories of
the great cities searching for the name of this girl. He had
decided after some consideration that it would be easier to deal
with her. Women are fools in business. It would be easy to frighten
her with tales of this Claude Merrivale and then she would pay,
pay, pay. Aye, he would make her pay, and pay heavily, for the
fortune he held for Ezra Gleed's heir.</p>

<p>It was easy to plan, but first he had to find the girl and his
search had been resultless. Finally, he had placed the matter in
the hands of a detective agency. They asked a high price for their
work, and Smeardon writhed as he agreed to their terms, but it was
the only thing to do. Then he sat in his master's chair and watched
the telephone throughout the days.</p>

<p>Ezra Gleed had been dead nearly three weeks, and in that time
Smeardon had accomplished nothing towards his desires. He sat at
the old financier's desk as he had sat day by day for the past
fortnight, waiting--watching. He looked a poor, wizened little man
dressed in a shabby frock coat bespattered with grease spots. His
turned down collar was held together by a narrow, rusty band of
black ribbon. His face was thin with a high, narrow forehead
surmounting sunken cheeks. The eyes were light in colour, framed by
light wisps of eyebrows, and showing nearly yellow in the direct
light, and set close together. The forehead receded and extended
back over the crown of his head to a thin wisp of dirty grey hair
that straggled over the collar of his coat.</p>

<p>Presently he picked up the telephone and called a number. He
could wait no longer. The detectives had promised the addresses
within a week. That time had long passed and they must now fulfil
their promise. They were only delaying that they might charge him
more. Oh, he knew them, and their ways.</p>

<p>"Smeardon speaking. Have you those addresses
yet?--Hullo--yes--Mr. Claude Wilton Merrivale--yes--9 Pump Inn,
Strand--yes--don't know Miss Pellet's--will find out--yes--you said
that before--eh--well, hurry up with it--yes." He hung up the
receiver with a bang.</p>

<p>"Silly fools! Can only find out what I could have found out for
myself. Where on earth is that girl?"</p>

<p>Smeardon sat back in his chair and considered. One string of the
twain was in his hands. He could go to this Merrivale and try and
make terms with him. Would it be wise? The man might decide to
fight, yet to a great extent he was in his hands. If he, Smeardon,
made the conditions easy for the girl, Merrivale would only get the
ten thousand pounds left to him in the will. On the other hand if
he, Smeardon, chose to help Merrivale the latter would inherit the
millions. Yes, it might be wise to see Merrivale. See him and then
he could judge what was best to be done. Passing into the hall
Smeardon took down his hat and snapped the street door behind him.
He had discharged the servants directly the lawyers had finished at
the house. They were an unnecessary expense, and he could easily
find a means to place their wages in his pocket, besides, all
servants had enormous appetites. The door stuck, and he jerked it
shut.</p>

<p>It was early, in the afternoon, and arriving at the corner he
hesitated. Should he take a bus? No, he would walk, it would be
another penny saved. Crossing to the sunny side of the road he
shambled citywards. As he shuffled on, many passers by turned to
look at the shabby little bent figure so conspicuous in the
well-dressed crowd; but Smeardon looked neither to the right or
left.</p>

<p>Outside Charing Cross Post Office a man turned sharply as
Smeardon passed him, and then followed, keeping a safe distance in
the rear. When Smeardon came within sight of St. Clement Dane's
church he stopped and looked up at the clock. It was early, and the
day was hot. He turned into a tea-shop.</p>

<p>The shadower sauntered up and, entering, seated himself opposite
Smeardon at the marble topped table.</p>

<p>"Well, Matt?" said the shadower quietly.</p>

<p>Smeardon looked up quickly. The cup he was raising to his lips
swayed, and the contents spilt on his trousers.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Smeardon asked fearfully.</p>

<p>"I don't think your eyesight is failing yet, Matt. Look again
and you will recognise me."</p>

<p>"I don't know you. I don't want to know you," stuttered
Smeardon, wildly.</p>

<p>"You don't know me," echoed the man, with a quiet laugh. "But I
know you, and perhaps some of the gentry on the big house on the
Embankment would be glad to share my knowledge. I know you, Matthew
Smeardon."</p>

<p>Smeardon Smeardon put down his cup, unsteadily.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know," replied the man lounging back in his
chair. "What have you to offer, Matthew."</p>

<p>"I've given it up, Tiger. I've given it up for the past four
years now, Tiger. On my honour, I have."</p>

<p>"So you recognise me, at last."</p>

<p>"Its my eyes, Tiger. When I looked at you the second time, of
course I recognised you."</p>

<p>"Stop the 'Tiger.' I'm Mr. Trantor to you, you cur. What game
are you playing now?"</p>

<p>"No game, Tiger--I'm sorry, Mr. Trantor. I've given it all up,
gave it up and turned honest. I've--"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" The man leaned forward and his hand closed on
Smeardon's as it lay on the table. "So you remember it is four
years since we met."</p>

<p>"Four years come next July, Mr. Trantor," answered Smeardon,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Four years come next July," repeated the Tiger meditatively.
"And Tom Britton went up for a five year stretch. He should be out
soon. You see the point of the joke, don't you, Matthew
Smeardon."</p>

<p>"I hadn't anything to do with that, Mr. Trantor, I swear I
hadn't." "Who said you had?" exclaimed the Tiger viciously. "If you
remember so much Matthew Smeardon you will of course remember the
gang--and the rules."</p>

<p>Smeardon shook as if with ague.</p>

<p>"I'll have to be going now," he muttered indistinctly. He groped
his way to the door, and was reminded by the cashier to pay for his
meal. The Tiger followed him out on to the pavement.</p>

<p>"Which way are you going, Matt?"</p>

<p>"You are not coming with me?"</p>

<p>The Tiger laughed quietly again.</p>

<p>"You don't look well, Matt. I'll come along and take care of
you. Besides, you have not yet told me where I can find you--when I
want you."</p>

<p>Smeardon turned and shambled across the road into the Temple
with the Tiger strolling easily beside him. In Fountain Court
Smeardon again stopped.</p>

<p>"I've to call on a friend here," he said.</p>

<p>"A legal friend!" commented the Tiger. "Come Matt, I've no time
to waste. Where do you live now."</p>

<p>Smeardon searched his pockets and pulled out a dirty envelope
which he passed to the Tiger.</p>

<p>"Come in the dark, Tiger," he whined. "I'm respectable now.
Quite the gentleman. Quite a gentleman."</p>

<p>The Tiger read the address at a glance.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said as he placed the envelope carefully in
his pocket. "I knew where to find you, but wished to know if you
dared double-cross me again."</p>

<p>He turned on his heel as he spoke and left Smeardon without
further word. The man stood and looked after him, fear, abject
fear, on his face.</p>

<p>"I knew he'd turn up again one day," he muttered as he entered
Pump Court. "I knew he'd turn up again. God help me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter III.</h2>

<p>At the door of 9 Pump Court Matthew Smeardon stopped and peered
at the list of occupants. Satisfied that Claude Merrivale lived
there he slowly mounted the stairs until he stood outside a door on
the second floor, on which Merrivale's name was printed in large
white letters. He knocked. Then, after a few minutes' wait, he bent
and applied his eye to the key hole. Just as he settled into
position the door was flung open and a young man appeared.</p>

<p>"Well, my inquisitive friend?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Claude Wilton Merrivale?" asked Smeardon, slowly regaining
an upright position.</p>

<p>"That is my name. You're not a client?"</p>

<p>Smeardon hastened to assure his questioner that he was not
seeking legal-advice.</p>

<p>"That's a pity," commented Merrivale placidly. "I've had some,
surprises to-day, and a client would have rounded off matters
nicely. If you're not a client, are you an editor?"</p>

<p>Smeardon declaimed any connection with the press. Merrivale
looked sad and stepped to one side.</p>

<p>"Come in," he said sadly. "You've caught me this time. Whose
process is it?"</p>

<p>Smeardon showed his puzzlement in his face.</p>

<p>"Where's your papers," asked Merrivale impatiently.</p>

<p>"What papers?"</p>

<p>"The execution, man. Hurry up."</p>

<p>"What execution," asked Smeardon backing towards the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Then you're not distraining on my few poor belongings," asked
Merrivale. He leaned forward and caught Smeardon by the arm.
"You're not a client; you're not an editor; you're not a process
server. Who the devil are you?"</p>

<p>"If you are Mr. Claude Wilton Merrivale," said Smeardon
advancing into the room, "I want a few words with you."</p>

<p>"That's cheaper than money," observed Merrivale. "Sit down. I
will give you ten minutes. If you want more you can have it. The
time of a briefless barrister is worth more to others than it is to
himself."</p>

<p>Smeardon seated himself in the least dilapidated chair he could
find and looked at his host. He saw before him a lean, tall young
man about twenty-five years of age, with a mop of shaggy hair
surmounting a broad forehead. Rather heavy eyebrows framed, and
partly hid, a pair of keen blue eyes. The nose was large, but well
shaped and the mouth had a singularly winning expression. He was
clad in a shabby blue lounge suit, except for the jacket, which had
been replaced by a velvet smoking coat of some nondescript colour.
From the man, Smeardon's eyes wandered to the room. It was untidy
in the extreme. The furniture was poor, and almost every article
had to rely on supplementary support. The few chairs were covered
with a multitude of books, most of them in an advanced state of
decay. Over all was a thick covering of dust.</p>

<p>"Quite an artistic apartment," observed Merrivale, following his
visitor's glance.</p>

<p>"You are Claude Wilton Merrivale," asked Smeardon again.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," expostulated Merrivale, "if I were not the
person you ask for, do you think I would have enticed you into this
abode of luxury. Yes, I am Claude Wilton Merrivale. My god-parents
had no respect for the proprieties."</p>

<p>"You have heard of your uncle's death?"</p>

<p>"Uncle!"</p>

<p>"The late Mr. Ezra Gleed."</p>

<p>"Gleed!" exclaimed Merrivale, jumping up. "By Jove, I remember
he was my uncle. Thought so when I read the name in the papers. Why
the devil didn't you come and tell me this before. I might have got
the write-up for the <i>Moon.</i> It's a clean couple of quid out
of my pocket through your carelessness. 'The Life of an Uncle' by
his loving Nephew. You know I'm inclined to book that couple of
yellow boys up against you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleed remembered you in his will," continued Smeardon.</p>

<p>"He did? Awfully good of him. That reminds me," Merrivale
searched the papers on his desk and drew out a legal looking
envelope. "I was wondering which of my creditors this was
from."</p>

<p>Smeardon took the envelope from Merrivale.</p>

<p>"Waverill, Waverill &amp; Waverill," he read. "That is the name
of your late uncle's solicitors."</p>

<p>"The name's nothing," observed Merrivale blandly, "most of my
correspondence now consists of love letters from the legal
representatives of my creditors. Kind of setting one devil to fight
another."</p>

<p>"As you have not yet opened the letter, suppose you leave it for
the present, Mr. Merrivale," suggested Smeardon. "If you will
listen to me I can tell you all that is there, and perhaps
more."</p>

<p>"Right-o," assented Merrivale, dropping the letter on the desk
and tilting his chair back. "Mind smoking?"</p>

<p>He reached to the mantelpiece and took down a foul looking
pipe.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ezra Gleed died about three weeks ago," commenced
Smeardon.</p>

<p>"Poor devil," commented Merrivale through a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"After leaving certain legacies to his servants he bequeathed
the sum of ten thousand pounds to you."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand uncles," exclaimed Merrivale leaping from his
chair, "And I sitting here staring at an envelope containing such
news and wondering which of my creditors was being unkind."</p>

<p>"He left the bulk of his fortune, amounting to several millions,
to your cousin, Miss Olga Mary Pellet, on certain conditions."</p>

<p>"Lucky girl!" commented Merrivale. "But he left me ten thousand
of the best."</p>

<p>"Those conditions may be made easy--or--difficult," said
Smeardon impressively, leaning forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"Let us hope for the sake of the young lady they will prove to
be easy," drawled Merrivale, puffing out huge clouds of smoke.</p>

<p>"I can make them easy or difficult," emphasised Smeardon. "What
I shall do depends on the result of this conversation."</p>

<p>Merrivale's eyes narrowed quickly and he signed for Smeardon to
continue.</p>

<p>"If I make those conditions difficult, I should say so difficult
that the young lady will be unable to comply with them, you will
inherit the residue of the Gleed fortune."</p>

<p>Merrivale leaned forward in his chair, eyeing his visitor
intently.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm rather dull," he said slowly. "Will you please
speak more plainly."</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleed left you ten thousand pounds unconditionally,"
explained Smeardon. "He left the residue of his fortune, amounting
to many millions, to Miss Pellet on conditions. If she cannot
fulfil those conditions you inherit the estate, unconditionally.
Those conditions are under my control. I can make them so hard that
Miss Pellet will be unable to fulfil them. Then you will
inherit."</p>

<p>"Where do you come in?" queried Merrivale.</p>

<p>"That is for you to say, Mr. Merrivale." Smeardon thought he had
his fish hooked and assumed a more confident air. "Of course I
shall expect a good bit for my services. I don't know Miss
Pellet."</p>

<p>"You don't know me," retorted Merrivale, pulling hard at his
pipe.</p>

<p>"I have heard of you as a clever and rising young lawyer," lied
Smeardon glibly. "I preferred to approach you in the first
place."</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Pellet?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Smeardon. Then, realising his mistake,
he added quickly, "I can soon find out."</p>

<p>"That's the reason you came to me," snapped Merrivale. "Look
here, Mr. What's-your-name, I've given you a good innings. I told
you that you didn't know me. You don't, and you wouldn't take the
hint. You thought I was one of your own dirty kidney. Well I'm not.
I may not be much of a chap but I'd get out of this decent world
quick and sharp if I was the mean, despicable, sneaking, rotten cur
you are. Get out of my chambers quick, you beast. I can't breathe
the same air with you."</p>

<p>Smeardon got out of his chair hurriedly as Merrivale strode to
the door and flung it open. Keeping the desk between himself and
Merrivale, he attempted to parley.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merrivale! You misunderstand me. Let me speak. I assure you
I am only acting in your best interests."</p>

<p>Merrivale left the door and came to the desk. Smeardon dodged to
the opposite side.</p>

<p>"I told you to get out!" Merrivale exclaimed, his face white
with anger. "By the Lord, if I lay hands on you I'll break your
dirty neck. Will you go?"</p>

<p>He moved round the table to Smeardon and the latter dodged so as
to keep the table between them. At last Smeardon found the door
behind him and darted through.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merrivale!" he exclaimed, his head round the lintel. "I
came to do you a service, and this is how you receive me. Look to
yourself. The Gleed millions shall never be yours."</p>

<p>He withdrew his head just in time. Merrivale, in a couple of
strides had reached the door and flung it shut.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he exclaimed, crossing to the window and flinging it
open. "I must have some fresh air to get rid of the smell of that
hound."</p>

<p>Below, in the court, he could see Smeardon's stunted figure
gazing up at the window. As he looked, the old man raised his arm
in a threatening gesture and hurried out of the court. For some
minutes Merrivale stood thinking of the late interview. Then he
crossed to the table and picked up the lawyer's letter. He read it
through carefully and placed it in a drawer.</p>

<p>"Don't look as if I'll get anything out of the Gleed millions
beyond my ten thousand," he commented under his breath. "Wonder why
the old man made such a will. Anyhow it doesn't concern me."</p>

<p>In that statement, Claude Merrivale made one of his few
mistakes. The matter of the Gleed millions was to cost him many
sleepless nights. The shadow of the Nine Stars hung over his head
and the head of a young girl hurrying across the Atlantic to a
promised golden future.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter IV.</h2>

<p>The following morning Claude Merrivale called on Messrs Waverill
Waverill and Waverill. They had requested an early interview and it
is not policy for an impecunious banister to keep an important firm
of solicitors waiting; Waverill Waverill and Waverill, the sole
remaining partner being William Waverill, were solicitors of
repute.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Waverill had reached his office only a few minutes
before Claude was announced and, contrary to the accepted practice
of the learned profession, did hot keep him waiting. The business
of the legacy was quickly settled and Claude was on the point of
departure when the lawyer sat back in his chair with the evident
intention of a chat. Merrivale resumed his seat and for a few
minutes there was silence, the old lawyer scrutinising Claude
closely.</p>

<p>"You had a visit from Mr. Matthew Smeardon, Mr. Merrivale?" the
lawyer asked at length.</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" blurted Claude, involuntary.</p>

<p>"My dear sir," the lawyer was smiling in the most friendly
fashion. "You were not at the deathbed of your esteemed uncle. The
terms on which the late Mr. Gleed and his private secretary parted
compelled the belief in my mind that so soon as Smeardon could
discover your address he would seek an interview with you."</p>

<p>"I threw him out, the dirty skunk," exclaimed Claude, angrily.
"What made you think he would come to me in preference to Miss
Pellet?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason that Miss Pellet is in New York."</p>

<p>"Then it will be some time before she claims her legacy?" said
Claude.</p>

<p>"I have written to her and hope she is now on her way to
England. In fact I should not be surprised to see Miss Pellet in
London any day now. A fortune of seven millions is not left long
unclaimed."</p>

<p>Again there was silence. Claude could see that the lawyer had
something to say and could guess what that "something" was. He
determined to give him no help.</p>

<p>"You did not expect to inherit the bulk of the late Mr. Gleed's
estate?" asked Waverill at length.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yet you are the only male relative of the deceased."</p>

<p>"The will is in Miss Pellet's favour."</p>

<p>"That is so," replied the lawyer, musingly. "Yet with Matthew
Smeardon's help, and I presume he offered you his help, on
conditions, it should be easy for you to step into your cousin's
place."</p>

<p>Merrivale rose from his chair, angrily.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Mr. Waverill. I am not likely to enter
into any compact with that scoundrel."</p>

<p>"Sit down, my boy," said the lawyer kindly. "I did not expect
such a thing from you. But I want you on our side, for there is
certain to be a big fight before your cousin is allowed to obtain
her inheritance."</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't trust Smeardon." said the lawyer slowly. "Certainly I
have little reason to distrust him, except the scene at Mr. Gleed's
deathbed and the fact that the man sought you out and made some
proposals to you that appear to be very repugnant. I don't trust
him, however, and with him in charge of the package of the Nine
Stars, Miss Pellet will want all the friends she has if she is to
inherit her fortune."</p>

<p>"Then you anticipate trouble?" asked Claude. "It seems to me
that if I refuse to act with Matthew Smeardon in defrauding Miss
Pellet he is helpless."</p>

<p>"Yet Ezra Gleed anticipated trouble. In fact some little time
before his last illness Mr. Gleed placed in my hands a sum of money
for the purposes of the estate. That was how he put it to me. Now I
see that it is a fund to use in defeating the machinations of this
scoundrel."</p>

<p>"If Mr. Gleed knew Smeardon for a scoundrel, why did he leave
his fortune at the mercy of the man?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>Waverill did not answer directly. He was tapping the desk with
a. knife.</p>

<p>"We will suppose that Mr. Gleed desired his large fortune should
come into the hands of some person who could properly look after
it. Perhaps he desired that the child of his eldest sister should
inherit, irrespective of sex. Let us presume he did not know either
of his relatives personally and, lacking a personal knowledge of
their characters, he desired some guarantee that this enormous
fortune should be administered with care and forethought. He formed
his plans with the foresight that had won him his place among the
financial kings of the world. Of course, you understand I am simply
trying to construct a theory of what was in my client's mind when
he was framing his will. I have no certain knowledge."</p>

<p>"It sounds reasonable." assented Claude.</p>

<p>"Let us presume he formed a plan by which his fortune should be
worthily inherited. He may have argued that a fortune, lightly won,
might be as lightly squandered. He had made his choice between his
relations, but he desired to make that relation earn the fortune.
He had a weapon to his hand. There is no doubt but that Ezra Gleed
had a thorough knowledge of the character of Matthew Smeardon. He
knew him to be a scoundrel. He then planned that he would place the
fortune so much under the control of this scoundrel that it would
need much forethought and work for his heir to obtain possession.
Thus it would result that if his first choice, the daughter of his
elder sister, failed in the test the fortune would fall into the
hands of an heir who, by his training, should have some capability
to take care of it."</p>

<p>"You do not lake into consideration the package of the Nine
Stars," objected Claude.</p>

<p>"There I am at fault, altogether," replied the lawyer promptly.
"Ezra Gleed was a close man. He confided in me little beyond the
routine legal work. The package may be a blind. On the other hand,
it may be of the utmost importance. So far, I have not been able to
discover if any securities are missing. Personally, I should not be
surprised to find that the package of the Nine Stars is but a dummy
and therefore of no importance to the estate."</p>

<p>"Suppose I had accepted Smeardon's offer of service and tried to
defraud my cousin?"</p>

<p>"I have not overlooked that point," replied the lawyer quickly.
"I believe that Mr. Gleed had some fair knowledge of your character
and deliberately placed this temptation in your way. No. I believe
that the dead man was convinced you would assist your cousin to the
utmost."</p>

<p>"You believe then, that Mr. Gleed made some enquiries about
me?"</p>

<p>"It is more than probable."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he had in his mind conditions not stated in the
will."</p>

<p>Claude thought for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gleed thought I would help my cousin, even against my own
interests. To help her I must meet her. Then the unnamed conditions
you have in your mind--the conditions you say Mr. Gleed did not
state in the will--why--" Claude sprang to his feet, his face
aflame. "You mean my uncle was trying his hand in the matrimonial
market."</p>

<p>The lawyer laughed. "That is my reading of the situation."</p>

<p>"It's absurd," exclaimed Claude wrathfully. "I'm to marry a girl
I have never seen?"</p>

<p>"If you are to help her you will have to meet her."</p>

<p>"Then I'll not meet her."</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said the lawyer, firmly, though still laughing at
Claude's discomfiture. "Marriage to a nice girl should not be so
distasteful to you. May I ask if your affections are already
engaged."</p>

<p>"What girl is likely to look twice at an impecunious barrister?"
said Claude bitterly. "No. I've not yet met the right girl, and the
right girl is not likely to be Olga Mary Pellet."</p>

<p>"Yet, in fear that she may prove to be the 'right girl,' as you
phrase it, you refuse to help Miss Pellet to protect her fortune
against a scoundrel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn," exclaimed Claude. "You are getting, me into a
corner. There is no danger of that."</p>

<p>"The danger appears to be to your peace of mind," the lawyer
laughingly replied. "I'm afraid I have destroyed that entirely but,
regarding Miss Pellet's fortune, no. We shall have to watch
carefully, however. Smeardon did not come to you by chance. He has
some plan in his head."</p>

<p>"I'm going to think this out," said Claude, rising, and holding
out his hand. "Uncle Gleed has placed me in a queer position, and
you have made it worse by your theories and conjectures. Let us
hope Smeardon will do the right thing after all."</p>

<p>"Let us hope he will," agreed the lawyer. "Still I will make a
sporting bet of a box of cigars that we have trouble with the old
rogue."</p>

<p>"It's all supposition," insisted Claude. "Yes, I'll take your
bet, for I believe the whole' of the trouble lies in your
imagination. Still, if there is trouble, let me have one good smack
at that scoundrel, Smeardon. I owe him one."</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied the lawyer, laconically. "I'll certainly send
for you if there is any necessity."</p>

<p>Claude left Waverill's office in a maze of perplexity. Only one
thing was clear to his mind, and that was that within a few days he
would have a substantial balance at the bank. The theories and
suggestions of the lawyer he could not bring into line with the
everyday world around him. Melodrama had long ceased to exist
except on the stage. Men did not go about these days seeking
heiresses to defraud. Waverill had spoken as if there was a web of
conspiracy being gradually woven around the fortune of Ezra Gleed.
It was absurd. The lawyer was imagining a plot worthy of the most
lurid of fiction writers.</p>

<p>The events of the past few, hours had made Claude disinclined
for work, not that he had any of real importance at his chambers.
He turned into High Holborn and walked slowly along towards the
city. When worried, he loved to stroll aimlessly about the streets
of the great metropolis. As he was crossing Holborn Circus someone
bumped roughly into him. At the same moment a voice, sharp and
shrill, struck on his ears. It was a voice that was familiar to
him. Turning quickly he saw Matthew Smeardon passing in the
apposite direction. As he looked after him, the man accompanying
Smeardon looked back, and Claude saw his face. For a moment they
looked into each other's eyes and then the man turned his head. For
some moments Claude stood puzzled. Where had he seen the man
before? Then a picture rose in his mind of a trial at the Old
Bailey. A man stood in the dock charged with an accumulation of
crimes. He was said to be the head of a gang of criminals, a gang
that had long defied all the efforts of the police of the world. He
stood in the dock, calm and confident, while the lawyers fought
over him. He looked like a gentleman, but there was a narrowness of
the eyes, a curl of the nostrils, a calculating, secretive
expression that tokened a rogue. Then the verdict, an acquittal.
Again Claude could see the half ironical, half contemptuous bow
with which the man accepted his dismissal, to freedom.</p>

<p>"Tiger Trantor!" exclaimed Claude, under his breath. "Tiger
Trantor and Matthew Smeardon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter V.</h2>

<p>Smeardon was not really surprised at the rebuff he received from
Claude Merrivale. His visit, he afterwards realised, was a hasty,
unconsidered act, taken from an impulse to make some move towards
the Gleed millions which he coveted. He had known it was more
difficult to deal with a man than a woman, and that, if Merrivale
had accepted his offer, he would have had to wait at least twelve
months, before they could divide the plunder. It would have been a
period of great strain, for he would have to block Olga Pellet's
attempts to obtain her inheritance. Then, again, there would have
been the lawyer to reckon with. Smeardon had no illusions about Mr.
Waverill. The lawyer would have caused infinite trouble and have
been a constant menace, if not a certain danger.</p>

<p>Smeardon reflected that it was well Merrivale had refused his
offer. He would get in touch with Olga Pellet one day, and then he
would have a much easier person to deal with. Women are always
fools in business, and easily frightened. The amount of the money
at stake would daunt her. She would be nervous of so great a
fortune, she would fear to lose it, and her fears would be his
opportunity. He would fill her with tales of Merrivale; how the
barrister had tried to corrupt his honesty. He would tell of the
large bribes Merrivale had offered. Surely then she would be
grateful, and her gratitude would take a substantial form.</p>

<p>Of late he had vaguely dreamed of plans that promised a far
richer harvest. Nothing definite as yet, nothing that he could take
hold of, but there were possibilities that almost frightened him.
Why should Olga Pellet, or Claude Merrivale, ever touch a penny of
the Gleed millions? Why should not he, Matthew Smeardon, take all!
All!</p>

<p>When he met Tiger Trantor on his way to Merrivale's chambers, he
had thought his plans were doomed to failure, but succeeding days
spent in the company of the master crook, had opened new visions of
possibilities. The Tiger had wormed his secret out of him and then
suggested that they should work together to appropriate the Gleed
millions. He had not been able to refuse. At first he had given a
grudging assent, but after reflection he had viewed the situation
in a new light. The Tiger had, at his command, men and women who
would be invaluable in the delicate work before them. Smeardon
realised that, with the help of the Tiger, his schemes would become
certainties--but he would have to divide the plunder, and the Tiger
would not be satisfied with less than the lion's share. His
instincts revolted at that. Could he defraud the Tiger and the
gang. His position was strong. Only through him could the Gleed
millions be diverted from the rightful heirs. He held the power.
Without him, the Tiger was helpless. Then, could he not take the
lot, even from under the claws of the Tiger. He thought he
could.</p>

<p>The Tiger was a dangerous man to cross. Well, Smeardon knew
that. In the past he had worked with the Tiger's gang; once he had
nearly suffered for him. Even after five years he shuddered at the
thought of his narrow escape. He had saved himself, but at a
cost--the betrayal of a comrade. The Tiger had reminded him of this
casually, but with intent. For the moment he had thought that the
Tiger knew he had been the traitor, but he had dismissed the
suspicion. Had the Tiger known, retribution swift and sure, would
have descended. The Tiger never forgave.</p>

<p>Smeardon was certain that the Tiger suspected him. Why had he
spoken of Tom Britton if he had not? Tom Britton had suffered in
his and the Tiger's place, and it had been his, Smeardon's,
information that had placed him in jail. It had been his
information that had placed the Tiger in the dock. If the Tiger
knew that!</p>

<p>Alternating between greed and doubt, Smeardon took the Tiger
fully into his confidence. Day by day they reviewed the life of
Ezra Gleed--all that Smeardon knew of it and had gathered of
late--looking for a clue to the mystery that the old financier had
woven on his deathbed, around the package of the Nine Stars. What
did the package hold? The Tiger believed it held the securities of
the estate, and urged Smeardon to open it. Smeardon resisted; he
had a superstitious dislike to tampering with the package and so
far he had refused to even show it. Later, perhaps, when their
plans were more fully formed, it might be necessary to deal with
the package, but until then he was determined that it should not be
touched.</p>

<p>Nearly a month had passed since Ezra Gleed died and nothing had
been heard of Olga Pellet. The delay troubled Smeardon. He wanted
the girl so that he could deal with her. Why had she not come to
claim her inheritance? Supposing she did not come--if Olga Pellet
was dead--if something happened that she was not able to claim the
package. What then? The estate would go to Merrivale, who had
driven him out of his chambers with loathing and contempt. Never
that.</p>

<p>If Olga Pellet never came to claim her inheritance, would it be
possible to claim it in her name? Could the Tiger find a girl to
play her part; a girl who could pose as the real Olga Pellet and
deceive the lawyer. Smeardon knew the wonderful resources of the
gang, its agencies all over the world, its spies and agents, in the
most unlooked for places. It was a tempting idea. Could it be
worked?</p>

<p>By the time Smeardon and the Tiger met again, the former had the
scheme well thought out. The Tiger listened in silence and then,
after some discussion, gave it his approval. It might be worked. He
knew a girl who might play the part. The only trouble would be if
the real Olga Pellet happened on the scene after their dummy had
put in her claim, but that was a minor point. The real Olga Pellet
could be easily dealt with, if she came to light; dealt with
silently and effectively. The Tiger had promised to find a girl and
bring her along.</p>

<p>This was some days ago and the Tiger had not yet fulfilled his
promise. Smeardon sat in the study of the old house in Pontin
Square and waited. He was alone in the house for he had long since
discharged the servants. The house was shut up and deserted, except
for the study where Smeardon sat and the small back bedroom he had
always occupied. In the study he spent his days hoarding the
sovereigns paid out to him by the lawyer for the upkeep of the
house. In the study he spent the day and most of the night, for he
could not sleep. Daily he searched the study, examining books,
peering about, he knew not for what. Some sense told him that there
the old financier had hidden something. What it was he could not
tell. Yet he sought--and hoped.</p>

<p>It was early one evening and Smeardon had just cleared away the
remains of his meagre repast when the door ball rang. Shambling to
the front door he opened it on the chain and peered out. The Tiger
and a young girl were standing on the steps. At the command of the
Tiger he took down the chain and opened the door.</p>

<p>"Well, Matt," said the Tiger pushing Smeardon to the wall as he
passed into the house. "Suppose you thought I was never coming to
see you again. Come in, Polly. That's Matthew Smeardon, once one of
us. Now turned to righteous paths."</p>

<p>Smeardon closed the door and followed his guests to the study.
The Tiger stood just inside the door and, as Smeardon entered,
caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Will she do?" he asked as he switched on all the lights in the
room. "Turn round Polly."</p>

<p>The girl turned obediently. Smeardon saw before him a young girl
of about twenty-one or twenty-two, with an abundance of tawny hair
piled high on her head. The face was small, with bright twinkling
eyes and a turned-up nose, the mouth wide and hard--yet she was not
ugly. More, she had a certain prettiness about her, tainted by an
air of bravado that marked the woman of the criminal class. Her
clothes were neat, but had an air of ultra-fashionableness. She
stood with her arms hanging loosely to her side, meeting Smeardon's
scrutiny with an air hall defiant, half indifferent.</p>

<p>"Will, will she do?" asked the Tiger again.</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>The Tiger laughed and bowed in a ceremonious manner.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce you people. Miss Pellet let me make you known
to your late uncle's secretary, Mr. Matthew Smeardon."</p>

<p>Smeardon clutched the Tiger's arm.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he cried hoarsely. "Whom have you brought
here?"</p>

<p>The Tiger shook him off roughly and, crossing to the
mantelpiece, lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"You will have to look to those nerves of yours, Matt," he
drawled. "If this young lady is not the real and only Olga Pellet I
suppose she will do--as a makeshift."</p>

<p>The girl had watched the two men with a certain air of
amusement. When Smeardon approached her and peered into her face
she drew back with a slight gesture of repulsion.</p>

<p>"Well, can't you speak?" she asked harshly. "Will I do for the
part?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Smeardon again.</p>

<p>"What does that matter," angrily interjected the Tiger. "To you
she is Olga Mary Pellet, of New York, the niece of the late Ezra
Gleed. That's her name from now on and the sooner she forgets she
ever had another the better for her and you."</p>

<p>"You know what yon have to do?" asked Smeardon of the girl,
after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>"She knows nothing except that she is to impersonate an American
girl, Olga Mary Pellet. Come and sit down both of you."</p>

<p>The girl obeyed the Tiger's command without a word. After a
moment's hesitation Smeardon drew a chair to the desk and sat
down.</p>

<p>"Tell the tale Matt," said the Tiger shortly. "All you know and
all the details you can remember."</p>

<p>The old secretary leaned his arms on the desk and looked at his
confederates for some minutes in silence, Then, slowly and with
much hesitation, he commenced the history of Ezra Gleed's life. As
he proceeded, he became more fluent, until at the death of the
financier the Tiger interrupted.</p>

<p>"This is where I come in."</p>

<p>Smeardon turned to him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, yon may look," said the Tiger with a queer laugh. "Did you
think I had been idle since you first mentioned this stunt? Not so.
I put the wires to work and, mark me, they have burned to some
tune. Now I'll talk."</p>

<p>He talked well. In swift, well-chosen words, he sketched the
history of Olga Mary Pellet and her family in the United States.
Smeardon sat astonished. The rogue had worked to good effect and in
the short time at his disposal had gathered in all the essential
details. When he had finished, he drew some papers from his
pocket.</p>

<p>"These are the necessary papers to establish your identity," he
said, passing them to the girl. "They're good, although perhaps
they are not quite original."</p>

<p>"Where did you get them from?" exclaimed Smeardon.</p>

<p>"What's that to you?" snapped the Tiger, angrily. "Do you know
so little of the gang that you act like a loony. Some of them, a
clever pen-man, like you, could have done just as well, if I had
chosen. Now, Polly, we'll see what you know."</p>

<p>For the next hour the two men questioned and cross-questioned
the girl until they were certain she was letter perfect in her
part.</p>

<p>"You'll do," decided the Tiger at last.</p>

<p>"What's this about the Nine Stars?" asked the girl, who had been
bending over a copy of the will spread on the desk. "I mean what
are the Nine Stars?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be here now, dearie," said Smeardon, leering at
the girl, "if I could tell you the meaning of the Nine Stars."</p>

<p>"Bring out the packet, Matt," commanded the Tiger, impatiently.
"You never show it."</p>

<p>Smeardon hesitated a moment and then went to one of the
bookcases and pressed a concealed spring. Part of the case swung to
one side, revealing the door of a small safe. He worked the
combination slowly and swung the door open. In the safe lay a large
envelope. He took it out and laid it on the desk. It was a bulky
package, addressed in Ezra Gleed's handwriting, to Miss Olga Mary
Pellet, and under the inscription were the following
instructions:</p>

<p class="newspaper">This envelope, addressed to my niece Olga Mary
Pellet, is to be handed to her intact. In the event of it being
opened by any other person than the said Olga Mary Pellet, in the
presence of my executor, Edward William Waverill, my secretary
Matthew Smeardon is to be considered to have forfeited his
trust.</p>

<p>On the flap of the envelope was a large seal impressed with the
mark of Nine Stars. They were arranged in two rows, the top row
consisting of four stars and the bottom of five stars. The two men
and the girl bent over the package as it lay on the table.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what is inside that package," said the Tiger,
slowly. "It might make all the difference to us."</p>

<p>Smeardon placed his hand over the package.</p>

<p>"No tricks, Tiger." he muttered. "We shall know soon enough and
that package moans ten thousand pounds to me, even if our plans
fail."</p>

<p>He took the packet from the table as he spoke and restored it to
the safe. The Tiger rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"Time we were going, Polly," he said quietly. "Let us have a
drink first, Matt."</p>

<p>Smeardon produced the liquor and they drank in silence. Then he
escorted them to the front door.</p>

<p>"When is the stage set for?" asked Tiger, as he stood on the
steps.</p>

<p>"The night of the full moon."</p>

<p>The girl raised her hand and pointed to the sky. There, among
the stars, in a sky unmarred by a single cloud, floated the
completed circle of the silver moon. One glance and the Tiger
turned to Smeardon with anger in his face.</p>

<p>"You fool, Smeardon," he exclaimed. "Get an almanac! We've
nearly missed the bus this time."</p>

<p>They followed Smeardon into the library and the Tiger tore at
the "Whitaker."</p>

<p>"Tonight!" he exclaimed hoarsely. "Quick Polly! Demand the
package from him."</p>

<p>The girl stared from one to the other of the men for a moment in
astonishment. Then, on the Tiger reiterating his command, she
grasped the situation. Turning to Smeardon, she drew herself up to
her full height.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smeardon. I am Olga Mary Pellet. I require from you the
package of the Nine Stars left in your charge by my uncle, the late
Mr. Ezra Gleed."</p>

<p>Smeardon had been slow in grasping the situation and stood,
staring, at the girl. The Tiger took him by the shoulders and
forced him to the safe. As Smeardon touched the spring that worked
the bookcase, the door behind the trio opened.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon." The man who had just entered the room
spoke. "This lady is not entitled to receive the package of the
Nine Stars."</p>

<p>The three rogues turned quickly. Smeardon took a step
forward.</p>

<p>"Merrivale!" he exclaimed. "Claude Merrivale!"</p>

<p>"Just so." said Claude with a smile. "It is very regrettable,
but Miss Pellet cannot receive the package of the Nine Stars while
I am on the premises."</p>

<p>"Damn you!" exclaimed the Tiger, springing forward. "Then I'll
remove you.</p>

<p>"I think not." answered Claude quietly. "Listen!"</p>

<p>From a nearby clock floated the chimes of the hour.</p>

<p>One by one the four persons in the room counted the strokes of
the bell until, at nine, the clock ceased to strike. At the last
stroke Merrivale stepped back and closed the door behind him. The
night of the first new moon had passed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter VI.</h2>

<p>The next day Claude telephoned to Waverill but found the lawyer
was out of town and would not be back for some days. The delay was
annoying, for after the scene at the house in Pontin Square on the
night of the full moon, Claude was convinced that Smeardon was up
to mischief. Three days later he received a telephone message from
the lawyer and went round to Holborn Inn immediately. Waverill
listened to his story in silence.</p>

<p>"It was just a chance I was passing the house at the time and
recognised the Tiger in the doorway," concluded Claude. "They
pointed to the moon and then hurried inside the house. I followed
and made a somewhat dramatic entry."</p>

<p>"Lucky for your cousin you did so." observed the lawyer, dryly.
"You are certain this lady is a fraud?"</p>

<p>"What else can I think? I found her in the company of a man I
know to be one of the leading crooks in the kingdom."</p>

<p>"You are certain of the identity of the Tiger?" insisted the
lawyer. "You could not have been deceived by the poor light?"</p>

<p>"You forget I saw him later in a brilliantly lighted room,"
Claude spoke emphatically. "I had previously seen him in daylight,
and since then I have been to Scotland Yard and examined his
photograph. No, I am certain I am not deceived."</p>

<p>"You must remember that the trial at the Old Bailey was the only
time the man was ever brought to justice and even then he was
acquitted. What do the detectives say? Are they convinced the man
is a rogue?"</p>

<p>"The police are certain they made no mistake. The man works
almost entirely behind others and rarely comes out into the open.
Now they have new evidence against him. Not enough, in my opinion,
to convince a jury, but facts are accumulating against him. One day
he will make a mistake and then--" Claude finished the sentence
with an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>"We shall see," replied the lawyer with a smile. "You did right
to interfere, even if you interfered with the heiress. It was her
business to come to me first with her proofs of identity. That she
did not do so strengthens the supposition that she is an
adventuress in league with these rogues. If it is <i>the</i> Miss
Pellet, who was in the house that night, it is unfortunate but
there is no real harm done. She will have to wait another month for
her fortune."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she will call on you now."</p>

<p>A knock at the door. At the lawyer's answer, a clerk entered and
placed a card on the desk.</p>

<p>"Your guess was not a bad one," commented the lawyer, passing
the card over to Claude. "Miss. Pellet is here."</p>

<p>"If she is a confederate of Smeardon and the Tiger, the girl has
nerve," exclaimed Claude, rising. "I suppose you will see her, so I
will be off."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Merrivale," said the lawyer. "You are interested in
this matter, and it might be as well for you to be present and be
introduced to your cousin."</p>

<p>He pressed a button beneath his desk, twice, and a few minutes
later the door opened and the clerk announced "Miss Pellet."</p>

<p>The two men rose to their feet as the girl entered. The lawyer
glanced rapidly at the girl and then at Claude, who nodded slightly
and walked to the window. When the girl was seated opposite the
lawyer, she looked round the room as she drew off her gloves. Her
glance fell on Claude at the window and the lawyer noticed her eyes
widen. Then, after a momentary pause, she rose to her feet and went
across to the window.</p>

<p>"Will you not welcome me home, cousin Claude?" she asked,
holding out her hand. "You would not speak to me last night."</p>

<p>It was a daring bit of effrontery and Claude could not find
words to answer her. He took her hand mechanically.</p>

<p>"Bid me welcome," she commanded with just a suspicion of twang
in her voice.</p>

<p>"I bid you welcome to England, cousin Olga," Claude said
quietly. "I am sorry I could not stop longer last night, but your
escort was not polite."</p>

<p>"He was disappointed, on my account," replied the girl. "You
see, you interrupted at a critical moment. Now I cannot claim my
inheritance for another month."</p>

<p>"I think I have met him before," said Claude bluntly. "His name
is--" he made an appreciable pause.</p>

<p>"Mason--" filled in the girl. "Mr. George Mason. Will you allow
me to apologise for his behaviour."</p>

<p>"Mason! I don't remember that name. When I saw the gentleman
before he was passing under the name of Trantor."</p>

<p>"How funny," the girl laughed, delightedly. "I have never heard
that he had two names. You are sure you are not mistaken?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say." replied Claude. He was beginning to doubt his
memory.</p>

<p>"I have known Mr. Mason for a long lime, in the States,"
continued the girl, "and he has always been Mr. Mason. Perhaps you
are confusing him with someone else."</p>

<p>Claude bowed. If the girl was acting, it was a magnificent
performance.</p>

<p>"Why did you not come and see me before going to Smeardon,"
interrupted the lawyer.</p>

<p>Olga turned to him quickly.</p>

<p>"That was a mistake," she admitted. "But Mr. Mason thought I had
better get the papers before I came to you. After Mr. Merrivale
left us so abruptly last night, I insisted that I should see you at
once, and Mr. Mason agreed. If you had stopped a moment longer,
cousin Claude," the girl added, turning to Merrivale, "you might
have helped us to a decision. You are a lawyer, are you not?"</p>

<p>"We are wasting time," said Waverill briskly. "Sit down Miss
Pellet and tell me why you have come to see me now."</p>

<p>"I hardly know," replied the girl with a laugh. "I suppose it is
necessary that I should prove my identity."</p>

<p>"It is usual," remarked the lawyer, in dry tones. "Have you any
papers?"</p>

<p>The girl took a package from her handbag and passed it across to
the lawyer. Waverill opened it and turned over the contents
quickly. The papers appeared to be in order.</p>

<p>"What ship did you come over in, cousin Olga," asked Claude
suddenly.</p>

<p>"The <i>Danetic,</i> cousin Claude."</p>

<p>Merrivale had hoped a lot from his sudden question, but it was
evident that, if the girl was a fraud, she had been well
tutored.</p>

<p>"I will leave my papers with you, Mr. Waverill," said Olga, as
she rose to go. "You will act for me, will you not?"</p>

<p>The lawyer returned the papers to their envelope.</p>

<p>"I act for the estate, Miss Pellet," he answered briefly. "If
you succeed in the conditions I shall be pleased to act for
you."</p>

<p>"Then I will detain you no longer," said the girl, holding out
her hand to the lawyer.</p>

<p>She turned towards the door, and at the same moment it was
opened by a clerk, who entered without knocking. Something in his
face checked the reprimand that rose to the lawyer's lips. He took,
in silence, the card the clerk held out to him. When he had read it
he glanced sharply at Olga Pellet. She was shaking hands with
Claude.</p>

<p>"Show this person in at once," said the lawyer quietly. Then as
the clerk left the room, "Sit down a moment, Miss Pellet. There is
someone here I should like you to meet."</p>

<p>Almost immediately the door opened and the clerk showed in a
young lady, without any announcement.</p>

<p>"Claude's glance jumped from the girl seated at the desk to the
newcomer. Olga Pellet gave an almost imperceptible start and then
sat back in her chair as if the further proceedings did not
interest her. At a nod from the lawyer, Claude placed a seat for
the newcomer almost beside Olga. The girl went straight to
Merrivale and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"You must be Claude Merrivale," she said in a rather high voice,
with more than a suspicion of the American twang. "I heard in the
outer office you were with Mr. Waverill."</p>

<p>The lawyer's lips came together firmly--it is not wise to talk
too freely in a lawyer's office. The girl noticed the movement and
turned to him with a charming smile.</p>

<p>"You must not blame your clerks, Mr. Waverill," she said
quickly. "I was asking where I could find Mr. Merrivale, and they
told me he was with you."</p>

<p>Waverill motioned the girl to the seat Claude had placed for
her. As she sat down she glanced inquisitively at the girl in the
other chair.</p>

<p>"Miss Pellet," said the lawyer slowly and distinctly to Olga.
"Let me make you known to Miss Olga Mary Pellet of New York. It
seems you both claim the same name."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter VII.</h2>

<p>The girls turned and looked at one another. From across the
large desk Waverill surveyed them with some amusement, yet evident
perplexity. From his position, at the window, to which he had
returned, Claude stared, first at one girl and then at the other,
in open amazement.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that both men were puzzled at the situation.
Only one of these girls could be the true Olga Mary Pellet. The
other must be an imposter, and it might prove in the end that both
of them were imposters. Waverill, from the direction of his eyes,
favoured the first. Her papers were in order, and there seemed no
reason to doubt her except in so far as Claude's story of the
affair at the house in Pontin Square showed she was the associate
of a crook. Claude favoured the second girl. He could not put from
his mind the many suspicions that had gathered about the first
claimant.</p>

<p>The first girl rose to her feet, indignation blazing in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Waverill. I must have mistaken what you
said?"</p>

<p>"You made no mistake. This lady claims to be Olga Mary
Pellet."</p>

<p>"My name is Olga Mary Pellet," retorted the first girl.</p>

<p>"That is impossible," replied the second girl, now also on her
feet. "It is my name."</p>

<p>"I am the niece of the late Mr. Ezra Gleed," continued the first
girl.</p>

<p>"I am Mr. Gleed's niece," retorted the second girl.</p>

<p>Claude took a step forward, but Waverill motioned him to
silence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waverill," exclaimed the first girl, indignantly, "This
woman is an imposter."</p>

<p>"Mr. Waverill," cried the second girl, "I am the only niece of
the late Mr. Ezra Gleed. My father was Ernest Pellet, a safe-maker,
and he resided for many years in the city of New York."</p>

<p>"My father, Ernest Pellet," continued the first girl, without
taking any notice of the statements of the other girl, "died in the
year 1911. My mother died three years before him. He married a
second time, some twelve months after my mother's death. I have
been, for years, a typist in the employ of the Watson Brake and
Engineering Company, and resigned my appointment on hearing from
you."</p>

<p>"This woman is repeating my history," cried the second girl,
with a look of contempt at her rival. "Where she obtained her
information from I cannot even guess."</p>

<p>"You say I wrote to you," said Mr. Waverill calmly, addressing
neither girl particularly. "Have you that letter here."</p>

<p>Both girls opened their handbags and produced letters and handed
them to the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Here it is." The reply was simultaneous.</p>

<p>Waverill beckoned Claude to his side. The two men looked at the
envelopes as they lay, side by side on the desk. They were
identical in every respect. Handling them gingerly, Waverill pulled
out and opened the letters. Both letters were exact in every
particular. Waverill passed his hand across his brow. How had he
come to sign two letters to the same girl and, even if he had done
such a thing, how had one of them gone astray. No, surely neither
he nor anyone in his office was capable of such a terrible
mistake.</p>

<p>"Strange," he murmured, as he sat back in his chair and tried to
look anywhere but at the two indignant faces before him.</p>

<p>Claude turned to the second claimant.</p>

<p>"On what ship did you sail from New York?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Danetic</i>."</p>

<p>"What was the number of your berth?"</p>

<p>"No. 14 on the main deck."</p>

<p>"That was the number of my cabin," exclaimed the first Olga
indignantly.</p>

<p>"Ladies," interposed the lawyer firmly, "This cannot go on. We
shall arrive nowhere. You both claim to be the heiress of the late
Mr. Ezra Gleed. It is not for me, at this stage, to decide between
you. Neither of you can inherit without first fulfilling the
conditions contained in the will of the testator. Both of you, I
presume are aware of those conditions. These are your papers," he
continued, taking the envelope of papers from his desk and handing
them to the first claimant. "You seem to have identical
identification papers. One set of papers must be forgeries, but
before I will do anything, I must first have handed to me the
sealed package of the Nine Stars, obtained in accordance with the
terms of the will of the testator, the late Mr. Ezra Gleed. When
that package is brought to me I shall then examine the credentials
submitted with it."</p>

<p>He rang his bell and a clerk entered.</p>

<p>"Show these ladies out, Matson," commanded the lawyer.</p>

<p>The door closed behind the girls and Claude sank into a client's
chair with a sigh. Waverill leaned back in his chair and the two
men looked at one another. At last Claude broke the silence.</p>

<p>"You got out of that wonderfully well." he said. "Uncle Gleed
certainly mixed things up some. If I wrote the late interview up
for the 'street' I should be accused of drawing too freely on my
imagination."</p>

<p>"I will not doubt that," replied the lawyer, with a laugh. "The
situation was unbelievable."</p>

<p>"How are you going to reach finality?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Waverill candidly. "For the time being I
am going to do nothing. Smeardon is now the keystone of the
situation and until he gives one of the girls the package of the
Nine Stars I am helpless."</p>

<p>"Uncle Gleed said the package was to be claimed on the night of
the full moon. I am beginning to see some sense in that," said
Claude meditatively. Then after a pause. "Well sir, I suppose we
have wasted enough of your time for one day. You have plenty to
do."</p>

<p>"From the way you speak, you seem to infer the reverse is your
case," observed the lawyer, looking at his visitor with kindly, but
inquisitive, eyes.</p>

<p>"Something of the sort," said Claude, trying to turn the subject
with a laugh. "There are a good many of us young barristers, who
would do badly without Fleet Street at our backs."</p>

<p>"Well, you will not starve with ten thousand pounds in the
bank," retorted the lawyer. "However, I'll try and find a brief or
two to keep your law from getting rusty."</p>

<p>"That's awfully good of you sir," said Claude warmly, grasping
the hand the lawyer held out to him.</p>

<p>Leaving the solicitor's office Claude made his way back to his
chambers. He wanted to be alone and think. When he had heard of the
peculiar conditions in the will of his late uncle he had been
inclined to scoff at the dramatic situation created. Now he was not
so certain. Had Ezra Gleed any inkling of what would be the result
of his death? Had he any fore-knowledge of the intrigues that would
immediately surround his estate? So quickly had the clouds gathered
that Claude could not but think that the old financier had known
that his vast fortune had already attracted rogues around it.
Certainly, from what Waverill had told him, Ezra Gleed knew his
secretary for a rogue. Yet he had placed in his hands a power for
evil that was already bearing fruit. Two women were claiming to be
the heiress of the estate! One of them must be a fraud. From what
he had overheard at Pontin Square a few evenings ago he came to the
conclusion that his suspicions must be directed against the first
claimant. Yet she had told a plausible story. But the second
claimant had told a precisely similar story in every respect. The
story must be true, it bore the impression of truth, therefore the
only inference that could be drawn was that one of the two girls
had, in some way, learned the life history of the true Olga Mary
Pellet and had determined to impersonate her.</p>

<p>The appearance of Tiger Trantor in the matter perplexed Claude.
He wanted to know which of the two claimants the rogue backed.
Certainly the scene in the house at Pontin Square pointed to the
first claimant but with a man of the known ability of the Tiger, it
was never safe to go by first appearances. From what he had seen
and heard, the first claimant had the backing of the Tiger. That
told against her in Claude's mind. No one who had dealings with the
Tiger could be anything but a rogue, but if the first claimant was
the true heiress how did the Tiger get in touch with her and obtain
sufficient influence over her to get her to go first to Smeardon.
She called him "Mr. Mason." Had she known him long? Had she come
over from America with him? Claude wished he had asked those
questions in the lawyer's office. That he was mistaken in the
identity of the man he had seen in the house in Pontin Square he
would not believe. His memory of the Tiger was still very distinct.
Besides, he had verified his suspicions of the rogue by every
available means.</p>

<p>Puzzling over these questions Claude, on reaching his chambers,
lit his pipe and sat down to thrash out the matter and, if
possible, reach a conclusion. For some time he sat there going over
and over the facts, but he could see no light. His instinct told
him to believe the tale told by the second claimant, but the only
evidence he had to support his instinct was the vague distrust of
the first claimant's associates.</p>

<p>He tried to reconstruct the personality of the two girls. Was
there anything about either of them that would cause a suspicion?
Both of them had a good presence but the second girl, in his
opinion, was the better bred. The first girl sometimes lost her
poise and acted, or appeared to be acting, a part. Again, and the
thought flashed across his mind, the clothes of the second girl
bore creases as if recently packed in a trunk. The clothes of the
first girl bore no such signs. It was a small thing, however to
base a question of identity upon.</p>

<p>Determined to reach some conclusion, Claude tried to reconstruct
the scene in the lawyer's office. He had a good memory and could
remember word for word. Both girls had told the same story in every
particular. Was there anything that they had said that he could use
as a starting point for his enquiries?</p>

<p>"The Western Brake and Engineering Company." The name flashed
across his brain. The first claimant said she had been in the
employ of that firm. Then they should be able to give a description
of Olga Mary Pellet. It was not much of a clue, but worth following
up.</p>

<p>Seizing his hat, Claude went out to cable the Western Brake and
Engineering Company of New York, asking for a description of Olga
Mary Pellet. He found the telegraph office crowded and had to wait
some time. While he was waiting, he became aware he was hungry; he
had missed his lunch. When he had despatched his cable, he turned
into an eating house and ordered a meal.</p>

<p>Until he received an answer from America, nothing could be done,
as the lawyer had said, but wait. Claude tried to dismiss the
subject from his mind, but it held so much mystery, and so many
conjectures, that it was impossible. Lighting a cigar, he strolled
back to his chambers. There was some work there he had to finish.
Night had fallen when he arrived at Pump Inn and the staircase was
in darkness. That did hot matter to him for he was continually up
and down the stairs in the dark. When he reached the top stair, he
became aware that someone was standing outside his door.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" he demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>"What an enthusiastic welcome," replied a laughing voice. "Do
you always keep your visitors waiting on the stairs, in the
dark?"</p>

<p>Claude recognised his visitor. It was the second claimant.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter VIII.</h2>

<p>Merrivale hastened to open the door and obtain a light. Olga
followed him into the room. When he turned to her she held out her
hand with a charming gesture.</p>

<p>"Will you not bid me welcome to this great city of yours, cousin
Claude? You would not do so in Mr. Waverill's office. Please, now.
I feel so very friendless and lonely."</p>

<p>"Certainly I bid you welcome," replied Claude, taking her
proffered hand.</p>

<p>"Why no 'Cousin Olga'," asked the girl with a laugh. "You
English are funny. We would not treat a new cousin that way in the
States."</p>

<p>Claude looked at her, standing in his shabby chambers in all her
girlhood freshness. She had appealed to him at Waverill's office,
and he had felt an inclination to befriend her. In his heart he
knew he would have welcomed her heartily and wholly as his cousin
had it not been for the advent of the other girl. The presence of
two claimants for the Gleed millions had brought a feeling of
distrust against both. He knew, he was certain, that the first
claimant was a fraud. He was coming to believe that the girl that
now stood before him was the genuine heiress and his cousin.</p>

<p>"So this is where you live," said Olga, looking round the room
with curiosity. "Will you not ask me to sit down? I have heard so
much of your old inns and funny chambers and I have always wanted
to see them."</p>

<p>"I assure you they are quite commonplace," replied Claude
offering the girl the most comfortable chair. "If they have any
claim to distinction whatever, it must be that they are more
inconvenient and dull than the modern chambers erected outside the
precincts of the inns."</p>

<p>"Then why do you live in them?" Olga asked, quickly. Then with a
complete change of tone. "There, I have offended you. I am too
impulsive, and let my tongue run away with me. You are wondering
why I have come here, are you not?"</p>

<p>"It is a bit outside the usual visiting hours," admitted Claude,
with a laugh. "Some of our old fashioned friends, and we have a
number of them in the Inns, might say stupid things. But I am very
glad to see you, all the same."</p>

<p>"You really mean that?" The girl clapped her hands with delight.
"I have wondered all the way over if you would be glad to see me,
considering what my presence here means to you."</p>

<p>"You refer to the Gleed estate?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Olga paused for a moment and then continued. "It is
a shame Uncle Ezra left such a will."</p>

<p>"It is certainly awkward for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not mean that, cousin Claude." The girl made a
movement of her hands, as if to sweep away all personal interest in
the matter. "I mean that Uncle Ezra was wrong not to have left you
at least a part of his money."</p>

<p>"He left me ten thousand pounds, cousin Olga."</p>

<p>"Poof." The girl blew the idea into the air. "What is ten
thousand pounds besides the millions he must have had."</p>

<p>"It will make a vast difference to me," replied Claude, with a
smile. "My income before that was slightly under 50 per
annum."</p>

<p>"My!" exclaimed Olga. "How on earth did you live on that?"</p>

<p>Claude laughed as he thought of the many shifts he had been put
to in the endeavour to live.</p>

<p>"There are ways and means when 'must' rules," he said. "You
forget I have a reversionary interest in the estate."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give you much for that," said Olga, confidently. "An
American girl is not likely to be baffled by any old conditions in
a stupid will. But you believe that I am the right Olga Pellet, do
you not?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I must not express an opinion," answered Claude,
shortly. This girl was an adept at asking embarrassing
questions.</p>

<p>"But that was just what I came to ask you," she panted. "I want
yon and I to be outside all this nasty legal business. Can't we be
good friends, without bothering our heads about Uncle Ezra's
fortune? Will you not believe I am Olga Mary Pellet?"</p>

<p>"Have you the necessary proofs?" asked Claude suddenly.</p>

<p>"Ample proof," answered the girl, gravely. "Mr. Waverill can see
my papers at any time. Cousin Claude, who is this girl who claims
to be me?"</p>

<p>"That is more than I can answer." He had no intention of telling
her of the scene at the house in Pontin Square and of his
suspicions that the first claimant was a tool of 'Tiger' Trantor
and Smeardon. "I first met her only a few days ago."</p>

<p>"She then claimed to be the heiress of Uncle Ezra?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you then doubted her?"</p>

<p>"What reason have you for thinking that?" asked Claude,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Olga laughed.</p>

<p>"I could see you did in Mr. Waverill's office. You don't doubt
me, now?"</p>

<p>"You must be a thought reader," laughed Claude. "How did you
guess all that?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am. Cousin Claude, you have not yet wished me
luck."</p>

<p>She held out her hands to him again. Claude took them in both
his.</p>

<p>"With all my heart, I wish you luck," he said earnestly.</p>

<p>"In spite of the fact that, but for me, you would inherit the
Gleed estate?"</p>

<p>"In spite of that, and more," answered Claude. He was looking
straight into her eyes and something in his expression must have
startled her, for she blushed and withdrew her hand quickly. In a
moment she had recovered her composure and turned to him again.</p>

<p>"Say. 'I wish you luck, cousin Olga,'" she commanded,
prettily.</p>

<p>"I wish you luck, cousin Olga," he repeated obediently.</p>

<p>There was a crash of glass. With an exclamation, Claude stepped
towards the girl and swung her into a corner. Then he looked
towards the window. The glass was smashed.</p>

<p>"Look!" said the girl in a terrified whisper. She pointed to the
table. There, among the papers, lay a large stone with a dirty bit
of paper tied round it. Leaving the stone for the moment, Claude
strode to the window and flung it open. There was no one in the
Inn.</p>

<p>Olga had come to the table and had picked up the stone. She
undid the string from around it and, when Claude turned to her
again, she had the paper spread out on the table under the
lamp.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Claude Merrivale," she read in a steady
voice, "Keep out of a matter that does not concern you. The Gleed
millions will never be yours. Tell the woman now with you to get
back to the place she came from."</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him with a queer laugh. "A funny kind of
post you have in this old country. Can you tell me what this is all
about?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could, and I wish I could get my hands on the postman.
It is disgusting you should be frightened so."</p>

<p>"Never mind me," replied the girl, briskly, "I can fight my own
battles, but they threaten you. What do you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"What can I do?" replied Claude bitterly. "If I knew who my
correspondent is, I might take the law into my own hands, or sue
him for a broken window."</p>

<p>"But what does it all mean? Why are you not to interfere and why
am I to go away?"</p>

<p>"That is a long story," replied Claude, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And you don't trust me sufficiently, to tell me." said the
girl, reproachfully.</p>

<p>Claude hesitated a minute and then decided to trust her. She was
now being threatened and it was her due, that she should know the
truth.</p>

<p>"It is the story of the beginning of the fight for the Greed
estate," he answered. "Yes, cousin Olga, you should know, and I
must tell you. But you must not stay here. I will take you back to
your hotel and tell you everything I know on the way there."</p>

<p>Leaving the girl in the sitting room, Claude hunted out a
revolver. If these people, and he believed the warning came from
Tiger Trantor's gang, were threatening, they would not hesitate to
put their threats into practice. It was well to be prepared and he
did not mean his pretty cousin to come to harm while with him.</p>

<p>Walking through the partially deserted streets Claude told the
girl of the scene at the death-bed of Ezra Gleed. From that he went
on to his recognition of Tiger Trantor with Smeardon in Holborn,
and then to the scene at the house in Pontin Square on the night of
the full moon, and his seeing the first claimant in the company of
the Tiger and Smeardon. Olga was deeply interested and questioned
him keenly. He found she had brains. He recognised that, once her
identity was fully established, she would prove a valuable ally in
the fight against the forces of evil arrayed against them. That the
Tiger would be able to frighten her away from England, he felt, was
impossible.</p>

<p>Outside the Lyric Hotel, Olga stopped and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Here is my hotel," she said. "Good-night, cousin Claude. I paid
you an unconventional call tonight. I am afraid you must return my
visit at a more proper hour."</p>

<p>With a final wave of her hand she ran up the steps and
disappeared through the revolving doors.</p>

<p>It was a fine night and Claude was not inclined for bed. Turning
down Savoy Street he strolled along the Embankment. It was dark
here and the only people about were the flotsam of the great city.
Pacing citywards he mused over the quickly happening events of the
last few days. Out of nothing had come Romance and Romance had
brought a girl in its train. He had found a relation whose
existence he had not heard of until a few days ago. He had found
this relation to be a beautiful girl, more, an intelligent and
pleasing companion. But Romance had brought more substantial
benefits with her. He had become possessed of a competency. The old
bad days were gone, never to return. Those days when he starved
while he waited for the opportunity that did not come. He smiled
when he remembered the days when he had walked the streets with his
articles and stories under his arm, vainly searching for his next
meal.</p>

<p>It was all over now. Waverill, the great lawyer, had taken him
up and he had enough money in the bank to make him independent of
his pen. He could devote his time to the law, the work he loved. He
would work hard and rise in his chosen profession. He was passing
the Temple Station when a street boy darted out of the shadows and
thrust a note into his hand. Claude clutched it mechanically and
turned to question the boy, but the urchin had disappeared as
quickly as he had come. Close by was an electric lamp. Claude
strode to it, opening the note. It contained but a single line:</p>

<p class="letter">It is unwise to walk in the dark.</p>

<p>Claude looked around for the writer or the boy. Far down the
road a motor car was drawn up against the curb. A woman stood at
the open door of the car and Claude thought she was looking in his
direction. He started towards her, but she stepped quickly into the
car, which immediately drove off.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter IX.</h2>

<p>The following morning Claude awoke late! While he was
breakfasting, he drew the two notes he had received the previous
evening from his pocket and studied them again. They were in no way
alike. One was the threat of an enemy, the other apparently a
warning from a friend.</p>

<p>The writing on the note that had arrived so dramatically through
the window was disguised. It was half printed on common paper and
intended to be taken as the work of an illiterate person, but to
the barrister's trained senses, it did not ring true. He decided
that the pen had been in the hand of a man of some culture, perhaps
not the culture of school and university, but certainly the culture
of the school of the world.</p>

<p>The second note was on good paper and written in a flowing hand.
It might have been disguised, and probably was, but to in no way
disguise the refinement and culture of the writer. It might be the
handwriting of an educated woman. If it was, then, the woman had
received a good business training and had a keen intellect.</p>

<p>Claude there seemed little doubt but that the second note had
been written by the woman he had seen standing at the door of the
motor car on the Embankment. Dimly he seemed to remember her
presence there some time before the note was placed in his hand.
And, absurd as the idea appeared to him, she had watched him from
the moment he had come in sight. When he had read the note and had
first set conscious eyes on her, she was watching him. He was
certain of that. Then when he had moved in her direction she had
driven off.</p>

<p>From the notes, his thoughts turned to his cousin Olga. He
reviewed her visit to him on the previous evening. When he had
first met her he had determined to stand neutral to the dispute
between the two claimants, but Olga had swept him off his feet.
Almost against his will had he promised to help her. Was he sorry
for his promise? He hardly knew. He was almost convinced the first
girl was the tool of the rogues, but was the other girl the
rightful heiress?</p>

<p>There was some significance in the fact that the Tiger was
trying to frighten her away. He had watched her closely on the
arrival of the message through the window. She had been frightened
and astonished. The threat to himself and the girl made one thing
clear. The Tiger and Smeardon had shown their hand. They had shown
that the first claimant was a fraud and a tool of theirs. They had
warned him from interfering and he took that warning as a
declaration they intended to steal the Gleed millions.</p>

<p>There were difficult and dark days ahead; he could not doubt
that. Waverill had asked his aid in guarding the estate. He had
refused, but this girl had come to him asking for his aid and
support. He had granted it to her, but his promise could do no
harm. He would fall in with the wishes of the lawyer. He would act
so as to safeguard the estate. If the second claimant was the true
heiress, he would then be guarding her interests.</p>

<p>Whatever line he took, he realised it was necessary that
Waverill should know of the latest developments. Claude went to a
public phone and rang up a lawyer. He was informed that Waverill
had been called away on important business and would probably not
return that day. It was annoying but the matter could wait. There
were many days to the next full moon.</p>

<p>When he arrived back at his chambers, a boy from an office below
was waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merrivale, someone on our phone wishes to speak to
you."</p>

<p>Claude went down to the instrument. It might be the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Is that you, cousin Claude?" The voice came distinct, with its
tinge of Americanism, over the wire. "I'm so glad I've caught you.
Can you come round to me."</p>

<p>"How did you get this number," asked Claude much astonished.</p>

<p>"I rang up Mr. Waverill and the clerk gave me this number. He
said you gave it for Mr. Waverill's use until you had a telephone
of your own. Can you come round cousin, I've had such a funny
letter."</p>

<p>"Hold up!" Claude spoke quickly. "Don't talk over the phone.
I'll come round to you at once."</p>

<p>"How good of you," murmured the voice, and then came the little
disconnecting click. Ten minutes later Claude entered the lounge of
the Lyric Hotel to find Olga waiting for him. They found a quiet
corner, and then Olga handed him a single sheet of notepaper.
Claude started, for the handwriting was identical with that of the
second note of the previous evening. Like his, it contained a
single line of writing.</p>

<p class="letter">You have undertaken a dangerous task. Be
careful.</p>

<p>The letter bore neither signature nor address. Claude turned it
over in his hand and studied the texture of the paper. He then drew
the letter sent to him, from his pocket, and compared the two. The
paper was the same. He asked for the envelope. Olga went to fetch
it. When she returned he studied, the postmark. It has been posted
in the "W.O. District," the number indicating probably at some
pillar box on or near the Embankment.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked Olga with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>"That is just what I mean to find out," replied Claude with a
smile. "At present we are working in the dark. I think the writer
is friendly to us; she gave me a warning last night."</p>

<p>"She! You think this was written by a woman?"</p>

<p>"I am certain of that," replied Claude.</p>

<p>Then he recounted to Olga the incident of the letter on the
Embankment on the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Do you think Smeardon has anything to do with this," asked
Olga, tapping the letter she had received that morning.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Claude emphatically. "The note thrown through my
window last night came from him or the Tiger. That is certain. This
came from a different source. The Tiger will not warn us
again."</p>

<p>"Then I am not to inherit the Gleed millions without a fight,"
observed Olga, a defiant note in her voice. "Well, I'm not
frightened. If they want a fight they shall have it."</p>

<p>"Good girl!" laughed Claude. "But you must be careful."</p>

<p>A glint of mischief shone in the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"Then you are on my side. I am so glad--Claude."</p>

<p>It was the first time she had left out the "cousin" before his
name and, for the moment, Claude nearly lost his head.</p>

<p>"Waverill had better hear of our adventures as soon as
possible," he said briefly. "If you will give me your letter, I
will take it to him."</p>

<p>"Mr. Waverill is out of town," replied Olga, with a pout. "And I
wanted you to stay and lunch with me. Need you go, cousin
Claude."</p>

<p>Claude hesitated, and laid down his hat again. During the lunch,
Claude laughingly refused to discuss the Gleed mystery, as they now
named it. He led the girl to speak of her past life in that huge,
strange city of New York. Particularly was he interested in her
father's life story. He had an idea, at present no more than an
instinct, that when the mystery was cleared up, Earnest Pellet
would be found to have played a large part in the event leading up
to the peculiar will of Ezra Gleed.</p>

<p>Olga talked well and her little American accent lent piquancy to
her descriptions of American life and manners. She portrayed the
daily round of the average American business girl. She wove a
romance about the dusty details of American office life; the men
she had met, principals, managers and clerks. Claude thought he
would recognise on sight many of the people she spoke of. For her
fellow workers, Olga had a wide sympathy. She recognised and
accentuated their peculiarities yet around her descriptions was a
subtle sympathy that brightness and glossed all that was drab and
sordid in their lives. The hours passed and Claude could not tear
himself away.</p>

<p>When he left, late in the afternoon, he made his way to Holborn
Inn. Just as he was mounting the steps Waverill came out.</p>

<p>"Heard you had telephoned this, morning," exclaimed the lawyer.
"Told the clerks to get you but you had disappeared."</p>

<p>"I've been lunching with my cousin," answered Claude, feeling
somewhat uncomfortable under the lawyer's gaze.</p>

<p>"Which one?" asked the lawyer, briefly?</p>

<p>"There is only one," answered Claude, angrily. "You surely do
not consider the first girl, for a moment?"</p>

<p>"I don't consider either of them at present," retorted the
lawyer. "I'm just waiting, Micawber-like, for something to turn
up."</p>

<p>"Miss Pellet and I have had some correspondence," said Claude,
quickly.</p>

<p>"So! Come info my room."</p>

<p>Seated in the lawyer's office, Claude went over the events that
had happened since he left the lawyer the previous day: the visit
of Olga to his chambers; his telegram to America; the message
through the window; the woman on the Embankment; and, finally, the
letter to Olga. The lawyer studied the documents carefully. Then he
opened a drawer and took out a letter and a telegram.</p>

<p>"This is an answer to your cable," he observed, as he handed it
to Claude. "You were wise to have it addressed to me, instead of to
your chambers."</p>

<p>Claude opened the envelope.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Olga Mary Pellet, employed here one year ten
months. Left own wish. Fully satisfactory. Medium height fair hair,
blue eyes, slender figure, speaks well, good presence dresses well,
no visible marks. Left here <i>Danetic</i>--Western.</p>

<p>"It might fit either girl," commented Claude, as he handed the
message to the lawyer. "It was a chance shot of mine and has not
brought us luck."</p>

<p>The lawyer took the cable and handed Claude the letter. He
looked at the envelope. It had a familiar appearance, and as he
withdrew from it a large card, be realised it was from the person
who had sent Olga and him the warning. The card bore only a
diagram.</p>

<p>A<br>
*<br>
E</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"The first of the Nine Stars," answered Claude
involuntarily.</p>

<p>"I did not think of that!" exclaimed the lawyer, bending over
the card. "The mystery is getting deeper."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter X.</h2>

<p>The two men bent over the mysterious card, in bewilderment. That
it held some definite part in the mystery that was fast closing
around the Gleed Estate was certain. It was also probable that the
sign bore some allusion to the contents of the safe in the house in
Pontin Square. What was the connection? What was the secret, if
secret there was?</p>

<p>Waverill, at length, declared that expert aid must be called in.
The presence of two girls, each claiming to be Ezra Gleed's
heiress, and the present inability to choose between them, inclined
the lawyer to direct action. Claude at first opposed the suggestion
but, after reflection, fell in with the lawyer's views.</p>

<p>"I have just the person to tackle this in mind," exclaimed
Waverill. "In my business I have to rely to a great extent on
private detectives for the information I require. For years I had
trouble with people who would not, or could not, understand that I
wanted evidence and nothing else. Lately I have come in touch with
an American firm who suit me exactly. They are intelligent and
exact in their work. I am going to place this matter in their
hands."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Claude, dubiously.</p>

<p>"The Black Detective Agency, of Chicago. They have lately opened
a branch over here."</p>

<p>The lawyer paused, and looked at Claude with a peculiar
expression on his face. Then he continued:</p>

<p>"I am beginning to think, Merrivale, you will have to take a
much more prominent part in this matter."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"We are up against a big problem," said the lawyer. "There is no
doubt but that the Gleed estate is threatened by rogues. Unless
some decided steps are taken by us, it is probable an unauthorised
person may obtain the package of the Nine Stars and then apply to
me for the delivery of the estate. I shall, or course, put every
obstacle in the way until I am satisfied of the authenticity of the
claimant. But you have seen how far these people are prepared to
go. The papers of the first girl are perfect, so far as I have
examined them. If a further examination does not disclose a flaw I
shall have to hand over the estate, or stand an action for its
recovery from me. That will be a difficult and costly action, but
there is an easier way."</p>

<p>Claude was silent for some minutes. He could guess what was in
the lawyer's mind.</p>

<p>"The will gives you the right to interfere," continued Waverill.
"I know it will be unpleasant for you and will look as if you wish
to obtain this estate for yourself, but what can we do? You are the
only safeguard we have."</p>

<p>"Then you wish me to prevent Miss Pellet obtaining the package
of the Nine Stars?"</p>

<p>"It is the only way, Merrivale. I will not say you should act so
as to finally claim the estate. That is left to your discretion
under the will. But for the present--"</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that, Waverill," exclaimed Claude angrily. "I
know I must do this, however bad it looks, but you must not imagine
that I wish to collar the money."</p>

<p>"I don't think that, my boy," said the lawyer kindly. "I know
you too well for that. You must remember that there is plenty of
time for Miss Pellet to claim her inheritance. I only wish you to
bar the way until we can lay these rogues by the heel and have
evidence as to the heiress' identity."</p>

<p>Claude gave way reluctantly. It was not an honourable position
the lawyer forced him into, and to the world it would appear that
he wished to obtain the Gleed millions. He could in no way conceal
his actions. Every night of the full moon he would have to attend
at the house in Pontin Square during the stipulated time and guard
the package from any claimant. His actions would become public, and
probably would provide sensational news for the lower class of
newspapers.</p>

<p>He was forced to agree, and did so, believing he could thus best
guard his new-found cousin's interests. One stipulation he made and
that was if at any time the lawyer had certain information that the
second claimant was the true heiress, he was to allow her to claim
the package immediately.</p>

<p>The agreement was not satisfactory to Claude. For some days he
went about his work in a very bad temper. During that time he saw
much of his cousin, although at first he rather avoided her. She
sought him out and insisted on his company laughing at his sullen
moods.</p>

<p>"Cousin Claude," she said one day, "are you prepared to make a
deal with me?"</p>

<p>"A deal?" Claude repeated. They were in his chamber, Olga seated
by the open window, alternately reading and interrupting Claude at
his work.</p>

<p>"A deal," she repeated mockingly. "A compromise, if you do not
understand good American."</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you mean," he replied. The brief before
him was of a technical nature and required great concentration.
Olga's chattering was sometimes disconcerting.</p>

<p>Olga stamped her foot, impatiently.</p>

<p>"You are the dullest man I have ever met," she exclaimed. "A
deal! A compromise! A settlement! An understanding! There now! Do
you understand?"</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"My fortune, of course." The girl rose and came across to the
desk. "Is there anything more important in this world than a
fortune of seven millions?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!"</p>

<p>"Yes. THAT!" mimicked the girl, in reply. "Claude, I'm tired of
waiting. The second full moon is nearly here and I want to make
things certainties."</p>

<p>Claude lay down his pen and looked at the girl who had pushed
the papers into a heap and had seated herself on the corner of his
desk.</p>

<p>"What do you propose?"</p>

<p>"I want you and I to go to the house on the night of the full
moon and demand those papers from Mr. Smeardon."</p>

<p>"My dear child," observed Claude, "Have you forgotten the
conditions of the will."</p>

<p>"I don't think there is a man in the whole of the States who has
not more sense than the average Englishman," said Olga heatedly.
"Of course I haven't. You can see that the scene is set all right
and then go outside the door."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" mimicked Olga.</p>

<p>"But I must not be on the premises," objected Claude.</p>

<p>"Then get off them," ordered Olga, now seriously angry. "You're
the biggest stupid I've ever known. There's plenty of room in the
Square outside."</p>

<p>Claude considered. It was a possibility. If he and Waverill took
measures to safeguard the house from the Tiger it might be possible
to fall in with Olga's wishes. The more he considered the plan the
more he liked it.</p>

<p>"You promised to help me, Claude," whispered Olga, from behind
him now.</p>

<p>It was feasible and would surely end this uncertainty.</p>

<p>"I'll speak to Waverill about it, Olga," he said quietly. "I
like the idea, but he must know of it first."</p>

<p>Olga stamped her foot again.</p>

<p>"Everything is Mr. Waverill," she exclaimed angrily. "I thought
it would be such fun if you and I could go to that gloomy old
house, get the papers, and call on Mr. Waverill the next morning
with everything in order."</p>

<p>"I can't act without Waverill's knowledge." answered Claude.</p>

<p>Olga came round to her seat on the table. She leaned forward
towards Claude. He could smell the perfume of her hair. Her eyes
were looking into his, and held a half promise that made his heart
jump.</p>

<p>"Help me, cousin Claude--Claude--and--and I will divide with
you. Fifty-fifty, straight."</p>

<p>"Claude stiffened in his chair."</p>

<p>"I can't do it, Olga," he said briefly but firmly. "Waverill
should know. He will approve, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"You're the biggest pig in the world," exclaimed Olga, jumping
off her perch and gathering up her belongings. "If you don't come
round to the hotel and tell me you will do this, I'll never speak
to you again."</p>

<p>The door closed behind her with a bang and he heard her running
down the stairs. As he went to follow her the telephone bell
rang.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"That you, Merrivale," came the reply. "This is Waverill. Can
you come up to my house at once."</p>

<p>"Right." answered Claude, hanging the receiver on its hook. He
would have better preferred to follow his cousin and make his peace
with her.</p>

<p>He caught a taxi in the Strand and drove to Hampstead. Waverill
met him at the door and took him at once to the library. Seated by
the fire was a young girl of about twenty-one or twenty-two years
of age.</p>

<p>"Miss Smith of the Black Detective Agency," said Waverill. "The
agency has placed the Gleed matter in her hands. Miss Smith, this
is Mr. Claude Merrivale, the nephew of the late Ezra Gleed. You
have read the will and understand how he is interested in the
matter."</p>

<p>In the resultant conference, Claude gathered that the Agency had
taken off the man they had first detailed for the work, and placed
it in this girl's hands. He felt vexed, for she did not appear to
him capable of dealing with so complex a problem. She must have
noticed this, for when the interview closed she held out her hand
to Claude.</p>

<p>"You think I am much too young to handle this matter
satisfactorily?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes." replied Claude, surprised into unexpected candour. Then
he attempted to explain. "You see, we have to do with some very
thorough scoundrels, and you might get hurt."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the girl somewhat defiantly.</p>

<p>"It's a man's work," continued Claude. "A girl--"</p>

<p>"Yet Mr. Waverill and the Agency trust me," said the girl with a
quiet smile. "Will you not trust me, too?"</p>

<p>There was a quiet steadiness in her glance and Claude realised
that under her reserved manner lay a strength of character and a
fund of determination he had not suspected.</p>

<p>"Yes, I trust you," he said warmly, "but I don't like it. We
have to deal with some of the worst scoundrels going, and it will
be a nasty business. Much too nasty for you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she answered with another smile. "I have come up
against some very nasty characters in my life and have not suffered
any harm. Have we finished, Mr. Waverill?"</p>

<p>"There is one other matter." Claude interrupted the lawyer's
assent.</p>

<p>He rapidly outlined Olga's request. Waverill was dubious, but
Miss Smith was emphatic that no such scheme should be tried.</p>

<p>"It is early yet," she declared, "It is a probable solution and
we can try it later on. At present I think it advisable that Mr.
Merrivale should simply block all attempts to obtain the
package."</p>

<p>It was left at that and in his heart Claude felt relieved,
though why he could not have said. He followed Miss Smith out on to
the pavement and asked permission to see her home.</p>

<p>"We are not a satisfactory body of people at present, Miss
Smith," he said, laughingly. "No actual violence has taken place
yet, but we have been threatened and warned."</p>

<p>Miss Smith accepted his reason without hesitation. They walked
on for some distance before they could secure a taxi. When they
were seated in the car, she appeared absorbed in her thoughts and
Claude, after some attempts at conversation, remained silent.</p>

<p>Claude had received the directions, "Morton Street, Kensington"
from Miss Smith. When they got to the corner of the street the cab
stopped and the driver asked for the number. Miss Smith decided,
however, to descend and walk the remainder of the way. Morton
Street is a long, quiet thoroughfare, and they were some minutes
before they arrived at the house where Miss Smith lodged. Lounging
at the railings outside the house was one of those street Arabs
that infest the heart of London. When he caught sight of Miss Smith
and her escort, he straightened himself and came forward.</p>

<p>"Is yer Missus Smith," he queried.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>The boy handed her a dirty slip of paper, and when Claude tried
to detain him, ducked suddenly and ran off into the darkness. Miss
Smith walked to a lamp post and unfolded the paper.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"You may think you are clever," the read, "but
if you are wise, you will get out of this game."</p>

<p>The girl handed the paper to Claude in silence, and then with a
perfunctory "good-night," disappeared into the house.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter XI.</h2>

<p>The failure of their attempt to obtain possession of the package
of the Nine Stars on the night of the new moon had not disheartened
the Tiger. Then came Polly's report of her interview with the
lawyer and the appearance of the second claimant. Smeardon had
sworn violently, but the Tiger only smiled. He had learned to
control his feelings and, in that lesson, had found the secret of
controlling the vast forces for evil that undermined the city of
London. He met his reverses with a smiling face and his followers
were heartened and urged to fresh efforts. Many a time he had
escaped by the merest margin while his associates had been
captured. It had been his nerve that had saved him, that ability to
smile in the face of danger.</p>

<p>In spite of his luck, at no time had he ever been accused of
seeking his own safety by the sacrifice of his confederates. In
every adventure he had accepted his full share of the risks, and
when the unexpected had happened and his associates had fallen into
the clutches of the police he had schemed, often successfully, to
save them from their well-deserved punishment. In this he had
accepted big risks. This had been acknowledged by the underworld
where it has always been accepted that every man stood for himself.
He called it his luck, but it was more a matter of calculation. He
had never deserted a friend, and therefore his influence was
supreme.</p>

<p>When he had accosted Smeardon in the tea-shop in the Strand he
had not just happened to be there. For a long time he had had an
eye on Ezra Gleed's secretary, waiting for the right moment to
speak. There had been the sentence of Tom Britton to solve and he
more than suspected that Smeardon could give the solution. Then,
the position Smeardon held had great possibilities. He had been
content to wait, but the death of the old financier had
precipitated matters. He had asked Smeardon how the old financier
had disposed of his fortune, and the information given him opened a
wide field of possibilities. He was not long in discovering
Smeardon was already scheming to take advantage of the peculiar
conditions created by the will.</p>

<p>Many years before Smeardon obtained, by fraud, the position of
private secretary to Ezra Gleed, he had been a member of the
Tiger's gang. His agile brain, his cleverness in planning, but
above all his ability as a forger had made him valuable. Yet the
Tiger had never trusted him. He had recognised the cowardice of the
man and that he would not hesitate to betray his comrades at the
first hint of danger. In one of the gang's schemes something had
cone wrong. Tom Britton had been associated with Smeardon in the
work and Smeardon had betrayed his associate. The Tiger had
suspected the betrayer but Smeardon had covered his tracks too
cleverly. Then came the arrest and trial of the Tiger. Here again
he had recognised the hand of Smeardon. Now he was waiting and
watching, using the treacherous scoundrel to serve his present
ends.</p>

<p>Smeardon had tried to rebel when the Tiger took command of the
scheme for obtaining the Gleed millions. There had been sharp words
and the Tiger had spoken openly of his suspicions. It had been
necessary to overawe the man. Smeardon's quick submission only
caused the Tiger to watch more carefully. He knew that he had
frightened Smeardon; that the latter thought he knew more than he
did; but the Tiger did not intend to act at present however far his
suspicions might become certainties. He was dazzled by the
magnitude of the game he was playing.</p>

<p>Smeardon had thrown the stone through the window of Merrivale's
chambers. The Tiger had been angry for the man had acted without
orders, though the action did no harm. He did not think that
Merrivale would take any notice of the warning. Then his spies
brought him knowledge of Waverill's application to the Black
Detective Agency, an organisation that had driven him out of the
United States. He feared the Agency, who used methods unknown to
the red-tape police of England. They had surprised him, driven him
from pillar to post, cornered his best agents, and finally had
placed him in such a position that he had only escaped out of the
States with a bare margin on safely. Then he had heard that Miss
Smith had been detailed to the case; the girl who had planned and
almost brought about his downfall.</p>

<p>It was the night of the full moon and the Tiger sat in Ezra
Gleed's study. He was sprawling in a lounge chair before the fire,
smoking and watching Smeardon, who sat huddled over the desk.</p>

<p>"Is the girl ready?" asked Smeardon at length.</p>

<p>The Tiger did not answer him. He was watching the old secretary
trying to read the thoughts that lay behind those small cunning
eyes.</p>

<p>"Is the girl ready?" repeated Smeardon, angrily. "Do you realise
we shall lose this money if you play any of your fool tricks."</p>

<p>"I've been studying you, Matt," observed the Tiger, ignoring the
other's question. "I've been wondering what you did and where you
went alter the trial of Tom Britton."</p>

<p>"And yourself?" answered Smeardon, daringly.</p>

<p>"And myself," repeated the Tiger.</p>

<p>"That's my business," answered Smeardon.</p>

<p>"A business that will one day be mine." The Tiger was speaking
in quiet tones which yet held a menace that Smeardon recognised but
did not dare resent. "Another subject of my meditations is, how you
came to fall into this comfortable billet."</p>

<p>"Again, I tell you, that is my business," snarled Smeardon. He
was growing uncomfortable under the Tigers gaze. Did the Tiger
suspect he had betrayed Britton and himself to the police? The
thought caused an uncomfortable shiver to run down his back.</p>

<p>"Yet it is a matter on which I have great curiosity," continued
the Tiger. "We may have to discuss the subject at length one day,
Matt."</p>

<p>"Look here, Tiger," shouted Smeardon, jumping up from his chair.
"What do you mean? Our business is to got hold of that money, and
you are harking back over the past four years. I didn't let you
into this game for that."</p>

<p>"Let me into this game," repeated the Tiger, sarcastically. "You
let me in because you could not play it yourself."</p>

<p>"I could have done as much as you have done, and more. You've
done nothing but talk so far."</p>

<p>"You would have landed yourself in the place where I once stood,
and not with my luck," answered the Tiger with a glint of anger in
his eyes. "Perhaps you will yet stand there."</p>

<p>Smeardon drew back as if from a blow.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Britton is due out this month."</p>

<p>"What's that to me?" It was a poor attempt at bravado.</p>

<p>"He is coming here."</p>

<p>"Here!" Smeardon caught his breath.</p>

<p>"We shall need him, I think," said the Tiger meditatively, and
carefully watching the other's face. "Yes, he will be a real asset
in the game if we have to use force. I dislike to use violence, as
you know, but sometimes it is necessary."</p>

<p>"I won't have him here!" shouted Smeardon.</p>

<p>"And I want him here." The Tiger rose to his feet and stretched
himself. "What have you to fear from Britton, Matthew Smeardon, you
did not betray him to the police. You were his pal once."</p>

<p>"What do you mean? I--I've nothing to fear," stuttered Smeardon,
avoiding the Tiger's glance. "Tom and I were good friends."</p>

<p>"Let us hope he still thinks so," said the Tiger, casually. "You
will be delighted to talk over old times with him."</p>

<p>"I won't have him here, Tiger," repeated Smeardon, with now a
note of entreaty in his voice. "It will--?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked the Tiger swiftly.</p>

<p>"The police will know it. It will cause suspicion," answered
Smeardon, weakly.</p>

<p>"I will take care of that. Britton comes here and you will hide
him as long as I choose. That is final, Matt."</p>

<p>Smeardon walked to the window and pulled aside the blind. When
the Tiger spoke in that tone, it was useless to argue further.</p>

<p>"Drop that blind," commanded the Tiger quickly.</p>

<p>"I was looking for Polly," answered Smeardon. "She is late."</p>

<p>"I told her not to be too soon," said the Tiger. "It's no good
hurrying things. Besides, there may be trouble and we don't want
the whole town here."</p>

<p>A knock came at the street door. Smeardon started to his feet
and hurried to the door of the room.</p>

<p>The Tiger rose quietly, with a peculiar smile on his face.</p>

<p>"Don't get excited Matt," he warned. "It may not be Polly."</p>

<p>In spite of the warning, Smeardon hurried to the door and
released the latch. Someone without pushed the door open violently,
thrusting Smeardon to the wall.</p>

<p>"Takes you a devil of a long time to open the door here,"
growled a harsh voice in the darkness.</p>

<p>Smeardon shut the door and groped for the switch. In a moment
the hall was flooded with light. Facing him was a short, thickset
man muffled up to the eyes in a thick muffler, over a great
coat.</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed Smeardon, backing against the wall.</p>

<p>The man peered into Smeardon's face.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Matt! Matthew Smeardon, by all that's holy. What
the--"</p>

<p>"Come in here, Tom," interrupted the Tiger, speaking from the
door of the study. "Shut off that light, Matt. You surely recognise
your old friend, Tom Britton."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter XII.</h2>

<p>Smeardon leaned against the wall to recover his composure. He
realised now why the Tiger had planned for Tom Britton to come to
the house unexpectedly. The arrival of Britton had been a shock to
him. Had he shown any great agitation? No, he did not think he had
betrayed himself. Bracing himself for what might come, he followed
his fellow rogues into the study. Britton was shedding his wraps
while the Tiger was talking in a quick undertone.</p>

<p>As Smeardon entered, Britton turned to him with a somewhat
constrained heartiness.</p>

<p>"Well, Matt." he said in his deep voice. "This is a bit better
than where I've come from. The Tiger tells me you will put me up
for a time. You're a lucky devil. Always seem to fall on your
feet."</p>

<p>Smeardon sniggered and walked to the desk, where he stood idly
fingering the papers. He could not muster courage to look Britton
in the eyes. He feared what he might read there.</p>

<p>"That's what I've been telling him since he came into the fold
again," said the Tiger genially. Smeardon thought the Tiger laid an
emphasis on the word 'fold.' "It's certain he's fallen on a good
thing this time and he's willing to share with his old
friends."</p>

<p>"I'm out and open for a job," replied Britton with a broad grin.
"What's the game?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present, except to rest yourself and have a good
time." replied the Tiger. "The pay will go on all the same. We may
want you as the strong man of the outfit presently, though."</p>

<p>"Safe work?" queried Britton.</p>

<p>"Nothing so common. Its only the matter of a young lady friend
of Matt's. I's picking up the coin when Matt gets it for us. All
you need know is that a young lady will call here tonight to obtain
some papers from Matt. If she turns up you'll do, say, as a
witness. If others interfere we may require help from you of
another kind."</p>

<p>"Right-O," said Britton, casually seating himself in one of the
lounge chairs before the fire. "This is a bit of all right, but
you're none too free with your hospitality, Matt. Close as ever,
eh, Tiger."</p>

<p>With trembling hands, Smeardon brought liquor to the table and
helped Britton to a drink. The man lay back in his chair, his legs
crossed and the soles of his boots turned to the welcome blaze. He
was big built with heavy square shoulders and the muscles of his
arms bulged beneath his coat. His head was somewhat small and long,
sloping well to the forehead over which his thick hair was
beginning to grow again. The eyes were small and twinkled
good-naturedly, although when he glanced at Smeardon, as he did
occasionally, they held a baneful light. His nose was broad and
short and above the mouth there sprouted a short wire-like
moustache. He bore the impress of a rogue, a rogue with immense
strength, but not a brute unless events made him one. To the Tiger
he acted with much familiarity, yet there was a certain deference.
It was as if he recognised his limitations in his walk of life and
acknowledged in the Tiger his natural leader.</p>

<p>"That's good." he muttered as he placed his empty glass on the
table, "They don't give you tipple like that where I have just come
from."</p>

<p>"Hell!" shouted Smeardon, swinging round on him furiously, "Why
do you want to remind us continually that you have been in
prison?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps its good for you, sonny," laughed Britton, good
naturedly. "Perhaps you'll have a turn there yourself some day.
That's if you don't get something else coming your way."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you two." commanded the Tiger impatiently. "You always
were slinging off at each other. Time Polly was here."</p>

<p>"What! Is little Polly in this?" exclaimed Britton. "I'll be
glad to see the kid again. She's one of the right sort."</p>

<p>"Yon won't have to wait long then," snarled Smeardon, as he rose
to answer a knock at the door. In a few minutes he returned,
preceding a girl thickly veiled. Without a word she dropped heavily
into the chair the Tiger pushed towards her.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Polly," he said quietly. "Been
followed?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded silently.</p>

<p>"Get her a drink, Matt," commanded the Tiger. "Let's get the
business over first," said Smeardon going to the bookcase. "I've a
feeling something is going to happen."</p>

<p>He pressed the hidden spring and the shelves revolved silently.
Smeardon bent down to work the combination and then sprang back
with a shriek. The two men sprang to his side. On the door of the
safe appeared a shining silver star.</p>

<p>"What's this foolery," exclaimed the Tiger, darting a suspicious
glance at Smeardon.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of it. I swear I don't Tiger," cried Smeardon,
his knees sagging to the carpet. "No one's been here, I'll swear.
Why, I've hardly been out of this room."</p>

<p>"It's certain someone's been here, though," said Britton, in his
deep tones. "That is, if the safe is not as you last saw it."</p>

<p>"Open it. Quick!" commanded the Tiger, his voice showing the
excitement under which he laboured. With trembling hands Smeardon
worked the combination and pulled open the door. Inside lay the
package. The Tiger stretched over Smeardon's shoulder and took it
from the safe. He examined it carefully and then passed it to
Smeardon.</p>

<p>"It hasn't been tampered with so far as I can see. Now get to
business."</p>

<p>Smeardon advanced a pace towards the girl. She still lay back in
her chair as if unconscious of her surroundings. "By Jove! Polly's
in a bad way," exclaimed Britton. "Here, let's get rid of that
veil."</p>

<p>The Tiger barred the way as he advanced towards Polly.</p>

<p>"Time enough, Tom," he observed, firmly. "Speak up Polly. It's
only a sentence."</p>

<p>Supporting herself by the edge of the desk, Polly rose to her
feet. Once, twice, thrice, she attempted to speak, and each time
the words failed to come. Again she made the attempt, and then fell
face forward across the table. The three men sprang forward. The
Tiger was the first to reach her and, lifting her in his arms,
carried her to the lounge.</p>

<p>"Poor girl," he muttered. "Something must have happened to upset
her in this manner."</p>

<p>With tender fingers he loosened the veil round her head. When he
saw her face, he stepped back in amazement. The other two pressed
forward at his exclamation. On the lounge lay a strange girl.</p>

<p>"Where the hell's Polly?" exclaimed Britton.</p>

<p>"Who's this girl?" asked the Tiger. "Do you know anything of
her, Matt?"</p>

<p>Smeardon bent close and carefully examined the girl's features.
At first he shook his head doubtfully, then he looked again, and a
faint recollection came on his mind. Where had he seen her before?
Then came illumination.</p>

<p>"It's the girl who visited Merrivale the night I threw the stone
through his window," he muttered, turning to the Tiger.
"It's--"</p>

<p>"The real Olga Pellet," exclaimed the Tiger. "How did she come
here?"</p>

<p>"Looks as if she came after the package, Tiger," said Britton
casually. "Better lock it up again, Matt, in case she wants it when
she comes round."</p>

<p>Smeardon shuffled to the table and, taking the package back to
the safe, swung the door shut. Britton was looking at the
Tiger.</p>

<p>"If this is Olga Pellet," said the Tiger, half to himself, "what
has become of Polly?"</p>

<p>The girl on the lounge stirred slightly. The Tiger bent over her
and forced some brandy between her lips. With a cough and a moan
the girl opened her eyes and looked up into his face.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" she asked faintly. Then, after a pause, "Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"You are in the house of the late Mr. Ezra Greed, in Pontin
Square," answered the Tiger, gently. "I am a friend of his
secretary, Mr. Matthew Smeardon."</p>

<p>The girl sat up and put her hands to her hair. The Tiger watched
her for a moment and then asked her abruptly.</p>

<p>"Where is Polly?"</p>

<p>"Polly? Polly who?" asked the girl, with a puzzled frown. She
looked round the room and finally her eyes settled on Smeardon,
where he stood before the safe. She arose from the couch and walked
unsteadily towards him.</p>

<p>"You are Matthew Smeardon," she said in clear tones, her cheeks
now stained with a dark flush. "I am Olga Mary Pellet, the niece
of--"</p>

<p>Across her words cut the clear tones of the clock. She hesitated
and appeared to be counting the strokes. Nine times it struck while
she waited, her eyes fixed on Smeardon's downcast face.</p>

<p>"Too late, I'm afraid my dear Miss Pellet," the old secretary
said, with an evil smile. "Perhaps you will have better luck next
time."</p>

<p>"Too late," the girl repeated with a moan. Then she staggered to
the desk and, burying her face in her arms, sobbed bitterly.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter XIII.</h2>

<p>The three men stood and looked at the weeping girl for some
minutes, in silence. Then the Tiger beckoned to Britton and walked
out of the room. Smeardon followed them to the hall.</p>

<p>"What am I to do with her?" he asked, pointing over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Get rid of her, of course," replied the Tiger, briefly. "And,
by the way Matt, if Polly should turn up, keep her here and
telephone me at the usual place. Remember she is not to leave this
house until I return."</p>

<p>Smeardon watched the two men walk down the square until they
were swallowed up in the darkness. When he returned to the study he
found the girl standing before the glass, arranging her hat and
veil.</p>

<p>"Going?" asked Smeardon, gruffly.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," replied the girl listlessly. "There is nothing
that can be done now."</p>

<p>Smeardon did not answer. He was looking at the girl with a
peculiar expression in his eyes. His hands, hanging down his sides
were clasping and unclasping nervously.</p>

<p>"Nothing to do now." he replied with a dry chuckle. "No my dear.
There's nothing doing here at any time on your account."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Olga turned to him swiftly.</p>

<p>"Mean?" asked Smeardon leering at her across the desk. "Isn't it
plain to you? You're not Olga Mary Pellet."</p>

<p>The girl stared at him in amazement, her cheeks flushing red.
Her listlessness had disappeared and she was on the alert to defend
her rights.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" her voice was little above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Know!" Smeardon gave a snort of contempt. "I know Miss Pellet
and you're not her."</p>

<p>"You mean that girl I saw in Mr. Waverill's office. The girl
that man to-night called Polly."</p>

<p>"That's her," chuckled Smeardon. "That's her."</p>

<p>"She is not Olga Pellet." The girl stamped her foot angrily to
emphasise the denial. "Why, no one believes in her."</p>

<p>"No one? Who's 'no one?'" queried Smeardon, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Mr. Merrivale or Mr. Waverill."</p>

<p>"Oh. Then you've been discussing our Polly with them, have you?
Well they don't know much. You may take my word for it, she's the
one who'll get the papers and claim the money."</p>

<p>Olga looked at the man before her with some contempt.</p>

<p>"You almost gave me the papers to-night," she observed
quietly.</p>

<p>"True, my girl," chuckled Smeardon. "But you didn't get them. It
was a good try, but it won't work again."</p>

<p>The girl hesitated a moment and then seated herself in one of
the lounge chairs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it may interest you to know, Mr. Smeardon, that
'Polly,' as you call her, will not get those papers."</p>

<p>"No?" Smeardon came round the desk. "Perhaps you know just why
and how Polly failed to call here tonight and why you happened
along."</p>

<p>"Surely the latter requires no explanation." replied the girl
contemptuously. "Your questions regarding Polly I shall not
answer."</p>

<p>Smeardon sprang forward, menacingly.</p>

<p>"By God! I've half a mind to wring an answer from you," he
snarled.</p>

<p>"You haven't even half that mind," retorted the girl. "If you
had, you dare not. The man you call Trantor is your master and you
dare not disobey him."</p>

<p>The eyes of the man and the girl met and the man lowered his. He
returned to the desk and seated himself on the corner.</p>

<p>"Look here, my girl," he said quietly. "It's about time you and
I came to an understanding. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Olga Mary Pellet," replied the girl promptly.</p>

<p>"Are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The girl nodded her head, emphatically.</p>

<p>"I'm half inclined to believe you," mused Smeardon.</p>

<p>"In spite of Polly?" sarcastically enquired Olga.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. The question is to know how I am to believe you."</p>

<p>"You are ambiguous, Mr. Smeardon."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>Smeardon sat forward, peering at the girl with his short-sighted
eyes. Olga made a pretty picture leaning back against the dark
leather of the chair, her face dimly lit by the light from the
table lamp, now the only light in the room. Smeardon recognised her
charm and a dull flush mounted to his face.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there are conditions under which we can understand each
other," he said at length. "Mind, I only said 'perhaps.'"</p>

<p>"We might try," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"You know how I am situated here," continued the old secretary,
speaking slowly, and studying the girl as he muttered his words,
"Your uncle trusted me. He made a fool will. The will of a madman,
but it placed the power in my hands. He left his fortune in my
care. No one can get that fortune except by my favour, and I am to
be convinced that the person who applies for it is the right
person."</p>

<p>"You are not convinced that I am the right person?" queried
Olga.</p>

<p>"I'm not. I won't say but what you can't convince me."</p>

<p>"If I convince you, what becomes of Polly?" Olga could not help
the very feminine question.</p>

<p>"Cut Polly out of this," answered Smeardon, quickly. "It's the
matter of you and me now. Suppose you convince me you are the right
heiress. Where do I come in?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, Mr. Smeardon."</p>

<p>"You understand me well enough, girl," said Smeardon, with a
queer laugh. "But I'll talk plainer. What do I get if I hand over
to you the package of the Nine Stars?"</p>

<p>"You have your legacy."</p>

<p>"A measly ten thousand and you get millions," sneered Smeardon.
"That's no good to me."</p>

<p>Olga thought quickly. Here was an opportunity to get possession
of the papers without delay and trouble. She had been very lucky
that night. But for that attack of faintness she would have secured
the papers. Her chance had passed. Would it come again? She had
seen the mastermind behind the plotting for the fortune. He had
impressed her with his strength of will. Could she fight him and
beat him? She did not think so.</p>

<p>And now this man was offering to turn traitor to his associates.
He was offering her the fortune. If she took this offer she would
be able to go to the lawyer in the morning and claim the estate by
virtue of the package of the Nine Stars. But the conditions of the
will had not been fulfilled. It would be impossible to fulfil them
for another month. But did it matter? This man, a thorough rogue,
would open the safe and give her the package. Who was to say that
she had not obtained it between the stipulated hours. Surely not
Trantor and Britton. They dared not acknowledge that they were
interested in the matter. There would only be this man Smeardon and
herself to question. He would, for his own sake, say that he had
given her the package in accordance with the terms of the will. It
was the easy way.</p>

<p>"What of those men?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Trantor and the other. Britton, I think you called him.
What will they want?"</p>

<p>Smeardon made a gesture almost of fear. The movement was
involuntary and he recovered his composure quickly.</p>

<p>"I told you, this was between you and I. They're not in
this."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want?"</p>

<p>Smeardon rose and stood over the girl, bending until his hot
breath touched her cheek. Olga drew back in her chair with a
shudder of repulsion. She tried to meet his eyes, but could
not.</p>

<p>"You're a girl after my own heart," he said slowly and thickly,
his eyes sweeping over her and noting every line and curve of her
figure. "You are a girl I could admire and work with. I'll deal
fair with you. By heavens, I will. You're a pretty girl--one of the
prettiest I've ever set eyes on. I'm fond of pretty girls and they
can get anything out of me--if they're kind to me."</p>

<p>He broke off with a hoarse chuckle and his hands came down
quickly and covered hers as they lay on her knees.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty girl and you shall have your fortune. Matthew
Smeardon will give it to you. Aye, every cent of it. I'll open that
safe, my girl, and give you the package that lies there. The
package of the Nine Stars. Ah, your eyes are sparkling now. You
know what that means. It means money and power. Plenty of fine
clothes and rich food. Plenty of soft nice things that make life
for pretty girls like you. You shall have fine houses and fine
friends. Think, girl, think. Seven millions of money. Think of the
gold, the gold that glitters so beautifully. Think of the heaps and
heaps of gold you can make with seven millions. I love gold,
beautiful, beautiful gold, but I love pretty girls also."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment and his hands pressed into her knees. Her
whole frame revolted from this man, but she sat quiet, fascinated,
unable to move.</p>

<p>"And the condition. Just a little one. Not worth considering.
Matthew Smeardon is not a bad chap. He's always willing to do what
he can for a pretty girl and not ask much. Aye, you're looking at
me now, you want to know what Matt wants. I'll tell you. It isn't
much. He doesn't want your money, pretty one. No no. He gives you
the money. All of it. Think of it. All the money. Money that would
make a king appear a beggar, and you will give him what he wants.
Won't you pretty one. He only wants love. Just your love. You can
give him that for all the money he will give you. You will. Of
course you will. Any girl would love me if I gave them seven
millions of money. Ah, I want you, you pretty little thing. I want
to have you, to cuddle you tight in my arms. To fondle you, to
touch your pretty body. To have you for my own.
Mine--mine--mine."</p>

<p>His voice had risen to a shriek. His hands clutched hers and
drew her up from the chair to him. She felt his arms close round
her, straining her to him. For a moment she was powerless in his
grasp, and with a sudden effort she wrenched herself free.</p>

<p>"No, No, No," she screamed. "I'd die first."</p>

<p>Smeardon staggered back, his eyes blazing with greed and desire.
Olga ran to the door and fled down the hall. Smeardon followed and
almost caught her as she fumbled with the latch, but she fought
free again and stumbled down the steps. Out in the quiet square she
turned and looked towards the house. Smeardon stood in the doorway,
his face quivering with passion and anger. He waved his hands over
his head towards her.</p>

<p>"Then say goodbye to your fortune, Olga Pellet," he shrieked.
"Say goodbye to it, for it shall never be yours."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter XIV.</h2>

<p>The failure of Polly to keep the appointment on the night of the
new moon had caused the Tiger much anxiety, for he was genuinely
fond of the girl, who had worked with him since her childhood. The
dramatic appearance of Olga Pellet in disguise, induced him to
believe that some serious accident had prevented Polly keeping the
appointment. Directly he left the house, he and Britton had
searched for her, but without success. With the disappearance of
Polly, the plans of the gang had come to a standstill. Without the
girl they could not obtain possession of the fortune, for they
dared not substitute another girl for her. If they failed to find
her, they must give up all hope of acquiring the Gleed estate. But
the Tiger would not give up hope. They had failed so far, but there
remained a month before the next new moon. In that time he would
find Polly and so frame his plans that there should be no further
hitch.</p>

<p>Determining in the first place to find Polly, the Tiger set the
complex machinery of the underworld in action. Every rogue,
receiver, gangster and lounger in the country was advised. Woman
after woman was tracked and identified, but Polly had disappeared
without a trace.</p>

<p>A week passed and the Tiger had almost lost hope, yet Smeardon
urged to further efforts with a strange determination he had never
before shown in the plans of the gang. The Tiger watched him
carefully, but could find no reason for the man's action. In the
past he had always been a waverer, afraid of the police, afraid of
his own shadow.</p>

<p>Britton, never a plotter, was openly suspicious of Smeardon. He
urged the Tiger to have the latter watched, and himself spent most
of his time keeping an observant eye on the old secretary. Yet he
could find nothing to confirm his suspicions. Smeardon acted as if
his sole ambition was to recover Polly and secure the Gleed
millions.</p>

<p>Half convinced, by Britton's urging, that the secret of the
mystery lay with Smeardon, the Tiger tried to draw the old
secretary into intimacy. It was conduct foreign to the Tiger's
usual methods for he always held the members of the gang at arm's
length. Now he talked over his plans with Smeardon and asked his
advice. In days past, Smeardon would have eagerly grasped the
friendship offered to him. Now he sat silent and brooding, eager
only when the discussion turned to the search for Polly and the
plans for the next full moon night.</p>

<p>"Say, Matt," said Britton, suddenly, when the three were seated
around the study table. "What's the matter? Goin' to give the gang
the go-bye?"</p>

<p>Smeardon, roused from the reverie into which he had drifted,
gazed at his questioner silently.</p>

<p>"Don't come those games with me," continued Britton savagely.
"I'm not in love with you. Are you planning to give the gang the
cold end of the stick?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" asked Smeardon, only catching half the question. "What
about the stick, Tom."</p>

<p>"Can't you answer a straight question without all that humming
and haa-ing. I asked, what's your pretty game now?"</p>

<p>"No game," replied Smeardon meekly.</p>

<p>"Why can't you give me a proper answer," roared Britton, working
himself to a passion.</p>

<p>"That will do, Tom," warned the Tiger.</p>

<p>"What're you giving us?" growled Britton, subdued under the
Tiger's glance. "Can't I get a civil answer to my question?"</p>

<p>"He's answered you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Tom," said Smeardon humbly. "I didn't catch your
question the first time."</p>

<p>"You did the second, and made a devil of a fuss over a plain
answer. Don't think I have forgotten you during the last four
years."</p>

<p>"What do yon mean by that?" asked Smeardon, now on his feet and
pale with fear and anger.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean, you cur. You didn't go into the box and
swear away the life of the Tiger and me. Lucky for the Tiger you
didn't. He'd have not got off as he did if you had. No you're too
wise a guy to commit yourself like that. You sneaked behind the
backs of the narks. Put them wise on the game. And it was one of
your own particular games too you split on."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!"</p>

<p>"Lie, do I?" Britton's hand stole towards his hip pocket.</p>

<p>Smeardon stood in the centre of the room, his eyes wandering
from Britton to the Tiger. The latter sat watchful.</p>

<p>"Ain't you going to answer me?" demanded Britton, half out of
his chair. "Easy enough to call a man a liar, but you've got to go
further than that."</p>

<p>"I said it's a lie, and I say it again." Smeardon was now boldly
facing the situation, urged on by his fear of what might happen if
he gave way.</p>

<p>"And I say you're a police pimp. Get that, you miserable
sneaking cur."</p>

<p>"I am not a police spy." Smeardon was shaking as if with
ague.</p>

<p>"And I say you are."</p>

<p>"You're a liar."</p>

<p>The words came involuntarily from Smeardon's lips. He could not
help himself although he knew the consequences. It was one thing to
say a statement was a lie and another to call a gangster a liar.
Britton was out of his chair now and his hand came swiftly from his
pocket. Just as swiftly the Tiger acted. With a quick wrench the
weapon flew from the man's hand and struck the book case. Britton
struggled for a moment, and then, at the Tiger's command, subsided
into his chair.</p>

<p>"That's the end of it," commanded the Tiger, firmly. "You
brought this on yourself, Matt. Here we have been panning all the
evening and you never saying a word."</p>

<p>"Planning!" echoed Smeardon with a shrill laugh. "Where are our
plans? Gone to the four winds of heaven. Is that all you have
against me Tiger?"</p>

<p>"Well. Isn't it enough?"</p>

<p>"Schemes!" cried Smeardon. His nerve had entirely gone under the
sudden strain. "All your schemes have failed. Where is the girl?
You planned it. I was to produce the papers, you the girl. There
are the papers. Where is the girl?"</p>

<p>"Damned foolishness, I say," growled Britton viciously. "Why
don't you hand over the papers. Never mind this fal-lal of the full
moon. Give us the papers, we'll see about the girl."</p>

<p>"There's a lot in what Tom suggests," observed the Tiger,
slowly. "Let's have the papers, Matt." Smeardon looked from one man
to the other, "If I give you the papers where do I come in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it Matt." The Tiger swung on him quickly. "You know
the agreement. Don't you trust me?"</p>

<p>"Trust you!" exclaimed Smeardon, thrusting his face close to the
Tiger's. "Did you trust me when that man accused me of giving you
away to the police? You--"</p>

<p>"Shut your head!" commanded Britton, springing to his feet.
"What are you listening to his gab for. Get the papers Tiger, or I
will."</p>

<p>Smeardon backed round the table as Britton advanced to the safe.
He watched the man search for and find the spring that worked the
bookcase. The crook bent to the safe and then stood back.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" he ejaculated. "There is witchcraft here."</p>

<p>The Tiger sprang to his safe. On the door of the safe were now
two shining stars.</p>

<p>"What does this mean Matt?" demanded the Tiger. "I don't know,"
replied Smeardon, who had come across the room to the safe. "I
know, however, that the safe is dangerous to be played about with
and Tom interferes with it at his own risk."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed Britton, "I'm not to be put off with that
yarn. What's the word Tiger."</p>

<p>"Give him the word, Matt," commanded the master crook. "If you
don't, he will open it his own way."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" said Smeardon, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Have a look at that package."</p>

<p>"Will you give it me back after."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Smeardon pushed Britton aside and opened the safe. As the door
swung open Britton seized the package of the Nine Stars and carried
it to the table. The three men gathered round looking down at the
package that held the destiny of almost untold wealth.</p>

<p>"Its your job, Tiger," whispered Britton at length. The Tiger
took some tools from his pocket and in a short time had a matrix of
the seal. Then, heating his pen-knife in the fire, he raised the
seal from the envelope. A few moments more, and the package lay
open on the desk. The Tiger drew out the papers and spread them on
the desk. One by one he turned them over, examining both sides of
the sheet. They were all blank.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter XV.</h2>

<p>The package of the Nine Stars contained only blank papers. The
three men stared in amazement. Then the Tiger carefully collected
them again and subjected them to a thorough test for secret
writing. At the end the papers remained blank.</p>

<p>"Try the envelope," suggested Britton. "There must be something
somewhere."</p>

<p>The Tiger turned his attention to the envelope that had
contained the papers. He subjected it to a close scrutiny and then
tried the tests for secret writing, but in vain. Neither the paper
or the envelope that contained them gave any clue to the Gleed
estate.</p>

<p>"What do you make of this, Smeardon?" asked the Tiger,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It's a mystery," answered Smeardon.</p>

<p>"What's your part in this mystery?" demanded Britton.</p>

<p>"Don't start that again," interrupted the Tiger. "This is the
same envelope that Matt showed me the first time. He's not playing
any tricks here."</p>

<p>"Who's starting what?" demanded Britton, angrily. "Say what you
like, Tiger, I don't' trust Matt Smeardon an inch and you'll say
the same if you tell the truth."</p>

<p>"What are you accusing me of now?" asked Smeardon, sharply.</p>

<p>"Of trying to ditch us, of course. Any child could see what you
are playing at."</p>

<p>Britton was leaning over the table his face thrust forward
towards Smeardon aggressively.</p>

<p>"I'm through with it," exclaimed Smeardon, angrily. "Either
Britton goes out of the game or I."</p>

<p>"Just as I thought." retorted Britten, quickly. "He's only been
waiting a favourable opportunity to ditch us. Who's your pet, Matt
Smeardon, the girl or the lawyer?"</p>

<p>Seated at the table between the two men the Tiger had watched
the quarrel warily. Deeming Smeardon not only untrustworthy but a
potential traitor, he had not been unwilling that Britton should
bait him. Something might be said in the heat of anger that might
give a clue to past and present happenings.</p>

<p>"What's your answer, Tiger?" repeated Smeardon. "Him or I?"</p>

<p>"What of these papers?" queried the Tiger, not choosing to
declare himself on one side or the other.</p>

<p>"They're mine." Smeardon covered the papers with his hand.</p>

<p>"You go and we'll hold the papers," shouted Britton, covering
Smeardon's hand with his.</p>

<p>With a cry of rage Smeardon hit out with his free hand to
Britton's face. Britton gave ground and then sprang at Smeardon.
Quick as had been the happenings, the Tiger was quicker. With a
sudden thrust he forced the table forward and stood between the two
men.</p>

<p>"This must stop, boys," he said authoritatively. "Shake hands,
both of you."</p>

<p>There was some hesitation, but the Tiger had ruled so long that
on his repeating the command the men assumed a more peaceful
demeanour. Britton was the first to make a move. He stretched out a
huge hand across the table to Smeardon. The latter would not see
the hand, but turned his back and walked to the fireplace. The
Tiger repeated his command, this time addressing Smeardon by
name.</p>

<p>"I'm through with this foolishness," said Smeardon, without
turning round. "Tom Britton and I cannot work together. Either he
or I go."</p>

<p>Britton was about to reply angrily, but the Tiger silenced him
with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Then you draw out, Matt."</p>

<p>"If you choose Britton to me."</p>

<p>"And the Gleed millions?"</p>

<p>Smeardon laughed bitterly as he pointed to the table.</p>

<p>"We stand a good chance for them," he remarked. "Polly gone,
heaven knows where, and the package a blank. No, I'll stand
straight now. There's ten thousand in it for me, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Polly may be found."</p>

<p>"Well if she is, there's those papers. It's no good Tiger, we're
done this time."</p>

<p>"I choose to think otherwise."</p>

<p>"What's the good?"</p>

<p>The Tiger drew the table to its original position and then
gathered the papers together.</p>

<p>"Sit down Britton," he said quietly. "Matt, come and help me put
this package together again."</p>

<p>Smeardon shrugged his shoulders but obeyed. For some time they
worked swiftly but cleverly. At the end, the Tiger heated the wax
of the seal and pressed on it the matrix he had prepared.</p>

<p>"That will do," he said as he surveyed their handiwork. "Put it
back, Matt."</p>

<p>"You'll let him keep it?" exclaimed Britton, springing to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'm through," said Britton, striding to the door? "You'll
know where to find me if you want me for anything else, Tiger."</p>

<p>Smeardon watched Britton leave the room with sombre eyes. Then
he took the package and went to the safe. He placed the package in
its original position and then swung the door to. As the bolts
clanged he started back with a cry. The Tiger rushed to his side
but at sight of the safe door he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>On the door of the safe shone three white stars.</p>

<p>"It's witchcraft," said the Tiger under his breath, a wave of
superstitious awe creeping over him.</p>

<p>Smeardon had backed to the centre of the room, his eyes covered
with his hands. The Tiger knelt down and carefully examined the
surface of the safe. The stars were real yet he could not tell how
they had come there. He tried to rub them out but could not do so.
Thoughtfully he pushed the bookcase back into place.</p>

<p>"Can you explain those stars, Matt?" he asked, at length.</p>

<p>"No. Can you?"</p>

<p>"Old Ezra Gleed was a cleverer man than I thought," mused the
Tiger. "What do those stars mean?" He thought for some minutes and
then turned to Smeardon. "Come Matt, you want a drink, and so do
I."</p>

<p>Smeardon uncovered his face and went to the sideboard. "There's
drink here,"' he said thickly. "What will you have?"</p>

<p>"Brandy," replied the Tiger briefly. "It will steady our nerves,
and they want it."</p>

<p>"It's all gone." replied Smeardon, after a search. "If you will
come and hold a light, I will get some more from the cellar."</p>

<p>Taking a bunch of keys from the desk, Smeardon led the way to
the cellars. There, in ordered array, lay hundreds of bottles. The
Tiger gave an appreciative glance around.</p>

<p>"Plenty to drink here, Matt," he observed, as he followed the
secretary to a far corner.</p>

<p>"Old Gleed was one of the finest judges of wine in the United
Kingdom," replied Smeardon. "When this is sold up it will bring in
a small fortune on its own."</p>

<p>"And until then you help yourself??"</p>

<p>"Naturally! Here we are. There's a dozen different brands, so
help yourself."</p>

<p>The The Tiger looked over the bins studying the bottles. Finally
he made his choice.</p>

<p>"We'll try this. It looks..."</p>

<p>The sound of a pistol shot startled him. Without a word he
sprang to the foot of the cellar steps. For some minutes the two
men stood listening, but there was no further sound to be heard.
The upper part of the house was again wrapped in silence. Motioning
to Smeardon not to make a noise, the Tiger crept up the steps and
along into the hall. It was in darkness except for a thin pencil of
light that came from under the study door.</p>

<p>"I swear I left the light in the hall burning," whispered
Smeardon in his leader's ear.</p>

<p>"Got your iron?" queried the Tiger in a whisper?</p>

<p>Smeardon went to the study door and turned the handle. The door
refused to open.</p>

<p>"It's locked."</p>

<p>Pushing Smeardon onto one side, the Tiger tried the door. He
flung his weight against it, but it would not move.</p>

<p>"Light," he said to Smeardon across his shoulder.</p>

<p>Smeardon fumbled on the wall for the switch. A click and the
hall was flooded with light. Then the Tiger produced a bunch of
keys and bent to the lock. A moment and the door swung open.</p>

<p>The Tiger walked carefully into the room, followed by Smeardon.
At first the room appeared to be as they had left it a few minutes
before. Then Smeardon exclaimed and pointed to the bookcase. It had
been swung out and three stars gleamed brightly on the door of the
safe. The Tiger walked swiftly to the safe. On the floor at the
foot of the safe was the huddled form of a man. Hastily the Tiger
rolled him over. It was Tom Britton.</p>

<p>"God!" exclaimed the Tiger under his breath. "So that is what he
meant."</p>

<p>A dark stain was slowly spreading on the carpet. The Tiger bent
closer. Just above the right ear was a tiny bullet hole from which
flowed the crimson stream. He placed his hand over the heart, but
there was no movement. Tom Britton was dead.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter XVI.</h2>

<p>The eyes of the men met across the body of Britton. What was Tom
Britton doing in this room he had left but a few minutes before,
swearing never to return? Who had fired the fatal shot!</p>

<p>One of the questions was easy to answer. Tom Britton had never
left the house. Now, the Tiger could remember hearing the closing
of the street door after Tom had left the study. His departure had
been but a blind to deceive Smeardon. He had never intended to
leave the house. Probably he had concealed himself somewhere in the
hall--he had waited until they had left the room and then crept
back to the study to steal the package of the Nine Stars.</p>

<p>So far the Tiger reasoned out the happenings of the first
quarter of an hour. But who else had been concealed in the house?
Who had fired the fatal shot?</p>

<p>Leaving the body, he commenced a search of the room. The windows
were shut and hasped, and there was only one door to the room--the
one they had found locked. He examined the carpet and the body, and
then, with the aid of Smeardon, made a thorough search for the
weapon. He could not find it. When he had completed his search he
went across to the bookcase and wheeled it into position. To do
this he had to move the body slightly, but he was careful, not to
move the head from the stain on the carpet.</p>

<p>"Get the police, Matt," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"The police!" Smeardon lifted his eyes in startled enquiry.</p>

<p>"The police are useful sometimes," replied the Tiger with a wry
grin. "Let them take charge. We don't want to have to dispose of
that."</p>

<p>"What am I to say?"</p>

<p>"Say? Tell the truth--for once. Tell them I was calling on you
and we went to the cellar to get some more drink. We heard a shot
and found this on our return."</p>

<p>"Tom was here to-night!"</p>

<p>"Have sense, man," came the quick rejoinder. "We have not seen
him before to-day."</p>

<p>"Smeardon left the house on his errand. The Tiger stood looking
down at the dead man for some time. He was puzzled, and could not
see any clue to the mystery.</p>

<p>"I wonder what your game was?" he muttered, addressing the dead
man, lying full in the rays of the electric light. "You accuse Matt
of playing the traitor. You work up a quarrel and then you return
to obtain the package of the Nine Stars. There's a shot and we
return from the cellars to find you dead. Why did you want that
package? You knew what was in it. Simply a sheaf of worthless
papers. What did you know? Were those papers so worthless? I
wonder. Were you cleverer than I, this time, Tom?"</p>

<p>"And who killed you?" he continued, talking partly to himself,
and partly to the dead man. "Who fired that shot? Who was with you?
None of our crowd, I swear. Besides you never left the house. Then
the person who fired the shot was not working with you? He, or she,
must also have been after the package. Now who could it have been?
Merrivale? No, it is to his interest that the package remains in
the safe. Polly? No she would have thought Tom was working under my
directions. Olga Pellet? More probable; but if she did, how did she
get out of the room leaving the door locked on the inside?"</p>

<p>He heard a key grate in the hall door lock, and Smeardon entered
the study, followed by a police inspector. The officer glanced
quickly round the room, and then his eyes fastened on the
Tiger.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trantor was here when I found the body," said Smeardon, in
explanation.</p>

<p>The Tiger nodded insolently at this half introduction. Taking no
notice of him, the Inspector went across to the body and satisfied
himself the man was dead. After that he made a survey of the room
from wall to wall. Then he seated himself at the desk and for some
moments remained, lost an thought.</p>

<p>"Where were you when you heard the shot?" he asked the Tiger
suddenly.</p>

<p>"In the cellar."</p>

<p>"Mr. Smeardon tells me you both left the room to fetch a bottle
of wine. Did either of you lock the door behind you?"</p>

<p>"I shut the door but I did not lock it," answered the Tiger.</p>

<p>"It was locked when you returned?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who opened it?"</p>

<p>"I did," replied the Tiger promptly. The Inspector went to the
door and examined the lock.</p>

<p>"An expert in this business?"</p>

<p>"Purely an amateur."</p>

<p>The Tiger made the answer as insolent as he dared.</p>

<p>"Where was the key?"</p>

<p>"In the door. Inside."</p>

<p>"In the lock?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you moved the body?"</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Were the curtains drawn?"</p>

<p>"Just as they are now."</p>

<p>The officer went to the window and again examined the
fastenings. Satisfied, he returned to the desk.</p>

<p>"Door locked, windows fastened, curtains drawn, no other
ingress," commented the officer to himself. "Body on back, before
bookcase. Anything to attract him there?"</p>

<p>He crossed the room to the bookcase and carefully scanned the
titles.</p>

<p>"Nothing there in his line," he muttered, returning to the desk
again. For a few moments he remained in thought, and then he took
up his inquisition of the Tiger.</p>

<p>"Your name is Trantor?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Christian name?"</p>

<p>"William."</p>

<p>"Address?"</p>

<p>"114 Great Southwick Street, W."</p>

<p>"Where have I seen you before?"</p>

<p>"Really, my dear man, I meet so many people." Again the eyes of
the policeman and the crook met and the latter gave way.</p>

<p>"At the Old Bailey?"</p>

<p>The Tiger sprang to his feet, his fists clenched. The Inspector
waved him back to his seat.</p>

<p>"Its no good, Tiger. I know you," he observed quietly. "Who is
this man?" he pointed to the body.</p>

<p>"Tom Britton." answered the Tiger sullenly.</p>

<p>"Recently released on ticket of leave. Friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"I knew him."</p>

<p>"Friend of his?"</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded towards Smeardon.</p>

<p>"He can speak for himself!" growled the Tiger.</p>

<p>The Inspector looked at Smeardon interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I knew him." answered Smeardon.</p>

<p>"Intimately?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What did you quarrel with him about?" said the Inspector
suddenly, after a pause.</p>

<p>Smeardon looked up, alarmed.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Its no good Matthew Smeardon." said the Inspector quickly. "You
are trying to throw dust in my eyes. The three of you have been
intimate for years. When Tom Britton was released I set a watch on
him. He went direct to you, Tiger, and you brought him here to
Smeardon. Now I find him here murdered. When did either of you see
him last?"</p>

<p>"He was here to-night." said Smeardon, breaking down under the
force of the Inspector's knowledge.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought so. Now, perhaps we shall get at something
definite. Which of you shot him?"</p>

<p>"Neither," quavered Smeardon. "He came here to-night with the
Tiger and left a few minutes before we went down stairs."</p>

<p>"Its a poor tale." commented the Inspector. "Let me construct it
for you. You say the Tiger brought him here. You and he quarrelled.
He left the house. You and the Tiger went to the cellars to get a
bottle of wine. You heard a shot and returned to find the door
locked, and opened it. You found Tom Britton dead. Now, that door
has never been locked. There is not a sign that it has been opened
or locked except with the key. Let us try again. Which of you
quarrelled with him?"</p>

<p>Smeardon was about to repeat his denial, when the Inspector
interrupted.</p>

<p>"It's no good repeating that denial, Smeardon. There was a
quarrel. See. This table has been violently pushed along the
carpet. Now, one of you, tell me the truth."</p>

<p>"We had words," admitted Smeardon reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Inspector. "Which of you?"</p>

<p>"He wanted me to part with some papers."</p>

<p>"The Gleed papers?"</p>

<p>"What do you know of, them." Smeardon jumped to his feet,
thoroughly astonished.</p>

<p>"That's my business." snapped the Inspector. "You may take it
that I know quite a lot, and will know the rest before I am
finished."</p>

<p>Smeardon sat down again, glancing at the Tiger. The latter was
sitting back in his chair with his legs crossed but there was a
furtive watchful gleam in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Britton wanted you to hand over certain of the Gleed papers.
Which?"</p>

<p>"As you know so much," snarled Smeardon, "you may as well know
the rest. He wanted the package of the Nine Stars."</p>

<p>"You did not give it to him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"In the safe."</p>

<p>The Inspector glanced round the room. Interpreting his glance,
Smeardon went to the bookcase and released the spring, revealing
the safe. The Inspector came to his side.</p>

<p>"Was this open or shut when you found Britton."</p>

<p>"Open."</p>

<p>"Then yon lied when you told me the room was as you found it. Is
the package still there?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Open the safe."</p>

<p>Smeardon released the combination and drew open the door. The
Inspector reached over his shoulder and took up the package of the
Nine Stars. He carried it to the desk, beckoning Smeardon to follow
him.</p>

<p>"Do you think that safe was opened by Britton?"</p>

<p>"No, he did not open it."</p>

<p>"This package is as you last saw it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Last time you saw this package, who was here?"</p>

<p>"Trantor, Britton and myself."</p>

<p>The Inspector extended his hand palm upwards to the two men. On
his hand lay a large matrix. He turned it over, revealing a seal of
the Nine Stars.</p>

<p>"What did you use this for?"</p>

<p>Neither man answered. After a pause the Inspector repeated his
question.</p>

<p>"You three men opened this package. You, Smeardon, and Britton
quarrelled over the contents. You, Tiger, backed Smeardon and the
package was remade and returned to the safe. Britton determined to
gain possession of the papers, and while you were out of the room
returned and opened the safe. One of yon caught him in the act and
shot him."</p>

<p>"It's a lie. I deny it all. I was not here. Trantor will tell
you so." Smeardon was on his feet, quivering with fear, his face
livid. The Inspector leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Matthew Smeardon, I arrest you for the wilful murder of Thomas
Britton. I warn you that any statement you may make may be used
against you."</p>

<p>The Tiger started to his feet, his right hand behind his back.
The Inspector, without taking his eyes from Smeardon, held out his
hand.</p>

<p>"I'll take that gun, Tiger," he said quietly. "You, too, are
under arrest as accessory to the murder of Britton."</p>

<p>As the Inspector spoke a loud knocking was heard at the front
door.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter XVII.</h2>

<p>"That pistol, please," repeated the Inspector.</p>

<p>The Tiger deliberately brought his hand round, empty. Then he
walked to the door.</p>

<p>"Stop," commanded the Inspector.</p>

<p>The Tiger halted at the door and looked round to the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"Mr. Inspector," he said coolly, "I will not say you are
exceeding your authority in arresting me as an accessory to the
murder of my friend, Tom Britton, but you are exceeding your
capability. I am quite as anxious as you to discover the murderer
of Tom Britton, but your methods are too crude. I can't work with
you, so I will play my own game. When I find him I don't think I
will require your services for the--er--final act. I am my own
judge and sometimes my own executioner."</p>

<p>He shut the door behind him and strolled to the street door.
There, as he expected, he found a couple of constables.</p>

<p>"Walk in, gentlemen," he said, urbanely. "Your Inspector is
waiting for you in the study."</p>

<p>They passed into the house just as the Inspector called out
again. One of the men rushed forward, and the other made as it to
stop the Tiger. The latter had the door by the handle and before
the constable could reach it slammed it shut behind him. He had but
a bare dozen yards start, as he turned out of the Square into
Malcolm Street. Fortunately for him it was after midnight and the
street was deserted. Running at top speed the Tiger swung suddenly
into the mews at the back of the houses in Pontin Square. In a dark
corner he stopped. Where was he to go? He knew the mews to be
blind, the only entry leading from Malcolm Street. He heard the
pursuit pass down Malcolm Street and cowered in his corner.</p>

<p>He reckoned up his chances as he stood in that corner. The odds
were against him. In a few moments the Inspector would realise that
the man he was hunting was not running before him. He would obtain
reinforcements and retrace his steps, searching out every possible
hiding place. The mews had served, as a hiding place so far, would
they serve further?</p>

<p>Creeping from the dark corner, the Tiger made his way up the
mews, his brain working at high pressure. Where could he hide? Not
in the mews, certainly. The police would return and search every
nook and corner. It was madness to go any further into the trap. He
looked up at the houses backing the mews. Could he gain sanctuary
there?</p>

<p>Mentally he swept the line of houses with his glance. He was now
standing opposite the next house to Ezra Gleed's. A plan began to
form in his mind. It was daring. Could he carry it through? He
walked to the fence at the foot of the yard of Gleed's house and
raised himself so that he could peer over. The yard was deserted
but for a number of old boxes and rubbish. The refuse Smeardon had
turned out after he had discharged the servants. A spring and he
was astride the fence. Noiselessly, he dropped into the yard. There
was no place to hide there, but already a better plan had formed in
his mind. By the light of his electric torch, he examined the lock
of the back door. It was a common one. His hand went to his pocket.
A moment, and the door swung quietly open.</p>

<p>His light swept the passage before him. There was no one
there--the whole of the basement of the house was deserted. He
closed the door behind him, leaving it so that he could retreat
easily if necessary. He was in the passage connecting the offices.
Below him were the cellars to which he had accompanied Smeardon
earlier that evening. Again his light swept the darkness. At the
end of the passage were stairs. He walked to them silently; they
led to the ground floor of the house. Listening, he could hear the
murmur of voices, above. Slowly, as a shadow, he mounted the stairs
until he reached the hallway. Then he stopped suddenly. He heard
the study door open and the heavy step of a policeman down the
hall. The front door opened and some people entered.</p>

<p>"All right, Watson?" It was the voice of the Inspector.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the constable addressed. "He's just as
you left him."</p>

<p>The study door opened and shut loudly. Only one man had entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Where's your man," asked a husky voice above.</p>

<p>"Lost him!"</p>

<p>"Go on! Why, he wasn't a dozen yards in front of you in the
Square."</p>

<p>"Well, we lost him. Not a shine of him at the corner."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's in the mews."</p>

<p>"Searched there. And ain't his nibs in a stew about it too."</p>

<p>Creeping upwards cautiously the Tiger got his head on a level
with the floor. He could see the study floor, but the late speakers
were evidently further down the passage for they were out of view.
The study door opened, and the Inspector re-appeared.</p>

<p>"Watson. Call a cab. We'll take this man to the station. Turner,
you stay here all night. I'll have you relieved in the morning.
I'll send for the body in an hour or so."</p>

<p>There was some stir above as the two men executed their orders.
A taxi drove up to the house and the study door opened and Smeardon
came out followed by the Inspector. The street door closed with a
bang and the constable left in charge went into the study and shut
the door.</p>

<p>The Tiger moved swiftly up into the hall. Not stopping there, he
mounted to the upper stories. Since he had entered the house he had
made two vows. One was the rescue of Smeardon, the other the
discovery of the murderer of Tom Britton. He was convinced this
murderer was concealed in the house. He could not have got away,
there had not been time. When he had fired the shot he must have
run upstairs and remained concealed throughout all the various
happenings below. Now the Tiger determined to hunt him out.
Slipping off his boots at the first landing the Tiger methodically
searched every room, but without result. Then, descending to the
basement, the Tiger searched this part of the house as thoroughly
as he had searched the upper rooms. Again, the Tiger crept up the
stairs and renewed his search in the reception rooms, on the ground
floor. Quietly he moved from room to room, without result, until
finally he stood before the study door.</p>

<p>Retrieving his boots the Tiger sat down on the stairs and
thought over the matter. He was disappointed in the result of his
search, for if he had found the murderer hiding in the house it
would have been an easy matter to betray him to the police and so
secure the release of Smeardon. But he had found no one in his
careful search, not even a clue that some person other than
themselves had been in the house that evening. The Tiger, sought in
his mind for a clue. Some starting point from which lie could work
to a solution of these mysteries.</p>

<p>The locked door! Why had he not thought of that before? When he
and Smeardon had run up from the cellars they had found the study
door locked. He had turned the key from the outside with one of the
delicate instruments he was so familiar with. There was no doubt
but that, when the murderer entered the study, he had turned the
key in the lock, and the iron might probably retain an impress of
the fingerprints of the man. He must have that key.</p>

<p>But to get that key he would have to go into the study, and
there sat a large-sized specimen of the Metropolitan Police Force.
What did that matter. It was but man to man, and his known audacity
would stand him in stead. He must act quickly, for had not the
Inspector spoke of sending to take the body away. He must have that
key and be off the premises before the mortuary coach arrived. Very
cautiously he approached the study and grasped the door-knob.</p>

<p>A quick wrench, a step forward, and he had the constable, who
had been half asleep in a comfortable chair, covered.</p>

<p>"Hands up! Quick!" The constable raised his hands above his
head, and the Tiger took another step into the room. His hand
fumbled with the door behind him, his eyes and attention given to
the man who sat, with open mouth staring at him. Ah! the key was in
his hand.</p>

<p>"Sorry to have disturbed you, constable," he said, cordially. "I
required the key of this door. Keep still and you will not get
hurt. Keep your hands up, I say. Now, we will make a bargain. Your
inspector is a stupid fool and wants to arrest me as an accessory
to the murder of a friend. I am just as anxious to discover who
killed my friend as the Inspector is, but I cannot co-operate in
the search with a man of your Inspector's low mentality. Keep your
hands up, please. Thanks! I shall wait in the hall an indefinite
number of minutes. If you come into the hall before I go you will
run up against this. See? My best regards to your Inspector."</p>

<p>The door opened again and closed behind the Tiger, the constable
watching with his hands above his head. Four minutes later the
Tiger sauntered out of the Square and watched the mortuary coach
drive up to the house. It had been a close call, and the Tiger
congratulated himself on a good piece of work.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter XVIII.</h2>

<p>"I was lucky to be at the Chatton Street Police Station when
Smeardon brought the news of the murder of Thomas Britton," said
Detective Inspector Pemberton. Claude Merrivale was seated in the
Inspector's room at New Scotland Yard. He had read in the morning
papers of the murder of Tom Britton at the house in Pontin Square
and had at once sought the Inspector for further details. These the
Inspector could rat supply. So far the police had made little
progress, and the newspapers' accounts were well up to date.</p>

<p>"You think Smeardon murdered Britton?" asked Claude,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I am afraid so," replied the Inspector, emphatically. "I had a
lot of luck in the matter, thanks to you, Merrivale. Had you not
consulted me over the Gleed affair, I would not have had the
information to wring the truth from those scoundrels. Yes, I have
had luck. It would have been a perplexing case without your
hep."</p>

<p>"Yet I am doubtful," said Claude. "I don't believe Smeardon is
the murderer. It is much more likely to be the Tiger."</p>

<p>[Twenty lines of type are illegible at this point.]</p>

<p>"Let us reconstruct the scene. Smeardon and the Tiger go to the
cellar to get a bottle of wine. There, the Tiger so works on
Smeardon's hatred of Britton that the man goes upstairs and fires
at Britton from the doorway. You must not forget, also, that when
Smeardon returned, he found Britton trying to force the safe. That
was another inducement to the murder."</p>

<p>It sounded very plausible, as the Inspector pieced it together.
Claude had to acknowledge that.</p>

<p>"It was severe provocation," continued the Inspector. "We will
have to acknowledge that, and a clever lawyer will no doubt save
Smeardon from the gallows. But I have the man that fired the shot.
I am convinced of that, and I shall hold Smeardon for trial."</p>

<p>"What about the Gleed estate?" asked Claude at length. "If you
hold Smeardon, how will it be possible for Miss Pellet to claim her
inheritance?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the arrest of Matthew Smeardon is the best thing that
could happen for the Gleed estate," said the Inspector, with a dry
smile. "You people seem to have got yourself engaged in a tidy
little private war over that business. Now I have Smeardon safely
out of the way, it will quieten things down a bit. No one will be
able to claim the fantastic package of the Nine Stars without my
consent, or at least the consent of the authorities."</p>

<p>"We shall have to go to the Courts to get another guardian of
the package appointed, in the place of Smeardon," said Claude,
after some moments' thought.</p>

<p>"If you take my advice," said the Inspector warmly, "you will do
no such thing. I'm quite willing to do all I can for you and Mr.
Waverill, and when you come to me and tell me you have the right
girl, I will see if I cannot persuade Smeardon to perform his duty
under the will. But first, you get the right girl, lad."</p>

<p>"That's awfully good of you, Inspector," replied Claude warmly.
"I will tell Mr. Waverill what you say. It will be a relief to him.
At present we are not quite in accord over the identity of the
claimant. I think that Miss Pellet is genuine. For some
unaccountable reason Mr. Waverill thinks differently."</p>

<p>"You lawyers agree," laughed the Inspector, "and then come to
me. I'll do my part then. And--Mr. Merrivale, a word in your ear
I've worked with Mr. Waverill a good many years and not often found
him mistaken."</p>

<p>"Have you found the weapon with which the murder was committed?"
asked Claude, as he rose to depart.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Inspector shortly. "Smeardon did not have a
pistol on him and the tiger is too wide awake to see him use his.
We cannot find a pistol in the house."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Tiger removed the weapon when he returned to the
house."</p>

<p>"The biggest bit of bluff I've ever known," exclaimed the
Inspector with grudging admiration. "There was I with half the
police of London hunting him and he snugly hidden in the house he
had just escaped from. And then to intimidate my man. It was cheek.
No, sir, I don't think he could have taken the pistol. My theory is
that it is still hidden in the house."</p>

<p>"Just an ordinary revolver, I suppose."</p>

<p>"That is the peculiar thing," said the Inspector earnestly. "It
was not a weapon of ordinary make and that is one of the reasons
that makes me think the Tiger did not remove it. It had a rifled
barrel and was probably a single shot pistol and not a revolver. I
have the bullet here."</p>

<p>He took from a drawer a small box and from it handed a bullet to
Claude. The latter looked at it curiously.</p>

<p>"How far was the murderer from Britton when the shot was
fired?"</p>

<p>"Quite close. A yard or so, not more." He turned to a constable
who had entered the room. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Miss Smith, of the Black Detective Agency, wishes to see you,
sir."</p>

<p>"Send her up." replied the Inspector. Then to Merrivale. "Don't
go, Mr. Merrivale. She has probably come on your business and you
might as well hear what she has to say."</p>

<p>Miss Smith was greeted by the Inspector warmly and it was
evident to Claude that the two were old acquaintances. After a few
words the Inspector picked up the bullet from the desk.</p>

<p>"You came to see this, Miss Smith. Rather an unusual
pattern."</p>

<p>"I did come to see the bullet," said the girl quietly. "Although
I already knew what it was like."</p>

<p>"You knew it had been fired from a rifled pistol," exclaimed
Claude, much astonished.</p>

<p>"I expected it to be so," said Miss Smith, smiling at the
evident amazement of the two men.</p>

<p>"Had it not been so, I should have had to reconstruct some of my
theories regarding the murder and the Gleed case. I came, however,
to learn the Inspector's intentions regarding Matthew
Smeardon."</p>

<p>"I have just informed Mr. Merrivale, I intend to hold Smeardon
for trial. I am convinced he is the murderer."</p>

<p>"I am not." replied Miss Smith. "However I am glad you think you
should hold him. I did not know what your English customs were and
was afraid you might release him. Will you give me due warning
before you release him, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the Inspector promptly, "But you need not
worry about Smeardon. I shall have to produce him before the
magistrate, but until after the inquest there will be a remand and
the coroner's verdict will be against him. That I am certain of,
unless unexpected evidence in his favour turns up."</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten to-night is the third full moon," said Miss
Smith suddenly to Claude.</p>

<p>"Matthew Smeardon will not be there," stated the Inspector
grimly.</p>

<p>"Then the package of the Nine Stars cannot be claimed," observed
Claude with a smile.</p>

<p>"Someone should be in the house," said Miss Smith after a
moment's thought. "Are your men there now, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"No. The man on the beat has instructions to watch the house
carefully and he has a key to enter, if necessary, but I have not
thought necessary to place a man in charge."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Miss Smith approvingly. "The house is a good
trap for the Tiger. I should advise, however, that it is kept under
constant observation so that if the Tiger thinks necessary to
return he may be at once arrested. Have you a spare key,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then give one to Mr. Merrivale."</p>

<p>The Inspector produced a key but hesitated before handing it
over.</p>

<p>"Give it to Mr. Merrivale," repeated Miss Smith. "He will want
one."</p>

<p>The Inspector handed over the key.</p>

<p>"You will go to the house at five o'clock to-day, Mr.
Merrivale," instructed Miss Smith. "Stay there until after nine
o'clock. Keep a careful, watch on the safe and do not leave it,
even if you hear any noise in other parts of the house. And will
you please be at Mr. Waverill's office tomorrow morning at ten
o'clock."</p>

<p>"Do you expect anything to happen?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"I do not know. I hope many things will happen."</p>

<p>"Are you armed?" asked the Inspector suddenly, and upon Claude
replying in the negative, he opened a drawer and took out a small
automatic.</p>

<p>"I'm not supposed to encourage the carrying of arms," he said as
he handed the weapon to Claude. "But the Tiger is not a proposition
I should like you to meet, unless you are on somewhat like level
terms. I'll have a couple of men close handy and if they hear a
shot they will be with you immediately. Don't hesitate to fire--at
the ceiling or floor preferably."</p>

<p>A knock at the door. A constable entered and placed a note on
the Inspector's table.</p>

<p>"Brought here by a street lad," reported the constable. "We have
the lad detained."</p>

<p>The Inspector tore the envelope open. He read the contents with
a puzzled frown and then handed it to Miss Smith. She read it
aloud.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Inspector:--Thanks for the opportunity. I
visited Pontin Square to-day and obtained the package of the Nine
Stars. Sincerely yours, William Trantor.</p>

<p>"Where is that boy," thundered the Inspector. "Bring him here at
once."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter XIX.</h2>

<p>The boy brought into the room by the constable was a typical
specimen of the London street arab. Clan in garments tattered and
held together by various fastenings, rarest of which were buttons,
he faced the Inspector with the boldness of his race.</p>

<p>A man had given him the letter. A tall man with a moustache. He
had also given him sixpence and promised that he would not be hurt
and that the Inspector would give him a shilling for bringing the
message. He was very insistent on that part of his story and
finally the Inspector produced the required coin and handed it
over.</p>

<p>He did not know the man, had never seen him before, but a pal of
his who had been a short distance off had said it was the Tiger. He
did not know who the Tiger was and did not want to. Where was his
pal? He didn't know or care. Might come across him some time or
another.</p>

<p>The Inspector left it at that. Telling the boy there was another
shilling waiting for him when he came with the true address of the
Tiger, the Inspector let him depart. After his departure Miss Smith
and Claude discussed the new position with the Inspector and
decided to make no change in their plans. Miss Smith had a taxi
waiting and, refusing Claude's proffered escort, drove off, leaving
Claude to visit his chambers and make arrangements for his vigil at
Pontin Square.</p>

<p>An empty house has always an eerie atmosphere. Claude was
conscious of an uncomfortable feeling when he let himself into the
house in Pontin Square soon after five that afternoon. The place
was untidy and desolate. The dust lay thick everywhere. In the
study he shuddered as he glanced at the floor before the safe where
the Inspector had told him the body had been found. There were
blood stains still on the carpet.</p>

<p>Switching on the electric lights throughout the ground floor,
Claude made a journey of exploration. He returned with kindling for
a fire, and a duster, and in time made the room somewhat habitable.
Then he spread his papers on the desk and settled down to his work,
keeping his senses alert for the advent of any intruder.</p>

<p>Soon after six the Inspector paid him a visit. Together they
found the catch of the bookcase and revealed the safe but without
the combination they could not open it. The stars on the safe door
at attracted their curiosity and they spent some time trying to
discover their origin. There were five of them now and, counting up
the times they guessed the safe had been opened, it was manifest a
fresh star appeared for each opening. Finally the Inspector left,
informing Claude that he had men posted to watch the house and that
he would look in again later.</p>

<p>When he had let the Inspector out of the house, Claude returned
to the study and loaded his pipe. It was impossible to work and he
lay back in his chair trying to reconstruct the mysteries, now so
thick around the Gleed estate. Every day brought some new
happening. Something that did not appear to have any definite
connection with the estate yet shrouded the solution of the mystery
of the Nine Stars with deeper bewilderment.</p>

<p>Principal of all was the package of the Nine Stars. What did it
contain? Waverill was convinced that none of the securities of the
estate were missing. He had all the papers in his hands. Therefore
the package must contain something the old financier had not
confided to his lawyer. Then there were the two girls. One of them
must be the true heiress. The claim of the first girl was false.
She was known to be a member of the Tiger's gang, a dummy put
forward by the Tiger and Smeardon to get control of the estate.</p>

<p>Olga Pellet stood on firmer ground. He, himself, was fain to
acknowledge her as his cousin, and the heiress of the estate.
Waverill still expressed doubts and wished to delay the handing
over of the fortune to her, but he could bring forward no definite
evidence to support those doubts. It was an [?], he said, and
laughed at himself as he said it. But he would not give way. He [?]
a policy of inaction.</p>

<p>Claude realised suddenly he had been drifting into love with his
cousin and wondered, what had he seen in her? She was a pleasant
relation, but nothing more. He now fully realised there was only
one girl in his life, and that was Ira Ira Smith, the detective
Waverill had called in to solve the mystery of the Nine Stars. He
lay back in his chair and pictured her.</p>

<p>A slim, slight girl rather above the medium height of women with
a crown of dark hair. In the glowing fire he could see her proud
little face with the large steadfast eyes, that looked out on the
world with a wealth of courage. And she, a detective. He had always
looked upon women detectives as unsexed creatures tracking down
criminals. It was not work for a woman. He would woo her, win her
and take her out of that life. Thank God, he had some money behind
him now and Waverill had spoken well of his work. He would, work as
never a man worked before and gain success--for her. It was to be
all for her.</p>

<p>Claude was aroused from his reverie by a loud knock at the front
door. A hasty look through the window showed him it was dark now,
and he took his automatic from the desk as he passed into the hall.
When he opened the hall door he was surprised to find Miss Smith
and Waverill standing on the step.</p>

<p>"How are things," said Waverill cheerily as he entered. "Any
callers?"</p>

<p>"Only the Inspector."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he stay? We are going to open the safe."</p>

<p>They passed into the study and Ira Smith went direct to the
safe. Claude had not closed the bookcase, and she swung it into
place and carefully examined it, taking down some of the books.
Then she pressed the spring and examined the door of the safe.</p>

<p>"I can open this." she said quietly, looking at the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Good. As soon as you like."</p>

<p>She bent to the combination and with delicate fingers swung the
index round. Then she took the handle and the door pulled open. She
gave one glance at the interior and then turned.</p>

<p>"The package has gone," she said.</p>

<p>The lawyer came to her side and verified her statement. Then she
and the lawyer carefully examined the interior.</p>

<p>"We shall have to catch the Tiger before we can go further,"
said the lawyer grimly.</p>

<p>"Rather a tall order," remarked Claude. "That gentleman seems to
come and go as he pleases. It appears to me, Mr. Waverill, that the
matter is now one for the courts. Smeardon is in jail, charged with
a capital offence. While he was at liberty we could not touch him,
or assail his position, so long as we had no definite charges
against him. Now he is out of the way, it is necessary that someone
should be appointed to take over his duties under the will."</p>

<p>Waverill considered the suggestion for some minutes.</p>

<p>"It wants a lot of considering," he said at length. "Let's sit
down and hold a consultation."</p>

<p>He placed a chair for Ira and the two men sat, one each side of
her.</p>

<p>"We will presume that Smeardon is incapable of carrying out his
duties under the will. Then it is necessary, as the will makes no
provision for such an eventuality, that the Courts must be
approached to appoint some person to carry out those duties. So far
Merrivale, you have stated the facts correctly. But would it be to
our advantage at the present stage to take that step?"</p>

<p>"I see no reason against it," replied Claude.</p>

<p>"I see one reason," continued the lawyer. "I am referring to
Miss Pellet. Now, Merrivale, I know what you are going to say. You
believe that young lady is your cousin. I am doubtful. There is
only one way to settle my doubts, and that is by the production of
the most ample evidence that she is the true heiress of the late
Ezra Gleed. I have asked Miss Smith to communicate with her
American office and furnish me with the fullest particulars of the
lady in question. Have you that information Miss Smith."</p>

<p>"I cannot let you have it at present," replied Ira.</p>

<p>"Then until you have that information I shall advise that we sit
quiet and let matters take their course. Inspector Pemberton has
promised that, if we can produce the right young lady, he will
produce Smeardon to carry out his part of the compact. That is good
enough for me at the present."</p>

<p>"Considering that the safe is empty, it is hardly worth
troubling the courts at present," remarked Ira.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do in the event of Miss Pellet applying
to the courts to appoint a guardian for the safe, and to give her
the opportunity to carry out the conditions of the will?" asked
Claude suddenly.</p>

<p>"In such an event I shall oppose on your behalf," replied the
lawyer, without a smile.</p>

<p>"On my behalf!" exclaimed Claude.</p>

<p>"On your behalf," repeated the lawyer, firmly. "You will have to
do it, Merrivale. I quite understand your dislike to appear, in any
way, to hinder your cousin from obtaining her inheritance. But you
forget that circumstances have altered considerably since we first
discussed your uncle's will. Now we have rival claimants, we are in
doubt as to the identity of the lady who claims to be the heiress,
and we have not the package to hand over to her when she proves her
identity. It is your duty to safeguard the estate for your cousin,
whoever she may be."</p>

<p>"It is the only course, Mr. Merrivale," said Ira gently. "You
must follow Mr. Waverill's advice."</p>

<p>"By the way, Merrivale," exclaimed the lawyer. "I nave received
more mysterious messages."</p>

<p>He drew out of his pocket some envelopes and sorted them on the
desk.</p>

<p>"Here is the first one, which you saw at my Office," he
continued, placing the card on the blotter. "And here are four
others. I have placed them in the order in which they came to
me."</p>

<p>Ira and Claude bent over the blotting paper on which the lawyer
had placed the cards. The cards now read:</p>

<p>A D E E E<br>
* * * * *<br>
E S A N R</p>

<p>"Five of the Nine Stars!" exclaimed Claude. "What do they mean."
He shifted the cards about, trying to form some word that would
give them a clue.</p>

<p>"I am afraid we shall have to give it up until more of the
symbols come along," remarked Ira, after a while. "There is not
enough of them to allow us to even guess at the meaning."</p>

<p>They were interrupted by a loud knock at the street door.</p>

<p>"That must be the Inspector," exclaimed Claude, rising. "He
promised to return."</p>

<p>It was not the Inspector. When he opened the door a heavily
veiled young lady walked in.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Smeardon here?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Claude thought rapidly, and then answered in the affirmative. He
led the way to the study. When the woman saw the lawyer she stepped
back, but Claude had closed the door and stood with his back to
it.</p>

<p>"Where is Mr. Smeardon?" asked the woman agitatedly.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" commanded the lawyer. "We did not expect to be
favoured with your company this evening."</p>

<p>"Why should not I be here," said the woman defiantly. "I asked
to see Mr. Smeardon."</p>

<p>"What is your business with that gentleman," asked the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"You are Mr. Waverill, the lawyer," said the girl, slowly, "I
have seen you before. I have come to demand the package of the Nine
Stars."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded the lawyer again.</p>

<p>"My name is Olga Mary Pellet. Where is Mr. Smeardon?"</p>

<p>"That is not your name." said Ira, leaning forward. "You are
known as Polly and you are a confederate of the Tiger."</p>

<p>Polly threw up her veil and looked defiantly at Ira.</p>

<p>"I know you," she said spitefully. "You are the woman who had me
imprisoned in the Albany some days ago. Well I've got out and now
you'll have to answer for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I had you captured and held a prisoner," said Ira,
quietly. "I gave orders you were to be released today. You would
not have gained your freedom, however, had not Matthew Smeardon
been arrested for the murder of Tom Britton."</p>

<p>"Tom dead! Matt Smeardon in jail," whispered the girl. "Where's
the Tiger? What have you done with him?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter XX.</h2>

<p>"Sit down!" said Ira to Polly.</p>

<p>Merrivale placed a seat for the girl and, after a moment's
hesitation, she took it. Ira turned to Waverill.</p>

<p>"It is true I have had Polly under lock and key for the past
month," she said quietly. "I considered it necessary that she
should not be in communication with her confederates. When Smeardon
was arrested I gave instructions she was to be released."</p>

<p>Waverill smiled at the high-handed action of this American girl
detective. Then he turned to Polly.</p>

<p>"Now you are here, Miss Polly," he said, "we should like to have
a statement from you regarding your part in the attempt to obtain
possession of the package of the Nine Stars. We are willing to
overlook your part of the matter if you will now act like a
sensible girl."</p>

<p>"Then you won't," answered Polly, defiantly.</p>

<p>"What is your full name?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Olga Mary Pellet."</p>

<p>"Dear me," murmured Waverill, "I thought you would have seen the
folly of persisting in that statement."</p>

<p>"Especially as the Tiger may suffer for it," said Ira in an
undertone.</p>

<p>"What do you know of the Tiger?" demanded Polly. "Have you
harmed him?"</p>

<p>"Your silence may cause him a lot of harm," replied
Waverill.</p>

<p>"Then you have not got him yet," exclaimed Polly, triumphantly.
"You are trying to frighten me."</p>

<p>"Inspector Pemberton will be here any moment," said Ira,
brusquely. "He will no doubt bring news of your friend. He was seen
on the Embankment to-day and it is probable the police have
arrested him by this time. In any case we will have one prisoner
for the Inspector."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will give me in charge," said the girl,
scornfully. "It's likely to be the other way round, my lady. What
about your high-handed action in locking me up? What charge have
you against me?</p>

<p>"Of false pretences," replied the lawyer, quickly. "For
impersonating the heiress of the Gleed estate."</p>

<p>"Then you think that the girl at the Lyric Hotel is the
heiress?"</p>

<p>"We know you are an imposter," countered Waverill.</p>

<p>"Very well," said, the girl, defiantly. "Have me arrested and I
will prove my identity as Olga Mary Pellet. It will serve my
ends."</p>

<p>The lawyer raised ins eyebrows. It was the one thing that he was
trying to avoid. Legal process, at the present moment, would open
the whole question of the Gleed estate in the Courts. Polly would
claim she was the real Olga Pellet and produce the papers she had
shown the lawyer. He had no evidence that she was an imposter,
nothing that would convince the court. The girl would be released
and he would have to apply to the Courts for directions to prevent
her taking possession of the estate. He could see troublesome days
before him if he acted too hastily now. Polly rose and walked to
the door.</p>

<p>"I'm going now," she said. "Detain me if you dare."</p>

<p>The door closed behind her. The men exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Leave her alone," said Ira. "I have arranged for her to be
watched."</p>

<p>"We do not seem to be making much progress," remarked Claude.
"This come and go business of our opponents is, to say the least,
exasperating."</p>

<p>"We are dealing with some of the smartest rogues in the
country," observed the lawyer. "We have to move cautiously."</p>

<p>"Perforce," said Claude.</p>

<p>A key was heard in the latch and then the Inspector entered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps Inspector Pemberton has news for us," said Ira.</p>

<p>"None whatever," replied the Inspector. "Had any visitors, Mr.
Merrivale?"</p>

<p>"Only Polly."</p>

<p>"So! That young lady tuned up again. Why did you not detain
her?"</p>

<p>"I am having her watched," answered Ira. "In fact I have kept a
watch on her for the past month."</p>

<p>"Using her as a decoy to lead us to the Tiger," assumed the
Inspector. "Pity you did not wait a while and let my man take up
the trail."</p>

<p>"My people will do as well," said Ira. "Have you any news?"</p>

<p>"The inquest on Britton will be opened the day after to-morrow.
Of course the proceedings will be formal. An adjournment is
certain."</p>

<p>"And Smeardon?" said Claude.</p>

<p>"He will appear before the magistrate to-morrow. I shall ask for
a remand. Now what do you want me to do regarding this mysterious
package of the Nine Stars, and Smeardon?"</p>

<p>"I have seen the Home Secretary to-day," answered Waverill. "He
is willing that Smeardon shall be brought here on the night of the
next full moon to deliver the package to Miss Pellet. I hope by
that time to have definite evidence of her identity. If she is the
real heiress she shall have an opportunity to claim her
inheritance."</p>

<p>"That will suit me," observed Ira. "I shall have all the
evidence by that time:"</p>

<p>"If this Olga Pellet is, like Polly, a fraud, what do you intend
to do?" asked the Inspector?</p>

<p>"I shall cancel all the arrangements and allow matters to stand
until we get in touch with the right girl or the time elapses and
Mr. Merrivale inherits."</p>

<p>Again there came a knock at the door. Merrivale answered it and
returned in a few moments with a note he handed to Waverill. The
lawyer opened it and, after scanning the contents, read it
aloud:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mr. Waverill--You will know by this time
that I have possession of the package of the Nine Stars. You are
therefore unable to carry out the conditions of the will of the
late Mr. Gleed, even if you find the true heiress. If you are
prepared to deal with me for the return of the above package please
insert an advertisement to that effect in the "Daily Mail" for
to-morrow. I will then communicate to you my terms. Unless the
advertisement is inserted I shall destroy the package.--William
Trantor.</p>

<p>"What do you advise, Miss Smith," asked Merrivale.</p>

<p>"Insert the advertisement," answered Ira promptly.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed the Inspector. "I don't like dealing with these
rogues but in this case you have no option. You can refuse his
terms at any time. Insert the advertisement. I shall not be
inactive."</p>

<p>While they had been discussing the letter, Waverill had taken
pencil and paper and drafted the advertisement.</p>

<p><i>"Tiger.--State terms. Waverill."</i> he read.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to deal with him?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"That depends on what he has to offer," replied the lawyer. "I
have a suspicion there is some deeper meaning in the package than
we suspect. Ezra Gleed was a secretive man but he had in his employ
a man that was cunning and alert. Smeardon may have ferreted out
the inner meaning of the package of the Nine Stars and revealed the
secret to the Tiger. If that is so, then the Tiger has information
that may be of the utmost value to us. I am prepared to purchase
the package and the information."</p>

<p>"That may be right from your point of view, Mr. Waverill," said
the Inspector. "I want to get my hands on the Tiger. Let me have
that letter a moment, please."</p>

<p>He took the letter and carefully examined it by aid of a
magnifying glass. On the back he found some marks. They appeared to
be as if someone had written a message on the sheet of paper above,
with a hard pencil. The Inspector left the room and, when he
returned, handed the paper to Waverill. The writing was now quite
legible and the lawyer read aloud:</p>

<p class="letter">To 4 Rockwell Crescent, at once, where I am.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter XXI.</h2>

<p>When he arrived at Clarges Street Police Court on the morning
Smeardon was to appear before the magistrate, Claude found Ira
seated in the body of the Court. He offered her a seat inside the
barrier, but she declined, preferring to remain with the general
public. Claude had to pass in to the solicitor's table, as Waverill
had briefed him on behalf of the Gleed estate. There was an air of
excitement about the preliminary proceedings, that showed important
developments were expected.</p>

<p>Some details of the Gleed mystery had filtered through to the
press, and the reporters' table was crowded. The appearance of
Smeardon was greeted with a subdued murmur as the spectators
settled themselves for the hearing. Smeardon did not seem much
concerned when he was placed in the dock. He glanced round the
court room, and then fixed his eyes on the magistrate. Formal
evidence of arrest was tendered by Inspector Pemberton, who
detailed the finding of the body in the house at Pontin Square. No
mention was made of the abortive arrest of the Tiger. Then the
Inspector asked for eight days remand. It was immediately granted,
the solicitor appearing for Smeardon raising no objection. Smeardon
was returning to the cells when a boy's voice rang through the
court.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Matt. We'll have you out soon."</p>

<p>Smeardon nodded to where the voice came from, and then walked
quickly out of the dock. There was a commotion in the part of the
room from which the boy had called as the police tried to find him.
Then the court cleared.</p>

<p>Claude found Ira waiting for him outside the court building.</p>

<p>"Waverill wants us to go round to his office directly the
proceedings here finish," he observed. "Will you come now?"</p>

<p>Ira assented and Claude hailed a cab.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the result of the Inspector's enquiries at
Rockwell Crescent," asked Ira, as they were driven rapidly in the
direction of Holbourn.</p>

<p>"No. The Inspector only gave me a curt nod when he was in the
court," replied Claude with a laugh. "He looked black, so I suppose
he has failed again."</p>

<p>The clerk in the outer office had evidently received
instructions that they were not to be kept waiting. Waverill
greeted them warmly.</p>

<p>"I had heard from the Tiger," he said. "Here is his letter. It
was brought into the office by some woman."</p>

<p>The message was typed on common paper and was unsigned.</p>

<p class="letter">I will hand over the package of the Nine Stars in
return for the contents of Ezra Gleed's safe. Call off the police
and advertise your acceptance of these terms, and I will make an
appointment.</p>

<p>"The contents of the safe," exclaimed Claude. "Why it is
empty."</p>

<p>"Did you examine it for secret drawers, a false back or anything
of that kind?" asked Waverill.</p>

<p>"It is just a plain safe," answered Claude. "I examined it
carefully and so did Miss Smith. I am certain there is nothing
there."</p>

<p>"Yet there must be something. The Tiger would not make a mistake
of that kind. Are we to accept his terms?"</p>

<p>"No," said Ira suddenly. "You must not do that, Mr. Waverill.
Cannot you keep in touch with him without settling anything
definite."</p>

<p>"I can ask for further particulars, but I don't think the Tiger
will allow me to keep him dangling on. He will demand an answer,
'yes' or 'no' next time."</p>

<p>"Try all you can do to postpone a decision," urged Ira. "A few
days more and I may have the clue I require in my possession."</p>

<p>"By the way," exclaimed the lawyer. "I have received another of
those mysterious cards."</p>

<p>He took from his desk drawer a packet tied with red tape and
opened it on his desk. From the top he took an envelope and passed
it across to Ira. She opened it and withdrew a card on which was
drawn the symbol,</p>

<p>G<br>
*<br>
S</p>

<p>The lawyer had, in the meantime, sorted out the previous cards
and now arranged them on the desk, placing them in the order in
which they had been received.</p>

<p>A D E E E G<br>
* * * * * *<br>
B S A N R S<br></p>

<p>"Six of them," exclaimed Claude. "So far as we know, or can
guess, the safe has been opened six times. That means that for
every time the safe is opened, you receive a card with a symbol on
it, Mr. Waverill."</p>

<p>"So it appears," replied the lawyer. "But what do they mean? To
me they are but a meaningless jumble of words and stars."</p>

<p>A clerk entered and whispered a few words to Waverill.</p>

<p>"Show him in," commanded the lawyer. Then he turned to the
others. "It's the Inspector."</p>

<p>"Got the Tiger?" asked Claude, as the Inspector entered and sank
into a chair.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then the clue of the notepaper was valueless?"</p>

<p>"Yes. No one there looks anything like the Tiger. Got the boy
who delivered the letter to the Yard. I was a fool to think that
the Tiger would allow such a clue to fall into my hands."</p>

<p>Waverill handed the note from the Tiger to the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Humph!" grunted the latter. "Call off the place. Take more than
that to get me off his trail."</p>

<p>"Miss Smith thinks we can play him for a time and perhaps get
some information out of him. She hopes, in a few days, to have some
information for us."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" asked the Inspector swinging round on Ira. "I've a
great respect for your intelligence, Miss Smith, but if you can see
any way out of this tangle, I'll say you are a wonder."</p>

<p>"I may have better information than you, Inspector," said Ira
laughing.</p>

<p>"Can you give us any information, Miss Smith?" asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>Ira thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"I can give you some facts, but how far they will help you, I
cannot say: First, I have found out that the girl who calls herself
Olga Pellet came over on the <i>Danetic.</i> I may say that I was
interested in this matter before Mr. Waverill approached me and
watched Miss Pellet from the steamer to Mr. Waverill's office.
Later I saw Mr. Waverill and he asked me to take the case up."</p>

<p>"May I ask how you were interested in the case before Mr.
Waverill instructed you," asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I was interested in the girl calling herself Olga Pellet,"
replied Ira.</p>

<p>"Then you do not think she is the right heiress," said
Claude.</p>

<p>"I am not prepared to give an opinion on that subject at
present. I know certain facts about her that caused me to watch
her. I know much of her family history that is more important to us
at the present time than the girl herself. Her father, Ernest
Pellet was one of the neglected geniuses of the world. He was a
safe maker in the city of New York, and at one time had a business
of his own. He failed, owing to lack of business methods. He was
not a business man, although, he was one of the best and most
original safe designers in the world. He then entered the employ of
one of the large safe makers in the States and designed for them
nearly all the finest safes now in use. That safe in Pontin Square
is one of his make. The trick of the appearing stars I know to be
his invention. They indicate how many times the safe has been
opened during a given time."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Pellet still in the States," asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"He is dead," replied Ira.</p>

<p>"Could he make a safe capable of shooting a man," queried the
Inspector abruptly.</p>

<p>"Certainly. It is quite possible."</p>

<p>"Are you thinking that Britton met his death through the safe?"
asked Claude.</p>

<p>"From what Miss Smith tells us, it is probable," replied the
Inspector. "I must look into it."</p>

<p>"If Britton was shot by any mechanism of the safe he must have
been standing sideways to it," said Claude. "The bullet wound was
over the right ear. In that case he must have been standing with
his right side to the safe and bending down. Why should he assume
that position if his business was with the safe."</p>

<p>"There's something in that," acknowledged the Inspector. "I
thought for a moment Miss Smith's theory of the safe would account
for the missing weapon."</p>

<p>"Could he have made a safe with a secret drawer," said the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"It is very probable that he made a secret drawer to the safe in
Pontin Square," replied Ira. "But so far we have failed to find any
indication of a secret drawer or cupboard."</p>

<p>"The mystery seems to be thickening the farther we go into it,"
said the Inspector in a dissatisfied tone. "I should advise that
the safe be examined by an expert."</p>

<p>"Just what I was going to suggest Inspector," said the lawyer.
"I will arrange for an expert to go with us to the house for that
purpose, and will advise you of the time."</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang and the lawyer lifted the receiver.
After a moment he held the receiver out to the Inspector. "You are
wanted at the Yard, Inspector. Speak from here if you like."</p>

<p>The Inspector took the receiver and gave his name. He listened
for some minutes with growing excitement, interjecting a question
here and there. Then he replaced the receiver on the hook.</p>

<p>"Olga Pellet has disappeared from the Lyric Hotel," he said
briefly, picking up his hat.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter XXII.</h2>

<p>"Any particulars?" asked Waverill.</p>

<p>"Few at present," replied the Inspector. "According to the
story, the manager of the hotel tells, she has been missing for the
last two days. She was seen leaving the hotel about eight o'clock
in the evening on the day before yesterday and was supposed to have
gone to some place of amusement, for she was in evening dress, but
unaccompanied. She was not seen returning. No notice of her absence
was taken until this morning when the manager rung up the Yard and
asked for a man to be sent round. The Chief, knowing I am
interested in the girl through the Gleed case, telephoned me to
take the case in hand."</p>

<p>"I will go with you, Inspector, if I may," said Ira, rising from
her chair.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Miss Smith. Glad to have you."</p>

<p>"Do you think the disappearance of Miss Pellet is connected with
the Gleed case?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"Impossible to say, sir," replied the Inspector. "Tell you more
when I have been to the hotel."</p>

<p>Ira and the Inspector left Holborn Inn and drove direct to the
Lyric Hotel. They found the manager awaiting them in his private
office, striding up and down wringing his hands.</p>

<p>"This is most distressing for the hotel," he exclaimed on the
Inspector entering the room. "It will do us a lot of harm. Can't
you hush up the matter, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Nothing to hush up at present," retorted the Inspector. "A lady
goes out of the hotel and does not return for a couple of days.
Nothing in it, Mr. Politzi. Half a hundred things might have
happened to detain her without one of them being the dreadful thing
you are imagining."</p>

<p>"It is good of you to speak so bravely," cried the manager. "But
I have a presentiment."</p>

<p>"In that case we had better get to I work," said the Inspector
without trying to combat anything so vague. "Miss Smith is going to
help me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Politzi made Ira a low bow.</p>

<p>"It is most lamentable," he continued. "What will happen to the
hotel if people are to be allowed to disappear in this way?"</p>

<p>"You are looking on the worst side of things," said Ira. "Will
you please tell us what took place on the day Miss Pellet
disappeared? Be as exact as you can."</p>

<p>"Miss Pellet did not go out that day until the evening," said
the manager. "She had her meals in the restaurant and spent most of
the time reading in the lounge. After dinner she went to her room
and later rung up the office for a taxi to be called. I was in the
hall when she came down."</p>

<p>"Did Miss Pellet receive any letters," asked Ira.</p>

<p>"I will enquire," replied the manager. He left the room and
returned shortly with the information that Miss Pellet had received
two letters, by post that day, one with the American postmark.</p>

<p>"What was the exact time Miss Pellet left the hotel," asked the
Inspector.</p>

<p>"At eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"How do you place the time so exactly?"</p>

<p>"It is by the church clock opposite," replied the manager, "it
struck as she came down the stairs."</p>

<p>"You were in the foyer when she left the hotel?"</p>

<p>"I was standing by the elevator. When she came out of it she did
wish me a good evening. She was in evening dress with a cloak over
it and I walked with her to the cab and helped her in. She did
thank me and laugh."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>"It is all I know."</p>

<p>"Miss Pellet did not receive any telephone or message?"</p>

<p>"It was only the letters she received," said the manager. "I did
ask just now at the reception desk. There was nothing until the
next morning when the maid came to me and told me Miss Pellet had
not returned and did not sleep in her bed. I think, perhaps, she
stay with some friends. Then this morning the maid again came to me
and say Miss Pellet not sleep in her bed and I get alarmed and go
and see. Then I telephone to the police. That is all."</p>

<p>"It is not much," muttered the Inspector. "We will go to Miss
Pellet's room, Mr. Politzi."</p>

<p>The manager led the way to a large room on the second floor. He
opened the door and stood back to let them enter.</p>

<p>"It was here Miss Pellet did lodge."</p>

<p>The room contained the usual furniture of an hotel bedroom. On
the right a small room adjoined, the door of which stood partly
open. In the corner stood a large steamer trunk plastered with
labels. Ira stood in the centre of the bedroom and looked around
with a smile. It was a woman's room and the occupant had evidently
dressed in haste. Dresses and lingerie were scattered about the
room. On the dressing table the toilet articles were lying in
disorder.</p>

<p>"Looks as if she had been in a mighty hurry," observed the
Inspector.</p>

<p>Ira gave a quiet smile as if the scene was a familiar one to
her.</p>

<p>After her first glance round, Ira commenced a thorough search of
the rooms. Every document and piece of paper she could find she
handed to the Inspector, who placed them on the table in the centre
of the room. There were not many. When they had completed their
search, the Inspector and Ira drew chairs up to the table and
carefully examined the letters.</p>

<p>"There's not much here," said the Inspector at length.</p>

<p>"No," said Ira absently. "Have you noticed anything missing,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Can't say that I have."</p>

<p>"Where are Miss Pellet's identification papers?" asked Ira, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" exclaimed the Inspector, jumping up. "How did I
come to miss them?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you were not looking for them. I was. In fact, I must
confess, Inspector, that to examine those identification papers was
the main object of my accompanying yon here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she placed them in a safe deposit," guessed the
Inspector. "In that case she would have the safe deposit receipt
somewhere. She would not carry it about in her bag."</p>

<p>The Inspector strode to the door and summoned the maid.</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Politzi I want him."</p>

<p>The manager could not have been far away for he entered the room
immediately.</p>

<p>"Did Miss Pellet give you any papers to lock up in the hotel
safe?"</p>

<p>"She did give me a packet of bank notes to have in change for
her," replied Politzi, "but of papers, no."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her with a package of papers?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>"A big package, almost a parcel," replied the manager. "Yes She
did have one. Large, like this. I saw her with one in her hand two
or three times when she had been leaving the hotel."</p>

<p>"Did the leave them in your charge at any time?"</p>

<p>"No, never with me. Ah! but the maid of the room may be able to
inform you more. I will call her."</p>

<p>He left the room and brought back the maid.</p>

<p>"Come in, my girl," he exclaimed, leading the way into the room.
"Here is a lady who requires of you a question."</p>

<p>"Have you seen Miss Pellet with a package of papers?" asked Ira
of the maid, an intelligent looking girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss," replied the girl promptly. "She kept them in the
slip at the top of her trunk. I have seen her get them out."</p>

<p>"Get them for me."</p>

<p>The girl crossed to the trunk after a glance at the manager, who
nodded his head, she opened the trunk and put her hand in the
slip.</p>

<p>"They are not here."</p>

<p>"Thank you. That will do," said the Inspector promptly.</p>

<p>The maid and the manager left the room.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Miss Smith?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Very little, I must confess," replied Ira. "The absence of the
papers indicate that she had perhaps left the hotel on business
connected with the Gleed estate. But we cannot be certain of that.
You had better send the usual call round the stations. It is the
only thing to do."</p>

<p>The Inspector agreed and opened the door. Ira did not move. She
was standing by the table, idly fingering one of the letters.</p>

<p>"Did you notice this letter, Inspector?" she asked.</p>

<p>The Inspector took the letter she handed him and read it. It was
on the notepaper of the Watson Brake and Engineering Company and
read:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Miss Pellet--For your private information we
beg to inform you that we have received a cable from Messrs
Waverill, Waverill and Waverill, solicitors, of London, England,
and have replied thereto. Copies of cablegram and our reply
enclosed. We are, etc., The Western Brake and Engineering
Company.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed the Inspector. "This looks as if she was
the true article for the Gleed estate."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter XXIII.</h2>

<p>Waverill and Claude attended the inquest on Tom Britton, more
out of curiosity, as the estate was not concerned legally in the
proceedings. The Inspector, who was the principal witness,
described the finding of the body and arrest of Smeardon. The
latter declined, on the advice of his solicitor, to give evidence.
The verdict was a foregone conclusion. The Inspector caught the
lawyers as they were leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Any news of Miss Pellet?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"None," replied the Inspector. "We have swept the town but can
find no trace of her. She has disappeared completely off the map.
Have you seen anything of Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"You had better come with us, Inspector," said Waverill, hailing
a passing taxi. "Miss Smith telephoned us to meet her at Pontin
Square directly after the inquest. Arriving at the house, Merrivale
let them in with his key. Ira was not there and they decided to
wait until she came. Shortly after them arrived Mr. Andrews, the
expert Waverill had engaged to examine the safe. He had received a
message from Miss Smith to come round and also expected her to be
there."</p>

<p>"We may as well get along with the job, Mr. Waverill," said the
Inspector. "I may be called away from here any minute."</p>

<p>Claude rolled back the bookcase and disclosed the safe. The
expert and the Inspector carefully examined the outside, testing
every stud and button. Then they tried the combination knob with
the object of discovering if the safe was protected by firearms,
but in this they were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is anything here worthy of note," said the
Inspector at length.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the expert. "The stars are but a trick very easy
to understand and work. They indicate the number of times the safe
has been opened since their combination was set. Will you give me
the combination now, Mr. Waverill?"</p>

<p>The lawyer handed over a paper and the expert opened the safe.
Again he and the Inspector set about a thorough search but could
discover no trace of any secret hiding place. They tested every
part of the interior without result.</p>

<p>"It is evident there is nothing of a serious nature in this
safe," announced Mr. Andrews when he had finished. "It is quite the
usual pattern without any fancy work. Just what I should have
imagined Mr. Gleed would have established to hold the few papers he
required to keep in the house.</p>

<p>"Still I cannot think the Tiger would have made so great a
mistake," said the Inspector reflectively.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the expert.</p>

<p>The lawyer told him of the offer of the Tiger to give up the
package of the Nine Stars in return for the contents of the
safe.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly justified in accepting the offer," declared
the expert. "I will stake my reputation that the safe is
empty."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to agree with you," said the inspector. "Much as
I dislike the idea of having any dealings with that rogue."</p>

<p>"I disagree with you, Inspector," said Claude. "Why should the
Tiger open the safe and take out the package of the Nine Stars, and
then offer to return it for the other contents of the safe? If
there are other contents why did not the Tiger take them at the
time he took the package?"</p>

<p>"I had not looked at it from that point of view," acknowledged
the Inspector. "With the safe open, the other contents he valued
were at his mercy."</p>

<p>"But the safe contains nothing," interjected the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Not even the pistol that killed Britton," said Claude, with a
glance at the Inspector.</p>

<p>"I'm certain now that Britton never met his death through any
mechanism connected with this safe," affirmed the Inspector. "It is
a most ordinary piece of furniture."</p>

<p>"Yet Miss Smith declares that it was designed and erected by
Ernest Pellet," said Claude.</p>

<p>"Did he erect this," exclaimed Andrews quickly. He went to the
safe and studied it again. "If Ernest Pellet designed this safe it
is the only ordinary piece of work he ever executed."</p>

<p>The Inspector looked from the safe to the expert.</p>

<p>"It looks ordinary," he agreed. "But you and Miss Smith seem to
have a great belief in its designer. Was Pellet such a clever man
in the game. I mean, didn't he ever take on any ordinary, just
common-place work, such as an ordinary safe for instance?"</p>

<p>"He was the greatest safe expert the world has ever known,"
replied Andrews, impressively. "If this safe is his work it is the
first of its kind. He never designed a common safe in his
life."</p>

<p>"Give it up, Inspector," laughed Claude. "What are we going to
do about the next full moon? With Miss Pellet out of the way it
will not be necessary to bring Smeardon here."</p>

<p>"Of course our plans will have to stand over unless Miss Smith
can locate Miss Pellet in the meantime," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"We shall have to recover the package of the nine stars, too,"
reminded Claude.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of that," said the lawyer. "The Tiger says he
is willing to hand it over if we will give him the contents of the
safe. Mr. Andrews says it has no further contents, and I am
prepared to stand by that statement."</p>

<p>"I can assure you there is no secret connected with that safe,"
the expert assured them. "It is a plain ordinary safe, nothing
more. I give you my word for that."</p>

<p>"Then you would lose, Mr. Andrews," said a girl's voice.</p>

<p>The expert turned to face Ira, who entered the room at the
moment.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I am late," continued Ira. "We will get to work now.
You have examined the safe, Mr. Andrews, and believe, it contains
no secret?"</p>

<p>"I am certain of that," repeated the expert, but hie tone was
not so assured. Ira passed, to the safe and bent to scan the door.
There now shone seven stars on its surface. She closed the safe and
again opened it, working the combination. There were now eight
stars on the door. Again she closed the safe and opened it,
bringing nine stars into view. Then she closed the safe and stepped
back.</p>

<p>"Will you open the safe, Mr. Andrews," she said, turning to the
expert.</p>

<p>Andrews stepped to the safe and set the combination. He grasped
the handle and slowly turned it. Some new mechanism was evidently
set at work, for the handle turned stiffly. He drew the door open
and gave a cry of surprise. The other men gathered round
quickly.</p>

<p>There, on the floor of the safe reposed the package of the Nine
Stars.</p>

<p>Waverill look up the package and carried it to the table. When
he had thoroughly examined it, he passed it to Claude, who in turn
passed it to the Inspector. The latter studied the seals closely,
then placed the package on the desk.</p>

<p>"This is not the original package of the Nine Stars," he said
slowly. "This has never been opened since it was first sealed. The
package of the Nine Stars I saw in this room the night Britton was
murdered had been opened. In fact, the Tiger acknowledged he had
opened it."</p>

<p>"Then what is this and where is the original package of the Nine
Stars?" asked Waverill. "Really, Inspector, I shall begin to think
you are day-dreaming! This not the package of the Nine Stars?"</p>

<p>"I will stake my reputation on that," retorted the Inspector
gruffly. "This package has never been unsealed?"</p>

<p>Waverill snatched the package and the magnifying glass the
Inspector held out to him. He examined the seals and the flap
carefully.</p>

<p>"You are right, Inspector," he said at length. "This package has
never been opened. Yet it is the original package. Mr. Gleed showed
it me once.</p>

<p>"It is not the original package," declared Ira, quietly. "This
is the true package of the Nine Stars. The other, the one the
Inspector saw before, was a dummy intended to prevent Smeardon
playing tricks with his trust."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand," exclaimed Andrews, who had taken
little interest in events that were transpiring at the desk and had
devoted his time to a further examination of the safe. "How did the
package come here. This is the compartment I examined a few minutes
ago and then it was empty. There is no door or secret
entrance."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, Mr. Andrews," replied Ira, going to the
expert's side. "This is not a single safe. It contains a double
compartment, moved by a very complex mechanism. When the safe is
used without the setting of the stars it differs in no way from the
ordinary safe. You work the combination and open the door. Set the
stars and bring them into view and you have behind the door a
different compartment usually lying below the ordinary compartment.
Cut out the stars, it is easily done by working the combination
without closing the safe and when you then close the safe the
compartment sinks down and is concealed until the stars are brought
into play. Ezra Gleed sank the secret apartment and set the stars.
When the ninth star came into view the secret compartment rose
again and we came into possession of the true package of the Nine
Stars."</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter XXIV.</h2>

<p>"You seem to know a lot about his safe, Miss Smith," said the
Inspector, at length. "Cannot you tell us more?"</p>

<p>"I could," replied Ira, coolly. "But at present I do not think I
am justified in stating theories as certainties.</p>

<p>"Are you certain the lady who calls herself Olga Pellet is the
heiress we are seeking?" asked Waverill.</p>

<p>"So far as I know at present, I can only say she is Olga
Pellet," replied Ira.</p>

<p>"Then she is the heiress," exclaimed the Inspector.</p>

<p>"That is for her to prove," answered Ira. "We tried to find her
papers at the Hotel, but could not. Had I seen them, I might have
been able to tell you more than I have done."</p>

<p>"We appear to be talking in a circle," observed Claude, rising
from his seat. "There is no more to be done here at present. Which
way are you going, Miss Smith?"</p>

<p>"Are we to leave the package of the Nine Stars here, Mr
Waverill?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>The lawyer looked at the Inspector interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I will put a. man on guard here," said the police officer. "I
should have done so from the first."</p>

<p>"Then I will leave the package here," declared the lawyer. "Can
you tell us anything about this package, Miss Smith? Are the papers
of any value?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," replied Ira. "I have information I am
withholding, but my knowledge does not extend to this package."</p>

<p>"If I remove it, I will have to replace it when we bring
Smeardon and Miss Pellet here. No, Inspector, I will leave it if
you will have the house guarded as you suggest."</p>

<p>"I will have a man round before I leave here," said the
Inspector. "This house shall be guarded night and day until we have
solved the mysteries surrounding it."</p>

<p>The Inspector took up the telephone and rang the police office.
Ira and Claude left him and the lawyer in the house to arrange the
final details. Ira was silent as they walked through the square and
into Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Claude hailed a cab.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you straight home," he observed quietly,
"You are worn out."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Ira wearily. "I am tired."</p>

<p>"Miss Smith," said Claude after a lengthy pause, "You are a
puzzle to me."</p>

<p>"Am I?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"You appear to know a lot about this hideous mystery, that we
can only guess at. Will you not confide in me so that I may help
you?"</p>

<p>"Is it not my business to know more of a mystery than others,"
replied Ira, evading his offer of help.</p>

<p>"That is the worst of it," groaned Claude. "What on earth has a
girl like you to do with mysteries and all the unpleasant
surroundings of crime? You were made for happiness and comfort and
yet you are chasing murderers and thieves and all the riff-raff of
the cities."</p>

<p>"Even a girl must work," replied Ira wearily. "I have neither
friends nor relations to keep me in comfort. I must work or
starve."</p>

<p>"But not this work," objected Claude.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" asked Ira, quickly.</p>

<p>"Shall I join the overcrowded ranks of the shop girls, earning
barely enough to keep body and soul together, the butt and prey of
her masters, the drudge and victim of her own sex who think they
show their superiority in bullying the girls who are so unfortunate
as to have to serve them? Or would you have me a typist, working
long hours in stuffy offices, a human machine worse treated than
the instrument she works all day? Or would you have me live the
lives I have seen so many girls live, the life of the household
drudge with no thought but for her legal master and the care of his
children, marrying for the shelter of a home? No, Mr Merrivale, I
am content with my lot. I am a free woman, independent, and earning
a fair living wage. I have a profession, much as you and other
people look down on it. It is a profession that exercises my wits,
provides me with the full benefits of life, gives me outdoor
employment.</p>

<p>"It teaches me much of the good things of the world, as well as
the bad. I am the equal of man. My brains and cunning are pitted
against his in the open spaces of life. I play many parts and
characters. One day I am the society lady with servants and money
at her command, yet unlike her I am exercising the wits God gave
me. Another time I am a shop girl, bearing her burden and the
drudgery uncomplainingly, yet, unlike her, looked up to and
considered by those who employ me. Would they do so if I was one of
their slaves? I live well, my body is well fed, my brain is
nourished by my constant combat with crime. I enjoy my work and its
constant change. My employers respect and honour me. Can you tell
me of any other employment where I shall get the same
consideration?"</p>

<p>"What caused you to take up this work?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"Chance. Fate. Call it what you like," replied the girl
bitterly. "I started in an office. It was the usual drudgery day
after day. Chance threw in my way a man who thought I was worth
training. He trained me and before he died he said I had made good.
Can I say more?"</p>

<p>She paused but Claude said nothing. He could not answer her
logic.</p>

<p>Then she spoke again, but with the evident intention of keeping
him away from the subject of her past.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Merrivale, what is your interest in the Gleed
Estate? I do not think you are acting logically. If I cannot
produce the right Olga Mary Pellet within a few months the estate
will pass to you. Yet you are doing all in your power to aid my
search."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"It is not what I would have you do that is under discussion,"
smiled Ira. "Most men in your position would sit tight and wait,
even if they did nothing to forward their interests. You have a
right to fight for your own. A right of intervention to protect
your interests. Yet you do not merely stand by, but you openly aid
my efforts."</p>

<p>"Is money so important?"</p>

<p>"Most people, nearly every one, think so. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Claude emphatically. "I prefer the money I earn to
that of a dead man. Mr Gleed left me ten thousand pounds. It is
very useful, I will acknowledge that, but still I prefer to work
for my own self."</p>

<p>"Ten thousand pounds," said Ira scornfully. "And he left this
girl seven millions! Have you no ambitions?"</p>

<p>"I am ambitious," replied Claude. "I am ambitious to live in
comfort with the woman I love, for my wife. Are you trying to urge
me to more?"</p>

<p>Ira did not answer. The car pulled up in the darkening street
with a jerk. Claude alighted and helped her to descend. At her door
she held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr Merrivale. I--I think you have chosen the better
part."</p>

<p>The door closed behind her and Claude dismissed the cab,
deciding to walk to the Temple. It was a long walk, but the evening
was fine and warm and he wanted to think. He was puzzled. This girl
who had come into his life affected him deeply. She was a complex
problem that he could not solve. Sometimes he thought he understood
her, and then she would change, and doubts again grew up in his
mind. Yet, in spite of all, he loved her. His whole being desired
her.</p>

<p>He could understand that this was not the time to make love to
her. She was absorbed in her work. The whole of her senses were on
the problems that confronted her in this fight for the Gleed
millions. In fact, she herself lived in an air of mystery. Once let
the Gleed estate be settled and he promised himself that he would
quickly pierce the mystery that surrounded Ira; he would see that
she did not go out of his life without his first having tried to
win her love. At present she treated him with sweet graciousness,
as a comrade in a hazardous enterprise. Could he change that? Could
he persuade her to relinquish this life of danger, yet of success,
and merge her life with his? When the opportunity came he would do
all in his power to win her to it.</p>

<p>The Temple was shrouded in its accustomed gloom as he entered
Pump Inn and ascended to his chambers. When he had lit his reading
lamp he surveyed the apartment. How bare it was. It was a room, not
even an office, certainly not a home. He hungered for the future he
dreamed of. A real home and a real woman.</p>

<p>He had no time to idle. Slipping into a loose jacket he went to
his desk. Ira was in the future, possibly a near and dear future,
but here to his hand was the work that would make that future
possible. He had to work, and work hard but, thank God, it was a
work he loved. He was quickly making way. The Gleed legacy, small
as it was in proportion to the estate, had brought him luck, for it
had brought him into touch with Waverill, who had given him his
chance. First Waverill, and then other solicitors, had recognised
that he had brains and knew how to use them. Briefs were coming in
with satisfying speed. The neatly docketed bundles of papers on his
desk were not now dummies. Most of them bore on their titles
inscriptions of satisfying fees, money that would surely one day
build a palace for his queen.</p>

<p>For some time he worked in silence. It was an interesting case
he had in hand; one that Waverill had entrusted to him. He was
determined that he would win it in spite of the many difficulties
in the way. If he could succeed in this brief he would be a marked
man. Success would be a certainty, and he could then retain only
the cases that appealed to him. Presently he reached a point where
he had to stop work for want of certain references. He picked up
his pipe and leaned back in his chair. A last smoke and then to
bed.</p>

<p>There was a noise at the door. A scraping and shuffling, then
steps descending the stairs. He was certain that someone had tried
his door. Who could it be?</p>

<p>The events of the past few months had taught him caution.
Silently he found his automatic and with it in his hand stole to
the door. The light from the room he had left shone on the door.
Just under the letter slit an envelope lay on the ground. Claude
strode quickly forward and flung open the door. There was no one
there. He bent down and picked up the envelope. It bore no address.
Tearing it open he took out a single sheet of notepaper headed with
an address in Croydon. Below were the words:</p>

<p class="letter">Come to me--Olga.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter XXV.</h2>

<p>The Tiger often boasted that he never acted on impulse, that
every coup he undertook was carefully planned to the last details,
that he would pass the greatest opportunity unless he had planned
for it. To this rule he attributed his immunity from arrest.</p>

<p>In the matter of the Gleed estate, he had planned long and
carefully. It was a coup of magnitude, and if he could bring it to
a successful conclusion, he would be able to give up this life of
plotting and, in some distant country, commence a new life. He
might do more. In some South American Republic be might make a new
and more honourable career.</p>

<p>The Gleed millions had appeared as a golden opportunity, but
from the first his plans had gone astray. First Polly had
disappeared and then Tom Britton had been murdered. On top of this,
Smeardon had been arrested for the murder of Britton. He, the
Tiger, knew that Smeardon was innocent, for had not Smeardon been
with him at the moment the fatal shot had been fired? He could have
gone to the police and tendered his evidence, but he knew he would
not be believed. He might, as the Inspector had threatened, be held
as an accessory to the murder. But he must rescue Smeardon. He had
sworn that.</p>

<p>With this idea in his mind he had entered the house in Pontin
Square and taken the package of the Nine Stars. With it in his
possession he commanded the situation. He could use it to secure
the release of Smeardon, possibly. Certainly he could get a fine
price for it if the worst came to the worst.</p>

<p>He knew the contents of the package and he was certain that the
lawyer did not. With this in his mind he approached the lawyer with
an offer to sell the package. He had intended to compel the lawyer
to aid in the escape, or to obtain the release of Smeardon. Then he
changed his mind.</p>

<p>News brought to him of the plan to bring Smeardon to the house
in Pontin Square, under arrest, on the night of the next full moon,
caused him to revise his plans. He was only helpless so long as
Smeardon was behind prison bars. Once in the streets, there was
great opportunity for a rescue. Beyond this, he had altered his
opinion about the package. It might possibly be of great pecuniary
value. The death of Tom Britton had given him the clue. He cursed
himself for not thinking of it before.</p>

<p>Why had Tom Britton gone back to the safe? It could only be for
the package. So he had thought at first, but had Tom Britton
thought so? Supposing Britton had found out that the safe held some
secret drawer and that in that drawer was something of value, it
might be papers, it might be something of more value. He could not
guess. All he knew was that the package of the Nine Stars was
valueless and that Tom Britton had met his death in seeking the
secret of the safe. He would seek the secret, but he would not meet
his death in doing so. Waverill should seek it for him.</p>

<p>It was advisable that he should be in a safe place where he
could receive the reports of his spies quickly, but safe from the
police. For some time he had had such a place. It stood half way
between Merton and Wimbledon. A large old-fashioned house situated
in large grounds behind high walls. At one time it had been used as
a private lunatic asylum and the then owner had fixed on the high
walls and iron railings. The Tiger had discovered it one day, and
had promptly purchased the lease of the property for a mere song.
There he had established his secret quarters, only the most
reliable of the gang being admitted to knowledge of it.</p>

<p>When Waverill advertised his willingness to negotiate for the
return of the package of the Nine Stars the Tiger laughed. The trap
had been baited and the victim had walked in. Contrary to the
inspector's thoughts, the Tiger was not inclined to close any deal
at present. With the package of the Nine Stars in his possession he
could wait his opportunity. Besides the package served too many
purposes to be parted with at present.</p>

<p>One evening he had come to town--the confinement at Merton
irked--and wandered about the West End. There he had a big piece of
luck. A taxi had broken down and in the occupant he had recognised
Olga Pellet. It had been easy to persuade her to trust him to aid
her and later he had found means to decoy her to a place where he
could find some of the gang.</p>

<p>The Tiger had expected there would be a hue and cry raised over
the disappearance of Olga Pellet, but nothing happened. He was
puzzled. Why had not Waverill advertised or gone to the police? Was
it possible that this girl was not the true heiress? Yet from all
he had gathered he was convinced that she was the genuine heiress
to the Gleed millions.</p>

<p>His late success had caused him some perplexity. He had the
package of the Nine Stars and Olga. On the other hand, the police
held Smeardon. They had arranged to take Smeardon to the house in
Pontin Square to hand over the package to Olga. They could not
carry out their plans so long as he held Olga, and the gang were
insistent that Smeardon should be rescued. Should he release Olga
and plan to capture Smeardon? He did not like to relinquish his
hold on Olga but he could not hold her and find a means to rescue
Smeardon.</p>

<p>The night of the fourth full moon was fast approaching and he
had not yet determined what to do. He wanted to obtain the unknown
treasure from the safe and he had--the demands of the gang
compelled it--to rescue Smeardon, It was a difficult problem and he
longed greatly for the girl Polly. If she were there he could
substitute her for Olga.</p>

<p>Word was brought to him at Merton that, through the underworld
of London, search was being made for him by some woman. He gave
orders that her photograph should be brought to him. It was in his
hands a couple of days after and he immediately recognised Polly.
The girl had returned. Where had she been? He gave orders that she
was to be at once brought to Merton.</p>

<p>"Well, Polly," he greeted her when she entered his room. "Where
have you been?"</p>

<p>"It was that woman detective," exclaimed the girl, viciously.
"She had me caught and kept me for weeks."</p>

<p>"Good for her," laughed the Tiger. "I did not think she had the
nerve. Never mind, Polly. I've got Olga Pellet."</p>

<p>"No," said Polly with deep admiration. "You're about the limit,
Bill. What are you going to do with her?"</p>

<p>"Hold her for the time," replied the Tiger. "Polly, I'm in doubt
what to do for the best."</p>

<p>"They can't get the package while you hold her," observed Polly,
as she leaned across the table to take a cigarette from the Tiger's
box.</p>

<p>"They can't get the package anyhow," replied the Tiger. "I have
that, too."</p>

<p>"The girl and the package and the police right out of the
running. It seems to me, Bill, that the Gleed people are right up
against it."</p>

<p>"So am I, Polly. To get Smeardon, I have to release Olga and the
package. The gang demand he shall be rescued."</p>

<p>"And what about the treasure? You dare not release the girl
while they hold Smeardon."</p>

<p>"I'll give the girl for Smeardon any day," said the Tiger,
reflectively. "By Jove, Polly, you've given me an idea."</p>

<p>"To exchange Matt for the girl?" said Polly doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," laughed the Tiger. "To exchange Smeardon for the girl. It
can be done. You go to her. I'll arrange that you are taken there
as a fellow prisoner or something of the sort. Sympathise with her,
win her confidence. It should not be difficult for you, Polly. Get
her to send for that cub lawyer. Mason will capture him at the
Croydon house. Then I can act."</p>

<p>"Right-o," said Polly. "It's easy, Bill. You get the package
back to them. I'll look after the girl and the boy. Say, Bill, some
people are fools."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter XXVI.</h2>

<p>Polly was taken to Croydon by the gang and soon won the
sympathies of Olga as a fellow prisoner. The heiress accepted the
first offer of friendship without hesitation and the two girls were
quickly fast friends. Polly had confessed she had been induced by
the Tiger to pose as the heiress to the Gleed estate and explained
her present position by stating she had grown tired of a life of
deceit and had been imprisoned at Croydon by order of the Tiger,
who feared she would go to the police. This was the first
intimation Olga had of where she was, and into whose hands she had
fallen.</p>

<p>In a day or two Polly informed Olga that one of the men in the
house was an old sweetheart of hers and was still in love with her.
She believed that it would be possible to persuade him to help them
escape or at least communicate with friends.</p>

<p>Olga jumped at the opportunity and under the direction of Polly
wrote a few words on a sheet of paper with the address of the house
and entrusted it to Polly to get to Claude. In a few hours Polly
informed her that the note was on its way and probably, in a night
or so, Claude Merrivale would make an attempt to free them.</p>

<p>Olga and Polly occupied the first floor of the house and they
were waited on by a sour-faced gaunt woman who had been well
tutored in her part. She treated Polly as a prisoner and refused to
hold any conversation with either of them. Every day they were
taken separately into the garden for exercise and it was on these
occasions Polly gave her instructions to the members of the gang
who were in the house.</p>

<p>The evening after Polly told Olga the note had been delivered,
the two girls spent weary hours at the window.</p>

<p>"You are sure he will come?" asked Olga for the twentieth
time.</p>

<p>"Sure as fates," promptly answered Polly. "He's too wise to come
too early but you will see him in an hour or two."</p>

<p>"What are we to do when he comes?" asked Olga.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Polly with a short laugh. "We're only women
and we must let the man do the work."</p>

<p>"Supper was brought to them by the woman and behind Olga's back
she gave Polly a quick nod. Polly drew Olga to the table and made
her eat a good supper on the pretext that they would require all
their strength. Olga continually left the table for the window.</p>

<p>"Give the poor devil a chance," said Polly.</p>

<p>"What time did he get the letter," asked Olga, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Only an hour or so ago. You must give him time to get here."
Olga had run to the window again. This time she beckoned Polly to
her side.</p>

<p>"There he is!" she whispered, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's him," said Polly without hesitation. "Now we've
only to give the signal and the band will play."</p>

<p>The windows were screwed down so they could not throw out any
message, but Polly took a bundle of papers and made a torch of
them. This she waved across the window until Claude signalled his
recognition. Claude had come to Croydon immediately on receipt of
the note from Olga. He had tried to telephone Waverill at his house
but the lawyer was not in and he did not care to leave a message.
He had readily found the address given in the note and was
searching the windows when he saw Polly's signal. He immediately
crossed the road and walked up the steps of the house.</p>

<p>His knock at the front door was not answered. The two girls
could hear the woman moving in the passage, but she made no attempt
to open the door. Polly giggled. Again Claude knocked. Then the
woman evidently made up her mind that she must get rid of the
person at the door, for they could hear her shambling steps as she
went down the hall.</p>

<p>"Is there a Miss Pellet staying here?" asked Claude, when the
door was opened.</p>

<p>"What if there is?" said the woman insolently.</p>

<p>"I want to see her."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you," replied the woman. "And what kind of house do you
think I keep to come calling on young women at this time of night.
Be off with you, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."</p>

<p>"I demand to see her," said Claude angrily.</p>

<p>"Then you come at a respectable hour, young man," retorted the
woman, trying to shut the door in his face. "I'm not going to get
my house disgraced by a lot like you. Not if I knows it."</p>

<p>"Will you take up my name to Miss Pellet," asked Claude
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I won't," said the woman, with emphasis. "And just you take
your foot from my door or I'll get a policeman to you."</p>

<p>"Do you know you are doing an illegal act by detaining that
young lady?"</p>

<p>"Detaining your grandmother," sneered the woman. "She can come
and go as long as she keeps respectable hours and has no truck with
men like you. I knows you. Come, be off with you."</p>

<p>She slammed the door in his face and he had no option but to go
out on the pavement again. He crossed the road and looked up at the
window where the girls had stood. They were still standing there.
The torch had burned out but he could see the outline of their
forms against the window. He waved to them, trying to signal that
he was going for help. Just as he was on the point of turning away,
he became aware that the girls were making some attempt to
communicate with him. He tried to read their meaning but could make
nothing of it. Then he heard a crash of glass. Polly had thrust a
cushion through the window. He waited some time, but there was no
movement in the house, so he crossed the road again.</p>

<p>He could not see the girls now, but by climbing out of the porch
he was able to get on the window-sill of the bow windows beneath.
There he could gain a glimpse of them and was within easy speaking
distance.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Miss Pellet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Polly is with me."</p>

<p>"Polly!" exclaimed Claude, in amazement. "What is she doing
there?"</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't think bad of her," said Olga quickly. "It was
her who got the note through to you. She is sorry for the way she
acted and wants to help me now."</p>

<p>"Can you get down to the street door?" asked Claude, avoiding
the subject of Polly's repentance.</p>

<p>"No. We are locked up in this room."</p>

<p>"I think I can get up to you," said Claude, after studying the
brickwork. "There seems to be something like a foothold here."</p>

<p>He could hear the girls talking excitedly above him. Then Olga
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Don't try now. Polly says that she can hear them moving about
the house. Can you come back later? Perhaps we can get down out of
the window."</p>

<p>"I'll go and fetch the police," answered Claude. "They'll soon
bring that woman to her senses."</p>

<p>"Just like a man," said Polly scornfully, speaking for the first
time. "Don't you think it would be wiser to telephone to the Tiger
that you are rescuing us, and you might let him know that Miss
Pellet will claim the package of the Nine Stars to-morrow
night?"</p>

<p>"What do you advise, Miss Polly?" he asked after a pause. He did
not quite see why he should not go the police, but Polly's sarcasm
had made him doubt the wisdom of such a course.</p>

<p>"Get a rope and come round here in a couple of hours," commanded
the girl shortly. "While you are about it, Mr. Merrivale, you might
telegraph to Mr. Waverill that you have Miss. Pellet here and will
bring her to Pontin Square to-morrow night to get the package of
the Nine Stars."</p>

<p>"You will be all right until I return?" asked Claude,
doubtfully. "They are not likely to remove you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so," replied Polly. I was doubtful when I broke
the window. They might have heard me, but they evidently did not.
They won't visit us again until morning.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Claude, "I'll go and get a rope and be
back in a couple of hours."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter XXVII.</h2>

<p>It was very late when Claude got back to the main streets, and
the shops were shut. He wandered round for some time without
finding a shop that sold rope and at last decided to try some of
the smaller streets. Here he had better luck. At a small chandler's
shop he obtained a few short lengths of rope which, if knotted
together, would perhaps serve his purpose. The man looked at him
suspiciously, but said nothing.</p>

<p>With the rope under his arm he went to the station and sent his
telegram to Waverill announcing that he had found Olga and would
bring her to town the next day. Then he wrote another telegram to
Inspector Merrivale reminding him to take Smeardon to the house in
Pontin Square the following night, where he would have Olga to
demand the package. These matters attended to, it was time to make
his way back to the house where Olga was held prisoner.</p>

<p>The house was in darkness. Claude gave a cautious whistle but
there was no answer from the girls. He whistled again and then
crossed the road and climbed to his old post in the porch. From
there he called gently to Olga but she did not reply. It was an
unexpected check. Without the aid of the girls the rope was
useless, for he could not attach it to the upper part of the house.
He sat down on the steps for some moments considering. What could
he do? Perhaps he could find a window he could force.</p>

<p>Climbing on to the sill of the bay he tried the windows as he
crawled round on the sills. At the far side he found one
unfastened. Kneeling down he managed to get the broad blade of his
penknife under and raise it sufficient to obtain a finger-hold. The
window came up easily and, parting the curtains, he stepped
cautiously into the room.</p>

<p>The light of a match revealed dimly his surroundings. It was not
a large room and poorly furnished. The door lay on the other side
of the table and he found his way there with successive matches.
There was no sound in the house and he opened the door and stepped
out into the hall. The stairs lay before him.</p>

<p>Olga had spoken from the front room of the first floor. Claude
crept up the stairs and tried the first door. It was fastened and
would have led into the back room. Then he went to the other door.
It would lead into the room where he had seen Olga. It was also
fastened. He knocked quietly and listened. There was no answer.
What had happened to Olga?</p>

<p>He did not hear a door open. A shadow stood behind him for a
moment, then a smashing blow fell on his head and he pitched
forward, hitting the door he was standing before, violently.
Someone caught him as he slipped to the ground and a rag was
stuffed into his mouth. He tried to struggle but could not. Then he
was lifted and carried downstairs. Some one lit the gas and he saw
he was in the room which he had first entered. A man, and the woman
who had answered the door to him earlier in the evening, were
standing by.</p>

<p>"A clean cop," observed the man with much satisfaction.</p>

<p>The woman giggled and shook her head at Claude in mock
reproof.</p>

<p>"You're a nice young man. A-comin' alter my lodgers at this hour
of the night."</p>

<p>"He's got a 'ead like a piece of wood," said the man retying the
gag in Claude's mouth. "I'd 'ave been all out with a smack like
that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you didn't 'it as 'ard as you thought you did," said
the woman. "Now for the get-away. Go up and give Polly the
tip."</p>

<p>The man left the room and Claude heard him stumbling up the
stairs.</p>

<p>Then there were voices above and the man came down again
treading heavily.</p>

<p>"You must be a mug," observed the woman to Claude, "a'tryin' to
give the once-over to the Tiger. Walked right inter the trap yer
did, like a bloomin' pigeon. Lor' I could 'ave laughed to see yer
treadin that light up the stairs to the girls, thinkin' we wasn't
wise to yer. And yer took in that letter of Polly's a treat.
Runnin' out 'ere all of a hurry just as she said yer would. Walked
right into it, yer did. Lor', yer are a mug."</p>

<p>She spat reflectively on the floor. The man opened the door and
pushed in his head.</p>

<p>"I'll get the carridge round and then we'll let 'is 'Ighness see
his sweetheart. Don't let him get away while I'm out of the
road."</p>

<p>"Wot are yer takin' me for," said the woman disgustedly. "He's
only a bloomin' baby. Why, I'd give 'im the knock-out with one
'and. D'yer wants me to get the cart while yer mind the baby?"</p>

<p>Without answering, the man closed the door and stumped out into
the street. Merrivale tried to collect his wits. He realised he had
walked into the trap that had been set for him. The woman was
right, he had acted like a child.</p>

<p>He was trying to think and plan, but his head ached. Polly was
not a traitor to the Tiger. Had he stopped to think he would have
realised that. There was nothing that would have brought that
about. She had not been bribed, and the last time he had seen her
she had been defiant and suspicious. Since then she must have got
in touch with the Tiger and learned that he was winning all along
the line. Why, then, had he reason to suppose that she would play
traitor to the gang? It had been her daring that had deceived him.
She had simply declared she was on their side and he, like a fool,
believed her.</p>

<p>The sound of a carriage driving up to the door filtered into the
room and immediately the man re-entered and sent the woman upstairs
for Polly. Then he examined Claude's bonds and, lifting him in his
arms, carried him out to the carriage. He returned to the house and
in a few minutes returned, bearing the insensible form of Olga.</p>

<p>"There's your young lady, mate," he said jocularly as he placed
the girl in a corner. "Miss Polly is here to see you don't get too
fresh."</p>

<p>He stepped aside and Polly entered the carriage. Then the man,
after a word with the driver entered and closed the door.</p>

<p>It was a long drive and Olga lay inert in the corner. The pain
in his head was abating and he could now think more clearly. He
tried to make out where they were driving him and, after some
effort managed to slip forward on his seat so that he could get his
face near the window. The man made no objection and he peered out.
They were driving through country lanes. Sometimes the outline of a
house was visible against the sky, but they were all in darkness
and the gag prevented him attempting to cry out for help. Presently
the pace slackened and the carriage came to a halt before a big
house. The man jumped out, followed by Polly, who immediately
entered the house. The man leaned into the carriage and loosened
the bonds round Claude's ankles.</p>

<p>"Come out," he ordered, "and be careful what you do. I'll give
you another crack on the head, if you try any funny business."</p>

<p>Claude stepped awkwardly from the carriage and looked around
him. He was standing at the foot of some steps that led up to a
large hall door. On the top step were gathered a group of men. His
conductor ordered him to ascend the steps, and when he reached the
men two of them took him by the arms and assisted him into the
house. The first man followed almost immediately bearing Olga in
his arms.</p>

<p>"Here's the decoy and there's the pigeon," he said. "Where's
this lot to go to?"</p>

<p>Polly appeared at the head of the stairs and called to the men.
Claude's conductors urged him forward. At the door of a room on the
first floor, Polly stopped and beckoned the man who held Olga to
enter.</p>

<p>"Take him to the boss," she said briefly, indicating Claude.</p>

<p>On the next floor the men halted and relieved Claude of his
bonds. Then one of them opened the door and pushed Claude into a
room. It was comfortably, even luxuriously, furnished and
brilliantly lit. On the hearthrug before a blazing fire stood a
man. He turned as Claude entered. It was the Tiger.</p>

<p>"Welcome to my house, Mr. Merrivale," he said, courteously,
indicating a seat by the fire. "I hope my men have not treated you
more roughly than necessary."</p>

<p>"This is an outrage!" exclaimed Claude, indignantly. "I demand
to be released at once."</p>

<p>The Tiger smiled quietly and lifted a cigarette from a box on
the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"Smoke? Help yourself," he said, nonchalantly. "You will learn
soon that the law does not count in this house. I am the law here.
Not smoke? Just as you please. You may want one later."</p>

<p>"I demand to be released," said Claude, angrily.</p>

<p>"You are free from your bonds, Mr Merrivale," replied the Tiger,
coolly. "You really cannot think I should go to all the trouble of
capturing you, only to set you free on your demand. If you are wise
you will put up with a little temporary inconvenience, if only for
the sake of the lady.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"I mean," replied the Tiger, slowly and distinctly, "if you
choose to make yourself a trouble to us, Miss Pellet will have to
suffer for your sins."</p>

<p>"You hound!"</p>

<p>"Hard words do not affect me. Take my advice and behave
yourself. Your stay under my roof may not be a long one."</p>

<p>"How long do you intend to keep me?"</p>

<p>"Until I obtain possession of the Nine Stars," was the startling
reply.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? You wrote to Mr. Waverill and said you had
the package of the Nine Stars. We searched the safe and found it
missing."</p>

<p>"That is so. I have the package of the Nine Stars. Now I want
the Nine Stars."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter XXVIII.</h2>

<p>It was the night of the fourth full moon. The Tiger had driven
up from Merton and, leaving the car in charge of a member of the
gang, had walked into the Square. He was early for the appointment
Waverill had made and strolled along, carefully considering the
plans he had laid for the evening's work. So far as he could guess
he had safeguarded everything. In a few moments he would be
discussing with the lawyer the terms on which he was prepared to
return the package of the Nine Stars. That the lawyer would refuse
his terms he could not contemplate. He held the whip hand, for he
had the package of the Nine Stars in his pocket.</p>

<p>At Merton he held Olga and Claude prisoners. He would hand over
his prisoners and the package for the contents of the safe. It was
a sporting offer and he stood to lose or win much for he had no
idea of what the safe really contained. This only he knew: Ezra
Gleed would not have placed so many safeguards, so much secrecy,
around a safe that did not hold some great treasure. Tom Britain
had guessed this. Finally, there remained Smeardon. He was pledged
to obtain the release of Smeardon. The gang had demanded it and he
dare not refuse. Again he had boasted that he never deserted his
associates when they fell in the hands of the authorities. He did
not like Smeardon. More, he distrusted him, suspecting him of
treachery in the past. Had he only himself to consider he might
have left Smeardon to his fate but he could not do that without
betraying the gang.</p>

<p>A little way from, Gleed's house a well-dressed man stopped him
and asked for a light. The Tiger handed over his match box and as
the man returned it he muttered a few words. The Tiger gave an
answering nod. His men were posted and ready. Inspector Pemberton
answered the Tiger's knock and led the way into the study. There
Ira and Waverill were waiting. The lawyer made no reply to the
Tiger's greeting and motioned him to a seat.</p>

<p>"There is the matter of the safe conduct," drawled the Tiger
slowly. "I did not understand I was to have the pleasure of meeting
Inspector Pemberton this evening."</p>

<p>"My presence here is your safe conduct," answered the Inspector,
gruffly. "You will be permitted to leave these premises unmolested.
When you leave this room I shall wait fifteen minutes, then orders
will be given for your arrest."</p>

<p>"That is sufficient. I shall not be followed, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"I have given my word," replied the Inspector, impatiently. "You
are free from arrest and observation for fifteen minutes after
leaving this room."</p>

<p>"Very well, Inspector. Now, Mr Waverill, we will get to
business;"</p>

<p>"You have the package of the Nine Stars," asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"It is in my pocket," replied the Tiger, boldly. "You write you
are prepared to return it to me in return for the contents of the
safe."</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Are you aware of what you ask for?" The lawyer hesitated, and
then reframed the question. "Do you know the contents of the
safe?"</p>

<p>"I require the contents of that safe." replied the Tiger,
pointing to the safe now standing open.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to state what the contents are?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you know the contents of the safe?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then you are asking for something, the nature of which you are
not aware."</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"How do you intend to identify the contents you require."</p>

<p>"I am trusting to your honour. You will obtain the contents and
hand it over to me."</p>

<p>"We carefully examined the safe after receipt of your demand.
Are you surprised to learn that we can find nothing?"</p>

<p>"I quite expected that."</p>

<p>"Then we hand you nothing for the package."</p>

<p>The Tiger remained silent.</p>

<p>"How do you propose we shall proceed? The safe contains
nothing."</p>

<p>"I have said I will take your word of honour to hand me the
contents of the safe. I am not surprised that at the present time
you have not found the secret of the safe. I am prepared to hand
you over the package now and wait until you obtain the contents of
the safe for me."</p>

<p>"Will your wait be long?" asked Ira, suddenly.</p>

<p>"I cannot say." The Tiger turned to the girl as he spoke. "I may
have to wait some time, or you may be successful almost at once. My
opinion is that you will hand me my--er--reward within a week after
Miss Pellet complies with the condition of the will and obtains
possession of the package of the Nine Stars."</p>

<p>"When will that be?" continued Ira.</p>

<p>"If you accept my terms," replied the Tiger, looking at his
watch. "No, she cannot be here to-night. Shall we say the next full
moon night?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the lawyer.</p>

<p>"I am not prepared to answer any further questions," rising from
his chair and picking up his hat. "Are you accepting my terms?"</p>

<p>"We have had an expert examine the safe and he states there are
no secret compartments. He is emphatic on that point," declared
Waverill. "Do you still adhere to your demand in face of that
opinion."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you opened the package of the Nine Stars?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>"I know the contents."</p>

<p>"And you are aware that the package contains only blank
papers?"</p>

<p>"I am aware of that."</p>

<p>Ira went to the safe and produced the package she had found in
the secret compartment.</p>

<p>"Here is the package of the Nine Stars. The package you have in
your possession is only a dummy. Is this what you required when you
demanded the unknown contents of the safe?"</p>

<p>"That is not the contents of the safe," declared the Tiger,
angrily. "This is an attempt to trick me."</p>

<p>"Then this is not what you require?" asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>"No. I demand the contents of the safe, when they are
found."</p>

<p>"So far we have only this package. The safe is empty."</p>

<p>"It is a trick," persisted the Tiger. "I know the Inspector has
the matrix of the seal of the Nine Stars I made when I opened the
package of the Nine Stars. He, or you, have made a dummy package to
deceive me."</p>

<p>"Come and examine it," suggested Ira, placing the package on the
table.</p>

<p>"Do you think that seal was made from a matrix? You can see from
its sharp edges it was made with the original seal. You are not to
touch it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Mr. Waverill can tell us where the original seal is
now," suggested the Tiger, cunningly.</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the lawyer. "The seal is not among the
Gleed papers. We have searched everywhere for it."</p>

<p>The Tiger bent over the package and examined the seal. He could
not deny Ira's statement that it had been made with the original
cut stone. It was an exact replica of the package he had, at that
moment, in his possession. Furtively, his hand stole to his
pocket.</p>

<p>"Are you satisfied?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>The Tiger did not answer. His brain was working quickly as his
hand stole up to his breast pocket. Give him the opportunity to
place those packages side by side and he would certainly trick
these very confiding people. A moment more--</p>

<p>"Put your hands down, Tiger." It was the Inspector who
spoke.</p>

<p>The Tiger glanced up. The Inspector was standing at the other
side of the table and pointing direct at the Tiger was a formidable
looking automatic.</p>

<p>"You have the other package in your breast pocket, Tiger,"
continued the Inspector, quietly. "I have no intention that you
shall change the packages. Put your hands down and keep them
down."</p>

<p>"You are all very clever," laughed the Tiger, straightening
himself.</p>

<p>"I would have been taken in by the play had I not known
better."</p>

<p>"You are not satisfied that we have told you the truth?" asked
Waverill.</p>

<p>"The truth! No. This is not the true package of the Nine Stars.
You may have made it to deceive me. More probably you made it so
that you could get the Gleed estate for Miss Pellet without the
true package, now in my possession. No, Mr Waverill, I will keep my
word with you. The contents of the safe for the package of the Nine
Stars. Do you agree?"</p>

<p>"The safe is open. Would you like to search it?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, no. I prefer you to search it for me."</p>

<p>"The safe is empty."</p>

<p>"That it is empty now does not worry me. Will you accept my
offer?"</p>

<p>"I refuse." The lawyer spoke emphatically and turned his back on
the rogue.</p>

<p>"Where is Olga Pellet?" enquired Ira.</p>

<p>"She is in my charge," laughed the Tiger. "I have no objection
to telling you that."</p>

<p>"Is she well?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you. She will be delighted when I tell her of
your kind enquiries."</p>

<p>"What do you want to release her?" asked the lawyer, turning
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Nothing you can offer me, now," said the Tiger sternly. "You
have refused my terms. I will now take what I want. Olga Pellet is
my prisoner and I have the true package of the Nine Stars. Two of
the three pawns in the game are mine. Soon the police will be
forced to release Matthew Smeardon and then he will come to me. He
will hand over the package of the Nine Stars to Miss Pellet under
my directions for she will not be released until she comes to my
terms."</p>

<p>"What terms are you offering her," asked Ira, inquisitively.</p>

<p>The Tiger laughed again. He was recovering his poise. These
people were but fools and, for the inspector, he held a growing
contempt. Shortly he would read that self-opinionated official a
well deserved lesson.</p>

<p>"My terms to Miss Pellet," he drawled, staring boldly at Ira. "I
do not think Miss Pellet will object to your knowing, although we
have made no formal announcement yet. Miss Pellet will be offered
freedom--as my wife."</p>

<p>"And if she refuses?"</p>

<p>"Then she will, perforce, stay in my charge until she recognises
and rewards my devotion." The Tiger made Ira a mocking bow and
turned to the door. "I have your word for fifteen minutes,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>The door closed behind him, noisily. The Inspector looked at his
watch.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter XXIX.</h2>

<p>"Are you going to follow the Tiger, Inspector?" asked
Waverill.</p>

<p>"Not much good," said the officer, regretfully. "He is to have
fifteen minute's grace and that will be plenty for him to get to
safety. I was thinking of Mr. Merrivale and Miss Pellet. They
should be here now."</p>

<p>"Do you think Mr. Merrivale succeeded?" asked Ira. "The Tiger
was certain he had Olga."</p>

<p>"Even if Merrivale failed he would come here to let us know,"
said the Inspector. "I am having Smeardon brought here on the
strength of his promise to produce Miss Pellet."</p>

<p>"He cannot have failed," said Waverill, emphatically. "He
telegraphed to me this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Have you the telegram?" asked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Yes." The lawyer searched his pockets and finally produced the
telegram. "He says:</p>

<p class="letter">"Olga unwell, requires rest, meet you Pontin
Square to-night. Merrivale."</p>

<p>"Then he should be here soon," said Ira. "What of your charge,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Here any moment," replied the Inspector, promptly. "I gave
instructions for him to be here at eight sharp. Didn't want him too
early in case we have to wait for Miss Pellet. An hour should see
us well through the business even if they are a little late."</p>

<p>"I want a word with Smeardon if possible, before Mr. Merrivale
arrives," said Ira. "I hope he will come soon."</p>

<p>"Going to probe him about this mysterious treasure the Tiger has
on his mind," laughed the Inspector. "For my part I don't think
there's anything in it. The Tiger is barking up the wrong tree, for
once in his life."</p>

<p>"Yet we cannot take chances that he is mistaken," said the girl,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Quite right, Miss," answered the Inspector. "It never does to
neglect a clue in these matters. Hullo, here they are."</p>

<p>A cab had driven up to the house and the Inspector went to the
door. He returned, preceding Matthew Smeardon in the custody of two
constables.</p>

<p>Smeardon had not altered during his confinement. He walked into
the room with his head bent and casting furtive glances round him.
The Inspector placed a seat for him and the constables stationed
themselves one each side of his chair.</p>

<p>"I have had you brought here, Matthew Smeardon," said the
lawyer, "to make amends so far as possible for your treachery in
the matter of the Gleed estate. I will not promise you that what
you may do here will serve you in your present position. That is
out of my power. You are charged with an offence so grave that no
earthly influence can help you. I think, however, that you may
realise that, in view of the very grave evidence against you, you
may possibly never have another opportunity of righting the great
wrong you committed against your trust."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" asked Smeardon.</p>

<p>"You have been brought here to hand over the package of the Nine
Stars to Miss Pellett."</p>

<p>Smeardon looked round the room.</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She will be here soon," interposed Ira. "Before she comes we
want some information from you."</p>

<p>"What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>Waverill went to the desk and arranged his papers.</p>

<p>"Will you make a statement of your dealings with the Gleed
estate, or will you answer questions we put to you?"</p>

<p>"I have no statement to make," said Smeardon, carelessly. "What
questions do you wish to, ask me?"</p>

<p>"You will answer our questions?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Its no good, Smeardon," interrupted the Inspector. "I was in
Court when that boy promised you that the Tiger would see you out
of this, but he can't. I've seen to that. Get this Gleed matter off
your mind. You've enough to worry about with the other charge."</p>

<p>"Ask your questions. I'll answer if I choose."</p>

<p>"How many times did you open the safe," asked Ira.</p>

<p>"Five or six."</p>

<p>"When did you open the package of the Nine Stars?"</p>

<p>"I did not open it."</p>

<p>"We know it has been opened. Who opened it? The Tiger?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"The night Tom Britton was shot."</p>

<p>"You found only blank papers in the envelope?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you test those papers for invisible writing?"</p>

<p>"The Tiger did."</p>

<p>"How long was it between the opening of the package and the
shooting of Tom Britton?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer. I am instructed by my solicitor to refuse
to answer any questions relating to the death of Tom Britton."</p>

<p>"Was Tom Britton in the room when the package was opened?"</p>

<p>"I refuse to answer."</p>

<p>"Are you aware that the package you opened is not the package of
the Nine Stars?"</p>

<p>"No." Smeardon showed he was puzzled by the question.</p>

<p>"Do you think that Mr. Gleed placed a dummy package in the safe
to deceive you?"</p>

<p>"He might have done," said Smeardon after some consideration.
"It would be like him to do such a thing."</p>

<p>"Here is the true package of the Nine Stars," continued Ira,
taking the package from the desk. "Will you hand this over to Miss
Pellet tonight?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any option in the matter," said Smeardon, wryly. "I
can't get out of it if I want to."</p>

<p>"Did Mr Gleed tell you anything about the package of the Nine
Stars?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of it until he signed his will."</p>

<p>"Have you ever used that safe?"</p>

<p>Ira pointed to the safe which had been left open.</p>

<p>"No, Mr Gleed always kept the combination secret until the day
he died. Then he told me."</p>

<p>"Were you here when the safe was installed?"</p>

<p>"I was in Mr Gleed's employ at the time. He sent me on a message
on the Continent. When I returned, the safe was installed and
locked."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been in the room when Mr Gleed has used the
safe?"</p>

<p>"Often."</p>

<p>"Did you attempt to learn the combination?"</p>

<p>A look of cunning came into Smeardon's face as he answered in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Did you succeed?"</p>

<p>"No. Old Gleed was too wide awake."</p>

<p>"Is there any secret mechanism to the safe?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," replied Smeardon, with a look of
astonishment.</p>

<p>"I am going to be honest with you," said Ira after a pause. "The
Tiger has made us an offer to exchange the package of the Nine
Stars he stole from the safe--the one you and he opened--for the
contents of the safe."</p>

<p>Smeardon quickly lowered his eyes that the girl might not see
that she had conveyed information to him. The Tiger knew something.
He had discovered that the safe contained something besides the
package of the Nine Stars. He must find out more.</p>

<p>"If I am to help you," he said quietly, "You must tell me what
the Tiger said. You say he offered to exchange the package of the
Nine Stars for the contents of the safe. Did be say what the
contents were?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Ira.</p>

<p>"Have you searched for what the Tiger requires?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and have found nothing."</p>

<p>"What did he say when you told him that?"</p>

<p>"He expected some such reply and offered to wait until we found
what he required."</p>

<p>"Did you accept his offer?"</p>

<p>"We did not," interjected the lawyer, who had taken a transcript
of the questions and answers.</p>

<p>Smeardon rose from his seat.</p>

<p>"I am ready to go, Inspector."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you will not help us?" asked Ira.</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Is it that you cannot or will not?"</p>

<p>"Just as you please."</p>

<p>"Answer the question," snapped the Inspector, swinging Smeardon
quickly round to face Ira.</p>

<p>"Take it as you please," said! Smeardon, angrily. "I shall have
my freedom soon and if there is anything in that safe I will find
it myself."</p>

<p>Waverill looked at his watch. It was after nine and neither Olga
nor Merrivale had turned up. The time of the new moon had passed
and before they could do more another month must pass. He nodded to
the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Take him back," said the Inspector to the constables.</p>

<p>One of the constables led the way to the street door, Smeardon
following, and the remaining constable brought up the rear. On the
step there was a pause while the constable standing beside the cab
opened the door. Then Smeardon descended the steps and as he
reached the open door of the cab, stepped to the right. One of the
constables who had Smeardon in charge grabbed at him, but the man
at the door of the cab knocked him down with a terrific blow from a
sandbag. At the same moment, men sprang up on all sides and the
police were beaten and buffeted about. Almost as quickly as the
affair had started, it ended, and when the Inspector gained the
pavement the assailants were out of sight. Both constables were
lying on the ground insensible.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Waverill who, with, Ira had followed
the Inspector out of the house.</p>

<p>"Just what I thought," groaned the Inspector. "He's gone. This
is some of the Tiger's work."</p>

<p>The Tiger had planned well and truly. Smeardon had escaped from
the clutches of the law and was now with the Tiger, free to plot
and work for the Gleed millions. For the time he held all the
tricks. The Inspector expressed himself in forcible words.</p>

<p>"He hasn't the true package of the Nine Stars," said Waverill,
consolingly. "And you should not have much difficulty in getting
Smeardon again."</p>

<p>"He'll get that package, don't you worry about that," said the
Inspector, grimly. "That man has the luck of the devil, his
master."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter XXX.</h2>

<p>When the Tiger left the house in Pontin Square he went straight
to Merton; to linger in the vicinity to watch the rescue of
Smeardon was to take big risks. He had able lieutenants and his
plans had been carefully laid and his presence might have
complicated matters.</p>

<p>He was confident that the police would carry out their plans of
bringing Smeardon to the house in Pontin Square to meet Miss Pellet
and hand over the package of the Nine Stars. To obviate any
mistake, be had despatched the telegram signed with Merrivale's
name, stating Olga was rescued and would be at Pontin Square that
night.</p>

<p>Yet he was uneasy. His interview with Waverill had not turned
out as he had planned. The discovery of the second package of the
Nine Stars had upset his calculations. He had thought that he held
the master hand; that the lawyer must agree to the terms he
dictated. At the interview he had declared that the second package
was a fake, but this he did not believe. He knew Smeardon and he
could make a good guess at the personality of Ezra Gleed. He
realised that the old financier would not trust his secretary
further than he had to. Why he had trusted him at all was a
puzzle.</p>

<p>While he waited he tried to realise what had been in the old
financier's mind when he planned his will. First he had something
of value to conceal. That was certain. Then that "something" had to
be concealed from every one other than the true heiress. It could
not be left in trust with the lawyer because--</p>

<p>Here was the stumbling block. Had the old financier a secret he
could not confide to his lawyer? Was that the reason he had given a
partial trust to Matthew Smeardon? Yes, it must be so.</p>

<p>Ezra Gleed had something to conceal. He had to trust Matthew
Smeardon until the arrival of his heiress. Yet he knew that
Smeardon was unreliable and would betray his trust if he could. To
protect his secret he made the false package of the Nine Stars and
concealed the true package. Smeardon, if treacherous, would, as he
did, deal with the false package. The true package lay hid until
discovered by this girl detective. The second package, then, would
contain the secret of the financier.</p>

<p>What did that package contain? There could be no doubt but that
it contained the secret he had bargained with Waverill to possess.
He must get it into his hands. Well, that would be easy when he had
Smeardon with him again.</p>

<p>From the treasure, his thoughts turned to Olga Pellet. It had
been a chance shot when he said he would marry Olga and thus obtain
control of the Gleed estate. He had said it to annoy these smug,
self-satisfied people. But now, looking at the idea in the cold
light of reasoning, the proposition had much to recommend it. He
had Olga in his power. It would be easy to persuade her to marry
him. If not, well, there were ways and means.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his meditations by the entry of one of his
men with Smeardon. Dismissing the man he motioned Smeardon to come
across to the fire.</p>

<p>"A bit different from your late lodgings, Matt."</p>

<p>"Why the devil did you leave me there so long?" was Smeardon's
ungracious retort.</p>

<p>"I could do little while you were behind the prison bars,"
replied the Tiger. "You got my message in the police court?"</p>

<p>"The boy? Yes! I got it," said Smeardon leaning forward with his
elbows on his knees. "I waited day after day for you to move. God!
It was awful."</p>

<p>"Well, I did my best. You don't seem grateful, Matt."</p>

<p>"What have I done to be grateful about. Do you expect me to bow
and scrape for the privilege of a month or more in jail," answered
Smeardon bitterly. "I've lost all I had worked for. All my work
with that old miser, Ezra Gleed, gone for nothing. I'm a criminal,
an outcast."</p>

<p>"What were you before," said the Tiger roughly. "Cut the cant,
Matt. You must have feathered your nest pretty well during your
four years' work."</p>

<p>"Well, it's gone," replied Smeardon, woefully. "I can't get at
it now."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not for the present," said the Tiger. "Later I may be
able to help you to it. But first we have to discover who killed
Tom Britton."</p>

<p>"I can't understand that," exclaimed Smeardon, jumping up and
pacing the room. "Only the three of us were in the house. I'll
swear to that. You and me were down in the cellar. Tom was in the
library. How was he killed?"</p>

<p>"That is what we have to find out, Matt. There's one other
thing, too, on the board?"</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The secret of the safe."</p>

<p>"I've heard of that," said Smeardon slowly. "They were
questioning me about it at Pontin Square to-night. What do you know
about it?"</p>

<p>"I am convinced that Britton met his death while he was
endeavouring to discover the secret of the safe. Did the old lawyer
ask you about that?"</p>

<p>"It was the girl. I guessed she had that in her mind."</p>

<p>"Did you tell her what you knew?"</p>

<p>"Not much! I wasn't giving them anything they did not know."</p>

<p>"Then you know something."</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"You will tell me." The Tiger's voice grew hard.</p>

<p>"Not on your life," said Smeardon quickly. Then he looked up at
the Tiger's face and his courage forsook him. "What do you want to
know, Tiger?"</p>

<p>"All you can tell me about the safe, its contents, and the
charge old Ezra Gleed gave you."</p>

<p>"It isn't much on the whole and I hadn't thought about it until
they questioned me of it. I had always thought I was simply to get
ten thousand pounds for handing a package to Miss Pellet when she
asked me for it. Now I begin to suspect more."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Tiger, there's two packages."</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"I didn't, until that girl asked me to-night. Now I can guess a
lot. Look here, Tiger. Ezra Gleed was one of those men who are
always financing petty States and kingdoms. He was supposed to have
retired from business. It was a blind. He did bigger business after
he retired than he did before."</p>

<p>"Take it for granted."</p>

<p>"Well, one day he told me to take a letter for him to Altania. A
day or two before, he told me he was going to have a safe built
into the study wall. He asked me about it and I said I would see to
it. Then he said he would see about it himself and sent me off to
Altania. When I got back I found he had the safe installed and he
would not tell me the combination."</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"I asked questions of the servants, but they could tell me
little. All I could find out was that the safe had been brought
from America. One of the servants saw 'US.A.' on the packing cases.
Another thing I found out was that it had been erected by a Mr.
Ernest Pellet."</p>

<p>"Ernest Pellet!" exclaimed the Tiger. "Any relation of the girl
he left his money to?"</p>

<p>"Her father. Old Gleed had sent for him. Pellet was one of the
finest safe makers in the World. He could make a safe no-one could
open but himself, and he could open every other safe."</p>

<p>"He'd have been a useful man to us," observed the Tiger with a
loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh! he was straight," replied Smeardon with a grimace. "I tried
him on the lay once and he would not bite."</p>

<p>"Oh! you met him. Where?"</p>

<p>"In the States. Gleed took me over once and Pellet came to see
him. It was before there was any talk of the safe."</p>

<p>"What kind of a man was Pellet?' asked the Tiger.</p>

<p>"A fool. Just a common fool except for safe work. There he was a
genius. He used to come to see the old man and try to borrow money.
Got it too. Old Gleed was wild with him. Used to swear at him, and
after he had left. But he gave him money for his wife's sake. She
was some relation of Gleed's."</p>

<p>"His elder sister," suggested the Tiger.</p>

<p>"That's it," replied Smeardon, quickly. "It was in the will and
I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"Had he any family?"</p>

<p>"Of course he had. Where do you think this girl came from?"</p>

<p>"Oh! a wife and daughter."</p>

<p>"Two daughters," replied Smeardon. "One was away from home all
the time. The other I met sometimes when Gleed sent me to Pellet's
house. She was a schoolgirl then. Later she went into a typing and
shorthand school. Then she became typist in a big engineering
works. Oh! I know her well."</p>

<p>"And her name?' asked the Tiger, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Olga Mary Pellet."</p>

<p>"The girl who claimed against Polly?"</p>

<p>"That's her. I recognised her the moment I set eyes on her, but
she didn't remember me."</p>

<p>The Tiger leaned back in his chair and laughed loud and
long.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter XXXI.</h2>

<p>"The young lady is upstairs now," said the Tiger when he had
recovered his composure. "Do you know, Matt, I have been thinking
she was a fake."</p>

<p>"Upstairs? Here?" Smeardon's eyes glistened at the news. "Do you
mean to say you persuaded her to come here?"</p>

<p>"Just so. I have prevailed on Miss Pellet to accept my
hospitality. Don't look so thunderstruck, Matt."</p>

<p>"It's the best thing that could happen, Tiger. Don't you see? We
have the game in our hands now."</p>

<p>"How?" The Tiger's face had grown hard. "In what way can we make
use of Olga Pellet except to hold her until we get the
treasure?"</p>

<p>Smeardon was pacing the room in agitation. He was debating
whether he should trust the Tiger with his secret. He had to, for
was not he and Olga in the rogue's power? Yet would the Tiger fall
in with his views.</p>

<p>"I want that girl, Tiger,"</p>

<p>"So? She happens to be my prisoner."</p>

<p>"I want that girl, Tiger," repeated Smeardon. "I mean to have
her."</p>

<p>The Tiger fixed his eyes on his subordinate. His face had grown
longer and more wolfish. He was leaning forward looking at Smeardon
as if he was trying to read his secret thoughts. For a moment
Smeardon thought he was going to give way to one of his rare bursts
of passion, and cringed in anticipation.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Matt?"</p>

<p>"It's no game. That girl is more than any game to me."</p>

<p>"So! You have fallen in love with her, and at your time of
life."</p>

<p>"Leave that alone, Tiger," Smeardon faced round angrily. "I may
not be a youngster. I may be older than you. I may be double that
girl's age, but I want her and I mean to have her."</p>

<p>"Is the lady willing?" asked the Tiger. He was faced with a new
position in his plans. He had looked upon Smeardon as but a pawn in
the game for the large stake he was playing--a pawn he fully
intended to cast aside when he had attained his object. Now he had
to look on him as a rival for the hand of Olga. More, a menace to
his plans.</p>

<p>"I don't care if she is willing or not. I'll have her."</p>

<p>"None of that, Matt." The Tiger spoke sharply. "The girl is
under my care and you will leave her alone."</p>

<p>"Care? Why don't you say she is a guest, at once?"</p>

<p>"If you like," replied the Tiger indifferently. "She is enjoying
my hospitality and that is enough for you."</p>

<p>"Hospitality! With her door locked, I suppose. Fine hospitality
that."</p>

<p>"None of your business, Matt. I'll treat her as I please but you
shall not. If the girl is willing to look on you as a possible
husband I'll not object, but you'll see her when and where I wish.
That's the final word."</p>

<p>Smeardon stopped in his pacing and walked up to the Tiger.</p>

<p>"I tell you that girl is mine and I'll have her."</p>

<p>"With or without her consent," laughed the Tiger.</p>

<p>"Yes. With or without her consent, but she'll consent fast
enough when I've done with her. She'll be only too glad to marry me
then."</p>

<p>"I told you none of that, Matt," said the Tiger threateningly,
looking straight in Smeardon's face, now distorted with evil
passion.</p>

<p>"And I say she is mine and I will do as I like with her. I know
you, Tiger Trantor, you want that girl for yourself, but you shall
never have her."</p>

<p>The Tiger walked back to his seat. Smeardon had guessed right,
but he did not intend to enter into any discussion on that point
with him. Yet he was willing to appear to appear straight with
Smeardon. The gang would demand that. Yes, he should have his
chance, such as it was. He had no fear of the result. Himself on
the one side, young, virile, and not bad looking. On the other,
Gleed's Secretary, an old man, wizen, dirty, a craven.</p>

<p>And the prize! Not only the girl, and a girl he felt he could
love and live with, but the mastery of the Gleed millions. In some
far country he could reconstruct his life, be a free man, not again
haunted by dread of the hand of the law. He would treat her well,
give her all the luxury she could crave for, the luxury he loved
for himself. What had Smeardon to give her? He would treat her as a
slave and hoard her millions as a miser.</p>

<p>He would run little risk in making a bargain with Smeardon, for
between the two men the girl's choice could be but a foregone
conclusion. Yet by this bargain he would satisfy the sporting
instincts of his associates, and, if the worst came to the worst,
the girl was always in his power.</p>

<p>He had enough influence in the gang to gain his ends whatever
steps be might take.</p>

<p>"Where is she now?' asked Smeardon, turning to the door.</p>

<p>"Where you'll not get at her," retorted the Tiger. "Come and sit
down, Matt."</p>

<p>"It's true then," cried Smeardon, viciously. "You are after that
girl, but you shan't have her. She's mine."</p>

<p>"Well! What if I am?"</p>

<p>"You're in love with her," repeated Smeardon staring vaguely at
the Tiger. "I know it."</p>

<p>"If I'm in love with her, Matt, I'll marry her in spite of you
or anyone else. Sit down like a reasonable man and I'll deal fairly
by you. You shall have your chance."</p>

<p>Smeardon left the door and came slowly towards the fireplace
where the Tiger was seated. He had his eyes fixed on the Tiger as
if fascinated, but there was a lurking broodiness that revealed a
mind off the balance. His fear of the Tiger was disappearing. His
mind was set on this girl. From the night when the Tiger had left
her in the house in Pontin Square alone with him he had desired
her.</p>

<p>The Tiger was thinking. He had said he would give Smeardon his
chance. But what chance would he give him? It must be one neither
Smeardon nor his associates could grumble at, yet not one that
would imperil in any way his determination to wed this girl. For
the time it was only necessary to promise that Smeardon should have
the opportunity to see the girl and make love to her. The thought
of Smeardon's love making brought a smile to his lips. Surely that
alone would be sufficient to bring the girl to his arms, especially
if he let her think he would surrender her to Smeardon if she
refused his offer.</p>

<p>A hand fastened on his throat and his head was forced violently
backwards. He half rose from the chair, but was thrown back again
by the weight on his chest. He looked up, and there close to his
own was Smeardon's mad, rage-distorted face. His senses were
reeling. A violent effort and he was free. He backed to the centre
of the room, clutching at his collar to gain breath. The madman
followed him.</p>

<p>In an ordinary struggle, the Tiger would have thought little of
Smeardon, but now the man was mad. He must get help and quickly. If
he could get to the other side of the desk there was a concealed
bell under the carpet that would bring help. He tempted Smeardon to
one side. The madman followed. With a wrench he got free and ran
round the desk. He stretched out his foot and as he touched the
concealed knob he slipped and fell. With a bound Smeardon was on
him clutching at his throat.</p>

<p>Over and over they rolled, flinging the furniture on all sides.
Smeardon was seeking a hold on the other's throat. The Tiger was
evading the hold as best he might, and hitting fierce half arm
jolts to Smeardon's head. They were telling, he could tell that,
but his own strength was fast going. The madman had the hold he
sought and the Tiger could feel the fingers sinking into the soft
skin of his throat. The lights were dancing before his eyes and he
felt himself sinking into an unfathomable abyss. Something crashed
forward on him and then the pain in his throat relaxed. He heard a
voice calling to him. Then the weight was taken oft his chest.</p>

<p>Someone was holding a glass of water to his lips and the touch
of the ice cold water burned his aching throat. He opened his eyes
and looked up. He was resting on Polly's knee and she was looking
down at him with grave concern.</p>

<p>"Where is Matt?" he whispered.</p>

<p>The girl looked round. The Tiger struggled to a sitting position
and followed her glance. On the floor lay Smeardon unconscious.</p>

<p>"I knocked him down with the ruler," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Press the bell under the desk," said Tiger. "It' will bring
some of the boys here."</p>

<p>The girl obeyed. Almost immediately a couple of men entered the
room. At the Tiger's command they bound Smeardon and sat him in a
chair.</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Nothing much, Polly," said the Tiger with a laugh, getting to
his feet. "The confinement in prison, must have turned Matt's
brain. He calls it love."</p>

<p>The words aroused Smeardon. He wriggled in the chair and tried
to rise.</p>

<p>"Yes, I love her. I love her and he wants to take her from
me."</p>

<p>"Who wants to take her from' you?" asked Polly looking from one
man to the other.</p>

<p>"The Tiger. He loves Olga Pellet and he is trying to take her
from me, but she belongs to me. I will have her."</p>

<p>"Is this true?" asked Polly turning to the Tiger.</p>

<p>"Is what true?"</p>

<p>"He wants to marry Olga Pellet."</p>

<p>"So he says."</p>

<p>"Do you want to marry that girl?"</p>

<p>"Mind your own business." said the Tiger viciously. The late
struggle had been almost too much for even his iron nerves. "What
is it to you what I intend to do? You and Matt will do as you're
told."</p>

<p>"I'll look after this, Matt," said Polly, slowly. "He shall
never marry Olga Pellet while I am alive."</p>

<p>She walked up to where the Tiger was standing and deliberately
struck him across the mouth with the back of her hand.</p>

<p>"You devil!" exclaimed the Tiger.</p>

<p>"Glad you acknowledge that," the girl replied, walking to the
door. "I am a devil and you shall know it better soon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter XXXII.</h2>

<p>The next morning Smeardon awoke to find himself in bed with a
bad headache. He looked round the room; how had he come here? Where
was the Tiger?</p>

<p>Slowly memory came back. He remembered the rescue, the hurried
journey to Merton, and the scene with the Tiger. He sprang out of
bed and hurried to the window. It looked across the gardens and he
guessed be was on the second floor of the house. Then he crossed to
the door. It was locked.</p>

<p>He was remembering now, the fight in the Tiger's room. They had
quarrelled about Olga and he had almost throttled the Tiger. His
fingers warmed at the thought. The Tiger had said he was mad. Yes.
He had been mad, but he was sane now. He loved and desired the
girl. He would now plan and scheme to get his way. Fighting was not
for him; he was too old; he must pit his brains, not his muscles,
against the Tiger.</p>

<p>He had accused the Tiger of being in love with Olga. That might
be true. He was in love with the girl, himself. But was the Tiger?
He did not think so. The Tiger was too cold-blooded. He would not
let the thought of a woman come between him and his ambition. The
Tiger might want to marry Olga. That was more likely. With the girl
as his wife he would have the legal control of the Gleed estate. It
was what he had been planning himself when his desires had turned
to madness and ruined his schemes.</p>

<p>What could he do now? He was a prisoner. The Tiger would not
forgive that unprovoked assault. He would be a prisoner until the
Tiger's plans had materialised, and he was necessary to their
execution. Then he would be brought from his prison and made to
play the part allotted to him. He would have no option. He
shuddered as he remembered a day when he had seen the Tiger coerce
a man to his will. It had not been a pleasant sight and Smeardon
realised he had not the courage to stand against the Tiger's will.
The Tiger would have no mercy on him. He had that blow to repay,
and with interest.</p>

<p>The parting of the ways had begun when he had tried to force
Olga to marry him in the house in Pontin Square. Now it was
complete. For good or evil he was against the Tiger. It was not how
he had planned things. He had decided the break should come at his
wish. Yet it had come through his action, if not by his wish. Now
he must choose. To remain a prisoner during the Tiger's pleasure or
to plan and scheme against his former master.</p>

<p>Hour after hour he paced the narrow room trying to plan his
conduct. He was a prisoner and could only plan. The opportunity to
act was denied him. Yet he must plan. He might get a chance to
escape later and he must be ready.</p>

<p>He was hungry. He had not eaten since the previous afternoon in
prison. Did the Tiger intend to starve him? No, he would not do
that. He was necessary to any plans the Tiger might make.</p>

<p>There were steps on the stairs. They were coming for him. It was
not his intention to exhibit any signs of the previous night's
frenzy. He crossed to the window and sat down with his back to the
door. The key was turned and a man entered.</p>

<p>"Well, Matt," said the man pleasantly. "Hungry?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Smeardon cheerfully. He looked past the man into
the passage. Another man was standing there. "Thought you had
forgotten me."</p>

<p>"The Tiger said I was to give you time to recover. You seem all
right now."</p>

<p>"Am I to be kept locked up here." demanded Smeardon.</p>

<p>"I've no orders to release you," replied the man. "Come in, Arch
and bring the tray with you."</p>

<p>The other man entered with a loaded tray. It was evident the
Tiger did not intend to starve him. The man placed the tray on the
table and left the room. The first man lingered.</p>

<p>"What's the game, Paul?" enquired Smeardon, drawing a chair to
the table and starting on the food without ceremony.</p>

<p>"All I know is that you're to be kept here until you're
required."</p>

<p>"And you're to be my jailer," laughed Smeardon. "Pleasant
job."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not the only prisoner by a long chalk. There's three
others."</p>

<p>"Three others," exclaimed Smeardon, in surprise. "Has the Tiger
turned this place into a private lunatic asylum again?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it," agreed the man. "There's that lawyer chap
overhead. The girls are down the corridor. You've got lots of
company round you although you can't see them."</p>

<p>"Who are the girls? The Pellet girl and--"</p>

<p>"Yes. The heiress they call her. And Polly."</p>

<p>"Polly!"</p>

<p>"Yes. She turned crusty last night and the Tiger gave orders she
was to be locked up with the other girl for the time. It's a job,
carting the eats around the place. Well, I must be getting along.
Have to pay a visit over your head. So long, Matt, take my lip and
make it up with the Tiger. I'll tell him you're reasonable
now."</p>

<p>With a friendly nod the man went out and shut the door. Smeardon
listened and heard them ascend the stairs. Then, the tread of feet
over head and the murmur of voices. Finishing the meal, Smeardon
lit a cigarette and started his walk up and down the room, planning
how this additional information might help him.</p>

<p>Merrivale was above him; could they get into communication?
Smeardon surveyed his own room. It was small, about ten feet
square, and plainly furnished. A bed table, a washstand and toilet
table combined and a couple of chairs were al that was in it. In
the corner, beside the fireplace, was a large cupboard. The ceiling
was low and he judged that, with a chair on the table it would be
within easy reach.</p>

<p>The ceiling was the only way of communicating with Merrivale,
yet he could not knock down the plaster without drawing the
attention of his jailer, when he next visited him. Then his eye
fell on the cupboard. He opened the door. It was a roomy place and
the pegs were empty. He drew a chair in and, mounting it, tried to
reach the ceiling. It was still some distance away. He carried the
table to the door of the cupboard and managed to fit one angle into
it. With the chair on that, he was able to reach the ceiling
easily. Then, with his penknife, he began to cut a large circle in
the plaster of the ceiling in the cupboard. It was slow work, for
he had continually to stop, to brush the mess into a corner of the
cupboard and to listen for footsteps, but he made good progress.
Presently he had cut through the lathes and reached the floor of
the room above.</p>

<p>It was now six o'clock. He drew his table back to its place and
removed every sign of his work. They would soon bring his evening
meal. He lay down on the bed and dozed for some time.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened and his meal was brought in by the
same man, who also lit the lamp. Smeardon asked for a book or a
newspaper to read and the man promised to bring it when he had
finished with his prisoners. About an hour later the man returned
and threw on the bed an old newspaper. Smeardon knew now the man
had completed his work and would not return again that night. He
went to the cupboard and, arranging his platform, knocked at the
floor above.</p>

<p>He could hear Merrivale halt in his pacing of the room. He
knocked again and then came a knock from above. Knocking at
intervals he guided Merrivale to where he was.</p>

<p>So far he had succeeded in getting into communication with
Merrivale. How was he to make him understand? He did not know the
Morse or any other code. Merrivale knocked again and he answered.
They could knock and knock but their knocking did not carry any
meaning. Presently Merrivale knocked three or four times rapidly,
then, slowly and distinctly, came twenty-six knocks. Twenty-six.
Why! Of course. Twenty-six letters in the alphabet. He knocked
twice quickly. Then Merrivale began to spell out words slowly.
"Who's there."</p>

<p>"Smeardon. Who's there?"</p>

<p>No answer came. Merrivale did not understand. Smeardon
continued.</p>

<p>"I'm a prisoner."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>"Can you open your window?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Open it. Lean out."</p>

<p>He heard Merrivale's steps across the floor. Then he went to his
own window and leaned out. Merrivale's head was just above.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me," whispered Smeardon, hurriedly. "Look in the
distance. Can you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you sheets and blankets?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can you make a rope and get down to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you climb back, if necessary?"</p>

<p>"Then make your rope and come down here. I have a plan of
escape."</p>

<p>Smeardon left the window and waited. In a short time something
soft hit his window. He caught hold of it. There came a strain on
the improvised rope and Merrivale slipped down and climbed into the
room.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" asked Claude.</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner," said Smeardon. "I quarrelled with the Tiger
and he locked me up."</p>

<p>"What do you want from me?"</p>

<p>"Help, me to escape."</p>

<p>"I've been here for days or months," Claude laughed bitterly.
"There has not been anything but escape to think of and I have not
found the way yet."</p>

<p>"I have," said Smeardon eagerly. "Will you join me?"</p>

<p>"Why not act on your own," said Claude suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Because I have hot the nerve to act by myself," said Smeardon.
"You are young and strong and can do things I cannot."</p>

<p>"Well, what is your plan?"</p>

<p>Smeardon was going to speak when Claude interrupted him.</p>

<p>"You fool. Look what you have done.</p>

<p>In his excitement, Smeardon had not replaced the table and
chair. Claude dragged them into the room and seated himself at the
table.</p>

<p>"Have you any tobacco?"</p>

<p>Smeardon gave him the package of cigarettes that had been on his
first tray. Claude lit one and drew in the smoke luxuriously.</p>

<p>"I've been longing for a smoke for days," he said, simply. "What
is your plan."</p>

<p>"It must be the window," explained Smeardon, quickly. "The house
is impracticable. Besides, there are always two men when they bring
the meals. We shall have to get your sheets and blankets somehow,
and they, joined with mine, should make a rope to reach to the
ground. Then--My God!"</p>

<p>The key was turning in the lock. The door opened and the Tiger
entered.</p>

<p>"Tiger!" exclaimed Smeardon.</p>

<p>"Well, Matt," said the Tiger easily, "You seem surprised, to see
me. You seem to forget, I'm in my own house."</p>

<p>Smeardon looked over his shoulder to where Claude had been
seated. The chair was empty.</p>
