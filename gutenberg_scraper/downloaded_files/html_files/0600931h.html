<h2><a id="colossus1" name="colossus1">CHAPTER 1</a> </h2>

<p class="first">ONLY the age-old silence brooded over the
mysterious ruins of Kuthchemes, but Fear was there; Fear quivered
in the mind of Shevatas, the thief, driving his breath quick and
sharp against his clenched teeth.</p>

<p>He stood, the one atom of life amidst the colossal monuments
of desolation and decay. Not even a vulture hung like a black dot
in the vast blue vault of the sky that the sun glazed with its
heat. On every hand rose the grim relics of another, forgotten
age: huge broken pillars, thrusting up their jagged pinnacles
into the sky; long wavering lines of crumbling walls; fallen
cyclopean blocks of stone; shattered images, whose horrific
features the corroding winds and dust-storms had half erased.
From horizon to horizon no sign of life: only the sheer
breathtaking sweep of the naked desert, bisected by the wandering
line of a long-dry river course; in the midst of that vastness
the glimmering fangs of the ruins, the columns standing up like
broken masts of sunken ships&mdash;all dominated by the towering
ivory dome before which Shevatas stood trembling.</p>

<p>The base of this dome was a gigantic pedestal of marble rising
from what had once been a terraced eminence on the banks of the
ancient river. Broad steps led up to a great bronze door in the
dome, which rested on its base like the half of some titanic egg.
The dome itself was of pure ivory, which shone as if unknown
hands kept it polished. Likewise shone the spired gold cap of the
pinnacle, and the inscription which sprawled about the curve of
the dome in golden hieroglyphics yards long. No man on earth
could read those characters, but Shevatas shuddered at the dim
conjectures they raised. For he came of a very old race, whose
myths ran back to shapes undreamed of by contemporary tribes.</p>

<p>Shevatas was wiry and lithe, as became a master-thief of
Zamora. His small round head was shaven, his only garment a loin-cloth of scarlet silk. Like all his race, he was very dark, his
narrow vulture-like face set off by his keen black eyes. His
long, slender and tapering fingers were quick and nervous as the
wings of a moth. From a gold-scaled girdle hung a short, narrow,
jewel-hilted sword in a sheath of ornamented leather. Shevatas
handled the weapon with apparently exaggerated care. He even
seemed to flinch away from the contact of the sheath with his
naked thigh. Nor was his care without reason.</p>

<p>This was Shevatas, a thief among thieves, whose name was
spoken with awe in the dives of the Maul and the dim shadowy
recesses beneath the temples of Bel, and who lived in songs and
myths for a thousand years. Yet fear ate at the heart of Shevatas
as he stood before the ivory dome of Kuthchemes. Any fool could
see there was something unnatural about the structure; the winds
and suns of three thousand years had lashed it, yet its gold and
ivory rose bright and glistening as the day it was reared by
nameless hands on the bank of the nameless river.</p>

<p>This unnaturalness was in keeping with the general aura of
these devil-haunted ruins. This desert was the mysterious expanse
lying southeast of the lands of Shem. A few days' ride on camel-back to the southwest, as Shevatas knew, would bring the
traveller within sight of the great river Styx at the point where
it turned at right angles with its former course, and flowed
westward to empty at last into the distant sea. At the point of
its bend began the land of Stygia, the dark-bosomed mistress of
the south, whose domains, watered by the great river, rose sheer
out of the surrounding desert.</p>

<p>Eastward, Shevatas knew, the desert shaded into steppes
stretching to the Hyrkanian kingdom of Turan, rising in barbaric
splendor on the shores of the great inland sea. A week's ride
northward the desert ran into a tangle of barren hills, beyond
which lay the fertile uplands of Koth, the southernmost realm of
the Hyborian races. Westward the desert merged into the
meadowlands of Shem, which stretched away to the ocean.</p>

<p>All this Shevatas knew without being particularly conscious of
the knowledge, as a man knows the streets of his town. He was a
far traveller and had looted the treasures of many kingdoms. But
now he hesitated and shuddered before the highest adventure and
the mightiest treasure of all.</p>

<p>In that ivory dome lay the bones of Thugra Khotan, the dark
sorcerer who had reigned in Kuthchemes three thousand years ago,
when the kingdoms of Stygia stretched far northward of the great
river, over the meadows of Shem, and into the uplands. Then the
great drift of the Hyborians swept southward from the cradle-land
of their race near the northern pole. It was a titanic drift,
extending over centuries and ages. But in the reign of Thugra
Khotan, the last magician of Kuthchemes, gray-eyed, tawny-haired
barbarians in wolfskins and scale-mail had ridden from the north
into the rich uplands to carve out the kingdom of Koth with their
iron swords. They had stormed over Kuthchemes like a tidal wave,
washing the marble towers in blood, and the northern Stygian
kingdom had gone down in fire and ruin.</p>

<p>But while they were shattering the streets of his city and
cutting down his archers like ripe corn, Thugra Khotan had
swallowed a strange terrible poison, and his masked priests had
locked him into the tomb he himself had prepared. His devotees
died about that tomb in a crimson holocaust, but the barbarians
could not burst the door, nor ever mar the structure by maul or
fire. So they rode away, leaving the great city in ruins, and in
his ivory-domed sepulcher great Thugra Khotan slept unmolested,
while the lizards of desolation gnawed at the crumbling pillars,
and the very river that watered his land in old times sank into
the sands and ran dry.</p>

<p>Many a thief sought to gain the treasure which fables said lay
heaped about the moldering bones inside the dome. And many a
thief died at the door of the tomb, and many another was harried
by monstrous dreams to die at last with the froth of madness on
his lips.</p>

<p>So Shevatas shuddered as he faced the tomb, nor was his
shudder altogether occasioned by the legend of the serpent said
to guard the sorcerer's bones. Over all myths of Thugra Khotan
hung horror and death like a pall. From where the thief stood he
could see the ruins of the great hall wherein chained captives
had knelt by the hundreds during festivals to have their heads
hacked off by the priest-king in honor of Set, the Serpent-god of
Stygia. Somewhere near by had been the pit, dark and awful,
wherein screaming victims were fed to a nameless amorphic
monstrosity which came up out of a deeper, more hellish cavern.
Legend made Thugra Khotan more than human; his worship yet
lingered in a mongrel degraded cult, whose votaries stamped his
likeness on coins to pay the way of their dead over the great
river of darkness of which the Styx was but the material shadow.
Shevatas had seen this likeness, on coins stolen from under the
tongues of the dead, and its image was etched indelibly in his
brain.</p>

<p>But he put aside his fears and mounted to the bronze door,
whose smooth surface offered no bolt or catch. Not for naught had
he gained access into darksome cults, had harkened to the grisly
whispers of the votaries of Skelos under midnight trees, and read
the forbidden iron-bound books of Vathelos the Blind.</p>

<p>Kneeling before the portal, he searched the sill with nimble
fingers; their sensitive tips found projections too small for the
eye to detect, or for less-skilled fingers to discover. These he
pressed carefully and according to a peculiar system, muttering a
long-forgotten incantation as he did so. As he pressed the last
projection, he sprang up with frantic haste and struck the exact
center of the door a quick sharp blow with his open hand.</p>

<p>There was no rasp of spring or hinge, but the door retreated
inward, and the breath hissed explosively from Shevatas's
clenched teeth. A short narrow corridor was disclosed. Down this
the door had slid, and was now in place at the other end. The
floor, ceiling and sides of the tunnel-like aperture were of
ivory, and now from an opening on one side came a silent writhing
horror that reared up and glared on the intruder with awful
luminous eyes; a serpent twenty feet long, with shimmering,
iridescent scales.</p>

<p>The thief did not waste time in conjecturing what night-black
pits lying below the dome had given sustenance to the monster.
Gingerly he drew the sword, and from it dripped a greenish liquid
exactly like that which slavered from the scimitar-fangs of the
reptile. The blade was steeped in the poison of the snake's own
kind, and the obtaining of that venom from the fiend-haunted
swamps of Zingara would have made a saga in itself.</p>

<p>Shevatas advanced warily on the balls of his feet, knees bent
slightly, ready to spring either way like a flash of light. And
he needed all his co-ordinate speed when the snake arched its
neck and struck, shooting out its full length like a stroke of
lightning. For all his quickness of nerve and eye, Shevatas had
died then but for chance. His well-laid plans of leaping aside
and striking down on the outstretched neck were put at naught by
the blinding speed of the reptile's attack. The thief had but
time to extend the sword in front of him, involuntarily closing
his eyes and crying out. Then the sword was wrenched from his
hand and the corridor was filled with a horrible thrashing and
lashing.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes, amazed to find himself still alive, Shevatas
saw the monster heaving and twisting its slimy form in fantastic
contortions, the sword transfixing its giant jaws. Sheer chance
had hurled it full against the point he had held out blindly. A
few moments later the serpent sank into shining, scarcely
quivering coils, as the poison on the blade struck home.</p>

<p>Gingerly stepping over it, the thief thrust against the door,
which this time slid aside, revealing the interior of the dome.
Shevatas cried out; instead of utter darkness he had come into a
crimson light that throbbed and pulsed almost beyond the
endurance of mortal eyes. It came from a gigantic red jewel high
up in the vaulted arch of the dome. Shevatas gaped, inured though
he was to the sight of riches. The treasure was there, heaped in
staggering profusion&mdash;piles of diamonds, sapphires, rubies,
turquoises, opals, emeralds; zikkurats of jade, jet and lapis
lazuli; pyramids of gold wedges; teocallis of silver ingots;
jewel-hilted swords in cloth-of-gold sheaths; golden helmets with
colored horsehair crests, or black and scarlet plumes; silver
scaled corselets; gem-crusted harness worn by warrior-kings three
thousand years in their tombs; goblets carven of single jewels;
skulls plated with gold, with moonstones for eyes; necklaces of
human teeth set with jewels. The ivory floor was covered inches
deep with gold dust that sparkled and shimmered under the crimson
glow with a million scintillant lights. The thief stood in a
wonderland of magic and splendor, treading stars under his
sandalled feet.</p>

<p>But his eyes were focussed on the dais of crystal which rose
in the midst of the shimmering array, directly under the red
jewel, and on which should be lying the moldering bones, turning
to dust with the crawling of the centuries. And as Shevatas
looked, the blood drained from his dark features; his marrow
turned to ice, and the skin of his back crawled and wrinkled with
horror, while his lips worked soundlessly. But suddenly he found
his voice in one awful scream that rang hideously under the
arching dome. Then again the silence of the ages lay among the
ruins of mysterious Kuthchemes.</p>

<h2><a id="colossus2" name="colossus2">CHAPTER 2</a> </h2>

<p class="first">RUMORS drifted up through the meadowlands, into
the cities of the Hyborians. The word ran along the caravans, the
long camel-trains plodding through the sands, herded by lean,
hawk-eyed men in white kaftans. It was passed on by the hook-nosed herdsmen of the grasslands, from the dwellers in tents to
the dwellers in the squat stone cities where kings with curled
blue-black beards worshipped round-bellied gods with curious
rites. The word passed up through the fringe of hills where gaunt
tribesmen took toll of the caravans. The rumors came into the
fertile uplands where stately cities rose above blue lakes and
rivers: the rumors marched along the broad white roads thronged
with ox-wains, with lowing herds, with rich merchants, knights in
steel, archers and priests.</p>

<p>They were rumors from the desert that lies east of Stygia, far
south of the Kothian hills. A new prophet had risen among the
nomads. Men spoke of tribal war, of a gathering of vultures in
the southeast, and a terrible leader who led his swiftly
increasing hordes to victory. The Stygians, ever a menace to the
northern nations, were apparently not connected with this
movement; for they were massing armies on their eastern borders
and their priests were making magic to fight that of the desert
sorcerer, whom men called Natohk, the Veiled One; for his
features were always masked.</p>

<p>But the tide swept northwestward, and the blue-bearded kings
died before the altars of their pot-bellied gods, and their
squat-walled cities were drenched in blood. Men said that the
uplands of the Hyborians were the goal of Natohk and his chanting
votaries.</p>

<p>Raids from the desert were not uncommon, but this latest
movement seemed to promise more than a raid. Rumor said Natohk
had welded thirty nomadic tribes and fifteen cities into his
following, and that a rebellious Stygian prince had joined him.
This latter lent the affair an aspect of real war.</p>

<p>Characteristically, most of the Hyborian nations were prone to
ignore the growing menace. But in Khoraja, carved out of Shemite
lands by the swords of Kothic adventurers, heed was given. Lying
southeast of Koth, it would bear the brunt of the invasion. And
its young king was captive to the treacherous king of Ophir, who
hesitated between restoring him for a huge ransom, or handing him
over to his enemy, the penurious king of Koth, who offered no
gold, but an advantageous treaty. Meanwhile, the rule of the
struggling kingdom was in the white hands of young princess
Yasmela, the king's sister.</p>

<p>Minstrels sang her beauty throughout the western world, and
the pride of a kingly dynasty was hers. But on that night her
pride was dropped from her like a cloak. In her chamber whose
ceiling was a lapis lazuli dome, whose marble floor was littered
with rare furs, and whose walls were lavish with golden
friezework, ten girls, daughters of nobles, their slender limbs
weighted with gem-crusted armlets and anklets, slumbered on
velvet couches about the royal bed with its golden dais and
silken canopy. But princess Yasmela lolled not on that silken
bed. She lay naked on her supple belly upon the bare marble like
the most abased suppliant, her dark hair streaming over her white
shoulders, her slender fingers intertwined. She lay and writhed
in pure horror that froze the blood in her lithe limbs and
dilated her beautiful eyes, that pricked the roots of her dark
hair and made goose-flesh rise along her supple spine.</p>

<p>Above her, in the darkest corner of the marble chamber, lurked
a vast shapeless shadow. It was no living thing of form or flesh
and blood. It was a clot of darkness, a blur in the sight, a
monstrous night-born incubus that might have been deemed a
figment of a sleep-drugged brain, but for the points of blazing
yellow fire that glimmered like two eyes from the blackness.</p>

<p>Moreover, a voice issued from it&mdash;a low subtle inhuman
sibilance that was more like the soft abominable hissing of a
serpent than anything else, and that apparently could not emanate
from anything with human lips. Its sound as well as its import
filled Yasmela with a shuddering horror so intolerable that she
writhed and twisted her slender body as if beneath a lash, as
though to rid her mind of its insinuating vileness by physical
contortion.</p>

<p>"You are marked for mine, princess," came the gloating
whisper. "Before I wakened from the long sleep I had marked you,
and yearned for you, but I was held fast by the ancient spell by
which I escaped mine enemies. I am the soul of Natohk, the Veiled
One! Look well upon me, princess! Soon you shall behold me in my
bodily guise, and shall love me!"</p>

<p>The ghostly hissing dwindled off in lustful titterings, and
Yasmela moaned and beat the marble tiles with her small fists in
her ecstasy of terror.</p>

<p>"I sleep in the palace chamber of Akbatana," the sibilances
continued. "There my body lies in its frame of bones and flesh.
But it is but an empty shell from which the spirit has flown for
a brief space. Could you gaze from that palace casement you would
realize the futility of resistance. The desert is a rose garden
beneath the moon, where blossom the fires of a hundred thousand
warriors. As an avalanche sweeps onward, gathering bulk and
momentum, I will sweep into the lands of mine ancient enemies.
Their kings shall furnish me skulls for goblets, their women and
children shall be slaves of my slaves' slaves. I have grown
strong in the long years of dreaming...</p>

<p>"But thou shalt be my queen, oh princess! I will teach thee
the ancient forgotten ways of pleasure. We&mdash;" Before the
stream of cosmic obscenity which poured from the shadowy
colossus, Yasmela cringed and writhed as if from a whip that
flayed her dainty bare flesh.</p>

<p>"Remember!" whispered the horror. "The days will not be many
before I come to claim mine own!"</p>

<p>Yasmela, pressing her face against the tiles and stopping her
pink ears with her dainty fingers, yet seemed to hear a strange
sweeping noise, like the beat of bat wings. Then, looking
fearfully up, she saw only the moon that shone through the window
with a beam that rested like a silver sword across the spot where
the phantom had lurked. Trembling in every limb, she rose and
staggered to a satin couch, where she threw herself down, weeping
hysterically. The girls slept on, but one, who roused, yawned,
stretched her slender figure and blinked about. Instantly she was
on her knees beside the couch, her arms about Yasmela's supple
waist.</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;was it&mdash;?" Her dark eyes were wide with
fright. Yasmela caught her in a convulsive grasp.</p>

<p>"Oh, Vateesa. It came again! I saw It&mdash;heard It speak! It
spoke Its name&mdash;Natohk! It is Natohk! It is not a
nightmare&mdash;it towered over me while the girls slept like
drugged ones. What oh, what shall I do?"</p>

<p>Vateesa twisted a golden bracelet about her rounded arm in
meditation.</p>

<p>"Oh, princess," she said, "it is evident that no mortal power
can deal with It, and the charm is useless that the priests of
Ishtar gave you. Therefore seek you the forgotten oracle of
Mitra."</p>

<p>In spite of her recent fright, Yasmela shuddered. The gods of
yesterday become the devils of tomorrow. The Kothians had long
since abandoned the worship of Mitra, forgetting the attributes
of the universal Hyborian god. Yasmela had a vague idea that,
being very ancient, it followed that the deity was very terrible.
Ishtar was much to be feared, and all the gods of Koth. Kothian
culture and religion had suffered from a subtle admixture of
Shemite and Stygian strains. The simple ways of the Hyborians had
become modified to a large extent by the sensual, luxurious, yet
despotic habits of the East.</p>

<p>"Will Mitra aid me?" Yasmela caught Vateesa's wrist in her
eagerness. "We have worshipped Ishtar so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure he will!" Vateesa was the daughter of an Ophirean
priest who had brought his customs with him when he fled from
political enemies to Khoraja. "Seek the shrine! I will go with
you."</p>

<p>"I will!" Yasmela rose, but objected when Vateesa prepared to
dress her. "It is not fitting that I come before the shrine clad
in silk. I will go naked, on my knees, as befits a suppliant,
lest Mitra deem I lack humility."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Vateesa had scant respect for the ways of what she
deemed a false cult. "Mitra would have folks stand upright before
him&mdash;not crawling on their bellies like worms, or spilling
blood of animals all over his altars."</p>

<p>Thus objurgated, Yasmela allowed the girl to garb her in the
light sleeveless silk shirt, over which was slipped a silken
tunic, bound at the waist by a wide velvet girdle. Satin slippers
were put upon her slender feet, and a few deft touches of
Vateesa's pink fingers arranged her dark wavy tresses. Then the
princess followed the girl, who drew aside a heavy gilt-worked
tapestry and threw the golden bolt of the door it concealed. This
let into a narrow winding corridor, and down this the two girls
went swiftly, through another door and into a broad hallway. Here
stood a guardsman in crested gilt helmet, silvered cuirass and
gold-chased greaves, with a long-shafted battle-ax in his
hands.</p>

<p>A motion from Yasmela checked his exclamation and, saluting,
he took his stand again beside the doorway, motionless as a
brazen image. The girls traversed the hallway, which seemed
immense and eery in the light of the cressets along the lofty
walls, and went down a stairway where Yasmela shivered at the
blots of shadows which hung in the angles of the walls. Three
levels down they halted at last in a narrow corridor whose arched
ceiling was crusted with jewels, whose floor was set with blocks
of crystal, and whose walls were decorated with golden
friezework. Down this shining way they stole, holding each
other's hands, to a wide portal of gilt.</p>

<p>Vateesa thrust open the door, revealing a shrine long
forgotten except by a faithful few, and royal visitors to
Khoraja's court, mainly for whose benefit the fane was
maintained. Yasmela had never entered it before, though she was
born in the palace. Plain and unadorned in comparison to the
lavish display of Ishtar's shrines, there was about it a
simplicity of dignity and beauty characteristic of the Mitran
religion.</p>

<p>The ceiling was lofty, but it was not domed, and was of plain
white marble, as were the walls and floor, the former with a
narrow gold frieze running about them. Behind an altar of clear
green jade, unstained with sacrifice, stood the pedestal whereon
sat the material manifestation of the deity. Yasmela looked in
awe at the sweep of the magnificent shoulders, the clear-cut
features&mdash;the wide straight eyes, the patriarchal beard, the
thick curls of the hair, confined by a simple band about the
temples. This, though she did not know it, was art in its highest
form&mdash;the free, uncramped artistic expression of a highly
esthetic race, unhampered by conventional symbolism.</p>

<p>She fell on her knees and thence prostrate, regardless of
Vateesa's admonition, and Vateesa, to be on the safe side,
followed her example; for after all, she was only a girl, and it
was very awesome in Mitra's shrine. But even so she could not
refrain from whispering in Yasmela's ear.</p>

<p>"This is but the emblem of the god. None pretends to know what
Mitra looks like. This but represents him in idealized human
form, as near perfection as the human mind can conceive. He does
not inhabit this cold stone, as your priests tell you Ishtar
does. He is everywhere&mdash;above us, and about us, and he
dreams betimes in the high places among the stars. But here his
being focusses. Therefore call upon him."</p>

<p>"What shall I say?" whispered Yasmela in stammering
terror.</p>

<p>"Before you can speak, Mitra knows the contents of your
mind&mdash;" began Vateesa. Then both girls started violently as
a voice began in the air above them. The deep, calm, bell-like
tones emanated no more from the image than from anywhere else in
the chamber. Again Yasmela trembled before a bodiless voice
speaking to her, but this time it was not from horror or
repulsion.</p>

<p>"Speak not, my daughter, for I know your need," came the
intonations like deep musical waves beating rhythmically along a
golden beach. "In one manner may you save your kingdom, and
saving it, save all the world from the fangs of the serpent which
has crawled up out of the darkness of the ages. Go forth upon the
streets alone, and place your kingdom in the hands of the first
man you meet there."</p>

<p>The unechoing tones ceased, and the girls stared at each
other. Then, rising, they stole forth, nor did they speak until
they stood once more in Yasmela's chamber. The princess stared
out of the gold-barred windows. The moon had set. It was long
past midnight. Sounds of revelry had died away in the gardens and
on the roofs of the city. Khoraja slumbered beneath the stars,
which seemed to be reflected in the cressets that twinkled among
the gardens and along the streets and on the flat roofs of houses
where folk slept.</p>

<p>"What will you do?" whispered Vateesa, all a-tremble.</p>

<p>"Give me my cloak," answered Yasmela, setting her teeth.</p>

<p>"But alone, in the streets, at this hour!" expostulated
Vateesa.</p>

<p>"Mitra has spoken," replied the princess. "It might have been
the voice of the god, or a trick of a priest. No matter. I will
go!"</p>

<p>Wrapping a voluminous silken cloak about her lithe figure and
donning a velvet cap from which depended a filmy veil, she passed
hurriedly through the corridors and approached a bronze door
where a dozen spearmen gaped at her as she passed through. This
was in a wing of the palace which let directly onto the street;
on all other sides it was surrounded by broad gardens, bordered
by a high wall. She emerged into the street, lighted by cressets
placed at regular intervals.</p>

<p>She hesitated; then, before her resolution could falter, she
closed the door behind her. A slight shudder shook her as she
glanced up and down the street, which lay silent and bare. This
daughter of aristocrats had never before ventured unattended
outside her ancestral palace. Then, steeling herself, she went
swiftly up the street. Her satin-slippered feet fell lightly on
the pave, but their soft sound brought her heart into her throat.
She imagined their fall echoing thunderously through the
cavernous city, rousing ragged rat-eyed figures in hidden lairs
among the sewers. Every shadow seemed to hide a lurking assassin,
every blank doorway to mask the slinking hounds of darkness.</p>

<p>Then she started violently. Ahead of her a figure appeared on
the eery street. She drew quickly into a clump of shadows, which
now seemed like a haven of refuge, her pulse pounding. The
approaching figure went not furtively, like a thief, or timidly,
like a fearful traveller. He strode down the nighted street as
one who has no need or desire to walk softly. An unconscious
swagger was in his stride, and his footfalls resounded on the
pave. As he passed near a cresset she saw him plainly&mdash;a
tall man, in the chain-mail hauberk of a mercenary. She braced
herself, then darted from the shadow, holding her cloak close
about her.</p>

<p>"Sa-ha!" his sword flashed half out of his sheath. It halted
when he saw it was only a woman that stood before him, but his
quick glance went over her head, seeking the shadows for possible
confederates.</p>

<p>He stood facing her, his hand on the long hilt that jutted
forward from beneath the scarlet cloak which flowed carelessly
from his mailed shoulders. The torchlight glinted dully on the
polished blue steel of his greaves and basinet. A more baleful
fire glittered bluely in his eyes. At first glance she saw he was
no Kothian; when he spoke she knew he was no Hyborian. He was
clad like a captain of the mercenaries, and in that desperate
command there were men of many lands, barbarians as well as
civilized foreigners. There was a wolfishness about this warrior
that marked the barbarian. The eyes of no civilized man, however
wild or criminal, ever blazed with such a fire. Wine scented his
breath, but he neither staggered nor stammered.</p>

<p>"Have they shut you into the street?" he asked in barbarous
Kothic, reaching for her. His fingers closed lightly about her
rounded wrist, but she felt that he could splinter its bones
without effort. "I've but come from the last wine-shop open.
Ishtar's curse on these white-livered reformers who close the
grog-houses! 'Let men sleep rather than guzzle,' they
say&mdash;aye, so they can work and fight better for their
masters! Soft-gutted eunuchs, I call them. When I served with the
mercenaries of Corinthia, we swilled and wenched all night and
fought all day; aye, blood ran down the channels of our swords.
But what of you, my girl? Take off that cursed mask&mdash;"</p>

<p>She avoided his clutch with a lithe twist of her body, trying
not to appear to repulse him. She realized her danger, alone with
a drunken barbarian. If she revealed her identity, he might laugh
at her, or take himself off. She was not sure he would not cut
her throat. Barbaric men did strange inexplicable things. She
fought a rising fear.</p>

<p>"Not here," she laughed. "Come with me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" His wild blood was up, but he was wary as a wolf.
"Are you taking me to some den of robbers?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I swear it!" She was hard put to avoid the hand which
was again fumbling at her veil.</p>

<p>"Devil bite you, hussy!" he growled disgustedly. "You're as
bad as a Hyrkanian woman, with your damnable veil. Here&mdash;let
me look at your figure, anyway."</p>

<p>Before she could prevent it, he wrenched the cloak from her,
and she heard his breath hiss between his teeth. He stood holding
the cloak, eyeing her as if the sight of her rich garments had
somewhat sobered him. She saw suspicion flicker sullenly in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" he muttered. "You're no street-waif
&mdash; unless your leman robbed the king's seraglio for your
clothes."</p>

<p>"Never mind." She dared to lay her white hand on his massive
iron-clad arm. "Come with me off the street."</p>

<p>He hesitated, then shrugged his mighty shoulders. She saw that
he half believed her to be some noble lady, who, weary of polite
lovers, was taking this means of amusing herself. He allowed her
to don the cloak again, and followed her. From the corner of her
eye she watched him as they went down the street together. His
mail could not conceal his hard lines of tigerish strength.
Everything about him was tigerish, elemental, untamed. He was
alien as the jungle to her in his difference from the debonair
courtiers to whom she was accustomed. She feared him, told
herself she loathed his raw brute strength and unashamed
barbarism, yet something breathless and perilous inside her
leaned toward him; the hidden primitive chord that lurks in every
woman's soul was sounded and responded. She had felt his hardened
hand on her arm, and something deep in her tingled to the memory
of that contact. Many men had knelt before Yasmela. Here was one
she felt had never knelt before any one. Her sensations were
those of one leading an unchained tiger; she was frightened, and
fascinated by her fright.</p>

<p>She halted at the palace door and thrust lightly against it.
Furtively watching her companion, she saw no suspicion in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Palace, eh?" he rumbled. "So you're a maid-in-waiting?"</p>

<p>She found herself wondering, with a strange jealousy, if any
of her maids had ever led this war-eagle into her palace. The
guards made no sign as she led him between them, but he eyed them
as a fierce dog might eye a strange pack. She led him through a
curtained doorway into an inner chamber, where he stood, naively
scanning the tapestries, until he saw a crystal jar of wine on an
ebony table. This he took up with a gratified sigh, tilting it
toward his lips. Vateesa ran from an inner room, crying
breathlessly, "Oh my princess&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Princess!"</p>

<p>The wine-jar crashed to the floor. With a motion too quick for
sight to follow, the mercenary snatched off Yasmela's veil,
glaring. He recoiled with a curse, his sword leaping into his
hand with a broad shimmer of blue steel. His eyes blazed like a
trapped tiger's. The air was supercharged with tension that was
like the pause before the bursting of a storm. Vateesa sank to
the floor, speechless with terror, but Yasmela faced the
infuriated barbarian without flinching. She realized her very
life hung in the balance: maddened with suspicion and unreasoning
panic, he was ready to deal death at the slightest provocation.
But she experienced a certain breathless exhilaration in the
crisis.</p>

<p>"Do not be afraid," she said. "I am Yasmela, but there is no
reason to fear me."</p>

<p>"Why did you lead me here?" he snarled, his blazing eyes
darting all about the chamber. "What manner of trap is this?"</p>

<p>"There is no trickery," she answered. "I brought you here
because you can aid me. I called on the gods&mdash;on
Mitra&mdash;and he bade me go into the streets and ask aid of the
first man I met."</p>

<p>This was something he could understand. The barbarians had
their oracles. He lowered his sword, though he did not sheathe
it.</p>

<p>"Well, if you're Yasmela, you need aid," he grunted. "Your
kingdom's in a devil of a mess. But how can I aid you? If you
want a throat cut, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down," she requested. "Vateesa, bring him wine."</p>

<p>He complied, taking care, she noticed, to sit with his back
against a solid wall, where he could watch the whole chamber. He
laid his naked sword across his mail-sheathed knees. She glanced
at it in fascination. Its dull blue glimmer seemed to reflect
tales of bloodshed and rapine; she doubted her ability to lift
it, yet she knew that the mercenary could wield it with one hand
as lightly as she could wield a riding-whip. She noted the
breadth and power of his hands; they were not the stubby
undeveloped paws of a troglodyte. With a guilty start she found
herself imagining those strong fingers locked in her dark
hair.</p>

<p>He seemed reassured when she deposited herself on a satin
divan opposite him. He lifted off his basinet and laid it on the
table, and drew back his coif, letting the mail folds fall upon
his massive shoulders. She saw more fully now his unlikeness to
the Hyborian races. In his dark, scarred face there was a
suggestion of moodiness; and without being marked by depravity,
or definitely evil, there was more than a suggestion of the
sinister about his features, set off by his smoldering blue eyes.
A low broad forehead was topped by a square-cut tousled mane as
black as a raven's wing.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Conan, a captain of the mercenary spearmen," he answered,
emptying the wine-cup at a gulp and holding it out for more. "I
was born in Cimmeria."</p>

<p>The name meant little to her. She only knew vaguely that it
was a wild grim hill-country which lay far to the north, beyond
the last outposts of the Hyborian nations, and was peopled by a
fierce moody race. She had never before seen one of them.</p>

<p>Resting her chin on her hands, she gazed at him with the deep
dark eyes that had enslaved many a heart.</p>

<p>"Conan of Cimmeria," she said, "you said I needed aid.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Well," he answered, "any man can see that. Here is the king
your brother in an Ophirean prison; here is Koth plotting to
enslave you; here is this sorcerer screaming hell-fire and
destruction down in Shem&mdash;and what's worse, here are your
soldiers deserting every day."</p>

<p>She did not at once reply; it was a new experience for a man
to speak so forthrightly to her, his words not couched in
courtier phrases.</p>

<p>"Why are my soldiers deserting, Conan?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Some are being hired away by Koth," he replied, pulling at
the wine-jar with relish. "Many think Khoraja is doomed as an
independent state. Many are frightened by tales of this dog
Natohk."</p>

<p>"Will the mercenaries stand?" she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"As long as you pay us well," he answered frankly. "Your
politics are nothing to us. You can trust Amalric, our general,
but the rest of us are only common men who love loot. If you pay
the ransom Ophir asks, men say you'll be unable to pay us. In
that case we might go over to the king of Koth, though that
cursed miser is no friend of mine. Or we might loot this city. In
a civil war the plunder is always plentiful."</p>

<p>"Why would you not go over to Natohk?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"What could he pay us?" he snorted. "With fat-bellied brass
idols he looted from the Shemite cities? As long as you're
fighting Natohk, you may trust us."</p>

<p>"Would your comrades follow you?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," she answered deliberately, "that I am going to make
you commander of the armies of Khoraja!"</p>

<p>He stopped short, the goblet at his lips, which curved in a
broad grin. His eyes blazed with a new light.</p>

<p>"Commander? Crom! But what will your perfumed nobles say?"</p>

<p>"They will obey me!" She clapped her hands to summon a slave,
who entered, bowing deeply. "Have Count Thespides come to me at
once, and the chancellor Taurus, lord Amalric, and the Agha
Shupras.</p>

<p>"I place my trust in Mitra," she said, bending her gaze on
Conan, who was now devouring the food placed before him by the
trembling Vateesa. "You have seen much war?"</p>

<p>"I was born in the midst of a battle," he answered, tearing a
chunk of meat from a huge joint with his strong teeth. "The first
sound my ears heard was the clang of swords and the yells of the
slaying. I have fought in blood-feuds, tribal wars, and imperial
campaigns."</p>

<p>"But can you lead men and arrange battle-lines?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can try," he returned imperturbably. "It's no more
than sword-play on a larger scale. You draw his guard, then stab,
slash! And either his head is off, or yours."</p>

<p>The slave entered again, announcing the arrival of the men
sent for, and Yasmela went into the outer chamber, drawing the
velvet curtains behind her. The nobles bent the knee, in evident
surprize at her summons at such an hour.</p>

<p>"I have summoned you to tell you of my decision," said
Yasmela. "The kingdom is in peril&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Right enough, my princess." It was Count Thespides who
spoke&mdash;a tall man, whose black locks were curled and
scented. With one white hand he smoothed his pointed mustache,
and with the other he held a velvet chaperon with a scarlet
feather fastened by a golden clasp. His pointed shoes were satin,
his cote-hardie of gold-broidered velvet. His manner was slightly
affected, but the thews under his silks were steely. "It were
well to offer Ophir more gold for your royal brother's
release."</p>

<p>"I strongly disagree," broke in Taurus the chancellor, an
elderly man in an ermine-fringed robe, whose features were lined
with the cares of his long service. "We have already offered what
will beggar the kingdom to pay. To offer more would further
excite Ophir's cupidity. My princess, I say as I have said
before: Ophir will not move until we have met this invading
horde. If we lose, he will give king Khossus to Koth; if we win,
he will doubtless restore his majesty to us on payment of the
ransom."</p>

<p>"And in the meantime," broke in Amalric, "the soldiers desert
daily, and the mercenaries are restless to know why we dally." He
was a Nemedian, a large man with a lion-like yellow mane. "We
must move swiftly, if at all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we march southward," she answered. "And there is the
man who shall lead you!"</p>

<p>Jerking aside the velvet curtains she dramatically indicated
the Cimmerian. It was perhaps not an entirely happy moment for
the disclosure. Conan was sprawled in his chair, his feet propped
on the ebony table, busily engaged in gnawing a beef-bone which
he gripped firmly in both hands. He glanced casually at the
astounded nobles, grinned faintly at Amalric, and went on
munching with undisguised relish.</p>

<p>"Mitra protect us!" exploded Amalric. "That's Conan the
northron, the most turbulent of all my rogues! I'd have hanged
him long ago, were he not the best swordsman that ever donned
hauberk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your highness is pleased to jest!" cried Thespides, his
aristocratic features darkening. "This man is a savage&mdash;a
fellow of no culture or breeding! It is an insult to ask
gentlemen to serve under him! I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Count Thespides," said Yasmela, "you have my glove under your
baldric. Please give it to me, and then go."</p>

<p>"Go?" he cried, starting. "Go where?"</p>

<p>"To Koth or to Hades!" she answered. "If you will not serve me
as I wish, you shall not serve me at all."</p>

<p>"You wrong me, princess," he answered, bowing low, deeply
hurt. "I would not forsake you. For your sake I will even put my
sword at the disposal of this savage."</p>

<p>"And you, my lord Amalric?"</p>

<p>Amalric swore beneath his breath, then grinned. True soldier
of fortune, no shift of fortune, however outrageous, surprized
him much.</p>

<p>"I'll serve under him. A short life and a merry one, say
I&mdash;and with Conan the Throat-slitter in command, life is
likely to be both merry and short. Mitra! If the dog ever
commanded more than a company of cut-throats before, I'll eat
him, harness and all!"</p>

<p>"And you, my Agha?" she turned to Shupras.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders resignedly. He was typical of the
race evolved along Koth's southern borders&mdash;tall and gaunt,
with features leaner and more hawk-like than his purer-blooded
desert kin.</p>

<p>"Ishtar gives, princess." The fatalism of his ancestors spoke
for him.</p>

<p>"Wait here," she commanded, and while Thespides fumed and
gnawed his velvet cap, Taurus muttered wearily under his breath,
and Amalric strode back and forth, tugging at his yellow beard
and grinning like a hungry lion, Yasmela disappeared again
through the curtains and clapped her hands for her slaves.</p>

<p>At her command they brought harness to replace Conan's chain-mail &mdash; gorget, sollerets, cuirass, pauldrons, jambes,
cuisses and sallet. When Yasmela again drew the curtains, a Conan
in burnished steel stood before his audience. Clad in the plate-armor, vizor lifted and dark face shadowed by the black plumes
that nodded above his helmet, there was a grim impressiveness
about him that even Thespides grudgingly noted. A jest died
suddenly on Amalric's lips.</p>

<p>"By Mitra," said he slowly, "I never expected to see you cased
in coat-armor, but you do not put it to shame. By my fingerbones,
Conan, I have seen kings who wore their harness less regally than
you!"</p>

<p>Conan was silent. A vague shadow crossed his mind like a
prophecy. In years to come he was to remember Amalric's words,
when the dream became the reality.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="colossus3" name="colossus3">CHAPTER 3</a> </h2>

<p class="first">IN THE EARLY haze of dawn the streets of Khoraja
were thronged by crowds of people who watched the hosts riding
from the southern gate. The army was on the move at last. There
were the knights, gleaming in richly wrought plate-armor, colored
plumes waving above their burnished sallets. Their steeds,
caparisoned with silk, lacquered leather and gold buckles,
caracoled and curvetted as their riders put them through their
paces. The early light struck glints from lancepoints that rose
like a forest above the array, their pennons flowing in the
breeze. Each knight wore a lady's token, a glove, scarf or rose,
bound to his helmet or fastened to his sword-belt. They were the
chivalry of Khoraja, five hundred strong, led by Count Thespides,
who, men said, aspired to the hand of Yasmela herself.</p>

<p>They were followed by the light cavalry on rangy steeds. The
riders were typical hillmen, lean and hawk-faced; peaked steel
caps were on their heads and chain-mail glinted under their
flowing kaftans. Their main weapon was the terrible Shemitish
bow, which could send a shaft five hundred paces. There were five
thousand of these, and Shupras rode at their head, his lean face
moody beneath his spired helmet.</p>

<p>Close on their heels marched the Khoraja spearmen, always
comparatively few in any Hyborian state, where men thought
cavalry the only honorable branch of service. These, like the
knights, were of ancient Kothic blood&mdash;sons of ruined
families, broken men, penniless youths, who could not afford
horses and plate-armor, five hundred of them.</p>

<p>The mercenaries brought up the rear, a thousand horsemen, two
thousand spearmen. The tall horses of the cavalry seemed hard and
savage as their riders; they made no curvets or gambades. There
was a grimly business-like aspect to these professional killers,
veterans of bloody campaigns. Clad from head to foot in chain-mail, they wore their vizorless head-pieces over linked coifs.
Their shields were unadorned, their long lances without guidons.
At their saddle-bows hung battle-axes or steel maces, and each
man wore at his hip a long broadsword. The spearmen were armed in
much the same manner, though they bore pikes instead of cavalry
lances.</p>

<p>They were men of many races and many crimes. There were tall
Hyperboreans, gaunt, big-boned, of slow speech and violent
natures; tawny-haired Gundermen from the hills of the northwest;
swaggering Corinthian renegades; swarthy Zingarians, with
bristling black mustaches and fiery tempers; Aquilonians from the
distant west. But all, except the Zingarians, were Hyborians.</p>

<p>Behind all came a camel in rich housings, led by a knight on a
great war-horse, and surrounded by a clump of picked fighters
from the royal house-troops. Its rider, under the silken canopy
of the seat, was a slim, silk-clad figure, at the sight of which
the populace, always mindful of royalty, threw up its leather
caps and cheered wildly.</p>

<p>Conan the Cimmerian, restless in his plate-armor, stared at
the bedecked camel with no great approval, and spoke to Amalric,
who rode beside him, resplendent in chain-mail threaded with
gold, golden breastplate and helmet with flowing horsehair
crest.</p>

<p>"The princess would go with us. She's supple, but too soft for
this work. Anyway, she'll have to get out of these robes."</p>

<p>Amalric twisted his yellow mustache to hide a grin. Evidently
Conan supposed Yasmela intended to strap on a sword and take part
in the actual fighting, as the barbarian women often fought.</p>

<p>"The women of the Hyborians do not fight like your Cimmerian
women, Conan," he said. "Yasmela rides with us to watch the
battle. Anyway," he shifted in his saddle and lowered his voice,
"between you and me, I have an idea that the princess dares not
remain behind. She fears something&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An uprising? Maybe we'd better hang a few citizens before we
start&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. One of her maids talked&mdash;babbled about Something
that came into the palace by night and frightened Yasmela half
out of her wits. It's some of Natohk's deviltry, I doubt not.
Conan, it's more than flesh and blood we fight!"</p>

<p>"Well," grunted the Cimmerian, "it's better to go meet an
enemy than to wait for him."</p>

<p>He glanced at the long line of wagons and camp-followers,
gathered the reins in his mailed hand, and spoke from habit the
phrase of the marching mercenaries, "Hell or plunder,
comrades&mdash;march!"</p>

<p>Behind the long train the ponderous gates of Khoraja closed.
Eager heads lined the battlements. The citizens well knew they
were watching life or death go forth. If the host was overthrown,
the future of Khoraja would be written in blood. In the hordes
swarming up from the savage south, mercy was a quality
unknown.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>All day the columns marched, through grassy rolling
meadowlands, cut by small rivers, the terrain gradually beginning
to slope upward. Ahead of them lay a range of low hills, sweeping
in an unbroken rampart from east to west. They camped that night
on the northern slopes of those hills, and hook-nosed, fiery-eyed
men of the hill tribes came in scores to squat about the fires
and repeat news that had come up out of the mysterious desert.
Through their tales ran the name of Natohk like a crawling
serpent. At his bidding the demons of the air brought thunder and
wind and fog, the fiends of the underworld shook the earth with
awful roaring. He brought fire out of the air and consumed the
gates of walled cities, and burnt armored men to bits of charred
bone. His warriors covered the desert with their numbers, and he
had five thousand Stygian troops in war-chariots under the rebel
prince Kutamun.</p>

<p>Conan listened unperturbed. War was his trade. Life was a
continual battle, or series of battles, since his birth. Death
had been a constant companion. It stalked horrifically at his
side; stood at his shoulder beside the gaming-tables; its bony
fingers rattled the wine-cups. It loomed above him, a hooded and
monstrous shadow, when he lay down to sleep. He minded its
presence no more than a king minds the presence of his cupbearer.
Some day its bony grasp would close; that was all. It was enough
that he lived through the present.</p>

<p>However, others were less careless of fear than he. Striding
back from the sentry lines, Conan halted as a slender cloaked
figure stayed him with an outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Princess! You should be in your tent."</p>

<p>"I could not sleep." Her dark eyes were haunted in the shadow.
"Conan, I am afraid!"</p>

<p>"Are there men in the host you fear?" His hand locked on his
hilt.</p>

<p>"No man," she shuddered. "Conan, is there anything you
fear?"</p>

<p>He considered, tugging at his chin. "Aye," he admitted at
last, "the curse of the gods."</p>

<p>Again she shuddered. "I am cursed. A fiend from the abysses
has set his mark upon me. Night after night he lurks in the
shadows, whispering awful secrets to me. He will drag me down to
be his queen in hell. I dare not sleep&mdash;he will come to me
in my pavilion as he came in the palace. Conan, you are strong;
keep me with you! I am afraid!"</p>

<p>She was no longer a princess, but only a terrified girl. Her
pride had fallen from her, leaving her unashamed in her
nakedness. In her frantic fear she had come to him who seemed
strongest. The ruthless power that had repelled her, drew her
now.</p>

<p>For answer he drew off his scarlet cloak and wrapped it about
her, roughly, as if tenderness of any kind were impossible to
him. His iron hand rested for an instant on her slender shoulder,
and she shivered again, but not with fear. Like an electric shock
a surge of animal vitality swept over her at his mere touch, as
if some of his superabundant strength had been imparted to
her.</p>

<p>"Lie here." He indicated a clean-swept space close to a small
flickering fire. He saw no incongruity in a princess lying down
on the naked ground beside a campfire, wrapped in a warrior's
cloak. But she obeyed without question.</p>

<p>He seated himself near her on a boulder, his broadsword across
his knees. With the firelight glinting from his blue steel armor,
he seemed like an image of steel&mdash;dynamic power for the
moment quiescent; not resting, but motionless for the instant,
awaiting the signal to plunge again into terrific action. The
firelight played on his features, making them seem as if carved
out of substance shadowy yet hard as steel. They were immobile,
but his eyes smoldered with fierce life. He was not merely a wild
man; he was part of the wild, one with the untameable elements of
life; in his veins ran the blood of the wolf-pack; in his brain
lurked the brooding depths of the northern night; his heart
throbbed with the fire of blazing forests.</p>

<p>So, half meditating, half dreaming, Yasmela dropped off to
sleep, wrapped in a sense of delicious security. Somehow she knew
that no flame-eyed shadow would bend over her in the darkness,
with this grim figure from the outlands standing guard above her.
Yet once again she wakened, to shudder in cosmic fear, though not
because of anything she saw.</p>

<p>It was a low mutter of voices that roused her. Opening her
eyes, she saw that the fire was burning low. A feeling of dawn
was in the air. She could dimly see that Conan still sat on the
boulder; she glimpsed the long blue glimmer of his blade. Close
beside him crouched another figure, on which the dying fire cast
a faint glow. Yasmela drowsily made out a hooked beak of a nose,
a glittering bead of an eye, under a white turban. The man was
speaking rapidly in a Shemite dialect she found hard to
understand.</p>

<p>"Let Bel wither my arm! I speak truth! By Derketo, Conan, I am
a prince of liars, but I do not lie to an old comrade. I swear by
the days when we were thieves together in the land of Zamora,
before you donned hauberk!</p>

<p>"I saw Natohk; with the others I knelt before him when he made
incantations to Set. But I did not thrust my nose in the sand as
the rest did. I am a thief of Shumir, and my sight is keener than
a weasel's. I squinted up and saw his veil blowing in the wind.
It blew aside, and I saw&mdash;I saw&mdash;Bel aid me, Conan, I
say I saw! My blood froze in my veins and my hair stood up. What
I had seen burned my soul like a red-hot iron. I could not rest
until I had made sure.</p>

<p>"I journeyed to the ruins of Kuthchemes. The door of the ivory
dome stood open; in the doorway lay a great serpent, transfixed
by a sword. Within the dome lay the body of a man, so shrivelled
and distorted I could scarce make it out at first&mdash;it was
Shevatas, the Zamorian, the only thief in the world I
acknowledged as my superior. The treasure was untouched; it lay
in shimmering heaps about the corpse. That was all."</p>

<p>"There were no bones&mdash;" began Conan.</p>

<p>"There was nothing!" broke in the Shemite passionately.
"Nothing! Only the one corpse!"</p>

<p>Silence reigned an instant, and Yasmela shrank with a crawling
nameless horror.</p>

<p>"Whence came Natohk?" rose the Shemite's vibrant whisper. "Out
of the desert on a night when the world was blind and wild with
mad clouds driven in frenzied flight across the shuddering stars,
and the howling of the wind was mingled with the shrieking of the
spirits of the wastes. Vampires were abroad that night, witches
rode naked on the wind, and werewolves howled across the
wilderness. On a black camel he came, riding like the wind, and
an unholy fire played about him; the cloven tracks of the camel
glowed in the darkness. When Natohk dismounted before Set's
shrine by the oasis of Aphaka, the beast swept into the night and
vanished. And I have talked with tribesmen who swore that it
suddenly spread gigantic wings and rushed upwards into the
clouds, leaving a trail of fire behind it. No man has seen that
camel since that night, but a black brutish manlike shape
shambles to Natohk's tent and gibbers to him in the blackness
before dawn. I will tell you, Conan, Natohk is&mdash;look, I will
show you an image of what I saw that day by Shushan when the wind
blew aside his veil!"</p>

<p>Yasmela saw the glint of gold in the Shemite's hand, as the
men bent closely over something. She heard Conan grunt; and
suddenly blackness rolled over her. For the first time in her
life, princess Yasmela had fainted.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="colossus4" name="colossus4">CHAPTER 4</a> </h2>

<p class="first">DAWN was still a hint of whiteness in the east
when the army was again on the march. Tribesmen had raced into
camp, their steeds reeling from the long ride, to report the
desert horde encamped at the Well of Altaku. So through the hills
the soldiers pushed hastily, leaving the wagon trains to follow.
Yasmela rode with them; her eyes were haunted. The nameless
horror had been taking even more awful shape, since she had
recognized the coin in the Shemite's hand the night
before&mdash;one of those secretly molded by the degraded Zugite
cult, bearing the features of a man dead three thousand
years.</p>

<p>The way wound between ragged cliffs and gaunt crags towering
over narrow valleys. Here and there villages perched, huddles of
stone huts, plastered with mud. The tribesmen swarmed out to join
their kin, so that before they had traversed the hills, the host
had been swelled by some three thousand wild archers.</p>

<p>Abruptly they came out of the hills and caught their breath at
the vast expanse that swept away to the south. On the southern
side the hills fell away sheerly, marking a distinct geographical
division between the Kothian uplands and the southern desert. The
hills were the rim of the uplands, stretching in an almost
unbroken wall. Here they were bare and desolate, inhabited only
by the Zaheemi clan, whose duty it was to guard the caravan road.
Beyond the hills the desert stretched bare, dusty, lifeless. Yet
beyond its horizon lay the Well of Altaku, and the horde of
Natohk.</p>

<p>The army looked down on the Pass of Shamla, through which
flowed the wealth of the north and the south, and through which
had marched the armies of Koth, Khoraja, Shem, Turan and Stygia.
Here the sheer wall of the rampart was broken. Promontories ran
out into the desert, forming barren valleys, all but one of which
were closed on the northern extremity by rugged cliffs. This one
was the Pass. It was much like a great hand extended from the
hills; two fingers, parted, formed a fan-shaped valley. The
fingers were represented by a broad ridge on either hand, the
outer sides sheer, the inner, steep slopes. The vale pitched
upward as it narrowed, to come out on a plateau, flanked by
gully-torn slopes. A well was there, and a cluster of stone
towers, occupied by the Zaheemis.</p>

<p>There Conan halted, swinging off his horse. He had discarded
the plate-armor for the more familiar chain-mail. Thespides
reined in and demanded, "Why do you halt?"</p>

<p>"We'll await them here," answered Conan.</p>

<p>"T'were more knightly to ride out and meet them," snapped the
count.</p>

<p>"They'd smother us with numbers," answered the Cimmerian.
"Besides, there's no water out there. We'll camp on the
plateau&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My knights and I camp in the valley," retorted Thespides
angrily. "We are the vanguard, and we, at least, do not fear a
ragged desert swarm."</p>

<p>Conan shrugged his shoulders and the angry nobleman rode away.
Amalric halted in his bellowing order, to watch the glittering
company riding down the slope into the valley.</p>

<p>"The fools! Their canteens will soon be empty, and they'll
have to ride back up to the well to water their horses."</p>

<p>"Let them be," replied Conan. "It goes hard for them to take
orders from me. Tell the dog-brothers to ease their harness and
rest. We've marched hard and fast. Water the horses and let the
men munch."</p>

<p>No need to send out scouts. The desert lay bare to the gaze,
though just now this view was limited by low-lying clouds which
rested in whitish masses on the southern horizon. The monotony
was broken only by a jutting tangle of stone ruins, some miles
out on the desert, reputedly the remnants of an ancient Stygian
temple. Conan dismounted the archers and ranged them along the
ridges, with the wild tribesmen. He stationed the mercenaries and
the Khoraji spearmen on the plateau about the well. Farther back,
in the angle where the hill road debouched on the plateau, was
pitched Yasmela's pavilion.</p>

<p>With no enemy in sight, the warriors relaxed. Basinets were
doffed, coifs thrown back on mailed shoulders, belts let out.
Rude jests flew back and forth as the fighting-men gnawed beef
and thrust their muzzles deep into ale-jugs. Along the slopes the
hillmen made themselves at ease, nibbling dates and olives.
Amalric strode up to where Conan sat bareheaded on a boulder.</p>

<p>"Conan, have you heard what the tribesmen say about Natohk?
They say&mdash;Mitra, it's too mad even to repeat. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"Seeds rest in the ground for centuries without rotting,
sometimes," answered Conan. "But surely Natohk is a man."</p>

<p>"I am not sure," grunted Amalric. "At any rate, you've
arranged your lines as well as a seasoned general could have
done. It's certain Natohk's devils can't fall on us unawares.
Mitra, what a fog!"</p>

<p>"I thought it was clouds at first," answered Conan. "See how
it rolls!"</p>

<p>What had seemed clouds was a thick mist moving northward like
a great unstable ocean, rapidly hiding the desert from view. Soon
it engulfed the Stygian ruins, and still it rolled onward. The
army watched in amazement. It was a thing
unprecedented&mdash;unnatural and inexplicable.</p>

<p>"No use sending out scouts," said Amalric disgustedly. "They
couldn't see anything. Its edges are near the outer flanges of
the ridges. Soon the whole Pass and these hills will be
masked&mdash;"</p>

<p>Conan, who had been watching the rolling mist with growing
nervousness, bent suddenly and laid his ear to the earth. He
sprang up with frantic haste, swearing.</p>

<p>"Horses and chariots, thousands of them! The ground vibrates
to their tread! Ho, there!" His voice thundered out across the
valley to electrify the lounging men. "Burganets and pikes, you
dogs! Stand to your ranks!"</p>

<p>At that, as the warriors scrambled into their lines, hastily
donning head-pieces and thrusting arms through shield-straps, the
mist rolled away, as something no longer useful. It did not
slowly lift and fade like a natural fog; it simply vanished, like
a blown-out flame. One moment the whole desert was hidden with
the rolling fleecy billows, piled mountainously, stratum above
stratum; the next, the sun shone from a cloudless sky on a naked
desert &mdash;no longer empty, but thronged with the living
pageantry of war. A great shout shook the hills.</p>

<p>At first glance the amazed watchers seemed to be looking down
upon a glittering sparkling sea of bronze and gold, where steel
points twinkled like a myriad stars. With the lifting of the fog
the invaders had halted as if frozen, in long serried lines,
flaming in the sun.</p>

<p>First was a long line of chariots, drawn by the great fierce
horses of Stygia, with plumes on their heads&mdash;snorting and
rearing as each naked driver leaned back, bracing his powerful
legs, his dusky arms knotted with muscles. The fighting-men in
the chariots were tall figures, their hawk-like faces set off by
bronze helmets crested with a crescent supporting a golden ball.
Heavy bows were in their hands. No common archers these, but
nobles of the South, bred to war and the hunt, who were
accustomed to bringing down lions with their arrows.</p>

<p>Behind these came a motley array of wild men on half-wild
horses &mdash; the warriors of Kush, the first of the great black
kingdoms of the grasslands south of Stygia. They were shining
ebony, supple and lithe, riding stark naked and without saddle or
bridle.</p>

<p>After these rolled a horde that seemed to encompass all the
desert. Thousands on thousands of the war-like Sons of Shem:
ranks of horsemen in scale-mail corselets and cylindrical
helmets&mdash;the asshuri of Nippr, Shumir and Eruk and their
sister cities; wild white-robed hordes&mdash;the nomad clans.</p>

<p>Now the ranks began to mill and eddy. The chariots drew off to
one side while the main host came uncertainly onward.</p>

<p>Down in the valley the knights had mounted, and now Count
Thespides galloped up the slope to where Conan stood. He did not
deign to dismount but spoke abruptly from the saddle.</p>

<p>"The lifting of the mist has confused them! Now is the time to
charge! The Kushites have no bows and they mask the whole
advance. A charge of my knights will crush them back into the
ranks of the Shemites, disrupting their formation. Follow me! We
will win this battle with one stroke!"</p>

<p>Conan shook his head. "Were we fighting a natural foe, I would
agree. But this confusion is more feigned than real, as if to
draw us into a charge. I fear a trap."</p>

<p>"Then you refuse to move?" cried Thespides, his face dark with
passion.</p>

<p>"Be reasonable," expostulated Conan. "We have the advantage of
position&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a furious oath Thespides wheeled and galloped back down
the valley where his knights waited impatiently.</p>

<p>Amalric shook his head. "You should not have let him return,
Conan. I&mdash;look there!"</p>

<p>Conan sprang up with a curse. Thespides had swept in beside
his men. They could hear his impassioned voice faintly, but his
gesture toward the approaching horde was significant enough. In
another instant five hundred lances dipped and the steel-clad
company was thundering down the valley.</p>

<p>A young page came running from Yasmela's pavilion, crying to
Conan in a shrill, eager voice. "My Lord, the princess asks why
you do not follow and support Count Thespides?"</p>

<p>"Because I am not so great a fool as he," grunted Conan,
reseating himself on the boulder and beginning to gnaw a huge
beef-bone.</p>

<p>"You grow sober with authority," quoth Amalric. "Such madness
as that was always your particular joy."</p>

<p>"Aye, when I had only my own life to consider," answered
Conan. "Now&mdash;what in hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horde had halted. From the extreme wing rushed a chariot,
the naked charioteer lashing the steeds like a madman; the other
occupant was a tall figure whose robe floated spectrally on the
wind. He held in his arms a great vessel of gold and from it
poured a thin stream that sparkled in the sunlight. Across the
whole front of the desert horde the chariot swept, and behind its
thundering wheels was left, like the wake behind a ship, a long
thin powdery line that glittered in the sands like the
phosphorescent track of a serpent.</p>

<p>"That's Natohk!" swore Amalric. "What hellish seed is he
sowing?"</p>

<p>The charging knights had not checked their headlong pace.
Another fifty paces and they would crash into the uneven Kushite
ranks, which stood motionless, spears lifted. Now the foremost
knights had reached the thin line that glittered across the
sands. They did not heed that crawling menace. But as the steel-shod hoofs of the horses struck it, it was as when steel strikes
flint&mdash;but with more terrible result. A terrific explosion
rocked the desert, which seemed to split apart along the strewn
line with an awful burst of white flame.</p>

<p>In that instant the whole foremost line of the knights was
seen enveloped in that flame, horses and steel-clad riders
withering in the glare like insects in an open blaze. The next
instant the rear ranks were piling up on their charred bodies.
Unable to check their headlong velocity, rank after rank crashed
into the ruins. With appalling suddenness the charge had turned
into a shambles where armored figures died amid screaming,
mangled horses.</p>

<p>Now the illusion of confusion vanished as the horde settled
into orderly lines. The wild Kushites rushed into the shambles,
spearing the wounded, bursting the helmets of the knights with
stones and iron hammers. It was all over so quickly that the
watchers on the slopes stood dazed; and again the horde moved
forward, splitting to avoid the charred waste of corpses. From
the hills went up a cry: "We fight not men but devils!"</p>

<p>On either ridge the hillmen wavered. One rushed toward the
plateau, froth dripping from his beard.</p>

<p>"Flee, flee!" he slobbered. "Who can fight Natohk's
magic?"</p>

<p>With a snarl Conan bounded from his boulder and smote him with
the beef-bone; he dropped, blood starting from nose and mouth.
Conan drew his sword, his eyes slits of blue bale-fire.</p>

<p>"Back to your posts!" he yelled. "Let another take a backward
step and I'll shear off his head! Fight, damn you!"</p>

<p>The rout halted as quickly as it had begun. Conan's fierce
personality was like a dash of ice-water in their whirling blaze
of terror.</p>

<p>"Take your places," he directed quickly. "And stand to it!
Neither man nor devil comes up Shamla Pass this day!"</p>

<p>Where the plateau rim broke to the valley slope the
mercenaries braced their belts and gripped their spears. Behind
them the lancers sat their steeds, and to one side were stationed
the Khoraja spearmen as reserves. To Yasmela, standing white and
speechless at the door of her tent, the host seemed a pitiful
handful in comparison to the thronging desert horde.</p>

<p>Conan stood among the spearmen. He knew the invaders would not
try to drive a chariot charge up the Pass in the teeth of the
archers, but he grunted with surprize to see the riders
dismounting. These wild men had no supply trains. Canteens and
pouches hung at their saddle-peaks. Now they drank the last of
their water and threw the canteens away.</p>

<p>"This is the death-grip," he muttered as the lines formed on
foot. "I'd rather have had a cavalry charge; wounded horses bolt
and ruin formations."</p>

<p>The horde had formed into a huge wedge, of which the tip was
the Stygians and the body, the mailed asshuri, flanked by the
nomads. In close formation, shields lifted, they rolled onward,
while behind them a tall figure in a motionless chariot lifted
wide-robed arms in grisly invocation.</p>

<p>As the horde entered the wide valley mouth the hillmen loosed
their shafts. In spite of the protective formation, men dropped
by dozens. The Stygians had discarded their bows; helmeted heads
bent to the blast, dark eyes glaring over the rims of their
shields, they came on in an inexorable surge, striding over their
fallen comrades. But the Shemites gave back the fire, and the
clouds of arrows darkened the skies. Conan gazed over the
billowing waves of spears and wondered what new horror the
sorcerer would invoke. Somehow he felt that Natohk, like all his
kind, was more terrible in defense than in attack; to take the
offensive against him invited disaster.</p>

<p>But surely it was magic that drove the horde on in the teeth
of death. Conan caught his breath at the havoc wrought in the
onsweeping ranks. The edges of the wedge seemed to be melting
away, and already the valley was strewn with dead men. Yet the
survivors came on like madmen unaware of death. By the very
numbers of their bows, they began to swamp the archers on the
cliffs. Clouds of shafts sped upward, driving the hillmen to
cover. Panic struck at their hearts at that unwavering advance,
and they plied their bows madly, eyes glaring like trapped
wolves.</p>

<p>As the horde neared the narrower neck of the Pass, boulders
thundered down, crushing men by the scores, but the charge did
not waver. Conan's wolves braced themselves for the inevitable
concussion. In their close formation and superior armor, they
took little hurt from the arrows. It was the impact of the charge
Conan feared, when the huge wedge should crash against his thin
ranks. And he realized now there was no breaking of that
onslaught. He gripped the shoulder of a Zaheemi who stood
near.</p>

<p>"Is there any way by which mounted men can get down into the
blind valley beyond that western ridge?"</p>

<p>"Aye, a steep, perilous path, secret and eternally guarded.
But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Conan was dragging him along to where Amalric sat his great
war-horse.</p>

<p>"Amalric!" he snapped. "Follow this man! He'll lead you into
yon outer valley. Ride down it, circle the end of the ridge, and
strike the horde from the rear. Speak not, but go! I know it's
madness, but we're doomed anyway; we'll do all the damage we can
before we die! Haste!"</p>

<p>Amalric's mustache bristled in a fierce grin, and a few
moments later his lancers were following the guide into a tangle
of gorges leading off from the plateau. Conan ran back to the
pikemen, sword in hand.</p>

<p>He was not too soon. On either ridge Shupras's hillmen, mad
with anticipation of defeat, rained down their shafts
desperately. Men died like flies in the valley and along the
slopes&mdash;and with a roar and an irresistible upward surge the
Stygians crashed against the mercenaries.</p>

<p>In a hurricane of thundering steel, the lines twisted and
swayed. It was war-bred noble against professional soldier.</p>

<p>Shields crashed against shields, and between them spears drove
in and blood spurted.</p>

<p>Conan saw the mighty form of prince Kutamun across the sea of
swords, but the press held him hard, breast to breast with dark
shapes that gasped and slashed. Behind the Stygians the asshuri
were surging and yelling.</p>

<p>On either hand the nomads climbed the cliffs and came to hand-grips with their mountain kin. All along the crests of the ridges
the combat raged in blind, gasping ferocity. Tooth and nail,
frothing mad with fanaticism and ancient feuds, the tribesmen
rent and slew and died. Wild hair flying, the naked Kushites ran
howling into the fray.</p>

<p>It seemed to Conan that his sweat-blinded eyes looked down
into a rising ocean of steel that seethed and eddied, filling the
valley from ridge to ridge. The fight was at a bloody deadlock.
The hillmen held the ridges, and the mercenaries, gripping their
dipping pikes, bracing their feet in the bloody earth, held the
Pass. Superior position and armor for a space balanced the
advantage of overwhelming numbers. But it could not endure. Wave
after wave of glaring faces and flashing spears surged up the
slope, the asshuri filling the gaps in the Stygian ranks.</p>

<p>Conan looked to see Amalric's lancers rounding the western
ridge, but they did not come, and the pikemen began to reel back
under the shocks. And Conan abandoned all hope of victory and of
life. Yelling a command to his gasping captains, he broke away
and raced across the plateau to the Khoraja reserves who stood
trembling with eagerness. He did not glance toward Yasmela's
pavilion. He had forgotten the princess; his one thought was the
wild beast instinct to slay before he died.</p>

<p>"This day you become knights!" he laughed fiercely, pointing
with his dripping sword toward the hillmen's horses, herded
nearby. "Mount and follow me to hell!"</p>

<p>The hill steeds reared wildly under the unfamiliar clash of
the Kothic armor, and Conan's gusty laugh rose above the din as
he led them to where the eastern ridge branched away from the
plateau. Five hundred footmen &mdash; pauper patricians, younger
sons, black sheep&mdash;on half-wild Shemite horses, charging an
army, down a slope where no cavalry had ever dared charge
before!</p>

<p>Past the battle-choked mouth of the Pass they thundered, out
onto the corpse-littered ridge. Down the steep slope they rushed,
and a score lost their footing and rolled under the hoofs of
their comrades. Below them men screamed and threw up their
arms&mdash;and the thundering charge ripped through them as an
avalanche cuts through a forest of saplings. On through the
close-packed throngs the Khorajis hurtled, leaving a crushed-down
carpet of dead.</p>

<p>And then, as the horde writhed and coiled upon itself,
Amalric's lancers, having cut through a cordon of horsemen
encountered in the outer valley, swept around the extremity of
the western ridge and smote the host in a steel-tipped wedge,
splitting it asunder. His attack carried all the dazing
demoralization of a surprize on the rear. Thinking themselves
flanked by a superior force and frenzied at the fear of being cut
off from the desert, swarms of nomads broke and stampeded,
working havoc in the ranks of their more steadfast comrades.
These staggered and the horsemen rode through them. Up on the
ridges the desert fighters wavered, and the hillmen fell on them
with renewed fury, driving them down the slopes.</p>

<p>Stunned by surprize, the horde broke before they had time to
see it was but a handful which assailed them. And once broken,
not even a magician could weld such a horde again. Across the sea
of heads and spears Conan's madmen saw Amalric's riders forging
steadily through the rout, to the rise and fall of axes and
maces, and a mad joy of victory exalted each man's heart and made
his arm steel.</p>

<p>Bracing their feet in the wallowing sea of blood whose crimson
waves lapped about their ankles, the pikemen in the Pass mouth
drove forward, crushing strongly against the milling ranks before
them. The Stygians held, but behind them the press of the asshuri
melted; and over the bodies of the nobles of the South who died
in their tracks to a man, the mercenaries rolled, to split and
crumple the wavering mass behind.</p>

<p>Up on the cliffs old Shupras lay with an arrow through his
heart; Amalric was down, swearing like a pirate, a spear through
his mailed thigh. Of Conan's mounted infantry, scarce a hundred
and fifty remained in the saddle. But the horde was shattered.
Nomads and mailed spearmen broke away, fleeing to their camp
where their horses were, and the hillmen swarmed down the slopes,
stabbing the fugitives in the back, cutting the throats of the
wounded.</p>

<p>In the swirling red chaos a terrible apparition suddenly
appeared before Conan's rearing steed. It was prince Kutamun,
naked but for a loin-cloth, his harness hacked away, his crested
helmet dented, his limbs splashed with blood. With a terrible
shout he hurled his broken hilt full into Conan's face, and
leaping, seized the stallion's bridle. The Cimmerian reeled in
his saddle, half stunned, and with awful strength the dark-skinned giant forced the screaming steed upward and backward,
until it lost its footing and crashed into the muck of bloody
sand and writhing bodies.</p>

<p>Conan sprang clear as the horse fell, and with a roar Kutamun
was on him. In that mad nightmare of battle, the barbarian never
exactly knew how he killed his man. He only knew that a stone in
the Stygian's hand crashed again and again on his basinet,
filling his sight with flashing sparks, as Conan drove his dagger
again and again into his foe's body, without apparent effect on
the prince's terrible vitality. The world was swimming to Conan's
sight, when with a convulsive shudder the frame that strained
against his stiffened and then went limp.</p>

<p>Reeling up, blood streaming down his face from under his
dented helmet, Conan glared dizzily at the profusion of
destruction which spread before him. From crest to crest the dead
lay strewn, a red carpet that choked the valley. It was like a
red sea, with each wave a straggling line of corpses. They choked
the neck of the Pass, they littered the slopes. And down in the
desert the slaughter continued, where the survivors of the horde
had reached their horses and streamed out across the waste,
pursued by the weary victors&mdash;and Conan stood appalled as he
noted how few of these were left to pursue.</p>

<p>Then an awful scream rent the clamor. Up the valley a chariot
came flying, making nothing of the heaped corpses. No horses drew
it, but a great black creature that was like a camel. In the
chariot stood Natohk, his robes flying; and gripping the reins
and lashing like mad, crouched a black anthropomorphic being that
might have been a monster ape.</p>

<p>With a rush of burning wind the chariot swept up the corpse-littered slope, straight toward the pavilion where Yasmela stood
alone, deserted by her guards in the frenzy of pursuit. Conan,
standing frozen, heard her frenzied scream as Natohk's long arm
swept her up into the chariot. Then the grisly steed wheeled and
came racing back down the valley, and no man dared speed arrow or
spear lest he strike Yasmela, who writhed in Natohk's arms.</p>

<p>With an inhuman cry Conan caught up his fallen sword and
leaped into the path of the hurtling horror. But even as his
sword went up, the forefeet of the black beast smote him like a
thunderbolt and sent him hurtling a score feet away, dazed and
bruised. Yasmela's cry came hauntingly to his stunned ears as the
chariot roared by.</p>

<p>A yell that had nothing of the human in its timbre rang from
his lips as Conan rebounded from the bloody earth and seized the
rein of a riderless horse that raced past him, throwing himself
into the saddle without bringing the charger to a halt. With mad
abandon he raced after the rapidly receding chariot. He struck
the levels flying, and passed like a whirlwind through the
Shemite camp. Into the desert he fled, passing clumps of his own
riders, and hard-spurring desert horsemen.</p>

<p>On flew the chariot, and on raced Conan, though his horse
began to reel beneath him. Now the open desert lay all about
them, bathed in the lurid desolate splendor of sunset. Before him
rose up the ancient ruins, and with a shriek that froze the blood
in Conan's veins, the unhuman charioteer cast Natohk and the girl
from him. They rolled on the sand, and to Conan's dazed gaze, the
chariot and its steed altered awfully. Great wings spread from a
black horror that in no way resembled a camel, and it rushed
upward into the sky, bearing in its wake a shape of blinding
flame, in which a black man-like shape gibbered in ghastly
triumph. So quickly it passed, that it was like the rush of a
nightmare through a horror-haunted dream.</p>

<p>Natohk sprang up, cast a swift look at his grim pursuer, who
had not halted but came riding hard, with sword swinging low and
spattering red drops; and the sorcerer caught up the fainting
girl and ran with her into the ruins.</p>

<p>Conan leaped from his horse and plunged after them. He came
into a room that glowed with unholy radiance, though outside the
dusk was falling swiftly. On a black jade altar lay Yasmela, her
naked body gleaming like ivory in the weird light. Her garments
lay strewn on the floor, as if ripped from her in brutal haste.
Natohk faced the Cimmerian&mdash;inhumanly tall and lean, clad in
shimmering green silk. He tossed back his veil, and Conan looked
into the features he had seen depicted on the Zugite coin.</p>

<p>"Aye, blench, dog!" The voice was like the hiss of a giant
serpent. "I am Thugra Khotan! Long I lay in my tomb, awaiting the
day of awakening and release. The arts which saved me from the
barbarians long ago likewise imprisoned me, but I knew one would
come in time&mdash;and he came, to fulfill his destiny, and to
die as no man has died in three thousand years!</p>

<p>"Fool, do you think you have conquered because my people are
scattered? Because I have been betrayed and deserted by the demon
I enslaved? I am Thugra Khotan, who shall rule the world despite
your paltry gods! The desert is filled with my people; the demons
of the earth shall do my bidding, as the reptiles of the earth
obey me. Lust for a woman weakened my sorcery. Now the woman is
mine, and feasting on her soul, I shall be unconquerable! Back,
fool! You have not conquered Thugra Khotan!"</p>

<p>He cast his staff and it fell at the feet of Conan, who
recoiled with an involuntary cry. For as it fell it altered
horribly; its outline melted and writhed, and a hooded cobra
reared up hissing before the horrified Cimmerian. With a furious
oath Conan struck, and his sword sheared the horrid shape in
half. And there at his feet lay only the two pieces of a severed
ebon staff. Thugra Khotan laughed awfully, and wheeling, caught
up something that crawled loathsomely in the dust of the
floor.</p>

<p>In his extended hand something alive writhed and slavered. No
tricks of shadows this time. In his naked hand Thugra Khotan
gripped a black scorpion, more than a foot in length, the
deadliest creature of the desert, the stroke of whose spiked tail
was instant death. Thugra Khotan's skull-like countenance split
in a mummy-like grin. Conan hesitated; then without warning he
threw his sword.</p>

<p>Caught off guard, Thugra Khotan had no time to avoid the cast.
The point struck beneath his heart and stood out a foot behind
his shoulders. He went down, crushing the poisonous monster in
his grasp as he fell.</p>

<p>Conan strode to the altar, lifting Yasmela in his blood-stained arms. She threw her white arms convulsively about his
mailed neck, sobbing hysterically, and would not let him go.</p>

<p>"Crom's devils, girl!" he grunted. "Loose me! Fifty thousand
men have perished today, and there is work for me to
do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" she gasped, clinging with convulsive strength, as
barbaric for the instant as he in her fear and passion. "I will
not let you go! I am yours, by fire and steel and blood! You are
mine! Back there, I belong to others&mdash;here I am
mine&mdash;and yours! You shall not go!"</p>

<p>He hesitated, his own brain reeling with the fierce upsurging
of his violent passions. The lurid unearthly glow still hovered
in the shadowy chamber, lighting ghostlily the dead face of
Thugra Khotan, which seemed to grin mirthlessly and cavernously
at them. Out on the desert, in the hills among the oceans of
dead, men were dying, were howling with wounds and thirst and
madness, and kingdoms were staggering. Then all was swept away by
the crimson tide that rose madly in Conan's soul, as he crushed
fiercely in his iron arms the slim white body that shimmered like
a witch-fire of madness before him.</p>
