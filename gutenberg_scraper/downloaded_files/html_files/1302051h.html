  <h2><a id="mem"
     name="mem">MEMOIR</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WILLIAM HARRISON AINSWORTH was born in King Street,
  Manchester, February 4, 1805, in a house that has long since been demolished.
  His father was a solicitor in good practice, and the son had all the
  advantages that educational facilities could afford. He was sent to the
  Manchester grammar-school, and in one of his early novels has left an
  interesting and accurate picture of its then condition, which may be
  contrasted with that of an earlier period left by the "English opium-eater."
  At sixteen, a brilliant, handsome youth, with more taste for romance and the
  drama than for the dry details of the law, he was articled to a leading
  solicitor of Manchester. The closest friend of his youth was a Mr. James
  Crossley, who was some years older, but shared his intellectual taste and
  literary enthusiasm. A drama written for private theatricals, in his father's
  house was printed in <i>Arliss's Magazine</i>, and he also contributed to the
  <i>Manchester Iris</i>, the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, and the <i>London
  Magazine</i>. He even started a periodical, which received the name of <i>The
  Boeotian</i>, and died at the sixth number. Many of the fugitive pieces of
  these early days were collected in volumes now exceedingly rare: "December
  Tales" (London, 1823), which is not wholly from his pen; the "Works of
  Cheviot Tichburn" (London, 1822; Manchester, 1825), dedicated to Charles
  Lamb; and "A Summer Evening Tale" (London, 1825).</p>

  <p>"Sir John Chiverton" appeared in 1826, and for forty years was regarded as
  one of his early works; but Mr. John Partington Aston has also claimed to be
  its author. In all probability, both of these young men joined in the
  production of the novel which attracted the attention of Sir Walter Scott. On
  the death of his father, in 1824, Ainsworth went to London to finish his
  legal education, but whatever intentions he may have formed of humdrum study
  and determined attention to the details of a profession in which he had no
  interest, were dissipated by contact with the literary world of the
  metropolis. He made the acquaintance of Mr. John Ebers, who at that time
  combined the duties of manager of the Opera House with the business of a
  publisher. He it was who issued "Sir John Chiverton," and the verses forming
  its dedication are understood to have been addressed to Anne Frances
  ("Fanny") Ebers, whom Ainsworth married October 11, 1826. Ainsworth had then
  to decide upon a career, and, acting upon the suggestion of Ebers, his
  father-in-law, he began business as a publisher; but after an experience of
  about eighteen months he abandoned it. In this brief interval he introduced
  the Hon. Mrs. Norton, and Ude, the cook, to the discerning though unequal
  admiration of the British public. He was introduced to Sir Walter Scott, who
  wrote the "Bonnets of Bonnie Dundee" for an annual issued by him. Ainsworth
  gave him twenty guineas for it, which Sir Walter accepted, but laughingly
  handed over to the little daughter of Lockhart, in whose London house they
  had met. Ainsworth's literary aspirations still burned with undiminished
  ardor, and several plans were formed only to be abandoned, and when, in the
  summer of 1830, he visited Switzerland and Italy, he was as far as ever from
  the fulfilment of his desires. In 1831 he visited Chesterfield and began the
  novel of "Rookwood," in which he successfully applied the method of Mrs.
  Radcliffe to English scenes and characters. The finest passage is that
  relating Turpin's ride to York, which is a marvel of descriptive writing. It
  was written, apparently in a glow of inspiration, in less than a day and a
  half. "The feat," he says, "for feat it was, being the composition of a
  hundred novel pages in less than twenty-four hours, was achieved at 'The
  Elms,' a house I then occupied at Kilburn." The success of "Rookwood" was
  marked and immediate. Ainsworth at a bound reached popularity. This was in
  1834, and in 1837 he published "Crichton," which is a fine piece of
  historical romance. The critics who had objected to the romantic glamor cast
  over the career of Dick Turpin were still further horrified at the manner in
  which that vulgar rascal, Jack Sheppard, was elevated into a hero of romance.
  The outcry was not entirely without justification, nor was it without effect
  on the novelist, who thenceforward avoided this perilous ground. "Jack
  Sheppard" appeared in <i>Bentley's Miscellany</i>, of which Ainsworth became
  editor in March, 1840, at a monthly salary of £51. The story is powerfully
  written. In 1841 he received £1000 from the <i>Sunday Times</i> for "Old St.
  Paul's," and he, in 1848, had from the same source another £1000 for the
  "Lancashire Witches." In 1841 he began the publication of <i>Ainsworth's
  Magazine</i>, which came to an end in 1853, when he acquired the <i>New
  Monthly Magazine</i>, which he edited for many years. This was the heyday of
  Ainsworth's reputation alike in literature and in society. His home at Kensal
  Manor House became famous for its hospitality, and Dickens, Thackeray,
  Landseer, Clarkson Stanfield, Talfourd, Jerrold, and Cruikshank were among
  his guests. The list of his principal historical novels, with their dates of
  issue, may now be given: "Rookwood," 1834; "Crichton," 1837; "Jack Sheppard,"
  1839; "Tower of London," 1840; "Guy Fawkes," 1841; "Old St. Paul's, a Tale of
  the Plague and the Fire of London," 1841; "Windsor Castle," 1843; "St. James,
  or the Court of Queene Anne," 1844; "Star Chamber," 1854; "Constable of the
  Tower," 1861; "The Lord Mayor of London," 1862; "Cardinal Pole," 1863; "John
  Law, the Projector," 1864; "The Constable de Bourbon," 1866; "Talbot
  Harland," 1870; "Boscobel," 1872; "The Manchester Rebels, or the Fatal '45,"
  1873; and "The Goldsmith's Wife," 1874. These novels all met with a certain
  amount of success, but those of later years did not attain the striking
  popularity of his earlier efforts. Many have been translated into various
  modern languages, and the editions of his various works are so numerous that
  some twenty-three pages of the British Museum catalogue are devoted to his
  works. The scenery and history of his native country had a perennial interest
  for him, and a certain group of his novels&mdash;that is, the "Lancashire
  Witches," "Guy Fawkes," "The Manchester Rebels," etc.&mdash;may almost be
  said to form a novelist's history of Lancashire from the pilgrimage of grace
  until the early part of the present century.</p>

  <p>Probably no more vivid account has been written of the great fire and
  plague of London than that given in "Old St. Paul's." The charm of
  Ainsworth's novels is not at all dependent upon the analysis of motives or
  subtle description of character. Of this he has little or nothing, but he
  realizes vividly a scene or an incident, and conveys the impression with
  great force and directness to the reader's mind. Ainsworth came upon the
  reading world at a happy moment. People were weary of the inanities of the
  fashionable novel, and were ready to listen to one who had a power of
  vivacious narrative. In 1881, when he was in his seventy-seventh year, a
  pleasant tribute of respect and admiration was paid to him in his native
  town. The Mayor of Manchester entertained him at a banquet in the town hall
  September 15, 1881, "as an expression of the high esteem in which he is held
  by his fellow-townsmen and of his services to literature." In proposing Mr.
  Ainsworth's health, the mayor gave a curious instance of the popularity of
  his writings. "In our Manchester public free libraries there are two hundred
  and fifty volumes of Mr. Ainsworth's different works. During the last twelve
  months these volumes have been read seven thousand six hundred and sixty
  times, mostly by the artisan class of readers. And this means that twenty
  volumes of his works are being perused in Manchester by readers of the free
  libraries every day all the year through." It was well that this pleasant
  recognition was not longer delayed. The contrast was pathetically great
  between the tall, handsome, dandified figure presented in the portraits of
  him by Pickersgill and Maclise, and the bent and feeble old man who stood by
  and acknowledged the plaudits of those who had assembled to honor him. His
  last published work was "Stanley Brereton," which he dedicated to his
  hospitable entertainer. He died at Reigate January 3, 1882, leaving a widow
  and also three daughters by his first marriage. He was buried at Kensal Green
  Cemetery. With the exception of George Gleig, he was the last survivor of the
  brilliant group who wrote for the early numbers of <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>,
  and, though he died in harness, had outlived nearly all the associates of the
  days when he first achieved fame.</p>

  <h2><a id="ded"
     name="ded">TO MY MOTHER</a></h2>

  <p class="first">When I inscribed this Romance to you, my dear Mother, on its
  first appearance, I was satisfied that, whatever reception it might meet with
  elsewhere, at your hands it would be sure of indulgence. Since then, the
  approbation your partiality would scarcely have withheld has been liberally
  accorded by the public; and I have the satisfaction of reflecting, that in
  following the dictates of affection, which prompted me to select the dearest
  friend I had in the world as the subject of a dedication, I have not
  overstepped the limits of prudence; nor, in connecting your honored name with
  this trifling production, involved you in a failure which, had it occurred,
  would have given you infinitely more concern than myself. After a lapse of
  three years, during which my little bark, fanned by pleasant and prosperous
  breezes, has sailed, more than once, securely into port, I again commit it to
  the waters, with more confidence than heretofore, and with a firmer reliance
  that, if it should be found "after many days," it may prove a slight memorial
  of the warmest filial regard.</p>

  <p>Exposed to trials of no ordinary difficulty, and visited by domestic
  affliction of no common severity, you, my dear Mother, have borne up against
  the ills of life with a fortitude and resignation which those who know you
  best can best appreciate, but which none can so well understand, or so
  thoroughly appreciate, as myself. Suffering is the lot of all. Submission
  under the dispensation is permitted to few. And it is my fervent hope that my
  own children may emulate your virtues, if they are happily spared your
  sorrows.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="pre"
     name="pre">PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">During a visit to Chesterfield, in the autumn of the year
  1831, I first conceived the notion of writing this story. Wishing to
  describe, somewhat minutely, the trim gardens, the picturesque domains, the
  rook-haunted groves, the gloomy chambers, and gloomier galleries, of an
  ancient Hall with which I was acquainted, I resolved to attempt a story in
  the bygone style of Mrs. Radcliffe,&mdash;which had always inexpressible
  charms for me,&mdash;substituting an old English squire, an old English
  manorial residence, and an old English highwayman, for the Italian marchese,
  the castle, and the brigand of the great mistress of Romance.</p>

  <p>While revolving this subject, I happened, one evening, to enter the
  spacious cemetery attached to the church with the queer, twisted steeple,
  which, like the uplifted tail of the renowned Dragon of Wantley, to whom
  "houses and churches were as capons and turkeys," seems to menace the good
  town of Chesterfield with destruction. Here an incident occurred, on the
  opening of a vault, which it is needless to relate, but which supplied me
  with a hint for the commencement of my romance, as well as for the ballad
  entitled "The Coffin." Upon this hint I immediately acted; and the earlier
  chapters of the book, together with the description of the ancestral mansion
  of the Rookwoods, were completed before I quitted Chesterfield.</p>

  <p>Another and much larger portion of the work was written during a residence
  at Rottingdean, in Sussex, in the latter part of 1833, and owes its
  inspiration to many delightful walks over the South Downs. Romance-writing
  was pleasant occupation then.</p>

  <p>The Ride to York was completed in one day and one night. This
  feat&mdash;for a feat it was, being the composition of a hundred ordinary
  novel pages in less than twenty-four hours&mdash;was achieved at "The Elms,"
  a house I then occupied at Kilburn. Well do I remember the fever into which I
  was thrown during the time of composition. My pen literally scoured over the
  pages. So thoroughly did I identify myself with the flying highwayman, that,
  once started, I found it impossible to halt. Animated by kindred enthusiasm,
  I cleared every obstacle in my path with as much facility as Turpin disposed
  of the impediments that beset his flight. In his company, I mounted the
  hill-side, dashed through the bustling village, swept over the desolate
  heath, threaded the silent street, plunged into the eddying stream, and kept
  an onward course, without pause, without hindrance, without fatigue. With him
  I shouted, sang, laughed, exulted, wept. Nor did I retire to rest till, in
  imagination, I heard the bell of York Minster toll forth the knell of poor
  Black Bess.</p>

  <p>The supernatural occurrence, forming the groundwork of one of the ballads
  which I have made the harbinger of doom to the house of Rookwood, is
  ascribed, by popular superstition, to a family resident in Sussex; upon whose
  estate the fatal tree&mdash;a gigantic lime, with mighty arms and huge girth
  of trunk, as described in the song&mdash;is still carefully preserved.
  Cuckfield Place, to which this singular piece of timber is attached, is, I
  may state, for the benefit of the curious, the real Rookwood Hall; for I have
  not drawn upon imagination, but upon memory, in describing the seat and
  domains of that fated family. The general features of the venerable
  structure, several of its chambers, the old garden, and, in particular, the
  noble park, with its spreading prospects, its picturesque views of the Hall,
  "like bits of Mrs. Radcliffe,"&mdash;as the poet Shelley once observed of the
  same scene,&mdash;its deep glades, through which the deer come lightly
  tripping down, its uplands, slopes, brooks, brakes, coverts, and groves, are
  carefully delineated.</p>

  <p>The superstition of a fallen branch affording a presage of approaching
  death is not peculiar to the family I have mentioned. Many other old houses
  have been equally favored: in fact, there is scarcely an ancient family in
  the kingdom without a boding sign. For instance, the Breretons of Brereton,
  in Cheshire, were warned by the appearance of stocks of trees floating, like
  the swollen bodies of long-drowned men, upon the surface of a sombre
  lake&mdash;called Blackmere, from the inky color of its
  waters&mdash;adjoining their residence; and numerous other examples might be
  given. The death-presage of the Breretons is alluded to by Drayton in the
  "<i>Polyolbion</i>."</p>

  <p>It has been well observed by Barry Cornwall, "that the songs which occur
  in dramas are more natural than those which proceed from the author in
  person." With equal force does the reasoning apply to the romance, which may
  be termed the drama of the closet. It would seem strange, on a first view,
  that an author should be more at home in an assumed character than his own.
  But experience shows the position to be correct. Conscious he is no longer
  individually associated with his work, the writer proceeds with all the
  freedom of irresponsibility. His idiosyncrasy is merged in that of the
  personages he represents. He thinks with their thoughts, sees with their
  eyes, speaks with their tongues. His strains are such as he
  himself&mdash;<i>per se</i>&mdash;would not, perhaps could not, have
  originated. In this light he may be said to bring to his subject not one
  mind, but several; he becomes not one poet, but many; for each actor in his
  drama has a share, and an important share, in the lyrical <i>estro</i> to
  which he gives birth. This it is which has imparted any verve, variety, or
  dramatic character they possess, to the ballads contained in this production.
  Turpin I look upon as the real songster of "Black Bess;" to Jerry Juniper I
  am unquestionably indebted for a flash melody which, without his hint, would
  never have been written, while to the sexton I owe the solitary gleam of
  light I have been enabled to throw upon the horrors and mystery of the
  churchyard.</p>

  <p>As I have casually alluded to the flash song of Jerry Juniper, I may,
  perhaps, be allowed to make a few observations upon this branch of
  versification. It is somewhat curious, with a dialect so racy, idiomatic, and
  plastic as our own cant, that its metrical capabilities should have been so
  little essayed. The French have numerous <i>chansons d'argot</i>, ranging
  from the time of Charles Bourdigné and Villon down to that of Vidocq and
  Victor Hugo, the last of whom has enlivened the horrors of his "<i>Dernier
  Jour d'un Condamné</i>" by a festive song of this class. The Spaniards
  possess a large collection of <i>Romances de Germania</i>, by various
  authors, amongst whom Quevedo holds a distinguished place. We, on the
  contrary, have scarcely any slang songs of merit. With a race of depredators
  so melodious and convivial as our highwaymen, this is the more to be wondered
  at. Had they no bards amongst their bands? Was there no minstrel at hand to
  record their exploits? I can only call to mind one robber who was a
  poet,&mdash;Delany, and <i>he</i> was an Irishman. This barrenness, I have
  shown, is not attributable to the poverty of the soil, but to the want of due
  cultivation. Materials are at hand in abundance, but there have been few
  operators. Dekker, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Ben Jonson have all dealt
  largely in this jargon, but not lyrically; and one of the earliest and best
  specimens of a canting-song occurs in Brome's "<i>Jovial Crew</i>;" and in
  the "<i>Adventures of Bamfylde Moore Carew</i>" there is a solitary ode,
  addressed by the mendicant fraternity to their newly-elected monarch; but it
  has little humor, and can scarcely be called a genuine canting-song. This ode
  brings us down to our own time; to the effusions of the illustrious Pierce
  Egan; to Tom Moore's Flights of "<i>Fancy</i>;" to John Jackson's famous
  chant, "<i>On the High Toby Spice Flash the Muzzle</i>," cited by Lord Byron
  in a note to "<i>Don Juan</i>;" and to the glorious Irish ballad, worth them
  all put together, entitled "<i>The Night Before Larry Was Stretched</i>."
  This facetious performance is attributed to the late Dean Burrowes, of Cork.
  It is worthy of note that almost all modern aspirants to the graces of the
  <i>Musa Pedestris</i> are Irishmen. Of all rhymesters of the "<i>Road</i>,"
  however, Dean Burrowes is, as yet, most fully entitled to the laurel. Larry
  is quite "the potato!"</p>

  <p>And here, as the candidates are so few, and their pretensions so
  humble,</p>

  <p class="verse">I can't help putting in my claim for praise.</p><br>

  <p>I venture to affirm that I have done something more than has been
  accomplished by my predecessors, or contemporaries, with the significant
  language under consideration. I have written a purely flash song, of which
  the great and peculiar merit consists in its being utterly incomprehensible
  to the uninformed understanding, while its meaning must be perfectly clear
  and perspicuous to the practised <i>patterer</i> of <i>Romany</i>, or
  <i>Pedlar's French</i>. I have, moreover, been the first to introduce and
  naturalize amongst us a measure which, though common enough in the Argotic
  minstrelsy of France, has been hitherto utterly unknown to our
  <i>pedestrian</i> poetry. Some years afterwards, the song alluded to, better
  known under the title of "<i>Nix My Dolly, Pals,&mdash;Fake Away!</i>" sprang
  into extraordinary popularity, being set to music by Rodwell, and chanted by
  glorious Paul Bedford and clever little Mrs. Keeley.</p>

  <p>Before quitting the subject of these songs, I may mention that they
  probably would not have been written at all if one of the earliest of
  them&mdash;a chance experiment&mdash;had not excited the warm approbation of
  my friend, Charles Ollier, author of the striking romance of "Ferrers." This
  induced me to prosecute the vein accidentally opened.</p>

  <p>Turpin was the hero of my boyhood. I had always a strange passion for
  highwaymen, and have listened by the hour to their exploits, as narrated by
  my father, and especially to those of "Dauntless Dick," that "chief minion of
  the moon." One of Turpin's adventures in particular, the ride to Hough Green,
  which took deep hold of my fancy, I have recorded in song. When a boy, I have
  often lingered by the side of the deep old road where this robbery was
  committed, to cast wistful glances into its mysterious windings; and when
  night deepened the shadows of the trees, have urged my horse on his journey,
  from a vague apprehension of a visit from the ghostly highwayman. And then
  there was the Bollin, with its shelvy banks, which Turpin cleared at a bound;
  the broad meadows over which he winged his flight; the pleasant bowling-green
  of the pleasant old inn at Hough, where he produced his watch to the Cheshire
  squires, with whom he was upon terms of intimacy; all brought something of
  the gallant robber to mind. No wonder, in after-years, in selecting a
  highwayman for a character in a tale, I should choose my old favorite, Dick
  Turpin.</p>

  <p>In reference to two of the characters here introduced, and drawn from
  personages living at the time the tale was written, it may be mentioned that
  poor Jerry Juniper met his death from an accident at Chichester, while he was
  proceeding to Goodwood races; and that the knight of Malta,&mdash;Mr. Tom, a
  brewer of Truro, the self-styled Sir William Courtenay, who played the
  strange tricks at Canterbury chronicled in a song given in these
  pages,&mdash;after his release from Banning Heath Asylum, was shot through
  the head while leading on a mob of riotous Kentish yeomen, whom he had
  persuaded that he was the Messiah!</p>

  <p>If the design of Romance be, what it has been held, the exposition of a
  useful truth by means of an interesting story, I fear I have but imperfectly
  fulfilled the office imposed upon me; having, as I will freely confess, had,
  throughout, an eye rather to the reader's amusement than his edification. One
  wholesome moral, however, may, I trust, be gathered from the perusal of this
  Tale; namely, that, without due governance of the passions, high aspirations
  and generous emotions will little avail their possessor. The impersonations
  of the Tempter, the Tempted, and the Better Influence may be respectively
  discovered, by those who care to cull the honey from the flower, in the
  Sexton, in Luke, and in Sybil.</p>

  <p>The chief object I had in view in making the present essay was to see how
  far the infusion of a warmer and more genial current into the veins of old
  Romance would succeed in reviving her fluttering and feeble pulses. The
  attempt has succeeded beyond my most sanguine expectation. Romance, if I am
  not mistaken, is destined shortly to undergo an important change. Modified by
  the German and French writers&mdash;by Hoffman, Tieck, Hugo, Dumas, Balzac,
  and Paul Lecroix (<i>le Bibliophile Jacob</i>)&mdash;the structure commenced
  in our own land by Horace Walpole, Monk Lewis, Mrs. Radcliffe, and Maturin,
  but left imperfect and inharmonious, requires, now that the rubbish which
  choked up its approach is removed, only the hand of the skilful architect to
  its entire renovation and perfection.</p>

  <p>And now, having said my say, I must bid you, worthy reader, farewell.
  Beseeching you, in the words of old Rabelais, "to interpret all my sayings
  and doings in the perfectest sense. Reverence the cheese-like brain that
  feeds you with all these jolly maggots; and do what lies in you to keep me
  always merry. Be frolic now, my lads! Cheer up your hearts, and joyfully read
  the rest, with all ease of your body, and comfort of your reins."</p>

</div>

  <p class="first">WITHIN a sepulchral vault, and at midnight, two persons were
  seated. The chamber was of singular construction and considerable extent. The
  roof was of solid stone masonry, and rose in a wide semicircular arch to the
  height of about seventeen feet, measured from the centre of the ceiling to
  the ground floor, while the sides were divided by slight partition-walls into
  ranges of low, narrow catacombs. The entrance to each cavity was surrounded
  by an obtusely-pointed arch, resting upon slender granite pillars; and the
  intervening space was filled up with a variety of tablets, escutcheons,
  shields, and inscriptions, recording the titles and heraldic honors of the
  departed. There were no doors to the niches; and within might be seen piles
  of coffins, packed one upon another, till the floor groaned with the weight
  of lead. Against one of the pillars, upon a hook, hung a rack of tattered,
  time-out-of-mind hatchments; and in the centre of the tomb might be seen the
  effigies of Sir Ranulph de Rokewode, the builder of the mausoleum, and the
  founder of the race who slept within its walls. This statue, wrought in black
  marble, differed from most monumental carved-work, in that its posture was
  erect and lifelike. Sir Ranulph was represented as sheathed in a complete
  suit of mail, decorated with his emblazoned and gilded surcoat, his arm
  leaning upon the pommel of a weighty curtal-axe. The attitude was that of
  stern repose. A conically-formed helmet rested upon the brow; the beaver was
  raised, and revealed harsh but commanding features. The golden spur of
  knighthood was fixed upon the heel; and, at the feet, enshrined in a costly
  sarcophagus of marble, dug from the same quarry as the statue, rested the
  mortal remains of one of "the sternest knights to his mortal foe that ever
  put speare in the rest."</p>

  <p>Streaming in a wavering line upon the roof, the sickly flame of a candle
  partially fell upon the human figures before alluded to, throwing them into
  darkest relief, and casting their opaque and fantastical shadows along the
  ground. An old coffin upon a bier, we have said, served the mysterious twain
  for a seat. Between them stood a bottle and a glass, evidences that whatever
  might be the ulterior object of their stealthy communion, the immediate
  comfort of the creature had not been altogether overlooked. At the feet of
  one of the personages were laid a mattock, a horn lantern&mdash;from which
  the candle had been removed&mdash;, a crowbar, and a bunch of keys. Near to
  these implements of a vocation which the reader will readily surmise, rested
  a strange superannuated terrier with a wiry back and frosted muzzle; a head
  minus an ear, and a leg wanting a paw. His master, for such we shall suppose
  him, was an old man with a lofty forehead, covered with a singularly shaped
  nightcap, and clothed, as to his lower limbs, with tight, ribbed, gray
  worsted hose, ascending externally, after a bygone fashion, considerably
  above the knee. The old man's elbow rested upon the handle of his spade, his
  wrist supported his chin, and his gray glassy eyes, glimmering like
  marsh-meteors in the candle-light, were fixed upon his companion with a
  glance of searching scrutiny.</p>

  <p>The object of his investigation, a much more youthful and interesting
  person, seemed lost in reverie, and alike insensible to time, place, and the
  object of the meeting. With both hands grasped round the barrel of a
  fowling-piece, and his face leaning upon the same support, the features were
  entirely concealed from view; the light, too, being at the back, and shedding
  its rays over, rather than upon his person, aided his disguise. Yet, even
  thus imperfectly defined, the outline of the head, and the proportions of the
  figure, were eminently striking and symmetrical. Attired in a rough
  forester's costume, of the mode of 1737, and of the roughest texture and
  rudest make, his wild garb would have determined his rank as sufficiently
  humble in the scale of society, had not a certain loftiness of manner, and
  bold, though reckless deportment, argued pretensions on the part of the
  wearer to a more elevated station in life, and contradicted, in a great
  measure, the impression produced by the homely appearance of his habiliments.
  A cap of shaggy brown fur, fancifully, but not ungracefully fashioned,
  covered his head, from beneath which, dropping, in natural clusters over his
  neck and shoulders, a cloud of raven hair escaped. Subsequently, when his
  face was more fully revealed, it proved to be that of a young man, of dark
  aspect, and grave, melancholy expression of countenance, approaching even to
  the stern, when at rest; though sufficiently animated and earnest when
  engaged in conversation, or otherwise excited. His features were regular,
  delicately formed, and might be characterized as singularly handsome, were it
  not for a want of roundness in the contour of the face which gave the
  lineaments a thin, worn look, totally distinct, however, from haggardness or
  emaciation. The nose was delicate and fine; the nostril especially so; the
  upper lip was short, curling, graceful, and haughtily expressive. As to
  complexion, his skin had a truly Spanish warmth and intensity of coloring.
  His figure, when raised, was tall and masculine, and though slight, exhibited
  great personal vigor.</p>

  <p>We will now turn to his companion, the old man with the great gray
  glittering eyes. Peter Bradley, of Rookwood&mdash;comitatû Ebor&mdash;, where
  he had exercised the vocation of sexton for the best part of a life already
  drawn out to the full span ordinarily allotted to mortality, was an odd
  caricature of humanity. His figure was lean, and almost as lank as a
  skeleton. His bald head reminded one of a bleached skull, allowing for the
  overhanging and hoary brows. Deep-seated, and sunken within their sockets,
  his gray orbs gleamed with intolerable lustre. Few could endure his gaze;
  and, aware of his power, Peter seldom failed to exercise it. He had likewise
  another habit, which, as it savored of insanity, made him an object of
  commiseration with some, while it rendered him yet more obnoxious to others.
  The habit we allude to, was the indulgence of wild screaming laughter at
  times when all merriment should be checked; and when the exhibition of levity
  must proceed from utter disregard of human grief and suffering, or from
  mental alienation.</p>

  <p>Wearied with the prolonged silence, Peter at length condescended to speak.
  His voice was harsh and grating as a rusty hinge.</p>

  <p>"Another glass?" said he, pouring out a modicum of the pale fluid.</p>

  <p>His companion shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It will keep out the cold," continued the sexton, pressing the liquid
  upon him: "and you, who are not so much accustomed as I am to the damps of a
  vault, may suffer from them. Besides," added he, sneeringly, "it will give
  you courage."</p>

  <p>His companion answered not. But the flash of his eye resented the implied
  reproach.</p>

  <p>"Nay, never stare at me so hard, Luke," continued the sexton; "I doubt
  neither your courage nor your firmness. But if you won't drink, I will.
  Here's to the rest eternal of Sir Piers Rookwood! You'll say amen to that
  pledge, or you are neither grandson of mine, nor offspring of his loins."</p>

  <p>"Why should I reverence his memory," answered Luke, bitterly, refusing the
  proffered potion, "who showed no fatherly love for me? He disowned <i>me</i>
  in life: in death I disown <i>him</i>. Sir Piers Rookwood was no father of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"He was as certainly your father, as Susan Bradley, your mother, was my
  daughter," rejoined the sexton.</p>

  <p>"And, surely," cried Luke, impetuously, "<i>you</i> need not boast of the
  connection! 'Tis not for you, old man, to couple their names
  together&mdash;to exult in your daughter's disgrace and your own dishonor.
  Shame! shame! Speak not of them in the same breath, if you would not have me
  invoke curses on the dead! <i>I</i> have no reverence&mdash;whatever
  <i>you</i> may have&mdash;for the seducer&mdash;for the murderer of my
  mother."</p>

  <p>"You have choice store of epithets, in sooth, good grandson," rejoined
  Peter, with a chuckling laugh. "Sir Piers a murderer!"</p>

  <p>"Tush!" exclaimed Luke, indignantly, "affect not ignorance. You have
  better knowledge than I have of the truth or falsehood of the dark tale that
  has gone abroad respecting my mother's fate; and unless report has belied you
  foully, had substantial reasons for keeping sealed lips on the occasion. But
  to change this painful subject," added he, with a sudden alteration of
  manner, "at what hour did Sir Piers Rookwood die?"</p>

  <p>"On Thursday last, in the night-time. The exact hour I know not," replied
  the sexton.</p>

  <p>"Of what ailment?"</p>

  <p>"Neither do I know that. His end was sudden, yet not without a warning
  sign."</p>

  <p>"What warning?" inquired Luke.</p>

  <p>"Neither more nor less than the death-omen of the house. You look
  astonished. Is it possible you have never heard of the ominous Lime-Tree, and
  the Fatal Bough? Why, 'tis a common tale hereabouts, and has been for
  centuries. Any old crone would tell it you. Peradventure, you <i>have</i>seen
  the old avenue of lime-trees leading to the hall, nearly a quarter of a mile
  in length, and as noble a row of timber as any in the West Riding of
  Yorkshire. Well, there is one tree&mdash;the last on the left hand before you
  come to the clock-house&mdash;larger than all the rest&mdash;a huge piece of
  timber, with broad spreading branches, and of I know not what girth in the
  trunk. That tree is, in some mysterious manner, connected with the family of
  Rookwood, and immediately previous to the death of one of that line, a branch
  is sure to be shed from the parent stem, prognosticating his doom. But you
  shall hear the legend." And in a strange sepulchral tone, not inappropriate,
  however, to his subject, Peter chanted the following ballad:</p>

  <h3>THE LEGEND OF THE LIME-TREE</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">Amid the grove o'er-arched above with lime-trees
     old and tall<br>
  &mdash;The avenue that leads unto the Rookwood's ancient hall&mdash;,<br>
  High o'er the rest its towering crest one tree rears to the sky,<br>
  And wide out-flings, like mighty wings, its arms umbrageously.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">Seven yards its base would scarce embrace&mdash;a
     goodly tree I ween,<br>
  With silver bark, and foliage dark, of melancholy green;<br>
  And mid its boughs two ravens house, and build from year to year,<br>
  Their black brood hatch&mdash;their black brood watch&mdash;then screaming
  disappear.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">In that old tree when playfully the summer breezes
     sigh,<br>
  Its leaves are stirred, and there is heard a low and plaintive cry;<br>
  And when in shrieks the storm blast speaks its reverend boughs among,<br>
  Sad wailing moans, like human groans, the concert harsh prolong.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">But whether gale or calm prevail, or threatening
     cloud hath fled,<br>
  By hand of Fate, predestinate, a limb that tree will shed;<br>
  A verdant bough&mdash;untouched, I trow, by axe or tempest's
  breath&mdash;<br>
  To Rookwood's head an omen dread of fast-approaching death.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">Some think that tree instinct must be with
     preternatural power.<br>
  Like 'larum bell Death's note to knell at Fate's appointed hour;<br>
  While some avow that on its bough are fearful traces seen,<br>
  Red as the stains from human veins, commingling with the green.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">Others, again, there are maintain that on the
     shattered bark<br>
  A print is made, where fiends have laid their scathing talons dark;<br>
  That, ere it falls, the raven calls thrice from that wizard bough;<br>
  And that each cry doth signify what space the Fates allow.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">In olden days, the legend says, as grim Sir
     Ranulph view'd<br>
  A wretched hag her footsteps drag beneath his lordly wood.<br>
  His bloodhounds twain he called amain, and straightway gave her chase;<br>
  Was never seen in forest green, so fierce, so fleet a race!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">With eyes of flame to Ranulph came each red and
     ruthless hound,<br>
  While mangled, torn&mdash;a sight forlorn!&mdash;the hag lay on the
  ground;<br>
  E'en where she lay was turned the clay, and limb and reeking bone<br>
  Within the earth, with ribald mirth, by Ranulph grim were thrown.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">And while as yet the soil was wet with that poor
     witch's gore,<br>
  A lime-tree stake did Ranulph take, and pierced her bosom's core;<br>
  And, strange to tell, what next befell!&mdash;that branch at once took
  root,<br>
  And richly fed, within its bed, strong suckers forth did shoot.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">From year to year fresh boughs appear&mdash;it
     waxes huge in size;<br>
  And, with wild glee, this prodigy Sir Ranulph grim espies.<br>
  One day, when he, beneath that tree, reclined in joy and pride,<br>
  A branch was found upon the ground&mdash;the next, Sir Ranulph died!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:31%">And from that hour a fatal power has ruled that
     Wizard Tree,<br>
  To Ranulph's line a warning sign of doom and destiny:<br>
  For when a bough is found, I trow, beneath its shade to lie,<br>
  Ere suns shall rise thrice in the skies a Rookwood sure shall die!</p><br>

  <p>"And such an omen preceded Sir Piers's demise?" said Luke, who had<br>
  listened with some attention to his grandsire's song.</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably," replied the sexton. "Not longer ago than Tuesday
  morning, I happened to be sauntering down the avenue I have just described. I
  know not what took me thither at that early hour, but I wandered leisurely on
  till I came nigh the Wizard Lime-Tree. Great Heaven! what a surprise awaited
  me! a huge branch lay right across the path. It had evidently just fallen,
  for the leaves were green and unwithered; the sap still oozed from the
  splintered wood; and there was neither trace of knife nor hatchet on the
  bark. I looked up among the boughs to mark the spot from whence it had been
  torn by the hand of Fate&mdash;for no human hand had done it&mdash;and saw
  the pair of ancestral ravens perched amid the foliage, and croaking as those
  carrion fowl are wont to do when they scent a carcass afar off. Just then a
  livelier sound saluted my ears. The cheering cry of a pack of hounds
  resounded from the courts, and the great gates being thrown open, out issued
  Sir Piers, attended by a troop of his roystering companions, all on
  horseback, and all making the welkin ring with their vociferations. Sir Piers
  laughed as loudly as the rest, but his mirth was speedily checked. No sooner
  had his horse&mdash;old Rook, his favorite steed, who never swerved at stake
  or pale before&mdash;set eyes upon the accursed branch, than he started as if
  the fiend stood before him, and, rearing backwards, flung his rider from the
  saddle. At this moment, with loud screams, the wizard ravens took flight. Sir
  Piers was somewhat hurt by the fall, but he was more frightened than hurt;
  and though he tried to put a bold face on the matter, it was plain that his
  efforts to recover himself were fruitless. Dr. Titus Tyrconnel and that wild
  fellow Jack Palmer&mdash;who has lately come to the hall, and of whom you
  know something&mdash;tried to rally him. But it would not do. He broke up the
  day's sport, and returned dejectedly to the hall. Before departing, however,
  he addressed a word to me in private, respecting you; and pointed, with a
  melancholy shake of the head, to the fatal branch. '<i>It is my
  death-warrant</i>,' said he, gloomily. And so it proved; two days afterwards
  his doom was accomplished."</p>

  <p>"And do you place faith in this idle legend?" asked Luke, with affected
  indifference, although it was evident, from his manner, that he himself was
  not so entirely free from a superstitious feeling of credulity as he would
  have it appear.</p>

  <p>"Certes," replied the sexton. "I were more difficult to be convinced than
  the unbelieving disciple else. Thrice hath it occurred to my own knowledge,
  and ever with the same result: first, with Sir Reginald; secondly, with thy
  own mother; and lastly, as I have just told thee, with Sir Piers."</p>

  <p>"I thought you said, even now, that this death omen, if such it be, was
  always confined to the immediate family of Rookwood, and not to mere inmates
  of the mansion."</p>

  <p>"To the heads only of that house, be they male or female."</p>

  <p>"Then how could it apply to my mother? Was <i>she</i> of that house? Was
  <i>she</i> a wife?"</p>

  <p>"Who shall say she was <i>not</i>?" rejoined the sexton.</p>

  <p>"Who shall say she <i>was</i> so?" cried Luke, repeating the words with
  indignant emphasis&mdash;"who will avouch <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>A smile, cold as a wintry sunbeam, played upon the sexton's rigid
  lips.</p>

  <p>"I will bear this no longer," cried Luke; "anger me not, or look to
  yourself. In a word, have you anything to tell me respecting her? if not, let
  me begone."</p>

  <p>"I have. But I will not be hurried by a boy like you," replied Peter,
  doggedly. "Go, if you will, and take the consequences. My lips are sealed
  forever, and I have much to say&mdash;much that it behoves you to know."</p>

  <p>"Be brief, then. When you sought me out this morning, in my retreat with
  the gipsy gang at Davenham Wood, you bade me meet you in the porch of
  Rookwood Church at midnight. I was true to my appointment."</p>

  <p>"And I will keep my promise," replied the sexton. "Draw closer, that I may
  whisper in thine ear. Of every Rookwood who lies around us&mdash;and all that
  ever bore the name, except Sir Piers himself&mdash;who lies in state at the
  hall&mdash;, are here&mdash;not one&mdash;mark what I say&mdash;not one male
  branch of the house but has been suspected&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Of murder!" returned the sexton, in a hissing whisper.</p>

  <p>"Murder!" echoed Luke, recoiling.</p>

  <p>"There is one dark stain&mdash;one foul blot on all. Blood&mdash;blood
  hath been spilt."</p>

  <p>"By all?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, and <i>such</i> blood! theirs was no common crime. Even murder hath
  its degrees. Theirs was of the first class."</p>

  <p>"Their wives!&mdash;you cannot mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, their wives!&mdash;I do. You have heard it, then? Ha! ha! 'tis a
  trick they had. Did you ever hear the old saying?</p>

  <p><i>No mate ever brook would A Rook of the Rookwood!</i></p>

  <p>A merry saying it is, and true. No woman ever stood in a Rookwood's way
  but she was speedily removed&mdash;that's certain. They had all, save poor
  Sir Piers, the knack of stopping a troublesome woman's tongue, and practised
  it to perfection. A rare art, eh?"</p>

  <p>"What have the misdeeds of his ancestry to do with Sir Piers," muttered
  Luke, "much less with my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Everything. If he could not rid himself of his wife&mdash;and she is a
  match for the devil himself&mdash;, the <i>mistress</i> might be more readily
  set aside."</p>

  <p>"Have you absolute knowledge of aught?" asked Luke, his voice tremulous
  with emotion.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I but hinted."</p>

  <p>"Such hints are worse than open speech. Let me know the worst. Did he kill
  her?" And Luke glared at the sexton as if he would have penetrated his secret
  soul.</p>

  <p>But Peter was not easily fathomed. His cold, bright eye returned Luke's
  gaze steadfastly, as he answered, composedly:</p>

  <p>"I have said all I know."</p>

  <p>"But not all you <i>think</i>."</p>

  <p>"Thoughts should not always find utterance, else we might often endanger
  our own safety, and that of others."</p>

  <p>"An idle subterfuge&mdash;and, from you, worse than idle. I will have an
  answer, yea or nay. Was it poison&mdash;was it steel?"</p>

  <p>"Enough&mdash;she died."</p>

  <p>"No, it is not enough. When? Where?"</p>

  <p>"In her sleep&mdash;in her bed."</p>

  <p>"Why, that was natural."</p>

  <p>A wrinkling smile crossed the sexton's brow.</p>

  <p>"What means that horrible gleam of laughter?" exclaimed Luke, grasping the
  shoulder of the man of graves with such force as nearly to annihilate him.
  "Speak, or I will strangle you. She died, you say, in her sleep?"</p>

  <p>"She did so," replied the sexton, shaking off Luke's hold.</p>

  <p>"And was it to tell me that I had a mother's murder to avenge, that you
  brought me to the tomb of her destroyer&mdash;when he is beyond the reach of
  my vengeance?"</p>

  <p>Luke exhibited so much frantic violence of manner and gesture, that the
  sexton entertained some little apprehension that his intellects were
  unsettled by the shock of the intelligence. It was, therefore, in what he
  intended for a soothing tone that he attempted to solicit his grandson's
  attention.</p>

  <p>"I will hear nothing more," interrupted Luke, and the vaulted chamber rang
  with his passionate lamentations. "Am I the sport of this mocking fiend?"
  cried he, "to whom my agony is derision&mdash;my despair a source of
  enjoyment&mdash;beneath whose withering glance my spirit shrinks&mdash;who,
  with half-expressed insinuations, tortures my soul, awakening fancies that
  goad me on to dark and desperate deeds? Dead mother! upon thee I call. If in
  thy grave thou canst hear the cry of thy most wretched son, yearning to
  avenge thee&mdash;answer me, if thou hast the power. Let me have some token
  of the truth or falsity of these wild suppositions, that I may wrestle
  against this demon. But no," added he, in accents of despair, "no ear listens
  to me, save his to whom my wretchedness is food for mockery."</p>

  <p>"Could the dead hear thee, thy mother might do so," returned the sexton.
  "She lies within this space."</p>

  <p>Luke staggered back, as if struck by a sudden shot. He spoke not, but fell
  with a violent shock against a pile of coffins, at which he caught for
  support.</p>

  <p>"What have I done?" he exclaimed, recoiling.</p>

  <p>A thundering crash resounded through the vault. One of the coffins,
  dislodged from its position by his fall, tumbled to the ground, and,
  alighting upon its side, split asunder.</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens! what is this?" cried Luke, as a dead body, clothed in all
  the hideous apparel of the tomb, rolled forth to his feet.</p>

  <p>"It is your mother's corpse," answered the sexton, coldly; "I brought you
  hither to behold it. But you have anticipated my intentions."</p>

  <p>"<i>This</i> my mother?" shrieked Luke, dropping upon his knees by the
  body, and seizing one of its chilly hands, as it lay upon the floor, with the
  face upwards.</p>

  <p>The sexton took the candle from the sconce.</p>

  <p>"Can this be death?" shouted Luke. "Impossible! Oh, God! she
  stirs&mdash;she moves. The light!&mdash;quick. I see her stir! This is
  dreadful!"</p>

  <p>"Do not deceive yourself," said the sexton, in a tone which betrayed more
  emotion than was his wont. "'Tis the bewilderment of fancy. She will never
  stir again."</p>

  <p>And he shaded the candle with his hand, so as to throw the light full upon
  the face of the corpse. It was motionless, as that of an image carved in
  stone. No trace of corruption was visible upon the rigid, yet exquisite
  tracery of its features. A profuse cloud of raven hair, escaped from its
  swathements in the fall, hung like a dark veil over the bosom and person of
  the dead, and presented a startling contrast to the waxlike hue of the skin
  and the pallid cereclothes. Flesh still adhered to the hand, though it
  mouldered into dust within the gripe of Luke, as he pressed the fingers to
  his lips. The shroud was disposed like night-gear about her person, and from
  without its folds a few withered flowers had fallen. A strong aromatic odor,
  of a pungent nature, was diffused around; giving evidence that the art by
  which the ancient Egyptians endeavored to rescue their kindred from
  decomposition had been resorted to, to preserve the fleeting charms of the
  unfortunate Susan Bradley.</p>

  <p>A pause of awful silence succeeded, broken only by the convulsive
  respiration of Luke. The sexton stood by, apparently an indifferent spectator
  of the scene of horror. His eye wandered from the dead to the living, and
  gleamed with a peculiar and indefinable expression, half apathy, half
  abstraction. For one single instant, as he scrutinized the features of his
  daughter, his brow, contracted by anger, immediately afterwards was elevated
  in scorn. But otherwise you would have sought in vain to read the purport of
  that cold, insensible glance, which dwelt for a brief space on the face of
  the mother, and settled eventually upon her son. At length the withered
  flowers attracted his attention. He stooped to pick up one of them.</p>

  <p>"Faded as the hand that gathered ye&mdash;as the bosom on which ye were
  strewn!" he murmured. "No sweet smell left&mdash;but&mdash;faugh!" Holding
  the dry leaves to the flame of the candle, they were instantly ignited, and
  the momentary brilliance played like a smile upon the features of the dead.
  Peter observed the effect. "Such was thy life," he exclaimed; "a brief,
  bright sparkle, followed by dark, utter extinction!"</p>

  <p>Saying which, he flung the expiring ashes of the floweret from his
  hand.</p>

    A dead hand here?</p>

    <p class="quote"><i>Duchess of Malfy.</i></p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE sexton's waning candle now warned him of the progress of
  time, and having completed his arrangements, he addressed himself to Luke,
  intimating his intention of departing. But receiving no answer, and remarking
  no signs of life about his grandson, he began to be apprehensive that he had
  fallen into a swoon. Drawing near to Luke, he took him gently by the arm.
  Thus disturbed, Luke groaned aloud.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to find you can breathe, if it be only after that melancholy
  fashion," said the sexton; "but come, I have wasted time enough already. You
  must indulge your grief elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"Leave me," sighed Luke.</p>

  <p>"What, here? It were as much as my office is worth. You can return some
  other night. But go you must, now&mdash;at least, if you take on thus. I
  never calculated upon a scene like this, or it had been long ere I brought
  you hither. So come away; yet, stay;&mdash;but first lend me a hand to
  replace the body in the coffin."</p>

  <p>"Touch it not," exclaimed Luke; "she shall not rest another hour within
  these accursed walls. I will bear her hence myself." And, sobbing
  hysterically, he relapsed into his former insensibility.</p>

  <p>"Poh! this is worse than midsummer madness," said Peter; "the lad is
  crazed with grief, and all about a mother who has been four-and-twenty years
  in her grave. I will e'en put her out of the way myself."</p>

  <p>Saying which, he proceeded, as noiselessly as possible, to raise the
  corpse in his arms, and deposited it softly within its former tenement.
  Carefully as he executed his task, he could not accomplish it without
  occasioning a slight accident to the fragile frame. Insensible as he was,
  Luke had not relinquished the hold he maintained of his mother's hand. And
  when Peter lifted the body, the ligaments connecting the hand with the arm
  were suddenly snapped asunder. It would appear afterwards, that this joint
  had been tampered with, and partially dislocated. Without, however, entering
  into further particulars in this place, it may be sufficient to observe that
  the hand, detached from the socket at the wrist, remained within the gripe of
  Luke; while, ignorant of the mischief he had occasioned, the sexton continued
  his labors unconsciously, until the noise which he of necessity made in
  stamping with his heel upon the plank, recalled his grandson to sensibility.
  The first thing that the latter perceived, upon collecting his faculties,
  were the skeleton fingers twined within his own.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with the body? Why have you left this with me?"
  demanded he.</p>

  <p>"It was not my intention to have done so," answered the sexton, suspending
  his occupation. "I have just made fast the lid, but it is easily undone. You
  had better restore it."</p>

  <p>"Never," returned Luke, staring at the bony fragment.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! of what advantage is a dead hand? 'Tis an unlucky keepsake, and
  will lead to mischief. The only use I ever heard of such a thing being turned
  to, was in the case of Bow-legged Ben, who was hanged in irons for murder, on
  Hardchase Heath, on the York Road, and whose hand was cut off at the wrist
  the first night to make a Hand of Glory, or Dead Man's Candle. Hast never
  heard what the old song says?" And without awaiting his grandson's response,
  Peter broke into the following wild strain:</p>

  <h3>THE HAND OF GLORY[1]</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">From the corse that hangs on the roadside tree<br>
  &mdash;A murderer's corse it needs must be&mdash;,<br>
  Sever the right hand carefully:&mdash;<br>
  Sever the hand that the deed hath done,<br>
  Ere the flesh that clings to the bones be gone;<br>
  In its dry veins must blood be none.<br>
  Those ghastly fingers white and cold,<br>
  Within a winding-sheet enfold;<br>
  Count the mystic count of seven:<br>
  Name the Governors of Heaven.[2]<br>
  Then in earthen vessel place them,<br>
  And with dragon-wort encase them,<br>
  Bleach them in the noonday sun,<br>
  Till the marrow melt and run,<br>
  Till the flesh is pale and wan,<br>
  As a moon-ensilvered cloud,<br>
  As an unpolluted shroud.<br>
  Next within their chill embrace<br>
  The dead man's Awful Candle place;<br>
  Of murderer's fat must that candle be<br>
  &mdash;You may scoop it beneath the roadside tree&mdash;,<br>
  Of wax, and of Lapland sisame.<br>
  Its wick must be twisted of hair of the dead,<br>
  By the crow and her brood on the wild waste shed.<br>
  Wherever that terrible light shall burn<br>
  Vainly the sleeper may toss and turn;<br>
  His leaden lids shall he ne'er unclose<br>
  So long as that magical taper glows.<br>
  Life and treasures shall he command<br>
  Who knoweth the charm of the Glorious Hand!<br>
  But of black cat's gall let him aye have care,<br>
  And of screech-owl's venomous blood beware!</p><br>

  <p>"Peace!" thundered Luke, extending his mother's hand towards the sexton.
  "What seest thou?"</p>

  <p>"I see something shine. Hold it nigher the light. Ha! that is strange,
  truly. How came that ring there?"</p>

  <p>"Ask of Sir Piers! ask of her <i>husband</i>!" shouted Luke, with a wild
  burst of exulting laughter. "Ha! ha! ha! 'tis a wedding-ring! And look! the
  finger is bent. It must have been placed upon it in her lifetime. There is no
  deception in this&mdash;no trickery&mdash;ha!"</p>

  <p>"It would seem not; the sinew must have been contracted in life. The
  tendons are pulled down so tightly, that the ring could not be withdrawn
  without breaking the finger."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that coffin contains her body?"</p>

  <p>"As sure as I am that this carcass is my own."</p>

  <p>"The hand&mdash;'tis hers. Can any doubt exist?"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore should it? It was broken from the arm by accident within this
  moment. I noticed not the occurrence, but it must have been so."</p>

  <p>"Then it follows that she was wedded, and I am not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Illegitimate. For your own sake I am glad of it."</p>

  <p>"My heart will burst. Oh! could I but establish the fact of this marriage,
  her wrongs would be indeed avenged."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Luke," said the sexton, solemnly. "I told you, when I
  appointed this midnight interview, I had a secret to communicate. That secret
  is now revealed&mdash;that secret was your mother's marriage."</p>

  <p>"And it was known to you during her lifetime?"</p>

  <p>"It was. But I was sworn to secrecy."</p>

  <p>"You have proofs then?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing beyond Sir Piers's word&mdash;and he is silent now."</p>

  <p>"By whom was the ceremony performed?"</p>

  <p>"By a Romish priest&mdash;a Jesuit&mdash;one Father Checkley, at that time
  an inmate of the hall; for Sir Piers, though he afterwards abjured it, at
  that time professed the Catholic faith, and this Checkley officiated as his
  confessor and counsellor; as the partner of his pleasures, and the prompter
  of his iniquities. He was your father's evil genius."</p>

  <p>"Is he still alive?"</p>

  <p>"I know not. After your mother's death he left the hall. I have said he
  was a Jesuit, and I may add, that he was mixed up in dark political
  intrigues, in which your father was too feeble a character to take much
  share. But though too weak to guide, he was a pliant instrument, and this
  Checkley knew. He moulded him according to his wishes. I cannot tell you what
  was the nature of their plots. Suffice it, they were such as, if discovered,
  would have involved your father in ruin. He was saved, however, by his
  wife."</p>

  <p>"And her reward&mdash;&mdash;" groaned Luke.</p>

  <p>"Was death," replied Peter, coldly. "What Jesuit ever forgave a
  wrong&mdash;real or imaginary? Your mother, I ought to have said, was a
  Protestant. Hence there was a difference of religious opinion&mdash;the worst
  of differences that can exist between husband and wife&mdash;. Checkley vowed
  her destruction, and he kept his vow. He was enamored of her beauty. But
  while he burnt with adulterous desire, he was consumed by fiercest
  hate&mdash;contending, and yet strangely-reconcilable passions&mdash;as you
  may have reason, hereafter, to discover."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Luke, grinding his teeth.</p>

  <p>"I have done," returned Peter. "From that hour your father's love for his
  supposed mistress, and unacknowledged wife, declined; and with his waning
  love declined her health. I will not waste words in describing the
  catastrophe that awaited her union. It will be enough to say, she was found
  one morning a corpse within her bed. Whatever suspicions were attached to Sir
  Piers were quieted by Checkley, who distributed gold, largely and discreetly.
  The body was embalmed by Barbara Lovel, the Gipsy Queen."</p>

  <p>"My foster-mother!" exclaimed Luke, in a tone of extreme astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Ah," replied Peter, "from her you may learn all particulars. You have now
  seen what remains of your mother. You are in possession of the secret of your
  birth. The path is before you, and if you would arrive at honor you must
  pursue it steadily, turning neither to the right nor to the left. Opposition
  you will meet at each step. But fresh lights may be thrown upon this
  difficult case. It is in vain to hope for Checkley's evidence, even should
  the caitiff priest be living. He is himself too deeply
  implicated&mdash;ha!"</p>

  <p>Peter stopped, for at this moment the flame of the candle suddenly
  expired, and the speakers were left in total darkness. Something like a groan
  followed the conclusion of the sexton's discourse. It was evident that it
  proceeded not from his grandson, as an exclamation burst from him at the same
  instant. Luke stretched out his arm. A cold hand seemed to press against his
  own, communicating a chill like death to his frame.</p>

  <p>"Who is between us?" he ejaculated.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" cried the sexton, leaping from the coffin-lid with an agility
  that did him honor. "Is aught between us?"</p>

  <p>"I will discharge my gun. Its flash will light us."</p>

  <p>"Do so," hastily rejoined Peter. "But not in this direction."</p>

  <p>"Get behind me," cried Luke. And he pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p>A blaze of vivid light illumined the darkness. Still nothing was visible,
  save the warrior figure, which was seen for a moment, and then vanished like
  a ghost. The buck-shot rattled against the further end of the vault.</p>

  <p>"Let us go hence," ejaculated the sexton, who had rushed to the door, and
  thrown it wide open. "Mole! Mole!" cried he, and the dog sprang after
  him.</p>

  <p>"I could have sworn I felt something," said Luke; "whence issued that
  groan?"</p>

  <p>"Ask not whence," replied Peter. "Reach me my mattock, and spade, and the
  lantern; they are behind you. And stay, it were better to bring away the
  bottle."</p>

  <p>"Take them, and leave me here."</p>

  <p>"Alone in the vault?&mdash;no, no, Luke, I have not told you half I know
  concerning that mystic statue. It is said to move&mdash;to walk&mdash;to
  raise its axe&mdash;be warned, I pray."</p>

  <p>"Leave me, or abide, if you will, my coming, in the church. If there is
  aught that may be revealed to my ear alone, I will not shrink from it, though
  the dead themselves should arise to proclaim the mystery. It may
  be&mdash;but&mdash;go&mdash;there are your tools." And he shut the door, with
  a jar that shook the sexton's frame.</p>

  <p>Peter, after some muttered murmurings at the hardihood and madness, as he
  termed it, of his grandson, disposed his lanky limbs to repose upon a
  cushioned bench without the communion railing. As the pale moonlight fell
  upon his gaunt and cadaverous visage, he looked like some unholy thing
  suddenly annihilated by the presiding influence of that sacred spot. Mole
  crouched himself in a ring at his master's feet. Peter had not dozed many
  minutes, when he was aroused by Luke's return. The latter was very pale, and
  the damp stood in big drops upon his brow.</p>

  <p>"Have you made fast the door?" inquired the sexton.</p>

  <p>"Here is the key."</p>

  <p>"What have you seen?" he next demanded.</p>

  <p>Luke made no answer. At that moment, the church clock struck two, breaking
  the stillness with an iron clang. Luke raised his eyes. A ray of moonlight,
  streaming obliquely through the painted window, fell upon the gilt lettering
  of a black mural entablature. The lower part of the inscription was in the
  shade, but the emblazonment, and the words&mdash;</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center"><small>Orate pro anima Reginaldi Rookwood
     equitis aurati,</small></p>

  <p class="first">were clear and distinct. Luke trembled, he knew not why, as
  the sexton pointed to it.</p>

  <p>"You have heard of the handwriting upon the wall," said Peter. "Look
  there!&mdash;'His kingdom hath been taken from him.' Ha, ha! Listen to me. Of
  all thy monster race&mdash;of all the race of Rookwood I should say&mdash;no
  demon ever stalked the earth more terrible than him whose tablet you now
  behold. By him a brother was betrayed; by him a brother's wife was
  dishonored. Love, honor, friendship, were with him as words. He regarded no
  ties; he defied and set at naught all human laws and obligations&mdash;and
  yet he was religious, or esteemed so&mdash;received the <i>viaticum</i>, and
  died full of years and honors, hugging salvation to his sinful heart. And
  after death he has yon lying epitaph to record his virtues. <i>His</i>
  virtues! ha, ha! Ask him who preaches to the kneeling throng gathering within
  this holy place what shall be the murderer's portion&mdash;and he will
  answer&mdash;<i>Death!</i> And yet Sir Reginald was long-lived. The awful
  question, 'Cain, where is thy brother?' broke not his tranquil slumbers.
  Luke, I have told you much&mdash;but not all. You know not, as yet&mdash;nor
  shall you know your destiny; but you shall be the avenger of infamy and
  blood. I have a sacred charge committed to my keeping, which, hereafter, I
  may delegate to you. You <i>shall</i> be Sir Luke Rookwood, but the
  conditions must be mine to propose."</p>

  <p>"No more," said Luke; "my brain reels. I am faint. Let us quit this place,
  and get into the fresh air." And striding past his grandsire he traversed the
  aisles with hasty steps. Peter was not slow to follow. The key was applied,
  and they emerged into the churchyard. The grassy mounds were bathed in the
  moonbeams, and the two yew-trees, throwing their black jagged shadows over
  the grave hills, looked like evil spirits brooding over the repose of the
  righteous.</p>

  <p>The sexton noticed the deathly paleness of Luke's countenance, but he
  fancied it might proceed from the tinge of the sallow moonlight.</p>

  <p>"I will be with you at your cottage ere daybreak," said Luke. And turning
  an angle of the church, he disappeared from view.</p>

  <p>"So," exclaimed Peter, gazing after him, "the train is laid; the spark has
  been applied; the explosion will soon follow. The hour is fast approaching
  when I shall behold this accursed house shaken to dust, and when my
  long-delayed vengeance will be gratified. In that hope I am content to drag
  on the brief remnant of my days. Meanwhile, I must not omit the stimulant. In
  a short time I may not require it." Draining the bottle to the last drop, he
  flung it from him, and commenced chanting, in a high key and cracked voice, a
  wild ditty, the words of which ran as follow:</p>

  <p>Shouldering his spade, and whistling to his dog, the sexton quitted the

  <p>Peter had not been gone many seconds, when a dark figure, muffled in a
  wide black mantle, emerged from among the tombs surrounding the church; gazed
  after him for a few seconds, and then, with a menacing gesture, retreated
  behind the ivied buttresses of the gray old pile.</p>

  <p class="first">LUKE'S first impulse had been to free himself from the
  restraint imposed by his grandsire's society. He longed to commune with
  himself. Leaping the small boundary-wall, which defended the churchyard from
  a deep green lane, he hurried along in a direction contrary to that taken by
  the sexton, making the best of his way until he arrived at a gap in the
  high-banked hazel hedge which overhung the road. Heedless of the impediments
  thrown in his way by the undergrowth of a rough ring fence, he struck through
  the opening that presented itself, and, climbing over the moss-grown paling,
  trod presently upon the elastic sward of Rookwood Park.</p>

  <p>A few minutes' rapid walking brought him to the summit of a rising ground
  crowned with aged oaks and, as he passed beneath their broad shadows, his
  troubled spirit, soothed by the quietude of the scene, in part resumed its
  serenity.</p>

  <p>Luke yielded to the gentle influence of the time and hour. The stillness
  of the spot allayed the irritation of his frame, and the dewy chillness
  cooled the fever of his brow. Leaning for support against the gnarled trunk
  of one of the trees, he gave himself up to contemplation. The events of the
  last hour&mdash;of his whole existence&mdash;passed in rapid review before
  him. The thought of the wayward, vagabond life he had led; of the wild
  adventures of his youth; of all he had been; of all he had <i>done</i>, of
  all he had endured&mdash;crowded his mind; and then, like the passing of a
  cloud flitting across the autumnal moon, and occasionally obscuring the
  smiling landscape before him, his soul was shadowed by the remembrance of the
  awful revelations of the last hour, and the fearful knowledge he had acquired
  of his mother's fate&mdash;of his father's guilt.</p>

  <p>The eminence on which he stood was one of the highest points of the park,
  and commanded a view of the hall, which might be a quarter of a mile distant,
  discernible through a broken vista of trees, its whitened walls glimmering in
  the moonlight, and its tall chimney spiring far from out the round masses of
  wood in which it lay embosomed. The ground gradually sloped in that
  direction, occasionally rising into swells, studded with magnificent
  timber&mdash;dipping into smooth dells, or stretching out into level glades,
  until it suddenly sank into a deep declivity, that formed an effectual
  division, without the intervention of a haw-haw, or other barrier, between
  the chase and the home-park. A slender stream strayed through this ravine,
  having found its way thither from a small reservoir, hidden in the higher
  plantations to the left; and further on, in the open ground, and in a line
  with the hall, though, of course, much below the level of the building,
  assisted by many local springs, and restrained by a variety of natural and
  artificial embankments, this brook spread out into an expansive sheet of
  water. Crossed by a rustic bridge, the only communication between the parks,
  the pool found its outlet into the meads below; and even at that distance,
  and in that still hour, you might almost catch the sound of the brawling
  waters, as they dashed down the weir in a foaming cascade; while, far away,
  in the spreading valley, the serpentine meanderings of the slender current
  might be traced, glittering like silvery threads in the moonshine. The mild
  beams of the queen of night, then in her meridian, trembled upon the topmost
  branches of the tall timber, quivering like diamond spray upon the outer
  foliage; and, penetrating through the interstices of the trees, fell upon the
  light wreaths of vapor then beginning to arise from the surface of the pool,
  steeping them in misty splendor, and lending to this part of the picture a
  character of dreamy and unearthly beauty.</p>

  <p>All else was in unison. No sound interrupted the silence of Luke's
  solitude, except the hooting of a large gray owl, that, scared at his
  approach, or in search of prey, winged its spectral flight in continuous and
  mazy circles round his head, uttering at each wheel its startling whoop; or a
  deep, distant bay, that ever and anon boomed upon the ear, proceeding from a
  pack of hounds kennelled in a shed adjoining the pool before mentioned, but
  which was shrouded from view by the rising mist. No living objects presented
  themselves, save a herd of deer, crouched in a covert of brown fern beneath
  the shadow of a few stunted trees, immediately below the point of land on
  which Luke stood; and although their branching antlers could scarcely be
  detected from the ramifications of the wood itself, they escaped not his
  practised ken.</p>

  <p>"How often," murmured Luke, "in years gone by, have I traversed these
  moonlit glades, and wandered amidst these woodlands, on nights heavenly as
  this&mdash;ay, and to some purpose, as yon thinned herd might testify! Every
  dingle, every dell, every rising brow, every bosky vale and shelving covert,
  have been as familiar to my track as to that of the fleetest and freest of
  their number: scarce a tree amidst the thickest of yon outstretching forest
  with which I cannot claim acquaintance; 'tis long since I have seen them. By
  Heavens! 'tis beautiful! and it is all my own! Can I forget that it was here
  I first emancipated myself from thraldom? Can I forget the boundless feeling
  of delight that danced within my veins when I first threw off the yoke of
  servitude, and roved unshackled, unrestrained, amidst these woods? The wild
  intoxicating bliss still tingles to my heart. And they are all my
  own&mdash;my own! Softly, what have we there?"</p>

  <p>Luke's attention was arrested by an object which could not fail to
  interest him, sportsman as he was. A snorting bray was heard, and a lordly
  stag stalked slowly and majestically from out the copse. Luke watched the
  actions of the noble animal with great interest, drawing back into the shade.
  A hundred yards, or thereabouts, might be between him and the buck. It was
  within range of ball. Luke mechanically grasped his gun; yet his hand had
  scarcely raised the piece half way to his shoulder, when he dropped it again
  to its rest.</p>

  <p>"What am I about to do?" he mentally ejaculated. "Why, for mere pastime,
  should I take away yon noble creature's life, when his carcass would be
  utterly useless to me? Yet such is the force of habit, that I can scarce
  resist the impulse that tempted me to fire; and I have known the time, and
  that not long since, when I should have shown no such self-control."</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the danger it had escaped, the animal moved forward with
  the same stately step. Suddenly it stopped, with ears pricked, as if some
  sound had smote them. At that instant the click of a gun-lock was heard, at a
  little distance to the right. The piece had missed fire. An instantaneous
  report from another gun succeeded; and, with a bound high in air, the buck
  fell upon his back, struggling in the agonies of death. Luke had at once
  divined the cause; he was aware that poachers were at hand. He fancied that
  he knew the parties; nor was he deceived in his conjecture. Two figures
  issued instantly from a covert on the right, and making to the spot, the
  first who reached it put an end to the animal's struggles by plunging a knife
  into its throat. The affrighted herd took to their heels, and were seen
  darting swiftly down the chase.</p>

  <p>One of the twain, meantime, was occupied in feeling for the deer's fat,
  when he was approached by the other, who pointed in the direction of the
  house. The former raised himself from his kneeling posture, and both appeared
  to listen attentively. Luke fancied he heard a slight sound in the distance;
  whatever the noise proceeded from, it was evident the deer-stealers were
  alarmed. They laid hold of the buck, and, dragging it along, concealed the
  carcass among the tall fern; they then retreated, halting for an instant to
  deliberate, within a few yards of Luke, who was concealed from their view by
  the trunk of the tree, behind which he had ensconced his person. They were so
  near, that he lost not a word of their muttered conference.</p>

  <p>"The game's spoiled this time, Rob Rust, any how," growled one, in an
  angry tone; "the hawks are upon us, and we must leave this brave buck to take
  care of himself. Curse him!&mdash;who'd 'a' thought of Hugh Badger's quitting
  his bed to-night? Respect for his late master might have kept him quiet the
  night before the funeral. But look out, lad. Dost see 'em?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, thanks to old Oliver&mdash;yonder they are," returned the other.
  "One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;and a muzzled bouser to boot. There's Hugh
  at the head on 'em. Shall we stand and show fight? I have half a mind for
  it."</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied the first speaker; "that will never do, Rob&mdash;no
  fighting. Why run the risk of being grabb'd for a haunch of venison? Had Luke
  Bradley or Jack Palmer been with us, it might have been another affair. As it
  is, it won't pay. Besides, we've that to do at the hall to-morrow night that
  may make men of us for the rest of our nat'ral lives. We've pledged ourselves
  to Jack Palmer, and we can't be off in honor. It won't do to be snabbled in
  the nick of it. So let's make for the prad in the lane. Keep in the shade as
  much as you can. Come along, my hearty." And away the two worthies scampered
  down the hill-side.</p>

  <p>"Shall I follow," thought Luke, "and run the risk of falling into the
  keeper's hand, just at this crisis, too? No, but if I am found here, I shall
  be taken for one of the gang. Something must be done&mdash;ha!&mdash;devil
  take them, here they are already."</p>

  <p>Further time was not allowed him for reflection. A hoarse baying was
  heard, followed by a loud cry from the keepers. The dog had scented out the
  game; and, as secrecy was no longer necessary, his muzzle had been removed.
  To rush forth now were certain betrayal; to remain was almost equally assured
  detection; and, doubting whether he should obtain credence if he delivered
  himself over in that garb and armed, Luke at once rejected the idea. Just
  then it flashed across his recollection that his gun had remained unloaded,
  and he applied himself eagerly to repair this negligence, when he heard the
  dog in full cry, making swiftly in his direction. He threw himself upon the
  ground, where the fern was thickest; but this seemed insufficient to baffle
  the sagacity of the hound&mdash;the animal had got his scent, and was baying
  close at hand. The keepers were drawing nigh. Luke gave himself up for lost.
  The dog, however, stopped where the two poachers had halted, and was there
  completely at fault: snuffing the ground, he bayed, wheeled round, and then
  set off with renewed barking upon their track. Hugh Badger and his comrades
  loitered an instant at the same place, looked warily round, and then, as Luke
  conjectured, followed the course taken by the hound.</p>

  <p>Swift as thought, Luke arose, and keeping as much as possible under cover
  of the trees, started in a cross line for the lane. Rapid as was his flight,
  it was not without a witness: one of the keeper's assistants, who had lagged
  behind, gave the view-halloo in a loud voice. Luke pressed forward with
  redoubled energy, endeavoring to gain the shelter of the plantation, and this
  he could readily have accomplished, had no impediment been in his way. But
  his rage and vexation were boundless, when he heard the keeper's cry echoed
  by shouts immediately below him, and the tongue of the hound resounding in
  the hollow. He turned sharply round, steering a middle course, and still
  aiming at the fence. It was evident, from the cheers of his pursuers, that he
  was in full view, and he heard them encouraging and directing the dog.</p>

  <p>Luke had gained the park palings, along which he rushed, in the vain quest
  of some practicable point of egress, for the fence was higher in this part of
  the park than elsewhere, owing to the inequality of the ground. He had cast
  away his gun as useless. But even without that incumbrance, he dared not
  hazard the delay of climbing the palings. At this juncture a deep breathing
  was heard close behind him. He threw a glance over his shoulder. Within a few
  yards was a ferocious bloodhound, with whose savage nature Luke was well
  acquainted; the breed, some of which he had already seen, having been
  maintained at the hall ever since the days of grim old Sir Ranulph. The eyes
  of the hound were glaring, blood-red; his tongue was hanging out, and a row
  of keen white fangs was displayed, like the teeth of a shark. There was a
  growl&mdash;a leap&mdash;and the dog was close upon him.</p>

  <p>Luke's courage was undoubted. But his heart failed him as he heard the
  roar of the remorseless brute, and felt that he could not avoid an encounter
  with the animal. His resolution was instantly taken: he stopped short with
  such suddenness, that the dog, when in the act of springing, flew past him
  with great violence, and the time, momentary as it was, occupied by the
  animal in recovering himself, enabled Luke to drop on his knee, and to place
  one arm, like a buckler, before his face, while he held the other in
  readiness to grapple his adversary. Uttering a fierce yell, the hound
  returned to the charge, darting at Luke, who received the assault without
  flinching; and in spite of a severe laceration of the arm, he seized his foe
  by the throat, and hurling him upon the ground, jumped with all his force
  upon his belly. There was a yell of agony&mdash;the contest was ended, and
  Luke was at liberty to pursue his flight unmolested.</p>

  <p>Brief as had been the interval required for this combat, it had been
  sufficient to bring the pursuers within sight of the fugitive. Hugh Badger,
  who from the acclivity had witnessed the fate of his favorite, with a loud
  oath discharged the contents of his gun at the head of its destroyer. It was
  fortunate for Luke that at this instant he stumbled over the root of a
  tree&mdash;the shot rattled in the leaves as he fell, and the keeper,
  concluding that he had at least winged his bird, descended more leisurely
  towards him. As he lay upon the ground, Luke felt that he was wounded;
  whether by the teeth of the dog, from a stray shot, or from bruises inflicted
  by the fall, he could not determine. But, smarting with pain, he resolved to
  wreak his vengeance upon the first person who approached him. He vowed not to
  be taken with life&mdash;to strangle any who should lay hands upon him. At
  that moment he felt a pressure at his breast. It was the dead hand of his
  mother!</p>

  <p>Luke shuddered. The fire of revenge was quenched. He mentally cancelled
  his rash oath; yet he could not bring himself to surrender at discretion, and
  without further effort. The keeper and his assistants were approaching the
  spot where he lay, and searching for his body. Hugh Badger was foremost, and
  within a yard of him.</p>

  <p>"Confound the rascal!" cried Hugh, "he's not half killed; he seems to
  breathe."</p>

  <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth ere the speaker was dashed
  backwards, and lay sprawling upon the sod. Suddenly and unexpectedly, as an
  Indian chief might rush upon his foes, Luke arose, dashing himself with great
  violence against Hugh, who happened to stand in his way, and before the
  startled assistants, who were either too much taken by surprise, or unwilling
  to draw a trigger, could in any way lay hands upon him, exerting all the
  remarkable activity which he possessed, he caught hold of a projecting branch
  of a tree, and swung himself, at a single bound, fairly over the paling.</p>

  <p>Hugh Badger was shortly on his legs, swearing lustily at his defeat.
  Directing his men to skirt alongside the fence, and make for a particular
  part of the plantation which he named, and snatching a loaded fowling-piece
  from one of them, he clambered over the pales, and guided by the crashing
  branches and other sounds conveyed to his quick ear, he was speedily upon
  Luke's track.</p>

  <p>The plantation through which the chase now took place was not, as might be
  supposed, a continuation of the ring fence which Luke had originally crossed
  on his entrance into the park, though girded by the same line of paling, but,
  in reality, a close pheasant preserve, occupying the banks of a ravine,
  which, after a deep and tortuous course, terminated in the declivity
  heretofore described as forming the park boundary. Luke plunged into the
  heart of this defile, fighting his way downwards, in the direction of the
  brook. His progress was impeded by a thick undergrowth of brier, and other
  matted vegetation, as well as by the entanglements thrown in his way by the
  taller bushes of thorn and hazel, the entwined and elastic branches of which,
  in their recoil, galled and fretted him, by inflicting smart blows on his
  face and hands. This was a hardship he usually little regarded. But, upon the
  present occasion, it had the effect, by irritating his temper, of increasing
  the thirst of vengeance raging in his bosom.</p>

  <p>Through the depths of the ravine welled the shallow stream before alluded
  to, and Hugh Badger had no sooner reached its sedgy margin than he lost all
  trace of the fugitive. He looked cautiously round, listened intently, and
  inclined his ear to catch the faintest echo. All was still: not a branch
  shook, not a leaf rustled. Hugh looked aghast. He had made sure of getting a
  glimpse, and, perhaps, a stray shot at the "poaching rascal," as he termed
  him, "in the open space, which he was sure the fellow was aiming to reach;
  and now, all at once, he had disappeared, like a will-o'-the-wisp or a
  boggart of the clough." However, he could not be far off, and Hugh endeavored
  to obtain some clue to guide him in his quest. He was not long in detecting
  recent marks deeply indented in the mud on the opposite bank. Hugh leaped
  thither at once. Further on, some rushes were trodden down, and there were
  other indications of the course the fugitive had taken.</p>

  <p>"Hark forward!" shouted Hugh, in the joy of his heart at this discovery;
  and, like a well-trained dog, he followed up with alacrity the scent he had
  opened. The brook presented still fewer impediments to expedition than the
  thick copse, and the keeper pursued the wanderings of the petty current,
  occasionally splashing into the stream. Here and there, the print of a foot
  on the soil satisfied him he was in the right path. At length he became
  aware, from the crumbling soil, that the object of his pursuit had scaled the
  bank, and he forthwith moderated his pace. Halting, he perceived what he took
  to be a face peeping at him from behind a knot of alders that overhung the
  steep and shelving bank immediately above him. His gun was instantly at his
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Come down, you infernal deer-stealing scoundrel," cried Hugh, "or I'll
  blow you to shivers."</p>

  <p>No answer was returned: expostulation was vain; and, fearful of placing
  himself at a disadvantage if he attempted to scale the bank, Hugh fired
  without further parley. The sharp discharge rolled in echoes down the ravine,
  and a pheasant, scared by the sound, answered the challenge from a
  neighboring tree. Hugh was an unerring marksman, and on this occasion his aim
  had been steadily taken. The result was not precisely such as he had
  anticipated. A fur cap, shaken by the shot from the bough on which it hung,
  came rolling down the bank, proclaiming the <i>ruse</i> that had been
  practised upon the keeper. Little time was allowed him for reflection. Before
  he could reload, he felt himself collared by the iron arm of Luke.</p>

  <p>Hugh Badger was a man of great personal strength&mdash;square-set,
  bandy-legged, with a prodigious width of chest, and a frame like a Hercules,
  and, energetic as was Luke's assault, he maintained his ground without
  flinching. The struggle was desperate. Luke was of slighter proportion,
  though exceeding the keeper in stature by the head and shoulders. This
  superiority availed him little. It was rather a disadvantage in the conflict
  that ensued. The gripe fastened upon Hugh's throat was like that of a
  clenched vice. But Luke might as well have grappled the neck of a bull, as
  that of the stalwart keeper. Defending himself with his hobnail boots, with
  which he inflicted several severe blows upon Luke's shins, and struggling
  vehemently, Hugh succeeded in extricating himself from his throttling grasp;
  he then closed with his foe, and they were locked together, like a couple of
  bears at play. Straining, tugging, and practising every sleight and stratagem
  coming within the scope of feet, knees, and thighs&mdash;now tripping, now
  jerking, now advancing, now retreating, they continued the strife, but all
  with doubtful result. Victory, at length, seemed to declare itself in favor
  of the sturdy keeper. Aware of his opponent's strength, it was Luke's chief
  endeavor to keep his lower limbs disengaged, and to trust more to skill than
  force for ultimate success. To prevent this was Hugh's grand object. Guarding
  himself against every feint, he ultimately succeeded in firmly grappling his
  agile assailant. Luke's spine was almost broken by the shock, when he
  suddenly gave way; and, without losing his balance, drew his adversary
  forward, kicking his right leg from under him. With a crash like that of an
  uprooted oak, Hugh fell, with his foe upon him, into the bed of the
  rivulet.</p>

  <p>Not a word had been spoken during the conflict. A convulsive groan burst
  from Hugh's hardy breast. His hand sought his girdle, but in vain; his knife
  was gone. Gazing upwards, his dancing vision encountered the glimmer of the
  blade. The weapon had dropped from its case in the fall. Luke brandished it
  before his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Villain!" gasped Hugh, ineffectually struggling to free himself, "you
  will not murder me?" And his efforts to release himself became desperate.</p>

  <p>"No," answered Luke, flinging the uplifted knife into the brook. "I will
  not do <i>that</i>, though thou hast twice aimed at my life to-night. But I
  will silence thee, at all events." Saying which, he dealt the keeper a blow
  on the head that terminated all further resistance on his part.</p>

  <p>Leaving the inert mass to choke up the current, with whose waters the
  blood, oozing from the wound, began to commingle, Luke prepared to depart.
  His perils were not yet past. Guided by the firing, the report of which
  alarmed them, the keeper's assistants hastened in the direction of the sound,
  presenting themselves directly in the path Luke was about to take. He had
  either to retrace his steps, or face a double enemy. His election was made at
  once. He turned and fled.</p>

  <p>For an instant the men tarried with their bleeding companion. They then
  dragged him from the brook, and with loud oaths followed in pursuit.</p>

  <p>Threading, for a second time, the bosky labyrinth, Luke sought the source
  of the stream. This was precisely the course his enemies would have desired
  him to pursue; and when they beheld him take it, they felt confident of his
  capture.</p>

  <p>The sides of the hollow became more and more abrupt as they advanced,
  though they were less covered with brushwood. The fugitive made no attempt to
  climb the bank, but still pressed forward. The road was tortuous, and wound
  round a jutting point of rock. Now he was a fair mark&mdash;no, he had swept
  swiftly by, and was out of sight before a gun could be raised. They reached
  the same point. He was still before them, but his race was nearly run. Steep,
  slippery rocks, shelving down to the edges of a small, deep pool of water,
  the source of the stream, formed an apparently insurmountable barrier in that
  direction. Rooted&mdash;Heaven knows how!&mdash;in some reft or fissure of
  the rock, grew a wild ash, throwing out a few boughs over the solitary pool;
  this was all the support Luke could hope for, should he attempt to scale the
  rock. The rock was sheer&mdash;the pool deep&mdash;yet still he hurried on.
  He reached the muddy embankment; mounted its sides; and seemed to hesitate.
  The keepers were now within a hundred yards of him. Both guns were
  discharged. And, sudden as the reports, with a dead, splashless plunge, like
  a diving otter, the fugitive dropped into the water.</p>

  <p>The pursuers were at the brink. They gazed at the pool. A few bubbles
  floated upon its surface, and burst. The water was slightly discolored with
  sand. No ruddier stain crimsoned the tide; no figure rested on the naked
  rock; no hand clung to the motionless tree.</p>

  <p>"Devil take the rascal!" growled one; "I hope he harn't escaped us, arter
  all."</p>

  <p>"Noa, noa, he be fast enough, never fear," rejoined the other; "sticking
  like a snig at the bottom o' the pond; and, dang him! he deserves it, for
  he's slipped out of our fingers like a snig often enough to-night. But come,
  let's be stumping, and give poor Hugh Badger a helping hand."</p>

  <p>Whereupon they returned to the assistance of the wounded and discomfited
  keeper.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-4"
     name="ch1-4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE HALL</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:30%">I am right against my house&mdash;seat of my
     ancestors. &mdash; <i>Yorkshire Tragedy.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">ROOKWOOD PLACE was a fine, old, irregular pile, of
  considerable size, presenting a rich, picturesque outline, with its
  innumerable gable-ends, its fantastical coigns, and tall crest of twisted
  chimneys. There was no uniformity of style about the building, yet the
  general effect was pleasing and beautiful. Its very irregularity constituted
  a charm. Nothing except convenience had been consulted in its construction:
  additions had from time to time been made to it, but everything dropped into
  its proper place, and, without apparent effort or design, grew into an
  ornament, and heightened the beauty of the whole. It was, in short, one of
  those glorious manorial houses that sometimes unexpectedly greet us in our
  wanderings, and gladden us like the discovery of a hidden treasure. Some such
  ancestral hall we have occasionally encountered, in unlooked-for quarters, in
  our native county of Lancaster, or in its smiling sister shire; and never
  without feelings of intense delight, rejoicing to behold the freshness of its
  antiquity, and the greenness of its old age. For, be it observed in passing,
  a Cheshire or Lancashire hall, time-honored though it be, with its often
  renovated black and white squares, fancifully filled up with trefoils and
  quatrefoils, rosettes, and other figures, seems to bear its years so lightly,
  that its age, so far from detracting from its beauty, only lends it a grace;
  and the same mansion, to all outward appearance, fresh and perfect as it
  existed in the days of good Queen Bess, may be seen in admirable preservation
  in the days of the youthful Victoria. Such is Bramall&mdash;such Moreton, and
  many another we might instance; the former of these houses may, perhaps, be
  instanced as the best specimen of its class,&mdash;and its class in our
  opinion, <i>is</i> the best&mdash;to be met with in Cheshire, considered with
  reference either to the finished decoration of its exterior, rich in the
  chequered coloring we have alluded to, preserved with a care and neatness
  almost Dutch, or to the consistent taste exhibited by its possessor to the
  restoration and maintenance of all its original and truly national beauty
  within doors. As an illustration of old English hospitality&mdash;that real,
  hearty hospitality for which the squirearchy of this country was once so
  famous&mdash;Ah! why have they bartered it for other customs less
  substantially <i>English</i>?&mdash;it may be mentioned, that a road
  conducted the passenger directly through the great hall of this house,
  literally "of entertainment," where, if he listed, strong ale, and other
  refreshments, awaited his acceptance and courted his stay. Well might old
  King, the Cheshire historian, in the pride of his honest heart, exclaim,
  "<i>I know divers men, who are but farmers, that in their housekeeping may
  compare with a lord or baron, in some countries beyond the seas;&mdash;yea,
  although I named a higher degree, I were able to justify it.</i>" We have no
  such "golden farmers" in these degenerate days!</p>

  <p>The mansion, was originally built by Sir Ranulph de Rookwood&mdash;or, as
  it was then written, Rokewode&mdash;the first of the name, a stout Yorkist,
  who flourished in the reign of Edward IV., and received the fair domain and
  broad lands upon which the edifice was raised, from his sovereign, in reward
  for good service; retiring thither in the decline of life, at the close of
  the Wars of the Roses, to sequestrate himself from scenes of strife, and to
  consult his spiritual weal in the erection and endowment of the neighboring
  church. It was of mixed architecture, and combined the peculiarities of each
  successive era. Retaining some of the sterner features of earlier days, the
  period ere yet the embattled manor-house peculiar to the reigns of the later
  Henrys had been merged into the graceful and peaceable hall, the residence of
  the Rookwoods had early anticipated the gentler characteristics of a later
  day, though it could boast little of that exuberance of external ornament,
  luxuriance of design, and prodigality of beauty, which, under the sway of the
  Virgin Queen, distinguished the residence of the wealthier English landowner;
  and rendered the hall of Elizabeth, properly so called, the pride and boast
  of our domestic architecture.</p>

  <p>The site selected by Sir Ranulph for his habitation had been already
  occupied by a vast fabric of oak, which he in part removed, though some
  vestiges might still be traced of that ancient pile. A massive edifice
  succeeded, with gate and tower, court and moat complete; substantial enough,
  one would have thought, to have endured for centuries. But even this
  ponderous structure grew into disuse, and Sir Ranulph's successors,
  remodelling, repairing, almost rebuilding the whole mansion, in the end so
  metamorphosed its aspect, that at last little of its original and distinctive
  character remained. Still, as we said before, it was a fine old house, though
  some changes had taken place for the worse, which could not be readily
  pardoned by the eye of taste: as, for instance, the deep embayed windows had
  dwindled into modernized casements, of lighter construction; the wide porch,
  with its flight of steps leading to the great hall of entrance, had yielded
  to a narrow door; and the broad quadrangular court was succeeded by a gravel
  drive. Yet, despite all these changes, the house of the Rookwoods, for an old
  house&mdash;and, after all, what is like an old house?&mdash;was no
  undesirable or uncongenial abode for any worshipful country gentleman "who
  had a great estate."</p>

  <p>The hall was situated near the base of a gently declining hill,
  terminating a noble avenue of limes, and partially embosomed in an immemorial
  wood of the same timber, which had given its name to the family that dwelt
  amongst its rook-haunted shades. Descending the avenue, at the point of
  access afforded by a road that wound down the hill-side, towards a village
  distant about half a mile, as you advanced, the eye was first arrested by a
  singular octagonal turret of brick, of more recent construction than the
  house; and in all probability occupying the place where the gateway stood of
  yore. This tower rose to a height corresponding with the roof of the mansion;
  and was embellished on the side facing the house with a flamingly gilt dial,
  peering, like an impudent observer, at all that passed within doors. Two
  apartments, which it contained, were appropriated to the house-porter.
  Despoiled of its martial honors, the gateway still displayed the achievements
  of the family&mdash;the rook and the fatal branch&mdash;carved in granite,
  which had resisted the storms of two centuries, though stained green with
  moss, and mapped over with lichens. To the left, overgrown with ivy, and
  peeping from out a tuft of trees, appeared the hoary summit of a dovecot,
  indicating the near neighborhood of an ancient barn, contemporary with the
  earliest dwelling-house, and of a little world of offices and outbuildings
  buried in the thickness of the foliage. To the right was the garden&mdash;the
  pleasaunce of the place&mdash;formal, precise, old-fashioned, artificial, yet
  exquisite!&mdash;for commend us to the bygone, beautiful English
  garden&mdash;<i>really a garden</i>&mdash;not that mixture of park, meadow,
  and wilderness[3], brought up to one's very windows&mdash;which, since the
  days of the innovators, Kent, and his "bold associates," Capability Brown and
  Co., has obtained so largely&mdash;this <i>was</i> a garden! There might be
  seen the stately terraces, such as Watteau, and our own Wilson, in his
  earlier works, painted&mdash;the trim alleys exhibiting all the triumphs of
  topiarian art&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">The sidelong walls<br>
  Of shaven yew; the holly's prickly arms,<br>
  Trimm'd into high arcades; the tonsile box,<br>
  Wove in mosaic mode of many a curl,<br>
  Around the figured carpet of the lawn;[4]</p><br>

  <p>the gayest of parterres and greenest of lawns, with its admonitory
  sun-dial, its marble basin in the centre, its fountain, and conched
  water-god; the quaint summer-house, surmounted with its gilt vane; the
  statue, glimmering from out its covert of leaves; the cool cascade, the urns,
  the bowers, and a hundred luxuries besides, suggested and contrived by Art to
  render Nature most enjoyable, and to enhance the recreative delights of
  home-out-of-doors&mdash;for such a garden should be&mdash;, with least
  sacrifice of indoor comfort and convenience.</p>

  <p class="poem"><i>When Epicurus to the world had taught,<br>
  That pleasure was the chiefest good;<br>
  &mdash;And was perhaps i' th' right, if rightly understood,<br>
  His life he to his doctrine brought&mdash;<br>
  And in his garden's shade that sovereign pleasure sought.</i>[5]</p><br>

  <p>All these delights might once have been enjoyed. But at the time of which
  we write, this fair garden was for the most part a waste. Ill-kept, and
  unregarded, the gay parterres were disfigured with weeds; grass grew on the
  gravel walk; several of the urns were overthrown; the hour upon the dial was
  untold; the fountain was choked up, and the smooth-shaven lawn only rescued,
  it would seem, from the general fate, that it might answer the purpose of a
  bowling-green, as the implements of that game, scattered about, plainly
  testified.</p>

  <p>Diverging from the garden to the house, we have before remarked that the
  more ancient and characteristic features of the place had been, for the most
  part, destroyed; less by the hand of time than to suit the tastes of
  different proprietors. This, however, was not so observable in the eastern
  wing, which overlooked the garden. Here might be discerned many indications
  of its antiquity. The strength and solidity of the walls, which had not been,
  as elsewhere, masked with brickwork; the low, Tudor arches; the mullioned
  bars of the windows&mdash;all attested its age. This wing was occupied by an
  upper and lower gallery, communicating with suites of chambers, for the most
  part deserted, excepting one or two, which were used as dormitories; and
  another little room on the ground-floor, with an oriel window opening upon
  the lawn, and commanding the prospect beyond&mdash;a favorite resort of the
  late Sir Piers. The interior was curious for his honeycomb ceiling, deeply
  moulded in plaster, with the arms and alliances of the Rookwoods. In the
  centre was the royal blazon of Elizabeth, who had once honored the hall with
  a visit during a progress, and whose cipher E. R. was also displayed upon the
  immense plate of iron which formed the fire-grate.</p>

  <p>To return, for a moment, to the garden, which we linger about as a bee
  around a flower. Below the lawn there was another terrace, edged by a low
  balustrade of stone, commanding a lovely view of park, water, and woodland.
  High hanging-woods waved in the foreground, and an extensive sweep of flat
  champaign country stretched out to meet a line of blue, hazy hills bounding
  the distant horizon.</p>

  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Victor Hugo:</span> <i>Marie Tudor</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">FROM the house to its inhabitants the transition is natural.
  Besides the connexion between them, there were many points of resemblance;
  many family features in common; there was the same melancholy grandeur, the
  same character of romance, the same fantastical display. Nor were the secret
  passages, peculiar to the one, wanting to the history of the other. Both had
  their mysteries. One blot there was in the otherwise proud escutcheon of the
  Rookwoods, that dimmed its splendor, and made pale its pretensions: their sun
  was eclipsed in blood from its rising to its meridian; and so it seemed would
  be its setting. This foul reproach attached to all the race; none escaped it.
  Traditional rumors were handed down from father to son, throughout the
  county, and, like all other rumors, had taken to themselves wings, and flown
  abroad; their crimes became a by-word. How was it they escaped punishment?
  How came they to evade the hand of justice? Proof was ever wanting; justice
  was ever baffled. They were a stern and stiff-necked people, of indomitable
  pride and resolution, with, for the most part, force of character sufficient
  to enable them to breast difficulties and dangers that would have overwhelmed
  ordinary individuals. No quality is so advantageous to its possessor as
  firmness; and the determined energy of the Rookwoods bore them harmless
  through a sea of trouble. Besides, they were wealthy; lavish even to
  profusion; and gold will do much, if skilfully administered. Yet, despite all
  this, a dark, ominous cloud settled over their house, and men wondered when
  the vengeance of Heaven, so long delayed, would fall and consume it.</p>

  <p>Possessed of considerable landed property, once extending over nearly half
  the West Riding of Yorkshire, the family increased in power and importance
  for an uninterrupted series of years, until the outbreak of that intestine
  discord which ended in the civil wars, when the espousal of the royalist
  party, with sword and substance, by Sir Ralph Rookwood, the then lord of the
  mansion&mdash;a dissolute, depraved personage, who, however, had been made a
  Knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles I.&mdash;, ended in his own
  destruction at Naseby, and the wreck of much of his property; a loss which
  the gratitude of Charles II., on his restoration, did not fail to make good
  to Sir Ralph's youthful heir, Reginald.</p>

  <p>Sir Ralph Rookwood left two sons, Reginald and Alan. The fate of the
  latter was buried in obscurity. It was even a mystery to his family. He was,
  it was said, a youth of much promise, and of gentle manners; who, having made
  an imprudent match, from jealousy, or some other motive, deserted his wife,
  and fled his country. Various reasons were assigned for his conduct. Amongst
  others, it was stated that the object of Alan's jealous suspicions was his
  elder brother, Reginald; and that it was the discovery of his wife's
  infidelity in this quarter which occasioned his sudden disappearance with his
  infant daughter. Some said he died abroad. Others, that he had appeared again
  for a brief space at the hall. But all now concurred in a belief of his
  decease. Of his child nothing was known. His inconstant wife, after enduring
  for some years the agonies of remorse, abandoned by Sir Reginald, and
  neglected by her own relatives, put an end to her existence by poison. This
  is all that could be gathered of the story, or the misfortunes of Alan
  Rookwood.</p>

  <p>The young Sir Reginald had attended Charles, in the character of page,
  during his exile; and if he could not requite the devotion of the son, by
  absolutely reinstating the fallen fortunes of the father, the monarch could
  at least accord him the fostering influence of his favor and countenance; and
  bestow upon him certain lucrative situations in his household, as an earnest
  of his good-will. And thus much he did. Remarkable for his personal
  attractions in youth, it is not to be wondered at that we should find the
  name of Reginald Rookwood recorded in the scandalous chronicles of the day,
  as belonging to a cavalier of infinite address and discretion, matchless wit,
  and marvellous pleasantry; and eminent beyond his peers for his successes
  with some of the most distinguished beauties who ornamented that brilliant
  and voluptuous court.</p>

  <p>A career of elegant dissipation ended in matrimony. His first match was
  unpropitious. Foiled in his attempts upon the chastity of a lady of great
  beauty and high honor, he was rash enough to marry her; rash, we say, for
  from that fatal hour all became as darkness; the curtain fell upon the comedy
  of his life, to rise to tragic horrors. When, passion subsided, repentance
  awoke, and he became anxious for deliverance from the fetters he had so
  heedlessly imposed on himself, and on his unfortunate dame.</p>

  <p>The hapless lady of Sir Reginald was a fair and fragile creature, floating
  on the eddying current of existence, and hurried in destruction as the summer
  gossamer is swept away by the rude breeze, and lost forever. So beautiful, so
  gentle was she, that if,</p>

  <p class="poem">Sorrow had not made<br>
  Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self,</p>

  <p class="first">it would have been difficult to say whether the charm of
  softness and sweetness was more to be admired than her faultless personal
  attractions. But when a tinge of melancholy came, saddening and shading the
  once smooth and smiling brow; when tears dimmed the blue beauty of those deep
  and tender eyes; when hot, hectic flushes supplied the place of healthful
  bloom, and despair took possession of her heart, then was it seen
  <i>what</i>was the charm of Lady Rookwood, if charm that could be called
  which was a saddening sight to see, and melted the beholder's soul within
  him. All acknowledged, that exquisite as she had been before, the sad, sweet
  lady was now more exquisite still.</p>

  <p>Seven moons had waned and flown&mdash;seven bitter, tearful
  moons&mdash;and each day Lady Rookwood's situation claimed more soothing
  attention at the hand of her lord. About this time his wife's brother, whom
  he hated, returned from the Dutch wars. Struck with his sister's altered
  appearance, he readily divined the cause; indeed, all tongues were eager to
  proclaim it to him. Passionately attached to her, Lionel Vavasour implored an
  explanation of the cause of his sister's griefs. The bewildered lady answered
  evasively, attributing her woe-begone looks to any other cause than her
  husband's cruelty; and pressing her brother, as he valued her peace, her
  affection, never to allude to the subject again. The fiery youth departed. He
  next sought out his brother-in-law, and taxed him sharply with his
  inhumanity, adding threats to his upbraidings. Sir Reginald listened silently
  and calmly. When the other had finished, with a sarcastic obeisance, he
  replied: "Sir, I am much beholden for the trouble you have taken in your
  sister's behalf. But when she entrusted herself to my keeping, she
  relinquished, I conceive, all claim on <i>your</i> guardianship: however, I
  thank you for the trouble you have taken; but, for your own sake, I would
  venture to caution you against a repetition of interference like the
  present."</p>

  <p>"And I, sir, caution <i>you</i>. See that you give heed to my words, or,
  by the heaven above us! I will enforce attention to them."</p>

  <p>"You will find me, sir, as prompt at all times to defend my conduct, as I
  am unalterable in my purposes. Your sister is my wife. What more would you
  have? Were she a harlot, you should have her back and welcome. The tool is
  virtuous. Devise some scheme, and take her with you hence&mdash;so you rid
  <i>me</i> of her I am content."</p>

  <p>"Rookwood, you are a villain." And Vavasour spat upon his brother's
  cheek.</p>

  <p>Sir Reginald's eyes blazed. His sword started from its scabbard. "Defend
  yourself!" he exclaimed, furiously attacking Vavasour. Pass after pass was
  exchanged. Fierce thrusts were made and parried. Feint and appeal, the most
  desperate and dexterous, were resorted to. Their swords glanced like
  lightning flashes. In the struggle, the blades became entangled. There was a
  moment's cessation. Each glanced at the other with deadly, inextinguishable
  hate. Both were admirable masters of the art of defence. Both were so brimful
  of wrath as to be regardless of consequences. They tore back their weapons.
  Vavasour's blade shivered. He was at the mercy of his adversary&mdash;an
  adversary who knew no mercy. Sir Reginald passed his rapier through his
  brother's body. The hilt struck against his ribs.</p>

  <p>Sir Reginald's ire was kindled, not extinguished, by the deed he had done.
  Like the tiger, he had tasted blood&mdash;like the tiger, he thirsted for
  more. He sought his home. He was greeted by his wife. Terrified by his looks,
  she yet summoned courage sufficient to approach him. She embraced his
  arm&mdash;she clasped his hand. Sir Reginald smiled. His smile was cutting as
  his dagger's edge.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, sweetheart?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I know not; your smile frightens me."</p>

  <p>"My smile frightens you&mdash;fool! be thankful that I frown not."</p>

  <p>"Oh! do not frown. Be gentle, my Reginald, as you were when first I knew
  you. Smile not so coldly, but as you did then, that I may, for one instant,
  dream you love me."</p>

  <p>"Silly wench! There&mdash;I <i>do</i> smile."</p>

  <p>"That smile freezes me. Oh, Reginald, could you but know what I have
  endured this morning, on your account. My brother Lionel has been here."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Nay, look not so. He insisted on knowing the reason of my altered
  appearance."</p>

  <p>"And no doubt you made him acquainted with the cause. You told him
  <i>your</i> version of the story."</p>

  <p>"Not a word, as I hope to live."</p>

  <p>"A lie!"</p>

  <p>"By my truth, no."</p>

  <p>"A lie, I say. He avouched it to me himself."</p>

  <p>"Impossible! He could not&mdash;would not disobey me."</p>

  <p>Sir Reginald laughed bitterly.</p>

  <p>"He would not, I am sure, give utterance to any scandal," continued Lady
  Rookwood. "You say this but to try me, do you not?&mdash;ha! what is this?
  Your hand is bloody. You have not harmed him? Whose blood is this?"</p>

  <p>"Your brother spat upon my check. I have washed out the stain," replied
  Sir Reginald, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Then it <i>is</i> his blood!" shrieked Lady Rookwood, pressing her hand
  shuddering before her eyes. "Is he dead?"</p>

  <p>Sir Reginald turned away.</p>

  <p>"Stay," she cried, exerting her feeble strength to retain him, and
  becoming white as ashes, "abide and hear me. You have killed me, I feel, by
  your cruelty. I am sinking fast&mdash;dying. I, who loved you, only you; yes,
  one besides&mdash;my brother, and you have slain <i>him</i>. Your hands are
  dripping in his blood, and I have kissed them&mdash;have clasped them! And
  now," continued she, with an energy that shook Sir Reginald, "I hate
  you&mdash;I renounce you&mdash;forever! May my dying words ring in your ears
  on your death-bed, for that hour <i>will</i> come. You cannot shun
  <i>that</i>. Then think of <i>him</i>! think of <i>me</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Away!" interrupted Sir Reginald, endeavoring to shake her off.</p>

  <p>"I will <i>not</i> away! I will cling to you&mdash;will curse you. My
  unborn child shall live to curse you&mdash;to requite you&mdash;to visit my
  wrongs on you and yours. Weak as I am, you shall not cast me off. You shall
  learn to fear even <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>"I fear nothing living, much less a frantic woman."</p>

  <p>"Fear the <i>dead</i>, then."</p>

  <p>There was a struggle&mdash;a blow&mdash;and the wretched lady sank,
  shrieking, upon the floor. Convulsions seized her. A mother's pains succeeded
  fierce and fast. She spoke no more, but died within the hour, giving birth to
  a female child.</p>

  <p>Eleanor Rookwood became her father's idol&mdash;her father's bane. All the
  love he had to bestow was centred in her. She returned it not. She fled from
  his caresses. With all her mother's beauty, she had all her father's pride.
  Sir Reginald's every thought was for his daughter&mdash;for her
  aggrandizement. In vain. She seemed only to endure him, and while his
  affection waxed stronger, and entwined itself round her alone, she withered
  beneath his embraces as the shrub withers in the clasping folds of the
  parasite plant.</p>

  <p>She grew towards womanhood. Suitors thronged around her&mdash;gentle and
  noble ones. Sir Reginald watched them with a jealous eye. He was wealthy,
  powerful, high in royal favor; and could make his own election. He did so.
  For the first time, Eleanor promised obedience to his wishes. They accorded
  with her own humor. The day was appointed. It came. But with it came not the
  bride. She had fled, with the humblest and the meanest of the pretenders to
  her hand&mdash;with one upon whom Sir Reginald supposed she had not deigned
  to cast her eyes. He endeavored to forget her, and, to all outward seeming,
  was successful in the effort. But he felt that the curse was upon him; the
  undying flame scorched his heart.</p>

  <p>Once, and once only, they met again, in France, whither she had wandered.
  It was a dread encounter&mdash;terrible to both; but most so to Sir Reginald.
  He spoke not of her afterwards.</p>

  <p>Shortly after the death of his first wife, Sir Reginald had made proposals
  to a dowager of distinction, with a handsome jointure, one of his early
  attachments, and was, without scruple, accepted. The power of the family
  might then be said to be at its zenith; and but for certain untoward
  circumstances, and the growing influence of his enemies, Sir Reginald would
  have been elevated to the peerage. Like most reformed spend-thrifts, he had
  become proportionately avaricious, and his mind seemed engrossed in
  accumulating wealth. In the meantime, his second wife followed her
  predecessor, dying, it was said, of vexation and disappointment.</p>

  <p>The propensity to matrimony, always a distinguishing characteristic of the
  Rookwoods, largely displayed itself in Sir Reginald. Another dame
  followed&mdash;equally rich, younger, and far more beautiful than her
  immediate predecessor. She was a prodigious flirt, and soon set her husband
  at defiance. Sir Reginald did not condescend to expostulate. It was not his
  way. He effectually prevented any recurrence of her indiscretions. She was
  removed, and with her expired Sir Reginald's waning popularity. So strong was
  the expression of odium against him, that he thought it prudent to retire to
  his mansion, in the country, and there altogether seclude himself. One
  anomaly in Sir Reginald's otherwise utterly selfish character was
  uncompromising devotion to the house of Stuart; and shortly after the
  abdication of James II., he followed that monarch to Saint Germain, having
  previously mixed largely in secret political intrigues; and only returned
  from the French court to lay his bones with those of his ancestry, in the
  family vault at Rookwood.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-6"

  <p class="quote">My old master kept a good house, and twenty or thirty tall
  sword-and-buckler men about him; and in faith his son differs not much; he
  will have metal too; though he has no store of cutler's blades, he will have
  plenty of vintners' pots. His father kept a good house for honest men, his
  tenants that brought him in part; and his son keeps a bad house with knaves
  that help to consume all: 'tis but the change of time: why should any man
  repine at it? Crickets, good, loving, and lucky worms, were wont to feed,
  sing, and rejoice in the father's chimney; and now carrion crows build in the
  son's kitchen. &mdash; <span class="smcap">Wilkins:</span> <i>Miseries of
  Enforced Marriage</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SIR REGINALD died, leaving issue three children: a daughter,
  the before-mentioned Eleanor&mdash;who, entirely discountenanced by the
  family, had been seemingly forgotten by all but her father&mdash;, and two
  sons by his third wife. Reginald, the eldest, whose military taste had early
  procured him the command of a company of horse, and whose politics did not
  coalesce with those of his sire, fell, during his father's lifetime, at
  Killiecrankie, under the banners of William. Piers, therefore, the second
  son, succeeded to the title.</p>

  <p>A very different character, in many respects, from his father and brother,
  holding in supreme dislike courts and courtiers, party warfare, political
  intrigue, and all the subtleties of Jesuitical diplomacy, neither having any
  inordinate relish for camps or campaigns, Sir Piers Rookwood yet displayed in
  early life one family propensity, viz., unremitting devotion to the sex.
  Among his other mistresses was the unfortunate Susan Bradley, in whom by some
  he was supposed to have been clandestinely united. In early youth, as has
  been stated, Sir Piers professed the faith of Rome, but shortly after the
  death of his beautiful mistress&mdash;or wife, as it might be&mdash;, having
  quarreled with his father's confessor, Checkley, he publicly abjured his
  heresies. Sir Piers subsequently allied himself to Maud, only daughter of Sir
  Thomas D'Aubeny, the last of a line as proud and intolerant as his own. The
  tables were then turned. Lady Rookwood usurped sovereign sway over her lord
  and Sir Piers, a cipher in his own house, scarce master of himself, much less
  of his dame, endured an existence so miserable, that he was often heard to
  regret, in his cups, that he had not inherited, with the estate of his
  forefathers, the family secret of shaking off the matrimonial yoke, when
  found to press too hardly.</p>

  <p>At the onset, Sir Piers struggled hard to burst his bondage. But in
  vain&mdash;he was fast fettered; and only bruised himself, like the caged
  lark, against the bars of his prison-house. Abandoning all further effort at
  emancipation, he gave himself up to the usual resource of a weak mind,
  debauchery; and drank so deeply to drown his cares, that, in the end, his
  hale constitution yielded to his excesses. It was even said, that remorse at
  his abandonment of the faith of his fathers had some share in his misery; and
  that his old spiritual, and if report spoke truly, sinful adviser, Father
  Checkley, had visited him secretly at the hall. Sir Piers was observed to
  shudder whenever the priest's name was mentioned.</p>

  <p>Sir Piers Rookwood was a good-humored man in the main, had little of the
  old family leaven about him, and was esteemed by his associates. Of late,
  however, his temper became soured, and his friends deserted him; for, between
  his domestic annoyances, remorseful feelings, and the inroads already made
  upon his constitution by constant inebriety, he grew so desperate and insane
  in his revels, and committed such fearful extravagances, that even his boon
  companions shrank from his orgies. Fearful were the scenes between him and
  Lady Rookwood upon these occasions&mdash;appalling to the witnesses, dreadful
  to themselves. And it was, perhaps, their frequent recurrence, that, more
  than anything else, banished all decent society from the hall.</p>

  <p>At the time of Sir Piers's decease, which brings us down to the date of
  our story, his son and successor, Ranulph, was absent on his travels. Shortly
  after the completion of his academical education, he had departed to make the
  tour of the Continent, and had been absent rather better than a year. He had
  quitted his father in displeasure, and was destined never again to see his
  face while living. The last intelligence received of young Rookwood was from
  Bordeaux, whence it was thought he had departed for the Pyrenees. A special
  messenger had been despatched in search of him, with tidings of the
  melancholy event. But, as it was deemed improbable by Lady Rookwood that her
  son could return within any reasonable space, she gave directions for the
  accomplishment of the funeral rites of her husband on the sixth night after
  his decease&mdash;it being the custom of the Rookwoods ever to inter their
  dead at midnight,&mdash;intrusting their solemnization entirely to the care
  of one of Sir Piers's hangers-on&mdash;Dr. Titus Tyrconnel,&mdash;for which
  she was greatly scandalized in the neighborhood.</p>

  <p>Ranulph Rookwood was a youth of goodly promise. The stock from which he
  sprang would on neither side warrant such conclusion. But it sometimes
  happens that from the darkest elements are compounded the brightest and
  subtlest substances; and so it occurred in this instance. Fair, frank, and
  free&mdash;generous, open, unsuspicious&mdash;he seemed the very opposite of
  all his race&mdash;their antagonizing principle. Capriciously indulgent, his
  father had allowed him ample means, neither curbing nor restraining his
  expenditure; acceding at one moment to every inclination, and the next
  irresolutely opposing it. It was impossible, therefore, for him, in such a
  state of things, to act decidedly, without incurring his father's
  displeasure; and the only measure he resolved upon, which was to absent
  himself for a time, was conjectured to have brought about the result he had
  endeavored to avoid. Other reasons, however, there were, which secretly
  influenced him, which it will be our business in due time to detail.</p>

  <p class="first">THE time of the sad ceremonial drew nigh. The hurrying of
  the domestics to and fro; the multifarious arrangements for the night; the
  distribution of the melancholy trappings, and the discussion of the
  "funeral-baked meats," furnished abundant occupation within doors. Without,
  there was a constant stream of the tenantry, thronging down the avenue, mixed
  with an occasional horseman, once or twice intercepted by a large lumbering
  carriage, bringing friends of the deceased, some really anxious to pay the
  last tribute of regard, but the majority attracted by the anticipated
  spectacle of a funeral by torchlight. There were others, indeed, to whom it
  was not matter of choice; who were compelled, by a vassal tenure of their
  lands, held of the house of Rookwood, to lend a shoulder to the coffin, and a
  hand to the torch, on the burial of its lord. Of these there was a plentiful
  muster collected in the hall; they were to be marshalled by Peter Bradley,
  who was deemed to be well skilled in the proceedings, having been present at
  two solemnities of the kind. That mysterious personage, however, had not made
  his appearance&mdash;to the great dismay of the assemblage. Scouts were sent
  in search of him, but they returned with the intelligence that the door of
  his habitation was fastened, and its inmate apparently absent. No other
  tidings of the truant sexton could be obtained.</p>

  <p>It was a sultry August evening. No breeze was stirring in the garden; no
  cool dews refreshed the parched and heated earth; yet from the languishing
  flowers rich sweets exhaled. The plash of a fountain fell pleasantly upon the
  ear, conveying in its sound a sense of freshness to the fervid air; while
  deep and drowsy murmurs hummed heavily beneath the trees, making the twilight
  slumberously musical. The westering sun, which filled the atmosphere with
  flame throughout the day, was now wildly setting; and, as he sank behind the
  hall, its varied and picturesque tracery became each instant more darkly and
  distinctly defined against the crimson sky.</p>

  <p>At this juncture a little gate, communicating with the chase, was thrown
  open, and a young man entered the garden, passing through the shrubbery, and
  hurrying rapidly forward till he arrived at a vista opening upon the house.
  The spot at which the stranger halted was marked by a little basin, scantily
  supplied with water, streaming from a lion's kingly jaws. His dress was
  travel-soiled, and dusty; and his whole appearance betokened great exhaustion
  from heat and fatigue. Seating himself upon an adjoining bench, he threw off
  his riding-cap, and unclasped his collar, displaying a finely-turned head and
  neck; and a countenance which, besides its beauty, had that rare nobility of
  feature which seldom falls to the lot of the aristocrat, but is never seen in
  one of an inferior order. A restless disquietude of manner showed that he was
  suffering from over-excitement of mind, as well as from bodily exertion. His
  look was wild and hurried; his black ringlets were dashed heedlessly over a
  pallid, lofty brow, upon which care was prematurely written; while his large
  melancholy eyes were bent, with a look almost of agony, upon the house before
  him.</p>

  <p>After a short pause, and as if struggling against violent emotions, and
  some overwhelming remembrance, the youth arose, and plunged his hand into the
  basin, applying the moist element to his burning brow. Apparently becoming
  more calm, he bent his steps towards the hall, when two figures, suddenly
  issuing from an adjoining copse, arrested his progress; neither saw him.
  Muttering a hurried farewell, one of the figures disappeared within the
  shrubbery, and the other, confronting the stranger, displayed the harsh
  features and gaunt form of Peter Bradley. Had Peter encountered the dead Sir
  Piers in corporeal form, he could not have manifested more surprise than he
  exhibited, for an instant or two, as he shrunk back from the stranger's
  path.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1-8"
     name="ch1-8"></a>CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; AN IRISH ADVENTURER</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Scapin.</i> A most outrageous, roaring fellow, with a
  swelled red face inflamed with brandy.<br>
  &mdash;<i>Cheats of Scapin.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">AN hour or two prior to the incident just narrated, in a
  small, cosy apartment of the hall, nominally devoted to justiciary business
  by its late owner, but, in reality, used as a sanctum, snuggery, or
  smoking-room, a singular trio were assembled, fraught with the ulterior
  purpose of attending the obsequies of their deceased patron and friend,
  though immediately occupied in the discussion of a magnum of excellent
  claret, the bouquet of which perfumed the air, like the fragrance of a bed of
  violets.</p>

  <p>This little room had been poor Sir Piers's favorite retreat. It was, in
  fact, the only room in the house that he could call his own; and thither
  would he often, with pipe and punch, beguile the flagging hours, secure from
  interruption. A snug, old-fashioned apartment it was; wainscoted with rich
  black oak; with a fine old cabinet of the same material, and a line or two of
  crazy, worm-eaten bookshelves, laden with sundry dusty, unconsulted law
  tomes, and a light sprinkling of the elder divines, equally neglected. The
  only book, indeed, Sir Piers ever read, was the "Anatomie of Melancholy;" and
  he merely studied Burton because the quaint, racy style of the learned old
  hypochondriac suited his humor at seasons, and gave a zest to his sorrows,
  such as the olives lent to his wine.</p>

  <p>Four portraits adorned the walls: those of Sir Reginald Rookwood and his
  wives. The ladies were attired in the flowing drapery of Charles the Second's
  day, the snow of their radiant bosoms being somewhat sullied by
  over-exposure, and the vermeil tinting of their cheeks darkened by the fumes
  of tobacco. There was a shepherdess, with her taper crook, whose large,
  languishing eyes, ripe pouting lips, ready to melt into kisses, and air of
  voluptuous abandonment, scarcely suited the innocent simplicity of her
  costume. She was portrayed tending a flock of downy sheep, with azure ribbons
  round their necks, accompanied by one of those invaluable little dogs whose
  length of ear and silkiness of skin evinced him perfect in his breeding, but
  whose large-eyed indifference to his charge proved him to be as much out of
  character with his situation as the refined and luxuriant charms of his
  mistress were out of keeping with her artless attire. This was Sir Piers's
  mother, the third wife, a beautiful woman, answering to the notion of one who
  had been somewhat of a flirt in her day. Next to her was a magnificent dame,
  with the throat and arm of a Juno, and a superb bust&mdash;the bust was then
  what the bustle is now&mdash;a paramount attraction; whether the modification
  be an improvement, we leave to the consideration of the lovers of the
  beautiful&mdash;this was the dowager. Lastly, there was the lovely and
  ill-fated Eleanor. Every gentle grace belonging to this unfortunate lady had
  been stamped in undying beauty on the canvas by the hand of Lely, breathing a
  spell on the picture, almost as powerful as that which had dwelt around the
  exquisite original. Over the high carved mantelpiece was suspended the
  portrait of Sir Reginald. It had been painted in early youth; the features
  were beautiful, disdainful,&mdash;with a fierceness breaking through the
  courtly air. The eyes were very fine, black as midnight, and piercing as
  those of Cæsar Borgia, as seen in Raphael's wonderful picture in the Borghese
  Palace at Rome. They seemed to fascinate the gazer&mdash;to rivet his
  glances&mdash;to follow him whithersoever he went&mdash;and to search into
  his soul, as did the dark orbs of Sir Reginald in his lifetime. It was the
  work likewise of Lely, and had all the fidelity and graceful refinement of
  that great master; nor was the haughty countenance of Sir Reginald unworthy
  the patrician painter.</p>

  <p>No portrait of Sir Piers was to be met with. But in lieu thereof,
  depending from a pair of buck's horns, hung the worthy knight's stained
  scarlet coat&mdash;the same in which he had ridden forth, with the intent to
  hunt, on the eventful occasion detailed by Peter Bradley,&mdash;his velvet
  cap, his buck-handled whip, and the residue of his equipment for the chase.
  This attire was reviewed with melancholy interest and unaffected emotion by
  the company, as reminding them forcibly of the departed, of which it seemed a
  portion.</p>

  <p>The party consisted of the vicar of Rookwood, Dr. Polycarp Small; Dr.
  Titus Tyrconnel, an emigrant, and empirical professor of medicine, from the
  sister isle, whose convivial habits had first introduced him to the hall, and
  afterwards retained him there; and Mr. Codicil Coates, clerk of the peace,
  attorney-at-law, bailiff, and receiver. We were wrong in saying that
  Tyrconnel was retained. He was an impudent, intrusive fellow, whom, having
  once gained a footing in the house, it was impossible to dislodge. He cared
  for no insult; perceived no slight; and professed, in her presence, the
  profoundest respect for Lady Rookwood: in short, he was ever ready to do
  anything but depart.</p>

  <p>Sir Piers was one of those people who cannot dine alone. He disliked a
  solitary repast almost as much as a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with his lady. He
  would have been recognized at once as the true Amphitryon, had any one been
  hardy enough to play the part of Jupiter. Ever ready to give a dinner, he
  found a difficulty arise, not usually experienced on such
  occasions&mdash;there was no one upon whom to bestow it. He had the best of
  wine; kept an excellent table; was himself no niggard host; but his own
  merits, and those of his <i>cuisine</i>, were forgotten in the invariable
  <i>pendant</i> to the feast; and the best of wine lost its flavor when the
  last bottle found its way to the guest's head. Dine alone Sir Piers would
  not. And as his old friends forsook him, he plunged lower in his search of
  society; collecting within his house a class of persons whom no one would
  have expected to meet at the hall, nor even its owner have chosen for his
  companions, had any choice remained to him. He did not endure this state of
  things without much outward show of discontent. "Anything for a quiet life,"
  was his constant saying; and, like the generality of people with whom those
  words form a favorite maxim, he led the most uneasy life imaginable.
  Endurance, to excite commiseration, must be uncomplaining&mdash;an axiom the
  aggrieved of the gentle sex should remember. Sir Piers endured, but he
  grumbled lustily, and was on all hands voted a bore; domestic grievances,
  especially if the husband be the plaintiff, being the most intolerable of all
  mentionable miseries. No wonder that his friends deserted him; still there
  was Titus Tyrconnel; his ears and lips were ever open to pathos and to punch;
  so Titus kept his station. Immediately after her husband's demise, it had
  been Lady Rookwood's intention to clear the house of all the "vermin," so she
  expressed herself, that had so long infested it; and forcibly to eject Titus,
  and one or two other intruders of the same class. But in consequence of
  certain hints received from Mr. Coates, who represented the absolute
  necessity of complying with Sir Piers's testamentary instructions, which were
  particular in that respect, she thought proper to defer her intentions until
  after the ceremonial of interment should be completed, and, in the mean time,
  strange to say, committed its arrangement to Titus Tyrconnel; who, ever ready
  to accommodate, accepted, nothing loth, the charge, and acquitted himself
  admirably well in his undertaking: especially, as he said, "in the aiting and
  drinking department&mdash;the most essential part of it all." He kept open
  house&mdash;open dining-room&mdash;open cellar; resolved that his patron's
  funeral should emulate as much as possible an Irish burial on a grand scale,
  "the finest sight," in his opinion, "in the whole world."</p>

  <p>Inflated with the importance of his office, inflamed with heat, sat Titus,
  like a "robustious periwig-pated" alderman after a civic feast. The natural
  rubicundity of his countenance was darkened to a deep purple tint, like that
  of a full-blown peony, while his ludicrous dignity was augmented by a shining
  suit of sables, in which his portly person was invested.</p>

  <p>The first magnum had been discussed in solemn silence; the cloud, however,
  which hung over the conclave, disappeared under the genial influence of
  "another and a better" bottle, and gave place to a denser vapor, occasioned
  by the introduction of the pipe and its accompaniments.</p>

  <p>Ensconced in a comfortable old chair&mdash;it is not every old chair that
  <i>is</i> comfortable,&mdash;with pipe in mouth, and in full unbuttoned ease,
  his bushy cauliflower wig laid aside, by reason of the heat, reposed Dr.
  Small. Small, indeed, was somewhat of a misnomer, as applied to the worthy
  doctor, who, besides being no diminutive specimen of his kind, entertained no
  insignificant opinion of himself. His height was certainly not remarkable;
  but his width of shoulder&mdash;his sesquipedality of stomach&mdash;and
  obesity of calf&mdash;these were unique! Of his origin we know nothing; but
  presume he must, in some way or other, have been connected with the numerous
  family of "the Smalls," who, according to Christopher North, form the
  predominant portion of mankind. In appearance, the doctor was short-necked
  and puffy, with a sodden, pasty face, wherein were set eyes whose obliquity
  of vision was, in some measure, redeemed by their expression of humor. He was
  accounted a man of parts and erudition, and had obtained high honors at his
  university. Rigidly orthodox, he abominated the very names of Papists and
  Jacobites, amongst which heretical herd he classed his companion, Mr. Titus
  Tyrconnel&mdash;Ireland being with him synonymous with superstition and
  Catholicism&mdash;and every Irishman rebellious and schismatical. On this
  head he was inclined to be disputatious. His prejudices did not prevent him
  from passing the claret, nor from laughing, as heartily as a plethoric asthma
  and sense of the decorum due to the occasion would permit, at the quips and
  quirks of the Irishman, who, he admitted, notwithstanding his heresies, was a
  pleasant fellow in the main. And when, in addition to the flattery, a pipe
  had been insinuated by the officious Titus, at the precise moment that Small
  yearned for his afternoon's solace, yet scrupled to ask for it; when the door
  had been made fast, and the first whiff exhaled, all his misgivings vanished,
  and he surrendered himself to the soft seduction. In this Elysian state we
  find him.</p>

  <p>"Ah! you may say that, Dr. Small," said Titus, in answer to some
  observation of the vicar, "that's a most original apothegm. We all of us
  hould our lives by a thrid. Och! many's the sudden finale I have seen. Many's
  the fine fellow's heels tripped up unawares, when least expected. Death hangs
  over our heads by a single hair, as your reverence says, precisely like the
  sword of Dan Maclise,[6] the flatterer of Dinnish what-do-you-call-him, ready
  to fall at a moment's notice, or no notice at all&mdash;eh?&mdash;Mr. Coates.
  And that brings me back again to Sir Piers&mdash;poor gentleman&mdash;ah! we
  sha'n't soon see the like of him again!"</p>

  <p>"Poor Sir Piers!" said Mr. Coates, a small man, in a scratch wig, with a
  face red and round as an apple, and almost as diminutive. "It is to be
  regretted that his over-conviviality should so much have hastened his
  lamented demise."</p>

  <p>"Conviviality!" replied Titus; "no such thing&mdash;it was
  apoplexy&mdash;extravasation of <i>sarum</i>."</p>

  <p>"Extra vase-ation of rum and water, you mean," replied Coates, who, like
  all his tribe, rejoiced in a quibble.</p>

  <p>"The squire's ailment," continued Titus, "was a sanguineous effusion, as
  we call it&mdash;positive determination of blood to the head, occasioned by a
  low way he got into, just before his attack&mdash;a confirmed case of
  hypochondriasis, as that <i>ould</i> book Sir Piers was so fond of terms the
  blue devils. He neglected the bottle, which, in a man who has been a hard
  drinker all his life, is a bad sign. The lowering system never
  answers&mdash;never. Doctor, I'll just trouble you"&mdash;for Small, in a fit
  of absence, had omitted to pass the bottle, though not to help himself. "Had
  he stuck to <i>this</i>"&mdash;holding up a glass, ruby bright&mdash;"the
  elixir vitæ&mdash;the grand panacea&mdash;he might have been hale and hearty
  at this present moment, and as well as any of us. But he wouldn't be advised.
  To my thinking, as that was the case, he'd have been all the better for a
  little of your reverence's sperretual advice; and his conscience having been
  relieved by confession and absolution, he might have opened a fresh account
  with an aisy heart and clane breast."</p>

  <p>"I trust, sir," said Small, gravely withdrawing his pipe from his lips,
  "that Sir Piers Rookwood addressed himself to a higher source than a sinning
  creature of clay like himself for remission of his sins; but, if there was
  any load of secret guilt that might have weighed heavy upon his conscience,
  it is to be regretted that he refused the last offices of the church, and
  died incommunicate. I was denied all admittance to his chamber."</p>

  <p>"Exactly my case," said Mr. Coates, pettishly. "I was refused entrance,
  though my business was of the utmost importance&mdash;certain
  dispositions&mdash;special bequests&mdash;matter connected with his
  sister&mdash;for though the estate is entailed, yet still there are
  charges&mdash;you understand me&mdash;very strange to refuse to see
  <i>me</i>. Some people may regret it&mdash;may live to regret it, I
  say&mdash;that's all. I've just sent up a package to Lady Rookwood, which was
  not to be delivered till after Sir Piers's death. Odd circumstance
  that&mdash;been in my custody a long while&mdash;some reason to think Sir
  Piers meant to alter his will&mdash;ought to have seen <i>me</i>&mdash;sad
  neglect!"</p>

  <p>"More's the pity. But it was none of poor Sir Piers's doing!" replied
  Titus; "he had no will of his own, poor fellow, during his life, and the
  devil a will was he likely to have after his death. It was all Lady
  Rookwood's doing," added he, in a whisper. "I, his medical adviser and
  confidential friend, was ordered out of the room; and, although I knew it was
  as much as his life was worth to leave him for a moment in that state, I was
  forced to comply: and, would you believe it, as I left the room, I heard high
  words. Yes, doctor, as I hope to be saved, words of anger from her at that
  awful juncture."</p>

  <p>The latter part of this speech was uttered in a low tone, and very
  mysterious manner. The speakers drew so closely together, that the bowls of
  their pipes formed a common centre, whence the stems radiated. A momentary
  silence ensued, during which each man puffed for very life. Small next
  knocked the ashes from his tube, and began to replenish it, coughing
  significantly. Mr. Coates expelled a thin, curling stream of vapor from a
  minute orifice in the corner of his almost invisible mouth, and arched his
  eyebrows in a singular manner, as if he dared not trust the expression of his
  thoughts to any other feature. Titus shook his huge head, and, upon the
  strength of a bumper which he swallowed, mustered resolution enough to
  unburden his bosom.</p>

  <p>"By my sowl," said he, mysteriously, "I've seen enough lately to frighten
  any quiet gentleman out of his senses. I'll not get a wink of sleep, I fear,
  for a week to come. There must have been something dreadful upon Sir Piers's
  mind; sure&mdash;nay, there's no use in mincing the matter with
  <i>you</i>&mdash;in a word, then, some crime too deep to be divulged."</p>

  <p>"Crime!" echoed Coates and Small, in a breath.</p>

  <p>"Ay, crime!" repeated Titus. "Whist! not so loud, lest any one should
  overhear us. Poor Sir Piers, he's dead now. I'm sure you both loved him as I
  did, and pity and pardon him if he was guilty; for certain am I that no soul
  ever took its flight more heavily laden than did that of our poor friend.
  Och! it was a terrible ending. But you shall hear <i>how</i> he died, and
  judge for yourselves. When I returned to his room after Lady Rookwood's
  departure, I found him quite delirious. I knew death was not far off then.
  One minute he was in the chase, cheering on the hounds. 'Halloo! tallyho!'
  cried he: 'who clears that fence?&mdash;who swims that stream?' The next, he
  was drinking, carousing, and hurrahing, at the head of his table. 'Hip! hip!
  hip!'&mdash;as mad, and wild, and frantic as ever he used to be when wine had
  got the better of him; and then all of a sudden, in the midst of his
  shouting, he stopped, exclaiming, 'What! here again?&mdash;who let her
  in?&mdash;the door is fast&mdash;I locked it myself. Devil! why did you open
  it?&mdash;you have betrayed me&mdash;she will poison me&mdash;and I cannot
  resist. Ha! another! Who&mdash;who is that?&mdash;her face is white&mdash;her
  hair hangs about her shoulders. Is she alive again? Susan! Susan! why that
  look? You loved me well&mdash;too well. You will not drag me to perdition!
  You will not appear against me! No, no, no&mdash;it is not in your
  nature&mdash;you whom I doted on, whom I loved&mdash;whom I&mdash;but I
  repented&mdash;I sorrowed&mdash;I prayed&mdash;prayed! Oh! oh! no prayers
  would avail. Pray for me, Susan&mdash;for ever! <i>Your</i> intercession may
  avail. It is not too late. I will do justice to all. Bring me pen and
  ink&mdash;paper&mdash;I will confess&mdash;<i>he</i> shall have all. Where is
  my sister? I would speak with her&mdash;would tell her&mdash;tell her. Call
  Alan Rookwood&mdash;I shall die before I can tell it. Come hither,' said he
  to me. 'There is a dark, dreadful secret on my mind&mdash;it must forth. Tell
  my sister&mdash;no, my senses swim&mdash;Susan is near me&mdash;fury in her
  eyes&mdash;avenging fury&mdash;keep her off. What is this white mass in my
  arms? what do I hold? is it the corpse by my side, as it lay that long, long
  night? It is&mdash;it is. Cold, stiff, stirless as then. White&mdash;horribly
  white&mdash;as when the moon, that would not set, showed all its ghastliness.
  Ah! it moves, embraces me, stifles, suffocates me. Help! remove the pillow. I
  cannot breathe&mdash;I choke&mdash;oh!' And now I am coming to the strangest
  part of my story&mdash;and, strange as it may sound, every word is as true as
  Gospel."</p>

  <p>"Ahem!" coughed Small.</p>

  <p>"Well, at this moment&mdash;this terrible moment&mdash;what should I hear
  but a tap against the wainscot. Holy Virgin! how it startled me. My heart
  leapt to my mouth in an instant, and then went thump, thump, against my ribs.
  But I said nothing, though you may be sure I kept my ears wide open&mdash;and
  then presently I heard the tap repeated somewhat louder, and shortly
  afterwards a third&mdash;I should still have said nothing, but Sir Piers
  heard the knock, and raised himself at the summons, as if it had been the
  last trumpet. 'Come in,' cried he, in a dying voice; and Heaven forgive me if
  I confess that I expected a certain person, whose company one would rather
  dispense with upon such an occasion, to step in. However, though it wasn't
  the ould gentleman, it was somebody near akin to him; for a door I had never
  seen, and never even dreamed of, opened in the wall, and in stepped Peter
  Bradley&mdash;ay, you may well stare, gentlemen; but it was Peter, looking as
  stiff as a crowbar, and as blue as a mattock. Well, he walked straight up to
  the bed of the dying man, and bent his great, diabolical gray eyes upon him,
  laughing all the while&mdash;yes, laughing&mdash;you know the cursed grin he
  has. To proceed. 'You have called me,' said he to Sir Piers; 'I am here. What
  would you with me?'&mdash;'We are not alone,' groaned the dying man. 'Leave
  us, Mr. Tyrconnel&mdash;leave me for five minutes&mdash;only five, mark
  me.'&mdash;'I'll go,' thinks I, 'but I shall never see you again alive.' And
  true enough it was&mdash;I never did see him again with breath in his body.
  Without more ado, I left him, and I had scarcely reached the corridor when I
  heard the door bolted behind me. I then stopped to listen: and I'm sure
  you'll not blame me when I say I clapped my eye to the keyhole; for I
  suspected something wrong. But, Heaven save us! that crafty gravedigger had
  taken his precautions too well. I could neither see nor hear anything, except
  after a few minutes, a wild unearthly screech. And then the door was thrown
  open, and I, not expecting it, was precipitated head foremost into the room,
  to the great damage of my nose. When I got up, Peter had vanished, I suppose,
  as he came; and there was poor Sir Piers leaning back upon the pillow with
  his hands stretched out as if in supplication, his eyes unclosed and staring,
  and his limbs stark and stiff!"</p>

  <p>A profound silence succeeded this narrative. Mr. Coates would not venture
  upon a remark. Dr. Small seemed, for some minutes, lost in painful
  reflection; at length he spoke: "You have described a shocking scene, Mr.
  Tyrconnel, and in a manner that convinces me of its fidelity. But I trust you
  will excuse me, as a friend of the late Sir Piers, in requesting you to
  maintain silence in future on the subject. Its repetition can be productive
  of no good, and may do infinite harm by giving currency to unpleasant
  reports, and harrowing the feelings of the survivors. Every one acquainted
  with Sir Piers's history must be aware, as I dare say you are already, of an
  occurrence which cast a shade over his early life, blighted his character,
  and endangered his personal safety. It was a dreadful accusation. But I
  believe, nay, I am sure, it was unfounded. Dark suspicions attach to a Romish
  priest of the name of Checkley. He, I believe, is beyond the reach of human
  justice. Erring Sir Piers was, undoubtedly. But I trust he was more weak than
  sinful. I have reason to think he was the tool of others, especially of the
  wretch I have named. And it is easy to perceive how that incomprehensible
  lunatic, Peter Bradley, has obtained an ascendancy over him. His daughter,
  you are aware, was Sir Piers's mistress. Our friend is now gone, and with him
  let us bury his offences, and the remembrance of them. That his soul was
  heavily laden, would appear from your account of his last moments; yet I
  fervently trust that his repentance was sincere, in which case there is hope
  of forgiveness for him. 'At what time soever a sinner shall repent him of his
  sins, from the bottom of his heart, I will blot out all his wickedness out of
  my remembrance, saith the Lord.' Heaven's mercy is greater than man's sins.
  And there is hope of salvation even for Sir Piers."</p>

  <p>"I trust so, indeed," said Titus, with emotion; "and as to repeating a
  syllable of what I have just said, devil a word more will I utter on the
  subject. My lips shall be shut and sealed, as close as one of Mr. Coates's
  bonds, for ever and a day: but I thought it just right to make you acquainted
  with the circumstances. And now, having dismissed the bad for ever, I am
  ready to speak of Sir Piers's good qualities, and not few they were. What was
  there becoming a gentleman that he couldn't do, I'd like to know? Couldn't he
  hunt as well as ever a one in the county? and hadn't he as good a pack of
  hounds? Couldn't he shoot as well, and fish as well, and drink as well, or
  better?&mdash;only he couldn't carry his wine, which was his misfortune, not
  his fault. And wasn't he always ready to ask a friend to dinner with him? and
  didn't he give him a good dinner when he came, barring the cross-cups
  afterwards? And hadn't he everything agreeable about him, except his wife?
  which was a great drawback. And with all his peculiarities and humors, wasn't
  he as kind-hearted a man as needs be? and an Irishman at the core? And so, if
  he wern't dead, I'd say long life to him! But as he is, here's peace to his
  memory!"</p>

  <p>At this juncture, a knocking was heard at the door, which some one without
  had vainly tried to open. Titus rose to unclose it, ushering in an individual
  known at the hall as Jack Palmer.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-9"
     name="ch1-9"></a>CHAPTER IX. &mdash; AN ENGLISH ADVENTURER</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Mrs. Peachem.</i> Sure the captain's the finest gentleman
  on the road. &mdash; <i>Beggar's Opera.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">JACK PALMER was a good-humored, good-looking man, with
  immense bushy, red whiskers, a freckled, florid complexion, and sandy hair,
  rather inclined to scantiness towards the scalp of the head, which garnished
  the nape of his neck with a ruff of crisp little curls, like the ring on a
  monk's shaven crown. Notwithstanding this tendency to baldness, Jack could
  not be more than thirty, though his looks were some five years in advance.
  His face was one of those inexplicable countenances, which appear to be
  proper to a peculiar class of men&mdash;a regular Newmarket
  physiognomy&mdash;compounded chiefly of cunning and assurance; not low
  cunning, nor vulgar assurance, but crafty sporting subtlety, careless as to
  results, indifferent to obstacles, ever on the alert for the main chance,
  game and turf all over, eager, yet easy, keen, yet quiet. He was somewhat
  showily dressed, in such wise that he looked half like a fine gentleman of
  that day, half like a jockey of our own. His nether man appeared in
  well-fitting, well-worn buckskins, and boots with tops, not unconscious of
  the saddle; while the airy extravagance of his broad-skirted, sky-blue riding
  coat, the richness of his vest&mdash;the pockets of which were beautifully
  exuberant, according to the mode of 1737&mdash;the smart luxuriance of his
  cravat, and a certain curious taste in the size and style of his buttons,
  proclaimed that, in his own esteem at least, his person did not appear
  altogether unworthy of decoration; nor, in justice to Jack, can we allow that
  he was in error. He was a model of a man for five feet ten; square, compact,
  capitally built in every particular, excepting that his legs were slightly
  imbowed, which defect probably arose from his being almost constantly on
  horseback; a sort of exercise in which Jack greatly delighted, and was
  accounted a superb rider. It was, indeed, his daring horsemanship, upon one
  particular occasion, when he had outstripped a whole field, that had procured
  him the honor of an invitation to Rookwood. Who he was, or whence he came,
  was a question not easily answered&mdash;Jack, himself, evading all solution
  to the inquiry. Sir Piers never troubled his head about the matter: he was a
  "deuced good fellow&mdash;rode well, and stood on no sort of ceremony;" that
  was enough for him. Nobody else knew anything about him, save that he was a
  capital judge of horseflesh, kept a famous black mare, and attended every
  hunt in the West Riding&mdash;that he could sing a good song, was a choice
  companion, and could drink three bottles without feeling the worse for
  them.</p>

  <p>Sensible of the indecorum that might attach to his appearance, Dr. Small
  had hastily laid down his pipe, and arranged his wig. But when he saw who was
  the intruder, with a grunt of defiance he resumed his occupation, without
  returning the bow of the latter, or bestowing further notice upon him.
  Nothing discomposed at the churchman's displeasure, Jack greeted Titus
  cordially, and carelessly saluting Mr. Coates, threw himself into a chair. He
  next filled a tumbler of claret, and drained it at a draught.</p>

  <p>"Have you ridden far, Jack?" asked Titus, noticing the dusty state of
  Palmer's azure attire.</p>

  <p>"Some dozen miles," replied Palmer; "and that, on such a sultry afternoon
  as the present, makes one feel thirstyish. I'm as dry as a sandbed. Famous
  wine this&mdash;beautiful tipple&mdash;better than all your red fustian. Ah,
  how poor Sir Piers used to like it! Well, that's all over&mdash;a glass like
  this might do him good in his present quarters! I'm afraid I'm intruding. But
  the fact is, I wanted a little information about the order of the procession,
  and missing you below, came hither in search of you. You're to be chief
  mourner, I suppose, Titus&mdash;<i>rehearsing</i> your part, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Jack, no joking," replied Titus; "the subject's too serious.
  I am to be chief mourner&mdash;and I expect you to be a mourner&mdash;and
  everybody else to be mourners. We must all mourn at the proper time. There'll
  be a power of people at the church."</p>

  <p>"There <i>are</i> a power of people here already," returned Jack, "if they
  all attend."</p>

  <p>"And they all <i>will</i> attend, or what is the eating and drinking to go
  for? I sha'n't leave a soul in the house."</p>

  <p>"Excepting one," said Jack, archly. "Lady Rookwood won't attend, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"Ay, excepting her ladyship and her ladyship's abigail. All the rest go
  with me, and form part of the procession. You go too."</p>

  <p>"Of course. At what time do you start?"</p>

  <p>"Twelve precisely. As the clock strikes, we set out&mdash;all in a line,
  and a long line we'll make. I'm waiting for that ould coffin-faced rascal,
  Peter Bradley, to arrange the order."</p>

  <p>"How long will it all occupy, think you?" asked Jack, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"That I can't say," returned Titus; "possibly an hour, more or less. But
  we shall start to the minute&mdash;that is, if we can get all together, so
  don't be out of the way. And hark ye, Jack, you must contrive to change your
  toggery. That sky-blue coat won't do. It's not the thing at all, at all."</p>

  <p>"Never fear that," replied Palmer. "But who were those in the
  carriages?"</p>

  <p>"Is it the last carriage you mean? Squire Forester and his sons. They're
  dining with the other gentlefolk, in the great room up-stairs, to be out of
  the way. Oh, we'll have a grand <i>berrin'</i>. And, by St. Patrick! I must
  be looking after it."</p>

  <p>"Stay a minute," said Jack; "let's have a cool bottle first. They are all
  taking care of themselves below, and Peter Bradley has not made his
  appearance, so you need be in no hurry. I'll go with you presently. Shall I
  ring for the claret?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," replied Titus.</p>

  <p>Jack accordingly arose; and a butler answering the summons, a long-necked
  bottle was soon placed before them.</p>

  <p>"You heard of the affray last night, I presume?" said Jack, renewing the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"With the poachers? To be sure I did. Wasn't I called in to examine Hugh
  Badger's wounds the first thing this morning; and a deep cut there was, just
  over the eye, besides other bruises."</p>

  <p>"Is the wound dangerous?" inquired Palmer.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly mortal, if you mean that," replied the Irishman; "dangerous,
  certainly."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" exclaimed Jack; "they'd a pretty hardish bout of it, I
  understand. Anything been heard of the body?"</p>

  <p>"What body?" inquired Small, who was half-dozing.</p>

  <p>"The body of the drowned poacher," replied Jack; "they were off to search
  for it this morning."</p>

  <p>"Found it&mdash;not they!" exclaimed Titus. "Ha, ha!&mdash;I can't help
  laughing, for the life and <i>sowl</i> of me; a capital trick he played
  'em,&mdash;capital&mdash;ha, ha! What do you think the fellow did? Ha,
  ha!&mdash;after leading 'em the devil's dance, all around the park, killing a
  hound as savage as a wolf, and breaking Hugh Badger's head, which is as hard
  and thick as a butcher's block, what does the fellow do but dive into a pool,
  with a great rock hanging over it, and make his way to the other side,
  through a subterranean cavern, which nobody knew anything about, till they
  came to drag it, thinking him snugly drowned all the while&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha!" chorused Jack; "bravo! he's a lad of the right
  sort&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"He! who?" inquired the attorney.</p>

  <p>"Why, the poacher, to be sure," replied Jack; "who else were we talking
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon," returned Coates; "I thought you might have heard some
  intelligence. We've got an eye upon him. We know who it was."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Jack; "and who was it?"</p>

  <p>"A fellow known by the name of Luke Bradley."</p>

  <p>"Zounds!" cried Titus, "you don't say it was he? Murder in Irish! that
  bates everything; why, he was Sir Piers's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Natural son," replied the attorney; "he has not been heard of for some
  time&mdash;shockingly incorrigible rascal&mdash;impossible to do anything
  with him."</p>

  <p>"You don't say so?" observed Jack. "I've heard Sir Piers speak of the lad;
  and, by his account, he's as fine a fellow as ever crossed tit's back; only a
  little wildish and unreasonable, as the best of us may be; wants breaking,
  that's all. Your skittish colt makes the best horse, and so would he. To
  speak the truth, I'm glad he escaped."</p>

  <p>"So am I," rejoined Titus; "for, in the first place, I've a foolish
  partiality for poachers, and am sorry when any of 'em come to hurt; and, in
  the second, I'd be mighty displeased if any ill had happened to one of Sir
  Piers's flesh and blood, as this young chap appears to be."</p>

  <p>"Appears to be!" repeated Palmer; "there's no <i>appearing</i> in the
  case, I take it. This Bradley's an undoubted offshoot of the old squire. His
  mother was a servant-maid at the hall, I rather think. You sir," continued
  he, addressing Coates, "perhaps, can inform us of the real facts of the
  case."</p>

  <p>"She was something better than a servant," replied the attorney, with a
  slight cough and a knowing wink. "I remember her quite well, though I was but
  a boy then; a lovely creature, and so taking, I don't wonder that Sir Piers
  was smitten with her. He was mad after the women in those days, and pretty
  Sue Bradley above all others. She lived with him quite like his lady."</p>

  <p>"So I've heard," returned Jack; "and she remained with him till her death.
  Let me see, wasn't there something rather odd in the way in which she died,
  rather suddenish and unexpected,&mdash;a noise made about it at the time,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"Not that I ever heard," replied Coates, shaking his head, and appearing
  to be afflicted with an instantaneous ignorance; while Titus affected not to
  hear the remark, but occupied himself with his wine-glass. Small snored
  audibly. "I was too young, then, to pay any attention to idle rumors,"
  continued Coates. "It's a long time ago. May I ask the reason of your
  inquiry?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing further than simple curiosity," replied Jack, enjoying the
  consternation of his companions. "It is, as you say, a long while since. But
  it's singular how that sort of thing is remembered. One would think people
  had something else to do than talk of one's private affairs for ever. For my
  part, I despise such tattle. But there <i>are</i> persons in the neighborhood
  who still say it was an awkward business. Amongst others, I've heard that
  this very Luke Bradley talks in pretty plain terms about it."</p>

  <p>"Does he, indeed?" said Coates. "So much the worse for him. Let me once
  lay hands upon him, and I'll put a gag in his mouth that shall spoil his
  talking in the future."</p>

  <p>"That's precisely the point I desire to arrive at," replied Jack; "and I
  advise you by all means to accomplish that, for the sake of the family.
  Nobody likes his friends to be talked about. So I'd settle the matter
  amicably, were I you. Just let the fellow go his way; he won't return here
  again in a hurry, I'll be bound. As to clapping him in quod, he might
  prattle&mdash;turn stag."</p>

  <p>"Turn stag!" replied Coates, "what the deuce is that? In my opinion, he
  has 'turned stag' already. At all events, he'll pay <i>deer</i> for his
  night's sport, you may depend upon it. What signifies it what <i>he</i> says?
  Let me lay hands upon him, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," said Jack, "no offence. I only meant to offer a suggestion.
  I thought the family, young Sir Ranulph, I mean, mightn't like the story to
  be revived. As to Lady Rookwood, she don't, I suppose, care much about idle
  reports. Indeed, if I've been rightly informed, she bears this youngster no
  particular good-will to begin with, and has tried hard to get him out of the
  country. But, as you say, what <i>does</i> it signify what he says? he can
  <i>only</i> talk. Sir Piers is dead and gone."</p>

  <p>"Humph!" muttered Coates, peevishly.</p>

  <p>"But it does seem a little hard, that a lad should swing for killing a bit
  of venison in his own father's park."</p>

  <p>"Which he'd a <i>nat'ral</i> right to do," cried Titus.</p>

  <p>"He had no natural right to bruise, violently assault, and endanger the
  life of his father's, or anybody else's gamekeeper," retorted Coates. "I tell
  you, sir, he's committed a capital offence, and if he's
  taken&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No chance of that, I hope," interrupted Jack.</p>

  <p>"That's a wish I can't help wishing myself," said Titus: "on my
  conscience, these poachers are fine boys, when all's said and done."</p>

  <p>"The finest of all boys," exclaimed Jack, with a kindred enthusiasm, "are
  those birds of the night, and minions of the moon, whom we call, most
  unjustly, poachers. They are, after all, only <i>professional sportsmen</i>,
  making a business of what we make a pleasure; a nightly pursuit of what is to
  us a daily relaxation; there's the main distinction. As to the rest, it's all
  in idea; they merely thin an overstocked park, as <i>you</i> would reduce a
  plethoric patient, doctor; or as <i>you</i> would work a moneyed client, if
  you got him into Chancery, Mister Attorney. And then how much more
  scientifically and systematically they set to work than we amateurs do! how
  noiselessly they bag a hare, smoke a pheasant, or knock a buck down with an
  air-gun! how independent are they of any license, except that of a good eye,
  and a swift pair of legs! how unnecessary is it for them to ask permission to
  shoot over Mr. So-and-so's grounds, or my Lord That's preserves! they are
  free of every cover, and indifferent to any alteration in the game laws. I've
  some thoughts, when everything else fails, of taking to poaching myself. In
  my opinion, a poacher's a highly respectable character. What say you, Mr.
  Coates?" turning very gravely to that gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Such a question, sir," replied Coates, bridling up, "scarcely deserves a
  serious answer. I make no doubt you will next maintain that a highwayman is a
  gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Most undoubtedly," replied Palmer, in the same grave tone, which might
  have passed for banter, had Jack ever bantered. "I'll maintain and prove it.
  I don't see how he can be otherwise. It is as necessary for a man to be a
  gentleman before he can turn highwayman, as it is for a doctor to have his
  diploma, or an attorney his certificate. Some of the finest gentlemen of
  their day, as Captain Lovelace, Hind, Hannum, and Dudley, were eminent on the
  road, and they set the fashion. Ever since their day a real highwayman would
  consider himself disgraced, if he did not conduct himself in every way like a
  gentleman. Of course, there are pretenders in this line, as in everything
  else. But these are only exceptions, and prove the rule. What are the
  distinguishing characteristics of a fine gentleman?&mdash;perfect knowledge
  of the world&mdash;perfect independence of
  character&mdash;notoriety&mdash;command of cash&mdash;and inordinate success
  with the women. You grant all these premises? First, then, it is part of a
  highwayman's business to be thoroughly acquainted with the world. He is the
  easiest and pleasantest fellow going. There is Tom King, for example: he is
  the handsomest man about town, and the best-bred fellow on the road. Then
  whose inclinations are so uncontrolled as the highwayman's, so long as the
  mopuses last? who produces so great an effect by so few words?&mdash;'STAND
  AND DELIVER!' is sure to arrest attention. Every one is captivated by an
  address so <i>taking</i>. As to money, he wins a purse of a hundred guineas
  as easily as you would the same sum from the faro table. And wherein lies the
  difference? only in the name of the game. Who so little need of a banker as
  he? all he has to apprehend is a check&mdash;all he has to draw is a trigger.
  As to the women, they dote upon him: not even your red-coat is so successful.
  Look at a highwayman mounted on his flying steed, with his pistols in his
  holsters, and his mask upon his face. What can be a more gallant sight? The
  clatter of his horse's heels is like music to his ear&mdash;he is in full
  quest&mdash;he shouts to the fugitive horseman to stay&mdash;the other flies
  all the faster&mdash;what chase can be half so exciting as that? Suppose he
  overtakes his prey, which ten to one he will, how readily his summons to
  deliver is obeyed! how satisfactory is the appropriation of a lusty purse or
  corpulent pocket-book!&mdash;getting the brush is nothing to it. How
  tranquilly he departs, takes off his hat to his accommodating acquaintance,
  wishes him a pleasant journey, and disappears across the heath! England, sir,
  has reason to be proud of her highwaymen. They are peculiar to her clime, and
  are as much before the brigand of Italy, the contrabandist of Spain, or the
  cut-purse of France&mdash;as her sailors are before all the rest of the
  world. The day will never come, I hope, when we shall degenerate into the
  footpad, and lose our <i>Night Errantry</i>. Even the French borrow from
  us&mdash;they have only one highwayman of eminence, and he learnt and
  practised his art in England."</p>

  <p>"And who was he, may I ask?" said Coates.</p>

  <p>"Claude Du-Val," replied Jack; "and though a Frenchman, he was a deuced
  fine fellow in his day&mdash;quite a tip-top macaroni&mdash;he could skip and
  twirl like a figurant, warble like an opera-singer, and play the flageolet
  better than any man of his day&mdash;he always carried a lute in his pocket,
  along with his snappers. And then his dress&mdash;it was quite beautiful to
  see how smartly he was rigg'd out, all velvet and lace; and even with his
  vizard on his face, the ladies used to cry out to see him. Then he took a
  purse with the air and grace of a receiver-general. All the women adored
  him&mdash;and that, bless their pretty faces! was the best proof of his
  gentility. I wish he'd not been a Mounseer. The women never mistake.
  <i>They</i> can always discover the true gentlemen, and they were all, of
  every degree, from the countess to the kitchen-maid, over head and ears in
  love with him."</p>

  <p>"But he was taken, I suppose?" asked Coates.</p>

  <p>"Ay," responded Jack, "the women were his undoing, as they've been many a
  brave fellow's before, and will be again." Touched by which reflection, Jack
  became for once in his life sentimental, and sighed. "Poor Du-Val! he was
  seized at the Hole-in-the-Wall in Chandos-street by the bailiff of
  Westminster, when dead drunk, his liquor having been drugged by his
  dells&mdash;and was shortly afterwards hanged at Tyburn."</p>

  <p>"It was thousand pities," said Mr. Coates, with a sneer, "that so fine a
  gentleman should come to so ignominious an end!"</p>

  <p>"Quite the contrary," returned Jack. "As his biographer, Doctor Pope,
  properly remarks, 'Who is there worthy of the name of man, that would not
  prefer such a death before a mean, solitary, inglorious life?' By-the-by,
  Titus, as we're upon the subject, if you like I'll sing you a song about
  highwaymen."</p>

  <p>"I should like it of all things," replied Titus, who entertained a very
  favorable opinion of Jack's vocal powers, and was by no means an indifferent
  performer; "only let it be in a minor key."</p>

  <p>Jack required no further encouragement, but disregarding the hints and
  looks of Coates, sang with much unction the following ballad to a good old
  tune, then very popular&mdash;the merit of which "nobody can deny."</p>

  <h3>A CHAPTER OF HIGHWAYMEN</h3>

  <p class="quote">Of every rascal of every kind,<br>
  The most notorious to my mind,<br>
  Was the Cavalier Captain, gay <span class="smcap">Jemmy Hind</span>![7]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">But the pleasantest coxcomb among them all<br>
  For lute, coranto, and madrigal,<br>
  Was the galliard Frenchman, <span class="smcap">Claude Du-Val</span>![8]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">And Tobygloak never a coach could rob,<br>
  Could lighten a pocket, or empty a fob,<br>
  With a neater hand than <span class="smcap">Old Mob, Old Mob</span>![9]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">Nor did housebreaker ever deal harder knocks<br>
  On the stubborn lid of a good strong box,<br>
  Than that prince of good fellows, <span class="smcap">Tom Cox, Tom
  Cox</span>![10]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">A blither fellow on broad highway,<br>
  Did never with oath bid traveller stay,<br>
  Than devil-may-care <span class="smcap">Will Holloway</span>![11]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">And in roguery naught could exceed the tricks<br>
  Of <span class="smcap">Gettings</span> and <span class="smcap">Grey</span>,
  and the five or six<br>
  Who trod in the steps of bold <span class="smcap">Neddy Wicks</span>![12]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">Nor could any so handily break a lock<br>
  As <span class="smcap">Sheppard</span>, who stood on the Newgate dock,<br>
  And nicknamed the jailers around him "<i>his flock</i>!"[13]<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p>

  <p class="quote">Nor did highwaymen ever before possess<br>
  For ease, for security, danger, distress,<br>
  Such a mare as <span class="smcap">Dick Turpin's</span> Black Bess! Black
  Bess!<br>
  <i>Which nobody can deny.</i></p><br>

  <p>"A capital song, by the powers!" cried Titus, as Jack's ditty came to a
  close. "But your English robbers are nothing at all, compared with our
  Tories[14] and Rapparees&mdash;nothing at all. They were the <i>raal</i>
  gentlemen&mdash;they were the boys to cut a throat <i>aisily</i>."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" exclaimed Jack, in disgust, "the gentlemen I speak of never
  maltreated any one, except in self-defence."</p>

  <p>"Maybe not," replied Titus; "I'll not dispute the point&mdash;but these
  Rapparees were true brothers of the blade, and gentlemen every inch. I'll
  just sing you a song I made about them myself. But meanwhile don't let's
  forget the bottle&mdash;talking's dry work. My service to you, doctor!" added
  he, winking at the somnolent Small. And tossing off his glass, Titus
  delivered himself with much joviality of the following ballad; the words of
  which he adapted to the tune of the <i>Groves of the Pool</i>:</p>

  <h3>THE RAPPAREES</h3>

  <p class="quote">Let the Englishman boast of his Turpins and Sheppards, as
  cocks of the walk,<br>
  His Mulsacks, and Cheneys, and Swiftnecks[15]&mdash;it's all botheration and
  talk;<br>
  Compared with the robbers of Ireland, they don't come within half a mile,<br>
  There never were yet any rascals like those of my own native isle!</p>

  <p class="quote">First and foremost comes <span class="smcap">Redmond
  O'Hanlon</span>, allowed the first thief of the world,[16]<br>
  That o'er the broad province of Ulster the Rapparee banner unfurled;<br>
  Och! he was an elegant fellow, as ever you saw in your life,<br>
  At fingering the blunderbuss trigger, or handling the throat-cutting
  knife.</p>

  <p class="quote">And then such a dare-devil squadron as that which composed
  <span class="smcap">Redmond'</span>s <i>tail</i>!<br>
  Meel, Mactigh, Jack Reilly, Shan Bernagh, Phil Galloge, and Arthur
  O'Neal;<br>
  <i>Shure</i> never were any boys like 'em for rows, <i>agitations</i>, and
  sprees,<br>
  Not a <i>rap</i> did they leave in the country, and hence they were called
  <i>Rap</i>parees.[17]</p>

  <p class="quote">Next comes POWER, the great Tory[18] of Munster, a gentleman
  born every inch,<br>
  And strong <span class="smcap">Jack Macpherson</span> of Leinster, a
  horse-shoe who broke at a pinch;<br>
  The last was a fellow so <i>lively</i>, not death e'en his courage could
  damp,<br>
  For as he was led to the gallows, he played his own "march to the
  camp."[19]</p>

  <p class="quote"><span class="smcap">Paddy Fleming, Dick Balf</span>, and
  <span class="smcap">Mulhoni</span>, I think are the next on my list,<br>
  All adepts in the beautiful science of giving a pocket a twist;<br>
  <span class="smcap">Jemmy Carrick</span> must follow his leaders, <i>ould</i>
  <span class="smcap">Purney</span> who put in a huff,<br>
  By dancing a hornpipe at Tyburn, and bothering the hangman for snuff.</p>

  <p class="quote">There's <span class="smcap">Paul Liddy</span>, the
  curly-pate Tory, whose noddle was stuck on a spike,<br>
  And <span class="smcap">Billy Delaney</span>, the "<i>Songster</i>,"[20] we
  never shall meet with his like;<br>
  For his neck by a witch was anointed, and warranted safe by her charm,<br>
  No hemp that was ever yet twisted his wonderful throttle could harm.</p>

  <p class="quote">And lastly, there's <span class="smcap">Cahir Na

  Your tit is not safe in your stable, though you or your groom should be
  near,<br>
  And devil a bit in the paddock, if <span class="smcap">Cahir</span> gets
  <i>hould</i> of his ear.</p>

  <p class="quote">Then success to the Tories of Ireland, the generous, the
  gallant, the gay!<br>
  With them the best <i>Rumpads</i>[21] of England are not to be named the same
  day!<br>
  And were further proof wanting to show what precedence we take with our
  <i>prigs</i>,<br>
  Recollect that <i>our</i> robbers are Tories, while those of
  <i>your</i>country are Whigs.</p><br>

  <p>"Bravissimo!" cried Jack, drumming upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Coates, "we've had enough about the Irish highwaymen, in all
  conscience. But there's a rascal on our side of the Channel, whom you have
  only incidentally mentioned, and who makes more noise than them all put
  together."</p>

  <p>"Who's that?" asked Jack, with some curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Dick Turpin," replied the attorney: "he seems to me quite as worthy of
  mention as any of the Hinds, the Du-Vals, or the O'Hanlons, you have either
  of you enumerated."</p>

  <p>"I did not think of him," replied Palmer, smiling; "though, if I had, he
  scarcely deserves to be ranked with those illustrious heroes."</p>

  <p>"Gads bobs!" cried Titus; "they tell me Turpin keeps the best nag in the
  United Kingdom, and can ride faster and further in a day than any other man
  in a week."</p>

  <p>"So I've heard," said Palmer, with a glance of satisfaction. "I should
  like to try a run with him. I warrant me, I'd not be far behind."</p>

  <p>"I should like to get a peep at him," quoth Titus.</p>

  <p>"So should I," added Coates. "Vastly!"</p>

  <p>"You may both of you be gratified, gentlemen," said Palmer. "Talking of
  Dick Turpin, they say, is like speaking of the devil, he's at your elbow ere
  the word's well out of your mouth. He may be within hearing at this moment,
  for anything we know to the contrary."</p>

  <p>"Body o' me!" ejaculated Coates, "you don't say so? Turpin in Yorkshire! I
  thought he confined his exploits to the neighborhood of the metropolis, and
  made Epping Forest his headquarters."</p>

  <p>"So he did," replied Jack, "but the cave is all up now. The whole of the
  great North Road, from Tottenham Cross to York gates, comes within Dick's
  present range; and Saint Nicholas only knows in which part of it he is most
  likely to be found. He shifts his quarters as often and as readily as a
  Tartar; and he who looks for him may chance to catch a
  Tartar&mdash;ha!&mdash;ha!"</p>

  <p>"It's a disgrace to the country that such a rascal should remain
  unhanged," returned Coates, peevishly. "Government ought to look to it. Is
  the whole kingdom to be kept in a state of agitation by a single
  highwayman?&mdash;Sir Robert Walpole should take the affair into his own
  hands."</p>

  <p>"Fudge!" exclaimed Jack, emptying his glass.</p>

  <p>"I have already addressed a letter to the editor of the <i>Common
  Sense</i> on the subject," said Coates, "in which I have spoken my mind
  pretty plainly: and I repeat, it is perfectly disgraceful that such a rascal
  should be suffered to remain at large."</p>

  <p>"You don't happen to have that letter by you, I suppose," said Jack, "or I
  should beg the favor to hear it?&mdash;I am not acquainted with the newspaper
  to which you allude;&mdash;I read <i>Fog's Journal</i>."</p>

  <p>"So I thought," replied Coates, with a sneer; "that's the reason you are
  so easily mystified. But luckily I have the paper in my pocket; and you are
  quite welcome to my opinions. Here it is," added he, drawing forth a
  newspaper. "I shall waive my preliminary remarks, and come to the point at
  once."</p>

  <p>"By all means," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"'I thank God,'" began Coates, in an authoritative tone, "'that I was born
  in a country that hath formerly emulated the Romans in their public spirit;
  as is evident from their conquests abroad, and their struggles for liberty at
  home.'"</p>

  <p>"What has all this got to do with Turpin?" interposed Jack.</p>

  <p>"You will hear," replied the attorney&mdash;"no interruptions if you
  please. 'But this noble principle,'" continued he, with great emphasis,
  "'though not utterly lost, I cannot think at present so active as it ought to
  be in a nation so jealous of her liberty.'"</p>

  <p>"Good!" exclaimed Jack. "There is more than '<i>common sense</i>' in that
  observation, Mr. Coates."</p>

  <p>"'My suspicion,'" proceeded Coates, "'is founded on a late instance. I
  mean the flagrant, undisturbed success of the notorious TURPIN, who hath
  robb'd in a manner scarce ever known before for several years, and is grown
  so insolent and impudent as to threaten particular persons, and become openly
  dangerous to the lives as well as fortunes of the people of England.'"</p>

  <p>"Better and better," shouted Jack, laughing immoderately. "Pray go on,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"'That a fellow,'" continued Coates, "'who is known to be a thief by the
  whole kingdom, shall for so long a time continue to rob us, and not only rob
  us, but make a jest of us&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;capital! Excuse me, sir," roared Jack,
  laughing till the tears ran down his cheeks&mdash;"pray, pray, go on."</p>

  <p>"I see nothing to laugh at," replied Coates, somewhat offended; "however,
  I will conclude my letter, since I have begun it&mdash;'not only rob us, but
  make a jest of us, shall defy the laws, and laugh at justice, argues a want
  of public spirit, which should make every particular member of the community
  sensible of the public calamity, and ambitious of the honor of extirpating
  such a notorious highwayman from society, since he owes his long successes to
  no other cause than his immoderate impudence, and the sloth and pusillanimity
  of those who ought to bring him to justice.' I will not deny," continued
  Coates, "that, professing myself, as I do, to be a staunch new Whig, I had
  not some covert political object in penning this epistle.[22] Nevertheless,
  setting aside my principles&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Right," observed Jack; "you Whigs, new or old, always set aside your
  principles."</p>

  <p>"Setting aside any political feeling I may entertain," continued Coates,
  disregarding the interruption, "I repeat, I am ambitious of extirpating this
  modern Cacus&mdash;this Autolycus of the eighteenth century."</p>

  <p>"And what course do you mean to pursue?" asked Jack, "for I suppose you do
  not expect to catch this '<i>ought-to-lick-us</i>,' as you call him, by a
  line in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"I am in the habit of keeping my own counsel, sir," replied Coates,
  pettishly; "and to be plain with you, I hope to finger all the reward
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Oons, is there a reward offered for Turpin's apprehension?" asked
  Titus.</p>

  <p>"No less than two hundred pounds," answered Coates, "and that's no trifle,
  as you will both admit. Have you not seen the king's proclamation, Mr.
  Palmer?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," replied Jack, with affected indifference.</p>

  <p>"Nor I," added Titus, with some appearance of curiosity; "do you happen to
  have <i>that</i> by you too?"</p>

  <p>"I always carry it about with me," replied Coates, "that I may refer to it
  in case of emergency. My father, Christopher, or Kit Coates, as he was
  familiarly called, was a celebrated thief-taker. He apprehended Spicket, and
  Child, and half a dozen others, and always kept their descriptions in his
  pocket. I endeavor to tread in my worthy father's footsteps. I hope to
  signalize myself by capturing a highwayman. By-the-by," added he, surveying
  Jack more narrowly, "it occurs to me that Turpin must be rather like you, Mr.
  Palmer?"</p>

  <p>"Like me," said Jack, regarding Coates askance; "like me&mdash;how am I to
  understand you, sir, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No offence; none whatever, sir. Ah! stay, you won't object to my
  comparing the description. That <i>can</i> do no harm. Nobody would take you
  for a highwayman&mdash;nobody whatever&mdash;ha! ha! Singular
  resemblance&mdash;he&mdash;he. These things <i>do</i> happen sometimes: not
  very often, though. But here is Turpin's description in the <i>Gazette</i>,
  <i>June 28th</i>, A.D. 1737:&mdash;'<i>It having been represented to the King
  that Richard Turpin did, on Wednesday, the 4th of May last, rob on his
  Majesty's highway Vavasour Mowbray, Esq., Major of the 2d troop of Horse
  Grenadiers</i>'&mdash;that Major Mowbray, by-the-by, is a nephew of the late
  Sir Piers, and cousin of the present baronet&mdash;'<i>and commit other
  notorious felonies and robberies near London, his Majesty is pleased to
  promise his most gracious pardon to any of his accomplices, and a reward of
  two hundred pounds to any person or persons who shall discover him, so as he
  may be apprehended and convicted</i>.'"</p>

  <p>"Odsbodikins!" exclaimed Titus, "a noble reward! I should like to lay
  hands upon Turpin," added he, slapping Palmer's shoulder: "I wish he were in
  your place at this moment, Jack."</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" replied Palmer, shifting his chair.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Turpin</i>,'" continued Coates, "'<i>was born at Thacksted, in Essex;
  is about thirty</i>'&mdash;you, sir, I believe, are about thirty?" added he,
  addressing Palmer.</p>

  <p>"Thereabouts," said Jack, bluffly. "But what has my age to do with that of
  Turpin?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing at all," answered Coates; "suffer me, however, to
  proceed:&mdash;'<i>Is by trade a butcher</i>,'&mdash;you, sir, I believe,
  never had any dealings in that line?"</p>

  <p>"I have some notion how to dispose of a troublesome calf," returned Jack.
  "But Turpin, though described as a butcher, is, I understand, a lineal
  descendant of a great French archbishop of the same name."</p>

  <p>"Who wrote the chronicles of that royal robber Charlemagne; I know him,"
  replied Coates&mdash;"a terrible liar!&mdash;The modern Turpin '<i>is about
  five feet nine inches high</i>'&mdash;exactly your height,
  sir&mdash;exactly!"</p>

  <p>"I am five feet ten," answered Jack, standing bolt upright.</p>

  <p>"You have an inch, then, in your favor," returned the unperturbed
  attorney, deliberately proceeding with his examination&mdash;"'<i>he has a
  brown complexion, marked with the smallpox</i>.'"</p>

  <p>"My complexion is florid&mdash;my face without a seam," quoth Jack.</p>

  <p>"Those whiskers would conceal anything," replied Coates, with a grin.
  "Nobody wears whiskers nowadays, except a highwayman."</p>

  <p>"Sir!" said Jack, sternly. "You are personal."</p>

  <p>"I don't mean to be so," replied Coates; "but you must allow the
  description tallies with your own in a remarkable manner. Hear me out,
  however&mdash;'<i>his cheek bones are broad&mdash;his face is thinner towards
  the bottom&mdash;his visage short&mdash;pretty upright&mdash;and broad about
  the shoulders</i>.' Now I appeal to Mr. Tyrconnel if all this does not sound
  like a portrait of yourself."</p>

  <p>"Don't appeal to me," said Titus, hastily, "upon such a delicate point. I
  can't say that I approve of a gentleman being likened to a highwayman. But if
  ever there was a highwayman I'd wish to resemble, it's either Redmond
  O'Hanlon or Richard Turpin; and may the devil burn me if I know which of the
  two is the greater rascal!"</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Palmer," said Coates, "I repeat, I mean no offence. Likenesses
  are unaccountable. I am said to be like my Lord North; whether I am or not,
  the Lord knows. But if ever I meet with Turpin I shall bear you in
  mind&mdash;he&mdash;he! Ah! if ever I <i>should</i> have the good luck to
  stumble upon him, I've a plan for his capture which couldn't fail. Only let
  me get a glimpse of him, that's all. You shall see how I'll dispose of
  him."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, we <i>shall</i> see," observed Palmer. "And for your own sake,
  I wish you may never be nearer to him than you are at this moment. With his
  friends, they say Dick Turpin can be as gentle as a lamb; with his foes,
  especially with a limb of the law like yourself, he's been found but an ugly
  customer. I once saw him at Newmarket, where he was collared by two constable
  culls, one on each side. Shaking off one, and dealing the other a blow in the
  face with his heavy-handled whip, he stuck spurs into his mare, and though
  the whole field gave chase, he distanced them all, easily."</p>

  <p>"And how came you not to try your pace with him, if you were there, as you
  boasted a short time ago?" asked Coates.</p>

  <p>"So I did, and stuck closer to him than any one else. We were neck and
  neck. I was the only person who could have delivered him to the hands of
  justice, if I'd felt inclined."</p>

  <p>"Zounds!" cried Coates; "If I had a similar opportunity, it should be neck
  or nothing. Either he or I should reach the scragging-post first. I'd take
  him, dead or alive."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> take Turpin?" cried Jack, with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"I'd engage to do it," replied Coates. "I'll bet you a hundred guineas I
  take him, if I ever have the same chance."</p>

  <p>"Done!" exclaimed Jack, rapping the table at the same time, so that the
  glasses danced upon it.</p>

  <p>"That's right," cried Titus. "I'll go you halves."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter&mdash;what's the matter?" exclaimed Small, awakened
  from his doze.</p>

  <p>"Only a trifling bet about a highwayman," replied Titus.</p>

  <p>"A highwayman!" echoed Small. "Eh! what? there are none in the house, I
  hope."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," answered Coates. "But this gentleman has taken up the
  defence of the notorious Dick Turpin in so singular a manner,
  that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Quod factu foedum est, idem est et Dictu Turpe</i>," returned Small.
  "The less said about that rascal the better."</p>

  <p>"So I think," replied Jack. "The fact is as you say, sir&mdash;were Dick
  here, he would, I am sure, take the <i>freedom to hide 'em</i>."</p>

  <p>Further discourse was cut short by the sudden opening of the door,
  followed by the abrupt entrance of a tall, slender young man, who hastily
  advanced towards the table, around which the company were seated. His
  appearance excited the utmost astonishment in the whole group: curiosity was
  exhibited in every countenance&mdash;the magnum remained poised midway in the
  hand of Palmer&mdash;Dr. Small scorched his thumb in the bowl of his pipe;
  and Mr. Coates was almost choked, by swallowing an inordinate whiff of
  vapor.</p>

  <p>"Young Sir Ranulph!" ejaculated he, as soon as the syncope would permit
  him.</p>

  <p>"Sir Ranulph here?" echoed Palmer, rising.</p>

  <p>"Angels and ministers!" exclaimed Small.</p>

  <p>"Odsbodikins!" cried Titus, with a theatrical start; "this is more than I
  expected."</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," said Ranulph, "do not let my unexpected arrival here
  discompose you. Dr. Small, you will excuse the manner of my greeting; and
  you, Mr. Coates. One of the present party, I believe, was my father's medical
  attendant, Dr. Tyrconnel."</p>

  <p>"I had that honor," replied the Irishman, bowing profoundly&mdash;"I am
  Dr. Tyrconnel, Sir Ranulph, at your service."</p>

  <p>"When, and at what hour, did my father breathe his last, sir?" inquired
  Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Poor Sir Piers," answered Titus, again bowing, "departed this life on
  Thursday last."</p>

  <p>"The hour?&mdash;the precise minute?" asked Ranulph, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Troth, Sir Ranulph, as nearly as I can recollect, it might be a few
  minutes before midnight."</p>

  <p>"The very hour!" exclaimed Ranulph, striding towards the window. His steps
  were arrested as his eye fell upon the attire of his father, which, as we
  have before noticed, hung at that end of the room. A slight shudder passed
  over his frame. There was a momentary pause, during which Ranulph continued
  gazing intently at the apparel. "The very dress, too!" muttered he; then
  turning to the assembly, who were watching his movements with surprise;
  "Doctor," said he, addressing Small, "I have something for your private ear.
  Gentlemen, will you spare us the room for a few minutes?"</p>

  <p>"On my conscience," said Tyrconnel to Jack Palmer, as they quitted the
  sanctum, "a mighty fine boy is this young Sir Ranulph!&mdash;and a chip of
  the ould block!&mdash;he'll be as good a fellow as his father."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," replied Palmer, shutting the door. "But what the devil brought
  him back, just in the nick of it?"</p>

  </div><br>

  <p class="first">"THERE is nothing, I trust, my dear young friend, and
  quondam pupil," said Dr. Small, as the door was closed, "that weighs upon
  your mind, beyond the sorrow naturally incident to an affliction, severe as
  the present. Forgive my apprehensions if I am wrong. You know the
  affectionate interest I have ever felt for you&mdash;an interest which, I
  assure you, is nowise diminished, and which will excuse my urging you to
  unburden your mind to me; assuring yourself, that whatever may be your
  disclosure, you will have my sincere sympathy and commiseration. I may be
  better able to advise with you, should counsel be necessary, than others,
  from my knowledge of your character and temperament. I would not anticipate
  evil, and am, perhaps, unnecessarily apprehensive. But I own, I am startled
  at the incoherence of your expressions, coupled with your sudden and almost
  mysterious appearance at this distressing conjuncture. Answer me: has your
  return been the result of mere accident? is it to be considered one of those
  singular circumstances which almost look like fate, and baffle our
  comprehension? or were you nearer home than we expected, and received the
  news of your father's demise through some channel unknown to us? Satisfy my
  curiosity, I beg of you, upon this point."</p>

  <p>"Your curiosity, my dear sir," replied Ranulph, gravely and sadly, "will
  not be decreased, when I tell you, that my return has neither been the work
  of chance,&mdash;for I came, fully anticipating the dread event, which I find
  realized,&mdash;nor has it been occasioned by any intelligence derived from
  yourself, or others. It was only, indeed, upon my arrival here that I
  received full confirmation of my apprehensions. I had another, a more
  terrible summons to return."</p>

  <p>"What summons? you perplex me!" exclaimed Small, gazing with some
  misgiving into the face of his young friend.</p>

  <p>"I am myself perplexed&mdash;sorely perplexed," returned Ranulph. "I have
  much to relate; but I pray you bear with me to the end. I have that on my
  mind which, like guilt, must be revealed."</p>

  <p>"Speak, then, fearlessly to me," said Small, affectionately pressing
  Ranulph's hand, "and assure yourself, beforehand, of my sympathy."</p>

  <p>"It will be necessary," said Ranulph, "to preface my narrative by some
  slight allusion to certain painful events&mdash;and yet I know not why I
  should call them painful, excepting in their consequences&mdash;which
  influenced my conduct in my final interview between my father and
  myself&mdash;an interview which occasioned my departure for the
  Continent&mdash;and which was of a character so dreadful, that I would not
  even revert to it, were it not a necessary preliminary to the circumstance I
  am about to detail.</p>

  <p>"When I left Oxford, I passed a few weeks alone, in London. A college
  friend, whom I accidentally met, introduced me, during a promenade in St.
  James's Park, to some acquaintances of his own, who were taking an airing in
  the Mall at the same time&mdash;a family whose name was Mowbray, consisting
  of a widow lady, her son, and daughter. This introduction was made in
  compliance with my own request. I had been struck by the singular beauty of
  the younger lady, whose countenance had a peculiar and inexpressible charm to
  me, from its marked resemblance to the portrait of the Lady Eleanor Rookwood,
  whose charms and unhappy fate I have so often dwelt upon and deplored. The
  picture is there," continued Ranulph, pointing to it: "look at it, and you
  have the fair creature I speak of before you; the color of the hair&mdash;the
  tenderness of the eyes. No&mdash;the expression is not so sad, except
  when&mdash;&mdash;but no matter! I recognized her features at once.</p>

  <p>"It struck me, that upon the mention of my name, the party betrayed some
  surprise, especially the elder lady. For my own part, I was so attracted by
  the beauty of the daughter, the effect of which upon me seemed rather the
  fulfilment of a predestined event, originating in the strange fascination
  which the family portrait had wrought in my heart, than the operation of what
  is called 'love at first sight,' that I was insensible to the agitation of
  the mother. In vain I endeavored to rally myself; my efforts at conversation
  were fruitless; I could not talk&mdash;all I could do was silently to yield
  to the soft witchery of those tender eyes; my admiration increasing each
  instant that I gazed upon them.</p>

  <p>"I accompanied them home. Attracted as by some irresistible spell, I could
  not tear myself away; so that, although I fancied I could perceive symptoms
  of displeasure in the looks of both the mother and the son, yet, regardless
  of consequences, I ventured, uninvited, to enter the house. In order to shake
  off the restraint which I felt my society imposed, I found it absolutely
  necessary to divest myself of bashfulness, and to exert such conversational
  powers as I possessed. I succeeded so well that the discourse soon became
  lively and animated; and what chiefly delighted me was, that <i>she</i>, for
  whose sake I had committed my present rudeness, became radiant with smiles. I
  had been all eagerness to seek for some explanation of the resemblance to
  which I have just alluded, and the fitting moment had, I conceived, arrived.
  I called attention to a peculiar expression in the features of Miss Mowbray,
  and then instanced the likeness that subsisted between her and my ancestress.
  'It is the more singular,' I said, turning to her mother, 'because there
  could have been no affinity, that I am aware of, between them, and yet the
  likeness is really surprising.'&mdash;'It is not so singular as you imagine,'
  answered Mrs. Mowbray; 'there <i>is</i> a close affinity. That Lady Rookwood
  was my mother. Eleanor Mowbray <i>does</i> resemble her ill-fated
  ancestress.'</p>

  <p>"Words cannot paint my astonishment. I gazed at Mrs. Mowbray, considering
  whether I had not misconstrued her speech&mdash;whether I had not so shaped
  the sounds as to suit my own quick and passionate conceptions. But no! I read
  in her calm, collected countenance&mdash;in the downcast glance, and sudden
  sadness of Eleanor, as well as in the changed and haughty demeanor of the
  brother, that I had heard her rightly. Eleanor Mowbray was my
  cousin&mdash;the descendant of that hapless creature whose image I had almost
  worshipped.</p>

  <p>"Recovering from my surprise, I addressed Mrs. Mowbray, endeavoring to
  excuse my ignorance of our relationship, on the plea that I had not been
  given to understand that such had been the name of the gentleman she had
  espoused. 'Nor was it,' answered she, 'the name he bore at Rookwood;
  circumstances forbade it then. From the hour I quitted that house until this
  moment, excepting one interview with my&mdash;with Sir Reginald
  Rookwood&mdash;I have seen none of my family&mdash;have held no communication
  with them. My brothers have been strangers to me; the very name of Rookwood
  has been unheard, unknown; nor would you have been admitted here, had not
  accident occasioned it.' I ventured now to interrupt her, and to express a
  hope that she would suffer an acquaintance to be kept up, which had so
  fortunately commenced, and which might most probably bring about an entire
  reconciliation between the families. I was so earnest in my expostulations,
  my whole soul being in them, that she inclined a more friendly ear to me.
  Eleanor, too, smiled encouragement. Love lent me eloquence; and at length, as
  a token of my success, and her own relenting, Mrs. Mowbray held forth her
  hand: I clasped it eagerly. It was the happiest moment of my life.</p>

  <p>"I will not trouble you with any lengthened description of Eleanor
  Mowbray. I hope, at some period or other, you may still be enabled to see
  her, and judge for yourself; for though adverse circumstances have hitherto
  conspired to separate us, the time for a renewal of our acquaintance is
  approaching, I trust, for I am not yet altogether without hope. But this much
  I may be allowed to say, that her rare endowments of person were only
  equalled by the graces of her mind.</p>

  <p>"Educated abroad, she had all the vivacity of our livelier neighbors,
  combined with every solid qualification which we claim as more essentially
  our own. Her light and frolic manner was French, certainly; but her gentle,
  sincere heart was as surely English. The foreign accent that dwelt upon her
  tongue communicated an inexpressible charm, even to the language which she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"I will not dwell too long upon this theme. I feel ashamed of my own
  prolixity. And yet I am sure you will pardon it. Ah, those bright brief days!
  too quickly were they fled! I could expatiate upon each minute&mdash;recall
  each word&mdash;revive each look. It may not be. I must hasten on. Darker
  themes await me.</p>

  <p>"My love made rapid progress&mdash;I became each hour more enamored of my
  new-found cousin. My whole time was passed near her; indeed, I could scarcely
  exist in absence from her side. Short, however, was destined to be my
  indulgence in this blissful state. One happy week was its extent. I received
  a peremptory summons from my father to return home.</p>

  <p>"Immediately upon commencing this acquaintance, I had written to my
  father, explaining every particular attending it. This I should have done of
  my own free will, but I was urged to it by Mrs. Mowbray. Unaccustomed to
  disguise, I had expatiated upon the beauty of Eleanor, and in such terms, I
  fear, that I excited some uneasiness in his breast. His letter was laconic.
  He made no allusion to the subject upon which I had expatiated when writing
  to him. He commanded me to return.</p>

  <p>"The bitter hour was at hand. I could not hesitate to comply. Without my
  father's sanction, I was assured Mrs. Mowbray would not permit any
  continuance of my acquaintance. Of Eleanor's inclinations I fancied I had
  some assurance; but without her mother's consent, to whose will she was
  devoted, I felt, had I even been inclined to urge it, that my suit was
  hopeless. The letter which I had received from my father made me more than
  doubt whether I should not find him utterly adverse to my wishes. Agonized,
  therefore, with a thousand apprehensions, I presented myself on the morning
  of my departure. It was then I made the declaration of my passion to Eleanor;
  it was then that every hope was confirmed, every apprehension realized. I
  received from her lips a confirmation of my fondest wishes; yet were those
  hopes blighted in the bud, when I heard, at the same time, that their
  consummation was dependent on the will of two others, whose assenting voices,
  she feared, could never be obtained. From Mrs. Mowbray I received a more
  decided reply. All her haughtiness was aroused. Her farewell words assured
  me, that it was indifferent to her whether we met again as relatives or as
  strangers. Then was it that the native tenderness of Eleanor displayed
  itself, in an outbreak of feeling peculiar to a heart keenly sympathetic as
  hers. She saw my suffering&mdash;the reserve natural to her sex gave
  way&mdash;she flung herself into my arms&mdash;and so we parted.</p>

  <p>"With a heavy foreboding I returned to Rookwood, and, oppressed with the
  gloomiest anticipations, endeavored to prepare myself for the worst. I
  arrived. My reception was such as I had calculated upon; and, to increase my
  distress, my parents had been at variance. I will not pain you and myself
  with any recital of their disagreement. My mother had espoused my cause,
  chiefly, I fear, with the view of thwarting my poor father's inclinations. He
  was in a terrible mood, exasperated by the fiery stimulants he had swallowed,
  which had not indeed, drowned his reason, but roused and inflamed every
  dormant emotion to violence. He was as one insane. It was evening when I
  arrived. I would willingly have postponed the interview till the morrow. It
  could not be. He insisted upon seeing me.</p>

  <p>"My mother was present. You know the restraint she usually had over my
  father, and how she maintained it. On this occasion she had none. He
  questioned me as to every particular; probed my secret soul; dragged forth
  every latent feeling, and then thundered out his own determination that
  Eleanor never should be bride of mine; nor would he receive, under his roof,
  her mother, the discountenanced daughter of his father. I endeavored to
  remonstrate with him. He was deaf to my entreaties. My mother added sharp and
  stinging words to my expostulations. 'I had her consent,' she said; 'what
  more was needed? The lands were entailed. I should at no distant period be
  their master, and might then please myself.' This I mention in order to give
  you my father's strange answer.</p>

  <p>"'Have a care, madam,' replied he, 'and bridle your tongue; they
  <i>are</i> entailed, 'tis true, but I need not ask <i>his</i> consent to cut
  off that entail. Let him dare to disobey me in this particular, and I will so
  divert the channel of my wealth, that no drop shall reach him. I
  will&mdash;but why threaten?&mdash;let him do it, and approve the
  consequences.'</p>

  <p>"On the morrow I renewed my importunities, with no better success. We were
  alone.</p>

  <p>"'Ranulph,' said he, 'you waste time in seeking to change my resolution.
  It is unalterable. I have many motives which influence me; they are
  inexplicable, but imperative. Eleanor Mowbray never can be yours. Forget her
  as speedily as may be, and I pledge myself, upon whomsoever else your choice
  may fix, I will offer no obstacle.'</p>

  <p>"'But why,' exclaimed I, with vehemence, 'do you object to one whom you
  have never beheld? At least, consent to see her.'</p>

  <p>"'Never!' he replied, 'The tie is sundered, and cannot be reunited; my
  father bound me by an oath never to meet in friendship with my sister; I will
  not break my vow, I will not violate its conditions, even in the second
  degree. We never can meet again. An idle prophecy which I have heard has said
  "<i>that when a Rookwood shall marry a Rookwood the end of the house draweth
  nigh</i>." That I regard not. It may have no meaning, or it may have much. To
  me it imports nothing further, than that, if you wed Eleanor, every acre I
  possess shall depart from you. And assure yourself this is no idle threat. I
  can, and will do it. My curse shall be your sole inheritance.'</p>

  <p>"I could not avoid making some reply, representing to him how
  unjustifiable such a procedure was to me, in a case where the happiness of my
  life was at stake; and how inconsistent it was with the charitable precepts
  of our faith, to allow feelings of resentment to influence his conduct. My
  remonstrances, as in the preceding meeting, were ineffectual. The more I
  spoke, the more intemperate he grew. I therefore desisted, but not before he
  had ordered me to quit the house. I did not leave the neighborhood, but saw
  him again on the same evening.</p>

  <p>"Our last interview took place in the garden. I then told him that I had
  determined to go abroad for two years, at the expiration of which period I
  proposed returning to England; trusting that his resolution might then be
  changed, and that he would listen to my request, for the fulfilment of which
  I could never cease to hope. Time, I hoped, might befriend me. He approved of
  my plan of travelling, requesting me not to see Eleanor before I set out;
  adding, in a melancholy tone&mdash;'We may never meet again, Ranulph, in this
  life; in that case, farewell forever. Indulge no vain hopes. Eleanor never
  can be yours, but upon one condition, and to that you would never
  consent!'&mdash;'Propose it!' I cried; 'there is no condition I could not
  accede to.'&mdash;'Rash boy!' he replied, 'you know not what you say; that
  pledge you would never fulfil, were I to propose it to you; but
  no&mdash;should I survive till you return, you shall learn it then&mdash;and
  now, farewell.'&mdash;'Speak now, I beseech you!' I exclaimed; 'anything,
  everything&mdash;what you will!'&mdash;'Say no more,' replied he, walking
  towards the house; 'when you return we will renew this subject;
  farewell&mdash;perhaps forever!' His words were prophetic&mdash;that parting
  <i>was</i> forever. I remained in the garden till nightfall. I saw my mother,
  but <i>he</i> came not again. I quitted England without beholding
  Eleanor."</p>

  <p>"Did you not acquaint her by letter with what had occurred, and your
  consequent intentions?" asked Small.</p>

  <p>"I did," replied Ranulph; "but I received no reply. My earliest inquiries
  will be directed to ascertain whether the family are still in London. It will
  be a question for our consideration, whether I am not justified in departing
  from my father's expressed wishes, or whether I should violate his commands
  in so doing."</p>

  <p>"We will discuss that point hereafter," replied Small; adding, as he
  noticed the growing paleness of his companion, "you are too much exhausted to
  proceed&mdash;you had better defer the remainder of your story to a future
  period."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Ranulph, swallowing a glass of water; "I am exhausted, yet I
  cannot rest&mdash;my blood is in a fever, which nothing will allay. I shall
  feel more easy when I have made the present communication. I am approaching
  the sequel of my narrative. You are now in possession of the story of my
  love&mdash;of the motive of my departure. You shall learn what was the
  occasion of my return.</p>

  <p>"I had wandered from city to city during my term of exile&mdash;consumed
  by hopeless passion&mdash;with little that could amuse <i>me</i>, though
  surrounded by a thousand objects of interest to others, and only rendering
  life endurable by severest study or most active exertion. My steps conducted
  me to Bordeaux;&mdash;there I made a long halt, enchanted by the beauty of
  the neighboring scenery. My fancy was smitten by the situation of a villa on
  the banks of the Garonne, within a few leagues of the city. It was an old
  château, with fine gardens bordering the blue waters of the river, and
  commanding a multitude of enchanting prospects. The house, which had in part
  gone to decay, was inhabited by an aged couple, who had formerly been
  servants to an English family, the members of which had thus provided for
  them on their return to their own country. I inquired the name. Conceive my
  astonishment to find that this château had been the residence of the
  Mowbrays. This intelligence decided me at once&mdash;I took up my abode in
  the house; and a new and unexpected source of solace and delight was opened
  to me, I traced the paths she had traced; occupied the room she had occupied;
  tended the flowers she had tended; and, on the golden summer evenings, would
  watch the rapid waters, tinged with all the glorious hues of sunset, sweeping
  past my feet, and think how <i>she</i> had watched them. Her presence seemed
  to pervade the place. I was now comparatively happy, and, anxious to remain
  unmolested, wrote home that I was leaving Bordeaux for the Pyrenees, on my
  way to Spain."</p>

  <p>"That account arrived," observed Small.</p>

  <p>"One night," continued Ranulph&mdash;"'tis now the sixth since the
  occurrence I am about to relate&mdash;I was seated in a bower that overlooked
  the river. It had been a lovely evening&mdash;so lovely, that I lingered
  there, wrapped in the heavenly contemplation of its beauties. I watched each
  rosy tint reflected upon the surface of the rapid stream&mdash;now fading
  into yellow&mdash;now shining silvery white. I noticed the mystic mingling of
  twilight with darkness&mdash;of night with day, till the bright current on a
  sudden became a black mass of waters. I could scarcely discern a
  leaf&mdash;all was darkness&mdash;when lo! another change! The moon was
  up&mdash;a flood of light deluged all around&mdash;the stream was dancing
  again in reflected radiance, and I still lingering at its brink.</p>

  <p>"I had been musing for some moments, with my head resting upon my hand,
  when, happening to raise my eyes, I beheld a figure immediately before me. I
  was astonished at the sight, for I had perceived no one approach&mdash;had
  heard no footstep advance towards me, and was satisfied that no one besides
  myself could be in the garden. The presence of the figure inspired me with an
  undefinable awe! and, I can scarce tell why, but a thrilling presentiment
  convinced me that it was a supernatural visitant. Without
  motion&mdash;without life&mdash;without substance, it seemed; yet still the
  outward character of life was there. I started to my feet. God! what did I
  behold? The face was turned to me&mdash;my father's face! And what an aspect,
  what a look! Time can never efface that terrible expression; it is graven
  upon my memory&mdash;I cannot describe it. It was not anger&mdash;it was not
  pain: it was as if an eternity of woe were stamped upon its features. It was
  too dreadful to behold, I would fain have averted my gaze&mdash;my eyes were
  fascinated&mdash;fixed&mdash;I could not withdraw them from the ghastly
  countenance. I shrank from it, yet stirred not&mdash;I could not move a limb.
  Noiselessly gliding towards me, the apparition approached. I could not
  retreat. It stood obstinately beside me. I became as one half-dead. The
  phantom shook its head with the deepest despair; and as the word 'Return!'
  sounded hollowly in my ears, it gradually melted from my view. I cannot tell
  how I recovered from the swoon into which I fell, but daybreak saw me on my
  way to England. I am here. On that night&mdash;at that same hour, my father
  died."</p>

  <p>"It was, after all, then, a supernatural summons that you received?" said
  Small.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," replied Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Humph!&mdash;the coincidence, I own, is sufficiently curious," returned
  Small, musingly; "but it would not be difficult, I think, to discover a
  satisfactory explanation of the delusion."</p>

  <p>"There was no delusion," replied Ranulph, coldly; "the figure was as
  palpable as your own. Can I doubt, when I behold this result? Could any
  deceit have been practised upon me, at that distance?&mdash;the precise time,
  moreover, agreeing. Did not the phantom bid me return?&mdash;I <i>have</i>
  returned&mdash;he is dead. I have gazed upon a being of another world. To
  doubt were impious, after that look."</p>

  <p>"Whatever my opinions may be, my dear young friend," returned Small,
  gravely, "I will suspend them for the present. You are still greatly excited.
  Let me advise you to seek some repose."</p>

  <p>"I am easier," replied Ranulph; "but you are right, I will endeavor to
  snatch a little rest. Something within tells me all is not yet accomplished.
  What remains?&mdash;I shudder to think of it. I will rejoin you at midnight.
  I shall myself attend the solemnity. Adieu!"</p>

  <p>Ranulph quitted the room. Small sighingly shook his head, and having
  lighted his pipe, was presently buried in a profundity of smoke and
  metaphysical speculation.</p>

    <p class="quote">&mdash; <i>The White Devil.</i></p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">THE progress of our narrative demands our presence in
  another apartment of the hall&mdash;a large, lonesome chamber, situate in the
  eastern wing of the house, already described as the most ancient part of the
  building&mdash;the sombre appearance of which was greatly increased by the
  dingy, discolored tapestry that clothed its walls; the record of the patience
  and industry of a certain Dame Dorothy Rookwood, who flourished some
  centuries ago, and whose skilful needle had illustrated the slaughter of the
  Innocents, with a severity of <i>gusto</i>, and sanguinary minuteness of
  detail, truly surprising in a lady so amiable as she was represented to have
  been. Grim-visaged Herod glared from the ghostly woof, with his shadowy
  legions, executing their murderous purposes, grouped like a troop of
  Sabbath-dancing witches around him. Mysterious twilight, admitted through the
  deep, dark, mullioned windows, revealed the antique furniture of the room,
  which still boasted a sort of mildewed splendor, more imposing, perhaps, than
  its original gaudy magnificence; and showed the lofty hangings, and tall,
  hearse-like canopy of a bedstead, once a couch of state, but now destined for
  the repose of Lady Rookwood. The stiff crimson hangings were embroidered in
  gold, with the arms and cipher of Elizabeth, from whom the apartment, having
  once been occupied by that sovereign, obtained the name of the "Queen's
  Room."</p>

  <p>The sole tenant of this chamber was a female, in whose countenance, if
  time and strong emotion had written strange defeatures, they had not
  obliterated its striking beauty and classical grandeur of expression. It was
  a face majestical and severe. Pride was stamped in all its lines; and though
  each passion was, by turns, developed, it was evident that all were
  subordinate to the sin by which the angels fell. The contour of her face was
  formed in the purest Grecian mould, and might have been a model for Medea; so
  well did the gloomy grandeur of the brow, the severe chiselling of the lip,
  the rounded beauty of the throat, and the faultless symmetry of her full
  form, accord with the beau ideal of antique perfection. Shaded by smooth
  folds of raven hair, which still maintained its jetty dye, her lofty forehead
  would have been displayed to the greatest advantage, had it not been at this
  moment knit and deformed by excess of passion, if that passion can be said to
  deform which only calls forth strong and vehement expression. Her figure,
  which wanted only height to give it dignity, was arrayed in the garb of
  widowhood; and if she exhibited none of the desolation of heart which such a
  bereavement might have been expected to awaken, she was evidently a prey to
  feelings scarcely less harrowing. At the particular time of which we speak,
  Lady Rookwood, for she it was, was occupied in the investigation of the
  contents of an escritoire. Examining the papers which it contained with great
  deliberation, she threw each aside, as soon as she had satisfied herself of
  its purport, until she arrived at a little package, carefully tied up with
  black ribbon, and sealed. This, Lady Rookwood hastily broke open, and drew
  forth a small miniature. It was that of a female, young and beautiful,
  rudely, yet faithfully, executed&mdash;faithfully, we say, for there was an
  air of sweetness and simplicity&mdash;and, in short, a look of reality and
  nature about the picture (it is seldom, indeed, that we mistake a likeness,
  even if we are unacquainted with the original) that attested the artist's
  fidelity. The face was as radiant with smiles as a bright day with sunbeams.
  The portrait was set in gold, and behind it was looped a lock of the darkest
  and finest hair. Underneath the miniature was written, in Sir Piers's hand,
  the words "<i>Lady Rookwood</i>." A slip of folded paper was also attached to
  it.</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood scornfully scrutinized the features for a few moments, and
  then unfolded the paper, at the sight of which she started, and turned pale.
  "Thank God!" she cried, "this is in my possession&mdash;while I hold this, we
  are safe. Were it not better to destroy this evidence at once? No, no, not
  <i>now</i>&mdash;it shall not part from me. I will abide Ranulph's return.
  This document will give me a power over him such as I could never otherwise
  obtain." Placing the marriage certificate, for such it was, within her
  breast, and laying the miniature upon the table, she next proceeded,
  deliberately, to arrange the disordered contents of the box.</p>

  <p>All outward traces of emotion had, ere this, become so subdued in Lady
  Rookwood, that although she had, only a few moments previously, exhibited the
  extremity of passionate indignation, she now, apparently without effort,
  resumed entire composure, and might have been supposed to be engaged in a
  matter of little interest to herself. It was a dread calm, which they who
  knew her would have trembled to behold. "From these letters I gather,"
  exclaimed she, "that their wretched offspring knows not of his fortune. So
  far, well. There is no channel whence he can derive information, and my first
  care shall be to prevent his obtaining any clue to the secret of his birth. I
  am directed to provide for him&mdash;ha! ha! I will provide&mdash;a grave!
  There will I bury him and his secret. My son's security and my own wrong
  demand it. I must choose surer hands&mdash;the work must not be half-done, as
  heretofore. And now, I bethink me, he is in the neighborhood, connected with
  a gang of poachers&mdash;'tis as I could wish it."</p>

  <p>At this moment a knock at the chamber-door broke upon her meditations.
  "Agnes, is it you?" demanded Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>Thus summoned, the old attendant entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Why are my orders disobeyed?" asked the lady, in a severe tone of voice.
  "Did I not say, when you delivered me this package from Mr. Coates, which he
  himself wished to present, that I would not be disturbed?"</p>

  <p>"You did, my lady, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Speak out," said Lady Rookwood, somewhat more mildly, perceiving, from
  Agnes's manner, that she had something of importance to communicate. "What is
  it brings you hither?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," returned Agnes, "to disturb your ladyship,
  but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?" interrupted Lady Rookwood, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I could not help it, my lady&mdash;he would have me come; he said he was
  resolved to see your ladyship, whether you would or not."</p>

  <p>"Would see me, ha! is it so? I guess his errand, and its object&mdash;he
  has some suspicion. No, that cannot be; he would not dare to tamper with
  these seals. Agnes, I will <i>not</i> see him."</p>

  <p>"But he swears, my lady, that he will not leave the house without seeing
  you&mdash;he would have forced his way into your presence, if I had not
  consented to announce him."</p>

  <p>"Insolent!" exclaimed Lady Rookwood, with a glance of indignation; "force
  his way! I promise you he shall not display an equal anxiety to repeat the
  visit. Tell Mr. Coates I will see him."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coates! Mercy on us, my lady, it's not he. He'd never have intruded
  upon you unasked. No such thing. He knows his place too well. No, no; it's
  not Mr. Coates&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If not he, who is it?"</p>

  <p>"Luke Bradley; your ladyship knows whom I mean."</p>

  <p>"He here&mdash;now?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, my lady; and looking so fierce and strange, I was quite frightened
  to see him. He looked so like his&mdash;his&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"His father, you would say. Speak out."</p>

  <p>"No, my lady, his grandfather&mdash;old Sir Reginald. He's the very image
  of him. But had not your ladyship better ring the alarm-bell? and when he
  comes in, I'll run and fetch the servants&mdash;he's dangerous, I'm
  sure."</p>

  <p>"I have no fears of him. He <i>will</i> see me, you say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ay, <i>will</i>!" exclaimed Luke, as he threw open the door, and shut it
  forcibly after him, striding towards Lady Rookwood, "nor abide longer
  delay."</p>

  <p>It was an instant or two ere Lady Rookwood, thus taken by surprise, could
  command speech. She fixed her eyes with a look of keen and angry inquiry upon
  the bold intruder, who, nothing daunted, confronted her glances with a gaze
  as stern and steadfast as her own.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what seek you?" exclaimed Lady Rookwood, after a brief
  pause, and, in spite of herself, her voice sounded tremulously. "What would
  you have, that you venture to appear before me at this season and in this
  fashion?"</p>

  <p>"I might have chosen a fitter opportunity," returned Luke, "were it
  needed. My business will not brook delay&mdash;you must be pleased to
  overlook this intrusion on your privacy, at a season of sorrow like the
  present. As to the fashion of my visit, you must be content to excuse it. I
  cannot help myself. I may amend hereafter. Who I am, you are able, I doubt
  not, to divine. What I seek, you shall hear, when this old woman has left the
  room, unless you would have a witness to a declaration that concerns you as
  nearly as myself."</p>

  <p>An indefinite feeling of apprehension had, from the first instant of
  Luke's entrance crossed Lady Rookwood's mind. She, however, answered, with
  some calmness:</p>

  <p>"What you can have to say is of small moment to me&mdash;nor does it
  signify who may hear it. It shall not, however, be said that Lady Rookwood
  feared to be alone, even though she endangered her life."</p>

  <p>"I am no assassin," replied Luke, "nor have sought the destruction of my
  deadliest foe&mdash;though 'twere but retributive justice to have done
  so."</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood started.</p>

  <p>"Nay, you need not fear me," replied Luke; "my revenge will be otherwise
  accomplished."</p>

  <p>"Go," said Lady Rookwood to Agnes; "yet&mdash;stay without, in the
  antechamber."</p>

  <p>"My lady," said Agnes, scarcely able to articulate, "shall
  I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Lady Rookwood," interrupted Luke. "I repeat, I intend you no
  injury. My object here is solely to obtain a private conference. You can have
  no reason for denying me this request. I will not abuse your patience. Mine
  is no idle mission. Say you refuse me, and I will at once depart. I will find
  other means of communicating with you&mdash;less direct, and therefore less
  desirable. Make your election. But we <i>must</i> be alone&mdash;undisturbed.
  Summon your household&mdash;let them lay hands upon me, and I will proclaim
  aloud what you would gladly hide, even from yourself."</p>

  <p>"Leave us, Agnes," said Lady Rookwood. "I have no fear of this man. I can
  deal with him myself, should I see occasion."</p>

  <p>"Agnes," said Luke, in a stern, deep whisper, arresting the ancient
  handmaiden as she passed him, "stir not from the door till I come forth. Have
  you forgotten your former mistress!&mdash;my mother? Have you forgotten
  Barbara Lovel, and <i>that night</i>?"</p>

  <p>"In Heaven's name, hush!" replied Agnes, with a shudder.</p>

  <p>"Let that be fresh in your memory. Move not a footstep, whatever you may
  hear," added he, in the same tone as before.</p>

  <p>"I will not&mdash;I will not." And Agnes departed.</p>

  <p>Luke felt some wavering in his resolution when he found himself alone with
  the lady, whose calm, collected, yet haughty demeanor, as she resumed her
  seat, prepared for his communication, could not fail to inspire him with a
  certain degree of awe. Not unconscious of her advantage, nor slow to profit
  by it, Lady Rookwood remained perfectly silent, with her eyes steadily fixed
  upon his face, while his embarrassment momentarily increased. Summoning, at
  length, courage sufficient to address her, and ashamed of his want of nerve,
  he thus broke forth:</p>

  <p>"When I entered this room, you asked my name and object. As to the first,
  I answer to the same designation as your ladyship. I have long borne my
  mother's name. I now claim my father's. My object is, the restitution of my
  rights."</p>

  <p>"Soh!&mdash;it is as I suspected," thought Lady Rookwood, involuntarily
  casting her large eyes down. "Do I hear you rightly?" exclaimed she, aloud;
  "your name is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Sir Luke Rookwood. As my father's elder born; by right of <i>his</i>right
  to that title."</p>

  <p>If a glance could have slain him, Luke had fallen lifeless at the lady's
  feet. With a smile of ineffable disdain, she replied, "I know not why I
  hesitate to resent this indignity, even for an instant. But I would see how
  far your audacity will carry you. The name you bear is Bradley?"</p>

  <p>"In ignorance I have done so," replied Luke. "I am the son of her whose
  maiden name was Bradley. She was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Tis false&mdash;I will not hear it&mdash;she was <i>not</i>," cried Lady
  Rookwood, her vehemence getting the master of her prudence.</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship anticipates my meaning," returned Luke. "Susan Bradley was
  the first wife of Sir Piers Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"His minion&mdash;his mistress if you will; nought else. Is it new to you,
  that a village wench, who lends herself to shame, should be beguiled by such
  shallow pretences? That she was so duped, I doubt not. But it is too late now
  to complain, and I would counsel you not to repeat your idle boast. It will
  serve no other purpose, trust me, than to blazon forth your own&mdash;your
  mother's dishonor."</p>

  <p>"Lady Rookwood," sternly answered Luke, "my mother's fame is as free from
  dishonor as your own. I repeat, she was the first wife of Sir Piers; and that
  I, her child, am first in the inheritance; nay, sole heir to the estates and
  title of Rookwood, to the exclusion of your son. Ponder upon that
  intelligence. Men say they fear you, as a thing of ill. <i>I</i> fear you
  not. There <i>have</i> been days when the Rookwoods held their dames in
  subjection. Discern you nought of that in me?"</p>

  <p>Once or twice during this speech Lady Rookwood's glances had wandered
  towards the bell-cord, as if about to summon aid; but the intention was
  abandoned almost as soon as formed, probably from apprehension of the
  consequences of any such attempt. She was not without alarm as to the result
  of the interview, and was considering how she could bring it to a termination
  without endangering herself, and, if possible, secure the person of Luke,
  when the latter, turning sharply round upon her, and drawing a pistol,
  exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Follow me!"</p>

  <p>"Whither?" asked she, in alarm.</p>

  <p>"To the chamber of death!"</p>

  <p>"Why there? what would you do? Villain! I will not trust my life with you.
  I will <i>not</i> follow you."</p>

  <p>"Hesitate not, as you value your life. Do aught to alarm the house, and I
  fire. Your safety depends upon yourself. I would see my father's body ere it
  be laid in the grave. I will not leave you here."</p>

  <p>"Go," said Lady Rookwood; "if that be all, I pledge myself you shall not
  be interrupted."</p>

  <p>"I will not take your pledge; your presence shall be my surety. By my
  mother's unavenged memory, if you play me false, though all your satellites
  stand around you, you die upon the spot! Obey me, and you are safe. Our way
  leads to the room by the private staircase&mdash;we shall pass
  unobserved&mdash;you see I know the road. The room, by your own command, is
  vacant&mdash;save of the dead. We shall, therefore, be alone. This done, I
  depart. You will then be free to act. Disobey me, and your blood be upon your
  own head."</p>

  <p>"Lead on!" said Lady Rookwood, pressing towards the antechamber.</p>

  <p>"The door I mean is there," pointing to another part of the
  room&mdash;"that panel,&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ha! how know you that?"</p>

  <p>"No matter; follow."</p>

  <p>Luke touched a spring, and the panel flying open, disclosed a dim recess,
  into which he entered; and, seizing Lady Rookwood's hand, dragged her after
  him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch1-12"
     name="ch1-12"></a>CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE CHAMBER OF DEATH</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">It is the body&mdash;I have orders given<br>
  That here it should be laid.<br>
  &mdash; <i>De Montfort.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE recess upon which the panel opened had been a small
  oratory, and, though entirely disused, still retained its cushions and its
  crucifix. There were two other entrances to this place of prayer, the one
  communicating with a further bedchamber, the other leading to the gallery.
  Through the latter, after closing the aperture, without relinquishing his
  grasp, Luke passed.</p>

  <p>It was growing rapidly dark, and at the brightest seasons this gloomy
  corridor was but imperfectly lighted from narrow, painted, and wire-protected
  windows that looked into the old quadrangular courtyard below; and as they
  issued from the oratory a dazzling flash of lightning&mdash;a storm having
  suddenly arisen&mdash;momentarily illumined the whole length of the passage,
  disclosing the retreating figure of a man, wrapped in a large sable cloak, at
  the other extremity of the gallery. Lady Rookwood uttered an outcry for
  assistance; but the man, whoever he might be, disappeared in the
  instantaneously succeeding gloom, leaving her in doubt whether or not her
  situation had been perceived. Luke had seen this dark figure at the same
  instant; and, not without apprehensions lest his plans should be defeated, he
  griped Lady Rookwood's arm still more strictly, and placing the muzzle of the
  pistol to her breast, hurried her rapidly forwards.</p>

  <p>All was now in total obscurity; the countenance of neither could be
  perceived as they trod the dark passage; but Luke's unrelaxed grasp indicated
  no change in his purposes, nor did the slow, dignified march of the lady
  betray any apprehension on her part. Descending a spiral staircase, which led
  from the gallery to a lower story, their way now lay beneath the
  entrance-hall, a means of communication little used. Their tread sounded
  hollowly on the flagged floor; no other sound was heard. Mounting a
  staircase, similar to the one they had just descended, they arrived at
  another passage. A few paces brought them to the door. Luke turned the
  handle, and they stood within the chamber of the dead.</p>

  <p>The room which contained the remains of poor Sir Piers was arrayed in all
  that mockery of state which, vainly attempting to deride death, is itself a
  bitter derision of the living. It was the one devoted to the principal meals
  of the day; a strange choice, but convenience had dictated its adoption by
  those with whom this part of the ceremonial had originated, and long custom
  had rendered its usage, for this purpose, almost prescriptive. This room,
  which was of some size, had originally formed part of the great hall, from
  which it was divided by a thick screen of black, lustrously varnished oak,
  enriched with fanciful figures carved in bold relief. The walls were panelled
  with the same embrowned material, and sustained sundry portraits of the
  members of the family, in every possible costume, from the steely gear of Sir
  Ranulph, down to the flowing attire of Sir Reginald. Most of the race were
  ranged around the room; and, seen in the yellow light shed upon their
  features by the flambeaux, they looked like an array of stern and silent
  witnesses, gazing upon their departed descendant. The sides of the chamber
  were hung with black cloth, and upon a bier in the middle of the room rested
  the body. Broad escutcheons, decked out in glowing colors pompously set forth
  the heraldic honors of the departed. Tall lights burned at the head and feet,
  and fragrant perfumes diffused their odors from silver censers.</p>

  <p>The entrance of Luke and his unwilling companion had been abrupt. The
  transition from darkness to the glare of light was almost blinding, and they
  had advanced far into the room ere Lady Rookwood perceived a man, whom she
  took to be one of the mutes, leaning over the bier. The coffin-lid was
  entirely removed, and the person, whose back was towards them appeared to be
  wrapped in mournful contemplation of the sad spectacle before him. Suddenly
  bursting from Luke's hold, Lady Rookwood rushed forward with a scream, and
  touched the man's shoulder. He started at the summons, and disclosed the
  features of her son!</p>

  <p>Rapidly as her own act, Luke followed. He levelled a pistol at her head,
  but his hand dropped to his side as he encountered the glance of Ranulph. All
  three seemed paralyzed by surprise. Ranulph, in astonishment, extended his
  arm to his mother, who, placing one arm over his shoulder, pointed with the
  other to Luke; the latter stared sternly and inquiringly at both&mdash;yet
  none spoke.</p>

  <p class="first">WITH that quickness of perception which at once supplies
  information on such an emergency, Luke instantly conjectured who was before
  him. Startled as he was, he yet retained his composure, abiding the result
  with his arms folded upon his breast.</p>

  <p>"Seize him!" cried Lady Rookwood, as soon as she could command her
  speech.</p>

  <p>"He rushes on his death if he stirs," exclaimed Luke, pointing his
  pistol.</p>

  <p>"Bethink you where you are, villain!" cried Ranulph; "you are entrapped in
  your own toils. Submit yourself to our mercy&mdash;resistance is vain, and
  will not secure your safety, while it will aggravate your offence. Surrender
  yourself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never!" answered Luke. "Know you whom you ask to yield?"</p>

  <p>"How should I?" answered Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"By that instinct which tells me who <i>you</i> are. Ask Lady
  Rookwood&mdash;she can inform you, if she will."</p>

  <p>"Parley not with him&mdash;seize him!" cried Lady Rookwood. "He is a
  robber, a murderer, who has assailed my life."</p>

  <p>"Beware!" said Luke to Ranulph, who was preparing to obey his mother's
  commands; "I am no robber&mdash;no murderer. Do not you make me a
  fratricide."</p>

  <p>"Fratricide!" echoed Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Heed him not," ejaculated Lady Rookwood. "It is false&mdash;he dares not
  harm thee, for his soul. I will call assistance."</p>

  <p>"Hold, mother!" exclaimed Ranulph, detaining Lady Rookwood; "this man may
  be what he represents himself. Before we proceed to extremities, I would
  question him. I would not have mentioned it in your hearing could it have
  been avoided, but my father had another son."</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood frowned. She would have checked him, but Luke
  rejoined&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You have spoken the truth; he had a son&mdash;I am he.
  I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be silent, I command you!" said Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"Death!" cried Luke, in a loud voice. "Why should I be silent at your
  bidding&mdash;at <i>yours</i>&mdash;who regard no laws, human or divine; who
  pursue your own fell purposes, without fear of God or man? Waste not your
  frowns on me&mdash;I heed them not. Do you think I am like a tame hound, to
  be cowed to silence? I <i>will</i> speak. Ranulph Rookwood, the name you bear
  is mine, and by a right as good as is your own. From his loins, who lies a
  corpse before us, I sprang. No brand of shame is on my birth. I am your
  father's son&mdash;his first-born&mdash;your <i>elder</i> brother. Hear me!"
  cried he, rushing to the bier. "By this body, I swear that I have avouched
  the truth&mdash;and though to me the dead Sir Piers Rookwood hath never been
  what a father should be to a son&mdash;though I have never known his smile,
  felt his caresses, or received his blessing, yet now be all forgiven, all
  forgotten." And he cast himself with frantic violence upon the coffin.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to describe the feelings with which Ranulph heard Luke's
  avowal. Amazement and dread predominated. Unable to stir, he stood gazing on
  in silence. Not so Lady Rookwood. The moment for action was arrived.
  Addressing her son in a low tone, she said, "Your prey is within your power.
  Secure him."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore?" rejoined Ranulph; "if he be my brother, shall I raise my hand
  against him?"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not?" returned Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"'Twere an accursed deed," replied Ranulph. "The mystery is resolved.
  'Twas for this that I was summoned home."</p>

  <p>"Ha! what say you? summoned! by whom?"</p>

  <p>"My father!"</p>

  <p>"Your father?" echoed Lady Rookwood, in great surprise.</p>

  <p>"Ay, my dead father! He has appeared to me since his decease."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph, you rave&mdash;you are distracted with grief&mdash;with
  astonishment."</p>

  <p>"No, mother; but I will not struggle against my destiny."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! your destiny is Rookwood, its manors, its lands, its rent-roll,
  and its title; nor shall you yield it to a base-born churl like this. Let him
  prove his rights. Let the law adjudge them to him, and we will
  yield&mdash;but not till then. I tell thee he has <i>not</i> the right, nor
  can he maintain it. He is a deluded dreamer, who, having heard some idle tale
  of his birth, believes it, because it chimes with his wishes. I treated him
  with the scorn he deserved. I would have driven him from my presence, but he
  was armed, as you see, and forced me hither, perhaps to murder me; a deed he
  might have accomplished had it not been for your intervention. His life is
  already forfeit, for an attempt of the same sort last night. Why else came he
  hither? for what else did he drag me to this spot? Let him answer that!"</p>

  <p>"I <i>will</i> answer it," replied Luke, raising himself from the
  bier.</p>

  <p>His face was ghastly as the corpse over which he leaned. "I had a deed to
  do, which I wished you to witness. It was a wild conception. But the means by
  which I have acquired the information of my rights were wild. Ranulph, we are
  both the slaves of fate. You have received your summons hither&mdash;I have
  had mine. Your father's ghost called you; my mother's spectral hand beckoned
  me. Both are arrived. One thing more remains, and my mission is completed."
  Saying which, he drew forth the skeleton hand; and having first taken the
  wedding-ring from the finger, he placed the withered limb upon the left
  breast of his father's body. "Rest there," he cried, "for ever."</p>

  <p>"Will you suffer that?" said Lady Rookwood, tauntingly, to her son.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Ranulph; "such profanation of the dead shall not be endured,
  were he ten times my brother. Stand aside," added he, advancing towards the
  bier, and motioning Luke away. "Withdraw your hand from my father's body, and
  remove what you have placed upon it."</p>

  <p>"I will neither remove it nor suffer it to be removed," returned Luke.
  "'Twas for that purpose I came hither. 'Twas to that hand he was united in
  life, in death he shall not be divided from it."</p>

  <p>"Such irreverence shall not be!" exclaimed Ranulph, seizing Luke with one
  hand, and snatching at the cereclothes with the other. "Remove it, or by
  Heaven&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Leave go your hold," said Luke, in a voice of thunder; "you strive in
  vain."</p>

  <p>Ranulph ineffectually attempted to push him backwards; and, shaking away
  the grasp that was fixed upon his collar, seized his brother's wrist, so as
  to prevent the accomplishment of his purpose. In this unnatural and
  indecorous strife the corpse of their father was reft of its covering and the
  hand discovered lying upon the pallid breast.</p>

  <p>And as if the wanton impiety of their conduct called forth an immediate
  rebuke, even from the dead, a frown seemed to pass over Sir Piers's features,
  as their angry glances fell in that direction. This startling effect was
  occasioned by the approach of Lady Rookwood, whose shadow, falling over the
  brow and visage of the deceased, produced the appearance we have described.
  Simultaneously quitting each other, with a deep sense of shame, mingled with
  remorse, both remained, their eyes fixed upon the dead, whose repose they had
  violated.</p>

  <p>Folding the graveclothes decently over the body, Luke prepared to
  depart.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Lady Rookwood; "you go not hence."</p>

  <p>"My brother Ranulph will not oppose my departure," returned Luke; "who
  else shall prevent it?"</p>

  <p>"That will I!" cried a sharp voice behind him; and, ere he could turn to
  ascertain from whom the exclamation proceeded, Luke felt himself grappled by
  two nervous assailants, who, snatching the pistol from his hold, fast
  pinioned his arms.</p>

  <p>This was scarcely the work of a moment, and he was a prisoner before he
  could offer any resistance. A strong smile of exultation evinced Lady
  Rookwood's satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Bravo, my lads, bravo!" cried Coates, stepping forward, for he it was
  under whose skilful superintendence the seizure had been effected: "famously
  managed; my father the thief-taker's runners couldn't have done it
  better&mdash;hand me that pistol&mdash;loaded, I see&mdash;slugs, no
  doubt&mdash;oh, he's a precious rascal&mdash;search him&mdash;turn his
  pockets inside out, while I speak to her ladyship." Saying which, the brisk
  attorney, enchanted with the feat he had performed, approached Lady Rookwood
  with a profound bow, and an amazing smirk of self-satisfaction. "Just in time
  to prevent mischief," said he; "hope your ladyship does not suffer any
  inconvenience from the alarm&mdash;beg pardon, annoyance I meant to
  say&mdash;which this horrible outrage must have occasioned; excessively
  disagreeable this sort of thing to a lady at any time, but at a period like
  this more than usually provoking. However, we have the villain safe enough.
  Very lucky I happened to be in the way. Perhaps your ladyship would like to
  know how I discovered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not now," replied Lady Rookwood, checking the volubility of the man of
  law. "I thank you, Mr. Coates, for the service you have rendered me; you will
  now add materially to the obligation by removing the prisoner with all
  convenient despatch."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, if your ladyship wishes it. Shall I detain him a close
  prisoner in the hall for the night, or remove him at once to the lock-up
  house in the village?"</p>

  <p>"Where you please, so you do it quickly," replied Lady Rookwood, noticing,
  with great uneasiness, the agitated manner of her son, and apprehensive lest,
  in the presence of so many witnesses, he might say or do something
  prejudicial to their interests. Nor were her fears groundless. As Coates was
  about to return to the prisoner, he was arrested by the voice of Ranulph,
  commanding him to stay.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coates," said he, "however appearances may be against this man, he is
  no robber&mdash;you must, therefore, release him."</p>

  <p>"Eh day, what's that? release him, Sir Ranulph?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; I tell you he came here neither with the intent to rob nor to
  offer violence."</p>

  <p>"That is false, Ranulph," replied Lady Rookwood. "I was dragged hither by
  him at the peril of my life. He is Mr. Coates's prisoner on another
  charge."</p>

  <p>"Unquestionably, your ladyship is perfectly right; I have a warrant
  against him for assaulting Hugh Badger, the keeper, and for other
  misdemeanors."</p>

  <p>"I will myself be responsible for his appearance to that charge," replied
  Ranulph. "Now, sir, at once release him."</p>

  <p>"At your peril!" exclaimed Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"Well, really," muttered the astonished attorney, "this is the most
  perplexing proceeding I ever witnessed."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph," said Lady Rookwood, sternly, to her son, "beware how you thwart
  me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Sir Ranulph, let me venture to advise you, as a friend, not to
  thwart her ladyship," whispered the attorney; "indeed, she is in the right."
  But seeing his advice unheeded, Coates withdrew to a little distance.</p>

  <p>"I will not see injustice done to my father's son," replied Ranulph, in a
  low tone. "Why would you detain him?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" returned she, "our safety demands it&mdash;our honor."</p>

  <p>"Our honor demands his instant liberation; each moment he remains in those
  bonds sullies its purity. I will free him myself from his fetters."</p>

  <p>"And brave my curse, foolish boy? You incurred your miserable father's
  anathema for a lighter cause than this. Our honor cries aloud for his
  destruction. Have I not been injured in the nicest point a woman can be
  injured? Shall I lend my name to mockery and scorn, by base acknowledgment of
  such deceit, or will you? Where would be my honor, then, stripped of my fair
  estates&mdash;my son&mdash;myself&mdash;beggars&mdash;dependent on the bounty
  of an upstart? Does honor ask you to bear this? It is a phantom sense of
  honor, unsubstantial as your father's shade, of which you just now spoke,
  that would prompt you to do otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Do not evoke his awful spirit, mother," cried Ranulph, with a shudder;
  "do not arouse his wrath."</p>

  <p>"Do not arouse <i>my</i> wrath," returned Lady Rookwood. "I am the more to
  be feared. Think of Eleanor Mowbray; the bar between your nuptials is
  removed. Would you raise up a greater impediment?"</p>

  <p>"Enough, mother; more than enough. You have decided, though not convinced
  me. Detain him within the house, if you will, until the morrow; in the
  meantime, I will consider over my line of conduct."</p>

  <p>"Is this, then, your resolve?"</p>

  <p>"It is. Mr. Coates," said Ranulph, calling the attorney, who had been an
  inquisitive spectator, though, luckily, not an auditor of this interview,
  "unbind the prisoner, and bring him hither."</p>

  <p>"Is it your ladyship's pleasure?" asked Mr. Coates, who regretted
  exceedingly that he could not please both parties.</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood signified her assent by a slight gesture in the
  affirmative.</p>

  <p>"Your bidding shall be done, Sir Ranulph," said Coates, bowing and
  departing.</p>

  <p>"<i>Sir</i> Ranulph!" echoed Lady Rookwood, with strong emphasis; "marked
  you that?"</p>

  <p>"Body o' me," muttered the attorney, "this is the most extraordinary
  family, to be sure. Make way, gentlemen, if you please," added he, pushing
  through the crowd, towards the prisoner.</p>

  <p>Having described what took place between Lady Rookwood and her son in one
  part of the room, we must now briefly narrate some incidental occurrences in
  the other. The alarm of a robber having been taken spread with great celerity
  through the house, and almost all its inmates rushed into the room, including
  Dr. Small, Titus Tyrconnel, and Jack Palmer.</p>

  <p>"Odsbodikins! are you there, honey?" said Titus, who discovered his ally;
  "the bird's caught, you see."</p>

  <p>"Caught be d&mdash;d," replied Jack, bluffly; "so I see; all his own
  fault; infernal folly to come here, at such a time as this. However, it can't
  be helped now; he must make the best of it. And as to that sneaking,
  gimlet-eyed, parchment-skinned quill-driver, if I don't serve him out for his
  officiousness one of these days, my name's not Jack Palmer."</p>

  <p>"Och! cushlamacree! did I ever? why, what's the boy to you, Jack? Fair
  play's a jewel, and surely Mr. Coates only did his duty. I'm sorry he's
  captured, for his relationship to Sir Piers, and because I think he'll be
  tucked up for his pains; and, moreover, I could forgive the poaching; but as
  to the breaking into a house on such an occasion as this, och! It's a plaguy
  bad look. I'm afraid he's worse than I thought him."</p>

  <p>A group of the tenantry, many of whom were in a state of intoxication,
  had, in the meantime, formed themselves round the prisoner. Whatever might be
  the nature of his thoughts, no apprehension was visible in Luke's
  countenance. He stood erect amidst the assemblage, his tall form towering
  above them all, and his eyes fixed upon the movements of Lady Rookwood and
  her son. He had perceived the anguish of the latter, and the vehemence of the
  former, attributing both to their real causes. The taunts and jeers, threats
  and insolent inquiries, of the hinds who thronged around him, passed
  unheeded; yet one voice in his ear, sharp as the sting of a serpent, made him
  start. It was that of the sexton.</p>

  <p>"You have done well," said Peter, "have you not? Your fetters are, I hope,
  to your liking. Well! a wilful man must have his own way, and perhaps the
  next time you will be content to follow my advice. You must now free
  yourself, the best way you can, from these Moabites, and I promise you it
  will be no easy matter. Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>Peter withdrew into the crowd; and Luke, vainly endeavoring to discover
  his retreating figure, caught the eye of Jack Palmer fixed upon himself, with
  a peculiar and very significant expression.</p>

  <p>At this moment Mr. Coates made his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Bring forward the prisoner," said the man of law to his two assistants;
  and Luke was accordingly hurried along, Mr. Coates using his best efforts to
  keep back the crowd. It was during the pressure that Luke heard a voice
  whisper in his ear, "Never fear; all's right!" and turning his head, he
  became aware of the propinquity of Jack Palmer. The latter elevated his
  eyebrows with a gesture of silence, and Luke passed on as if nothing had
  occurred. He was presently confronted with Lady Rookwood and her son; and,
  notwithstanding the efforts of Mr. Coates, seconded by some few others, the
  crowd grew dense around them.</p>

  <p>"Remove his fetters," said Ranulph. And his manacles were removed.</p>

  <p>"You will consent to remain here a prisoner till to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"I consent to nothing," replied Luke; "I am in your hands."</p>

  <p>"He does not deserve your clemency, Sir Ranulph," interposed Coates.</p>

  <p>"Let him take his own course," said Lady Rookwood; "he will reap the
  benefit of it anon."</p>

  <p>"Will you pledge yourself not to depart?" asked Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Of course," cried the attorney; "to be sure he will. Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"No," returned Luke, haughtily, "I will not&mdash;and you will detain me
  at your proper peril."</p>

  <p>"Better and better," exclaimed the attorney. "This is the highest joke I
  ever heard."</p>

  <p>"I shall detain, you, then, in custody, until proper inquiries can be
  made," said Ranulph. "To your care, Mr. Coates, and to that of Mr. Tyrconnel,
  whom I must request to lend you his assistance, I commit the charge; and I
  must further request, that you will show him every attention which his
  situation will permit. Remove him. We have a sacred duty to the dead to
  fulfil, to which even justice to the living must give way. Disperse this
  crowd, and let instant preparations be made for the completion of the
  ceremonial. You understand me, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph Rookwood," said Luke, sternly, as he departed, "you have
  another&mdash;a more sacred office to perform. Fulfil your duty to your
  father's son."</p>

  <p>"Away with him!" cried Lady Rookwood. "I am out of all patience with this
  trilling. Follow me to my chamber," added she to her son, passing towards the
  door. The concourse of spectators, who had listened to this extraordinary
  scene in astonishment, made way for her instantly, and she left the room,
  accompanied by Ranulph. The prisoner was led out by the other door.</p>

  <p>"Botheration!" cried Titus to Mr. Coates, as they followed in the wake,
  "why did he choose out me? I'll lose the funeral entirely by his
  arrangement."</p>

  <p>"That you will," replied Palmer. "Shall I be your deputy?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," returned Coates. "I will have no other than Mr. Tyrconnel. It
  was Sir Ranulph's express wish."</p>

  <p>"That's the devil of it," returned Titus; "and I, who was to have been
  chief mourner, and have made all the preparations, am to be omitted. I wish
  Sir Ranulph had stayed till to-morrow&mdash;what could bring him here, to
  spoil all?&mdash;it's cursedly provoking!"</p>

  <p>"Cursed provoking!" echoed Jack.</p>

  <p>"But then there's no help, so I must make the best of it," returned the
  good-humored Irishman.</p>

  <p>"Body o' me," said Coates, "there's something in all this that I can't
  fathom. As to keeping the prisoner <i>here</i>, that's all moonshine. But I
  suppose we shall know the whole drift of it to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Ay," replied Jack, with a meaning smile, "to-morrow!"</p><a id="ch2-1"

  <p class="first">THE night was wild and stormy. The day had been sultry, with
  a lurid, metallic-looking sky, hanging like a vast galvanic plate over the
  face of nature. As evening drew on, everything betokened the coming tempest.
  Unerring indications of its approach were noted by the weatherwise at the
  hall. The swallow was seen to skim the surface of the pool so closely that he
  ruffled its placid mirror as he passed; and then, sharply darting round and
  round, with twittering scream, he winged his rapid flight to his clay-built
  home, beneath the barn eaves. The kine that had herded to the margin of the
  water, and sought, by splashing, to relieve themselves from the keen
  persecution of their myriad insect tormentors, wended stallwards, undriven,
  and deeply lowing. The deer, that at twilight had trooped thither also for
  refreshment, suddenly, "with expanded nostrils, snuffed the air," and bounded
  off to their coverts, amidst the sheltering fernbrake. The rooks
  "obstreperous of wing, in crowds combined," cawed in a way that, as plainly
  as words could have done, bespoke their apprehension; and were seen, some
  hovering and beating the air with flapping pinion, others shooting upwards in
  mid space, as if to reconnoitre the weather; while others, again, were
  croaking to their mates, in loud discordant tone, from the highest branches
  of the lime-trees; all, seemingly, as anxious and as busy as mariners before
  a gale of wind. At sunset, the hazy vapors, which had obscured the horizon
  throughout the day, rose up in spiral volumes, like smoke from a burning
  forest, and, becoming gradually condensed, assumed the form of huge, billowy
  masses, which, reflecting the sun's light, changed, as the sinking orb
  declined, from purple to flame-color, and thence to ashy, angry gray. Night
  rushed onwards, like a sable steed. There was a dead calm. The stillness was
  undisturbed, save by an intermittent, sighing wind, which, hollow as a murmur
  from the grave, died as it rose. At once the gray clouds turned to an inky
  blackness. A single, sharp, intensely vivid flash, shot from the bosom of the
  rack, sheer downwards, and struck the earth with a report like that of a
  piece of ordnance. In ten minutes it was dunnest night, and a rattling
  thunder-storm.</p>

  <p>The progress of the storm was watched with infinite apprehension by the
  crowd of tenantry assembled in the great hall; and loud and frequent were the
  ejaculations uttered, as each succeeding peal burst over their heads. There
  was, however, one amongst the assemblage who seemed to enjoy the uproar. A
  kindred excitement appeared to blaze in his glances, as he looked upon the
  storm without. This was Peter Bradley. He stood close by the window, and
  shaded not his eyes, even before the fiercest flashes. A grin of unnatural
  exhilaration played upon his features, and he seemed to exult in, and to
  court, the tempestuous horrors, which affected the most hardy amongst his
  companions with consternation, and made all shrink, trembling, into the
  recesses of the room. Peter's conduct was not unobserved, nor his reputation
  for unholy dealing forgotten. To some he was almost as much an object of
  dread as the storm itself.</p>

  <p>"Didst ever see the like o' that?" said Farmer Burtenshaw&mdash;one of the
  guests, whose round, honest face good wine had recently empurpled, but fear
  had now mottled white,&mdash;addressing a neighbor. "Didst ever hear of any
  man that were a Christian laughing in the very face o' a thunder-storm, with
  the lightnin' fit to put out his eyes, and the rattle above ready to break
  the drums o' his ears? I always thought Peter Bradley was not exactly what he
  ought to be, and now I am sure on it."</p>

  <p>"For my part, I think, Neighbor Burtenshaw," returned the other, "that
  this great burst of weather's all of his raising, for in all my born days I
  never see'd such a hurly-burly, and hope never to see the like of it again.
  I've heard my grandfather tell of folk as could command wind and rain; and,
  mayhap, Peter may have the power&mdash;we all know he can do more nor any
  other man."</p>

  <p>"We know, at all events," replied Burtenshaw, "that he lives like no other
  man; that he spends night after night by himself in that dreary churchyard;
  that he keeps no living thing, except an old terrier dog, in his crazy
  cottage; and that he never asks a body into his house from one year's end to
  another. I've never crossed his threshold these twenty years. But," continued
  he mysteriously, "I happened to pass the house one dark, dismal night, and
  there what dost think I see'd through the window?"</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what didst see?"</p>

  <p>"Peter Bradley sitting with a great book open on his knees; it were a
  Bible, I think, and he crying like a child."</p>

  <p>"Art sure o' that?"</p>

  <p>"The tears were falling fast upon the leaves," returned Burtenshaw; "but
  when I knocked at the door, he hastily shut up the book, and ordered me to be
  gone, in a surly tone, as if he were ashamed of being caught in the
  fact."</p>

  <p>"I thought no tear had ever dropped from his eye," said the other. "Why,
  he laughed when his daughter Susan went off at the hall; and, when she died,
  folks said he received hush-money to say nought about it. <i>That</i> were a
  bad business, anyhow; and now that his grandson Luke be taken in the fact of
  housebreaking, he minds it no more, not he, than if nothing had
  happened."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure of that," replied Burtenshaw; "he may be scheming
  summat all this time. Well, I've known Peter Bradley now these two-and-fifty
  years, and, excepting that one night, I never saw any good about him, and
  never heard of nobody who could tell who he be, or where he do come
  from."</p>

  <p>"One thing's certain, at least," replied the other farmer&mdash;"he were
  never born at Rookwood. How he came here the devil only knows. Save us! what
  a crash!&mdash;this storm be all of his raising, I tell 'ee."</p>

  <p>"He be&mdash;what he certainly will be," interposed another speaker, in a
  louder tone, and with less of apprehension in his manner than his comrade,
  probably from his nerves being better fortified with strong liquor. "Dost
  thou think, Samuel Plant, as how Providence would entrust the like o' him
  with the command of the elements? No&mdash;no, it's rank blasphemy to suppose
  such a thing, and I've too much of the true Catholic and apostate church
  about me, to stand by and hear that said."</p>

  <p>"Maybe, then, he gets his power from the Prince of Darkness," replied
  Plant; "no man else could go on as he does&mdash;only look at him. He seems
  to be watching for the thunderbowt."</p>

  <p>"I wish he may catch it, then," returned the other.</p>

  <p>"That's an evil wish, Simon Toft, and thou mayst repent it."</p>

  <p>"Not I," replied Toft; "it would be a good clearance to the neighborhood
  to get rid o' th' old croaking curmudgeon."</p>

  <p>Whether or not Peter overheard the conversation, we pretend not to say,
  but at that moment a blaze of lightning showed him staring fiercely at the
  group.</p>

  <p>"As I live, he's overheard you, Simon," exclaimed Plant. "I wouldn't be in
  your skin for a trifle."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," added Burtenshaw.</p>

  <p>"Let him overhear me," answered Toft; "who cares? he shall hear summat
  worth listening to. I'm not afraid o' him or his arts, were they as black as
  Beelzebuth's own; and to show you I'm not, I'll go and have a crack with him
  on the spot."</p>

  <p>"Thou'rt a fool for thy pains, if thou dost, Friend Toft," returned Plant,
  "that's all I can say."</p>

  <p>"Be advised by me, and stay here," seconded Burtenshaw, endeavoring to
  hold him back.</p>

  <p>But Toft would not be advised&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">Kings may be blest, but he was glorious,<br>
  O'er all the ills of life victorious.</p><br>

  <p>Staggering up to Peter, he laid a hard grasp upon his shoulder, and, thus
  forcibly soliciting his attention, burst into a loud horse-laugh.</p>

  <p>But Peter was, or affected to be, too much occupied to look at him.</p>

  <p>"What dost see, man, that thou starest so?"</p>

  <p>"It comes, it comes&mdash;the rain&mdash;the rain&mdash;a torrent&mdash;a
  deluge&mdash;ha, ha! Blessed is the corpse the rain rains on. Sir Piers may
  be drenched through his leaden covering by such a downfall as
  that&mdash;splash, splash&mdash;fire and water and thunder, all
  together&mdash;is not that fine?&mdash;ha, ha! The heavens will weep for him,
  though friends shed not a tear. When did a great man's heir feel sympathy for
  his sire's decease? When did his widow mourn? When doth any man regret his
  fellow? Never! He rejoiceth&mdash;he maketh glad in his inmost heart&mdash;he
  cannot help it&mdash;it is nature. We all pray for&mdash;we all delight in
  each other's destruction. We were created to do so; or why else should we act
  thus? I never wept for any man's death, but I have often laughed. Natural
  sympathy!&mdash;out on the phrase! The distant heavens&mdash;the senseless
  trees&mdash;the impenetrable stones&mdash;shall regret you more than man
  shall bewail your death with more sincerity. Ay, 'tis well&mdash;rain
  on&mdash;splash, splash: it will cool the hell-fever. Down,
  down&mdash;buckets and pails, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>There was a pause, during which the sexton, almost exhausted by the frenzy
  in which he had suffered himself to be involved, seemed insensible to all
  around him.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what," said Burtenshaw to Plant, "I have always thought there
  was more in Peter Bradley nor appears on the outside. He is not what he seems
  to be, take my word on it. Lord love you! do you think a man such as he
  pretends to be could talk in that sort of way&mdash;about nat'ral
  simpering?&mdash;no such thing."</p>

  <p>When Peter recovered, his insane merriment broke out afresh, having only
  acquired fury by the pause.</p>

  <p>"Look out, look out!" cried he; "hark to the thunder&mdash;list to the
  rain! Marked ye that flash&mdash;marked ye the clock-house&mdash;and the bird
  upon the roof? 'tis the rook&mdash;the great bird of the house, that hath
  borne away the soul of the departed. There, there&mdash;can you not see it?
  it sits and croaks through storm and rain, and never heeds at all&mdash;and
  wherefore should it heed? See, it flaps its broad black wings&mdash;it
  croaks&mdash;ha, ha! It comes&mdash;it comes."</p>

  <p>And driven, it might be by the terror of the storm, from more secure
  quarters, a bird, at this instant, was dashed against the window, and fell to
  the ground.</p>

  <p>"That's a call," continued Peter; "it will be over soon, and we must set
  out. The dead will not need to tarry. Look at that trail of fire along the
  avenue; dost see yon line of sparkles, like a rocket's tail? That's the path
  the corpse will take. St. Hermes's flickering fire, Robin Goodfellow's
  dancing light, or the blue flame of the corpse-candle, which I saw flitting
  to the churchyard last week, was not so pretty a sight&mdash;ha, ha! You
  asked me for a song a moment ago&mdash;you shall have one now without
  asking."</p>

  <p>And without waiting to consult the inclinations of his comrades, Peter
  broke into the following wild strain with all the fervor of a half-crazed
  improvisatore:</p>

  <h3>THE CORPSE-CANDLE</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Lambere flamma <span title=
     "taphos">&tau;&alpha;&phi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> et circum funera
     pasci.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Through the midnight gloom did a pale blue
     light<br>
  To the churchyard mirk wing its lonesome flight:&mdash;<br>
  Thrice it floated those old walls round&mdash;<br>
  Thrice it paused&mdash;till the grave it found.<br>
  Over the grass-green sod it glanced,<br>
  Over the fresh-turned earth it danced,<br>
  Like a torch in the night-breeze quivering&mdash;<br>
  Never was seen so gay a thing!<br>
  Never was seen so blithe a sight<br>
  As the midnight dance of that blue light!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Now what of that pale blue flame dost know?<br>
  Canst tell where it comes from, or where it will go?<br>
  Is it the soul, released from clay,<br>
  Over the earth that takes its way,<br>
  And tarries a moment in mirth and glee<br>
  Where the corse it hath quitted interred shall be?<br>
  Or is it the trick of some fanciful sprite,<br>
  That taketh in mortal mischance delight,<br>
  And marketh the road the coffin shall go,<br>
  And the spot where the dead shall be soon laid low?<br>
  Ask him who can answer these questions aright;<br>
  I know not the cause of that pale blue light!</p><br>

  <p>"I can't say I like thy song, Master Peter," said Toft, as the sexton
  finished his stave, "but if thou <i>didst</i> see a corpse-candle, as thou
  call'st thy pale blue flame, whose death doth it betoken?&mdash;eh!"</p>

  <p>"Thine own," returned Peter, sharply.</p>

  <p>"Mine! thou lying old cheat&mdash;dost dare to say that to my face? Why,
  I'm as hale and hearty as ever a man in the house. Dost think there's no life
  and vigor in this arm, thou drivelling old dotard?"</p>

  <p>Upon which, Toft seized Peter by the throat with an energy that, but for
  the timely intervention of the company, who rushed to his assistance, the
  prophet might himself have anticipated the doom he prognosticated.</p>

  <p>Released from the grasp of Toft, who was held back by the bystanders,
  Peter again broke forth into his eldritch laugh; and staring right into the
  face of his adversary, with eyes glistening, and hands uplifted, as if in the
  act of calling down an imprecation on his head, he screamed, in a shrill and
  discordant voice, "Soh! you will not take my warning? you revile me&mdash;you
  flout me! 'Tis well! your fate shall prove a warning to all
  unbelievers&mdash;<i>they</i> shall remember this night, though
  <i>you</i>will not. Fool! fool!&mdash;your doom has long been sealed! I saw
  your wraith choose out its last lodgment on Halloween; I know the spot. Your
  grave is dug already&mdash;ha, ha!" And, with renewed laughter, Peter rushed
  out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Did I not caution thee not to provoke him, friend Toft?" said Plant;
  "it's ill playing with edge-tools; but don't let him fly off in that
  tantrum&mdash;one of ye go after him."</p>

  <p>"That will I," replied Burtenshaw; and he departed in search of the
  sexton.</p>

  <p>"I'd advise thee to make it up with Peter so soon as thou canst,
  neighbor," continued Plant; "he's a bad friend, but a worse enemy."</p>

  <p>"Why, what harm can he do me?" returned Toft, who, however, was not
  without some misgivings. "If I must die, I can't help it&mdash;I shall go
  none the sooner for him, even if he speak the truth, which I don't think he
  do; and if I must, I sha'n't go unprepared&mdash;only I think as how, if it
  pleased Providence, I could have wished to keep my old missus company some
  few years longer, and see those bits of lasses of mine grow up into women,
  and respectably provided for. But His will be done. I sha'n't leave 'em quite
  penniless, and there's one eye at least, I'm sure, won't be dry at my
  departure." Here the stout heart of Toft gave way, and he shed some few
  "natural tears," which, however, he speedily brushed away. "I'll tell you
  what, neighbors," continued he, "I think we may all as well be thinking of
  going to our own homes, for, to my mind, we shall never reach the churchyard
  to-night."</p>

  <p>"That <i>you</i> never will," exclaimed a voice behind him; and Toft,
  turning round, again met the glance of Peter.</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Master Peter," cried the good-natured farmer, "this be ugly
  jesting&mdash;ax pardon for my share of it&mdash;sorry for what I
  did&mdash;so give us thy hand, man, and think no more about it."</p>

  <p>Peter extended his claw, and the parties were, apparently, once more upon
  terms of friendship.</p>

  <p class="first">A supply of spirits was here introduced; lights were brought
  at the same time, and placed upon a long oak table. The party gathering round
  it, ill-humor was speedily dissipated, and even the storm disregarded, in the
  copious libations that ensued. At this juncture, a loiterer appeared in the
  hall. His movements were unnoticed by all excepting the sexton, who watched
  his proceedings with some curiosity. The person walked to the window,
  appearing, so far as could be discovered, to eye the storm with great
  impatience. He then paced the hall rapidly backwards and forwards, and Peter
  fancied he could detect sounds of disappointment in his muttered
  exclamations. Again he returned to the window, as if to ascertain the
  probable duration of the shower. It was a hopeless endeavor; all was
  pitch-dark without; the lightning was now only seen at long intervals, but
  the rain still audibly descended in torrents. Apparently seeing the
  impossibility of controlling the elements, the person approached the
  table.</p>

  <p>"What think you of the night, Mr. Palmer?" asked the sexton of Jack, for
  he was the anxious investigator of the weather.</p>

  <p>"Don't know&mdash;can't say&mdash;set in, I think&mdash;cursed
  unlucky&mdash;for the funeral, I mean&mdash;we shall be drowned if we
  go."</p>

  <p>"And drunk if we stay," rejoined Peter. "But never fear, it will hold up,
  depend upon it, long before we can start. Where have they put the prisoner?"
  asked he, with a sudden change of manner.</p>

  <p>"I know the room, but can't describe it; it's two or three doors down the
  lower corridor of the eastern gallery."</p>

  <p>"Good. Who are on guard?"</p>

  <p>"Titus Tyrconnel and that swivel-eyed quill-driver, Coates."</p>

  <p>"Enough."</p>

  <p>"Come, come, Master Peter," roared Toft, "let's have another stave. Give
  us one of your odd snatches. No more corpse-candles, or that sort of thing.
  Something lively&mdash;something jolly&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"A good move," shouted Jack. "A lively song from
  <i>you</i>&mdash;lillibullero from a death's-head&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"My songs are all of a sort," returned Peter; "I am seldom asked to sing a
  second time. However, you are welcome to the merriest I have." And preparing
  himself, like certain other accomplished vocalists, with a few preliminary
  hems and haws, he struck forth the following doleful ditty:</p>

  <h3>THE OLD OAK COFFIN</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Sic ego componi versus in ossa velim.
     &mdash;<span class="smcap">Tibullus</span>.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">In a churchyard, upon the sward, a coffin there
     was laid,<br>
  And leaning stood, beside the wood, a sexton on his spade.<br>
  A coffin old and black it was, and fashioned curiously,<br>
  With quaint device of carved oak, in hideous fantasie.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">For here was wrought the sculptured thought of a
     tormented face,<br>
  With serpents lithe that round it writhe, in folded strict embrace.<br>
  Grim visages of grinning fiends were at each corner set,<br>
  And emblematic scrolls, mort-heads, and bones together met.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">"Ah, welladay!" that sexton gray unto himself did
     cry,<br>
  "Beneath that lid much lieth hid&mdash;much awful mysterie.<br>
  It is an ancient coffin from the abbey that stood here;<br>
  Perchance it holds an abbot's bones, perchance those of a frere.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">"In digging deep, where monks do sleep, beneath
     yon cloister shrined,<br>
  That coffin old, within the mould, it was my chance to find;<br>
  The costly carvings of the lid I scraped full carefully,<br>
  In hope to get at name or date, yet nothing could I see.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">"With pick and spade I've plied my trade for sixty
     years and more,<br>
  Yet never found, beneath the ground, shell strange as that before;<br>
  Full many coffins have I seen&mdash;have seen them deep or flat,<br>
  Fantastical in fashion&mdash;none fantastical as that."</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">And saying so, with heavy blow, the lid he
     shattered wide,<br>
  And, pale with fright, a ghastly sight that sexton gray espied;<br>
  A miserable sight it was, that loathsome corpse to see,<br>
  The last, last, dreary, darksome stage of fall'n humanity.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">Though all was gone, save reeky bone, a green and
     grisly heap,<br>
  With scarce a trace of fleshly face, strange posture did it keep.<br>
  The hands were clenched, the teeth were wrenched, as if the wretch had
  risen,<br>
  E'en after death had ta'en his breath, to strive and burst his prison.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">The neck was bent, the nails were rent, no limb or
     joint was straight;<br>
  Together glued, with blood imbued, black and coagulate.<br>
  And, as the sexton stooped him down to lift the coffin plank,<br>
  His fingers were defiled all o'er with slimy substance dank.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">"Ah, welladay!" that sexton gray unto himself did
     cry,<br>
  "Full well I see how Fate's decree foredoomed this wretch to die;<br>
  A living man, a breathing man, within the coffin thrust,<br>
  Alack! alack! the agony ere he returned to dust!"</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">A vision drear did then appear unto that sexton's
     eyes;<br>
  Like that poor wight before him straight he in a coffin lies.<br>
  He lieth in a trance within that coffin close and fast;<br>
  Yet though he sleepeth now, he feels he shall awake at last.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">The coffin, then, by reverend men, is borne with
     footsteps slow,<br>
  Where tapers shine before the shrine, where breathes the requiem low;<br>
  And for the dead the prayer is said, for the soul that is <i>not</i>
  flown&mdash;<br>
  Then all is drowned in hollow sound, the earth is o'er him thrown!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">He draweth breath&mdash;he wakes from death to
     life more horrible;<br>
  To agony! such agony! no living tongue may tell.<br>
  Die! die he must, that wretched one! he struggles&mdash;strives in vain;<br>
  No more Heaven's light, nor sunshine bright, shall he behold again.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">"Gramercy, Lord!" the sexton roared, awakening
     suddenly,<br>
  "If this be dream, yet doth it seem most dreadful so to die.<br>
  Oh, cast my body in the sea! or hurl it on the shore!<br>
  But nail me not in coffin fast&mdash;no grave will I dig more."</p><br>

  <p>It was not difficult to discover the effect produced by this song, in the
  lengthened faces of the greater part of the audience. Jack Palmer, however,
  laughed loud and long.</p>

  <p>"Bravo, bravo!" cried he; "that suits my humor exactly. I can't abide the
  thoughts of a coffin. No deal box for me."</p>

  <p>"A gibbet might, perhaps, serve your turn as well," muttered the sexton;
  adding aloud, "I am now entitled to call upon you;&mdash;a song!&mdash;a
  song!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, a song, Mr. Palmer, a song!" reiterated the hinds. "Yours will be the
  right kind of thing."</p>

  <p>"Say no more," replied Jack. "I'll give you a chant composed upon Dick
  Turpin, the highwayman. It's no great shakes, to be sure, but it's the best I
  have." And, with a knowing wink at the sexton, he commenced, in the true
  nasal whine, the following strain:</p>

  <h3>ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP<br>
  <small>OR TURPIN'S FIRST FLING</small></h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Cum esset proposita fuga
     <i>Turpi(n)s</i>.&mdash; <span class="smcap">Cicero</span>.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">"One foot in the stirrup, one hand in the
     rein,<br>
  And the noose be my portion, or freedom I'll gain!<br>
  Oh! give me a seat in my saddle once more,<br>
  And these bloodhounds shall find that the chase is not o'er!"<br>
  Thus muttered Dick Turpin, who found, while he slept,<br>
  That the Philistines old on his slumbers had crept;<br>
  Had entrapped him as puss on her form you'd ensnare,<br>
  And that gone were his snappers&mdash;and gone was his mare.<br>
  <i>Hilloah!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">How Dick had been captured is readily told,<br>
  The pursuit had been hot, though the night had been cold,<br>
  So at daybreak, exhausted, he sought brief repose<br>
  Mid the thick of a corn-field, away from his foes.<br>
  But in vain was his caution&mdash;in vain did his steed,<br>
  Ever watchful and wakeful in moments of need,<br>
  With lip and with hoof on her master's cheek press&mdash;<br>
  He slept on, nor heeded the warning of Bess.<br>
  <i>Hilloah!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Zounds! gem'men!" cried Turpin, "you've found me
     at fault,<br>
  And the highflying highwayman's come to a halt;<br>
  You have turned up a trump&mdash;for I weigh well my weight,&mdash;<br>
  And the <i>forty is yours</i>, though the halter's <i>my</i> fate.<br>
  Well, come on't what will, you shall own when all's past,<br>
  That Dick Turpin, the Dauntless, was game to the last.<br>
  But, before we go further, I'll hold you a bet,<br>
  That one foot in my stirrup you won't let me set.<br>

     style="margin-left:35%">"A hundred to one is the odds <i>I</i> will

  A hundred to one is the odds <i>you</i> command;<br>
  Here's a handful of goldfinches ready to fly!<br>
  May I venture a foot in my stirrup to try?"<br>
  As he carelessly spoke, Dick directed a glance<br>
  At his courser, and motioned her slyly askance:&mdash;<br>
  You might tell by the singular toss of her head,<br>
  And the prick of her ears, that his meaning she read.<br>
  <i>Hilloah!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">With derision at first was Dick's wager
     received,<br>
  And his error at starting as yet unretrieved;<br>
  But when from his pocket the shiners he drew,<br>
  And offered to "make up the hundred to two,"<br>
  There were havers in plenty, and each whispered each,<br>
  The same thing, though varied in figure of speech,<br>
  "Let the fool act his folly&mdash;the stirrup of Bess!<br>
  He has put his foot <i>in it</i> already, we guess!"<br>
  <i>Hilloah!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Bess was brought to her master&mdash;Dick
     steadfastly gazed<br>
  At the eye of his mare, then his foot quick upraised;<br>
  His toe touched the stirrup, his hand grasped the rein&mdash;<br>
  He was safe on the back of his courser again!<br>
  As the clarion, fray-sounding and shrill, was the neigh<br>
  Of Black Bess, as she answered his cry "Hark-away!"<br>
  "Beset me, ye bloodhounds! in rear and in van;<br>
  My foot's in the stirrup and catch me who can!"<br>
  <i>Hilloah!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">There was riding and gibing mid rabble and
     rout,<br>
  And the old woods re-echoed the Philistines' shout!<br>
  There was hurling and whirling o'er brake and o'er brier,<br>
  But the course of Dick Turpin was swift as Heaven's fire.<br>
  Whipping, spurring, and straining would nothing avail,<br>
  Dick laughed at their curses, and scoffed at their wail;<br>
  "My foot's in the stirrup!"&mdash;thus rang his last cry;<br>
  "Bess has answered my call; now her mettle we'll try!"<br>
  <i>Hilloah!</i></p><br>

  <p>Uproarious applause followed Jack's song, when the joviality of the
  mourners was interrupted by a summons to attend in the state-room. Silence
  was at once completely restored; and, in the best order they could assume,
  they followed their leader, Peter Bradley. Jack Palmer was amongst the last
  to enter, and remained a not incurious spectator of a by no means common
  scene.</p>

  <p>Preparations had been made to give due solemnity to the ceremonial. The
  leaden coffin was fastened down, and enclosed in an outer case of oak, upon
  the lid of which stood a richly-chased massive silver flagon, filled with
  burnt claret, called the grace-cup. All the lights were removed, save two
  lofty wax flambeaux, which were placed to the back, and threw a lurid glare
  upon the group immediately about the body, consisting of Ranulph Rookwood and
  some other friends of the deceased. Dr. Small stood in front of the bier;
  and, under the directions of Peter Bradley, the tenantry and household were
  formed into a wide half-moon across the chamber. There was a hush of
  expectation, as Dr. Small looked gravely round; and even Jack Palmer, who was
  as little likely as any man to yield to an impression of the kind, felt
  himself moved by the scene.</p>

  <p>The very orthodox Small, as is well known to our readers, held everything
  savoring of the superstitions of the Scarlet Woman in supreme abomination;
  and, entertaining such opinions, it can scarcely be supposed that a funeral
  oration would find much favor in his eyes, accompanied, as it was, with the
  accessories of censer, candle, and cup; all evidently derived from that
  period when, under the three-crowned pontiff's sway, the shaven priest
  pronounced his benediction o'er the dead, and released the penitent's soul
  from purgatorial flames, while he heavily mulcted the price of his redemption
  from the possessions of his successor. Small resented the idea of treading in
  such steps, as an insult to himself and his cloth. Was he, the intolerant of
  Papistry, to tolerate this? Was he, who could not endure the odor of
  Catholicism, to have his nostrils thus polluted&mdash;his garments thus
  defiled by actual contact with it? It was not to be thought of: and he had
  formally signified his declination to Mr. Coates, when a little conversation
  with that gentleman, and certain weighty considerations therein held
  forth&mdash;the advowson of the church of Rookwood residing with the
  family&mdash;and represented by him, as well as the placing in juxtaposition
  of penalties to be incurred by refusal, that the scruples of Small gave way;
  and, with the best grace he could muster, very reluctantly promised
  compliance.</p>

  <p>With these feelings, it will be readily conceived that the doctor was not
  in the best possible frame of mind for the delivery of his exhortation. His
  spirit had been ruffled by a variety of petty annoyances, amongst the
  greatest of which was the condition to which the good cheer had reduced his
  clerk, Zachariah Trundletext, whose reeling eye, pendulous position, and open
  mouth proclaimed him absolutely incapable of office. Zachariah was, in
  consequence, dismissed, and Small commenced his discourse unsupported. But as
  our recording it would not probably conduce to the amusement of our readers,
  whatever it might to their edification, we shall pass it over with very brief
  mention. Suffice it to say, that the oration was so thickly interstrewn with
  lengthy quotations from the fathers,&mdash;Chrysostomus, Hieronymus,
  Ambrosius, Basilius, Bernardus, and the rest, with whose recondite Latinity,
  notwithstanding the clashing of their opinions with his own, the doctor was
  intimately acquainted, and which he moreover delighted to quote,&mdash;that
  his auditors were absolutely mystified and perplexed, and probably not
  without design. Countenances of such amazement were turned towards him, that
  Small, who had a keen sense of the ludicrous, could scarcely forbear smiling
  as he proceeded; and if we could suspect so grave a personage of waggery, we
  should almost think that, by way of retaliation, he had palmed some abstruse,
  monkish epicedium upon his astounded auditors.</p>

  <p>The oration concluded, biscuits and confectionery were, according to old
  observance, handed to such of the tenantry as chose to partake of them. The
  serving of the grace-cup, which ought to have formed part of the duties of
  Zachariah, had he been capable of office, fell to the share of the sexton.
  The bowl was kissed, first by Ranulph, with lips that trembled with emotion,
  and afterward by his surrounding friends; but no drop was tasted&mdash;a
  circumstance which did not escape Peter's observation. Proceeding to the
  tenantry, the first in order happened to be Farmer Toft. Peter presented the
  cup, and as Toft was about to drain a deep draught of the wine, Peter
  whispered in his ear, "Take my advice for once, Friend Toft, and don't let a
  bubble of the liquid pass your lips. For every drop of the wine you drain,
  Sir Piers will have one sin the less, and you a load the heavier on your
  conscience. Didst never hear of sin-swallowing? For what else was this custom
  adopted? Seest thou not the cup's brim hath not yet been moistened? Well, as
  you will&mdash;ha, ha!" And the sexton passed onwards.</p>

  <p>His work being nearly completed, he looked around for Jack Palmer, whom he
  had remarked during the oration, but could nowhere discover him. Peter was
  about to place the flagon, now almost drained of its contents, upon its
  former resting-place, when Small took it from his hands.</p>

  <p>"<i>In poculi fundo residuum non relinque</i>, admonisheth Pythagoras,"
  said he, returning the empty cup to the sexton.</p>

  <p>"My task here is ended," muttered Peter, "but not elsewhere. Foul weather
  or fine, thunder or rain, I must to the church."</p>

  <p>Bequeathing his final instructions to certain of the household who were to
  form part of the procession, in case it set out, he opened the hall door,
  and, the pelting shower dashing heavily in his face, took his way up the
  avenue, screaming, as he strode along, the following congenial rhymes:</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-3"
     name="ch2-3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; THE CHURCHYARD</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Methought I walked, about the mid of night,<br>
  Into a churchyard.<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Webster:</span> <i>The White Devil</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">LIGHTS streamed through the chancel window as the sexton
  entered the churchyard, darkly defining all the ramified tracery of the noble
  Gothic arch, and illumining the gorgeous dyes of its richly-stained glass,
  profusely decorated with the armorial bearings of the founder of the fane,
  and the many alliances of his descendants. The sheen of their blazonry
  gleamed bright in the darkness, as if to herald to his last home another of
  the line whose achievements it displayed. Glowing colorings, checkered like
  rainbow tints, were shed upon the broken leaves of the adjoining yew-trees,
  and upon the rounded grassy tombs.</p>

  <p>Opening the gate, as he looked in that direction, Peter became aware of a
  dark figure, enveloped in a large black cloak, and covered with a slouched
  hat, standing at some distance, between the window and the tree, and so
  intervening as to receive the full influence of the stream of radiance which
  served to dilate its almost superhuman stature. The sexton stopped. The
  figure remained stationary. There was something singular both in the costume
  and situation of the person. Peter's curiosity was speedily aroused, and,
  familiar with every inch of the churchyard, he determined to take the nearest
  cut, and to ascertain to whom the mysterious cloak and hat belonged. Making
  his way over the undulating graves, and instinctively rounding the headstones
  that intercepted his path, he quickly drew near the object of his inquiry.
  From the moveless posture it maintained, the figure appeared to be
  unconscious of Peter's approach. To his eyes it seemed to expand as he
  advanced. He was now almost close upon it, when his progress was arrested by
  a violent grasp laid on his shoulder. He started, and uttered an exclamation
  of alarm. At this moment a vivid flash of lightning illumined the whole
  churchyard, and Peter then thought he beheld, at some distance from him, two
  other figures, bearing upon their shoulders a huge chest, or, it might be, a
  coffin. The garb of these figures, so far as it could be discerned through
  the drenching rain, was fantastical in the extreme. The foremost seemed to
  have a long white beard descending to his girdle. Little leisure, however,
  was allowed Peter for observation. The vision no sooner met his glance than
  it disappeared, and nothing was seen but the glimmering
  tombstones&mdash;nothing heard but the whistling wind and the
  heavily-descending shower. He rubbed his eyes. The muffled figure had
  vanished, and not a trace could be discovered of the mysterious
  coffin-bearers, if such they were.</p>

  <p>"What have I seen?" mentally ejaculated Peter: "is this sorcery or
  treachery, or both? No body-snatchers would visit this place on a night like
  this, when the whole neighborhood is aroused. Can it be a vision I have seen?
  Pshaw! shall I juggle myself as I deceive these hinds? It was no bearded
  demon that I beheld, but the gipsy patrico, Balthazar. I knew him at once.
  But what meant that muffled figure; and whose arm could it have been that
  griped my shoulder? Ha! what if Lady Rookwood should have given orders for
  the removal of Susan's body? No, no; that cannot be. Besides, I have the keys
  of the vault; and there are hundreds now in the church who would permit no
  such desecration. I am perplexed to think what it can mean. But I will to the
  vault." Saying which, he hastened to the church porch, and after wringing the
  wet from his clothes, as a water-dog might shake the moisture from his curly
  hide, and doffing his broad felt hat, he entered the holy edifice. The
  interior seemed one blaze of light to the sexton, in his sudden transition
  from outer darkness. Some few persons were assembled, probably such as were
  engaged in the preparations; but there was one group which immediately caught
  his attention.</p>

  <p>Near the communion-table stood three persons, habited in deep mourning,
  apparently occupied in examining the various monumental carvings that
  enriched the walls. Peter's office led him to that part of the church. About
  to descend into the vaults, to make the last preparations for the reception
  of the dead, with lantern in hand, keys, and a crowbar, he approached the
  party. Little attention was paid to the sexton's proceedings, till the harsh
  grating of the lock attracted their notice.</p>

  <p>Peter started as he beheld the face of one of the three, and relaxing his
  hold upon the key, the strong bolt shot back in the lock. There was a whisper
  amongst the party. A light step was heard advancing towards him; and ere the
  sexton could sufficiently recover his surprise, or force open the door, a
  female figure stood by his side.</p>

  <p>The keen, inquiring stare which Peter bestowed upon the countenance of the
  young lady so much abashed her, that she hesitated in her purpose of
  addressing him, and hastily retired.</p>

  <p>"She here!" muttered Peter; "nay, then, I must no longer withhold the
  dreaded secret from Luke, or Ranulph may, indeed, wrest his possessions from
  him."</p>

  <p>Reinforced by her companions, an elderly lady and a tall, handsome man,
  whose bearing and deportment bespoke him to be a soldier, the fair stranger
  again ventured towards Peter.</p>

  <p>"You are the sexton," said she, addressing him in a voice sweet and
  musical.</p>

  <p>"I am," returned Peter. It was harmony succeeded by dissonance.</p>

  <p>"You, perhaps, can tell us, then," said the elderly lady, "whether the
  funeral is likely to take place to-night? We thought it possible that the
  storm might altogether prevent it."</p>

  <p>"The storm is over, as nearly as maybe," replied Peter. "The body will
  soon be on its way. I am but now arrived from the hall."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the lady. "None of the family will be present, I
  suppose. Who is the chief mourner?"</p>

  <p>"Young Sir Ranulph," answered the sexton. "There will be more of the
  family than were expected."</p>

  <p>"Is Sir Ranulph returned?" asked the young lady, with great agitation of
  manner. "I thought he was abroad&mdash;that he was not expected. Are you sure
  you are rightly informed?"</p>

  <p>"I parted with him at the hall not ten minutes since," replied Peter. "He
  returned from France to-night most unexpectedly."</p>

  <p>"Oh, mother!" exclaimed the younger lady, "that this should be&mdash;that
  I should meet him here. Why did we come?&mdash;let us depart."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" replied her mother; "the storm forbids it. This man's
  information is so strange, I scarce can credit it. Are you sure you have
  asserted the truth?" said she, addressing Peter.</p>

  <p>"I am not accustomed to be doubted," answered he. "Other things as strange
  have happened at the hall."</p>

  <p>"What mean you?" asked the gentleman, noticing this last remark.</p>

  <p>"You would not need to ask the question of me, had you been there, amongst
  the other guests," retorted Peter. "Odd things, I tell you, have been done
  there this night, and stranger things may occur before the morning."</p>

  <p>"You are insolent, sirrah! I comprehend you not."</p>

  <p>"Enough! I can comprehend <i>you</i>," replied Peter, significantly; "I
  know the count of the mourners invited to this ceremonial, and I am aware
  that there are three too many."</p>

  <p>"Know you this saucy knave, mother?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot call him to mind, though I fancy I have seen him before."</p>

  <p>"My recollection serves me better, lady," interposed Peter. "I remember
  one who was once the proud heiress of Rookwood&mdash;ay, proud and beautiful.
  Then the house was filled with her gallant suitors. Swords were crossed for
  her. Hearts bled for her. Yet she favored none, until one hapless hour. Sir
  Reginald Rookwood <i>had</i> a daughter; Sir Reginald <i>lost</i> a daughter.
  Ha!&mdash;I see I am right. Well, he is dead and buried; and Reginald, his
  son, is dead likewise; and Piers is on his road hither; and you are the last,
  as in the course of nature you might have been the first. And, now that they
  are all gone, you do rightly to bury your grievances with them."</p>

  <p>"Silence, sirrah!" exclaimed the gentleman, "or I will beat your brains
  out with your own spade."</p>

  <p>"No; let him speak, Vavasour," said the lady, with an expression of
  anguish&mdash;"he has awakened thoughts of other days."</p>

  <p>"I have done," said Peter, "and must to work. Will you descend with me,
  madam, into the sepulchre of your ancestry? All your family lie
  within&mdash;ay, and the Lady Eleanor, your mother, amongst the number."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray signified her assent, and the party prepared to follow
  him.</p>

  <p>The sexton held the lantern so as to throw its light upon the steps as
  they entered the gloomy receptacle of the departed. Eleanor half repented
  having ventured within its dreary limits, so much did the appearance of the
  yawning catacombs, surcharged with mortality, and, above all, the ghostly
  figure of the grim knight, affect her with dread, as she looked wistfully
  around. She required all the support her brother's arm could afford her; nor
  was Mrs. Mowbray altogether unmoved.</p>

  <p>"And all the family are here interred, you say?" inquired the latter.</p>

  <p>"All," replied the sexton.</p>

  <p>"Where, then, lies Sir Reginald's younger brother?"</p>

  <p>"Who?" exclaimed Peter, starting.</p>

  <p>"Alan Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"What of him?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of moment. But I thought you could, perhaps, inform me. He died
  young."</p>

  <p>"He did," replied Peter, in an altered tone&mdash;"very young; but not
  before he had lived to an old age of wretchedness. Do you know his story,
  madam?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard it."</p>

  <p>"From your father's lips?"</p>

  <p>"From Sir Reginald Rookwood's&mdash;never. Call him not my father, sirrah;
  even <i>here</i> I will not have him named so to me."</p>

  <p>"Your pardon, madam," returned the sexton. "Great cruelty was shown to the
  Lady Eleanor, and may well call forth implacable resentment in her child; yet
  methinks the wrong he did his brother Alan was the foulest stain with which
  Sir Reginald's black soul was dyed."</p>

  <p>"With what particular wrong dost thou charge Sir Reginald?" demanded Major
  Mowbray. "What injury did he inflict upon his brother Alan?"</p>

  <p>"He wronged his brother's honor," replied the sexton; "he robbed him of
  his wife, poisoned his existence, and hurried him to an untimely grave."</p>

  <p>Eleanor shudderingly held back during this horrible narration, the hearing
  of which she would willingly have shunned, had it been possible.</p>

  <p>"Can this be true?" asked the major.</p>

  <p>"Too true, my son," replied Mrs. Mowbray, sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"And where lies the unfortunate Alan?" asked Major Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"'Twixt two cross roads. Where else should the suicide lie?"</p>

  <p>Evading any further question, Peter hastily traversed the vault, elevating
  the light so as to reveal the contents of each cell. One circumstance filled
  him with surprise and dismay&mdash;he could nowhere perceive the coffin of
  his daughter. In vain he peered into every catacomb&mdash;they were
  apparently undisturbed; and, with much internal marvelling and misgiving,
  Peter gave up the search. "That vision is now explained," muttered he; "the
  body is removed, but by whom? Death! can I doubt? It must be Lady
  Rookwood&mdash;who else can have any interest in its removal. She has acted
  boldly. But she shall yet have reason to repent her temerity." As he
  continued his search, his companions silently followed. Suddenly he stopped,
  and, signifying that all was finished, they not unwillingly quitted this
  abode of horror, leaving him behind them.</p>

  <p>"It is a dreadful place," whispered Eleanor to her mother; "nor would I
  have visited it, had I conceived anything of its horrors. And that strange
  man! who or what is he?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, who is he?" repeated Major Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"I recollect him now," replied Mrs. Mowbray; "he is one who has ever been
  connected with the family. He had a daughter, whose beauty was her ruin: it
  is a sad tale; I cannot tell it now: you have heard enough of misery and
  guilt: but that may account for his bitterness of speech. He was a dependent
  upon my poor brother."</p>

  <p>"Poor man!" replied Eleanor; "if he has been unfortunate, I pity him. I am
  sorry we have been into that dreadful place. I am very faint: and I tremble
  more than ever at the thought of meeting Ranulph Rookwood again. I can
  scarcely support myself&mdash;I am sure I shall not venture to look upon
  him."</p>

  <p>"Had I dreamed of the likelihood of his attending the ceremony, rest
  assured, dear Eleanor, we should not have been here: but I was informed there
  was no possibility of his return. Compose yourself, my child. It will be a
  trying time to both of us; but it is now inevitable."</p>

  <p>At this moment the bell began to toll. "The procession has started," said
  Peter, as he passed the Mowbrays. "That bell announces the setting out."</p>

  <p>"See yonder persons hurrying to the door," exclaimed Eleanor, with
  eagerness, and trembling violently. "They are coming. Oh! I shall never be
  able to go through with it, dear mother."</p>

  <p>Peter hastened to the church door, where he stationed himself, in company
  with a host of others, equally curious. Flickering lights in the distance,
  shining like stars through the trees, showed them that the procession was
  collecting in front of the hall. The rain had now entirely ceased; the
  thunder muttered from afar, and the lightning seemed only to lick the
  moisture from the trees. The bell continued to toll, and its loud booming
  awoke the drowsy echoes of the valley. On the sudden, a solitary, startling
  concussion of thunder was heard; and presently a man rushed down from the
  belfry, with the tidings that he had seen a ball of fire fall from a cloud
  right over the hall. Every ear was on the alert for the next sound; none was
  heard. It was the crisis of the storm. Still the funeral procession advanced
  not. The strong sheen of the torchlight was still visible from the bottom of
  the avenue, now disappearing, now brightly glimmering, as if the bearers were
  hurrying to and fro amongst the trees. It was evident that much confusion
  prevailed, and that some misadventure had occurred. Each man muttered to his
  neighbor, and few were there who had not in a measure surmised the cause of
  the delay. At this juncture, a person without his hat, breathless with haste
  and almost palsied with fright, rushed through the midst of them and,
  stumbling over the threshold, fell headlong into the church.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, Master Plant? What has happened? Tell us! Tell us!"
  exclaimed several voices simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Lord have mercy upon us!" cried Plant, gasping for utterance, and not
  attempting to raise himself. "It's horrible! dreadful! oh!&mdash;oh!"</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" inquired Peter, approaching the fallen man.</p>

  <p>"And dost <i>thou</i> need to ask, Peter Bradley? thou, who foretold it
  all? but I will not say what I think, though my tongue itches to tell thee
  the truth. Be satisfied, thy wizard's lore has served thee right&mdash;he is
  dead."</p>

  <p>"Who? Ranulph Rookwood? Has anything befallen him, or the prisoner, Luke
  Bradley?" asked the sexton, with eagerness.</p>

  <p>A scream here burst forth from one who was standing behind the group; and,
  in spite of the efforts of her mother to withhold her, Eleanor Mowbray rushed
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Has aught happened to Sir Ranulph?" asked she.</p>

  <p>"Noa&mdash;noa&mdash;not to Sir Ranulph&mdash;he be with the body."</p>

  <p>"Heaven be thanked for that!" exclaimed Eleanor. And then, as if ashamed
  of her own vehemence, and, it might seem, apparent indifference to another's
  fate, she inquired who was hurt.</p>

  <p>"It be poor neighbor Toft, that be killed by a thunderbolt, ma'am,"
  replied Plant.</p>

  <p>Exclamations of horror burst from all around.</p>

  <p>No one was more surprised at this intelligence than the sexton. Like many
  other seers, he had not, in all probability, calculated upon the fulfilment
  of his predictions, and he now stared aghast at the extent of his own
  foreknowledge.</p>

  <p>"I tell 'ee what, Master Peter," said Plant, shaking his bullet-head, "it
  be well for thee thou didn't live in my grandfather's time, or thou'dst ha'
  been ducked in a blanket; or may be burnt at the stake, like Ridley and
  Latimer, as we read on&mdash;but however that may be, ye shall hear how poor
  Toft's death came to pass, and nobody can tell 'ee better nor I, seeing I
  were near to him, poor fellow, at the time. Well, we thought as how the storm
  were all over&mdash;and had all got into order of march, and were just
  beginning to step up the avenue, the coffin-bearers pushing lustily along,
  and the torches shining grandly, when poor Simon Toft, who could never travel
  well in liquor in his life, reeled to one side, and staggering against the
  first huge lime-tree, sat himself down beneath it&mdash;thou knowest the tree
  I mean."</p>

  <p>"The tree of fate," returned Peter. "I ought, methinks, to know it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I were just stepping aside to pick him up, when all at once there
  comes such a crack of thunder, and, whizzing through the trees, flashed a
  great globe of red fire, so bright and dazzlin', it nearly blinded me; and
  when I opened my eyes, winkin' and waterin', I see'd that which blinded me
  more even than the flash&mdash;that which had just afore been poor Simon, but
  which was now a mass o' black smouldering ashes, clean consumed and
  destroyed&mdash;his clothes rent to a thousand tatters&mdash;the earth and
  stones tossed up, and scattered all about, and a great splinter of the tree
  lying beside him."</p>

  <p>"Heaven's will be done!" said the sexton; "this is an awful judgment."</p>

  <p>"And Sathan cast down; for this is a spice o' his handiwork," muttered
  Plant; adding, as he slunk away, "If ever Peter Bradley do come to the
  blanket, dang me if I don't lend a helpin' hand."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2-4"
     name="ch2-4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE FUNERAL</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">How like a silent stream, shaded by night,<br>
  And gliding softly with our windy sighs,<br>
  Moves the whole frame of this solemnity!<br>
  Tears, sighs, and blacks, filling the simile!<br>
  Whilst I, the only murmur in this grove<br>
  Of death, thus hollowly break forth.<br>
  <i>The Fatal Dowry.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WORD being given that the funeral train was fast
  approaching, the church door was thrown open, and the assemblage divided in
  two lines, to allow it admission.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, a striking change had taken place, even in this brief period,
  in the appearance of the night. The sky, heretofore curtained with darkness,
  was now illumined by a serene, soft moon, which, floating in a watery halo,
  tinged with silvery radiance the edges of a few ghostly clouds that hurried
  along the deep and starlit skies. The suddenness of the change could not fail
  to excite surprise and admiration, mingled with regret that the procession
  had not been delayed until the present time.</p>

  <p>Slowly and mournfully the train was seen to approach the churchyard,
  winding, two by two, with melancholy step, around the corner of the road.
  First came Dr. Small; then the mutes, with their sable panoply; next, the
  torch-bearers; next, those who sustained the coffin, bending beneath their
  ponderous burden, followed by Sir Ranulph and a long line of attendants, all
  plainly to be distinguished by the flashing torchlight. There was a slight
  halt at the gate, and the coffin changed supporters.</p>

  <p>"Ill luck betide them!" ejaculated Peter; "could they find no other place
  except that to halt at? Must Sir Piers be gatekeeper till next Yule! No,"
  added he, seeing what followed; "it will be poor Toft, after all."</p>

  <p>Following close upon the coffin came a rude shell, containing, as Peter
  rightly conjectured, the miserable remains of Simon Toft, who had met his
  fate in the manner described by Plant. The bolt of death glanced from the
  tree which it first struck, and reduced the unfortunate farmer to a heap of
  dust. Universal consternation prevailed, and doubts were entertained as to
  what course should be pursued. It was judged best by Dr. Small to remove the
  remains at once to the charnel-house. Thus "unanointed, unaneled, with all
  his imperfections on his head," was poor Simon Toft, in one brief second, in
  the twinkling of an eye, plunged from the height of festivity to the darkness
  of the grave, and so horribly disfigured, that scarce a vestige of humanity
  was discernible in the mutilated mass that remained of him. Truly may we be
  said to walk in blindness, and amidst deep pitfalls.</p>

  <p>The churchyard was thronged by the mournful train. The long array of dusky
  figures&mdash;the waving torchlight gleaming ruddily in the white
  moonshine&mdash;now glistening upon the sombre habiliments of the bearers,
  and on their shrouded load, now reflected upon the jagged branches of the
  yew-trees, or falling upon the ivied buttresses of the ancient church,
  constituted no unimpressive picture. Over all, like a lamp hung in the still
  sky, shone the moon, shedding a soothing, spiritual lustre over the
  scene.</p>

  <p>The organ broke into a solemn strain as the coffin was borne along the
  mid-aisle&mdash;the mourners following, with reverent step, and slow. It was
  deposited near the mouth of the vault, the whole assemblage circling around
  it. Dr. Small proceeded with the performance of that magnificent service
  appointed for the burial of the dead, in a tone as remarkable for its sadness
  as for its force and fervor. There was a tear in every eye&mdash;a cloud on
  every brow.</p>

  <p>Brightly illumined as was the whole building, there were still some
  recesses which, owing to the intervention of heavy pillars, were thrown into
  shade; and in one of these, supported by her mother and brother, stood
  Eleanor, a weeping witness of the scene. She beheld the coffin silently borne
  along; she saw one dark figure slowly following; she knew those pale
  features&mdash;oh, how pale they were! A year had wrought a fearful
  alteration; she could scarce credit what she beheld. He must, indeed, have
  suffered&mdash;deeply suffered; and her heart told her that his sorrows had
  been for her.</p>

  <p>Many a wistful look, besides, was directed to the principal figure in this
  ceremonial, Ranulph Rookwood. He was a prey to unutterable anguish of soul;
  his heart bled inwardly for the father he had lost. Mechanically following
  the body down the aisle, he had taken his station near it, gazing with
  confused vision upon the bystanders; had listened, with a sad composure, to
  the expressive delivery of Small, until he read&mdash;"<i>For man walketh in
  a vain shadow, and disquieteth himself in vain; he heapeth up riches, and
  cannot tell who shall gather them.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Verily!" exclaimed a deep voice; and Ranulph, looking round, met the eyes
  of Peter Bradley fixed full upon him. But it was evidently not the sexton who
  had spoken.</p>

  <p>Small continued the service. He arrived at this verse: "<i>Thou hast set
  our misdeeds before thee; and our secret sins in the light of thy
  countenance.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Even so!" exclaimed the voice; and as Ranulph raised his eyes in the
  direction of the sound, he thought he saw a dark figure, muffled in a cloak,
  disappear behind one of the pillars. He bestowed, however, at the moment,
  little thought upon this incident. His heart melted within him; and leaning
  his face upon his hand, he wept aloud.</p>

  <p>"Command yourself, I entreat of you, my dear Sir Ranulph," said Dr. Small,
  as soon as the service was finished, "and suffer this melancholy ceremonial
  to be completed." Saying which, he gently withdrew Ranulph from his support,
  and the coffin was lowered into the vault.</p>

  <p>Ranulph remained for some time in the extremity of sorrow. When he in part
  recovered, the crowd had dispersed, and few persons were remaining within the
  church; yet near him stood three apparent loiterers. They advanced towards
  him. An exclamation of surprise and joy burst from his lips.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor!"</p>

  <p>"Ranulph!"</p>

  <p>"Is it possible? Do I indeed behold you, Eleanor?"</p>

  <p>No other word was spoken. They rushed into each other's arms. Oh!
  sad&mdash;sad is the lover's parting&mdash;no pang so keen; but if life hath
  a zest more exquisite than others&mdash;if felicity hath one drop more racy
  than the rest in her honeyed cup, it is the happiness enjoyed in such a union
  as the present. To say that he was as one raised from the depths of misery by
  some angel comforter, were a feeble comparison of the transport of Ranulph.
  To paint the thrilling delight of Eleanor&mdash;the trembling
  tenderness&mdash;the fond abandonment which vanquished all her maiden
  scruples, would be impossible. Reluctantly yielding&mdash;fearing, yet
  complying, her lips were sealed in one long, loving kiss, the sanctifying
  pledge of their tried affection.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor, dear Eleanor," exclaimed Ranulph, "though I hold you within my
  arms&mdash;though each nerve within my frame assures me of your
  presence&mdash;though I look into those eyes, which seem fraught with greater
  endearment than ever I have known them wear&mdash;though I see and feel and
  know all this, so sudden, so unlooked for is the happiness, that I could
  almost doubt its reality. Say to what blessed circumstance I am indebted for
  this unlooked-for happiness."</p>

  <p>"We are staying not far hence, with friends, dear Ranulph; and my mother,
  hearing of Sir Piers Rookwood's death, and wishing to bury all animosity with
  him, resolved to be present at the sad ceremony. We were told you could not
  be here."</p>

  <p>"And would my presence have prevented your attendance, Eleanor?"</p>

  <p>"Not that, dear Ranulph; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what?"</p>

  <p>At this moment the advance of Mrs. Mowbray offered an interruption to
  their further discourse.</p>

  <p>"My son and I appear to be secondary in your regards, Sir Ranulph," said
  she, gravely.</p>

  <p>"<i>Sir</i> Ranulph!" mentally echoed the young man. "What will
  <i>she</i>think when she knows that that title is not mine? I dread to tell
  her." He then added aloud, with a melancholy smile, "I crave your pardon,
  madam; the delight of a meeting so unexpected with your daughter must plead
  my apology."</p>

  <p>"None is wanting, Sir Ranulph," said Major Mowbray. "I who have known what
  separation from my sister is, can readily excuse your feelings. But you look
  ill."</p>

  <p>"I have, indeed, experienced much mental anxiety," said Ranulph, looking
  at Eleanor; "it is now past, and I would fain hope that a brighter day is
  dawning." His heart answered, 'twas but a hope.</p>

  <p>"You were unlooked for here to-night, Sir Ranulph," said Mrs. Mowbray; "by
  us, at least: we were told you were abroad."</p>

  <p>"You were rightly informed, madam," replied Ranulph. "I only arrived this
  evening from Bordeaux."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you are returned. We are at present on a visit with your
  neighbors, the Davenhams, at Braybrook, and trust we shall see you
  there."</p>

  <p>"I will ride over to-morrow," replied Ranulph; "there is much on which I
  would consult you all. I would have ventured to request the favor of your
  company at Rookwood, had the occasion been other than the present."</p>

  <p>"And I would willingly have accepted your invitation," returned Mrs.
  Mowbray; "I should like to see the old house once more. During your father's
  lifetime I could not approach it. You are lord of broad lands, Sir
  Ranulph&mdash;a goodly inheritance."</p>

  <p>"Madam!"</p>

  <p>"And a proud title, which you will grace well, I doubt not. The first, the
  noblest of our house, was he from whom you derive your name. You are the
  third Sir Ranulph; the first founded the house of Rookwood; the next advanced
  it; 'tis for you to raise its glory to its height."</p>

  <p>"Alas! madam, I have no such thought."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore not? you are young, wealthy, powerful. With such domains as
  those of Rookwood&mdash;with such a title as its lord can claim, naught
  should be too high for your aspirations."</p>

  <p>"I aspire to nothing, madam, but your daughter's hand; and even that I
  will not venture to solicit until you are acquainted with&mdash;&mdash;" And
  he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"With what?" asked Mrs. Mowbray, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"A singular, and to me most perplexing event has occurred to-night,"
  replied Ranulph, "which may materially affect my future fortunes."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray. "Does it relate to your mother?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse my answering the question now, madam," replied Ranulph; "you shall
  know all to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Ay, to-morrow, dear Ranulph," said Eleanor; "and whatever that morrow may
  bring forth, it will bring happiness to me, if you are bearer of the
  tidings."</p>

  <p>"I shall expect your coming with impatience," said Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"And I," added Major Mowbray, who had listened thus far in silence, "would
  offer you my services in any way you think they would be useful. Command me
  as you think fitting."</p>

  <p>"I thank you heartily," returned Ranulph. "To-morrow you shall learn all.
  Meanwhile, it shall be my business to investigate the truth or falsehood of
  the statement I have heard, ere I report it to you. Till then, farewell."</p>

  <p>As they issued from the church it was gray dawn. Mrs. Mowbray's carriage
  stood at the door. The party entered it; and accompanied by Dr. Small, whom
  he found within in the vestry, Ranulph walked towards the hall, where a fresh
  surprise awaited him.</p>

  <div style="margin-left:10%">
    <p class="quote"><i>Black Will.</i> Which is the place where we're to be
    concealed?</p>

    <p class="quote"><i>Green.</i> This inner room.</p>

    <p class="quote"><i>Black Will.</i> 'Tis well. The word is, "Now I take
    you."</p>

    <p class="quote"><i>Arden of Feversham.</i></p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">GUARDED by the two young farmers who had displayed so much
  address in seizing him, Luke, meanwhile, had been conveyed in safety to the
  small chamber in the eastern wing, destined by Mr. Coates to be his place of
  confinement for the night. The room, or rather closet, opening from another
  room, was extremely well adapted for the purpose, having no perceptible
  outlet; being defended, on either side, by thick partition walls of the
  hardest oak, and at the extremity by the solid masonry of the mansion. It
  was, in fact, a remnant of the building anterior to the first Sir Ranulph's
  day; and the narrow limits of Luke's cell had been erected long before the
  date of his earliest progenitor. Having seen their prisoner safely bestowed,
  the room was carefully examined, every board sounded, every crevice and
  corner peered into by the curious eye of the little lawyer; and nothing being
  found insecure, the light was removed, the door locked, the rustic constables
  dismissed, and a brace of pistols having been loaded and laid on the table,
  Mr. Coates pronounced himself thoroughly satisfied and quite comfortable.</p>

  <p>Comfortable! Titus heaved a sigh as he echoed the word. He felt anything
  but comfortable. His heart was with the body all the while. He thought of the
  splendor of the funeral, the torches, the illumined church, his own dignified
  march down the aisle, and the effect he expected to produce amongst the
  bewildered rustics. He thought of all these things, and cursed Luke by all
  the saints in the calendar. The sight of the musty old apartment, hung round
  with faded arras, which, as he said, "smelt of nothing but rats and ghosts,
  and suchlike varmint," did not serve to inspirit him; and the proper
  equilibrium of his temper was not completely restored until the appearance of
  the butler, with all the requisites for the manufacture of punch, afforded
  him some prospective solace.</p>

  <p>"And what are they about now, Tim?" asked Titus.</p>

  <p>"All as jolly as can be," answered the domestic; "Dr. Small is just about
  to pronounce the funeral 'ration."</p>

  <p>"Devil take it," ejaculated Titus, "there's another miss! Couldn't I just
  slip out, and hear that?"</p>

  <p>"On no account," said Coates. "Consider, Sir Ranulph is there."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," rejoined Titus, heaving a deep sigh, and squeezing a lemon;
  "are you sure this is <i>biling</i> water, Tim? You know, I'm mighty
  particular."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly aware of it, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Tim, do you recollect the way I used to brew for poor Sir Piers, with
  a bunch of red currants at the bottom of the glass? And then to think that,
  after all, I should be left out of his funeral&mdash;it's the height of
  barbarity. Tim, this rum of yours is poor stuff&mdash;there's no punch worth
  the trouble of drinking, except whisky-punch. A glass of right potheen,
  straw-color, peat-flavor, ten degrees over proof, would be the only thing to
  drown my cares. Any such thing in the cellar? There used to be an odd bottle
  or so, Tim&mdash;in the left bin, near the door."</p>

  <p>"I've a notion there be," returned Timothy. "I'll try the bin your honor
  mentions, and if I can lay hands upon a bottle you shall have it, you may
  depend."</p>

  <p>The butler departed, and Titus, emulating Mr. Coates, who had already
  enveloped himself, like Juno at the approach of Ixion, in a cloud, proceeded
  to light his pipe.</p>

  <p>Luke, meanwhile, had been left alone, without light. He had much to
  meditate upon, and with naught to check the current of his thoughts, he
  pensively revolved his present situation and future prospects. The future was
  gloomy enough&mdash;the present fraught with danger. And now that the fever
  of excitement was passed, he severely reproached himself for his
  precipitancy.</p>

  <p>His mind, by degrees, assumed a more tranquil state; and, exhausted with
  his great previous fatigue, he threw himself upon the floor of his
  prison-house, and addressed himself to slumber. The noise he made induced
  Coates to enter the room, which he did with a pistol in each hand, followed
  by Titus with a pipe and candle; but finding all safe the sentinels
  retired.</p>

  <p>"One may see, with half an eye, that you're not used to a feather-bed, my
  friend," said Titus, as the door was locked. "By the powers, he's a tall
  chap, anyhow&mdash;why his feet almost touch the door. I should say that room
  was a matter of six feet long, Mr. Coates."</p>

  <p>"Exactly six feet, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's a good guess. Hang that ugly rascal, Tim; he's never brought
  the whisky. But I'll be even with him to-morrow. Couldn't you just see to the
  prisoner for ten minutes, Mr. Coates?"</p>

  <p>"Not ten seconds. I shall report you, if you stir from your post."</p>

  <p>Here the door was opened, and Tim entered with the whisky.</p>

  <p>"Arrah! by my soul, Tim, and here you are at last&mdash;uncork it, man,
  and give us a thimbleful&mdash;blob! there goes the stopper&mdash;here's a
  glass"&mdash;smacking his lips&mdash;"whist, Tim, another drop&mdash;stuff
  like this will never hurt a body. Mr. Coates, try it&mdash;no&mdash;I thought
  you'd be a man of more taste."</p>

  <p>"I must limit you to a certain quantity," replied Coates, "or you will not
  be fit to keep guard&mdash;another glass must be the extent of your
  allowance."</p>

  <p>"Another glass! and do you think I'll submit to any such iniquitous
  proposition?"</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, gentlemen," said Tim, "but her ladyship desires me to tell
  you both, that she trusts you will keep the strictest watch upon the
  prisoner. I have the same message also from Sir Ranulph."</p>

  <p>"Do you hear that?" said Coates.</p>

  <p>"And what are they all about now, Tim?" groaned Titus.</p>

  <p>"Just starting, sir," returned Tim; "and, indeed, I must not lose my time
  gossiping here, for I be wanted below. You must be pleased to take care of
  yourselves, gentlemen, for an hour or so, for there will be only a few
  women-kind left in the house. The storm's just over, and the men are all
  lighting their torches. Oh, it's a grand sight!" And off set Tim.</p>

  <p>"Bad luck to myself, anyhow," ejaculated Titus; "this is more than I can
  bear&mdash;I've had enough of this watch and ward business&mdash;if the
  prisoner stirs, shoot him, if you think proper&mdash;I'll be back in an
  hour."</p>

  <p>"I tell you what, Mr. Tyrconnel," said Coates, coolly taking up the pistol
  from the table, "I'm a man of few words, but those few are, I hope, to the
  purpose, and I'd have you to know if you stir from that chair, or attempt to
  leave the room, damme but I'll send a brace of bullets after you. I'm
  serious, I assure you." And he cocked the pistol.</p>

  <p>By way of reply to this menace, Titus deliberately filled a stiff glass of
  whisky-and-water.</p>

  <p>"That's your last glass," said the inexorable Coates.</p>

  <p>To return once more to Luke. He slept uneasily for some short space, and
  was awakened by a sound which reached his dreaming ears and connected itself
  with the visions that slumber was weaving around him. It was some moments
  before he could distinctly remember where he was. He would not venture to
  sleep again, though he felt overwhelmed by drowsiness&mdash;there was a fixed
  pain at his heart, as if circulation were suspended. Changing his posture, he
  raised himself upon one arm; he then became aware of a scratching noise,
  somewhat similar to the sound he had heard in his dream, and perceived a
  light gleaming through a crevice in the oaken partition. His attention was
  immediately arrested, and placing his eye close to the chink, he distinctly
  saw a dark lantern burning, and by its light a man filing some implement of
  housebreaking. The light fell before the hard features of the man, with whose
  countenance Luke was familiar; and although only one person came within the
  scope of his view, Luke could make out, from a muttered conversation that was
  carried on, that he had a companion. The parties were near to him, and though
  speaking in a low tone, Luke's quick ear caught the following:</p>

  <p>"What keeps Jack Palmer, I wonder?" said he of the file. "We're all ready
  for the fakement&mdash;pops primed&mdash;and I tell you what, Rob Rust, I've
  made my clasp-knife as sharp as a razor, and damme, if Lady Rookwood offers
  any resistance, I'll spoil her talking in future, I promise you."</p>

  <p>Suppressed laughter from Rust followed this speech. That laugh made Luke's
  blood run cold within his veins.</p>

  <p>"Harkee, Dick Wilder, you're a reg'lar out-and-outer, and stops at
  nothing, and curse me if I'd think any more of it than yourself. But Jack's
  as squeamish of bloodshed as young Miss that cries at her cut finger. It's
  the safer plan. Say what you will, nothing but <i>that</i> will stop a
  woman's tongue."</p>

  <p>"I shall make short work with her ladyship to-night, anyhow. Hist! here
  Jack comes."</p>

  <p>A footstep crossed in the room, and, presently afterwards, exclamations of
  surprise and smothered laughter were heard from the parties.</p>

  <p>"Bravo, Jack! famous! that disguise would deceive the devil himself."</p>

  <p>"And now, my lads," said the newcomer, "is all right?"</p>

  <p>"Right and tight."</p>

  <p>"Nothing forgotten?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Then off with your stamps, and on with your list slippers; not a word.
  Follow me, and, for your lives, don't move a step but as I direct you. The
  word must be, '<i>Sir Piers Rookwood calls</i>.' We'll overhaul the swag
  here. This crack may make us all for life; and if you'll follow my directions
  implicitly, we'll do the trick in style. This slum must be our rendezvous
  when all's over; for hark ye, my lads, I'll not budge an inch till Luke
  Bradley be set free. He's an old friend, and I always stick by old friends.
  I'd do the same for one of you if you were in the same scrape, so, damn you,
  no flinching; besides, I owe that spider-shanked, snivelling split-cause
  Coates, who stands sentry, a grudge, and I'll pay him off, as Paul did the
  Ephesians. You may crop his ears, or slit his tongue as you would a magpie's,
  or any other chattering varmint; make him sign his own testament, or treat
  him with a touch of your <i>Habeas Corpus</i> Act, if you think proper, or
  give him a taste of blue plumb. One thing only I stipulate, that you don't
  hurt that fat, mutton-headed Broganeer, whatever he may say or do; he's a
  devilish good fellow. And now to business."</p>

  <p>Saying which, they noiselessly departed. But carefully as the door was
  closed, Luke's ear could detect the sound. His blood boiled with indignation;
  and he experienced what all must have felt who have been similarly situated,
  with the will, but not the power, to assist another&mdash;a sensation almost
  approaching to torture. At this moment a distant scream burst upon his
  ears&mdash;another&mdash;he hesitated no longer. With all his force he
  thundered at the door.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, rascal?" cried Coates, from without.</p>

  <p>"There are robbers in the house."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the information. There is one I know of already."</p>

  <p>"Fool, they are in Lady Rookwood's room. Run to her assistance."</p>

  <p>"A likely story, and leave you here."</p>

  <p>"Do you hear that scream?"</p>

  <p>"Eh, what&mdash;what's that? I do hear something." Here Luke dashed with
  all his force against the door. It yielded to the blow, and he stood before
  the astonished attorney.</p>

  <p>"Advance a footstep, villain," exclaimed Coates, presenting both his
  pistols, "and I lodge a brace of balls in your head."</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," said Luke; "the robbers are in Lady Rookwood's
  chamber&mdash;they will plunder the place of everything&mdash;perhaps murder
  her. Fly to her assistance, I will accompany you&mdash;assist you&mdash;it is
  your only chance."</p>

  <p>"<i>My</i> only chance&mdash;<i>your</i> only chance. Do you take me for a
  greenhorn? This is a poor subterfuge; could you not have vamped up something
  better? Get back to your own room, or I shall make no more of shooting you
  than I would of snuffing that candle."</p>

  <p>"Be advised, sir," continued Luke. "There are three of them&mdash;give me
  a pistol, and fear nothing."</p>

  <p>"Give <i>you</i> a pistol! Ha, ha!&mdash;to be its mark myself. You are an
  amusing rascal, I will say."</p>

  <p>"Sir, I tell you not a moment is to be lost. Is life nothing? Lady
  Rookwood may be murdered."</p>

  <p>"I tell <i>you</i>, once for all, it won't do. Go back to your room, or
  take the consequences."</p>

  <p>"By the powers! but it shall do, anyhow," exclaimed Titus, flinging
  himself upon the attorney, and holding both his arms; "you've bullied me long
  enough. I'm sure the lad's in the right."</p>

  <p>Luke snatched the pistols from the hands of Coates.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr. Tyrconnel; very well, sir," cried the attorney, boiling
  with wrath, and spluttering out his words. "Extremely well, sir. You are not
  perhaps aware, sir, what you have done; but you will repent this,
  sir&mdash;repent, I say&mdash;repent was my word, Mr. Tyrconnel."</p>

  <p>"Poh!&mdash;poh!" replied Titus. "I shall never repent a good-natured
  action."</p>

  <p>"Follow me," cried Luke; "settle your disputes hereafter. Quick, or we
  shall be too late."</p>

  <p>Coates bustled after him, and Titus, putting the neck of the forbidden
  whisky bottle to his lips, and gulping down a hasty mouthful, snatched up a
  rusty poker, and followed the party with more alacrity than might have been
  expected from so portly a personage.</p>

     name="ch2-6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE APPARITION</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Gibbet.</i> Well, gentlemen, 'tis a fine night for our
  enterprise.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Hounslow.</i> Dark as hell.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Bagshot.</i> And blows like the devil.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Boniface.</i> You'll have no creature to deal with but
  the ladies.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Gibbet.</i> And I can assure you, friend, there's a great
  deal of address, and good manners, in robbing a lady. I am the most of a
  gentleman, that way, that ever travelled the road.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Beaux Stratagem.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">ACCOMPANIED by her son, Lady Rookwood, on quitting the
  chamber of the dead, returned to her own room. She then renewed all her
  arguments; had recourse to passionate supplications&mdash;to violent threats,
  but without effect. Ranulph maintained profound silence. Passion, as it ever
  doth, defeated its own ends; and Lady Rookwood, seeing the ill effect her
  anger would probably produce, gradually softened the asperity of her manner,
  and suffered him to depart.</p>

  <p>Left to herself, and to the communings of her own troubled spirit, her
  fortitude, in a measure, forsook her, under the pressure of the difficulties
  by which she was environed. There was no plan she could devise&mdash;no
  scheme adopt, unattended with peril. She must act alone&mdash;with
  promptitude and secrecy. To win her son over was her chief desire, and that,
  at all hazards, she was resolved to do. But how? She knew of only one point
  on which he was vulnerable&mdash;his love for Eleanor Mowbray. By raising
  doubts in his mind, and placing fresh difficulties in his path, she might
  compel him to acquiesce in her machinations, as a necessary means of
  accomplishing his own object. This she hoped to effect. Still there was a
  depth of resolution in the placid stream of Ranulph's character which she had
  often noticed with apprehension. Aware of his firmness, she dreaded lest his
  sense of justice should be stronger than his passion.</p>

  <p>As she wove these webs of darkness, fear, hitherto unknown, took
  possession of her soul. She listened to the howling of the wind&mdash;to the
  vibration of the rafters&mdash;to the thunder's roar, and to the hissing
  rain&mdash;till she, who never trembled at the thought of danger, became
  filled with vague uneasiness. Lights were ordered; and when her old attendant
  returned. Lady Rookwood fixed a look so wistful upon her, that Agnes ventured
  to address her.</p>

  <p>"Bless you, my lady," said the ancient handmaiden, trembling, "you look
  very pale, and no wonder. I feel sick at heart, too. Oh! I shall be glad when
  they return from the church, and happier still when the morning dawns. I
  can't sleep a wink&mdash;can't close my eyes, but I think of him."</p>

  <p>"Of <i>him</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Of Sir Piers, my lady; for though he's dead, I don't think he's
  gone."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"Why, my lady, the corruptible part of him's gone, sure enough. But the
  incorruptible, as Dr. Small calls it&mdash;the sperrit, my lady. It might be
  my fancy, your ladyship; but as I'm standing here, when I went back into the
  room just now for the lights, as I hope to live, I thought I saw Sir Piers in
  the room."</p>

  <p>"You are crazed, Agnes."</p>

  <p>"No, my lady, I'm not crazed; it was mere fancy, no doubt. Oh, it's a
  blessed thing to live with an easy conscience&mdash;a thrice blessed thing to
  <i>die</i> with an easy one, and that's what I never shall, I'm afeard. Poor
  Sir Piers! I'd mumble a prayer for him, if I durst."</p>

  <p>"Leave me," said Lady Rookwood, impatiently.</p>

  <p>And Agnes quitted the room.</p>

  <p>"What if the dead can return?" thought Lady Rookwood. "All men doubt it,
  yet all men believe it. <i>I</i> would not believe it, were there not a
  creeping horror that overmasters me, when I think of the state beyond the
  grave&mdash;that intermediate state, for such it must be, when the body lieth
  mouldering in the ground, and the soul survives, to wander, unconfined, until
  the hour of doom. And doth the soul survive when disenthralled? Is it
  dependent on the body? Does it perish with the body? These are doubts I
  cannot resolve. But if I deemed there was no future state, this hand should
  at once liberate me from my own weaknesses&mdash;my fears&mdash;my life.
  There is but one path to acquire that knowledge, which, once taken, can never
  be retraced. I am content to live&mdash;while living, to be feared&mdash;it
  may be, hated; when dead, to be contemned&mdash;yet still remembered. Ha!
  what sound was that? A stifled scream! Agnes!&mdash;without there! She is
  full of fears. I am not free from them myself, but I will shake them off.
  This will divert their channel," continued she, drawing from her bosom the
  marriage certificate. "This will arouse the torpid current of my
  blood&mdash;'<i>Piers Rookwood to Susan Bradley</i>.' And by whom was it
  solemnized? The name is Checkley&mdash;Richard Checkley. Ha! I bethink
  me&mdash;a Papist priest&mdash;a recusant&mdash;who was for some time an
  inmate of the hall. I have heard of this man&mdash;he was afterwards
  imprisoned, but escaped&mdash;he is either dead or in a foreign land. No
  witnesses&mdash;'tis well! Methinks Sir Piers Rookwood did well to preserve
  this. It shall light his funeral pyre. Would he could now behold me, as I
  consume it!"</p>

  <p>She held the paper in the direction of the candle; but, ere it could touch
  the flame, it dropped from her hand. As if her horrible wish had been
  granted, before her stood the figure of her husband! Lady Rookwood started
  not. No sign of trepidation or alarm, save the sudden stiffening of her form,
  was betrayed. Her bosom ceased to palpitate&mdash;her respiration
  stopped&mdash;her eyes were fixed upon the apparition.</p>

  <p>The figure appeared to regard her sternly. It was at some little distance,
  within the shade cast by the lofty bedstead. Still she could distinctly
  discern it. There was no ocular deception; it was attired in the costume Sir
  Piers was wont to wear&mdash;a hunting dress. All that her son had told her
  rushed to her recollection. The phantom advanced. Its countenance was pale,
  and wore a gloomy frown.</p>

  <p>"What would you destroy?" demanded the apparition, in a hollow tone.</p>

  <p>"The evidence of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Your marriage."</p>

  <p>"With yourself, accursed woman?"</p>

  <p>"With Susan Bradley."</p>

  <p>"What's that I hear?" shouted the figure, in an altered tone. "Married to
  her! then Luke <i>is</i> legitimate, and heir to this estate!" Whereupon the
  apparition rushed to the table, and laid a very substantial grasp upon the
  document. "A marriage certificate!" ejaculated the spectre; "here's a piece
  of luck! It ain't often in our lottery life we draw a prize like this. One
  way or the other, it must turn up a few cool thousands."</p>

  <p>"Restore that paper, villain," exclaimed Lady Rookwood, recovering all the
  audacity natural to her character the instant she discovered the earthly
  nature of the intruder&mdash;"restore it, or, by Heaven, you shall rue your
  temerity."</p>

  <p>"Softly, softly," replied the pseudo-phantom, with one hand pushing back
  the lady, while the other conveyed the precious document to the custody of
  his nether man&mdash;"softly," said he, giving the buckskin pocket a
  slap&mdash;"two words to that, my lady. I know its value as well as yourself,
  and must make my market. The highest offer has me, your ladyship; he's but a
  poor auctioneer that knocks down his ware when only one bidder is present.
  Luke Bradley, or, as I find he now is, Sir Luke Rookwood, may come down more
  handsomely."</p>

  <p>"Who are you, ruffian, and to what end is this masquerade assumed? If for
  the purpose of terrifying me into compliance with the schemes of that madman,
  Luke Bradley, whom I presume to be your confederate, your labor is
  misspent&mdash;your stolen disguise has no more weight with me than his
  forged claims."</p>

  <p>"Forged claims! Egad, he must be a clever hand to have forged that
  certificate. Your ladyship, however, is in error. Sir Luke Rookwood is no
  associate of mine; I am his late father's friend. But I have no time to bandy
  talk. What money have you in the house? Be alive."</p>

  <p>"You <i>are</i> a robber, then?"</p>

  <p>"Not I. I'm a tax-gatherer&mdash;a collector of Rich-Rates&mdash;ha, ha!
  What plate have you got? Nay, don't be alarmed&mdash;take it
  quietly&mdash;these things can't be helped&mdash;better make up your mind to
  do it without more ado&mdash;much the best plan&mdash;no screaming, it may
  injure your lungs, and can alarm nobody. Your maids have done as much
  before&mdash;it's beneath your dignity to make so much noise. So, you will
  not heed me? As you will." Saying which, he deliberately cut the bell-cord,
  and drew out a brace of pistols at the same time.</p>

  <p>"Agnes!" shrieked Lady Rookwood, now seriously alarmed.</p>

  <p>"I must caution your ladyship to be silent," said the robber, who, as our
  readers will no doubt have already conjectured, was no other than the
  redoubted Jack Palmer. "Agnes is already disposed of," said he, cocking a
  pistol. "However like your deceased 'lord and master' I may appear, you will
  find you have got a very different spirit from that of Sir Piers to deal
  with. I am naturally the politest man breathing&mdash;have been accounted the
  best-bred man on the road by every lady whom I have had the honor of
  addressing; and I should be sorry to sully my well-earned reputation by
  anything like rudeness. I must use a little force, of the gentlest kind.
  Perhaps you will permit me to hand you to a chair. Bless me! what a wrist
  your ladyship has got. Excuse me if I hurt you, but you are so devilish
  strong. What ho! 'Sir Piers Rookwood calls&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Ready," cried a voice.</p>

  <p>"That's the word," rejoined another; "ready;" and immediately two men,
  their features entirely hidden by a shroud of black crape, accoutred in rough
  attire, and each armed with pistols, rushed into the room.</p>

  <p>"Lend a hand," said Jack.</p>

  <p>Even in this perilous extremity Lady Rookwood's courage did not desert
  her. Anticipating their purpose, ere her assailants could reach her she
  extricated herself from Palmer's grasp, and rushed upon the foremost so
  unexpectedly, that, before the man could seize her, she snatched a pistol
  from his hand, and presented it at the group with an aspect like that of a
  tigress at bay&mdash;her eye wandering from one to the other, as if selecting
  a mark.</p>

  <p>There was a pause of a few seconds, in which the men glanced at the lady,
  and then at their leader. Jack looked blank.</p>

  <p>"Hem!" said he, coolly; "this is something new&mdash;disarmed&mdash;defied
  by a petticoat. Hark ye, Rob Rust, the disgrace rests with you. Clear your
  character, by securing her at once. What! afraid of a woman?"</p>

  <p>"A woman!" repeated Rust, in a surly tone; "devilish like a woman, indeed.
  Few men could do what she has done. Give the word, and I fire. As to seizing
  her, that's more than I'll engage to do."</p>

  <p>"You are a coward," cried Jack. "I will steer clear of blood&mdash;if I
  can help it. Come, madam, surrender, like the more sensible part of your sex,
  at discretion. You will find resistance of no avail." And he stepped boldly
  towards her.</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood pulled the trigger. The pistol flashed in the pan. She flung
  away the useless weapon without a word.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" said Jack, as he leisurely stooped to pick up the pistol, and
  approached her ladyship; "the bullet is not yet cast that is to be my billet.
  Here," said he, dealing Rust a heavy thump upon the shoulder with the
  butt-end of the piece, "take back your snapper, and look you prick the
  touchhole, or your barking-iron will never bite for you. And now, madam, I
  must take the liberty of again handing you to a seat. Dick Wilder, the
  cord&mdash;quick. It distresses me to proceed to such lengths with your
  ladyship&mdash;but safe bind, safe find, as Mr. Coates would say."</p>

  <p>"You will not bind me, ruffian."</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship is very much mistaken&mdash;I have no
  alternative&mdash;your ladyship's wrist is far too dexterous to be at
  liberty. I must furthermore request of your ladyship to be less
  vociferous&mdash;you interrupt business, which should be transacted with
  silence and deliberation."</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood's rage and vexation at this indignity were beyond all
  bounds. Resistance, however, was useless, and she submitted in silence. The
  cord was passed tightly round her arms, when it flashed upon her recollection
  for the first time that Coates and Tyrconnel, who were in charge of her
  captive in the lower corridor, might be summoned to her assistance. This idea
  no sooner crossed her mind than she uttered a loud and prolonged scream.</p>

  <p>"'Sdeath!" cried Jack; "civility is wasted here. Give me the gag,
  Rob."</p>

  <p>"Better slit her squeaking-pipe at once," replied Rust, drawing his
  clasped knife; "she'll thwart everything."</p>

  <p>"The gag, I say, not <i>that</i>."</p>

  <p>"I can't find the gag," exclaimed Wilder, savagely. "Leave Rob Rust to
  manage her&mdash;he'll silence her, I warrant you, while you and I rummage
  the room."</p>

  <p>"Ay, leave her to me," said the other miscreant. "Go about your business,
  and take no heed. Her hands are fast&mdash;she can't scratch. I'll do it with
  a single gash&mdash;send her to join her lord, whom she loved so well, before
  he's under ground. They'll have something to see when they come home from the
  master's funeral&mdash;their mistress <i>cut and dry</i> for another. Ho,
  ho!"</p>

  <p>"Mercy, mercy!" shrieked Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, I'll be merciful," said Rust, brandishing his knife before her
  eyes. "I'll not be long about it. Leave her to me&mdash;I'll give her a taste
  of Sir Sydney."</p>

  <p>"No, no, Rust; no bloodshed," said Jack, authoritatively; "I'll find some
  other way to gag the jade."</p>

  <p>At this moment a noise of rapid footsteps was heard within the
  passage.</p>

  <p>"Assistance comes," screamed Lady Rookwood. "Help! help!"</p>

  <p>"To the door!" cried Jack. The words were scarcely out of his mouth before
  Luke dashed into the room, followed by Coates and Tyrconnel.</p>

  <p>Palmer and his companions levelled their pistols at the intruders, and the
  latter would have fired, but Jack's keen eye having discerned Luke amongst
  the foremost, checked further hostilities for the present. Lady Rookwood,
  meanwhile, finding herself free from restraint, rushed towards her
  deliverers, and crouched beneath Luke's protecting arms, which were extended,
  pistol in hand, over her head. Behind them stood Titus Tyrconnel, flourishing
  the poker, and Mr. Coates, who, upon the sight of so much warlike
  preparation, began somewhat to repent having rushed so precipitately into the
  lion's den.</p>

  <p>"Luke Bradley!" exclaimed Palmer, stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"Luke Bradley!" echoed Lady Rookwood, recoiling and staring into his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Fear nothing, madam," cried Luke. "I am here to assist you&mdash;I will
  defend you with my life."</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> defend <i>me</i>!" exclaimed Lady Rookwood, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Even <i>I</i>," cried Luke, "strange as it may sound."</p>

  <p>"Holy powers protect me!" ejaculated Titus. "As I live, it is Sir Piers
  himself."</p>

  <p>"Sir Piers!" echoed Coates, catching the infection of terror, as he
  perceived Palmer more distinctly. "What! is the dead come to life again? A
  ghost, a ghost!"</p>

  <p>"By my soul," cried Titus, "it's the first ghost I ever heard of that
  committed a burglary in its own house, and on the night of the body's burial,
  too. But who the devil are these? maybe they're ghosts likewise."</p>

  <p>"They are," said Palmer, in a hollow tone, mimicking the voice of Sir
  Piers, "attendant spirits. We are come for this woman; her time is out; so no
  more palavering, Titus. Lend a hand to take her to the churchyard, and be
  hanged to you."</p>

  <p>"Upon my conscience, Mr. Coates," cried Titus, "it's either the devil, or
  Sir Piers. We'll be only in the way here. He's only just settling his old
  scores with his lady. I thought it would come to this long ago. We'd best
  beat a retreat."</p>

  <p>Jack took advantage of the momentary confusion created by this incidental
  alarm at his disguise to direct Rust towards the door by which the new comers
  had entered; and, this being accomplished, he burst into a loud laugh.</p>

  <p>"What! not know me?" cried he&mdash;"not know your old friend with a new
  face, Luke? Nor you, Titus? Nor you, who can see through a millstone, lawyer
  Coates, don't you recognize&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jack Palmer, as I'm a sinner!" cried Titus. "Why, this beats Banaghan.
  Arrah! Jack, honey, what does this mean? Is it yourself I see in such
  company? You're not robbing in earnest?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed but I am, friend Titus," exclaimed Jack; "and <i>it is</i> my own
  self you see. I just took the liberty of borrowing Sir Piers's old
  hunting-coat from the justice-room. You said my toggery wouldn't do for the
  funeral. I'm no other than plain Jack Palmer, after all."</p>

  <p>"With half a dozen aliases at your back, I dare say," cried Coates.
  "<i>I</i> suspected you all along. All your praise of highwaymen was not lost
  upon me. No, no; I <i>can</i> see into a millstone, be it ever so thick."</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Jack, "I'm sorry to see you here, friend Titus. Keep
  quiet, and you shall come to no harm. As to you, Luke Bradley, you have
  anticipated my intention by half an hour; I meant to set you free. For you,
  Mr. Coates, you may commit all future care of your affairs to your executors,
  administrators, and assigns. You will have no further need to trouble
  yourself with worldly concerns," added he, levelling a pistol at the
  attorney, who, however, shielded himself, in an agony of apprehension, behind
  Luke's person. "Stand aside, Luke."</p>

  <p>"I stir not," replied Luke. "I thank you for your good intention, and will
  not injure you&mdash;that is, if you do not force me to do so. I am here to
  defend her ladyship."</p>

  <p>"What's that you say?" returned Jack, in surprise&mdash;"<i>defend</i> her
  ladyship?"</p>

  <p>"With my life," replied Luke. "Let me counsel you to depart."</p>

  <p>"Are you mad? Defend her&mdash;Lady Rookwood&mdash;your enemy&mdash;who
  would hang you? Tut, tut! Stand aside, I say, Luke Bradley, or look to
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"You had better consider well ere you proceed," said Luke. "You know me of
  old. I have taken odds as great, and not come off the vanquished."</p>

  <p>"The odds are even," cried Titus, "if Mr. Coates will but show fight. I'll
  stand by you to the last, my dear boy. You're the right son of your father,
  though on the wrong side. Och! Jack Palmer, my jewel, no wonder you resemble
  Dick Turpin."</p>

  <p>"You hear this?" cried Luke.</p>

  <p>"Hot-headed fool!" muttered Jack.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you shoot him on the spot?" said Wilder.</p>

  <p>"And mar my own chance," thought Jack. "No, that will never do; his life
  is not to be thrown away. Be quiet," said he, in a whisper to Wilder; "I've
  another card to play, which shall serve us better than all the plunder here.
  No harm must come to that youngster; his life is worth thousands to us."
  Then, turning to Luke, he continued, "I'm loth to hurt you; yet what can I
  do? You must have the worst of it if we come to a pitched battle. I therefore
  advise you, as a friend, to draw off your forces. We are three to three, it
  is true; but two of <i>your</i> party are unarmed."</p>

  <p>"Unarmed!" interrupted Titus. "Devil burn me! this iron shillelah shall
  convince you to the contrary, Jack, or any of your friends."</p>

  <p>"Make ready then, my lads," cried Palmer.</p>

  <p>"Stop a minute," exclaimed Coates. "This gets serious; it will end in
  homicide&mdash;in murder. We shall all have our throats cut to a certainty;
  and though these rascals will as certainly be hanged for it, that will be
  poor satisfaction to the sufferers. Had we not better refer the matter to
  arbitration?"</p>

  <p>"I'm for fighting it out," said Titus, whisking the poker round his head
  like a flail in action. "My blood's up. Come on, Jack Palmer, I'm for
  you."</p>

  <p>"I should vote for retreating," chattered the attorney, "if that cursed
  fellow had not placed a <i>ne exeat</i> at the door."</p>

  <p>"Give the word, captain," cried Rust, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," echoed Wilder.</p>

  <p>"A skilful general always parleys," said Jack. "A word in your ear, Luke,
  ere that be done which cannot be undone."</p>

  <p>"You mean me no treachery?" returned Luke.</p>

  <p>Jack made no answer, but uncocking his pistols, deposited them within his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"Shoot him as he advances," whispered Coates; "he is in your power
  now."</p>

  <p>"Scoundrel!" replied Luke, "do you think me as base as yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush! for God's sake don't expose me," said Coates.</p>

  <p>Lady Rookwood had apparently listened to this singular conference with
  sullen composure, though in reality she was racked with anxiety as to its
  results; and, now apprehending that Palmer was about to make an immediate
  disclosure to Luke, she accosted him as he passed her.</p>

  <p>"Unbind me!" cried she, "and what you wish shall be
  yours&mdash;money&mdash;jewels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ha! may I depend?"</p>

  <p>"I pledge my word."</p>

  <p>Palmer untied the cord, and Lady Rookwood, approaching a table whereon
  stood the escritoire, touched a spring, and a secret drawer flew open.</p>

  <p>"You do this of your own free will?" asked Luke. "Speak, if it be
  otherwise."</p>

  <p>"I do," returned the lady, hastily.</p>

  <p>Palmer's eyes glistened at the treasures exposed to his view.</p>

  <p>"They are jewels of countless price. Take them, and rid me," she added in
  a whisper, "of <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>"Luke Bradley?"</p>

  <p>"Ay."</p>

  <p>"Give them to me."</p>

  <p>"They are yours freely on those terms."</p>

  <p>"You hear that, Luke," cried he, aloud; "you hear it, Titus; this is no
  robbery. Mr. Coates&mdash;'Know all men by these <i>presents</i>'&mdash;I
  call you to witness, Lady Rookwood gives me these pretty things."</p>

  <p>"I do," returned she; adding, in a whisper, "on the terms which I
  proposed."</p>

  <p>"Must it be done at once?"</p>

  <p>"Without an instant's delay."</p>

  <p>"Before your own eyes?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not to look on. Each moment is precious. He is off his guard now.
  You do it, you know, in self-defence."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>"For the same cause."</p>

  <p>"Yet he came here to aid you?"</p>

  <p>"What of that?"</p>

  <p>"He would have risked his life for yours?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot pay back the obligation. He must die!"</p>

  <p>"The document?"</p>

  <p>"Will be useless then."</p>

  <p>"Will not that suffice; why aim at life?"</p>

  <p>"You trifle with me. You fear to do it."</p>

  <p>"<i>Fear!</i>"</p>

  <p>"About it, then; you shall have more gold."</p>

  <p>"I will about it," cried Jack, throwing the casket to Wilder, and seizing
  Lady Rookwood's hands. "I am no Italian bravo, madam&mdash;no
  assassin&mdash;no remorseless cut-throat. What are you&mdash;devil or
  woman&mdash;who ask me to do this? Luke Bradley, I say."</p>

  <p>"Would you betray me?" cried Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"You have betrayed yourself, madam. Nay, nay, Luke, hands off. See, Lady
  Rookwood, how you would treat a friend. This strange fellow would blow out my
  brains for laying a finger upon your ladyship."</p>

  <p>"I will suffer no injury to be done to her," said Luke; "release her."</p>

  <p>"Your ladyship hears him," said Jack. "And you, Luke, shall learn the
  value set upon your generosity. You will not have <i>her</i> injured. This
  instant she has proposed, nay, paid for <i>your</i> assassination."</p>

  <p>"How?" exclaimed Luke, recoiling.</p>

  <p>"A lie, as black as hell," cried Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"A truth, as clear as heaven," retained Jack. "I will speedily convince
  you of the fact." Then, turning to Lady Rookwood, he whispered, "Shall I give
  him the marriage document?"</p>

  <p>"Beware!" said Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"Do I avouch the truth, then?"</p>

  <p>She was silent.</p>

  <p>"I am answered," said Luke.</p>

  <p>"Then leave her to her fate," cried Jack.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Luke; "she is still a woman, and I will not abandon her to
  ruffianly violence. Set her free."</p>

  <p>"You are a fool," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"Hurrah, hurrah!" vociferated Coates, who had rushed to the window.
  "Rescue, rescue! they are returning from the church; I see the torchlight in
  the avenue; we are saved!"</p>

  <p>"Hell and the devil!" cried Jack; "not an instant is to be lost. Alive,
  lads; bring off all the plunder you can; be handy!"</p>

  <p>"Lady Rookwood, I bid you farewell," said Luke, in a tone in which scorn
  and sorrow were blended. "We shall meet again."</p>

  <p>"We have not parted yet," returned she; "will you let this man pass? A
  thousand pounds for his life."</p>

  <p>"Upon the nail?" asked Rust.</p>

  <p>"By the living God, if any of you attempt to touch him, I will blow his
  brains out upon the spot, be he friend or foe," cried Jack. "Luke Bradley,
  <i>we</i> shall meet again. You shall hear from me."</p>

  <p>"Lady Rookwood," said Luke, as he departed, "I shall not forget this
  night."</p>

  <p>"Is all ready?" asked Palmer of his comrades.</p>

  <p>"All."</p>

  <p>"Then budge."</p>

  <p>"Stay!" cried Lady Rookwood, in a whisper to him. "What will purchase that
  document?"</p>

  <p>"Hem!"</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>"Double it."</p>

  <p>"It <i>shall</i> be doubled."</p>

  <p>"I will turn it over."</p>

  <p>"Resolve me now."</p>

  <p>"You shall hear from me."</p>

  <p>"In what manner?"</p>

  <p>"I will find speedy means."</p>

  <p>"Your name is Palmer?"</p>

  <p>"Palmer is the name he goes by, your ladyship," replied Coates, "but it is
  the fashion with these rascals to have an alias."</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha!" said Jack, thrusting the ramrod into his pistol-barrel, "are you
  there, Mr. Coates? Pay your wager, sir."</p>

  <p>"What wager?"</p>

  <p>"The hundred we bet that you would take me if ever you had the
  chance."</p>

  <p>"Take <i>you</i>!&mdash;it was Dick Turpin I betted to take."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> am DICK TURPIN&mdash;that's my alias!" replied Jack.</p>

  <p>"Dick Turpin! then I'll have a snap at you at all hazards," cried Coates,
  springing suddenly towards him.</p>

  <p>"And I at you," said Turpin, discharging his pistol right in the face of
  the rash attorney; "there's a quittance in full."</p><a id="ch3-1"

  <p class="first">ON quitting Lady Rookwood's chamber, Luke speeded along the
  gloomy corridor, descended the spiral stairs, and, swiftly traversing sundry
  other dark passages, issued from a door at the back of the house. Day was
  just beginning to break. His first object had been to furnish himself with
  means to expedite his flight; and, perceiving no one in the yard, he directed
  his hasty steps towards the stable. The door was fortunately unfastened; and,
  entering, he found a strong roan horse, which he knew, from description, had
  been his father's favorite hunter, and to the use of which he now considered
  himself fully entitled. The animal roused himself as he approached, shook his
  glossy coat, and neighed, as if he recognized the footsteps and voice.</p>

  <p>"Thou art mistaken, old fellow," said Luke; "I am not he thou thinkest;
  nevertheless, I am glad thy instinct would have it so. If thou bearest my
  father's son as thou hast borne thy old master, o'er many a field for many a
  day, he need not fear the best mounted of his pursuers. Soho! come hither,
  Rook."</p>

  <p>The noble steed turned at the call. Luke hastily saddled him, vaulted upon
  his back, and, disregarding every impediment in the shape of fence or ditch,
  shaped his course across the field towards the sexton's cottage, which he
  reached just as its owner was in the act of unlocking his door. Peter
  testified his delight and surprise at the escape of his grandson, by a
  greeting of chuckling laughter.</p>

  <p>"How?&mdash;escaped!" exclaimed he. "Who has delivered you from the hands
  of the Moabites? Ha, ha! But why do I ask? Who could it have been but Jack
  Palmer?"</p>

  <p>"My own hands have set me free," returned Luke. "I am indebted to no man
  for liberty; still less to <i>him</i>. But I cannot tarry here; each moment
  is precious. I came to request you to accompany me to the gipsy encampment.
  Will you go, or not?"</p>

  <p>"And mount behind you?" replied Peter; "I like not the manner of
  conveyance."</p>

  <p>"Farewell, then." And Luke turned to depart.</p>

  <p>"Stay; that is Sir Piers's horse, old Rook. I care not if I do ride
  him."</p>

  <p>"Quick, then; mount."</p>

  <p>"I will not delay you a moment," rejoined the sexton, opening his door,
  and throwing his implements into the cottage. "Back, Mole; back, sir," cried
  he, as the dog rushed out to greet him. "Bring your steed nigh this stone,
  grandson Luke&mdash;there&mdash;a little nearer&mdash;all's right." And away
  they galloped.</p>

  <p>The sexton's first inquiries were directed to ascertain how Luke had
  accomplished his escape; and, having satisfied himself in this particular, he
  was content to remain silent; musing, it might be, on the incidents detailed
  to him.</p>

  <p>The road Luke chose was a rough, unfrequented lane, that skirted, for
  nearly a mile, the moss-grown palings of the park. It then diverged to the
  right, and seemed to bear towards a range of hills rising in the distance.
  High hedges impeded the view on either hand; but there were occasional gaps,
  affording glimpses of the tract of country through which he was riding.
  Meadows were seen steaming with heavy dews, intersected by a deep channelled
  stream, whose course was marked by a hanging cloud of vapor, as well as by a
  row of melancholy pollard-willows, that stood like stripped, shivering
  urchins by the river side. Other fields succeeded, yellow with golden grain,
  or bright with flowering clover&mdash;the autumnal crop&mdash;colored with
  every shade, from the light green of the turnip to the darker verdure of the
  bean, the various products of the teeming land. The whole was backed by round
  drowsy masses of trees.</p>

  <p>Luke spoke not, nor abated his furious course, till the road began to
  climb a steep ascent. He then drew in the rein, and from the heights of the
  acclivity surveyed the plain over which he had passed.</p>

  <p>It was a rich agricultural district, with little picturesque beauty, but
  much of true English endearing loveliness to recommend it. Such a quiet,
  pleasing landscape, in short, as one views, at such a season of the year,
  from every eminence in every county of our merry isle. The picture was made
  up of a tract of land filled with corn ripe for the sickle, or studded with
  sheaves of the same golden produce, enlivened with green meadows, so deeply
  luxuriant as to claim the scythe for the second time; each divided from the
  other by thick hedgerows, the uniformity of which was broken ever and anon by
  some towering elm, tall poplar, or wide-branching oak. Many old farmhouses,
  with their broad barns and crowded haystacks&mdash;forming little villages in
  themselves&mdash;ornamented the landscape at different points, and by their
  substantial look evidenced the fertility of the soil, and the thriving
  condition of its inhabitants. Some three miles distant might be seen the
  scattered hamlet of Rookwood; the dark russet thatch of its houses scarcely
  perceptible amidst the embrowned foliage of the surrounding timber. The site
  of the village was, however, pointed out by the square tower of the antique
  church, that crested the summit of the adjoining hill; and although the hall
  was entirely hidden from view, Luke readily traced out its locality amidst
  the depths of the dark grove in which it was embosomed.</p>

  <p>This goodly prospect had other claims to attention in Luke's eyes besides
  its agricultural or pictorial merit. It was, or he deemed it was, his own.
  Far as his eye ranged, yea, even beyond the line of vision, the estates of
  Rookwood extended.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that house below us in the valley?" asked Peter of his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Luke; "a snug old house&mdash;a model of a farm.
  Everything looks comfortable and well to do about it. There are a dozen lusty
  haystacks, or thereabouts; and the great barn, with its roof yellowed like
  gold, looks built for a granary; and there are stables, kine-houses,
  orchards, dovecots, and fishponds, and an old circular garden, with
  wall-fruit in abundance. He should be a happy man, and a wealthy one, who
  dwells therein."</p>

  <p>"He dwells therein no longer," returned Peter; "he died last night."</p>

  <p>"How know you that? None are stirring in the house as yet."</p>

  <p>"The owner of that house, Simon Toft," replied Peter, "was last night
  struck by a thunderbolt. He was one of the coffin-bearers at your father's
  funeral. They are sleeping within the house, you say. 'Tis well. Let them
  sleep on&mdash;they will awaken too soon, wake when they may&mdash;ha,
  ha!"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" cried Luke; "you blight everything&mdash;even this smiling
  landscape you would turn to gloom. Does not this morn awaken a happier train
  of thoughts within your mind? With me it makes amends for want of sleep,
  effaces resentment, and banishes every black misgiving. 'Tis a joyous thing
  thus to scour the country at earliest dawn; to catch all the spirit and
  freshness of the morning; to be abroad before the lazy world is half awake;
  to make the most of a brief existence; and to have spent a day of keen
  enjoyment, almost before the day begins with some. I like to anticipate the
  rising of the glorious luminary; to watch every line of light changing, as at
  this moment, from shuddering gray to blushing rose! See how the heavens are
  dyed! Who would exchange yon gorgeous spectacle," continued he, pointing
  towards the east, and again urging his horse to full speed down the hill,
  endangering the sexton's seat, and threatening to impale him upon the crupper
  of the saddle&mdash;"who would exchange that sight, and the exhilarating
  feeling of this fresh morn, for a couch of eiderdown, and a headache in
  reversion?"</p>

  <p>"I for one," returned the sexton, sharply, "would willingly exchange it
  for that, or any other couch, provided it rid me of this accursed crupper,
  which galls me sorely. Moderate your pace, grandson Luke, or I must throw
  myself off the horse in self-defence."</p>

  <p>Luke slackened his charger's pace, in compliance with the sexton's
  wish.</p>

  <p>"Ah! well," continued Peter, restored in a measure to comfort; "now I can
  contemplate the sunrise, which you laud, somewhat at mine ease. 'Tis a fine
  sight, I doubt not, to the eyes of youth; and, to the sanguine soul of him
  upon whom life itself is dawning, is, I dare say, inspiriting: but when the
  heyday of existence is past; when the blood flows sluggishly in the veins;
  when one has known the desolating storms which the brightest sunrise has
  preceded, the seared heart refuses to trust its false glitter; and, like the
  experienced sailor, sees oft in the brightest skies a forecast of the
  tempest. To such a one, there can be no new dawn of the heart; no sun can
  gild its cold and cheerless horizon; no breeze can revive pulses that have
  long since ceased to throb with any chance emotion. I am too old to feel
  freshness in this nipping air. It chills me more than the damps of night, to
  which I am accustomed. Night&mdash;midnight! is my season of delight. Nature
  is instinct then with secrets dark and dread. There is a language which he
  who sleepeth not, but will wake, and watch, may haply learn. Strange organs
  of speech hath the invisible world; strange language doth it talk; strange
  communion hold with him who would pry into its mysteries. It talks by bat and
  owl&mdash;by the grave-worm, and by each crawling thing&mdash;by the dust of
  graves, as well as by those that rot therein&mdash;but ever doth it discourse
  by night, and specially when the moon is at the full. 'Tis the lore I have
  then learned that makes that season dear to me. Like your cat, mine eye
  expands in darkness. I blink at the sunshine, like your owl."</p>

  <p>"Cease this forbidding strain," returned Luke; "it sounds as harshly as
  your own screech-owl's cry. Let your thoughts take a more sprightly turn,
  more in unison with my own and the fair aspect of nature."</p>

  <p>"Shall I direct them to the gipsies' camp, then?" said Peter, with a
  sneer. "Do your own thoughts tend thither?"</p>

  <p>"You are not altogether in the wrong," replied Luke. "I <i>was</i>thinking
  of the gipsies' camp, and of one who dwells amongst its tents."</p>

  <p>"I knew it," replied Peter. "Did you hope to deceive me by attributing all
  your joyousness of heart to the dawn? Your thoughts have been wandering all
  this while upon one who hath, I will engage, a pair of sloe-black eyes, an
  olive skin, and yet withal a clear one&mdash;'black, yet comely, as the tents
  of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon'&mdash;a mesh of jetty hair, that hath
  entangled you in its network&mdash;ripe lips, and a cunning tongue&mdash;one
  of the plagues of Egypt.&mdash;Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed shrewdly," replied Luke; "I care not to own that my
  thoughts were so occupied."</p>

  <p>"I was assured of it," replied the sexton. "And what may be the name of
  her towards whom your imagination was straying?"</p>

  <p>"Sibila Perez," replied Luke. "Her father was a Spanish Gitano. She is
  known amongst her people by her mother's name of Lovel."</p>

  <p>"She is beautiful, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, very beautiful!&mdash;but no matter! You shall judge of her charms
  anon."</p>

  <p>"I will take your word for them," returned the sexton; "and you love
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Passionately."</p>

  <p>"You are not married?" asked Peter, hastily.</p>

  <p>"Not as yet," replied Luke; "but my faith is plighted."</p>

  <p>"Heaven be praised! The mischief is not then irreparable. I would have you
  married&mdash;though not to a gipsy girl."</p>

  <p>"And whom would you select?"</p>

  <p>"One before whom Sybil's beauty would pale as stars at day's
  approach."</p>

  <p>"There lives not such a one."</p>

  <p>"Trust me there does. Eleanor Mowbray is lovely beyond parallel. I was
  merely speculating upon a possibility when I wished her yours&mdash;it is
  scarcely likely she would cast her eyes upon you."</p>

  <p>"I shall not heed her neglect. Graced with my title, I doubt not, were it
  my pleasure to seek a bride amongst those of gentle blood, I should not find
  all indifferent to my suit."</p>

  <p>"Possibly not. Yet what might weigh with others, would not weigh with her.
  There are qualities you lack which she has discovered in another."</p>

  <p>"In whom?"</p>

  <p>"In Ranulph Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"Is <i>he</i> her suitor?"</p>

  <p>"I have reason to think so."</p>

  <p>"And you would have me abandon my own betrothed love, to beguile from my
  brother his destined bride? That were to imitate the conduct of my grandsire,
  the terrible Sir Reginald, towards <i>his</i> brother Alan."</p>

  <p>The sexton answered not, and Luke fancied he could perceive a quivering in
  the hands that grasped his body for support. There was a brief pause in their
  conversation.</p>

  <p>"And who is Eleanor Mowbray?" asked Luke, breaking the silence.</p>

  <p>"Your cousin. On the mother's side a Rookwood. 'Tis therefore I would urge
  your union with her. There is a prophecy relating to your house, which seems
  as though it would be fulfilled in your person and in hers:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">When the stray Rook shall perch on the topmost bough,<br>
  There shall be clamor and screaming, I trow;<br>
  But of right, and of rule, of the ancient nest,<br>
  The Rook that with Rook mates shall hold him possest."</p><br>

  <p>"I place no faith in such fantasies," replied Luke; "and yet the lines
  bear strangely upon my present situation."</p>

  <p>"Their application to yourself and Eleanor Mowbray is unquestionable,"
  replied the sexton.</p>

  <p>"It would seem so, indeed," rejoined Luke; and he again sank into
  abstraction, from which the sexton did not care to arouse him.</p>

  <p>The aspect of the country had materially changed since their descent of
  the hill. In place of the richly-cultivated district which lay on the other
  side, a broad brown tract of waste land spread out before them, covered with
  scattered patches of gorse, stunted fern, and low brushwood, presenting an
  unvaried surface of unbaked turf. The shallow coat of sod was manifested by
  the stones that clattered under the horse's hoofs as he rapidly traversed the
  arid soil, clearing with ease to himself, though not without discomfort to
  the sexton, every gravelly trench, natural chasm, or other inequality of
  ground that occurred in his course. Clinging to his grandson with the
  tenacity of a bird of prey, Peter for some time kept his station in security;
  but, unluckily, at one dike rather wider than the rest, the horse, owing
  possibly to the mismanagement, intentional or otherwise, of Luke, swerved;
  and the sexton, dislodged from his "high estate," fell at the edge of the
  trench, and rolled incontinently to the bottom.</p>

  <p>Luke drew in the rein to inquire if any bones were broken; and Peter
  presently upreared his dusty person from the abyss, and without condescending
  to make any reply, yet muttering curses, "not loud, but deep," accepted his
  grandson's proffered hand, and remounted.</p>

  <p>While thus occupied, Luke fancied he heard a distant shout, and noting
  whence the sound proceeded&mdash;the same quarter by which he had approached
  the heath&mdash;he beheld a single horseman spurring in their direction at
  the top of his speed; and to judge from the rate at which he advanced, it was
  evident he was anything but indifferently mounted. Apprehensive of pursuit,
  Luke expedited the sexton's ascent; and that accomplished, without bestowing
  further regard upon the object of his solicitude, he resumed his headlong
  flight. He now thought it necessary to bestow more attention on his choice of
  road, and, perfectly acquainted with the heath, avoided all unnecessary
  hazardous passes. In spite of his knowledge of the ground, and the excellence
  of his horse, the stranger sensibly gained upon him. The danger, however, was
  no longer imminent.</p>

  <p>"We are safe," cried Luke; "the limits of Hardchase are past. In a few
  seconds we shall enter Davenham Wood. I will turn the horse loose, and we
  will betake ourselves to flight amongst the trees. I will show you a place of
  concealment. He cannot follow us on horseback, and on foot I defy him."</p>

  <p>"Stay," cried the sexton. "He is not in pursuit&mdash;he takes another
  course&mdash;he wheels to the right. By Heaven! it is the Fiend himself upon
  a black horse, come for Bow-legged Ben. See, he is there already."</p>

  <p>The horseman had turned, as the sexton stated, careering towards a
  revolting object at some little distance on the right hand. It was a gibbet,
  with its grisly burden. He rode swiftly towards it, and, reining in his
  horse, took off his hat, bowing profoundly to the carcase that swung in the
  morning breeze. Just at that moment a gust of air catching the fleshless
  skeleton, its arms seemed to be waved in reply to the salutation. A solitary
  crow winged its flight over the horseman's head as he paused. After a
  moment's halt, he wheeled about, and again shouted to Luke, waving his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"As I live," said the latter, "it is Jack Palmer."</p>

  <p>"Dick Turpin, you mean," rejoined the sexton. "He has been paying his
  respects to a brother blade. Ha, ha! Dick will never have the honor of a
  gibbet; he is too tender of the knife. Did you mark the crow? But here he
  comes." And in another instant Turpin was by their side.</p>

     Task</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">"THE top of the morning to you, gem'men," said Turpin, as he
  rode up at an easy canter. "Did you not hear my halloo? I caught a glimpse of
  you on the hill yonder. I knew you both, two miles off; and so, having a word
  or two to say to you, Luke Bradley, before I leave this part of the country,
  I put Bess to it, and she soon brought me within hail. Bless her black skin,"
  added he, affectionately patting his horse's neck, "there's not her match in
  these parts, or in any other; she wants no coaxing to do her work&mdash;no
  bleeders for her. I should have been up with you before this had I not taken
  a cross cut to look at poor Ben.</p><br>

  <p class="poem">One night, when mounted on my mare.<br>
  To Bagshot Heath I did repair,<br>
  And saw Will Davies hanging there,<br>
  Upon the gibbet bleak and bare,<br>
  <i>With a rustified, fustified, mustified air.</i></p><br>

  <p>Excuse my singing. The sight of a gibbet always puts me in mind of the
  Golden Farmer. May I ask whither you are bound, comrades?"</p>

  <p>"Comrades!" whispered the sexton to Luke; "you see <i>he</i> does not so
  easily forget his old friends."</p>

  <p>"I have business that will not admit of delay," rejoined Luke; "and to
  speak plainly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You want not my society," returned Turpin; "I guessed as much. Natural
  enough! You have got an inkling of your good fortune. You have found out you
  are a rich man's heir, not a poor wench's bastard. No offence; I'm a plain
  spoken man, as you will find, if you know it not already. I have no objection
  to your playing these fine tricks on others, though it won't answer your turn
  to do so with me."</p>

  <p>"Sir!" exclaimed Luke, sharply.</p>

  <p>"Sir to you," replied Turpin&mdash;"Sir Luke&mdash;as I suppose you would
  now choose to be addressed. I am aware of all. A nod is as good as a wink to
  me. Last night I learned the fact of Sir Piers's marriage from Lady
  Rookwood&mdash;ay, from her ladyship. You stare&mdash;and old Peter, there,
  opens his ogles now. She let it out by accident; and I am in possession of
  what can alone substantiate your father's first marriage, and establish your
  claims to the property."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" cried the sexton; adding, in a whisper to Luke, "You had
  better not be precipitate in dropping so obliging an acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"You are jesting," said Luke to Turpin.</p>

  <p>"It is ill jesting before breakfast," returned Dick: "I am seldom in the
  mood for a joke so early. What if a certain marriage certificate had fallen
  into my hand?"</p>

  <p>"A marriage certificate!" echoed Luke and the sexton simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"The only existing proof of the union of Sir Piers Rookwood with Susan
  Bradley," continued Turpin. "What if I had stumbled upon such a
  document&mdash;nay more, if I knew where to direct you to it?"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" cried Luke to his tormentor; and then addressing Turpin, "if what
  you say be true, my quest is at an end. All that I need, you appear to
  possess. Other proofs are secondary to this. I know with whom I have to deal.
  What do you demand for that certificate?"</p>

  <p>"We will talk about the matter after breakfast," said Turpin. "I wish to
  treat with you as friend with friend. Meet me on those terms, and I am your
  man; reject my offer, and I turn my mare's head, and ride back to Rookwood.
  With me now rest all your hopes. I have dealt fairly with you, and I expect
  to be fairly dealt with in return. It were idle to say, now I have an
  opportunity, that I should not turn this luck to my account. I were a fool to
  do otherwise. You cannot expect it. And then I have Rust and Wilder to settle
  with. Though I have left them behind, they know my destination. We have been
  old associates. I like your spirit&mdash;I care not for your haughtiness; but
  I will not help you up the ladder to be kicked down myself. Now you
  understand me. Whither are you bound?"</p>

  <p>"To Davenham Priory, the gipsy camp."</p>

  <p>"The gipsies are your friends?"</p>

  <p>"They are."</p>

  <p>"I am alone."</p>

  <p>"You are safe."</p>

  <p>"You pledge your word that all shall be on the square. You will not
  mention to one of that canting crew what I have told you?"</p>

  <p>"With one exception, you may rely upon my secrecy."</p>

  <p>"Whom do you except?"</p>

  <p>"A woman."</p>

  <p>"Bad! never trust a petticoat."</p>

  <p>"I will answer for her with my life."</p>

  <p>"And for your granddad there?"</p>

  <p>"He will answer for himself," said Peter. "You need not fear treachery in
  me. Honor among thieves, you know."</p>

  <p>"Or where else should you seek it?" rejoined Turpin; "for it has left all
  other classes of society. Your highwayman is your only man of honor. I will
  trust you both; and you shall find you may trust me. After breakfast, as I
  said before, we will bring the matter to a conclusion. Tip us your daddle,
  Sir Luke, and I am satisfied. You shall rule in Rookwood, I'll engage, ere a
  week be flown; and then&mdash;&mdash; But so much parleying is dull work;
  let's make the best of our way to breakfast."</p>

  <p>And away they cantered.</p>

  <p>A narrow bridle-road conducted them singly through the defiles of a thick
  wood. Their route lay in the shade, and the air felt chilly amidst the trees,
  the sun not having attained sufficient altitude to penetrate its depths,
  while overhead all was warmth and light. Quivering on the tops of the timber,
  the horizontal sunbeams created, in their refraction, brilliant prismatic
  colorings, and filled the air with motes like golden dust. Our horsemen
  heeded not the sunshine or the shade. Occupied each with his own train of
  thought, they silently rode on.</p>

  <p>Davenham Wood, through which they urged their course, had, in the olden
  time, been a forest of some extent. It was then an appendage to the domains
  of Rookwood, but had passed from the hands of that family to those of a
  wealthy adjoining landowner and lawyer, Sir Edward Davenham, in the keeping
  of whose descendants it had ever after continued. A noble wood it was, and
  numbered many patriarchal trees. Ancient oaks, with broad, gnarled limbs,
  which the storms of five hundred years had vainly striven to uproot, and
  which were now sternly decaying; gigantic beech trees, with silvery stems
  shooting smoothly upwards, sustaining branches of such size, that each,
  dissevered, would in itself have formed a tree, populous with leaves, and
  variegated with rich autumnal tints; the sprightly sycamore, the dark
  chestnut, the weird wych-elm, the majestic elm itself, festooned with ivy,
  every variety of wood, dark, dense, and intricate, composed the forest
  through which they rode; and so multitudinous was the timber, so closely
  planted, so entirely filled up with a thick, matted vegetation, which had
  been allowed to collect beneath, that little view was afforded, had any been
  desired by the parties, into the labyrinth of the grove. Tree after tree,
  clad in the glowing livery of the season, was passed, and as rapidly
  succeeded by others. Occasionally a bough projected over their path,
  compelling the riders to incline their heads as they passed; but, heedless of
  such difficulties, they pressed on. Now the road grew lighter, and they
  became at once sensible of the genial influence of the sun. The transition
  was as agreeable as instantaneous. They had opened upon an extensive
  plantation of full-grown pines, whose tall, branchless stems grew up like a
  forest of masts, and freely admitted the pleasant sunshine. Beneath those
  trees, the soil was sandy and destitute of all undergrowth, though covered
  with brown, hair-like fibres and dry cones, shed by the pines. The agile
  squirrel, that freest denizen of the grove, starting from the ground as the
  horsemen galloped on, sprang up the nearest tree, and might be seen angrily
  gazing at the disturbers of his haunts, beating the branches with his fore
  feet, in expression of displeasure; the rabbit darted across their path; the
  jays flew screaming amongst the foliage; the blue cushat, scared at the
  clatter of the horses' hoofs, sped on swift wing into quarters secure from
  their approach; while the parti-colored pies, like curious village gossips,
  congregated to peer at the strangers, expressing their astonishment by loud
  and continuous chattering. Though so gentle of ascent as to be almost
  imperceptible, it was still evident that the path they were pursuing
  gradually mounted a hill-side; and when at length they reached an opening,
  the view disclosed the eminence they had insensibly won. Pausing for a moment
  upon the brow of the hill, Luke pointed to a stream that wound through the
  valley, and, tracing its course, indicated a particular spot amongst the
  trees. There was no appearance of a dwelling house&mdash;no cottage roof, no
  white canvas shed, to point out the tents of the wandering tribe whose abode
  they were seeking. The only circumstance betokening that it had once been the
  haunt of man were a few gray monastic ruins, scarce distinguishable from the
  stony barrier by which they were surrounded; and the sole evidence that it
  was still frequented by human beings was a thin column of pale blue smoke,
  that arose in curling wreaths from out the brake, the light-colored vapor
  beautifully contrasting with the green umbrage whence it issued.</p>

  <p>"Our destination is yonder," exclaimed Luke, pointing in the direction of
  the vapor.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it," cried Turpin, "as well as to perceive there is
  some one awake. That smoke holds out a prospect of breakfast. No smoke
  without fire, as old Lady Scanmag said; and I'll wager a trifle that fire was
  not lighted for the fayter fellows to count their fingers by. We shall find
  three sticks, and a black pot with a kid seething in it, I'll engage. These
  gipsies have picked out a prettyish spot to quarter in&mdash;quite
  picturesque, as one may say&mdash;and but for that tell-tale smoke, which
  looks for all the world like a Dutch skipper blowing his morning cloud, no
  one need know of their vicinity. A pretty place, upon my soul."</p>

  <p>The spot, in sooth, merited Turpin's eulogium. It was a little valley, in
  the midst of wooded hills, so secluded, that not a single habitation appeared
  in view. Clothed with timber to the very summits, excepting on the side where
  the party stood, which verged upon the declivity, these mountainous ridges
  presented a broken outline of foliage, variegated with tinted masses of
  bright orange, timber, and deepest green. Four hills hemmed in the valley.
  Here and there a gray slab of rock might be discerned amongst the wood, and a
  mountain-ash figured conspicuously upon a jutting crag immediately below
  them. Deep sunken in the ravine, and concealed in part from view by the wild
  herbage and dwarf shrubs, ran a range of precipitous rocks, severed, it would
  seem, by some diluvial convulsion, from the opposite mountain side, as a
  corresponding rift was there visible, in which the same dip of strata might
  be observed, together with certain ribbed cavities, matching huge bolts of
  rock which had once locked these stony walls together. Washing this cliff,
  swept a clear stream, well known and well regarded, as it waxed in width, by
  the honest brethren of the angle, who seldom, however, tracked it to its rise
  amongst these hills. The stream found its way into the valley through a chasm
  far to the left, and rushed thundering down the mountain side in a boiling
  cascade. The valley was approached in this direction from Rookwood by an
  unfrequented carriage-road, which Luke had, from prudential reasons, avoided.
  All seemed consecrated to silence&mdash;to solitude&mdash;to the hush of
  nature; yet this quiet scene was the chosen retreat of lawless depredators,
  and had erstwhile been the theatre of feudal oppression. We have said that no
  habitation was visible; that no dwelling tenanted by man could be seen; but
  following the spur of the furthest mountain hill, some traces of a stone wall
  might be discovered; and upon a natural platform of rock stood a stern square
  tower, which had once been the donjon of the castle, the lords of which had
  called the four hills their own. A watch-tower then had crowned each
  eminence, every vestige of which had, however, long since disappeared.
  Sequestered in the vale stood the Priory before alluded to&mdash;a Monastery
  of Gray Friars, of the Order of St. Francis&mdash;some of the venerable walls
  of which were still remaining; and if they had not reverted to the bat and
  the owl, as is wont to be the fate of such sacred structures, their
  cloistered shrines were devoted to beings whose natures partook, in some
  measure, of the instincts of those creatures of the night&mdash;a people
  whose deeds were of darkness, and whose eyes shunned the light. Here the
  gipsies had pitched their tent; and though the place was often, in part,
  deserted by the vagrant horde, yet certain of the tribe, who had grown into
  years&mdash;over whom Barbara Lovel held queenly sway&mdash;made it their
  haunt, and were suffered by the authorities of the neighborhood to remain
  unmolested&mdash;a lenient piece of policy, which, in our infinite regard for
  the weal of the tawny tribe, we recommend to the adoption of all other
  justices and knights of the shire.</p>

  <p>Bidding his grandsire have regard to his seat, Luke leaped a high bank;
  and, followed by Turpin, began to descend the hill. Peter, however, took care
  to provide for himself. The descent was so perilous, and the footing so
  insecure, that he chose rather to trust to such conveyance as nature had
  furnished him with, than to hazard his neck by any false step of the horse.
  He contrived, therefore, to slide off from behind, shaping his own course in
  a more secure direction.</p>

  <p>He who has wandered amidst the Alps must have often had occasion to
  witness the wonderful surefootedness of that mountain pilot, the mule. He
  must have remarked how, with tenacious hoof, he will claw the rock, and drag
  himself from one impending fragment to another, with perfect security to his
  rider; how he will breast the roaring currents of air, and stand unshrinking
  at the verge of almost unfathomable ravines. But it is not so with the horse:
  fleet on the plain, careful over rugged ground, he is timid and uncertain on
  the hill-side, and the risk incurred by Luke and Turpin, in their descent of
  the almost perpendicular sides of the cliff, was tremendous. Peter watched
  them in their descent with some admiration, and with much contempt.</p>

  <p>"He will break his neck, of a surety," said he; "but what matters it? As
  well now as hereafter."</p>

  <p>So saying, he approached the verge of the precipice, where he could see
  them more distinctly.</p>

  <p>The passage along which Luke rode had never before been traversed by
  horse's hoof. Cut in the rock, it presented a steep zigzag path amongst the
  cliffs, without any defence for the foot traveller, except such as was
  afforded by a casual clinging shrub, and no protection whatever existed for a
  horseman; the possibility of any one attempting the passage not having, in
  all probability, entered into the calculation of those who framed it. Added
  to this, the steps were of such unequal heights, and withal so narrow, that
  the danger was proportionately increased.</p>

  <p>"Ten thousand devils!" cried Turpin, staring downwards, "is this the best
  road you have got?"</p>

  <p>"You will find one more easy," replied Luke, "if you ride for a quarter of
  a mile down the wood, and then return by the brook side. You will meet me at
  the priory."</p>

  <p>"No," answered the highwayman, boldly; "if you go, I go too. It shall
  never be said that Dick Turpin was afraid to follow where another would lead.
  Proceed."</p>

  <p>Luke gave his horse the bridle, and the animal slowly and steadily
  commenced the descent, fixing his fore legs upon the steps, and drawing his
  hinder limbs carefully after him. Here it was that the lightness and
  steadiness of Turpin's mare was completely shown. No Alpine mule could have
  borne its rider with more apparent ease and safety. Turpin encouraged her by
  hand and word; but she needed it not. The sexton saw them, and, tracking
  their giddy descent, he became more interested than he anticipated. His
  attention was suddenly drawn towards Luke.</p>

  <p>"He is gone," cried Peter. "He falls&mdash;he sinks&mdash;my plans are all
  defeated&mdash;the last link is snapped. No," added he, recovering his wonted
  composure, "his end is not so fated."</p>

  <p>Rook had missed his footing. He rolled stumbling down the precipice a few
  yards. Luke's fate seemed inevitable. His feet were entangled in the stirrup,
  he could not free himself. A birch tree, growing in a chink of the precipice,
  arrested his further fall. But for this timely aid all had been over. Here
  Luke was enabled to extricate himself from the stirrup and to regain his
  feet; seizing the bridle, he dragged his faulty steed back again to the
  road.</p>

  <p>"You have had a narrow escape, by Jove," said Turpin, who had been
  thunderstruck with the whole proceeding. "Those big cattle are always clumsy;
  devilish lucky it's no worse."</p>

  <p>It was now comparatively smooth travelling; but they had not as yet
  reached the valley, and it seemed to be Luke's object to take a circuitous
  path. This was so evident that Turpin could not help commenting upon it.</p>

  <p>Luke evaded the question. "The crag is steep there," said he; "besides, to
  tell you the truth, I want to surprise them."</p>

  <p>"Ho, ho!" laughed Dick. "Surprise them, eh? What a pity the birch tree was
  in the way; you would have done it properly then. Egad, here's another
  surprise."</p>

  <p>Dick's last exclamation was caused by his having suddenly come upon a wide
  gully in the rock, through which dashed a headlong torrent, crossed by a
  single plank.</p>

  <p>"You must be mad to have taken this road," cried Turpin, gazing down into
  the roaring depths in which the waterfall raged, and measuring the distance
  of the pass with his eye. "So, so, Bess!&mdash;Ay, look at it, wench. Curse
  me, Luke, if I think your horse will do it, and, therefore, turn him
  loose."</p>

  <p>But Dick might as well have bidden the cataract to flow backwards. Luke
  struck his heels into his horse's sides. The steed galloped to the brink,
  snorted, and refused the leap.</p>

  <p>"I told you so&mdash;he can't do it," said Turpin. "Well, if you are
  obstinate, a wilful man must have his way. Stand aside, while I try it for
  you." Patting Bess, he put her to a gallop. She cleared the gulf bravely,
  landing her rider safely upon the opposite rock.</p>

  <p>"Now then," cried Turpin, from the other side of the chasm.</p>

  <p>Luke again urged his steed. Encouraged by what he had seen, this time the
  horse sprang across without hesitation. The next instant they were in the
  valley.</p>

  <p>For some time they rode along the banks of the stream in silence. A sound
  at length caught the quick ears of the highwayman.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" cried he; "some one sings. Do you hear it?"</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Luke, the blood rushing to his cheeks.</p>

  <p>"And could give a guess at the singer, no doubt," said Turpin, with a
  knowing look. "Was it to hear yon woodlark that you nearly broke your own
  neck, and put mine in jeopardy?"</p>

  <p>"Prithee be silent," whispered Luke.</p>

  <p>"I am dumb," replied Turpin; "I like a sweet voice as well as
  another."</p>

  <p>Clear as the note of a bird, yet melancholy as the distant dole of a
  vesper-bell, arose the sound of that sweet voice from the wood. A fragment of
  a Spanish gipsy song it warbled: Luke knew it well. Thus ran the romance:</p>

  <h3>LA GITANILLA</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:42%">By the Guadalquivir,<br>
  Ere the sun be flown,<br>
  By that glorious river<br>
  Sits a maid alone.<br>
  Like the sunset splendor<br>
  Of that current bright,<br>
  Shone her dark eyes tender<br>
  As its witching light.<br>
  Like the ripple flowing,<br>
  Tinged with purple sheen,<br>
  Darkly, richly glowing,<br>
  Is her warm cheek seen.<br>
  'Tis the Gitanilla<br>
  By the stream doth linger,<br>
  In the hope that eve<br>
  Will her lover bring her.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:42%">See, the sun is sinking;<br>
  All grows dim, and dies;<br>
  See, the waves are drinking<br>
  Glories of the skies.<br>
  Day's last lustre playeth<br>
  On that current dark;<br>
  Yet no speck betrayeth<br>
  His long looked-for bark.<br>
  'Tis the hour of meeting!<br>
  Nay, the hour is past;<br>
  Swift the time is fleeting!<br>
  Fleeteth hope as fast.<br>
  Still the Gitanilla<br>
  By the stream doth linger,<br>
  In the hope that night<br>
  Will her lover bring her.</p><br>

  <p>The tender trembling of a guitar was heard in accompaniment of the
  ravishing melodist.</p>

  <p>The song ceased.</p>

  <p>"Where is the bird?" asked Turpin.</p>

  <p>"Move on in silence, and you shall see," said Luke; and keeping upon the
  turf, so that his horse's tread became inaudible, he presently arrived at a
  spot where, through the boughs, the object of his investigation could plainly
  be distinguished, though he himself was concealed from view.</p>

  <p>Upon a platform of rock, rising to the height of the trees, nearly
  perpendicularly from the river's bed, appeared the figure of the gipsy maid.
  Her footstep rested on the extreme edge of the abrupt cliff, at whose base
  the water boiled in a deep whirlpool, and the bounding chamois could not have
  been more lightly poised. One small hand rested upon her guitar, the other
  pressed her brow. Braided hair, of the jettiest dye and sleekest texture, was
  twined around her brow in endless twisted folds:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">Rowled it was in many a curious fret,<br>
  Much like a rich and curious coronet,<br>
  Upon whose arches twenty Cupids lay,<br>
  And were as tied, or loth to fly away.[24]</p><br>

  <p>And so exuberant was this rarest feminine ornament, that, after
  encompassing her brow, it was passed behind, and hung down in long thick
  plaits almost to her feet. Sparkling, as the sunbeams that played upon her
  dark yet radiant features, were the large, black, Oriental eyes of the
  maiden, and shaded with lashes long and silken. Hers was a Moorish
  countenance, in which the magnificence of the eyes eclipses the face, be it
  ever so beautiful&mdash;an effect to be observed in the angelic pictures of
  Murillo,&mdash;and the lovely contour is scarcely noticed in the gaze which
  those long, languid, luminous orbs attract. Sybil's features were exquisite,
  yet you looked only at her eyes&mdash;they were the loadstars of her
  countenance. Her costume was singular, and partook, like herself, of other
  climes. Like the Andalusian dame, her choice of color inclined towards black,
  as the material of most of her dress was of that sombre hue. A bodice of
  embroidered velvet restrained her delicate bosom's swell; a rich girdle, from
  which depended a silver chain, sustaining a short poniard, bound her waist;
  around her slender throat was twined a costly kerchief; and the rest of her
  dress was calculated to display her slight, yet faultless, figure to the
  fullest advantage.</p>

  <p>Unconscious that she was the object of regard, she raised her guitar, and
  essayed to touch the chords. She struck a few notes, and resumed her
  romance:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:42%">Swift that stream flows on,<br>
  Swift the night is wearing,&mdash;<br>
  Yet she is not gone,<br>
  Though with heart despairing.</p><br>

  <p>Her song died away. Her hand was needed to brush off the tears that were
  gathering in her large dark eyes. At once her attitude was changed. The hare
  could not have started more suddenly from her form. She heard accents well
  known concluding the melody:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:42%">Dips an oar-plash&mdash;hark!&mdash;<br>
  Gently on the river;<br>
  'Tis her lover's bark.<br>
  On the Guadalquivir.<br>
  Hark! a song she hears!<br>
  Every note she snatches;<br>
  As the singer nears,<br>
  Her own name she catches.<br>
  Now the Gitanilla<br>
  Stays not by the water,<br>
  For the midnight hour<br>
  Hath her lover brought her.</p><br>

  <p>It was her lover's voice. She caught the sound at once, and, starting, as
  the roe would arouse herself at the hunter's approach, bounded down the crag,
  and ere he had finished the refrain, was by his side.</p>

  <p>Flinging the bridle to Turpin, Luke sprang to her, and caught her in his
  arms. Disengaging herself from his ardent embrace, Sybil drew back, abashed
  at the sight of the highwayman.</p>

  <p>"Heed him not," said Luke; "it is a friend."</p>

  <p>"He is welcome here then," replied Sybil. "But where have you tarried so
  long, dear Luke?" continued she, as they walked to a little distance from the
  highwayman. "What hath detained you? The hours have passed wearily since you
  departed. You bring good news?"</p>

  <p>"Good news, my girl; so good, that I falter even in the telling of it. You
  shall know all anon. And see, our friend yonder grows impatient. Are there
  any stirring? We must bestow a meal upon him, and that forthwith: he is one
  of those who brook not much delay."</p>

  <p>"I came not to spoil a love meeting," said Turpin, who had good-humoredly
  witnessed the scene; "but, in sober seriousness, if there is a stray capon to
  be met with in the land of Egypt, I shall be glad to make his acquaintance.
  Methinks I scent a stew afar off."</p>

  <p>"Follow me," said Sybil; "your wants shall be supplied."</p>

  <p>"Stay," said Luke; "there is one other of our party whose coming we must
  abide."</p>

  <p>"He is here," said Sybil, observing the sexton at a distance. "Who is that
  old man?"</p>

  <p>"My grandsire, Peter Bradley."</p>

  <p>"Is that Peter Bradley?" asked Sybil.</p>

  <p>"Ay, you may well ask whether that old dried-up <i>otomy</i>, who ought to
  grin in a glass case for folks to stare at, be kith and kin of such a bang-up
  cove as your fancy man, Luke," said Turpin, laughing&mdash;"but i' faith he
  is."</p>

  <p>"Though he is your grandsire, Luke," said Sybil, "I like him not. His
  glance resembles that of the Evil Eye."</p>

  <p>And, in fact, the look which Peter fixed upon her was such as the
  rattlesnake casts upon its victim, and Sybil felt like a poor fluttering bird
  under the fascination of that venomous reptile. She could not remove her eyes
  from his, though she trembled as she gazed. We have said that Peter's orbs
  were like those of the toad. Age had not dimmed their brilliancy. In his
  harsh features you could only read bitter scorn or withering hate; but in his
  eyes resided a magnetic influence of attraction or repulsion. Sybil underwent
  the former feeling in a disagreeable degree. She was drawn to him as by the
  motion of a whirlpool, and involuntarily clung to her lover.</p>

  <p>"It is the Evil Eye, dear Luke."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut, dear Sybil; I tell you it is my grandsire."</p>

  <p>"The girl says rightly, however," rejoined Turpin; "Peter has a confounded
  ugly look about the ogles, and stares enough to put a modest wench out of
  countenance. Come, come, my old earthworm, crawl along, we have waited for
  you long enough. Is this the first time you have seen a pretty lass, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It is the first time I have seen one so beautiful," said Peter; "and I
  crave her pardon if my freedom has offended her. I wonder not at your
  enchantment, grandson Luke, now I behold the object of it. But there is one
  piece of counsel I would give to this fair maid. The next time she trusts you
  from her sight, I would advise her to await you at the hill-top, otherwise
  the chances are shrewdly against your reaching the ground with neck
  unbroken."</p>

  <p>There was something, notwithstanding the satirical manner in which Peter
  delivered this speech, calculated to make a more favorable impression upon
  Sybil than his previous conduct had inspired her with; and, having
  ascertained from Luke to what his speech referred, she extended her hand to
  him, yet not without a shudder, as it was enclosed in his skinny grasp. It
  was like the fingers of Venus in the grasp of a skeleton.</p>

  <p>"This is a little hand," said Peter, "and I have some skill myself in
  palmistry. Shall I peruse its lines?"</p>

  <p>"Not now, in the devil's name!" said Turpin, stamping impatiently. "We
  shall have Old Ruffin himself amongst us presently, if Peter Bradley grows
  gallant."</p>

  <p>Leading their horses, the party took their way through the trees. A few
  minutes' walking brought them in sight of the gipsy encampment, the spot
  selected for which might be termed the Eden of the valley. It was a small
  green plain, smooth as a well-shorn lawn, kept ever verdant&mdash;save in the
  spots where the frequent fires had scorched its surface&mdash;by the flowing
  stream that rushed past it, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of wooded
  hills. Here might be seen the canvas tent with its patches of varied
  coloring; the rude-fashioned hut of primitive construction; the kettle
  slung</p>

  <p class="cp"><small>Between two poles, upon a stick transverse;</small></p>

  <p class="first">the tethered beasts of burden, the horses, asses, dogs,
  carts, caravans, wains, blocks, and other movables and immovables belonging
  to the wandering tribe. Glimmering through the trees, at the extremity of the
  plain, appeared the ivy-mantled walls of Davenham Priory. Though much had
  gone to decay, enough remained to recall the pristine state of this once
  majestic pile, and the long, though broken line of Saxon arches, that still
  marked the cloister wall; the piers that yet supported the dormitory; the
  enormous horse-shoe arch that spanned the court; and, above all, the great
  marigold, or circular window, which terminated the chapel, and which, though
  now despoiled of its painted honors, retained, like the skeleton leaf, its
  fibrous intricacies entire,&mdash;all eloquently spoke of the glories of the
  past, while they awakened reverence and admiration for the still enduring
  beauty of the present.</p>

  <p>Towards these ruins Sybil conducted the party.</p>

  <p>"Do you dwell therein?" asked Peter, pointing towards the priory.</p>

  <p>"That is my dwelling," said Sybil.</p>

  <p>"It is one I should covet more than a modern mansion," returned the
  sexton.</p>

  <p>"I love those old walls better than any house that was ever fashioned,"
  replied Sybil.</p>

  <p>As they entered the Prior's Close, as it was called, several swarthy
  figures made their appearance from the tents. Many a greeting was bestowed
  upon Luke, in the wild jargon of the tribe. At length an uncouth dwarfish
  figure, with a shock head of black hair, hopped towards them. He seemed to
  acknowledge Luke as his master.</p>

  <p>"What ho! Grasshopper," said Luke, "take these horses, and see that they
  lack neither dressing nor provender."</p>

  <p>"And hark ye, Grasshopper," added Turpin; "I give you a special charge
  about this mare. Neither dress nor feed her till I see both done myself. Just
  walk her for ten minutes, and if you have a glass of ale in the place, let
  her sip it."</p>

  <p>"Your bidding shall be done," chirped the human insect, as he fluttered
  away with his charges.</p>

  <p>A motley assemblage of tawny-skinned varlets, dark-eyed women and
  children, whose dusky limbs betrayed their lineage, in strange costume, and
  of wild deportment, checked the path, muttering welcome upon welcome into the
  ear of Luke as he passed. As it was evident he was in no mood for converse,
  Sybil, who seemed to exercise considerable authority over the crew, with a
  word dispersed them, and they herded back to their respective
  habitations.</p>

  <p>A low door admitted Luke and his companions into what had once been the
  garden, in which some old moss-encrusted apple and walnut-trees were still
  standing, bearing a look of antiquity almost as venerable as that of the
  adjoining fabric.</p>

  <p>Another open door gave them entrance to a spacious chamber, formerly the
  eating-room or refectory of the holy brotherhood, and a goodly room it had
  been, though now its slender lanceolated windows were stuffed with hay to
  keep out the air. Large holes told where huge oaken rafters had once crossed
  the roof, and a yawning aperture marked the place where a cheering fire had
  formerly blazed. As regarded this latter spot, the good old custom was not,
  even now, totally abrogated. An iron plate, covered with crackling wood,
  sustained a ponderous black caldron, the rich steam from which gratefully
  affected the olfactory organs of the highwayman.</p>

  <p>"That augurs well," said he, rubbing his hands.</p>

  <p>"Still hungering after the fleshpots of Egypt," said the sexton, with a
  ghastly smile.</p>

  <p>"We will see what that kettle contains," said Luke.</p>

  <p>"Handassah&mdash;Grace!" exclaimed Sybil, calling.</p>

  <p>Her summons was answered by two maidens, habited not unbecomingly, in
  gipsy gear.</p>

  <p>"Bring the best our larder can furnish," said Sybil, "and use despatch.
  You have appetites to provide for, sharpened by a long ride in the open
  air."</p>

  <p>"And by a night's fasting," said Luke, "and solitary confinement to
  boot."</p>

  <p>"And a night of business," added Turpin&mdash;"and plaguy perplexing
  business into the bargain."</p>

  <p>"And the night of a funeral too," doled Peter; "and that funeral a
  father's. Let us have breakfast speedily, by all means. We have rare
  appetites."</p>

  <p>An old oaken table&mdash;it might have been the self-same upon which the
  holy friars had broken their morning fast&mdash;stood in the middle of the
  room. The ample board soon groaned beneath the weight of the savory caldron,
  the unctuous contents of which proved to be a couple of dismembered
  pheasants, an equal proportion of poultry, great gouts of ham, mushrooms,
  onions, and other piquant condiments, so satisfactory to Dick Turpin, that,
  upon tasting a mouthful, he absolutely shed tears of delight. The dish was
  indeed the triumph of gipsy cookery; and so sedulously did Dick apply himself
  to his mess, and so complete was his abstraction, that he perceived not he
  was left alone. It was only when about to wash down the last drumstick of the
  last fowl with a can of excellent ale that he made this discovery.</p>

  <p>"What! all gone? And Peter Bradley, too? What the devil does this mean?"
  mused he. "I must not muddle my brain with any more Pharaoh, though I have
  feasted like a king of Egypt. That will never do. Caution, Dick, caution.
  Suppose I shift yon brick from the wall, and place this precious document
  beneath it. Pshaw! Luke would never play me false. And now for Bess! Bless
  her black skin! she'll wonder where I've been so long. It's not my way to
  leave her to shift for herself, though she can do that on a pinch."</p>

  <p>Soliloquizing thus, he arose and walked towards the door.</p>

</div>
<br>



  <p class="first">BENEATH a moldering wall, whither they had strayed, to be
  free from interruption, and upon a carpet of the greenest moss, sat Sybil and
  her lover.</p>

  <p>With eager curiosity she listened to his tale. He recounted all that had
  befallen him since his departure. He told her of the awful revelations of the
  tomb; of the ring that, like a talisman, had conjured up a thousand brilliant
  prospects; of his subsequent perils; his escapes; his rencontre with Lady
  Rookwood; his visit to his father's body; and his meeting with his brother.
  All this she heard with a cheek now flushed with expectation, now made pale
  with apprehension; with palpitating bosom, and suppressed breath. But when
  taking a softer tone, love, affection, happiness inspired the theme, and Luke
  sought to paint the bliss that should be theirs in his new estate; when he
  would throw his fortune into her lap, his titles at her feet, and bid her
  wear them with him; when, with ennobled hand and unchanged heart, he would
  fulfil the troth plighted in his outcast days; in lieu of tender, grateful
  acquiescence, the features of Sybil became overcast, the soft smile faded
  away, and, as spring sunshine is succeeded by the sudden shower, the light
  that dwelt in her sunny orbs grew dim with tears.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why is this, dear Sybil?" said Luke, gazing upon her in
  astonishment, not unmingled with displeasure. "To what am I to attribute
  these tears? You do not, surely, regret my good fortune?"</p>

  <p>"Not on your own account, dear Luke," returned she, sadly. "The tears I
  shed were for myself&mdash;the first, the only tears that I have ever shed
  for such cause; and," added she, raising her head like a flower surcharged
  with moisture, "they shall be the last."</p>

  <p>"This is inexplicable, dear Sybil. Why should you lament for yourself, if
  not for me? Does not the sunshine of prosperity that now shines upon me gild
  you with the same beam? Did I not even now affirm that the day that saw me
  enter the hall of my forefathers should dawn upon our espousals?"</p>

  <p>"True; but the sun that shines upon you, to me wears a threatening aspect.
  The day of those espousals will never dawn. You cannot make me the Lady of
  Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"What do I hear?" exclaimed Luke, surprised at this avowal of his
  mistress, sadly and deliberately delivered. "Not wed you! And wherefore not?
  Is it the rank I have acquired, or hope to acquire, that displeases you?
  Speak, that I may waste no further time in thus pursuing the shadows of
  happiness, while the reality fleets from me."</p>

  <p>"And <i>are</i> they shadows; and <i>is</i> this the reality, dear Luke?
  Question your secret soul, and you will find it otherwise. You could not
  forego your triumph; it is not likely. You have dwelt too much upon the proud
  title which will be yours to yield it to another, when it may be won so
  easily. And, above all, when your mother's reputation, and your own stained
  name, may be cleared by one word, breathed aloud, would you fail to utter it?
  No, dear Luke, I read your heart; you would not."</p>

  <p>"And if I could <i>not</i> forego this, wherefore is it that you refuse to
  be a sharer in my triumph? Why will you render my honors valueless when I
  have acquired them? You love me not."</p>

  <p>"Not love you, Luke?"</p>

  <p>"Approve it, then."</p>

  <p>"I do approve it. Bear witness the sacrifice I am about to make of all my
  hopes, at the shrine of my idolatry to you. Bear witness the agony of this
  hour. Bear witness the horror of the avowal, that I never can be yours. As
  Luke Bradley, I would joyfully&mdash;oh, how joyfully!&mdash;have been your
  bride. As Sir Luke Rookwood"&mdash;and she shuddered as she pronounced the
  name&mdash;"I never can be so."</p>

  <p>"Then, by Heaven! Luke Bradley will I remain. But
  wherefore&mdash;wherefore not as Sir Luke Rookwood?"</p>

  <p>"Because," replied Sybil, with reluctance&mdash;"because I am no longer
  your equal. The gipsy's low-born daughter is no mate for Sir Luke Rookwood.
  Love cannot blind me, dear Luke. It cannot make me other than I am; it cannot
  exalt me in my own esteem, nor in that of the world, with which you, alas!
  too soon will mingle, and which will regard even me as&mdash;no matter
  what!&mdash;it shall not scorn me as your bride. I will not bring shame and
  reproach upon you. Oh! if for me, dear Luke, the proud ones of the earth were
  to treat you with contumely, this heart would break with agony. For myself, I
  have pride sufficient&mdash;perchance too much. Perchance 'tis pride that
  actuates me now. I know not. But for you I am all weakness. As you were
  heretofore, I would have been to you the tenderest and truest wife that ever
  breathed; as you are now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hear me, Sybil."</p>

  <p>"Hear <i>me</i> out, dear Luke. One other motive there is that determines
  my present conduct, which, were all else surmounted, would in itself suffice.
  Ask me not what that is. I cannot explain it. For your own sake; I implore
  you, be satisfied with my refusal."</p>

  <p>"What a destiny is mine!" exclaimed Luke, striking his forehead with his
  clenched hand. "No choice is left me. Either way I destroy my own happiness.
  On the one hand stands love&mdash;on the other, ambition; yet neither will
  conjoin."</p>

  <p>"Pursue, then, ambition," said Sybil, energetically, "if you <i>can</i>
  hesitate. Forget that I have ever existed; forget you have ever loved; forget
  that such a passion dwells within the human heart, and you may still be
  happy, though you are great."</p>

  <p>"And do you deem," replied Luke, with frantic impatience, "that I
  <i>can</i> accomplish this; that I <i>can</i> forget that I have loved you;
  that I <i>can</i> forget you? Cost what it will, the effort shall be made.
  Yet by our former love, I charge you tell me what has wrought this change in
  you! Why do you <i>now</i> refuse me?"</p>

  <p>"I have said you are Sir Luke Rookwood," returned Sybil, with painful
  emotion. "Does that name import nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Imports it aught of ill?"</p>

  <p>"To me, everything of ill. It is a fated house. Its line are all
  predestined."</p>

  <p>"To what?" demanded Luke.</p>

  <p>"To <i>murder</i>!" replied Sybil, with solemn emphasis. "To the murder of
  their wives. Forgive me, Luke, if I have dared to utter this. Yourself
  compelled me to it."</p>

  <p>Amazement, horror, wrath, kept Luke silent for a few moments. Starting to
  his feet, he cried:</p>

  <p>"And can you suspect me of a crime so foul? Think you, because I shall
  assume the name, that I shall put on the nature likewise of my race? Do you
  believe me capable of aught so horrible?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I believe it not. I am sure you would not do it. Your soul would
  reject with horror such a deed. But if Fate should guide your hand, if the
  avenging spirit of your murdered ancestress should point to the steel, you
  could not shun it then."</p>

  <p>"In Heaven's name! to what do you allude?"</p>

  <p>"To a tradition of your house," replied Sybil. "Listen to me, and you
  shall hear the legend." And with a pathos that produced a thrilling effect
  upon Luke, she sang the following ballad:</p>

  <h3>THE LEGEND OF THE LADY OF ROOKWOOD</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:27%">Grim Ranulph home hath at midnight come, from the
     long wars of the Roses,<br>
  And the squire, who waits at his ancient gates, a secret dark discloses;<br>

     style="margin-left:27%">To his lady's bower, at that lonesome hour,

  sweet.</p>

  <p>"And this is the legend of my ancestress?" said Luke, as Sybil's strains
  were ended.</p>

  <p>"It is," replied she.</p>

  <p>"An idle tale," observed Luke, moodily.</p>

  <p>"Not so," answered Sybil. "Has not the curse of blood clung to all your
  line? Has it not attached to your father&mdash;to Sir Reginald&mdash;Sir
  Ralph&mdash;Sir Ranulph&mdash;to all? Which of them has escaped it? And when
  I tell you this, dear Luke; when I find you bear the name of this accursed
  race, can you wonder if I shudder at adding to the list of the victims of
  that ruthless spirit, and that I tremble for you? I would die <i>for</i> you
  willingly&mdash;but not by your hand. I would not that my blood, which I
  would now pour out for you as freely as water, should rise up in judgment
  against you. For myself I have no tears&mdash;for <i>you</i>, a thousand. My
  mother, upon her death-bed, told me I should never be yours. I believed her
  not, for I was happy then. She said that we never should be united; or, if
  united&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"What, in Heaven's name?"</p>

  <p>"That you would be my destroyer. How could I credit her words then? How
  can I doubt them now, when I find you are a Rookwood? And think not, dear
  Luke, that I am ruled by selfish fears in this resolution. To renounce you
  may cost me my life; but the deed will be my own. You may call me
  superstitious, credulous: I have been nurtured in credulity. It is the faith
  of my fathers. There are those, methinks, who have an insight into futurity;
  and such boding words have been spoken, that, be they true or false, I will
  not risk their fulfilment in my person. I may be credulous; I may be weak; I
  may be erring; but I am steadfast in this. Bid me perish at your feet, and I
  will do it. I will not be your Fate. I will not be the wretched instrument of
  your perdition. I will love, worship, watch, serve, perish for you&mdash;but
  I'll not wed you."</p>

  <p>Exhausted by the vehemence of her emotion, she would have sunk upon the
  ground, had not Luke caught her in his arms. Pressing her to his bosom, he
  renewed his passionate protestations. Every argument was unavailing. Sybil
  appeared inflexible.</p>

  <p>"You love me as you have ever loved me?" said she, at length.</p>

  <p>"A thousand-fold more fervently," replied Luke; "put it to the test."</p>

  <p>"How if I dare to do so? Consider well: I may ask too much."</p>

  <p>"Name it. If it be not to surrender you, by my mother's body I will obey
  you."</p>

  <p>"I would propose an oath."</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"A solemn, binding oath, that; if you wed me not, you will not wed
  another. Ha! do you start? Have I appalled you?"</p>

  <p>"I start? I will take it. Hear me&mdash;by&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed a voice behind them. "Do not forswear yourself." And
  immediately afterwards the sexton made his appearance. There was a malignant
  smile upon his countenance. The lovers started at the ominous
  interruption.</p>

  <p>"Begone!" cried Luke.</p>

  <p>"Take not that oath," said Peter, "and I leave you. Remember the counsel I
  gave you on our way hither."</p>

  <p>"What counsel did he give you, Luke?" inquired Sybil, eagerly, of her
  lover.</p>

  <p>"We spoke of you, fond girl," replied Peter. "I cautioned him against the
  match. I knew not your sentiments, or I had spared myself the trouble. You
  have judged wisely. Were he to wed you, ill would come of it. But he
  <i>must</i> wed another."</p>

  <p>"MUST!" cried Sybil, her eyes absolutely emitting sparkles of indignation
  from their night-like depths; and, unsheathing as she spoke the short poniard
  which she wore at her girdle, she rushed towards Peter, raising her hand to
  strike.</p>

  <p>"<i>Must</i> wed another! And dare you counsel this?"</p>

  <p>"Put up your dagger, fair maiden," said Peter, calmly. "Had I been
  younger, your eyes might have had more terrors for me than your weapon; as it
  is, I am proof against both. You would not strike an old man like myself, and
  of your lover's kin?"</p>

  <p>Sybil's uplifted hand fell to her side.</p>

  <p>"'Tis true," continued the sexton, "I dared to give him this advice; and
  when you have heard me out, you will not, I am persuaded, think me so
  unreasonable as, at first, I may appear to be. I have been an unseen listener
  to your converse; not that I desire to pry into your secrets&mdash;far from
  it; I overheard you by accident. I applaud your resolution; but if you are
  inclined to sacrifice all for your lover's weal, do not let the work be
  incomplete. Bind him not by oaths which he will regard as spiders' webs, to
  be burst through at pleasure. You see, as well as I do, that he is bent on
  being lord of Rookwood; and, in truth, to an aspiring mind, such a desire is
  natural, is praiseworthy. It will be pleasant, as well as honorable, to
  efface the stain cast upon his birth. It will be an act of filial duty in him
  to restore his mother's good name; and I, her father, laud his anxiety on
  that score; though, to speak truth, fair maid, I am not so rigid as your nice
  moralists in my view of human nature, and can allow a latitude to love which
  their nicer scruples will not admit. It will be a proud thing to triumph over
  his implacable foe; and this he may accomplish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Without marriage," interrupted Sybil, angrily.</p>

  <p>"True," returned Peter; "yet not maintain it. May win it, but not wear it.
  You have said truly, the house of Rookwood is a fated house; and it hath been
  said likewise, that if he wed not one of his own kindred&mdash;that if Rook
  mate not with Rook, his possessions shall pass away from his hands. Listen to
  this prophetic quatrain:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">When the stray Rook shall perch on the topmost bough,<br>
  There shall be clamor and screeching, I trow;<br>
  But of right to, and rule of the ancient nest,<br>
  The Rook that with Rook mates shall hold him possest.</p><br>

  <p>"You hear what these quaint rhymes say. Luke is, doubtless, the stray
  rook, and a fledgeling hath flown hither from a distant country. He must take
  her to his mate, or relinquish her and 'the ancient nest' to his brother. For
  my own part, I disregard such sayings. I have little faith in prophecy and
  divination. I know not what Eleanor Mowbray, for so she is called, can have
  to do with the tenure of the estates of Rookwood. But if Luke Rookwood, after
  he has lorded it for awhile in splendor, be cast forth again in rags and
  wretchedness, let him not blame his grandsire for his own want of
  caution."</p>

  <p>"Luke, I implore you, tell me," said Sybil, who had listened,
  horror-stricken, to the sexton, shuddering, as it were, beneath the chilly
  influence of his malevolent glance, "is this true? Does your fate depend upon
  Eleanor Mowbray? Who is she? What has she to do with Rookwood? Have you seen
  her? Do you love her?"</p>

  <p>"I have never seen her," replied Luke.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven for that!" cried Sybil. "Then you love her not?"</p>

  <p>"How were that possible?" returned Luke. "Do I not say I have not seen
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Who is she, then?"</p>

  <p>"This old man tells me she is my cousin. She is betrothed to my brother
  Ranulph."</p>

  <p>"How?" ejaculated Sybil. "And would you snatch his betrothed from your
  brother's arms? Would you do him this grievous wrong? Is it not enough that
  you must wrest from him that which he has long deemed his own? And if he has
  falsely deemed it so, it will not make his loss the less bitter. If you do
  thus wrong your brother, do not look for happiness; do not look for respect;
  for neither will be your portion. Even this stony-hearted old man shrinks
  aghast at such a deed. His snake-like eyes are buried on the ground. See, I
  have moved even <i>him</i>."</p>

  <p>And in truth Peter did appear, for an instant, strangely moved.</p>

  <p>"'Tis nothing," returned he, mastering his emotion by a strong effort.
  "What is all this to me? I never had a brother. I never had aught&mdash;wife,
  child, or relative, that loved me. And I love not the world, nor the things
  of the world, nor those that inhabit the world. But I know what sways the
  world and its inhabitants; and that is, SELF! AND SELF-INTEREST! Let Luke
  reflect on this. The key to Rookwood is Eleanor Mowbray. The hand that grasps
  hers, grasps those lands; thus saith the prophecy."</p>

  <p>"It is a lying prophecy."</p>

  <p>"It was uttered by one of your race."</p>

  <p>"By whom?"</p>

  <p>"By Barbara Lovel," said Peter, with a sneer of triumph.</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Heed him not," exclaimed Luke, as Sybil recoiled at this intelligence. "I
  am yours."</p>

  <p>"Not mine! not mine!" shrieked she; "but, oh! not <i>hers</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Whither go you?" cried Luke, as Sybil, half bewildered, tore herself from
  him.</p>

  <p>"To Barbara Lovel."</p>

  <p>"I will go with you."</p>

  <p>"No! let me go alone. I have much to ask her; yet tarry not with this old
  man, dear Luke, or close your ears to his crafty talk. Avoid him. Oh, I am
  sick at heart. Follow me not; I implore you, follow me not."</p>

  <p>And with distracted air she darted amongst the mouldering cloisters,
  leaving Luke stupefied with anguish and surprise. The sexton maintained a
  stern and stoical composure.</p>

  <p>"She is a woman, after all," muttered he; "all her high-flown resolves
  melt like snow in the sunshine at the thought of a rival. I congratulate you,
  grandson Luke; you are free from your fetters."</p>

  <p>"Free!" echoed Luke. "Quit my sight; I loathe to look upon you. You have
  broken the truest heart that ever beat in woman's bosom."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," returned Peter; "it is not broken yet. Wait till we hear what
  old Barbara has got to say; and, meanwhile, we must arrange with Dick Turpin
  the price of that certificate. The knave knows its value well. Come, be a
  man. This is worse than womanish."</p>

  <p>And at length he succeeded, half by force and half by persuasion, in
  dragging Luke away with him.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-4"
     name="ch3-4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; BARBARA LOVEL</h2>

  <p class="quote">Los Gitanos son encantadores, adivinos, magos,
  chyromanticos, que dicen por las rayas de las manos lo Futuro, que ellos
  llaman Buenaventura, y generalmente son dados a toda supersticion.<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Doctor Sancho de Moncada.</span> <i>Discurso sobre
  Espulsion de los Gitanos.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">LIKE a dove escaped from the talons of the falcon, Sybil
  fled from the clutches of the sexton. Her brain was in a whirl, her blood on
  fire. She had no distinct perception of external objects; no definite notion
  of what she herself was about to do, and glided more like a flitting spirit
  than a living woman along the ruined ambulatory. Her hair had fallen in
  disorder over her face. She stayed not to adjust it, but tossed aside the
  blinding locks with frantic impatience. She felt as one may feel who tries to
  strain his nerves, shattered by illness, to the endurance of some dreadful,
  yet necessary pain.</p>

  <p>Sybil loved her granddame, old Barbara; but it was with a love tempered by
  fear. Barbara was not a person to inspire esteem or to claim affection. She
  was regarded by the wild tribe which she ruled as their queen-elect, with
  some such feeling of inexplicable awe as is entertained by the African slave
  for the Obeah woman. They acknowledged her power, unhesitatingly obeyed her
  commands, and shrank with terror from her anathema, which was indeed seldom
  pronounced; but when uttered, was considered as doom. Her tribe she looked
  upon as her flock, and stretched her maternal hand over all, ready alike to
  cherish or chastise; and having already survived a generation, that which
  succeeded, having from infancy imbibed a superstitious veneration for the
  "cunning woman," as she was called, the sentiment could never be wholly
  effaced. Winding her way, she knew not how, through roofless halls, over
  disjointed fragments of fallen pillars, Sybil reached a flight of steps. A
  door, studded with iron nails, stayed her progress; it was an old, strong
  oaken frame, surmounted by a Gothic arch, in the keystone of which leered one
  of those grotesque demoniacal faces with which the fathers of the church
  delighted to adorn their shrines. Sybil looked up&mdash;her glance
  encountered the fantastical visage. It recalled the features of the sexton,
  and seemed to mock her&mdash;to revile her. Her fortitude at once deserted
  her. Her fingers were upon the handle of the door. She hesitated: she even
  drew back, with the intention of departing, for she felt then that she dared
  not face Barbara. It was too late&mdash;she had moved the handle. A deep
  voice from within called to her by name. She dared not disobey that
  call&mdash;she entered.</p>

  <p>The room in which Sybil found herself was the only entire apartment now
  existing in the priory. It had survived the ravages of time; it had escaped
  the devastation of man, whose ravages outstrip those of time. Octagonal,
  lofty, yet narrow, you saw at once that it formed the interior of a turret.
  It was lighted by a small oriel window, commanding a lovely view of the
  scenery around, and paneled with oak, richly wrought in ribs and groins; and
  from overhead depended a molded ceiling of honeycomb plaster-work. This room
  had something, even now, in the days of its desecration, of monastic beauty
  about it. Where the odor of sanctity had breathed forth, the fumes of
  idolatry prevailed; but imagination, ever on the wing, flew back to that
  period&mdash;and a tradition to that effect warranted the
  supposition&mdash;when, perchance, it had been the sanctuary and the privacy
  of the prior's self.</p>

  <p>Wrapped in a cloak composed of the skins of various animals, upon a low
  pallet, covered with stained scarlet cloth, sat Barbara. Around her head was
  coiffed, in folds like those of an Asiatic turban, a rich, though faded
  shawl, and her waist was encircled with the magic zodiacal zone&mdash;proper
  to the sorceress&mdash;the <i>Mago Cineo</i> of the Cingara&mdash;whence the
  name Zingaro, according to Moncada&mdash;which Barbara had brought from
  Spain. From her ears depended long golden drops, of curious antique
  fashioning; and upon her withered fingers, which looked like a coil of
  lizards, were hooped a multitude of silver rings, of the purest and simplest
  manufacture. They seemed almost of massive unwrought metal. Her skin was
  yellow as the body of a toad; corrugated as its back. She might have been
  steeped in saffron from her finger tips, the nails of which were of the same
  hue, to such portions of her neck as were visible, and which was puckered up
  like the throat of a turtle. To look at her, one might have thought the
  embalmer had experimented her art upon herself. So dead, so bloodless, so
  blackened seemed the flesh, where flesh remained, leather could scarce be
  tougher than her skin. She seemed like an animated mummy. A frame so tanned,
  appeared calculated to endure for ages; and, perhaps, might have done so.
  But, alas! the soul cannot be embalmed. No oil can re-illumine that precious
  lamp! And that Barbara's vital spark was fast waning, was evident from her
  heavy, blood-shot eyes, once of a swimming black, and lengthy as a witch's,
  which were now sinister and sunken.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the room was as strongly impregnated as a museum with
  volatile odors, emitted from the stores of drugs with which the shelves were
  loaded, as well as from various stuffed specimens of birds and wild animals.
  Barbara's only living companion was a monstrous owl, which, perched over the
  old gipsy's head, hissed a token of recognition as Sybil advanced. From a
  hook, placed in the plaster roof, was suspended a globe of crystal glass,
  about the size and shape of a large gourd, filled with a pure pellucid
  liquid, in which a small snake, the Egyptian aspic, described perpetual
  gyrations.</p>

  <p>Dim were the eyes of Barbara, yet not altogether sightless. The troubled
  demeanor of her grandchild struck her as she entered. She felt the hot drops
  upon her hand as Sybil stooped to kiss it; she heard her vainly-stifled
  sobs.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, child?" said Barbara, in a voice that rattled in her
  throat, and hollow as the articulation of a phantom. "Have you heard tidings
  of Luke Bradley? Has any ill befallen him? I said you would either hear of
  him or see him this morning. He is not returned, I see. What have you
  heard?"</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> returned," replied Sybil, faintly; "and no ill hath happened
  to him."</p>

  <p>"He <i>is</i> returned, and you are here," echoed Barbara. "No ill hath
  happened to <i>him</i>, thou sayest&mdash;am I to understand there
  is&mdash;to <i>you</i>?"</p>

  <p>Sybil answered not. She could not answer.</p>

  <p>"I see, I see," said Barbara, more gently, her head and hand shaking with
  paralytic affection: "a quarrel, a lover's quarrel. Old as I am, I have not
  forgotten my feelings as a girl. What woman ever does, if she be woman? and
  you, like your poor mother, are a true-hearted wench. She loved her husband,
  as a husband should be loved, Sybil; and though she loved me well, she loved
  him better, as was right. Ah! it was a bitter day when she left me for Spain;
  for though, to one of our wandering race, all countries are alike, yet the
  soil of our birth is dear to us, and the presence of our kindred dearer.
  Well, well, I will not think of that. She is gone. Nay, take it not so to
  heart, wench. Luke has a hasty temper. 'Tis not the first time I have told
  you so. He will not bear rebuke, and you have questioned him too shrewdly
  touching his absence. Is it not so? Heed it not. Trust me, you will have him
  seek your forgiveness ere the shadows shorten 'neath the noontide sun."</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" said Sybil, sadly, "this is no lover's quarrel, which may,
  at once, be forgotten and forgiven&mdash;would it were so!"</p>

  <p>"What is it, then?" asked Barbara; and without waiting Sybil's answer, she
  continued, with vehemence, "has he wronged you? Tell me, girl, in what way?
  Speak, that I may avenge you, if your wrong requires revenge. Are you blood
  of mine, and think I will not do this for you, girl? None of the blood of
  Barbara Lovel were ever unrevenged. When Richard Cooper stabbed my
  first-born, Francis, he fled to Flanders to escape my wrath. But he did not
  escape it. I pursued him thither. I hunted him out; drove him back to his own
  country, and brought him to the gallows. It took a power of gold. What
  matter? Revenge is dearer than gold. And as it was with Richard Cooper, so it
  shall be with Luke Bradley. I will catch him, though he run. I will trip him,
  though he leap. I will reach him, though he flee afar. I will drag him hither
  by the hair of his head," added she, with a livid smile, and clutching at the
  air with her hands, as if in the act of pulling some one towards her. "He
  shall wed you within the hour, if you will have it, or if your honor need
  that it should be so. My power is not departed from me. My people are yet at
  my command. I am still their queen, and woe to him that offendeth me!"</p>

  <p>"Mother! mother!" cried Sybil, affrighted at the storm she had unwittingly
  aroused, "he has not injured me. 'Tis I alone who am to blame, not Luke."</p>

  <p>"You speak in mysteries," said Barbara.</p>

  <p>"Sir Piers Rookwood is dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" echoed Barbara, letting fall her hazel rod. "Sir Piers dead!"</p>

  <p>"And Luke Bradley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Is his successor."</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" asked Barbara, with increased astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Luke himself. All is disclosed." And Sybil hastily recounted Luke's
  adventures. "He is now Sir Luke Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"This is news, in truth," said Barbara; "yet not news to weep for. You
  should rejoice, not lament. Well, well, I foresaw it. I shall live to see all
  accomplished; to see my Agatha's child ennobled; to see her wedded; ay, to
  see her well wedded."</p>

  <p>"Dearest mother!"</p>

  <p>"I can endow you, and I will do it. You shall bring your husband not alone
  beauty, you shall bring him wealth."</p>

  <p>"But, mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My Agatha's daughter shall be Lady Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"Never! It cannot be."</p>

  <p>"What cannot be?"</p>

  <p>"The match you now propose."</p>

  <p>"What mean you, silly wench? Ha! I perceive the meaning of those tears.
  The truth flashes upon me. He has discarded you."</p>

  <p>"No, by the Heaven of Heavens, he is still the same&mdash;unaltered in
  affection."</p>

  <p>"If so, your tears are out of place."</p>

  <p>"Mother, it is not fitting that I, a gipsy born, should wed with him."</p>

  <p>"Not fitting! Ha! and you my child! Not fitting! Get up, or I will spurn
  you. Not fitting! This from you to me! I tell you it <i>is</i> fitting; you
  shall have a dower as ample as that of any lady in the land. Not fitting! Do
  you say so, because you think that he derives himself from a proud and
  ancient line&mdash;ancient and proud&mdash;ha, ha! I tell you, girl, that for
  his one ancestor I can number twenty; for the years in which his lineage hath
  flourished, my race can boast centuries, and was a people&mdash;a
  kingdom!&mdash;ere the land in which he dwells was known. What! if, by the
  curse of Heaven, we were driven forth, the curse of hell rests upon his
  house."</p>

  <p>"I know it," said Sybil; "a dreadful curse, which, if I wed him, will
  alight on me."</p>

  <p>"No; not on you; you shall avoid that curse. I know a means to satisfy the
  avenger. Leave that to me."</p>

  <p>"I dare not, as it never can be; yet, tell me&mdash;you saw the body of
  Luke's ill-fated mother. Was she poisoned? Nay, you may speak. Sir Piers's
  death releases you from your oath. How died she?"</p>

  <p>"By strangulation," said the old gipsy, raising her palsied hand to her
  throat.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" cried Sybil, gasping with horror. "Was there a ring upon her finger
  when you embalmed the body?"</p>

  <p>"A ring&mdash;a wedding-ring! The finger was crookened. Listen, girl, I
  could have told Luke the secret of his birth long ago, but the oath imposed
  by Sir Piers sealed fast my lips. His mother was wedded to Sir Piers; his
  mother was murdered by Sir Piers. Luke was entrusted to my care by his
  father. I have brought him up with you. I have affianced you together; and I
  shall live to see you united. He is now Sir Luke. He is your husband."</p>

  <p>"Do not deceive yourself, mother," said Sybil, with a fearful earnestness.
  "He is not yet Sir Luke Rookwood; would he had no claim to be so! The fortune
  that has hitherto been so propitious may yet desert him. Bethink you of a
  prophecy you uttered."</p>

  <p>"A prophecy? Ha!"</p>

  <p>And with slow enunciation Sybil pronounced the mystic words which she had
  heard repeated by the sexton.</p>

  <p>As she spoke, a gloom, like that of a thunder-cloud, began to gather over
  the brow of the old gipsy. The orbs of her sunken eyes expanded, and wrath
  supplied her frame with vigor. She arose.</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" cried Barbara.</p>

  <p>"Luke's grandsire, Peter Bradley."</p>

  <p>"How learnt he it?" said Barbara. "It was to one who hath long been in his
  grave I told it; so long ago, it had passed from my memory. 'Tis strange! old
  Sir Reginald had a brother, I know. But there is no other of the house."</p>

  <p>"There is a cousin, Eleanor Mowbray."</p>

  <p>"Ha! I see; a daughter of that Eleanor Rookwood who fled from her father's
  roof. Fool, fool. Am I caught in my own toils? Those words were words of
  truth and power, and compel the future and 'the will be' as with chains of
  brass. They must be fulfilled, yet not by Ranulph. He shall never wed
  Eleanor."</p>

  <p>"Whom then shall she wed?"</p>

  <p>"His elder brother."</p>

  <p>"Mother!" shrieked Sybil. "Do you say so? Oh! recall your words."</p>

  <p>"I may not; it is spoken. Luke shall wed her."</p>

  <p>"Oh God, support me!" exclaimed Sybil.</p>

  <p>"Silly wench, be firm. It must be as I say. He shall wed her&mdash;yet
  shall he wed her not. The nuptial torch shall be quenched as soon as lighted;
  the curse of the avenger shall fall&mdash;yet not on thee."</p>

  <p>"Mother," said Sybil, "if sin must fall upon some innocent head, let it be
  on mine&mdash;not upon hers. I love him, I would gladly die for him. She is
  young&mdash;unoffending&mdash;perhaps happy. Oh! do not let her perish."</p>

  <p>"Peace, I say!" cried Barbara, "and mark me. This is your birthday.
  Eighteen summers have flown over your young head&mdash;eighty winters have
  sown their snows on mine. <i>You</i> have yet to learn. Years have brought
  wrinkles&mdash;they have brought wisdom likewise. To struggle with Fate, I
  tell you, is to wrestle with Omnipotence. We may foresee, but not avert our
  destiny. What will be, shall be. This is your eighteenth birthday, Sybil: it
  is a day of fate to you; in it occurs your planetary hour&mdash;an hour of
  good or ill, according to your actions. I have cast your horoscope. I have
  watched your natal star; it is under the baleful influence of Scorpion, and
  fiery Saturn sheds his lurid glance upon it. Let me see your hand. The line
  of life is drawn out distinct and clear&mdash;it runs&mdash;ha! what means
  that intersection? Beware&mdash;beware, my Sybil. Act as I tell you, and you
  are safe. I will make another trial, by the crystal bowl. Attend."</p>

  <p>Muttering some strange words, sounding like a spell, Barbara, with the
  bifurcate hazel staff which she used as a divining-rod, described a circle
  upon the floor. Within this circle she drew other lines, from angle to angle,
  forming seven triangles, the bases of which constituted the sides of a
  septilateral figure. This figure she studied intently for a few moments. She
  then raised her wand and touched the owl with it. The bird unfolded its
  wings, and arose in flight; then slowly circled round the pendulous globe.
  Each time it drew nearer, until at length it touched the glassy bowl with its
  flapping pinions.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" ejaculated Barbara. And at another motion from her rod the bird
  stayed its flight and returned to its perch.</p>

  <p>Barbara arose. She struck the globe with her staff. The pure lymph became
  instantly tinged with crimson, as if blood had been commingled with it. The
  little serpent could be seen within, coiled up and knotted, as in the
  struggles of death.</p>

  <p>"Again I say, beware!" ejaculated Barbara, solemnly. "This is ominous of
  ill."</p>

  <p>Sybil had sunk, from faintness, on the pallet. A knock was heard at the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Who is without?" cried Barbara.</p>

  <p>"'Tis I, Balthazar," replied a voice.</p>

  <p>"Thou mayest enter," answered Barbara; and an old man with a long beard,
  white as snow, reaching to his girdle, and a costume which might be said to
  resemble the raiment of a Jewish high priest, made his appearance. This
  venerable personage was no other than the patrico, or hierophant of the
  Canting Crew.</p>

  <p>"I come to tell you that there are strangers&mdash;ladies&mdash;within the
  priory," said the patrico, gravely. "I have searched for you in vain,"
  continued he, addressing Sybil; "the younger of them seems to need your
  assistance."</p>

  <p>"Whence come they?" exclaimed Barbara.</p>

  <p>"They have ridden, I understand, from Rookwood," answered the patrico.
  "They were on their way to Davenham, when they were prevented."</p>

  <p>"From Rookwood?" echoed Sybil. "Their names&mdash;did you hear their
  names?"</p>

  <p>"Mowbray is the name of both; they are a mother and a daughter; the
  younger is called&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Eleanor?" asked Sybil, with an acute foreboding of calamity.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor is the name, assuredly," replied the patrico, somewhat surprised.
  "I heard the elder, whom I guess to be her mother, so address her."</p>

  <p>"Gracious God! She here!" exclaimed Sybil.</p>

  <p>"Here! Eleanor Mowbray here," cried Barbara; "within my power. Not a
  moment is to be lost. Balthazar, hasten round the tents&mdash;not a man must
  leave his place&mdash;above all, Luke Bradley. See that these Mowbrays are
  detained within the abbey. Let the bell be sounded. Quick, quick; leave this
  wench to me; she is not well. I have much to do. Away with thee, man, and let
  me know when thou hast done it." And as Balthazar departed on his mission,
  with a glance of triumph in her eyes, Barbara exclaimed, "Soh, no sooner hath
  the thought possessed me, than the means of accomplishment appear. It shall
  be done at once. I will tie the knot. I will untie, and then retie it. This
  weak wench must be nerved to the task," added she, regarding the senseless
  form of Sybil. "Here is that will stimulate her," opening the cupboard, and
  taking a small phial; "this will fortify her; and this," continued she, with
  a ghastly smile, laying her hand upon another vessel, "this shall remove her
  rival when all is fulfilled; this liquid shall constrain her lover to be her
  titled, landed husband. Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p class="first">IN consequence of some few words which the sexton let fall
  in the presence of the attendants, during breakfast, more perhaps by design
  than accident, it was speedily rumored throughout the camp that the redoubted
  Richard Turpin was for the time its inmate. This intelligence produced some
  such sensation as is experienced by the inhabitants of a petty town on the
  sudden arrival of a prince of the blood, a commander-in-chief, or other
  illustrious and distinguished personage, whose fame has been vaunted abroad
  amongst his fellowmen by Rumor, "and her thousand tongues;" and who, like our
  highwayman, has rendered himself sufficiently notorious to be an object of
  admiration and emulation amongst his contemporaries.</p>

  <p>All started up at the news. The upright man, the chief of the crew, arose
  from his chair, donned his gown of state, a very ancient brocade
  dressing-gown, filched, most probably, from the wardrobe of some strolling
  player, grasped his baton of office, a stout oaken truncheon, and sallied
  forth. The ruffler, who found his representative in a very magnificently
  equipped, and by no means ill-favored knave, whose chin was decorated with a
  beard as lengthy and as black as Sultan Mahmoud's, together with the
  dexterous hooker, issued forth from the hovel which they termed their boozing
  ken, eager to catch a glimpse of the prince of the high-tobygloaks. The
  limping palliard tore the bandages from his mock wounds, shouldered his
  crutch, and trudged hastily after them. The whip-jack unbuckled his strap,
  threw away his timber leg, and "leapt exulting, like the bounding roe." "With
  such a sail in sight," he said, "he must heave to, like the rest." The
  dummerar, whose tongue had been cut out by the Algerines, suddenly found the
  use of it, and made the welkin ring with his shouts. Wonderful were the
  miracles Dick's advent wrought. The lame became suddenly active, the blind
  saw, the dumb spoke; nay, if truth must be told, absolutely gave utterance to
  "most vernacular execrations." Morts, autem morts, walking morts, dells,
  doxies, kinching morts, and their coes, with all the shades and grades of the
  Canting Crew, were assembled. There were, to use the words of
  Brome&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="poem">&mdash;&mdash;Stark, errant, downright beggars. Ay,<br>
  Without equivocation, statute beggars,<br>
  Couchant and passant, guardant, rampant beggars;<br>
  Current and vagrant, stockant, whippant beggars![25]</p><br>

  <p>Each sunburnt varlet started from his shed; each dusky dame, with her
  brown, half-naked urchins, followed at his heels; each "ripe young maiden,
  with the glossy eye," lingered but to sleek her raven tresses, and to arrange
  her straw bonnet, and then overtook the others; each wrinkled beldame hobbled
  as quickly after as her stiffened joints would permit; while the ancient
  patrico, the priest of the crew&mdash;who joined the couples together by the
  hedge-side, "with the nice custom of dead horse between"[26]&mdash;brought up
  the rear; all bent on one grand object, that of having a peep at the
  "foremost man of all this prigging world!"</p>

  <p>Dick Turpin, at the period of which we treat, was in the zenith of his
  reputation. His deeds were full blown; his exploits were in every man's
  mouth; and a heavy price was set upon his head. That he should show himself
  thus openly, where he might be so easily betrayed, excited no little surprise
  among the craftiest of the crew, and augured an excess of temerity on his
  part. Rash daring was the main feature of Turpin's character. Like our great
  Nelson, he knew fear only by name; and when he thus trusted himself in the
  hands of strangers, confident in himself and in his own resources, he felt
  perfectly easy as to the result. He relied also in the continuance of his
  good fortune, which had as yet never deserted him. Possessed of the belief
  that his hour was not yet come, he cared little or nothing for any risk he
  might incur; and though he might, undoubtedly, have some presentiment of the
  probable termination of his career, he never suffered it to militate against
  his present enjoyment, which proved that he was no despicable
  philosopher.</p>

  <p>Turpin was the <i>ultimus Romanorum</i>, the last of a race,
  which&mdash;we were almost about to say we regret&mdash;is now altogether
  extinct. Several successors he had, it is true, but no name worthy to be
  recorded after his own. With him expired the chivalrous spirit which animated
  successively the bosoms of so many knights of the road; with him died away
  that passionate love of enterprise, that high spirit of devotion to the fair
  sex, which was first breathed upon the highway by the gay, gallant Claude
  Du-Val, the Bayard of the road&mdash;<i>Le filou sans peur et sans
  reproche</i>&mdash;but which was extinguished at last by the cord that tied
  the heroic Turpin to the remorseless tree. It were a subject well worthy of
  inquiry, to trace this decline and fall of the empire of the tobymen to its
  remoter causes; to ascertain the why and the wherefore, that with so many
  half-pay captains; so many poor curates; so many lieutenants, of both
  services, without hopes of promotion; so many penny-a-liners, and fashionable
  novelists; so many damned dramatists, and damning critics; so many Edinburgh
  and Quarterly Reviewers; so many detrimental brothers, and younger sons; when
  there are horses to be hired, pistols to be borrowed, purses to be taken, and
  mails are as plentiful as partridges&mdash;it were worth serious
  investigation, we repeat, to ascertain why, with the best material imaginable
  for a new race of highwaymen, we have none, not even an amateur. Why do not
  some of these choice spirits quit the <i>salons</i> of Pall-Mall, and take to
  the road? the air of the heath is more bracing and wholesome, we should
  conceive, than that of any "hell" whatever, and the chances of success
  incomparably greater. We throw out this hint, without a doubt of seeing it
  followed up. Probably the solution of our inquiry may be, that the supply is
  greater than the demand; that, in the present state of things, embryo
  highwaymen may be more abundant than purses; and then, have we not the
  horse-patrol? With such an admirably-organized system of conservation, it is
  vain to anticipate a change. The highwaymen, we fear, like their Irish
  brothers, the Rapparees, went out with the Tories. They were averse to
  reform, and eschewed emancipation.</p>

  <p>Lest any one should think we have overrated the pleasures of the
  highwayman's existence, they shall hear what "the right villainous" Jack
  Hall, a celebrated tobyman of his day, has got to say on the subject. "His
  life&mdash;the highwayman's&mdash;has, generally, the most mirth and the
  least care in it of any man's breathing, and all he deals for is clear
  profit: he has that point of good conscience, that he always sells as he
  buys, a good pennyworth, which is something rare, since he trades with so
  small a stock. The <i>fence</i>[27] and he are like the devil and the doctor,
  they live by one another; and, like traitors, 'tis best to keep each other's
  counsel. He has this point of honesty, that he never robs the house he
  frequents"&mdash;Turpin had the same scruples respecting the Hall of Rookwood
  in Sir Piers's lifetime&mdash;; "and perhaps pays his debts better than some
  others, for he holds it below the dignity of his employment to commit so
  ungenteel a crime as insolvency, and loves to pay nobly. He has another
  quality, not much amiss, that he takes no more than he has occasion
  for"&mdash;Jack, we think, was a little mistaken here&mdash;; "which he
  verifies this way: he craves no more while that lasts. He is a less nuisance
  in a commonwealth than a miser, because the money he engrosses all circulates
  again, which the other hoards as though 'twere only to be found again at the
  day of judgment. He is the tithe-pig of his family, which the gallows,
  instead of the parson, claims as its due. He has reason enough to be bold in
  his undertakings, for, though all the world threaten him, he stands in fear
  of but one man in it, and that's the hangman; and with him, too, he is
  generally in fee: however, I cannot affirm he is so valiant that he dares
  look any man in the face, for in that point he is now and then, a little
  modest. Newgate may be said to be his country-house, where he frequently
  lives so many months in the year; and he is not so much concerned to be
  carried thither for a small matter, if 'twere only for the benefit of
  renewing his acquaintance there. He holds a petit larceny as light as a nun
  does auricular confession, though the priest has a more compassionate
  character than the hangman. Every man in this community is esteemed according
  to his particular quality, of which there are several degrees, though it is
  contrary often to public government; for here a man shall be valued purely
  for his merit, and rise by it too, though it be but to a halter, in which
  there is a great deal of glory in dying like a hero, and making a decent
  figure in the cart to the last two staves of the fifty-first psalm."[28]</p>

  <p>This, we repeat, is the plain statement of a practical man, and again we
  throw out the hint for adoption. All we regret is, that we are now
  degenerated from the grand tobyman to the cracksman and the sneak, about whom
  there are no redeeming features. How much lower the next generation of
  thieves will dive it boots not to conjecture:</p><br>

  <p class="poem">Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit,<br>
  Nos nequiores; mox daturos,<br>
  Progeniem vitiosiorem.</p><br>

  <p>"Cervantes laughed Spain's chivalry away," sang Byron; and if Gay did not
  extinguish the failing flame of our <i>night</i> errantry&mdash;unlike the
  "Robbers" of Schiller, which is said to have inflamed the Saxon youth with an
  irrepressible mania for brigandage&mdash;, the "Beggar's Opera" helped not to
  fan the dying fire. That laugh was fatal, as laughs generally are. Macheath
  gave the highwayman his <i>coup de grâce</i>.</p>

  <p>The last of this race&mdash;for we must persist in maintaining that he
  <i>was</i> the last&mdash;, Turpin, like the setting sun, threw up some
  parting rays of glory, and tinged the far highways with a luster that may yet
  be traced like a cloud of dust raised by his horse's retreating heels.
  Unequalled in the command of his steed, the most singular feat that the whole
  race of the annals of horsemanship has to record, and of which we may have
  more to say hereafter, was achieved by him. So perfect was his jockeyship, so
  clever his management of the animal he mounted, so intimately acquainted was
  he with every cross-road in the neighborhood of the metropolis&mdash;a book
  of which he constructed, and carried constantly about his person&mdash;, as
  well as with many other parts of England, particularly the counties of
  Chester, York, and Lancaster, that he outstripped every pursuer, and baffled
  all attempts at capture. His reckless daring, his restless rapidity&mdash;for
  so suddenly did he change his ground, and renew his attacks in other
  quarters, that he seemed to be endowed with ubiquity,&mdash;his bravery, his
  resolution, and, above all, his generosity, won for him a high reputation
  amongst his compatriots, and even elicited applauses from those upon whom he
  levied his contributions.</p>

  <p>Beyond dispute, he ruled as master of the road. His hands were, as yet,
  unstained with blood; he was ever prompt to check the disposition to outrage,
  and to prevent, as much as lay in his power, the commission of violence by
  his associates. Of late, since he had possessed himself of his favorite mare,
  Black Bess, his robberies had been perpetrated with a suddenness of
  succession, and at distances so apparently impracticable, that the idea of
  all having been executed by one man, was rejected as an impossibility; and
  the only way of reconciling the description of the horse and rider, which
  tallied in each instance, was the supposition that these attacks were
  performed by confederates similarly mounted and similarly accoutred.</p>

  <p>There was, in all this, as much of the "<i>famæ sacra fames</i>" as of the
  "<i>auri</i>;" of the hungering after distinction, as well as of the appetite
  of gain. Enamored of his vocation, Turpin delighted to hear himself
  designated as the Flying Highwayman; and it was with rapturous triumph that
  he found his single-handed feats attributed to a band of marauders. But this
  state of things could not long endure; his secret was blown; the vigilance of
  the police was aroused; he was tracked to his haunts; and, after a number of
  hairbreadth 'scapes, which he only effected by miracle, or by the aid of his
  wonder-working mare, he reluctantly quitted the heathy hills of Bagshot, the
  Pampas plains of Hounslow&mdash;over which like an archetype of the galloping
  Sir Francis Head, he had so often scoured,&mdash;the gorsy commons of
  Highgate, Hampstead, and Finchley, the marshy fields of Battersea, almost all
  of which he had been known to visit in a single night, and leaving these
  beaten tracks to the occupation of younger and less practised hands, he
  bequeathed to them, at the same time, his own reversionary interest in the
  gibbets thereupon erected, and betook himself to the country.</p>

  <p>After a journey of more or less success, our adventurer found himself at
  Rookwood, whither he had been invited after a grand field-day by its
  hospitable and by no means inquisitive owner. Breach of faith and good
  fellowship formed no part of Turpin's character; he had his lights as well as
  his shades; and as long as Sir Piers lived, his purse and coffers would have
  been free from molestation, except, "so far," Dick said, "as a cog or two of
  dice went. My dice, you know, are longs for odd and even, a bale of bar'd
  cinque deuces," a pattern of which he always carried with him; beyond this,
  excepting a take-in at a steeple chase, Rookwood church being the mark, a
  "do" at a leap, or some such trifle, to which the most scrupulous could not
  raise an objection, Dick was all fair and above-board. But when poor Sir
  Piers had "put on his wooden surtout," to use Dick's own expressive metaphor,
  his conscientious scruples evaporated into thin air. Lady Rookwood was
  nothing to him; there was excellent booty to be appropriated&mdash;</p>

  <p class="cp"><small>The wise <i>convey</i> it call</small>.</p>

  <p>He began to look about for hands; and having accidentally encountered his
  old comrades, Rust and Wilder, they were let into the business, which was
  imperfectly accomplished in the manner heretofore described.</p>

  <p>To return from this digression. When Turpin presented himself at the
  threshold of the door, on his way to inquire after his mare, to his
  astonishment he found it closely invested. A cheering shout from the tawny
  throng, succeeded by a general clapping of hands, and attended by a buzzing
  susurration of applause, such as welcomes the entrance of a popular actor
  upon the stage, greeted the appearance of the highwayman. At the first sight
  of the crowd he was a little startled, and involuntarily sought for his
  pistols. But the demonstrations of admiration were too unequivocal to be for
  a moment mistaken; his hand was drawn from his pocket to raise his hat from
  his brow.</p>

  <p>Thunders of applause.</p>

  <p>Turpin's external man, we have before said, was singularly prepossessing.
  It was especially so in the eyes of <i>the</i> sex&mdash;fair we certainly
  cannot say upon the present occasion&mdash;, amongst whom not a single
  dissentient voice was to be heard. All concurred in thinking him a fine
  fellow; could plainly read his high courage in his bearing; his good breeding
  in his débonnaire deportment; and his manly beauty in his extravagant red
  whiskers. Dick saw the effect that he produced. He was at home in a moment.
  Your true highwayman has ever a passion for effect. This does not desert him
  at the gallows; it rises superior to death itself, and has been known to
  influence the manner of his dangling from the gibbet! To hear some one cry,
  "There goes a proper handsome man," saith our previously quoted authority,
  Jack Hall, "somewhat ameliorates the terrible thoughts of the meagre tyrant
  death; and to go in a dirty shirt were enough to save the hangman a labor,
  and make a man die with grief and shame at being in that deplorable
  condition." With a gracious smile of condescension, like a popular
  orator&mdash;with a look of blarney like that of O'Connell, and of assurance
  like that of Hume&mdash;he surveyed the male portion of the spectators,
  tipped a knowing wink at the prettiest brunettes he could select, and finally
  cut a sort of fling with his well-booted legs, that brought down another
  appeal of rapturous applause.</p>

  <p>"A rank scamp!"[29] cried the upright man; and this exclamation, however
  equivocal it may sound, was intended, on his part, to be highly
  complimentary.</p>

  <p>"I believe ye," returned the ruffler, stroking his chin&mdash;"one may see
  that he's no half swell by the care with which he cultivates the best gifts
  of nature, his whiskers. He's a rank nib."[30]</p>

  <p>"Togged out to the ruffian, no doubt," said the palliard, who was
  incomparably the shabbiest rascal in the corps. "Though a needy mizzler
  mysel, I likes to see a cove vot's vel dressed. Jist twig his swell kickseys
  and pipes;[31] if they ain't the thing, I'm done. Lame Harry can't dance
  better nor he&mdash;no, nor Jerry Juniper neither."</p>

  <p>"I'm dumb founded," roared the dummerar, "if he can't patter romany[32] as
  vel as the best on us! He looks like a rum 'un."</p>

  <p>"And a rum 'un he be, take my word for it," returned the whip-jack, or
  sham sailor. "Look at his rigging&mdash;see how he flashes his
  sticks[33]&mdash;those are the tools to rake a three-decker. He's as clever a
  craft as I've seen this many a day, or I'm no judge."</p>

  <p>The women were equally enchanted&mdash;equally eloquent in the expression
  of their admiration.</p>

  <p>"What ogles!" cried a mort.</p>

  <p>"What pins!" said an autem mort, or married woman.</p>

  <p>"Sharp as needles," said a dark-eyed dell, who had encountered one of the
  free and frolicsome glances which our highwayman distributed so liberally
  among the petticoats.</p>

  <p>It was at this crisis Dick took off his hat. Cæsar betrayed his
  baldness.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pities!" cried the men, compassionating his thinly covered
  skull, and twisting their own ringlets, glossy and luxuriant, though
  unconscious of Macassar. "A thousand pities that so fine a fellow should have
  a sconce like a cocoanut!"</p>

  <p>"But then his red whiskers," rejoined the women, tired of the uniformity
  of thick black heads of hair; "what a warmth of coloring they impart to his
  face; and then only look how beautifully bushy they make his cheeks
  appear!"</p>

  <p>La Fosseuse and the court of the Queen of Navarre were not more smitten
  with the Sieur de Croix's jolly pair of whiskers.</p>

  <p>The hawk's eye of Turpin ranged over the whole assemblage. Amidst that
  throng of dark faces there was not one familiar to him.</p>

  <p>Before him stood the upright man, Zoroaster&mdash;so was he called&mdash;,
  a sturdy, stalwart rogue, whose superior strength and stature&mdash;as has
  not unfrequently been the case in the infancy of governments that have risen
  to more importance than is likely to be the case with that of Lesser
  Egypt&mdash;had been the means of his elevation to his present dignified
  position. Zoroaster literally <i>fought</i> his way upwards, and had at first
  to maintain his situation by the strong arm; but he now was enabled to repose
  upon his hard-won laurels, to smoke "the calumet of peace," and quaff his
  tipple with impunity. For one of gipsy blood, he presented an unusually
  jovial, liquor-loving countenance: his eye was mirthful; his lip moist, as if
  from oft potations; his cheek mellow as an Orleans plum, which fruit, in
  color and texture, it mightily resembled. Strange to say, also, for one of
  that lithe race, his person was heavy and hebetudinous; the consequence, no
  doubt, of habitual intemperance. Like Cribb, he waxed obese upon the
  championship. There was a kind of mock state in his carriage, as he placed
  himself before Turpin, and with his left hand twisted up the tail of his
  dressing-gown, while the right thrust his truncheon into his hip, which was
  infinitely diverting to the highwayman.</p>

  <p>Turpin's attention, however, was chiefly directed towards his neighbor,
  the ruffler, in whom he recognized a famous impostor of the day, with whose
  history he was sufficiently well acquainted to be able at once to identify
  the individual. We have before stated, that a magnificent coal-black beard
  decorated the chin of this worthy; but this was not all&mdash;his costume was
  in perfect keeping with his beard, and consisted of a very theatrical-looking
  tunic, upon the breast of which was embroidered, in golden wire, the Maltese
  cross; while over his shoulders were thrown the folds of an ample cloak of
  Tyrian hue. To his side was girt a long and doughty sword, which he termed,
  in his knightly phrase, Excalibur; and upon his profuse hair rested a hat as
  broad in the brim as a Spanish sombrero.</p>

  <p>Exaggerated as this description may appear, we can assure our readers that
  it is not overdrawn; and that a counterpart of the sketch we have given of
  the ruffler certainly "strutted his hour" upon the stage of human life, and
  that the very ancient and discriminating city of Canterbury&mdash;to which be
  all honor&mdash;was his theatre of action. His history is so far curious,
  that it exemplifies, more strongly than a thousand discourses could do, how
  prone we are to be governed by appearances, and how easily we may be made the
  dupes of a plausible impostor. Be it remembered, however, that we treat of
  the eighteenth century, before the march of intellect had commenced; we are
  much too knowing to be similarly practised upon in these enlightened times.
  But we will let the knight of Malta, for such was the title assumed by the
  ruffler, tell his own story in his own way hereafter; contenting ourselves
  with the moral precepts we have already deduced from it.</p>

  <p>Next to the knight of Malta stood the whip-jack, habited in his sailor
  gear&mdash;striped shirt and dirty canvas trousers; and adjoining him was the
  palliard, a loathsome tatterdemalion, his dress one heap of rags, and his
  discolored skin one mass of artificial leprosy and imposthumes.</p>

  <p>As Turpin's eye shifted from one to another of these figures, he chanced
  upon an individual who had been long endeavoring to arrest his attention.
  This personage was completely in the background. All that Dick could discern
  of him was a brown curly head of hair, carelessly arranged in the modern
  mode; a handsome, impudent, sun-freckled face, with one eye closed, and the
  other occupied by a broken bottle-neck, through which, as a substitute for a
  lorgnette, the individual reconnoitered him. A cocked hat was placed in a
  very <i>dégagée</i> manner under his arm, and he held an ebony cane in his
  hand, very much in the style of a "<i>fassionable</i>," as the French have
  it, of the present day. This glimpse was sufficient to satisfy Turpin. He
  recognized in this whimsical personage an acquaintance.</p>

  <p>Jerry Juniper was what the classical Captain Grose would designate a
  "gentleman with three outs," and, although he was not entirely without wit,
  nor, his associates avouched, without money, nor, certainly, in his own
  opinion, had that been asked, without manners; yet was he assuredly without
  shoes, without stockings, without shirt. This latter deficiency was made up
  by a voluminous cravat, tied with proportionately large bows. A jaunty pair
  of yellow breeches, somewhat faded; a waistcoat of silver brocade, richly
  embroidered, somewhat tarnished and lack-lustre; a murrey-colored velvet
  coat, somewhat chafed, completed the costume of this beggar Brummell, this
  mendicant macaroni!</p>

  <p>Jerry Juniper was a character well known at the time, as a constant
  frequenter of all races, fairs, regattas, ship-launches, bull-baits, and
  prize-fights, all of which he attended, and to which he transported himself
  with an expedition little less remarkable than that of Turpin. You met him at
  Epsom, at Ascot, at Newmarket, at Doncaster, at the Roodee of Chester, at the
  Curragh of Kildare. The most remote as well as the most adjacent meeting
  attracted him. The cock-pit was his constant haunt, and in more senses than
  one was he a <i>leg</i>. No opera-dancer could be more agile, more nimble;
  scarcely, indeed, more graceful, than was Jerry, with his shoeless and
  stockingless feet; and the manner in which he executed a pirouette, or a pas,
  before a line of carriages, seldom failed to procure him "golden opinions
  from all sorts of dames." With the ladies, it must be owned, Jerry was rather
  upon too easy terms; but then, perhaps, the ladies were upon too easy terms
  with Jerry; and if a bright-eyed fair one condescended to jest with him, what
  marvel if he should sometimes slightly transgress the laws of decorum. These
  aberrations, however, were trifling; altogether he was so well known, and
  knew everybody else so well, that he seldom committed himself; and, singular
  to say, could on occasions even be serious. In addition to his other
  faculties, no one cut a sly joke, or trolled a merry ditty, better than
  Jerry. His peculiarities, in short, were on the pleasant side, and he was a
  general favorite in consequence.</p>

  <p>No sooner did Jerry perceive that he was recognized, than, after kissing
  his hand, with the air of a <i>petit-ma tre</i>, to the highwayman, he strove
  to edge his way through the crowd. All his efforts were fruitless; and, tired
  of a situation in the rear rank, so inconsistent, he conceived, with his own
  importance, he had recourse to an expedient often practised with success in
  harlequinades, and not unfrequently in real life, where a flying leap is
  occasionally taken over our heads. He ran back a few yards to give himself an
  impetus, returned, and, placing his hands upon the shoulders of a stalwart
  vagabond near to him, threw a summerset upon the broad cap of a palliard, who
  was so jammed in the midst that he could not have stirred to avoid the shock;
  thence, without pausing, he vaulted forwards, and dropped lightly upon the
  ground in front of Zoroaster, and immediately before the highwayman.</p>

  <p>Dick laughed immoderately at Jerry's manoeuvre. He shook his old chum
  cordially by the hand, saying, in a whisper, "What the devil brings you here,
  Jerry?"</p>

  <p>"I might retort, and ask you that question, Captain Turpin," replied
  Jerry, <i>sotto voce</i>. "It is odd to see me here, certainly&mdash;quite
  out of my element&mdash;lost amongst this <i>canaille</i>&mdash;this Canting
  Crew&mdash;all the fault of a pair of gipsy eyes, bright as a diamond, dark
  as a sloe. You comprehend&mdash;a little affair, ha! Liable to these things.
  Bring your ear closer, my boy; be upon your guard&mdash;keep a sharp look
  out&mdash;there's a devil of a reward upon your head&mdash;I won't answer for
  all those rascals."</p>

  <p>"Thank you for the hint, Jerry," replied Dick, in the same tone. "I
  calculated my chances pretty nicely when I came here. But if I should
  perceive any symptoms of foul play&mdash;any attempt to snitch or nose,
  amongst this pack of peddlers&mdash;I have a friend or two at hand, who won't
  be silent upon the occasion. Rest assured I shall have my eye upon the
  gnarling scoundrels. I won't be sold for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Trust you for that," returned Juniper, with a wink. "Stay," added he; "a
  thought strikes me. I have a scheme <i>in petto</i> which may, perhaps,
  afford you some fun, and will, at all events, insure your safety during your
  stay."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Just amuse yourself with a flirtation for a moment or two with that
  pretty damsel, who has been casting her ogles at you for the last five
  minutes without success, while I effect a master-stroke."</p>

  <p>And as Turpin, nothing loth, followed his advice, Jerry addressed himself
  to Zoroaster. After a little conference, accompanied by that worthy and the
  knight of Malta, the trio stepped forward from the line, and approached Dick,
  when Juniper, assuming some such attitude as our admirable Jones, the
  comedian, is wont to display, delivered himself of the following address.
  Turpin listened with the gravity of one of the distinguished persons alluded
  to, at the commencement of the present chapter, upon their receiving the
  freedom of the city at the hands of a mayor and corporation. Thus spoke
  Jerry:</p>

  <p>"Highest of High-Tobymen! rummest of rum Padders, and most scampish of
  Scampsmen! We, in the name of Barbara, our most tawny queen; in the name of
  Zoroaster, our Upright Man, Dimber Damber, or Olli Campolli, by all which
  titles his excellency is distinguished; in our own respective names, as High
  Pads and Low Pads, Rum Gills and Queer Gills, Patricos, Palliards, Priggers,
  Whip-Jacks, and Jarkmen, from the Arch Rogue to the Needy Mizzler, fully
  sensible of the honor you have conferred upon us in gracing Stop-Hole Abbey
  with your presence; and conceiving that we can in no way evince our sense of
  your condescension so entirely as by offering you the freedom of our crew,
  together with the privileges of an Upright Man,[34] which you may be aware
  are considerable, and by creating you an honorary member of the Vagrant Club,
  which we have recently established; and in so doing, we would fain express
  the sentiments of gratification and pride which we experience in enrolling
  among our members one who has extended the glory of roguery so widely over
  the land, and who has kicked up such a dust upon the highways of England, as
  most effectually to blind the natives&mdash;one who is in himself a
  legion&mdash;of highwaymen! Awaiting, with respectful deference, the
  acquiescence of Captain Richard Turpin, we beg to tender him the freedom of
  our crew."</p>

  <p>"Really, gentlemen," said Turpin, who did not exactly see the drift of
  this harangue, "you do me a vast deal of honor. I am quite at a loss to
  conceive how I can possibly have merited so much attention at your hands;
  and, indeed, I feel myself so unworthy&mdash;&mdash;" Here Dick received an
  expressive wink from Juniper, and therefore thought it prudent to alter his
  expression. "Could I suppose myself at all deserving of so much distinction,"
  continued the modest speaker, "I should at once accept your very obliging
  offer; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"None so worthy," said the upright man.</p>

  <p>"Can't hear of a refusal," said the knight of Malta.</p>

  <p>"Refusal&mdash;impossible!" reiterated Juniper.</p>

  <p>"No; no refusal," exclaimed a chorus of voices. "Dick Turpin must be one
  of us. He shall be our dimber damber."</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen, since you are so pressing," replied Turpin, "even so be
  it. I <i>will</i> be your dimber damber."</p>

  <p>"Bravo! bravo!" cried the mob, <i>not</i> "of gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"About it, pals, at once," said the knight of Malta, flourishing
  Excalibur. "By St. Thomas à Becket, we'll have as fine a scene as I myself
  ever furnished to the Canterbury lieges."</p>

  <p>"About what?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"Your matriculation," replied Jerry. "There are certain forms to be gone
  through, with an oath to be taken, merely a trifle. We'll have a jolly booze
  when all's over. Come bing avast, my merry pals; to the green, to the green:
  a Turpin! a Turpin! a new brother!"</p>

  <p>"A Turpin! a Turpin! a new brother!" echoed the crew.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you through," said Jerry, taking advantage of the uproar
  that ensued to whisper to his chum; "none of them will dare to lift a finger
  against you now. They are all your friends for life."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," returned Turpin, "I should be glad to know what has become
  of Bess."</p>

  <p>"If it's your prancer you are wanting," chirped a fluttering creature,
  whom Turpin recognized as Luke's groom, Grasshopper, "I gave her a fresh loaf
  and a stoup of stingo, as you bade me, and there she be, under yon tree, as
  quiet as a lamb."</p>

  <p>"I see her," replied Turpin; "just tighten her girths, Grasshopper, and
  bring her after me, and thou shalt have wherewithal to chirp over thy cups at
  supper."</p>

  <p>Away bounded the elfin dwarf to execute his behest.</p>

  <p>A loud shout now rent the skies, and presently afterwards was heard the
  vile scraping of a fiddle, accompanied by the tattoo of a drum. Approaching
  Turpin, a host of gipsies elevated the highwayman upon their shoulders, and
  in this way he was carried to the centre of the green, where the long oaken
  table, which had once served the Franciscans for refection, was now destined
  for the stage of the pageant.</p>

  <p>Upon this table three drums were placed; and Turpin was requested to seat
  himself on the central one. A solemn prelude, more unearthly than the
  incantation in the Freyschütz, was played by the orchestra of the band,
  conducted by the Paganini of the place, who elicited the most marvellous
  notes from his shell. A couple of shawms[35] emitted sepulchral sounds, while
  the hollow rolling of a drum broke ever and anon upon the ear. The effect was
  prodigiously fine. During this overture the patrico and the upright man had
  ascended the rostrum, each taking his place; the former on the right hand of
  Turpin, the latter upon his left. Below them stood the knight of Malta, with
  Excalibur drawn in his hand, and gleaming in the sunshine. On the whole, Dick
  was amused with what he saw, and with the novel situation in which he found
  himself placed. Around the table were congregated a compact mass of heads; so
  compact, indeed, that they looked like one creature&mdash;an Argus, with each
  eye upturned upon the highwayman. The idea struck Turpin that the restless
  mass of parti-colored shreds and patches, of vivid hues and varied tintings,
  singularly, though accidentally, disposed to produce such an effect,
  resembled an immense tiger-moth, or it might be a Turkey carpet spread out
  upon the grass!</p>

  <p>The scene was a joyous one. It was a brilliant sunshiny morning. Freshened
  and purified by the storm of the preceding night, the air breathed a balm
  upon the nerves and senses of the robber. The wooded hills were glittering in
  light; the brook was flowing swiftly past the edge of the verdant slope,
  glancing like a wreathed snake in the sunshine&mdash;its "quiet song" lost in
  the rude harmony of the mummers, as were the thousand twitterings of the
  rejoicing birds; the rocks bared their bosoms to the sun, or were buried in
  deep-cast gloom; the shadows of the pillars and arches of the old walls of
  the priory were projected afar, while the rose-like ramifications of the
  magnificent marigold window were traced, as if by a pencil, upon the verdant
  tablet of the sod.</p>

  <p>The overture was finished. With the appearance of the principal figures in
  this strange picture the reader is already familiar. It remains only to give
  him some idea of the patrico. Imagine, then, an old superannuated goat,
  reared upon its hind legs, and clad in a white sheet, disposed in folds like
  those of a simar about its limbs, and you will have some idea of Balthazar,
  the patrico. This resemblance to the animal before mentioned was rendered the
  more striking by his huge, hanging, goat-like under lip, his lengthy white
  beard, and a sort of cap, covering his head, which was ornamented with a pair
  of horns, such as are to be seen in Michael Angelo's tremendous statue of
  Moses. Balthazar, besides being the patrico of the tribe, was its principal
  professor of divination, and had been the long-tried and faithful minister of
  Barbara Lovel, from whose secret instructions he was supposed to have derived
  much of his magical skill.</p>

  <p>Placing a pair of spectacles upon his "prognosticating nose," and
  unrolling a vellum skin, upon which strange characters were written,
  Balthazar, turning to Turpin, thus commenced in a solemn voice:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">Thou who wouldst our brother be,<br>
  Say how we shall enter thee?<br>
  Name the name that thou wilt bear<br>
  Ere our livery thou wear?</p><br>

  <p>"I see no reason why I should alter my designation," replied the
  noviciate; "but as popes change their titles on their creation, there can be
  no objection to a scampsman following so excellent an example. Let me be
  known as the Night Hawk."</p>

  <p>"The Night Hawk&mdash;good," returned the hierophant, proceeding to
  register the name upon the parchment. "Kneel down," continued he.</p>

  <p>After some hesitation, Turpin complied.</p>

  <p>"You must repeat the 'salamon,' or oath of our creed, after my dictation,"
  said the patrico; and Turpin, signifying his assent by a nod, Balthazar
  propounded the following abjuration:</p>

  <h3>OATH OF THE CANTING CREW</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">I, Crank-Cuffin, swear to be<br>
  True to this fraternity;<br>

  But stall-off now and for ever,<br>
  All outliers whatsoever:<br>
  And as I keep to the foregone,<br>
  So may help me Salamon![36]</p><br>

  <p>"So help me Salamon!" repeated Turpin, with emphasis.</p>

  <p>"Zoroaster," said the patrico to the upright man, "do thy part of this
  ceremonial."</p>

  <p>Zoroaster obeyed; and, taking Excalibur from the knight of Malta, bestowed
  a hearty thwack with the blade upon the shoulders of the kneeling highwayman,
  assisting him afterwards to arise.</p>

  <p>The inauguration was complete.</p>

  <p>"Well," exclaimed Dick, "I'm glad it's all over. My leg feels a little
  stiffish. I'm not much given to kneeling. I must dance it off;" saying which,
  he began to shuffle upon the boards. "I tell you what," continued he, "most
  reverend patrico, that same 'salmon' of yours has a cursed long tail. I could
  scarce swallow it all, and it's strange if it don't give me an indigestion.
  As to you, sage Zory, from the dexterity with which you flourish your sword,
  I should say you had practised at court. His majesty could scarce do the
  thing better, when, slapping some fat alderman upon the shoulder, he bids him
  arise Sir Richard. And now, pals," added he, glancing round, "as I am one of
  you, let's have a booze together ere I depart, for I don't think my stay will
  be long in the land of Egypt."</p>

  <p>This suggestion of Turpin was so entirely consonant to the wishes of the
  assemblage, that it met with universal approbation; and upon a sign from
  Zoroaster, some of his followers departed in search of supplies for the
  carousal. Zoroaster leaped from the table, and his example was followed by
  Turpin, and more leisurely by the patrico.</p>

  <p>It was rather early in the day for a drinking bout. But the Canting Crew
  were not remarkably particular. The chairs were removed, and the jingling of
  glasses announced the arrival of the preliminaries of the matutine symposion.
  Poles, canvas, and cords were next brought; and in almost as short a space of
  time as one scene is substituted for another in a theatrical representation,
  a tent was erected. Benches, stools, and chairs appeared with equal celerity,
  and the interior soon presented an appearance like that of a booth at a fair.
  A keg of brandy was broached, and the health of the new brother quaffed in
  brimmers.</p>

  <p>Our highwayman returned thanks. Zoroaster was in the chair, the knight of
  Malta acting as croupier. A second toast was proposed&mdash;the tawny queen.
  This was drunk with a like enthusiasm, and with a like allowance of the
  potent spirit; but as bumpers of brandy are not to be repeated with impunity,
  it became evident to the president of the board that he must not repeat his
  toasts quite so expeditiously. To create a temporary diversion, therefore, he
  called for a song.</p>

  <p>The dulcet notes of the fiddle now broke through the clamor; and, in
  answer to the call, Jerry Juniper volunteered the following:</p>

  <p>Much laughter and applause rewarded Jerry's attempt to please; and though
  the meaning of his chant, even with the aid of the numerous notes appended to
  it, may not be quite obvious to our readers, we can assure them that it was
  perfectly intelligible to the Canting Crew. Jerry was now entitled to a call;
  and happening, at the moment, to meet the fine dark eyes of a sentimental
  gipsy, one of that better class of mendicants who wandered about the country
  with a guitar at his back, his election fell upon him. The youth, without
  prelude, struck up a</p>

  <h3>GIPSY SERENADE</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">Merry maid, merry maid, wilt thou wander with
     me?<br>
  We will roam through the forest, the meadow, and lea;<br>
  We will haunt the sunny bowers, and when day begins to flee,<br>
  Our couch shall be the ferny brake, our canopy the tree.<br>
  <i>Merry maid, merry maid, come and wander with me!<br>
  No life like the gipsy's, so joyous and free!</i></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">Merry maid, merry maid, though a roving life be

  <i>Merry maid, merry maid, come and wander with me!<br>
  No life like the gipsy's so joyous and free!</i></p><br>

  <p>Zoroaster now removed the pipe from his upright lips to intimate his
  intention of proposing a toast.</p>

  <p>A universal knocking of knuckles by the knucklers[73] was followed by
  profound silence. The sage spoke:</p>

  <p>"The city of Canterbury, pals," said he; "and may it never want a knight
  of Malta."</p>

  <p>The toast was pledged with much laughter, and in many bumpers.</p>

  <p>The knight, upon whom all eyes were turned, rose, "with stately bearing
  and majestic motion," to return thanks.</p>

  <p>"I return you an infinitude of thanks, brother pals," said he, glancing
  round the assemblage; and bowing to the president, "and to you, most upright
  Zory, for the honor you have done me in associating my name with that city.
  Believe me, I sincerely appreciate the compliment, and echo the sentiment
  from the bottom of my soul. I trust it never <i>will</i> want a knight of
  Malta. In return for your consideration, but a poor one you will say, you
  shall have a ditty, which I composed upon the occasion of my pilgrimage to
  that city, and which I have thought proper to name after myself."</p>

  <p>The knight sat down amidst the general plaudits of the company.</p>

  <p>The party, meanwhile, had been increased by the arrival of Luke and the
  sexton. The former, who was in no mood for revelry, refused to comply with
  his grandsire's solicitation to enter, and remained sullenly at the door,
  with his arms folded, and his eyes fixed upon Turpin, whose movements he
  commanded through the canvas aperture. The sexton walked up to Dick, who was
  seated at the post of honor, and, clapping him upon the shoulder,
  congratulated him upon the comfortable position in which he found him.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha! Are you there, my old death's-head on a mop-stick?" said Turpin,
  with a laugh. "Ain't we merry mumpers, eh? Keeping it up in style. Sit down,
  old Noah&mdash;make yourself comfortable, Methusalem."</p>

  <p>"What say you to a drop of as fine Nantz as you ever tasted in your life,
  old cove?" said Zoroaster.</p>

  <p>"I have no sort of objection to it," returned Peter, "provided you will
  all pledge my toast."</p>

  <p>"That I will, were it old Ruffin himself," shouted Turpin.</p>

  <p>"Here's to the three-legged mare," cried Peter. "To the tree that bears
  fruit all the year round, and yet has neither bark nor branch. You won't
  refuse that toast, Captain Turpin?"</p>

  <p>"Not I," answered Dick; "I owe the gallows no grudge. If, as Jerry's song
  says, I must have a 'hearty choke and caper sauce' for my breakfast one of
  these fine mornings, it shall never be said that I fell to my meal without
  appetite, or neglected saying grace before it. Gentlemen, here's Peter
  Bradley's toast: 'The scragging post&mdash;the three-legged mare,' with three
  times three."</p>

  <p>Appropriate as this sentiment was, it did not appear to be so inviting to
  the party as might have been anticipated, and the shouts soon died away.</p>

  <p>"They like not the thoughts of the gallows," said Turpin to Peter. "More
  fools they. A mere bugbear to frighten children, believe me; and never yet
  alarmed a brave man. The gallows, pshaw! One can but die once, and what
  signifies it how, so that it be over quickly. I think no more of the last
  leap into eternity than clearing a five-barred gate. A rope's end for it! So
  let us be merry, and make the most of our time, and that's true philosophy. I
  know you can throw off a rum chant," added he, turning to Peter. "I heard you
  sing last night at the hall. Troll us a stave, my antediluvian file, and, in
  the meantime, tip me a gage of fogus,[75] Jerry; and if that's a bowl of
  huckle-my-butt[76] you are brewing, Sir William," added he, addressing the
  knight of Malta, "you may send me a jorum at your convenience."</p>

  <p>Jerry handed the highwayman a pipe, together with a tumbler of the
  beverage which the knight had prepared, which he pronounced excellent; and
  while the huge bowl was passed round to the company, a prelude of shawms
  announced that Peter was ready to break into song.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, after the symphony was ended, accompanied at intervals by a
  single instrument, Peter began his melody, in a key so high, that the utmost
  exertions of the shawm-blower failed to approach its altitudes. The burden of

  <p>"A queer chant that," said Zoroaster, coughing loudly, in token of
  disapprobation.</p>

  <p>"Not much to my taste," quoth the knight of Malta. "We like something more
  sprightly in Canterbury."</p>

  <p>"Nor to mine," added Jerry; "don't think it's likely to have an encore.
  'Pon my soul, Dick, you must give us something yourself, or we shall never
  cry Euthanasy at the Triple Tree."</p>

  <p>"With all my heart," replied Turpin. "You shall have&mdash;but what do I
  see, my friend Sir Luke? Devil take my tongue, Luke Bradley, I mean. What,
  ho! Luke&mdash;nay, nay, man, no shrinking&mdash;stand forward; I've a word
  or two to say to you. We must have a hob-a-nob glass together for old
  acquaintance sake. Nay, no airs, man; damme you're not a lord yet, nor a
  baronet either, though I do hold your title in my pocket; never look glum at
  me. It won't pay. I'm one of the Canting Crew now; no man shall sneer at me
  with impunity, eh, Zory? Ha, ha! here's a glass of Nantz; we'll have a bottle
  of black strap when you are master of your own. Make ready there, you
  gut-scrapers, you shawm-shavers; I'll put your lungs in play for you
  presently. In the meantime&mdash;charge, pals, charge&mdash;a toast, a toast!
  Health and prosperity to Sir Luke Rookwood! I see you are
  surprised&mdash;this, gemmen, is Sir Luke Rookwood, somewhile Luke Bradley,
  heir to the house of that name, not ten miles distant from this. Say, shall
  we not drink a bumper to his health?"</p>

  <p>Astonishment prevailed amongst the crew. Luke himself had been taken by
  surprise. When Turpin discovered him at the door of the tent, and summoned
  him to appear, he reluctantly complied with the request; but when, in a
  half-bantering vein, Dick began to rally him upon his pretensions, he would
  most gladly have retreated, had it been in his power. It was then too late.
  He felt he must stand the ordeal. Every eye was fixed upon him with a look of
  inquiry.</p>

  <p>Zoroaster took his everlasting pipe from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"This ain't true, sure<i>ly</i>?" asked the perplexed Magus.</p>

  <p>"He has said it," replied Luke; "I may not deny it."</p>

  <p>This was sufficient. There was a wild hubbub of delight amongst the crew,
  for Luke was a favorite with all.</p>

  <p>"Sir Luke Rookwood!" cried Jerry Juniper, who liked a title as much as
  Tommy Moore is said to dote upon a lord. "Upon my soul I sincerely
  congratulate you; devilish fortunate fellow. Always cursed unlucky myself. I
  could never find out my own father, unless it were one Monsieur des
  Capriolles, a French dancing-master, and <i>he</i> never left anything behind
  him that I could hear of, except a broken kit and a hempen widow. Sir Luke
  Rookwood, we shall do ourselves the pleasure of drinking your health and
  prosperity."</p>

  <p>Fresh bumpers and immense cheering.</p>

  <p>Silence being in a measure restored, Zoroaster claimed Turpin's promise of
  a song.</p>

  <p>"True, true," replied Dick; "I have not forgotten it. Stand to your bows,
  my hearties."</p>

  <p>"And now, pals," said Dick, who began to feel the influence of these
  morning cups, "I vote that we adjourn. Believe me I shall always bear in mind
  that I am a brother of your band. Sir Luke and I must have a little chat
  together ere I take my leave. Adieu!"</p>

  <p>And taking Luke by the arm, he walked out of the tent. Peter Bradley rose,
  and followed them.</p>

  <p>At the door they found the dwarfish Grasshopper with Black Bess. Rewarding
  the urchin for his trouble, and slipping the bridle of his mare over his
  hand, Turpin continued his walk over the green. For a few minutes he seemed
  to be lost in rumination.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what, Sir Luke," said he; "I should like to do a generous
  thing, and make you a present of this bit of paper. But one ought not to
  throw away one's luck, you know&mdash;there is a tide in the affairs of
  thieves, as the player coves say, which must be taken at the flood, or
  else&mdash;&mdash;no matter! Your old dad, Sir Piers&mdash;God help
  him!&mdash;had the gingerbread, <i>that</i> I know; he was, as we say, a
  regular rhino-cerical cull. You won't feel a few thousands, especially at
  starting; and besides, there are two others, Rust and Wilder, who row in the
  same boat with me, and must therefore come in for their share of the
  reg'lars. All this considered, you can't complain, I think if I ask five
  thousand for it. That old harridan, Lady Rookwood, offered me nearly as
  much."</p>

  <p>"I will not talk to you of fairness," said Luke; "I will not say that
  document belongs of right to me. It fell by accident into your hands. Having
  possessed yourself of it, I blame you not that you dispose of it to the best
  advantage. I must, perforce, agree to your terms."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," replied Dick, "it's quite optional; Lady Rookwood will give as
  much, and make no mouths about it. Soho, lass! What makes Bess prick her ears
  in that fashion?&mdash;Ha! carriage-wheels in the distance! that jade knows
  the sound as well as I do. I'll just see what it's like!&mdash;you will have
  ten minutes for reflection. Who knows if I may not have come in for a good
  thing here?"</p>

  <p>At that instant the carriage passed the angle of a rock some three hundred
  yards distant, and was seen slowly ascending the hill-side. Eager as a hawk
  after his quarry, Turpin dashed after it.</p>

  <p>In vain the sexton, whom he nearly overthrew in his career, called after
  him to halt. He sped like a bolt from the bow.</p>

  <p>"May the devil break his neck!" cried Peter, as he saw him dash through
  the brook; "could he not let them alone?"</p>

  <p>"This must not be," said Luke; "know you whose carriage it is?"</p>

  <p>"It is a shrine that holds the jewel that should be dearest in your eyes,"
  returned Peter; "haste, and arrest the spoiler's hand."</p>

  <p>"Whom do you mean?" asked Luke.</p>

  <p>"Eleanor Mowbray," replied Peter. "She is there. To the
  rescue&mdash;away."</p>

  <p>"Eleanor Mowbray!" echoed Luke&mdash;"and Sybil?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>At this instant a pistol-shot was heard.</p>

  <p>"Will you let murder be done, and upon your cousin?" cried Peter, with a
  bitter look. "You are not what I took you for."</p>

  <p>Luke answered not, but, swift as the hound freed from the leash, darted in
  the direction of the carriage.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-6"
     name="ch3-6"></a>CHAPTER VI. &mdash; ELEANOR MOWBRAY</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">&mdash;&mdash;Mischiefs<br>
  Are like the visits of Franciscan friars,<br>
  They never come to prey upon us single.<br>
  &mdash;<i>Devil's Law Case.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE course of our tale returns now to Eleanor Mowbray. After
  she had parted from Ranulph Rookwood, and had watched him disappear beneath
  the arches of the church porch, her heart sank, and, drawing herself back
  within the carriage, she became a prey to the most poignant affliction. In
  vain she endeavored to shake off this feeling of desolation. It would not be.
  Despair had taken possession of her; the magic fabric of delight melted away,
  or only gleamed to tantalize, at an unreachable distance. A presentiment that
  Ranulph would never be hers had taken root in her imagination, and
  overshadowed all the rest.</p>

  <p>While Eleanor pursued this train of reflection, the time insensibly wore
  away, until the sudden stoppage of the carriage aroused the party from their
  meditation. Major Mowbray perceived that the occasion of the halt was the
  rapid advance of a horseman, who was nearing them at full speed. The
  appearance of the rider was somewhat singular, and might have created some
  uneasiness as to the nature of his approach, had not the major immediately
  recognized a friend; he was, nevertheless, greatly surprised to see him, and
  turned to Mrs. Mowbray to inform her that Father Ambrose, to his infinite
  astonishment, was coming to meet them, and appeared, from his manner, to be
  the bearer of unwelcome tidings.</p>

  <p>Father Ambrose was, perhaps, the only being whom Eleanor disliked. She had
  felt an unaccountable antipathy towards him, which she could neither
  extirpate nor control, during their long and close intimacy. It may be
  necessary to mention that her religious culture had been in accordance with
  the tenets of the Romish Church, in whose faith&mdash;the faith of her
  ancestry&mdash;her mother had continued; and that Father Ambrose, with whom
  she had first become acquainted during the residence of the family near
  Bordeaux, was her ghostly adviser and confessor. An Englishman by birth, he
  had been appointed pastor to the diocese in which they dwelt, and was,
  consequently, a frequent visitor, almost a constant inmate of the château;
  yet though duty and respect would have prompted her to regard the father with
  affection, Eleanor could never conquer the feelings of dislike and distrust
  which she had at first entertained towards him; a dislike which was increased
  by the strange control in which he seemed to hold her mother, who regarded
  him with a veneration approaching to infatuation. It was, therefore, with
  satisfaction that she bade him adieu. He had, however, followed his friends
  to England under a feigned name as&mdash;being a recusant Romish priest, and
  supposed to have been engaged in certain Jesuitical plots, his return to his
  own country was attended with considerable risk&mdash;, and had now remained
  domesticated with them for some months. That he had been in some way, in
  early life, connected with a branch of the house of Rookwood, Eleanor was
  aware&mdash;she fancied he might have been engaged in political intrigue with
  Sir Reginald, which would have well accorded with his ardent, ambitious
  temperament&mdash;, and the knowledge of this circumstance made her doubly
  apprehensive lest the nature of his present communication should have
  reference to her lover, towards whose cause the father had never been
  favorable, and respecting whose situation he might have made some discovery,
  which she feared he might use to Ranulph's disadvantage.</p>

  <p>Wrapped in a long black cloak, with a broad-brimmed hat drawn closely over
  his brows, it was impossible to distinguish further of the priest's figure
  and features beyond the circumstance of his height, which was remarkable,
  until he had reached the carriage window, when, raising his hat, he disclosed
  a head that Titian might have painted, and which, arising from the dark
  drapery, looked not unlike the visage of some grave and saturnine Venetian.
  There was a venerable expanse of forehead, thinly scattered with hair,
  towering over black pent-house-like brows, which, in their turn, shadowed
  keen penetrating eyes; the temples were hollow, and blue veins might be
  traced beneath the sallow skin; the cheek-bones were high, and there was
  something in the face that spoke of self-mortification; while the thin livid
  lips, closely compressed, and the austere and sinister expression of his
  countenance, showed that his self-abasement, if he had ever practised it, had
  scarcely prostrated the demon of pride, whose dominion might still be traced
  in the lines and furrows of his haughty physiognomy. The father looked at
  Mrs. Mowbray, and then glanced suspiciously at Eleanor. The former appeared
  to understand him.</p>

  <p>"You would say a word to me in private," said Mrs. Mowbray; "shall I
  descend?"</p>

  <p>The priest bowed assent.</p>

  <p>"It is not to you alone that my mission extends," said he, gravely; "you
  are all in part concerned; your son had better alight with you."</p>

  <p>"Instantly," replied the major. "If you will give your horse in charge to
  the postilion, we will attend you at once."</p>

  <p>With a feeling of renewed apprehension, connected, she knew not why, with
  Ranulph, Eleanor beheld her relatives descend from the carriage; and, in the
  hope of gaining some clue from their gestures to the subject of their
  conversation, she watched their motions as narrowly as her situation
  permitted. From the earnest manner of the priest, and the interest his
  narrative seemed to excite in his hearers, it was evident that his
  communication was of importance.</p>

  <p>Presently, accompanied by Father Ambrose, Mrs. Mowbray returned to the
  carriage, while the major, mounting the priest's horse, after bidding a hasty
  adieu to his sister, adding, with a look that belied the consolation intended
  to be conveyed by his words, that "all was well," but without staying to
  offer her any explanation of the cause of his sudden departure, rode back the
  way they had just traversed, and in the direction of Rookwood. Bereft of the
  only person to whom she could have applied for information, though dying with
  curiosity and anxiety to know the meaning of this singular interview and of
  the sudden change of plans which she felt so intimately concerned herself,
  Eleanor was constrained to preserve silence, as, after their entrance into
  the carriage, her mother again seemed lost in painful reflection, and heeded
  her not; and the father, drawing from his pocket a small volume, appeared
  intently occupied in its perusal.</p>

  <p>"Dear mother," said Eleanor, at length, turning to Mrs. Mowbray, "my
  brother is gone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To Rookwood," said Mrs. Mowbray, in a tone calculated to check further
  inquiry; but Eleanor was too anxious to notice it.</p>

  <p>"And wherefore, mother?" said she. "May I not be informed?"</p>

  <p>"Not as yet, my child&mdash;not as yet," replied Mrs. Mowbray. "You will
  learn all sufficiently early."</p>

  <p>The priest raised his cat-like eyes from the book to watch the effect of
  this speech, and dropped them instantly as Eleanor turned towards him. She
  had been about to appeal to him, but having witnessed this look, she
  relinquished her scarce-formed purpose, and endeavored to divert her tristful
  thoughts by gazing through the glimmering medium of her tears upon the
  soothing aspect of external nature&mdash;that aspect which, in sunshine or in
  storm, has ever relief in store for a heart embittered by the stormy coldness
  of the world.</p>

  <p>The road, meanwhile, led them through a long woody valley, and was now
  climbing the sides of a steep hill. They were soon in the vicinity of the
  priory, and of the gipsies' encampment. The priest leaned forward, and
  whispered something in Mrs. Mowbray's ear, who looked towards the ruined
  shrine, part of the mouldering walls being visible from the road.</p>

  <p>At the moment the clatter of a horse's hoofs, and the sound of a loud
  voice, commanding the postilion, in a menacing tone, to stop, accompanied by
  a volley of imprecations, interrupted the conference, and bespoke the
  approach of an unwelcome intruder, and one whom all, too truly, feared would
  not be readily dismissed. The postilion did his best to rid them of the
  assailant. Perceiving a masked horseman behind him, approaching at a furious
  rate, he had little doubt as to his intentions, and Turpin, for it was our
  highwayman, soon made his doubts certainties. He hallooed to him to stop; but
  the fellow paid no attention to his command, and disregarded even the pistol
  which he saw, in a casual glimpse over his near side, presented at his
  person. Clapping spurs into his horse's flanks, he sought succor in flight.
  Turpin was by his side in an instant. As the highwayman endeavored to catch
  his reins, the lad suddenly wheeled the carriage right upon him, and but for
  the dexterity of Turpin, and the clever conduct of his mare, would inevitably
  have crushed him against the roadside. As it was, his left leg was slightly
  grazed. Irritated at this, Turpin fired over the man's head, and with the
  butt-end of the pistol felled him from his seat. Startled by the sound, and
  no longer under the governance of their rider, the horses rushed with frantic
  violence towards a ditch that bounded the other side of the highway, down
  which the carriage was precipitated, and at once overturned. Turpin's first
  act, after he had ascertained that no mischief had been occasioned to those
  within, beyond the alarm incident to the shock, was to compel the postilion,
  who had by this time gained his legs, to release the horses from their
  traces. This done, with the best grace he could assume, and, adjusting his
  mask, he opened the carriage, and proceeded to liberate the captives.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, ma'am," said he, as soon as he had released Mrs. Mowbray;
  "excessively sorry, upon my soul, to have been the cause of so much
  unnecessary alarm to you&mdash;all the fault, I assure you, of that rascal of
  a postilion; had the fellow only pulled up when I commanded him, this
  botheration might have been avoided. You will remember that, when you pay
  him&mdash;all his fault, I assure you, ma'am."</p>

  <p>Receiving no reply, he proceeded to extricate Eleanor, with whose beauty
  the inflammable highwayman was instantly smitten. Leaving the father to shift
  for himself, he turned to address some observation of coarse gallantry to
  her; but she eluded his grasp, and flew to her mother's side.</p>

  <p>"It is useless, sir," said Mrs. Mowbray, as Turpin drew near them, "to
  affect ignorance of your intentions. You have already occasioned us serious
  alarm; much delay and inconvenience. I trust, therefore, that beyond our
  purses, to which, though scantily supplied, you are welcome, we shall sustain
  no molestation. You seem to have less of the ruffian about you than the rest
  of your lawless race, and are not, I should hope, destitute of common
  humanity."</p>

  <p>"Common humanity!" replied Turpin: "bless you, ma'am, I'm the most humane
  creature breathing&mdash;would not hurt a fly, much less a lady. Incivility
  was never laid to my charge. This business may be managed in a few seconds;
  and as soon as we have settled the matter, I'll lend your stupid jack-boy a
  hand to put the horses to the carriage again, and get the wheels out of the
  ditch. You have a banker, ma'am, I suppose, in town&mdash;perhaps in the
  country; but I don't like country bankers; besides, I want a little ready
  cash in Rumville&mdash;beg pardon, ma'am, London I mean. My ears have been so
  stunned with those Romany patterers, I almost <i>think</i> in flash. Just
  draw me a check; I've pen and ink always ready: a check for fifty pounds,
  ma'am&mdash;only fifty. What's your banker's name? I've blank checks of all
  the best houses in my pocket; that and a kiss from the pretty lips of that
  cherry-cheeked maid," winking to Eleanor, "will fully content me. You see you
  have neither an exorbitant nor uncivil personage to deal with."</p>

  <p>Eleanor shrank closer towards her mother. Exhausted by previous agitation
  of the night, greatly frightened by the shock which she had just sustained,
  and still more alarmed by the words and gestures of the highwayman, she felt
  that she was momentarily in danger of fainting, and with difficulty prevented
  herself from falling. The priest, who had succeeded in freeing himself from
  the carriage, now placed himself between Turpin and the ladies.</p>

  <p>"Be satisfied, misguided man," said the father, in a stern voice, offering
  a purse, which Mrs. Mowbray hastily extended towards him, "with the crime you
  have already committed, and seek not to peril your soul by deeper guilt; be
  content with the plunder you now obtain, and depart; for, by my holy calling,
  I affirm to you, that if you advance one footstep towards the further
  molestation of these ladies, it shall be at the hazard of your life."</p>

  <p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Turpin. "Now this is what I like; who would have
  thought the old autem-bawler had so much pluck in him? Sir, I commend you for
  your courage, but you are mistaken. I am the quietest man breathing, and
  never harm a human being; in proof of which, only look at your rascal of a
  postilion, whom any one of my friends would have sent post-haste to the devil
  for half the trouble he gave me. Easy as I am, I never choose to be balked in
  my humors. I must have the fifty and the buss, and then I'm off, as soon as
  you like; and I may as well have the kiss while the old lady signs the check,
  and then we shall have the seal as well as the signature.
  Poh&mdash;poh&mdash;no nonsense! Many a pretty lass has thought it an honor
  to be kissed by Turpin."</p>

  <p>Eleanor recoiled with deepest disgust, as she saw the highwayman thrust
  aside the useless opposition of the priest, and approach her. He had removed
  his mask; his face, flushed with insolent triumph, was turned towards her.
  Despite the loathing, which curdled the blood within her veins, she could not
  avert her eyes. He drew near her; she uttered a shrill scream. At that moment
  a powerful grasp was laid upon Turpin's shoulder; he turned and beheld
  Luke.</p>

  <p>"Save me! save me," cried Eleanor, addressing the new comer.</p>

  <p>"Damnation!" said the highwayman, "what has brought <i>you</i> here? one
  would think you were turned assistant to all distressed damsels. Quit your
  hold, or, by the God above us, you will repent it."</p>

  <p>"Fool!" exclaimed Luke, "talk thus to one who heeds you." And as he spoke
  he hurled Turpin backwards with so much force that, staggering a few yards,
  the highwayman fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>The priest stood like one stunned with surprise at Luke's sudden
  appearance and subsequent daring action.</p>

  <p>Luke, meanwhile, approached Eleanor. He gazed upon her with curiosity
  mixed with admiration, for his heart told him she was very fair. A deathlike
  paleness had spread over her cheeks; yet still, despite the want of color,
  she looked exquisitely beautiful, and her large blue eyes eloquently thanked
  her deliverer for her rescue. The words she wanted were supplied by Mrs.
  Mowbray, who thanked him in appropriate terms, when they were interrupted by
  Turpin, who had by this time picked himself up, and was drawing near them.
  His countenance wore a fierce expression.</p>

  <p>"I tell you what," said he, "Luke Bradley, or Luke Rookwood, or whatever
  else you may call yourself, you have taken a damned unfair advantage of me in
  this matter, and deserve nothing better at my hands than that I should call
  you to instant account for it&mdash;and curse me, if I don't too."</p>

  <p>"Luke Bradley!" interrupted Mrs. Mowbray&mdash;"are you that
  individual?"</p>

  <p>"I have been so called, madam," replied Luke.</p>

  <p>"Father Ambrose, is this the person of whom you spoke?" eagerly asked the
  lady.</p>

  <p>"So I conclude," returned the priest, evasively.</p>

  <p>"Did he not call you Luke Rookwood?" eagerly demanded Eleanor. "Is that
  also your name?"</p>

  <p>"Rookwood is my name, fair cousin," replied Luke, "if I may venture to
  call you so."</p>

  <p>"And Ranulph Rookwood is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My brother."</p>

  <p>"I never heard he had a brother," rejoined Eleanor, with some agitation.
  "How can that be?"</p>

  <p>"I am his brother, nevertheless," replied Luke, moodily&mdash;"his ELDER
  BROTHER!"</p>

  <p>Eleanor turned to her mother and the priest with a look of imploring
  anguish; she saw a confirmation of the truth of this statement in their
  glances. No contradiction was offered by either to his statement; both,
  indeed, appeared in some mysterious manner prepared for it. This, then, was
  the dreaded secret. This was the cause of her brother's sudden departure. The
  truth flashed with lightning swiftness across her brain.</p>

  <p>Chagrined and mortified, Luke remarked that glance of inquiry. His pride
  was hurt at the preference thus naturally shown towards his brother. He had
  been struck, deeply struck, with her beauty. He acknowledged the truth of
  Peter's words. Eleanor's loveliness was without parallel. He had seen naught
  so fair, and the instant he beheld her, he felt that for <i>her</i> alone
  could he cancel his vows to Sybil. The spirit of rivalry and jealousy was
  instantly aroused by Eleanor's exclamations.</p>

  <p>"His elder brother!" echoed Eleanor, dwelling upon his words, and
  addressing Luke&mdash;"then you must be&mdash;but no, you are not, you cannot
  be&mdash;it is Ranulph's title&mdash;it is not yours&mdash;you are
  not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Sir Luke Rookwood," replied Luke, proudly.</p>

  <p>Ere the words were uttered Eleanor had fainted.</p>

  <p>"Assistance is at hand, madam, if you will accept it, and follow me," said
  Luke, raising the insensible girl in his arms, and bearing her down the hill
  towards the encampment, whither he was followed by Mrs. Mowbray and the
  priest, between whom, during the hurried dialogue we have detailed, very
  significant glances had been exchanged. Turpin, who, as it may be supposed,
  had not been an incurious observer of the scene passing, burst into his usual
  loud laugh on seeing Luke bear away his lovely burden.</p>

  <p>"Cousin! Ha, ha!" said he. "So the wench is his cousin. Damme, I half
  suspect he has fallen in love with his new-found cousin; and if so, Miss
  Sybil, or I'm mistaken, will look as yellow as a guinea. If that little
  Spanish devil gets it into her pretty jealous pate that he is about to bring
  home a new mistress, we shall have a tragedy-scene in the twinkling of a
  bed-post. However, I shan't lose sight of Sir Luke until I have settled my
  accounts with him. Hark ye, boy," continued he, addressing the postilion;
  "remain where you are; you won't be wanted yet awhile, I imagine. There's a
  guinea for you, to drink Dick Turpin's health."</p>

  <p>Upon which he mounted his mare, and walked her easily down the hill.</p>

  <p>"And so that be Dick Turpin, folks talk so much about," soliloquized the
  lad, looking curiously after him; "well, he's as civil-speaking a chap as
  need be, blow my boots if he ain't! and if I'd had a notion it were he, I'd
  have pulled up at first call, without more ado. Nothing like
  experience&mdash;I shall know better another time," added he, pocketing the
  douceur.</p>

  <p>Rushing swiftly down the hill, Luke tarried at the river's brink, to
  sprinkle some of the cool element upon the pale brow of Eleanor. As he held
  her in his arms, thoughts which he fain would have stifled in their birth
  took possession of his heart. "Would she were mine!" murmured he. "Yet no!
  the wish is unworthy." But that wish returned unbidden.</p>

  <p>Eleanor opened her eyes. She was still too weak to walk without support,
  and Luke, raising her once more in his arms, and motioning Mrs. Mowbray to
  follow, crossed the brook by means of stepping-stones, and conducted his
  charge along a bypath towards the priory, so as to avoid meeting with the
  crew assembled upon the green.</p>

  <p>They had gained one of the roofless halls, when he encountered Balthazar.
  Astonished at the sight of the party, the patrico was about to address the
  priest as an acquaintance, when his more orthodox brother raised his finger
  to his lips, in token of caution. The action passed unobserved.</p>

  <p>"Hie thee to Sybil," said Luke to the patrico. "Bid her haste hither. Say
  that this maiden&mdash;that Miss Mowbray is here, and requires her aid. Fly!
  I will bear her to the refectory."</p>

  <p>As Balthazar passed the priest, he pointed with a significant glance
  towards a chasm in the wall, which seemed to be an opening to some
  subterraneous chamber. The father again made a gesture of silence, and
  Balthazar hastened upon his mission.</p>

  <p>Luke led them to the refectory. He brought a chair for Eleanor's support;
  but so far from reviving, after such attention as could be afforded her, she
  appeared to become weaker. He was about to issue forth in search of Sybil,
  when to his surprise he found the door fastened.</p>

  <p>"You cannot pass this way," said a voice, which Luke instantly recognized
  as that of the knight of Malta.</p>

  <p>"Not pass!" echoed Luke. "What does this mean?"</p>

  <p>"Our orders are from the queen," returned the knight.</p>

  <p>At this instant the low tone of a muffled bell was heard.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Luke; "some danger is at hand."</p>

  <p>His heart smote him as he thought of Sybil, and he looked anxiously
  towards Eleanor.</p>

  <p>Balthazar rushed into the room.</p>

  <p>"Where is Sybil?" cried Luke. "Will she not come?"</p>

  <p>"She will be here anon," answered the patrico.</p>

  <p>"I will seek her myself, then," said Luke. "The door by which you entered
  is free."</p>

  <p>"It is <i>not</i> free," replied Balthazar. "Remain where you are."</p>

  <p>"Who will prevent my going forth?" demanded Luke, sternly.</p>

  <p>"I will," said Barbara Lovel, as she suddenly appeared in the doorway.
  "You stir not, excepting at my pleasure. Where is the maiden?" continued she,
  looking around with a grim smile of satisfaction at the consternation
  produced by her appearance. "Ha! I see; she faints. Here is a cordial that
  shall revive her. Mrs. Mowbray, you are welcome to the gipsies'
  dwelling&mdash;you and your daughter. And you, Sir Luke Rookwood, I
  congratulate you upon your accession of dignity." Turning to the priest, who
  was evidently overwhelmed with confusion, she exclaimed, "And you too, sir,
  think you I recognize you not? We have met ere this, at Rookwood. Know you
  not Barbara Lovel? Ha, ha! It is long since my poor dwelling has been so
  highly honored. But I must not delay the remedy. Let her drink of this," said
  she, handing a phial to Mrs. Mowbray. "It will instantly restore her."</p>

  <p>"It is poison," cried Luke. "She shall not drink it."</p>

  <p>"Poison!" reiterated Barbara. "Behold!" and she drank of the liquid. "I
  would not poison your bride," added she, turning to Luke.</p>

  <p>"My bride!" echoed Luke.</p>

  <p>"Ay, your bride," repeated Barbara.</p>

  <p>Luke recoiled in amazement. Mrs. Mowbray almost felt inclined to believe
  she was a dreamer, so visionary did the whole scene appear. A dense crowd of
  witnesses stood at the entrance. Foremost amongst them was the sexton.
  Suddenly a shriek was heard, and the crowd opening to allow her passage,
  Sybil rushed forward.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-7"
     name="ch3-7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; MRS. MOWBRAY</h2>

  <p class="quote">Well, go thy ways, old Nick Machiavel, there will never be
  the peer of thee for wholesome policy and good counsel: thou took'st pains to
  chalk men out the dark paths and hidden plots of murther and deceit, and no
  man has the grace to follow thee. The age is unthankful, thy principles are
  quite forsaken, and worn out of memory.<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Shakerley Marmion'</span>s
  <i>Antiquary</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SYBIL'S sudden entrance filled the group that surrounded
  Miss Mowbray with new dismay. But she saw them not. Her soul seemed riveted
  by Eleanor, towards whom she rushed; and while her eye wandered over her
  beauty, she raised the braided hair from her brow, revealing the clear,
  polished forehead. Wonder, awe, devotion, pity, usurped the place of hatred.
  The fierce expression that had lit up her dark orbs was succeeded by tender
  commiseration. She looked an imploring appeal at Barbara.</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," returned the old gipsy, extending at the same time the phial; "I
  understand. Here is that will bring the blood once more into her pallid
  cheeks, and kindle the fire within her eyes. Give her of this."</p>

  <p>The effect of the potion was almost instantaneous, amply attesting
  Barbara's skill in its concoction. Stifled respiration first proclaimed
  Eleanor's recovery. She opened her large and languid eyes; her bosom heaved
  almost to bursting; her pulses throbbed quickly and feverishly; and as the
  stimulant operated, the wild lustre of excitement blazed in her eyes.</p>

  <p>Sybil took her hand to chafe it. The eyes of the two maidens met. They
  gazed upon each other steadfastly and in silence. Eleanor knew not whom she
  regarded, but she could not mistake that look of sympathy; she could not
  mistake the tremulous pressure of her hand; she felt the silent trickling
  tears. She returned the sympathizing glance, and gazed with equal wonder upon
  the ministering fairy, for such she almost seemed, that knelt before her. As
  her looks wandered from the kindly glance of Sybil to the withered and
  inauspicious aspect of the gipsy queen, and shifted thence to the dusky
  figures of her attendants, filled with renewed apprehension, she exclaimed,
  "Who are these, and where am I?"</p>

  <p>"You are in safety," replied Luke. "This is the ruined priory of St.
  Francis; and those strange personages are a horde of gipsies. You need fear
  no injury from them."</p>

  <p>"My deliverer!" murmured Eleanor; when all at once the recollection that
  he had avowed himself a Rookwood, and the elder brother of Ranulph, flashed
  across her memory. "Gipsies! did you not say these people were gipsies? Your
  own attire is the same as theirs. You are not, cannot be, the brother of
  Ranulph."</p>

  <p>"I do not boast the same mother," returned Luke, proudly, "but my father
  was Sir Piers Rookwood, and I am his elder born."</p>

  <p>He turned away. Dark thoughts swept across his brain. Maddened by the
  beauty of Eleanor, stung by her slights, and insensible to the silent agony
  of Sybil, who sought in vain to catch his eye, he thought of nothing but of
  revenge, and the accomplishment of his purposes. All within was a wild and
  fearful turmoil. His better principles were stifled by the promptings of
  evil. "Methinks," cried he, half aloud, "if the Tempter were near to offer
  the maiden to me, even at the peril of my soul's welfare, I could not resist
  it."</p>

  <p>The Tempter <i>was</i> at hand. He is seldom absent on occasions like the
  present. The sexton stood beside his grandson. Luke started. He eyed Peter
  from head to foot, almost expecting to find the cloven foot, supposed to be
  proper to the fiend. Peter grinned in ghastly derision.</p>

  <p>"Soh! you would summon hell to your aid; and lo! the devil is at your
  elbow. Well, she is yours."</p>

  <p>"Make good your words," cried Luke, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Softly&mdash;softly," returned Peter. "Moderate yourself, and your wishes
  shall be accomplished. Your own desires chime with those of others; nay, with
  those of Barbara. <i>She</i> would wed you to Miss Mowbray. You stare. But it
  is so. This is a cover for some deeper plot; no matter. It shall go hard,
  despite her cunning, if I foil her not at her own weapons. There is more
  mischief in that old woman's brain than was ever hatched within the
  crocodile's egg; yet she shall find her match. Do not thwart her; leave all
  to me. She is about it now," added he, noticing Barbara and Mrs. Mowbray in
  conference together. "Be patient&mdash;I will watch her." And he quitted his
  grandson for the purpose of scanning more closely the manoeuvres of the old
  gipsy.</p>

  <p>Barbara, meanwhile, had not remained inactive.</p>

  <p>"You need fear no relapse in your daughter; I will answer for that," said
  the old gipsy to Mrs. Mowbray; "Sybil will tend her. Quit not the maiden's
  side," continued she, addressing her grandchild, adding, in a whisper, "Be
  cautious&mdash;alarm her not&mdash;mine eye will be upon you&mdash;drop not a
  word."</p>

  <p>So saying, she shuffled to a little distance with Mrs. Mowbray, keeping
  Sybil in view, and watching every motion, as the panther watches the gambols
  of a fawn.</p>

  <p>"Know you who speaks to you?" said the old crone, in the peculiar low and
  confidential tone assumed by her tribe to strangers. "Have you forgotten the
  name of Barbara Lovel?"</p>

  <p>"I have no distinct remembrance of it," returned Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"Think again," said Barbara; "and though years are flown, you may
  perchance recall the black gipsy woman, who, when you were surrounded with
  gay gallants, with dancing plumes, perused your palm, and whispered in your
  ear the favored suitor's name. Bide with me a moment, madam," said Barbara,
  seeing that Mrs. Mowbray shrank from the recollection thus conjured up; "I am
  old&mdash;very old; I have survived the shows of flattery, and being vested
  with a power over my people, am apt, perchance, to take too much upon myself
  with others." The old gipsy paused here, and then, assuming a more familiar
  tone, exclaimed, "The estates of Rookwood are ample&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Woman, what mean you?"</p>

  <p>"They should have been yours, lady, and would have been, but for that
  marriage. You would have beseemed them bravely. Sir Reginald was wilful, and
  erased the daughter's name to substitute that of his son. Pity it is that so
  fair a creature as Miss Mowbray should lack the dower her beauty and her
  birth entitle her to expect. Pity that Ranulph Rookwood should lose his
  title, at the moment when he deemed it was dropping into his possession. Pity
  that those broad lands should pass away from you and your children, as they
  will do, if Ranulph and Eleanor are united."</p>

  <p>"They never shall be united," replied Mrs. Mowbray, hastily.</p>

  <p>"'Twere indeed to wed your child to beggary," said Barbara.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray sighed deeply.</p>

  <p>"There is a way," continued the old crone, in a deep whisper, "by which
  the estates might still be hers and yours."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Mrs. Mowbray, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Sir Piers Rookwood had two sons."</p>

  <p>"Ha!"</p>

  <p>"The elder is here."</p>

  <p>"Luke&mdash;Sir Luke. He brought us hither."</p>

  <p>"He loves your daughter. I saw his gaze of passion just now. I am old now,
  but I have some skill in lovers' glances. Why not wed her to him? I read
  hands&mdash;read hearts, you know. They were born for each other. Now, madam,
  do you understand me?"</p>

  <p>"But," returned Mrs. Mowbray, with hesitation, "though I might wish
  for&mdash;though I might sanction this, Eleanor is betrothed to
  Ranulph&mdash;she loves him."</p>

  <p>"Think not of <i>her</i>, if <i>you</i> are satisfied. She cannot judge so
  well for herself as you can for her. She is a child, and knows not what she
  loves. Her affection will soon be Luke's. He is a noble youth&mdash;the image
  of his grandfather, your father, Sir Reginald; and if your daughter be
  betrothed to any one, 'twas to the heir of Rookwood. That was an essential
  part of the contract. Why should the marriage not take place at once, and
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Here! How were that possible?"</p>

  <p>"You are within sacred walls. I will take you where an altar stands. There
  is no lack of holy priest to join their hands together. Your companion,
  Father Ambrose, as you call him, will do the office fittingly. He has essayed
  his clerkly skill already on others of your house."</p>

  <p>"To what do you allude, mysterious woman?" asked Mrs. Mowbray, with
  anxiety.</p>

  <p>"To Sir Piers and Susan Bradley," returned Barbara. "That priest united
  them."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! He never told me this."</p>

  <p>"He dared not do so; he had an oath which bound him to concealment. The
  time is coming when greater mysteries will be revealed."</p>

  <p>"'Tis strange I should not have heard of this before," said Mrs. Mowbray,
  musingly; "and yet I might have guessed as much from his obscure hints
  respecting Ranulph. I see it all now. I see the gulf into which I might have
  been plunged; but I am warned in time. Father Ambrose," continued she, to the
  priest, who was pacing the chamber at some little distance from them, "is it
  true that my brother was wedded by you to Susan Bradley?"</p>

  <p>Ere the priest could reply the sexton presented himself.</p>

  <p>"Ha, the very father of the girl!" said Mrs. Mowbray, "whom I met within
  our family vault, and who was so strangely moved when I spoke to him of Alan
  Rookwood. Is he here likewise?"</p>

  <p>"Alan Rookwood!" echoed Barbara, upon whom a light seemed suddenly to
  break; "ha! what said he of him?"</p>

  <p>"Ill-boding raven," interposed Peter, fiercely, "be content with what thou
  knowest of the living, and trouble not the repose of the dead. Let them rest
  in their infamy."</p>

  <p>"The dead!" echoed Barbara, with a chuckling laugh; "ha! ha! he is dead,
  then; and what became of his fair wife&mdash;his brother's minion? 'Twas a
  foul deed, I grant, and yet there was expiation. Blood
  flowed&mdash;blood&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Silence, thou night hag!" thundered Peter, "or I will have thee burned at
  the stake for the sorcery thou practisest. Beware," added he, in a deep
  tone&mdash;"I am thy friend."</p>

  <p>Barbara's withered countenance exhibited for an instant the deepest
  indignation at the sexton's threat. The malediction trembled on her tongue;
  she raised her staff to smite him, but she checked the action. In the same
  tone, and with a sharp, suspicious look, she replied, "My <i>friend</i>,
  sayest thou? See that it prove so, or beware of <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>And, with a malignant scowl, the gipsy queen slowly shuffled towards her
  satellites, who were stationed at the door.</p>

  <p class="first">ELEANOR MOWBRAY had witnessed her mother's withdrawal from
  her side with much uneasiness, and was with difficulty prevented by Sybil
  from breaking upon her conference with the gipsy queen. Barbara's dark eye
  was fixed upon them during the whole of the interview, and communicated an
  indefinite sense of dread to Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;who is that old woman?" asked Eleanor, under her breath.
  "Never, even in my wildest dreams, have I seen aught so terrible. Why does
  she look so at us? She terrifies me; and yet she cannot mean me ill, or my
  mother&mdash;we have never injured her?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" sighed Sybil.</p>

  <p>"You sigh!" exclaimed Eleanor, in alarm. "Is there any real danger, then?
  Help us to avoid it. Quick, warn my mother; she seems agitated. Oh, let me go
  to her."</p>

  <p>"Hush!" whispered Sybil, maintaining an unmoved demeanor under the
  lynx-like gaze of Barbara. "Stir not, as you value your life; you know not
  where you are, or what may befall you. Your safety depends upon your
  composure. Your life is not in danger; but what is dearer than life, your
  love, is threatened with a fatal blow. There is a dark design to wed you to
  another."</p>

  <p>"Heavens!" ejaculated Eleanor, "and to whom?"</p>

  <p>"To Sir Luke Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"I would die sooner! Marry <i>him</i>? They shall kill me ere they force
  me to it!"</p>

  <p>"Could you not love him?"</p>

  <p>"Love him! I have only seen him within this hour. I knew not of his
  existence. He rescued me from peril. I would thank him. I would love him, if
  I could, for Ranulph's sake; and yet for Ranulph's sake I hate him."</p>

  <p>"Speak not of him thus to me," said Sybil, angrily. "If <i>you</i> love
  him not, <i>I</i> love him. Oh! forgive me, lady; pardon my
  impatience&mdash;my heart is breaking, yet it has not ceased to beat for him.
  You say you will die sooner than consent to this forced union. Your faith
  shall not be so cruelly attested. If there must be a victim, I will be the
  sacrifice. God grant I may be the only one. Be happy! as happy as I am
  wretched. You shall see what the love of a gipsy can do."</p>

  <p>As she spoke, Sybil burst into a flood of passionate tears. Eleanor
  regarded her with the deepest commiseration; but the feeling was transient;
  for Barbara, now advancing, exclaimed: "Hence to your mother. The bridegroom
  is waiting: to your mother, girl!" And she motioned Eleanor fiercely away.
  "What means this?" continued the old gipsy. "What have you said to that girl?
  Did I not caution you against speech with her? and you have dared to disobey
  me. You, my grandchild&mdash;the daughter of my Agatha, with whom my
  slightest wish was law. I abandon you! I curse you!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, curse me not!" cried Sybil. "Add not to my despair."</p>

  <p>"Then follow my advice implicitly. Cast off this weakness; all is in
  readiness. Luke shall descend into the vaulted chapel, the ceremony shall
  there take place&mdash;there also shall Eleanor <i>die</i>&mdash;and there
  again shall you be wedded. Take this phial, place it within the folds of your
  girdle. When all is over, I will tell you how to use it. Are you prepared?
  Shall we set out?"</p>

  <p>"I am prepared," replied Sybil, in accents hollow as despair; "but let me
  speak with Luke before we go."</p>

  <p>"Be brief, then&mdash;each moment is precious. Keep a guard upon your
  tongue. I will to Mrs. Mowbray. You have placed the phial in safety. A drop
  will free you from your troubles."</p>

  <p>"'Tis in that hope I guard it," replied Sybil, as she departed in the
  direction of Luke. Barbara watched her join him, and then turned shortly
  towards Mrs. Mowbray and her daughter.</p>

  <p>"You are ill, dear Luke," said Sybil, who had silently approached her
  faithless lover; "very ill."</p>

  <p>"Ill!" echoed Luke, breaking into frantic laughter. "Ill! Ha,
  ha!&mdash;upon my wedding-day. No, I am well&mdash;well. Your eyes are
  jaundiced by jealousy."</p>

  <p>"Luke, dear Luke, laugh not thus. It terrifies me. I shall think you
  insane. There, you are calmer&mdash;you are more like yourself&mdash;more
  human. You looked just now&mdash;oh God! that I should say it of you&mdash;as
  if you were possessed by demons."</p>

  <p>"And if I were possessed, what then?"</p>

  <p>"Horrible! hint not at it. You almost make me credit the dreadful tales I
  have heard, that on their wedding-day the Rookwoods are subject to the power
  of the 'Evil One.'"</p>

  <p>"Upon their wedding-day&mdash;and <i>I</i> look thus?"</p>

  <p>"You do&mdash;you do. Oh! cast this frenzy from you."</p>

  <p>"She is mine&mdash;she is mine! I care not though fiends possess me, if it
  is my wedding-day, and Eleanor is my bride. And you say I look like a
  Rookwood. Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"That wild laughter again. Luke, I implore you, hear me one word&mdash;my
  last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will not bear reproaches."</p>

  <p>"I mean not to reproach you. I come to bless you&mdash;to forgive
  you&mdash;to bid you farewell. Will you not say farewell?"</p>

  <p>"Farewell."</p>

  <p>"Not so&mdash;not so. Mercy! my God! compassionate him and me! My heart
  will break with agony. Luke, if you would not kill me, recall that word. Let
  not the guilt of my death be yours. 'Tis to save you from that remorse that I
  die!"</p>

  <p>"Sybil, you have said rightly, I am not myself. I know not what demons
  have possession of my soul, that I can behold your agonies without remorse;
  that your matchless affection should awaken no return. Yet so it is. Since
  the fatal moment when I beheld yon maid, I have loved her."</p>

  <p>"No more. <i>Now</i> I can part with you. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Stay, stay! wretch that I am. Stay, Sybil! If we must part&mdash;and that
  it <i>must</i> be so I feel&mdash;let me receive your pardon, if you can
  bestow it. Let me clasp you once more within my arms. May you live to happier
  days&mdash;may you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, to die thus!" sobbed Sybil, disengaging herself from his embrace.
  "Live to happier days, said you? When have <i>I</i> given you reason to
  doubt, for an instant, the sincerity of <i>my</i> love, that you should
  insult me thus?"</p>

  <p>"Then live with me&mdash;live for me."</p>

  <p>"If you can love me still, I will live as your slave, your minion, your
  wife; aught you will have me be. You have raised me from wretchedness. Oh!"
  continued she in an altered tone, "have I mistaken your meaning? Did you
  utter those words in false compassion for my sufferings?&mdash;Speak, it is
  not yet too late&mdash;all may be well. My fate&mdash;my life is in your
  hands. If you love me yet&mdash;if you can forsake Eleanor, speak&mdash;if
  not, be silent."</p>

  <p>Luke averted his head.</p>

  <p>"Enough!" continued Sybil, in a voice of agony; "I understand. May God
  forgive you! Fare you well! We shall meet no more."</p>

  <p>"Do we part for ever?" asked Luke, without daring to regard her.</p>

  <p>"FOR EVER!" answered Sybil.</p>

  <p>Before her lover could reply, she shot from his side, and plunging amidst
  the dark and dense assemblage near the door, disappeared from view. An
  instant after, she emerged into the open air. She stood within the roofless
  hall. It was filled with sunshine&mdash;with the fresh breath of morn. The
  ivied ruins, the grassy floor, the blue vault of heaven, seemed to greet her
  with a benignant smile. All was <i>riant</i> and rejoicing&mdash;all, save
  her heart. Amid such brightness, her sorrow seemed harsh and unnatural; as
  she felt the glad influence of day, she was scarcely able to refrain from
  tears. It was terrible to leave this beautiful world, that blue sky, that
  sunshine, and all she loved&mdash;so young, so soon.</p>

  <p>Entering a low arch that yawned within the wall, she vanished like a ghost
  at the approach of morn.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%"><span class="smcap">Shakspeare:</span>
     <i>Othello</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">TO return to Eleanor Mowbray. In a state of mind bordering
  upon distraction, she rushed to her mother, and, flinging her arms wildly
  round her neck, besought her to protect her. Mrs. Mowbray gazed anxiously
  upon the altered countenance of her daughter, but a few moments relieved her
  from much of her uneasiness.&mdash;The expression of pain gradually subsided,
  and the look of vacuity was succeeded by one of frenzied excitement. A film
  had, for an instant or two, dimmed her eyes; they now gleamed with unnatural
  lustre. She smiled&mdash;the smile was singular; it was not the playful,
  pleasurable lighting up of the face that it used to be; but it <i>was</i> a
  smile, and the mother's heart was satisfied.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray knew not to what circumstance she could attribute this
  wondrous change. She looked at the priest. He was more apt in divining the
  probable cause of the sudden alteration in Eleanor's manner.</p>

  <p>"What if she has swallowed a love-powder?" said he, approaching Mrs.
  Mowbray, and speaking in a whisper. "I have heard of such abominable
  mixtures; indeed, the holy St. Jerome himself relates an instance of similar
  sorcery, in his life of Hilarius; and these people are said to compound
  them."</p>

  <p>"It may be so," replied Mrs. Mowbray, in the same tone. "I think that the
  peculiar softness in the eye is more than natural."</p>

  <p>"I will at least hazard an experiment, to attest the truth or fallacy of
  my supposition," returned the father. "Do you see your destined bridegroom
  yonder?" continued he, addressing Eleanor.</p>

  <p>She followed with her eyes in the direction which Father Ambrose pointed.
  She beheld Luke. We know not how to describe the sensations which now
  possessed her. She thought not of Ranulph; or, if she did, it was with vague
  indifference. Wrapped in a kind of mental trance, she yielded to the
  pleasurable impulse that directed her unsettled fancies towards Luke. For
  some moments she did not take her eyes from him. The priest and Mrs. Mowbray
  watched her in silence.</p>

  <p>Nothing passed between the party till Luke joined them. Eleanor continued
  gazing at him, and the seeming tenderness of her glance emboldened Luke to
  advance towards her. The soft fire that dwelt in those orbs was, however,
  cold as the shining wing of the luciola.</p>

  <p>Luke approached her; he took her hand&mdash;she withdrew it not. He kissed
  it. Still she withdrew it not, but gazed at him with gently-glimmering
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"My daughter is yours, Sir Luke Rookwood," exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"What says the maid herself?" asked Luke.</p>

  <p>Eleanor answered not. Her eyes were still fixed on him.</p>

  <p>"She will not refuse me her hand," said Luke.</p>

  <p>The victim resisted not.</p>

  <p>"To the subterranean shrine," cried Barbara. And she gave the preconcerted
  signal to the band.</p>

  <p>The signal was repeated by the gipsy crew. We may here casually note, that
  the crew had been by no means uninterested or silent spectators of passing
  events, but had, on the contrary, indulged themselves in a variety of
  conjectures as to their probable issue. Several bets were pending as to
  whether it would be a match or not after all. Zoroaster took long odds that
  the match was off&mdash;offering a <i>bean</i> to <i>half-a-quid</i>&mdash;in
  other words, a guinea to a half-guinea&mdash;that Sybil would be the bride.
  His offer was taken at once by Jerry Juniper, and backed by the knight of
  Malta.</p>

  <p>"Ha! there's the signal," cried the knight; "I'll trouble you for the
  bean."</p>

  <p>"And I," added Jerry Juniper, "for another."</p>

  <p>"See 'em fairly spliced first," replied the Magus; "that's vot I
  betted."</p>

  <p>"Vell, vell, a few minutes will settle that. Come, pals, to the autem ken.
  Avay. Mind and obey orders."</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay," answered the crew.</p>

  <p>"Here's a torch for the altar of Hymen," said the knight, flashing his
  torch in the eyes of the patrico as he passed him.</p>

  <p>"For the halter of Haman, you might say," returned Balthazar, sulkily.
  "It's well if some of us don't swing for it."</p>

  <p>"You don't say," rejoined the perplexed Magus, "swing! Egad I fear it's a
  ticklish business. But there's no fighting shy, I fear, with Barbara present;
  and then there's that infernal autem-bawler; it will be so cursedly regular.
  If you had done the job, Balty, it would not have signified a brass farden.
  Luckily there will be no vitnesses to snitch upon us. There will be no one in
  the vault besides ourselves."</p>

  <p>"There will be a silent and a solemn witness," returned Balthazar, "and
  one whom you expect not."</p>

  <p>"Eh! Vot's that you say? a spy?"</p>

  <p>But the patrico was gone.</p>

  <p>"Make way there&mdash;make way, pals, for the bride and bridegroom," cried
  the knight of Malta, drawing Excalibur, and preparing to lead the way to the
  vault.</p>

  <p>The train began to move. Eleanor leaned upon the arm of her mother. Beside
  them stalked Barbara, with an aspect of triumph. Luke followed with the
  priest. One by one the assemblage quitted the apartment.</p>

  <p>The sexton alone lingered. "The moment is at hand," said he, musingly,
  "when all shall be consummated."</p>

  <p>A few steps brought him into the court. The crowd was there still. A brief
  delay had taken place. The knight of Malta then entered the mouth of the
  vault. He held his torch so as to reveal a broken flight of steps,
  conducting, it would seem, to regions of perpetual night. So thought Eleanor,
  as she shudderingly gazed into the abyss. She hesitated; she trembled; she
  refused. But her mother's entreaties, and Barbara's threatening looks,
  induced, in the end, reluctant compliance. At length the place was empty.
  Peter was about to follow, when the sound of a horse's hoofs broke upon his
  ear. He tarried for an instant, and the mounted figure of the highwayman
  burst within the limits of the court.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha! old earthworm," cried Dick, "my Nestor of the churchyard, alone!
  Where the devil are all the folks gone? Where's Sir Luke and his new-found
  cousin, eh?"</p>

  <p>Peter hastily explained.</p>

  <p>"A wedding under ground? famous! the thing of all others I should like to
  see. I'll hang Bess to this ivy tod, and grub my way with you thither, old
  mole."</p>

  <p>"You must stay here, and keep guard," returned Peter.</p>

  <p>"May I be hanged if I do, when such fun is going on."</p>

  <p>"Hanged, in all probability, you will be," returned Peter; "but I should
  not, were I you, desire to anticipate my destiny. Stay here you must, and
  shall&mdash;that's peremptory. You will be the gainer by it. Sir Luke will
  reward you nobly. I will answer for him. You can serve him most effectually.
  Ranulph Rookwood and Major Mowbray are expected here."</p>

  <p>"The devil they are. But how, or why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have not time to explain. In case of a surprise, discharge a pistol;
  they must not enter the vault. Have you a whistle? for you must play a double
  part, and we may need your assistance below."</p>

  <p>"Sir Luke may command me. Here's a pipe as shrill as the devil's own
  cat-call."</p>

  <p>"If it will summon you to our assistance below, 'tis all I need. May we
  rely on you?"</p>

  <p>"When did Dick Turpin desert his friends? Anywhere on this side the Styx
  the sound of that whistle will reach me. I'll ride about the court, and stand
  sentry."</p>

  <p>"Enough," replied the sexton, as he dived under ground.</p>

  <p>"Take care of your shins," shouted Dick. "That's a cursed ugly turn, but
  he's used to the dark. A surprise, eh! I'll just give a look to my
  snappers&mdash;flints all safe. Now I'm ready for them, come when they like."
  And, having made the circuit of the place, he halted near the mouth of the
  subterranean chapel, to be within hearing of Peter's whistle, and, throwing
  his right leg lazily over his saddle, proceeded coolly to light a short
  pipe&mdash;the luxury of the cigar being then unknown,&mdash;humming the
  while snatches of a ballad, the theme of which was his own calling.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-10"
     name="ch3-10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; SAINT CYPRIAN'S CELL</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch' entrate. &mdash;
     <span class="smcap">Dante</span>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">CYPRIAN DE MULVERTON, fifth prior of the monastery of Saint
  Francis, a prelate of singular sanctity, being afflicted, in his latter days,
  with a despondency so deep that neither penance nor fasting could remove it,
  vowed never again to behold, with earthly eyes, the blessed light of heaven,
  nor to dwell longer with his fellowmen; but, relinquishing his spiritual
  dignity, "the world forgetting, by the world forgot," to immure himself,
  while living, within the tomb.</p>

  <p>He kept his vow. Out of the living rock that sustained the saintly
  structure, beneath the chapel of the monastery, was another chapel wrought,
  and thither, after bidding an eternal farewell to the world, and bestowing
  his benediction upon his flock, whom he committed to the care of his
  successor, the holy man retired.</p>

  <p>Never, save at midnight, and then only during the performance of masses
  for his soul's repose, did he ascend from his cell: and as the sole light
  allowed within the dismal dungeon of his choice was that of a sepulchral
  lamp, as none spoke with him when in his retreat, save in muttered syllables,
  what effect must the lustre emanating from a thousand tapers, the warm and
  pungent odors of the incense-breathing shrine, contrasted with the earthy
  vapors of his prison-house, and the solemn swell of the Sanctus, have had
  upon his excited senses? Surely they must have seemed like a foretaste of the
  heaven he sought to gain!</p>

  <p>Ascetic to the severest point to which nature's endurance could be
  stretched, Cyprian even denied himself repose. He sought not sleep, and knew
  it only when it stole on him unawares. His couch was the flinty rock; and
  long afterwards, when the zealous resorted to the sainted prior's cell, and
  were shown those sharp and jagged stones, they marvelled how one like unto
  themselves could rest, or even recline upon their points without anguish,
  until it was explained to them that, doubtless, He who tempereth the wind to
  the shorn lamb had made that flinty couch soft to the holy sufferer as a bed
  of down. His limbs were clothed in a garb of horsehair of the coarsest
  fabric; his drink was the dank drops that oozed from the porous walls of his
  cell; and his sustenance, such morsels as were bestowed upon him by the
  poor&mdash;the only strangers permitted to approach him. No fire was
  suffered, where perpetual winter reigned. None were admitted to his nightly
  vigils; none witnessed any act of penance; nor were any groans heard to issue
  from that dreary cave; but the knotted, blood-stained thong, discovered near
  his couch, too plainly betrayed in what manner those long lone nights were
  spent. Thus did a year roll on. Traces of his sufferings were visible in his
  failing strength. He could scarcely crawl; but he meekly declined assistance.
  He appeared not, as had been his wont, at the midnight mass; the door of his
  cell was thrown open at that hour; the light streamed down like a glory upon
  his reverend head; he heard the distant reverberations of the deep
  <i>Miserere</i>; and breathed odors as if wafted from Paradise.</p>

  <p>One morn it chanced that they who sought his cell found him with his head
  upon his bosom, kneeling before the image of the virgin patroness of his
  shrine. Fearing to disturb his devotions, they stood reverently looking on;
  and thus silently did they tarry for an hour; but, as in that space he had
  shown no signs of motion, fearing the worst, they ventured to approach him.
  He was cold as the marble before which he knelt. In the act of humblest
  intercession&mdash;it may be, in the hope of grace&mdash;had Cyprian's spirit
  fled.</p>

  <p>"Blessed are they who die in the Lord," exclaimed his brethren, regarding
  his remains with deepest awe. On being touched, the body fell to the ground.
  It was little more than a skeleton.</p>

  <p>Under the cloisters of the holy pile were his bones interred, with a
  degree of pomp and ostentation that little accorded with the lowliness and
  self-abasement of this man of many sorrows.</p>

  <p>This chapel, at the time of which we treat, was pretty much in the same
  condition as it existed in the days of its holy inmate. Hewn out of the
  entrails of the rock, the roof, the vaults, the floor, were of solid granite.
  Three huge cylindrical pillars, carved out of the native rock, rough as the
  stems of gnarled oak-trees, lent support to the ceiling. Support, however,
  was unneeded; an earthquake would scarce have shaken down those solid
  rafters. Only in one corner, where the water welled through a crevice of the
  rock, in drops that fell like tears, was decay manifest. Here the stone, worn
  by the constant dripping, had, in some places, given way. In shape, the vault
  was circular. The integral between each massive pillar formed a pointed arch.
  Again, from each pillar sprang other arches, which, crossed by diagonal,
  ogive branches, weaving one into the other, and radiating from the centre,
  formed those beautifully intricate combinations upon which the eye of the
  architectural enthusiast loves to linger. Within the ring formed by these
  triple columns, in which again the pillars had their own web of arches, was
  placed an altar of stone, and beside it a crucifix of the same rude material.
  Here also stood the sainted image of her who had filled the prior with holy
  aspirations, now a shapeless stone. The dim lamp, that, like a star
  struggling with the thick gloom of a wintry cell, had shed its slender
  radiance over the brow of the Virgin Thecla, was gone. But around the
  keystone of the central arches, whence a chain had once depended, might be
  traced in ancient characters, half effaced by time, the inscription:</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">Sta. Thecla ora pro nobis.</p><br>

  <p>One outlet only was there from the chapel&mdash;that which led by winding
  steps to the monastery; one only recess&mdash;the prior's cell. The former
  faced the altar; the latter yawned like the mouth of a tomb at its back.
  Altogether it was a dreary place. Dumb were its walls as when they refused to
  return the murmured orisons of the anchorite. One uniform sad coloring
  prevailed throughout. The gray granite was grown hoar with age, and had a
  ghostly look; the columns were ponderous, and projected heavy shadows. Sorrow
  and superstition had their tale, and a moral gloom deepened the darkness of
  the spot. Despair, which had inspired its construction, seemed to brood
  therein. Hope shunned its inexorable recesses.</p>

  <p>Alone, within this dismal sanctuary, with hands outstretched towards the
  desecrated image of its tutelar saint, knelt Sybil. All was darkness. Neither
  the heavy vapors that surrounded her, nor the shrine before which she bent,
  were visible; but, familiar with the dreary spot, she knew that she had
  placed herself aright. Her touch had satisfied her that she bowed before the
  altar of stone; that her benighted vision was turned towards the broken image
  of the saint, though now involved in gloom the most profound; and with
  clasped hands and streaming eyes, in low and mournful tones, she addressed
  herself in the following hymn to the tutelar saint of the spot:</p>

  <h3>HYMN TO SAINT THECLA</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">In my trouble, in my anguish,<br>

     style="margin-left:40%">By thy loveliness, thy purity,<br>

  Let thy countenance incline!<br>
  <i>Ora pro me mortis hora!<br>
  Sancta Virgo, oro te!<br>
  Kyrie Eleison!</i></p><br>

  <p>The sweet, sad voice of the singer died faintly away. The sharpness of her
  sorrow was assuaged. Seldom, indeed, is it that fervent supplication fails to
  call down solace to the afflicted. Sybil became more composed. She still,
  however, trembled at the thoughts of what remained to be done.</p>

  <p>"They will be here ere my prayer is finished," murmured she&mdash;"ere the
  end is accomplished for which I came hither alone. Let me, oh! let me make my
  peace with my Creator, ere I surrender my being to His hands, and then let
  them deal with me as they will." And she bowed her head in lowly prayer.</p>

  <p>Again raising her hands, and casting her eyes towards the black ceiling,
  she implored, in song, the intercession of the saintly man who had bequeathed
  his name to the cell.</p>

  <h3>HYMN TO SAINT CYPRIAN</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">Hear! oh! hear me, sufferer holy,<br>
  Who didst make thine habitation<br>

  Didst deliver thee. Oh! hear me!<br>
  In my dying moments cheer me.<br>
  By thy penance, self-denial,<br>

  And His gift unto the Giver<br>
  May be rendered pure as ever!<br>
  By thy own dark, dread possession,<br>
  Aid me with thine intercession!</p><br>

  <p>Scarcely had she concluded this hymn, when the torch of the knight of
  Malta in part dissipated the gloom that hung around the chapel.</p>

  <p class="first">SLOWLY did the train descend; solemnly and in silence, as if
  the rites at which they were about to assist had been those of funereal, and
  not of nuptial, solemnization. Indeed, to look upon those wild and fierce
  faces by the ruddily-flashing torchlight, which lent to each a stern and
  savage expression; to see those scowling visages surrounding a bride from
  whose pallid cheeks every vestige of color, and almost of animation, had
  fled; and a bridegroom, with a countenance yet more haggard, and demeanor yet
  more distracted&mdash;the beholder must have imagined that the spectacle was
  some horrible ceremonial, practised by demons rather than human beings. The
  arched vault, the pillars, the torchlight, the deep shadows, and the wild
  figures, formed a picture worthy of Rembrandt or Salvator.</p>

  <p>"Is Sybil within the chapel?" asked Barbara.</p>

  <p>"I am here," returned a voice from the altar.</p>

  <p>"Why do we tarry?" said the gipsy queen. "We are all assembled. To the
  altar."</p>

  <p>"To the altar!" shrieked Eleanor. "Oh! no&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Remember my threat, and obey," muttered Barbara. "You are in my power
  now."</p>

  <p>A convulsive sob was all the answer Eleanor could make.</p>

  <p>"Our number is not complete," said the priest, who had looked in vain for
  the sexton. "Peter Bradley is not with us."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Barbara. "Let him be sought for instantly."</p>

  <p>"Their search need not extend beyond this spot," said Peter, stepping
  forward.</p>

  <p>The knight of Malta advanced towards the altar. The torchlight reddened
  upon the huge stone pillars. It fell upon the shrine, and upon the ghastly
  countenance of Sybil, who stood beside it. Suddenly, as the light approached
  her, an object, hitherto hidden from view, was revealed. Sybil uttered a
  prolonged and fearful shriek; the knight recoiled likewise in horror; and a
  simultaneous cry of astonishment burst from the lips of the foremost of the
  group. All crowded forwards, and universal consternation prevailed amongst
  the assemblage. Each one gazed at his neighbor, anxious to learn the occasion
  of this tumult, and vague fears were communicated to those behind, from the
  terrified glances, which were the only answers returned by their comrades in
  front.</p>

  <p>"Who has dared to bring that body here?" demanded Barbara, in a tone in
  which anger struggled with apprehension, pointing at the same time to the
  ghastly corpse of a female, with streaming hair, at the altar's feet. "Who
  has dared to do this, I say? Quick! remove it. What do you stare at? Cravens!
  is this the first time you have looked upon a corpse, that you should shrink
  aghast&mdash;that you tremble before it? It is a clod&mdash;ay, less than a
  clod. Away with it! away, I say."</p>

  <p>"Touch it not," cried Luke, lifting a cloud of black hair from off the
  features; "it is my mother's body."</p>

  <p>"My daughter!" exclaimed the sexton.</p>

  <p>"What!" vociferated Barbara, "is that your daughter&mdash;is that the
  first Lady Rookwood? Are the dead arisen to do honor to these nuptials?
  Speak! you can, perchance, explain how she came hither."</p>

  <p>"I know not," returned Peter, glancing fiercely at Barbara; "I may, anon,
  demand that question of you. How came this body here?"</p>

  <p>"Ask of Richard Checkley," said Barbara, turning to the priest. "He can,
  perchance, inform you. Priest," added she, in a low voice, "this is your
  handiwork."</p>

  <p>"Checkley!" screamed Peter. "Is that Richard Checkley? is
  that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Peace!" thundered Barbara; "will none remove the body? Once more I ask
  you, do you fear the dead?"</p>

  <p>A murmur arose. Balthazar alone ventured to approach the corpse.</p>

  <p>Luke started to his feet as he advanced, his eyes glaring with tiger
  fury.</p>

  <p>"Back, old man," cried he, "and dare not, any of you, to lay a
  sacrilegious finger on her corse, or I will stretch him that advances as
  lowly as lies my mother's head. When or how it came hither matters not. Here,
  at the altar, has it been placed, and none shall move it hence. The dead
  shall witness my nuptials. Fate has ordained it&mdash;<i>my</i> fate! o'er
  which the dead preside. Her ring shall link me to my bride. I knew not, when
  I snatched it from her death-cold finger, to what end I preserved it. I learn
  it now. It is here." And he held forth a ring.</p>

  <p>"'Tis a fatal boon, that twice-used ring," cried Sybil; "such a ring my
  mother, on her death-bed, said should be mine. Such a ring she said should
  wed me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Unto whom?" fiercely demanded Luke.</p>

  <p>"UNTO DEATH!" she solemnly rejoined.</p>

  <p>Luke's countenance fell. He turned aside, deeply abashed, unable further
  to brook her gaze; while in accents of such wildly touching pathos as sank
  into the hearts of each who heard her&mdash;hearts, few of them framed of
  penetrable stuff&mdash;the despairing maiden burst into the following
  strain:</p>

  <h3>THE TWICE-USED RING</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">"Beware thy bridal day!"<br>
  On her death-bed sighed my mother;<br>
  "Beware, beware, I say,<br>
  Death shall wed thee, and no other.<br>
  Cold the hand shall grasp thee,<br>
  Cold the arms shall clasp thee,<br>
  Colder lips thy kiss shall smother!<br>
  Beware thy bridal kiss!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">"Thy wedding ring shall be<br>
  From a clay-cold finger taken;<br>
  From one that, like to thee,<br>
  Was by her love forsaken.<br>
  For a twice-used ring<br>
  Is a fatal thing;<br>
  Her griefs who wore it are partaken&mdash;,<br>
  Beware that fatal ring!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">"The altar and the grave<br>
  Many steps are not asunder;<br>
  Bright banners o'er thee wave,<br>
  Shrouded horror lieth under.<br>
  Blithe may sound the bell,<br>
  Yet 'twill toll thy knell;<br>
  Scathed thy chaplet by the thunder&mdash;<br>
  Beware that blighted wreath!"</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:40%">Beware my bridal day!<br>
  Dying lips my doom have spoken;<br>
  Deep tones call me away;<br>
  From the grave is sent a token.<br>
  Cold, cold fingers bring<br>
  That ill-omen'd ring;<br>
  Soon will a <i>second</i> heart be broken;<br>
  <i>This</i> is my bridal day.</p><br>

  <p>There was a deep, profound silence as the last melancholy cadence died
  away, and many a rugged heart was melted, even to tears. Eleanor, meanwhile,
  remained in a state of passive stupefaction, vacantly gazing at Sybil, upon
  whom alone her eyes were fixed, and appearing indistinctly to apprehend the
  meaning of her song.</p>

  <p>"This is my bridal day," murmured she, in a low tone, when Sybil had
  finished. "Said not that sweet voice so? I know 'tis my bridal day. What a
  church you have chosen, mother! A tomb&mdash;a sepulchre&mdash;but 'tis meet
  for such nuptials as mine&mdash;and what wedding guests! Was that pale woman
  in her shroud-like dress invited here by you? Tell me that, mother."</p>

  <p>"My God, her senses are gone!" cried Mrs. Mowbray. "Why did I venture into
  this horrible place?"</p>

  <p>"Ask not <i>why</i> now, madam," rejoined the priest. "The hour for
  consideration is past. We must act. Let the marriage proceed, at all hazards;
  we will then take means to extricate ourselves from this accursed place."</p>

  <p>"Remove that horrible object," said Mrs. Mowbray; "it fascinates the
  vision of my child."</p>

  <p>"Lend me your hand, Richard Checkley," said Peter, sternly regarding the
  priest.</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied the priest, shuddering; "I will not, cannot touch it. Do
  you alone remove it."</p>

  <p>Peter approached Luke. The latter now offered no further opposition, and
  the body was taken away. The eyes of Eleanor followed it into the dark
  recesses of the vault; and when she could no longer distinguish the white
  flutter of the cereclothes, her laboring bosom seemed torn asunder with the
  profound sigh that burst from it, and her head declined upon her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Let me see that ring," said the priest, addressing Luke, who still held
  the wedding-ring between his fingers.</p>

  <p>"I am not naturally superstitious," said Mrs. Mowbray; "whether my mind be
  affected with the horrors of this place, I know not; but I have a dread of
  that ring. She shall not use it."</p>

  <p>"Where no other can be found," said the priest, with a significant and
  peculiar look at Mrs. Mowbray, "I see no reason why this should be rejected.
  I should not have suspected you, madam, of such weakness. Grant there were
  evil spell, or charm, attached to it, which, trust me, there is
  <i>not</i>&mdash;as how should there be, to a harmless piece of
  gold?&mdash;my benediction, and aspersion with holy lymph, will have
  sufficient power to exorcise and expel it. To remove your fears it shall be
  done at once."</p>

  <p>A cup containing water was brought, together with a plate of
  salt&mdash;which condiment the devil is said to abhor, and which is held to
  be a symbol of immortality and of eternity; in that, being itself
  incorruptible, it preserves all else from corruption,&mdash;and, with the
  customary Romish formula of prayer and exorcism, the priest thrice mingled
  the crystal particles with the pure fluid; after which, taking the ring in
  his hand with much solemnity, he sprinkled it with a few drops of the water
  which he had blessed; made the sign of the cross upon the golden circlet;
  uttered another and more potent exorcism to eradicate and expel every device
  of Satan, and delivered it back to Luke.</p>

  <p>"She may wear it now in safety," said the sexton, with strong contempt.
  "Were the snake himself coiled round that consecrated bauble, the prayers of
  the devout Father Checkley would unclasp his lithest folds. But wherefore do
  we tarry now? Naught lies between us and the altar. The path is clear. The
  bridegroom grows impatient."</p>

  <p>"And the bride?" asked Barbara.</p>

  <p>"Is ready," replied the priest. "Madam, delay not longer. Daughter, your
  hand."</p>

  <p>Eleanor gave her hand. It was clammy and cold. Supported by her mother,
  she moved slowly towards the altar, which was but a few steps from where they
  stood. She offered no resistance, but did not raise her head. Luke was by her
  side. Then for the first time did the enormity of the cruel, dishonorable act
  he was about to commit, strike him with its full force. He saw it in its
  darkest colors. It was one of those terrible moments when the headlong wheel
  of passion stands suddenly still.</p>

  <p>"There is yet time," groaned he. "Oh! let me not damn myself perpetually!
  Let me save her; save Sybil; save myself."</p>

  <p>They were at the altar&mdash;that wild wedding train. High over head the
  torch was raised. The red light flashed on bridegroom and on bride, giving to
  the pale features of each an almost livid look; it fell upon the gaunt aspect
  of the sexton, and lit up the smile of triumphant malice that played upon his
  face; it fell upon the fantastical habiliments of Barbara, and upon the
  haughty but perturbed physiognomy of Mrs. Mowbray; it fell upon the salient
  points of the Gothic arches; upon one molded pillar; upon the marble image of
  the virgin Thecla; and on the scarcely less marble countenance of Sybil who
  stood behind the altar, silent, statue-like, immovable. The effect of light
  and shade on other parts of the scene, upon the wild drapery, and harsh
  lineaments of many of the group, was also eminently striking.</p>

  <p>Just as the priest was about to commence the marriage service, a yelling
  chorus, which the gipsies were accustomed to sing at the celebration of the
  nuptials of one of their own tribe, burst forth. Nothing could be more
  horribly discordant than their song.</p>

  <h3>WEDDING CHORUS OF GIPSIES</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Scrape the catgut! pass the liquor!<br>
  Let your quick feet move the quicker.<br>
  Ta-ra-la!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Dance and sing in jolly chorus,<br>
  Bride and bridegroom are before us,<br>
  And the patrico stands o'er us.<br>
  Ta-ra-la!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">To unite their hands he's ready;<br>
  For a moment, pals, be steady;<br>
  Cease your quaffing,<br>
  Dancing, laughing;<br>

  And be quiet,<br>
  While 'tis doing.<br>
  'Tis begun,<br>

  Liquor flowing;<br>
  For our bridals are no bridles, and our altars never alter;<br>
  From the flagon never flinch we, in the jig we never falter.<br>
  No! that's not <i>our</i> way, for <i>we</i><br>
  Are staunch lads of Romany.<br>
  For our wedding, then, hurrah!<br>
  Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!</p><br>

  <p>This uncouth chorus ended, the marriage proceeded. Sybil had disappeared.
  Had she fled? No! she was by the bride. Eleanor mechanically took her place.
  A faint voice syllabled the responses. You could scarcely have seen Miss
  Mowbray's lips move. But the answers were given, and the priest was
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>He took the ring, and sprinkled it once again with the holy water, in the
  form of the cross. He pronounced the prayer: "<i>Benedic, Domine, annulum
  hunc, quem nos in tuo nomine benedicimus, ut quæ eum gestaverit, fidelitatem
  integram suo sponso tenens, in pace et voluntate tua permaneat atque in mutua
  charitate semper vivat.</i>"</p>

  <p>He was about to return the ring to Luke, when the torch, held by the
  knight of Malta, was dashed to the ground by some unseen hand, and instantly
  extinguished. The wild pageant vanished as suddenly as the figures cast by a
  magic-lantern upon a wall disappear when the glass is removed. A wild hubbub
  succeeded. Hoarsely above the clamor arose the voice of Barbara.</p>

  <p>"To the door, quickly!&mdash;to the door! Let no one pass, I will find out
  the author of this mishap anon. Away!"</p>

  <p>She was obeyed. Several of the crew stationed themselves at the door.</p>

  <p>"Proceed now with the ceremony," continued Barbara. "By darkness, or by
  light, the match shall be completed."</p>

  <p>The ring was then placed upon the finger of the bride; and as Luke touched
  it, he shuddered. It was cold as that of the corpse which he had clasped but
  now. The prayer was said, the blessing given, the marriage was complete.</p>

  <p>Suddenly there issued from the darkness deep dirge-like tones, and a voice
  solemnly chanted a strain, which all knew to be the death-song of their race,
  hymned by wailing women over an expiring sister. The music seemed to float in
  the air.</p>

  <h3>THE SOUL-BELL</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Fast the sand of life is falling,<br>
  Fast her latest sigh exhaling,<br>
  Fast, fast, is she dying.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">With death's chills her limbs are shivering,<br>
  With death's gasp the lips are quivering,<br>
  Fast her soul away is flying.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">O'er the mountain-top it fleeteth,<br>
  And the skyey wonders greeteth,<br>
  Singing loud as stars it meeteth<br>
  On its way.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Hark! the sullen Soul-bell tolling,<br>
  Hollowly in echoes rolling,<br>
  Seems to say&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">"She will ope her eyes&mdash;oh, never!<br>
  Quenched their dark light&mdash;gone for ever!<br>
  She is dead."</p><br>

  <p>The marriage group yet lingered near the altar, awaiting, it would seem,
  permission from the gipsy queen to quit the cell. Luke stirred not. Clasped
  in his own, the cold hand of his bride detained him; and when he would have
  moved, her tightened grasp prevented his departure.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray's patience was exhausted by the delay. She was not altogether
  free from apprehension. "Why do we linger here?" she whispered to the priest.
  "Do you, father, lead the way."</p>

  <p>"The crowd is dense," replied Checkley. "They resist my effort."</p>

  <p>"Are we prisoners here?" asked Mrs. Mowbray, in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Let me make the attempt," cried Luke, with fiery impatience. "I will
  force a passage out."</p>

  <p>"Quit not your bride," whispered Peter, "as you value her safety. Heed not
  aught else. She alone is in danger. Suffer her not to be withdrawn from your
  hand, if you would not lose her. Remain here. I will bring the matter to a
  speedy issue."</p>

  <p>"Enough," replied Luke; "I stir not hence." And he drew his bride closer
  towards him. He stooped to imprint a kiss upon her lips. A cold shudder ran
  through her frame as he touched them, but she resisted not his embrace.</p>

  <p>Peter's attempt to effect an egress was as unsuccessful as that of the
  priest. Presenting Excalibur at his bosom, the knight of Malta challenged him
  to stand.</p>

  <p>"You cannot pass," exclaimed the knight; "our orders are peremptory."</p>

  <p>"What am I to understand by this?" said Peter, angrily. "Why are we
  detained?"</p>

  <p>"You will learn all anon," returned Barbara. "In the meantime you are my
  prisoners&mdash;or, if you like not the phrase, my wedding guests."</p>

  <p>"The wedding is complete," returned the sexton; "the bride and bridegroom
  are impatient to depart, and we, the guests&mdash;albeit some of us may be no
  foes to darkness&mdash;desire not to hold our nuptial revels here."</p>

  <p>"Sybil's wedding has not taken place," said Barbara; "you must tarry for
  that."</p>

  <p>"Ha! now it comes," thought Peter. "And who, may I ask," said he, aloud,
  "amongst this goodly company, is to be her bridegroom?"</p>

  <p>"The best amongst them," returned Barbara&mdash;"Sir Luke Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"He has a bride already," replied Peter.</p>

  <p>"She may be <i>removed</i>," said Barbara, with bitter and peculiar
  emphasis. "Dost understand my meaning now?"</p>

  <p>"I will not understand it," said Peter. "You cannot mean to destroy her
  who now stands at the altar?"</p>

  <p>"She who now stands at the altar must make way for a successor. She who
  grasps the bridegroom's hand shall die. I swear it by the oath of my
  tribe."</p>

  <p>"And think you, you will be allowed to execute your murderous intention
  with impunity?" shrieked Mrs. Mowbray, in an agony of terror. "Think you that
  I will stand by and see my child slaughtered before my face; that my friends
  will suffer it? Think you that even your own tribe will dare to execute your
  horrible purpose? They will not. They will side with us. Even now they
  murmur. What can you hope to gain by an act so wild and dreadful? What object
  can you have?"</p>

  <p>"The same as your own," reiterated Barbara&mdash;"the advancement of my
  child. Sybil is as dear to me as Eleanor is to you. She is my child's child,
  the daughter of my best beloved daughter. I have sworn to marry her to Sir
  Luke Rookwood. The means are in my power. I will keep my vow; I will wed her
  to him. You did not hesitate to tear your daughter from the man she loved, to
  give her to the man she hated; and for what? For gold&mdash;for
  power&mdash;for rank. I have the same motive. I love my child, and she loves
  Sir Luke&mdash;has loved him long and truly; therefore shall she have him.
  What to me is <i>your</i> child, or <i>your</i> feelings, except they are
  subservient to my wishes? She stands in my way. I remove her."</p>

  <p>"Who placed her in your path?" asked the sexton. "Did you not lend a
  helping hand to create that obstacle yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I did," replied Barbara. "Would you know wherefore? I will tell you. I
  had a double motive for it. There is a curse upon the house of Rookwood, that
  kills the first fair bride each generation leads to the altar. Have you never
  heard of it?"</p>

  <p>"I have! And did that idle legend sway you?"</p>

  <p>"And do you call it idle? <i>You!</i> Well&mdash;I had another
  motive&mdash;a prophecy."</p>

  <p>"By yourself uttered," replied Peter.</p>

  <p>"Even so," replied Barbara. "The prophecy is fulfilled. The stray rook is
  found. The rook hath with rook mated. Luke hath wedded Eleanor. He will hold
  possession of his lands. The prophecy is fulfilled."</p>

  <p>"But <i>how</i>?" asked Peter; "will your art tell you how and why he
  shall now hold possession? Can you tell me that?"</p>

  <p>"My art goes not so far. I have predicted the event. It has come to pass.
  I am satisfied. He has wedded her. Be it mine to free him from that yoke."
  And Barbara laughed exultingly.</p>

  <p>The sexton approached the old crone, and laid his hand with violence upon
  her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Hear <i>me</i>," cried he, "and I will tell you that which your juggling
  art refuses to reveal. Eleanor Mowbray is heir to the lands of Rookwood! The
  estates are <i>hers</i>! They were bequeathed to her by her grandsire, Sir
  Reginald."</p>

  <p>"She was unborn when he died," cried Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"True," replied Peter; "but the lands were left to your issue
  <i>female</i>, should such issue be born."</p>

  <p>"And did Sir Piers, my brother, know of this? did he see this will," asked
  Mrs. Mowbray, with trembling impatience.</p>

  <p>"He did; and withheld the knowledge of it from you and yours."</p>

  <p>"Ah! why knew I not this before? Why did you not tell me ere that was done
  which cannot be undone? I have sacrificed my child."</p>

  <p>"Because it did not chime with my purposes to tell you," replied Peter,
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"It is false&mdash;it is false," cried Mrs. Mowbray, her anger and
  vexation getting the better of her fears. "I will not believe it. Who are
  you, that pretend to know the secrets of our house?"</p>

  <p>"One of that house," replied the sexton.</p>

  <p>"Your name?"</p>

  <p>"Would you know my name?" answered Peter, sternly. "The time is come when
  I will no longer conceal it. I am Alan Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"My father's brother!" exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"Ay, Alan Rookwood. The sworn enemy of your father&mdash;of you&mdash;of
  all of ye: your fate&mdash;your destiny&mdash;your curse. I am that Alan
  Rookwood whose name you breathed in the vault. I am he, the avenger&mdash;the
  avenged. I saw your father die. I heard his groans&mdash;<i>his
  groans!</i>&mdash;ha, ha! I saw his sons die: one fell in battle&mdash;I was
  with him there. The other expired in his bed. I was with Sir Piers when he
  breathed his last, and listened to his death agonies. 'Twas I who counselled
  him to keep the lands from you and from your child, and he withheld them. One
  only amongst the race, whose name I have cast off, have I loved; and
  him&mdash;because," added he, with something like emotion&mdash;"because he
  was my daughter's child&mdash;Luke Rookwood. And even he shall minister to my
  vengeance. He will be your curse&mdash;your daughter's curse&mdash;for he
  loves her not. Yet he is her husband, and hath her land;&mdash;ha, ha!" And
  he laughed till he became convulsed with the paroxysm of fiendish
  exultation.</p>

  <p>"Mine ears are stunned," cried Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"The bride is mine; relinquish her to me," said Barbara. "Advance and
  seize her, my children."</p>

  <p>Alan Rookwood&mdash;for so we shall henceforth denominate the
  sexton&mdash;suddenly grew calm: he raised the whistle to his lips, and blew
  a call so loud and shrill, that those who were advancing hung back
  irresolute.</p>

  <p>There was a rush at the door of the vault. The sentinels were struck down;
  and with pistols in each hand, and followed by two assistants, Dick Turpin
  sprang into the thick of the crew.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," cried he, "ready for action. Where is Sir Luke Rookwood?
  where my churchyard pal, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Here," cried the sexton and Luke simultaneously.</p>

  <p>"Then stand aside," cried Dick, pushing in the direction of the sounds,
  and bearing down all opposition. "Have a care there&mdash;these triggers are
  ticklish. Friend or foe, he who touches me shall have a bullet in his
  gizzard. Here I am, pal Peter; and here are my two chums, Rust and Wilder.
  Cut the whid."</p>

  <p>"Have we license to pass scathless now?" asked the sexton; "or shall we
  make good our way?"</p>

  <p>"You shall not pass," cried Barbara, furiously. "Think you to rob me of my
  prey? What, cowards! do you hesitate? Ha!"</p>

  <p>"Kindle the torches," cried several voices. "We fight not in the
  dark."</p>

  <p>A pistol was flashed. The torch again blazed. Its light fell upon a
  tumultuous group.</p>

  <p>"Seize the bride," cried Barbara.</p>

  <p>"Hold!" exclaimed a voice from the altar. The voice was that of Sybil.</p>

  <p>Her hand was clasped in that of Luke. Eleanor had fainted in the arms of
  the gipsy girl Handassah.</p>

  <p>"Are you my bride?" ejaculated Luke, in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Behold the ring upon my finger! Your own hand placed it there."</p>

  <p>"Betrayed!" screamed Alan, in a voice of anguish. "My schemes
  annihilated&mdash;myself undone&mdash;my enemies triumphant&mdash;lost! lost!
  All is destroyed&mdash;all!"</p>

  <p>"Joy! joy!" exclaimed Mrs. Mowbray: "my child is saved."</p>

  <p>"And <i>mine</i> destroyed," groaned Barbara. "I have sworn by the cross
  to slay the bride&mdash;and Sybil is that bride."</p>

  wed, Sir Luke, let me advise you not to choose a wife in the dark. A man
  should have all his senses about him on these occasions. Make love when the
  liquor's in; marry when it's out, and, above all, with your eyes open. This
  beats cock-fighting&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;you must excuse me; but, upon my
  soul, I can't help it." And his laughter seemed inextinguishable.</p>

  <p>"Take your men without," whispered Alan Rookwood; "keep watch as before,
  and let the discharge of a pistol bespeak the approach of danger as agreed
  upon; much yet remains to be done here."</p>

  <p>"How so?" asked Dick; "it seems to me the job's entirely settled&mdash;if
  not to <i>your</i> satisfaction. I'm always ready to oblige my friend, Sir
  Luke; but curse me if I'd lend my help to any underhand work. Steer clear of
  foul play, or Dick Turpin holds no hand with you. As to that poor wench, if
  you mean her any harm, curse me if I will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No harm is intended her," replied Alan. "I applaud your magnanimity,"
  added he, sarcastically; "such sentiments are, it must be owned, in excellent
  keeping with your conduct."</p>

  <p>"In keeping or not," replied Turpin, gravely, "cold-blooded murder is
  altogether out of my line, and I wash my hands of it. A shot or two in self
  defence is another matter; and when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A truce to this," interrupted Alan; "the girl is safe. Will you mount
  guard again?"</p>

  <p>"If that be the case, certainly," replied Dick. "I shall be glad to get
  back to Bess. I couldn't bring her with me into this black hole. A couple of
  shots will tell you 'tis Ranulph Rookwood. But mind, no harm to the gipsy
  girl&mdash;to Lady Rookwood, I should say. She's a jewel, take my word for
  it, which Sir Luke must be mad to throw away." And calling his companions, he
  departed.</p>

  <p>Alan Rookwood bent his steps towards the gipsy queen. Dark thoughts
  gathered quickly o'er his brow. He smiled as he drew nigh to Barbara&mdash;a
  smile it was</p>

  <p>That wrinkled up his skin even to the hair.</p>

  <p>Barbara looked at him at first with distrust; but as he developed his
  secret purposes, that smile became reflected upon her own features. Their
  conference took place apart. We willingly leave them to return to the
  altar.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray and the priest were still there. Both were occupied in
  ineffectual endeavors to restore Eleanor to consciousness. She recovered from
  her swoon; but it was evident her senses still wandered; and vainly did Mrs.
  Mowbray lavish her tenderest caresses upon her child. Eleanor returned them
  not.</p>

  <p>Luke, meanwhile, had given vent to the wildest fury. He shook away Sybil's
  grasp; he dashed her from him; he regarded her with withering glances; he
  loaded her with reproaches. She bore his violence with meekest submission;
  she looked imploringly&mdash;but she replied not to his taunts. Again she
  clung to the hem of his garment when cast aside. Luke appeared unmoved; what
  passed within we pause not to examine. He grew calmer; his calmness was more
  terrible to Sybil than his previous wrath had been.</p>

  <p>"You are my wife," said he; "what then? By fraud, by stratagem, you have
  obtained that title, and, perforce, must keep it. But the title
  <i>only</i>shall you retain. No rights of wife shall ever be yours. It will
  be in your power to call yourself Lady Rookwood&mdash;you will be so in
  name&mdash;in nothing else."</p>

  <p>"I shall not bear it long," murmured Sybil.</p>

  <p>Luke laughed scornfully, "So you said before," replied he; "and yet I see
  not why you are likely to abandon it. The event will show. Thus far you have
  deceived me, and I place no further faith in your assertions. My hand was
  yours; you refused it. When I would give it to another, you grasp it
  clandestinely. Am I to believe you now? The wind will change&mdash;the vane
  veer with it."</p>

  <p>"It will not veer from you," she meekly answered.</p>

  <p>"Why did you step between me and my bride?"</p>

  <p>"To save her life; to lay down mine for hers."</p>

  <p>"An idle subterfuge. You know well that you run no risk of being called
  upon to do so. Your life is in no danger. The sacrifice was unnecessary. I
  could have dispensed with <i>your</i> assistance; my own arm would have
  sufficed to protect Eleanor."</p>

  <p>"Your single arm would not have prevailed against numbers: they would have
  killed you likewise."</p>

  <p>"Tush!" said Luke, fiercely. "Not only have you snatched from me my bride,
  you have robbed me of my fair estates, of all, save of my barren title, and
  that, even <i>that</i>, you have tarnished."</p>

  <p>"True, true," sighed Sybil. "I knew not that the lands were hers, else had
  I never done it."</p>

  <p>"False, false," cried Luke; "false as the rest. <i>They</i> will be
  Ranulph's. <i>She</i> will be Ranulph's. I shall still be an outcast, while
  Ranulph will riot in my halls&mdash;will press her to his bosom. Cling not to
  me. Hence! or I will spurn you from me. I am undone, undone by you, accursed
  one."</p>

  <p>"Oh, curse me not! your words cut deep enough."</p>

  <p>"Would they could kill you," cried Luke, with savage bitterness. "You have
  placed a bar between me and my prospects, which nothing can now
  remove&mdash;nothing but&mdash;ha!" and his countenance assumed a deadly hue
  and fearful expression. "By Heaven, you almost rouse the fell spirit which it
  is said dwells within the breast of my devoted race. I feel as if I could
  stab thee."</p>

  <p>"No, no!" shrieked Sybil; "for mercy's sake, for your own sake, do not
  stab me. It is not too late. I will repair my wrong!"</p>

  <p>"Ever deceiving! you would again delude me. You cannot repair it. One way
  alone remains, and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will pursue," responded Sybil, sadly, but firmly.</p>

  <p>"Never!" cried Luke; "you shall not. Ha!" exclaimed he, as he found his
  arms suddenly pinioned behind him. "What new treachery is this? By whose
  orders am I thus fettered?"</p>

  <p>"By mine," said Alan Rookwood, stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"By yours?" echoed Luke. "And wherefore? Release me."</p>

  <p>"Be patient," replied Alan. "You will hear all anon. In the meantime you
  must be content to remain my prisoner. Quit not your hold," added he,
  addressing the gipsies, who kept charge of Luke.</p>

  <p>"Their lives shall answer for their obedience," said Barbara.</p>

  <p>Upon a further signal from Alan, Eleanor was torn from her mother's arms,
  and a bandage passed so suddenly over Mrs. Mowbray's face, that, before she
  could raise a cry of alarm, all possibility of utterance was effectually
  prevented. The priest alone was left at liberty.</p>

  <p>Barbara snatched the hand of Eleanor. She dragged her to Sybil.</p>

  <p>"You are Lady Rookwood," whispered she; "but she has your domains. I give
  her to you."</p>

  <p>"She is the <i>only bar</i> between thy husband and his rights," whispered
  Alan Rookwood, in a tone of horrible irony; "<i>it is not too late to repair
  your wrong</i>."</p>

  <p>"Away, tempter!" cried Sybil, horror-stricken. "I know you well. Yet,"
  continued she, in an altered tone, "I will risk all for him. I have done him
  wrong. One mode of atonement remains; and, horrible though it be, I will
  embrace it. Let me not pause. Give her to me." And she seized upon the
  unresisting hand of Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Do you need my aid?" asked Barbara.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Sybil; "let none approach us. A clapping of hands will let
  you know when all is over." And she dragged her passive victim deeper into
  the vault.</p>

  <p>"Sybil, Sybil!" cried Luke, struggling with frantic violence to liberate
  himself; "hurt her not. I was rash. I was mad. I am calmer now. She hears me
  not&mdash;she will not turn. God of heaven! she will murder her. It will be
  done while I speak. I am the cause of all. Release me, villains! Would that I
  had died ere I had seen this day."</p>

  <p>At a signal from the sexton, Luke also was blindfolded. He ceased to
  struggle. But his laboring breast told of the strife within.</p>

  <p>"Miscreants!" exclaimed the priest, who had hitherto witnessed the
  proceedings in horror. "Why do not these rocks fall in, and crush you and
  your iniquities? Save her! oh, save her! Have you no pity for the
  innocent?"</p>

  <p>"Such pity have we," replied Alan Rookwood, "as you showed my daughter.
  She was as innocent as Eleanor Mowbray, and yet you did not pity
  <i>her</i>."</p>

  <p>"Heaven is my witness," exclaimed the priest, "that I never injured
  her."</p>

  <p>"Take not Heaven's name in vain," cried Alan. "Who stood by while it was
  doing? Whose firmer hand lent aid to the murderer's trembling efforts? Whose
  pressure stifled her thrilling screams, and choked her cries for mercy?
  Yours&mdash;yours; and now you prate to me of pity&mdash;you, the slayer of
  the sleeping and the innocent!"</p>

  <p>"'Tis false!" exclaimed the priest, in extremity of terror.</p>

  <p>"False!" echoed Alan. "I had Sir Piers's own confession. He told me all.
  You had designs upon Sir Piers, which his wife opposed; you hated her; you
  were in the confidence of both&mdash;how did you keep that confidence? He
  told me <i>how</i>, by awakening a spirit of jealousy and pride, that
  o'ermastered all his better feelings. False! He told me of your hellish
  machinations; your Jesuitical plots; your schemes. He was too weak, too
  feeble an instrument to serve you. You left him, but not before <i>she</i>
  had left him. False! ha, I have that shall instantly convict you. The corpse
  is here, within this cell. Who brought it hither?"</p>

  <p>The priest was silent: he seemed confounded by Alan's violence.</p>

  <p>"I will answer that question," said Barbara. "It was brought hither by
  that false priest. His agent, Balthazar, has betrayed him. It was brought
  hither to prevent the discovery of Sir Luke Rookwood's legitimacy. He meant
  to make his own terms about it. It has come hither to proclaim his
  guilt&mdash;to be a fearful witness against him." Then, turning to Checkley,
  she added, "You have called Heaven to witness your innocence: you shall
  attest it by oath upon that body; and should aught indicate your guilt, I
  will hang you as I would a dog, and clear off one long score with justice. Do
  you shrink from this?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the priest, in a voice hollow and broken. "Bring me to the
  body."</p>

  <p>"Seize each an arm," said Barbara, addressing Zoroaster and the knight of
  Malta, "and lead him to the corse."</p>

  <p>"I will administer the oath," said Alan Rookwood, sternly.</p>

  <p>"No, not you," stammered the priest.</p>

  <p>"And wherefore not?" asked Alan. "If you are innocent, you need fear
  nothing from her."</p>

  <p>"I fear nothing from the <i>dead</i>," replied Checkley; "lead on."</p>

  <p>We will now return to Sybil. She was alone with her victim. They were near
  the mouth of the cell which had been Prior Cyprian's flinty dormitory, and
  were almost involved in darkness. A broken stream of light glanced through
  the pillars. Eleanor had not spoken. She suffered herself to be dragged
  thither without resistance, scarcely conscious, it would seem, of her danger.
  Sybil gazed upon her for some minutes with sorrow and surprise. "She
  comprehends not her perilous situation," murmured Sybil. "She knows not that
  she stands upon the brink of the grave. Oh! would that she could pray. Shall
  I, her murderess, pray for her? My prayers would not be heard. And yet, to
  kill her unshriven will be a twofold crime. Let me not look on her. My hand
  trembles. I can scarce grasp the dagger. Let me think on all he has said. I
  have wronged him. I am his bane, his curse! I have robbed him of all: there
  is but one remedy&mdash;'tis <i>this</i>!&mdash;Oh, God! she recovers. I
  cannot do it now."</p>

  <p>It was a fearful moment for Eleanor's revival, when the bright steel
  flashed before her eyes. Terror at once restored her. She cast herself at
  Sybil's feet.</p>

  <p>"Spare, spare me!" cried she. "Oh! what a dream I have had. And to waken
  thus, with the dagger's point at my breast. You will not kill me&mdash;you,
  gentle maid, who promised to preserve me. Ah, no, I am sure you will
  not."</p>

  <p>"Appeal no more to me," said Sybil, fiercely. "Make your peace with
  Heaven. Your minutes are numbered."</p>

  <p>"I cannot pray," said Eleanor, "while you are near me."</p>

  <p>"Will you pray if I retire and leave you?"</p>

  <p>"No, no. I dare not&mdash;cannot," shrieked Eleanor, in extremity of
  terror. "Oh! do not leave me, or let me go."</p>

  <p>"If you stir," said Sybil, "I stab you to the heart."</p>

  <p>"I will not stir. I will kneel here forever. Stab me as I kneel&mdash;as I
  pray to you. You cannot kill me while I cling to you thus&mdash;while I kiss
  your hands&mdash;while I bedew them with my tears. Those tears will not sully
  them like my blood."</p>

  <p>"Maiden," said Sybil, endeavoring to withdraw her hand, "let go your
  hold&mdash;your sand is run."</p>

  <p>"Mercy!"</p>

  <p>"It is in vain. Close your eyes."</p>

  <p>"No, I will fix them on you thus&mdash;you cannot strike then. I will
  cling to you&mdash;embrace you. Your nature is not cruel&mdash;your soul is
  full of pity. It melts&mdash;those tears&mdash;you will be merciful. You
  cannot deliberately kill me."</p>

  <p>"I cannot&mdash;I cannot!" said Sybil, with a passionate outburst of
  grief. "Take your life on one condition."</p>

  <p>"Name it."</p>

  <p>"That you wed Sir Luke Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Eleanor, "all rushes back upon me at that name; the whole
  of that fearful scene passes in review before me."</p>

  <p>"Do you reject my proposal?"</p>

  <p>"I dare not."</p>

  <p>"I must have your oath. Swear by every hope of eternity that you will wed
  none other than him."</p>

  <p>"By every hope, I swear it."</p>

  <p>"Handassah, you will bear this maiden's oath in mind, and witness its
  fulfilment."</p>

  <p>"I will," replied the gipsy girl, stepping forward from a recess, in which
  she had hitherto remained unnoticed.</p>

  <p>"Enough. I am satisfied. Tarry with me. Stir not&mdash;scream not,
  whatever you may see or hear. Your life depends upon your firmness. When I am
  no more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No more?" echoed Eleanor, in horror.</p>

  <p>"Be calm," said Sybil. "When I am dead, clap your hands together. They
  will come to seek you&mdash;they will find me in your stead. Then rush to
  him&mdash;to Sir Luke Rookwood. He will protect you. Say to him hereafter
  that I died for the wrong I did him&mdash;that I died, and blessed him."</p>

  <p>"Can you not live, and save me?" sobbed Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Ask it not. While I live, your life is in danger. When I am gone, none
  will seek to harm you. Fare you well! Remember your oath, and you, too,
  remember it, Handassah. Remember also&mdash;ha! that groan!"</p>

  <p>All started, as a deep groan knelled in their ears.</p>

  <p>"Whence comes that sound?" cried Sybil. "Hist!&mdash;a voice?"</p>

  <p>"It is that of the priest," cried Eleanor. "Hark! he groans. They have
  murdered him! Kind Heaven, receive his soul!"</p>

  <p>"Pray for me," cried Sybil: "pray fervently; avert your face; down on your
  knees&mdash;down&mdash;down! Farewell, Handassah!" And breaking from them,
  she rushed into the darkest recesses of the vault.</p>

  <p>We must now quit this painful scene for another scarcely less painful, and
  return to the unfortunate priest.</p>

  <p>Checkley had been brought before the body of Susan Rookwood. Even in the
  gloom, the shimmer of the white cereclothes, and the pallid features of the
  corpse, were ghastly enough. The torchlight made them terrible.</p>

  <p>"Kneel!" said Alan Rookwood. The priest complied. Alan knelt beside
  him.</p>

  <p>"Do you know these features?" demanded he. "Regard them well. Fix your
  eyes full upon them. Do you know them?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"Place your hand upon her breast. Does not the flesh creep and shrink
  beneath your touch? Now raise your hand&mdash;make the cross of your faith
  upon her bosom. By that faith you swear you are innocent."</p>

  <p>"I do," returned the priest; "are you now satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Alan. "Let the torch be removed. Your innocence must be more
  deeply attested," continued he, as the light was withdrawn. "This proof will
  not fail. Entwine your fingers round her throat."</p>

  <p>"Have I not done enough?"</p>

  <p>"Your hesitation proves your guilt," said Alan.</p>

  <p>"That proof is wanting, then?" returned the priest; "my hand is upon her
  throat&mdash;what more?"</p>

  <p>"As you hope for mercy in your hour of need, swear that you never
  conspired against her life, or refused her mercy."</p>

  <p>"I swear it."</p>

  <p>"May the dead convict you of perjury if you have forsworn yourself," said
  Alan; "you are free. Take away your hand!"</p>

  <p>"Ha! what is this?" exclaimed the priest. "You have put some jugglery upon
  me. I cannot withdraw my hand. It sticks to her throat, as though 'twere
  glued by blood. Tear me away. I have not force enough to liberate myself. Why
  do you grin at me? The corpse grins likewise. It is jugglery. I am innocent.
  You would take away my life. Tear me away, I say: the veins rise; they
  blacken; they are filling with new blood. I feel them swell; they coil like
  living things around my fingers. She is alive."</p>

  <p>"And you are innocent?"</p>

  <p>"I am&mdash;I am. Let not my ravings convict me. For Jesu's sake, release
  me."</p>

  <p>"Blaspheme not, but arise. I hold you not."</p>

  <p>"You do," groaned the priest. "Your grasp tightens round my throat; your
  hard and skinny fingers are there&mdash;I strangle&mdash;help!"</p>

  <p>"Your own fears strangle you. My hand is at my side," returned Alan
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"Villain, you lie. Your grasp is like a vice. The strength of a thousand
  devils is in your hand. Will none lend help? I never pressed so hard. Your
  daughter never suffered this torture&mdash;never&mdash;never. I
  choke&mdash;choke&mdash;oh!" And the priest rolled heavily backwards.</p>

  <p>There was a deep groan; a convulsive rattle in the throat; and all was
  still.</p>

  <p>"He is dead&mdash;strangled," cried several voices, holding down the
  torch. The face of the priest was blackened and contorted; his eyeballs
  protruded from their sockets; his tongue was nearly bitten through in the
  desperate efforts he had made to release himself from Alan's gripe; his hair
  was erect with horror. It was a ghastly sight.</p>

  <p>A murmur arose amongst the gipsies. Barbara deemed it prudent to appease
  them.</p>

  <p>"He was guilty," cried she. "He was the murderer of Susan Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"And I, <i>her father</i>, have avenged her," said Alan, sternly.</p>

  <p>The dreadful silence that followed this speech was broken by the report of
  a pistol. The sound, though startling, was felt almost as a relief.</p>

  <p>"We are beset," cried Alan. "Some of you fly to reconnoitre."</p>

  <p>"To your posts," cried Barbara.</p>

  <p>Several of the crew flocked to the entrance.</p>

  <p>"Unbind the prisoners," shouted Alan.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray and Luke were accordingly set free.</p>

  <p>Two almost simultaneous reports of a pistol were now heard.</p>

  <p>"'Tis Ranulph Rookwood," said Alan; "that was the preconcerted
  signal."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph Rookwood," echoed Eleanor, who caught the exclamation: "he comes
  to save me."</p>

  <p>"Remember your oath," gasped a dying voice. "He is no longer yours."</p>

  <p>"Alas! alas!" sobbed Eleanor, tremblingly.</p>

  <p>A moment afterwards a faint clapping of hands reached the ears of
  Barbara.</p>

  <p>"All is over," muttered she.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Alan Rookwood, with a frightful look. "Is it done?"</p>

  <p>Barbara motioned him towards the further end of the vault.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-13"
     name="ch3-13"></a>CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; MR. COATES</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>Grimm.</i> Look, captain, here comes one of the
  bloodhounds of justice.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Schw.</i> Down with him. Don't let him utter a word.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Moor.</i> Silence, I will hear him.</p>

  <p class="quote"><span class="smcap">Schiller:</span> <i>The
  Robbers</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">GLADLY do we now exchange the dank atmosphere of Saint
  Cyprian's cell, and the horrors which have detained us there so long, for
  balmy air, genial sunshine, and the boon companionship of Dick Turpin. Upon
  regaining the verdant ruins of the ancient priory, all appeared pretty much
  as our highwayman had left it. Dick wended towards his mare. Black Bess
  uttered an affectionate whinnying sound as he approached her, and yielded her
  sleek neck to his caresses. No Bedouin Arab ever loved his horse more
  tenderly than Turpin.</p>

  <p>"'Twill be a hard day when thou and I part!" murmured he, affectionately
  patting her soft and silky cheeks. Bess thrust her nose into his hand, biting
  him playfully, as much as to say, "That day will never arrive." Turpin, at
  least, understood the appeal in that sense; he was skilled in the language of
  the Houyhnhnms. "I would rather lose my right hand than <i>that</i> should
  happen," sighed he; "but there's no saying: the best of friends must part;
  and thou and I may be one day separated: thy destination is the
  knacker&mdash;mine, perhaps, the gibbet.&mdash;We are neither of us cut out
  for old age, that's certain. Curse me if I can tell how it is; since I've
  been in that vault, I've got some queer crotchet into my head. I can't help
  likening thee to that poor gipsy wench, Sybil; but may I be scragged if I'd
  use thee as her lover has used her. Ha!" exclaimed he, drawing a pistol with
  a suddenness that made his companions, Rust and Wilder, start, "we are
  watched. See you not how yon shadow falls from behind the wall?"</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Rust.</p>

  <p>"The varmint shall be speedily unearthed," said Wilder, rushing to the
  spot.</p>

  <p>In another instant the shadow manifested itself in a substantial little
  personage, booted, spurred, and mud-bespattered. He was brought before our
  highwayman, who had, meanwhile, vaulted into his saddle.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coates!" cried Dick, bursting into a loud laugh at the ridiculous
  figure presented to his view, "or the mud deceives me."</p>

  <p>"It does not deceive you, Captain Turpin," replied the attorney; "you do,
  indeed, behold that twice unfortunate person."</p>

  <p>"What brings you here?" asked Dick. "Ah! I see, you are come to pay me my
  wager."</p>

  <p>"I thought you gave me a <i>discharge</i> for that," rejoined Coates,
  unable, even in his distress, to resist the too-tempting quibble.</p>

  <p>"True, but it was <i>in blank</i>," replied Turpin readily; "and that
  don't hold good in law, you know. You have thrown away a second chance. Play
  or pay, all the world over. I shan't <i>let you off</i> so easily this time,
  depend upon it. Come, post the pony, or take your measure on that sod. No
  more replications or rejoinders, sir, down with the dust. Fake his clies,
  pals. Let us see what he has about him."</p>

  <p>"In the twinkling of a bed-post," replied Rust. "We'll turn him inside
  out. What's here?" cried he, searching the attorney's pockets. "A brace of
  barkers," handing a pair of pistols to Turpin, "a haddock, stuffed with
  nothing, I'm thinking; one quid, two coach-wheels, half a bull, three hogs,
  and a kick; a d&mdash;d dicky concern, captain."</p>

  <p>"Three hogs and a kick," muttered Coates; "the knave says true
  enough."</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing else?" demanded Dick.</p>

  <p>"Only an old snuffy fogle and a pewter sneezer."</p>

  <p>"No reader?[90] Try his hoxter."[91]</p>

  <p>"Here's a pit-man,[92] captain."</p>

  <p>"Give it me. Ah! this will do," cried Dick, examining the contents of the
  pocket-book. "This is a glorious windfall indeed; a bill of exchange for
  500<i>l.</i>, payable <i>on demand</i>, eh, Mr. Coates? Quick! indorse it,
  sir. Here's pen and ink. Rascal! if you attempt to tear the bill, I'll blow
  your brains out. Steady, sir, sign. Good!" added he, as Coates most
  reluctantly indorsed the bill. "Good! good! I'll be off with this bill to
  London to-night, before you can stop it. No courier can beat Bess&mdash;ha,
  ha! Eh! what's this?" continued Dick, as, unfolding another leaf of the
  pocket-book, he chanced upon a letter; "My Lady Rookwood's superscription!
  Excuse me, Mr. Coates, I must have a peep at her ladyship's billet-doux.
  All's safe with me&mdash;man of honor. I must detain your <i>reader</i> a
  moment longer."</p>

  <p>"You should take charge of yourself, then," replied Coates, sulkily.
  "<i>You</i> appear to be my reader."</p>

  <p>"Bravo!" cried Turpin. "You may jest now with impunity, Mr. Coates. You
  have paid dear enough for your jokes; and when should a man be allowed to be
  pleasant, if not at his own expense?&mdash;ha, ha! What's this?" exclaimed
  he, opening the letter. "A ring, as I'm awake! and from her ladyship's own
  fair finger, I'll be sworn, for it bears her cipher, ineffaceably impressed
  as your image upon her heart&mdash;eh, Coates? Egad! you are a lucky dog,
  after all, to receive <i>such</i> a favor from <i>such</i> a lady&mdash;ha,
  ha! Meantime, I'll take care of it for you," continued Dick, slipping the
  ring on his little finger.</p>

  <p>Turpin, we have before remarked, had a turn for mimicry; and it was with
  an irresistible feeling of deferential awe creeping over him that Coates
  heard the contents of Lady Rookwood's epistle delivered with an enunciation
  as peremptory and imperious as that of her ladyship's self. The letter was
  hastily indited, in a clear, firm hand, and partook of its writer's decision
  of character. Dick found no difficulty in deciphering it. Thus ran the
  missive:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"Assured of your devotion and secrecy, I commit my own
  honor, and that of my son, to your charge. Time will not permit me to see
  you, or I would not write. But I place myself entirely in your hands. You
  will not dare to betray my confidence. To the point:&mdash;A Major Mowbray
  has just arrived here with intelligence that the body of Susan
  Bradley&mdash;you will know to whom I allude&mdash;has been removed from our
  family vault by a Romish priest and his assistants. How it came there, or why
  it has been removed, I know not; it is not my present purpose to inquire.
  Suffice it, that it now lies in a vault beneath the ruins of Davenham Priory.
  My son, Sir Ranulph, who has lent a credulous ear to the artful tales of the
  impostor who calls this woman mother, is at present engaged in arming certain
  of the household, and of the tenantry, to seize upon and bring away this
  body, as resistance is apprehended from a horde of gipsies who infest the
  ruins. Now, mark me. <u>That body must not be found!</u> Be it your business
  to prevent its discovery. Take the fleetest horse you can procure; spare
  neither whip nor spur. Haste to the priory; procure by any means, and at any
  expense, the assistance of the gipsies. Find out the body; conceal it,
  destroy it&mdash;do what you will, so my son find it not. Fear not his
  resentment; I will bear you harmless of the consequences with him. You will
  act upon my responsibility. I pledge my honor for your safety. Use all
  despatch, and calculate upon due requital from</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Maud Rookwood</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Haste, and God speed you!"</p><br>

  <p>"God speed you!" echoed Dick, in his own voice, contemptuously. "The devil
  drive you! would have been a fitter postscript. And it was upon this precious
  errand you came, Mr. Coates?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," replied the attorney; "but I find the premises preoccupied.
  Fast as I have ridden, you are here before me."</p>

  <p>"And what do you now propose to do?" asked Turpin.</p>

  <p>"Bargain with you for the body," replied Coates, in an insinuating
  tone.</p>

  <p>"With <i>me</i>!" said Dick; "do you take me for a resurrection cove; for
  a dealer in dead stock, eh! sirrah?"</p>

  <p>"I take you for one sufficiently <i>alive</i>, in a general way, to his
  own interests," returned Coates. "These gentlemen may not, perhaps, be quite
  so scrupulous, when they hear my proposals."</p>

  <p>"Be silent, sir," interrupted Turpin. "Hist! I hear the tramp of horses'
  hoofs without. Hark! that shout."</p>

  <p>"Make your own terms before they come," said Coates. "Leave all to me.
  I'll put 'em on a wrong scent."</p>

  <p>"To the devil with your terms," cried Turpin; "the signal!" And he pulled
  the trigger of one of Coates's pistols, the shot of which rang in the ears of
  the astounded attorney as it whizzed past him. "Drag him into the mouth of
  the vault," thundered Turpin: "he will be a capital cover in case of attack.
  Look to your sticks, and be on the alert;&mdash;away!"</p>

  <p>Vainly did the unfortunate attorney kick and struggle, swear and scream;
  his hat was pushed over his eyes; his bob-wig thrust into his mouth; and his
  legs tripped from under him. Thus blind, dumb, and half-suffocated, he was
  hurried into the entrance of the cell.</p>

  <p>Dick, meanwhile, dashed to the arched outlet of the ruin. He there drew in
  the rein, and Black Bess stood motionless as a statue.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3-14"
     name="ch3-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; DICK TURPIN</h2>

  <p class="quote">Many a fine fellow with a genius extensive enough to have
  effected universal reformation has been doomed to perish by the halter. But
  does not such a man's renown extend through centuries and tens of centuries,
  while many a prince would be overlooked in history were it not the
  historian's interest to increase the number of his pages? Nay, when the
  traveller sees a gibbet, does he not exclaim, "That fellow was no fool!" and
  lament the hardship of the times?<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Schiller:</span> <i>The Robbers</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">TURPIN'S quick eye ranged over the spreading sward in front
  of the ancient priory, and his brow became contracted. The feeling, however,
  was transient. The next instant saw him the same easy, reckless being he had
  been before. There was a little more paleness in his cheek than usual; but
  his look was keener, and his knees involuntarily clasped the saddle more
  firmly. No other symptom of anxiety was perceptible. It would be no
  impeachment to Dick's valor were it necessary to admit that a slight tremor
  crossed him as he scanned the formidable array of his opponents. The
  admission is needless. Dick himself would have been the last man to own it;
  nor shall we do the memory of our undaunted highwayman any such injustice.
  Turpin was intrepid to a fault. He was rash; apt to run into risks for the
  mere pleasure of getting out of them: danger was his delight, and the degree
  of excitement was always in proportion to the peril incurred. After the first
  glance, he became, to use his own expressive phrase, "as cool as a cucumber;"
  and continued, as long as they permitted him, like a skilful commander,
  calmly to calculate the numerical strength of his adversaries, and to arrange
  his own plan of resistance.</p>

  <p>This troop of horsemen, for such it was, might probably amount in the
  aggregate to twenty men, and presented an appearance like that of a strong
  muster at a rustic fox-chase, due allowance being made for the various
  weapons of offence; to-wit: naked sabers, firelocks, and a world of huge
  horse-pistols, which the present <i>field</i> carried along with them. This
  resemblance was heightened by the presence of an old huntsman and a
  gamekeeper or two, in scarlet and green jackets, and a few yelping hounds
  that had followed after them. The majority of the crew consisted of sturdy
  yeomen; some of whom, mounted upon wild, unbroken colts, had pretty lives of
  it to maintain their seats, and curvetted about in "most admired disorder;"
  others were seated upon more docile, but quite as provoking specimens of the
  cart-horse breed, whose sluggish sides, reckless alike of hobnailed heel or
  ash sapling, refused to obey their riders' intimations to move; while others
  again, brought stiff, wrong-headed ponies to the charge&mdash;obstinate,
  impracticable little brutes, who seemed to prefer revolving on their own
  axis, and describing absurd rotatory motions, to proceeding in the direct and
  proper course pointed out to them. Dick could scarcely forbear laughing at
  these ridiculous manoeuvres; but his attention was chiefly attracted towards
  three individuals, who were evidently the leaders of this warlike expedition.
  In the thin, tall figure of the first of these he recognized Ranulph
  Rookwood. With the features and person of the second of the group he was not
  entirely unacquainted, and fancied&mdash;nor incorrectly fancied&mdash;that
  his military bearing, or, as he would have expressed it, "the soldier-like
  cut of his jib," could belong to no other than Major Mowbray, whom he had
  once eased of a purse on Finchley Common. In the round, rosy countenance and
  robustious person of the last of the trio he discovered his ancient ally,
  Titus Tyrconnel.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Titus, my jewel, are you there?" exclaimed Dick, as he distinguished
  the Irishman. "Come, I have <i>one</i> friend among them whom I may welcome.
  So, they see me now. Off they come, pell-mell. Back, Bess,
  back!&mdash;slowly, wench, slowly&mdash;there&mdash;stand!" And Bess again
  remained motionless.</p>

  <p>The report of Turpin's pistol reached the ears of the troop; and as all
  were upon the alert, he had scarcely presented himself at the gateway, when a
  loud shout was raised, and the whole cavalcade galloped towards him,
  creating, as may be imagined, the wildest disorder; each horseman yelling, as
  he neared the arch, and got involved in the press occasioned by the
  unexpected concentration of forces at that point, while oaths and blows,
  kicks and cuffs, were reciprocated with such hearty good-will, that, had
  Turpin ever read Ariosto or Cervantes, or heard of the discord of King
  Agramante's camp, this <i>mêlée</i> must have struck him as its realization.
  As it was, entertaining little apprehension of the result, he shouted
  encouragement to them. Scarcely, however, had the foremost horseman
  disentangled himself from the crowd, and, struggling to the door, was in the
  act of levelling his pistol at Turpin's head, when a well-directed ball
  pierced the brain of his charger, and horse and man rolled to the ground.
  Vowing vengeance, a second succeeded, and was in like manner compelled to
  bite the dust.</p>

  <p>"That will let Old Peter know that Ranulph Rookwood is at hand," exclaimed
  Dick. "I shan't throw away another shot."</p>

  <p>The scene at the archway was now one of complete confusion. Terrified by
  the shots, some of the boors would have drawn back, while others, in mid
  career, advanced, and propelled them forwards. It was like the meeting of two
  tides. Here and there, regardless of the bit, and scared by the firing, a
  wild colt broke all bounds, and, hurling his rider in the air, darted off
  into the green; or, in another case, rushed forward, and encountering the
  prostrate cattle cumbering the entrance to the priory hall, stumbled, and
  precipitated his master neck-over-heels at the very feet of his enemy. During
  all this tumult, a few shots were fired at the highwayman, which, without
  doing him a jot of mischief, tended materially to increase their own
  confusion.</p>

  <p>The voice of Turpin was now heard above the din and turmoil to sound a
  parley; and as he appeared disposed to offer no opposition, some of his
  antagonists ventured to raise themselves from the ground, and to approach
  him.</p>

  <p>"I demand to be led to Sir Ranulph Rookwood," said Turpin.</p>

  <p>"He is here," said Ranulph, riding up. "Villain, you are my prisoner."</p>

  <p>"As you list, Sir Ranulph," returned Dick, coolly; "but let me have a word
  in private with you ere you do aught you may repent hereafter."</p>

  <p>"No words, sir&mdash;deliver up your arms, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My pistols are at your service," replied Dick. "I have just discharged
  them."</p>

  <p>"You may have others. We must search you."</p>

  <p>"Hold!" cried Dick; "if you will not listen to me, read that paper." And
  he handed Ranulph his mother's letter to Mr. Coates. It was without the
  superscription, which he had thrown aside.</p>

  <p>"My mother's hand!" exclaimed Ranulph, reddening with anger, as he hastily
  perused its contents. "And she sent this to you? You lie, villain&mdash;'tis
  a forgery."</p>

  <p>"Let this speak for me," returned Dick, holding out the finger upon which
  Lady Rookwood's ring was placed. "Know you that cipher?"</p>

  <p>"You have stolen it," retorted Ranulph. "My mother," added he, in a deep,
  stern whisper, articulated only for Turpin's hearing, "would never have
  entrusted her honor to a highwayman's keeping."</p>

  <p>"She has entrusted more&mdash;her life," replied Dick, in a careless tone.
  "She would have bribed me to do murder."</p>

  <p>"Murder!" echoed Ranulph, aghast.</p>

  <p>"Ay, to murder your brother," returned Dick; "but let that pass. You have
  read that note. I have acted solely upon your mother's responsibility. Lady
  Rookwood's <i>honor</i> is pledged for my safety. Of course her son will set
  me free."</p>

  <p>"Never!"</p>

  <p>"Well, as you please. Your mother is in my power. Betray me, and you
  betray her."</p>

  <p>"No more!" returned Ranulph, sternly. "Go your ways. You are free."</p>

  <p>"Pledge me your word of honor I am safe." Ranulph had scarcely given his
  pledge, when Major Mowbray rode furiously up. A deep flush of anger burnt
  upon his cheeks; his sword was drawn in his hand. He glanced at Turpin, as if
  he would have felled him from his saddle.</p>

  <p>"This is the ruffian," cried the major, fiercely, "by whom I was attacked
  some months ago, and for whose apprehension the reward of three hundred
  pounds is offered by his majesty's proclamation, with a free pardon to his
  accomplices. This is Richard Turpin. He has just added another crime to his
  many offences. He has robbed my mother and sister. The postboy knew him the
  moment he came up. Where are they, villain? Whither are they
  gone?&mdash;answer!"</p>

  <p>"I know not," replied Turpin, calmly. "Did not the lad tell you they were
  rescued?"</p>

  <p>"Rescued!&mdash;by whom?" asked Ranulph, with great emotion.</p>

  <p>"By one who calls himself Sir Luke Rookwood," answered Turpin, with a
  meaning smile.</p>

  <p>"By him!" ejaculated Ranulph. "Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"I have already answered that question," said Dick. "I repeat, I know
  not."</p>

  <p>"You are my prisoner," cried the major, seizing Turpin's bridle.</p>

  <p>"I have Sir Ranulph's word for my safety," rejoined Turpin. "Let go my
  rein."</p>

  <p>"How is this?" asked Major Mowbray, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Ask me not. Release him," replied Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Ranulph," said the major, "you ask an impossibility. My honor&mdash;my
  duty&mdash;is implicated in this man's capture."</p>

  <p>"The honor of all of us is involved in his deliverance," returned Ranulph,
  in a whisper. "Let him go. I will explain all hereafter. Let us search for
  them&mdash;for Eleanor. Surely, after this, you will help us to find them,"
  added he, addressing Turpin.</p>

  <p>"I wish, with all my soul, I could do so," replied the highwayman.</p>

  <p>"I see'd the ladies cross the brook, and enter these old ruins,"
  interposed the postboy, who had now joined the party. "I see'd 'em from where
  I stood on the hill-side; and as I kept a pretty sharp look-out, and have a
  tolerably bright eye of my own, I don't think as how they ever comed out
  again."</p>

  <p>"Some one is hidden within yon fissure in the wall," exclaimed Ranulph; "I
  see a figure move."</p>

  <p>And he flung himself from his horse, rushing towards the mouth of the
  cell. Imitating his example, Major Mowbray followed his friend, sword in
  hand.</p>

  <p>"The game begins now in right earnest," said Dick to himself; "the old fox
  will be soon unearthed. I must look to my snappers." And he thrust his hand
  quietly into his pocket in search of a pistol.</p>

  <p>Just as Ranulph and the major reached the recess they were startled by the
  sudden apparition of the ill-fated attorney.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coates!" exclaimed Ranulph, in surprise. "What do you here, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;that is&mdash;Sir Ranulph&mdash;you must excuse me,
  sir&mdash;particular business&mdash;can't say," returned the trembling
  attorney; for at this instant his eye caught that of Turpin, and the ominous
  reflexion of a polished-steel barrel, held carelessly towards him. He was
  aware, also, that on the other hand he was, in like manner, the mark of Rust
  and Wilder; those polite gentlemen having threatened him with a brace of
  slugs in his brain if he dared to betray their hiding-place. "It is necessary
  that I should be <i>guarded</i> in my answers," murmured he.</p>

  <p>"Is there any one within that place besides yourself?" said the major,
  making a movement thither.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, nobody at all," answered Coates, hastily, fancying at the same
  time that he heard the click of the pistol that was to be his
  death-warrant.</p>

  <p>"How came you here, sir?" demanded Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean in this identical spot?" replied Coates, evasively.</p>

  <p>"You can have no difficulty in answering that question," said the major,
  sternly.</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, sir. I find considerable difficulty in answering any question,
  situated as I am."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Miss Mowbray?" asked Ranulph, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Or my mother?" said the major, in the same breath.</p>

  <p>"Neither," replied Coates, rather relieved by these questions.</p>

  <p>"I suspect you are deceiving us, sir," said the major. "Your manner is
  confused. I am convinced you know more of this matter than you choose to
  explain; and if you do not satisfy me at once, fully and explicitly, I vow to
  Heaven&mdash;&mdash;" and the major's sword described a glittering circle
  round his head.</p>

  <p>"Are you privy to their concealment?" asked Ranulph. "Have you seen aught
  of them, or of Luke Bradley?"</p>

  <p>"Speak, or this moment is your last," said the major.</p>

  <p>"If it <i>is</i> my last, I <i>cannot</i> speak," returned Coates. "I can
  make neither head nor tail of your questions, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"And you positively assure me you have not seen Mrs. Mowbray and her
  daughter?" said Ranulph.</p>

  <p>Turpin here winked at Coates. The attorney understood him.</p>

  <p>"I don't positively assert that," faltered he.</p>

  <p>"How!&mdash;you <i>have</i> seen them?" shouted Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Where are they?&mdash;in safety&mdash;speak!" added the major.</p>

  <p>Another expressive gesture from the highwayman communicated to the
  attorney the nature of his reply.</p>

  <p>"Without, sir&mdash;without&mdash;yonder," he replied. "I will show you
  myself. Follow, gentlemen, follow." And away scampered Coates, without once
  venturing to look behind him.</p>

  <p>In an instant the ruined hall was deserted, and Turpin alone left behind.
  In the excitement of the moment his presence had been forgotten. In an
  instant afterwards the <i>arena</i> was again occupied by a company equally
  numerous. Rust and Wilder issued from their hiding-places, followed by a
  throng of the gipsy crew.</p>

  <p>"Where is Sir Luke Rookwood?" asked Turpin.</p>

  <p>"He remains below," was the answer returned.</p>

  <p>"And Peter Bradley?"</p>

  <p>"Stays there likewise."</p>

  <p>"No matter. Now make ready, pals. Give 'em one shout&mdash;Hurrah!"</p>

  <p>"Hurrah!" replied the crowd, at the top of their voices.</p>

  <p>Ranulph Rookwood and his companions heard this shout. Mr. Coates had
  already explained the stratagem practised upon them by the wily highwayman,
  as well as the perilous situation in which he himself had been placed; and
  they were in the act of returning to make good his capture, when the loud
  shouts of the crew arrested them. From the clamor, it was evident that
  considerable reinforcement must have arrived from some unlooked-for quarter;
  and, although burning to be avenged upon the audacious highwayman, the major
  felt it would be a task of difficulty, and that extreme caution could alone
  ensure success. With difficulty restraining the impatience of Ranulph, who
  could scarcely brook these few minutes of needful delay, Major Mowbray gave
  particular instructions to each of the men in detail, and caused several of
  them to dismount. By this arrangement Mr. Coates found himself accommodated
  with a steed and a pair of pistols, with which latter he vowed to wreak his
  vengeance upon some of his recent tormentors. After a short space of time
  occupied in this manner, the troop slowly advanced towards the postern, in
  much better order than upon the previous occasion; but the stoutest of them
  quailed as they caught sight of the numerous gipsy-gang drawn out in battle
  array within the abbey walls. Each party scanned the other's movements in
  silence and wonder, anxiously awaiting, yet in a measure dreading, their
  leader's signal to begin. That signal was not long delayed. A shot from the
  ranks of Rookwood did instant and bitter execution. Rob Rust was stretched
  lifeless upon the ground. Nothing more was needed. The action now became
  general. Fire arms were discharged on both sides, without much damage to
  either party. But a rush being made by a detachment of horse, headed by Major
  Mowbray, the conflict soon became more serious. The gipsies, after the first
  fire, threw aside their pistols, and fought with long knives, with which they
  inflicted desperate gashes, both on men and horses. Major Mowbray was
  slightly wounded in the thigh, and his steed receiving the blow intended for
  himself, stumbled and threw his rider. Luckily for the major, Ranulph
  Rookwood was at hand, and with the butt-end of a heavy-handled pistol felled
  the ruffian to the earth, just as he was upon the point of repeating the
  thrust.</p>

  <p>Turpin, meanwhile, had taken comparatively a small share in the conflict.
  He seemed to content himself with acting upon the defensive, and except in
  the case of Titus Tyrconnel, whom, espying amidst the crowd, he had
  considerably alarmed by sending a bullet through his wig, he did not fire a
  single shot. He also succeeded in unhorsing Coates, by hurling, with great
  dexterity, the empty pistol at his head. Though apparently unconcerned in the
  skirmish, he did not flinch from it, but kept his ground unyieldingly. "A
  charmed life" he seemed to bear; for amid the shower of bullets, many of
  which were especially aimed at himself, he came off unhurt.</p>

  <p>"He that's born to be hanged will never be drowned, that's certain," said
  Titus. "It's no use trying to bring him down. But, by Jasus! he's spoiled my
  best hat and wig, anyhow. There's a hole in my beaver as big as a crown
  piece."</p>

  <p>"Your own crown's safe, and that's some satisfaction," said Coates;
  "whereas mine has a bump on it as large as a swan's egg. Ah! if we could only
  get behind him."</p>

  <p>The strife continued to rage without intermission; and though there were
  now several ghastly evidences of its fury, in the shape of wounded men and
  slaughtered or disabled horses, whose gaping wounds flooded the turf with
  gore, it was still difficult to see upon which side victory would eventually
  declare herself. The gipsies, though by far the greater sufferers of the two,
  firmly maintained their ground. Drenched in the blood of the horses they had
  wounded, and brandishing their long knives, they presented a formidable and
  terrific appearance, the effect of which was not at all diminished by their
  wild yells and savage gesticulations. On the other hand, headed by Major
  Mowbray and Ranulph, the troop of yeomen pressed on undauntedly; and where
  the sturdy farmers could get a firm gripe of their lithe antagonists, or
  deliver a blow with their ox-like fists, they seldom failed to make good the
  advantages which superior weight and strength gave them. It will thus be seen
  that as yet they were pretty well matched. Numbers were in favor of the
  gipsies, but courage was equally distributed, and, perhaps, what is
  emphatically called "bottom," was in favor of the rustics. Be this as it may,
  from what had already occurred, there was every prospect of a very serious
  termination to the fray.</p>

  <p>From time to time Turpin glanced to the entrance of the cell, in the
  expectation of seeing Sir Luke Rookwood make his appearance; and, as he was
  constantly disappointed in his expectation, he could not conceal his chagrin.
  At length he resolved to despatch a messenger to him, and one of the crew
  accordingly departed upon this errand. He returned presently with a look of
  blank dismay.</p>

  <p>In our hasty narrative of the fight we have not paused to particularize,
  neither have we enumerated, the list of the combatants. Amongst them,
  however, were Jerry Juniper, the knight of Malta, and Zoroaster. Excalibur,
  as may be conceived, had not been idle; but that trenchant blade had been
  shivered by Ranulph Rookwood in the early stage of the business, and the
  knight left weaponless. Zoroaster, who was not merely a worshipper of fire,
  but a thorough milling-cove, had engaged to some purpose in a pugilistic
  encounter with the rustics; and, having fought several rounds, now "bore his
  blushing honors thick upon him." Jerry, like Turpin, had remained tolerably
  quiescent. "The proper moment," he said, "had not arrived." A fatality seemed
  to attend Turpin's immediate companions. Rust was the first who fell; Wilder
  also was now among the slain. Things were precisely in this condition when
  the messenger returned. A marked change was instantly perceptible in Turpin's
  manner. He no longer looked on with indifference. He seemed angry and
  distrustful. He gnawed his lip, ever a sign with him of vexation. Addressing
  a few words to those about him, he then spoke more loudly to the rest of the
  crew. Being in the jargon of the tawny tribe, his words were not intelligible
  to the opposite party; but their import was soon made known by the almost
  instant and total relinquishment of the field by the gipsies. They took to
  their heels at once, to a man, leaving only a few desperately wounded behind
  them; and, flying along the intricate ruins of the priory, baffled all
  pursuit, wherever it was attempted. Jerry Juniper was the last in the
  retreat; but, upon receiving a hint from Dick, he vaulted like a roe over the
  heads of his adversaries, and made good his escape. Turpin alone remained. He
  stood like a lion at bay, quietly regarding the huntsmen hurtling around him.
  Ranulph Rookwood rode up and bade him surrender.</p>

  <p>"Detain me not," cried he, in a voice of thunder. "If you would save her
  who is dear to you, descend into that vault. Off, I say."</p>

  <p>And Turpin shook away, with ease, the grasp that Ranulph had laid upon
  him.</p>

  <p>"Villain! you do not escape me this time," said Major Mowbray, interposing
  himself between Turpin and the outlet.</p>

  <p>"Major Mowbray, I would not have your blood upon my head," said Dick. "Let
  me pass," and he levelled a pistol.</p>

  <p>"Fire, if you dare!" said the major, raising his sword. "You pass not. I
  will die rather than allow you to escape. Barricade the door. Strike him down
  if he attempts to pass. Richard Turpin, I arrest you in the king's name. You
  hear, my lads, in his majesty's name. I command you to assist me in this
  highwayman's capture. Two hundred pounds for his head."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred devils!" exclaimed Dick, with a laugh of disdain. "Go, seek
  your mother and sister within yon vault, Major Mowbray; you will find
  employment enough there."</p>

  <p>Saying which, he suddenly forced Bess to back a few yards; then, striking
  his heels sharply into her sides, ere his purpose could be divined by the
  spectators, charged, and cleared the lower part of the mouldering priory
  walls. This feat was apparently accomplished with no great effort by his
  admirable and unequalled mare.</p>

  <p>"By the powers!" cried Titus, "and he's given us the slip after all. And
  just when we thought to make sure of him, too. Why, Mr. Coates, that wall
  must be higher than a five-barred gate, or any stone wall in my own country.
  It's just the most extraordinary lepp I ever set eyes on!"</p>

  <p>"The devil's in the fellow, certainly, or in his mare," returned Coates;
  "but if he escapes me, I'll forgive him. I know whither he's bound. He's off
  to London with my bill of exchange. I'll be up with him. I'll track him like
  a bloodhound, slowly and surely, as my father, the thief-taker, used to
  follow up a scent. Recollect the hare and the tortoise. The race is not
  always to the swift. What say you? 'Tis a match for five hundred pounds; nay,
  for five thousand: for there is a certain marriage certificate in the
  way&mdash;a glorious golden venture! You shall go halves, if we win. We'll
  have him, dead or alive. What say you for London, Mr. Tyrconnel? Shall we
  start at once?"</p>

  <p>"With all my sowl," replied Titus. "I'm with you." And away this <i>par
  nobile</i> scoured.</p>

  <p>Ranulph, meantime, plunged into the vault. The floor was slippery, and he
  had nigh stumbled. Loud and deep lamentations, and a wailing sound, like that
  of a lament for the dead, resounded in his ears. A light at the further
  extremity of the vault attracted his attention. He was filled with terrible
  forebodings; but the worst reality was not so terrible as suspense. He rushed
  towards the light. He passed the massive pillars, and there, by the ruddy
  torch flame, discovered two female figures. One was an old woman,
  fantastically attired, wringing her hands, and moaning, or gibbering wild
  strains in broken, discordant, yet pathetic tones. The other was Mrs.
  Mowbray. Both were images of despair. Before them lay some motionless object.
  He noticed not that old woman; he scarcely saw Mrs. Mowbray; he beheld only
  that object of horror. It was the lifeless body of a female. The light fell
  imperfectly upon the face; he could not discern the features, but the veil in
  which it was swathed: that veil was Eleanor's! He asked no more.</p>

  <p>With a wild cry he rushed forward. "Eleanor, my beloved!" shrieked he.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray started at his voice, but appeared stunned and helpless.</p>

  <p>"She is dead," said Ranulph, stooping towards the body.
  "Dead&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>"Ay," echoed the old woman, in accents of equal
  anguish&mdash;"dead&mdash;dead!"</p>

  <p>"But this is <i>not</i> Eleanor," exclaimed he, as he viewed the features
  more closely. "This face, though beautiful, is not hers. This dishevelled
  hair is black. The long lashes that shade her cheek are of the same hue. She
  is scarce dead. The hand I clasp is yet warm&mdash;the fingers are
  pliant."</p>

  <p>"Yet she is dead," said the old woman, in a broken voice, "she is
  slain."</p>

  <p>"Who hath slain her?" asked Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;her mother, slew her."</p>

  <p>"You!" exclaimed Ranulph, horror-stricken. "And where is Eleanor?" asked
  he. "Was she not here?"</p>

  <p>"Better she were here now, even though she were as that poor maid,"
  groaned Mrs. Mowbray, "than where she is."</p>

  <p>"Where is she, then?" asked Ranulph, with frantic eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Fled. Whither I know not."</p>

  <p>"With whom?"</p>

  <p>"With Sir Luke Rookwood&mdash;with Alan Rookwood. They have borne her
  hence. Ranulph, you are too late."</p>

  <p>"Gone!" cried Ranulph, fiercely springing to his feet. "How escaped they?
  There appears to be but one entrance to this vault. I will search each nook
  and cranny."</p>

  <p>"'Tis vain," replied Mrs. Mowbray. "There is another outlet through yon
  cell. By that passage they escaped."</p>

  <p>"Too true, too true," shouted Ranulph, who flew to examine the cell. "And
  wherefore followed you not?"</p>

  <p>"The stone rolled to its mouth, and resisted my efforts. I could not
  follow."</p>

  <p>"Torture and death! She is lost to me for ever!" cried Ranulph,
  bitterly.</p>

  <p>"No!" exclaimed Barbara, clutching his arm. "Place your trust in me, and I
  will find her for you."</p>

  <p>"You!" ejaculated Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Even I," replied Barbara. "Your wrongs shall be righted&mdash;my Sybil be
  avenged."</p><a id="ch4-1"

  <p class="first">THE present straggling suburb at the north-west of the
  metropolis, known as Kilburn, had scarcely been called into existence a
  century ago, and an ancient hostel, with a few detached farmhouses, were the
  sole habitations to be found in the present populous vicinage. The place of
  refreshment for the ruralizing cockney of 1737 was a substantial-looking
  tenement of the good old stamp, with great bay windows, and a balcony in
  front, bearing as its ensign the jovial visage of the lusty knight, Jack
  Falstaff. Shaded by a spreading elm, a circular bench embraced the aged trunk
  of the tree, sufficiently tempting, no doubt, to incline the wanderer on
  those dusty ways to "rest and be thankful," and to cry <i>encore</i> to a
  frothing tankard of the best ale to be obtained within the chimes of Bow
  bells.</p>

  <p>Upon a table, green as the privet and holly that formed the walls of the
  bower in which it was placed, stood a great china bowl, one of those
  leviathan memorials of bygone wassailry which we may sometimes
  espy&mdash;reversed in token of its desuetude&mdash;perched on the top of an
  old japanned closet, but seldom, if ever, encountered in its proper position
  at the genial board. All the appliances of festivity were at hand. Pipes and
  rummers strewed the board. Perfume, subtle, yet mellow, as of pine and lime,
  exhaled from out the bowl, and, mingling with the scent of a neighboring bed
  of mignonette and the subdued odor of the Indian weed, formed altogether as
  delectable an atmosphere of sweets as one could wish to inhale on a melting
  August afternoon. So, at least, thought the inmates of the arbor; nor did
  they by any means confine themselves to the gratification of a single sense.
  The ambrosial contents of the china bowl proved as delicious to the taste as
  its bouquet was grateful to the smell; while the eyesight was soothed by
  reposing on the smooth sward of a bowling-green spread out immediately before
  it, or in dwelling upon gently undulating meads, terminating, at about a
  mile's distance, in the woody, spire-crowned heights of Hampstead.</p>

  <p>At the left of the table was seated, or rather lounged, a slender,
  elegant-looking young man, with dark, languid eyes, sallow complexion, and
  features wearing that peculiarly pensive expression often communicated by
  dissipation; an expression which, we regret to say, is sometimes found more
  pleasing than it ought to be in the eyes of the gentle sex. Habited in a
  light summer riding-dress, fashioned according to the taste of the time, of
  plain and unpretending material, and rather under than overdressed, he had,
  perhaps, on that very account, perfectly the air of a gentleman. There was,
  altogether, an absence of pretension about him, which, combined with great
  apparent self-possession, contrasted very forcibly with the vulgar assurance
  of his showy companions. The figure of the youth was slight, even to
  fragility, giving little outward manifestation of the vigor of frame he in
  reality possessed. This spark was a no less distinguished personage than Tom
  King, a noted high-tobygloak of his time, who obtained, from his appearance
  and address, the <i>sobriquet</i> of the "Gentleman Highwayman."</p>

  <p>Tom was indeed a pleasant fellow in his day. His career was brief, but
  brilliant: your meteors are ever momentary. He was a younger son of a good
  family; had good blood in his veins, though not a groat in his pockets.
  According to the old song&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">When he arrived at man's estate,<br>
  It was <i>all the estate</i> he had;</p>

  <p class="first">and all the estate he was ever likely to have. Nevertheless,
  if he had no income, he contrived, as he said, to live as if he had the mines
  of Peru at his control&mdash;a miracle not solely confined to himself. For a
  moneyless man, he had rather expensive habits. He kept his three nags; and,
  if fame does not belie him, a like number of mistresses; nay, if we are to
  place any faith in certain scandalous chronicles to which we have had access,
  he was for some time the favored lover of a celebrated actress, who, for the
  time, supplied him with the means of keeping up his showy establishment. But
  things could not long hold thus. Tom was a model of infidelity, and that was
  the only failing his mistress could not overlook. She dismissed him at a
  moment's notice. Unluckily, too, he had other propensities which contributed
  to involve him. He had a taste for the turf&mdash;a taste for play&mdash;was
  well known in the hundreds of Drury, and cut no mean figure at Howell's, and
  the faro tables there-anent. He was the glory of the Smyrna, D'Osyndar's, and
  other chocolate houses of the day; and it was at this time he fell into the
  hands of certain dexterous sharpers, by whom he was at first plucked and
  subsequently patronized. Under their tuition he improved wonderfully. He
  turned his wit and talent to some account. He began to open his eyes. His
  nine days' blindness was over. The dog saw. But, in spite of his quickness,
  he was at length discovered, and ejected from Howell's in a manner that left
  him no alternative. He must either have called out his adversary, or have
  gone out himself. He preferred the latter, and took to the road; and in his
  new line he was eminently successful. Fortunately, he had no scruples to get
  over. Tom had what Sir Walter Scott happily denominates "an indistinct notion
  of <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>," and became confirmed in the opinion that
  everything he could lay hands upon constituted lawful spoil. And then, even
  those he robbed, admitted that he was the most gentlemanlike highwayman they
  had ever the fortune to meet with, and trusted they might always be so lucky.
  So popular did he become upon the road, that it was accounted a distinction
  to be stopped by him; he made a point of robbing none but gentlemen,
  and&mdash;Tom's shade would quarrel with us were we to omit
  them&mdash;ladies. His acquaintance with Turpin was singular, and originated
  in a rencontre. Struck with his appearance, Dick presented a pistol, and bade
  King deliver. The latter burst into a laugh, and an explanation immediately
  ensued. Thenceforward they became sworn brothers&mdash;the Pylades and
  Orestes of the road; and though seldom seen together in public, had many a
  merry moonlight ride in company.</p>

  <p>Tom still maintained three mistresses, his valet, his groom&mdash;tiger,
  we should have called him,&mdash;"and many a change of clothes besides," says
  his biographer, "with which he appeared more like a lord than a highwayman."
  And what more, we should like to know, would a lord wish to have? Few younger
  sons, we believe, can boast so much; and it is chiefly on their account, with
  some remote view to the benefit of the unemployed youth of all professions,
  that we have enlarged so much upon Tom King's history. The road, we must beg
  to repeat, is still open; the chances are greater than they ever were; we
  fully believe it is <i>their</i> only road to preferment, and we are sadly in
  want of highwaymen!</p>

  <p>Fancy Tom lounging at D'Osyndar's, carelessly tapping his boots on the
  steps; there he stands! Is he not a devilish good-looking, gentlemanlike sort
  of fellow? You could never have taken him for a highwayman but for our
  information. A waiter appears&mdash;supper is ordered at twelve&mdash;a
  broiled chicken and a bottle of Burgundy&mdash;his groom brings his nags to
  the door&mdash;he mounts. It is his custom to ride out on an evening&mdash;he
  is less liable to interruption.[93] At Marylebone Fields&mdash;now the
  Regent's Park,&mdash;his groom leaves him. He has a mistress in the
  neighborhood. He is absent for a couple of hours, and returns gay or
  dispirited, as his luck may have turned out. At twelve he is at supper, and
  has the night before him. How very easy all this seems. Can it be possible we
  have no Tom Kings?</p>

  <p>To return to Tom as he was in the arbor. Judging from his manner, he
  appeared to be almost insensible to the presence of his companions, and to be
  scarcely a partaker in their revelry. His back was towards his immediate
  neighbor; his glass sparkled untouched at his elbow; and one hand,
  beautifully white and small, a mark of his birth and
  breeding&mdash;<i>crede</i> Byron&mdash;rested upon the edge of the table,
  while his thin, delicate digits, palpably demonstrative of his faculty of
  adaptation&mdash;<i>crede</i> James Hardy Vaux&mdash;were employed with a
  silver toothpick. In other respects, he seemed to be lost in reverie, and
  was, in all probability, meditating new exploits.</p>

  <p>Next to King sat our old friend Jerry Juniper; not, however, the Jerry of
  the gipsies, but a much more showy-looking personage. Jerry was no longer a
  gentleman of "three <i>outs</i>"&mdash;the difficulty would now have been to
  say what he was "without." Snakelike he had cast his slough, and rejoiced in
  new and brilliant investiture. His were "speaking garments, speaking pockets
  too." His linen was of the finest, his hose of the smartest. Gay rings
  glittered on his fingers; a crystal snuff-box underwent graceful
  manipulation; a handsome gold repeater was sometimes drawn from its location
  with a monstrous bunch of onions&mdash;<i>anglicè</i>, seals&mdash;depending
  from its massive chain. Lace adorned his wrists, and shoes&mdash;of which
  they had been long unconscious,&mdash;with buckles nearly as large as
  themselves, confined his feet. A rich-powdered peruke and silver-hilted sword
  completed the gear of the transmogrified Jerry, or, as he now chose to be
  designated, Count Albert Conyers. The fact was, that Jerry, after the
  <i>fracas</i>, apprehensive that the country would be too hot for him, had,
  in company with Zoroaster, quitted the ranks of the Canting Crew, and made
  the best of his way to town. A lucky <i>spice</i> on the road set them up;
  and having some acquaintance with Tom King, the party, on their arrival,
  sought him out at his customary haunt, D'Osyndar's, and enlisted under his
  banners.</p>

  <p>Tom received them with open arms, gave them unlimited use of his wardrobe,
  and only required a little trifling assistance in return. He had a grand
  scheme <i>in petto</i>, in the execution of which they could mainly assist
  him. Jerry was a <i>Greek</i> by nature, and could <i>land</i> a flat as well
  as the best of them. Zoroaster was just the man to <i>lose</i> a fight; or,
  in the language of the <i>Fancy</i>, to <i>play a cross</i>. No two
  <i>legs</i> could serve Tom's purposes better. He welcomed them with
  fraternal affection.</p>

  <p>We will now proceed to reconnoitre Jerry's opposite neighbor, who was,
  however, no other than that Upright Man,</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">The Magus Zoroaster, that great name.</p>

  <p>Changed as was Juniper, the Magus was yet more whimsically metamorphosed.
  Some traces of Jerry still remained, but not a vestige was left of the
  original Dimber Damber. His tawny mother had not known her son. This
  alteration, however, was not owing to change of dress; it was the result of
  the punishment he had received at the "<i>set-to</i>" at the priory. Not a
  feature was in its place; his swollen lip trespassed upon the precincts of
  his nose; his nose trod hard upon his cheek; while his cheek again, not to be
  behind the rest, rose up like an apple-dumpling under his single
  eye,&mdash;single, we say&mdash;for, alas! there was no speculation in the
  other. His dexter daylight was utterly darkened, and, indeed, the orb that
  remained was as sanguinary a luminary as ever struggled through a London fog
  at noonday. To borrow a couplet or so from the laureate of the
  <i>Fancy</i>:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">&mdash;&mdash;One of his peepers was put<br>
  On the bankruptcy list, with his shop windows shut,<br>
  While the other made nearly as tag-rag a show,<br>
  All rimmed round with black like the <i>Courier</i> in woe.</p><br>

  <p>One black patch decorated his rainbow-colored cheek; another adorned his
  chin; a grinder having been dislodged, his pipe took possession of the
  aperture. His toggery was that of a member of the prize-ring; what we now
  call a "belcher" bound his throat; a spotted <i>fogle</i> bandaged his
  <i>jobbernowl</i>, and shaded his right peeper, while a white beaver crowned
  the occiput of the Magus. And though, at first sight, there would appear to
  be some incongruity in the association of such a battered character as the
  Upright Man with his smart companions, the reader's wonder will rapidly
  diminish, when he reflects that any distinguished P. C. man can ever find a
  ready passport to the most exclusive society. Viewed in this light,
  Zoroaster's familiarity with his <i>swell</i> acquaintance occasioned no
  surprise to old Simon Carr, the bottle-nosed landlord of the Falstaff, who
  was a man of discernment in his way, and knew a thing or two. Despite such
  striking evidences to the contrary, the Magus was perfectly at his ease, and
  sacrificing as usual to the god of flame. His mithra, or pipe, the symbol of
  his faith, was zealously placed between his lips, and never did his Chaldean,
  Bactrian, Persian, Pamphylian, Proconnesian, or Babylonian namesake,
  whichever of the six was the true
  Zoroaster&mdash;<i>vide</i>Bayle,&mdash;respire more fervently at the altar
  of fire, than our Magus at the end of his enkindled tube. In his creed we
  believe Zoroaster was a dualist, and believed in the co-existence and
  mystical relation of the principles of good and ill; his pipe being his
  Yezdan, or benign influence; his empty pouch his Ahreman, or the devil. We
  shall not pause to examine his tenets; we meddle with no man's religious
  opinions, and shall leave the Magus to the enjoyment of his own sentiments,
  be they what they may.</p>

  <p>One guest alone remains, and him we shall briefly dismiss. The reader, we
  imagine, will scarcely need to be told who was the owner of those keen gray
  eyes; those exuberant red whiskers; that airy azure frock. It was</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Our brave co-partner of the roads.<br>
  Skilful surveyor of highways and hedges;</p>

  <p class="first">in a word&mdash;Dick Turpin!</p>

  <p>Dick had been called upon to act as president of the board, and an
  excellent president he made, sedulously devoting himself to the due
  administration of the punch-bowl. Not a rummer was allowed to stand empty for
  an instant. Toast, sentiment, and anacreontic song, succeeded each other at
  speedy intervals; but there was no speechifying&mdash;no politics. He left
  church and state to take care of themselves. Whatever his politics might be,
  Dick never allowed them to interfere with his pleasures. His maxim was to
  make the most of the passing moment; the <i>dum vivimus vivamus</i> was never
  out of his mind; a precautionary measure which we recommend to the adoption
  of all gentlemen of the like, or any other precarious profession.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding all Dick's efforts to promote conviviality, seconded by
  the excellence of the beverage itself, conversation, somehow or other, began
  to flag; from being general it became particular. Tom King, who was no
  punch-bibber, especially at that time of day, fell into a deep reverie; your
  gamesters often do so; while the Magus, who had smoked himself drowsy, was
  composing himself to a doze. Turpin seized this opportunity of addressing a
  few words on matters of business to Jerry Juniper, or, as he now chose to be
  called, Count Conyers.</p>

  <p>"My dear count," said Dick, in a low and confidential tone, "you are aware
  that my errand to town is accomplished. I have <i>smashed</i> Lawyer Coates's
  <i>screen</i>, pocketed the <i>dimmock</i>&mdash;here 'tis," continued he,
  parenthetically, slapping his pockets,&mdash;"and done t'other trick in prime
  twig for Tom King. With a cool thousand in hand, I might, if I chose, rest
  awhile on my oars. But a quiet life don't suit me. I must be moving. So I
  shall start to Yorkshire to-night."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said the <i>soi-disant</i> count, in a languid tone&mdash;"so
  soon?"</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to detain me," replied Dick. "And, to tell you the truth,
  I want to see how matters stand with Sir Luke Rookwood. I should be sorry if
  he went to the wall for want of any assistance I can render him."</p>

  <p>"True," returned the count; "one would regret such an occurrence,
  certainly. But I fear your assistance may arrive a little too late. He is
  pretty well done up, I should imagine, by this time."</p>

  <p>"That remains to be seen," said Turpin. "His case is a bad one, to be
  sure, but I trust not utterly hopeless. With all his impetuosity and pride, I
  like the fellow, and will help him, if I can. It will be a difficult game to
  set him on his legs, but I think it may be done. That underground marriage
  was sheer madness, and turned out as ill as such a scheme might have been
  expected to do. Poor Sybil! if I could pipe an eye for anything, it should be
  for her. I can't get her out of my head. Give me a pinch of snuff. Such
  thoughts unman one. As to the priest, that's a totally different affair. If
  he strangled his daughter, old Alan did right to take the law into his own
  hands, and throttle him in return. I'd have done the same thing myself; and,
  being a proscribed Jesuit, returned, as I understand, without the king's
  license for so doing, why Father Checkley's murder&mdash;if it must be so
  called, I can't abide hard terms&mdash;won't lie very heavy at Alan's door.
  That, however, has nothing to do with Sir Luke. He was neither accessory nor
  principal. Still he will be in danger, at least from Lady Rookwood. The whole
  county of York, I make no doubt, is up in arms by this time."</p>

  <p>"Then why go thither?" asked the count, somewhat ironically; "for my part,
  I've a strange fancy for keeping out of harm's way as long as possible."</p>

  <p>"Every man to his taste," returned Turpin; "I love to confront danger. Run
  away! pshaw! always meet your foe."</p>

  <p>"True," replied the count, "half-way! but you go the whole distance. What
  prudent man would beard the lion in his den?"</p>

  <p>"I never was a prudent man," rejoined Dick, smiling; "I have no
  superfluous caution about me. Come what will, I shall try to find out this
  Luke Rookwood, and offer him my purse, such as it is, and it is now better
  lined than usual; a hand free to act as he lists; and a head which, imprudent
  though it be, can often think better for others than for its own master."</p>

  <p>"Vastly fine!" exclaimed the count, with an ill-disguised sneer. "I hope
  you don't forget that the marriage certificate which you hold is perfectly
  valueless now. The estates, you are aware&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are no longer Sir Luke's. I see what you are driving at, count," returned
  Dick, coldly. "But he will need it to establish his claim to the title, and
  he shall have it. While he was Sir Luke, with ten thousand a year, I drove a
  hard bargain, and would have stood out for the last stiver. Now that he is
  one of '<i>us</i>', a mere Knight of the Road, he shall have it and
  welcome."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Lady Rookwood, or Mrs. Mowbray, might be inclined to treat,"
  maliciously insinuated the count; "the title may be worth something to
  Ranulph."</p>

  <p>"It is worth more to Luke; and if it were <i>not</i>, he gets it. Are you
  satisfied?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," replied the count, with affected <i>bonhomie</i>; "and I will
  now let you into a secret respecting Miss Mowbray, from which you may gather
  something for your guidance in this matter; and if the word of a woman is at
  all to be trusted, though individually I cannot say I have much faith in it,
  Sir Luke's planetary hour is not yet completely overcast."</p>

  <p>"That's exactly what I wish to know, my dear fellow," said Turpin,
  eagerly. "You have already told me you were witness to a singular interview
  between Miss Mowbray and Sir Luke after my departure from the priory. If I
  mistook you not, the whole business will hinge upon that. What occurred? Let
  me have every particular. The whole history and mystery."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it with pleasure," said the count; "and I hope it may tend
  to your benefit. After I had quitted the scene of action at the priory, and
  at your desire left the Rookwood party masters of the field, I fled with the
  rest of the crew towards the rocks. There we held a council of war for a
  short time. Some were for returning to the fight; but this was negatived
  entirely, and in the end it was agreed that those who had wives, daughters,
  and sisters, should join them as speedily as possible at their retreat in the
  Grange. As I happened to have none of these attractive ties, and had only a
  troublesome mistress, who I thought could take care of herself, I did not
  care to follow them, but struck deeper into the wood, and made my way, guided
  by destiny, I suppose, towards the cave."</p>

  <p>"The cave!" cried Dick, rubbing his hands; "I delight in a cave. Tom King
  and I once had a cave of our own at Epping, and I'll have another one of
  these fine days. A cave is as proper to a high-tobyman as a castle to a
  baron. Pray go on."</p>

  <p>"The cave I speak of," continued the count, "was seldom used, except upon
  great emergencies, by any of the Stop Hole Abbey crew. It was a sort of
  retiring den of our old lioness Barbara, and, like all belonging to her,
  respected by her dupes. However, the cave is a good cave for all that; is
  well concealed by brushwood, and comfortably lighted from a crevice in the
  rock above; it lies near the brink of the stream, amongst the woods just
  above the waterfall, and is somewhat difficult of approach."</p>

  <p>"I know something of the situation," said Turpin.</p>

  <p>"Well," returned the count, "not to lose time, into this den I crept, and,
  expecting to find it vacant, you may imagine my surprise on discovering that
  it was already occupied, and that Sir Luke Rookwood, his granddad, old Alan,
  Miss Mowbray, and, worst of all, the very person I wished most to avoid, my
  old flame Handassah, constituted the party. Fortunately, they did not
  perceive my entrance, and I took especial care not to introduce myself.
  Retreat, however, was for the moment impracticable, and I was compelled to be
  a listener. I cannot tell what had passed between the parties before my
  arrival, but I heard Miss Mowbray implore Sir Luke to conduct her to her
  mother. He seemed half inclined to comply with her entreaties; but old Alan
  shook his head. It was then Handassah put in a word; the minx was ever ready
  at that. 'Fear not,' said she, 'that she will wed Sir Ranulph. Deliver her to
  her friends, I beseech you, Sir Luke, and woo her honorably. She will accept
  you.' Sir Luke stared incredulously, and grim old Alan smiled. 'She has sworn
  to be yours,' continued Handassah; 'sworn it by every hope of heaven, and the
  oath has been sealed by blood&mdash;by Sybil's blood.'&mdash;'Does she speak
  the truth?' asked Sir Luke, trembling with agitation. Miss Mowbray answered
  not. 'You will not deny it, lady,' said Handassah. 'I heard that oath
  proposed. I saw it registered. You cannot deny it.'&mdash;'I do not,' replied
  Miss Mowbray, with much anguish of manner; 'if he claim me, I am
  his.'&mdash;'And he will claim you,' said Alan Rookwood, triumphantly. 'He
  has your oath, no matter how extorted&mdash;you must fulfil your
  vow.'&mdash;'I am prepared to do so,' said Eleanor. 'But if you would not
  utterly destroy me, let this maid conduct me to my mother, to my
  friends.'&mdash;'To Ranulph?' asked Sir Luke, bitterly.&mdash;'No, no,'
  returned Miss Mowbray, in accents of deepest despair, 'to my mother&mdash;I
  wish not to behold him again.'&mdash;'Be it so,' cried Sir Luke; 'but
  remember, in love or hate, you are mine; I shall claim the fulfilment of your
  oath. Farewell. Handassah will lead you to your mother.' Miss Mowbray bowed
  her head, but returned no answer, while, followed by old Alan, Sir Luke
  departed from the cavern."</p>

  <p>"Whither went they?" demanded Turpin.</p>

  <p>"That I know not," replied Jerry. "I was about to follow, when I was
  prevented by the abrupt entrance of another party. Scarcely, I think, could
  the two Rookwoods have made good their retreat, when shouts were heard
  without, and young Ranulph and Major Mowbray forced their way, sword in hand,
  into the cave. Here was a situation&mdash;for <i>me</i>, I mean&mdash;to the
  young lady, I make no doubt, it was pleasant enough. But my neck was in
  jeopardy. However, you know I am not deficient in strength, and, upon the
  present occasion, I made the best use of the agility with which nature has
  endowed me. Amidst the joyous confusion&mdash;the sobbings, and embracings,
  and congratulations that ensued&mdash;I contrived, like a wild cat, to climb
  the rocky sides of the cave, and concealed myself behind a jutting fragment
  of stone. It was well I did so, for scarcely was I hidden, when in came old
  Barbara, followed by Mrs. Mowbray, and a dozen others."</p>

  <p>"Barbara!" ejaculated Dick. "Was she a prisoner?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Jerry; "the old hell-cat is too deep for that. She had
  betrayed Sir Luke, and hoped they would seize him and his granddad. But the
  birds were flown."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad she was baulked," said Dick. "Was any search made after
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say," replied Jerry. "I could only indistinctly catch the sounds of
  their voices from my lofty retreat. Before they left the cavern, I made out
  that Mrs. Mowbray resolved to go to Rookwood, and to take her daughter
  thither&mdash;a proceeding to which the latter demurred."</p>

  <p>"To Rookwood," said Dick, musingly. "Will she keep her oath, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>"That's more than I can say," said Jerry, sipping his punch. "'Tis a
  deceitful sex!"</p>

  <p>"'Tis a deceitful sex, indeed," echoed Dick, tossing off a tumbler. "For
  one Sybil we meet with twenty Handassahs, eh, count?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty!&mdash;say rather a hundred," replied Jerry. "'Tis a vile
  sex."</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Grimm.</i> How gloriously the sun sets to-night.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Moor.</i> When I was a boy, my favorite thought was, that
  I should live and die like yonder glorious orb. It was a boyish thought.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Grimm.</i> True, captain.</p>

  <p class="quote">&mdash;<i>The Robbers.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">"PEACE, base calumniators," exclaimed Tom King, aroused from
  his toothpick reverie by these aspersions of the best part of creation.
  "Peace, I say. None shall dare abuse that dear devoted sex in the hearing of
  their champion, without pricking a lance with him in their behalf. What do
  you, either of you, who abuse woman in that wholesale style, know of her?
  Nothing&mdash;less than nothing; and yet you venture, upon your paltry
  experience, to lift up your voices and decry the sex. Now I <i>do</i> know
  her; and upon my own experience avouch, that, as a sex, woman, compared with
  man, is as an angel to a devil. As a sex, woman is faithful, loving,
  self-sacrificing. <i>We</i> 'tis that make her otherwise; <i>we</i>, selfish,
  exacting, neglectful men; we teach her indifference, and then blame her apt
  scholarship. We spoil our own hand, and then blame the cards. No abuse of
  women in my hearing. Give me a glass of grog, Dick. 'The sex!&mdash;three
  times three!'&mdash;and here's a song for you into the bargain." Saying
  which, in a mellow, plaintive tone, Tom gave the following:</p>

  <h3>PLEDGE OF THE HIGHWAYMAN</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">Come, fill up a bumper to Eve's fairest
     daughters,<br>
  Who have lavished their smiles on the brave and the free;<br>
  Toast the sweethearts of <span class="smcap">Dudley, Hind, Wilmot</span>, and
  <span class="smcap">Waters</span>,[94]<br>
  Whate'er their attraction, whate'er their degree.<br>
  Pledge! pledge in a bumper, each kind-hearted maiden,<br>
  Whose bright eyes were dimmed at the highwayman's fall;<br>
  Who stood by the gallows with sorrow o'erladen,<br>
  Bemoaning the fate of the gallant <span class="smcap">Du-Val!</span></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">Here's to each lovely lass chance of war bringeth
     near one,<br>
  Whom, with manner impassioned, we tenderly stop;<br>
  And to whom, like the lover addressing his dear one,<br>
  In terms of entreaty <i>the question</i> we pop.<br>
  How oft, in such case, rosy lips have proved sweeter<br>
  Than the rosiest book, bright eyes saved a bright ring;<br>
  While that <i>one other</i> kiss has brought off a <i>repeater</i>,<br>
  And a bead as a <i>favor</i>&mdash;the <i>favorite</i> string.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">With our hearts ready rifled, each pocket we
     rifle,<br>
  With the pure flame of chivalry stirring our breasts;<br>
  Life's risk for our <i>mistress's praise</i> is a trifle;<br>
  And each purse as a <i>trophy</i> our <i>homage</i> attests.<br>
  Then toss off your glasses to all girls of spirit,<br>
  Ne'er with names, or with number, your memories vex;<br>
  Our toast, boys, embraces each woman of merit,<br>
  And, for fear of omission, we'll drink the <span class="smcap">whole
  sex</span>.</p><br>

  <p>"Well," replied Dick, replenishing King's rummer, while he laughed
  heartily at his ditty, "I shan't refuse your toast, though my heart don't
  respond to your sentiments. Ah, Tom! the sex you praise so much will, I fear,
  prove your undoing. Do as you please, but curse me if ever I pin my life to a
  petticoat. I'd as soon think of neglecting the four cautions."</p>

  <p>"The four cautions," said King; "what are they?"</p>

  <p>"Did you never hear them?" replied Dick. "Attend, then, and be
  edified."</p>

  <h3>THE FOUR CAUTIONS</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Pay attention to these cautions four,<br>
  And through life you will need little more,<br>
  Should you dole out your days to threescore<br>
  Beware of a pistol before!<br>
  Before! before!<br>
  Beware of a pistol before!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">And when backward his ears are inclined,<br>
  And his tail with his ham is combined,<br>
  Caution two you will bear in your mind:<br>
  Beware of a prancer behind!<br>
  Behind! behind!<br>
  Beware of a prancer behind!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Thirdly, when in the park you may ride,<br>
  On your best bit of blood, sir, astride,<br>
  Chatting gay to your old friend's young bride:<br>
  Beware of a coach at the side!<br>
  At the side! at the side!<br>
  Beware of a coach at the side!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Lastly, whether in purple or gray,<br>
  Canter, ranter, grave, solemn, or gay,<br>
  Whate'er he may do or may say,<br>
  Beware of a priest every way!<br>
  Every way! every way!<br>
  Beware of a priest every way!</p><br>

  <p>"Well," said Tom King, "all you can sing or say don't alter my good
  opinion of the women. Not a secret have I from the girl of my heart. She
  could have sold me over and over again if she had chosen, but my sweet Sue is
  not the wench to do that."</p>

  <p>"It is not too late," said Dick. "Your Delilah may yet hand you over to
  the Philistines."</p>

  <p>"Then I shall die in a good cause," said King; "but</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">The Tyburn Tree<br>
  Has no terrors for me,<br>
  Let better men swing&mdash;I'm at liberty.</p>

  <p>"I shall never come to the scragging-post, unless you turn topsman, Dick
  Turpin. My nativity has been cast, and the stars have declared I am to die by
  the hand of my best friend&mdash;and that's you&mdash;eh? Dick?"</p>

  <p>"It sounds like it," replied Turpin; "but I advise you not to become too
  intimate with Jack Ketch. He may prove your best friend, after all."</p>

  <p>"Why, faith, that's true," replied King, laughing; "and if I must ride
  backwards up Holborn Hill, I'll do the thing in style, and honest Jack Ketch
  shall never want his dues. A man should always die game. We none of us know
  how soon our turn may come; but come when it will, <i>I</i> shall never
  flinch from it.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">As the highwayman's life is the fullest of
     zest,<br>
  So the highwayman's death is the briefest and best;<br>
  He dies not as other men die, by degrees,<br>
  But at once! without flinching&mdash;and quite at his ease!</p><br>

  <p>as the song you are so fond of says. When I die it will not be of
  consumption. And if the surgeon's knife must come near me, it will be after
  death. There's some comfort in that reflection, at all events."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Turpin, "and, with a little alteration, my song would suit
  you capitally:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">There is not a king, should you search the world
     round,<br>
  So blithe as the king's king, <span class="smcap">Tom King</span>, to be
  found;<br>
  Dear woman's his empire, each girl is his own,<br>
  And he'd have a long reign if he'd let 'em alone.</p><br>

  <p>Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha!" laughed Tom. "And now, Dick, to change the subject. You are off,
  I understand, to Yorkshire to-night. 'Pon my soul, you are a wonderful
  fellow&mdash;an <i>alibi</i> personified!&mdash;here and everywhere at the
  same time&mdash;no wonder you are called the flying highwayman. To-day in
  town&mdash;to-morrow at York&mdash;the day after at Chester. The devil only
  knows where you will pitch your quarters a week hence. There are rumors of
  you in all counties at the same moment. This man swears you robbed him at
  Hounslow; that on Salisbury Plain; while another avers you monopolize
  Cheshire and Yorkshire, and that it isn't safe even to <i>hunt</i> without
  pops in your pocket. I heard some devilish good stories of you at D'Osyndar's
  t'other day; the fellow who told them to me little thought I was a brother
  blade."</p>

  <p>"You flatter me," said Dick, smiling complacently; "but it's no merit of
  mine. Black Bess alone enables me to do it, and hers be the credit. Talking
  of being everywhere at the same time, you shall hear what she once did for me
  in Cheshire. Meantime, a glass to the best mare in England. You won't refuse
  that toast, Tom. Ah! if your mistress is only as true to you as my nag to me,
  you might set at naught the tightest hempen cravat that was ever twisted, and
  defy your best friend to hurt you. Black Bess! and God bless her! And now for
  the song." Saying which, with much emotion, Turpin chanted the following
  rhymes:</p>

  <h3>BLACK BESS</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Let the lover his mistress's beauty rehearse,<br>
  And laud her attractions in languishing verse;<br>
  Be it mine in rude strains, but with truth to express,<br>
  The love that I bear to my bonny Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">From the west was her dam, from the east was her
     sire,<br>
  From the one came her swiftness, the other her fire;<br>
  No peer of the realm better blood can possess<br>
  Than flows in the veins of my bonny Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Look! Look! how that eyeball grows bright as a
     brand!<br>
  That neck proudly arches, those nostrils expand!<br>
  Mark! that wide flowing mane! of which each silky tress<br>
  Might adorn prouder beauties&mdash;though none like Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Mark! that skin sleek as velvet, and dusky as
     night,<br>
  With its jet undisfigured by one lock of white;<br>
  That throat branched with veins, prompt to charge or caress<br>
  Now is she not beautiful?&mdash;bonny Black Bess!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Over highway and by-way, in rough and smooth
     weather,<br>
  Some thousands of miles have we journeyed together;<br>
  Our couch the same straw, and our meal the same mess<br>
  No couple more constant than I and Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">By moonlight, in darkness, by night, or by
     day,<br>
  Her headlong career there is nothing can stay;<br>
  She cares not for distance, she knows not distress:<br>
  Can you show me a courser to match with Black Bess?</p>

  <p>"Egad! I should think not," exclaimed King; "you are as sentimental on the
  subject of your mare, as I am when I think of my darling Susan. But pardon my
  interruption. Pray proceed."</p>

  <p>"Let me first clear my throat," returned Dick; "and now to
  resume:"</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Once it happened in Cheshire, near Dunham, I
     popped<br>
  On a horseman alone, whom I speedily stopped;<br>
  That I lightened his pockets you'll readily guess&mdash;<br>
  Quick work makes Dick Turpin when mounted on Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Now it seems the man knew me; "Dick Turpin," said
     he,<br>
  "You shall swing for this job, as you live, d'ye see;"<br>
  I laughed at his threats and his vows of redress;<br>
  I was sure of an <i>alibi</i> then with Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">The road was a hollow, a sunken ravine,[95]<br>
  Overshadowed completely by wood like a screen;<br>
  I clambered the bank, and I needs must confess,<br>
  That one touch of the spur grazed the side of Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Brake, brook, meadow, and plough'd field, Bess
     fleetly bestrode,<br>
  As the crow wings her flight we selected our road;<br>
  We arrived at Hough Green in five minutes, or less&mdash;<br>
  My neck it was saved by the speed of Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Stepping carelessly forward, I lounge on the
     green,<br>
  Taking excellent care that by all I am seen;<br>
  Some remarks on time's flight to the squires I address,<br>
  But I say not a word of the flight of Black Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">I mention the hour&mdash;it was just about
     four&mdash;<br>
  Play a rubber at bowls&mdash;think the danger is o'er;<br>
  When athwart my next game, like a checkmate at chess,<br>
  Comes the horsemen in search of the rider of Bess.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">What matter details? Off with triumph I came;<br>
  He swears to the hour, and the squires swear the same;<br>
  I had robbed him at <i>four</i>!&mdash;while at four <i>they</i> profess<br>
  I was quietly bowling&mdash;all thanks to Black Bess!</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Then one halloo, boys, one loud cheering
     halloo!<br>
  To the swiftest of coursers, the gallant, the true!<br>
  For the sportsman unborn shall the memory bless<br>
  Of the horse of the highwayman, bonny Black Bess!</p><br>

  <p>Loud acclamations rewarded Dick's performance. Awakened from his doze,
  Zoroaster beat time to the melody, the only thing, Jerry said, he was capable
  of <i>beating</i> in his present shattered condition. After some little
  persuasion, the Magus was prevailed upon to enliven the company with a
  strain, which he trolled forth after a maudlin manner:</p>

  <h3>THE DOUBLE CROSS</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Though all of us have heard of
     <i>crost</i>fights,<br>
  And certain <i>gains</i>, by certain <i>lost</i> fights,<br>

     style="margin-left:35%">Vith <i>mawleys</i>[102] raised, Tom bent his

  Straight threatened Tommy with a <i>topper</i>;<br>
  'Tis all my eye! no <i>claret</i> flows,<br>

  The loser's <i>von</i>, the vinner's <i>lost</i>!<br>
  <i>Ri, tol, lol, &amp;c.</i></p><br>

  <p>The party assumed once more a lively air, and the glass was circulated so
  freely, that at last a final charge drained the ample bowl of its
  contents.</p>

  <p>"The best of friends must part," said Dick; "and I would willingly order
  another whiff of punch, but I think we have all had <i>enough to satisfy
  us</i>, as you milling coves have it, Zory! Your one eye has got a drop in it
  already, old fellow; and, to speak the truth, I must be getting into the
  saddle without more delay, for I have a long ride before me. And now, friend
  Jerry, before I start, suppose you tip us one of your merry staves; we
  haven't heard your pipe to-day, and never a cross cove of us all can throw
  off so prime a chant as yourself. A song! a song!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, a song!" reiterated King and the Magus.</p>

  <p>"You do me too much honor, gemmen," said Jerry, modestly, taking a pinch
  of snuff; "I am sure I shall be most happy. My chants are all of a sort. You
  must make all due allowances&mdash;hem!" And, clearing his throat, he
  forthwith warbled:</p>

  <h3>THE MODERN GREEK<br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Come, gemmen, name, and make your game,<br>

  <p>"Bravo, Jerry&mdash;bravissimo!" chorused the party.</p>

  <p>"And now, pals, farewell!&mdash;a long farewell!" said Dick, in a tone of
  theatrical valediction. "As I said before, the best friends must separate. We
  may soon meet again, or we now may part forever. We cannot command our luck;
  but we can make the best of the span allotted to us. You have your game to
  play. I have mine. May each of us meet with the success he deserves."</p>

  <p>"Egad! I hope not," said King. "I'm afraid, in that case, the chances
  would be against us."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, the success we anticipate, if you prefer it," rejoined Dick.
  "I have only to observe one thing more, namely, that I must insist upon
  standing Sam upon the present occasion. Not a word. I won't hear a syllable.
  Landlord, I say&mdash;what oh!" continued Dick, stepping out of the arbor.
  "Here, my old Admiral of the White, what's the reckoning?&mdash;what's to
  pay, I say?"</p>

  <p>"Let ye know directly, sir," replied mine host of the Falstaff.</p>

  <p>"Order my horse&mdash;the black mare," added Dick.</p>

  <p>"And mine," said King, "the sorrel colt. I'll ride with you a mile or two
  on the road, Dick; perhaps we may stumble upon something."</p>

  <p>"Very likely."</p>

  <p>"We meet at twelve, at D'Osyndar's, Jerry," said King, "if nothing
  happens."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," responded Juniper.</p>

  <p>"What say you to a rubber at bowls, in the mean time?" said the Magus,
  taking his everlasting pipe from his lips.</p>

  <p>Jerry nodded acquiescence. And while they went in search of the implements
  of the game, Turpin and King sauntered gently on the green.</p>

  <p>It was a delicious evening. The sun was slowly declining, and glowed like
  a ball of fire amid the thick foliage of a neighboring elm. Whether, like the
  robber Moor, Tom King was touched by this glorious sunset, we pretend not to
  determine. Certain it was that a shade of inexpressible melancholy passed
  across his handsome countenance, as he gazed in the direction of
  Harrow-on-the Hill, which, lying to the west of the green upon which they
  walked, stood out with its pointed spire and lofty college against the ruddy
  sky. He spoke not. But Dick noticed the passing emotion.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, Tom?" said he, with much kindness of manner&mdash;"are you
  not well, lad?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am well enough," said King; "I know not what came over me, but
  looking at Harrow, I thought of my school days, and what I was <i>then</i>,
  and that bright prospect reminded me of my boyish hopes."</p>

  <p>"Tut&mdash;tut," said Dick, "this is idle&mdash;you are a man now."</p>

  <p>"I know I am," replied Tom, "but I <i>have</i> been a boy. Had I any faith
  in presentiments, I should say this is the last sunset I shall ever see."</p>

  <p>"Here comes our host," said Dick, smiling. "I've no presentiment that this
  is the last bill I shall ever pay."</p>

  <p>The bill was brought and settled. As Turpin paid it, the man's conduct was
  singular, and awakened his suspicions.</p>

  <p>"Are our horses ready?" asked Dick, quickly.</p>

  <p>"They are, sir," said the landlord.</p>

  <p>"Let us be gone," whispered Dick to King; "I don't like this fellow's
  manner. I thought I heard a carriage draw up at the inn door just
  now&mdash;there may be danger. Be fly!" added he to Jerry and the Magus.
  "Now, sir," said he to the landlord, "lead the way. Keep on the alert,
  Tom."</p>

  <p>Dick's hint was not lost upon the two bowlers. They watched their
  comrades; and listened intently for any manifestation of alarm.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-3"
     name="ch4-3"></a>CHAPTER III. &mdash; A SURPRISE</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">Was this well done, Jenny? &mdash;<i>Captain
     Macheath.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">WHILE Turpin and King are walking across the bowling-green,
  we will see what has taken place outside the inn. Tom's presentiments of
  danger were not, it appeared, without foundation. Scarcely had the ostler
  brought forth our two highwaymen's steeds, when a post-chaise, escorted by
  two or three horsemen, drove furiously up to the door. The sole occupant of
  the carriage was a lady, whose slight and pretty figure was all that could be
  distinguished, her face being closely veiled. The landlord, who was busied in
  casting up Turpin's account, rushed forth at the summons. A word or two
  passed between him and the horsemen, upon which the former's countenance
  fell. He posted in the direction of the garden; and the horsemen instantly
  dismounted.</p>

  <p>"We have him now, sure enough," said one of them, a very small man, who
  looked, in his boots, like Buckle equipped for the Oaks.</p>

  <p>"By the powers! I begin to think so," replied the other horseman. "But
  don't spoil all, Mr. Coates, by being too precipitate."</p>

  <p>"Never fear that, Mr. Tyrconnel," said Coates; for it was the gallant
  attorney: "he's sure to come for his mare. That's a <i>trap</i> certain to
  catch him, eh, Mr. Paterson? With the chief constable of Westminster to back
  us, the devil's in it if we are not a match for him."</p>

  <p>"And for Tom King, too," replied the chief constable; "since his blowen's
  peached, the game's up with him, too. We've long had an eye upon him, and now
  we'll have a finger. He's one of your dashing trouts to whom we always give a
  long line, but we'll <i>land</i> him this time, anyhow. If you'll look after
  Dick Turpin, gemmen, I'll make sure of Tom."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you would help <i>us</i>, Mr. Paterson," said Coates; "never
  mind Tom King; another time will do for him."</p>

  <p>"No such thing," said Paterson; "one <i>weighs</i> just as much for that
  matter as t'other. I'll take Tom to myself, and surely you two, with the
  landlord and ostler, can manage Turpin amongst you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know that," said Coates, doubtfully; "he's a devil of a fellow to
  deal with."</p>

  <p>"Take him quietly," said Paterson. "Draw the chaise out of the way, lad.
  Take our tits to one side, and place their nags near the door, ostler. Shall
  you be able to see him, ma'am, where you are?" asked the chief constable,
  walking to the carriage, and touching his hat to the lady within. Having
  received a satisfactory nod from the bonnet and veil, he returned to his
  companions. "And now, gemmen," added he, "let's step aside a little. Don't
  use your fire-arms too soon."</p>

  <p>As if conscious of what was passing around her, and of the danger that
  awaited her master, Black Bess exhibited so much impatience, and plunged so
  violently, that it was with difficulty the ostler could hold her. "The
  devil's in the mare," said he; "what's the matter with her? She was quiet
  enough a few minutes since. Soho! lass, stand."</p>

  <p>Turpin and King, meanwhile, walked quickly through the house, preceded by
  the host, who conducted them, and not without some inward trepidation,
  towards the door. Arrived there, each man rushed swiftly to his horse. Dick
  was in the saddle in an instant, and stamping her foot on the ostler's leg,
  Black Bess compelled the man, yelling with pain, to quit his hold of the
  bridle. Tom King was not equally fortunate. Before he could mount his horse,
  a loud shout was raised, which startled the animal, and caused him to swerve,
  so that Tom lost his footing in the stirrup, and fell to the ground. He was
  instantly seized by Paterson, and a struggle commenced, King endeavoring, but
  in vain, to draw a pistol.</p>

  <p>"Flip him,[108] Dick; fire, or I'm taken," cried King. "Fire! damn you,
  why don't you fire?" shouted he, in desperation, still struggling vehemently
  with Paterson, who was a strong man, and more than a match for a light weight
  like King.</p>

  <p>"I can't," cried Dick; "I shall hit you, if I fire."</p>

  <p>"Take your chance," shouted King. "Is <i>this</i> your friendship?"</p>

  <p>Thus urged, Turpin fired. The ball ripped up the sleeve of Paterson's
  coat, but did not wound him.</p>

  <p>"Again!" cried King. "Shoot him, I say. Don't you hear me? Fire
  again!"</p>

  <p>Pressed as he was by foes on every side, himself their mark, for both
  Coates and Tyrconnel had fired upon him, and were now mounting their steeds
  to give chase, it was impossible that Turpin could take sure aim; added to
  which, in the struggle, Paterson and King were each moment changing their
  relative positions. He, however, would no longer hesitate, but again, at his
  friend's request, fired. The ball lodged itself in King's breast! He fell at
  once. At this instant a shriek was heard from the chaise: the window was
  thrown open, and her thick veil being drawn aside, the features of a very
  pretty female, now impressed with terror and contrition, were suddenly
  exhibited.</p>

  <p>King fixed his glazing eyes upon her.</p>

  <p>"Susan!" sighed he, "is it you that I behold?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, 'tis she, sure enough," said Paterson. "You see, ma'am, what
  you and such like have brought him to. However, you'll lose your reward; he's
  going fast enough."</p>

  <p>"Reward!" gasped King; "reward! Did she betray me?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, sir," said Paterson, "she blowed the gaff, if it's any
  consolation to you to know it."</p>

  <p>"Consolation!" repeated the dying man; "perfidious!&mdash;oh!&mdash;the
  prophecy&mdash;my best friend&mdash;Turpin&mdash;I die by his hand."</p>

  <p>And vainly striving to raise himself, he fell backwards and expired. Alas,
  poor Tom!</p>

  <p>"Mr. Paterson! Mr. Paterson!" cried Coates; "leave the landlord to look
  after the body of that dying ruffian, and mount with us in pursuit of the
  living rascal. Come, sir; quick! mount! despatch! You see he is yonder; he
  seems to hesitate; we shall have him now."</p>

  <p>"Well, gemmen, I'm ready," said Paterson; "but how the devil came you to
  let him escape?"</p>

  <p>"Saint Patrick only knows!" said Titus; "he's as slippery as an
  eel&mdash;and, like a cat, turn him which way you will, he is always sure to
  alight upon his legs. I wouldn't wonder but we lose him now, after all,
  though he has such a small start. That mare flies like the wind."</p>

  <p>"He shall have a tight run for it, at all events," said Paterson, putting
  spurs into his horse. "I've got a good nag under me, and you are neither of
  you badly mounted. He's only three hundred yards before us, and the devil's
  in it if we can't run him down. It's a three hundred pound job, Mr. Coates,
  and well worth a race."</p>

  <p>"You shall have another hundred from me, sir, if you take him," said
  Coates, urging his steed forward.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir, thank you. Follow my directions, and we'll make sure of
  him," said the constable. "Gently, gently, not so fast up the hill&mdash;you
  see he's breathing his horse. All in good time, Mr. Coates&mdash;all in good
  time, sir."</p>

  <p>And maintaining an equal distance, both parties cantered leisurely up the
  ascent now called Windmill Hill. We shall now return to Turpin.</p>

  <p>Aghast at the deed he had accidentally committed, Dick remained for a few
  moments irresolute; he perceived that King was mortally wounded, and that all
  attempts at rescue would be fruitless; he perceived, likewise, that Jerry and
  the Magus had effected their escape from the bowling-green, as he could
  detect their figures stealing along the hedge-side. He hesitated no longer.
  Turning his horse, he galloped slowly off, little heeding the pursuit with
  which he was threatened.</p>

  <p>"Every bullet has its billet," said Dick; "but little did I think that I
  really should turn poor Tom's executioner. To the devil with this rascally
  snapper," cried he, throwing the pistol over the hedge. "I could never have
  used it again. 'Tis strange, too, that he should have foretold his own
  fate&mdash;devilish strange! And then that he should have been betrayed by
  the very blowen he trusted! that's a lesson, if I wanted any. But trust a
  woman!&mdash;not I, the length of my little finger."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-4"
     name="ch4-4"></a>CHAPTER IV. &mdash; THE HUE AND CRY</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Six gentlemen upon the road<br>
  Thus seeing Gilpin fly,<br>
  With postboy scampering in the rear,<br>
  They raised the hue and cry:</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!<br>
  Not one of them was mute;<br>
  And all and each that passed that way<br>
  Did join in the pursuit.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">&mdash;<i>John Gilpin.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">ARRIVED at the brow of the hill, whence such a beautiful
  view of the country surrounding the metropolis is obtained,[109] Turpin
  turned for an instant to reconnoitre his pursuers. Coates and Titus he
  utterly disregarded; but Paterson was a more formidable foe, and he well knew
  that he had to deal with a man of experience and resolution. It was then, for
  the first time, that the thoughts of executing his extraordinary ride to York
  first flashed across him; his bosom throbbed high with rapture, and he
  involuntarily exclaimed aloud, as he raised himself in the saddle, "By God! I
  will do it!"</p>

  <p>He took one last look at the great Babel that lay buried in a world of
  trees beneath him; and as his quick eye ranged over the magnificent prospect,
  lit up by that gorgeous sunset, he could not help thinking of Tom King's last
  words. "Poor fellow!" thought Dick, "he said truly. He will never see another
  sunset." Aroused by the approaching clatter of his pursuers, Dick struck into
  a lane which lies on the right of the road, now called Shoot-up-hill Lane,
  and set off at a good pace in the direction of Hampstead.</p>

  <p>"Now," cried Paterson, "put your tits to it, my boys. We must not lose
  sight of him for a second in these lanes."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, as Turpin was by no means desirous of inconveniencing his
  mare in this early stage of the business, and as the ground was still upon an
  ascent, the parties preserved their relative distances.</p>

  <p>At length, after various twistings and turnings in that deep and devious
  lane; after scaring one or two farmers, and riding over a brood or two of
  ducks; dipping into the verdant valley of West End, and ascending another
  hill, Turpin burst upon the gorsy, sandy, and beautiful heath of Hampstead.
  Shaping his course to the left, Dick then made for the lower part of the
  heath, and skirted a path that leads towards North End, passing the
  furze-crowned summit which is now crested by a clump of lofty pines.</p>

  <p>It was here that the chase first assumed a character of interest. Being
  open ground, the pursued and pursuers were in full view of each other; and as
  Dick rode swiftly across the heath, with the shouting trio hard at his heels,
  the scene had a very animated appearance. He crossed the hill&mdash;the
  Hendon Road&mdash;passed Crackskull Common&mdash;and dashed along the cross
  road to Highgate.</p>

  <p>Hitherto no advantage had been gained by the pursuers; they had not lost
  ground, but still they had not gained an inch, and much spurring was required
  to maintain their position. As they approached Highgate, Dick slackened his
  pace, and the other party redoubled their efforts. To avoid the town, Dick
  struck into a narrow path at the right, and rode easily down the hill.</p>

  <p>His pursuers were now within a hundred yards, and shouted to him to stand.
  Pointing to a gate which seemed to bar their further progress, Dick
  unhesitatingly charged it, clearing it in beautiful style. Not so with
  Coates's party; and the time they lost in unfastening the gate, which none of
  them chose to leap, enabled Dick to put additional space betwixt them. It did
  not, however, appear to be his intention altogether to outstrip his pursuers:
  the chase seemed to give him excitement, which he was willing to prolong as
  much as was consistent with his safety. Scudding rapidly past Highgate, like
  a swift-sailing schooner, with three lumbering Indiamen in her wake, Dick now
  took the lead along a narrow lane that threads the fields in the direction of
  Hornsey. The shouts of his followers had brought others to join them, and as
  he neared Crouch End, traversing the lane which takes its name from Du-Val,
  and in which a house frequented by that gayest of robbers stands, or stood,
  "A highwayman! a highwayman!" rang in his ears, in a discordant chorus of
  many voices.</p>

  <p>The whole neighborhood was alarmed by the cries, and by the tramp of
  horses: the men of Hornsey rushed into the road to seize the fugitive, and
  women held up their babes to catch a glimpse of the flying cavalcade, which
  seemed to gain number and animation as it advanced. Suddenly three horsemen
  appear in the road&mdash;they hear the uproar and the din. "A highwayman! a
  highwayman!" cry the voices: "stop him, stop him!" But it is no such easy
  matter. With a pistol in each hand, and his bridle in his teeth, Turpin
  passed boldly on. His fierce looks&mdash;his furious steed&mdash;the impetus
  with which he pressed forward, bore down all before him. The horsemen gave
  way, and only served to swell the list of his pursuers.</p>

  <p>"We have him now&mdash;we have him now!" cried Paterson, exultingly.
  "Shout for your lives. The turnpike man will hear us. Shout
  again&mdash;again! The fellow has heard it. The gate is shut. We have him.
  Ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>The old Hornsey toll-bar was a high gate, with chevaux-de-frise on the
  upper rail. It may be so still. The gate was swung into its lock, and, like a
  tiger in his lair, the prompt custodian of the turnpike trusts, ensconced
  within his doorway, held himself in readiness to spring upon the runaway. But
  Dick kept steadily on. He coolly calculated the height of the gate; he looked
  to the right and to the left&mdash;nothing better offered; he spoke a few
  words of encouragement to Bess, gently patted her neck, then struck his spurs
  into her sides, and cleared the spikes by an inch. Out rushed the amazed
  turnpike man, thus unmercifully bilked, and was nearly trampled to death
  under the feet of Paterson's horse.</p>

</div>

  <p>"Open the gate, fellow, and be expeditious," shouted the chief
  constable.</p>

  <p>"Not I," said the man, sturdily, "unless I gets my dues. I've been done
  once already. But strike me stupid if I'm done a second time."</p>

  <p>"Don't you perceive that's a highwayman? Don't you know that I'm chief
  constable of Westminster?" said Paterson, showing his staff. "How dare you
  oppose me in the discharge of my duty?"</p>

  <p>"That may be, or it may not be," said the man, doggedly. "But you don't
  pass, unless I gets the blunt, and that's the long and short on it."</p>

  <p>Amidst a storm of oaths, Coates flung down a crown piece, and the gate was
  thrown open.</p>

  <p>Turpin took advantage of this delay to breathe his mare; and, striking
  into a by-lane at Duckett's Green, cantered easily along in the direction of
  Tottenham. Little repose was allowed him. Yelling like a pack of hounds in
  full cry, his pursuers were again at his heels. He had now to run the
  gauntlet of the long straggling town of Tottenham, and various were the
  devices of the populace to entrap him. The whole place was up in arms,
  shouting, screaming, running, dancing, and hurling every possible description
  of missile at the horse and her rider. Dick merrily responded to their clamor
  as he flew past, and laughed at the brickbats that were showered thick as
  hail, and quite as harmlessly, around him.</p>

  <p>A few more miles' hard riding tired the volunteers, and before the chase
  reached Edmonton most of them were "<i>nowhere</i>." Here fresh relays were
  gathered, and a strong field was again mustered. John Gilpin himself could
  not have excited more astonishment amongst the good folks of Edmonton, than
  did our highwayman as he galloped through their town. Unlike the men of
  Tottenham, the mob received him with acclamations, thinking, no doubt, that,
  like "the citizens of famous London town," he rode for a wager. Presently,
  however, borne on the wings of the blast, came the cries of "Turpin! Dick
  Turpin!" and the hurrahs were changed to hootings; but such was the rate at
  which our highwayman rode, that no serious opposition could be offered to
  him.</p>

  <p>A man in a donkey-cart, unable to get out of the way, drew himself up in
  the middle of the road. Turpin treated him as he had done the <i>dub</i> at
  the <i>knapping jigger</i>, and cleared the driver and his little wain with
  ease. This was a capital stroke, and well adapted to please the multitude,
  who are ever taken with a brilliant action. "Hark away, Dick!" resounded on
  all hands, while hisses were as liberally bestowed upon his pursuers.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-5"
     name="ch4-5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE SHORT PIPE</h2>

  <p class="quote">The Peons are capital horsemen, and several times we saw
  them, at a gallop, throw the rein on the horse's neck, take from one pocket a
  bag of loose tobacco, and, with a piece of paper, or a leaf of Indian corn,
  make a cigar, and then take out a flint and steel and light it.<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Head</span>'s <i>Rough Notes</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">AWAY they fly past scattered cottages, swiftly and
  skimmingly, like eagles on the wing, along the Enfield highway. All were well
  mounted, and the horses, now thoroughly warmed, had got into their paces, and
  did their work beautifully. None of Coates's party lost ground, but they
  maintained it at the expense of their steeds, which were streaming like
  water-carts, while Black Bess had scarcely turned a hair.</p>

  <p>Turpin, the reader already knows, was a crack rider; he was <i>the</i>
  crack rider of England of his time, and, perhaps, of any time. The craft and
  mystery of jockeyship was not so well understood in the eighteenth as it is
  in the nineteenth century; men treated their horses differently, and few rode
  them as well as many ride now, when every youngster takes to the field as
  naturally as if he had been bred a Guacho. Dick Turpin was a glorious
  exception to the rule, and anticipated a later age. He rode wonderfully
  lightly, yet sat his saddle to perfection, distributing the weight so
  exquisitely that his horse scarcely felt his pressure; he yielded to every
  movement made by the animal, and became, as it were, part and parcel of
  itself; he took care Bess should be neither strained nor wrung. Freely, and
  as lightly as a feather, was she borne along; beautiful was it to see her
  action&mdash;to watch her style and temper of covering the ground; and many a
  first-rate Meltonian might have got a wrinkle from Turpin's seat and
  conduct.</p>

  <p>We have before stated that it was not Dick's object to <i>ride away</i>
  from his pursuers&mdash;he could have done that at any moment. He liked the
  fun of the chase, and would have been sorry to put a period to his own
  excitement. Confident in his mare, he just kept her at such speed as should
  put his pursuers completely <i>to it</i>, without in the slightest degree
  inconveniencing himself. Some judgment of the speed at which they went may be
  formed, when we state that little better than an hour had elapsed and nearly
  twenty miles had been ridden over. "Not bad travelling that," methinks we
  hear the reader exclaim.</p>

  <p>"By the mother that bore me," said Titus, as they went along in this
  slapping style&mdash;Titus, by-the-by, rode a big, Roman-nosed, powerful
  horse, well adapted to his weight, but which required a plentiful exercise
  both of leg and arm to call forth all his action, and keep his rider
  alongside his companions&mdash;"by the mother that bore me," said he, almost
  thumping the wind out of his flea-bitten Bucephalus with his calves, after
  the Irish fashion, "if the fellow isn't lighting his pipe! I saw the sparks
  fly on each side of him, and there he goes like a smoky chimney on a frosty
  morning! See, he turns his impudent phiz, with the pipe in his mouth! Are we
  to stand that, Mr. Coates?"</p>

  <p>"Wait awhile, sir&mdash;wait awhile," said Coates; "we'll smoke <i>him</i>
  by-and-by."</p>

  <p>Pæans have been sung in honor of the Peons of the Pampas by the
  <i>Head</i>long Sir Francis; but what the gallant major extols so loudly in
  the South American horsemen, viz., the lighting of a cigar when in mid
  career, was accomplished with equal ease by our English highwayman a hundred
  years ago, nor was it esteemed by him any extravagant feat either. Flint,
  steel, and tinder were bestowed within Dick's ample pouch, the short pipe was
  at hand, and within a few seconds there was a stream of vapor exhaling from
  his lips, like the smoke from a steamboat shooting down the river, and
  tracking his still rapid course through the air.</p>

  <p>"I'll let 'em see what I think of 'em!" said Dick, coolly, as he turned
  his head.</p>

<br>

  <p>It was now gray twilight. The mists of coming night were weaving a thin
  curtain over the rich surrounding landscape. All the sounds and hum of that
  delicious hour were heard, broken only by the regular clatter of the horses'
  hoofs. Tired of shouting, the chasers now kept on their way in deep silence;
  each man held his breath, and plunged his spurs, rowel deep, into his horse;
  but the animals were already at the top of their speed, and incapable of
  greater exertion. Paterson, who was a hard rider, and perhaps a thought
  better mounted, kept the lead. The rest followed as they might.</p>

  <p>Had it been undisturbed by the rush of the cavalcade, the scene would have
  been still and soothing. Overhead a cloud of rooks were winging their
  garrulous flight to the ancestral avenue of an ancient mansion to the right;
  the bat was on the wing; the distant lowing of a herd of kine saluted the ear
  at intervals; the blithe whistle of the rustic herdsman, and the merry chime
  of waggon bells, rang pleasantly from afar. But these cheerful sounds, which
  make the still twilight hour delightful, were lost in the tramp of the
  horsemen, now three abreast. The hind fled to the hedge for shelter, and the
  waggoner pricked up his ears, and fancied he heard the distant rumbling of an
  earthquake.</p>

  <p>On rush the pack, whipping, spurring, tugging for very life. Again they
  gave voice, in hopes the waggoner might succeed in stopping the fugitive. But
  Dick was already by his side. "Harkee, my tulip," cried he, taking the pipe
  from his mouth as he passed, "tell my friends behind they will hear of me at
  York."</p>

  <p>"What did he say?" asked Paterson, coming up the next moment.</p>

  <p>"That you'll find him at York," replied the waggoner.</p>

  <p>"At York!" echoed Coates, in amaze.</p>

  <p>Turpin was now out of sight, and although our trio flogged with might and
  main, they could never catch a glimpse of him until, within a short distance
  of Ware, they beheld him at the door of a little public house, standing with
  his bridle in his hand, coolly quaffing a tankard of ale. No sooner were they
  in sight, than Dick vaulted into the saddle, and rode off.</p>

  <p>"Devil seize you, sir! why didn't you stop him?" exclaimed Paterson, as he
  rode up. "My horse is dead lame. I cannot go any further. Do you know what a
  prize you have missed? Do you know who that was?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I don't," said the publican. "But I know he gave his mare more
  ale than he took himself, and he has given me a guinea instead of a shilling.
  He's a regular good 'un."</p>

  <p>"A good 'un!" said Paterson; "it was Turpin, the notorious highwayman. We
  are in pursuit of him. Have you any horses? our cattle are all blown."</p>

  <p>"You'll find the post-house in the town, gentlemen. I'm sorry I can't
  accommodate you. But I keeps no stabling. I wish you a very good evening,
  sir." Saying which, the publican retreated to his domicile.</p>

  <p>"That's a flash crib, I'll be bound," said Paterson. "I'll chalk you down,
  my friend, you may rely upon it. Thus far we're done, Mr. Coates. But curse
  me if I give it in. I'll follow him to the world's end first."</p>

  <p>"Right, sir&mdash;right," said the attorney. "A very proper spirit, Mr.
  Constable. You would be guilty of neglecting your duty were you to act
  otherwise. You must recollect my father, Mr. Paterson&mdash;Christopher, or
  Kit Coates; a name as well known at the Old Bailey as Jonathan Wild's. You
  recollect him&mdash;eh?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly well, sir," replied the chief constable.</p>

  <p>"The greatest thief-taker, though I say it," continued Coates, "on record.
  I inherit all his zeal&mdash;all his ardor. Come along, sir. We shall have a
  fine moon in an hour&mdash;bright as day. To the post-house! to the
  post-house!"</p>

  <p>Accordingly to the post-house they went; and, with as little delay as
  circumstances admitted, fresh hacks being procured, accompanied by a
  postilion, the party again pursued their onward course, encouraged to believe
  they were still in the right scent.</p>

  <p>Night had now spread her mantle over the earth; still it was not wholly
  dark. A few stars were twinkling in the deep, cloudless heavens, and a pearly
  radiance in the eastern horizon heralded the rising of the orb of night. A
  gentle breeze was stirring; the dews of evening had already fallen; and the
  air felt bland and dry. It was just the night one would have chosen for a
  ride, if one ever rode by choice at such an hour; and to Turpin, whose chief
  excursions were conducted by night, it appeared little less than
  heavenly.</p>

  <p>Full of ardor and excitement, determined to execute what he had mentally
  undertaken, Turpin held on his solitary course. Everything was favorable to
  his project; the roads were in admirable condition, his mare was in like
  order; she was inured to hard work, had rested sufficiently in town to
  recover from the fatigue of her recent journey, and had never been in more
  perfect training. "She has now got her wind in her," said Dick; "I'll see
  what she can do&mdash;hark away, lass&mdash;hark away! I wish they could see
  her now," added he, as he felt her almost fly away with him.</p>

  <p>Encouraged by her master's voice and hand, Black Bess started forward at a
  pace which few horses could have equalled, and scarcely any have sustained so
  long. Even Dick, accustomed as he was to her magnificent action, felt
  electrified at the speed with which he was borne along. "Bravo! bravo!"
  shouted he, "hark away, Bess!"</p>

  <p>The deep and solemn woods through which they were rushing rang with his
  shouts, and the sharp rattle of Bess's hoofs; and thus he held his way,
  while, in the words of the ballad,</p><br>

  <p class="first">BLACK BESS being undoubtedly the heroine of the Fourth Book
  of this Romance, we may, perhaps, be pardoned for expatiating a little in
  this place upon her birth, parentage, breeding, appearance, and attractions.
  And first as to her pedigree; for in the horse, unlike the human species,
  nature has strongly impressed the noble or ignoble caste. He is the real
  aristocrat, and the pure blood that flows in the veins of the gallant steed
  will infallibly be transmitted, if his mate be suitable, throughout all his
  line. Bess was no <i>cock-tail</i>. She was thorough-bred; she boasted blood
  in every bright and branching vein:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:38%">If blood can give nobility,<br>
  A noble steed was she;<br>
  Her sire was blood, and blood her dam,<br>
  And all her pedigree.</p><br>

  <p>As to her pedigree. Her sire was a desert Arab, renowned in his day, and
  brought to this country by a wealthy traveller; her dam was an English racer,
  coal-black as her child. Bess united all the fire and gentleness, the
  strength and hardihood, the abstinence and endurance of fatigue of the one,
  with the spirit and extraordinary fleetness of the other. How Turpin became
  possessed of her is of little consequence. We never heard that he paid a
  heavy price for her; though we doubt if any sum would have induced him to
  part with her. In color, she was perfectly black, with a skin smooth on the
  surface as polished jet; not a single white hair could be detected in her
  satin coat. In make she was magnificent. Every point was perfect, beautiful,
  compact; modelled, in little, for strength and speed. Arched was her neck, as
  that of the swan; clean and fine were her lower limbs, as those of the
  gazelle; round and sound as a drum was her carcase, and as broad as a
  cloth-yard shaft her width of chest. Hers were the "<i>pulchræ clunes, breve
  caput, arduaque cervix</i>," of the Roman bard. There was no redundancy of
  flesh, 'tis true; her flanks might, to please some tastes, have been rounder,
  and her shoulders fuller; but look at the nerve and sinew, palpable through
  the veined limbs! She was built more for strength than beauty, and yet she
  <i>was</i> beautiful. Look at that elegant little head; those thin, tapering
  ears, closely placed together; that broad, snorting nostril, which seems to
  snuff the gale with disdain; that eye, glowing and large as the diamond of
  Giamschid! Is she not beautiful? Behold her paces! how gracefully she moves!
  She is off!&mdash;no eagle on the wing could skim the air more swiftly. Is
  she not superb? As to her temper, the lamb is not more gentle. A child might
  guide her.</p>

  <p>But hark back to Dick Turpin. We left him rattling along in superb style,
  and in the highest possible glee. He could not, in fact, be otherwise than
  exhilarated; nothing being so wildly intoxicating as a mad gallop. We seem to
  start out of ourselves&mdash;to be endued, for the time, with new energies.
  Our thoughts take wings rapid as our steed. We feel as if his fleetness and
  boundless impulses were for the moment our own. We laugh; we exult; we shout
  for very joy. We cry out with Mephistopheles, but in anything but a sardonic
  mood, "What I enjoy with spirit, is it the less my own on that account? If I
  can pay for six horses, are not their powers mine! I drive along, and am a
  proper man, as if I had four-and-twenty legs!" These were Turpin's sentiments
  precisely. Give him four legs and a wide plain, and he needed no
  Mephistopheles to bid him ride to perdition as fast as his nag could carry
  him. Away, away!&mdash;the road is level, the path is clear. Press on, thou
  gallant steed, no obstacle is in thy way!&mdash;and, lo! the moon breaks
  forth! Her silvery light is thrown over the woody landscape. Dark shadows are
  cast athwart the road, and the flying figures of thy rider and thyself are
  traced, like giant phantoms, in the dust!</p>

  <p>Away, away! our breath is gone in keeping up with this tremendous run. Yet
  Dick Turpin has not lost his wind, for we hear his cheering cry&mdash;hark!
  he sings. The reader will bear in mind that Oliver means the moon&mdash;to
  "whiddle" is to blab.</p>

  <h3>OLIVER WHIDDLES!</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Oliver whiddles&mdash;the tattler old!<br>
  Telling what best had been left untold.<br>
  Oliver ne'er was a friend of mine;<br>
  All glims I hate that so brightly shine.<br>
  Give me a night black as hell, and then<br>
  See what I'll show to you, my merry men.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Oliver whiddles!&mdash;who cares&mdash;who
     cares,<br>
  If down upon us he peers and stares?<br>
  Mind him who will, with his great white face,<br>
  Boldly <i>I'll</i> ride by his glim to the chase;<br>
  Give him a Rowland, and loudly as ever<br>
  Shout, as I show myself, "Stand and deliver!"</p><br>

  <p>"Egad," soliloquized Dick, as he concluded his song, looking up at the
  moon. "Old Noll's no bad fellow, either. I wouldn't be without his white face
  to-night for a trifle. He's as good as a lamp to guide one, and let Bess only
  hold on as she goes now, and I'll do it with ease. Softly, wench,
  softly&mdash;dost not see it's a hill we're rising. The devil's in the mare,
  she cares for nothing." And as they ascended the hill, Dick's voice once more
  awoke the echoes of night.</p>

  <h3>WILL DAVIES AND DICK TURPIN</h3>

  <p class="cp"><small>Hodiè mihi, cràs tibi.&mdash; <span class="smcap">Saint
  Augustin</span>.</small></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">One night, when mounted on my mare,<br>
  To Bagshot Heath I did repair,<br>
  And saw Will Davies hanging there,<br>
  Upon the gibbet bleak and bare,<br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Within his chains bold Will looked blue,<br>
  Gone were his sword and snappers too,<br>
  Which served their master well and true;<br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Says he, "Dick Turpin, here I be,<br>
  Upon the gibbet, as you see;<br>
  I take the matter easily;<br>
  <i>You'll</i> have your turn as well as me,<br>
  <i>With your whistle-me, pistol-me, cut-my-throat air!</i>"</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">Says I, "That's very true, my lad;<br>
  Meantime, with pistol and with prad,<br>
  I'm quite contented as I am,<br>
  And heed the gibbet not a d&mdash;n!<br>
  <i>With its rustified, fustified, mustified air!</i>"</p><br>

  <p>"Poor Will Davies!" sighed Dick; "Bagshot ought never to forget
  him."[110]</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">For never more shall Bagshot see<br>
  A highwayman of such degree,<br>
  Appearance, and gentility,<br>
  As Will, who hangs upon the tree,<br>
  <i>With his rustified, fustified, mustified air!</i></p><br>

  <p>"Well," mused Turpin, "I suppose one day it will be with me like all the
  rest of 'em, and that I shall dance a long lavolta to the music of the four
  whistling winds, as my betters have done before me; but I trust, whenever the
  chanter-culls and last-speech scribblers get hold of me, they'll at least put
  no cursed nonsense into my mouth, but make me speak, as I have ever felt,
  like a man who never either feared death, or turned his back upon his friend.
  In the mean time I'll give them something to talk about. This ride of mine
  shall ring in their ears long after I'm done for&mdash;put to bed with a
  mattock, and tucked up with a spade.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:34%">And when I am gone, boys, each huntsman shall
     say,<br>
  None rode like Dick Turpin, so far in a day.</p><br>

  <p>And thou, too, brave Bess!&mdash;thy name shall be linked with mine, and
  we'll go down to posterity together; and what," added he, despondingly, "if
  it should be too much for thee? what if&mdash;&mdash;but no matter! Better
  die now, while I am with thee, than fall into the knacker's hands. Better die
  with all thy honors upon thy head, than drag out thy old age at the
  sand-cart. Hark forward, lass&mdash;hark forward!"</p>

  <p>By what peculiar instinct is it that this noble animal, the horse, will at
  once perceive the slightest change in his rider's physical temperament, and
  allow himself so to be influenced by it, that, according as his master's
  spirits fluctuate, will his own energies rise and fall, wavering</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:34%">From walk to trot, from canter to full
     speed?</p><br>

  <p>How is it, we ask of those more intimately acquainted with the metaphysics
  of the Houyhnhnm than we pretend to be? Do the saddle or the rein convey,
  like metallic tractors, vibrations of the spirit betwixt the two? We know
  not, but this much is certain, that no servant partakes so much of the
  character of his master as the horse. The steed we are wont to ride becomes a
  portion of ourselves. He thinks and feels with us. As we are lively, he is
  sprightly; as we are depressed, his courage droops. In proof of this, let the
  reader see what horses some men make&mdash;<i>make</i>, we say, because in
  such hands their character is wholly altered. Partaking, in a measure, of the
  courage and the firmness of the hand that guides them, and of the resolution
  of the frame that sways them&mdash;what their rider wills, they do, or strive
  to do. When that governing power is relaxed, their energies are relaxed
  likewise; and their fine sensibilities supply them with an instant knowledge
  of the disposition and capacity of the rider. A gift of the gods is the
  gallant steed, which, like any other faculty we possess, to use or to
  abuse&mdash;to command or to neglect&mdash;rests with ourselves; he is the
  best general test of our own self-government.</p>

  <p>Black Bess's action amply verified what we have just asserted; for during
  Turpin's momentary despondency, her pace was perceptibly diminished and her
  force retarded; but as he revived, she rallied instantly, and, seized
  apparently with a kindred enthusiasm, snorted joyously as she recovered her
  speed. Now was it that the child of the desert showed herself the undoubted
  offspring of the hardy loins from whence she sprung. Full fifty miles had she
  sped, yet she showed no symptoms of distress. If possible, she appeared
  fresher than when she started. She had breathed; her limbs were suppler; her
  action was freer, easier, lighter. Her sire, who, upon his trackless wilds,
  could have outstripped the pestilent simoom; and with throat unslaked, and
  hunger unappeased, could thrice have seen the scorching sun go down, had not
  greater powers of endurance. His vigor was her heritage. Her dam, who upon
  the velvet sod was of almost unapproachable swiftness, and who had often
  brought her owner golden assurances of her worth, could scarce have kept pace
  with her, and would have sunk under a third of her fatigue. But Bess was a
  paragon. We ne'er shall look upon her like again, unless we can prevail upon
  some Bedouin chief to present us with a brood mare, and then the racing world
  shall see what a breed we will introduce into this country. Eclipse,
  Childers, or Hambletonian, shall be nothing to our colts, and even the
  railroad slow travelling, compared with the speed of our new nags!</p>

  <p>But to return to Bess, or rather to go along with her, for there is no
  halting now; we are going at the rate of twenty knots an hour&mdash;sailing
  before the wind; and the reader must either keep pace with us, or drop
  astern. Bess is now in her speed, and Dick happy. Happy! he is
  enraptured&mdash;maddened&mdash;furious&mdash;intoxicated as with wine.
  Pshaw! wine could never throw him into such a burning delirium. Its choicest
  juices have no inspiration like this. Its fumes are slow and heady. This is
  ethereal, transporting. His blood spins through his veins; winds round his
  heart; mounts to his brain. Away! away! He is wild with joy. Hall, cot, tree,
  tower, glade, mead, waste, or woodland, are seen, passed, left behind, and
  vanish as in a dream. Motion is scarcely perceptible&mdash;it is impetus!
  volition! The horse and her rider are driven forward, as it were, by
  self-accelerated speed. A hamlet is visible in the moonlight. It is scarcely
  discovered ere the flints sparkle beneath the mare's hoofs. A moment's
  clatter upon the stones, and it is left behind. Again it is the silent,
  smiling country. Now they are buried in the darkness of woods; now sweeping
  along on the wide plain; now clearing the unopened toll-bar; now trampling
  over the hollow-sounding bridge, their shadows momently reflected in the
  placid mirror of the stream; now scaling the hill-side a thought more slowly;
  now plunging, as the horses of Phoebus into the ocean, down its precipitous
  sides.</p>

  <p>The limits of two shires are already past. They are within the confines of
  a third. They have entered the merry county of Huntingdon; they have
  surmounted the gentle hill that slips into Godmanchester. They are by the
  banks of the rapid Ouse. The bridge is past; and as Turpin rode through the
  deserted streets of Huntingdon, he heard the eleventh hour given from the
  iron tongue of St. Mary's spire. In four hours&mdash;it was about seven when
  he started&mdash;Dick had accomplished full sixty miles!</p>

  <p>A few reeling topers in the streets saw the horseman flit past, and one or
  two windows were thrown open; but Peeping Tom of Coventry would have had
  small chance of beholding the unveiled beauties of Queen Godiva had she
  ridden at the rate of Dick Turpin. He was gone, like a meteor, almost as soon
  as he appeared.</p>

  <p>Huntingdon is left behind, and he is once more surrounded by dew-gemmed
  hedges and silent slumbering trees. Broad meadows, or pasture land, with
  drowsy cattle, or low bleating sheep, lie on either side. But what to Turpin,
  at that moment, is nature, animate or inanimate? He thinks only of his
  mare&mdash;his future fame. None are by to see him ride; no stimulating
  plaudits ring in his ears; no thousand hands are clapping; no thousand voices
  huzzaing; no handkerchiefs are waved; no necks strained; no bright eyes rain
  influence upon him; no eagle orbs watch his motions; no bells are rung; no
  cup awaits his achievement; no sweepstakes&mdash;no plate. But his will be
  renown&mdash;everlasting renown; his will be fame which will not die with
  him&mdash;which will keep his reputation, albeit a tarnished one, still in
  the mouths of men. He wants all these adventitious excitements, but he has
  that within which is a greater excitement than all these. He is conscious
  that he is doing a deed to live by. If not riding for <i>life</i>, he is
  riding for <i>immortality</i>; and as the hero may perchance feel&mdash;for
  even a highwayman may feel like a hero,&mdash;when he willingly throws away
  his existence in the hope of earning a glorious name, Turpin cared not what
  might befall himself, so he could proudly signalize himself as the first of
  his land,</p>

  <p class="poem">And witch the world with noble horsemanship!</p>

  <p>What need had he of spectators? The eye of posterity was upon him; he felt
  the influence of that Argus glance which has made many a poor wight spur on
  his Pegasus with not half so good a chance of reaching the goal as Dick
  Turpin. Multitudes, yet unborn, he knew would hear and laud his deeds. He
  trembled with excitement, and Bess trembled under him. But the emotion was
  transient. On, on they fly! The torrent leaping from the crag&mdash;the bolt
  from the bow&mdash;the air-cleaving eagle&mdash;thoughts themselves are
  scarce more winged in their flight!</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-7"
     name="ch4-7"></a>CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE YORK STAGE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><span class="smcap">York, Four Days!</span>&mdash;<i>Stage
  Coach begins on Friday, the 18th of April, 1706.</i> All that are desirous to
  pass from London to York, or from York to London, or any other place on that
  road, let them repair to the Black Swan, in Holborn, in London, or to the
  Black Swan, in Coney Street, in York. At both which places they may be
  received in a <i>Stage Coach</i>, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, which
  performs the journey in four days&mdash;if God permits!&mdash;and sets forth
  at five in the morning. And returns from York to Stamford in two days, and
  from Stamford, by Huntingdon, in two days more. And the like stages in their
  return. Allowing each passenger fourteen pounds' weight, and all above, three
  pence per pound. Performed by Benjamin Kingman, Henry Harrison, and Waller
  Baynes.<br>
  &mdash;<i>Placard, preserved in the coffee-room, of the Black Swan Inn at
  York.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE night had hitherto been balmy and beautiful, with a
  bright array of stars, and a golden harvest moon, which seemed to diffuse
  even warmth with its radiance; but now Turpin was approaching the region of
  fog and fen, and he began to feel the influence of that dank atmosphere. The
  intersecting dykes, yawners, gullies, or whatever they are called, began to
  send forth their steaming vapors, and chilled the soft and wholesome air,
  obscuring the void, and in some instances, as it were, choking up the road
  itself with vapor. But fog or fen was the same to Bess; her hoofs rattled
  merrily along the road, and she burst from a cloud, like Eöus at the break of
  dawn.</p>

  <p>It chanced, as he issued from a fog of this kind, that Turpin burst upon
  the York stage coach. It was no uncommon thing for the coach to be stopped;
  and so furious was the career of our highwayman, that the man involuntarily
  drew up his horses. Turpin had also to draw in the rein, a task of no little
  difficulty, as charging a huge, lumbering coach, with its full complement of
  passengers, was more than even Bess could accomplish. The moon shone brightly
  on Turpin and his mare. He was unmasked, and his features were distinctly
  visible. An exclamation was uttered by a gentleman on the box, who, it
  appeared, instantly recognized him.</p>

  <p>"Pull up&mdash;draw your horses across the road!" cried the gentleman;
  "that's Dick Turpin, the highwayman. His capture would be worth three hundred
  pounds to you," added he, addressing the coachman, "and is of equal
  importance to me. Stand!" shouted he, presenting a cocked pistol.</p>

  <p>This resolution of the gentleman was not apparently agreeable, either to
  the coachman or the majority of the passengers&mdash;the name of Turpin
  acting like magic upon them. One man jumped off behind, and was with
  difficulty afterwards recovered, having tumbled into a deep ditch at the
  roadside. An old gentleman with a cotton nightcap, who had popped out his
  head to swear at the coachman, drew it suddenly back. A faint scream in a
  female key issued from within, and there was a considerable hubbub on the
  roof. Amongst other ominous sounds, the guard was heard to click his long
  horse-pistols. "Stop the York four-day stage!" said he, forcing his smoky
  voice through a world of throat-embracing shawl; "the fastest coach in the
  kingdom: vos ever such atrocity heard of? I say, Joe, keep them ere leaders
  steady; we shall all be in the ditch. Don't you see where the hind wheels
  are? Who&mdash;whoop, I say."</p>

  <p>The gentleman on the box now discharged his pistol, and the confusion
  within was redoubled. The white nightcap was popped out like a rabbit's head,
  and as quickly popped back on hearing the highwayman's voice. Owing to the
  plunging of the horses, the gentleman had missed his aim.</p>

  <p>Prepared for such emergencies as the present, and seldom at any time taken
  aback, Dick received the fire without flinching. He then lashed the horses
  out of his course, and rode up, pistol in hand, to the gentleman who had
  fired.</p>

  <p>"Major Mowbray," said he, in a stern tone, "I know you. I meant not either
  to assault you or these gentlemen. Yet you have attempted my life, sir, a
  second time. But you are now in my power, and by hell! if you do not answer
  the questions I put to you, nothing earthly shall save you."</p>

  <p>"If you ask aught I may not answer, fire!" said the major; "I will never
  ask life from such as you."</p>

  <p>"Have you seen aught of Sir Luke Rookwood?" asked Dick.</p>

  <p>"The villain you mean is not yet secured," replied the major, "but we have
  traces of him. 'Tis with a view of procuring more efficient assistance that I
  ride to town."</p>

  <p>"They have not met then, since?" said Dick, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Met! whom do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Your sister and Sir Luke," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"My sister meet him!" cried the major, angrily&mdash;"think you he dares
  show himself at Rookwood?"</p>

  <p>"Ho! ho!" laughed Dick&mdash;"she <i>is</i> at Rookwood, then? A thousand
  thanks, major. Good night to you, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"Take that with you, and remember the guard," cried the fellow, who,
  unable to take aim from where he sat, had crept along the coach roof, and
  discharged thence one of his large horse-pistols at what he took to be the
  highwayman's head, but which, luckily for Dick, was his hat, which he had
  raised to salute the passengers.</p>

  <p>"Remember you," said Dick, coolly replacing his perforated beaver on his
  brow; "you may rely upon it, my fine fellow, I'll not forget you the next
  time we meet."</p>

  <p>And off he went like the breath of the whirlwind.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Moor.</i> Take my horse, and dash a bottle of wine over
  him. 'Twas hot work.<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Schiller:</span> <i>The Robbers</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WE will now make inquiries after Mr. Coates and his party,
  of whom both we and Dick Turpin have for some time lost sight. With unabated
  ardor the vindictive man of law and his myrmidons pressed forward. A tacit
  compact seemed to have been entered into between the highwayman and his
  pursuers, that he was to fly while they were to follow. Like bloodhounds,
  they kept steadily upon his trail; nor were they so far behind as Dick
  imagined. At each post-house they passed they obtained fresh horses, and,
  while these were saddling, a postboy was despatched <i>en courrier</i> to
  order relays at the next station. In this manner they proceeded after the
  first stoppage without interruption. Horses were in waiting for them, as
  they, "bloody with spurring, fiery hot with haste," and their jaded hacks
  arrived. Turpin had been heard or seen in all quarters. Turnpike-men,
  waggoners, carters, trampers, all had seen him. Besides, strange as it may
  sound, they placed some faith in his word. York they believed would be his
  destination.</p>

  <p>At length the coach which Dick had encountered hove in sight. There was
  another stoppage and another hubbub. The old gentleman's nightcap was again
  manifested, and suffered a sudden occultation, as upon the former occasion.
  The postboy, who was in advance, had halted, and given up his horse to Major
  Mowbray, who exchanged his seat on the box for one on the saddle, deeming it
  more expedient, after his interview with Turpin, to return to Rookwood,
  rather than to proceed to town. The postboy was placed behind Coates, as
  being the lightest weight; and, thus reinforced, the party pushed forward as
  rapidly as heretofore.</p>

  <p>Eighty and odd miles had now been traversed&mdash;the boundary of another
  county, Northampton, passed; yet no rest nor respite had Dick Turpin or his
  unflinching mare enjoyed. But here he deemed it fitting to make a brief
  halt.</p>

  <p>Bordering the beautiful domains of Burleigh House stood a little retired
  hostelry of some antiquity, which bore the great Lord Treasurer's arms. With
  this house Dick was not altogether unacquainted. The lad who acted as ostler
  was known to him. It was now midnight, but a bright and beaming night. To the
  door of the stable then did he ride, and knocked in a peculiar manner.
  Reconnoitering Dick through a broken pane of glass in the lintel, and
  apparently satisfied with his scrutiny, the lad thrust forth a head of hair
  as full of straw as Mad Tom's is represented to be upon the stage. A chuckle
  of welcome followed his sleepy salutation. "Glad to see you, Captain Turpin,"
  said he; "can I do anything for you?"</p>

  <p>"Get me a couple of bottles of brandy and a beefsteak," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"As to the brandy, you can have that in a jiffy&mdash;but the steak, Lord
  love you, the old ooman won't stand it at this time; but there's a cold
  round, mayhap a slice of that might do&mdash;or a knuckle of ham?"</p>

  <p>"A pest on your knuckles, Ralph," cried Dick; "have you any raw meat in
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"Raw meat!" echoed Ralph, in surprise. "Oh, yes, there's a rare rump of
  beef. You can have a cut off that, if you like."</p>

  <p>"That's the thing I want," said Dick, ungirthing his mare. "Give me the
  scraper. There, I can get a whisp of straw from your head. Now run and get
  the brandy. Better bring three bottles. Uncork 'em, and let me have half a
  pail of water to mix with the spirit."</p>

  <p>"A pail full of brandy and water to wash down a raw steak! My eyes!"
  exclaimed Ralph, opening wide his sleepy peepers; adding, as he went about
  the execution of his task, "I always thought them Rum-padders, as they call
  themselves, rum fellows, but now I'm sartin sure on it."</p>

  <p>The most sedulous groom could not have bestowed more attention upon the
  horse of his heart than Dick Turpin now paid to his mare. He scraped, chafed,
  and dried her, sounded each muscle, traced each sinew, pulled her ears,
  examined the state of her feet, and, ascertaining that her "withers were
  un-wrung," finally washed her from head to foot in the diluted spirit, not,
  however, before he had conveyed a thimbleful of the liquid to his own parched
  throat, and replenished what Falstaff calls a "pocket-pistol," which he had
  about him. While Ralph was engaged in rubbing her down after her bath, Dick
  occupied himself, not in dressing the raw steak in the manner the stable-boy
  had anticipated, but in rolling it round the bit of his bridle.</p>

  <p>"She will now go as long as there's breath in her body," said he, putting
  the flesh-covered iron within her mouth.</p>

  <p>The saddle being once more replaced, after champing a moment or two at the
  bit, Bess began to snort and paw the earth, as if impatient of delay; and,
  acquainted as he was with her indomitable spirit and power, her condition was
  a surprise even to Dick himself. Her vigor seemed inexhaustible, her vivacity
  was not a whit diminished, but, as she was led into the open space, her step
  became as light and free as when she started on her ride, and her sense of
  sound as quick as ever. Suddenly she pricked her ears, and uttered a low
  neigh. A dull tramp was audible.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Dick, springing into his saddle; "they come."</p>

  <p>"Who come, captain?" asked Ralph.</p>

  <p>"The road takes a turn here, don't it?" asked Dick&mdash;"sweeps round to
  the right by the plantations in the hollow?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, ay, captain," answered Ralph; "it's plain you knows the ground."</p>

  <p>"What lies behind yon shed?"</p>

  <p>"A stiff fence, captain&mdash;a reg'lar rasper. Beyond that a hill-side
  steep as a house, no oss as was ever shoed can go down it."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" laughed Dick.</p>

  <p>A loud halloo from Major Mowbray, who seemed advancing upon the wings of
  the wind, told Dick that he was discovered. The major was a superb horseman,
  and took the lead of his party. Striking his spurs deeply into his horse, and
  giving him bridle enough, the major seemed to shoot forward like a shell
  through the air. The Burleigh Arms retired some hundred yards from the road,
  the space in front being occupied by a neat garden, with low, clipped edges.
  No tall timber intervened between Dick and his pursuers, so that the motions
  of both parties were visible to each other. Dick saw in an instant that if he
  now started he should come into collision with the major exactly at the angle
  of the road, and he was by no means desirous of hazarding such a rencontre.
  He looked wistfully back at the double fence.</p>

  <p>"Come into the stable. Quick, captain, quick!" exclaimed Ralph.</p>

  <p>"The stable!" echoed Dick, hesitating.</p>

  <p>"Ay, the stable; it's your only chance. Don't you see he's turning the
  corner, and they are all coming? Quick, sir, quick!"</p>

  <p>Dick, lowering his head, rode into the tenement, the door of which was
  unceremoniously slapped in the major's face, and bolted on the other
  side.</p>

  <p>"Villain!" cried Major Mowbray, thundering at the door, "come forth! You
  are now fairly trapped at last&mdash;caught like the woodcock in your own
  springe. We have you. Open the door, I say, and save us the trouble of
  forcing it. You cannot escape us. We will burn the building down but we will
  have you."</p>

  <p>"What dun you want, measter?" cried Ralph, from the lintel, whence he
  reconnoitered the major, and kept the door fast. "You're clean mista'en.
  There be none here."</p>

  <p>"We'll soon see that," said Paterson, who had now arrived; and, leaping
  from his horse, the chief constable took a short run to give himself impetus,
  and with his foot burst open the door. This being accomplished, in dashed the
  major and Paterson, but the stable was vacant. A door was open at the back;
  they rushed to it. The sharply sloping sides of a hill slipped abruptly
  downwards, within a yard of the door. It was a perilous descent to the
  horseman, yet the print of a horse's heels were visible in the dislodged turf
  and scattered soil.</p>

  <p>"Confusion!" cried the major, "he has escaped us."</p>

  <p>"He is yonder," said Paterson, pointing out Turpin moving swiftly through
  the steaming meadow. "See, he makes again for the road&mdash;he clears the
  fence. A regular throw he has given us, by the Lord!"</p>

  <p>"Nobly done, by Heaven!" cried the major. "With all his faults, I honor
  the fellow's courage and admire his prowess. He's already ridden to-night as
  I believe never man rode before. I would not have ventured to slide down that
  wall, for it's nothing else, with the enemy at my heels. What say you,
  gentlemen, have you had enough? Shall we let him go, or&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"As far as chase goes, I don't care if we bring the matter to a
  conclusion," said Titus. "I don't think, as it is, that I shall have a sate
  to sit on this week to come. I've lost leather most confoundedly."</p>

  <p>"What says Mr. Coates?" asked Paterson. "I look to him."</p>

  <p>"Then mount, and off," cried Coates. "Public duty requires that we should
  take him."</p>

  <p>"And private pique," returned the major. "No matter! The end is the same.
  Justice shall be satisfied. To your steeds, my merry men all. Hark, and
  away."</p>

  <p>Once more upon the move, Titus forgot his distress, and addressed himself
  to the attorney, by whose side he rode.</p>

  <p>"What place is that we're coming to?" asked he, pointing to a cluster of
  moonlit spires belonging to a town they were rapidly approaching.</p>

  <p>"Stamford," replied Coates.</p>

  <p>"Stamford!" exclaimed Titus; "by the powers! then we've ridden a matter of
  ninety miles. Why, the great deeds of Redmond O'Hanlon were nothing to this!
  I'll remember it to my dying day, and with reason," added he, uneasily
  shifting his position on the saddle.</p>

  <p class="first">DICK TURPIN, meanwhile, held bravely on his course. Bess was
  neither strained by her gliding passage down the slippery hill-side nor
  shaken by <i>larking</i> the fence in the meadow. As Dick said, "It took a
  devilish deal to take it out of her." On regaining the high road she resumed
  her old pace, and once more they were distancing Time's swift chariot in its
  whirling passage o'er the earth. Stamford, and the tongue of Lincoln's fenny
  shire, upon which it is situated, were passed almost in a breath. Rutland is
  won and passed, and Lincolnshire once more entered. The road now verged
  within a bowshot of that sporting Athens&mdash;Corinth, perhaps, we should
  say&mdash;Melton Mowbray. Melton was then unknown to fame, but, as if
  inspired by that <i>furor venaticus</i> which now inspires all who come
  within twenty miles of this Charybdis of the chase, Bess here <i>let out</i>
  in a style with which it would have puzzled the best Leicestershire squire's
  best prad to have kept pace. The spirit she imbibed through the pores of her
  skin, and the juices of the meat she had champed, seemed to have communicated
  preternatural excitement to her. Her pace was absolutely terrific. Her
  eyeballs were dilated, and glowed like flaming carbuncles; while her
  widely-distended nostril seemed, in the cold moonshine, to snort forth smoke,
  as from a hidden fire. Fain would Turpin have controlled her; but, without
  bringing into play all his tremendous nerve, no check could be given her
  headlong course, and for once, and the only time in her submissive career,
  Bess resolved to have her own way&mdash;and she had it. Like a sensible
  fellow, Dick conceded the point. There was something even of conjugal
  philosophy in his self-communion upon the occasion. "E'en let her take her
  own way and be hanged to her, for an obstinate, self-willed jade as she is,"
  said he: "now her back is up there'll be no stopping her, I'm sure: she
  rattles away like a woman's tongue, and when that once begins, we all know
  what chance the curb has. Best to let her have it out, or rather to lend her
  a lift. 'Twill be over the sooner. Tantivy, lass! tantivy! I know which of us
  will tire first."</p>

  <p>We have before said that the vehement excitement of continued swift riding
  produces a paroxysm in the sensorium amounting to delirium. Dick's blood was
  again on fire. He was first giddy, as after a deep draught of kindling
  spirit; this passed off, but the spirit was still in his veins&mdash;the
  <i>estro</i> was working in his brain. All his ardor, his eagerness, his
  fury, returned. He rode like one insane, and his courser partook of his
  frenzy. She bounded; she leaped; she tore up the ground beneath her; while
  Dick gave vent to his exultation in one wild, prolonged halloo. More than
  half his race is run. He has triumphed over every difficulty. He will have no
  further occasion to halt. Bess carries her forage along with her. The course
  is straightforward&mdash;success seems certain&mdash;the goal already
  reached&mdash;the path of glory won. Another wild halloo, to which the
  echoing woods reply, and away!</p>

  <p>Away! away! thou matchless steed! yet brace fast thy sinews&mdash;hold,
  hold thy breath, for, alas! the goal is not yet attained!</p><br>

  <p class="quote"

  <h2><a id="ch4-10"
     name="ch4-10"></a>CHAPTER X. &mdash; THE GIBBET</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">See there, see there, what yonder swings<br>
  And creaks 'mid whistling rain,<br>
  Gibbet and steel&mdash;the accursed wheel&mdash;<br>
  A murderer in his chain.<br>
  &mdash;<i>William and Helen.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">AS the eddying currents sweep over its plains in howling,
  bleak December, the horse and her rider passed over what remained of
  Lincolnshire. Grantham is gone, and they are now more slowly looking up the
  ascent of Gonerby Hill, a path well known to Turpin; where often, in bygone
  nights, many a purse had changed its owner. With that feeling of independence
  and exhilaration which every one feels, we believe, on having climbed the
  hill-side, Turpin turned to gaze around. There was triumph in his eye. But
  the triumph was checked as his glance fell upon a gibbet near him to the
  right, on the round point of hill which is a landmark to the wide vale of
  Belvoir. Pressed as he was for time, Dick immediately struck out of the road,
  and approached the spot where it stood. Two scarecrow objects, covered with
  rags and rusty links of chains, depended from the tree. A night crow
  screaming around the carcases added to the hideous effect of the scene.
  Nothing but the living highwayman and his skeleton brethren was visible upon
  the solitary spot. Around him was the lonesome waste of hill, o'erlooking the
  moonlit valley: beneath his feet, a patch of bare and lightning-blasted sod:
  above, the wan, declining moon and skies, flaked with ghostly clouds; before
  him, the bleached bodies of the murderers, for such they were.</p>

  <p>"Will this be my lot, I marvel?" said Dick, looking upwards, with an
  involuntary shudder.</p>

  <p>"Ay, marry will it," rejoined a crouching figure, suddenly springing from
  beside a tuft of briars that skirted the blasted ground.</p>

  <p>Dick started in his saddle, while Bess reared and plunged at the sight of
  this unexpected apparition.</p>

  <p>"What, ho! thou devil's dam, Barbara, is it thou?" exclaimed Dick,
  reassured upon discovering it was the gipsy queen, and no spectre whom he
  beheld. "Stand still, Bess&mdash;stand, lass. What dost thou here, mother of
  darkness? Art gathering mandrakes for thy poisonous messes, or pilfering
  flesh from the dead? Meddle not with their bones, or I will drive thee hence.
  What dost thou here, I say, old dam of the gibbet?"</p>

  <p>"I came to die here," replied Barbara, in a feeble tone; and, throwing
  back her hood, she displayed features well-nigh as ghastly as those of the
  skeletons above her.</p>

  <p>"Indeed," replied Dick. "You've made choice of a pleasant spot, it must be
  owned. But you'll not die yet?"</p>

  <p>"Do you know whose bodies these are?" asked Barbara, pointing upwards.</p>

  <p>"Two of your race," replied Dick; "right brethren of the blade."</p>

  <p>"Two of my sons," returned Barbara; "my twin children. I am come to lay my
  bones beneath their bones&mdash;my sepulchre shall be their sepulchre; my
  body shall feed the fowls of the air as theirs have fed them. And if ghosts
  can walk, we'll scour this heath together. I tell you what, Dick Turpin,"
  said the hag, drawing as near to the highwayman as Bess would permit her;
  "dead men walk and ride&mdash;ay, <i>ride</i>!&mdash;there's a comfort for
  you. I've seen these do it. I have seen them fling off their chains, and
  dance&mdash;ay, dance with me&mdash;with their mother. No revels like dead
  men's revels, Dick. I shall soon join 'em."</p>

  <p>"You will not lay violent hands upon yourself, mother?" said Dick, with
  difficulty mastering his terror.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Barbara, in an altered tone. "But I will let nature do her
  task. Would she could do it more quickly. Such a life as mine won't go out
  without a long struggle. What have I to live for now? All are gone&mdash;she
  and her child! But what is this to you? You have no child; and if you had,
  you could not feel like a father. No matter&mdash;I rave. Listen to me. I
  have crawled hither to die. 'Tis five days since I beheld you, and during
  that time food has not passed these lips, nor aught of moisture, save
  Heaven's dew, cooled this parched throat, nor shall they to the last. That
  time cannot be far off; and now can you not guess <i>how</i> I mean to die?
  Begone and leave me; your presence troubles me. I would breathe my last
  breath alone, with none to witness the parting pang."</p>

  <p>"I will not trouble you longer, mother," said Dick, turning his mare; "nor
  will I ask your blessing."</p>

  <p>"My blessing!" scornfully ejaculated Barbara. "You shall have it if you
  will, but you will find it a curse. Stay! a thought strikes me. Whither are
  you going?"</p>

  <p>"To seek Sir Luke Rookwood," replied Dick. "Know you aught of him?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Luke Rookwood! You seek him, and would find him?" screamed
  Barbara.</p>

  <p>"I would," said Dick.</p>

  <p>"And you <i>will</i> find him," said Barbara; "and that ere long. I shall
  ne'er again behold him. Would I could. I have a message for him&mdash;one of
  life and death. Will you convey it to him?"</p>

  <p>"I will," said the highwayman.</p>

  <p>"Swear by those bones to do so," cried Barbara, pointing with her skinny
  fingers to the gibbet; "that you will do my bidding."</p>

  <p>"I swear," cried Dick.</p>

  <p>"Fail not, or <i>we</i> will haunt thee to thy life's end," cried Barbara;
  adding, as she handed a sealed package to the highwayman, "Give this to Sir
  Luke&mdash;to him alone. I would have sent it to him by other hands ere this,
  but my people have deserted me&mdash;have pillaged my stores&mdash;have
  rifled me of all save this. Give this, I say, to Sir Luke, with your own
  hands. You have sworn it, and will obey. Give it to him, and bid him think of
  Sybil as he opens it. But this must not be till Eleanor is in his power; and
  she must be present when the seal is broken. It relates to both. Dare not to
  tamper with it, or my curse shall pursue you. That packet is guarded with a
  triple spell, which to you were fatal. Obey me, and my dying breath shall
  bless thee."</p>

  <p>"Never fear," said Dick, taking the packet; "I'll not disappoint you,
  mother, depend upon it."</p>

  <p>"Hence!" cried the crone; and as she watched Dick's figure lessening upon
  the Waste, and at length beheld him finally disappear down the hill-side, she
  sank to the ground, her frail strength being entirely exhausted. "Body and
  soul may now part in peace," gasped she. "All I live for is accomplished."
  And ere one hour had elapsed, the night crow was perched upon her still
  breathing frame.</p>

  <p>Long pondering upon this singular interview, Dick pursued his way. At
  length he thought fit to examine the packet with which the old gipsy had
  entrusted him.</p>

  <p>"It feels like a casket," thought he. "It can't be gold. But then it may
  be jewels, though they don't rattle, and it ain't quite heavy enough. What
  can it be? I should like to know. There is some mystery, that's certain,
  about it; but I will not break the seal, not I. As to her spell, that I don't
  value a rush; but I've sworn to give it to Sir Luke, and deliver her message,
  and I'll keep my word if I can. He shall have it." So saying, he replaced it
  in his pocket.</p>

  &mdash;<i>Hamlet.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">TIME presses. We may not linger in our course. We must fly
  on before our flying highwayman. Full forty miles shall we pass over in a
  breath. Two more hours have elapsed, and he still urges his headlong career,
  with heart resolute as ever, and purpose yet unchanged. Fair Newark, and the
  dashing Trent, "most loved of England's streams," are gathered to his
  laurels. Broad Notts, and its heavy paths and sweeping glades; its
  waste&mdash;forest no more&mdash;of Sherwood past; bold Robin Hood and his
  merry men, his Marian and his moonlight rides, recalled, forgotten, left
  behind. Hurrah! hurrah! That wild halloo, that waving arm, that enlivening
  shout&mdash;what means it? He is once more upon Yorkshire ground; his horse's
  hoof beats once more the soil of that noble shire. So transported was Dick,
  that he could almost have flung himself from the saddle to kiss the dust
  beneath his feet. Thrice fifty miles has he run, nor has the morn yet dawned
  upon his labors. Hurrah! the end draws nigh; the goal is in view. Halloo!
  halloo! on!</p>

  <p>Bawtrey is past. He takes the lower road by Thorne and Selby. He is
  skirting the waters of the deep-channelled Don.</p>

  <p>Bess now began to manifest some slight symptoms of distress. There was a
  strain in the carriage of her throat, a dulness in her eye, a laxity in her
  ear, and a slight stagger in her gait, which Turpin noticed with
  apprehension. Still she went on, though not at the same gallant pace as
  heretofore. But, as the tired bird still battles with the blast upon the
  ocean, as the swimmer still stems the stream, though spent, on went she: nor
  did Turpin dare to check her, fearing that, if she stopped, she might lose
  her force, or, if she fell, she would rise no more.</p>

  <p>It was now that gray and grimly hour ere one flicker of orange or rose has
  gemmed the east, and when unwearying Nature herself seems to snatch brief
  repose. In the roar of restless cities, this is the only time when their
  strife is hushed. Midnight is awake&mdash;alive; the streets ring with
  laughter and with rattling wheels. At the third hour, a dead, deep silence
  prevails; the loud-voiced streets grow dumb. They are deserted of all, save
  the few guardians of the night and the skulking robber. But even far removed
  from the haunts of men and hum of towns it is the same. "Nature's best nurse"
  seems to weigh nature down, and stillness reigns throughout. Our feelings
  are, in a great measure, influenced by the hour. Exposed to the raw, crude
  atmosphere, which has neither the nipping, wholesome shrewdness of morn, nor
  the profound chillness of night, the frame vainly struggles against the dull,
  miserable sensations engendered by the damps, and at once communicates them
  to the spirits. Hope forsakes us. We are weary, exhausted. Our energy is
  dispirited. Sleep does "not weigh our eyelids down." We stare upon the
  vacancy. We conjure up a thousand restless, disheartening images. We abandon
  projects we have formed, and which, viewed through this medium, appear
  fantastical, chimerical, absurd. We want rest, refreshment, energy.</p>

  <p>We will not say that Turpin had all these misgivings. But he had to
  struggle hard with himself to set sleep and exhaustion at defiance.</p>

  <p>The moon had set. The stars,</p>

  <p class="cp"><small>Pinnacled deep in the intense main,</small></p>

  <p class="first">had all&mdash;save one, the herald of the
  dawn&mdash;withdrawn their luster. A dull mist lay on the stream, and the air
  became piercing cold. Turpin's chilled fingers could scarcely grasp the
  slackening rein, while his eyes, irritated by the keen atmosphere, hardly
  enabled him to distinguish surrounding objects, or even to guide his steed.
  It was owing, probably, to this latter circumstance, that Bess suddenly
  floundered and fell, throwing her master over her head.</p>

  <p>Turpin instantly recovered himself. His first thought was for his horse.
  But Bess was instantly upon her legs&mdash;covered with dust and foam, sides
  and cheeks&mdash;and with her large eyes glaring wildly, almost piteously,
  upon her master.</p>

  <p>"Art hurt, lass?" asked Dick, as she shook herself, and slightly shivered.
  And he proceeded to the horseman's scrutiny. "Nothing but a shake; though
  that dull eye&mdash;those quivering flanks&mdash;&mdash;" added he, looking
  earnestly at her. "She won't go much further, and I must give it
  up&mdash;what! give up the race just when it's won? No, that can't be. Ha!
  well thought on. I've a bottle of liquid, given me by an old fellow, who was
  a knowing cove and famous jockey in his day, which he swore would make a
  horse go as long as he'd a leg to carry him, and bade me keep it for some
  great occasion. I've never used it; but I'll try it now. It should be in this
  pocket. Ah! Bess, wench, I fear I'm using thee, after all, as Sir Luke did
  his mistress, that I thought so like thee. No matter! It will be a glorious
  end."</p>

  <p>Raising her head upon his shoulder, Dick poured the contents of the bottle
  down the throat of his mare. Nor had he to wait long before its invigorating
  effects were instantaneous. The fire was kindled in the glassy orb; her crest
  was once more erected; her flank ceased to quiver; and she neighed loud and
  joyously.</p>

  <p>"Egad, the old fellow was right," cried Dick. "The drink has worked
  wonders. What the devil could it have been? It smells like spirit," added he,
  examining the bottle. "I wish I'd left a taste for myself. But here's that
  will do as well." And he drained his flask of the last drop of brandy.</p>

  <p>Dick's limbs were now become so excessively stiff, that it was with
  difficulty he could remount his horse. But this necessary preliminary being
  achieved by the help of a stile, he found no difficulty in resuming his
  accustomed position upon the saddle. We know not whether there was any
  likeness between our Turpin and that modern Hercules of the sporting world,
  Mr. Osbaldeston. Far be it from us to institute any comparison, though we
  cannot help thinking that, in one particular, he resembled that famous
  "copper-bottomed" squire. This we will leave to our reader's discrimination.
  Dick bore his fatigues wonderfully. He suffered somewhat of that martyrdom
  which, according to Tom Moore, occurs "to weavers and M. P.'s, from sitting
  too long;" but again on his courser's back, he cared not for anything.</p>

  <p>Once more, at a gallant pace, he traversed the banks of the Don, skirting
  the fields of flax that bound its sides, and hurried far more swiftly than
  its current to its confluence with the Aire.</p>

  <p>Snaith was past. He was on the road to Selby when dawn first began to
  break. Here and there a twitter was heard in the hedge; a hare ran across his
  path, gray-looking as the morning self; and the mists began to rise from the
  earth. A bar of gold was drawn against the east, like the roof of a gorgeous
  palace. But the mists were heavy in this world of rivers and their tributary
  streams. The Ouse was before him, the Trent and Aire behind; the Don and
  Derwent on either hand, all in their way to commingle their currents ere they
  formed the giant Humber. Amid a region so prodigal of water, no wonder the
  dews fell thick as rain. Here and there the ground was clear; but then again
  came a volley of vapor, dim and palpable as smoke.</p>

  <p>While involved in one of these fogs, Turpin became aware of another
  horseman by his side. It was impossible to discern the features of the rider,
  but his figure in the mist seemed gigantic; neither was the color of his
  steed distinguishable. Nothing was visible except the meagre-looking,
  phantom-like outline of a horse and his rider, and, as the unknown rode upon
  the turf that edged the way, even the sound of the horse's hoofs was scarcely
  audible. Turpin gazed, not without superstitious awe. Once or twice he
  essayed to address the strange horseman, but his tongue clave to the roof of
  his mouth. He fancied he discovered in the mist-exaggerated lineaments of the
  stranger a wild and fantastic resemblance to his friend Tom King. "It must be
  Tom," thought Turpin; "he is come to warn me of my approaching end. I will
  speak to him."</p>

  <p>But terror o'ermastered his speech. He could not force out a word, and
  thus side by side they rode in silence. Quaking with fears he would scarcely
  acknowledge to himself, Dick watched every motion of his companion. He was
  still, stern, spectre-like, erect; and looked for all the world like a demon
  on his phantom steed. His courser seemed, in the indistinct outline, to be
  huge and bony, and, as he snorted furiously in the fog, Dick's heated
  imagination supplied his breath with a due proportion of flame. Not a word
  was spoken&mdash;not a sound heard, save the sullen dead beat of his hoofs
  upon the grass. It was intolerable to ride thus cheek by jowl with a goblin.
  Dick could stand it no longer. He put spurs to his horse, and endeavored to
  escape. But it might not be. The stranger, apparently without effort, was
  still by his side, and Bess's feet, in her master's apprehensions, were
  nailed to the ground. By-and-by, however, the atmosphere became clearer.
  Bright quivering beams burst through the vaporous shroud, and then it was
  that Dick discovered that the apparition of Tom King was no other than Luke
  Rookwood. He was mounted on his old horse, Rook, and looked grim and haggard
  as a ghost vanishing at the crowing of the cock.</p>

  <p>"Sir Luke Rookwood, by this light!" exclaimed Dick, in astonishment. "Why,
  I took you for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The devil, no doubt?" returned Luke, smiling sternly, "and were sorry to
  find yourself so hard pressed. Don't disquiet yourself; I am still flesh and
  blood."</p>

  <p>"Had I taken you for one of mortal mould," said Dick, "you should have
  soon seen where I'd have put you in the race. That confounded fog deceived
  me, and Bess acted the fool as well as myself. However, now I know you, Sir
  Luke, you must spur alongside, for the hawks are on the wing; and though I've
  much to say, I've not a second to lose." And Dick briefly detailed the
  particulars of his ride, concluding with his rencontre with Barbara. "Here's
  the packet," said he, "just as I got it. You must keep it till the proper
  moment. And here," added he, fumbling in his pocket for another paper, "is
  the marriage document. You are now your father's lawful son, let who will say
  you nay. Take it and welcome. If you are ever master of Miss Mowbray's hand,
  you will not forget Dick Turpin."</p>

  <p>"I will not," said Luke, eagerly grasping the certificate; "but she never
  may be mine."</p>

  <p>"You have her oath?"</p>

  <p>"I have."</p>

  <p>"What more is needed?"</p>

  <p>"Her hand."</p>

  <p>"That will follow."</p>

  <p>"It <i>shall</i> follow," replied Sir Luke, wildly. "You are right. She is
  my affianced bride&mdash;affianced before hell, if not before heaven. I have
  sealed the contract with blood&mdash;with Sybil's blood&mdash;and it shall be
  fulfilled. I have her oath&mdash;her oath&mdash;ha, ha! Though I perish in
  the attempt, I will wrest her from Ranulph's grasp. She shall never be his. I
  would stab her first. Twice have I failed in my endeavors to bear her off. I
  am from Rookwood even now. To-morrow night I shall renew the attack. Will you
  assist me?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night!" interrupted Dick.</p>

  <p>"Nay, I should say to-night. A new day has already dawned," replied
  Luke.</p>

  <p>"I will: she is at Rookwood?"</p>

  <p>"She languishes there at present, attended by her mother and her lover.
  The hall is watched and guarded. Ranulph is ever on the alert. But we will
  storm their garrison. I have a spy within its walls&mdash;a gipsy girl,
  faithful to my interests. From her I have learnt that there is a plot to wed
  Eleanor to Ranulph, and that the marriage is to take place privately
  to-morrow. This must be prevented."</p>

  <p>"It must. But why not boldly appear in person at the hall, and claim
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? I am a proscribed felon. A price is set upon my head. I am
  hunted through the country&mdash;driven to concealment, and dare not show
  myself for fear of capture. What could I do now? They would load me with
  fetters, bury me in a dungeon, and wed Eleanor to Ranulph. What would my
  rights avail? What would her oath signify to them? No; she must be mine by
  force. <i>His</i> she shall never be. Again, I ask you, will you aid me?"</p>

  <p>"I have said&mdash;I will. Where is Alan Rookwood?"</p>

  <p>"Concealed within the hut on Thorne Waste. You know it&mdash;it was one of
  your haunts."</p>

  <p>"I know it well," said Dick, "and Conkey Jem, its keeper, into the
  bargain: he is a knowing file. I'll join you at the hut at midnight, if all
  goes well. We'll bring off the wench, in spite of them all&mdash;just the
  thing I like. But in case of a break-down on my part, suppose you take charge
  of my purse in the mean time."</p>

  <p>Luke would have declined this offer.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" said Dick. "Who knows what may happen? and it's not ill-lined
  either. You'll find an odd hundred or so in that silken bag&mdash;it's not
  often your highwayman gives away a purse. Take it, man&mdash;we'll settle all
  to-night; and if I don't come, keep it&mdash;it will help you to your bride.
  And now off with you to the hut, for you are only hindering me. Adieu! My
  love to old Alan. We'll do the trick to-night. Away with you to the hut. Keep
  yourself snug there till midnight, and we'll ride over to Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"At midnight," replied Sir Luke, wheeling off, "I shall expect you."</p>

  <p>"'Ware hawks!" hallooed Dick.</p>

  <p>But Luke had vanished. In another instant Dick was scouring the plain as
  rapidly as ever. In the mean time, as Dick has casually alluded to the hawks,
  it may not be amiss to inquire how they had flown throughout the night, and
  whether they were still in chase of their quarry.</p>

  <p>With the exception of Titus, who was completely done up at Grantham,
  "having got," as he said, "a complete bellyful of it," they were still on the
  wing, and resolved sooner or later to pounce upon their prey, pursuing the
  same system as heretofore in regard to the post-horses. Major Mowbray and
  Paterson took the lead, but the irascible and invincible attorney was not far
  in their rear, his wrath having been by no means allayed by the fatigue he
  had undergone. At Bawtrey they held a council of war for a few minutes, being
  doubtful which course he had taken. Their incertitude was relieved by a foot
  traveller, who had heard Dick's loud halloo on passing the boundary of
  Nottinghamshire, and had seen him take the lower road. They struck,
  therefore, into the path at Thorne at a hazard, and were soon satisfied they
  were right. Furiously did they now spur on. They reached Selby, changed
  horses at the inn in front of the venerable cathedral church, and learnt from
  the postboy that a toilworn horseman, on a jaded steed, had ridden through
  the town about five minutes before them, and could not be more than a quarter
  of a mile in advance. "His horse was so dead beat," said the lad, "that I'm
  sure he cannot have got far; and, if you look sharp, I'll be bound you'll
  overtake him before he reaches Cawood Ferry."</p>

  <p>Mr. Coates was transported. "We'll lodge him snug in York Castle before an
  hour, Paterson," cried he, rubbing his hands.</p>

  <p>"I hope so, sir," said the chief constable, "but I begin to have some
  qualms."</p>

  <p>"Now, gentlemen," shouted the postboy, "come along. I'll soon bring you to
  him."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4-12"

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:36%">The sight renewed my courser's feet,<br>
  A moment, staggering feebly fleet,<br>
  A moment, with a faint low neigh,<br>
  He answered, and then fell.<br>
  With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,<br>
  And reeking limbs immovable,&mdash;<br>
  His first, and last career was done.<br>
  &mdash;<i>Mazeppa.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE sun had just o'ertopped the "high eastern hill," as
  Turpin reached the Ferry of Cawood, and his beams were reflected upon the
  deep and sluggish waters of the Ouse. Wearily had he dragged his course
  thither&mdash;wearily and slow. The powers of his gallant steed were spent,
  and he could scarcely keep her from sinking. It was now midway 'twixt the
  hours of five and six. Nine miles only lay before him, and that thought again
  revived him. He reached the water's edge, and hailed the ferryboat, which was
  then on the other side of the river. At that instant a loud shout smote his
  ear; it was the halloo of his pursuers. Despair was in his look. He shouted
  to the boatman, and bade him pull fast. The man obeyed; but he had to breast
  a strong stream, and had a lazy bark and heavy sculls to contend with. He had
  scarcely left the shore when, another shout was raised from the pursuers. The
  tramp of their steeds grew louder and louder.</p>

  <p>The boat had scarcely reached the middle of the stream. His captors were
  at hand. Quietly did he walk down the bank, and as cautiously enter the
  water. There was a plunge, and steed and rider were swimming down the
  river.</p>

  <p>Major Mowbray was at the brink of the stream. He hesitated an instant, and
  stemmed the tide. Seized, as it were, by a mania for equestrian distinction,
  Mr. Coates braved the torrent. Not so Paterson. He very coolly took out his
  bulldogs, and, watching Turpin, cast up in his own mind the <i>pros</i> and
  <i>cons</i> of shooting him as he was crossing. "I could certainly hit him,"
  thought, or said, the constable; "but what of that? A dead highwayman is
  worth nothing&mdash;alive, he <i>weighs</i> 300<i>l</i>. I won't shoot him,
  but I'll make a pretence." And he fired accordingly.</p>

  <p>The shot skimmed over the water, but did not, as it was intended, do much
  mischief. It, however, occasioned a mishap, which had nearly proved fatal to
  our aquatic attorney. Alarmed at the report of the pistol, in the nervous
  agitation of the moment Coates drew in his rein so tightly that his steed
  instantly sank. A moment or two afterwards he rose, shaking his ears, and
  floundering heavily towards the shore; and such was the chilling effect of
  this sudden immersion, that Mr. Coates now thought much more of saving
  himself than of capturing Turpin. Dick, meanwhile, had reached the opposite
  bank, and, refreshed by her bath, Bess scrambled up the sides of the stream,
  and speedily regained the road. "I shall do it yet," shouted Dick; "that
  stream has saved her. Hark away, lass! Hark away!"</p>

  <p>Bess heard the cheering cry, and she answered to the call. She roused all
  her energies; strained every sinew, and put forth all her remaining strength.
  Once more, on wings of swiftness, she bore him away from his pursuers, and
  Major Mowbray, who had now gained the shore, and made certain of securing
  him, beheld him spring, like a wounded hare, from beneath his very hand.</p>

  <p>"It cannot hold out," said the major; "it is but an expiring flash; that
  gallant steed must soon drop."</p>

  <p>"She be regularly booked, that's certain," said the postboy.</p>

  <p>"We shall find her on the road."</p>

  <p>Contrary to all expectation, however, Bess held on, and set pursuit at
  defiance. Her pace was swift as when she started. But it was unconscious and
  mechanical action. It wanted the ease, the lightness, the life of her former
  riding. She seemed screwed up to a task which she must execute. There was no
  flogging, no gory heel; but the heart was throbbing, tugging at the sides
  within. Her spirit spurred her onwards. Her eye was glazing; her chest
  heaving; her flank quivering; her crest again fallen. Yet she held on. "She
  is dying!" said Dick. "I feel it&mdash;&mdash;" No, she held on.</p>

  <p>Fulford is past. The towers and pinnacles of York burst upon him in all
  the freshness, the beauty, and the glory of a bright, clear, autumnal morn.
  The ancient city seemed to smile a welcome&mdash;a greeting. The noble
  Minster and its serene and massive pinnacles, crocketed, lantern-like, and
  beautiful; St. Mary's lofty spire, All-Hallows Tower, the massive mouldering
  walls of the adjacent postern, the grim castle, and Clifford's neighboring
  keep&mdash;all beamed upon him, like a bright-eyed face, that laughs out
  openly.</p>

  <p>"It is done&mdash;it is won," cried Dick. "Hurrah! hurrah!" And the sunny
  air was cleft with his shouts.</p>

  <p>Bess was not insensible to her master's exultation. She neighed feebly in
  answer to his call, and reeled forwards. It was a piteous sight to see
  her,&mdash;to mark her staring, protruding eyeball,&mdash;her shaking flanks;
  but, while life and limb held together, she held on.</p>

  <p>Another mile is past. York is near.</p>

  <p>"Hurrah!" shouted Dick; but his voice was hushed. Bess
  tottered&mdash;fell. There was a dreadful gasp&mdash;a parting moan&mdash;a
  snort; her eye gazed, for an instant, upon her master, with a dying glare;
  then grew glassy, rayless, fixed. A shiver ran through her frame. Her heart
  had burst.</p>

  <p>Dick's eyes were blinded, as with rain. His triumph, though achieved, was
  forgotten&mdash;his own safety was disregarded. He stood weeping and
  swearing, like one beside himself.</p>

  <p>"And art thou gone, Bess?" cried he, in a voice of agony, lifting up his
  courser's head, and kissing her lips, covered with blood-flecked foam. "Gone,
  gone! and I have killed the best steed that was ever crossed! And for what?"
  added Dick, beating his brow with his clenched hand&mdash;"for what? for
  what?"</p>

  <p>At this moment the deep bell of the Minster clock tolled out the hour of
  six.</p>

  <p>"I am answered," gasped Dick; "<i>it was to hear those strokes</i>."</p>

  <p>Turpin was roused from the state of stupefaction into which he had fallen
  by a smart slap on the shoulder. Recalled to himself by the blow, he started
  at once to his feet, while his hands sought his pistols: but he was spared
  the necessity of using them, by discovering in the intruder the bearded
  visage of the gipsy Balthazar. The patrico was habited in mendicant weeds,
  and sustained a large wallet upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"So it's all over with the best mare in England, I see," said Balthazar;
  "I can guess how it has happened&mdash;you are pursued?"</p>

  <p>"I am," said Dick, roughly.</p>

  <p>"Your pursuers are at hand?"</p>

  <p>"Within a few hundred yards."</p>

  <p>"Then, why stay here? Fly while you can."</p>

  <p>"Never&mdash;never," cried Turpin; "I'll fight it out here by Bess's side.
  Poor lass! I've killed her&mdash;but she has done it&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;we
  have won&mdash;what?" And his utterance was again choked.</p>

  <p>"Hark! I hear the tramp of horse, and shouts," cried the patrico. "Take
  this wallet. You will find a change of dress within it. Dart into that thick
  copse&mdash;save yourself."</p>

  <p>"But Bess&mdash;I cannot leave her," exclaimed Dick, with an agonizing
  look at his horse.</p>

  <p>"And what did Bess die for, but to save you?" rejoined the patrico.</p>

  <p>"True, true," said Dick; "but take care of her, don't let those dogs of
  hell meddle with her carcase."</p>

  <p>"Away," cried the patrico, "leave Bess to me."</p>

  <p>Possessing himself of the wallet, Dick disappeared in the adjoining
  copse.</p>

  <p>He had not been gone many seconds when Major Mowbray rode up.</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" exclaimed the Major, flinging himself from his horse, and
  seizing the patrico; "this is not Turpin."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," replied Balthazar, coolly. "I am not exactly the figure
  for a highwayman."</p>

  <p>"Where is he? What has become of him?" asked Coates, in despair, as he and
  Paterson joined the major.</p>

  <p>"Escaped, I fear," replied the major. "Have you seen any one, fellow?"
  added he, addressing the patrico.</p>

  <p>"I have seen no one," replied Balthazar. "I am only this instant arrived.
  This dead horse lying in the road attracted my attention."</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Paterson, leaping from his steed, "this may be Turpin
  after all. He has as many disguises as the devil himself, and may have
  carried that goat's hair in his pocket." Saying which, he seized the patrico
  by the beard, and shook it with as little reverence as the Gaul handled the
  hirsute chin of the Roman senator.</p>

  <p>"The devil! hands off," roared Balthazar. "By Salamon, I won't stand such
  usage. Do you think a beard like mine is the growth of a few minutes? Hands
  off! I say."</p>

  <p>"Regularly done!" said Paterson, removing his hold of the patrico's chin,
  and looking as blank as a cartridge.</p>

  <p>"Ay," exclaimed Coates; "all owing to this worthless piece of carrion. If
  it were not that I hope to see him dangling from those walls"&mdash;pointing
  towards the Castle&mdash;"I should wish her master were by her side now. To
  the dogs with her." And he was about to spurn the breathless carcase of poor
  Bess, when a sudden blow, dealt by the patrico's staff, felled him to the
  ground.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you to molest me," said Balthazar, about to attack
  Paterson.</p>

  <p>"Come, come," said the discomfited chief constable, "no more of this. It's
  plain we're in the wrong box. Every bone in my body aches sufficiently
  without the aid of your cudgel, old fellow. Come, Mr. Coates, take my arm,
  and let's be moving. We've had an infernal long ride for nothing."</p>

  <p>"Not so," replied Coates; "I've paid pretty dearly for it. However, let us
  see if we can get any breakfast at the Bowling-green, yonder; though I've
  already had my morning draught," added the facetious man of law, looking at
  his dripping apparel.</p>

  <p>"Poor Black Bess!" said Major Mowbray, wistfully regarding the body of the
  mare, as it lay stretched at his feet. "Thou deservedst a better fate, and a
  better master. In thee, Dick Turpin has lost his best friend. His exploits
  will, henceforth, want the coloring of romance, which thy unfailing energies
  threw over them. Light lie the ground over thee, thou matchless mare!"</p>

  <p>To the Bowling-green the party proceeded, leaving the patrico in
  undisturbed possession of the lifeless body of Black Bess. Major Mowbray
  ordered a substantial repast to be prepared with all possible expedition.</p>

  <p>A countryman, in a smock-frock, was busily engaged at his morning's
  meal.</p>

  <p>"To see that fellow bolt down his breakfast, one would think he had fasted
  for a month," said Coates; "see the wholesome effects of an honest,
  industrious life, Paterson. I envy him his appetite&mdash;I should fall to
  with more zest were Dick Turpin in his place."</p>

  <p>The countryman looked up. He was an odd-looking fellow, with a terrible
  squint, and a strange, contorted countenance.</p>

  <p>"An ugly dog!" exclaimed Paterson: "what a devil of a twist he has
  got!"</p>

  <p>"What's that you says about Dick Taarpin, measter?" asked the countryman,
  with his mouth half full of bread.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen aught of him?" asked Coates.</p>

  <p>"Not I," mumbled the rustic; "but I hears aw the folks hereabouts talk on
  him. They say as how he sets all the lawyers and constables at defiance, and
  laughs in his sleeve at their efforts to cotch him&mdash;ha, ha! He gets over
  more ground in a day than they do in a week&mdash;ho, ho!"</p>

  <p>"That's all over now," said Coates, peevishly. "He has cut his own
  throat&mdash;ridden his famous mare to death."</p>

  <p>The countryman almost choked himself, in the attempt to bolt a huge
  mouthful. "Ay&mdash;indeed, measter! How happened that?" asked he, so soon as
  he recovered speech.</p>

  <p>"The fool rode her from London to York last night," returned Coates; "such
  a feat was never performed before. What horse could be expected to live
  through such work as that?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, he were a foo' to attempt that," observed the countryman; "but you
  followed belike?"</p>

  <p>"We did."</p>

  <p>"And took him arter all, I reckon?" asked the rustic, squinting more
  horribly than ever.</p>

  <p>"No," returned Coates, "I can't say we did; but we'll have him yet. I'm
  pretty sure he can't be far off. We may be nearer him than we imagine."</p>

  <p>"May be so, measter," returned the countryman; "but might I be so bold as
  to ax how many horses you used i' the chase&mdash;some half-dozen,
  maybe?"</p>

  <p>"Half a dozen!" growled Paterson; "we had twenty at the least."</p>

  <p>"And I ONE!" mentally ejaculated Turpin, for he was the
  countryman.</p><a id="ch5-1"

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:33%">&mdash;<i>Prince of Prigs' Revels.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">THE hut on Thorne Waste, to which we have before
  incidentally alluded, and whither we are now about to repair, was a low, lone
  hovel, situate on the banks of the deep and oozy Don, at the eastern
  extremity of that extensive moor. Ostensibly its owner fulfilled the duties
  of ferryman to that part of the river; but as the road which skirted his
  tenement was little frequented, his craft was, for the most part, allowed to
  sleep undisturbed in her moorings.</p>

  <p>In reality, however, he was the inland agent of a horde of smugglers who
  infested the neighboring coast; his cabin was their rendezvous; and not
  unfrequently, it was said, the depository of their contraband goods. Conkey
  Jem&mdash;so was he called by his associates, on account of the
  Slawkenbergian promontory which decorated his countenance&mdash;had been an
  old hand at the same trade; but having returned from a seven years' leave of
  absence from his own country, procured by his lawless life, now managed
  matters with more circumspection and prudence, and had never since been
  detected in his former illicit traffic; nor, though so marvellously gifted in
  that particular himself, was he ever known to <i>nose</i> upon any of his
  accomplices; or, in other words, to betray them. On the contrary, his hut was
  a sort of asylum for all fugitives from justice; and although the sanctity of
  his walls would, in all probability, have been little regarded, had any one
  been, detected within them, yet, strange to say, even if a robber had been
  tracked&mdash;as it often chanced&mdash;to Jem's immediate neighborhood, all
  traces of him were sure to be lost at the ferryman's hut; and further search
  was useless.</p>

  <p>Within, the hut presented such an appearance as might be expected, from
  its owner's pursuits and its own unpromising exterior. Consisting of little
  more than a couple of rooms, the rude whitewashed walls exhibited, in lieu of
  prints of more pretension, a gallery of choicely-illustrated ballads,
  celebrating the exploits of various highwaymen, renowned in song, amongst
  which our friend Dick Turpin figured conspicuously upon his sable steed, Bess
  being represented by a huge rampant black patch, and Dick, with a pistol
  considerably longer than the arm that sustained it. Next to this curious
  collection was a drum-net, a fishing-rod, a landing-net, an eel-spear, and
  other piscatorial apparatus, with a couple of sculls and a boat-hook,
  indicative of Jem's ferryman's office, suspended by various hooks; the whole
  blackened and begrimed by peat-smoke, there being no legitimate means of
  <i>exit</i> permitted to the vapor generated by the turf-covered hearthstone.
  The only window, indeed, in the hut, was to the front; the back apartment,
  which served Jem for dormitory, had no aperture whatever for the admission of
  light, except such as was afforded through the door of communication between
  the rooms. A few broken rush-bottomed chairs, with a couple of dirty tables,
  formed the sum total of the ferryman's furniture.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the grotesque effect of his exaggerated nasal organ, Jem's
  aspect was at once savage and repulsive; his lank black hair hung about his
  inflamed visage in wild elf locks, the animal predominating throughout; his
  eyes were small, red, and wolfish, and glared suspiciously from beneath his
  scarred and tufted eyebrows; while certain of his teeth projected, like the
  tusks of a boar, from out his coarse-lipped, sensual mouth. Dwarfish in
  stature, and deformed in person, Jem was built for strength; and what with
  his width of shoulder and shortness of neck, his figure looked as square and
  as solid as a cube. His throat and hirsute chest, constantly exposed to the
  weather, had acquired a glowing tan, while his arms, uncovered to the
  shoulders, and clothed with fur, like a bear's hide, down, almost, to the
  tips of his fingers, presented a knot of folded muscles, the concentrated
  force of which few would have desired to encounter in action.</p>

  <p>It was now on the stroke of midnight; and Jem, who had been lying extended
  upon the floor of his hovel, suddenly aroused by that warning impulse which
  never fails to awaken one of his calling at the exact moment when they
  require to be upon the alert, now set about fanning into flame the expiring
  fuel upon his hearth. Having succeeded in igniting further portions of the
  turf, Jem proceeded to examine the security of his door and window, and
  satisfied that lock and bolt were shot, and that the shutter was carefully
  closed, he kindled a light at his fire, and walked towards his bedroom. But
  it was not to retire for the night that the ferryman entered his dormitory.
  Beside his crazy couch stood a litter of empty bottles and a beer cask,
  crowding the chamber. The latter he rolled aside, and pressing his foot upon
  the plank beneath it, the board gave way, and a trap-door opening, discovered
  a ladder, conducting, apparently, into the bowels of the earth. Jem leaned
  over the abyss, and called in hoarse accents to some one below.</p>

  <p>An answer was immediately returned, and a light became soon afterwards
  visible at the foot of the ladder. Two figures next ascended; the first who
  set foot within the ferryman's chamber was Alan Rookwood: the other, as the
  reader may perhaps conjecture, was his grandson.</p>

  <p>"Is it the hour?" asked Luke, as he sprang from out the trap-door.</p>

  <p>"Ay," replied Jem, with a coarse laugh, "or I had not disturbed myself to
  call you. But, maybe," added he, softening his manner a little, "you'll like
  some refreshments before you start? A stoup of Nantz will put you in cue for
  the job, ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>"Not I," replied Luke, who could ill tolerate his companion's
  familiarity.</p>

  <p>"Give me to drink," said Alan, walking feebly towards the fire, and
  extending his skinny fingers before it. "I am chilled by the damps of that
  swampy cave&mdash;the natural heat within me is nigh extinguished."</p>

  <p>"Here is that shall put fresh marrow into your old bones," returned Jem,
  handing him a tumbler of brandy; "never stint it. I'll be sworn you'll be the
  better on't, for you look desperate queer, man, about the mazard."</p>

  <p>Alan was, in sooth, a ghastly spectacle. The events of the last few days
  had wrought a fearful change. His countenance was almost exanimate; and when,
  with shaking hand and trembling lips, he had drained the fiery potion to the
  dregs, a terrible grimace was excited upon his features, such as is produced
  upon the corpse by the action of the galvanic machine. Even Jem regarded him
  with a sort of apprehension. After he had taken breath for a moment, Alan
  broke out into a fit of wild and immoderate laughter.</p>

  <p>"Why, ay," said he, "this is indeed to grow young again, and to feel fresh
  fire within one's veins. Who would have thought so much of life and energy
  could reside in this little vessel? I am myself once more, and not the same
  soulless, pulseless lump of clay I was a moment or two back. The damps of
  that den had destroyed me&mdash;and the solitude&mdash;the <i>waking
  dreams</i> I've had&mdash;the visions! horrible! I will not think of them. I
  am better now&mdash;ready to execute my plans&mdash;<i>your</i> plans I
  should say, grandson Luke. Are our horses in readiness? Why do we tarry? The
  hour is arrived, and I would not that my new-blown courage should evaporate
  ere the great work for which I live be accomplished. That done, I ask no
  further stimulant. Let us away."</p>

  <p>"We tarry but for Turpin," said Luke; "I am as impatient as yourself. I
  fear some mischance must have befallen him, or he would have been true to his
  appointment. Do you not think so?" he added, addressing the ferryman.</p>

  <p>"Why," replied Jem, reluctantly, "since you put it home to me, and I can't
  conceal it no longer, I'll tell you what I didn't tell afore, for fear you
  should be down in the mouth about it. Dick Turpin can do nothing for
  you&mdash;he's grabb'd."</p>

  <p>"Turpin apprehended!" ejaculated Luke.</p>

  <p>"Ay," returned Jem. "I learnt from a farmer who crossed the ferry at
  nightfall, that he were grabb'd this morning at York, after having ridden his
  famous cherry-colored prad to death&mdash;that's what hurts me more not all
  the rest; though I fear Dick will scarce cheat the nubbing cheat this go. His
  time's up, I calculate."</p>

  <p>"Will you supply his place and accompany us?" asked Luke of the
  ferryman.</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied Jem, shaking his head; "there's too much risk, and too
  little profit, in the business for me&mdash;it won't pay."</p>

  <p>"And what might tempt you to undertake the enterprise?" asked Alan.</p>

  <p>"More than you have to offer, Master Peter," replied Jem, who had not been
  enlightened upon the subject of Alan's real name or condition.</p>

  <p>"How know you that?" demanded Alan. "Name your demand."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I'll not say but a hundred pounds, if you had it, might bribe
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To part with your soul to the devil, I doubt not," said Luke, fiercely
  stamping the ground. "Let us be gone. We need not his mercenary aid. We will
  do without him."</p>

  <p>"Stay," said Alan, "you shall have the hundred, provided you will assure
  us of your services."</p>

  <p>"Cut no more blarneyfied whids, Master Sexton," replied Jem, in a gruff
  tone. "If I'm to go, I must have the chink down, and that's more nor either
  of you can do, I'm thinking."</p>

  <p>"Give me your purse," whispered Alan to his grandson. "Pshaw," continued
  he, "do you hesitate? This man can do much for us. Think upon Eleanor, and be
  prudent. You cannot accomplish your task unaided." Taking the amount from the
  purse, he gave it to the ferryman, adding, "If we succeed, the sum shall be
  doubled; and now let us set out."</p>

  <p>During Alan's speech, Jem's sharp eyes had been fastened upon the purse,
  while he mechanically clutched the bank-notes which were given to him. He
  could not remove his gaze, but continued staring at the treasure before him,
  as if he would willingly, by force, have made it all his own.</p>

  <p>Alan saw the error he had committed in exposing the contents of the purse
  to the avaricious ferryman, and was about to restore it to Luke, when the bag
  was suddenly snatched from his grasp, and himself levelled by a blow upon the
  floor. Conkey Jem found the temptation irresistible. Knowing himself to be a
  match for both his companions, and imagining he was secure from interruption,
  he conceived the idea of making away with them, and possessing himself of
  their wealth. No sooner had he disposed of Alan, than he assailed Luke, who
  met his charge half way. With the vigor and alacrity of the latter the reader
  is already acquainted, but he was no match for the herculean strength of the
  double-jointed ferryman, who, with the ferocity of the boar he so much
  resembled, thus furiously attacked him. Nevertheless, as may be imagined, he
  was not disposed to yield up his life tamely. He saw at once the villain's
  murderous intentions, and, well aware of his prodigious power, would not have
  risked a close struggle could he have avoided it. Snatching the eel-spear
  from the wall, he had hurled it at the head of his adversary, but without
  effect. In the next instant he was locked in a clasp terrible as that of a
  Polar bear. In spite of all his struggles, Luke was speedily hurled to the
  ground: and Jem, who had thrown himself upon him, was apparently searching
  about for some weapon to put a bloody termination to the conflict, when the
  trampling of a horse was heard at the door, three taps were repeated slowly,
  one after the other, and a call resounded from a whistle.</p>

  <p>"Damnation!" ejaculated Jem, gruffly, "interrupted!" And he seemed
  irresolute, slightly altering his position on Luke's body.</p>

  <p>The moment was fortunate for Luke, and, in all probability, saved his
  life. He extricated himself from the ferryman's grasp, regained his feet,
  and, what was of more importance, the weapon he had thrown away.</p>

  <p>"Villain!" cried he, about to plunge the spear with all his force into his
  enemy's side, "you shall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The whistle was again heard without.</p>

  <p>"Don't you hear that?" cried Jem: "'Tis Turpin's call."</p>

  <p>"Turpin!" echoed Luke, dropping the point of his weapon. "Unbar the door,
  you treacherous rascal, and admit him."</p>

  <p>"Well, say no more about it, Sir Luke," said Jem, fawningly; "I knows I
  owes you my life, and I thank you for it. Take back the lowre. He should not
  have shown it me&mdash;it was that as did all the mischief."</p>

  <p>"Unbar the door, and parley not," said Luke contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Jem complied with pretended alacrity, but real reluctance, casting
  suspicious glances at Luke as he withdrew the bolts. The door at length being
  opened, haggard, exhausted, and covered with dust, Dick Turpin staggered into
  the hut.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am here," said he, with a hollow laugh. "I've kept my
  word&mdash;ha, ha! I've been damnably put to it; but here I am, ha, ha!" And
  he sank upon one of the stools.</p>

  <p>"We heard you were apprehended," said Luke. "I am glad to find the
  information was false," added he, glancing angrily at the ferryman.</p>

  <p>"Whoever told you that, told you a lie, Sir Luke," replied Dick; "but what
  are you scowling at, old Charon?&mdash;and you, Sir Luke? Why do you glower
  at each other? Make fast the door&mdash;bolt it, Cerberus&mdash;right! Now
  give me a glass of brandy, and then I'll talk&mdash;a
  bumper&mdash;so&mdash;another. What's that I see&mdash;a dead man? Old
  Peter&mdash;Alan I mean&mdash;has anything happened to him, that he has taken
  his measure there so quietly?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, I trust," said Luke, stooping to raise up his grandsire. "The
  blow has stunned him."</p>

  <p>"The blow?" repeated Turpin. "What! there <i>has</i> been a quarrel then?
  I thought as much from your amiable looks at each other. Come, come, we must
  have no differences. Give the old earthworm a taste of this&mdash;I'll engage
  it will bring him to fast enough. Ay, rub his temples with it if you'd
  rather; but it's a better remedy down the gullet&mdash;the natural course;
  and hark ye, Jem, search your crib quickly, and see if you have any
  <i>grub</i> within it, and any more <i>bub</i> in the cellar: I'm as hungry
  as a hunter, and as thirsty as a camel."</p>

     iron! Thrust away!<br>
  &mdash;<span class="smcap">Hayward'</span>s <i>Translation of
  Faust</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">CONKEY JEM went in search of such provisions as his hovel
  afforded. Turpin, meantime, lent his assistance towards the revival of Alan
  Rookwood; and it was not long before his efforts, united with those of Luke,
  were successful, and Alan restored to consciousness. He was greatly surprised
  to find the highwayman had joined them, and expressed an earnest desire to
  quit the hut as speedily as possible.</p>

  <p>"That shall be done forthwith, my dear fellow," said Dick. "But if you had
  fasted as long as I have done, and gone through a few of my fatigues into the
  bargain, you would perceive, without difficulty, the propriety of supping
  before you started. Here comes Old Nosey, with a flitch of bacon and a loaf.
  Egad, I can scarce wait for the toasting. In my present mood, I could almost
  devour a grunter in the sty." Whereupon he applied himself to the loaf, and
  to a bottle of stout March ale, which Jem placed upon the table, quaffing
  copious draughts of the latter, while the ferryman employed himself in
  toasting certain rashers of the flitch upon the hissing embers.</p>

  <p>Luke, meanwhile, stalked impatiently about the room. He had laid aside his
  tridental spear, having first, however, placed a pistol within his breast to
  be ready for instant service, should occasion demand it, as he could now put
  little reliance upon the ferryman's fidelity. He glanced with impatience at
  Turpin, who pursued his meal with steady voracity, worthy of a half-famished
  soldier; but the highwayman returned no answer to his looks, except such as
  was conveyed by the incessant clatter of his masticating jaws, during the
  progress of his, apparently, interminable repast.</p>

  <p>"Ready for you in a second, Sir Luke," said Dick; "all right
  now&mdash;capital ale, Charon&mdash;strong as Styx&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;one
  other rasher, and I've done. Sorry to keep you&mdash;can't conceive how
  cleverly I put the winkers upon 'em at York, in the dress of a countryman;
  all owing to old Balty, the patrico, an old pal&mdash;ha, ha! My old pals
  never <i>nose</i> upon me&mdash;eh, Nosey&mdash;always help one out of the
  water&mdash;always staunch. Here's health to you, old crony."</p>

  <p>Jem returned a sulky response, as he placed the last rasher on the table,
  which was speedily discussed.</p>

  <p>"Poor Bess!" muttered Dick, as he quaffed off the final glass of ale.
  "Poor lass! we buried her by the roadside, beneath the
  trees&mdash;deep&mdash;deep. Her remains shall never be disturbed. Alas!
  alas! my bonny Black Bess! But no matter, her name is yet alive&mdash;her
  deeds will survive her&mdash;the trial is over. And now," continued he,
  rising from his seat, "I'm with you. Where are the tits?"</p>

  <p>"In the stable, under ground," growled Jem.</p>

  <p>Alan Rookwood, in the mean time, had joined his grandson, and they
  conversed an instant or two apart.</p>

  <p>"My strength will not bear me through the night," said he. "That fellow
  has thoroughly disabled me. You must go without me to the hall. Here is the
  key of the secret passage. You know the entrance. I will await you in the
  tomb."</p>

  <p>"The tomb!" echoed Luke.</p>

  <p>"Ay, our family vault," returned Alan, with a ghastly grin&mdash;"it is
  the only place of security for me now. Let me see <i>her</i> there. Let me
  know that my vengeance is complete, that I triumph in my death over him, the
  accursed <i>brother</i>, through you, my grandson. <i>You</i> have a rival
  brother&mdash;a successful one; you know now what hatred is."</p>

  <p>"I do," returned Luke, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"But not such hate as mine, which, through a life, a long life, hath
  endured, intense as when 'twas first engendered in my bosom; which <i>from
  one</i> hath spread o'er all my race&mdash;o'er all save <i>you</i>&mdash;and
  which even now, when death stares me in the face&mdash;when the spirit pants
  to fly from its prison-house, burns fiercely as ever. You cannot know what
  hate like that may be. You must have wrongs&mdash;such wrongs as <i>mine</i>
  first."</p>

  <p>"My hate to Ranulph is bitter as your own to Sir Reginald."</p>

  <p>"Name him not," shrieked Alan. "But, oh! to think upon the bride he robbed
  me of&mdash;the young&mdash;the beautiful!&mdash;whom I loved to madness;
  whose memory is a barbed shaft, yet rankling keen as ever at my heart. God of
  Justice! how is it that I have thus long survived? But some men die by
  inches. My dying lips shall name him once again, and then 'twill be but to
  blend his name with curses."</p>

  <p>"I speak of him no more," said Luke. "I will meet you in the vault."</p>

  <p>"Remember, to-morrow is her wedding day with Ranulph."</p>

  <p>"Think you I forget it?"</p>

  <p>"Bear it constantly in mind. To-morrow's dawn must see her <i>yours</i> or
  <i>his</i>. You have her oath. To you or to death she is affianced. If she
  should hesitate in her election, do not you hesitate. Woman's will is fickle;
  her scruples of conscience will be readily overcome; she will not heed her
  vows&mdash;but let her not escape you. Cast off all your weakness. You are
  young, and not as I am, age-enfeebled. Be firm, and," added he, with a look
  of terrible meaning, "if all else should fail&mdash;if you are
  surrounded&mdash;if you cannot bear her off&mdash;use this," and he placed a
  dagger in Luke's hands. "It has avenged me, ere now, on a perjured wife, it
  will avenge you of a forsworn mistress, and remove all obstacle to
  Rookwood."</p>

  <p>Luke took the weapon.</p>

  <p>"Would you have me kill her?" demanded he.</p>

  <p>"Sooner than she should be Ranulph's."</p>

  <p>"Ay, aught sooner than that. But I would not murder both."</p>

  <p>"Both!" echoed Alan. "I understand you not."</p>

  <p>"Sybil and Eleanor," replied Luke; "for, as surely as I live, Sybil's
  death will lie at my door."</p>

  <p>"How so?" asked Alan; "the poison was self-ministered."</p>

  <p>"True," replied Luke, with terrible emphasis, "but I <i>spoke daggers</i>.
  Hearken to me," said he, hollowly whispering in his grandsire's ears.
  "Methinks I am not long for this world. I have seen her since her death!"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut," replied Alan. "'Tis not for you&mdash;a man&mdash;to talk
  thus. A truce to these womanish fancies."</p>

  <p>"Womanish or not," returned Luke; "either my fancy has deceived me, or I
  beheld her, distinctly as I now behold you, within yon cave, while you were
  sleeping by my side."</p>

  <p>"It is disordered fancy," said Alan Rookwood. "You will live&mdash;live to
  inherit Rookwood&mdash;live to see them fall crushed beneath your feet. For
  myself, if I but see you master of Eleanor's hand, or know that she no longer
  lives to bless your rival, or to mar your prospects, I care not how soon I
  brave my threatened doom."</p>

  <p>"Of one or other you shall be resolved to-night," said Luke, placing the
  dagger within his vest.</p>

  <p>At this moment a trampling of a horse was heard before the hovel, and in
  another instant a loud knocking resounded from the door. The ferryman
  instantly extinguished the light, motioning his companions to remain
  silent.</p>

  <p>"What, ho!" shouted a voice. "Ferry wanted."</p>

  <p>"Gad zooks!" exclaimed Dick. "As I live, 'tis Major Mowbray!"</p>

  <p>"Major Mowbray!" echoed Alan, in amazement "What doth he here?"</p>

  <p>"He must be on his way from York to Rookwood, I conclude," said Dick. "If
  he's here, I'll engage the others are not far off."</p>

  <p>Scarcely were the words out of Dick's mouth, when further clatter was
  heard at the door, and the tones of Coates were heard, in <i>altissimo</i>
  key, demanding admittance.</p>

  <p>"Let us retire into the next room," whispered Turpin, "and then admit them
  by all means, Conkey. And, hark ye, manage to detain them a few seconds."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it," said Jem. "There's a bit of a hole you can peep
  through."</p>

  <p>Another loud rat-tat was heard at the door, threatening to burst it from
  its hinges.</p>

  <p>"Well, I be coming," said Jem, seeing the coast was clear, in a drowsy,
  yawning tone, as if just awakened from sleep. "You'll cross the river none
  the faster for making so much noise."</p>

  <p>With these words he unbarred the door, and Coates and Paterson, who, it
  appeared, were proceeding to Rookwood, entered the hovel. Major Mowbray
  remained on horseback at the door.</p>

  <p>"Can you find us a glass of brandy to keep out the fog?" said Coates, who
  knew something of our ferryman's vocations. "I know you are a lad of amazing
  <i>spirit</i>."</p>

  <p>"May be I can, master, if I choose. But won't the other gemman walk
  in-doors likewise?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," said Coates; "Major Mowbray don't choose to dismount."</p>

  <p>"Well, as you please," said Jem. "It'll take me a minute or two to get the
  punt in order for all them prads."</p>

  <p>"The brandy in the first place," said Coates. "What's here?" added the
  loquacious attorney, noticing the remnants of Turpin's repast. "But that
  we're hurried, I should like a little frizzled bacon myself."</p>

  <p>Jem opened the door of his dormitory with the greatest caution, though
  apparent indifference, and almost instantly returned with the brandy. Coates
  filled a glass for Paterson, and then another for himself. The ferryman left
  the house apparently to prepare his boat, half closing the door after
  him.</p>

  <p>"By my faith! this is the right thing, Paterson," said the attorney. "We
  may be sure the strength of this was never tested by a gauger's proof. Take
  another thimbleful. We've twelve miles and a heavy pull to go through ere we
  reach Rookwood. After all, we made but a poor night's work of it, Master
  Constable. Cursed stupid in us to let him escape. I only wish we had such
  another chance. Ah, if we had him within reach now, how we would spring upon
  him&mdash;secure him in an instant. I should glory in the encounter. I tell
  you what, Paterson, if ever he is taken, I shall make a point of attending
  his execution, and see whether he dies game. Ha, ha! You think he's sure to
  swing, Paterson, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," replied the chief constable. "I wish I was as certain of my
  reward as that Turpin will eventually figure at the scragging-post."</p>

  <p>"Your reward!" replied Coates. "Make yourself easy on that score, my boy;
  you shall have your dues, depend upon it. Nay, for the matter of that, I'll
  give you the money now, if you think proper."</p>

  <p>"Nothing like time present," said Paterson. "We'll make all square at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Coates, taking out a pocket-book, "you shall have the
  hundred I promised. You won't get Turpin's reward, the three hundred pounds;
  but that can't be helped. You shall have mine&mdash;always a man of my word,
  Paterson," continued the attorney, counting out the money. "My father, the
  thief-taker, was a man of his word before me."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said the chief constable; "I shall always be happy to serve
  you."</p>

  <p>"And then there's that other affair," said the attorney, mysteriously,
  still occupied in doling out his bank-notes, "that Luke Bradley's case; the
  fellow, I mean, who calls himself Sir Luke Rookwood&mdash;ha, ha! A rank
  impostor! Two fives, that makes fifty: you want another fifty, Paterson. As I
  was saying, we may make a good job of that&mdash;we must ferret him out. I
  know who will come down properly for that; and if we could only tuck him up
  with his brother blade, why it would be worth double. He's all along been a
  thorn in my Lady Rookwood's side; he's an artful scoundrel."</p>

  <p>"Leave him to me," said Paterson; "I'll have him in less than a week.
  What's your charge against him?"</p>

  <p>"Felony, burglary, murder, every description of crime under the heavens,"
  said Coates. "He's a very devil incarnate. Dick Turpin is as mild as milk
  compared with him. By-the-by, now I think of it, this Jem, Conkey Jem, as
  folks call him, may know something about him; he's a keen file; I'll sound
  him. Thirty, forty, fifty&mdash;there's the exact amount. So much for Dick
  Turpin."</p>

  <p>"Dick Turpin thanks you for it in person," said Dick, suddenly snatching
  the whole sum from Paterson's hands, and felling the chief constable with a
  blow of one of his pistols. "I wish I was as sure of escaping the gallows as
  I am certain that Paterson has got his reward. You stare, sir. You are once
  more in the hands of the Philistines. See who is at your elbow."</p>

  <p>Coates, who was terrified almost out of his senses at the sight of Turpin,
  scarcely ventured to turn his head; but when he did so, he was perfectly
  horror-stricken at the threatening aspect of Luke, who held a cutlass in his
  hand, which he had picked up in the ferryman's bedroom.</p>

  <p>"So you would condemn me for crimes I have never committed," said Luke. "I
  am tempted, I own, to add the destruction of your worthless existence to
  their number."</p>

  <p>"Mercy, for God's sake, mercy!" cried Coates, throwing himself at Luke's
  feet. "I meant not what I said."</p>

  <p>"Hence, reptile," said Luke, pushing him aside; "I leave you to be dealt
  upon by others."</p>

  <p>At this juncture, the door of the hut was flung open, and in rushed Major
  Mowbray, sword in hand, followed by Conkey Jem.</p>

  <p>"There he stands, sir," cried the latter; "upon him!"</p>

  <p>"What! Conkey Jem turned snitch upon his pals?" cried Dick; "I scarce
  believe my own ears."</p>

  <p>"Make yourself scarce, Dick," growled Jem; "the jigger's open, and the
  boat loose. Leave Luke to his fate. He's sold."</p>

  <p>"Never! vile traitor," shouted Dick; "'tis thou art <i>sold</i>, not he;"
  and, almost ere the words were spoken, a ball was lodged in the brain of the
  treacherous ferryman.</p>

  <p>Major Mowbray, meanwhile, had rushed furiously upon Luke, who met his
  assault with determined calmness. The strife was sharp, and threatened a
  speedy and fatal issue. On the Major's side it was a desperate attack of cut
  and thrust, which Luke had some difficulty in parrying; but as yet no wounds
  were inflicted. Soldier as was the Major, Luke was not a whit inferior to him
  in his knowledge of the science of defence, and in the exercise of the
  broadsword he was perhaps the more skilful of the two: upon the present
  occasion his coolness stood him in admirable stead. Seeing him hard pressed,
  Turpin would have come to his assistance; but Luke shouted to him to stand
  aside, and all that Dick could do, amid the terrific clash of steel, was to
  kick the tables out of the way of the combatants. Luke's aim was now slightly
  grazed by a cut made by the Major, which he had parried. The smart of the
  wound roused his ire. He attacked his adversary in his turn, with so much
  vigor and good will, that, driven backwards by the irresistible assault,
  Major Mowbray stumbled over the ferryman's body, which happened to lie in his
  way; and his sword being struck from his grasp, his life became at once at
  his assailant's disposal.</p>

  <p>Luke sheathed his sword. "Major Mowbray," said he, sternly, "your life is
  in my power. I spare it for the blood that is between us&mdash;for your
  sister's sake. I would not raise my hand against her brother."</p>

  <p>"I disclaim your kindred with me, villain!" wrathfully exclaimed the
  Major. "I hold you no otherwise than as a wretched impostor, who has set up
  claims he cannot justify; and as to my sister, if you dare to couple her
  name&mdash;&mdash;" and the Major made an ineffectual attempt to raise
  himself, and to regain his sword, which Turpin, however, removed.</p>

  <p>"Dare!" echoed Luke, scornfully; "hereafter, you may learn to fear my
  threats, and acknowledge the extent of my daring; and in that confidence I
  give you life. Listen to me, sir. I am bound for Rookwood. I have private
  access to the house&mdash;to your sister's chamber&mdash;<i>her
  chamber</i>&mdash;mark you that! I shall go armed&mdash;attended. This night
  she shall be mine. From you&mdash;from Ranulph&mdash;from Lady Rookwood, from
  all will I bear her off. She shall be mine, and you, before the dawn, my
  brother, or&mdash;&mdash;" And Luke paused.</p>

  <p>"What further villainy remains untold?" inquired the Major, fiercely.</p>

  <p>"You shall bewail your sister's memory," replied Luke, gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I embrace the latter alternative with rapture," replied the
  Major&mdash;"God grant her firmness to resist you. But I tremble for her."
  And the stern soldier groaned aloud in his agony.</p>

  <p>"Here is a cord to bind him," said Turpin; "he must remain a prisoner
  here."</p>

  <p>"Right," said Alan Rookwood, "unless&mdash;but enough blood has been shed
  already."</p>

  <p>"Ay, marry has there," said Dick, "and I had rather not have given Conkey
  Jem a taste of blue plumb, had there been any other mode of silencing the
  snitching scoundrel, which there was not. As to the Major, he's a gallant
  enemy, and shall have fair play as long as Dick Turpin stands by. Come, sir,"
  added he, to the Major, as he bound him hand and foot with the rope, "I'll do
  it as gently as I can. You had better submit with a good grace. There's no
  help for it. And now for my friend Paterson, who was so anxious to furnish me
  with a hempen cravat, before my neck was in order, he shall have an extra
  twist of the rope himself, to teach him the inconvenience of a tight
  neckcloth when he recovers." Saying which, he bound Paterson in such a
  manner, that any attempt at liberation on the chief constable's part would
  infallibly strangle him. "As to you, Mr. Coates," said he, addressing the
  trembling man of law, "you shall proceed to Rookwood with us. You may yet be
  useful, and I'll accommodate you with a seat behind my own saddle&mdash;a
  distinction I never yet conferred upon any of your tribe. Recollect the
  countryman at the Bowling-green at York&mdash;ha, ha! Come along, sir." And
  having kicked out the turf fire, Dick prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>It would be vain to describe the feelings of rage and despair which
  agitated the major's bosom, as he saw the party quit the hovel, accompanied
  by Coates. Aware as he was of their destination, after one or two desperate
  but ineffectual attempts to liberate himself, by which he only increased the
  painful constriction of his bonds, without in the slightest degree
  ameliorating his condition, he resigned himself, with bitterest forebodings,
  to his fate. There was no one even to sympathize with his sufferings. Beside
  him lay the gory corpse of the ferryman, and, at a little distance, the
  scarcely more animate frame of the chief constable. And here we must leave
  him, to follow, for a short space, the course of Luke and his companions.</p>

  <p>Concerning themselves little about their own steeds, the party took those
  which first offered, and embarking man and horse in the boat, soon pushed
  across the waters of the lutulent Don. Arrived at the opposite banks of the
  river, they mounted, and, guided by Luke, after half an hour's sharp riding,
  arrived at the skirts of Rookwood Park. Entering this beautiful sylvan
  domain, they rode for some time silently among the trees, till they reached
  the knoll whence Luke beheld the hall on the eventful night of his discovery
  of his mother's wedding ring. A few days only had elapsed, but during that
  brief space what storms had swept over his bosom&mdash;what ravages had they
  not made! He was then all ardor&mdash;all impetuosity&mdash;all independence.
  The future presented a bright unclouded prospect. Wealth, honors, and
  happiness apparently awaited him. It was still the same exquisite scene,
  hushed, holy, tranquil&mdash;even solemn, as upon that glorious night. The
  moon was out, silvering wood and water, and shining on the white walls of the
  tranquil mansion. Nature was calm, serene, peaceful as ever. Beneath the
  trees, he saw the bounding deer&mdash;upon the water, the misty wreaths of
  vapor&mdash;all, all was dreamy, delightful, soothing, all save his
  heart&mdash;<i>there</i> was the conflict&mdash;<i>there</i> the change. Was
  it a troubled dream, with the dark oppression of which he was struggling, or
  was it stern, waking, actual life? That moment's review of his wild career
  was terrible. He saw to what extremes his ungovernable passions had hurried
  him; he saw their inevitable consequences; he saw also his own fate; but he
  rushed madly on.</p>

  <p>He swept round the park, keeping under the covert of the wood, till he
  arrived at the avenue leading to the mansion. The stems of the aged limes
  gleamed silvery white in the moonshine. Luke drew in the rein beneath one of
  the largest of the trees.</p>

  <p>"A branch has fallen," said he, as his grandsire joined him.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" exclaimed Alan, "a branch from that tree?"</p>

  <p>"It bodes ill to Ranulph," whispered Luke, "does it not?"</p>

  <p>"Perchance," muttered Alan. "'Tis a vast bough!"</p>

  <p>"We meet within an hour," said Luke, abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Within the tomb of our ancestry," replied Alan; "I will await you
  there."</p>

  <p>And as he rode away, Alan murmured to himself the following verse from one
  of his own ballads:</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:28%">But whether gale or calm prevail, or threatening
     cloud hath fled,<br>
  By hand of Fate, predestinate, a limb that tree will shed&mdash;<br>
  A verdant bough, untouched, I trow, by axe or tempest's breath&mdash;<br>
  To Rookwood's head an omen dread of fast approaching death.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">&mdash;<i>Duchess of Malfy.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">IN one of those large antique rooms, belonging to the suite
  of apartments constituting the eastern wing of Rookwood Place&mdash;upon the
  same night as that in which the events just detailed took place, and it might
  be about the same time, sat Eleanor, and her new attendant, the gipsy
  Handassah. The eyes of the former were fixed, with a mixture of tenderness
  and pity, upon the lineaments of another lovely female countenance, bearing a
  striking resemblance to her own, though evidently, from its attire, and
  bygone costume, not intended for her, depicted upon a tablet, and placed upon
  a raised frame. It was nigh the witching hour of night. The room was sombre
  and dusky, partially dismantled of its once flowing arras, and the lights set
  upon the table feebly illumined its dreary extent. Tradition marked it out as
  the chamber in which many of the hapless dames of Rookwood had expired; and
  hence Superstition claimed it as her peculiar domain. The room was reputed to
  be haunted, and had for a long space shared the fate of haunted
  rooms&mdash;complete desertion. It was now tenanted by one too young, too
  pure, to fear aught unearthly. Eleanor seemed, nevertheless, affected by the
  profound melancholy of the picture upon which she gazed. At length, Handassah
  observed her start, and avert her eye shudderingly from the picture.</p>

  <p>"Take it hence," exclaimed Eleanor; "I have looked at that image of my
  ancestors, till it has seemed endowed with life&mdash;till its eyes have
  appeared to return my gaze, and weep. Remove it, Handassah."</p>

  <p>Handassah silently withdrew the tablet, placing it against the wall of the
  chamber.</p>

  <p>"Not there&mdash;not there," cried Eleanor; "turn it with its face to the
  wall. I cannot bear those eyes. And now come hither, girl&mdash;draw
  nearer&mdash;for I know not what of sudden dread has crossed me. This was
  <i>her</i> room, Handassah&mdash;the chamber of my ancestress&mdash;of all
  the Ladies Rookwood&mdash;where they say&mdash;&mdash;Ha! did you not hear a
  noise?&mdash;a rustle in the tapestry&mdash;a footstep near the wall? Why,
  you look as startled as I look, wench; stay by me&mdash;I will not have you
  stir from my side&mdash;'twas mere fancy."</p>

  <p>"No doubt, lady," said Handassah, with her eyes fixed upon the arras.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" exclaimed Eleanor, "there 'tis again."</p>

  <p>"'Tis nothing," replied Handassah. But her looks belied her words.</p>

  <p>"Well, I will command myself," said Eleanor, endeavoring to regain her
  calmness; "but the thoughts of the Lady Eleanor&mdash;for <i>she</i> was an
  Eleanor like to me, Handassah&mdash;and ah! even more ill-fated and
  unhappy&mdash;have brought a whole train of melancholy fancies into my mind.
  I cannot banish them: nay, though painful to me, I recur to these images of
  dread with a species of fascination, as if in their fate I contemplated mine
  own. Not one, who hath wedded a Rookwood, but hath rued it."</p>

  <p>"Yet you will wed one," said Handassah.</p>

  <p>"He is not like the rest," said Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"How know you that, lady?" asked Handassah. "His time may not yet be come.
  See what to-morrow will bring forth."</p>

  <p>"You are averse to my marriage with Ranulph, Handassah."</p>

  <p>"I was Sybil's handmaid ere I was yours, lady. I bear in mind a solemn
  compact with the dead, which this marriage will violate. You are plighted by
  oath to another, if he should demand your hand."</p>

  <p>"But he has not demanded it."</p>

  <p>"Would you accept him were he to do so?" asked Handassah, suddenly.</p>

  <p>"I meant not that," replied Eleanor. "My oath is annulled."</p>

  <p>"Say not so, lady," cried Handassah&mdash;"'twas not for this that Sybil
  spared your life. I love you, but I loved Sybil, and I would see her dying
  behests complied with."</p>

  <p>"It may not be, Handassah," replied Eleanor. "Why, from a phantom sense of
  honor, am I to sacrifice my whole existence to one who neither can love me,
  nor whom I myself could love? Am I to wed this man because, in her blind
  idolatry of him, Sybil enforced an oath upon me which I had no power to
  resist, and which was mentally cancelled while taken? Recall not the horrors
  of that dreadful cell&mdash;urge not the subject more. 'Tis in the hope that
  I may be freed for ever from this persecution that I have consented thus
  early to wed with Ranulph. This will set Luke's fancied claims at rest for
  ever."</p>

  <p>Handassah answered not, but bent her head, as if in acquiescence.</p>

  <p>Steps were now heard near the door, and a servant ushered in Dr. Small and
  Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"I am come to take leave of you for the night, my dear young lady," said
  the doctor; "but before I start for the Vicarage, I have a word or two to
  say, in addition to the advice you were so obliging as to receive from me
  this morning. Suppose you allow your attendant to retire for a few minutes.
  What I have got to say concerns yourself solely. Your mother will bear us
  company. There," continued the doctor, as Handassah was dismissed&mdash;"I am
  glad that dark-faced gipsy has taken her departure. I can't say I like her
  sharp suspicious manner, and the first exercise I should make at my powers,
  were I to be your husband, should be to discharge the handmaiden. To the
  point of my visit. We are alone, I think. This is a queer old house, Miss
  Mowbray; and this is the queerest part of it. Walls have ears, they say; and
  there are so many holes and corners in this mansion, that one ought never to
  talk secrets above one's breath."</p>

  <p>"I am yet to learn, sir," said Eleanor, "that there is any secret to be
  communicated."</p>

  <p>"Why, not much, I own," replied the doctor; "at least what has occurred is
  no secret in the house by this time. What do you think
  <i>has</i>happened?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible for me to conjecture. Nothing to Ranulph, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of consequence, I trust,&mdash;though he is part concerned with
  it."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Pray satisfy her curiosity, doctor," interposed Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"Well, then," said Small, rather more gravely, "the fact of the matter
  stands thus:&mdash;Lady Rookwood, who, as you know, was not the meekest wife
  in the world, now turns out by no means the gentlest mother, and has within
  this hour found out that she has some objection to your union with her
  son."</p>

  <p>"You alarm me, doctor."</p>

  <p>"Don't alarm yourself at all. It will be got over without difficulty, and
  only requires a little management. Ranulph is with her now, and I doubt not
  will arrange all to her satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"What was her objection?" asked Eleanor; "was it any one founded upon my
  obligation to Luke&mdash;my oath?"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut! dismiss that subject from your mind entirely," said the doctor.
  "That oath is no more binding on your conscience than would have been the
  ties of marriage had you been wedded by yon recusant Romish priest, Father
  Checkley, upon whose guilty head the Lord be merciful! Bestow not a thought
  upon it. My anxiety, together with that of your mother, is to see you now, as
  speedily as may be, wedded to Ranulph, and then that idle question is set at
  rest for ever; and therefore, even if such a thing were to occur as that Lady
  Rookwood should not yield her consent to your marriage, as that consent is
  totally unnecessary, we must go through the ceremonial without it."</p>

  <p>"The grounds of Lady Rookwood's objections&mdash;&mdash;" said Mrs.
  Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"Ay, the grounds of her ladyship's objections," interposed Small, who,
  when he had once got the lead, liked nobody to talk but himself, "are simply
  these, and exactly the sort of objections one would expect her to raise. She
  cannot bear the idea of abandoning the control of the house and estates to
  other hands. She cannot, and will not relinquish her station, as head of the
  establishment, which Ranulph has insisted upon as your right. I thought, when
  I conversed with her on this subject, that she was changed, but</p>

  <p class="cp"><small>Naturam expellas furca, tamen usque
  recurret.</small></p>

  <p>I beg your pardon. She is, and always will be, the same."</p>

  <p>"Why did not Ranulph concede the point to her? I wish not to dwell here. I
  care not for these domains&mdash;for this mansion. They have no charms for
  me. I could be happy with Ranulph anywhere&mdash;happier anywhere than
  here."</p>

  <p>The kind-hearted doctor squeezed her hand in reply, brushing a tear from
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Why did he not concede it?" said Mrs. Mowbray, proudly. "Because the
  choice remained not with him. It was not his to concede. This
  house&mdash;these lands&mdash;all&mdash;all are yours; and it were poor
  requital, indeed, if, after they have so long been wrongfully withheld from
  us, you should be a dependant on Lady Rookwood."</p>

  <p>"Without going quite so far as that, madam," said the doctor, "it is but
  justice to your daughter that she should be put in full possession of her
  rights; nor should I for one instant advise, or even allow her to inhabit the
  same house with Lady Rookwood. Her ladyship's peculiarities of temper are
  such as to preclude all possibility of happiness. At the same time, I trust
  by management&mdash;always by management, madam&mdash;that her ladyship's
  quiet departure may be ensured. I understand that all such legal arrangements
  in the way of settlements as could be entered into between your daughter and
  her future husband are completed. I have only to regret the absence of my
  friend, Mr. Coates, at this momentous conjuncture. It will be a loss to him.
  But he inherits from his father a taste for thief-taking, which he is at
  present indulging, to the manifest injury of his legitimate practice. Hark! I
  hear Ranulph's step in the gallery. He will tell us the result of his final
  interview. I came to give you advice, my dear," added the doctor in a low
  tone to Eleanor; "but I find you need it not. 'Whoso humbleth himself, shall
  be exalted.' I am glad you do not split upon the rock which has stranded half
  your generation."</p>

  <p>At this moment Ranulph Rookwood entered the room, followed by Handassah,
  who took her station at the back of the room, unperceived by the rest of the
  party, whose attention was attracted by Ranulph's agitated manner.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" asked Dr. Small and Mrs. Mowbray in the same
  breath.</p>

  <p>Ranulph hesitated for a moment in his answer, during which space he
  regarded Eleanor with the deepest anxiety, and seemed revolving within
  himself how he could frame his reply in such way as should be least painful
  to her feelings; while, with instinctive apprehension of coming misfortune,
  Miss Mowbray eagerly seconded the inquiries of her friends.</p>

  <p>"It is with great pain," said he, at length, in a tone of despondency, not
  unmingled with displeasure, "that I am obliged to descant upon the
  infirmities of a parent, and to censure her conduct as severely as I may do
  now. I feel the impropriety of such a step, and I would willingly avoid it,
  could I do so in justice to my own feelings&mdash;and especially at a moment
  like the present&mdash;when every hope of my life is fixed upon uniting
  myself to you, dear Eleanor, by ties as near as my own to that parent. But
  the interview which I have just had with Lady Rookwood&mdash;bitter and
  heart-breaking as it has been&mdash;compels me to reprobate her conduct in
  the strongest terms, as harsh, unjust, and dishonorable; and if I could
  wholly throw off the son, as she avows she has thrown off the mother, I
  should unhesitatingly pronounce it as little short of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Dear Ranulph," said Eleanor, palpitating with apprehension, "I never saw
  you so much moved."</p>

  <p>"Nor with so much reason," rejoined Ranulph. "For myself, I could endure
  anything&mdash;but for <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And does your dispute relate to <i>me</i>?" asked Eleanor. "Is it for
  <i>my</i> sake you have braved your mother's displeasure? Is it because Lady
  Rookwood is unwilling to resign the control of this house and these lands to
  <i>me</i>, that you have parted in anger with her? Was this the cause of your
  quarrel?"</p>

  <p>"It was the origin of it," replied Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Mother," said Eleanor, firmly, to Mrs. Mowbray, "go with me to Lady
  Rookwood's chamber."</p>

  <p>"Wherefore?" demanded Mrs. Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"Question me not, dear mother, or let me go alone."</p>

  <p>"Daughter, I guess your meaning," said Mrs. Mowbray, sternly. "You would
  relinquish your claims in favor of Lady Rookwood. Is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Since you oblige me to answer you, mother," said Eleanor, crimsoning, "I
  must admit that you have guessed my meaning. To Lady Rookwood, as to
  yourself, I would be a daughter as far as is consistent with my duty," added
  she, blushing still more deeply, "but my first consideration shall be my
  husband. And if Lady Rookwood can be content&mdash;&mdash;But pray question
  me not further&mdash;accompany me to her chamber."</p>

  <p>"Eleanor," interposed Ranulph, "dearest Eleanor, the sacrifice you would
  make is unnecessary&mdash;uncalled for. You do not know my mother. She would
  not, I grieve to say, appreciate the generosity of your motives. She would
  not give you credit for your feelings. She would only resent your visit as an
  intrusion."</p>

  <p>"My daughter comprehends you, sir," said Mrs. Mowbray, haughtily. "I will
  take care that, in her own house, Miss Mowbray shall remain free from
  insult."</p>

  <p>"Mother, dear mother," said Eleanor, "do not wilfully misunderstand
  him."</p>

  <p>"You can be little aware, madam," said Ranulph, calmly, yet sadly, "how
  much I have recently endured&mdash;how much of parental anger&mdash;how much
  of parental malediction I have incurred, to save you and your daughter from
  the indignity you apprehend. As I before said, you do not know my mother; nor
  could it enter into any well-regulated imagination to conceive the
  extremities to which the violence of her passion will, when her schemes are
  thwarted, hurry her. The terms upon which you met together will not escape
  your recollection; nor shall I need to recall to your mind her haughtiness,
  her coldness. That coldness has since ripened into distrust; and the match
  which she was at first all anxiety to promote, she would now utterly set
  aside, were it in her power to do so. Whence this alteration in her views has
  arisen, I have no means of ascertaining; it is not my mother's custom to give
  a reason for her actions, or her wishes: it is all-sufficient to express
  them. I have perceived, as the time has drawn nigh for the fulfilment of my
  dearest hopes, that her unwillingness has increased; until to-day, what had
  hitherto been confined to hints, has been openly expressed, and absolute
  objections raised. Such, however, is the peculiarity of her temper, that I
  trusted, even at the eleventh hour, I should be able to work a change. Alas!
  our last meeting was decisive. She commanded me to break off the match. At
  once, and peremptorily, I refused. Pardon me, madam, pardon me, dearest
  Eleanor, if I thus enter into particulars; it is absolutely necessary I
  should be explicit. Enraged at my opposition to her wishes, her fury became
  ungovernable. With appalling imprecations upon the memory of my poor father,
  and upon <i>your</i> father, madam, whose chief offence in her eyes was, it
  seems, the disposition of his property to Eleanor, she bade me be gone, and
  take her curses as my wedding portion. Beneath this roof&mdash;beneath
  <i>her</i>roof, she added&mdash;no marriage of mine should e'er take place. I
  might go hence, or might stay, as I thought fitting; but you and your
  daughter, whom she characterized as intruders, should not remain another hour
  within her house. To this wild raving I answered, with as much composure as I
  could command, that she entirely mistook her own position, and that, so far
  from the odium of intrusion resting with you, if applicable to any one, the
  term must necessarily affix itself on those who, through ignorance, had for
  years unjustly deprived the rightful owners of this place of their
  inheritance. Upon this her wrath was boundless. She disowned me as her son;
  disclaimed all maternal regard, and heaped upon my head a frightful
  malediction, at the recollection of which I still tremble. I will spare you
  further details of this dreadful scene. To me it is most distressing; for,
  however firmly resolved I may be to pursue a line of conduct which every
  sound principle within me dictates as the correct one, yet I cannot be
  insensible to the awful responsibility I shall incur in bringing down a
  mother's curse upon my head, nor to the jeopardy in which her own excessive
  violence may place her."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Mowbray listened to Ranulph's explanation in haughty displeasure;
  Eleanor with throbbing, tearful interest; Dr. Small, with mixed feelings of
  anger and astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Lady Rookwood's conduct," said the doctor, "is&mdash;you must forgive me,
  my dear Sir Ranulph, for using strong expressions&mdash;outrageous beyond all
  precedent, and only excusable on the ground of insanity, to which I wish it
  were possible we could attribute it. There is, however, too much method in
  her madness to allow us to indulge any such notion; she is shrewd, dangerous,
  and designing; and, since she has resolved to oppose this match, she will
  leave no means untried to do so. I scarcely know how to advise you under the
  circumstances&mdash;that is, if my advice were asked."</p>

  <p>"Which I scarcely think it likely to be, sir," said Mrs. Mowbray, coldly.
  "After what has occurred, <i>I</i> shall think it my duty to break off this
  alliance, which I have never considered to be so desirable that its rupture
  will occasion me an instant's uneasiness."</p>

  <p>"A plague on all these Rookwoods!" muttered Small. "One would think all
  the pride of the Prince of Darkness were centered in their bosoms. But,
  madam," continued the benevolent doctor, "have you no consideration for the
  feelings of your daughter, or for those of one who is no distant relation to
  you&mdash;your nephew? Your son, Major Mowbray, is, if I mistake not, most
  eager for this union to take place between his sister and his friend."</p>

  <p>"My children have been accustomed to yield implicit obedience to my
  wishes," said Mrs. Mowbray, "and Major Mowbray, I am sure, will see the
  propriety of the step I am about to take. I am content, at least, to abide by
  <i>his</i> opinion."</p>

  <p>"Snubbed again!" mentally ejaculated the doctor, with a shrug of despair.
  "It is useless attempting to work upon such impracticable material."</p>

  <p>Ranulph remained mute, in an attitude of profound melancholy. An eloquent
  interchange of glances had passed between him and Eleanor, communicating to
  each the anxious state of the other's feelings.</p>

  <p>At this crisis the door was suddenly opened, and old Agnes, Lady
  Rookwood's aged attendant, rushed into the room, and sank upon her knees on
  the floor, her limbs shaking, her teeth chattering, and every feature
  expressive of intense terror. Ranulph went instantly towards her to demand
  the cause of her alarm.</p>

  <p>"No, let me pray," cried Agnes, as he took her hand in the attempt to
  raise her; "let me pray while there is yet time&mdash;let the worthy doctor
  pray beside me. Pray for an overladen soul, sir; pray heartily, as you would
  hope for mercy yourself. Ah! little know the righteous of the terrors of
  those that are beyond the pale of mercy. The Lord pardon me my iniquities,
  and absolve <i>her</i>."</p>

  <p>"Whom do you mean?" asked Ranulph, in agitation. "You do not allude to my
  mother?"</p>

  <p>"You have no longer a mother, young man," said Agnes, solemnly.</p>

  <p>"What!" exclaimed Ranulph, terror-stricken; "is she dead?"</p>

  <p>"She is gone."</p>

  <p>"Gone! How? Whither?" exclaimed all, their amazement increasing each
  instant at the terror of the old woman, and the apparently terrible occasion
  of it.</p>

  <p>"Speak!" exclaimed Ranulph; "but why do I loiter? my mother, perchance, is
  dying&mdash;let me go."</p>

  <p>The old woman maintained her clutching grasp, which was strong and
  convulsive as that of one struggling betwixt life and death. "It's of no use,
  I tell you; it's all over," said she&mdash;"the dead are come&mdash;the dead
  are come&mdash;and she is gone."</p>

  <p>"Whither?&mdash;whither?"</p>

  <p>"To the grave&mdash;to the tomb," said Agnes, in a deep and hollow tone,
  and with a look that froze Ranulph's soul. "Listen to me, Ranulph Rookwood,
  my child, my nursling&mdash;listen while I <i>can</i> speak. We were alone,
  your mother and I, after that scene between you; after the dark denunciations
  she had heaped upon the dead, when I heard a low and gasping kind of sob, and
  there I saw your mother staring wildly upon the vacancy, as if she saw that
  of which I dare not think."</p>

  <p>"What think you she beheld?" asked Ranulph, quaking with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"That which had been your father," returned Agnes, in a hollow tone.
  "Don't doubt me, sir&mdash;you'll find the truth of what I say anon. I am
  sure he was there. There was a thrilling, speechless horror in the very sight
  of her countenance that froze my old blood to ice&mdash;to the ice in which
  'tis now&mdash;ough! ough! Well, at length she arose, with her eyes still
  fixed, and passed through the paneled door without a word. She is gone!"</p>

  <p>"What madness is this?" cried Ranulph. "Let me go, woman&mdash;'tis that
  ruffian in disguise&mdash;she may be murdered."</p>

  <p>"No, no," shrieked Agnes; "it was no disguise. She is gone, I tell
  you&mdash;the room was empty, all the rooms were empty&mdash;the passage was
  void&mdash;through the door they went together&mdash;silently,
  silently&mdash;ghostlike, slow. Ha! that tomb&mdash;they are there together
  now&mdash;he has her in his arms&mdash;see, they are here&mdash;they glide
  through the door&mdash;do you not see them now? Did I not speak the truth?
  She is dead&mdash;ha, ha!" And with a frantic and bewildering laugh the old
  woman fell upon her face.</p>

  <p>Ranulph raised her from the floor; but the shock of what she had beheld
  had been too much for her. She was dead!</p>

  <p class="first">RANULPH ROOKWOOD was for some moments so much stunned by the
  ghastly fate of Agnes, connected, as it appeared to be, with a supernatural
  summons similar to that which he imagined he had himself received, that he
  was incapable of stirring from the spot, or removing his gaze from the rigid
  features of the corpse, which, even in death, wore the strong impress of
  horror and despair. Through life he knew that Agnes, his own nurse, had been
  his mother's constant and faithful attendant; the unhesitating agent of her
  schemes, and it was to be feared, from the remorse she had exhibited, the
  participator of her crimes; and Ranulph felt, he knew not why, that in having
  witnessed her terrible end, he beheld the ultimate condition of his own
  parent. Conquering, not without great effort, the horror which had riveted
  him to the spot, he turned to look towards Eleanor. She had sunk upon a
  chair, a silent witness of the scene, Mrs. Mowbray and Dr. Small having, upon
  the first alarm given by Agnes respecting Lady Rookwood's departure from the
  house quitted the room to ascertain the truth of her statement. Ranulph
  immediately flew to Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Ranulph," said she, though almost overcome by her alarm, "stay not an
  instant here with me. I am sure, from that poor woman's dreadful death, that
  something terrible has occurred, perhaps to Lady Rookwood. Go to her chamber.
  Tarry not, I entreat of you."</p>

  <p>"But will you, can you remain here alone with that body?" asked
  Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"I shall not be alone. Handassah is within call&mdash;nay, she is here.
  Oh, what an eve of our espousals has this been, dear Ranulph. Our whole life
  is a troubled volume, of which each successive leaf grows darker. Fate is
  opposed to us. It is useless to contend with our destiny. I fear we shall
  never be united."</p>

  <p>"Dismiss me not with words like those, dear Eleanor," returned Ranulph.
  "Fate cannot have greater woes in store for us than those by which we are now
  opposed. Let us hope that we are now at that point whence all must brighten.
  Once possessed of you, assured of thus much happiness, I would set even fate
  at defiance. And you will be mine to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph, dear Ranulph, your suit at this moment is desperate. I dare not,
  cannot pledge myself. You yourself heard, even now, my mother's sentiments,
  and I cannot marry without her consent."</p>

  <p>"Your mother, like my own, regards not the feelings of her children.
  Forgive my boldness, Eleanor; forgive me if I linger now, when duty calls me
  hence; but I cannot tear myself away. Your mother may return&mdash;my hopes
  be crushed; for even your love for me seems annihilated in her presence."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph, your vehemence terrifies me," rejoined Eleanor. "I implore you,
  by the tender affection which you know I bear you, not to urge me further at
  this moment. Recall your firmer feelings, and obtain some mastery over
  yourself. I repeat, I am yours only, if I am bride of any one. But when our
  union can take place rests not with myself. And now, I entreat of you, leave
  me."</p>

  <p>"You are mine," said Ranulph, with fervor; "mine only."</p>

  <p>"Yours only," replied Eleanor.</p>

  <p>"Be this the earnest of my happiness!" exclaimed Ranulph, imprinting a
  long and impassioned kiss upon her lips.</p>

  <p>The lovers were startled from their embrace by a profound sigh; it
  proceeded from Handassah, who, unbidden, had replaced the picture of the Lady
  Eleanor upon its frame. The augury seemed sinister. Every one who has gazed
  steadfastly upon a portrait must have noticed the peculiar and lifelike
  character which, under certain aspects, the eyes will assume. Seen by the
  imperfect light upon the table, the whole character of the countenance of the
  Lady Eleanor seemed changed; the features appeared to be stamped with
  melancholy, and the eyes to be fixed with pitying tenderness upon her
  descendants. Both gazed at each other and at the picture, struck with the
  same sentiment of undefined awe. Beside them stood the dark figure of the
  gipsy girl, watching, with ill-concealed satisfaction, the effect of her
  handiwork. Ranulph was aroused from his abstraction by hearing a loud outcry
  in Mrs. Mowbray's voice. Hastily committing Eleanor to the care of her
  attendant, he left the room. Handassah followed him to the door, closed it
  after him, and then locked it within side. This done, she walked back hastily
  towards Eleanor, exclaiming, in a tone of exultation, "You have parted with
  him forever."</p>

  <p>"What mean you, girl?" cried Eleanor, alarmed at her manner. "Why have you
  fastened the door? Open it, I command you."</p>

  <p>"Command <i>me</i>!" laughed Handassah, scornfully. "What if I refuse your
  mandate? What, if, in my turn, I bid <i>you</i> obey <i>me</i>? I never owned
  but one mistress. If I have bowed my neck to you for a time, 'twas to fulfil
  her dying wishes. If I have submitted to your control, it was to accomplish
  what I have now accomplished. Your oath! Remember your oath. The hour is come
  for its fulfilment."</p>

  <p>With these words Handassah clapped her hands. A panel in the wall opened,
  and Luke stood suddenly before them. Silently and with stern deliberation he
  strode towards Eleanor, and seizing one of her hands, drew her forcibly
  towards him. Eleanor resisted not; she had not the power; neither did she
  scream, for so paralyzing was her terror, that for the moment it took away
  all power of utterance. Luke neither stirred nor spoke, but, still
  maintaining his hold, gazed searchingly upon her features, while Eleanor, as
  if spell-bound, could not withdraw her eyes from him. Nothing more terribly
  impressive could be conceived than Luke's whole appearance. Harassed and
  exhausted by the life he had recently led; deprived almost of natural rest;
  goaded by remorse, his frame was almost worn to the bone, while his
  countenance, once dark and swarthy, was now blanched and colorless as marble.
  This pallid and deathlike hue was, in all probability, owing to the loss of
  blood he had sustained from the wound inflicted by Major Mowbray, with the
  stains of which his apparel was dyed; for, though staunched, the effusion had
  been sufficient to cause great faintness. His dark eyes blazed with their
  wonted fire&mdash;nay, they looked darker and larger from his exceeding
  paleness, and such intense mental and bodily suffering was imprinted upon his
  countenance, that, despite its fierceness and desperation, few could have
  regarded him without sympathy. Real desperation has so much of agony in its
  character, that no one can witness it unmoved. His garb was not that in which
  the reader first beheld him, but a rich, dark, simple suit of velvet,
  corresponding more with his real rank in life than his former peasant's
  attire; but it was disordered by his recent conflict, and stained with bloody
  testimonials of the fray; while his long, sable curls, once his pride and
  ornament, now hung in intertangled elf-locks, like a coil of wreathed
  water-snakes. Even in her terror, as she dwelt upon his noble features,
  Eleanor could not help admitting that she beheld the undoubted descendant,
  and the living likeness of the handsomest and most distinguished of her
  house&mdash;the profligate and criminal Sir Reginald. As her eye,
  mechanically following this train of thought, wandered for an instant to the
  haughty portraiture of Sir Reginald, which formed part of the family
  pictures, and thence to those of his unfortunate lady, she was struck with
  the fancy that, by some terrible fatality, the tragic horrors of bygone days
  were to be again enacted in their persons, and that they were in some way
  strangely identified with their unfortunate progenitors. So forcibly was this
  idea impressed upon her features that Luke, who had followed the direction of
  her glances, became instantly aware of it. Drawing her nearer to the portrait
  of the Lady Eleanor, he traced the resemblance in mute wonder; thence,
  turning towards that of Sir Reginald, he proudly exclaimed: "You doubted once
  my lineage, maiden&mdash;can you gaze on those features, which would almost
  seem to be a reflection of mine own, and longer hesitate whose descendant I
  am? I glory in my likeness. There is a wild delight in setting human emotions
  at naught, which he was said to feel&mdash;which I feel now. Within these
  halls I seem to breathe an atmosphere congenial to me. I visit what I oft
  have visited in my dreams; or as in a state of pre-existence. Methinks, as I
  gaze on you, I could almost deem myself Sir Reginald, and you his bride, the
  Lady Eleanor. Our fates were parallel: <i>she</i> was united to her lord by
  ties of hatred&mdash;by a <i>vow</i>&mdash;<i>a bridal vow</i>! So are you to
  me. And she could ne'er escape him&mdash;could ne'er throw off her
  bondage&mdash;nor shall you. I claim the fulfilment of <i>your</i> oath; you
  are <i>mine</i>."</p>

  <p>"Never, never!" shrieked Eleanor, struggling to disengage herself. But
  Luke laughed at her feeble efforts. Handassah stood by, a passive spectatress
  of the scene, with her arms folded upon her bosom.</p>

  <p>"You refuse compliance," said Luke, scornfully. "Have you no hopes of
  Heaven, no fears of perdition, that you dare to violate your vow? Bethink you
  of the awful nature of that obligation; of the life that was laid down to
  purchase it; of the blood which will cry out for vengeance 'gainst the
  <i>murderess</i>, should you hesitate. By that blood-cemented sacrament, I
  claim you as my own. You are mine." And he dragged her towards the
  opening.</p>

  <p>Eleanor uttered a long and terrific scream.</p>

  <p>"Be silent, on your life," added he, searching for the dagger given to him
  by Alan Rookwood, when, as his hand sought the weapon, Eleanor escaped from
  his grasp, and fled towards the door. But Handassah had anticipated her
  intention. The key was withdrawn from the lock, and the wretched maiden
  vainly tried to open it.</p>

  <p>At this instant Turpin appeared at the sliding panel.</p>

  <p>"Quick, quick!" cried he, impatiently&mdash;"despatch, in the devil's
  name. The house is alarmed. I hear young Ranulph's voice in the gallery."</p>

  <p>"Ranulph!" shrieked Eleanor&mdash;"then I am saved," and she redoubled her
  outcries for assistance.</p>

  <p>Luke again seized his victim. Her hands clutched so convulsively fast in
  her despairing energy against the handle of the door that he could not tear
  her thence. By this time Ranulph Rookwood, who had caught her reiterated
  screams for help, was at the entrance. He heard her struggles; he heard
  Luke's threats&mdash;his mockery&mdash;his derisive laughter&mdash;but
  vainly, vainly did he attempt to force it open. It was of the strongest oak,
  and the bolts resisted all his efforts. A board alone divided him from his
  mistress. He could hear her sobs and gasps. He saw, from the action of the
  handle, with what tenacity she clung to it; and, stung to frenzy by the
  sight, he hurled himself against the sturdy plank, but all in vain. At length
  the handle was still. There was a heavy fall upon the floor&mdash;a stifled
  scream&mdash;and a sound as of a body being dragged along. The thought was
  madness.</p>

  <p>"To the panel! to the panel!" cried a voice&mdash;it was that of
  Turpin&mdash;from within.</p>

  <p>"The panel!&mdash;ha!" echoed Ranulph, with a sudden gleam of hope. "I may
  yet save her." And he darted along the corridor with the swiftness of
  thought.</p>

  <p>Luke, meanwhile, had for some minutes fruitlessly exhausted all his force
  to drag Eleanor from the door. Despair gave her strength; she clutched at the
  door; but she felt her strength failing her&mdash;her grasp was relaxing. And
  then the maddening thought that she would be shortly his&mdash;that he would
  slay her&mdash;while the idea that Ranulph was so near, and yet unable to
  protect her, added gall even to her bitterness. With savage delight Luke
  exulted in the lovers' tortures. He heard Ranulph's ineffectual attempts; he
  heard his groans; he heard their mutual cries. Inflamed by jealousy, he
  triumphed in his power of vengeance, and even prolonged the torture which
  accident had given him the means of inflicting. He stood like the inquisitor
  who marks his victim's anguish on the rack, and calculates his powers of
  further endurance. But he could no longer dally, even with this horrible
  gratification. His companion grew impatient. Eleanor's fair long tresses had
  escaped from their confinement in the struggle, and fell down her neck in
  disorder. Twining his fingers amidst its folds, Luke dragged her backwards
  from her hold, and, incapable of further resistance, her strength completely
  exhausted, the wretched girl fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>Luke now raised her almost inanimate form in his arms, and had nigh
  reached the aperture, when a crash was heard in the panel opposite to that by
  which he was about to escape, and communicating with a further apartment. It
  was thrown open, and Ranulph Rookwood presented himself at the narrow
  partition. An exclamation of joy, that he was yet in time, escaped his lips;
  and he was about to clear the partition at a bound, and to precipitate
  himself upon Luke, when, as suddenly as his own action, was the person of the
  unfortunate Mr. Coates wedged into the aperture.</p>

  <p>"Traitor!" cried Ranulph, regarding Coates with concentrated fury, "dare
  you to oppose me?&mdash;hence! or, by Heaven, I will cut you down!"</p>

  <p>"'Tis impossible," ejaculated the attorney. "For your own sake, Sir
  Ranulph&mdash;for my sake&mdash;I entreat&mdash;implore of you&mdash;not to
  attempt to pass this way. Try the other door."</p>

  <p>Ranulph said no more. He passed his sword through the body of the
  miserable attorney, who, with a deep groan, fell. The only obstacle to his
  passage being thus removed, he at once leaped into the room.</p>

  <p>The brothers were now confronted, together, but little of brotherly love
  mingled with the glances which they threw upon each other. Ranulph's gentle,
  but withal enthusiastic temperament, had kindled, under his present
  excitement, like flax at the sudden approach of flame. He was wild with
  frenzy. Luke was calmer, but his fury was deadly and inextinguishable. The
  meeting was terrible on both sides.</p>

  <p>With one arm Luke enfolded Eleanor, with the other he uplifted the dagger.
  Its point was towards her bosom. Scowling grim defiance at Ranulph, he
  exclaimed, in a determined tone, "Advance a footstep, and my dagger descends
  into her heart."</p>

  <p>Ranulph hesitated, uncertain how to act; foaming with rage, yet trembling
  with apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Ranulph," gasped Eleanor, "life without you were valueless.
  Advance&mdash;avenge me!"</p>

  <p>Ranulph still hesitated. He could not, by any act of his own, compromise
  Eleanor's safety.</p>

  <p>Luke saw his advantage, and was not slow to profit by it. "You seal her
  destruction if you stir," said he.</p>

  <p>"Villain," returned Ranulph, between his ground teeth, and with difficulty
  commanding sufficient coolness to speak with deliberation, "you perceive your
  power. Injure her, and nothing earthly shall protect you. Free her, and take
  your life and liberty; nay, reward if you will. You cannot otherwise escape
  me."</p>

  <p>"Escape you!" laughed Luke, disdainfully. "Stand aside, and let me pass.
  Beware," added he, sternly, "how you oppose me. I would not have a brother's
  blood upon my soul."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," cried Ranulph; "but you pass not." And he placed himself full in
  Luke's path.</p>

  <p>Luke, however, steadily moved forward, holding Eleanor between himself and
  Ranulph, so as to shield his own person; but, fancying he saw an opportunity
  of dealing a blow without injury to his mistress, the latter was about to
  hazard the thrust, when his arms were seized behind, and he was rendered
  powerless.</p>

  <p>"Lost, lost," groaned he; "she is lost to me forever!"</p>

  <p>"I fear that's but too true," said Turpin, for it was the highwayman whose
  grasp confined Ranulph.</p>

  <p>"Must I see her borne away before my eyes?" cried Ranulph. "Release
  me&mdash;set me free!"</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible at present," returned Dick. "Mount and away, Sir Luke,"
  continued he; "never mind me. Leave me to shift for myself."</p>

  <p>"Eleanor!" cried Ranulph, as she passed close by his side.</p>

  <p>"Ranulph!" shrieked Eleanor, with a loud scream, recalled to consciousness
  by his voice, "farewell for ever."</p>

  <p>"Ay, for ever," responded Luke, triumphantly. "You meet no more on
  earth."</p>

  <p>He was about to pass through the panel, when Eleanor exerted all her
  remaining strength in a last futile attempt at liberation. In the struggle, a
  packet fell from Luke's bosom.</p>

  <p>Handassah stooped to pick it up.</p>

  <p>"From Sybil!" exclaimed she, glancing at the superscription.</p>

  <p>"Remember my promise to old Barbara," roared Dick, who had some curiosity,
  as the reader knows, to learn what the package contained. "The time is
  arrived. Eleanor is in your power&mdash;in your presence."</p>

  <p>"Give me the packet," said Luke, resigning Eleanor for the instant to
  Handassah's custody&mdash;"take the steel, and grasp her firmly."</p>

  <p>Handassah, who, though slight of figure, was of singular personal
  strength, twined her arms about Miss Mowbray in such a manner as to preclude
  all possibility of motion.</p>

  <p>Luke tore open the package. It was a box carefully enclosed in several
  folds of linen, and lastly within a sheet of paper, on which were inscribed
  these words:</p>

  <p class="smcap"
     style="text-align:center">The Dower of Sybil</p>

  <p>Hastily, and with much curiosity, Luke raised the lid of the box. It
  contained one long silken tress of blackest hair enviously braided. It was
  Sybil's. His first impulse was to cast it from him; his next, reproachfully
  to raise it to his lips. He started as if a snake had stung him.</p>

  <p>At this moment a loud clamor was heard in the gallery. In the next, the
  door was assailed by violent strokes, evidently proceeding from some weighty
  instrument, impelled by the united strength of several assailants.</p>

  <p>The voice of Turpin rose above the deafening din. "A bullet for the first
  who enters," shouted he. "Quick, Sir Luke, and the prize is safe&mdash;away,
  and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But as he seconded his exhortation with a glance at Luke, he broke off the
  half-uttered sentence, and started with horror and amazement. Ere the cause
  of his alarm could be expressed, the door was burst open, and a crowd of
  domestics, headed by Major Mowbray and Titus Tyrconnel, rushed into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Nay, then, the game's up!" exclaimed Dick; "I have done with Rookwood."
  And, springing through the panel, he was seen no more.</p>

  <p>When the newcomers first looked round, they could perceive only two
  figures besides themselves&mdash;those of the two lovers&mdash;Eleanor having
  sunk pale, exhausted, and almost senseless, into the arms of Ranulph.
  Presently, however, a ghastly object attracted their attention. All rushed
  towards it&mdash;all recoiled, as soon as they discovered that it was the
  lifeless body of Luke Rookwood. His limbs were stiff, like those of a corpse
  which has for hours been such; his eyes protruded from their sockets; his
  face was livid and blotched. All bespoke, with terrible certainty, the
  efficacy of the poison, and the full accomplishment of Barbara's revenge.</p>

  <p>Handassah was gone. Probably she had escaped ere Turpin fled. At all
  events, she was heard of no more at Rookwood.</p>

  <p>It required little to recall the senses of Eleanor. Shortly she revived,
  and as she gazed around, and became conscious of her escape, she uttered
  exclamations of thanksgiving, and sank into the embraces of her brother.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Mowbray and Dr. Small had joined the assemblage.</p>

  <p>The worthy doctor had been full of alarm; but his meditated condolences
  were now changed to congratulations, as he heard the particulars of the
  terrible scene that had occurred, and of Eleanor's singular and almost
  providential deliverance.</p>

  <p>"After what has befallen, madam," said the doctor to Mrs. Mowbray,
  slightly coughing, "you can no longer raise any objection to a certain union,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"I will answer for my mother in that particular," said Major Mowbray,
  stepping forward.</p>

  <p>"She will answer for herself, my son," said Mrs. Mowbray. "The match has
  her full and entire consent. But to what am I to attribute the unexpected
  happiness of your return?"</p>

  <p>"To a chain of singular circumstances," replied the Major, "which I will
  hereafter detail to you. Suffice it to say, that but for this gentleman's
  fortunate arrival," added he, looking at Titus Tyrconnel, "at the hut on
  Thorne Waste, I might have been detained a prisoner, without <i>parole</i>,
  and, what is worse, without provision perhaps for days; and to add to my
  distress, fully acquainted with the meditated abduction of my sister. It was
  excessively lucky for me, Mr. Tyrconnel, that you happened to pass that way,
  and for poor Paterson likewise."</p>

  <p>"Arrah, by my sowl, major, and you may say that with safety; and it was
  particularly fortunate that we stumbled upon the tits in the cellar, or we'd
  never have been here just in the nick of it. I begin to think we've lost all
  chance of taking Dick Turpin this time. He's got clean away."</p>

  <p>"I am not sorry for his escape," said the major. "He's a brave fellow; and
  I respect courage wherever I find it, even in a highwayman. I should be sorry
  to appear as a witness against him; and I trust it will never be my fate to
  do so."</p>

  <p>We shall not pause to describe the affectionate meeting which now ensued
  between the brother and sister&mdash;the congratulations upon Eleanor's
  escape from peril, intermingled with the tenderest embraces, and the warmest
  thanks offered to Ranulph for his gallant service. "She is yours, my dear
  boy," said the major; "and though you are a Rookwood, and she bears the
  ill-fated name of Eleanor, I predict that, contrary to the usual custom of
  our families in such cases, all your misfortunes will have occurred
  <i>before</i> marriage."</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing," said Small, with a very peculiar expression,
  which might almost be construed into serio-comic, could we suspect the
  benevolent doctor of any such waggery, "that can possibly throw a shade over
  our present felicity. Lady Rookwood is not to be found."</p>

  <p>"My poor mother," said Ranulph, starting.</p>

  <p>"Make yourself easy," said the doctor; "I doubt not we shall hear of her
  to-morrow. My only apprehension," added he, half aside, "is, that she may be
  heard of before."</p>

  <p>"One other circumstance afflicts me," said Ranulph. "Poor Mr. Coates!"</p>

  <p>"What's that you say of Mr. Coates, Sir Ranulph?" exclaimed Titus.</p>

  <p>"I fear he was killed in the recent affray," said Ranulph. "Let some one
  search for the body."</p>

  <p>"Kilt!" echoed Titus. "Is it kilt that Mr. Coates is? Ah! <i>ullagone</i>,
  and is it over with him entirely? Is he gone to rejoin his father, the
  thief-taker? Bring me to his remains."</p>

  <p>"He will bring them to you himself," said the attorney, stepping forward.
  "Luckily, Sir Ranulph," said the incurable punster, "it was merely the
  <i>outer coats</i> that your sword passed through; the <i>inner</i> remains
  uninjured, so that you did not act as my <i>conveyancer</i> to eternity. Body
  o' me! I've as many lives as a cat&mdash;ha, ha!"</p>

  <p>Ranulph welcomed the facetious man of law with no little satisfaction.</p>

  <p>We think it unnecessary to enter into further detail. Another chamber was
  prepared for Eleanor's reception, to which she was almost immediately
  transported. The remains of the once fierce and haughty Luke, now stiff and
  stark, but still wearing, even in death, their proud character, were placed
  upon the self-same bier, and covered with the self-same pall which, but a
  week ago, had furnished forth his father's funeral. And as the domestics
  crowded round the corpse, there was not one of them but commented upon his
  startling resemblance to his grandsire, Sir Reginald; nor, amongst the
  superstitious, was the falling of the fatal bough forgotten.</p>

  <p>Tranquillity was at length restored at the hall. Throughout the night and
  during the next day, Ranulph made every search for his mother, but no tidings
  could be learned of her. Seriously alarmed, he then caused more strict and
  general inquiry to be instituted, but with like unsuccessful effect. It was
  not, indeed, till some years afterwards that her fate was ascertained.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5-5"
     name="ch5-5"></a>CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE SARCOPHAGUS</h2>

  <p class="quote"
     style="text-align:center">So now 'tis ended, like an old wife's story.
     &mdash;<span class="smcap">Webster</span>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">NOTWITHSTANDING the obscurity which hung over the fate of
  Lady Rookwood, the celebration of the nuptials of Sir Ranulph and Eleanor was
  not long delayed; the ceremony took place at the parish church, and the
  worthy vicar officiated upon the occasion. It was a joyous sight to all who
  witnessed it, and not few were they who did so, for the whole neighborhood
  was bidden to the festival. The old avenue was thronged with bright and
  beaming faces, rustic maidens decked out in ribbons of many-colored splendor,
  and stout youths in their best holiday trim; nor was the lusty yeoman and his
  buxom spouse&mdash;nor yet the patriarch of the village, nor prattling child,
  wanting. Even the ancestral rooks seemed to participate in the universal
  merriment, and returned, from their eyries, a hoarse greeting, like a lusty
  chorus of laughter, to the frolic train. The churchyard path was strewn with
  flowers&mdash;the church itself a complete garland. Never was there seen a
  blither wedding: the sun smiled upon the bride&mdash;accounted a fortunate
  omen, as dark lowering skies and stormy weather had, within the memory of the
  oldest of the tenantry, inauspiciously ushered in all former espousals. The
  bride had recovered her bloom and beauty, while the melancholy which had
  seemingly settled for ever upon the open brow of the bridegroom, had now
  given place to a pensive shade that only added interest to his expressive
  features; and, as in simple state, after the completion of the sacred rites,
  the youthful pair walked, arm in arm, amongst their thronging and admiring
  tenants towards the Hall, many a fervent prayer was breathed that the curse
  of the house of Rookwood might be averted from their heads; and, not to leave
  a doubt upon the subject, we can add that these aspirations were not in vain,
  but that the day, which dawned so brightly, was one of serene and unclouded
  happiness to its close.</p>

  <p>After the ceremonial, the day was devoted to festivity. Crowded with
  company, from the ample hall to the kitchen ingle, the old mansion could
  scarce contain its numerous guests, while the walls resounded with hearty
  peals of laughter, to which they had been long unaccustomed. The tables
  groaned beneath the lordly baron of beef, the weighty chine, the castled
  pasty flanked on the one hand with neat's tongue, and on the other defended
  by a mountainous ham, an excellent <i>pièce de résistance</i>, and every
  other substantial appliance of ancient hospitality. Barrels of mighty ale
  were broached, and their nut-brown contents widely distributed, and the
  health of the bride and bridegroom was enthusiastically drunk in a brimming
  wassail cup of spicy wine with floating toast. Titus Tyrconnel acted as
  master of the ceremonies, and was, Mr. Coates declared, "<i>quite in his
  element</i>." So much was he elated, that he ventured to cut some of his old
  jokes upon the vicar, and, strange to say, without incurring the resentment
  of Small.</p>

  <p>To retrace the darker course of our narrative, we must state that some
  weeks before this happy event the remains of the unfortunate Sir Luke
  Rookwood had been gathered to those of his fathers. The document that
  attested his legitimacy being found upon his person, the claims denied to him
  in life were conceded in death; and he was interred, with all the pomp and
  peculiar solemnity proper to one of the house, within the tomb of his
  ancestry.</p>

  <p>It was then that a discovery was made respecting Alan Rookwood, in order
  to explain which we must again revert to the night of the meditated
  <i>enlèvement</i> of Eleanor.</p>

  <p>After quitting his grandson in the avenue, Alan shaped his course among
  the fields in the direction to the church. He sought his own humble, but now
  deserted dwelling. The door had been forced; some of its meagre furniture was
  removed; and the dog, his sole companion, had fled. "Poor Mole!" said he,
  "thou hast found, I trust, a better master." And having possessed himself of
  what he came in search&mdash;namely, a bunch of keys and his lantern,
  deposited in an out-of-the-way cupboard, that had escaped notice, he quickly
  departed.</p>

  <p>He was once more within the churchyard; once more upon that awful stage
  whereon he had chosen to enact, for a long season, his late fantastical
  character; and he gazed upon the church tower, glistening in the moonshine,
  the green and undulating hillocks, the "chequered cross-sticks," the
  clustered headstones, and the black and portentous yew-trees, as upon "old
  familiar faces." He mused, for a few moments, upon the scene, apparently with
  deep interest. He then walked beneath the shadows of one of the yews,
  chanting an odd stanza or so of one of his wild staves, wrapped the while, it
  would seem, in affectionate contemplation of the subject-matter of his
  song:</p>

  <h3>THE CHURCHYARD YEW</h3>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">&mdash;&mdash; Metuendaque succo<br>
  Taxus. &mdash;<span class="smcap">Statius.</span></p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">A noxious tree is the churchyard yew,<br>
  As if from the dead its sap it drew;<br>
  Dark are its branches, and dismal to see,<br>
  Like plumes at Death's latest solemnity.<br>
  Spectral and jagged, and black as the wings<br>
  Which some spirit of ill o'er a sepulchre flings:<br>
  Oh! a terrible tree is the churchyard yew;<br>
  Like it is nothing so grimly to view.</p>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">Yet this baleful tree hath a core so sound,<br>
  Can nought so tough in the grove be found;<br>
  From it were fashioned brave English bows,<br>
  The boast of our isle, and the dread of its foes.<br>
  For our sturdy sires cut their stoutest staves<br>
  From the branch that hung o'er their fathers' graves;<br>
  And though it be dreary and dismal to view,<br>
  Staunch at the heart is the churchyard yew.</p><br>

  <p>His ditty concluded, Alan entered the churchyard, taking care to leave the
  door slightly ajar, in order to facilitate his grandson's entrance. For an
  instant he lingered in the chancel. The yellow moonlight fell upon the
  monuments of his race; and, directed by the instinct of hate, Alan's eye
  rested upon the gilded entablature of his perfidious brother, Reginald, and,
  muttering curses, "not loud but deep," he passed on. Having lighted his
  lantern in no tranquil mood, he descended into the vault, observing a similar
  caution with respect to the portal of the cemetery, which he left partially
  unclosed, with the key in the lock. Here he resolved to abide Luke's coming.
  The reader knows what probability there was of his expectations being
  realized.</p>

  <p>For a while he paced the tomb, wrapped in gloomy meditation, and
  pondering, it might be, upon the result of Luke's expedition, and the
  fulfilment of his own dark schemes, scowling from time to time beneath his
  bent eyebrows, counting the grim array of coffins, and noticing, with
  something like satisfaction, that the shell which contained the remains of
  his daughter had been restored to its former position. He then bethought him
  of Father Checkley's midnight intrusion upon his conference with Luke, and
  their apprehension of a supernatural visitation, and his curiosity was
  stimulated to ascertain by what means the priest had gained admission to the
  spot unperceived and unheard. He resolved to sound the floor, and see whether
  any secret entrance existed; and hollowly and dully did the hard flagging
  return the stroke of his heel as he pursued his scrutiny. At length the
  metallic ringing of an iron plate, immediately behind the marble effigy of
  Sir Ranulph, resolved the point. There it was that the priest had found
  access to the vault; but Alan's disappointment was excessive, when he
  discovered that the plate was fastened on the underside, and all
  communication thence with the churchyard, or to wherever else it might
  conduct him, cut off: but the present was not the season for further
  investigation, and tolerably pleased with the discovery he had already made,
  he returned to his silent march round the sepulchre.</p>

  <p>At length a sound, like the sudden shutting of the church door, broke upon
  the profound stillness of the holy edifice. In the hush that succeeded, a
  footstep was distinctly heard threading the aisle.</p>

  <p>"He comes&mdash;he comes!" exclaimed Alan, joyfully; adding, an instant
  after, in an altered voice, "but he comes alone."</p>

  <p>The footstep drew near to the mouth of the vault&mdash;it was upon the
  stairs. Alan stepped forward to greet, as he supposed, his grandson, but
  started back in astonishment and dismay as he encountered in his stead Lady
  Rookwood. Alan retreated, while the lady advanced, swinging the iron door
  after her, which closed with a tremendous clang. Approaching the statue of
  the first Sir Ranulph, she paused, and Alan then remarked the singular and
  terrible expression of her eyes, which appeared to be fixed upon the statue,
  or upon some invisible object near it. There was something in her whole
  attitude and manner calculated to impress the deepest terror on the beholder.
  And Alan gazed upon her with an awe which momently increased. Lady Rookwood's
  bearing was as proud and erect as we have formerly described it to have
  been&mdash;her brow was haughtily bent&mdash;her chiselled lip as
  disdainfully curled; but the staring, changeless eye, and the deep-heaved sob
  which occasionally escaped her, betrayed how much she was under the influence
  of mortal terror. Alan watched her in amazement. He knew not how the scene
  was likely to terminate, nor what could have induced her to visit this
  ghostly spot at such an hour, and alone; but he resolved to abide the issue
  in silence&mdash;profound as her own. After a time, however, his impatience
  got the better of his fears and scruples, and he spoke.</p>

  <p>"What doth Lady Rookwood in the abode of the dead?" asked he, at
  length.</p>

  <p>She started at the sound of his voice, but still kept her eye fixed upon
  the vacancy.</p>

  <p>"Hast thou not beckoned me hither, and am I not come?" returned she, in a
  hollow tone. "And now thou asketh wherefore I am here&mdash;I am here
  because, as in thy life I feared thee not, neither in death do I fear thee. I
  am here because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What seest thou?" interrupted Peter, with ill-suppressed terror.</p>

  <p>"What see I&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!" shouted Lady Rookwood, amidst discordant
  laughter; "that which might appal a heart less stout than mine&mdash;a figure
  anguish-writhen, with veins that glow as with a subtle and consuming flame. A
  substance yet a shadow, in thy living likeness. Ha&mdash;frown if thou wilt;
  I can return thy glances."</p>

  <p>"Where dost thou see this vision?" demanded Alan.</p>

  <p>"Where!" echoed Lady Rookwood, becoming for the first time sensible of the
  presence of a stranger. "Ha&mdash;who are you that question me?&mdash;what
  are you?&mdash;speak!"</p>

  <p>"No matter who or what I am," returned Alan, "I ask you what you
  behold."</p>

  <p>"Can you see nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied Alan.</p>

  <p>"You knew Sir Piers Rookwood?"</p>

  <p>"Is it he?" asked Alan, drawing near her.</p>

  <p>"It is," replied Lady Rookwood; "I have followed him hither, and I will
  follow him whithersoever he leads me, were it to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What doth he now?" asked Alan; "do you see him still?"</p>

  <p>"The figure points to that sarcophagus," returned Lady Rookwood&mdash;"can
  you raise up the lid?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Alan; "my strength will not avail to lift it."</p>

  <p>"Yet let the trial be made," said Lady Rookwood; "the figure points there
  still&mdash;my own arm shall aid you."</p>

  <p>Alan watched her in dumb wonder. She advanced towards the marble monument,
  and beckoned him to follow. He reluctantly complied. Without any expectation
  of being able to move the ponderous lid of the sarcophagus, at Lady
  Rookwood's renewed request he applied himself to the task. What was his
  surprise, when, beneath their united efforts, he found the ponderous slab
  slowly revolve upon its vast hinges, and, with little further difficulty, it
  was completely elevated; though it still required the exertion of all Alan's
  strength to prop it open, and prevent its falling back.</p>

  <p>"What does it contain?" asked Lady Rookwood.</p>

  <p>"A warrior's ashes," returned Alan.</p>

  <p>"There is a rusty dagger upon a fold of faded linen," cried Lady Rookwood,
  holding down the light.</p>

  <p>"It is the weapon with which the first dame of the house of Rookwood was
  stabbed," said Alan, with a grim smile:</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:35%">"Which whoso findeth in the tomb<br>
  Shall clutch until the hour of doom;<br>
  And when 'tis grasped by hand of clay,<br>
  The curse of blood shall pass away.</p><br>

  <p>So saith the rhyme. Have you seen enough?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Lady Rookwood, precipitating herself into the marble coffin.
  "That weapon shall be mine."</p>

  <p>"Come forth&mdash;come forth," cried Alan. "My arm trembles&mdash;I cannot
  support the lid."</p>

  <p>"I will have it, though I grasp it to eternity," shrieked Lady Rookwood,
  vainly endeavoring to wrest away the dagger, which was fastened, together
  with the linen upon which it lay, by some adhesive substance to the bottom of
  the shell.</p>

  <p>At this moment Alan Rookwood happened to cast his eye upward, and he then
  beheld what filled him with new terror. The axe of the sable statue was
  poised above its head, as in the act to strike him. Some secret machinery, it
  was evident, existed between the sarcophagus lid and this mysterious image.
  But in the first impulse of his alarm Alan abandoned his hold of the slab,
  and it sunk slowly downwards. He uttered a loud cry as it moved. Lady
  Rookwood heard this cry. She raised herself at the same moment&mdash;the
  dagger was in her hand&mdash;she pressed it against the lid, but its downward
  force was too great to be withstood. The light was within the sarcophagus,
  and Alan could discern her features. The expression was terrible. She uttered
  one shriek and the lid closed for ever.</p>

  <p><a id="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>

         alt="Illustration"
       title="Illustration">
</div>

  <p>Alan was in total darkness. The light had been enclosed with Lady
  Rookwood. There was something so horrible in her probable fate, that even
  <i>he</i> shuddered as he thought upon it. Exerting all his remaining
  strength, he essayed to raise the lid, but now it was more firmly closed than
  ever. It defied all his power. Once, for an instant, he fancied that it
  yielded to his straining sinews, but it was only his hand that slided upon
  the surface of the marble. It was fixed&mdash;immovable. The sides and lid
  rang with the strokes which the unfortunate lady bestowed upon them with the
  dagger's point; but those sounds were not long heard. Presently all was
  still; the marble ceased to vibrate with her blows. Alan struck the lid with
  his knuckles, but no response was returned. All was silent.</p>

  <p>He now turned his attention to his own situation, which had become
  sufficiently alarming. An hour must have elapsed, yet Luke had not arrived.
  The door of the vault was closed&mdash;the key was in the lock, and on the
  outside. He was himself a prisoner within the tomb. What if Luke should
  <i>not</i> return? What if he were slain, as it might chance, in the
  enterprise? That thought flashed across his brain like an electric shock.
  None knew of his retreat but his grandson. He might perish of famine within
  this desolate vault.</p>

  <p>He checked this notion as soon as it was formed&mdash;it was too dreadful
  to be indulged in. A thousand circumstances might conspire to detain Luke. He
  was sure to come. Yet the solitude&mdash;the darkness was awful, almost
  intolerable. The dying and the dead were around him. He dared not stir.</p>

  <p>Another hour&mdash;an age it seemed to him&mdash;had passed. Still Luke
  came not. Horrible forebodings crossed him; but he would not surrender
  himself to them. He rose, and crawled in the direction, as he supposed, of
  the door&mdash;fearful, even of the stealthy sound of his own footsteps. He
  reached it, and his heart once more throbbed with hope. He bent his ear to
  the key; he drew in his breath; he listened for some sound, but nothing was
  to be heard. A groan would have been almost music in his ears.</p>

  <p>Another hour was gone! He was now a prey to the most frightful
  apprehensions, agitated in turns by the wildest emotions of rage and terror.
  He at one moment imagined that Luke had abandoned him, and heaped curses upon
  his head; at the next, convinced that he had fallen, he bewailed with equal
  bitterness his grandson's fate and his own. He paced the tomb like one
  distracted; he stamped upon the iron plate; he smote with his hands upon the
  door; he shouted, and the vault hollowly echoed his lamentations. But Time's
  sand ran on, and Luke arrived not.</p>

  <p>Alan now abandoned himself wholly to despair. He could no longer
  anticipate his grandson's coming, no longer hope for deliverance. His fate
  was sealed. Death awaited him. He must anticipate his slow but inevitable
  stroke, enduring all the grinding horrors of starvation. The contemplation of
  such an end was madness, but he was forced to contemplate it now; and so
  appalling did it appear to his imagination, that he half resolved to dash out
  his brains against the walls of the sepulchre, and put an end at once to his
  tortures; and nothing, except a doubt whether he might not, by imperfectly
  accomplishing his purpose, increase his own suffering, prevented him from
  putting this dreadful idea into execution. His dagger was gone, and he had no
  other weapon. Terrors of a new kind now assailed him. The dead, he fancied,
  were bursting from their coffins, and he peopled the darkness with grisly
  phantoms. They were around about him on each side, whirling and rustling,
  gibbering, groaning, shrieking, laughing, and lamenting. He was stunned,
  stifled. The air seemed to grow suffocating, pestilential; the wild laughter
  was redoubled; the horrible troop assailed him; they dragged him along the
  tomb, and amid their howls he fell, and became insensible.</p>

  <p>When he returned to himself, it was some time before he could collect his
  scattered faculties; and when the agonizing consciousness of his terrible
  situation forced itself upon his mind, he had nigh relapsed into oblivion. He
  arose. He rushed towards the door; he knocked against it with his knuckles
  till the blood streamed from them; he scratched against it with his nails
  till they were torn off by the roots. With insane fury he hurled himself
  against the iron frame; it was in vain. Again he had recourse to the
  trap-door. He searched for it; he found it. He laid himself upon the ground.
  There was no interval of space in which he could insert a finger's point. He
  beat it with his clenched hand; he tore it with his teeth; he jumped upon it;
  he smote it with his heel. The iron returned a sullen sound.</p>

  <p>He again essayed the lid of the sarcophagus. Despair nerved his strength.
  He raised the slab a few inches. He shouted, screamed, but no answer was
  returned; and again the lid fell.</p>

  <p>"She is dead!" cried Alan. "Why have I not shared her fate? But mine is to
  come. And such a death!&mdash;oh, oh!" And, frenzied at the thought, he again
  hurried to the door, and renewed his fruitless attempts to escape, till
  nature gave way, and he sank upon the floor, groaning and exhausted.</p>

  <p>Physical suffering now began to take the place of his mental tortures.
  Parched and consumed with a fierce internal fever, he was tormented by
  unappeasable thirst&mdash;of all human ills the most unendurable. His tongue
  was dry and dusty, his throat inflamed; his lips had lost all moisture. He
  licked the humid floor; he sought to imbibe the nitrous drops from the walls;
  but, instead of allaying his thirst, they increased it. He would have given
  the world, had he possessed it, for a draught of cold spring-water. Oh, to
  have died with his lips upon some bubbling fountain's marge! But to perish
  thus&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

  <p>Nor were the pangs of hunger wanting. He had to endure all the horrors of
  famine, as well as the agonies of quenchless thirst.</p>

  <p>In this dreadful state three days and nights passed over Alan's fated
  head. Nor night nor day had he. Time, with him, was only measured by its
  duration, and that seemed interminable. Each hour added to his suffering, and
  brought with it no relief. During this period of prolonged misery reason
  often tottered on her throne. Sometimes he was under the influence of the
  wildest passions. He dragged coffins from their recesses, hurled them upon
  the ground, striving to break them open and drag forth their loathsome
  contents. Upon other occasions he would weep bitterly and wildly; and
  once&mdash;only once&mdash;did he attempt to pray; but he started from his
  knees with an echo of infernal laughter, as he deemed, ringing in his ears.
  Then, again, would he call down imprecations upon himself and his whole line,
  trampling upon the pile of coffins he had reared; and lastly, more subdued,
  would creep to the boards that contained the body of his child, kissing them
  with a frantic outbreak of affection.</p>

  <p>At length he became sensible of his approaching dissolution. To him the
  thought of death might well be terrible, but he quailed not before it, or
  rather seemed, in his latest moments, to resume all his wonted firmness of
  character. Gathering together his remaining strength, he dragged himself
  towards the niche wherein his brother, Sir Reginald Rookwood, was deposited,
  and placing his hand upon the coffin, solemnly exclaimed, "My curse&mdash;my
  dying curse&mdash;be upon thee evermore!"</p>

  <p>Falling with his face upon the coffin, Alan instantly expired. In this
  attitude his remains were discovered.</p>

  <h2><a id="env"

  <p class="first">Our tale is told. Yet, perhaps, we may be allowed to add a
  few words respecting two of the subordinate characters of our
  drama&mdash;melodrama we ought to say&mdash;namely Jerry Juniper and the
  knight of Malta. What became of the Caper Merchant's son after his flight
  from Kilburn Wells we have never been able distinctly to ascertain. Juniper,
  however, would seem to be a sort of Wandering Jew, for certain it is, that
  <i>somebody very like him</i> is extant still, and to be met with at Jerry's
  old haunts; indeed, we have no doubt of encountering him at the ensuing
  meetings of Ascot and Hampton.</p>

  <p>As regards the knight of Malta&mdash;Knight of
  <i>Roads</i>&mdash;"Rhodes"&mdash;he should have been&mdash;we are sorry to
  state that the career of the Ruffler terminated in a madhouse, and thus the
  poor knight became in reality a <i>Hospitaller</i>! According to the custom
  observed in those establishments, the knight was deprived of his luxuriant
  locks, and the loss of his beard rendered his case incurable; but, in the
  mean time, the barber of the place made his fortune by retailing the
  materials of all the black wigs he could collect to the impostor's dupes.</p>

  <p>Such is the latest piece of intelligence that has reached us of the
  <i>Arch-hoaxer</i> of Canterbury!</p>

  <p>Turpin&mdash;why disguise it?&mdash;was hanged at York in 1739. His
  firmness deserted him not at the last. When he mounted the fatal tree his
  left leg trembled; he stamped it impatiently down, and, after a brief chat
  with the hangman, threw himself suddenly and resolutely from the ladder. His
  sufferings would appear to have been slight: as he himself sang,</p><br>

  <p class="quote"
     style="margin-left:34%">He died, not as other men, by <i>degrees</i>,<br>
  But <i>at once</i>, without wincing, and quite at his ease!</p><br>

  <p>We may, in some other place, lay before the reader the
  particulars&mdash;and they are not incurious&mdash;of the "night before Larry
  was stretched."</p>

  <p>The remains of the vagrant highwayman found a final resting-place in the
  desecrated churchyard of Saint George, without the Fishergate postern, a
  green and grassy cemetery, but withal a melancholy one. A few recent tombs
  mark out the spots where some of the victims of the pestilence of 1832-33
  have been interred; but we have made vain search for Turpin's
  grave&mdash;unless&mdash;as is more than probable&mdash;the plain stone with
  the simple initials R. T. belongs to him.</p>

  <p>The gyves by which he was fettered are still shown at York Castle, and are
  of prodigious weight and strength; and though the herculean robber is said to
  have moved in them with ease, the present turnkey was scarcely able to lift
  the ponderous irons. An old woman of the same city has a lock of hair, said
  to have been Turpin's, which she avouches her grandfather cut off from the
  body after the execution, and which the believers look upon with great
  reverence. O rare Dick Turpin!</p>

  <p>We shall, perhaps, be accused of dilating too much upon the character of
  the highwayman, and we plead guilty to the charge. But we found it impossible
  to avoid running a little into extremes. Our earliest associations are
  connected with sunny scenes in Cheshire, said to have been haunted by Turpin;
  and with one very dear to us&mdash;from whose lips, now, alas! silent, we
  have listened to many stories of his exploits&mdash;he was a sort of hero. We
  have had a singular delight in recounting his feats and hairbreadth escapes;
  and if the reader derives only half as much pleasure from the perusal of his
  adventures as we have had in narrating them, our satisfaction will be
  complete. Perhaps, we may have placed him in too favorable a point of
  view&mdash;and yet we know not. As upon those of more important personages,
  many doubts rest upon his history. Such as we conceive him to have been, we
  have drawn him&mdash;hoping that the benevolent reader, upon finishing our
  Tale, will arrive at the same conclusion; and, in the words of the quaint old
  Prologue to the Prince of Prigs' Revels,</p>

  <p class="note">[9] We cannot say much in favor of this worthy, whose name
  was Thomas Simpson. The reason of his <i>sobriquet</i> does not appear. He
  was not particularly scrupulous as to his mode of appropriation. One of his
  sayings is, however, on record. He told a widow whom he robbed, "that the end
  of a woman's husband begins in tears, but the end of her tears is another
  husband." "Upon which," says his chronicler, "the gentlewoman gave him about

  <p class="note">[11] Many agreeable stories are related of Holloway. His

  <p class="note">[14] The word Tory, as here applied, must not be confounded
  with the term of party distinction now in general use in the political world.
  It simply means a thief on a grand scale, something more than "a snapper-up

  done for the ballad-mongers: some of them are, however, sufficiently well
  narrated in a pleasant little tome, published at Belfast, entitled <i>The
  History of the Rapparees</i>. We are also in possession of a funeral
  discourse, preached at the obsequies of the "noble and renowned" Henry St.
  John, Esq., who was unfortunately killed by the <i>Tories</i>&mdash;the
  <i>Destructives</i> of those days&mdash;in the induction to which we find
  some allusion to Redmond. After describing the thriving condition of the
  north of Ireland, about 1680, the Rev. Lawrence Power, the author of the
  sermon, says, "One mischief there was, which indeed in a great measure
  destroyed all, and that was a pack of insolent bloody outlaws, whom they here
  call <i>Tories</i>. These had so riveted themselves in these parts, that by
  the interest they had among the natives, and some English, too, <i>to their
  shame be it spoken</i>, they exercise a kind of separate sovereignty in three
  or four counties in the north of Ireland. <span class="smcap">Redmond
  O'Hanlon</span> is their chief, and has been these many years; a cunning,
  dangerous fellow, who, though proclaimed an outlaw with the rest of his crew,
  and sums of money set upon their heads, yet he reigns still, and keeps all in
  subjection, so far that 'tis credibly reported <i>he raises more in a year by
  contributions à-la-mode de France than the king's land taxes and
  chimney-money come to, and thereby is enabled to bribe clerks and
  officers</i>, <b>if not their masters</b>, (!) <i>and makes all too much
  truckle to him</i>." Agitation, it seems, was not confined to our own
  days&mdash;but the "finest country in the world" has been, and ever will be,
  the same. The old game is played under a new color&mdash;the only difference
  being, that had Redmond lived in our time, he would, in all probability, not
  only have pillaged a county, but <i>represented</i> it in parliament. The
  spirit of the Rapparee is still abroad&mdash;though we fear there is little
  of the <i>Tory</i> left about it. We recommend this note to the serious
  consideration of the declaimers against the sufferings of the "six
  millions."</p>

  <i>Tory</i>&mdash;and would have made great proficiency in learning if he had

  and by his skill in music gained the favor of some of the leading musicians
  in the country, who endeavored to get him reprieved."&mdash;<i>History of the

  singular:&mdash;"When he was brought into court to receive sentence of death,
  the judge told him that he was informed he should say 'that there was not a
  rope in Ireland sufficient to hang him. But,' says he, 'I'll try if Kilkenny
  can't afford one strong enough to do your business; and if that will not do,
  you shall have another, and another.' Then he ordered the sheriff to choose a
  rope, and Delany was ordered for execution the next day. The sheriff having
  notice of his mother's boasting that no rope could hang her son&mdash;and
  pursuant to the judge's desire&mdash;provided two ropes, but Delany broke
  them one after the other! The sheriff was then in a rage, and went for three
  bed-cords, which he plaited threefold together, <i>and they did his
  business</i>! Yet the sheriff was afraid he was not dead; and in a passion,
  to make trial, stabbed him with his sword in the soles of his feet, and at
  last cut the rope. After he was cut down, his body was carried into the
  courthouse, where it remained in the coffin for two days, standing up, till
  the judge and all the spectators were fully satisfied that he was stiff and
  dead, and then permission was given to his friends to remove the corpse and
  bury it."-<i>History of the Rapparees</i>.</p>

  <p class="note">[74] This song describes pretty accurately the career of an
  extraordinary individual, who, in the lucid intervals of a half-crazed
  understanding, imposed himself upon the credulous inhabitants of Canterbury,
  in the year 1832, as a certain <span class="smcap">"Sir William Percy
  Honeywood Courtenay, Knight of Malta;"</span> and contrived&mdash;for there
  was considerable "method in his madness"&mdash;to support the deception
  during a long period. The anachronism of his character in a tale&mdash;the
  data of which is nearly a century back&mdash;will, perhaps, be overlooked,
  when it is considered of how much value, in the illustration of "wise saws,"
  are "<i>modern instances</i>." Imposture and credulity are of all ages; and
  the Courtenays of the nineteenth are rivalled by the Tofts and Andrés of the
  eighteenth century. The subjoined account of the <i>soi-disant</i>
  <span class="smcap">Sir William Courtenay</span> is extracted from "An Essay
  on his Character, and Reflections on his Trial," published at the theatre of
  his exploits: "About Michaelmas last it was rumored that an extraordinary man
  was staying at the Rose Inn of this city&mdash;Canterbury&mdash;who passed
  under the name of Count Rothschild, but had been recently known in London by
  the name of Thompson! This would have been sufficient to excite attention,
  had no other incidents materially added to the excitement. His costume and
  countenance denoted foreign extraction, while his language and conversation
  showed that he was well acquainted with almost every part of this kingdom. He
  was said to live with singular frugality, notwithstanding abundant samples of
  wealth, and professions of an almost unlimited command of money. He appeared
  to study retirement, if not concealment, although subsequent events have
  proved that society of every grade, beneath the middle class, is the element
  in which he most freely breathes. <i>He often decked his person with a fine
  suit of Italian clothing, and sometimes with the more gay and imposing
  costume of the Eastern nations; yet these foreign habits were for months
  scarcely visible beyond the limits of the inn of his abode, and the chapel
  not far from it, in which he was accustomed to offer his Sabbath
  devotions.</i> This place was the first to which he made a public and
  frequent resort; and though he did not always attempt to advance towards the
  uppermost seat in the synagogue, he attracted attention from the mere
  singularity of his appearance.</p>

  <p class="note">"Such was the eccentric, incongruous individual who surprised
  our city by proposing himself as a third candidate for its representation,
  and who created an entertaining contest for the honor, long after the sitting
  candidates had composed themselves to the delightful vision of an inexpensive
  and unopposed return. The notion of representing the city originated beyond
  all doubt in the fertile brain of the man himself. It would seem to have been
  almost as sudden a thought in his mind, as it was a sudden and surprising
  movement in the view of the city; nor have we been able to ascertain whether
  his sojourn at the Rose was the cause or the effect of his offering to
  advocate our interests in Parliament&mdash;whether he came to the city with
  that high-minded purpose, or subsequently formed the notion, when he saw, or
  thought he saw, an opening for a stranger of enterprise like himself.</p>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="note">"As the county election drew on, we believe between the
  nomination on Barham Downs and the voting in the cattle market of the city,
  the draught of a certain handbill was sent to a printer of this city, with a
  request that he would publish it without delay. Our readers will not be
  surprised that he instantly declined the task; but as we have obtained
  possession of the copy, and its publication can now do no injury to any one,
  we entertain them with a sight of this delectable sample of Courtenay
  prudence and politeness.</p>

  <p class="note">"'O yes! O yes! O yes! I, Lord Viscount William Courtenay, of
  Powderham Castle, Devon, do hereby proclaim Sir Thomas Tylden, Sir Brook
  Brydges, Sir Edward Knatchbull, and Sir William Cosway, four cowards, unfit
  to represent, or to assist in returning members of Parliament to serve the
  brave men of Kent.</p>

  <p class="note">"'Percy Honeywood Courtenay, of Hales and Evington Place,
  Kent, and Knight of Malta.</p>

  <p class="note">"'Any gentleman desiring to know the reasons why Lord
  Courtenay so publicly exposes backbiters, any man of honor shall have
  satisfaction at his hands, and in a public way, according to the laws of our
  land&mdash;trial by combat; when the Almighty God, the Lord of Hosts is his
  name, can decide the "truth," whether it is a libel or not. I worship truth
  as my God, and will die for it&mdash;and upon this we will see who is
  strongest, God or man.'</p>

  <p class="note">"It is a coincidence too curious to be overlooked, that this
  doughty champion of <i>truth</i> should so soon have removed himself from
  public life by an act of deliberate and wanton perjury. We never read any of
  his rhapsodies, periodical or occasional, till the publication of this essay
  imposed the self-denying task upon us; but now we find that they abound in
  strong and solemn appeals to the <i>truth</i>; in bold proclamations that
  <i>truth</i> is his palladium; in evidences that he writes and raves, that he
  draws his sword and clenches his fist, that he expends his property and the
  property of others committed to his hands, in no cause but that of
  <i>truth</i>! His famous periodical contains much vehement declamation in
  defence of certain doctrines of religion, which he terms the truth of the
  sublime system of Christianity, and for which alone he is content to live,
  and also willing to die. All who deviate from his standard of truth, whether
  theological or moral, philosophical or political, he appears to consider as
  neither fit for life nor death. Now it is a little strange, his warmest
  followers being witness, that such an advocate of truth should have become
  the willing victim of falsehood, the ready and eager martyr of the worst form
  of falsehood&mdash;perjury.</p>

  <p class="note">"The decline of his influence between the city and county
  elections has been partly attributed, and not without reason, to the sudden
  change in his appearance from comparative youth to advancing, if not extreme
  age. <i>On the hustings of the city he shone forth in all the dazzling lustre
  of an Oriental chief; and such was the effect of gay clothing on the meridian
  of life, that his admirers, especially of the weaker sex, would insist upon
  it that he had not passed the beautiful spring-time of May. There were,
  indeed, some suspicious appearances of a near approach to forty, if not two
  or three years beyond it; but these were fondly ascribed to his foreign
  travels in distant and insalubrious climes; he had acquired his duskiness of
  complexion, and his strength of feature and violence of gesture, and his
  profusion of beard, in Egypt and Syria, in exploring the catacombs of the one
  country, and bowing at the shrines of the other. On the other hand, the
  brilliancy of his eye, the melody of his voice, and the elasticity of his
  muscles and limbs, were sufficient arguments in favor of his having scarcely
  passed the limit that separates manhood from youth.</i></p>

  <p class="note">"All doubts on these points were removed, when the crowd of
  his fair admirers visited him at the retirement of his inn, and the intervals
  of his polling. These <i>sub-Rosa</i> interviews&mdash;we allude to the name
  of the inn, and not to anything like privacy there, which the very place and
  number of the visitors altogether precluded&mdash;convinced them that he was
  even a younger and lovelier man than his rather boisterous behavior in the
  hall would allow them to hope. In fact, he was now installed by acclamation
  <i>Knight of Canterbury as well as Malta, and King of Kent as well as
  Jerusalem</i>! It became dangerous then to whisper a syllable of suspicion
  against his wealth or rank, his wisdom or beauty; and all who would not bow
  down before this golden image were deemed worthy of no better fate than
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego&mdash;to be cast into a burning fiery
  furnace."</p>

  <p class="note">As a sequel to the above story, it may be added that the
  knight of Malta became the inmate of a lunatic asylum; and on his liberation
  was shot at the head of a band of Kentish hinds, whom he had persuaded that
  he was the Messiah!</p>

  <p class="note">[77] The supposed malignant influence of this plant is
  frequently alluded to by our elder dramatists; and with one of the greatest
  of them, Webster&mdash;as might be expected from a muse revelling like a
  ghoul in graves and sepulchres&mdash;it is an especial favorite. But none
  have plunged so deeply into the subject as Sir Thomas Browne. He tears up the
  fable root and branch. Concerning the danger ensuing from eradication of the
  mandrake, the learned physician thus writes: "The last assertion is, that
  there follows a hazard of life to them that pull it up, that some evil fate
  pursues them, and that they live not very long hereafter. Therefore the
  attempt hereof among the ancients was not in ordinary way; but, as Pliny
  informeth, when they intended to take up the root of this plant, they took
  the wind thereof, and with a sword describing three circles about it, they
  digged it up, looking toward the west. A conceit not only injurious unto
  truth and confutable by daily experience, but somewhat derogatory unto the
  providence of God; that is, not only to impose so destructive a quality on
  any plant, but to conceive a vegetable whose parts are so useful unto many,
  should, in the only taking up, prove mortal unto any. This were to introduce
  a second forbidden fruit, and enhance the first malediction, making it not
  only mortal for Adam to taste the one, but capital for his posterity to
  eradicate or dig up the other."&mdash;<i>Vulgar Errors</i>, book ii. c.

  though once the old road from Altringham to Knutsford skirting the rich and
  sylvan domains of Dunham, and descending the hill that brings you to the
  bridge crossing the little river Bollin. With some difficulty we penetrated
  this ravine. It is just the place for an adventure of the kind. A small brook
  wells through it; and the steep banks are overhung with timber, and were,
  when we last visited the place, in April, 1834, a perfect nest of primroses
  and wild flowers. Hough (pronounced Hoo) Green lies about three miles across
  the country&mdash;the way Turpin rode. The old Bowling-green is one of the

  published, we regret to state&mdash;for to <i>us</i>, at least, it is matter
  of regret, though probably not to the travellers along the Edgeware
  Road&mdash;that this gentle ascent has been cut through, and the fair
  prospect from its brow utterly destroyed.</p>

  <p class="note">[110] This, we regret to say, is not the case. The memory of
  bold Will Davies, the "<i>Golden Farmer</i>"&mdash;so named from the
  circumstances of his always paying his rent in gold,&mdash;is fast declining
  upon his peculiar domain, Bagshot. The inn, which once bore his name, still
  remains to point out to the traveller the dangers his forefathers had to
  encounter in crossing this extensive heath. Just beyond this house the common
  spreads out for miles on all aides in a most gallop-inviting style; and the
  passenger, as he gazes from the box of some flying coach, as we have done,
  upon the gorse-covered waste, may, without much stretch of fancy, imagine he
  beholds Will Davies careering like the wind over its wild and undulating
  expanse. We are sorry to add that the "<i>Golden</i> Farmer" has altered its
  designation to the "<i>Jolly</i> Farmer." This should be amended; and when
  next we pass that way, we hope to see the original sign restored. We cannot
  afford to lose our <i>golden</i> farmers.</p>
