  <br>

  <p class="first">IT is almost inconceivable that there should be in our
  family a Black Avon who was, for any reason whatever, an unpopular figure.
  They have for scores of generations been built in an heroic mould; a shining
  light of their time, and their memories have been hallowed by all who bear
  our name.</p>

  <p>My niece, Lorrain Avon, crystallized the peculiar change of attitude in
  one pungent, if somewhat vulgar, sentence.</p>

  <p>"The boys simply cannot stand an Avon who works for his living," she said.
  "They think that a Black Avon who doesn't spend his life gadding over the
  earth, sticking his sword into some poor, wretched enemy, isn't the real
  thing!"</p>

  <p>"Lorrain," I said severely, "your language is becoming deplorably
  lax."</p>

  <p>My brother, Sir James Avon, is not what I would describe as a broad-minded
  man, and he shares the views of his two sons, Hubert and Stanley, that this
  Avon, who had suddenly dawned upon us, was indubitably a true Black Avon who
  would have satisfied the most exacting of critics, but was nevertheless a
  black sheep.</p>

  <p>Of the new Harry. Avon's existence I don't think any of us were previously
  aware, except in a vague kind of way. He belonged to that branch of the
  family which had settled in India and had moved on to the Cape. Harry's
  father had been something of a recluse, maintained no correspondence with the
  other branches of the family, and had offended my brother to an unimaginable
  extent by sending his boy to England to be educated, without notifying any of
  us of his intentions. So that Harry Avon was living under our noses, so to
  speak&mdash;he was at Oundle School, one greatly favoured by our
  family&mdash;and none of us was the wiser. And then, when we had almost
  forgotten that there was a South African branch, Harry Avon comes from South
  Africa, buys Manby Hall, adjacent to my brother's estate, and, without so
  much as "by your leave," begins to interest himself in the welfare of the
  village.</p>

  <p>"In fact, he trespassed on our preserves," said Lorrain, with the ghost of
  a smile, when she told me this. "Daddy likes to feel that he is the feudal
  lord of Manby, and he is simply furious that Cousin Harry should have bought
  the estate, which carries with it the lordship of the manor. As a matter of
  fact, father intended buying the Hall, and that wretched London agent
  promised to give him the first refusal. I met him to-day in the village."</p>

  <p>"Whom&mdash;your father?"</p>

  <p>"No, Harry. And really, he's quite a nice man: very tall, horribly black,
  with a cold sort of blue eye that makes you shiver. I was sufficiently lost
  to all self-respect, as I have been told repeatedly, to go up to him and tell
  him that I was his cousin."</p>

  <p>"And was he cold and stern and haughty?" I asked, with a smile.</p>

  <p>"No, he was simply charming. When I asked him why he hadn't called on us,
  he said that he had no idea there were any Avons left in England!"</p>

  <p>She rocked with laughter at the cool audacity of the man.</p>

  <p>"And, Uncle John, he is terribly rich, and full of the weirdest ideas
  about this country. He says there is going to be a great war."</p>

  <p>"What does your father say to that?"</p>

  <p>Lorrain made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"What would father say to any view which did not coincide with his own?"
  she demanded. "Harry has been for two years on the Continent&mdash;father
  didn't know that. He's been travelling through the Balkans, Austria, Germany,
  Russia and Russian China, and he is full of this idea of war. What do you
  think about it, Uncle John?" she asked, a little anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Pooh!" I said contemptuously. "How can there be a war? The world is
  governed by humane and intelligent men. There may be threats and
  sabre-rattling, but that sort of thing is part of the diplomatic game. I have
  not served in the Foreign Office for twenty-five years without knowing that,
  Lorrain."</p>

  <p>She was silent at this, and then:</p>

  <p>"I told him about you, and he wondered if you would come to the
  Hall&mdash;he said he would like to meet a Foreign Office official for whom
  he had some reverence!"</p>

  <p>I laughed.</p>

  <p>"The young dog ought to call on me, unless his bump of respect is
  abnormally under-developed," I said. "But I am no stickler for the
  proprieties, and I will call on him at the first opportunity I find."</p>

  <p>My work in Whitehall was not very strenuous, for, as head of a department
  of the Foreign Office, my hours were not long. And the opportunity was at
  hand, because my brother invited me to spend a week-end with him at his
  country place in Norfolk. I drove through the little village of Manby, saw
  the white lines of Manby Manor as I passed along the road, and wondered what
  sort of material this new Black Avon would provide for a poor scribe.</p>

  <p>Many years ago it had been laughingly said by some of our family that I
  should write the story of the next Black Avon; but during all the fifty-five
  years of my life no Black Avon had arisen to succeed that brave man who fell
  in the Indian Mutiny. There were red Avons, one of whom fulfilled the
  prediction of the old prophet who said: "Red Avon a lord, Black Avon a
  sword." There were fair Avons, and, alas! there were now a few grey Avons!
  But the Black Avon of romance had not yet crossed the horizon, and I could
  not help thinking, a little ruefully, that this young man who had arrived so
  annoyingly from South Africa, and had obtruded himself upon our lives, was
  likely to be very unpromising material indeed.</p>

  <p>When I reached Avon Place I found that the question of the new Black Avon
  occupied the minds of my brother and his family to an extraordinary
  extent.</p>

  <p>"What do you imagine the young beggar has done?" demanded James furiously.
  "He has had a meeting in the village, and raised a sort of glorified Boy
  Scouts team amongst the elder boys! He says that war is coming and that they
  should be truly prepared! He takes them out on long walks and gives them
  lectures on military subjects. War, indeed! He is a publicity-hunting young
  scoundrel! And he hasn't even so much as been to this place to leave his
  card!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he doesn't understand his responsibilities to the great family,"
  I said good-humouredly. "And, anyway, James, isn't it our business to call on
  him? I've been tracing his history this morning, and undoubtedly he belongs
  to what I call the major branch of the Avons."</p>

  <p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said my brother violently.</p>

  <p>"It may be stuff and it may be nonsense," I replied, "but here is the
  fact, that the home of the Avons is in Hampshire."</p>

  <p>"The real home of the Avons is in Norfolk," insisted Sir James.</p>

  <p>"In Hampshire, old boy," I said gently, and I was prepared to trace back
  the family to the days of Stephen to prove my words, but he knew very well
  that what I said was true.</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether he's an old branch or a young branch or a mere tine!
  He's been out of England so long that he's not entitled to be in the family
  at all," said John illogically.</p>

  <p>"He's an awful bounder too, Uncle," Stanley put in. "He's gassing all the
  time about Germany and how efficient she is."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, but I've heard it from other people. He had a meeting in the village
  the other night and talked for two hours."</p>

  <p>I asked if "the foreign Avon," as my brother insisted upon calling him,
  was popular in the village, and I was rather amused when James growled
  something about "publicity hunting," and gathered therefrom that the strange
  Avon had won his way into the affections of the countryside.</p>

  <p>"Why he should be popular I don't know!" exploded James. "He's a fellow
  who doesn't hunt, hasn't a single friend amongst the county families, and has
  already succeeded in antagonizing half of them."</p>

  <p>It appeared that Harry Avon had very much annoyed the sitting member, Sir
  Wilbraham Stote, who was what my brother, a most hard-shelled Conservative,
  described as "a respectable Liberal." It appeared that Harry had attended the
  meeting which Sir Wilbraham held every year in order to keep in touch with
  his constituents, and had asked a lot of ridiculous questions about the state
  of Europe.</p>

  <p>"State of Europe indeed!" snorted James. "Europe is in the same state it
  has always been and always will be. This German Emperor fellow is no bad
  sort. I met him at Kiel three years ago, and he was quite charming to
  me."</p>

  <p>I might have told James that, however much they bulked in the public eye,
  kings and emperors were not always as powerful as they appeared to be, and
  that usually there was somebody behind the throne of a semi-despotic
  monarchy, who directed affairs, pulled wires without the least compunction
  about who would suffer at the other end, and generally maintained in
  themselves and their associates the real government of the country.</p>

  <p>It was rather a queer coincidence that I should be in Norfolk that night
  when Harry made one of the few attempts he had so far initiated to soothe the
  ruffled feelings of my brother. A footman brought a note asking us if the
  whole family would dine with him that Saturday night, or, alternatively, if
  we would go over after dinner.</p>

  <p>"At three hours' notice!" spluttered James. "Good heavens! what does he
  think we are&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>It was Lorrain who came to the rescue. There was a very level head on
  those young shoulders, and her brother never failed to insist that it was she
  who dominated the house.</p>

  <p>"We'll go after dinner, darling," she said to her father. "I'm most
  anxious to meet him at close quarters. And really, it would be the civil
  thing to do. He is one of our family&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fiddlesticks!" her father scoffed.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he sent a somewhat ungraciously worded message back to the
  effect that he would be at the Hall at nine o'clock.</p>

  </div>

  <p>We drove over in my car, a fairly large party to descend upon a bachelor;
  but I verily believe that, if we had been five hundred strong instead of
  five, Harry Avon would have shown no surprise.</p>

  <p>He came out into the big hall to greet us: a thin, brown-faced man, with
  calm eyes and perfectly carved lips. They were almost too good for a man, as
  Lorrain confided to me afterwards.</p>

  <p>But I am one of those crusty bachelors who think that nothing is too good
  for my own sex. His voice was low, and, to my surprise, cultured (I don't
  know why on earth it shouldn't have been but somehow one visualized him as
  being a little uncouth); and my first impression was that he was a man who
  missed nothing. When Lorrain's cup was put down it was he who was instantly
  at her side to take it away; when James felt in his pocket for his gold
  matchbox to light one of his excellent cigars, it was Harry who was
  immediately at his elbow with a match.</p>

  <p>I think James was mollified both by his deference and by his obvious
  knowledge of affairs. He was older than I had expected&mdash;nearer
  twenty-eight than twenty-five (as they had first told me)&mdash;and he had a
  queerly incisive&mdash;perhaps decisive would be a better word&mdash;way of
  discussion which in any other man would have irritated me.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-02"
     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE COMING WAR</h2>

  <p class="first">OF course, James pooh-poohed all his theories, but I, who
  had an inside knowledge of Europe, though I couldn't openly confirm his
  views, knew that he was speaking nothing but the truth.</p>

  <p>Inevitably we came to the question of war. James, on his way over to the
  Hall, had confided to me that he intended stopping that sort of absurd
  propaganda.</p>

  <p>"Now come, come, Harry Avon," said James, who is, I confess, a little
  pompous and patriarchal in his manner, "you do not seriously mean that are
  going to have a world war?"</p>

  <p>Harry nodded.</p>

  <p>"With whom?"</p>

  <p>"With Germany: that is certain."</p>

  <p>James smiled.</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously mean to suggest," he asked deliberately, "that Germany
  is secretly preparing to fall upon the nations of Europe and destroy them? Is
  that what you say?"</p>

  <p>Harry had a musical little laugh, very soft and very amused.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing of the sort, Sir James. They talk war and they think war,
  but the cause of that is mainly psychological. After all," he went on, as he
  flicked the ash of his cigarette into a shallow silver tray, "if you are
  governing a nation it is your job to watch out for all eventualities. And if
  you think war is inevitable, it is equally your job, not only to tell your
  people so, but to imbue them with the idea that they are the greatest
  military nation on earth, and that, if war comes, they have nothing to be
  afraid about."</p>

  <p>"That's sheer boastfulness," said James.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. We do the same sort of thing when we sing 'Britannia rules
  the waves!' The psychological effect is that we believe that Britannia rules
  the waves, and that, whatever happens, we can never be defeated at sea."</p>

  <p>I broke in here.</p>

  <p>"You think then," I asked, "That Germany is preparing for war?"</p>

  <p>"For the possibilities of war," he corrected.</p>

  <p>Probably I did not make myself quite plain, but I explained to him that
  what I meant to ask was: was Germany's intention to provoke war? This was a
  matter which had been the subject of many discussions at the Foreign
  Office.</p>

  <p>He laughed again.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you are using too limited a term. Where does provocation
  begin? If is very difficult to trace any war to an immediate cause. For
  example, who would trace the Crimean War to the threat of the Austrian
  Emperor against the Russian Army? And what was the provocation in the
  Franco-Prussian War? The immediate provocation any school history book will
  tell you. But I submit that the real provocation went back to the days of
  Merovingian kings! Alsace, for example, has been German in language and
  religion, off and on, since the twelfth century. No, what the German rulers
  have done is, as I say, to prepare for war; and war, of course, is
  inevitable, for no one reason, but for many."</p>

  <p>He had a trick of walking up and down the room with his hands behind him,
  an old Avonian habit, if our ancestral scribes are to be believed.</p>

  <p>"In Germany," he said at last, "they say that France is provoking war, and
  they point to the group of statuary on the Place de la Concorde, representing
  the lost provinces, which is everlastingly smothered with flowers, to the
  society which exists to keep alive the memory of French humiliation in 1871,
  and to the constant pinpricks which France, more wily in the way of
  diplomacy, has administered to the German diplomats. You people forget that
  the German, although he is a brilliant scientist, an amazingly clever
  philosopher up to a point, and probably the most industrious person in the
  world, is tremendously insular. For example, he can never understand the
  psychology of other nations, and he truly believes that there is a movement
  on foot to encircle him. He points first of all to the French and Russian
  offensive and defensive alliance, for that is what it amounts to. So long as
  that existed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And a very good thing too!" snapped James, sitting bolt upright. "The
  French and Russian alliance is the salvation of Europe."</p>

  <p>Harry Avon looked at him thoughtfully for a moment, and then:</p>

  <p>"Or the destruction," he said quietly, and added in haste "I am not
  suggesting that either of these nations designs the destruction of the
  existing system. But in Germany they are certainly regarded as a provocation.
  What will happen now, when the third side of the triangle is closed?"</p>

  <p>He sat down, took out a gold pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket,
  and drew what was roughly an isosceles triangle.</p>

  <p>"Along this line is France, along that line is Russia, stretching from the
  Baltic to the Black Sea on the one side, and from the Black Sea to Calais on
  the other. Here"&mdash;he made a semicircle about the base of the
  triangle&mdash;"is the sea. And now you have closed that to Germany, in the
  sense that Russia and France have concluded&mdash;not an alliance, it is
  true&mdash;but an understanding."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk absolute rubbish!" said James, who was inclined to be more
  than a little choleric. "We intend no harm to Germany: we are looking after
  ourselves. We must keep the peace of Europe. And thank God, King Edward has
  succeeded in establishing the Entente Cordiale!"</p>

  <p>The Black Avon said nothing to this. I have a shrewd idea that he had
  pretty well sized up James, and knew how valueless argument was with my poor,
  illogical brother.</p>

  <p>"The point is, Sir James," he said at last, "that Germany looks at the
  matter from one angle and we look at it from another. We say of Germany that
  it is planning world domination; it says that sooner or later it must fight
  for its life, to destroy two enemies, one of whom is obsessed with a desire
  for revenge, and the other actuated by a sense of fear. Germany and Russia
  are afraid of one another: let that sink into your mind. You're at the
  Foreign Office, are you not, Sir John?"</p>

  <p>I nodded.</p>

  <p>"Would you endorse what I say?"</p>

  <p>At this I laughed.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't expect me to endorse any statement affecting foreign
  policy," I said good-humouredly, and the Black Avon was amused.</p>

  <p>"Are you suggesting," asked James in his most awful voice, "that there is
  a conspiracy between these three great nations, France, Russia and England,
  to crush Germany out of existence, and that war will be deliberately
  made?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest nothing of the kind. Wars are seldom deliberately made, nor are
  they engineered at the will of one man or one nation. They arise out of
  stupid and uncontrollable circumstances. Look at the position in South
  Europe! Three nations, the Serbs, the Greeks and the Bulgarians, hating one
  another like poison, and all loathing the Turks! Bulgaria, with a German
  prince; Serbia, a veritable hotbed of political intrigue. I can tell you
  this, that I wasn't in Belgrade two days before I discovered that it was the
  centre of a Slav conspiracy to keep the Serbian population of Austria-Hungary
  in a state of constant ferment. From Belgrade these incitements to mutiny
  against the Austrian Emperor are going out all the time. There is a lot to be
  said for the Serbian attitude; there is just as much to be said for the
  Austrian. The awful thing about wars and their cause is that no side is,
  hopelessly wrong and no side is absolutely right! Austria is watching events
  all the time, conscious of the agitation which is being aroused against her,
  filled with resentment and a desire to punish these Serbian conspirators who
  are seeking to dismember their empire. And the queer thing about it all is
  that the agitation against Austria is justified!</p>

  <p>"Do you suggest," I asked, "that the Serbian Government connives at these
  plottings against Austria?"</p>

  <p>And to my surprise at such an action in so grave an individual, Harry
  winked!</p>

  <p>"The Serbian Government know nothing officially. But one of these days
  something will happen that will drag the rulers of Serbia at the tail of
  these irresponsible conspirators; and when that happens, the fat will be in
  the fire! Russia regards herself as a sort of guardian angel of all the Slav
  nations. The moment Austria attacks Serbia, Russia will intervene. The moment
  Russia is mobilized, Germany must come to the assistance of her ally. It is
  very simple&mdash;action and reaction! A political chemist who knows the
  formula will tell you into exactly what position every country in Europe will
  driven."</p>

  <p>As I drove home that evening I was a little puzzled by the Black Avon. At
  first glance he seemed to me what we subsequently called a "pro German"; and
  had those views been expressed during the terrible years that followed, he
  would have been denounced and probably imprisoned. But in war time, under the
  emotional stress which war brings, one's perception becomes a little warped,
  and perspectives shift, so that it is almost impossible to judge any view
  sanely. When a nation is at war there is only one side to any question, and
  that is the side one is on.</p>

  <p>I liked the young man much more than I had expected. But James was very
  bitter about him.</p>

  <p>"He comes here with these high-falutin', socialistic, nonsensical..."</p>

  <p>I will not attempt to reproduce his adjectives.</p>

  <p>"...to hear him talk you would think that everybody was wrong except
  Germany."</p>

  <p>"That is not how it struck me," I said, in justice to Harry. "It rather
  seemed that he was taking a very clear-headed view of a situation which might
  develop terribly."</p>

  <p>James looked round at me sharply, in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"Do you seriously mean that?" he asked, troubled. "I thought the Algeciras
  Conference had settled all outstanding difficulties?"</p>

  <p>"It has settled nothing," I replied.</p>

  <p>He was referring to the conference which was called by the Powers and
  which was to define the various spheres of influence in Morocco. France and
  Spain had equal claims; Germany had sent a warship, rather provocatively, to
  remind the French that she also had nationals in Morocco and that she might
  conceivably demand a share in the settlement of that disturbed and
  ill-governed country. It was little more than a gesture, since for the moment
  there was no possibility of Europe allowing Germany to establish herself in
  Morocco and it served only to remind the French that Germany would not submit
  to any act of aggrandisement on their part, and indeed the outcome of the
  conference was the surrender by France of a slice of the French Congo in
  return for Germany's agreement to the claims of France.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Poor James has not what I would call international mind, and I explained
  to him patiently and rather laboriously, I am afraid, just all that Algeciras
  Conference had stood for. There was of course a chance of war at that period,
  but nobody desired the war less than France, who was unprepared, and was at
  the time replacing her artillery with that now famous gun, the 75.</p>

  <p>Lorrain, who had listened entranced to the political outline which Harry
  had drawn, was silent all the way back to the house, and then, when her
  father had gone into the library, she took me aside in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think he's splendid Uncle?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I think he's very interesting," I said carefully.</p>

  <p>"Interesting! He's wonderful!" she breathed. "And I'm sure what he says is
  perfectly right, and Daddy's a dear old silly."</p>

  <p>"What do Hubert and Stanley think?" For two boys had accompanied us.
  Hubert was officer in a cavalry regiment, and Stanley, who was at Sandhurst,
  was going into the Guards.</p>

  <p>Lorrain laughed.</p>

  <p>"Hubert loathes him," she said, with a twinkle her eye. "Apparently Cousin
  Harry said something about the uselessness of cavalry in modern war, and of
  course Bertie will never forgive him that! And naturally, if Hubert loathes
  him, Stanley will loathe him worse."</p>

  <p>We attended service at the old village church on the following morning,
  and to my surprise I found Harry there. Lorrain told me that he had never
  gone before, to her knowledge, and wondered why he had taken this unusual
  step. When I suggested that she might possibly be the attraction, she seemed
  annoyed but I am perfectly sure was not.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE BALKANS</h2>

  <p class="first">I HAD thought a lot about him him that morning, and in the
  afternoon I took the car and drove over to Manby Hall. As a rule, a Foreign
  Office official does not take a great deal of notice of views expressed by
  youthful amateurs. We have our own sources of information, and they rarely
  fail us. But I was rather impressed, not only by his sincerity, but with the
  assurance of this young man (I was by way of being a cousin of his, but when
  we got to know each other better he never called me anything but uncle, and
  that title I very proudly accepted).</p>

  <p>He was walking up and down the broad terrace when my car came into view,
  and descended the stone steps to meet me.</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough, I wondered whether you would come," he said, with a
  twinkle in his eye.</p>

  <p>"You didn't expect my brother, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Sir James? Hardly! We do not speak the same language. And it is only
  natural that we shouldn't." And then, without any warning he asked me
  bluntly: "What do you think of Grey?"</p>

  <p>I stared at him.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean Sir Edward Grey?" I asked incredulously, and he
  nodded.</p>

  <p>One would hardly expect that a permanent official of the Foreign Office
  should give an immediate and perfectly frank answer about his political
  chief, but happily I was in a position to do so.</p>

  <p>"He is a very strong man," I said, "and a very human man."</p>

  <p>"Strong?" He frowned. "I wonder how strong? I have an impression of him as
  a being who is rather gentle, and inclined to compromise&mdash;the latter
  quality is all to the good. Have you any idea of his views about a
  Continental war? I realize I am asking you something that I should not ask,
  but I thought that, perhaps, being a relative of mine, you would trust
  me."</p>

  <p>Without giving me chance to reply, he took my arm and we walked into the
  house.</p>

  <p>"You see, Uncle John&mdash;I'm going to call you Uncle John, though I
  don't suppose you're any such relation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To be exact, I'm your third cousin," I said humorously, "but I'll accept
  'uncle' from you as a compliment."</p>

  <p>"The fact is," he continued, "I am a very rich man: an enormously rich
  man. I have a diamond mine which is practically my own, and I am the
  proprietor of the newly discovered goldfield of Southern Angola. You hinted
  last night that you have sources of information which give you an advantage
  over me. Let me tell you that I can command even more reliable agents, for
  the simple reason that we have a big selling organisation in this country,
  the agents of which are paid much better than yours, and on the whole I think
  are a more competent service. And my information is that there will be war in
  three or four years."</p>

  <p>This was not a statement to be turned with a jest. He was, I knew,
  immensely wealthy; indeed, the company of which he held the majority of
  shares had recently put up an office building in the City of London at the
  cost of half a million, and I knew, too, that these financial houses paid
  well for information and commanded a truly wonderful service.</p>

  <p>"Germany can't wait any longer," he went on. "They are scared sick at the
  thought of common action between France, Russia, and Britain, or what they
  call the encirclement of Germany. And there is a lot to be said for their
  point of view. It is in vain that I have urged upon some of their best
  friends&mdash;Ballin, the great shipowner of the Hamburg-America Line,
  Stinnes and other great leaders of industry&mdash;that the present entente
  between Russia, France and England is the fine guarantee for the peace of
  Europe. The business men in Germany agree, but they say that there is a
  section of our Press which is determined to present Germany as the menace of
  Europe, and that the combination against them is an offensive one."</p>

  <p>"What did you reply to that?"</p>

  <p>Harry shrugged.</p>

  <p>"One cannot argue with national prejudices," he said. "And how could I in
  honesty? We in this country believe that Germany is aiming to dominate the
  world; and when you take that view to an intelligent German, he is in just as
  helpless a position as I am! He simply cannot argue with what he believes to
  be a lie. And yet we may both be telling the truth. There may be a substratum
  of fact in his contention that France has her mind fixed steadfastly upon a
  policy of revenge, and has organized a circle of enemies to destroy the
  German nation. There is certainly more than a substratum of truth in the fact
  that we in Britain are alarmed and worried and concerned by these constant
  threats and bellicose utterances of the German Emperor. But, my dear uncle,
  that is part of his job! He is the glorified advertisement manager of German
  strength and German purpose. He rattles the sabre as the showman bangs his
  drum&mdash;he is very much in the position of a man who, seeing himself
  approached by three enemies, as he believes, threatens them individually in
  order to prevent co-operative action between them all."</p>

  <p>He asked me a question about Mr. Asquith, and he agreed with me in my view
  of that statesman.</p>

  <p>"It is one of the popular lunacies of this country, and indeed of most
  countries,&mdash;that patriotism is the monopoly of a party," he said, and
  told me that he had had breakfast with Mr. Lloyd George, and had met Mr.
  Winston Churchill at a reception. "Personally," he said, "I believe that the
  mischief is done, and that there is no Government of man's contriving which
  could avert the disaster. The suspicion of the Germans in England, the
  suspicion of the British in Germany, are factors beyond remedy."</p>

  <p>I went back to London the next morning, rather impressed with the warning
  note that the new Avon had sounded. My talk with him on that Saturday
  afternoon revealed many side issues, if such they can be called, which were
  new to me. I never realized that the Serbian Government could possibly be
  implicated (even "unofficially") in the agitation which was going on in the
  Austro-Hungarian empire. I knew, of course, that there was a very large
  number of discontented Serbs in that country, and that there had been one or
  two outrages committed by foolish and fanatical men. And of course the
  complaint on the part of Austria that these outrages were mainly initiated in
  Serbia with the connivance of the Government, was fairly familiar.</p>

  <p>The position in the Balkans was a peculiar one, and in 1912 was to become
  even more dangerous. In this year Serbia and Bulgaria, Greece and Montenegro
  combined against their old enemy, the Turk, and succeeded in driving him back
  to Constantinople. Here a useful purpose might have been served, and the Turk
  as a menace to European security have been eliminated, but unhappily the
  Balkan States quarrelled over the spoils of war, and in the end Bulgaria had
  to defend herself against her former allies and to receive from their hands a
  much smaller portion of the conquered territory than she would have got had
  she agreed immediately after the Turk was defeated. This left a very
  discontented Bulgaria, bitterly estranged against the Serb, who was Russia's
  chief protege, and insensibly inclining towards Austria and, through Austria,
  Germany.</p>

  <p>Another result of the war was the loss of French prestige in Turkey. The
  Turkish Army had been reorganized and re-armed by the French, and on his
  failure the Turk naturally visited his resentment upon his French
  instructors. Here the Germans came in, and very shortly German officers were
  organizing the Turkish defences; a new entente had sprung up between Turkey
  and Germany, and favoured the great German project, then in course of
  fulfilment, of a railway across the Mesopotamian desert, linking up Bagdad
  with Berlin. Brought to its logical conclusion, this policy would eventually
  bring a railhead to the very frontiers of India, and the project had given us
  very considerable concern at the Foreign Office.</p>

  <p>In those stormy months I had very little time for paying visits, but when
  I went down to see my brother in the summer of 1912 I learned that Harry had
  left immediately on the outbreak of war, and was in Constantinople. This news
  came, suspiciously enough, from Lorrain, and when I taxed her she brazenly
  admitted that she was in correspondence with the "forbidden cousin," as we
  called him.</p>

  <p>"And why shouldn't I be?" she asked, a little defiantly. "Somebody in the
  family has got to be decent to him!"</p>

  <p>Very wisely I did not pursue the subject, but left the matter where it
  was. Her father knew, she told me, and apparently his silent disapproval made
  little or no difference.</p>

  <p>I was surprised and rather pleased, after the second war, and when I was
  deeply involved in dealing with that section of Europe, to have a visit from
  Harry on his way through London. He looked very brown and fit, and after the
  first greetings were over, in his jerky way he came to the point which was at
  that moment troubling me, and, I think, troubling every other man who took an
  intelligent interest in European politics.</p>

  <p>"Queer thing about the Turks," he said. "Did I ever tell you, how in my
  opinion the war which Italy forced on Turkey with the object of taking Tunis
  and that strip of the North African coast would lead ultimately to big
  issues?"</p>

  <p>I didn't remember. I have often had the impression that he had favoured
  Lorrain with a great deal more information and more news than she had
  confessed to me, and that in all probability he was confusing us, though that
  is hardly likely.</p>

  <p>He ticked the position off on the tips of his fingers.</p>

  <p>"First of all, we have some years ago Turkey fighting and defeating
  Greece. Then Italy steps in, takes the Turk's North African possessions and
  weakens the Turk to such an extent that the Balkan states can combine and
  finally smash him. They had him like that!" He put out his thumbs
  suggestively. "And yet they didn't sail in and finish him because they have
  the morality of brigands, and each was afraid that one of the others was
  going to get more out of the show than they did!"</p>

  <p>"How did you leave Constantinople?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"With a very sore head," said the Avon, taking the chair I pushed up to
  him. "Very sick of France, very friendly with Germany. I left the Russian
  Ambassador greatly alarmed at the project of this new German influence making
  itself felt."</p>

  <p>"The Turk has no reason to complain," said I. "He got off much lighter
  than he would have done if the Balkin allies had agreed amongst
  themselves."</p>

  <p>"They never will," he smiled quietly. "As for Bulgaria, she's seething
  with discontent, and naturally king Ferdinand is all for finding a solution
  to his country's troubles&mdash;in Germany. With the Young Turkish party now
  in control of Constantinople, tending in the same direction, there is a
  German streak running from Wilhelmshaven to the frontiers of Persia. I wonder
  how long it will be before&mdash;" he said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"War," was his startling reply. "All the conditions are favourable.
  Germany is building Dreadnoughts and super-Dreadnoughts to keep pace with our
  ship-building programme&mdash;Lord! what a mess it's going to be!" he groaned
  as he rose.</p>

  <p>"Are you returning to Norfolk?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm going back to organize an agitation to increase the number of
  our machine-gun detachments. Germany has four to our one, and machine guns
  are going to count in the next war."</p>

  <p>"But why should we be in it?" I asked. "We have no alliance with
  France."</p>

  <p>He turned round and stared at me.</p>

  <p>"You guarantee the neutrality of Belgium."</p>

  <p>"The Germans will never invade Belgium," I protested.</p>

  <p>Harry laughed, as though I had said something funny, and I was a little
  nettled.</p>

  <p>"Of course they'll invade Belgium," he said scornfully. "How else can they
  deploy their divisions? Practically the whole of Eastern France is barred by
  the Vosges mountains and on the north-east by the Ardennes. There is only one
  manoeuvring ground in the whole of Western Europe, and that is the plains of
  Belgium! The German would be beaten in the first month of the struggle if he
  didn't deploy through Belgium."</p>

  <p>"Break a treaty?" I asked. To me a treaty was a sacred thing.</p>

  <p>"How many have been broken in the past, by almost, every nation? There
  isn't a school history book that won't tell you that. Necessity knows no law,
  and it is vitally necessary, for the success of the German forces, that they
  should wheel their right wing across the Meuse."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I cannot take such a light-hearted view," said I. "A treaty
  is a solemn obligation, and I do not doubt that Germany will respect her
  written word."</p>

  <p>Young Avon smiled.</p>

  <p>"Fail, and jeopardize the future of seventy million people for a line of
  writing? My dear uncle, you do not know anything about war," he said. "Of
  course she will come through Belgium, and equally of course we shall be
  dragged into he war."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE MURDER</h2>

  <p class="first">I READ these notes that I have made in the early stages of
  the great and terrible conflict which overwhelmed the world, and Harry Avon's
  views seemed so false in ethics and in fact, that I had it in my mind to
  destroy them and to hide up, what I considered to be, his perverted view. But
  these chronicles are written that future generations may read, and I have
  left them substantially as I noted them down after each interview, and it
  will be for posterity to judge the accuracy of his conclusions. We cannot, in
  the midst of a great war, while the thunder of its cannon still reverberates
  in our ears, when we see the great plains of white gravestones that mark the
  resting-place of our dead, when around us we see the widows and the
  fatherless, the cripples and the men blinded and driven mad by war, we
  cannot, I say, judge fairly or accurately of first causes. It may be that
  Harry Avon was hopelessly wrong; but I must confess that at the time I was
  deeply impressed by his reasoning.</p>

  <p>He had made at least one convert. I met him one day in town with Lorrain.
  They had been to a theatre to see a play by Major du Maurier, called "An
  Englishman's Home," which, in my judgment, did a great deal to imbue in the
  minds of unthinking people a realization of the potentialities of war.</p>

  <p>Events followed so quickly that it seemed but a day between the conclusion
  of the Balkan trouble and the opening of the conflict. It was in the month of
  May, 1914, one Sunday night when I had been dining with James and his family
  at their house in Sloane Square, that the dreadful news came. Harry had been
  invited. I think that the advocacy of Lorrain had done something to temper my
  brother's violent and prejudiced view against our young relative. But so far,
  neither Hubert nor Stanley, who had got his commission in the Coldstream
  Guards, had been reconciled to what they called "his beastly socialistic
  views."</p>

  <p>It was a curious coincidence that as we sat at the table after dinner,
  James should raise the subject of a book he had recently read&mdash;a
  translation from the German. It was written by General von Bernhardi, and it
  dealt with what he called the next war.</p>

  <p>"A devilish clever book," said James approvingly. "I must admit that these
  German fellows are smart. Their espionage system is wonderful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Their espionage system," interrupted Harry, "is deplorable! I should say
  they have the worst intelligence department in Europe."</p>

  <p>That was the annoying thing about Harry: he invariably took the opposite
  view to the popular one, and generally was right.</p>

  <p>"And as for Bernhardi's book, it's full of the grossest miscalculations.
  For example, he thinks that, in the event of war with Britain, neither our
  Territorial Army nor our overseas forces would have the slightest effect upon
  the issue."</p>

  <p>"Nor would it," said Sir James gruffly. "The Territorials are very good
  chaps, and it's an amusing way of spending a Saturday afternoon dressing up
  like a soldier and doing sham fights and things of that sort, but they
  wouldn't be much use in war. As for the Colonials," (Harry always winced when
  James said 'colonial' but he groaned now) "I mean the soldiers from the
  overseas states&mdash;they're very fine fellows indeed, but what army could
  they put in the field?"</p>

  <p>"Half a million," said Harry promptly, "and probably more."</p>

  <p>James gaped at him.</p>

  <p>"Then in the name of heaven, how many could we put in the field?"</p>

  <p>"Between four and five millions; that is to say, ten per cent. of our
  total population."</p>

  <p>Here Stanley was moved by the arrogance of youth and the consciousness of
  his military calling to protest.</p>

  <p><a id="pic4"
     name="pic4"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1306061h-images/TBA4-image-4.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"What good would they be?" he asked. "It takes five years to make a
  soldier."</p>

  <p>Harry grinned.</p>

  <p>"Five years to make him drill; twelve months to make him fight," he said.
  "Unless my knowledge of the British people is at fault, you will be able to
  make soldiers quicker than you can equip them."</p>

  <p>It was at this moment that my brother's butler came in and told me I was
  wanted on the telephone. It is not very usual for me to be called up on
  Sundays but I went at once, and as I took up the receiver I recognized the
  voice of my chief clerk. He was evidently very agitated.</p>

  <p>"Is that Sir John Avon?" he said. "A dreadful thing has happened. The
  Crown Prince of Austria and his wife have been assassinated at Serajevo!"</p>

  <p>The news stunned me. Of course I was aware that the Archduke Ferdinand was
  paying a visit to the Serbian portion of his future empire with his heir
  apparent, and that he was accompanied by his wife. There had been threats to
  murder him, though one did not take those too seriously. And now the blow had
  fallen.</p>

  <p>I learnt the details of the crime in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said: "I will be at the office in half-an-hour."</p>

  <p>I went back to the dinner table, and I saw Harry's eyes on my face.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"The Archduke Ferdinand and his wife have been assassinated," I said, and
  he sat back in his chair and whistled.</p>

  <p>"This is the end," he said in a low, grim voice. "Nothing can stop
  war&mdash;it is the one excuse that Germany wanted. She will nudge Austria,
  and Austria will make the position of the Serbian Government impossible. Not
  all the talk in the world, not all the negotiations, can avert this
  conflagration."</p>

  <p>He spoke with the solemn tone of an oracle, and I shivered as I listened.
  His prophecies seemed almost inspired. I saw Lorrain turn pale and her
  anxious eyes go to her two brothers.</p>

  <p>"Not war?" she asked, in a voice little above a whisper.</p>

  <p>Harry nodded.</p>

  <p>"War and nothing but war: there is no alternative," he said, and got up
  from the table.</p>

  <p>There was a pallor in his face which was impressive. He stood looking at
  us, and yet looking through us, as though his extraordinary mind were running
  hither and thither, thinking and correlating facts.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the French are ready," he said, as though he were speaking to
  himself. "That is the keynote. If the French do not make not a spectacular
  invasion of Alsacce, but stand on the defensive until we are ready, we might
  win."</p>

  <p>He went down and got his car and drove straight away home, whilst I went
  on to the Foreign Office. The reports that came in the next morning were
  encouraging. The attitude of the Austrian Government seemed restrained and
  conciliatory. Belgrade had telegraphed its horror and regret, but not all the
  passage of telegrams could entirely wipe out the fact that the murder was
  undoubtedly organized by men who were well known in the city of Belgrade.</p>

  <p>Day followed day, and the calmness of Vienna was reassuring. I had many
  interviews with Edward Grey and found him extraordinarily clear-headed and
  sane about the affair. He was by no means certain that the crisis would pass
  and leave Europe where it was, but his hope, I think, was centred on von
  Bethmann-Hollweg, the German Chancellor, who, some of us believed, was strong
  enough to keep in check the militarist element in Berlin.</p>

  <p>On the Saturday following the murder, just before I left the office, I was
  told that a soldier wanted to see me.</p>

  <p>"What sort of soldier?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"A private soldier," was the reply, and, thinking it might be a message
  from the War Office, which was keeping closely in touch with events, I asked
  that the man should be sent in.</p>

  <p>Judge of my surprise when there walked into my big room Harry Avon, in the
  uniform of a private of the West Kent Regiment! Apparently he knew some
  officers in that distinguished corps, and had been recruited on the Monday
  previous.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear fellow, this is very precipitate on your part."</p>

  <p>"I want to get time to shake down before things get to a state when we
  shall have the whole of British manhood flocking to the recruiting offices,"
  he said. "I may, by a piece of favouritism, get my corporal's stripes in a
  month&mdash;fortunately I hold Certificate A: I took it at school, and with
  that I can get commission if an opportunity arises."</p>

  <p>I looked at him admiringly.</p>

  <p>"At least you have the courage of your convictions," I said, and asked:
  "Does Lorrain know?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've just left her. We had lunch together at a fashionable West End
  restaurant." He smiled mischievously. "The manager took a lot of convincing
  before he admitted me to his gilded hall, and I prophesied that, by this time
  next year, these gentlemen will be falling on the neck of any I man they meet
  in khaki."</p>

  <p>He had come, he said, to ask me to be a trustee of his will.</p>

  <p>"I have already anticipated your agreement, and the document was signed
  this morning," he said.</p>

  <p>He did not tell me how he had disposed of his money. I learned afterwards
  that he had left me a very considerable sum, and that&mdash;well, it would
  not be fair to Lorrain for me to say what provision he had made for her and
  her brothers.</p>

  <p>The interview was a very brief one, because he had to be back in barracks
  at midnight. He said he had a lot of things to do, arranging for his house to
  be run in his absence, and, in certain eventualities, to be turned into a
  convalescent home for soldiers.</p>

  <p>I had little time to think of Harry during the weeks that followed. The
  war clouds were gathering ominously over Europe, and the tone of the German
  Press left me in no doubt that she was behind the unknown ultimatum which
  would sooner or later be presented to Serbia. When that ultimatum was
  published, it sent a gasp of amazement throughout Europe. It was no less than
  a demand that Serbia should surrender those sovereign rights which are dear
  to every self-governing community, and submit her will to her hated enemy.
  That Serbia should submit to this was impossible, and those who prepared the
  ultimatum, which was telegraphed word by word and may have been shaped by the
  German Emperor and his advisers, knew very well that the conditions imposed
  would never be accepted.</p>

  <p>From the moment that ultimatum appeared, war was inevitable, though Sir
  Edward Grey worked with the energy of despair to find some alternative to
  war. The German mobilization plans were ready to be put into force at once.
  Russia, who considered herself the natural guardian of all Slavs, began her
  preparations, but the mobilization did not take place for some days
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>There is no sense in quibbling and quarrelling as to who mobilized first.
  It was inevitable that secret instructions anterior to mobilization should go
  forth as soon as a breach seemed unavoidable.</p>

  <p>The Germans had built a nest of railway lines to the very frontiers of
  Belgium, and the existence of these great depots, which could not possibly be
  excused on any other than military grounds, was well known to us. When
  mobilization was ordered, German troop trains began to move towards
  Belgium.</p>

  <p>War was actually declared against Serbia on July 28th, 1914. On August
  1st, at 7.30 p.m., Germany declared war upon Russia; the German troops,
  waiting on the frontier, invaded the neutral state of Luxemburg, seized the
  railway and established a base against France.</p>

  <p>In the meantime the gathering of German troops on the Belgian frontier
  caused the Belgian Government to demand whether Germany intended holding by
  her agreement to treat the country as a neutral state; and this question was
  submitted by Sir Edward Grey both to the French and to the German
  Governments. The French replied instantly in the affirmative, and indeed
  there was no reason why they should not, for a neutral Belgium would protect
  their left flank. Germany's reply was evasive. Sir Edward repeated his
  question, demanding a reply by eleven o'clock that night, German time.</p>

  <p>This was on August 4th, and by this time Germany had already demanded of
  the Belgians that they should remain neutral and allow them to deploy their
  forces through the country. On the day that Sir Edward asked for a German
  assurance that the neutrality of Belgium should not be violated, two German
  army corps, under General von Emmet, were already hammering at Liege; and
  that night British ministers waited in silence, hoping against hope that at
  the eleventh hour Britain would not be dragged into the war.</p>

  <p>No reply came, and as Big Ben struck midnight the Great War had begun for
  our people: a war which was to entail the most terrible sacrifices of life,
  which was to desolate a million homes and bring us to the very verge of
  extinction and ruin.</p>

  <p>"If," said Sir Edward Grey, "in a crisis like this, we ran away from those
  obligations of honour and interest as regards the Belgian Treaty, I doubt
  whether, whatever material force we might have at the end, it would be of
  very much value in face of the respect that we should have lost."</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; WAR!</h2>

  <p class="first">MANY of us will remember to our dying days those first hot
  days of the war, when our railway services were disorganized and train after
  train passed southward, crowded with cheering troops; young men in the very
  heyday of life who were going out to face a fearful death that we might live
  unmolested, untrammelled by a foreign conqueror. For myself, those first
  hours of war were hours of terrible solemnity. I think I was fortified by the
  presence of a girl who had so much to lose, and was in dreadful fear that the
  loss could not be averted. Lorrain had come up to my house to dinner that
  night&mdash;it was a holiday&mdash;and towards midnight she and I went into a
  church and sat down in that empty place, tenanted only by a few worshippers,
  and waited for the clock to strike.</p>

  <p>How magnificently our people met that hour of supreme peril! With what a
  resolution, what a calm courage! To-day, when the war is almost a memory, I
  recall that immense crowd of volunteer soldiers which gathered about Scotland
  Yard, waiting patiently for its turn to go before the doctor and pass the
  necessary examination which would admit them to the Army. To-day, when I meet
  some working man who annoys me, some driver of a lorry who obstructs my car,
  some person who is rude to me in the street, I never reply, for fear that
  unconsciously I may be saying something bitter to one of those heroes who
  offered their bodies as a living rampart between the enemy and our homes.</p>

  <p>The position on August 5th was this: our own army was beginning its
  mobilization, and an army of Germans had practically taken Liege, and there
  was no barrier to their progress across the Meuse. He was sending his army
  corps through Belgium, though his progress was necessarily slow, and made
  slower by the poverty of his military intelligence; for it was understood by
  German Army Headquarters, as I subsequently learned, that a British army had
  landed somewhere near Ostend. In point of fact there was nothing at Ostend
  more formidable than a strong detachment of marines, but whether the Germans
  knew or did not know this, it is certain that time was lost till the right of
  the advancing divisions was made secure from any possibility of attack from
  Ostend.</p>

  <p>In the meantime our troops were being transported across the Channel as
  fast as ships could carry them; the concentration was completed seventeen
  days after the outbreak of war: a remarkable performance, even with our own
  little army, which, it was generally believed, had been referred to by the
  German Emperor as "the contemptible little army of General French." I might
  say in passing that there is no documentary or authentic support for the
  statement that the German Emperor said any such thing. In point of fact, as I
  happen to know from a very authentic source, the Kaiser had warned his staff
  officers not to regard the British Army too lightly.</p>

  <p>By August 21st the British Army had taken up a position along the line of
  the canal from Conde in the west through Mons to Binche on the east, the 2nd
  Corps, under that brilliant general Sir H. Smith-Dorrien, being on the left,
  and the 1st Corps, under Sir Douglas Haig, on the right. The 3rd Army Corps
  had not yet arrived in France.</p>

  <p>At this juncture of affairs, when war was declared, Mr. Asquith had
  recalled Lord Kitchener, who was on his way back to Egypt, and asked him to
  take control of the War Office. Lord Kitchener had a name that was famous
  throughout the land, and his influence upon recruiting was a vital one. He
  was not, by any standard, a great general, his forte being organization, and
  his real value, as I say, his extraordinary personality, which had fascinated
  Britain since the days of the Sudan War.</p>

  <p>On Sunday, the 23rd, the battle opened, an attack being delivered in the
  main against the 2nd Corps, though the 1st Corps was also heavily engaged. At
  this time Sir John French, who was in command of the British troops,
  believed, as he had been informed by the French intelligence department, that
  he had only one cavalry division, and one, or at most two, enemy army corps
  before him. His troops were hardly engaged before he learned that there were
  three corps on his front, two of them actually engaged, the third moving to
  envelop his wing. Worse news than this came; for on French's right were two
  reserve French divisions and the 5th Army, and he had no news of what was
  happening to these until he learned that they had retired.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, the British Army had a few but very efficient aeroplanes, and
  the Field-Marshal was able to discover the real strength of the situation,
  and when this became revealed, he ordered an immediate retirement, and there
  began that Retreat from Mons which has become historic.</p>

  <p>All this news, however, did not come to us at once. We knew nothing,
  except a favoured few of us who had heard that there had been a heavy
  engagement and that our troops were retiring. It was a great shock to many,
  though how they could have imagined that our handful of men could have held
  up these superior forces, is difficult to understand.</p>

  <p>From time to time I had scraps of news and tried to piece them together.
  Harry, I knew, was in the thick of it, but what was his fate I did not learn
  till a staff officer who had come over from the War Office to consult with my
  chief, asked me if Sergeant Harry Avon was any relation. At first I had a
  qualm of fear that he might have been killed, but apparently some detailed
  news had come through from the Commander-in-Chief, and it appeared that Harry
  had, single-handed with a machine-gun, held up the German advance near
  Maubeuge for half an hour, allowing our troops to be extricated from an
  impossible position.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"His name was mentioned, so I suppose you'll hear more of it," he said,
  and congratulated me when I told him of Harry Avon's relationship.</p>

  <p>We heard from the other front. The Russian armies had broken into Eastern
  Prussia, and Berlin was so alarmed that it ordered the reinforcement of the
  eastern front by a corps which was withdrawn from Belgium but did not arrive
  in East Prussia until too late to be of service. There had been placed in
  command of the German troops a remarkable old man named General von
  Hindenburg, whose knowledge of the district was such that, by sheer
  manoeuvring, he was able not only to defeat but in a great part to destroy a
  superior number of Russian divisions.</p>

  <p>In France the Germans were moving rapidly towards Paris. General Joffre,
  the Commander-in-Chief, had, however, prepared a line of defence, whilst the
  commander of Paris sent a division out in taxicabs to attack the enemy in
  flank. Von Kluck, who was commanding the right of the German Army, discovered
  these forces on his right flank, and edged his corps over westwards to meet
  the new danger. In so doing he left a sensible gap between his own army and
  the army on his left, and General Foch, who was before him, saw his
  opportunity and sent his troops forward to the attack.</p>

  <p>The position was now so impossible for the German that he had no
  alternative but to retire to the line of the Aisne and the high ground behind
  that river. The Battle of the Marne has been glorified and described as a
  miracle, but though there was a general engagement, the retirement of the
  German, whilst it was forced upon the enemy, was voluntary in the sense that
  the German armies were not driven back, but decided to retire in order to
  re-establish the solidity of their front.</p>

  <p>The little British army was now exhausted, but their recuperative powers
  were extraordinary. I doubt if there was ever any army of Britain that was
  the peer of that small, compact force which, having marched and fought for
  two hundred and fifty miles, were able, in the shortest possible time, to
  return to the attack. Whilst the British were resting, preparatory to a hasty
  re-organization, I had my first letter from Harry.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Have you ever seen an army in retreat? It is not a
  terrible sight if it is a British army. I had a moment's chat with General
  Smith-Dorrien, who fought a magnificent battle at Le Cateau to check the
  German advance and give our men a little breathing time, and he said that it
  reminded him of nothing so much as a huge crowd coming away from a football
  match, and that, I think, just described the sight. All sorts of units were
  mixed up together. There was no question of marching in fours or in files;
  they just trudged along cheerfully, helping one another, turning back to
  fight under any strange officer that ordered them, as cheerfully&mdash;indeed
  with greater cheer&mdash;as they would have shown if these had been
  manoeuvres. There was no grumbling, no grousing; they were footsore and
  hungry, but cheerful to the last; and as they marched they sang a song called
  'It's a Long Way to Tiparary.' Will you get a copy and send it to Lorrain? We
  are in for a very stiff time. The Germans are in a strong position on the
  Aisne, and I doubt if we shall be able to turn them out for years! Please do
  not faint at the thought that the war will go on for a year or
  two&mdash;nothing is more certain than that; if we drift into a state of
  position warfare, we shall not be able to turn these fellows out of France.
  Some their regiments fought magnificently, but you can't really beat our
  Tommy&mdash;he is the most wonderful soldier in the world."</p>

  <p>It is almost impossible to record the history of that terrific combat in
  such a way as to show the great story in one picture. We were concerned at
  the Foreign Office, first with the entry of Turkey into the war, forced upon
  the Turkish Government as the result of Turkish battleships bombarding the
  Russians; and next, after the lapse of more than a year, the inevitable
  declaration from Bulgaria. She had grievances to redress, and it required no
  more violent change of face to link up with the Turks than it had been to
  fight with the Serbians.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"

         alt="Illustration"

  </div>

  <p>Mr. Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, recognized the danger of
  this Turkish alliance, and was all for bringing Turkish resistance to an
  immediate end. This could be done if the Dardenelles, a narrow passage
  connecting the Mediterranean with the Black Sea, were forced. The Straits
  were, however, protected by forts sited on the peninsula of Gallipoli; and
  owing to the lack of agreement between the military and the naval
  authorities, and partly due to the reluctance of Lord Kitchener to release
  the divisions necessary to co-operate, the landing which might have been
  effective on the Gallipoli Peninsula in conjunction with the Fleet, was not
  attempted until months afterwards, when, although our gallant troops,
  reinforced by Australians, secured a foothold on the land at an enormous cost
  of life, they were unable to carry the strong positions which the Turks held,
  and the Straits, heavily mined and impassable, remained closed until the end
  of the war.</p>

  <p>The conception was admittedly a great one, and had it been well timed, the
  attempt to reach Constantinople by sea could not have failed.</p>

  <p>The Russians had succeeded in reaching Warsaw, but had been checked. For
  all her enormous manpower, Russia was not able to afford the aid so
  desirable. She was ill equipped, and whilst her troops were of the bravest,
  her munitions were unfortunately quite inadequate to enable her to assist
  us.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, the position in France was becoming, as we called it,
  stabilized. A definite defence line extended from the North Sea, a little
  west of Nieuport, to the very frontiers of Switzerland. The French, at the
  outset of the war, had misguidedly marched into Alsace, and, after a
  preliminary victory, had been badly defeated and forced to retire to the
  Voages. That, then, was the position at the beginning of 1915&mdash;a state
  of stalemate, unrelieved by any great success on either side. The German
  fleet lay under its guns at Wilhelmshaven, whilst the real naval losses had
  been ours, for a number of our cruisers had been torpedoed by German
  submarines.</p>

  <p>The main fleet lay at Scapa Flow, a roadstead exposed to attack; and it
  was an anxious time for us all, and especially for those at the Admiralty. At
  the outbreak of war Lord Louis Mountbatten, a very brilliant sailor, had
  resigned as the result of some ill-founded criticism of his German origin,
  and his place had been taken at the Admiralty by Admiral Fisher, a brilliant
  but elderly man; whilst Admiral Jellicoe had replaced Sir George Callaghan as
  Commander-in-Chief of the Battle Fleet.</p>

  <p>One result of the Navy's vigil was to blockade Germany from the sea, so
  that her direct supplies were cut off from her, and she had recourse to
  smuggling such necessities as fats, copper and rubber through the neutral
  countries.</p>

  <p>In those dreary days my chief relief were the letters from Harry, some of
  which Lorrain sent on to me, and some of which came direct. He had been
  promoted captain at the Battle of the Aisne, and, by a miracle which would
  have been unbelievable in the days before the war, was now commanding a
  battalion in the battle line.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I'd like you to picture a dreary stretch of land, very
  flat and very featureless, the drab country being intersected by a number of
  bad roads, the crowns of which are paved with cobblestones; a light railway
  or two, across which a conveyance which is half tram-car and half railway
  train, plies a leisurely service. Something like Holland, with great
  windmills, innumerable waterways, canals, and little rivers&mdash;a squalid,
  sordid, uncomfortable country, dotted here and there with the headgear of
  coal-mines. You cannot get an idea at home of what the fighting is like.
  Picture this countryside, more undulating than usual, a hill covered with
  woods, a dim and blue background of trees; farmhouses dotted here and there;
  telegraph poles that stalk across the middle distance; a dilapidated railway
  with its rails twisted and wrecked and culverts shattered by dynamite; a row
  of humble cottages, where the peasants have been living, which is now a
  sandbagged fort, hastily painted a dull grey streaked with green by the
  engineers. Nothing else visible on the face of the earth; no sound of life or
  human beings, of soldier or transport or horse. And yet, hereabouts, are some
  fifty thousand men, and under camouflage&mdash;that is a new word which is
  becoming popular&mdash;and covers are guns and rifle pits. Suddenly, with
  only the warning of a furious cannonading, out of the earth spring a myriad
  grey coats...Watch them rush across the fire zone, dropping here and there,
  until only a handful reach the advance infantry trenches...Picture a wild and
  seemingly disordered scramble of khaki over the top, the flash and thud of
  bayonets, and the roaring yell as the infantry charge...We have left behind
  us the open character of the fighting of our earlier battlefields, and are
  now engaged, under conditions which are abominable. As we march up to our
  billets the landscape seems to be made up entirely of dead horses, cows and
  pigs which have been caught in the hail of shrapnel...We pass on our left a
  row of German dead laid out ready for burial in the graves which the peasants
  are digging."</p>

  <p>I have said that the German was incapable of understanding our psychology,
  and no better proof of this can be adduced than the air-raids which terrified
  but did not frighten, if that subtle difference can be realized, the British
  people. After the first raid by Zeppelins, Whitehall was blocked with men
  rushing to the recruiters. For the first time, the war had been brought home
  to them, and they answered in no uncertain voice. Nevertheless, although
  hundreds of thousands flocked to the standard voluntarily, and Lord Derby in
  Lancashire alone raised, not battalions, but divisions, it was clear that the
  tax upon our man-strength was too severe to be met by voluntary recruitment.
  More serious was our own lack of ammunition. A new ministry had been created:
  the Ministry of Munitions, to which Mr. Lloyd George applied that fiery
  energy which has distinguished him in all his public life. Factories were
  converted; new factories were built&mdash;one at Chilwell, by Lord Chetwynd,
  was perhaps the most important of all; and a new ministry was formed, Mr.
  Asquith resigning as Prime Minister, and Mr. Lloyd George taking his
  place.</p>

  <p>As I see the war in some sort of proportion, and seek to establish its
  values, particularly in regard to its conduct by the great political leaders
  of our time, especially Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd George, I would use the
  illustration of a relay race, where one carried the baton across rough,
  uncharted country, handing it to his companion, who carried it to the goal
  along a much smoother road.</p>

  <p>Oh, the delirium of those years! Italy's entry into the war, and her great
  advance against the Austrian line; Roumania's entry and martyrdom; and then
  the supreme crisis the revolution in Russia; the arrest, and subsequently the
  murder, of Czar Nicholas, and the arising of a new force: Bolshevism.
  Bolshevism we shall never understand until we realize that it was the attempt
  of an essentially eastern people to put into concrete form the idealism of a
  Western theorist.</p>

  <p>One night we had a very heavy air-raid, and I had been kept up till about
  two in the morning, and was about to go to bed when the door-bell rang and my
  valet told me that Miss Avon wished to see me. At the first glance of her
  white face I knew that something dreadful had happened.</p>

  <p>"Stanley has been killed," she said. "It was rather splendid: he led an
  attack upon a German machine-gun post, and Harry tells me he has been
  recommended for the Victoria Cross."</p>

  <p>"Was Harry there?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"We had a telegram from him to-night. We ought to have had it earlier, but
  the raid held up the delivery of messages."</p>

  <p>She was very brave and calm about it all, but the effect upon my poor
  brother was deplorable, and I thought at first the shock would kill him.
  Afterwards we learned that Harry's battalion had been fighting side by side
  with the Coldstream Guards. The Guards had been put in, as they always were,
  to recover a position which seemed irretrievably lost.</p>

  <p>We had no time for private griefs, however. The great German attack began
  in March, 1918, and it seemed that nothing could save us from annihilation,
  when the 5th Army had gone, and the German troops were pouring into what
  looked to be a gap that would separate the French from the British. Sir
  Douglas Haig, who had replaced Sir John French as Commander-in-Chief, sent
  the gravest news about our position. At such a moment, when the troops were
  depressed and whole divisions were in a state of confusion, the King went out
  to France, rode and walked amongst the exhausted soldiers, and by his very
  presence heartened them...A few months later began the great counter-attack
  which ended in the destruction of the German resistance, the abdication of
  the German Emperor and his flight into Holland, in which he was accompanied
  by his son, the Crown Prince. The Armistice was signed on November 11th,
  1918.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; THE AFTERMATH OF WAR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE war is very near to us, so near that it is impossible to
  gauge accurately the strength of our victory and the consequence of the
  German defeat. What we were to see was the old reaction which had followed
  the Napoleonic wars: the closing down of factories, the rapid increase of
  unemployment, partly caused through the taxations which, though they fell
  upon the monied classes in the shape of employers and leaders of industry,
  were to react almost disastrously against the working man. For if industries
  are taxed, less money is available for the extension of trade. A great
  corporation earning a profit of 100,000, which has to pay 40,000 in taxes,
  has that much less to employ in the extension of its business, the building
  of new factories, and the opening up of new markets.</p>

  <p>I have omitted, in my brief summary of the war, reference to one of the
  most important incidents, and one which finally decided the fate of
  Europe&mdash;namely, the coming of America into the war and the
  transportation to Europe of an enormous force, which, though it arrived too
  late to make its weight felt, was the moral decisive factor. For the presence
  of these troops, a large number of whom were untrained to the actual
  hardships of campaigning, enabled Marshal Foch, who was the
  <i>generalissimo</i> of all the Western forces, to release his jealously held
  reserves whilst American divisions fought most gallantly in the Argonne side
  by side with the British, before that line of defence which was named after
  General von Hindenburg, who eventually commanded the German forces.</p>

  <p><a id="pic9"

  <p>America had not only helped us with her enormous army and her limitless
  manhood reserves, but had loaned us huge sums of money, which had been
  borrowed from her people. And here I would say that there seems to have been
  at this time an impression that America had an immense national reserve of
  gold and wealth which she could lend her allies, and the loss of which, even
  if it were not repaid, could hardly affect her prosperity. This, of course,
  was a stupid error, for every penny that was loaned to Europe was borrowed
  from the little investors of the United States and had to be repaid to them.
  Moreover, the people of the United States gave us an extraordinary exhibition
  of altruism, for when the German submarines began their unprecedented attack
  upon British shipping, and the foodstocks of Great Britain became attenuated,
  the American people voluntarily rationed themselves and suffered
  deprivations, both in food and in coal, that we might not be defeated by
  hunger.</p>

  <p>The war left Europe with many problems to solve. By the terms of the
  Treaty of Versailles, France recovered Alsace and a portion of Lorraine,
  although Alsace at any rate had been a purely German province until it had
  been taken from them two hundred years before.</p>

  <p>The signing of the Peace Treaty did not end the fears of France. She was
  haunted by the fear that a great country numbering seventy millions of people
  would rapidly recuperate and in a short space of time would constitute a new
  menace against her security. The first object of the French, therefore, was
  not only to disarm the German but to make him incapable of recovering.</p>

  <p>We had established ourselves along the Rhine: the British at Cologne, the
  French and Americans farther south; but this arrangement did not altogether
  fulfil the desires of the French politicians, the leader of whom was M.
  Poincare. He aimed at the occupation of the Ruhr, with its immense mineral
  wealth and its industrial machinery, and, seizing the opportunity which the
  failure of the German to deliver certain supplies, in accordance with the
  Treaty, afforded, he sent forward French troops to seize the towns, and there
  was organized in France a separatist movement, the ostensible leaders of
  which were Germans.</p>

  <p>"The idea being," said Harry (we were sitting on the lawn of his club at
  Henley, watching the gay pageant of the regatta) "to create an independent
  buffer state between Germany proper and France. They think in Paris that the
  Rhinelanders are ready to proclaim an independent republic of their own."</p>

  <p>"And are they?" I asked, well knowing what the answer would be.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I should say not!" he said. "The Germans of the Rhine are bitterly
  opposed to the separatist movement, and although these rascals who are the
  so-called leaders of the separatists are working under the protection and
  with the approval of French troops, they are foredoomed to failure."</p>

  <p>It is no secret, I might remark in parentheses, that the British Foreign
  Office did not see eye to eye with the French Government in this agitation
  for a separate buffer state, and that the advance of the French into the Ruhr
  was bitterly resented in this country, and, partly because of the moral
  pressure exercised by the British Government, the French troops were
  withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"What is the feeling in Germany?"</p>

  <p>"It is very sour against France," said Harry, "and I think they have some
  justification. The French have sent their coloured troops to occupy German
  towns, and the behaviour of some of these men is insolent in the extreme. In
  the British area, British and Germans are working together in harmony; and
  although, naturally, the Germans resent having their conquerors quartered
  upon them and being under the domination of a foreign power, our people are
  very well liked."</p>

  <p>Germany was of course, now a republic. The Kaiser had abdicated before the
  signing of the Armistice and retired to Holland with his son, the Crown
  Prince (who was afterwards allowed by the German Government to return to his
  estate in Silesia). An attempt made by friends of Russia to establish a
  similar form of government to that which obtained in Moscow, had been
  ruthlessly suppressed. The leaders of the communistic party had been shot out
  of hand, men and women alike. Germany, in spite of its poverty and the
  extraordinary ravages which war had made upon its manhood, enjoyed a stable
  government which was ostensibly Republican, but which, Harry insisted, was
  largely Monarchist.</p>

  <p>"And it will never be anything else," he said definitely. "They have the
  king habit; and although the Republican flag flies over the Government
  buildings, it is the old Monarchist flag that is carried in processions
  without interference. Sooner or later Germany will revert to something like
  its old system of government. But the new Kaiser will be a constitutional
  monarch, and possibly the control of the army will remain in the hands of the
  Reichstag."</p>

  <p>"That will mean war," said I, but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Britain is the key which opens the door of havoc," said he, to my
  surprise. "If anything like a working arrangement can be reached between
  Germany and England, war is impossible. Does it not strike you that war would
  have been equally impossible if Britain had been more closely in touch with
  Berlin in August, 1914? It was because the Germans regarded us as potential
  enemies that they put all their fortunes to the test of war.</p>

  <p>"I am very fond of the French," he went on. "The world owes them a debt
  which we can never repay. But the French are a truly warrior people, and
  their history is that war has been the solution of all their problems since
  the days of the Roman invasion. You have to look at these things fairly and
  squarely, Uncle John, and honestly. We have to think, not for ourselves, but
  for the unborn generations who will come, who will be influenced by the truth
  or the falsehood of the records we leave behind us. We cannot jeopardize the
  future of our race by the mistaken sentiment of the moment.</p>

  <p>"There were only two things to do with Germany after the war," he
  continued. "One was to mobilize every American, Briton, Frenchman and
  Italian, walk into the country and destroy every man, woman and child. The
  other was to regard them as part of a great European family and try to live
  with them. Of course they will recover&mdash;you can't prevent that&mdash;and
  they will again become a great military factor&mdash;that is also beyond our
  power to avert. Recognize the fact squarely, and sit down and puzzle out a
  way by which wars may be prevented, and unity established. It isn't the act
  of a foolish or a wicked statesman, a stupid or an ambitious king, which
  makes war in these days; it is the sentiment, deep-seated in the national
  heart; it is the trend of opinion generally held. The <i>amour propre</i> of
  a nation is a much more important factor than any international incident upon
  which the war-makers seize as an excuse for arming. We came into the war to
  save Belgium and in honour of our obligations&mdash;that is true, though the
  German could not possibly have fought if he had not come through Belgium. But
  what really brought us into the war was an anti-Germanism provoked by the
  Emperor William's precipitate cablegram to President Kruger."</p>

  <p>I protested at this.</p>

  <p>"Think it over," said Harry. "Go back in your own mind and watch how this
  resentment against the Germans grew and grew out of those five unnecessary
  lines of writing. Remember, all wars are fought by little boys at school, who
  have grown up a few years, but still carry in their minds subconsciously the
  impressions they have received at their most receptive age. You cannot teach
  children that wars are unnecessary, because they spend four or five years of
  their lives learning the beneficent effects of war. But you can teach them
  that they are the kings who throw down the gauntlet, and the kings who pick
  it up. You can teach them that war, without strong national prejudice, is an
  impossibility, and that that prejudice is very often based on a clever lie
  put into circulation, innocently or mischievously, by men who, having loosed
  the arrow, have no conception as to where it will fall or what misery will
  result."</p>

  <p>I saw my brother that week-end, and obviously Harry had been to him, for I
  noticed an extraordinary change of viewpoint, and when he spoke it might have
  been with Harry's voice.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that he is the greatest Avon of all, because he is
  born soldier and a natural commander of men. He has the intelligence to look
  back for first causes. I feel bitter about the Germans, naturally," he said
  in a sad voice, and, remembering poor Stanley lying in a soldier's grave at
  Bapaume, I was silent. "And I suppose hundreds of thousands of other fathers
  feel as I. But a new race will be springing up, a new people will populate
  the earth, and it would be a sin and a shame to pass to them the virus and
  poison of our animosities."</p>

  <p>A few weeks afterwards Harry refused the offer of a safe seat in
  Parliament. He said he had no desire to go into Parliament, though he spoke
  very respectfully of our legislators.</p>

  <p>He told me a story about the King, which I feel must be placed on record.
  A great Eastern potentate who spends a great deal of his time in England, has
  a wonderful diamond worth 300,000, and it was suggested to him that the
  nation should buy this treasure and present it to the King, to be part of his
  Crown jewels. The Indian offered to contribute 100,000 of the subscription
  price, but first interviewed His Majesty to discover whether the project was
  to his liking. The King's answer was courteous but short.</p>

  <p>"Whilst there are over a million unemployed people in this country, do not
  come to me with any scheme for buying diamonds," he said.</p>

  <p>The situation in Britain after the war was rendered the graver by the
  continuance of a wartime measure&mdash;the dole. I talked with Harry about
  this system, and he pointed out to me that the dole was by no means a
  novelty.</p>

  <p>"Turn back the pages of your Avon history and you will see that in the
  days of William Pitt a similar system existed, only it was called poor
  relief," he said. "It is vitally necessary that, in a modified form, this
  arrangement should be continued, because it is our job to relieve genuine
  workmen who, through no fault of their own but by reason of some industrial
  upheaval find themselves without the necessities of life, a condition very
  often brought about by a change in the tastes of the people or the policy of
  the Government."</p>

  <p>When the news came from James that Harry had asked him for Lorrain, I
  cannot say that I was as surprised as James, who apparently had seen nothing
  of the growing affection between the two.</p>

  <p>They were married in Salisbury Cathedral, in that very building where the
  Avons had sworn their oath to keep a record of the "black men of their
  house," and went to America on their honeymoon.</p>

  <p>The day of my retirement from the Foreign Office came soon after, and it
  was with deep regret that I left the imposing building where I had spent many
  happy and fearful hours. I had seen the passing of many Foreign Ministers: of
  Lord Lansdowne, of Lord Balfour, of Sir Edward Grey, and of that kindly,
  earnest man who had come to office in such extraordinary circumstances, the
  first socialistic Foreign Minister who has ever sat at the head of the board.
  And a day or two before I left, it was my duty to make a survey of the
  existing world situation.</p>

  <p>Bolshevism had been established in Russia long enough to test its value.
  The system had its enthusiastic supporters and its more than violent enemies.
  And none seemed to realize that Russia and her ways are a law unto
  themselves, and that little more than two hundred years ago it was a purely
  Eastern country, where the women never appeared in public without veils, and
  the harem was an established institution. Had it not been Eastern, such
  rulers as Peter the Great and his half-mad successors could not have been
  tolerated. Russia has been everlastingly battling for an ice-free port, and
  her teeming millions, even on the outbreak of war, were not far removed from
  serfdom&mdash;and a drunken serfdom at that. Russia, mystical, fanatically
  pious, having contempt for her priests and faith in the message they carried.
  Russia, above all, so contradictory in principles that even her cleverest
  apologists could never translate her soul. How could she be anything but what
  she was&mdash;the happy hunting-ground for the extremists in religion, in
  sociology and in politics?</p>

  <p>Her influence had spread throughout the world, and yet, reviewing these
  manifestations carefully, I could not see that she had affected to any
  profound extent the life of the working people in any country. For throughout
  the ages there have been men of extreme views, and so it will be until the
  end of time.</p>

  <p>A little more than a year after their marriage, Harry wrote to me telling
  me of the happy event. I was on the Riviera at the time, and I must confess
  that the news he sent was a better tonic than the horrible medicine I had
  been taking for the relief of my rheumatism.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It is a boy," wrote Harry, "the blackest of them all! He
  has the Avon grey eyes and his hair is the colour of jet...What is his fate,
  I wonder? And when he grasps the family sword, and carries on the old
  tradition, against whom will its point be turned and for what cause?"</p>
