<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>15 MAY 1944</h2>

<p>THIS MORNING I said to Terry, 'I thought I heard guns through
the night.'</p>

<p>'Were you awake too?' she asked.</p>

<p>Even before she spoke, as soon as the words were out of my mouth
I was sorry I spoke, and hastened to say:</p>

<p>'That was funny, both of us lying quiet not to disturb the
other.' I knew by the way she looked at me that she was not
deceived.</p>

<p>'They sounded very near,' she said; 'in the direction of
Inverness.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't know,' I returned. 'With this east wind it's very
hard to tell how far away sounds are. I remember in
nineteen-eighteen we used to hear the guns in France, often on a
Sunday morning, if the wind was right, so near and clear you'd
think they were close by. We knew when a battle was coming on by
the noise, swelling out of the east like a heavy sea. Lord, what an
age ago that seems! We didn't know each other then, Terry. How old
were you? Seven? I was eight when the War finished, Gone eight, I
used to say, bigsy, you know, making a grown-up of myself. But I
can remember the guns and when there was fighting in the North
Sea&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I heard that too,' she broke in. 'It was always a rumbling
noise then, not distinct and separate like last night. Last night's
noise resembled the Fleet at gun-practice in the Moray Firth. You
know how we used to see the glare and flash in the sky before we
heard the sound of the guns. I saw fire in the sky last night, on
the horizon over there.'</p>

<p>'Wildfire,' I suggested. 'If it was, I hope we get this place
properly tight and snug before the weather breaks. You always see
wildfire when a storm's brewing in the hills.'</p>

<p>'I hope it was wildfire,' she said after a brief silence, and
then: 'I'm going to start spring-cleaning.'</p>

<p>I began to laugh and say something about Nero, but she
interrupted me angrily.</p>

<p>'You know how important it is for us to keep a grip on
ourselves,' she cried; 'even if we are fugitives in a
cave&mdash;all the more because of that. We daren't let ourselves
grow careless. It might be all right to lounge and laze just now
while the weather's good, but if we get into a slovenly way we'll
never get out of it, and by winter we'll be savages, dirty and cold
and demoralized. It wasn't to degenerate into savages that we came
here.'</p>

<p>'No,' I said moodily; 'we had a lot of good reasons, but they
don't look so good now. Och, Terry, don't heed me. I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have said that. I don't mean it really. Only when I see
ourselves making ourselves at home here, and settling down as if
for ever, I feel it's going to be for ever. That sets me wondering
what's happening, if anything's happening, or if we ran away from
nothing at all but our own imaginations.'</p>

<p>'The noise wasn't wildfire,' she answered. 'I wish I could find
an occupation to keep your mind busy, boy. I've got my job thinking
out meals and how to economize our stores&mdash;why don't you
write?'</p>

<p>'Write!' I exclaimed. 'Good God, is that what you'd like me to
do? Didn't you hear the guns last night, don't you know the whole
world's in a flame? What'll I write, now; fairy-tales maybe for
cities drowned in gas, or shall I scribe moralities on the rock
with a nail for future generations to wonder at my wisdom?'</p>

<p>'You needn't be so hasty to take me up wrongly,' she protested.
'What I was going to say was that you could write an account of the
things that happen to us, about our coming here and living here. If
we get out of hiding other folk might be glad to know how we lived,
and if no one cares except ourselves, we shall be glad of something
to keep us in mind of the past.'</p>

<p>'Shall we need written mementoes for that?' I asked bitterly.
'Oh, I think you could find a better occupation than that for me,
Terry, something useful, like counting the clouds, if I'm too idle.
Or I could take a hammer and break down rocks to dust&mdash;or go
to the succour of my king and country&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush! hush!' she entreated. 'We came here because we thought it
was right, because we would not be bullied into doing wrong or
assisting at wickedness. If we commence to doubt that&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What cures doubt?' I demanded.</p>

<p>'Faith,' she replied simply, 'and my work in this place. Do you
think, Hugh, it's easy for me to plan spring-cleaning when I know
the world's in agony?'</p>

<p>She turned to carry stuff from the back of the cave to the
entrance, now sunlit and warm, for the clouds had passed from the
morning sky.</p>

<p>'That will soon dry out any damp,' she said with satisfaction.
'Look, Hugh, do you remember when we made up these?'</p>

<p>She showed me some notebooks and scraps of paper.</p>

<p>'What is it?' I asked. 'The lists we made! listen to this,
Terry, "syrup, treacle, lard"; how much of that have we? What a
hope we had to imagine we'd fetch everything we needed to make life
comfortable into this place. It's a wonder we didn't mark down a
kitchen range.'</p>

<p>'We didn't quite bring everything we hoped to bring,' she
agreed.</p>

<p>'It seems years ago, in another world. It was in another world.
We were children playing at desert islands.'</p>

<p>'Oh fine Crusoes! We didn't rightly believe that war would come.
Catch! they'll be useful for lighting the fire some morning when we
forget to dry heather. As if we were plotting a picnic! Lovely
picnic!'</p>

<p>'Has it been so very dreadful, Hugh? I'd never dream of burning
them. The excitement we had when we made them! and you'd come
running every now and then to tell me something we'd
forgotten&mdash;opening the kitchen door and spoiling my
baking.'</p>

<p>'Aren't you going to burn them?' I asked. 'I thought you were
spring-cleaning and getting rid of rubbish.'</p>

<p>'Must you go on hurting me?' she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>'I didn't mean to hurt you,' I said miserably. 'Oh, Terry, I'm
sorry.'</p>

<p>'It's all right, now,' she replied. 'I felt low for a minute. I
thought I might be a bother to you, or getting on your nerves.
You're not angry because I want to do spring-cleaning, are you,
Hugh?</p>

<p>'I knew this was bound to happen,' she said a little later. 'We
were too exalted these past weeks.'</p>

<p>'It was such fine weather,' I said, 'and now there's an east
wind.'</p>

<p>'It was lovely weather; but Hugh, we must keep a note of what
happens.'</p>

<p>'For the foxes to read when they've their den to themselves
again?' I asked with renewed bitterness.</p>

<p>'For ourselves to read, and other people, when this is all
over.'</p>

<p>'What if it's never all over and we crouch here till we die, and
the world goes back to savagery&mdash;have you thought of how it'll
be when we grow too old to skulk and hide and make shifts and stalk
deer for to-morrow's dinner? Shall we come to thrive on grass and
heather, or simply starve&mdash;what heart can I have for
writing?'</p>

<p>'If you were crouching in a trench, Hugh, in wet and mud, and I
was crouching in a cellar waiting for the sound of aeroplanes, and
bad news&mdash;you'd have a certainty that we'd both crouch there
for ever&mdash;and help the world back to savagery. If you're
unhappy here and hankering to go, you hurt me more by staying. I'm
not going with you. I can't chop and change my mind every time
there's water in the wind. I came here and here I stay until the
world changes its mind, for I'll not change mine.'</p>

<p>'What is there to write,' I asked, 'except the days of the week,
and you mark that? Nothing happens; I haven't a pencil&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have pencil and paper too,' she began in a matter-of-fact
voice. But her voice trembled and she exclaimed, 'I hope nothing
ever happens!' and then she commenced to laugh and cry alternately,
saying, 'Hugh, I couldn't bear to lose you, I couldn't live without
you, I'd sooner be dead. You won't leave me ever, will you? I don't
care what happens to the world if I have you.'</p>

<p>I suppose I cried too, for the civilization that brought us to
exile had first unfitted us for the life of outlaws. When that May
storm was past we stood together in the mouth of the cave. The wind
had fallen and the sun shone, altering the tumbled desolation round
us from the appearance it bore while the east wind blew. Nesting
grouse called in the valley, and an early deer calf, high in its
lair in a corrie, lamented its hunger and its absent mother.</p>

<p>'If we could sleep winter through&mdash;' I sighed.</p>

<p>'We have all summer to make ready in,' Terry answered. 'We'll
manage without sleeping, Hugh. Haven't we peats and bog-fir and a
store of matches?'</p>

<p>'What am I going to write?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Write,' she bade me, 'how we saw war coming. And war came.
Write that we would not be militarized nor suffer the shame and
injuries people would put on us for hating war. Tell how we left
our house by night. Soon we'll have enough grouse feathers to make
a feather-bed, and our peats are ready for stacking&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes!' I cried, infected by her enthusiasm; 'and we made stuff
to pickle eggs, and built a wall at the end of the cave&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A million things to write,' she said. 'Here's a pencil; put it
all down every single thing we did.'</p>

<p>So I took a notebook in one hand and my telescope in the other,
and slung my little rifle over my shoulder in case a grouse or hare
came within range since we could not afford to let slip a single
chance of getting food, though it was breeding-time and I was loath
to kill. When I had spied to make sure that the country was vacant
except for ourselves and birds and beasts I sat down in the lee of
a great stone, warmed and illumined by the midday sun, and began to
recall how we came into the hills, while Terry put water in a basin
to clean the rocky cavern where we hid.</p>

<p>It was strange, but as I tried to recall the past which was so
near in point of days, I found that the past, distant and near, was
faint and scarcely to be recalled. Things no more than a month old,
the fret and confusion of our escape which I thought was indelibly
marked on my memory, proved suddenly as insubstantial and dispersed
as the puffs of mist which float across a sunlit morning hill,
dappled by clouds and sun. I could remember many times when Terry
and myself said, 'We'll never forget this to our dying day,' and
the fact of the event which made us speak so was clear enough in my
memory, but I could not feel it. These old events seemed like
things I had been told, and heard with a vagrant mind.</p>

<p>I looked round the wild empty scene; it had its terrors, winter,
and storm, sudden cliffs and green bogs, but they were not such as
fretted the humanity we had fled from; no sign of man or man's
handiwork save a distant fence and burnt patches of heather on the
moor was there to remind us of the man-made horror we had left
behind us. Yet a mere month ago we were the fools of rumour, a prey
to whispers, racked by fear and loathing. To-day the sun shone. We
lived in the remote world which is not divided from men by miles
alone; a greater distance than the rough hill barriers divided us
from our kind; the callous earth, unchanged in war and pestilence,
occupied time as if there were no men, and we lived there, in that
strict country.</p>

<p>The wind abating to a breath lulled me. Even the brief
unhappiness of the morning, which owed to the east wind, faded into
the past, and I should soon have been asleep had not a movement on
the hill-slope facing us taken my eye. I had reached a state of
continual unconscious vigilance. Quite automatically, with my mind
still turned backwards, I took my glass from its case and rubbed
the lenses with my handkerchief and looked towards the facing hill.
I saw a herd of deer, twenty or thirty stags with the new horn just
visible, milling uneasily. They rushed now in one direction, now in
the other. The wind though light was steady. It was impossible they
could have seen me at the distance. I had not moved enough to
attract their attention and I had taken care to blacken the brass
of my telescope so that it should not shine in the sun and betray
me. Once, long ago, I had been saved from a gamekeeper who tried to
catch me poaching because I saw his telescope gleaming in the
heather, and it taught me a lesson. Anxiety commenced to replace my
beatific calm, until I heard Terry speak. She was standing at the
door of the cave shaking out a deer-skin.</p>

<p>'Isn't it the loveliest lovely day!' she cried.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I retorted, 'what on earth are you doing, standing
there? Don't you know to be more careful? Lie down and keep quite
still.'</p>

<p>It was amusing to see the sudden change that came on her face,
and the haste with which she flung herself on the ground, not even
waiting to make sure that the place she chose was dry or smooth.
She lay for a few seconds in absolute silence. Then she raised her
head with exaggerated caution to peer about her, dropping her head
almost as soon as she lifted it.</p>

<p>'Ostrich!' I murmured.</p>

<p>'Can I come up, Hugh?' she whispered. At my nod she crawled and
dragged herself to where I waited.</p>

<p>'Did I do right?' she inquired anxiously. 'Is there any one? Was
I bad? You were only giving me a fright!' Her startled eyes
reproached me.</p>

<p>'All the deer in the country were watching you,' I stated.</p>

<p>She breathed her relief and sat up laughing.</p>

<p>'I thought for certain some one had seen me. My heart came into
my mouth. What would we do if it had been a man, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Leave here and find another hiding-place,' I told her
grimly.</p>

<p>'Leave our cave! We couldn't do that, after the work we've done.
What a fright I got. My heart's going like a jakey mill. It doesn't
matter for deer.'</p>

<p>'It might, Terry. They should be lying at peace just now, and if
a gamekeeper saw stags running away from this direction a few times
he'd soon grow suspicious. It's not the deer seeing us that matters
but other people seeing the deer. Lie down and let them
settle.'</p>

<p>'I should be working,' she protested feebly. 'What a gorgeous
day! Who'd imagine there was trouble in the world?' She crouched
low in the heather.</p>

<p>'Och, no need to lie so close as that,' I laughed. 'So long as
you don't go moving abruptly there's no fear. Stags haven't very
good eyes and the sun's against them. That's a pretty noticeable
jersey you're wearing.'</p>

<p>'Don't you like it?' she asked, wide-eyed. 'I thought it suited
me.'</p>

<p>'You know, Terry,' I continued, 'the biggest danger we have to
contend with is that we'll become too contented here and give up
all thought of the future.'</p>

<p>'I like being contented,' she returned.</p>

<p>'It's not easy to believe that men are killing each other,' I
went on.</p>

<p>'How is the diary going?' she asked. I showed her the blank
pages of the notebook.</p>

<p>'Terry,' I said, 'when we were so miserable, only a month past,
I thought I'd never escape remembering.'</p>

<p>'It was an unhappy time, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'I'd never like to go through a time like it again. But Terry,
it's as if it never happened for all I can feel of it now. Like a
dream, or a tale in a book, or old gossip. I can scarcely believe
there was a time when we weren't here. This country seems the only
reality, and you can't feel with your heart that the affairs of men
are important; it's hard to believe there are men, in a country so
empty, so self-sufficient, as this.'</p>

<p>'A woeful dream, if it was a dream,' she whispered. 'A dream
that murders men. Maybe this forgetting defends us.'</p>

<p>'Against&mdash;madness,' I took her up soberly. 'We were walking
on a thin edge, Terry, when we were so uncertain and divided in our
minds.'</p>

<p>'We were lucky,' she said. 'A great many couldn't have lived
here, even if they had the opportunity. If you hadn't learned to
poach&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If we hadn't been poor&mdash;' I went on. 'It's queer to be
lucky by force of hard circumstances. If we hadn't been forced to
poach, and dig bog-fir, and make shifts because we hadn't money to
buy meat and coal and comforts we couldn't have lasted a week
here.'</p>

<p>'You'd imagine things were shaped for a purpose,' she agreed.
'It was complete chance that made us find this cave. A
thunderstorm&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And bad temper,' I said, and laughed.</p>

<p>'I remember finding it; I remember as if it was yesterday,' she
said in a ruminative voice. 'Oh my, we were wet and cross and
miserable! The midges almost ate us alive. When was it,
nineteen-thirty-two, twelve years ago.'</p>

<p>We had gone fishing for pike on Loch Coulter, a tarn which lies
a mile off the road between Dalwhinnie and Laggan Bridge and now
shines beneath us to the east of our home. In the afternoon a
thunderstorm came over. We hauled our boat ashore and walked up a
gorge westwards in the direction of Ardverikie Forest and the high
hills, looking for shelter and a place where we could kindle a fire
and boil our kettle. Each boulder that tempted us to halt had
another more tempting shelter-stone a few yards above it. We were
at that stage between dry clothes and sopping when the pelting open
seems preferable to a refuge which merely slows down the rate at
which one grows wet and we clambered dismally from one inadequate
covert to another up the steep north side of the ravine. I think
there is iron in the cliffs which overhang that slope. Flashes of
lightning dazzled us, so near we heard them crack like whips, and
thunder reverberated amongst the peaks with scarcely a pause. Under
that great sound the rising streams grumbled and rain beat on the
earth.</p>

<p>A cloud of midges drove us half frantic and we climbed higher to
escape them, though we carried them with us, through heather two
foot long, over screes and gravel slides. We were soaked to the
skin long before we discovered the cave, beneath a bulge of cliff.
It was not strictly a cave. An immense slab of rock had fallen from
the precipice. At the foot of the cliff it tumbled inwards to lean
against the parent mass from which it broke away, making a long
narrow tent open at both ends. Rubble had accumulated along the
ridge. Heather took hold in it, and tough grass interspersed with
tiny rowan trees wove a matted thatch which kept out the rain. It
was dark and cold in the cave but since we had found what we were
searching for we were perversely determined to make use of it in
spite of the fact that we would have been warmer, and could not
have become wetter, in the open.</p>

<p>The storm passed and we crawled out of the cave to sun ourselves
and view the scene.</p>

<p>'Would this be one of Prince Charlie's caves?' Terry wanted to
know.</p>

<p>'He passed this way to Benalder,' I told her, 'so no doubt it
would be a Prince Charlie cave if people knew about it.'</p>

<p>'But why don't people know?' she continued. 'I'm sure there are
dozens of places far more remote and wild than this and you can
scarcely get near them for hikers and sightseers.'</p>

<p>'No one comes this way,' I explained, 'not even a gamekeeper.
There's very little game; too many ravens and foxes and wild cats
in this tangle of rock, and eagles from Benalder hunt here. Look,
over there, under the Farrow, you can see the head of the Durc,
where the eagles nest. Besides, it's a sort of dead corner with
narrow angles of half a dozen moors and forests meeting. Each angle
by itself is too small to be worth shooting. As for hikers, there's
nothing majestic or romantic here, nothing but empty
desolation.'</p>

<p>'I like it,' she declared. 'Well, we have our cave in No Man's
Land, Hugh. What a place to hide in! like the Macgregors had, for
desperate outlaws!'</p>

<p>'In summer,' I agreed. 'What are you looking for?'</p>

<p>'Things. Rock-drawings and flint arrow-heads.'</p>

<p>'Fox's dung more likely, and stinking bones.'</p>

<p>'Don't be cruel, Hugh,' she retorted. 'Now if you walled up one
end the cave would be very snug. I'm sure people have lived in much
worse places.'</p>

<p>'What food would there be?' I asked scornfully. 'You can't grow
things here. What about the snowdrift? Were you thinking of
flitting up here, Terry?'</p>

<p>How bitterly our jests reproach us when the thing we mocked
comes to pass. I answered myself eleven years later, in 1943, when
war was in all our mouths, and daily rumours shook the world. We
had never revisited the cave. We had spoken about it only once, to
one man, a stalker who lived near our house and came often on a
winter night to play draughts and recall the war in France where he
had fought for four years. But wherever the conversation began, it
always ended with Duncan telling us that we were degenerate
compared with our ancestors.</p>

<p>'You don't require to talk to me, Hugh,' he declared
dogmatically one evening in the summer of 1943; we were sitting
before our house smoking and watching dusk hide the village of
Newtonmore.</p>

<p>'You know as well as I do that folk to-day couldn't live on what
made their fathers as strong as giants,' he went on vehemently.
'Take any man in a town and put him out here in the hills to live
by himself and he wouldn't last a week. A week! not two days.'</p>

<p>'That's not fair,' Terry argued. 'You can't take a man in a town
and compare him with country folk of old.'</p>

<p>'Take a man in the country, then,' Duncan persisted. 'Take
myself, take Hugh. If we were forced to live by our own efforts,
how'd we thrive? It stands to reason we couldn't do it. Our senses
are blunted. We depend on a multitude of people to make our clothes
and food and tools for us. We have noses that can't smell, ears
that are deaf&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Nevertheless we have intelligence,' I stated.</p>

<p>'Brains don't keep you warm,' he declared.</p>

<p>'But they do,' I went on. 'And though we haven't the noses of
deer nor the eyes of eagles, we hunt deer and capture eagles. All
the same, you're asking too much, Duncan. Why, your very wild
beasts, your deer for instance, can scarcely survive a winter, a
bad winter, amongst these hills without artificial feeding. You
give them bruised oats and Indian corn, don't you?'</p>

<p>'They're degenerate too,' he retorted.</p>

<p>'It's comparatively simple for men to live the savage life or
like Robinson Crusoe in tropical fertile countries, Duncan,' I
continued. 'Speed and strength and alert senses wouldn't avail a
man much if he were flung out into the Grampians to live by what he
could kill and grow. He'd die, pretty soon, however savage and
undegenerate he was.'</p>

<p>We drifted into discussing how long one could survive the
climate, the cold and hunger, of the mountainous north, if one were
left entirely to one's own devices for food and shelter, clothing
and fire. We agreed that without a great many tools and stores of
clothing and such things as salt, one would die soon.</p>

<p>'And when your ammunition was all used up,' Duncan jibed, 'where
would you find shelter?'</p>

<p>'There's shelter waiting in a cave in the rock above Loch
Coulter,' I said. 'With a little work it could be made warm and
tight. There are tons of peats and fir roots waiting to be dug just
beside it. You could learn to use a bow and arrow. You could catch
pike.'</p>

<p>'How would you avoid scurvy?' Terry asked. 'Would you dig a
garden? Where would you get seeds? As far as I can see you would
require pots and pans and dishes and needles and thread&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And a furniture removal van,' Duncan laughed.</p>

<p>We laughed with him. How easy it was to make a joke then. To
laugh now is to raise apprehension in our minds, for so many things
that we smiled to think on have come true, have come true and no
jest.</p>

<p>'Trust the housewife,' I lamented. 'If ever you think of living
the savage life, Duncan, consult Terry.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't think it's impossible,' she protested. 'It would be
a dreadful life, but one could live. After all, Hugh, we ourselves
require very little to keep us alive except clothing and flour and
salt, and we could manage with less. We grow vegetables, we dig
peats.'</p>

<p>'If living's all,' I said.</p>

<p>'If living's all.'</p>

<p>I used to think that these years of rumour, when war loomed,
could never be remembered save with pain. Yet as I regard that
decade, to-day, I wonder that I ever endured them, not because they
were unhappy, but because they were futile and wearisome. I feel
that custom alone made us live amongst the fears and murmurs of
storm, and deferred our escape.</p>

<p>We started to speak once more about our cave in the autumn of
1943.</p>

<p>'You were in France,' I said to Duncan. 'You've seen&mdash;' I
paused as a new thought came to my head. 'Duncan,' I said, 'did you
know&mdash;did you ever know that you killed any one?'</p>

<p>He turned his dark-lined melancholy face towards the horizon of
the Monadhliahs and kept silent until I began to think I had said
what I should not.</p>

<p>'Once,' he said, in a low voice, 'the Jerries were coming over
in the dawn, but light enough to see the sights of your rifle, a
surprise attack, no guns, no noise, nothing but them&mdash;and
us.'</p>

<p>He paused a moment.</p>

<p>'You know how it is when you've lived with a gun in your hand as
I've done,' he appealed to me. 'The sights come in line afore you
know it&mdash;I had a bead on a Jerry. He was dead, Hugh, as sure
as God I had him dead like the hind I got last week, before ever I
pulled the trigger. I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it.' His voice
grew harsh.</p>

<p>'Likely some one else did,' he said.</p>

<p>'Not you,' Terry whispered.</p>

<p>'Would you go back?' I asked, after a while. 'Yes?'</p>

<p>'Yes. We'd not be asked,' he said in heavy tones. 'We'd be
conscripted. Well,'&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders,&mdash;'every
man has it coming to him some time.'</p>

<p>'Conscripted? Good God!' I cried, 'would you go for that? They'd
call me up amongst the first. I wouldn't go.'</p>

<p>'It's easy to say that now.'</p>

<p>'Why should you be called up, Hugh?' Terry inquired in a
strained voice.</p>

<p>'Oh, having been in the Terriers.' I avoided her eyes. 'I think
you swear to take up arms in defence of your king and country.'</p>

<p>'You'd go?' Her voice had the horror of death.</p>

<p>'We wouldn't be asked,' Duncan explained.</p>

<p>'Christ, I wouldn't go,' I said in a rage. 'No, nor I wouldn't
be flung in jail and beaten and abused, neither. I'll tell you what
I'd do, I'd take a rifle and plenty of ammunition and hide amongst
the hills, and if they wanted me they could come and take me, but
not alive.'</p>

<p>'Back to your cave, Hugh,' Duncan said.</p>

<p>'Any place would do me,' I rushed on. 'Oh, I'd fight all right,
I'm no pacifist when it comes to defending my own right, but I'll
not fight in any bloody stupid war. War's not fun any longer; it's
murder, and I'm not a murderer.'</p>

<p>'You'd be a lot safer and more comfortable in the army, Hugh,'
Duncan declared. 'You might get a cushy job. Better than lying out
on the hill, cold and hungry, scared of every sound and move.'</p>

<p>'Half an hour ago you were praising the men of old for lying out
on the hill,' I told him.</p>

<p>'They could do it.'</p>

<p>'So can I, and so I shall,' I answered wildly. 'I saw as much of
the army as I want and I've heard enough of war from you to know I
won't take part in it. Better starve and shiver than be a
frightened slave.'</p>

<p>When Duncan went away Terry said, 'I didn't know you'd been a
Territorial, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'I was a stupid young fool,' I told her shortly.</p>

<p>'But why?' she wanted to know. 'It's not the sort of thing I'd
imagine attracting you.'</p>

<p>'I was hard up and a crowd of us fancied the holiday. You get
five pounds for attending the summer camp.'</p>

<p>'My little mercenary! Were you a good soldier, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'No, I was not. I don't want to hear more about it. I told you I
was a young fool.'</p>

<p>'How in the world did you let yourself be disciplined?' she
persisted.</p>

<p>'I didn't,' I admitted wryly. 'It was all so damned stupid. It
revolted me. After all, I was good material. I could shoot, I had
hit living moving things, which was more than most of the other men
had done or would ever do. I had trained eyes, I knew how to take
advantage of cover. But because I didn't wear my kilt just so, and
polish my buttons properly, the best they could do with me was make
me clean out lavatories, shovelling filth to learn the art of
war.'</p>

<p>'Poor Hugh!'</p>

<p>'If there was any sign of intelligence in the business a man
could take pride in doing it well, even though he knew it was a bad
business at the best. But to charge in a bunch over open country
with fixed bayonets and horses galloping, in the year
nineteen-twenty-eight, as if the Great War was a myth! If I had a
rifle with decent sights I could have killed most of the whole
army. Duncan uses an army .303 for the hinds; they're fine weapons,
dead true and practically flat up to a couple of hundred yards. He
put on leaf sights. All you have to do is flick a leaf up or down
when you're changing your range. That's not difficult enough for
the army. The army doesn't want good, simple, workman-like sights.
What's not good enough for killing deer is quite sufficient for
defending your life and your country. And that's only one example
of how much they learn from experience. Maybe wars are justified
sometimes. They used to have a sort of justification before they
became too big and dreadful for any justification. Justified or
not, they're a stupid way of settling things, and as far as I ever
saw, stupidly run.'</p>

<p>'They'd call you up?' she asked a little later.</p>

<p>'Right away,' I agreed.</p>

<p>'I think you'd go.' Her voice was harsh.</p>

<p>'I would not.' I was angry with everything, even with her.</p>

<p>'You say that now. When the pipes begin to play and all your
friends to leave&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And all the neighbours to point at me and the little boys to
throw stones at me&mdash;say it, Terry! God in Christ, don't you
think it's difficult enough already for me to believe I'm right?
Must you make it worse, disbelieving me?'</p>

<p>'It's going to be war,' men said in the winter of that year.
'War,' I said, when Terry heard the whispers and the words which
swelled through our quiet valley. She turned her back on me and
walked to the window and stared out over the valley, white from the
black Spey's edge to the far scarp of the Monadhliahs.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I implored, going to her and turning her to face me.
Tears ran down her white cheeks like rain. 'Terry, you mustn't
grieve; my dear, you mustn't grieve.'</p>

<p>'So many men to kill and kill and die, what makes grief quiet?'
she cried wildly.</p>

<p>'If I could see, if I could see clearly!' I cried. 'I've no
doubt it's easy for some folk to believe that war's wrong. All the
instincts I ever got are for trouble, and intellectual persuasion's
cold comfort when it's against one's instincts. Oh, Terry, I don't
think I could bear to live in this country, where we know everyone,
where we are friendly with every one, if war came, for I'm not
going to fight, and there'd be nothing but contempt and mockery for
us.'</p>

<p>'People have changed since the last war,' she declared without
much conviction.</p>

<p>'Do you believe that?' I asked. 'Do you believe that the people
who beat and jailed pacifists in the last war will be any kinder in
the next?'</p>

<p>'No,' she said, and then, 'Hugh, what are we going to do?'</p>

<p>'If only I could see&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They shan't take you,' she said fiercely. 'We'll go away from
here. To suffer humiliation, to be a criminal in the eyes of every
one&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Even myself. Where can we escape that?'</p>

<p>And in a little time the dark future became the present.</p>

<p>'They won't shame us,' I said harshly. 'We're not their clowns
to beat and spit at. I'll take you to your people, Terry.'</p>

<p>'And you, what will you do?' she asked aghast.</p>

<p>'I'll go where they won't get me; or if they do, it'll cost them
blood.'</p>

<p>'Hugh!'</p>

<p>'If you'd rather me be flung into prison and labelled a coward,
because I won't be involved in murder and outrage&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'll go too.'</p>

<p>'Better to hide with the fox,' I went on drearily.</p>

<p>'I go where you go,' she said.</p>

<p>'Have you forgotten what Duncan told you?'</p>

<p>'I forget everything except that I won't leave you. Hugh, would
you really send me away?' she asked, trying to laugh. 'Who'd mend
your clothes, and wash the dishes, and tell you where to find
things? Oh! oh! my heart will break.' She wept and sobbed in my
arms.</p>

<p>'Hush, hush, my love,' I besought her. 'Don't you understand?
I'd be a fugitive, hiding from all the world in the roughest hills,
listening for footsteps in every wind, starting at my
shadow&mdash;'</p>

<p>She shook her head violently.</p>

<p>'I can hide too, and skulk in the rocks,' she said. 'I'm not
afraid of anything except losing you...</p>

<p>'I'm all right now, Hugh,' she went on. 'I'm sorry&mdash;for a
minute the world was dark, no light in all the earth, nothing but
dark, dark, fearful dark. We must be calm! We must make plans, and
be ready. Could we really live in that cave, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'It would be rough&mdash;' I began.</p>

<p>'Who cares for roughness!' she returned angrily. 'I'm not so
weak that I must be nursed, Hugh, and kept from hearing the truth,
like a fool or a child.'</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, Terry,' I said humbly. 'Other people have lived in
caves, hermits and robbers and fugitives from tyrants&mdash;what
fools we'll feel if there's no need to go.'</p>

<p>'What does it matter, then? You know as well as I do that war is
coming.'</p>

<p>'You don't believe that I'm a coward?' I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'I don't think so, Hugh,' she replied with a pale smile.</p>

<p>'To be killed is nothing so dreadful,' I went on, 'if a man can
see a just cause for dying. I think I could suffer
pain&mdash;mutilation&mdash;'</p>

<p>'For God's sake stop!' she cried in a shrill voice. Her eyes
were wild and her face was haggard.</p>

<p>'It's this madness, this war, it kills and kills, and when the
killing's done, all that it accomplishes is to set the stage for
more.' I could not stop. I could not cease from speaking and
tormenting myself with horror.</p>

<p>'How much money have we?' she asked with an effort to control
her speech.</p>

<p>I looked at my pass-book.</p>

<p>'Fifty-three pounds,' I said.</p>

<p>'I don't think we should let our minds prey on things,' she
said. She drew a deep breath. The colour returned to her cheeks.
'We believe that we are doing right. We aren't willing to be mocked
and ill-used and made the butt of fools and ruffians for doing
right. Isn't it simple?'</p>

<p>'We should be willing&mdash;' I said.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'We must arrange, we must think out the smallest details,' she
continued. 'We have fifty-three pounds to spend.'</p>

<p>'I'll buy as much ammunition for the .22 as my permit will let
me have,' I declared. 'It won't be wasted at any rate, even if we
stay at home.'</p>

<p>'Stay at home!' she broke in. 'We'll be leaving our house! Hugh,
I never thought of that! we were happy in it.'</p>

<p>So we began to make our plans, to write down lists of what we
would require, if we were to live in hiding, in the hills, out of
reach of our enemies. The occupation of planning our life, away
from the hazards and ills of common life, freed us to a certain
extent from our preoccupation with these ills. While we were making
lists of food and tools and clothing the threat of war receded a
little, so that when our lists were completed, and we were in
imagination already escaped, the immediate necessity for escape was
no longer there to urge us to action, though Terry was anxious to
begin buying those things we needed most.</p>

<p>But I grew loath, as time wore on and rumours became a
commonplace of our lives, to spend our money against a contingency
which might never arise.</p>

<p>'I have a feeling there won't be a war,' I argued when Terry
reproached me. 'Surely people have more sense by this time of day.
Besides, war doesn't come out of a clear sky. We'll have warning in
ample time.'</p>

<p>'So will other people, and prices will rise,' she said. 'Have
you bought your ammunition?'</p>

<p>'Yes. It's not like flour and sugar and such perishables. It
will keep indefinitely and one always finds use for it.'</p>

<p>'How much?'</p>

<p>'Five thousand rounds for the .22, all my permit allows. Five
hundred for the .303. I had to pay through the nose for that, since
I haven't a permit.'</p>

<p>We put off buying provisions until spring came. Our fears were
slowly allayed, not only by the apathy which comes when one has
made ready to face a difficulty which fails to appear, but also by
a changed tone in the world's affairs.</p>

<p>'And all our worry and plans were wasted,' I said to Terry in
early March. 'I'm going to begin digging the garden.'</p>

<p>'Not wasted, Hugh,' she reproached me. 'The fate that makes our
worry vain is too happy for grudging.'</p>

<p>'I am almost sorry we aren't to go,' I went on, teasing her. 'We
would have enjoyed being cave-dwellers.'</p>

<p>'Oh hush, Hugh!' she cried. 'I won't let you speak like
that.'</p>

<p>I started to dig the garden and to buy seeds. On the third of
April we went fishing on Loch Ericht. We brought a nice basket of
trout home in the evening.</p>

<p>'I'll light the stove if you clean the trout,' Terry told me.
'Turn on the wireless until we hear the weather report. If it's to
be fine to-morrow we'll go for a picnic to Fortwilliam, maybe. I'm
longing for the sea.'</p>

<p>'Terry!' I shouted, when I heard the first words the loudspeaker
gave forth. 'Terry!'</p>

<p>She came running from the kitchen with the frying-pan in her
hand. We stood in front of the wireless, as if we heard our doom
spoken by its inanimate voice. We were on the brink of war. The
nations were mobilizing. War, war, war. Across the continent we
heard that sound. Cheering crowds, hoarse orators, marching feet,
drums and babel.</p>

<p>'Shut it off,' Terry said. It was there still.</p>

<p>'I never dreamt of this; that it would come to this,' she
breathed.</p>

<p>'I should have known!' I cried in an agony of self-reproach.</p>

<p>'We must see how much we have in the house,' she said. 'I'll go
out immediately and buy everything I can get.'</p>

<p>'I doubt if you'll get anything,' I told her. 'We'll be rationed
right away. It's too late to get money from the bank. Why did I
delay?'</p>

<p>'Some one will cash a cheque, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'What are we going to do, Terry?'</p>

<p>'Do? what we made up our minds to do. What else?'</p>

<p>'We counted on stores and tools.'</p>

<p>She went out to return in an hour with a burden of small
parcels.</p>

<p>'I got a little here and there,' she said breathlessly. 'The
place is mad, Hugh, bonfires, shouting, guns going off&mdash;'</p>

<p>We sat at our door until late, until after midnight, surveying
the village with its bonfires, man's funeral pyre.</p>

<p>Two days later, on the fifth of April, Terry brought in an
official envelope from the post.</p>

<p>'I won't, I won't!' I cried in a rage.</p>

<p>'Let's sit down and think matters over calmly,' Terry said.
'What&mdash;what does it say?'</p>

<p>I tore the envelope open.</p>

<p>'It gives me two days,' I answered. 'Two days!'</p>

<p>'And after that?'</p>

<p>'Well, if I don't appear&mdash;' I made a motion to indicate
manacled hands.</p>

<p>'We must go at once,' she said.</p>

<p>We went through the house, picking out all we counted we'd need,
and reading through our lists as we searched. By nightfall the
kitchen floor was piled with parcels and tins and boxes and bundles
of clothing. The house already wore a gutted look. In the dusk I
could see Terry's pale face, drawn and weary, but with eyes that
showed no yielding to weariness or doubt. I brought our baby car to
the door.</p>

<p>'We'll load as much as we can into the car, Terry,' I said, 'and
take it up by the Glentruim road until we get as near as possible
to Loch Coulter. Then we'll dump the stuff and I'll carry it to the
cave while darkness lasts. You'll come here again with the car.
To-morrow you'll go to Kingussie, anywhere you can buy food.
To-morrow night at ten I'll be waiting in the same place as we'll
find to-night.'</p>

<p>We were but young in stealth. As we drove along the Spey,
towards Loch Coulter, the silent night was full of ears that
harkened to our passing. We laboured up the hill from the Spey, by
Cattlodge with its crofts and staring windows and human folk in
another world from us. It was midnight when our second journey
ended, and dark, dark.</p>

<p>'I'll be waiting here for you to-morrow night,' I told Terry.
'Go home and sleep, my dear, you'll need all your sleep.'</p>

<p>'Oh, my dear!' she cried, 'how can I leave you here alone! Hugh,
Hugh, this dreadful night&mdash;'</p>

<p>'This night makes us free,' I murmured, little feeling free.</p>

<p>I made heavy progress with my loads through the mire and stones
to Loch Coulter. Stumbling and falling, saving my precious luggage
at the expense of my hands and knees, I went back and fore,
half-asleep though I kept a straight course. We had not thought
about making the parcels easy to carry; we had omitted to wrap
things that would break in blankets or clothing to protect them. I
had even forgotten to leave food unwrapped and easy to get at. At
length cock-grouse, whose wings I had heard many a time when I
disturbed them in the gloom, commenced to hail the approach of day.
Our stuff was hidden safely amongst heather in a jungle of young
birch at the head of Loch Coulter. It was impossible to carry it to
the cave in darkness and when light came I was too tired to lift
another burden. I dragged myself up the hill to the cave with a
couple of blankets and a dry loaf. I was too tired to eat. I was
too tired to sleep. Yet I did not wake. The moist dark cavern
lightened from the east, and the sun rose, and reached the south,
and went down, while I lay waiting.</p>

<p>Terry came to the meeting-place at ten o'clock.</p>

<p>'We must hurry,' I said. 'We have to get rid of the car. I hope
it won't be as dark as it was last night. I put my feet in every
hole between here and Loch Coulter. Could you drive the car to
Dalwhinnie and up the side of Loch Ericht until you find a steep
place, and run it over into the loch? That would hide it safely.
Then walk back here and wait for me, if I'm not already
waiting.'</p>

<p>'You're wet, you're shivering,' she said. 'When had you food
last? I'm not going to leave you, Hugh; I'm staying with you.'</p>

<p>I was loath to send her away from me again, and I agreed that we
could hide the car in a gravel pit for two or three days. There
might be things on it which would prove useful, once we had time to
look about us.</p>

<p>Although we had less to carry this night we were both dead-beat.
The nervous excitement and the anger which had goaded us so far
were failing; we trudged in leaden gloomy silence, lacking energy
even to speak when we tripped over tussocks, or walked into bogs.
Yet, bereft of elation and anger as we were, weariness itself
seemed to carry us on. Like men in despair who may as well struggle
forward as yield, we laboured on our journeys; the dawn came in
grey and misty; we could hear, but not see, water flowing to the
loch, and waking birds.</p>

<p>'The mist is lucky for us,' I told Terry when our final load was
carried to the head of the loch. 'If you go and make a fire beside
the cave I'll fetch up as much as I can before the mist rises.' She
preferred to help me so that we could rest without worrying because
all our belongings were not in safety. The fortunate clouds kept
low until ten o'clock, enabling us to complete our task. At length
we could see an end to our flight. I huddled over the fire, wrapped
in blankets, while Terry spread out my wet clothes to dry. She
commenced to hunt through the bundles on the floor.</p>

<p>'Rest, Terry,' I besought her.</p>

<p>'We must have food,' she returned, and gave me the kettle. I
filled it with a cup at the pool beside our cave which was fed by
trickles of water down the rock face. Terry put fat in the
frying-pan; she fried a piece of steak, with onions, and two eggs,
and a slice of bread. So we ate our first meal in the cave. When it
was done I scattered the fire. We rolled ourselves in blankets and
fell asleep on the ground.</p>

<p>It was a heavy yet troubled sleep I enjoyed, with many dreams of
which vivid fragments persisted into my waking mind. We wakened at
the same time, in the mid-afternoon. I turned to find Terry
watching me with a bewildered childish expression on her face.</p>

<p>'What is it, Terry?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I had a dream&mdash;' she began, and hid her face in her hands
for a moment. When she took them away the baffled look had gone
from her eyes. They were content. I went out carefully to our pool.
She washed herself in the basin of water I brought, and brushed her
hair, talking the while of what we must do. We made a tally of our
goods, piling them as neatly as possible against the inner wall of
the cave so that we could move freely.</p>

<p>'How long it seems since yesterday,' Terry remarked as we
worked.</p>

<p>'You got a good few things,' I returned.</p>

<p>'Yes, at a price. I had to beg for everything. I went as far as
Inverness. And oh, I worried about you!'</p>

<p>'Poor lassie,' I murmured.</p>

<p>'Then Duncan came. I dared not let him into the house. He would
have known something was wrong if he saw it. He's been called up.
He kept on asking where you were. Of course he saw the car at the
door. I'm sure he thought you were poaching.'</p>

<p>These were the things we brought with us.</p>

<p>Of clothes, two pairs of shoes besides the pair she was wearing
for Terry and two spare pairs of boots for me. We had agreed that
it was possible to make garments out of deer-skins if need be, and
we had brought nitre and alum to cure skins, but we could not hope
to make shoes which would stand wear amongst the rocks and in the
heather. We had not grudged to buy the very best. I generally wore
shoes, but we decided that boots would keep me drier when I was out
hunting food, and that they would save my stockings.</p>

<p>Tackets and rivets and cobbler's twine, and a stout needle to
repair our boots and shoes.</p>

<p>A good leather coat each; Terry had a sude jacket as well and I
a leather jerkin.</p>

<p>A couple of knitted tams for Terry; two caps and a sou'-wester
for me. When we bought our footwear and the ammunition we were
afraid our money would not be sufficient to buy new clothes so we
determined to use only such as we had in the house. The .303
ammunition cost me six pounds, and the 5,000 rounds for the .22
cost almost eight. We paid practically ten pounds for boots and
shoes which left less than thirty pounds to spread over all our
other requirements. Of course it proved ample, and we could have
bought more, if I had taken Terry's advice to budget exactly and in
time. Terry had bought some warm woollen underclothes for herself.
When we came away we wore as much as we could to make our parcels
less bulky. Terry wore two pairs of stockings, her leather coat and
the sude jacket, a jersey and a knitted blouse above her
underclothes. I was wearing a khaki shirt, two pull-over jerseys
with long sleeves and polo collars, a grey plus-four suit, the
jerkin and the leather coat.</p>

<p>Over and above what we wore we had two spare jerseys each; Terry
had two Harris tweed jackets and two extra skirts and six or seven
pairs of stockings; I had a light strong jacket of cotton and wool,
an old tweed jacket, eight pairs of stockings, two pairs of
corduroy breeches, a pair of shorts and three khaki shirts. With
the exception of the dark brown breeches all my clothes were greys
or checks which harmonized with the hill.</p>

<p>We had packed our pockets with small things, needles and thread
and several ounces of wool for darning; scissors and a ball of
strong twine. Terry produced a set of knitting needles.</p>

<p>'When our knitted things wear through I'll unravel them and
reknit them,' she explained.</p>

<p>'If we stay long enough to wear what we've got, it means being
here for years,' I said.</p>

<p>'Clothes won't last so long here,' she answered.</p>

<p>We had three double blankets, a ground-sheet, and two dark army
blankets to spread over the ground-sheet, underneath us.</p>

<p>Of equal importance with our clothing were our weapons and
tools. I had taken great care that they should be good. I had a
B.S.A. single shot .22 with Martini action which had often killed a
hare at nearly two hundred yards. It had leaf sights for fifty, a
hundred, and two hundred yards. I made sure that I got non-fouling
rust-preventing ammunition for the .22. The barrel would never
rust, nor would it require cleaning. Only too late, when I lifted
the .303 from the heap of our stuff, did I realize that I had not
brought oil or a ramrod to clean it.</p>

<p>The .303 was an old long Lee-Enfield. I had 500 rounds for it,
and I had filed away the noses of the steel-jacketed bullets to
make sure that they would spread and kill.</p>

<p>I had a good telescope in a leather case and a pair of cheap
binoculars.</p>

<p>I brought also a good sheath-knife for bleeding and skinning
deer, and a small oil-stone to sharpen it.</p>

<p>We had fifty rabbit snares all ready made up, and a roll of wire
to make more snares.</p>

<p>A hundred yards of flax line for catching pike in Loch Coulter.
Treble hooks for pike. Fly and bait hooks for trout; fifty yards of
silk line for trout, a gaff, and a net. A spool of artificial
gut.</p>

<p>We had a seven-pound axe with a spare handle, a small axe with a
hammer head in reverse; files to sharpen them.</p>

<p>A small saw. Cotton rope from Woolworth's. A spade and a kitchen
shovel.</p>

<p>Our food was mostly packed in biscuit-tins which we had sealed
with brown paper and paste against the damp. We had half a
hundredweight of salt in tins. We were worried about salt; it was
essential, it was difficult to keep dry, and when it was gone we
had no way of getting more. We therefore brought what seemed to
ourselves a ridiculously large quantity. It did not appear so large
when we began to reflect how useful salted meat would prove.</p>

<p>The same quantity of flour. Two stones of sugar, to be used
grudgingly. Two stones of oatmeal for oatcakes. Without fresh milk
we did not relish porridge.</p>

<p>We knew we could get plenty of fat from the deer we killed; we
brought only two pounds of roast fat and a pound of lard.</p>

<p>Two pounds of baking-powder, a pound of baking-soda, two dozen
tins of unsweetened condensed milk and two dozen tins of sweetened.
Ten two-pound jars of home-made jam, the remainder of what Terry
made on the previous year.</p>

<p>Six pounds of tea, a pound of coffee as an occasional luxury. A
stone of salt butter in an earthenware jar. A stone of split peas.
To make the beginning of our stay more pleasant Terry had bought
six tins of fruit, a box of water biscuits, two dozen fresh eggs,
ten pounds of ham in half-pound parcels; she bought them at a dozen
different shops; two pounds of frying steak, a stone of carrots, a
stone of onions and two loaves of bread. We had a small bag of
turnips left over from what our garden grew, and a bag with a
hundredweight of potatoes, which almost broke my back when I
fetched it to the cave.</p>

<p>We had bought enamelled dishes for picnics in Woolworth's long
ago, and we brought them. We packed them in a small bath which
would be useful for washing dishes and clothes. We had three
soup-plates, three mugs, two small enamelled basins, two good china
cups from our own cupboard, four knives and forks and table-spoons
and tea-spoons, a ladle and two wooden spoons.</p>

<p>We brought good pans, of cast aluminium or iron, to stand rough
usage. We had a large cast aluminium frying-pan and an iron
stew-pan, a four-pint aluminium kettle and a gallon iron kettle, an
aluminium tea-pot, an iron griddle for baking, a deep iron pan to
make soup or for roasting.</p>

<p>A small barrel, packed with tools, would hold water, if there
was a drought. We had also a large galvanized iron pail to carry
water.</p>

<p>We brought four towels and ten pounds of soap in bars, and an
old cotton sheet for washing dishes or making bandages. I had a
roll of surgical tape and iodine and a jar of vaseline in my
pocket. A bottle of whisky completed our medicine chest.</p>

<p>Amongst the things we forgot to bring were nails, and a wedge to
split roots. These at least were missed almost at once. Before we
lived long in the cave we discovered many other things we should
have taken. But I had alum for skins and saltpetre to make match
for flint and steel, if our store of matches ran down.</p>

<p>It was the commonplace necessities we found ourselves most apt
to forget. I remembered four pounds of tobacco, but I forgot
matches. When I found eight dozen boxes amongst the other stuff I
recollected that matches were not on our list, even on the list we
made in the easy winter time when we played at planning our life in
a cave.</p>

<p>'You did remember matches,' I said to Terry. 'If we hadn't
matches! The one essential and I forgot all about them.'</p>

<p>'Thank Duncan,' she replied. 'When I saw him, he asked for a
match; there wasn't one in the house; I flew to Newtonmore and
bought all I could get.'</p>

<p>'We were lucky,' I said with a great breath of relief.</p>

<p>Before night we knew all our store. It seemed a very haphazard
collection; we had not reckoned how long we expected to live in the
hills, nor suited our purchases to each other so that our
necessities would last the same length of time. We were too tired
to think. Terry took a sharp stone and scratched on the inner wall
of the cave&mdash;</p>

<p>April 7, 1944, and behind the figures she scratched a deep</p>

<p>I</p>

<p>'What's that for?' I wanted to know.</p>

<p>'To keep track of the days, We'll make a mark for each day.'</p>

<p>Then we slept again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>21 MAY</h2>

<p>WE DO NOT intend this account of our life in hiding to be a
strict diary. Days have occurred since we reached here whose
passing requires no fuller commemoration than the mark Terry draws
every morning on the rock wall of our home. Doubtless many more
such days will come to us. Moreover days and hours and the
conventional units of time are becoming meaningless. Time is no
longer the inflexible system of equal spaces that it was while we
lived with our fellows.</p>

<p>For two days after we reached the cave we were spent. We wakened
to make food. We slept when we had eaten; like swimmers who have
barely escaped with their lives and lie on the shore of the flood
that almost swept them away and do not care whether the waters
against which they struggled in despair now drag them back, we were
overcome with lassitude of mind and body. Freedom, hard-won, tasted
stale in our mouths. We savoured nothing, neither our success nor
food nor sleep. The dreary waste on which we looked, when we
troubled to go to the open air, assumed a hateful aspect.</p>

<p>We revived gradually and painfully. In our hurry to be gone from
our house we had had no time to reflect. We were driven by goads
whose wounds, scarcely felt when they were inflicted, rankled and
festered in these hopeless hours. War and our harsh necessity, the
fate of the world, vexed our thoughts and planted venom in our
minds.</p>

<p>A very simple emotion finally ousted our discontents. We
commenced to be ravenously hungry. No meal satisfied us long.
Hunger wakened us when without it we would have slept and dozed out
entire days. On the morning of the third day Terry said:</p>

<p>'We have only enough meat for one other meal, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'Fry it for breakfast,' I bade her. 'Oh, I'm stiff and sore.
There's a rock here we must do something about. It gets me right in
the small of the back.'</p>

<p>'But that leaves us nothing for dinner,' she protested.</p>

<p>'I'll get something,' I answered.</p>

<p>'But it's broad daylight.'</p>

<p>'I don't care. I'm too hungry to care.'</p>

<p>I killed a grouse on a hillock right underneath the cave. Warm
as it was we plucked it; Terry stuffed it with oatmeal and chopped
onions and roasted it for four hours on a fire of turf. In spite of
the long cooking the grouse was tough.</p>

<p>'We mustn't let this happen again,' Terry said severely. 'We
must pull ourselves together, Hugh. Don't burn the feathers, boy,
they may come in useful.'</p>

<p>We have recalled our reckless carelessness on that day many
times, killing a grouse in broad daylight and cooking it for a
whole afternoon on a smoky fire. We were so hungry that the world
might overlook us and we would not have heeded.</p>

<p>The chances were all against our being seen, even if there had
been any one in the neighbourhood. We were absolutely screened from
above. The cliff bulging over the cave, hid most of the gorge as
well as our refuge from any one looking down from its summit. The
cave itself lay in a hollow between two ridges of flat slatey
boulders. Thus on the west, where we made our fire, we could crouch
unseen from every direction except directly opposite on the other
side of the ravine. The sun shone full on that face for most of the
day, lighting it so plainly that we could distinguish the least
movement. It was so precipitous that a man coming into it would
spend most of his time watching his footing, and he could spare
scanty attention for our hillside. Beyond Loch Coulter the moor
extending in a mossy expanse had only one practicable path which it
was easy for us to watch. As for the smoke of our fire, we
purposely heaped on smoky fuel one evening and went down into the
gorge to find how noticeable it was. The smoke blended so well with
the cliff behind it that we distinguished the one from the other
with difficulty though we knew where to look and what we were
looking for.</p>

<p>Our next care was to survey our cave. This den, for as yet it
deserved no better name, was twenty-two feet long. The opening at
the west end was ten feet wide at the base and eight feet high.
From the west end to the centre the cave kept these dimensions, but
from the centre to the other end it was much smaller. The leaning
slab of rock which composed the outer wall had cracked at the
centre of its length, probably because of the curve in the cliff
and fallen in a little. So the cave bowed inwards from the centre
until the east exit was a narrow aperture something over five feet
high and three feet wide at the base. Of course, the cave was
roughly triangular throughout its length.</p>

<p>Our first problem was to decide which end we should close and
which should be our door. The arguments in favour of an entrance at
the west end were plausible and numerous. The east opening, being
the smaller, would require less work to close it, and a fireplace
could easily be built in it. The west entrance would give us plenty
of light, whereas if we went to the great labour of closing it we
should make the cave almost pitch dark. It was difficult to creep
in at the east end without hitting one's head against a jagged edge
of rock. And finally, the west end looked forth on high and rugged
hills whose soaring peaks were never seen without some exaltation
of spirit, whereas the eastern view was drear, grey, flat and
immeasurably depressing whenever a cloud went over the sun.</p>

<p>In fact all our wishes were for the west door, with hills and
the sunset before us, and it required strong reasons to make us
even consider the merits of an east door. They were prosaic merits.
Obviously the larger the door the greater the draught it must
admit. We dare not let summer cheat us, we must not prefer light to
warmth. The prevailing wind in this country was west or south-west.
It brought most of the rain; east winds though bitter were dry.
Snow storms came from the south. The break in the rock would help
to deflect the weather from the narrow east entrance. We expected
that it would be easy to make a door for the east opening. And
since we meant to build a fireplace in the cave it was wiser to
build it at the broad west end where Terry could move about freely
when she was cooking. Finally, a small entrance could be
camouflaged; it was unlikely to attract attention; it was only a
few paces from the east end of the cave to our water-pool, a grave
consideration in winter. 'The cave will be dark all the time,
Hugh,' Terry said when we came to a loath decision about the door.
'We should have brought candles.'</p>

<p>'We'll not be living inside much except for meals and when we
sleep until bad weather comes,' I replied. 'People used to make
candles of sheep's tallow. I wonder would deer-fat serve the same
purpose? Of course we have bog-fir to make torches but they're
smoky and bothersome.'</p>

<p>'We should try for a stag shortly,' she went on. 'I think it
would be a wise idea to salt some venison before we commence
working on the cave. It'll be a nuisance and a hindrance if we have
to interrupt our work and break up our time hunting for food. Can
we salt meat just now, Hugh? Will it keep?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly,' I assured her.</p>

<p>I was out before daybreak next morning. The wind was gentle and
steady from the west. I put twenty bullets for the .22 in my
pocket, slung the rifle and the binoculars over my shoulder, made
sure my knife had a keen edge, and left Terry to light a fire while
I clambered eastwards under the cliff, meaning to circumvent the
rocks and come out on the top of the hill above our cave where I
was sure I'd find deer grazing their way back to the forest. I had
not travelled more than a quarter of a mile when I became aware of
half a dozen beasts approaching by the shore of Loch Coulter. They
advanced slowly but steadily, and I supposed they had been down on
the moor all night, eating the moss crop for which they are so
ravenous in spring when the new horn is growing, and were returning
to the hills and safety for the day. I had dropped immediately I
caught sight of them, and when I made certain they had not seen me
I looked about me for a way of retreat; if they continued their
course they must inevitably wind me and disturb every other beast
within miles. I was lying on a gentle convex slope from which I
could neither go back nor forward. When I turned my cheek to the
west the wind blew gently on it; the deer were bound to scent me; a
grouse made a terrific clamour beside me, and I cursed its noise
and the unlucky chance which brought the deer.</p>

<p>They still came ahead, delicately skirting the marsh at the end
of the loch. A big yellow-coated stag led them. He had lost one
horn and he carried the other with the utmost care. When he came
amongst the birches above the loch I could see him sidestepping
branches and nursing his lone horn through the thicket. Light began
to dawn more clearly. Three smaller stags and a hind and a
three-quarter-grown calf followed him. I thought how admirably the
calf would have suited our needs. Again I cursed the grouse which
dinned incessantly; to my astonishment the deer paid no heed either
to the grouse's warning or my wind which ought by now to have
reached them. They climbed sedately towards me. Now one, now
another bent his head to crop a tempting morsel of grass. The calf
lolloped in the rear, skipping and dancing aside from imaginary
obstacles. I thought he must be in good heart and fat to caper so.
The brutes continued uphill against all the laws of their kind,
straight into my wind. When they were some three hundred yards
distant I loaded the rifle and got out my glasses and trained them
on the birch trees out of which the calf was emerging. The miracle
might continue and bring them within range. Then the motion of the
wind in the trees told me the reason why the deer kept their
course. The branches could be seen waving uphill, against the west.
I realized I was lying on the edge of dead wind, and the breeze
behind me was met by other currents sweeping round the hill from
the gullies above. When the stags were a hundred yards beneath me
some instinct, or a whiff of my scent, arrested them. They halted
in a bunch round their leader, all except the calf who came forward
with youthful impatience and stared directly at me. He lifted a
hind leg and turned his head to lick himself, presenting his neck
and shoulders to my view. I aimed carefully at the juncture of his
head and neck, for as he stood his heart was a doubtful target, and
the neck if properly struck is as fatal as the heart. I heard the
bullet strike, and saw him wince. Somehow that moment seemed
tremendously important, as if success in this first venture
symbolized prosperity for the future. When I saw him run a few
yards downhill I knew I had made no mistake. He fell in a heap. His
eyes were glazed before I reached him.</p>

<p>He was very small and pathetic, a huddled young creature, dead
and slavering blood, and I felt that pain which I can never escape
when I have killed a young beast. Nevertheless I wasted no time in
bleeding him and gralloching him. As the blood poured out on the
ground I regretted that I had not taken a tin or a bowl with me to
catch it and carry it home for blood puddings; I consoled myself
for that loss by cleaning every vestige of fat from his entrails; I
trailed the gralloch to the loch and flung it in for the pike to
eat, with the exception of the lower gut which I left inside the
beast.</p>

<p>On my way home I climbed up the hill to investigate a stream
which cascaded down the rock. I had been afraid that in the heat of
summer our little pool would dry up and this discovery reassured
me. The water was cold like ice.</p>

<p>'You got a beast,' Terry commented when I arrived at the cave;
'you weren't long. Oh, it's a calf, poor little thing.'</p>

<p>'It will be very tender,' I replied. 'Did you hear
anything?'</p>

<p>'Not a sound. Were you far away?'</p>

<p>'Just round the corner. The .22's the weapon for us, quiet and
deadly. But when I skin this beast you must make a wrist-strap for
me of its skin to carry bullets. You know, a piece of hide about
two inches broad to fasten round my wrist with slits cut in it so
that I can carry bullets in a handy way. It's a nuisance getting
them out of my pocket when I'm lying down and don't want to make a
movement, and the grease gets rubbed off in my pocket, which isn't
good for the rifle.'</p>

<p>'Will we salt it right away?' she asked.</p>

<p>'We won't salt it at all,' I answered.</p>

<p>'We must salt it. Meat won't keep any time&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I found a waterfall along there. The water is as cold as ice.
It must rise from a spring higher up. That waterfall will be our
larder.'</p>

<p>'But I don't understand, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'If we hang our meat in the fall the cold water will keep it
fresh as long as we are likely to leave it. I don't imagine that
will be very long. Carrion beasts won't reach it there.'</p>

<p>'I wasn't very happy about salting meat already,' she said.</p>

<p>'We have no fresh vegetables to keep our blood healthy.'</p>

<p>'He's not very fat,' she commented when the skin was off.</p>

<p>'You'll scrub the gut and dry it and stuff it with meal and fat
and chopped onions,' I told her.</p>

<p>'Mealy puddings! Oh how lovely. My, don't we live well! If you
had kept the bladder and the lungs we could have had haggis,
Hugh.'</p>

<p>I tied the carcass with a piece of rope to a stone above the
falls so that the water poured all round it. While I was busy about
this business Terry stretched the skin on a flat rock, with the
inside up, and pegged it out with stones for the sun to dry. We
addressed ourselves once more to the problem of making the cave our
home.</p>

<p>Not unnaturally we were more timid and anxious than there was
any real need, and for some time we could not work more than a few
moments without hearing dangerous sounds, or casting scared eyes
all around the void scene. When we had eaten we sat down to
regiment our time with as much care as if we were hiding in the
centre of a populous country. Other people were so near in time, so
present in our thoughts, we could not realize that they were far
away, and that we were safe; we felt that our escape had been too
easy; we had been too lucky; we feared that luck would undo what it
had done, and the chance which preserved us might destroy us with
equal ease. We made our arrangements against an infinitesimal
chance, and accordingly we were hindered at every turn by excess of
caution.</p>

<p>We were determined to keep a routine.</p>

<p>'I know what will happen if we don't arrange a time-table,'
Terry declared. 'We'll begin like giants, working too much, full of
enthusiasm and good intentions. Then we'll get tired of that. We'll
overdo the work so much that we'll have to rest. After we rest we
won't be so keen on the dirty jobs. We'll dodge them, we'll put
them off to a more convenient time. Then we'll commence to grow
lazy and untidy. We'll think that this life is only temporary, why
should we fret ourselves over things as if they were permanent!
We'll say things will do for all the time they're to
last&mdash;</p>

<p>'Regular hours, proper meals properly cooked&mdash;no tea
dinners and frying-pan feeds, Hugh!&mdash;enough sleep and not too
much, our affairs planned ahead, are a prime necessity,' she stated
again. 'If one lives by haphazard in civilized surroundings one
grows demoralized. It would be fatal here. We have to think about
winter. We may not be here but we can't take chances.'</p>

<p>I agreed with her, and for the next few days we conformed to
strict rules. We slept out the darkest hours of the night and
worked from dawn until nine o'clock. Thereafter I provided firewood
for the day and dug the driest turf I could find while Terry cooked
a meal. She tidied the cave and washed the dishes with religious
care. From ten o'clock we dozed amongst the rocks if the weather
was warm. We had dinner at six, and set to work again in the
evening. We ate our last meal before daylight left us.</p>

<p>We were forced to change this routine after a couple of nights
in which we scarcely slept a wink, so cold and draughty was our
cave and so hard our couch.</p>

<p>'We can't carry on like this,' I told Terry. 'We scarcely sleep
a wink at night. Once the cave is tight and warm we can sleep in
it, but until then we must snatch sleep through the day, or while
we can. We daren't risk our health and waste our time lying awake
in misery for the sake of a time-table.'</p>

<p>'What can we do at night if we can't sleep?' she asked. 'We
can't work, it's too dark&mdash;'</p>

<p>We found an occupation for the night-time by going down to the
car and stripping it. We brought away its hood and its upholstery,
its tools, and its wind-screen; the side-curtains, even the
petrol-tank and the sump, and everything that would come loose,
brake-rods and controls, torque tubes and stays and number-plates,
were all carried to our cave. On our last journey I erased the
engine number and every other distinguishing mark with a
chisel.</p>

<p>Terry looked at me when I finished the work of destruction.</p>

<p>'That burns our boats,' she murmured.</p>

<p>We had underestimated the labour necessary to build our west
wall. Since this gable would hold our fireplace it was necessary to
plan it out carefully and build it with extreme care. I had a vague
idea in my head for a wall, sloping on the outside from a broad
base to a peak at the roof of the cave, in which we would leave a
square space for our fireplace and a vertical hole for our chimney.
The simplest hearth sufficed to burn peats. To build the wall
itself, without a fireplace, would have cost us little difficulty.
We had unlimited material to our hands in the heaps of broad flat
slabs of stone all around. I am sure we had a sort of fireplace and
chimney constructed ten times, only to discover that it was
unsteady, or the chimney would not draw when we lit a fire, or the
whole top half of the gable collapsed at a touch. We were in
despair.</p>

<p>'If we even had round tins, like oil-drums for example,' Terry
sighed, 'we could knock the ends out and set them one above the
other. We'll be compelled to use our biscuit tins and make a square
chimney, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'That will be the very last resort,' I assured her. 'We must
keep our stores dry. Surely we aren't going to be beaten at this
early date&mdash;there must be something&mdash;Terry! I have it,
drain-pipes!'</p>

<p>I caught her hands and began to dance her round the cave,
singing 'Tra la la la la.'</p>

<p>'Let me go, Hugh,' she scolded. 'Drain-pipes would be very
nice&mdash;if we had drain-pipes.'</p>

<p>'But we have,' I cried, 'they're as good as here. Isn't there a
forest at our back-door? Aren't there deer paths in a forest and
culverts in deer paths and drain-pipes in culverts?'</p>

<p>We made two night expeditions into Ardverikie Forest with our
spade and came back with a couple of drain-pipes each four feet
long. Now the masonry went ahead. We selected only those slabs
which lay on the surface and were lichen-grown. When we put them in
place we kept their weathered edges to the outside, for nothing
attracts the eye like a fresh face of rock in country where all
else is weathered and moss-grown. The fireplace was a simple thing.
We left a vacancy two feet deep and four feet wide in the centre of
the inner side of the wall. When we had lined the back and the
sides of this space with sheets of metal, once the bodywork of our
car, to protect the stone from the heat of our future fire, we
brought the wall to a height of three feet. Now we took the most
solid slab of rock we could carry and laid it across from side to
side above the fireplace to be its lintel. It took us two days to
manoeuvre a sufficiently large slab into place. Having made it
secure we placed one drain-pipe upright at the back of the slab,
resting on a cradle of iron rods from the car. We continued our
wall round the chimney, upwards to the roof.</p>

<p>The wall was by no means weathertight. A multitude of chinks let
in wind from the south and west, especially near the base where our
masonry was most inexpert; we had learned as we worked to lay stone
upon stone so that each fitted to the other. There were many
crannies too under the roof where the wall sloped in and became
narrow. Notwithstanding its flaws the wall was solid and its
foundations were sure. We were jubilant to have a gable and a
chimney. We decided to leave it as it was for a while until we had
redded up the interior of the cave. A little draught was pleasant
rather than objectionable so long as summer lasted, and we could
proof the wall long before winter came.</p>

<p>Terry insisted that we should now make a fireplace.</p>

<p>'We can't work if we aren't properly fed,' she asserted, 'and I
can't make decent meals unless I have a fireplace.'</p>

<p>We knew that peats would burn quite well on a flat stone hearth.
I had seen Highland houses in which the fireplace was simply a
stone dais in the centre of the floor with a hole in the roof above
it to let out some of the smoke. We could have built a similar
hearth under the chimney with great ease, for it required no more
than one or two broad flat stones.</p>

<p>'It would have the advantage that our fire would never go out,
even overnight, if we damped it down in the evening. That would
save matches,' I told Terry.</p>

<p>Terry was not enthusiastic for a peat-hearth. She argued that
such a fire was smoky even in houses with proper chimneys; we could
not expect our tiny chimney to draw unless our fire was brisk.
Moreover, peats left a very fine ash. If we had a fireplace with a
well under the grate the ashes, falling down, were less liable to
be sent through the cave by backing winds, and they could be
collected and taken out of doors without disturbing the fire or
making a mess. She concluded by telling me that she could not
possibly cook on a flat hearth. We decided to make a simple
fireplace consisting of an iron cradle flanked by two broad stone
cheeks upon which pots could simmer and our kindlings dry.</p>

<p>By now we had some skill in our mason-work. Terry picked out
stones for me with an eye to their use and place and we were not
hindered by the heaps of rejected flags which had gathered round us
when we started to make our gable. Hobs and the grate were all we
required to build. We raised two cheeks of stone, each a foot wide
and as deep as the cavity in the gable, at the sides of the cavity.
When these cheeks were six inches high we searched along the shores
of Loch Coulter until we found a bank of clay. I spread a good deep
layer of the clay over the cheeks and laid six pieces of iron from
the car lengthways from cheek to cheek, embedding their ends in the
clay so that they would make a stable bottom for our grate. As soon
as these rods were in place we added another row of flat stones to
the cheeks. It was easy now to form the front of the grate by
wedging two other lengths of iron above each other under successive
layers of flat stones. We packed every cranny with clay. To finish
the job we wedged one of the car's number plates flat beneath the
top stones of the cheeks so that it formed a tray on which a kettle
could sit. These hobs were almost a foot high, I twisted a piece of
brake-rod to the shape of the letter S and slipped one bend over a
stay which supported the chimney. While I was making this crook for
our kettle Terry put dead heather and wood into the grate. I set a
match to the heather. She fetched in a kettle of water and hung it
from the crook. We stood with bated breath while the smoke began to
thicken above the grate; it gathered in the roof of the fireplace;
we felt sick for a moment; if the chimney would not draw our labour
and our zeal were wasted. We could not live in the cave if we had
no fire. The wind was from the east, and we had left the east
entrance to our cave open for the wind to rush through and aid the
chimney. Suddenly the chimney warmed, the smoke which swirled round
our heads was sucked back into the fireplace, the fire went up in a
blaze. We danced, we gazed at our handiwork, we ran outside to tell
each other to come and see the smoke rising from our chimney. We
made tea and sat in front of the fire, fancying that it was winter,
and the wind howled snow-laden against our gable, and pans hottered
in peace by the side of our own peat fire.</p>

<p>'I wish I had eggs,' Terry sighed. 'I'm sure I could bake
hundreds of fine things on our fire. I could make a cake in the
iron pan, using it for an oven, with a peat smouldering on the
lid.'</p>

<p>'Why do you want eggs?' I asked. 'Can't you bake without
them?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she agreed doubtfully. 'But how fine it would be on an
occasion if we had pancakes, Hugh, with raspberry jam&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Don't tempt me,' I besought her, and interrupted myself to cry,
'We can get eggs!'</p>

<p>'Where's your hen?' Terry mocked.</p>

<p>'We've got better than a hen&mdash;gulls&mdash;scores of
them&mdash;in the little loch with the islands beyond Loch
Coulter&mdash;you know, Loch Glas Choire where we caught bait for
the pike.'</p>

<p>'But can we get them?' she asked breathlessly. 'Are the islands
easy to reach? When will we go?'</p>

<p>'We can get them easily,' I assured her.</p>

<p>'What a pity we didn't bring waterglass,' she sighed, 'but we
aren't really to blame. Who'd have imagined&mdash;even if we had
lime&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What do you want lime for?' I demanded.</p>

<p>'To preserve the eggs, Hugh. You boil salt and quicklime
together&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But we can get lime, tons of it! Don't you remember the
lime-kiln by the roadside at Kinlochlaggan? They burnt lime there
forty or fifty years ago. They quarried the lime from an outcrop
beside the Pattock. The vein of limestone runs from Loch Laggan to
Loch Ericht.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Hugh!'</p>

<p>'The vein is bound to pass near here. We'll find an outcrop
somewhere handy, I'm sure of it.'</p>

<p>'If we do find lime we could make mortar for our gable,' she
added with rising excitement.</p>

<p>'Yes, and take the hair from deer-skins if we wanted leather,' I
continued, as excited as herself.</p>

<p>We went off in the utmost haste to search for limestone. I
carried the little rifle with me in case we chanced on game. We
found an outcrop of limestone so quickly that I had no opportunity
to use the rifle. But on the way home Terry stumbled across a
curlew's nest. I tried the eggs in a pool; they sank, and I stowed
them in the snout of my cap.</p>

<p>'Must we really take them?' Terry asked with a stricken glance
at the nest.</p>

<p>'We can't afford to be squeamish,' I replied. 'We are going to
do the same thing to scores of gulls&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Gulls are different somehow&mdash;'</p>

<p>I burned a lump of limestone in our new grate and boiled the
quicklime with an equal quantity of salt. While the brew cooled I
hacked out one end of the car's petrol-tank with an axe. We had
forgotten a tin-opener.</p>

<p>I hammered down the jagged edges of the tank and washed it and
poured in our mixture. Terry put the curlew's eggs in the
pickle.</p>

<p>'That's a beginning to our cure,' she said with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>'Don't we live well,' Terry said a little later when she had
looked at our eggs for the twentieth time. 'How many people in
houses live better?'</p>

<p>Our thoughts went out, we could not for long forget that world
of houses where men lived, which we had fled to escape.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>28 MAY</h2>

<p>IT DAWNED ON me suddenly that this is Term day. We ought to pay
our rent. I have avoided Terry all morning in case she saw how
preoccupied I was, for when she begins to ask me questions I can't
hide what I am thinking. It would distress her if I told her that
our rent would soon be overdue, and that if it was not paid our
belongings would be turned out of the house. I know our landlord
and I have little hope that he will be patient. I should have paid
our rent for a year in advance. Our exile cannot possibly last more
than a year. It would break Terry's heart to think that our house
was taken from us, and our stuff flung out to rot in the open, or
be stolen by every petty thief in the neighbourhood, and the rooms
where we were happy occupied by strangers.</p>

<p>But there may be no house now standing where we lived, no house,
no landlord, nothing. How strange it is that I should think of the
world we have left as if nothing had happened there; and all the
fears which drove us here are so remote that the deepest grief my
present mind can accomplish is because I forgot to pay our
rent.</p>

<p>But it is not deep grief. It troubles the surface of my mind. If
I were really troubled in my heart I could not hide it from her. I
have often tried many a time to keep my vexations secret and my
unhappiness hid, but she finds them out, and I am glad when I am
discovered. These miseries grow light when she knows what they are,
and we bear them together. To-day I am vexed, but not deeply, and
it is as easy to avoid her as it is difficult to keep my mind on
our house and what must become of it because we cannot pay our
rent. The house, happy though we were in it, seems remote and
trivial. All things seem trivial save the life we live now. We have
severed so many bonds, and all have proved so weak, that I scarcely
think of our house and our furniture as our own any more save for
Terry's sake. If I am vexed it is chiefly because I ought to have
remembered to pay our rent. I am equally vexed each time I recall
things we should have brought with us. This is strange, that I
should be perturbed because I have omitted to do things which would
make complete our independence and our severance from our old life;
for our present life is no more than a shift, a temporary escape,
and all its course, and all our thoughts, should be towards its
ending. But it is not so. I am wrapt in the immediate daily events.
I have no desires beyond the cave that shelters us and the land
that we occupy alone.</p>

<p>We occupy, but it is not occupied, nor ever will be occupied. It
lies before me and my eyes that see it, and my feet that walk on
it, mark what they see and feel upon my brain, but what they view
and what they touch is not changed by them, nor aware of them. We
are in the wild land, but not of it; winds and beasts and the brown
cladding of moor are of it; to day and every day they go, they
return, and we, who shift and go, have comfort and protection but
no home. It is strange that this desolate country, heedless and
aloof, should give such comfort and be a sanctuary for the
mind.</p>

<p>My head is never so busy as when I am occupied with monotonous
work. As I cut peats or walk on the hill a multitude of scarcely
related thoughts voice themselves in my brain, and I, like a
half-attentive eavesdropper, hear my own mind rehearse the hundred
shifts and stratagems, the alternating successes and failures which
now elate and again depress us as if it was another's voice I heard
telling a half-fabulous story. And all the while I am alert for
signs in the country, deer with heads in the air, storm-clouds in
the sky, with an attention which seems closer and readier and more
instinctive when half of my mind is occupied than when I watch and
listen with each sense trained to alertness. I have found myself
dropping flat on my face in the heather, and I had to recall my
wits from day-dreaming, and reason and stare before I knew that it
was a stag's horn on the skyline which warned me.</p>

<p>No doubt our continual care to be vigilant has sharpened my
senses and quickened my responses; perhaps a sixth sense has
developed which makes me act automatically; I feel that the present
state of mind I carry with me to the moss and the hill has deeper
roots than a new habit. When we came here first we were always
over-anxious. I strained my eyes watching for men while I hunted
beasts. We were novices in stealth, too bold and too timorous by
uneasy turns, falling from ecstasy to despair upon a trifle. We
have learned soberness. Our fears and our self-satisfaction cannot
now overthrow each other in the twinkling of an eye, nor make our
life a din of contending emotions. We take each moment's task at
its momentary value. We are not ready to feel that the entire
future hangs on the balance of the precarious present.</p>

<p>I find myself becoming more matter of fact every day. When I
rehearse the tale of recent weeks, as I go to stalk in the forest,
it is the events of these weeks I remember, seldom the feelings
that accompanied them, though I am aware that when the events
occurred our joy and pride in them, if they were successful, our
misery, if they betrayed us, seemed to fill the world.</p>

<p>I think I am growing contented. I have been struggling against
contentment for many days. I scourged myself, saying our plight was
desperate; the hands of all men were against us; the future had no
light; we lived on the edge of a world gone mad; our house was
forfeit and we were in truth homeless outcasts. The world was at
war.</p>

<p>I strove in vain to foster discontent. No sooner had I begun
working in the peat-moss than my labour there used all my strength,
and my head refused to vex itself with future woes or other men's
grief.</p>

<p>We cut our peats from a deep bank of moss which lies in a pocket
of rock on the hill-top above our cave. The wind is sweet on that
high eminence. It comes from the sea.</p>

<p>If we take things more casually now, it is not because
difficulties have vanished or diminished. We have hard problems to
solve every day. Some difficulties increase. Though I have become a
better stalker, though I have studied the morning mist in the
corries until I know almost every wind that blows, though I go
after deer without the exaggerated caution which used to defeat me
more often than it aided me, stalking is no mere mechanical
occupation like a visit to a killing-house to slaughter a sheep. I
have spent many long days on the hill since April passed and come
home empty. During April I did not go far afield for meat. I went
out at dawn and hid to leeward of some gully through which the deer
passed on their return from the moss-crop. In a very short time the
deer grew scary, and it dawned on us that we were very
short-sighted. We had already frightened the neighbourhood by our
mere presence; if we continued to kill beasts within a mile or two
of the cave they would forsake the locality.</p>

<p>'I'll have to go farther out,' I told Terry. 'Grouse are so wild
already they get up half a mile before I come near them, and as for
deer they watch us from the skyline and bolt at our least movement.
We'll make this bit of ground a sanctuary, and never kill inside it
unless there's dire need. We may not want to go far out for our
meat when winter comes.'</p>

<p>'Must you go a great distance?' Terry asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'Farther every day I'm afraid. As summer comes on and the flies
arrive the deer will move right up to the summits&mdash;you mustn't
worry, honey. I'll be quite safe.'</p>

<p>Often and often I come home without meat, tired, wet, and
dispirited. Variable winds, an alert beast in another quarter
altogether from those I am stalking, flat slopes where I creep and
crawl in vain efforts to come within shooting distance of a herd,
my own haste or breathlessness, make stalking a gamble and give it
zest too. There is a great deal of satisfaction in dropping a
nobber with the .22 at a hundred yards range. I feel less like a
butcher after a difficult stalk. Of course when I see deer a couple
of hundred yards away that I can in nowise approach I long for the
.303. The little rifle is deadly enough if it is held straight at
distances up to a hundred yards. Beyond that hitting and killing
with it is a risk which I do not often take; I have no wish to
wound beasts or merely frighten them, and many a time I have spent
two hours grovelling in a slimy bog to discover that it was useless
going farther. Then I turn my back on the herd I am stalking; they
graze in peace while I snake back the way I had come.</p>

<p>Tired and vexed and footsore though I may be, I never draw near
the place we have made our home without a feeling like ecstasy
flooding over me. The surge of rock out of the great gorge, the
loud wind amongst the gullies in that cliffy hill which overhang
our cave, the blind expanse of the vacant world, spring's colours
in the sky and on the moor, change all my spirits.</p>

<p>Terry has hot water and dry clothes waiting for me at whatever
time I come home. When I am cheerful, with half a young deer over
my shoulder and the forequarters hidden safely on the hill, I step
gently to take her by surprise. I never can use enough stealth for
that though I would swear my footfall falls no louder than rain, or
the hunting fox's pad, amongst the rocks. She is out of the cave to
greet me and while I hand her the rifle to wipe dry and the
telescope to clean she bubbles over with questions, praise for my
success, news of her own doings through the day. If the weather is
warm we carry my change of clothes to the waterfall and I strip to
bathe under its icy flood; she rinses out my dirty stockings as I
dry myself. When I am out the livelong day (for if I get nothing
between dawn and the strength of morning I hole up wherever day
finds me, waiting for evening) I can never bear to rest in the
cave. I choke for breath inside. Like one whose appetite is whetted
by what it feeds on I grudge each moment of the day that passes
without my seeing the open country. I remember one evening when we
skinned a fat yeld hind. Terry made supper. I sat at the mouth of
the cave, and evening grew to night beneath my gaze; the shadowed
sun went down into its western sea beyond the hills and every
valley was darkened until the mazy woods were one with the general
dusk. Away to the north the Olympic peak of Craig Dhu glowed in
azure light above its harboured straths. I heard Terry come out
beside me.</p>

<p>'I'd have died in prison, Terry,' I said.</p>

<p>'We have done for ourselves, finished ourselves, given ourselves
up bound and captive,' she whispered. 'Never to escape, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'Escape!' I said, surprised by her tone, and turned to look at
her. Her face was pale, her eyes, fixed on the islanded hills,
seemed to grow large and take in the light which still shone over
these proud peaks. Her face was like that of one transfigured.</p>

<p>She spread her hands over the gorge, the moor, and all our
country under the dappled sky.</p>

<p>'When we grafted ourselves to this wild stock,' she said in a
low voice.</p>

<p>'Here's no grafting,' I told her sadly. 'We're bound to it, as
if we were made of it, but what binds it to us?' I made a puff of
breath with my lips. 'A little breath, some dust&mdash;and this
place as if we never were.'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>'A little dust makes it and us one,' she said. 'You must be
dying with hunger, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'I'm past being hungry,' I confessed. 'I could have eaten
heather two hours ago.'</p>

<p>'Had you a difficult time?' she inquired. I told her about my
adventures round the Durc where the eagles nest, and I saw a wren
hopping from boulder to boulder under the shadow of its great
neighbours' wings. I halted my recital to ask, half-jesting, 'What
grows on our wild stock, Terry, wild roses or a crown of
thorns?'</p>

<p>'Many a crown of thorns on men's brows this day,' she murmured.
'I wonder what's happening in the world?'</p>

<p>Dangers as well as empty days accompany my stalking. I had so
many living enemies to look for, wary deer and chance strangers
from the world of men, that I grew careless about the natural
dangers of the country. In the beginning of May I went off before
dawn as usual to go into Ardverikie Forest. There had been frost,
and white rime lightened the gloom and let me pick my way amongst
the hags into which I generally floundered on these morning
excursions. It was essential to get meat; our last piece of boiled
venison was in my pocket. We had let ourselves run short while we
delved our peats and set them up to dry. Since we depended on meat
a great deal, and saved our stores as far as possible, we required
to kill something very frequently. We had enjoyed voracious
appetites since we arrived at the cave. So far I had brought home
mostly calves and nobbers, but the stags were putting on flesh
after their winter hunger, and this day I set my mind on a grown
beast.</p>

<p>The wind was erratic and an unlucky breath from the south
spoiled my first stalk. It had been a long difficult business. I
was compelled to work uphill towards the herd I picked out on the
ridge of Meall nan Eacan. The stags were lying as usual with their
heads downhill so that most of my progress up the concave ascent
was on my belly. The day was well advanced before I got near my
quarry. When they winded me it was too late to begin a fresh stalk.
I crouched in heather to sleep out the middle of the day.</p>

<p>When the sun began to near the west I scanned the shoulder of
the Farrow, about three miles away in a direct line, but five or
six miles distant by the route I must follow, over the hill on
which I hid, down a steep corrie, across the Sluie valley, and up
the Farrow itself. If I could cross the glen without being observed
it would be easy to approach my deer. I hurried on my way, trusting
to the shadow of night which already filled the valley to hide me.
When I came into the floor of the valley my work began. Hundreds of
deer had appeared on the slope of the Farrow; they were moving
slowly downhill towards the moors where they would feed all night,
but I could not reckon on their arriving near me before it grew too
dark to shoot. I advanced by inches over the flat in full view of
any deer that chanced to look my way. I could not even risk to jump
the Sluie stream which flowed across my path. I soaked myself to
the skin creeping through a pool on my hands and knees, with the
water round my shoulders. Eventually I came under the curve of the
hill and lay a moment to rest. The climb before me was steep and
the light was rapidly degenerating. I made what haste I could
towards the herd I marked. When I reached the place where I saw
them they were no longer there. I sat down in despair. As I looked
idly across the lip of the Durc I saw a hind's head on the far side
with the eyes gazing directly at me. My first shot missed
completely. I was too excited and shaken to aim straight. The
second broke her shoulder. She tried to turn on the narrow ledge
where she was standing. She tumbled as she put her weight on the
useless leg; another shot took her in the chest and she sprang
clear from her ledge, over the sheer rock, into the depths of the
ravine. I could hear her body striking successive ledges and a
small avalanche of stones accompanied her. Without pausing to think
if the way down was practicable I rushed over the edge of the gorge
and began to lower myself from boulder to boulder so that I could
see where she had fallen and make sure that she was dead.</p>

<p>I glimpsed her, as it seemed vertically beneath me, striving to
rise to her feet. She was half covered with stones and shingle. I
could not see to shoot her in the heart. Again I let myself down,
zigzagging round vertical rocks and lying on my belly across
boulders which I could not circumvent, slithering and bracing
myself down gravel-slides. The hind, when I saw her next, seemed
motionless. I should have known the fall would kill her even if my
bullets failed, but I was too excited for such calm thoughts as
would have restrained me from descending the side of the Durc at
its steepest part. I was carrying my rifle in my hand. I now slung
it across my shoulder and continued my descent with my heart in my
mouth at each step, for my frenzied excitement had spent itself and
the height above me seemed unscalable; the fall beneath was sheer,
and I crouched between heaven and earth on the brink of a
precipice. When I was only thirty feet above the hind, but still a
good deal higher from the floor of the caon&mdash;for she had been
checked in her fall by boulders&mdash;I reached a descent which I
could not escape by going round it; nor could I go back; I could
scarcely believe that I had come from that overhanging lip I saw
above me, black against the sky. I drew back in panic from the
verge of the cliff with my feet on a ledge which seemed more
inadequate and slippery every moment. At first I stood there with
my hands idle. Soon I grew dizzy and clutched tufts of heather to
keep myself from falling. All at once I saw the hind make a
desperate effort. She flung herself clear of the stones which lay
on her. It was her death-struggle but that idea never entered my
head. I grew excited again and dragged the rifle from my shoulder.
As I got it free my feet slipped. I felt myself plunging over the
abyss. I saw the hind sinking on her side; then I struck the
ground; instead of the horrid jarring of broken bones I felt an
equally horrible soft squelching shock. Before I could gather my
wits or realize where I had fallen I was waist deep in a green bog
beside the stream which drains the Durc. The rifle flew out of my
grasp and lodged between two boulders close to the burn.</p>

<p>If it had gone beyond my reach I should have drowned in that
filthy stinking hole without much delay. I shall never forget the
foul smell of the morass. Green bubbles burst in the scum around
me. My strongest feeling as I sank was not fear but revulsion; to
choke submerged in this abominable stew!&mdash;I strained to reach
the rifle and succeeded in clasping the tips of the fingers of my
left hand round the barrel. When I put my weight on the barrel it
did not move. It was wedged securely; now I could breathe, and now
feel fear; I pulled and struggled to escape. The bog clung to
me.</p>

<p>I had not enough strength in my fingers to pull myself nearer to
the side. I had indeed scarcely enough strength to keep myself from
sinking farther, and already my fingers were losing their grip,
growing numb, slipping from the smooth steel. I set my teeth and
made myself quit labouring and struggling so that I could think,
before it was too late. I saw a dreadful picture of myself hanging
there until my left hand released its hold, and I went down.</p>

<p>A mood of apathy came over me. Rest was sweet, to close one's
eyes; a violent desire for life followed immediately afterwards. I
thought of a hundred expedients. No doubt there were only seconds
between my falling into the bog and the moment when I dragged the
leather belt from my waist with my right hand; it was all I could
do to force myself to thrust my hand into the slime to unloosen my
belt. I was wearing a broad leather belt, stiff enough to push
forward with my right hand until it passed underneath the barrel of
the rifle. I got the tip of the forefinger of my left hand round
the edge of the belt. With bated breath I worked the belt between
my other fingers. Then I had both ends in my hand, in my two hands;
I lay with closed eyes, resting my weight on the line that held my
life. I had to wait until strength returned to my left hand before
I could drag myself free. I was free; I lay on my face on the
ground with my hands gripping the solid dear earth. I was sick and
spent, but the beast which cost so much must be brought home. I
gralloched the hind and severed her backbone. When the forequarters
were happed with stones to keep them safe from carrion beasts and
birds I got the hindquarters over my head, with a haunch on each
side of my neck and the legs in my hands. Staggering, tripping,
reeling, I blundered home.</p>

<p>Terry was distracted with anxiety, and I could not clean all the
mire from my clothes. I concocted a story which sounded false as I
told it. Oh, how sweet it was to be clean, to lie down, to
sleep!</p>

<p>We have had adventures, but for the most part our life is
simple, laborious, and quiet. We had a great deal of work that we
knew we must do. Each task as we accomplished it led to others that
we had not thought of. As soon as our gable was erected we went
into the cave to plan what we must do in it. The floor was very
uneven; the bare rock protruded through the thin layer of peaty
ground. We chipped away as much of these outcrops as we could. Of
course the floor of the cave, being part of the hill-side, had a
considerable list as well as inequalities, though fortunately it
sloped less steeply than the ground outside. A few inches of fall
made matters very uncomfortable for us, especially when the gable
was built and shut out most of our light. We had to sleep across
the floor with our feet downhill, and if we moved we were liable to
roll to the bottom side of the cave, amongst the pots and tins and
duffle. If we wakened suddenly and lifted our heads we were sure to
strike them on the rock.</p>

<p>Until the last stone was laid in the gable the cave was well
lighted. We could see where we were putting our feet. But
immediately the wall had shut out the sun the cave grew pitch dark.
We must have light to illumine our work. We laboured for a week by
the smoky flare of a bog-fir torch and the glimmer of our fire. If
we made a fire big enough to light the cave it was too hot for
working. Our torches produced more smoke than illumination. To
crown our misfortunes the wind, which had been blowing gently from
the south-east since we kindled our first fire in the new grate,
commenced to back, and after several shifts it finally fetched up
in the south-west.</p>

<p>I suppose we were foolish to imagine that because our chimney
drew at its first trial it would never smoke, whatever the wind. No
sooner had the breeze gone to the west of south than smoke started
to belch into the cave, intermittently at first, and afterwards,
when the wind went near west, almost as if the cave had become the
chimney.</p>

<p>We are not very expert yet in this life, but I am afraid that we
were absolute fools then. We fell into the utmost anguish at this
reverse. I was all for knocking down the gable we had built so
painfully and letting the weather do its worst. Terry cried, I
could have cried too if I had not flown into a rage and kicked the
fireplace with all my strength, loosening the bars we had spent
days fixing.</p>

<p>Our eyes smarted, our nerves were on edge, we squabbled like
nervous children, going into a rage without provocation and
becoming abjectly penitent the next moment. We set ourselves to
filling the chinks in our wall, but we had neither enthusiasm nor
interest in our work.</p>

<p>'Will we make Lime and mix mortar?' Terry asked.</p>

<p>'How long do you think we've got to patch this filthy wall?' I
demanded. 'Years?'</p>

<p>'You don't need to snap my head off,' she retorted.</p>

<p>We brought clay in a pail from the lochside and plastered the
crevices. As we had sunk to immeasurable depths on a reverse, so a
little success elated us. When the wall was proofed and lapped in
clay our fire blazed up, the cave cleared of smoke, we looked at
each other with radiant pride, forgetting every squabble in the
moment of accomplishment.</p>

<p>The cure was not quite complete. Occasionally a gust drove smoke
down the chimney, though it was no worse in that respect than many
chimneys in houses we had seen. But I was encouraged by our victory
and determined to make it final. At nightfall one day I took the
second drain-pipe we had brought from Ardverikie and up-ended it
over our chimney-can. When it was in place and fixed with a few
stays I heard Terry's voice crying from inside the cave. I rushed
to find out what had happened.</p>

<p>'Look, Hugh!' she exclaimed, pointing to the fire. It blazed
merrily and the air of the cave was sweet and clean.</p>

<p>'We've done it, we've done it!' I shouted, and hastened to
placate fate by adding: 'Of course the trouble is that we must take
the pipe down through the day in case it's noticed.'</p>

<p>'I don't care if it comes down twice an hour,' Terry said in an
enraptured voice. 'Now we can get ahead with our house. What about
light, Hugh? We won't let a trifle like light prevent us now.'</p>

<p>'I could kill a sheep,' I said slowly, 'and make candles of the
tallow.'</p>

<p>Terry shook her head.</p>

<p>'We're not going to become sheep-stealers for the sake of a
candle,' she returned.</p>

<p>I laughed at her reproof.</p>

<p>'Oh, I didn't intend to take a sheep from a farm,' I returned;
'but to stalk one of the brutes that are running wild in the forest
and warning deer whenever I come in sight&mdash;if I could stalk
them! They're wilder than deer and they whistle when they see you,
standing on the top of every craggy knoll to give warning! Maybe
you're right. Don't you fancy a nice mutton chop? They'd be as
tough as leather and as thin as rakes probably.'</p>

<p>The deer I had killed as yet were very lean, with scarcely any
fat on their guts, and we required what little there was for
cooking; if there was any to spare Terry salted it against the
future. In the commencement of May we happened to recollect that
our fishing-tackle had never been looked at. I caught a fry of
small trout on Loch Coulter, and put out set lines for pike. When
we returned to inspect our lines we had two pike weighing eight or
nine pounds each. I opened them by the loch-side to rebait my hooks
with their entrails. They were full of soft oily fat. I carried it
to the cave in triumph. We melted out the oil in a pan and added
the scum of fat which rose to the surface of the water in which we
boiled our pike. We were left with a good pint of oil.</p>

<p>I drained a milk-tin by cutting two holes in one end and blowing
through one hole while the milk ran out of the other. Terry swilled
out the residue of milk with boiling water and I went to the
lochside for strong stalks of green rushes. I peeled the skin away
from the pith of the rushes and laid the short lengths of pith to
dry before our fire. Terry half-filled the tin with oil. Next we
soaked two lengths of pith in oil and stuck them through the holes
in the tin so that their bottom ends were in the oil and each
protruded about an inch from the tin. We put a light to our wicks.
They burned with a tiny yellow spluttering flame. With the light of
our fire besides we had sufficient illumination for our work, and
if we required more light we could bore other holes in the tin and
add extra wicks.</p>

<p>'Can we always get pike?' Terry asked anxiously, 'or must we
catch as many as possible just now and extract enough oil for
winter?'</p>

<p>'They ought to be still fatter in winter,' I answered. 'But it
would be a wise plan to gather a store of oil just now in case the
weather is too wild later on. The loch will freeze over,' I went
on.</p>

<p>'Then if we can get oil at any time I'm going to make dubbin for
our shoes,' she said.</p>

<p>We had forgotten to bring boot polish with us. We had been using
the offal which remained when Terry melted out the deer fat to
smear our shoes. It kept them soft and waterproof for a time, but
it quickly wore off. My boots had begun to bleach and show signs of
wear at the toes. The rank heather and stones through which I had
to go on my way to the forest were hard on boots. Terry collected
soot from the chimney and mixed it to a stiff paste with some pike
oil. The mixture proved very successful. It seemed to feed the
leather and give it a gloss as well as waterproof it.</p>

<p>When I saw Terry busy making her dubbin I thought I had better
do something to protect the toes of my boots. We had a few knots of
limestone remaining from what we brought home to make the pickle
for our eggs and I burnt them and made a stiff paste of the
quicklime with water. This paste I spread over the outside of a
square of deer skin. In a few days I washed away the lime and all
the hair came with it. I laid the bare skin on a rock with stones
at the corners to keep it taut and treated it liberally with the
dubbin. Then I cut two strips an inch wide and three inches long
and nailed them with brass rivets, of which we had a half-pound,
round the toes of my boots. Terry meanwhile cut two other pieces
from our deer-leather to make anklets for me. They were long enough
to encircle my legs over the tops of my boots, and three inches
broad. She sewed a long thin strip of leather to one end of each
anklet which would go twice round my legs and hold the anklets in
place like the tapes of puttees. These fastenings were only
temporary. As soon as we could spare more time she intended to
steal the back-straps from two pairs of my breeches and use their
buckles for my anklets.</p>

<p>For the moment, after I had admired my boots and anklets, we
determined to abjure the hundreds of tempting refinements which
were constantly suggesting themselves, and to devote all our
attention to making the cave comfortable. Fortunately the ground of
the floor was slightly deeper under the cliff than on the outer
side of the cave, and we rectified the floor's list by digging a
few inches from the top side and spreading out the earth lower
down. We finally produced a fairly flat smooth surface, though it
was still soft. We pounded the floor with flat heavy stones until
it was so hard that my tackety boots made no impression in it
though I jumped and danced.</p>

<p>From our first arrival in the cave we were inconvenienced by
lack of a place in which to stow our belongings. We struggled along
while the west end was open and the cave was light. Thereafter we
could no longer carry bulky obstacles out of doors when they were
in the way. We were always tripping over bedding, clothes, pots and
tools, and besides our annoyance we had a permanent fear in case we
broke something irreplaceable. We could only get ahead with our
work because Terry did little except stay beside me moving things
from one place to another as I digged or pounded, and that of
course meant that our work went at the rate of one pair of hands
instead of two.</p>

<p>We realized that we could never make progress until we had a
place in which to stow our furniture. Even in tins our food became
damp, and our bedding required to be aired every day. Our health as
well as our comfort demanded cupboards.</p>

<p>'We ought to have left two openings in the wall beside the
fireplace for pots and dishes,' I said. But the wall would have
been too weak had we done that.</p>

<p>'Could we not make holes in the rock and drive pegs into them,'
Terry suggested.</p>

<p>We tried and failed to drive a hole in the rock.</p>

<p>'In fact we're beat,' Terry said in a melancholy voice. 'Och
then I suppose we can't do anything but struggle away as best we
can. Oh I do hate to see this litter on the floor, everything
spoiling&mdash;'</p>

<p>While we were tormenting our heads for a solution to this
problem another presented itself. We were most uncomfortable
sleeping on the floor, even after the floor was levelled. We had
only enough bedclothes to keep us warm and of course we could not
spare to lay any underneath us in place of a mattress to relieve
the hardness of the floor. To make matters worse it was necessary
to roll up our bed whenever we wakened since we needed all the
cave's space to cook and work in. This second objection to our bed
on the floor hindered us from making a heather couch. We knew that
a properly made heather-bed was softer than the softest bed of
down. You gather young heather and pack it upright in a square
frame until the whole frame is tightly filled. We could have made a
simpler bed of heather or bracken heaped on the floor. The bracken
or heather would scatter through the cave. It would become damp. It
could not be replaced by dry heather in winter.</p>

<p>Furthermore every bed we envisaged on the floor would expose us
to the draught which blew towards the fireplace.</p>

<p>'If we had a hammock&mdash;' Terry lamented after a long futile
discussion.</p>

<p>'Terry! Terry!' I cried in rapture. 'Oh, what a fool I am not to
have thought of it&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Thought of what?' she asked curiously, regarding my joyful
antics without enthusiasm. 'Do you mean a hammock, Hugh? Where
could we sling it? Wouldn't it be in our way equally with a bed on
the floor?'</p>

<p>I refused to tell her what my plan was, though she implored me
to divulge it.</p>

<p>'It mightn't be a success,' I put her off. Of course, if I had
not been fairly certain of its success I should have let her into
the secret, and avoided the danger of solitary discomfiture.</p>

<p>Leaving her to work in the cave, I went to the birch wood beside
Loch Coulter with the heavy axe and cut down and trimmed six good
straight young birch trees. When I had fetched them to the cave I
took measurements of the distances from the outer edge of the floor
and from the inner edge to the peak of the roof; I took these
measurements inside the cave close by the fireplace, four feet from
the fireplace, and ten feet from the fireplace. I cut the poles,
one for each measurement, but every pole three inches or thereby
longer than the measurement, and I made holes in the floor at the
places where I had taken the measurements. I now carried the poles
into the cave and set them up in the places I had measured for
them, with their butt ends in the holes in the floor and their
points just crossing underneath the roof. I lashed each pair
together where they crossed so that I had as it were three pairs of
rafters. As soon as this was done I returned to the wood and found
a slender birch tree from which I cut a straight ten-foot length. I
searched again for rowan saplings about two inches thick; I
collected six of these and they were likewise ten feet long.</p>

<p>When these in turn were brought to the cave I packed the holes
in the floor with small stones and tamped the stones with clay and
pounded it until the rafters were as firm at the base as I could
make them. Thereafter I slipped the ten-foot birch along the roof
until the end touched the chimney-wall. It rested safely in the
crutch of the three crossed rafters, and I lashed it there. The
rowan saplings were likewise tied to the rafters at equal distances
down the sides of the cave; I had a framework ready for my
plan.</p>

<p>Terry watched me with an expression half-curious,
half-rebellious, on her face.</p>

<p>'It's not fair, Hugh,' she cried out at length, 'you ought to
tell me what you are doing. Anyway,' she concluded illogically, 'I
don't believe you know yourself, unless you think the roof is about
to fall, and how am I to cook with that cat's cradle dangling over
my head?'</p>

<p>Without saying a word I took a pan and pushed its handle between
the lowest cross-piece of my framework and the rock, on the down
side of the cave.</p>

<p>'A rack!' cried Terry, clapping her hands and hastening to
arrange the other pots alongside the first.</p>

<p>'Is that what you meant?' she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'Partly,' I replied, laughing at her eagerness.</p>

<p>'What's next?' she wanted to know.</p>

<p>'We're going for a walk,' I told her. Her face clouded
again.</p>

<p>'Don't tease me, Hugh,' she exclaimed. 'You're very bad to
me.'</p>

<p>'Since we haven't any nails of our own we must steal some,' I
hastened to explain, 'so we'll walk as far west as the Ardverikie
march and get a few staples from the deer-fence.'</p>

<p>'Isn't that very wrong of us?' she asked. 'What are we going to
do with staples?'</p>

<p>'Sling our hammock, Terry.'</p>

<p>'From this frame, Hugh?' she asked in dubious tones. 'Oh&mdash;I
see. But won't it be in our way?'</p>

<p>I explained that the hammock would be attached permanently on
one side, but on the other it would be fixed in such a way that we
could disengage it from the frame and swing it upwards flat against
the wall when it was out of use.</p>

<p>'Like a wall-bed in a flat!' she cried, all enthusiasm. 'My! it
was clever of you to think that out, Hugh. Can we go for the
staples at once? I'm dying to see&mdash;isn't it exciting? What fun
we're having, you and me together.'</p>

<p>We fetched four posts which happened to be slack and might come
in useful as well as a pocketful of staples from the Ardverikie
fence. Terry now insisted that she must be allowed to share in the
job, so while I built a rectangular frame four feet wide and six
feet long with stout rowan saplings she stripped the hood of our
car from its stays and ribs. She cut a piece of the hood to the
shape of the hammock-frame but a few inches wider to allow the
material to be turned round the side-pieces and end-pieces of the
frame when it was ready for sewing. As soon as we had stretched the
canvas taut Terry sewed it in place. I drove staples into the four
rafters farthest from the fire, and into the middle cross-pieces
between these rafters.</p>

<p>We fetched several yards of wire from the fence in Ardverikie
Forest and cut it into lengths of a foot. I looped eight of these
pieces of wire through the staples on the up side of the cave, and,
passing the ends of the wires round one side of the hammock,
twisted them until they were safe from coming loose, and all were
of the same length. Thereafter I bent eight other wires to the
shape of the sneck of a farm gate. The loop ends encircled the
opposite side of the hammock-frame from that I had already fixed
while the right-angled ends engaged with staples in the rafters and
cross-pieces on the lower side of the cave. A few staples hammered
into the roof beam held the hammock against the wall while it was
tilted up and not in use. We regarded our work in silence.</p>

<p>'We'll be above the draught to the chimney too!' Terry
exclaimed. 'What are we going to do next, Hugh?'</p>

<p>It was darkling and I was tired with walking and working. 'Enjoy
the first night's comfortable sleep we've had since we came here,'
I told her.</p>

<p>'We need a mantelpiece&mdash;we need chairs and a
table&mdash;oh, thousands of things,' she said. 'I'm sleepy too.
Let down the hammock, boy. I'm tired to death, oh so sleepy.
Clever, clever Hugh.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>10 JUNE</h2>

<p>WHEN I WAKENED this morning I half expected to see fresh snow on
the tops. I think I should have been glad of snow, anything to
break the monotony of this rain-swept week. The day was cold enough
for winter.</p>

<p>'Still raining, Hugh?' Terry asked from amongst the
blankets.</p>

<p>'Oh get up and see for yourself,' I answered in a rage.</p>

<p>'Still raining then,' she told herself with a sigh. 'Still
pelting rain.'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't care if it did pelt,' I went on savagely. 'It's this
cold drizzle that gets on my nerves.'</p>

<p>'Are you coming back to bed?' she inquired.</p>

<p>'What's the use of that?' I demanded. 'What's the use of
anything. Damn these kindlings, won't they ever catch! There's not
a dry peat nor a dry stick&mdash;I'm fed up! fed up! fed up!'</p>

<p>'Poor boy,' she murmured.</p>

<p>'Don't "Poor boy!" me!' I raged. 'Get up and see if you can make
this fire burn. How do you expect me to move with that filthy
hammock right across the place?'</p>

<p>She sat up and gazed at me with round sleepy eyes, and passed
her hand abstractedly through her hair.</p>

<p>'Are you in a rage with me, Hugh?' she asked.</p>

<p>'No I'm not,' I retorted. 'Why should I be in a rage with
you?&mdash;I don't know what I am&mdash;oh, can't you leave me
alone and not bother me?'</p>

<p>I got down on my knees before the fire to puff and blow into its
black sodden heart. For all my breath and all the ashes that blew
out into my face the sticks would not take.</p>

<p>Terry began to put on her clothes with the most sober
expression.</p>

<p>'Let me do it,' she said, gently pushing me aside. I stood up to
watch her. She whittled slivers of fir from a root and laid them in
the fireplace and poured a little pike-oil on them. In a moment a
tongue of flame came licking up, and as it grew she added splinters
of wood until it was bright and strong. I bent down beside her to
heap on roots. When the wet skin of the sticks dried they caught
fire suddenly, and went up in a blaze which filled the chimney and
lighted the cave to its farthest corner.</p>

<p>'Now, Hugh,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry I was cross&mdash;' I began in conscience-stricken
tones; 'you mustn't pay any attention to me.'</p>

<p>'But really, Hugh,' she expostulated, 'you can scarcely expect
me to ignore you when you make such a loud noise.'</p>

<p>'Was I making an awful noise?' I murmured.</p>

<p>'You're very violent, my dear,' she continued.</p>

<p>'You mustn't heed me&mdash;' I began, and hesitated. 'I was
going to give you a cup of tea in bed,' I said discontentedly.</p>

<p>'Run and look at the weather and then we'll have a cup by the
fire instead,' she encouraged me.</p>

<p>I went slowly to the door.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I cried when I looked outside. 'Terry, the sun!'</p>

<p>She came running, half-clad as she was, to view the break in the
mist through which the effulgent sun showed momentarily. We gazed
at each other and laughed with delight and going outside we capered
crazily amongst wet heather and slippery rocks until we were
breathless. The cave and a few yards around lay in a pool of
sunlight, but everywhere else there was thick mist. Our narrow
corner, islanded in mist and that strange silence of a misty day,
grew warm. Though many burns made a sound the world was silent.</p>

<p>'We'll have our breakfast outside,' I declared. 'As sure as
death I thought the sun was gone away for good and all. Harken, did
you hear a grouse?'</p>

<p>'Och, leave it in peace,' she said, arresting me with her hand.
'We don't need meat at the moment, Hugh. I wouldn't like to shoot
it&mdash;it's like an envoy&mdash;a harbinger&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Of better days?'</p>

<p>'And better temper.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it was the drizzle that got on my nerves!' I said. 'If rain
comes down properly I like it. It's fine to see the burns get up
and hear them roar; I love to stand at the door watching the spates
come over the rocks as white as snow. Something's happening when it
comes a flood and the wilder it is the surer you know that it's got
to end some time. If you stay inside how warm and dry and
comfortable you are, and if you go out, then you get soaked and
that's all. But this drizzle, this mist, this clamminess that's
neither wet nor dry nor properly cold nor warm, it's not enough to
make you bide indoors, and when you go out it seeps and creeps
until you're wet and cold and miserable to the very marrow of your
bones. You can't see, you can't think&mdash;I like wild
weather&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes,' was all she said.</p>

<p>'It's terrible to let a little mist get the better of me,' I
went on ruefully.</p>

<p>'We are very close to the weather here, Hugh,' she said.</p>

<p>'Imagine it, we were pleased to see the rain&mdash;' I
began.</p>

<p>'I'm quite pleased it came,' she interrupted. 'It taught us
lessons we were sadly needing.'</p>

<p>'I suppose it did,' I assented grudgingly, and then, suspicious
of her meaning, I demanded, 'What did it teach us, Terry?'</p>

<p>'You know quite well,' she returned. 'The only way we learn
things, Hugh, is by feeling them, suffering them. If we had all
good weather and every day sunny until winter arrived we'd never
discover how to keep our clothes dry, or make use of a fine
interval&mdash;or avoid knocking against each other.'</p>

<p>'A damned expensive way of learning,' I grumbled. 'My peats will
be as wet as muck.'</p>

<p>'Didn't you make them into heaps?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but that wouldn't save them.'</p>

<p>'You can't tell until you've seen them. What's the use of
meeting trouble, Hugh? If they're wet they'll dry. We can cut more.
A few hot days will cure all the harm that's been done. But if we
had no bad weather till winter, we'd see our stuff being spoilt
then, without any hope of heat and sun to mend it.</p>

<p>'And our cave is really fit for living in,' she added.</p>

<p>When the hammock was erected we made a mantel-shelf over the
fireplace by laying six rowan saplings side by side from one wall
of the cave to the other. They made a fairly level shelf and I was
pleased with it but Terry did not rest content until she sewed the
relics of our car hood into a narrow strip long enough to cover the
shelf. She went out furtively leaving me to arrange our teapot, my
watch, the tin which served for a tea-caddy, and a variety of other
small things on the mantelpiece. She returned in a few minutes with
her arms full of bell-heather, rowan-blossom, a few sprays from a
gean tree that we found growing in a sheltered corner by Loch
Coulter, and crow-foot, buttercups, and wild clover from a grassy
plot that had once been occupied by a house of which the ruins were
still visible. Probably it had been a summer-shieling. We were very
fond of that plot of green. We often wondered about the people who
had lived there. Terry filled milk-tins with water to hold her
flowers and arranged her vases on the shelf.</p>

<p>'You should have fetched some nettles too,' I said,
half-mocking.</p>

<p>'That's cruel of you, Hugh,' she said in a hurt voice.</p>

<p>'We could eat them. People used them for a vegetable in the last
war.' We admired each other's work for a little while. Then I made
loops of wire to hang from the rafters and hold the rifles and our
tools. While Terry was stowing away our tins of food on the
wall-ends of the mantelshelf, and suspending dishes and pans and
clothes from the rafters, I sawed the four posts we had taken from
Ardverikie to equal lengths of a little less than three feet. Using
these posts for legs and the straightest branches I could find for
ends and sides I constructed the rough skeleton of a table. We were
at a loss for a top to our table. I suggested a deer skin, but
Terry doubted whether our curing was effective enough for such an
important purpose. Eventually we found a broad thin slab of rock
which I trimmed roughly and laid on the framework. Our table was
ready.</p>

<p>Chairs were our next thought. We had the cushions from the car,
two front cushions and a long seat from the back. They were
comfortable but if they were laid on the ground they were much too
low. When I proposed to make stools of turves Terry pointed out
that they would make the place dirty and they could not be moved
from place to place. I agreed very reluctantly, and in the end we
contrived serviceable though shaky stools from birch saplings.</p>

<p>Our cave was gradually assuming the appearance of a dwelling.
With a good fire burning and the milk-tin lamp shedding its light
from the mantelshelf, it was both gay and snug. The floor was
strewn with deer-skins; we sat down a hundred times a day, on our
own chairs by the fire, to regard our achievements. When the door
was closed with deer-skin curtains no draught entered, whatever the
wind's direction. The small wood violets that Terry gathered every
day, even when rain fell and mist covered the land, made a faint
perfume.</p>

<p>All the while we were busy with these improvements the rain kept
falling, and mist drew closer every day. At first I was pleased
with the weather. I had work indoors to occupy me. The wind and the
rain came up so thunderously out of the west, the waters rose with
such wild haste, I was exhilarated, I kept running from admiring
the cave, which did not let in a drop of water, to the doorway
whence I could watch the storm sweep down the gorge beneath me. Our
little trickle of a stream was now a cascade that sprayed us with
mist when we went near to fetch water. I loved to stand beside the
loud fall, and when I was wet to strip my clothes from me and dry
them in front of our fire.</p>

<p>I had made a basin of clay to catch the runnel of our stream and
make it easy to lift water even in dry weather. It survived the
first violent flood. The burn came down so full that it overleaped
the trough to fall in gouts and thunder yards away from the foot of
the cliff. Then the rain abated, yielding to a steady drizzle, and
the burn went down; its force came directly on my cistern and
washed it away in a few moments. I had no more work to do indoors.
Terry was busy cooking, and cleaning and drying wet clothes. I was
idle and miserable. When I ventured out to view my peats or to
fetch in firewood my clothes were wetted but never soaked. They had
to be taken off and dried as if they were thoroughly wet. The cave
was perpetually festooned with my steaming clothes; their smell
pervaded the place; we could not move without brushing our faces
against dank cloth.</p>

<p>I was full of ambitious plans for a day or two.</p>

<p>'We could easily make a water-wheel with one of the back-wheels
of the car,' I told Terry, 'couple it up to the dynamo, and give
ourselves electric light.'</p>

<p>'We could do that later,' she said in her most matter-of-fact
voice. 'Do you mind running out with this basin of dirty
water?'</p>

<p>She was very careful that we should always throw out our slops a
long way from the cave. I was tempted to fling down the dishwater
at the very door of the cave but I was in the mood to nurse a
grievance rather than air it. I walked out bare-headed. Terry came
running after me with a coat.</p>

<p>'Put this on, Hugh,' she bade me.</p>

<p>'I don't want it,' I told her, and walked a couple of hundred
yards before I emptied the basin.</p>

<p>'What were you saying about electric light?' she asked brightly
on my return. 'Take off your jacket, boy, you're wringing wet.'</p>

<p>'I am not,' I retorted.</p>

<p>'Could we make a water-wheel?' she asked after a pause.</p>

<p>'What's the good of talking about it?' I wanted to know.</p>

<p>'I would like to know, Hugh.'</p>

<p>All my resentment gathered itself against the plaintiveness of
her voice.</p>

<p>'And what's the use of planning as if we were to be here for
ever,' I cried.</p>

<p>Christ, and if she died, what hell of trifles I'd inhabit,
recalling such words.</p>

<p>'That's true,' she agreed. 'Is it still coming down?'</p>

<p>'My peats will be washed away,' I complained.</p>

<p>'We can cut more.'</p>

<p>'It's easy for you to say that!' I exclaimed. 'It's not your
labour that's wasting. If the rain came through the roof and messed
up what you've done in the cave&mdash;'</p>

<p>'The peats mayn't be spoiled.'</p>

<p>'How could they escape being spoiled? This weather may carry on
for months. A pretty pickle we'll be in then, without fuel for
winter.'</p>

<p>All past and over, deep buried in the mind, ready to be
remembered. Terry, I wish my heart would break and burst itself
with grief for hurting you.</p>

<p>The weather faired this afternoon. We went out hoping to
discover a cave or tented rocks near our own cave where our peats
could be stowed in safety. The simplest course would be to build a
stack either on the top of the rock near the moss or beside our
cave but a stack large enough to outlast winter could not possibly
be camouflaged with heathery turves; it is necessary to find a
hiding-place.</p>

<p>The air, washed by the rain, was clear and fresh, and the
farthest distances were bright in the sun; we looked through the
limpid miles of air to the Cairngorms and the Monadhliahs; this
air, like a sea of purifying waters, washed the green earth and the
rocky hills. The ground was sopping wet; each shallow gully that we
reached had its gurly torrent. We took off our shoes and stockings
to splash barefoot through the burns and the velvet moss. I had
never seen the country so verdant, under a bluer sky. The
predominant yellows and browns of the moor seemed to have altered,
as if the rain had changed them, or the air like glass altered
their aspect.</p>

<p>We found no cave but Terry discovered an enormous boulder with a
vertical face turned towards the cliff. We clambered to the top of
the boulder where heather and grass had found root, to survey our
realm. Our bare legs dangled over the edge. It was so still and
clear that we could hear lambs bleating in the meadows of the
Spey.</p>

<p>'Perhaps they're going to clip,' I said to Terry.</p>

<p>'Did you ever hear anything so clear and far away?' she
asked.</p>

<p>The noise of bleating came up to us from the distance like the
imagined sounds of a story.</p>

<p>'Like the goat in Daudet's story,' I said. 'Do you remember when
the wolf came, and every noise that the kid knew was quiet, and its
master gave up blowing his horn. "Come home! come home!"'</p>

<p>'I've heard rooks like that,' she said, 'in the trees in a
valley.'</p>

<p>Our ears, which the noise of rain and streams and wind had
dulled, began to listen for the birds and beasts, and like a wave
the cry of whaups, the calling grouse, each sound that rose from
the moor or descended from the lift, welled in upon us and we
listened with all our souls; our hearts were freed from their
discontent by the large harmony of freedom that our neighbours made
around us in this place.</p>

<p>'We talk quite casually now about spending winter here,' Terry
said after a long silence.</p>

<p>'If we build our stack against the up side of this rock,' I
said, 'it would be hidden from everywhere unless some one came
right up to the cliff, and in that case we ourselves would be seen.
It's strange that we haven't seen a shepherd amongst the
sheep.'</p>

<p>'I can't worry or care about anything on a day like this,' she
answered.</p>

<p>'I feel as if I had lived all my life here,' I said.</p>

<p>'I was never happier than I am just now&mdash;it's wrong of me,'
she said, 'it's wicked to be so happy.'</p>

<p>'What's wrong in it?' I asked fiercely. 'Great God, what hell is
in the world when happiness is a crime? There's hope for the world
that has happiness in it. If it was all hate and rage it would go
like a heap of corruption mouldering itself to nothing with its own
rottenness.'</p>

<p>'Other people deserve happiness and haven't it,' she said with a
sigh. 'Hugh&mdash;you won't be very angry with me&mdash;you won't
think I'm silly&mdash;'</p>

<p>I shook my head and answered, 'Not this day, Terry.'</p>

<p>She smiled at that.</p>

<p>'And other days?' she inquired.</p>

<p>'What were you going to say?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Hugh&mdash;I'd like to see our house. It's a foolish
whim&mdash;and we've so much to do&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Why do you want to see the house?' I demanded.</p>

<p>'I can't get things out of my head, somehow,' she answered in a
low voice. 'I lie awake, many a night, wondering what has happened,
wondering what grief's abroad and us here, safe, us here, happy. It
might be time for us to go back, Hugh. We might be able to do some
good.'</p>

<p>'It's not the house you want to see,' I said.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed I want to see our house, our own house, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'It's a long journey and there's risk of danger, Terry,' I told
her. 'If you like I'll go and spy&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And leave me here alone! No, no, you couldn't do that. Why,
it's not so very far. When can we go, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'When I've stacked my peats,' I told her grimly. 'I'm not taking
any more risks with the weather.'</p>

<p>We sat for a space in silence, but it was with thoughts of our
fellow-creatures, and the future, that our minds now engaged
themselves; the singing birds in the birch wood sang their heedless
song unheeded. We were mortal human folk, and all our work, all our
home-making in the cave, all our happiness on this day of June,
though it was sweet, did not divide us from our human fellows nor
obliterate their woe.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>22 JUNE</h2>

<p>OUR PEATS WERE less badly spoiled than we expected to find. We
set them up on edge to dry and while those that I had already cut
were weathering I delved a great many more. Terry took them from my
spade and set them flat on bare rocks to grow firm. When they were
fit to handle without breaking she brought them to the edge of the
cliff above the boulder we had discovered. The rock here was barely
thirty feet high, and if we could make a basket it would be easy to
lower the peats at the end of a rope. I returned to the birch wood
for a stout branch which I bent into a hoop two feet in diameter.
We stretched a deer skin across the hoop and when ropes had been
attached to it we had a primitive basket. Terry waited at the foot
of the cliff to receive the loads I let down to her. She piled the
peats beside the boulder ready for stacking. In a week of hard work
we had a sizable stack, big enough, I reckoned, to last us six
months. We decided to wait until after we had visited our house
before we cut a further supply. We might not need them. We were
loath to spend labour in vain.</p>

<p>Our backs were sore with bending over the peats. We had grown
soft during our rainy days 'idleness and we rested from working on
the 19th of June. We slept in the sun, we wakened to inquire at
each other, with many a supposition, how the peopled world had
fared. We were both oppressed with a sense of crisis. The things we
had left and fled to escape were never out of our minds since we
decided to go to our house. Sometimes I said, forgetting the guns
we heard,' Suppose there was never any war, suppose we ran away
from the shadow of a fear&mdash;' But it did not require Terry's
eyes to persuade me of what I dreaded to believe.</p>

<p>There have been times when our moods owed their birth to the
weather; often when we are dull a change of weather instructs us in
the cause of our lethargy. But on this sweet day, untroubled by
wind or cloud, we were ill at ease for no cause save the anxiety of
our minds; when we slept it was to waken with another question on
our lips, a new imagining half-formed and dangerous in our
heads.</p>

<p>'Another day past,' I said when night came. 'Another step
towards the grave.'</p>

<p>'Why should I try to hide and make pretence?' Terry said
suddenly. 'I'm half-distracted with anxiety, Hugh, and every moment
a new dread pushes out the old&mdash;oh, Hugh! what dreadful things
may have happened while we've been here.'</p>

<p>'I could go alone,' I said slowly. 'Who knows what has
chanced?'</p>

<p>'I'm going too,' she said.</p>

<p>'We're lucky to have each other,' I murmured. 'What a poor
wavering fool I'd be lacking you, Terry.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad you're happy with me,' she answered gently.</p>

<p>Before we fell asleep for the night, after we had turned a dozen
times in our hammock, and lain still for minutes by force of will,
to keep from waking the wakeful other, I sat up and whispered,
'Terry!'</p>

<p>'Hugh! are you waking? I've been longing to speak to you but I
was loath to disturb you.'</p>

<p>'I can't sleep, Terry.'</p>

<p>'We slept too much through the day.'</p>

<p>'It's not that. My head won't stop thinking&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Och, sleep, my bairn, my dear,' she bade me. 'What is it
troubles you, then?'</p>

<p>'Vain thoughts,' I said heavily.</p>

<p>I felt her hand touch my face lightly.</p>

<p>'Hush you and don't fret,' she murmured, 'sleep and forget pain;
what is it troubles you? sleep, and be still.'</p>

<p>She began to sing, in her small thin voice:</p>

<p>Hush a ba birdie, croom, croom,</p>

<p>Hush a ba birdie, croom,</p>

<p>The sheep are gane tae the silver wood,</p>

<p>And the cows are gane tae the broom, the broom.</p>

<p>Hush a ba birdie, croom, croom,</p>

<p>Hush a ba birdie, bye,</p>

<p>The bells are ringing, the birds are singing,</p>

<p>The wild deer come galloping by.</p>

<p>'Am I bothering you, Hugh?' she asked after her song was done.
'Would you prefer me to keep quiet?'</p>

<p>She must have sensed me shaking my head, since she could not
have seen, and I had no words. She began to sing again:</p>

<p>Hush and baloo, baby,</p>

<p>Hush and baloo,</p>

<p>A' the lave's in their beds,</p>

<p>I'm hushing you.</p>

<p>Shortly I slept, to waken at dawn and creep out of the hammock.
I was half-dressed when Terry sat up and said in a shrill
frightened voice:</p>

<p>'Hugh! Where are you, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Here,' I answered, going over to her.</p>

<p>She put her arms round my neck and clung to me.</p>

<p>'I must have been dreaming,' she whispered, 'I thought&mdash;I
had a dreadful dream; Hugh&mdash;stay with me!'</p>

<p>'I'm here, I'm beside you,' I said. 'There's nothing to be
afraid of, Terry.'</p>

<p>'It's to-day we're going,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered.</p>

<p>'Is it time to go?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Not till night,' I replied. 'I'm going out for a stag. We must
have a full larder waiting for us when we come home.'</p>

<p>'I'm going with you,' she cried.</p>

<p>'But Terry&mdash;' I expostulated.</p>

<p>'Light the lamp,' she bade me; 'light the lamp till I see to put
on my clothes. Take me with you to-day, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'You'll be tired to death,' I persisted. 'We've a long journey
before us at the end of the day. There's a lot to do, getting
ready&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I must go,' she said.</p>

<p>We were well out on the hill before daylight arrived. As we came
to an eminence from which the valley of the Truim could be glimpsed
as a dark narrow expanse between the hills a distant rumbling
caught my attention.</p>

<p>'There are trains still,' I told Terry. 'Don't you hear it?
Coming down from the summit of Drumochter Pass. Perhaps we'll catch
sight of it.'</p>

<p>We sat down to wait.</p>

<p>'It's going at a hell of a pace,' I said. 'There didn't use to
be an express at this hour.' As I spoke a glare of light swept into
the valley and went hurtling northwards with a roar and a flare of
fire-illumined steam. In a moment it was out of sight behind the
Binion hill, and the noise receded towards Newtonmore, and our
straining ears heard it no more. It was so calm we could hear a
cock crowing in Dalwhinnie. So there were cocks betraying the dawn
in our forsaken world. But scarcely had it crowed than we heard
another train surmount Drumochter and accelerate downhill, to flame
before us, and in its turn vanish.</p>

<p>We waited on our hill-top, as if struck to stone by expectation,
and the golden day came up and gilded our peak, and every peak, but
we had eyes for nothing save the trains that fled north before our
gaze. Three of them followed the first, thundering down the slope,
leaping into our view with a light that always took us by surprise
though we were always waiting for it, vanishing from sound and
sight into the emboskened valley of the Spey.</p>

<p>'God knows what that means,' I muttered.</p>

<p>'Easy to know what it means,' Terry said bitterly. 'War's no
slugabed.'</p>

<p>We got up heavily to stalk a deer. A lucky chance saved us from
much exertion. We killed a young beast all alone a mile beneath the
peak whence we had viewed the trains. Terry hid in a rough hollow
while I killed the deer and bled it.</p>

<p>'I wished we hadn't to kill it to-day,' she said.</p>

<p>I shrugged.</p>

<p>'We have to live,' I said.</p>

<p>She shouldered the rifle with an air of distaste.</p>

<p>The dawn was red and grey behind the eastern hills. Dawn, lief
exorcist of care, lightened our hearts. As we went home we stumbled
on a deer-calf in its couch.</p>

<p>'The lovely, lovely creature!' Terry cried, stooping over
it.</p>

<p>'Don't lay a hand on it!' I warned her.</p>

<p>She looked up at me; her cheeks were wet.</p>

<p>'Would its mother forsake it?' she asked. 'Good morning, calfie,
I'm glad I saw you.'</p>

<p>We spent the remainder of the morning in preparations for our
journey. We boiled venison to carry with us, as well as a piece to
eat when we arrived home again. We rolled blankets in our
ground-sheet and fetched a slab of stone to cover the mouth of our
cave. We talk, and say many things to hide what our minds are
always saying. Our tongues ran like rivers as we worked, and all
the while those trains were in our ears.</p>

<p>'I suppose lots of people would fancy that this sort of life was
full of adventures, Hugh,' Terry remarked.</p>

<p>'I'm sure they would,' I agreed.</p>

<p>'They say folk in caves and wildernesses and desert islands
escape all the trivialities of life.'</p>

<p>'I've heard so,' I agreed.</p>

<p>'What fools people are!' she cried. 'Folk in caves and desert
islands must be far more commonplace and matter of fact than any
one ever needs to be in a town. In a town you run to the shop at
the corner&mdash;oh, my God, what is happening in towns?' she burst
out.</p>

<p>'People take their notions of strange ways of life from books,'
I suggested in an effort to save myself as well as her from
thinking of the horror that would not be gainsaid.</p>

<p>'I wonder if there are still books being sold, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Not mine, I'll be bound,' I returned.</p>

<p>'As soon as people discover that there's nothing martial in war
they turn to books,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not to mine,' I insisted. 'What! read social histories when
they've war!'</p>

<p>I could not be quiet, I could not hold my tongue, pretending
that the world was as it had been.</p>

<p>'Maybe London's a heap like Babylon,' I burst out, 'and the
hoodie crows glut themselves in the streets of Glasgow.'</p>

<p>'We'd have seen signs,' she answered slowly.</p>

<p>'Maybe it's all a false alarm,' I said.</p>

<p>'The guns? the trains?' she returned significantly.</p>

<p>'We'll soon know,' I said.</p>

<p>'What?' she demanded. 'What do you think we'll find, Hugh? God
knows,' she answered herself. 'Why are we going?'</p>

<p>'Why are we here?' I cried wildly. 'We'll come back&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Yes, Hugh, we'll come back.'</p>

<p>'And live here, knowing nothing.'</p>

<p>'We might be in worse places, Hugh. And know worse things than
nothing.'</p>

<p>'Our stores will go done at last&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We must get more.'</p>

<p>'More? How?'</p>

<p>'How? Take them if we can&mdash;go where they are&mdash;if we
can't get them, live without them as the beasts do.'</p>

<p>'And die the way they do, for lack of food, for lack of
warmth&mdash;die like beasts.'</p>

<p>'If I could make you patient, Hugh. You expect to-morrow to
solve all our questions, to tell us all that's happened. It won't
do that, Hugh. We'll see our house, we'll gather some of the things
we ought to have brought originally&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We're bound to discover&mdash;' I broke in.</p>

<p>'What?' she asked with scorn. 'That we've done right? Don't you
know that already? If we haven't done right, nothing will ever
change it. All you'll see there,'&mdash;she extended her arm to the
north&mdash;'is the backwash of trouble; all you'll hear is rumour
as various as our own minds make.'</p>

<p>'Nothing more, nothing at all?' I said. 'Then we can stay, and
doubt, and never be sure, here till we die.'</p>

<p>'If I could save you from building up hopes of finding more than
we'll ever find out,' she said, 'it would make me glad even if we
discovered&mdash;even if we discovered deadly things.'</p>

<p>'Then we had better stay where we are. At least we'll see signs
of war&mdash;we'll see trains&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Must you have signs?' she demanded. 'Must you put your hands in
the holes of the nails, before you believe?'</p>

<p>I stared out over the signless land.</p>

<p>'I can't help the way I'm made,' I said at last. 'I can't feel
here, in my heart, that the thing has happened, until I see its
mark.'</p>

<p>'The mark is in your face and on your heart already, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'To live in doubt&mdash;' I whispered.</p>

<p>'Hugh,' she said in low tones. 'It wasn't merely to escape from
war and conscription we came here, not to avoid mere facts like
murder and outrage and poison gas.'</p>

<p>'What then?' I inquired. 'Was it self-begotten fears that chased
us? Were we so cowardly?'</p>

<p>'Out of the world that uses such means and thinks such
thoughts,' she said, 'out from amongst men who hate each
other&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Fleeing from the wrath to come,' I quoted mockingly. 'Discreet
but not valiant. So we're tuppenny evangelists awaiting the dawn of
peace, hey?'</p>

<p>'Fleeing from the wrath that is,' she said.</p>

<p>'And all the captains and all the kings and all the great men
shall hide themselves,' I rattled on. 'We've certainly rocks enough
to call down on our heads, Terry. The new Armageddon.'</p>

<p>'Hugh!' she pleaded.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I returned defensively.</p>

<p>'And if there's no war, and all's peaceful,' she said, composing
herself, 'we'll go back to our house.'</p>

<p>I looked at her without speaking.</p>

<p>'And stand on the lip of hell,' she went on drearily, 'waiting
for whispers, waiting for war, war more horrible the longer it's
delayed.'</p>

<p>'No,' I said in a low voice. 'So here we sit till the
millennium,' I said a moment later. 'What if it comes in winter
time, Terry, and we can't get down for storm, like old Macdonald of
Glencoe in his day of pacification, or we can't hear the sound of
the call when the Prince of Peace sounds his rally for the noise of
wind and storm?'</p>

<p>'I think we should be making ready,' she said in a breaking
voice. Then she cried, 'Hugh! Hugh! it rends my heart to hear you
mocking and bitter.'</p>

<p>'Does it gladden my own?' I asked. I could say nothing to
comfort her. I stood staring at the ground like one transfixed by
the shafts of despair while she went silently away to put on her
shoes for the journey.</p>

<p>We prepared for the going with mechanical care. I took our
ammunition from the cave and hid it in a cleft of the rock. I
cleaned the lenses of my telescope and set out the .22 and slipped
the bolt of the .303 into my pocket. If we returned to find an
intruder I had rather not meet him armed with our own weapon.</p>

<p>We departed in the twilight of the 20th of June. It was a rare
evening. Many trout were rising on Loch Coulter; we passed sheep
that scarcely lifted their heads to look at us, so greedily were
they feeding with their lambs amongst them. No sheep was shorn. We
crossed the road, we climbed into the triangle of low hills which
divides the valley of the Truim from the Spey, and on the approach
of morning we lay down amongst birch trees, in the security of a
wilderness of rocks above Glentruim to sleep until night made
journeying safe once more. There, high over the Truim's noisy
undiscernible stream, we saw the well-known valley, and heard
cattle lowing, and a car went down the north road. It was like the
quietest day of other years. When the sun descended we rolled up
our bundle. Our route was dangerous amongst trees and rocks and we
made slow progress; clouds of midges tormented us. We did not reach
our house until past midnight. We could not see a light anywhere in
the valley. The absence of lights seemed ominous; yet it was late,
and country folk go early to bed, saving their lamps: midsummer had
never lights that I could recall, save the sky, but I was afraid
when I saw nothing but darkness in the glen. I searched in vain for
a glimmer that would show men were awake in their houses.</p>

<p>'Hugh!' Terry whispered when we came to the familiar gate. It
was open. 'We must have forgotten to lock the gate,' she said under
her breath.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the postman left it open,' I returned in the same
voice. Her hand touched and clasped mine. We tiptoed up the path. I
thought that the door was open and I checked my pace.</p>

<p>'Are you seeing anything, Hugh?' Terry whispered. 'Can you make
out&mdash;what are you seeing?'</p>

<p>'Nothing,' I lied, with my eyes fixed on the open door.</p>

<p>'I can't bear to go farther,' she muttered. 'I'm
frightened.'</p>

<p>'There's nothing to fear,' I said gently. 'We've come too far to
go back.'</p>

<p>I was afraid to death myself but not with fear of danger. Terry
let go my hand to fall on her knees beside a flower-plot.</p>

<p>'I'm going to take plants back with me,' she said, and then,
'It's all trampled down!' she cried. She stared about her until she
perceived the black gap of the open door.</p>

<p>'We locked the door,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm not certain if we did,' I began. 'In the hurry&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We did! I know we did! Hugh, the kitchen window's broken.'</p>

<p>There was something horrible about the silence of the house,
about our petrified silent vigil at the door of our own house. I
felt suddenly desolate.</p>

<p>'We should go away,' I said in a choked voice, but when I spoke
anger took hold of me, and I ran to the door and went in. A foul
air greeted me. Terry came at my heels.</p>

<p>I knew my way through the rooms in darkest pitch night and I
hurried from the lobby to the kitchen. My feet made a grating noise
on the floor as I walked, and I heard broken glass break under my
boots.</p>

<p>'What's happened here?' I asked aloud. 'What's happened here?' I
demanded again of the barren air.</p>

<p>'Light a match, Hugh,' Terry told me. When the light flared up I
heard her cry, 'Oh!'</p>

<p>Our first impulse was to run away and leave for ever that fouled
gutted house that was our home. We stayed to glut our rage and
lacerate our hurt, going from room to room, calling each other to
see each new defilement that we found. We fell on our knees on the
filthy floors to turn over the broken rubbish gathered there, to
pick fragments from the heap of muck and say, This was our picture,
'and,' That was your party dress, Terry,' and, 'Don't you remember
when we bought this, Hugh?' Everything we owned lay on the floor,
trampled, smeared with the dirt of miry boots, broken. The very
walls were smeared with muck and our chairs had been torn to bits
to make firewood. The fireplaces were overflowing with ashes and
bits of wood, bits of picture-frames, bits of trunks, charred
papers. Dishes and bottles broken into fragments littered the
kitchen floor. Our books met us everywhere we moved. I struck
matches mechanically, holding each match until it burnt my fingers,
then lighting the next and putting the burnt stump carefully back
into the box as I had learned to do on the hill or in our cave.
Terry came to me with a little broken Dresden shepherdess in her
cupped hands.</p>

<p>'It's almost not broken at all,' she said in a queer voice. Her
face was haggard, her eyes wild. They went out as the match I held
went out, and then they were before me again.</p>

<p>'Throw it away,' I told her harshly, 'throw the damned thing
away.'</p>

<p>'Will we go now?' she said in the same strained voice. 'Will we
go now?' she insisted in rising tones. 'There's nothing you want to
take with you, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Nothing that's been touched&mdash;' I managed to say, and could
find no more words.</p>

<p>'There's my good frock,' she cried, pouncing on a tattered
fragment of silk on the floor.</p>

<p>'It's time for us to go,' I said in a miserable voice. 'Give me
your hand, Terry.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I can see the way,' she returned. 'Are you there, Hugh?
Don't leave me.'</p>

<p>I took her hand. I could feel the pieces of the china image in
her clenched fist.</p>

<p>'Are you taking this with you?' I asked.</p>

<p>'My shepherdess!' she said in surprised tones.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I cried. I was distracted, scarcely knowing what I
did.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, Hugh?' she asked in the same astonished
voice. 'Come, it'll soon be day, we must go, have you the
rifle?'</p>

<p>'Terry!' I said, catching her by the arms, 'Terry! what's the
matter with you?'</p>

<p>'You're hurting me,' she complained. 'Let go my arm, Hugh.'</p>

<p>I could dimly perceive her pinched features in the June
darkness. She struggled to be free, but I held her still.</p>

<p>'You're hurting me,' she said angrily a second time. A moment
later her voice fell to a childish complaint, 'Oh, my head!' She
gave up struggling and began to sob. I held her in my arms with her
face close to me. The wild-briar on our wall, broken though its
branches were, made a faint sweet familiar smell. Soon she fell
from sobbing to tears, and then she murmured, 'I'm sleepy, Hugh,
oh, so sleepy; take me home, Hugh.'</p>

<p>We returned to our cave, walking all day without attempting to
hide. Terry was asleep on her feet long before we reached the cave.
Helping her occupied me. Sometimes I carried her over miry ground
and rocks and burns. I staggered to and fro like a drunk man. I
could scarcely waken her when I laid her down.</p>

<p>So we came home. We lay down to sleep, but I could not sleep. I
rose at dusk to make a meal for Terry and myself. She wakened too,
her face all swollen with tears. I can hear her in the cave behind
me, cooking and cleaning as I write.</p>

<p>I have no tears. My eyes are dry. Oh, Terry, Terry, our walls
are broken and the garden spoiled.</p>

<p>Memory has no surcease. Each battered trinket on the filthy
floor confronts me. This longest day will never end.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>5 JULY</h2>

<p>IT IS THE FIFTH of July. In an hour or so we shall have spent
three full months here.</p>

<p>'It doesn't seem like months,' Terry said when I reminded her of
the date of our coming.</p>

<p>'It scarcely feels like time at all,' I agreed. I had a
momentary vision of our tiny figures struggling under their load
across the moor in that April night.</p>

<p>'The nights are beginning to draw in,' Terry went on. 'I can see
a difference in the light already, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said with a sigh, 'the year's going downhill now; we
must attend to our firewood though the weather is so hot. Soon
it'll be autumn; we can't count on dry weather after August. And
then winter&mdash;I hate the turn in the day, Terry. June's so
fine&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No horse-flies and no thunder,' she assented with a smile.
'Those brutes of clegs! I'm all swollen with their bites!'</p>

<p>We have done no work to-day. Our peats are cut and stacked, in
spite of the clegs, and we are content to rest.</p>

<p>We went down to Loch Coulter in the breathless morning to bathe
before the heat of the day arrived. I had the .22 with me. I carry
it habitually whenever I leave the cave. We heard black cock
drumming on a green lawn amongst the birches. I slipped away to
stalk the birds, leaving Terry splattering in the shallows of a
sandy cove. I got near enough to my quarry to see how they danced;
with their fan tails spread out like a turkey cock's and their
wings trailing the ground they advanced and retreated, head to
head; they danced and drummed; sometimes a pair would face each
other with their heads lowered to the ground and their eyes a
couple of inches apart, until one of the birds gave way, and their
see-saw backwards and forwards dance recommenced.</p>

<p>They heard me in the brushwood and flew away. I was not deeply
vexed. We had meat enough in the cave.</p>

<p>We are growing familiar with the habits of our neighbours. We
know where the black cock dance. I have seen the eagles make
homewards for their eyrie in the Little Durc, and followed them
until I came to the head of that canyon and saw the nest, and
smelled the stench of rotting game. I know the solitary hill-side
trees where hoodies nest, and have nested perhaps for a century;
the ravens make their home in the rock above our cave. We never
walk barefoot in the birch wood since I killed an adder, slender
and vicious and as full of fat as a pike, beside an ant-heap
there.</p>

<p>'It gives me a shudder to look at it,' Terry declared when I
brought it for her to see. 'What possessed you to bring it here,
Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Don't you like it?' I teased her. 'I think it's pretty. And
full of fat.'</p>

<p>'Why should pike and snakes and wicked brutes like them be so
well lined?' she wanted to know.</p>

<p>'The wicked grow fat,' I said, and laughed.</p>

<p>'You're not very fat yourself, Hugh,' she declared, looking at
me with a critical eye. 'But you're looking well, I never saw you
looking so healthy. You're as brown as a berry&mdash;'</p>

<p>When the sun went down to-day we made a fire of sticks outside
the cave and ate a little.</p>

<p>'If this hot weather continues we'll save our stores,' Terry
declared.</p>

<p>'It's almost a fortnight since we came back,' I said slowly.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she returned, 'a long fortnight, long in passing. Looking
back, our journey's like the bad weather in June,' she said a
little later, 'dark and miserable&mdash;and past.'</p>

<p>'It's past then?' I inquired, looking intently at her quiet
face.</p>

<p>'It was sore, sore for a while,' she murmured. 'Our poor
house&mdash;it did us good to see it though it hurt, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'It brought us to earth,' I asserted grimly. 'It taught us that
our game was earnest. We were like children playing at a
picnic.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it did more, far more than that, Hugh,' she said.</p>

<p>We were dead beat when we reached the cave after our journey. We
slept uneasy hours and wakened more tired than when we lay down.
Our bones ached, our minds were drunk with fatigue, we moved in a
stupor.</p>

<p>Everything I did was wrong and clumsy. When I reached out my
hand to lift a pot or a cup I fumbled, and my nerves were on edge
expecting the thing I caught to fall from my grasp and break. The
least hindrance put me in a rage, and from sudden temper I fell
into silence whose outward appearance was surly, whose inward cause
and accompaniment was misery. Terry moved through the cave like a
ghost, wan and silent and apprehensive-eyed. I would have given the
world to be able to speak, to comfort her and unburden my own
trouble. I was spell-bound to silence and the best I could fashion
my lips to say was, 'We must count our stores. It's past time we
estimated how long we can live on them.'</p>

<p>I laid out our hoard of boxes and parcels in the middle of the
cave and Terry reckoned how much they held and how long the
essential things like flour and salt would last us. We began by
setting aside the stuff of which we had sufficient to last an
indefinite time. The future was so uncertain and overclouded that a
year ahead seemed like old age to youth, a fabulous distance
away.</p>

<p>Our ammunition came first in this category. If I kept on using
it as carefully as I had in the past, I could not conceive an end
to it; I suppose we were desperately avoiding thought of the far
future. If we planned years ahead, we were dooming ourselves
irrevocably to a life of exile.</p>

<p>'We needn't look so far ahead,' I answered when Terry asked how
long the ammunition would last. 'Every other thing that makes life
sufferable will be finished long before the ammunition is used
up.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' she agreed. 'There's not much point in planning for
the distant future when a thousand things may happen to upset our
arrangements.'</p>

<p>'How much salt have we?' I inquired.</p>

<p>We had sufficient to carry us on to spring at our present rate
of use, but, as I pointed out, in winter we would have storms and
we must salt a store of meat against them.</p>

<p>'And how we are going to do it is beyond my imagination,' I went
on, 'for we have neither tub nor barrel.'</p>

<p>'Can't we dry-salt the meat and hang it from the rafters?' Terry
asked. 'Or if the winter's hard meat will keep in the snow.'</p>

<p>Our flour likewise was enough for seven or eight months. 'We've
been using a quarter of tea a week,' Terry said. 'We have no more
than three pounds remaining. We'll miss our tea when it's
done.'</p>

<p>'Then we must drink water and spare the tea,' I declared. 'What
about sugar?'</p>

<p>'We haven't used a great deal,' she replied. 'The condensed milk
has eked it out, but the milk's practically used up.'</p>

<p>'It's a luxury, anyway,' I declared.</p>

<p>'No doubt it is,' she agreed, 'but lots of things which are
luxuries in themselves become necessities when they are all
lacking. We can live without sugar and butter and vegetables, I
don't say we'll starve while we have meat and flour, but I don't
believe we can keep healthy. Our jam's a luxury&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How much is left?' I interrupted.</p>

<p>'Three jars; we used it heavily for a while. You were supping it
with a spoon, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'I never did!' I declared indignantly, and was forced to smile.
'How did you find out?' I asked.</p>

<p>'You forgot to clean the spoon,' she told me.</p>

<p>'It was very wicked and thoughtless of me,' I said. 'But oh,
Terry, I was so sick of meat! meat! meat! I thought I'd die for
something sweet.'</p>

<p>'I'm not blaming you,' she continued, 'but I was counting on the
jam to keep us healthy through the winter.'</p>

<p>'We can make more,' I informed her gleefully.</p>

<p>'Can we?' she cried. 'Is that true? Is there fruit
hereabouts?'</p>

<p>'Yes, cranberries,' I said, 'and probably crowberries and
blaeberries too, and I saw the averans in full flower on the top of
the Farrow; we'll get them in the autumn if the frost doesn't take
them. There'll be heaps of rowans and we could go down to the Spey
where the rasps grow. You need a lot of sugar for
rowans&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If we have enough sugar to preserve them, the sourer they are
the better for us,' Terry declared. 'That's a great load off my
mind.'</p>

<p>When we concluded the tale of our stores we knew that we had as
much salt and flour as would suffice us until spring.</p>

<p>'Then they're likely to outlast us,' I commented bitterly when
Terry told me her conclusion.</p>

<p>'The biscuits and the butter are nearly done,' she went on.</p>

<p>We have ten dozen eggs preserved. The ham is mostly all eaten.
Our vegetables are finished. The potatoes grew soft and Terry had
to throw most of them away. 'We've more of some things than we had
to begin with,' Terry said.</p>

<p>'That's a blessing,' I said ironically.</p>

<p>'Why are you angry with me, Hugh?' she asked. 'Why do you speak
to me as you do?'</p>

<p>'How do I speak to you?' I inquired with defensive
roughness.</p>

<p>'Are you tired of me?' she asked in low tones.</p>

<p>I stood staring at the floor of the cave with its litter of
tins. Though it drove a knife into my heart to see her sad and hurt
I could not help hurting her, and I waited a long minute before I
muttered, 'No.'</p>

<p>'What about tobacco?' she said in a strangled voice.</p>

<p>'It'll go done. Oh, what does it matter, what does anything
matter?'</p>

<p>'We can live well enough until spring,' she continued in the
same voice.</p>

<p>'And what then?' I demanded.</p>

<p>I felt her hand on my arm, and her voice, full of tears, asked
gently:</p>

<p>'Is it the house, Hugh?' Then she came near me and said: 'Look
at me, Hugh.'</p>

<p>I raised my eyes unwillingly. My cheeks were burning hot.</p>

<p>'My dear, my heart, my love, my only love,' she whispered. 'I
wish I could help you&mdash;can't you tell me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What'll I tell you?' I cried wildly, 'that every mortal thing
is drear and hopeless and my heart's dead in my body, dead as a
stone, and I wish I was dead too.'</p>

<p>'Hush, hush,' she entreated, 'we've each other still.'</p>

<p>'How can I hush?' I raged. 'We're here for ever, Terry, we'll
never escape, we'll starve and rot in this den, this hole in the
rocks. Was it for this we were born, to live like beasts without
hope?'</p>

<p>'We'll go and cut more peats,' she said gently. 'Soon it'll be
better, soon we'll be done with remembering the pain of the thing
that's in our heads, a little time changes the worst things out of
their shape and makes us masters again in the house of our own
minds.'</p>

<p>I was deserted suddenly by the raging energy, compounded of
anger and pain, which possessed me since we returned from our
journey; it made me fly from one task to another, now cutting a
bench of peats in the bog, again counting the time our stores would
last, then trailing roots of bog-fir from their mossy resting-place
beside the loch; it left me and I grew so tired that I could
scarcely stand on my feet.</p>

<p>'What's the good?' I asked wearily when Terry said we ought to
go to our peats.</p>

<p>'Are you tired, Hugh?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I'm blind with tiredness,' I answered. 'Tired and sick.'</p>

<p>'Then rest,' she urged. 'You've been overdoing it of late. No
human being could stand up to the pace you were setting
yourself.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Terry, Terry!' I cried. 'It's a dreadful thing to be
outcasts and fugitives.'</p>

<p>'Other people have been fugitives before us,' she said.</p>

<p>'We'll go to the peats,' I muttered.</p>

<p>We climbed to the hill-top and I cut the turf from a new bank of
peat. The day was hot but fresh with a brisk wind from the south.
There were as yet no clegs on the high ground to plague us and make
the heat of summer a scourge instead of a pleasure. The spade went
smoothly into the black moist bank, the sun shone in its azure
world, the wind came sweetly over peaks that still kept snow in
their north corries facing us. My spirits rose, gloom lightened,
and as my strength returned and I worked I felt the content of the
summer day that reigned over our country enter my heart. And Terry,
with a red handkerchief knotted at the corners on her head to keep
her black hair from her eyes and the force of the sun from her
brain, bare-armed and bare-legged and eager, ran back and fore with
peats in her arms to spread them out to dry. I commenced to feel
free from my nightmarish oppression. I could think clearly. In a
moment of realization when I knew that I was escaping from the
horror which preyed on me I let the spade fall from my hands. The
wind was like water on my arms. I breathed the air like a blind man
who with restored sight gazes on the clear outlined world. Terry
cried, 'Isn't it grand, up here, on the top of the world!'</p>

<p>'It's very fine,' I answered gravely. She began to laugh like a
happy child and dance amongst the peats, waving her bare
peat-smeared arms over her head.</p>

<p>We bathed in Loch Coulter; we lay at the mouth of our cave to
attend night's summer shade; we saw the rough hills climb up
against the sky and it grew dark enough for stars to shine. There
are moments when misery departs that require no voice; we waited in
silence until night reached its deepest, though it was only
twilight still.</p>

<p>'Our garden was no more our own than this,' Terry said.</p>

<p>'This!' I cried, startled. 'We made our garden,
Terry&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Poor garden!' she sighed. 'No one watering it in this
heat!'</p>

<p>'And all the weeds spreading like fire,' I took her up. 'I
wonder what creatures broke into the house, Terry.'</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>'Will we ever leave here?' I asked a few minutes later.</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she said. 'I scarcely care. We are free, here's
no fret nor rumours. Are you happier, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Happy? I don't know&mdash;I'm not unhappy.'</p>

<p>'You were unhappy.'</p>

<p>'What else could I be? Oh but we shouldn't have been so weak,
Terry, we shouldn't have let it overwhelm us. We came back without
a single thing to help us. After all our planning, after that long
journey, we came back without one of the things we went
for&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Excepting resolution,' she interrupted quietly.</p>

<p>'We didn't find out anything,' I continued.</p>

<p>We knew, without any evidence of our eyes and ears, but by the
instruction of instinct merely, that it was not the state of our
house by itself which appalled us and drove us back to the hills.
Our house was a portent of the world. That blind squalid fate which
happened to it, and involved us, was general, though we had no
proof to give our minds, assuring them they thought truly, or to
tell our hearts that the woe which lay on them was justly felt.
When we saw our house we knew, suddenly and without doubt, that it
had fellows more horridly destroyed, and we had fellows too. We
were afraid; we were overwhelmed by the knowledge of events that we
had never heard of, but for which our house stood as a token. I
remembered the lightless valley of the Spey.</p>

<p>On this day of passing June, throughout this night, we escaped
into the country where the sun and the moor existed by themselves;
and in this place, divorced from the land of men, we escaped from
fear and unhappiness. We were as the wild creatures of our wild
country.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>10 JULY</h2>

<p>WE HAVE BEEN gathering blaeberries for jam this evening in the
birch wood above Loch Coulter. Things ripen late here. We must be
thirteen hundred feet above sea-level and the flush of ripe berries
will not come for several days yet. Nevertheless we find bushes
hung with swollen blue-dusted fruit in sheltered hollows exposed to
the south and we have grown prudent enough to gather what fruit we
can at the earliest moment of ripening. If rain comes unexpectedly
the berries that are ripe will be spoiled for jam. Fruit is not so
plentiful that we can afford to let any go to waste.</p>

<p>We were very imprudent lately. When we arrived home from our
house, running to escape in broad daylight, we were past caring
whether we were seen. And even after we arrived at the cave we
continued to act as if nothing mattered except our unhappiness. We
went out to cut peats in a rage of energy that proved no anodyne as
if there were no other people in the world but ourselves. That
first stage passed, yet we grew no more cautious, for we were
filled with exaltation as blind as our despair.</p>

<p>I shudder now to think of the risks we ran. We cut our peats at
midday. I scoured the country for game at noon. We spent every
daylight hour in the open, as if we craved to be discovered.</p>

<p>Clegs were the instruments of caution, and halted our
thoughtless bravado. They appeared in the first days of July,
before we finished working in the peat-moss. They did not punish me
so viciously as they hurt Terry. Their bites raised lumps on her
and their poison, together with the aversion they created, made her
sick, while I took no great ill-effect from their venom. In spite
of my immunity I dreaded them fully as much as she did. They filled
me with loathing and, ridiculous as it seems, with fear. A single
cleg aiming itself at my arm was enough to make me fling down
whatever I had in my hand to beat the insect away with crazy
gestures.</p>

<p>The clegs made the moss untenable through the day. Each peat as
it dried seemed to make a resting-place for multitudes of the
brutes, and at our approach they rose in ravenous swarms. We
retreated and ventured out only at dusk when midges made a lesser
nuisance, or in the cool of daybreak.</p>

<p>We had been exalted, too highly exalted as we had been too
deeply depressed, when we emerged from the misery induced by our
journey. The clegs tempered our new delight in the country and in
our freedom. When they had driven us to work by night it occurred
to us that we should never have been abroad through the day. We had
been reckless and foolish. One grey morning, as I was lowering
peats in the basket, I bethought me of the risks we had been
running, and I hurried down to speak to Terry.</p>

<p>'Is anything wrong?' she asked anxiously, coming to meet me.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I cried, 'what in the world have we been thinking
about, these past weeks? Some one must have seen us. It's just
dawned on me&mdash;I was thinking about the clegs forcing us to
work at night&mdash;we ought to have been working by night.'</p>

<p>'I had the very same thought,' she returned. 'But if we were
seen we'd know by now&mdash;'</p>

<p>'If we weren't seen we've been lucky beyond our deserts,' I
declared.</p>

<p>Now everything we had done seemed conspicuous and rash. I
insisted on thatching the peat-stack with turves, although anyone
who came near enough to discern the stack must inevitably find our
cave. We have laughed since these careful days at our excess of
caution. We broke down the sides of our peat-moss to make my
excavation look as much like the untidy work of nature as possible.
We deferred bringing fir roots home until we found a secure
hiding-place for them. Terry plotted a strict routine of hours, for
meals and work and sleep.</p>

<p>We kept strictly to her arrangement for almost a week. We slept
from midday to dusk. Then we ate a light meal of a fried pancake
made with flour and a gull's egg; we allowed ourselves one egg a
day. We drank a cup of weak tea. When the blaeberries started to
ripen we added a dish of fruit to this our first meal of the
day.</p>

<p>The nights of early July were never so dark that we could not
see to work out of doors; even when the valleys were dim a
luminance in the sky made the peaks visible; one could have seen to
read small print by the light of the sky shining on the hill-top
where we cut our peats. The sun's progress past north to its rising
was marked by gaudy colours all round the northern horizon.</p>

<p>Sometimes we took a piece of boiled venison with us, in case we
grew hungry, but most nights we worked without more food until dawn
warned us to leave the moss. I remained for a while cutting peats
by myself while Terry descended to cook. In the new spirit of
caution that gripped us we cut a vast quantity of peats beyond what
we were ever likely to use. But, we said, no one knew how soon
winter might come on us, nor how long it would last.</p>

<p>We had an appetite for dinner. Game formed the staple of this
meal. Sometimes Terry pot-roasted a bit of venison haunch and made
a sort of Yorkshire pudding to accompany the meat; generally she
stewed the venison; we had venison and grouse, blue hill hares and
an occasional rabbit, black-cock, snipe, duck, plover and roe-deer.
We had no lack of quantity and variety so far as meat was
concerned. As soon as the blaeberries ripened we added them to our
dinner. Terry often made soup of a bone; we hunted the country
round for green stuff to put in the broth.</p>

<p>Our garden of nettles which grew over the ruins of an old house
was quickly stripped. We cooked the nettles like cabbage and used
the water in which they were boiled amongst our soups. The
nettle-pottage tasted as sweet as cabbage, but it came to an end.
We tried many queer messes thereafter, young grass in the soup,
birch leaves cooked like cabbage. We attempted to eat the latter
dish once only. But when we flung away the mess of boiled birch
leaves I recalled a trick of my boyhood. I made slots in the bark
of some birch trees and collected the spilling sap that flowed from
these cuts in milk-tins nailed to the trunks of the trees. We
supped the sap with a teaspoon as if it was medicine, and felt that
it was doing us good.</p>

<p>'Spring's the time for the sap,' I told Terry.</p>

<p>'We'll need it then,' she said.</p>

<p>We dug up the small nuts that grow at the root of a
white-flowered plant on grassy slopes, as I used to when I was a
boy.</p>

<p>The arrival of ripe blaeberries saved us from worrying about
scurvy.</p>

<p>'And after them come crowberries.' I said, 'and cranberries
then, and cloudberries. Terry, before we lack we'll go down to the
fields at Kinlochlaggan or Laggan Bridge and steal turnips, like
our neighbours the deer.'</p>

<p>'We'll have to,' she said simply.</p>

<p>When we had eaten dinner we bathed in Loch Coulter. If there was
time to spare before bright day arrived we set a line for pike. We
took food once again in mid-morning. We gave ourselves a precious
bannock of oatcake spread thinly with jam or thickly with deer-fat,
or we had scones that Terry baked on the griddle. We drank
water.</p>

<p>We often say, in wonder-struck tones after a plain bare meal,
that we never felt so well in all our lives before.</p>

<p>The strict routine lasted less than a week. We found, as we did
months ago, that this life does not permit the unyielding
governance of a time-table. We have gradually made our routine
elastic again, though we keep generally to our framework of hours.
We take no risks. The dread of discovery is very present in our
minds though we scarcely know why we are afraid to be seen or what
discovery entails. Our first instinct, when anything surprises us,
is to hide.</p>

<p>'We are like wild animals,' I said when Terry marvelled at our
continual alertness. 'Always watching, always scared, always ready
to run and hide. No one will surprise us now, Terry, we've got back
old lost instincts for danger.'</p>

<p>'We'll be pretty objects if we go back amongst people,' I went
on. 'We'll be dodging and starting and turning our heads every
minute of the day.'</p>

<p>'We won't like it, when we go back,' she took me up.</p>

<p>'How?' I wanted to know.</p>

<p>'You may hate solitude, Hugh, but it changes you. When we go
back we'll be like country folk in a city. We'll be crowded, and
overlooked, and choked for lack of room. We won't take well to a
house&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Like the tinkers,' I laughed.</p>

<p>'Choking for lack of room to breathe,' she went on
seriously.</p>

<p>'If we go back,' I interrupted her. 'And if we go back there may
not be so many people round us to crowd us as there used to
be.'</p>

<p>We stared at each other, and I could read in her eyes, as she
read in mine, the fear and despair that we strove daily to hide
even from ourselves. We could not cheat ourselves all the time, and
even when we seemed to forget the reason for our escape, those guns
we heard spoke to our secret minds, and the thought of war
disturbed our inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>'What are we slaving for?' I cried. 'What are we arranging and
planning for? I tell you it's to kill thought that we're racing and
hurrying, Terry&mdash;to kill thought!'</p>

<p>I gave up picking blaeberries this evening to watch her where
she sat under a rock curtained with berry bushes. She sat there
picking the fruit with an air of complete absorption. For every
berry that went into her dish half a dozen found their way to her
mouth. I grew suddenly afraid of losing her, and such an anguish of
terror seized me that my strength went from me and my heart was
turned to ice. I watched her and I could not speak nor move.</p>

<p>She turned her face towards me. Her startled look recalled my
wits and I strove to smile. Her mouth and cheeks were blue with the
blue dust of the blaeberries and when she opened her mouth to laugh
she showed a tongue and teeth all black and red with the dye and
juice of the fruit.</p>

<p>'Why! what is it, Hugh?' she asked, gazing steadily at me.</p>

<p>I smiled as best I could. Then I gave up pretending. I let my
head fall on my hands and surrendered myself up to desolate
thoughts. In an instant she was kneeling beside me.</p>

<p>'Hugh! Hugh!' she cried, 'are you ill?'</p>

<p>'I'm all right,' I articulated, raising my head with an
effort.</p>

<p>'You're as white as a ghost,' she went on. 'What's the matter,
Hugh?'</p>

<p>My tongue was loosened and I babbled like a child, crying,
'Terry, don't leave me, never leave me, Terry.'</p>

<p>'There, there, don't be afraid,' she comforted me. 'I'm here;
Terry's here beside you; what harm can come to us? What nonsense is
this you've got into your poor foolish head? What, is this all
you've gathered? Look what I've got!'</p>

<p>'You haven't such an awful lot,' I muttered.</p>

<p>'I have so, pounds more than you, anyway. Come on, hurry up, and
we'll fill our dishes and go home for supper. You're hungry, I know
what's wrong with you. What'll we have for supper, fried trout or
baked pike? I wish you could see your face, Hugh. Were you eating
berries by the handfuls?'</p>

<p>But when I glimpsed her face while she thought my eyes were
turned the other way I saw there the same appalled look that I knew
my own eyes betrayed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>24 JULY</h2>

<p>WE WALKED WITH Duncan almost as far as the Dalwhinnie road. We
would have gone farther if he let us. He forced us to stop, he
walked from us, and while we watched his retreating figure he did
not halt or even turn his head.</p>

<p>'Good-bye and God keep you,' he said.</p>

<p>'Don't go, Duncan,' Terry implored, 'stay here with us, we've
room and food&mdash;'</p>

<p>He smiled and held out his hand.</p>

<p>'Every one his own way,' he said gently.</p>

<p>'When will we see each other again?' I asked in a strained
voice.</p>

<p>He looked at me fixedly and said, 'Be good to her, Hugh.'</p>

<p>All at once he seized my hand and shook it; he bent down and
kissed Terry's cheek, and said, 'You must not come farther,' and
turned and walked away.</p>

<p>We stood side by side, gazing after him without a word to
say.</p>

<p>'I never saw a man walk so beautifully,' Terry whispered. 'He
knows he'll never come back,' she said, speaking with
difficulty.</p>

<p>He reached the fence and crossed it, his tall figure vanished in
a dip of the road.</p>

<p>'We'll never seen him again!' she cried. 'Oh! oh! why should it
happen! why should it be!' And she fell to crying and sobbing.</p>

<p>I let her alone. I could not sweeten the moment for myself, far
less comfort another. I saw Duncan climb from the dip in the road.
He halted his stride for the first time since he left us. He stood
by the roadside fence and bending over it with both hands on the
top wire he looked across the moor. A hare that he had lifted got
on its hind legs on the top of a hillock to stare at us. We waited
a long time, watching until Duncan returned to his way. He showed
no sign of seeing us. We also went back the way we came.</p>

<p>We have gone over and over every moment of his visit, from the
instant of his arrival out of the morning mist in the gorge beneath
our cave. He came on us by surprise. We had been carrying fir roots
to the cave from the head of Loch Coulter since dawn. We were
resting half-way up the steep ascent from the gully when Duncan
showed himself on the edge of the mist below us. I had as ever my
rifle with me. It was to my shoulder and trained on the approaching
figure before I realized what I was doing. It comes to my shoulder
automatically now when I see a moving creature, but this was the
first time I aimed it with deadly intent at a man.</p>

<p>We have rehearsed every word he spoke, and all we said to him.
We told him what we had done, showing him this clever makeshift,
asking him to admire that other thing. He sat and smiled, and kept
silent; we were afraid to ask outright, to discover what he knew.
When he spoke we listened with bated breath, dreading to discover
what he dreaded to tell, and never told. We listen still, and look
after him, towards the way he has gone. It is not difficult to
remember every word he spoke. When they are told, and told again,
we recall his looks, his eyes, the fashion of his silence.</p>

<p>We tell ourselves, we cry that he was happy, happy with us,
could he not stay! he was happy while the days he stole to give us
ran their course. He sat for hours by the cave door following Terry
with his eyes, smiling when she looked at him, evading our
questions.</p>

<p>But when we tell each other that he was happy here, we think
then that he went away, we could not keep him from going. Should we
stay when he has gone? Oh, my mind is vague and filled with doubts.
I tell Terry that his mind was made up to go and nothing we could
say or do would have weighed with him. In spite of argument we
cannot escape the feeling that there is something we could have
done or left undone to keep him with us, and save our friend. Or
else we should have gone too.</p>

<p>We went back to our cave, alone now, quite alone. The roots I
was carrying up the hill when Duncan arrived were lying on the brae
where I dropped them to snatch my rifle from my shoulder. I began
to gather up the fir. My finger was on the trigger to kill my
friend.</p>

<p>'It was touch and go,' I said to Terry. 'What would have
happened if it was a stranger? My finger was hard on the
trigger.'</p>

<p>'But it wasn't a stranger,' she replied.</p>

<p>'It wasn't a stranger,' I said with a sigh. 'I can't get rid of
the feeling&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What feeling?' she inquired when I paused.</p>

<p>'That I'm a murderer in my heart, that I'm like the thing we ran
from to escape.'</p>

<p>'You'd never have done it,' she said gently. 'You think you
would, when you look back you imagine it was just chance that saved
you. You'd not have done it, Hugh. There's more than chance.'</p>

<p>We came to the cave. We spread out the things Duncan brought for
us on the floor. There were apples and sweets and lettuce from a
deserted garden he passed, flour and sugar, salt and a bottle of
whisky, a rifle with ammunition and a telescope and a knife.</p>

<p>He did not tell us to come home.</p>

<p>'Is it a good rifle?' Terry asked.</p>

<p>'Too good,' I answered. 'His own.'</p>

<p>'He wouldn't have stayed whatever we did,' she cried all of a
sudden, and then she appealed to me with, 'Would he, Hugh?'</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>'Don't you remember this telescope?' I asked. 'He was given
it&mdash;his name's on the case.'</p>

<p>He had given us what he would have given his friends if he was
about to die.</p>

<p>She commenced to gather the gifts and stow them away.</p>

<p>'Give me the glass,' she said. 'It used to hang by his
chair.'</p>

<p>She took the telescope and polished its black worn leather case
with her sleeve and hung it beside the fire.</p>

<p>We felt as if the last links that tied us to our fellows were
being broken as she laid aside each relic of Duncan's visit. We
were outcast indeed.</p>

<p>'You're looking white and tired,' I told her. 'Hadn't you better
rest?'</p>

<p>She moved about the cave, putting out her hands to set things in
their proper places; she moved like an automaton. Her face was
white and tired.</p>

<p>She let her hands fall by her side.</p>

<p>'I can't rest,' she said in a small voice.</p>

<p>'You must rest,' I answered.</p>

<p>'If I bide still my mind torments me,' she cried. 'The only hope
I have of peace is when I work. Oh, Hugh! I can't get Duncan out of
my mind. He'll never come back! He knows he'll never come back,
never no more!'</p>

<p>'A man must go the way set for him,' I muttered.</p>

<p>She looked at me and did not speak.</p>

<p>'Day and night,' she said drearily, 'day and night I think of
him and all folk. Can't you see them, Hugh!' she cried
hysterically, 'with their faces to the sky, waiting&mdash;and
hunger killing them, no strength left to move but falling down,
lying on the ground with their faces to the sky,
waiting&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush, my dear,' I whispered, going near her; 'what use is it to
think like that? It'll send us mad if we let such thoughts prey on
us.'</p>

<p>'Oh, but I think I am going mad, often and often I think the
thoughts of my head will break my reason,' she said with horrid
clarity. Her voice was clear and reasonable but her face was
twisted with pain and her eyes were like those of a hurt brute in a
snare. As I watched her the pupils of her eyes contracted and her
eyes grew hard and shallow with fear.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I implored, 'Terry! for pity's sake&mdash;'</p>

<p>I could scarcely find breath to voice my prayer to her. Fear
choked my breath and laid harsh fingers on my pulse.</p>

<p>'I'd die without you,' I managed to say. I began to laugh, and
turned silent in the middle of my laughter, listening appalled to
the false merriment of my noisy voice. I put my hands on her
cheeks, her cheeks were cold like ice.</p>

<p>'It's you, really you,' I breathed. 'Terry, don't you know me,
this is Hugh! Terry! Terry!'</p>

<p>Her cheeks were cold like ice. She collapsed into my arms. I
took off her clothes and put her to bed. She was asleep before I
covered her with blankets. I sat by the hammock, staring at her,
putting out my hand to touch her. I grew sick as I thought of the
death in life that would be my portion, lacking her. All the air in
the world was too little for the gusty suspiration of my panic
breath. Fear's constricting fingers gripped me in their hold. She
wakened once, roused by my presence beside her; she said in a
gentle voice, 'I was sleeping, Hugh.' She smiled and said, 'Aren't
you coming to bed, Hugh? You look tired.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>16 AUGUST</h2>

<p>WE STAYED AWAKE throughout the day on the Twelfth. Only our
ears' expectancy kept us from falling asleep. It was a warm drowsy
day; the heat of the yellowing sun, the sound of bumble-bees, the
smell of heather in flower, lulled us and drugged our senses half
to sleep save our ears that harkened through the hours for sounds
that did not come.</p>

<p>'The first day of autumn,' Terry breathed, interrupting a long
silence.</p>

<p>'The last day of summer,' I returned.</p>

<p>'Och, no,' she said, 'summer will have plenty of last days yet.
We've had rare luck in the weather, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'We couldn't have managed if the year was wet,' I agreed.</p>

<p>'It's too dry now. The hill's like tinder. A spark would put it
in a blaze. We must be careful with the ashes, Terry. This would be
a hot corner if the rank heather round about caught fire.'</p>

<p>We looked involuntarily to the east where we had seen heavy
smoke rising in the past few days, as if from a forest fire in the
region of Rothiemurchus.</p>

<p>'It couldn't have been woods on fire,' I said, reverting to an
oft-discussed topic. 'Or it would have been burning still.'</p>

<p>'The smoke has vanished,' Terry agreed. 'There might have been
rain there though we had none.'</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>'Not with these blue skies,' I told her. 'If it doesn't rain
soon I needn't bother going out to stalk. Even as it is I can
scarcely come near stags for the noise of the moss crackling under
my feet.'</p>

<p>In the late afternoon Terry voiced our mutual thought.</p>

<p>'I haven't heard a single shot,' she said.</p>

<p>'Not one,' I concurred.</p>

<p>'I've been waiting all day ready to be angry,' she confessed
with a smile.</p>

<p>'Angry?' I asked.</p>

<p>'If I heard shooting, I'd be angry to think men should go out
for sport, at such a time.'</p>

<p>'They went out to kill grouse in the last war,' I informed
her.</p>

<p>'Did they? Hadn't they plenty of killing?'</p>

<p>'I'm not sure but that I'd prefer to hear the guns blattering
to-day,' I went on. 'Things must be bad, Terry. I never heard a
Twelfth like this before. Nor any one else. It'd be better to hear
the guns&mdash;if we knew they were shooting grouse.'</p>

<p>'We know things are bad,' she told me. 'Duncan said&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He didn't say much,' I interrupted.</p>

<p>'Not with his tongue, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'It's a wonder we haven't seen any one,' she continued. 'If the
country is full of deserters and stragglers&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He warned us,' I put in.</p>

<p>'And soldiers rounding them up&mdash;' she added.</p>

<p>I rose to my feet and stretched myself.</p>

<p>'He could have told us much more than he did,' she said. 'He was
saving us, hiding the worst from us&mdash;where are you going,
Hugh?'</p>

<p>'To kill a grouse, Terry,' I answered. 'We've always had a
grouse on the Twelfth.'</p>

<p>She jumped up beside me and caught my arm.</p>

<p>'Don't go, Hugh,' she begged earnestly. 'Please don't go! maybe
it's a bad sign for human folk, this quiet Twelfth, but men's
misfortune has this much good in it, that it makes a truce for the
poor birds of the country. Hugh, there'll be other times when we're
more needing food. We'll let this Twelfth be a holiday from
killing.'</p>

<p>'We used to reckon that we could use the new potatoes from the
field by the Twelfth of August,' I said, sitting down again.</p>

<p>'Don't make my mouth water,' she reproached me. 'I've been
longing for new potatoes&mdash;'</p>

<p>'With milk and fresh butter,' I suggested.</p>

<p>'Why are you tempting me!' she cried.</p>

<p>Next day, in the evening, I took Duncan's rifle and slipped a
handful of cartridges into my pocket.</p>

<p>'Where are you going, Hugh?' Terry demanded. 'Why are you taking
that rifle? Won't it make a loud noise?'</p>

<p>'I'm leaving the .22 with you,' I answered, 'in case a grouse
comes near while I'm away. Don't sit up for me, Terry, it may be
morning before I come back.'</p>

<p>'Can't I come?' she begged. 'I'll not be a nuisance. I won't be
tired or in the way&mdash;listen!'</p>

<p>She tiptoed through a brake of long heather.</p>

<p>'You didn't hear that, did you?' she asked triumphantly. 'The
deer won't take fright from my step, I'll walk so lightly. I'll
tread as soft as a mouse.'</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at her sober face.</p>

<p>'Another time,' I put her off.</p>

<p>'Why not this time?' she demanded. 'I know,' she went on,
'you're not going after a deer at all, Hugh. You're planning
something and you don't want to tell me.'</p>

<p>'What would I be planning?' I cried. 'Now, where's Duncan's
game-bag&mdash;have you a bite of food I can take in my pocket in
case I'm hindered? Are you angry, Terry? Won't you say good
hunting?'</p>

<p>'No,' she answered flatly. 'Take care of yourself and come safe
home,' she whispered a moment afterwards. 'Don't let any harm come
to you. I'll be waiting for you.'</p>

<p>I went down into the gully and spied the country to the south,
making a great show of looking for beasts for Terry's benefit. When
I had assured myself that there were no deer to be seen from where
she stood beside the cave I walked up the defile towards Ardverikie
Forest. As soon as I was out of sight of the cave I slackened my
pace. Darkness was still some hours off, and the evening was too
bright for my project. I settled myself behind a stone and smoked a
precious pipeful of tobacco that I had gleaned from the corners of
my jacket's pockets, and while I waited for night I amused myself
by taking imaginary snapshots at boulders. I had often used
Duncan's rifle in the old days when he took me with him to kill a
hind. It came naturally to my hands now. It was far superior to my
own .303, and I had brought down a beast at three hundred yards
with it, more than once.</p>

<p>At length when it seemed dark enough to proceed I loaded the
rifle carefully, filling the magazine with seven shells and leaving
the breach empty. In this way I could carry it in perfect security
with the safety catch off and yet load and be ready in a twinkling.
I swung from my first course, bending more westernly towards the
shining goal of Loch Laggan.</p>

<p>It was very dark by the time I reached the woods along the River
Pattock and I regretted that I had not taken the risk of going
ahead while daylight lasted. I blundered through the thick scrubby
outskirts of the wood. Tussocks and open drains tripped me up, I
went to the knees in scummy pools. I have never recovered from the
horror of that time when I was nearly drowned in a bog in the Durc,
and I dragged myself trembling from these sloughs as if they
harboured venomous reptiles. Branches struck my face or caught my
clothes as I passed. I fell a hundred times, and the rifle,
swinging over my shoulder, belaboured my head with its butt as I
scrambled to my feet. I could not afford a hand to hold the rifle
since both hands were needed to warn me of obstacles and ward off
the trees I would have run against had I not kept my hands
outstretched before me. I knew that I had a deer fence to cross
before I arrived at the Pattock. I walked with groping hands
outstretched for a good half-mile before I came to the fence, and
when I did reach it I came unawares against it and hurt my arm.</p>

<p>I was exasperated and nervous. When an owl left its perch in the
branches above my head with a soft Whoof of feathers I had the
rifle in my hands and loaded and cocked and pointed forward in one
frenzied movement. I could hear the river brawling ahead of me, my
only guide through the mirk. I headed for the noise, fearing to
miss the shallow upper part of the stream where it could be forded.
I began to fancy that I had kept too low, and that each step
forward was going to precipitate me over the edge of the cliffs
which guard the lower course of the river.</p>

<p>The stream was very small. Its waters felt warm even to my hot
touch. I bathed my wrists and my forehead before I crossed into the
main forest. I found the path leading to Gallovie, between the
river and the fir woods, and followed it as best I could. The
Pattock, ending its broad shallow course, plunged into a chasm; on
my left hand I had the dark windless wood, on my right a sheer
descent from the verge of my path into the river's pools and
cascades. It was pitch dark and very hot. Sweat ran down my face,
blinding me more effectually than the dark night. I began to start
like a nervous animal. I fancied the trees were keeping step with
me, or dangerous creatures hid in the depth of the forest walked
abreast with me. The dark wood repelled me and I found myself
walking on the brink of the cliff. I veered from that danger until
I ran into the trees where the path curved, and I sprang away in
fear.</p>

<p>I had gone about half a mile down the path when a sudden
thrashing noise, accompanied by the sound of harsh choked
breathing, brought me to a fearful standstill. The noise was
directly in my way, I could not go ahead without approaching it. I
forced my limbs to carry me off the path, into the wood. As soon as
I left the path and halted in the shade of the wood, if shadow it
could be called which was but more intensely dark, everything fell
silent again; I could hear the river but no other sound. I brought
the rifle from my shoulder to assure myself with shaking hands that
it was ready. I waited what seemed a great length of time before I
ventured to move, keeping within the wood, off the path. When I had
travelled twenty steps the noise broke out once more with renewed
force; I was near enough to the edge of the wood to see the narrow
strip of sky between the trees on both sides of the river. I saw a
monstrous form uprear itself against the lesser darkness of the
sky; it rose to the height of the trees, a few yards from me, and
fell, and rose again. The choking sound repeated itself more
loudly. I was shaking so that I could scarcely keep my fingers on
the safety catch and the trigger of my rifle. I levelled the rifle
at the patch of blank darkness from which the shape had risen as I
waited. I began to hear a low sobbing noise, like the drawing in of
difficult breath, that the water's voice had drowned until this
moment. I trailed my feet closer to the thing, with infinite
caution, ready to retreat. My eyes caught a glimpse of a tree-top
which seemed to bend and shake, moving alone amongst its motionless
fellows. As I stared at the bending plumes of that tree the Thing
leapt up again, and I saw horns outlined against the vague sky. I
turned back the safety catch of my rifle, and commenced to laugh. I
could hear the hysterical note of my laughter. I scolded myself
aloud saying, 'Shut up! shut up! shut up!' And then, 'Frightened to
death by a stag in a snare!'</p>

<p>I was near enough, now that I knew what I was looking for, to
make out the shape of the stag that hung suspended by its head, or
horns, from a young tree beside the path. I ventured closer.
Immediately the brute began to plunge and rear. Flying hooves
missed my face by an inch. I felt the wind of the fore-feet as they
lashed out; the skin of my neck was prickling and my spine felt
cold. Those sharp hooves would have cut my face to ribbons if I had
been a step nearer. The horrible shuddering of the poor creature's
breath started again.</p>

<p>'The damn fools!' I raged aloud, 'to hang their snare too low
and leave the brute in agony.'</p>

<p>I was so angry that I forgot to be wary. The stag's pain could
scarcely be listened to. I took my handkerchief and bound my
sheath-knife to the muzzle of the rifle like a bayonet. When the
deer ceased to struggle and hung quietly I guessed for its heart
and drove the weapon with all my strength at the vague bulk. I drew
back as fast as I could recover from the thrust. The beast reared
itself for the last time. It was a lucky stroke. The random blade
had pierced a vital place. The sweeping horns loomed over me with
the sky behind them; the deer uttered a sound between groan and
cough. Frothy blood shaken from its nostrils in the final
convulsion fell on my face. The stag fell, dragging the tree-top
into a great bow as the dead weight came on it. When I was sure the
beast was dead I loosened the wire from its neck and cut off its
head and flung it in the river. I gralloched the carcass and rolled
the forequarters after the head and hid the haunches on a bluff
that I could not mistake, to await my return. I was glad to have
venison so easily although the brute's cruel death troubled my
mind. I consoled myself with the thought that I had punished
whoever set the snare. I could fancy the poacher's anger, and I
told myself, 'Serve him right,' yet the stag's breath was still in
my ears. I felt implicated in needless brutality. I went ahead
towards Gallovie more rapidly than I had travelled heretofore.
Anger ousted fear and made my previous caution seem cowardly. As I
walked a new thought struck me. It was very strange that a poacher
should dare to set a trap for deer on this path of all places.
Stalkers used the path daily, fishers and sightseers frequented it.
I recalled the silence of the Twelfth and what Duncan let slip
about famished bands of stragglers roving the country. I thought of
Terry with sudden panic. I began to run as fast as my legs would
carry me, down the path, out of the wood, into the meadows of
Inverpattock. The normal past is still the background to my
thoughts. Perhaps there are no stalkers now, no fishers by the
Pattock, no sightseers save the sightless wide-eyed dead.</p>

<p>The path, leaving the forest, brought me to a cooler lighter
world where my panic abated as quickly as it rose. My own
experience in the plantation beyond the river was enough to teach
me that strangers, inexpert in the country, would never come on our
cave by night. I was ready to reproach myself for a timorous
imaginative fool by the time I came to the foot-bridges that span
the Pattock's divided streams. I sat down on the rail of one bridge
to draw my breath. The country seemed lost in sleep. Every house
was dark. I guessed it was past one in the morning. The blurred
valley sloped upwards into woods, and the woods ended in a
jet-black line against the hills, and the hills climbed against the
sky. I felt a touch of frost in the air. The deep blue of the sky
lightened towards the north, as I had often seen in frosty weather
when the wild fires of frost that burn around the pole irradiate
the Monadhliah scarp, warning us of winter. A sliver of white moon,
hung like a sword in blue air, rested over Gallovie. I went into
the fields to steal the new potatoes I had come for.</p>

<p>I came first on a field of corn. It was trampled down as if by a
herd of cattle. When I kneeled to peer at the ground I could
distinguish the mark of boots, and cattle's hooves, in the soft
earth. I crossed from that field into its neighbour. It was drilled
as if for potatoes or turnips but nothing grew from the drills. I
kneeled once more to assure myself that my eyes were not deceiving
me. The night was too peaceful and normal for such discoveries as
affronted my senses. Half-withered green shaws lay between the
drills, with yellowed turnip tops and potatoes the size of a
marble. I commenced to delve hurriedly in the tattered drills,
groping in the earth with my fingers for potatoes overlooked by
whoever had forestalled me. I found a few potatoes, but when I had
scraped and scratched methodically for half an hour, gleaning no
more than a few pounds of tiny potatoes, I tried a new plan. I
walked up and down the drills in search of crops that had escaped
the harvesters. I found a crop here and there hidden amongst shaws.
At length I had a fair weight in my bag. I left the potato patch to
hunt for turnips. They likewise had been uprooted by hasty inexpert
hands. I gathered a dozen bulbs which had been overlooked. Then I
stuffed the game-bag with green turnip-tops until it would hold no
more and I was ready to go home.</p>

<p>I crossed the bridge. The climbing moon, and my accustomed eyes,
made my path plain, but my eyes kept turning towards Gallovie. I
was devoured with curiosity which would not be gainsaid. I walked a
few steps on my homeward path, and halted.</p>

<p>'It won't be dawn for a good two hours,' I told myself. I hid my
game-bag under the bridge and, rifle in hand, went to spy round
Gallovie. I had no idea what I wanted to find. A fever of curiosity
spurred me.</p>

<p>There is often a wind before dawn after windless nights. Such a
breath began to stir now amongst the trees, and in the
summer-parched grass. I heard it over the woods long before it
reached me. While it was still and calm where I stood I heard the
sighing in the tree-tops which presaged a breeze; a door banged in
the cluster of buildings. I tiptoed up the hill against the cooling
breeze. The door banged again. There was no other sound or sign of
life amongst the houses and farm buildings. I trod so warily that I
could hear the beating of my heart louder by far than my cautious
step. But it was dark underfoot and I trod twice on dead branches
which snapped with a noise like a rifle, or so it seemed to my
ears. I froze at the sound; I dared not turn the safety catch of my
rifle in case it was heard; I kept my thumb on the catch and my
forefinger on the trigger.</p>

<p>I could hear no noise of cattle or horses. If they were not in
the steading they should be in the meadows. I gazed every way and
saw no beast. I heard nothing but the wind and the river and my
tumultuous blood. I reached a fence. Walking alongside it with one
hand on the top wire to guide me, I came to a gateway. An iron gate
was lying flat on the ground, torn from its hinges. I stepped
across it, marking its place lest I required to retreat hastily. I
entered the courtyard. The doors of the steading were open. The
doorways yawned black in the wall. I went cautiously from one door
to another. Some of the doors were gone, others had broken panels
and their locks were torn out. The place had the aspect of
desolation. I was afraid to strike a match or go inside the byres
and stables. It occurred to me again that I had not heard a dog
barking. I ventured as far as the kennels. Their iron doors were
open, their occupants mute, or gone. I crept back until I came to a
cottar house. Its door was shut, but I could see it was not
properly closed. It leaned from inside against its frame, without
hinges or lock. The window-panes were broken in every window, the
garden like our own trampled with many feet; I found potato shaws
scattered on the ground amongst a litter of broken glass and
charred clothes and broken dishes. A fire had been lighted in a
corner of the garden. I found hinges amongst its embers. Bits of
painted wood lay half-burnt around. As I went out of that garden a
breath of abominable air met me, a stench of decaying flesh such as
I had often felt when I passed near the rotting maggot-infested
carcass of a deer on the hill in midsummer. The smell came the more
abominably upon the night's sweet air; I felt my gorge rising, I
ran with my hand to my mouth until I was near the river. A mouthful
of bile spewed itself into my hand against the strength of my
clenched jaws.</p>

<p>The sky was lightening in the east. I hurried to be gone before
day surprised me in strange country. I carried the stag's haunches
out of the wood and as far as I was able to bring them into the
hills. I hid them securely to await my return. The sun came up to
lighten my way home obliterating the fears of night. Terry had a
fire burning.</p>

<p>'I thought you'd never come,' she said. 'What have you in the
bag, Hugh? You didn't get a stag after all. You're all blood! Your
face is all blood! Hugh! where were you?'</p>

<p>I spilled the bag's contents on the floor.</p>

<p>'New potatoes!' she cried, 'and turnips! Oh, Hugh! But where did
you get them? Sit down and I'll take off your boots. They're
soaking&mdash;'</p>

<p>I told her part of the night's affairs while she gave me dry
clothes and set out food for me.</p>

<p>'I can't eat them,' she said, looking at the potatoes with
distaste. 'Think of the risk you ran&mdash;it wasn't worth
it&mdash;if anything happened to you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Risk?' I returned. 'I don't think there was any. I don't think
there's a soul save ourselves left alive in this country.'</p>

<p>I kept some things secret even from her. The smell of death,
rank and hideous, was in my nostrils as I spoke, and ate, and tried
to sleep. I shuddered when I let my thoughts go back and I smelled
again that foul air I breathed. She brought me dry clothes, making
pretence that she believed it was cold which made my blood
congeal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>4 SEPTEMBER</h2>

<p>WE HAVE BEEN very idle these past few days. Our firewood is
home, the cave is snug against winter, there is nothing for us to
do save sleep all night and lie in the sun all day.</p>

<p>Time goes faster here than ever it did while we lived in our
house. We can scarcely believe it is mid-autumn already, though
winter looks down on us each morning from peaks dusted with new
snow. Midday's fervour dissolves the snow, yet the time seems the
more autumnal for the brief fierce heat of the sun.</p>

<p>It is autumn indeed. The bloom of the heather is withered brown.
Cock grouse waken us with their calling from dun hillocks, and I am
sure I heard a stag roar yesterday.</p>

<p>'A fortnight too early,' I told Terry. 'It brings winter on us
with a rush.'</p>

<p>'I didn't hear it,' she answered. 'I've heard that roe-deer
barking, though. We'll be right in the middle of the stags here
when they start roaring in earnest.'</p>

<p>'Oh you'll hear a chorus all right,' I assured her. 'Enough to
frighten you on frosty nights&mdash;'</p>

<p>The light of the sun is no longer rich and mellow as it was a
month ago. The sun shines with a thin white heat. We feel the heat
of noon far more than we did in July, perhaps because the nights
are growing cold. We wakened shivering one night last week. When I
rose to fetch deer-skin rugs I looked out at the door of the cave
to see the night. It was so lovely I began to call Terry, telling
her to hurry as if the silver moon and frost-bespangled earth were
too beautiful to remain. The moon was full in an empty sky. The
world it lightened had no colours save the white light of the moon
and shadows as black as jet. The large moon, lifted in vacancy,
gave me a strange feeling of the round earth itself, sailing in
space upon its voyage, with us its infinitesimal cargo. The world
had valleys as the moon; I saw the valleys of the moon, and under
them our country with its hills.</p>

<p>The leaves of the birch wood are bright yellow. Rowan trees with
scarlet fruit amongst their crimson, brown, and black leaves stand
in the golden setting of the birches. The bent grass of the forest
is tawny yellow.</p>

<p>We have made our cave tight and snug. The floor is covered with
deer-skins. Every chink and cranny in the gable is stopped with
clay. We have a double door of skins and canvas to exclude
storm.</p>

<p>'We've one thing to be thankful for,' I told Terry when the new
snow appeared. 'We are under the snow-line; I've been watching the
clouds on dirty days. We lie just under them. All we get of them is
flying scuds of mist. It'll make a big difference in midwinter. If
we were above the snow-line we'd have rain and sleet and snow
practically without cease.'</p>

<p>'A pretty prospect,' she said laughing. 'Oh, Hugh! I wish you
could see yourself.'</p>

<p>'What's the matter with me?' I demanded.</p>

<p>'You're not brown, you're black,' she cried. 'If ever I saw a
gipsy&mdash;I really must set to and mend your clothes,' she added
more seriously.</p>

<p>'You've a wild look about yourself, Terry. That tangled black
mop of yours&mdash;Do I look a ruffian?' I asked ruefully,
examining my arms and legs. I was wearing shorts and boots without
stockings and the sleeves of my shirt were cut away. My arms and
legs were burnt with the sun. Terry had on her shortest skirt. She
also was without stockings and her blouse lacked sleeves. Her head
was bare. Her hair over her forehead was bleached with the sun.</p>

<p>'I'm going to wear rags while I can,' I continued. 'Pretty soon
we'll have to put on winter clothes again.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she agreed, and sighed. 'I'm loath to think that summer's
nearly spent.'</p>

<p>'Och, winter won't be so deathly bad,' I told her. 'There'll be
fine days. I don't mind a storm really, Terry. It's fun to hear the
wind battering at a door you know it can't break down&mdash;when
you've good food and plenty of firewood.'</p>

<p>'Many a one won't have that,' she said gravely. 'What will
winter bring for the rest of the world?'</p>

<p>'I've stopped grieving myself for others' woe,' I answered
slowly. 'We require all our time to take thought for ourselves,
Terry.'</p>

<p>'You know you don't mean that,' she said. 'The worse our own
lot, the more we think of others.'</p>

<p>'Then let them do as we did,' I cried impatiently, 'let them
fend for themselves. I'm not going to waste the last fine days of
the year pondering about the hypothetical woes of the world.'</p>

<p>'You never told me all that happened on the journey you made to
Gallovie,' she accused.</p>

<p>'What!' I cried, startled; 'yes, I did, Terry, I told you every
single thing.'</p>

<p>Her eyes showed her incredulity but she did not say more.</p>

<p>We spent a good deal of time carrying home fir roots from the
head of Loch Coulter. The waves and floods of many years had
fretted away the moss by the water-side. When the loch subsided in
summer a jumble of roots was laid bare and quickly dried. We often
marvelled at these roots. They grew so thickly that their branches
were interlocked and we had to cut them adrift from each other with
the axe. In the days when the forest grew of which these roots were
a token no one could possibly have traversed this country, for the
trees must have grown so close together that to pass between them
was impossible. But not only were the roots close together and
interwoven, they ranked three layers deep, as if three successive
forests had grown and died in the moss. Yet no modern trees will
thrive in moss, far less flourish and grow to the size that the
roots of those old trees indicated. We found roots, weathered and
broken, but still three or four feet in diameter, and what we found
was not the whole root but only the heart, the resinous pith, of
ancient giants.</p>

<p>The fir was too resinous to be used freely on our fire. We
lighted the fire, when the peat was slow to burn up from its ashes
in the morning, with slivers of fir; once Terry threw on a sizable
piece; it exploded into flame with a yellow blaze that filled the
chimney and ascended clear of the chimney can into the open air, a
beacon that would attract attention from miles away.</p>

<p>It was easy to gather the fir, but fetching it uphill to the
cave proved a slow monotonous labour. We hid our store of kindling
near the cave under slabs of stone.</p>

<p>We had our sticks in safety and our cave prepared for bad
weather by the last week of August. We took energy from the sun,
and after an evening and a morning spent trailing roots uphill we
were still ready to go afield for rowans and cranberries and
averans. We ventured once as far as the Truim to poach salmon in a
pool I knew. I caught a fish with my hands. We crossed the railway.
The rails were red with rust as if they had been long disused.</p>

<p>'They soon grow rusty. A couple of days without traffic will do
it,' I said.</p>

<p>'Surely not in this dry weather,' Terry said.</p>

<p>'There's always dew at night,' I assured her.</p>

<p>We had no doubt in our minds. Catastrophe had arrived on our
country. We did but argue about the things we saw to save ourselves
from relating them together, from thinking of their cause.</p>

<p>We were too greedy to let the salmon lie in cure. But we split
trout and pike open and sprinkled them with salt and laid them out
in the sun; in a few days they were kippered, ready to hang in the
cave beside our fire.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>16 SEPTEMBER</h2>

<p>WE WAKENED EARLY on the morning of the 10th with the feeling
that something uncommon had disturbed us. I opened my eyes to find
Terry sitting bolt upright in the hammock beside me.</p>

<p>'What was that?' she demanded. 'Did you hear anything,
Hugh?'</p>

<p>'I thought I did,' I answered.</p>

<p>I had scarcely spoken when the noise that roused us repeated
itself.</p>

<p>'What noise is that?' Terry whispered.</p>

<p>'Guns,' I said.</p>

<p>'Guns! then they are shooting grouse somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Not with rifles,' I told her grimly.</p>

<p>'I didn't know it was rifles, Hugh,' she said in a constrained
voice and became silent. I began to fling off the bedclothes.</p>

<p>'Where are you going, Hugh?' Terry asked in the same forced
voice.</p>

<p>'To put on my clothes.'</p>

<p>'Hugh&mdash;' She caught my arm and clung to it. She was still
sitting upright. I could sense her rigid expectancy though I could
not see her features in the dim light of the cave.</p>

<p>'I'll cook breakfast,' I told her gently, laying my free hand on
the hand that gripped me to disengage it. Her fingers clutched me,
resisting my efforts to loosen them.</p>

<p>'Let me go, honey,' I said. 'Lie down and wrap yourself in the
blankets. It must be frosty&mdash;there's a keen air&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are there deer-forests over there?' she asked, ignoring my
words. 'Would they be shooting deer? Hugh! speak to me! is it deer
they'd be shooting?'</p>

<p>'Not with volleys,' I said, laying aside pretence.</p>

<p>'Volleys!' Her voice rose and she cried, 'Hugh! Hugh! don't
leave me! stay with me, I'm frightened.'</p>

<p>'There! there!' I said, going back beside her and taking her in
my arms. 'Don't you be frightened, honey, I'm with you, nothing can
hurt you.'</p>

<p>Her rigid form collapsed against me.</p>

<p>'I'm frightened!' she muttered.</p>

<p>'Hush, Terry,' I whispered. 'Lie down and keep yourself warm and
comfortable while I make breakfast.'</p>

<p>'I can't help it!' she exclaimed, shaking herself free of my
hold. 'I know something dreadful's happening&mdash;'</p>

<p>The sound of a ragged volley, amongst the hills to the south,
interrupted her.</p>

<p>'That noise!' she cried, covering her ears with her hands.</p>

<p>'It's a great long way off,' I said.</p>

<p>'It's nearer and nearer every day,' she went on drearily. 'I can
feel it coming nearer. Like an avalanche, slowly, slowly
moving&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But we're safe here, no harm can touch us. Who'd come here?' I
broke in.</p>

<p>'Falling to crush us!' she went on as if I had not spoken. 'Oh
God, my heart!'</p>

<p>'Terry!' I scolded, 'you mustn't take on like this, it's not
right. We should be thankful we are safe.'</p>

<p>'Safe! Sometimes I think we should have stayed. We might have
been able to help&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Lie down and keep yourself warm,' I besought her, 'and that'll
help me. You're chittering with cold. I don't want to have an
invalid on my hands.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I'm cold,' she whispered like a submissive child. 'I'm
terribly cold. Feel my hands, Hugh, they're like ice. You're very
kind to me, Hugh,' she murmured as I tucked her in. 'Very good to
me,' her voice continued faintly. 'I'm sleepy, Hugh.'</p>

<p>We have heard no more firing since then. In the silence of night
before we sleep, and when we start awake through the long dark
hours, our imagination hears the deadly sound, nearer, dangerous,
loud above the rising winds of autumn. There is very little work
for us to do nowadays. We sit, pretending for each other's sake
that we have no deeper thought in our heads than pleasure in the
sun. Our pretence is thin. It hides nothing from ourselves. Once or
twice of late it has failed. Last night we wakened together and I
knew, without requiring to see or hear her, that Terry was not
asleep.</p>

<p>'I can't sleep,' I said.</p>

<p>'I can't sleep, either,' she repeated simply.</p>

<p>'It must have been the cold that wakened us,' I went on. 'Would
you like more clothes on the bed, Terry?'</p>

<p>'How far away was that noise?' she asked, ignoring my
question.</p>

<p>'Beyond Benalder,' I told her.</p>

<p>'Very near,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Far enough to be safe for us,' I returned.</p>

<p>'Safe!' Her voice fell. 'We can't pretend for ever,' she said
wearily. 'It's come to us and we can't escape knowing that it's
come. The trains, our house, Duncan, Gallovie&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We've got to go the way we must,' I whispered. 'There's you and
me still&mdash;'</p>

<p>'All alone now, Hugh. Oh, Hugh, don't ever leave me! It's
nothing to die, if you're with me. It was silly of me to be
frightened&mdash;when I heard&mdash;the guns. I'm not frightened of
anything when you're near me. How warm you are!'</p>

<p>My flesh began to grue and I clenched my teeth to keep them from
chattering. Out of vague and dispersed trifles, out of rumours and
hints and Duncan's scanty words, a close and deadly menace raised
itself, taking shape and form at the sound of Terry's
terror-stricken voice renouncing fear. I put up my hand to the rock
above my head. This rock that pressed down over us, these cliffs
that lowered to close us in, assumed the aspect of a portent, and
danger, implicit in our way of life, caged us in.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>1 OCTOBER</h2>

<p>IN A FEWDAYS after that morning when we were wakened by the
sound of rifle-fire rain came on with boisterous winds. Now in the
general uproar our straining ears could no longer distinguish
separate and ambiguous noises, nor constrain each far-off murmur to
the likeness of guns beyond the hills. Our ears could not forebode
danger while they were deafened with rushing winds and the tumult
of waters; our minds, which had been oppressed with the fear of
danger coming daily nearer, became calm as the weather rose to
wilder storms.</p>

<p>We had been silent in our cave, and preoccupied. The realization
of what we craved yet dreaded to know had thrust itself upon us. We
saw that as our knowledge increased, so did that which we had fled
to avoid come inexorably on, and our calm sunlit haven, untrod and
soundless save for late bees and grouse and the roaring stags,
assumed the appearance of an arena round which the rage of the
world gathered. We were helpless before this thing that stalked
into our knowledge, into our hearing, into our sight. Because our
imagination could create only vague pictures of what was happening
from what we saw and heard, our peril was the vaster. We could
conceive of nothing but general ruin to explain the ruin of our
garden and Gallovie's fate. Duncan's careful warning filled the
land with famished troops of desperate men whose strife and clash
we heard when that dawn brought the sound of guns.</p>

<p>But as the weather changed, so did our spirits. There was
exultation in the wind; rain drove in slanting sheets, the wind
amongst the cliffs over our heads was like the surf of the ocean.
We were warm and dry in our cave. We sat inside the door, watching
the squalls scud down the gully and spread themselves over the
moor, over the valley, until they blotted out Speyside. Loch
Coulter was white with foam. Whirling gouts of spray rose from the
loch, and the wind carried them away, to drench the moor and flood
the Spey and lace the seldom-seen Monadhliahs with silver streams.
Floods that fell from the lip of the precipices around us were
caught by the wind, blown into mist by the wind, flung back on the
hills that gathered them from the clouds.</p>

<p>It grew cold and the land was a vast bog save where the black
streaming cliffs rose to touch the racing sky. Our cave was warm
and dry. Even when the clouds were riven momently from the peaks
and we saw new snow, not the white powdery coat of the year's first
snow, but leaden stuff under the leaden sky, we were not
downcast.</p>

<p>We ate, we slept, we watched the days scud past. We seemed to
lose track of everything. Our larder was almost empty but I shot
grouse from the door of the cave, and we lived on them from day to
day, from hand to mouth. Terry unravelled a pair of my stockings to
reknit them. I busied myself cleaning the rifles. We piled on fire
and prided ourselves on our comfort.</p>

<p>The weather began to clear yesterday. After midday the rain
ended and I called Terry to view a break in the western sky. By
night the sky was empty. The wind blew as strongly as ever though
the sun shone without clouds. Night comes down early now. It hid
the world, save where a snowy peak glimmered. We heard the hoarse
voice of many streams. Lying awake we listened in silence to their
shouting. When we wakened in the morning the wind was down. It was
very cold; the burns though noisy yet were falling and we surveyed
a bare swept country, prepared for winter. The sun commenced to
warm the morning air. The light of morning was very clear; we could
see the most remote distance as if nothing interposed between
ourselves and it save space. The Cairngorms made miniatures of
themselves upon the horizon, against the green-blue sky.</p>

<p>'Autumn's done,' I told Terry.</p>

<p>She looked into the vacant sky. The clouds, the gulls, the
traitorous peewits, all were gone together, swept away by the wind.
The birds that had left us made so great a lack, we felt as if all
the birds of the air had gone. Stags were roaring in the corries;
their throats like the brawling streams did not break the silence
that we listened to, nor convince us that our empty country was
peopled, but rather they made a background for silence.</p>

<p>The day grew warm. We sat outside the cave to enjoy the sun. The
birches were bare, their drab yellow leaves carpeted the ground;
the rowan trees had lost their leaves. But here and there in the
smoky woods we saw a leafless tree hung with scarlet berries,
daring winter. A cloud of small birds swept along the ground beside
us, and into the air like leaves in a whirling wind. They fell, and
rose, all in one flock, and settled for a moment amongst the
birches under our cave, above the loch.</p>

<p>'Autumn's done,' I said again. 'I must get a beast tomorrow.
Pretty soon the stags will be too lean to eat.'</p>

<p>'It's warm still,' Terry said. 'There's heat in the sun. If it
holds like this to-morrow couldn't we do something, Hugh? Couldn't
we have a picnic?'</p>

<p>'The ground's as wet as muck,' I reminded her.</p>

<p>'Och, then we mustn't sit on the ground. It's the last chance of
the year, Hugh. We were always having picnics in the old
days&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I'd like to bathe once more in Loch Coulter, before winter
comes,' I confessed.</p>

<p>'Won't it be dreadfully cold?' she asked, shivering.</p>

<p>'No,' I answered, 'with all the rain there's been the loch will
be as warm as milk. What'll we have to eat, Terry?'</p>

<p>'I hope it's a day like this,' she said; and then, 'When will
the birds come back again, Hugh?'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>2 OCTOBER</h2>

<p>AS WE WENT down and came near Loch Coulter, Terry said, 'When
shall we bathe again, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Mebbe in March,' I told her. 'It can be hot in March.'</p>

<p>'We must begin to think about next year,' she went on
slowly.</p>

<p>'What are we going to think about next year?' I demanded.</p>

<p>'We can't live for ever on our stores, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'Well?' I inquired roughly.</p>

<p>'Don't be angry with me to-day, Hugh,' she pleaded.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I didn't mean to sound angry. Oh, it's
always the same, when we mean to spend one day just being happy
worries come crowding on us&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I didn't mean to worry you, Hugh,' she whispered. 'Och, never
heed next year&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We must heed it,' I said.</p>

<p>'Not to-day,' she replied, 'another day, Hugh, but not
to-day.'</p>

<p>'To-day and every day. There's not a moment of our time will
ever be free again. To-morrow's food, every day's
danger&mdash;where will it end?'</p>

<p>I looked drearily across the blue waters of the loch. I felt her
hand touch mine timidly.</p>

<p>'Don't pay any attention to me,' I bade her.</p>

<p>'I think we'll catch one of the goats that are running wild on
the Farrow,' she said with forced cheerfulness. 'Like Robinson
Crusoe, you know. Can't you make rennet for cheese from the
stomachs of young rabbits, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Yes, or lambs while they're very young, or deer calves, or any
beast while it's being suckled by its mother.'</p>

<p>'There you are!' she continued. 'We'll have milk and cheese and
white, white butter. Then we'll dig a bit of ground and plant
potatoes&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Where is the seed coming from?' I asked ironically.</p>

<p>'Couldn't we get potatoes and lots of things from&mdash;from
round about?'</p>

<p>'Where?' I cried. 'Oh, there's an easier way, the way we'll
go.'</p>

<p>'What way is that, Hugh?' she asked.</p>

<p>'The way of our fathers, raiding and stealing, thieving like our
ancestors.'</p>

<p>'It'd be better for us to die, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'That's easy too.'</p>

<p>'Hugh!' she cried. 'Why are you like this to-day?'</p>

<p>'I don't know, Terry. Oh Christ, I can't see, it's dark and
hopeless every way I turn.'</p>

<p>'We'll go out to the hill for meat to-morrow,' she said simply.
'I think it'll do us good. We've been too idle lately, Hugh. I
often notice,' she went on in earnest tones, 'we get like this,
downcast and hopeless, when we have nothing to occupy us. You are
always happier after a hard day on the hill, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'What's the benefit of feeling better for a few hours when it's
worse afterwards?' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>'That's nonsense, Hugh, and besides, we need meat. What are you
seeing?' she asked sharply.</p>

<p>'Sheep,' I answered. 'We can eat mutton now, Terry, and have
tallow candles to light us, and skins to keep us warm.'</p>

<p>'We're not sheep-stealers yet, Hugh,' she said.</p>

<p>'There's no stealing when there's no owner,' I replied.</p>

<p>'No owner! What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Why are the sheep still here, all scattered everyway, and their
lambs with them that should have been weaned and sold six weeks
ago? Have you seen a shepherd, or heard his dogs? Why is there wool
in tufts on every low branch of this wood? If there were owners
still, would the sheep be out here now, with their lambs, and some
not even clipped?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' she whispered.</p>

<p>'Why should we try to blind ourselves&mdash;the worst we
imagined isn't so bad as the things that have happened there!
there! there!' I spread my arms wildly to the places beyond our
country where men used to live.</p>

<p>She began to take off her clothes and wade into the loch. I
followed her. Winter had couriers in the viewless air. We hurried,
breathless with cold, out of the water to dry ourselves.</p>

<p>'There's frost in that wind,' I told her. As I rubbed myself dry
my skin began to tingle and my flesh to glow. I started to run up
and down the sandy foreshore of the bay where we swam. I pounded
the firm sand with my feet and felt wisps of sand rise between my
toes. Terry stood on the bank laughing at my antics. She shook her
tangled hair over her eyes and began to comb it aside with her
fingers. As I turned from watching her to raise my arms to the pale
sun I caught a glimpse of moving figures in the gorge beneath our
cave.</p>

<p>'Down, Terry! down!' I whispered fiercely, flinging myself flat
on the sand as I spoke.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, Hugh?' she asked in bewilderment, looking
about her without obeying my command.</p>

<p>'For God's sake lie down or you'll destroy us both,' I muttered
furiously. I began to worm my way to the place where she crouched
with her head in the air and a petulant look on her face.</p>

<p>'Keep your damned head down,' I bade her with increasing anger.
I was now beside her. I commenced to gather my clothes in my
arms.</p>

<p>'Get your clothes together,' I whispered. 'For the love of God
do as I bid you, Terry.'</p>

<p>Her cheeks grew white and without another word, without even a
murmur of complaint, she followed me as I crawled uphill to the
shelter of the wood. Sharp stones struck our bare limbs, heather
and branches scratched us, we were wet and filthy and cold with the
muck of bogs we crossed. I could scarcely keep my teeth from
chattering and I heard Terry's breath come and go in painful
sighs.</p>

<p>'Not far now,' I encouraged her hoarsely. She followed me in
dogged silence.</p>

<p>'Put on your stockings and shoes first,' I bade her when we
reached the thicket I had aimed for. 'If we've to run we must be
shod. Put on your clothes as fast as you can&mdash;I'll steal a
look&mdash;'</p>

<p>She sat down obediently on a lichen-covered stone and began to
clothe herself. There were long deep scratches on her legs.</p>

<p>'Here,' I said, giving her my handkerchief, 'put that under your
stocking. It'll keep it from sticking to you if there's blood when
you grow warm again.'</p>

<p>She took the handkerchief without a word. I dragged my clothes
on; they were sopping and made me feel colder than when I was
naked. My left knee was aching with a knock I had taken on a stone.
Terry looked at me with a grey anxious face, I tried to smile.</p>

<p>'I think it's all right now,' I whispered, and left her and
skulked down from tree to tree until I came into a glade that
opened on the gorge. I saw about a dozen men, with four or five
dogs at their heels, advancing in the direction of the loch. I did
not wait to see more. Immediately I perceived the rifles on their
backs, and the crew's wild air, I slipped back to where Terry
cowered. She stood up at my approach, gazing at me with enormous
eyes. Her hands, blue with cold, went to her breast.</p>

<p>'Oh! Oh!' she said, articulating with difficulty. 'I didn't see
you coming! you frightened me!'</p>

<p>'We must get back to the cave,' I whispered, 'there may be other
men&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are there men?' she asked in low tones.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>'If they find the cave we are as good as dead,' I went on. 'What
a fool I was to leave the rifle!'</p>

<p>We climbed up the hill-side as far as the wood gave us shelter.
Then, casting back and fore, we ranged the steep until we found a
ravine gouged out by a winter-flooding burn. Though the course of
the stream was dry there were pools of water in rocky pots in the
gully. We could not avoid them. We trailed ourselves up the gorge,
splattering through the pools, clambering up dry falls of rock and
shale-slides with infinite care lest we dislodged a stone and sent
it tumbling down to warn the men below. Now and then as I crawled I
could see them beneath us if I raised my head so much as an inch.
They seemed very near; I could scarcely believe they had not our
progress in plain view.</p>

<p>At length we lay breathless on the summit almost directly above
our cave. I crept to the edge of the cliff whence I could peer at
the disturbers of our peace. They were making north along the shore
of Loch Coulter. Their dogs stalked at their heels. We waited until
the company of men and dogs vanished over the rim of moor beyond
the loch. No other danger showed itself. We searched the country,
especially the valley to the west from which these men had come. We
saw nothing there to alarm us.</p>

<p>'Are they gone, Hugh?' Terry whispered behind me.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said.</p>

<p>'I'm cold, Hugh,' she went on.</p>

<p>'We'll go down,' I said, rising heavily to my feet. 'Oh, I'm
stiff and sore! Did you hurt yourself, Terry?'</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>When we came to the cave I ran in to snatch up my rifle and load
it.</p>

<p>'I'll never go out without this again,' I said.</p>

<p>'Why are you loading the rifle? Why are you looking like that?'
Terry demanded.</p>

<p>'I'm loading it in case I need it,' I told her grimly. 'What am
I looking like?'</p>

<p>'You can't! You can't!' she cried wildly. 'I won't let you do
it! I'd rather see us both dead, Hugh&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Hush!' I tried to quieten her. 'You're overwrought, Terry. Sit
down, lassie, and I'll see about a meal. Take off these wet
clothes. Let me look at the scratches you got&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know what you're meaning to do!' she went on without heeding
my words. She stared at me for a moment with panic in her eyes.</p>

<p>'You're going to kill! you're going to make murderers of us
both.'</p>

<p>'I'm going to defend myself if I must,' I answered.</p>

<p>'No! No! No! No!' she exclaimed. 'You can't do it! I won't let
you! Give me the rifle!'</p>

<p>She flung herself on me and began to wrest the rifle from
me.</p>

<p>'Let go!' I shouted, 'it's loaded; do you hear, Terry! let it
go, it's loaded!'</p>

<p>I had to use my strength brutally before I could loosen her grip
on the rifle. Suddenly she let the gun go. My hands were round her
wrists and the gun fell clattering to the floor. She began to drag
herself back, struggling in intent silence to be free. I gripped
her wrists with all my force. Then she let herself fall on the
floor beside the rifle, clawing with her fingers towards it. I
dragged her to her feet and held her close to me.</p>

<p>She commenced to tremble and shake and her struggling ended.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I breathed. 'What are you doing, Terry?'</p>

<p>'Let me go,' she said in a hoarse voice. 'Take your hands off
me.'</p>

<p>'Then let the rifle be,' I retorted. All at once she grew limp.
I supported her as best I could with one arm while I let down the
hammock with my free hand. I lifted her into the hammock and
commenced to take off her wet clothes. I left her there while I
blew up the fire. I felt deathly cold; the cave was dank and
shadowy; I was afraid I was going to be sick. The rifle lay
unheeded on the floor until I tripped over it as I went to bring
out the bottle of whisky Duncan gave us. I unloaded the rifle
before I poured out some of the whisky into a cup.</p>

<p>'Drink this,' I bade Terry. 'Draw up the blankets and keep
yourself warm until your clothes dry.'</p>

<p>She took the cup obediently and swallowed the dram at a gulp.
She coughed and tears stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>'It's very strong,' she whispered.</p>

<p>I drank a mouthful of the stuff myself.</p>

<p>'Hugh!' Terry whispered.</p>

<p>'Yes?' I said. 'I'm going to make a meal, Terry. I'm sure you're
famished.'</p>

<p>'Come here a minute, Hugh,' she continued. As I came to the side
of the hammock she reached out her arms gently and touched my
cheeks and my hair with her hands.</p>

<p>'Hugh!' she murmured.</p>

<p>'I'll never forgive myself,' I said.</p>

<p>'I was frightened,' she said. 'There's not much food in the
house,' she went on.</p>

<p>'It'll do one meal, surely,' I said. 'I'll soon get more.'</p>

<p>'You can't! you can't!' she cried, 'it's not safe.'</p>

<p>'As safe as starving to death with hunger, Terry.'</p>

<p>She looked carefully all round the cave as if it was strange to
her eyes. There was fear in her voice when she looked at me again
and asked:</p>

<p>'What men were these, Hugh? Where were they going? What did they
look like? Oh, I'm so frightened, Hugh!' she cried in a shaken
voice before I could answer her questions. Her voice was loud in
the cave.</p>

<p>'But don't be frightened,' I told her. 'What harm can happen to
us here? An army couldn't dislodge us from this place. When I get
food&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You're not going out to-day!' she exclaimed. 'Promise me,
Hugh&mdash;I won't let you go&mdash;don't, don't go!'</p>

<p>'But we need meat,' I reasoned.</p>

<p>'We'll get meat to-morrow,' she said. 'Wait and I'll get up and
show you how much we have, plenty to keep us&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You'll lie still until the cave warms and your clothes dry,' I
answered.</p>

<p>'Then you'll stay at home to-day? Just to-day, promise me,
Hugh.'</p>

<p>'Very well then,' I agreed. 'I can wait until to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Yesterday's to-morrow is now to-day, and I have not yet gone to
the hill for meat. The cave is as dark and cold as any fireless
unillumined hole in the water-dripping rocks could ever be. We have
been sitting all day since morning in the dark recess of our
cavern, not even daring to go out for water, without fire, or
light; the last of our meat is on the table, scraps of grouse and a
few ounces of salt venison.</p>

<p>In the morning early when we wakened I started to tell Terry
about a very strange dream that my waking interrupted. 'It was as
clear as day in my mind when I wakened,' I told her; 'I said to
myself; "I'll remember this to tell Terry,"&mdash;and now, it's all
jumbled up and broken already, and I scarcely remember it at
all.'</p>

<p>'Dreams are often like that,' she said. 'Dreams before waking
are clear in your head until you try to remember them and speak
about them, and then, they're like your face in the water of a
pool, when you go close to look at yourself your breath breaks the
image and the water ruffles, and it's gone. It'll perhaps come back
to you, Hugh, if you don't try to think of it. Oh, how I slept!
Like a stone. I didn't dream&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I wish I could remember!' I interrupted her; 'it'll bother me
all day if I don't recollect what it was about&mdash;I think I
dreamt it was a dipping-day. I heard sheep and dogs. I don't often
hear sounds in a dream&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What put a dipping-day into your head, of all strange things?'
she asked with a smile.</p>

<p>'Mebbe the dogs yesterday,' I replied.</p>

<p>The smile left her face.</p>

<p>'One thing's clear still,' I continued, 'the bleating of sheep.
I can hear it as if it was real&mdash;hark! what was that?'</p>

<p>'The wind,' she said, 'It's gone to the east, surely.'</p>

<p>'It wasn't the wind,' I answered; 'no, it wasn't the noise of
the wind&mdash;oh if that dream would come or go!'</p>

<p>I strained my ears to listen, but the sound that vexed me did
not come again.</p>

<p>'I suppose I'd better get up and light the fire and see about
some venison,' I went on, and sighed. 'Bed's the best place to-day,
Terry! Oh, the east wind! It slackens the marrow of your
bones.'</p>

<p>'I'll get up, it's my morning,' she offered, but at her words I
jumped out of the hammock and hurried to stir up the fire. I had
scarcely bent over the fireplace when the alien noise that
tantalized my ears broke out again.</p>

<p>'Did you hear that?' I asked, straightening myself up and facing
her.</p>

<p>'I thought I heard something,' she admitted. 'What was it, Hugh,
did you hear it&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I heard it,' I answered slowly.</p>

<p>'What was it?'</p>

<p>'Sheep,' I said.</p>

<p>At my words the noise of bleating, borne from the east, swelled
up and sounded in our diligent ears.</p>

<p>'Sheep,' I said again. 'My ears are better sleeping than awake,
Terry.'</p>

<p>I went to the door of the cave to peer out. I heard Terry
scramble from the hammock and in a moment I felt her behind me.</p>

<p>'Keep back,' I warned her.</p>

<p>'Let me see, Hugh,' she said. 'I want to see the sheep.'</p>

<p>I retreated into the cave, taking her with me, and sat down on
the edge of the table.</p>

<p>'What did you see?' she insisted. 'Hugh, you must tell me, you
can't keep me in ignorance&mdash;I'll go myself and look.'</p>

<p>'Stay where you are!' I cried.</p>

<p>'Then tell me. I'm not a fool or a child.'</p>

<p>I took her arm and led her to the door of the cave. We peered
out together, over the gorge, down by the loch, and saw on the
verge of the moor a drab white moving mass. The bleating of many
sheep dinned in our ears.</p>

<p>'No one can see us from there,' Terry whispered.</p>

<p>I shook my head. But venturing to look more incautiously out I
caught sight of men in the gully right beneath us, and I dragged
Terry back into the cave once more.</p>

<p>'There are men beneath us, not a couple of hundred yards away,'
I whispered.</p>

<p>I took the rifle for which we had struggled and filled the
magazine examining each shell as I handled it. She stood by without
attempting to hinder me.</p>

<p>'What sort of men?' she breathed.</p>

<p>'I'm going to see,' I answered. 'Stay here and don't move. Reach
me over that telescope&mdash;have you a dry rag?'</p>

<p>I opened the glass and wiped the lenses.</p>

<p>'Don't! don't go out!' Terry implored. 'If they're so
near&mdash;they'll see you.'</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>'They'll never catch sight of me,' I assured her. 'I must see,
we must know, we can't stay closed up here like blind moles
starting at every sound in ignorance.'</p>

<p>I heard her whisper 'Oh, be careful, Hugh!' as I got down on the
floor to crawl from the cave. First behind boulders, then with a
heathery ridge to screen me, I squirmed and crept until I reached a
coign of vantage from which I could see all ways without being
seen. When I looked at the men in the gorge I saw them through a
narrow slit between two stones, and their gaze, even if it directed
itself straight at the place where I lay, could not possibly
distinguish me between the contiguous rocks that made a loophole
for my rifle and my eyes. The bulging cliff hid me from above, and
the east was empty until the sheep, still far away, warned me of
danger; so from the east I could not be seen unless I let an enemy
come close; I gripped the rifle when that thought struck me; we
dared not let men discover our place. But the east was vacant
except for the distant sheep, and I turned to look straight down at
the men in the ravine. I laid the telescope open beside me. I could
distinguish the strangers only too plainly without its aid. There
were two of them and they advanced until they were a short distance
west of the cave, and there they halted. One of them began to sweep
the country with binoculars. In spite of the security of my
hiding-place I huddled down when he turned his attention to the
hill-side where I crouched, and the cliff above me. A hundred
things that might betray us presented themselves to my mind. I saw
our manifold traces everywhere about us; it seemed impossible that
he could avoid seeing what was so patent to my own imagination.
With the open sky over me and the rock looming above I felt as if I
was lying in plain view. I could not forbear casting my eyes to the
east whence the noise of bleating sheep came with increased
force.</p>

<p>That fit of panic ceased. I gathered courage to look forth again
at the intruders. The fellow with the binoculars had apparently
satisfied himself, for he now sat on a boulder with his back to me
watching his companion hunt around for dead heather and bits of
stick carried by the autumn gales from our birch wood. My heart
came into my mouth when I saw this fellow fling down a handful of
sticks beside the boulder on which his comrade sat and point to the
cluster of trees west of our cave. If he went there for wood we
were lost. Our peat-stack, our paths, must betray us. But the man
on the boulder commenced to speak vehemently. I could hear the
angry tones of his voice, he was so loud and near, though I failed
to distinguish his words. He gesticulated with his arms, pointing
in all directions, but chiefly to the north-east; the noise of
sheep swelled into a great lamentation. Eventually he jumped
hastily to his feet and ran to the side of the burn in the gorge
where he pointed at the ground and kicked something embedded in the
moss. The other fellow bent submissively to wrench a fir root from
the boggy ground. I was glad we had gone farther for our roots.
They lit a fire and he with the binoculars returned to his seat on
the stone.</p>

<p>They had a tattered and desperate air that daunted me. The one
who seemed to be leader, and sat like a graven statue on the
boulder, staring across the gorge and down the lochside to the
moor, had a rifle slung over his shoulder; his binoculars-case was
slung round his neck and dangled on his chest where it came easily
to his hand. He was wearing a khaki jacket and grey trousers. I
strained my eyes searching for the gleam of brass buttons on his
jacket. I could not distinguish whether there were none, or if they
had been blackened, but that single detail did more to impress me
and fill me with forebodings than all the other signs of hazard
that the men's manner and clothes betrayed.</p>

<p>The companion of this armed man, more ragged and fierce in
appearance than his leader, seemed far less dangerous. He was a
large slouching creature, black-bearded and red-faced. His cap was
drawn down over one eye, his jacket, too large even for his frame,
was turned up at the wrists and I could see the lining above his
hands. He had a furtive gait. He was for ever turning his large
head over his shoulder and as he fed the fire he started every few
moments to snatch up his rifle from where it lay on the ground,
like one in constant fear.</p>

<p>When the fire was burning well he produced a bundle wrapped in a
red cloth, a handkerchief perhaps, from his pocket. He unfolded the
bundle and when he had made a sharp point on a birch branch he
speared the contents of his bundle on this stake and held whatever
he was cooking in the flame of the fire. Very soon the savour of
burning meat came to my nostrils and in a little while they were
eating ravenously. My own hunger rose as I watched them and smelled
their food. I could hear Terry whispering:</p>

<p>'Hugh! Hugh!'</p>

<p>I retreated to the cave. We stayed the worst pangs of our hunger
with scraps of grouse while I told her what I saw.</p>

<p>'We must get food or starve,' I said.</p>

<p>'Can't we light a fire?' she asked. She was shuddering with
cold.</p>

<p>'You should go to bed and keep yourself warm there,' I advised
her.</p>

<p>'I can't go to bed,' she broke out. 'Oh! I wish I could get
warm!'</p>

<p>While the two men were eating the noise of sheep continued
without seeming to come any nearer. I looked through the glass from
the mouth of our cave. I could see the sheep plainly at the far end
of Loch Coulter; they were huddled in a mass while dogs, whose
yelping we heard occasionally, ran in circles round the flock. I
saw a group of men seated to the left of the sheep, and I fancied I
saw a thin spire of smoke rising from amongst them. One man stood
alone by himself, away from his companions to the right of the
sheep, outlined on a hillock as if he were standing sentinel
there.</p>

<p>'Can you see anything?' Terry whispered. 'Give me the
glass.'</p>

<p>I gave her the glass without a word. She stared through it for a
long time.</p>

<p>'What does it mean?' she asked at length. 'What men are
these?'</p>

<p>'It means we might have been less scrupulous about taking a
sheep,' I answered. 'It means mischief.'</p>

<p>Half an hour later the crowd of men began to rise from sitting
amongst the heather; they dispersed: some went behind the sheep,
others came in front, the flock moved slowly west. I ventured to
look down into the gully. The two men there had risen. They were
standing together and he with the binoculars gazed backwards at the
sheep. He spoke to his companion who scattered the fire and stamped
its embers into the ground. Then they walked up the valley and
shortly disappeared.</p>

<p>The sheep approached. Their bleating resounded amongst the
cliffs. With yelping dogs hurrying them, and half a dozen armed
desperadoes leading them and following them, they passed beneath
us, following these two, their apparent vanguard, into the west.
The cave was bitterly cold. We were famished with hunger and racked
with fears. We could scarcely restrain ourselves from lighting a
fire until the sheep were out of sight. Then I took the
water-pail.</p>

<p>'Risk or not, we can't let ourselves perish of hunger and cold,'
I declared. 'Light the fire, Terry. They're gone, all out of
sight.'</p>

<p>I had barely left the cave when I was inside again shouting,
'Put out that fire, put it out!'</p>

<p>We dragged the flaming sticks upon the floor and beat them
out.</p>

<p>Terry was white and shaking. When the fire was extinguished I
began to tremble myself.</p>

<p>'There's a rearguard too,' I said hoarsely.</p>

<p>'Did they&mdash;did they see you?' she asked.</p>

<p>'I don't know&mdash;they were almost on me&mdash;one on each
side of the valley&mdash;walking along the hill-sides&mdash;'</p>

<p>I sat in the mouth of the cave with my rifle across my knee. A
long time passed before I ventured to look out. Night was drawing
near, dull, cold, and ominous. I could see no signs of men. We
lighted our fire and Terry used some of our dear stores making a
meal. I grudged each mouthful that I ate, yet my ravening hunger
mocked my scruples and my fears for the future. We were wrapt in
misery like a cloak, hungry and cold and weak with spent fears.
There may be a pike on my set-line. I shall go down when night
comes, dark, safe, dear night.</p>

<p>'I must get meat to-morrow, come what will,' I said.</p>

<p>'We must have meat soon,' Terry agreed. And then, spreading out
her hands to the fire she laughed, and said, 'Oh, fire, I love
you.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>5 OCTOBER</h2>

<p>I HAVE BEEN listening to the quiet all day. Everything is as it
was before these men appeared, the country empty, winter on the
hills and autumn ageing in the valleys. Terry is here, here beside
me where I can touch her and, turning to look at her, smile when
she smiles. We have lighted our fire and laid on peats. The cave is
warm. The rabbit I killed this morning beside Loch Coulter makes a
fine smell as it braises in a pot.</p>

<p>This is our country. I feel, not as if strangers had intruded on
our peace, but as if we had erred into another dangerous land, and
now we have come home. Yesterday is a tale of a thousand years ago.
For all my looking back, and recalling, it will not be brought
near, but like a scene viewed through the wrong end of a telescope,
its events are distant and impersonal, clear and crowded and far
away. I cannot see myself in them as this thing myself that sits
listening to the sounds of our frosty autumn day. I see pigmy
figures toiling over hills, running, falling, one dying; they are
not human; not I but a marionette effigy of myself am amongst them.
I begin to speak about that man, and as I speak I try to feel
horror. I should feel horror, and I feel none.</p>

<p>Terry says, 'It was you or him, your life or his.'</p>

<p>Truly, I feel no horror. When I have twinges in my wounded side
I do not recollect immediately how I was hurt, or when. I shall go
up to-night and hide him in a sepulchre of stones from the eagle
and the hoodie and the scavenging hinds.</p>

<p>I can feel Terry's eyes on me. I think she believes I am
horror-struck and hiding it from her. If I tell her that my mind is
free she thinks I am saying it to convince and comfort her.</p>

<p>It is bitter to feel her pitiful eyes on me and to watch the
distress she tries in vain to hide, knowing as I do that I do not
require pity, and that she is unhappy because she imagines I am in
despair. How can I despair, or simulate that hideous horror that I
ought to feel, I a murderer, and at peace? I long to persuade her
that I am not hiding my horror from her.</p>

<p>We are seldom of separate minds. We think alike, we think
together. Now we are divided and I lack companionship. Maybe she
feels I ought to speak to her, sharing my woe. How can I speak
things I do not feel, or unburden my mind of a trouble that does
not beset me? Perhaps she like myself is miserable because we are
divided. If I could say the things she imagines I long to
say&mdash;I try saying them to myself. They sound false and forced
to my own ear. It's beyond me to ape horror and anguish of mind. I
feel nothing but my tired limbs and the stabbing of my wounded
side, and this quiet rediscovered country where we live.</p>

<p>And if by speaking I could persuade her that I feel no
blood-guiltiness, how would she regard me then? I recall the day
when she caught the rifle and tried to take it from me. If I said
that the picture of that man falling was before my mind's eye like
the fall of a tree, as casual, as unconcerned with mortality, with
what grievous eyes would she see me? I dare not, I dare not speak.
I'm not a monster, surely, callous to human death; to kill a man
and feel no anguish&mdash;I have felt worse pangs when a stag died
in a froth of its own blood than I feel now. His blood's on my
sleeve, with my own.</p>

<p>Or is this my present state of mind nothing but a hiatus between
deed and thought. If I could speak to her, and hear her speak
again, I'd know. She waits for my words, I am silent, night is
approaching when I must take stones and hide the dead body of the
man I killed. I see him fall, before my eyes, like a tree falling,
slowly at first, then in sudden collapse. His outstretched arm
flings the rifle away; the fingers of his outstretched arm extend
themselves; to close and grasp the moss where he falls. I never
knew dead men's eyes stared like his; it was foolish of me to
imagine that dead men's eyes closed when death struck them blind;
death has fingers for the heart alone; how many stags I've seen
with glazing eyes, and tapped their eyeballs with the blade of a
knife, before I bled them. I should have known. I'll close his
eyes, when I hap him in stones to keep him from the hoodie and the
eagle. Upon the flat hill-top, under the sky, with my fingers on
the eyelids of the man I killed, I'll surely know then what I
am.</p>

<p>Then I can speak, and Terry will answer me. I pray for horror to
compass me. Come, night, dark minister of time.</p>

<p>It is only two days since I waited at the door of the cave and
the sheep and men went past. When all had gone and were lost in the
west I spied every corner of the country, sweeping it yard by yard
with the telescope. Night came soon. We slept ill; the rifle lay
beside me all night. In the morning I took it in my hands.</p>

<p>'I'm going for a beast, sheep or deer or goat, I care not
which,' I told Terry.</p>

<p>'Is it safe?' she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>'Safe?' I laughed. 'Fully as safe as dying of hunger here, like
rats in a trap, Terry.'</p>

<p>'Let me tidy up the cave first,' she said. 'Then it'll be ready
for us when we come back.'</p>

<p>'But you're not coming,' I told her.</p>

<p>She nodded her head vehemently.</p>

<p>'Terry,' I went on, 'you must attend to me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And let you go out of my sight, maybe never to come again!' She
cried frantically. 'I know there's danger, Hugh. I can see it in
your eyes, your face. I feel it in my heart. Look at me! look at me
and say there's no danger&mdash;you can't hide it! I'm going with
you! Oh, Hugh, if anything happened to you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What could happen?' I interrupted. 'Listen to me, Terry, you
must be reasonable. We need food, we've got to get it, whatever
comes. One can stalk a stag more easily than two. If there's
danger, two people on the hill make the risk double what it is for
one. One can watch better than two, one can escape faster than two,
one can hide more securely than two&mdash;'</p>

<p>She was silent for a space, staring at me.</p>

<p>'Show me how to work the rifle,' she said at last in a low
voice. 'Is Duncan's rifle loaded? Leave it with me.'</p>

<p>She put her arms round my neck and kissed me.</p>

<p>'You had better go quickly,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'll be home soon. Stay inside the cave and don't wander from
it, whatever happens,' I said.</p>

<p>'Come quickly, come home quickly, Hugh,' she bade me. 'I'll be
waiting for you. I'll watch for you with Duncan's glass.'</p>

<p>I took my own .303, and a score of bullets. Then I spied for
deer from beside the cave and found a herd about two miles away on
the hill across the gorge. I showed them to Terry.</p>

<p>'Good luck,' she said.</p>

<p>The wind was right and if only I could cross the valley without
being seen the rest of the stalk was child's play. I needed to do
no more than slant up the hill towards a ridge west of the herd.
The wind remained easternly. It had brought many beasts to this
corner of the hills. I saw half a dozen herds scattered here and
there, but those I saw first were nearest and most convenient.</p>

<p>The beasts of this herd were restless and I saw them raise their
heads from eating to gaze downhill; I attributed their restlessness
to the season of the year and the disturbance of the previous day.
I crept and slid down the hill with my eyes on my quarry, ready to
freeze at the first sign of their perceiving me. The morning sun,
weak though it was, shone in their eyes and kept me hid. I reached
the bottom of the slough without attracting their attention. I
glanced upwards at the cave. I could not see Terry though I knew
she had her eyes on me, and when I realized how easy it was for a
man to lie in hiding, watching me, himself unseen, I spied the
country once more. Then I thought that no stranger would come into
this place expecting to find people in it. Only the wildest chance
could show me to an intruder before I saw him. At that the tussocks
and black patches of bog which had seemed so like men reassumed
their old innocent character. All was quiet. The deer in front of
me were eating. Occasionally a stag roared. We could not kill many
more stags, except young beasts, for their roaring was that of
beasts nearly spent. I crept under the brow of the hill and
commenced to go up in a long circuit towards the ridge I had chosen
for a lair when I came near enough to shoot. I climbed slowly,
conserving my energy. I was not tired but empty. I could not think
of food without repugnance. Nevertheless I was weak from lack of
food. When I tried to hurry I grew dizzy. It cost me an hour to
reach the level of the deer, a distance I had often covered in
twenty minutes. I sheltered behind a rock to make certain that my
rifle was loaded, and that its barrel had not become choked with
moss and peat-dust while I was crawling.</p>

<p>I stood up cautiously to look round the edge of the rock at the
herd. All at once I heard a noise behind me. I was shaking like a
leaf with the excitement which always seizes me when I am hunting
and come near beasts without yet reaching a place from which to
shoot. But as I swung round to meet the noise I ceased to tremble;
my nerves were strung like a taut bow; my right hand turned the
safety catch and the rifle came to my side at the ready; its muzzle
swung until it pointed directly at a man less than a hundred yards
away. We stared at each other for what seemed an eternal space. I
was conscious of nothing in the world but this man, facing me, with
his rifle, like my own, pointed at me, and my breathful lungs. I
saw him with more clarity than anything else has ever shown. I saw
his white face and his tattered clothes and the bandolier slung
across his chest. I saw his bare head and the wind blowing its
unkempt black hair. The rifle swung up to his shoulder and its
sound crashed out in my face. I felt something tug at my side;
blinding rage swept over me. I flung myself on my face in the lee
of the rock and as I reached the ground I fired. He was drawing
back the bolt of his rifle to reload when I fired. How could I
miss? he was foursquare before me, a broader target than any stag
or hind. I had reloaded and my rifle was trained on his chest
before he moved again. I waited for him to send the bolt home. I
would not fire till he was ready. His right hand went to his
throat, his left arm, gripping the rifle by the stock, extended
slowly. His head fell back and his mouth opened. As his left arm
stretched out to its full length the rifle flung from his grasp; he
took a short step forward and stumbled, the fingers of his left
hand spread out like a fan; he began to fall, slowly; and then he
pitched on his face. The smell of cordite was in my nostrils; I was
half drunk with the noise of my rifle and the smell of powder;
fierce exultation filled me. I heard the clip of deer's hooves over
stones; my breath went out with a gusty sound. I thought, it
happened in the time of drawing a breath. I got up and leaned
against the rock. I was shaking now; my limbs felt cold. There was
a burning in my lungs and a nausea in my stomach as if I had run up
a steep brae until breath and strength failed. I took my telescope
from its case to train it on my enemy. He lay as he fell. I walked
towards him, stumbling as I went. My nerveless fingers would
scarcely hold the rifle.</p>

<p>I stood over him, staring down at his broad back. His face had
fallen into a mossy pool, the fingers of his left hand clutched the
moss and short-cropped grass; he had a heavy gold ring on the
forefinger of his left hand. It shone amongst the yellowing grass.
Blood stained the hand at his throat and darkened his jacket
sleeve. I heard a shout far away beneath me, and looking in the
direction of the noise I saw several tiny figures climbing up the
hill towards me. A bullet splattered on a stone and screamed over
my head. The shrill whine of the ricochet was still in my ears when
the voice of a rifle followed its messenger. I ran to snatch the
dead man's rifle from where it lay. I aimed it downhill and emptied
its magazine at my pursuers as fast as I could work the bolt. I
laughed to see them halt and scatter, and take refuge behind
stones. A fusillade of slots answered me without giving me any
feeling of danger. I trailed the body of my enemy over on his back
and tore the bandolier from his chest. His cheeks were wet and
dirty with the water of the pool, his eyes outstared the sky. I
could not make myself lay fingers on his eyelids to close his eyes.
He had a satchel by his side. I flung it and the bandolier of
cartridges across my own shoulder. I took the bolt from his rifle
and dropped it into a marshy hag where it would sink, never to be
found, and flung his rifle into another pool. It was a .303, like
my own. My hands were imbrued with blood.</p>

<p>Bullets screamed overhead. I cast a final glance at my pursuers
from the lee of a boulder. They had given up shouting to conserve
their breath for the ascent. I had no fear of them. I knew the
country too well to be overtaken or driven into a corner. I had
only a vague plan in my head, to lead them on until it was dark, to
draw them far away from this part of the country and then, eluding
them, to return.</p>

<p>My fingers, groping in the dead man's satchel, brought forth a
thick bannock of oatcake and a lump of cheese. I commenced to trot
in a southernly direction, intending to follow the south shoulder
of Meall na Ceardaich until it rose again to Cam na Ceardaich. If I
had not lost my pursuers by then, I could double across the Farrow
and lead them through the wilderness of the Durc until nightfall. I
ate from the satchel as I went. But I had not gone a mile when I
felt unaccountably weak; my breath laboured; I put my left hand on
my hip to steady my breathing. My fingers felt sticky. When I
brought them before my eyes they were red with blood. I stood like
a fool, gazing at my hand. Panic took hold of me. I cast around for
a boulder behind which I could hide and defend myself to the last.
In a moment I recovered myself by force of will from that mood of
despair. I thought of Terry waiting for my return. I unfastened my
jacket and pulled up my shirt until I saw my side. It was dark with
half-dried blood and a narrow red line of new blood marked where
the bullet struck me. I put my fingers in the wound. It was long
but not deep, a raking slash in the flesh. When I had soaked my
handkerchief in a little burn I washed the wound roughly and made a
pad with the handkerchief to lay along my side. I pressed my cap
over the pad, under my shirt, and brought my belt up and drew it as
tight round the wound as I could bear. The belt was broad enough to
keep the bandage in place if it did not slip. I dragged my trousers
in until the top button-hole of the spare reached the first braces
'button. I was not wearing braces. I could run now. I glanced over
my shoulder. Six men, spread out in a semicircle, were behind me,
less than a mile away. I knew that they were winded after their
climb. I believed I could escape. I made more easternly, in the
direction of Loch Ericht where there were woods to hide me if I
reached them. As I fled I spoke to myself, urging myself on,
advising myself of the way, and the obstacles in front of me. I
heard myself crying,' Don't be afraid, Terry.' And then I said,
'Hugh! Hugh! hurry! you must take them away from the cave, you must
lead them away from the cave.' It made a refrain to my running. I
did not feel pain or fear or weakness while that aim was in my
mind. An occasional shot warned me that I had not shaken off
pursuit. At such times my thoughts took a start. I knew I was not
fit to race up steep ground. I knew I dared not let myself be
herded into a narrow valley where my foes, speeding downhill, would
come near enough to pick me off as I laboured up the other side. I
swung to the left, following the ridges of Cam na Ceardaich without
ever glancing behind. Suddenly a loud 'Halloo!' almost beneath me
brought me to a standstill. I caught sight of a man in the valley
of the Sluie burn. The fleetest of my pursuers, on the right wing
of their chase, had outdistanced me. If his plan was to cut me off
from Loch Ericht's refuge-woods and force me into haggy flats where
I would find no shelter, it seemed to have succeeded. I was tempted
to lie down and wait until I was overtaken. I could defend myself
even against half a dozen men. Rage began to swell in me against
the men who chased me like a beast before them. Yet I remembered
Terry once more. As I looked down at the swift fellow who had
outrun me hope revived. He was pelting down the valley at top speed
as if he imagined I was right before him. I could neither see nor
hear anything of his companions. It seemed to me that he had
outdistanced them and broken their cordon by his haste. It was my
only chance. I was standing on the lip of a little corrie which
fell to the Sluie. Once I reached that burn there was nothing but
level moor between me and Loch Ericht. I bolted into the shallow
shelter of the corrie. Half a mile down it began to grow narrow;
the stream which drained it had gouged out a ravine. I was barely
into the bed of the stream when shouts broke forth above me on the
hill-top. I crouched as low as I could while a figure on the
skyline shouted as if to the man below and waved his arm eastward.
Immediately he vanished I toiled down the gorge. Sometimes I
slipped and fell feet foremost over slippery rocks; I plunged down
gravel slides which fell with me, filling my boots with sand and
stones. A rock struck my side and I lay gasping with agony. Warm
blood trickled down my side. Still I kept on. In a short time my
enemies must find that I was not before them. They had followed me
too far to let me hope that they would abandon the chase because I
had given them the slip. The ravine spread into a dell. I scampered
across it to reach the Sluie and climb the opposite bank. Startled
cries told me that I was seen. I fled without attempting to hide,
towards Loch Ericht. I was barely a quarter of a mile in front of
my foremost pursuers when I crossed the deer-fence into the wood. I
took my rifle in my hand as I clambered over the fence. I steadied
myself to aim at the leading man. I may have hit him. He flung
himself down with a savage cry, and I, with a yell of exultation
and mockery more savage than his, burst into the wood whose
thickets no enemy would dare to thread for fear of ambush.</p>

<p>Climbing steadily upwards on a long slant which would bring me
into the cavernous rocks of the Farrow, I harkened for the noise of
pursuit. No sound followed me. I was safe at last. Yet now that I
had reached my goal I was afraid. The wood was filled with lurking
dangers, each tree made a convenient ambuscade. I dared not halt to
attend to my wound but pressed on as if the route was yelling at my
heels. I was running like a fool by the time I came to the head of
the wood.</p>

<p>I crept into a rocky cavern from whose shelter I could survey
the land. It was deserted and so quiet I could scarcely believe
that those wild voices which followed me had ever existence outside
a dream. It was bitterly cold. When I had eaten some more oatcakes
and made a pad for my wound with my shirt I lay down on the earth
to wait for night. Cold and pain and hunger come at length to be
their own anodyne. I thought drowsily of our cave, warmly lit, of
Terry waiting until I came.</p>

<p>At night's approach I left my hiding-hole. I was dead-tired and
every limb ached so that it was torture to move and drag my leaden
feet over the Farrow, through fresh snow. I made a circuit by the
Durc and the head of the Sluie burn in case my enemies were still
loitering by the lower course of the stream. Night had fallen
before I neared the cave. My tiredness left me as I came to our
gorge. I ran up the steep slope saying, 'Terry! Terry!' Terry!'
over and over again under my breath, not loud, for fear I warned a
lurking foe and startled her. I felt for the entrance to the cave
with my hand. I rested a moment, leaning against the rock, while I
drew a great breath of gladness to be home. I whispered, 'Terry!
Terry! are you there? It's Hugh!'</p>

<p>No answer came. I noticed how dark and still the cave was. I
thought, 'She's gone to bed. She's sleeping.' I was angry because
she had fallen asleep, forgetting me. I said, 'I wouldn't have
fallen asleep waiting for you, Terry.' I cried, 'Terry! are you
sleeping?' No voice replied. I groped my way into the cave until I
reached the hammock. It was slung close to the wall. I cried,
'Terry!' and then in a louder voice I shouted her name, bidding her
speak to me. My loud breath beat on the walls of rock whose echoing
voice flung back her name and the night resounded with a mockery of
my fear. I stumbled to the fireplace to plunge my hand in the ashes
of the fire. I waited for the exquisite pain of burning to abate my
dread. The ashes were cold.</p>

<p>I could not think clearly. My head reeled and if I had not
clutched the mantelshelf I would have fallen. I shivered like a man
in a fever and when I tried to speak, to cry, to shout her name
that the whole world must hear and echo my calling voice, I had no
voice; my mouth opened and closed, making no sound, only my breath
broke and sighed in my throat and my heart, as loud in my ears as
thunder, seemed to grow and swell in my bosom. I drove myself
outside. When I shouted, the hills bandied her name. Poised on the
brink of despair I listened with bated breath for her replying
voice. I began to speak aloud to her, scolding her, petting her,
begging her to come home. Now I fell into a rage against the men
who followed me. I rushed back to the cave for the rifle and
brandished it, cursing them, threatening them, until dread mastered
me once more. Then I cried, 'Terry! Terry! come home.'</p>

<p>Through all the moments of that time something in my head, cold
and malignant and as serene as the dead, heard my foolish voice's
babbling as if it was a child's wailing, and knew that this my
noise was but the momentary extravagance of fear. And as it knew,
so I was aware with part of my mind that when I gave up shouting
for Terry who would not come, never come home, this frozen rage
would rule me, this icy death in life be my portion. I clung to my
fear, lest it leave me to despair. I shouted when I knew calling
was vain. But still I shouted to keep myself from despair.</p>

<p>The night was still, no voice answering broke its quiet. My
heart was dead in me. I went listlessly into the cave for firewood.
I began to make a bonfire at the mouth of the cave. I became
engrossed in what I was doing, still evading thought. The wood
blazed up into a beacon that miles around must see. I piled on more
fuel. I exulted to think my enemies would see the blaze. When they
came to me, I would be prepared to meet them. I laid the rifle I
carried beside the fire while I went into the cave, now brightly
illumined, to bring out the other guns. I found only the .22.
Duncan's rifle had disappeared. I searched frantically for it,
flinging the bedclothes on the floor, tearing things from their
place, to discover it. I could not come on it. As I searched I
fancied I heard the sound of a voice above the din of the fire. I
rushed outside to listen. I retreated away from the fire, into the
darkness, out of range of its sound, to attend for that voice. I
heard it a second time, like my own name feebly called. With a glad
heart I answered, 'Terry!' I plunged down the hill to find her. I
was not tired any more. I took her in my arms and carried her up
the slope. The fire made so loud a wind of flame that I scarcely
heard my own voice murmuring, 'Terry, Terry, Terry.'</p>

<p>She lay with closed eyes in my arms. Her wan pinched face was
streaked with the dirt of bogs, her clothes were sopping wet. I
felt no weariness nor pain in my limbs. I could have waited for
ever by the fire, gazing at her face, with my arms supporting her.
She opened her eyes to look up at me. I took her wet clothes from
her and rubbed her chilled limbs with my hands, chafing them until
they were warm as mine.</p>

<p>'You were away a long, long time,' she whispered once. She was
asleep in my arms before ever I got her into the hammock. Once or
twice in the night she wakened with a cry of fear and clung to me
more tightly. I did not dare move or rise to put out the fire for
fear of waking her. I could not sleep, I was too glad to sleep.</p>

<p>I killed a rabbit early this morning. We have a day's food at
least, and a day's respite before I need go out to kill a stag for
meat.</p>

<p>'We've only each other,' Terry said when she wakened. 'If
anything happens, I hope it'll be soon, and both of us
together.'</p>

<p>'Nothing's going to happen,' I tried to assure her.
'Nothing.'</p>

<p>Nothing. Nothing came to him and he's nothing, the man I killed.
I washed his blood from my hands, his blood and my own. Blood will
have blood they say.</p>

<p>She dressed my side. The bullet carried some cloth into the
wound. I think it is clean now. I've been watching a hoodie on the
other hill, near where he lies. Maybe I'm too late to close his
eyes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>9 OCTOBER</h2>

<p>I THINK WE were never so happy as now. We have made up our minds
and chosen a course; we have escaped from doubt. The fears that
afflicted us since we came to this place are gone from mind like
the cold and hunger and fatigue of the past few days. We are not
anxious or afraid any more. We have found surer peace in the time
of the racked world's anguish than ever pleased us while the earth
was quiet.</p>

<p>I can scarcely take my eyes from Terry as she bends over the
poor dying creature in our hammock. She has been standing there,
still as a statue, for a long time. Her face is radiant, her eyes
shine. Happiness burns in me as I watch her. Often I rise from
where I sit writing to go beside her. He is almost gone, the gaunt
lines of his famished cheeks are growing smoother. His vast eyes
stay on Terry's face. They are free from terror at last. When I
look at him, and see his thin hands lying on the bedclothes, I turn
my back in momentary shame that ever I feared this frail thing
whose passing breath, no louder than a sigh, marks an end to our
life here. Shame does not endure; we have helped him, and
ourselves, and the days of our fear are spent.</p>

<p>Though the cave is warm and bright I can think of leaving its
comfort without a pang. It served its purpose, it sheltered us and
brought us to know ourselves and chose the only way of peace. When
I remember the months that we have spent here I do not grudge their
alarms and dangers, but rather I am grateful for that harsh
instruction because it taught us wisdom and gave us happiness
beyond fear and thought of our own safety.</p>

<p>I gaze at Terry's pitiful face. If I had not her, what a poor
tormented thing I'd be, like the forlorn man who dies in our bed. I
have no courage, save with her, no wisdom that is not hers, no
hope, no life except in her. Oh, Terry! Terry! I'd live a million
years and suffer all that time can inflict to reach a moment such
as this.</p>

<p>The shortening day is done. When he's past the reach of hunger
we'll go carrying what we can, to meet our fellows. To suffer is
happiness, if we go rightly.</p>

<p>The past had no shape or form until now. But like slaves who
toil without aim or end in view, we were rapt in trivial moments. I
review the completed past; it glows in my memory. The jewelled
summer shows itself again; I remember how we bathed and played at
gathering berries in the bright hot weeks when every creature was
young. Summer's a lovely dream; hardships and fret remove
themselves from knowledge. I'll sleep to-night and forget summer.
When I waken, it'll be there, and Terry dancing by the loch.</p>

<p>Though we depart, leaving our cave to the fox or the wild cat or
the cleanly badger, this place, this land, is ours, and we, tied to
it as the wild creatures are, cannot escape from it by going. But
we belong to it, we have given ourselves up to it; no other abode
can ever break this strange allegiance. We make ourselves its
servants by going. The fire blazes finely, we've no need to spare
our sticks or hide our presence. The hill-world that encloses our
hearts was good to us. We owe a duty to that which gave us fire and
food and brings forth creatures like ourselves, human folk to
help.</p>

<p>We have escaped from fear, from anger too, and grief, and
horror. Nothing is left but pity. The man who lies dying in our bed
makes a symbol of humanity for us. How can we fear or hate broken
men like him, whose works, that grieved us when we saw our garden
wasted, are done in anguish and despair. Dangerous like trapped
beasts, destroying because they fear destruction, hunting fugitives
to death because death halloos at their own heels, murdering and
stealing in dread of murder at men's hands or from the ravening
rage of hunger, they are not things to fear and hate, but men to
pity.</p>

<p>The past resolves itself out of broken events into a pattern.
All the stages of our progress to this moment lose their separate
selves in it; they take meaning and relevance from it, assuming the
aspect of necessity. Necessity does not admit grief to rule. What
we suffered seems now an apprenticeship merely. I remember our
wasted garden, without grief, and the days of our flight, without
dismay. I do not hate the men who hunted me nor suffer horror when
I recall the man I killed. He came to the place of his death where
I killed him, I but the instrument of that power which carries men
out of fear and rage to pity.</p>

<p>I piled a cairn of stones over him. I said as I heaped stone on
stone, I'll see this cairn every day on the ridge of the hill.
Nevertheless I went on raising a memorial to affront my eyes. I
could not leave him with a shallow covering of earth and flat
stones, so open to the sky. The crows had picked his eyes from
their sockets. With his eyes gone he did not seem like a man. I
never wondered what man he was, what brought him here. I piled a
great cairn over him. I delved my arms into the bog where I sunk
his rifle to lay it beside him. As I worked I twisted my side and
the wound opened again.</p>

<p>I killed a roe-buck on the morning of the 6th. We were lucky to
get it. I could not have gone far for meat. We were faint with
hunger. I had lost a great deal of blood and the pain of the wound
sapped my strength. I spied the roe drinking by Loch Coulter and
brought him down with the .22. Terry fried his liver straightaway.
Our force renewed as we ate though we had to compel ourselves to
eat.</p>

<p>'It was a lucky chance, getting him,' Terry said, and then, 'He
won't last us very long, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'No,' I agreed. 'We must get a stag as soon as possible, and lay
up a store of meat.'</p>

<p>Her eyes kept their distraught look. I found her gazing at me as
if she doubted my presence. I avoided speaking about the past
days.</p>

<p>'Is it&mdash;is it safe to go out?' she asked.</p>

<p>I could not tell the lie I wished to tell with her eyes
beseeching me. I shook my head.</p>

<p>'Nothing's safe any more,' I said wearily.</p>

<p>'Whatever will happen to us!' she burst out. 'What can we
do?'</p>

<p>What could I say that would quieten her fear? I started to skin
the roe.</p>

<p>'We'll rest to-morrow,' I declared. 'I'm not fit to go out
yet&mdash;this filthy wound aches&mdash;'</p>

<p>We were like people in a stupor, sleeping, waking to eat,
crouching over the fire. The days were growing colder. We could not
get warm. Drizzling rain fell, sleet on the tops. In the evening of
the 7th I fetched down the rifles. I had even omitted to clean
them.</p>

<p>'We'll try for a stag to-morrow,' I said. 'We've had a lesson
not to let ourselves run short of food&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Dear lesson!' she interrupted bitterly. 'I'm going with you,
Hugh.'</p>

<p>I did not argue with her. I could not bear to think of losing
her again. Next day, before it was fully light, we carried our
store of ammunition and the most precious of our belongings from
the cave to hide them in a deep cleft in the rock. We covered them
with stones. That was the morning of the 8th of October.
Yesterday.</p>

<p>'No one will find them there,' I told Terry.</p>

<p>'Will any one find the cave? Is that what you mean?' she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>'There's a chance of that,' I returned. 'No more
chances&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Would you like me to stay&mdash;in the cave&mdash;guarding it?'
she whispered.</p>

<p>'No,' I said.</p>

<p>We went out, she carrying Duncan's rifle and I the .303, in the
direction of Meall nan Eacan. We killed a stag before midday. We
had a piece of boiled venison with us and we sat down on a ridge
overlooking the gorge of our cave to eat it. The damp gusty day
showed signs of blowing clear. We sheltered behind a stone with our
stag beside us. When we had eaten I commenced to cut up the stag.
Its head was off when Terry cried:</p>

<p>'Hugh! listen!'</p>

<p>I started up to hear the unmistakable clamour of rifles echoing
amongst the rocks above Loch Coulter. I took the telescope. Before
it was focused the noise came again, louder and nearer. I caught
sight of dark figures running along the shore of the loch.</p>

<p>'Do you see anything?' Terry demanded. 'What do you see?'</p>

<p>I pushed the glass back into its case.</p>

<p>'See!' I said, pointing out the hurrying specks.</p>

<p>'Men running! Hugh&mdash;we can't stay here! they'll be on
us!'</p>

<p>'Where'll we go that's safer than the place where we are?' I
asked. 'Home to our cave, Terry?'</p>

<p>'We can't stay here,' she went on wildly.</p>

<p>'As well here as anywhere,' I returned. 'How do we know what's
happening behind us, by the Sluie, or on the Farrow?'</p>

<p>While we spoke the figures sped on until they were inside the
ravine of our cave. Bursts of rifle-fire accompanied them. Soon we
could distinguish a dozen men in a scattered company retreating up
the gorge while behind them a larger band followed as if in
pursuit. I felt my heart begin to race; my hands were shaking with
excitement.</p>

<p>'They're fighting!' Terry said in a low voice.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I agreed; 'they're fighting.'</p>

<p>The pursued began to spread out up both sides of the gully. We
saw them ensconce themselves behind stones, and their rifles, which
they had not paused to use until now, answered the rifles of their
pursuers.</p>

<p>'Oh, it's horrible! horrible! men killing each other like
beasts!' Terry whispered, covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>The pursuers halted before the fire of their opponents. One
fell, another stumbled like a man struck. They began to run
aimlessly, half-retreating. But a voice rang out calling single
words of command. In a moment the imminent rout was stayed, and the
large company extended itself to face the entrenched enemy, but in
a wider arc; the wings raced up the hill-sides.</p>

<p>'They're outflanking them!' I cried when I saw two men of the
pursuing troop work their way from stone to stone farther and
farther up each side of the ravine without seeming to attract the
attention of the fugitives.</p>

<p>'They could get them now!' I cried, wild with excitement, as the
wings exposed themselves on a bare burnt patch. 'Oh, the fools!
fools! One man on each hill-top will pick them off like sheep!'</p>

<p>I swung round to find Terry regarding me strangely.</p>

<p>'I can't bear to see the weaker side destroy itself,' I
muttered.</p>

<p>'They're lost,' she said suddenly. 'They're lost.'</p>

<p>The wings of the large band opened a careful fire at the men
beneath them. Two fellows rose convulsively from behind their
boulders to fall in a heap.</p>

<p>'It's more than I can endure!' Terry cried. 'Can't we
go&mdash;out of sight&mdash;of this horror!'</p>

<p>'We daren't move,' I returned in a low voice. 'If we lie quiet
they'll pass us by&mdash;it's our only chance of escape&mdash;'</p>

<p>Meanwhile two men who lay side by side in the centre of the
pursuit were dragging themselves forward, and as they advanced they
carried with them something whose nature I could not distinguish. I
began to take the glass from its case to discover what it was they
brought so carefully and with such deadly slow intent. They halted
and seemed to work busily upon this thing. Then one of them raised
his head and the stuttering of a Lewis gun broke out, muted and
softened by distance but terrifying still. I slipped the glass into
its case again; I had no need to spy now that the noise told me
what I had seen them carry. In the uproar of the Lewis gun the
crackle of the rifles was drowned, and the interval between each
burst seemed a dead silence. Its gunners had found a comfortable
stance; they lay steady, sweeping their enemies' line. I could
trace the course of their fire by the flashes that streamed from
the gun-muzzle, now to one hill-slope, now to the other. The
defenders broke in panic. They ran for their lives, flinging their
rifles away, forgetting everything but fear of the machine-gun.</p>

<p>One of the men with the Lewis gun now sprang to his feet. His
clear voice called his band to pursue, his arms waved them on. His
companion, still lying prone, loosed his weapon on the fugitives.
It coughed and barked and thunderous echoes rolled from hill to
hill.</p>

<p>I spared a glance for the broken mob of fugitives who raced
westwards; they surely did not know the country. Ardverikie fence
had to be crossed, and if their foes let them pass that obstacle
they came into boggy country where they could be cut down at
leisure. I caught sight of a lagging figure in this band who did
not fly in blind panic like his fellows; he glanced backwards, he
kept his rifle. When the leader of the other company leapt on a
stone to urge his followers forward this man dropped behind a
hillock. He crept back to meet his foes until he could just see
them over the ridge of his hillock. His rifle went forward,
steadied, aimed. The leader on the stone was falling before I heard
the shot. The marksman stood up to wave his rifle defiantly at the
enemy. The attackers wavered, with their eyes on their leader's
stricken body. If the other side had turned now they might have
saved the day. But they were in headlong flight and the remaining
Lewis gunner had time to take his friend's place. He shouted a
hoarse command; hoarser cries answered him. The victorious company
raced after their foes. Now and then a rifle cracked. The fugitives
floundered; they saw the fence too late and attempted to swerve up
the hill; they were killed before they ascended a couple of hundred
yards. I saw one man stumble and fall. Two of his hunters were on
him like hounds. A rifle swung up, its butt fell with a noise like
an axe. The thing on the ground squirmed convulsively. His
assailants flung themselves on him as if they must finish their
work before his life was fully sped. In a moment they rose, one
brandishing two rifles, the other casting what appeared to be a
haversack over his shoulder; they glared around them for another
victim.</p>

<p>Suddenly remembering Terry, I looked fixedly away from the scene
of that man's death for a moment or two so that if she followed my
gaze she might escape seeing what I had seen. I was wise too late,
but when I turned my head, praying that she had not seen, her eyes
were tightly closed. She sat with a face like death, frozen in
horror. Her hands clutched the heather by her side.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I whispered.</p>

<p>'Is it all over?' she asked in a low voice, without opening her
eyes.</p>

<p>'Terry&mdash;' I said again. My tongue clave to my mouth. I
could not speak except to say 'Terry!' a third time in a rough
voice I did not recognize for my own. The smell of cordite drifted
up round us. She opened her eyes.</p>

<p>'I think&mdash;I think we're safe here,' I muttered. All at once
a tumult of shouting and rifle-fire broke out directly beneath us.
Venturing to look downhill I saw that two of the fugitives, sole
survivors of their band so far as I could distinguish in my hasty
scanning of the battlefield, had chosen to climb the shoulder of
Meall nan Eacan rather than accompany their friends into the trap
of the gully. They were able to cover a certain distance without
being seen; I knew the burn they followed; I knew the place where
the gorge cut by this burn grew shallow as it crossed the shoulder
of the hill. Immediately they reached the shoulder the fugitives
were observed. But they had gained a fair start. If they reached
the peak of Meall nan Eacan they could keep their enemies at bay
indefinitely. Defiles in the precipitous rocks that went up like a
giant stairway to the peak made fortresses which two men could
defend against a hundred.</p>

<p>As I reasoned thus I recalled our own situation. It seemed
desperate at first. We were directly in the fugitives' line of
flight. Both hunters and hunted would undoubtedly take us for an
enemy; we had to defend ourselves from both sides. It was easy
enough for us to ascend to the peak of the hill in safety; but when
we came there, what was there before us? My mind pictured the slow
descent of the ridge that went down to the bogs round Loch an Doire
Uaine. We could, it was true, plunge directly from our height to
the valley of the Sluie. That was a trap to be avoided at all
costs. Our only hope of safety depended on our keeping to high
ground. Once in a valley with the Farrow's steep looming over us we
would be cornered at our enemies' leisure.</p>

<p>'They're coming this way,' I told Terry in a thick voice. I
peered downhill for the last time to make sure that my reasoning
had not led me into needless panic. It was true, I thought, that
the obvious course for these two men to follow was straight in our
direction. They had surmounted the steepest grade of the hill and
they could afford to face a further climb while their antagonists
laboured behind them. If these two kept to the ridge on which they
had arrived they had a fortress ready made before them. Yet, elated
by their success, they might not choose to climb farther, but
veering east across the rolling moor, try to escape by speed of
foot. I hoped in vain. When I looked back the leading fugitive had
gained forty or fifty yards on his companion. He sat down coolly
behind a stone to aim deliberately at the rabble below. His rifle
spoke once, twice. At the second shot a yelling ruffian flung up
his arms; his voice died in the middle of a shout; he tumbled
backwards and rolled like a log down the steep. The marksman began
to climb again. I led Terry out of our hiding.</p>

<p>We might escape without being seen if the fugitives turned at
bay on the crown of the hill. But if they got far in advance of
pursuit they might not halt there; instead, chasing in our tracks,
they would lead danger after us wherever we went, and if they were
swift there was a possibility of their seeing us and overtaking us.
I could not hope for much mercy in that event. To men in their
plight all other men were dangerous, to be killed before they kill.
We were both weak and slow; my side kept dragging; our hunger had
weakened us more than we imagined until we came to run. We kept the
steadiest pace we could up the shoulder of the hill, down the other
ridge towards Loch an Doire Uaine.</p>

<p>Safety awaited us if we got so far as the loch without being
seen. From the loch we could slip back into the Little Durc amongst
whose caverns there were many dens of refuge that no enemy would
dare to assault. If we succeeded in our plan, it would only be by
seconds. A dangerous peat-hag divided us from Loch an Doire
Uaine.</p>

<p>My thoughts raced ahead of me as we ran. I had never lost my
dread of bogs since that time I escaped from the hole in the Durc.
I dreaded the traverse of this moss in front of us. Pathless, full
of peaty canyons dug by winter floods, it made a labyrinth that I
had never attempted to thread in haste until now. I caught Terry's
hand to help her along. She clung to me as we scurried
downhill.</p>

<p>The noise of firing checked our speed. We ran softly to listen.
We heard ragged volleys and amongst them the sound of one rifle at
regular spaced intervals.</p>

<p>'They've turned at bay!' I cried joyfully. 'We'll manage
now&mdash;'</p>

<p>I spoke too soon. Just as we reached the outskirts of the moss a
shout from the east, borne loud on the wind, made us pause, and
turn. We saw a couple of figures outlined on the ridge of Meall nan
Eacan. At first, prompted by hope, I thought it was the fugitives.
A burst of rifle-fire beyond the hill-top told me that I hoped in
vain. These men we saw on the skyline, who now disappeared as they
flung themselves down the steep, belonged to the pursuit. No doubt
they were unaware of our existence, no doubt their aim was to
circumvent the fugitives and take them from the rear. Nevertheless
they had seen us and we were cut off from the Durc, for their
viewpoint commanded our entire route. If we dared to enter the
Little Durc now we could be trapped like rats. One man posted on
each summit that towered over the gorge of the Durc would guard its
entire length, its exit and its entrance. Our fastest most happily
guided pace across the bog must be slower than the speed with which
they came downhill to outflank us.</p>

<p>Our last chance of safety depended wholly on my knowledge of the
lie of the ground, of which our enemies were surely ignorant. I
knew that if we allowed ourselves to be driven away from the stable
footing of the Farrow we had only one retreat, into the wild moss
which stretches deep between Loch Pattock and Strathmashie. On
another day than this we would no doubt have used that dangerous
road and saved ourselves by lightness of foot like moss-troopers.
Our feet were leaden, we were nearing the end of our strength.
Unless we found secure footing soon we must turn at bay like our
fellow-fugitives.</p>

<p>I swung to the right, leaving Loch an Doire Uaine to the east.
The woods by Loch Ericht, which saved me once before, must be our
goal.</p>

<p>We floundered into hags which grew more broken and treacherous
as we advanced. My help was more hindrance than aid to Terry. There
was so much jumping and turning to be done that while I kept hold
of her hand I did but trail her into bogs which were best gone
round. She clung to me and I dared not try to free myself in case
she gave up heart altogether. Her face was grey, mire covered her
from head to foot, she fell over tussocks and stumbled into slimy
pits. I was in as bad a case. My side was bleeding and my legs
trembled under me when they took my weight after I jumped. I grew
dizzy with staring at the ground before my feet. When one treads a
maze the mind grows dull, bemused by concentration; to go round an
obstacle requires more strength of will than the weary mind can
resolve; taking each step in dread, we went straight forward over
the mire, descending into peaty canyons to climb their far banks on
our hands and knees, dragging our feet through sloughs we should
have avoided, travelling ever more slowly to the remote shore.</p>

<p>It was like a nightmare that repeats itself. Even when we
arrived on firm ground we acted as if we were still floundering in
the moss. But in a few yards we reached a stream and flung
ourselves down to drink. The place where we lay was firm; I have
never felt greater comfort than I had in that instant when I found
the stones and turf of the burn's side under me.</p>

<p>I searched the darkening hills for our enemies, but saw nothing
to make us start and run. The wind was shrill. We heard it sounding
in the Durc like waves on a shore.</p>

<p>'We should have been there,' I said.</p>

<p>'Where are we going, Hugh?' Terry breathed. 'It's getting
dark.'</p>

<p>'A little farther,' I answered. 'Give me your hand, we'll be
safe and warm soon.'</p>

<p>'It's cold,' she said. Her teeth chattered violently.</p>

<p>'It's blowing up for snow,' I said. 'Come, Terry, we must reach
Loch Ericht before night&mdash;just a little longer, honey, and
we'll have fire, and food, and shelter.'</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>10 OCTOBER</h2>

<p>THE SNOW IS melting fast; there's still heat in the sun. But
it's not a proper thaw. The air is cold behind the sun, and icicles
grow in the shadow.</p>

<p>We've felt all the seasons while we lived here. Spring when we
came, summer to make us glad, painted autumn&mdash;today is winter,
time to go before our road is closed. When I shut my eyes I can see
winter filling our gorge with drifted snow, the world all blurred
with drift.</p>

<p>I forced Terry to leave the cave for a while and breathe fresh
air and see the glittering hills; morning painted their snowy
summits. Stags were roaring close at hand.</p>

<p>'Did we ever really climb these?' she breathed in awestruck
tones, pointing to mountains whose sides, snow-covered almost to
their base, seemed to rise sheer from their dark valleys in steeps
that only birds could dare.</p>

<p>'Climb them!' I cried, and laughed. 'Yes, indeed, we ran up and
down them like wild goats.'</p>

<p>'They're very steep, aren't they?' she said.</p>

<p>'They seem steeper than they are,' I answered.</p>

<p>I said to myself, 'We did climb them.' Not their apparent
steepness made me doubt, but my own faint recollection. The dismal
time past was sped. I gazed at the country we traversed a couple of
days ago. One of the eagles from the Durc soared into view,
climbing in a slow magnificent spiral until it wheeled out of
sight, too high over its kingdom for our poor eyes to follow. I
thought of its terrible vision of the world, its eyes that saw a
realm of hills and a mouse stirring in the grass from that
invisible throne in air where now it hid. I thought, where my
imagination and my memory faltered, it saw. Our footsteps in the
snow amongst the hills were plain to its gaze. Then suddenly I
remembered and saw as if with the eagle's sight. I saw the battle
in the valley; I perceived our way of retreat to Loch Ericht, and
our fire blazing in a cloud of snowflakes, and our return to the
top of the Farrow whence we saw other ominous fires gleaming
encamped below our cave. Our wanderings were like a map spread
out.</p>

<p>'Don't go in,' I begged Terry when she turned to leave me.</p>

<p>'I must,' she said.</p>

<p>'You can't do any good,' I went on. 'You're tiring yourself to
death&mdash;you haven't rested for more than five minutes
together&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Soon I can rest,' she said gently. 'It's not his good but my
own&mdash;making it easier for him has changed me&mdash;it won't be
long now.'</p>

<p>'Is he weak?' I asked.</p>

<p>'As water. Are you staying here?'</p>

<p>'I'll go in,' I said.</p>

<p>We bent over him. He was nearly done, his breath as feeble as a
child's, scarce fretting the silence of the cave. He began to smile
and whisper and open his eyes wide. He tried to sit up. Terry put
her arm under his shoulders. It was ended before we knew it began;
his dead weight lay on her arms. She let him back gently; she
stooped to touch his forehead with her lips.</p>

<p>And it's so easy then to die, to die and lose the sun, to open
one's eyes and sleep.</p>

<p>'He died quiet,' she whispered. 'He didn't die like a beast,
alone.'</p>

<p>No, nor at the crooking of my finger. Christ, how near it was.
As I look back the days of our flight assume a dreadful air.
Fearful and violent, they belong to destruction. With death eager
in our hands we fled from death.</p>

<p>'Terry&mdash;' I began hoarsely. She paused from binding his
face with a handkerchief and closing his eyes. She laid her hand
softly on mine.</p>

<p>'Hugh,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I broke out, striving in vain to speak, but the best I
could say was, 'If I hadn't you&mdash;if I hadn't you&mdash;'</p>

<p>'But you have me and I'm with you,' she murmured. I sank my head
on her hands, on the bed where he lay.</p>

<p>'Hush, hush, my child,' she said. 'We've left the past behind
us&mdash;see! I can smile, look at my face, I've no fear.'</p>

<p>Her face was radiant. I could not escape so soon from thinking
of the past. I knew that nothing could ever destroy my knowledge
that I alone would never have escaped from the rage of the past.
Not like this our sole guest, not gentle and broken like him, but
as a wolf, I'd have killed, and died. How can she help me to escape
knowing that when every word she speaks convinces me more surely of
what I'd be, if she were not with me?</p>

<p>I'll bury him in the valley. His eyes are closed. She smoothed
his brow and cheeks. Why do we whisper in our cave? He can't hear
and death doesn't listen. Death makes his face noble.</p>

<p>I said, 'I thought you were going to die of cold and tiredness.
I was mad with fear, Terry.'</p>

<p>'I thought that fire would never burn up,' she confessed. 'We
must get ready soon, Hugh. What can we take with us? We can't carry
all I'd like to bring.'</p>

<p>She is busy while I write, recalling yesterday, when we came
home, and the day before yesterday, when we fled. We came to the
wood by Loch Ericht. I had scarcely energy to gather sticks or
strength to break them. The branches of the wood were sodden with
rain. We made a fire at last. Terry crouched over it, shivering and
trembling like one ague-struck. We could not eat for cold. Night
encompassed us with dangerous shadow. We jumped when a bird cried
or the waves of the loch made a sudden plash.</p>

<p>Our fire smouldered as if never to take, but at length a
resinous branch kindled and a blaze flared up. It revealed large
flakes of snow drifting slowly on the wind.</p>

<p>'Snow!' Terry cried aghast.</p>

<p>'Snow!' I echoed. 'It might have come more timely, with all the
other days of the year to chose from. What new misfortune must we
suffer?' I asked bitterly.</p>

<p>'It might have come more untimely, Hugh,' she answered, 'and
showed our footsteps.'</p>

<p>'Or turned these men back out of the hills,' I argued.</p>

<p>'Will it do that?' she asked eagerly. 'And we can go home
soon?'</p>

<p>I stared gloomily at the fire. I was without hope. She swayed
with weariness as she stooped over the fire.</p>

<p>'Take off your clothes, one thing at a time,' I bade her. 'We
can't lie down to sleep in sodden rags.'</p>

<p>I set a long branch across two stones near the fire to make a
rack for our garments. We dried them one by one and put them on as
they dried. The heat of the fire drove us back into an angle
between two rocks where we were sheltered from the rising storm. I
hurried out to gather brackens for our couch before the snow hid
them and wetted them. The snow came down in huge deliberate flakes.
The noise of the wind in the trees grew deeper and we heard the
loch beating on its shore, far under us in the thick darkness. When
I returned with my arms full of brackens to the light of the fire I
was white with snow.</p>

<p>'Is it going to be a bad storm?' Terry inquired anxiously as I
shook the flakes from my head and shoulders.</p>

<p>'It's early yet&mdash;' I answered dubiously; 'but in this
country you never know. We're more than two thousand feet above
sea-level here, Terry, anything can happen. It's a wild night.
Throw on these roots, lassie, heap up the fire to last until
morning. We don't want to waken and find ourselves frozen stiff.' I
made an effort to laugh.</p>

<p>'Them all?' she asked. 'Won't the fire be too big&mdash;and show
us&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Anyone abroad to-night will have more thought of shelter than
chasing us,' I assured her. 'If we lie here, in the shadow, we
can't be seen, however big the blaze. But you couldn't see a town
burning through the blanket of this night.'</p>

<p>Our hearts revived with the warmth of the fire. We ate
sparingly; we crept into our pile of bracken and slept soon. The
cold wakened me; I slipped out of our bed to put fuel on the fire.
It had sunk to a heap of grey ashes, but when I gathered in the
butts of sticks which had dropped away from the centre of the fire
they commenced to smoke and glow in a very short time. I could not
tell how much of the night was past. The world was bright for the
snow had ceased falling and a large moon, nearly full, illumined
the country out of a cold clear sky. I heard Terry stirring
uneasily. She peered from amongst the brackens. Her face was
flushed and confused with sleep.</p>

<p>'Hugh!' she whispered, 'where are you, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Here,' I replied.</p>

<p>'I slept,' she said.</p>

<p>'Lie still and sleep more,' I bade her.</p>

<p>'I can't sleep more,' she answered. She rose slowly, stretching
her arms. 'Oh, I'm stiff and sore!' she complained. All at once her
voice became anxious and afraid. 'Why are you awake?' she demanded
breathlessly. 'What made you waken, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'The cold, Terry,' I said. 'Nothing more.'</p>

<p>'Nothing more? I thought&mdash;' She paused as if revolving what
she thought. 'What are we going to do now?' she went on. 'Can we go
home?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' I began.</p>

<p>'Oh, I'm tired,' she said, and shivered.</p>

<p>'Sleep a while longer,' I said.</p>

<p>'And what are you going to do?' she demanded.</p>

<p>'Oh, I might climb to the top of the Farrow to spy. It's as
bright as day in the open.'</p>

<p>'I'm going with you,' she said.</p>

<p>'But you're tired out!' I expostulated. 'The snow will be deep
in drifts up there&mdash;'</p>

<p>She would not be dissuaded. We scattered our fire before we set
out to reach a viewpoint that would command our cave, its gorge,
and the intervening waste. We trudged mechanically up the hill.
Fatigue like poison in our veins dulled our senses. We were over
the round summit of the Farrow before we halted and saw the cliffs
behind our cave black against the snow in the distance.</p>

<p>'It's a long way off,' Terry whispered.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I agreed, 'and bad going. Can you face it, Terry?'</p>

<p>'What light is that?' she cried. 'See, Hugh! there below the
rocks, near Loch Coulter!'</p>

<p>I stared for a while in the direction she indicated.</p>

<p>'Fires,' I said heavily at length; 'three fires blazing.'</p>

<p>'Fires! but what fires could be there?' she demanded.</p>

<p>'Camp fires,' I returned.</p>

<p>The warmth engendered by our climbing ebbed out of us. The edged
wind went through us as if we were naked.</p>

<p>'We can't stay here on this bare top,' I said. 'The cold will
kill us. Are your feet wet, Terry? Mine are sopping. We'd best go
down&mdash;at least we can have a fire there&mdash;We were mad not
to take coats,' I said as we descended.</p>

<p>'We never dreamt&mdash;' she began.</p>

<p>'We should have dreamt,' I interrupted her roughly. 'We should
know by this time what to expect.'</p>

<p>She kept silent for a time, following me through wreaths which
hid morasses and holes amongst rocks.</p>

<p>'Was it camp fires you said, Hugh?' she asked breathlessly,
hurrying to come up beside me. 'Those men are camped, is that what
you meant?'</p>

<p>'Probably for the night,' I assured her with more conviction
than I felt. 'The storm will chase them out of the mountains pretty
soon.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad for the snow,' she said. 'Do you think they're on
their way out of this country?'</p>

<p>'I'm sure of it,' I answered. 'What would keep them in this
bitter desolation?'</p>

<p>'What kept ourselves here?' I asked myself a moment afterwards,
mocking my own hope. We lighted a fire once again to dry our
stockings. It was not yet near day. We ate the last of our meat.
The interminable hours rode over us. We longed for day to come
though we expected nothing from day but the knowledge that time
indeed passed. Before the sun rose on the peak of the Farrow a
string of deer came up from feeding all night in the wood. I killed
a calf with a lucky shot. We wrapped its liver and the best of its
ribs in moss and buried them in the embers of our fire to cook. We
were ravenously hungry.</p>

<p>'What are we going to do?' Terry asked when we had eaten of that
revolting mess of half-cooked meat.</p>

<p>'Do?' I echoed bitterly. 'Wait, nothing but wait.'</p>

<p>'Here where we are?' she went on.</p>

<p>'Oh, not here, nothing so comfortable and easy,' I returned.
'But in the thickest depths of that wood, skulking there&mdash;it's
time to go.'</p>

<p>We had scarcely penetrated the fringes of the wood when a
rustling close by arrested us. Terry, behind me, cried out, 'Hugh!
lie down! a man with a gun!'</p>

<p>Upon her words the sound of a shot-gun crashed out and pellets,
fired from too great a distance to harm us or else deflected by the
branches of trees, pattered round us.</p>

<p>'Lie still!' I shouted to Terry, throwing myself flat. I
commenced to worm a way downhill behind a screen of trees in the
direction from which the gun fired. Every thought of danger was out
of my head. I recked of nothing save lust to avenge on this
skulking murderer the misery we endured, the shame and fear of our
flight before his like. I heard the noise of feet like a man
running, and leapt to my feet in time to see a figure scurrying
through a glade, making for the shelter of trees lower down the
hill. My rifle came to my shoulder, it steadied, it followed him,
aimed full in the centre of his craven back. He was as good as
dead. I saw him in imagination tumbling like a stricken deer.
Exultation welled up with rage in me; I delayed shooting to savour
and protract the sweetness of revenge. My finger crooked on the
trigger, taking the first pull, tightening for the second. When I
hear my rifle fire I am always surprised, as if in the last instant
my hand acted unawares of my head; I waited for that surprise, as
rigid as a rock. I had never felt such burning joy as filled me
while I waited for my weak finger to crook and drag him down and
avenge all we suffered. He bolted for the trees. He was on the edge
of the safety he must not reach, though he might grasp it, when
Terry's hands seized the rifle. Terry's voice came from the normal
world into the dreadful country that I tenanted.</p>

<p>'Hugh! Hugh! Hugh!' she shouted, dragging and pulling the rifle
towards her. I stared at her for a second as if she was a stranger,
and she at me with eyes alight with terror. Her face worked, her
mouth made a soundless shape at words.</p>

<p>'You can't! you can't!' she articulated at last. I let the rifle
go and it fell between us in a crevice of rock. I was as weak as if
I had come from drowning.</p>

<p>'Terry!' I whispered in horror. I sat down on the ground and hid
my face in my hands. It was very silent round us.</p>

<p>I heard her say, 'Hugh&mdash;' and a moment later, 'Hugh!' in an
urgent voice.</p>

<p>'He's down, he's fallen!' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>I could not bear to meet her eyes. I lifted the rifle and
uncocked it. We walked together to the spot where the man lay on
his face sprawling with outstretched arms and one leg doubled under
him. I gathered his shot-gun from where he flung it when he fled.
It was an old hammer-gun so loose in the lock I heard it clank as I
caught hold of it.</p>

<p>'He's dead!' Terry cried, starting to run. At her approach the
man stirred; he clutched the ground with his hands to drag himself
on. When he could not, and his limbs refused to obey, he trembled
and hideous whimpering noises came from him.</p>

<p>Terry stooped over him whispering, 'Hush! don't be afraid!'</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his shoulder while she spoke. At her touch
he shuddered violently. He uttered such a scream of terror as will
never be out of my ears. I hear it now, the voice of incarnate fear
to death. What terror had ever we? My heart stood still, my flesh
crept. But Terry spoke on, telling him to be at peace. He commenced
to sob and rack his throat with coughing mingled with sobs.</p>

<p>'We must lift him,' she said, looking up at me. 'He must be sore
hurt.'</p>

<p>When I essayed to move him he screamed again with pain. I raised
him in my arms. He had no more weight than a feather. His bare
flesh showed through his tattered rags. His face was like a skull,
his lips were blue. His blazing eyes closed gently.</p>

<p>'He's dead,' I muttered.</p>

<p>Terry thrust her hand into his breast, through his dirty torn
shirt.</p>

<p>'His heart is beating still,' she said. 'What are we going to do
with him, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'What can we do?' I asked desperately. 'He's past any help we
can give, Terry.'</p>

<p>'Is it so bad?' she whispered. 'What ails him, Hugh?'</p>

<p>'Hunger cold and fear,' I answered grimly.</p>

<p>'We can't leave him here,' she said steadily.</p>

<p>'We can't leave him here,' I echoed. 'But what can we do, where
can we take him?'</p>

<p>'Home,' she said.</p>

<p>I looked at her aghast.</p>

<p>'You saw the fires!' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Too well.'</p>

<p>'How can we go home?'</p>

<p>'How can we leave this human mortal creature to die? Oh, Hugh,
we'd risk our bones to save a dog from agony. What's a little fear,
a little danger, compared with his need?'</p>

<p>'Then we'll go home,' I said. 'Are you ready? Can you carry both
the rifles?'</p>

<p>He opened his eyes to watch us. We bent over him.</p>

<p>'We're taking you where you'll have fire, and food, and be
safe,' Terry assured him. He looked wildly at her.</p>

<p>'Let me go!' he implored. 'Let me go!' He commenced to cry
silently. Tears rolled down his grey cheeks from wide panic
eyes.</p>

<p>'You must come with us until you are well,' Terry said. 'You
can't lie here&mdash;you've hurt your leg&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Who are you?' he interrupted.</p>

<p>'Friends,' she said.</p>

<p>'Friends!' He laughed in our faces. 'There's no word friends any
more.'</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and his head fell to one side.</p>

<p>'We must carry him,' I said; 'he's not fit to walk, even with us
helping him.'</p>

<p>'Leave me alone I tell you!' he broke in angrily. A weak
delirious rage took him.</p>

<p>'Where's my gun?' he shouted. 'I know what you're after, you
want to steal my gun. Give it to me! you can't rob me! let me
go!'</p>

<p>'We'll never carry him so far,' Terry said.</p>

<p>'There's no weight in him,' I assured her. 'Now help me
up&mdash;'</p>

<p>He let himself be lifted without more show of resistance. We set
out on our path. I carried him short distances at a time, and
rested; when I was not enough revived by my halt we supported him
between us with his legs dragging on the ground. I do not think he
was ever rightly conscious. We circled the Farrow and Meall nan
Eacan by the most level route we could plan. We saw from a long
distance off that the fires in our gully were quenched. Our world
was empty as of old.</p>

<p>We pieced together the disconnected fragments of his story that
he babbled by the way; how he came farther and farther north from
the blasted cities hunting for food; how his wife died, and he
skulked in hiding every day.</p>

<p>No man was safe, no man had friends, no man helped another,
every man's hand was ready to strike.</p>

<p>So we came home to our cave and laid him in our bed and
quickened his flickering pulse with a sup of the whisky Duncan
brought.</p>

<p>'I'll fetch the haunches of that stag I killed,' I promised.
'To-morrow in the morning early. I know where it lies. We must have
proper food, for him too. Rest a while,' I besought Terry. 'I'll
make a shake-down on the floor where you can sleep a little, I'll
watch&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I can't sleep,' she answered. 'Let me sit here, it won't be for
long, Hugh.'</p>

<p>I shook my head. 'We came too late,' I said.</p>

<p>'When you bring home the stag, and he's&mdash;he's free, what
then?' she asked.</p>

<p>'What then? How do you mean "What then?"' I demanded.</p>

<p>'Are we staying here?'</p>

<p>'Where else can we go, Terry? We know the country here. You
heard what he said, there's danger every place.'</p>

<p>'I'm not speaking about danger, Hugh.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I asked harshly, 'what are you speaking about?'</p>

<p>'I don't need to answer that for you to know what I mean, do I,
Hugh?' she said. 'How safe are we here, if safety's all that
counts? Oh, if we run and hide and kill like wolves at bay, we can
escape what's come to him, and them in the valley, for a time, for
a few weeks&mdash;months!&mdash;years!&mdash;what does it matter
how long we enjoy safety like that? Safety to become savages like
the men we saw!'</p>

<p>'And if we go do we avoid that?' I cried. 'What use will it
serve to run our heads into danger?'</p>

<p>'Great use, if we do it to help other folk, Hugh. We've fed
while they starved, we've slept when they wandered distracted with
fear.'</p>

<p>'Help other folk!' I laughed. 'Great help we can give! grand
helpers we! Assisting others when we can't save ourselves. We've
had to go without food too, Terry, and wander distracted with fear.
Who'll help us?'</p>

<p>'Ourselves, when we help others. We helped him.' She pointed to
the still figure in the hammock.</p>

<p>'Aye, and how were we met? Will others aim as badly as he
did?'</p>

<p>'It's a chance we've got to take.'</p>

<p>'Not chance but certainty. Why? To keep the dying flame of life
flickering for a few painful extra moments?'</p>

<p>Colour came into her cheeks and her eyes began to sparkle.</p>

<p>'Are you bent on saying things to hurt me?' she cried. 'Should
we have left this creature, this fellow mortal, there, alone?
You're not quarrelling with me, Hugh, but with yourself, you're
saying things you don't believe.'</p>

<p>'Tell me how to say what I believe when I don't know what it
is!' I exclaimed. 'Then we should have stayed, we should never have
come here.'</p>

<p>'We had to come,' she answered gravely. 'Nothing else would have
taught us&mdash;this.' Her eyes went to our dying guest.</p>

<p>'Dear, dear lesson!' I muttered.</p>

<p>'All that's worth learning is dearly paid for,' she said.</p>

<p>I went to the mouth of the cave to regard the scene we must
forsake. I sat there like a stone for a long time. The stable
edifice of our life was collapsing, and like one bewildered by the
untimely stroke of chance that wrecks all I could not see a way or
light or plan. Our habit of life must alter, to what shape I could
not guess. Our stay was ended. Yet as I watched the hills, the
shattered custom of our life began to form itself anew. If this
hour ended a season of our lives, then it made complete that which
it finished; with this regard our life, spent in this place, grew
whole and rounded before my eyes.</p>

<p>'We can't carry all our stuff with us,' I said a long time
later.</p>

<p>'We must choose what we need most,' Terry said. 'The rest will
be safe here; we can come for it if we have use for it.'</p>

<p>If we go from here we'll never come back. I do not speak to tell
her what my mind fashions and my thoughts revolve. Why should I vex
her with the thoughts that plague my unquiet head? I did not
realize she was so much wiser than I, till now. It's best to go,
it's wise; but I alone would never go. She'd go; I led her amiss
when I brought her here. Or did we behave well when we fled and
came here? Have I misled&mdash;oh hush, hush, mad head that seeks
and seeks for certainty, finding none. It's best to go.</p>

<p>She came to my side.</p>

<p>'We were happy here,' she said.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I answered with an effort to be calm. 'We were
happy.'</p>

<p>'Are you sad to leave?' she whispered.</p>

<p>I nodded, I could not speak.</p>

<p>'It's best to go,' I said a moment later.</p>

<p>'Best to go,' she echoed. 'We're human folk, Hugh. Our place is
with our fellows. We can't forsake them just to keep ourselves
safe.'</p>

<p>I am glad we are going. I see the road we were bound on, that
same way trod by the men whose work, smashed relics of living men,
lies decaying in the valley. All fated and tied to destruction.
Destruction battens on the men who feed it. I lusted for this
creature's death. If he died then, not in our hammock, where could
I escape? He was as light as a feather in my arms.</p>

<p>Terry burns with pity. Rage and fear live intertwined, to have
compassion and lend aid is the only shield that fear will not
strike down. I am not afraid. Nothing worse can happen to us than
the fate which dogs us every day we quit our cave to hunt for food.
Though we meet fate now we face it without dread. We are victors
over fate when we choose well, though it destroy us.</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>11 OCTOBER</h2>

<p>IT IS WEARING on to dusk and we are ready to go. We have been
hard at work since early morning. Immediately it was light I went
for the haunches of the stag I killed on Meall nan Eacan. I could
not go yesterday. Terry boiled the venison to carry with us. We
have a heavy load to take. Who'd imagine we'd collect so much stuff
together into this cave?</p>

<p>Terry is flushed and excited like a girl. We are leaving our
diary behind us. Its use is past. I made the last scratch on our
wall deep and long to signify an end.</p>

<p>Moments of departure are narrow doors, small portals to the
limitless void. We are careless of to-morrow. We know we are going
rightly; we carry that safeguard with us wherever we venture. We
have been very careful here, planning each day's work in advance,
regulating our hours. And happy too.</p>

<p>Terry is bending over my shoulder. She lays her hand on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>'I'm ready,' she says.</p>

<p>I shall close the door with a slab of stone. We are happy to
go.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>NIGHT</h2>

<p>TERRY IS DEAD. When I see it there&mdash;Terry is dead. Why do I
keep on writing for none to read, rending my heart to write Terry
is dead. No, no, this is the pencil she gave me, nothing's changed,
all's the same, this is our cave, our home. These walls that
shelter us&mdash;I strike my hands on the rock. It's rock, this is
her pencil, speak to me, Terry. Terry is dead. She won't speak,
she's dead. What's dead, a word, a sound, a thing of no account?
Dead, dead, dead. Waken, blind fool, din death to crack the frozen
air until your ears hear and your mind knows and your heart
believes Terry is dead.</p>

<p>She went dancing before me down into the gully. She never looked
back at the place we were leaving. We climbed the far side of the
ravine, slowly with our load. It was dark when we came out on the
summit.</p>

<p>'Keep close to me,' I said. 'We'll strike the path to Dalwhinnie
soon.'</p>

<p>'I'm here, give me your hand,' she whispered.</p>

<p>We advanced carefully. All of a sudden I heard sounds like low
voices near us.</p>

<p>'Hush,' I said, halting to listen.</p>

<p>She stumbled over a stone and her feet dislodged a loose
rock.</p>

<p>A voice cried, 'Who's there?' We stood motionless. The voice
called a second time. Then a rifle fired twice, and once again. The
first two bullets screamed over our heads, the third struck heavily
beside me. Terry seemed to wince, and stumble against me. She said,
'Hugh!' in a faint voice.</p>

<p>'Don't be frightened,' I whispered. 'We're quite safe.'</p>

<p>She did not answer. How could she answer when she was dead?</p>

<p>I brought her home. Christ make them stay till morning.</p>

<p>THEY WERE LYING asleep in the same place, four of them together.
I watched them while the day lightened. I trained my rifle on them
one by one. When it was bright enough for me to see my sights I
tried to say, 'Waken!' I could only whisper the word. I said
'Waken!' until my breath obeyed me, and they heard me call. They
stirred uneasily, they roused, they sat up. I waited, savouring
their fear. I turned the safety catch of my rifle deliberately that
they might find me. Their eyes fell on me. They began to go for
their rifles. My brain was cold and clear like ice. As I brought
them down, one after one, I counted One, Two, Three. The fourth
flung himself to one side at the moment I fired. I hit him but not
where I aimed. He came to his knees with his rifle in his hands. We
fired together. He missed me, but I struck him. I was aiming full
at his breast when I saw Terry between myself and him. Her eyes
gazed at me, her outstretched hands pleaded. I could not shoot. Her
image faded and I jumped to my feet with my handkerchief in my
hand. I dropped my rifle as I went towards my enemy. His wavering
rifle fired from the hip. I saw it vomit flame before the bullet
struck my breast with a force like a hammer blow. In a blur I saw
him tumble backwards. I stood alone on the hill-top in the light of
the rising sun, staggering like a drunk man, vomiting blood. The
deep-ranked peaks climbed out of the morning to circle me
round.</p>

<p>I came home, dragging myself along the ground by the failing
strength of my arms. I lighted the lamp in our cave. There's very
little oil, enough for me. I dragged the slab of stone over the
mouth of the cave after me to close our tomb. I can scarcely see. I
hear my breath bubbling in my chest. The fire that burned me's
quenched. Not long now, Terry. I'll lay myself down on our couch of
birch and close my eyes to sleep. We were happy too, Terry. Terry,
my love, my heart, my life.</p>
