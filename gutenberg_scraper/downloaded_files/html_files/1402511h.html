  <h2><a id="note" name="note"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h2>

  <p class="note">This newly-found short novel is presumably Fred M. White's
  first venture into the genre of science-fiction.&#8224; It pre-dates the
  "Doom of London" series, which made its first appearance in <i>Pearson's
  Magazine</i> in 1903, by almost 11 years. The e-book edition offered here was
  produced from digital images of the serial published in the British boys'
  magazine <i>Illustrated Chums</i>, copies of which are archived in the
  <a href="http://search.lib.cam.ac.uk/?q=illustrated+chips&x=15&y=11">Digital
  Resources Section</a> of the Cambridge University Library.</p>

  <p class="note">Readers who are familiar with the works of Fred M. White will
  notice that the style of <i>The Island of Shadows</i> is somewhat atypical. A
  possible explanation for this is that White was catering to the
  medium&#8212;a cheap boys'magazine&#8212;and its sensation-hungry
  readership.</p>

  <p class="note">However, the mention in <i>Illustrated Chums</i> that the
  author of the present book was also the author of a work entitled <i>In the
  Eye of the Law</i> gives rise to speculation that it might have been penned
  by another writer altogether&#8212;a journalist by the name of Fred M.
  White&#8225; who was on the staff of the 19th-century London newspaper
  <i>The Morning Star</i>.</p>

  <p class="note">The reason for this speculation is that, to date, no other
  record could be found of a book by any author named Fred M. White published
  under the title <i>In the Eye of the Law</i>. Information from readers who
  can shed light on this issue would be appreciated.</p>

  <p class="note">Regardless of the question of authorship, Roy Glashan's
  Library and Project Gutenberg Australia are proud to offer their readers a
  "lost" late-Victorian science-fiction novel that has never before appeared in
  book form.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&#8224; Cf. the article on Fred M. White in the on-line
  <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/white_fred_m"><i>Encyclopedia
  of Science Fiction</i></a>.]</p>

  <p class="footnote">[&#8225; On October 23, 1895, the <i>Pall Mall
  Gazette</i> published the following obituary: "By a curious coincidence, the
  death is also announced to-day and at the same age [67] of Mr. Fred M White,
  a veteran London journalist, whose name in associated in the minds of his
  friends with the same troublous times in the history of the Italian people.
  He knew Mazzini; and his sister Jessie married Count Mario, a devoted
  follower of Garibaldi. Madame Jesse Mario, who is living in Italy still, has
  written the lives of both Mazzini and Garibaldi. Mr. White was on the
  editorial staff of the <i>Morning Star</i>, under Mr. John Morley, and in
  1870 he joined the Press Association, of the original staff of which he was
  the oldest member, being the senior of the present manager, Mr. Edmund
  Robbins, as he used humorously to boast, by an hour. He only retired from the
  Association at the end of last on a pension. He was a man of much literary
  ability, of a singularly modest disposition, and a kindly, generous soul. He
  was beloved by all his colleagues, to whom he was known as the
  "Field-Marshal."]</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <p class="first">ON a fine March evening some five years ago there sat, in
  the bay window of an old-fashioned Greenwich hostelry, two men who were
  pondering deeply over a confused mass of charts and plans that lay before
  them. The redly-setting sun flashed upon the bosom of the river, with its
  picturesque mass of shipping and masts like grey needles pointing to the sky,
  an flooded the low-roofed oak-panelled room, in which the men were seated,
  with a golden glory. They had the apartment quite to themselves, no other
  feet disturbed the sanded floor, and no maritime reveller disturbed the
  hallowed sanctuary of the place.</p>

  <p>Concerning the quiet beauty of the scene, the flashing, winding river
  melting away into the golden horizon, the two men saw or cared nothing. The
  older of the twain had the air and manner of one born to the sea, his hard,
  rugged face was bronzed by a thousand gales, his bright blue eyes were keen
  and fearless, and his white hair seemed almost out of place on a man whose
  frame was as muscular and powerful as it had been five-and-twenty years
  before. Tom Armstrong, generally known by the generic title of Captain
  Armstrong, might have boasted, had he been a boasting man, that there was no
  quarter of the globe unfamiliar to him. For nearly five years he had given up
  the sea and lived retired on a small competency he had amassed, devoting his
  time to scientific pursuits, of which he was passionately fond. Very few
  people knew the extent of his knowledge in this direction, and few people
  were aware of the really startling discoveries that lay dormant in that
  magnificent old sea lion's head.</p>

  <p>Armstrong's companion, Harold Coventry by name, was a young man somewhere
  about six-and-twenty years of age. Like his companion, the sea was his
  passion, and, whilst being anything but a well-to-do man, he contrived to
  maintain a small yacht, in which he had penetrated into every sea. His
  friendship with Armstrong was a long one, and from him he had derived all his
  knowledge of seamanship, a craft to which he had taken by instinct, for
  Coventry belonged to a famous old naval family, whose name had been a
  powerful one from the days of Elizabeth onwards. More than one Coventry had
  found his way to fortune on the Spanish Main in company with Drake and
  Frobisher and Martin. But a long course of adventuring and reckless
  plundering in search of excitement had had its effect and now the last of the
  Coventrys had nothing remaining to him besides the record of family glory by
  sea, an income of some three hundred pounds yearly, and a mass of papers,
  parchment and documents which were a matter of vague curiosity to him and a
  source of unfailing delight to Armstrong.</p>

  <p>They had them out now, in Armstrong's room in "The Mermaid," the strong
  spring light falling upon faded papers and yellow parchments, and more
  especially upon the shred of parchment Armstrong held in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You nay make as much fun of me as you like," he said; "but I am
  right."</p>

  <p>"So, in this instance. Though I generally find you to be correct," Harold
  replied. "There is part of the cypher; the legend in our family came home to
  me intact concerning this fabulous treasure, and that is all I know."</p>

  <p>"Let me repeat the story you told me," Armstrong said quietly. "Your
  ancestor, Amyas Coventry, with three other gentlemen adventurers, sailed from
  Plymouth in the month of June 1579, and after a successful voyage, reached
  Vera Cruz. He had his only daughter, Valerie, with him, a child of fourteen
  years. It was a strange thing to take a girl like that, but he took her. In
  the log-book of the Albatross, his ship, which is now in your possession, I
  find the following passage."</p>

  <p>Armstrong took up a parchment-covered volume filled with symbols and
  scientific signs, and turning to a well-thumbed page, read as
  follows:&#8212;</p>

  <p class="letter">"March 18, 1581.&#8212;Dyd this dae take after much peryl
  and adventure, ye Spanish bark, Don Gonzola, a prize of exceedinge value.
  Amongst ye treasure we found doubloons to ye value of eighty thousand pounds
  English, also rix dollars to a great many more times thatte sum, and being in
  ye Gulf of Mexico about three degrees west of Havana and one north of the
  Island of Pines did land on the island called Santa Anna, and bury ye
  treasure, whereof ye exact spotte and ye bearing of ye same are given in ye
  cypher what follows."</p>

  <p>"Very well then," Armstrong went on, "we know that treasure to the extent
  of something more than a million pounds of our money lies buried there.''</p>

  <p>"Yes," Coventry interrupted, "but where is the island? I was there all
  last summer in the <i>Firefly</i>, and although I went over every inch of
  ground there is positively no such island extant. There can be no possible
  mistake on this point, as log-book and observations will clearly
  demonstrate."</p>

  <p>Armstrong searched amongst his papers until he produced what he required.
  It was an ancient chart of the Gulf of Mexico, and upon it was fully set out
  the various places therein. Upon one spot he placed a bony forefinger, and as
  Harold looked down he saw the words "Santa Anna" marked on the yellow
  parchment.</p>

  <p>"It is very strange," he said, "and yet I am certain I am right. If that
  chart is correct the island must have disappeared."</p>

  <p>But Armstrong did not smile; he regarded his young companion gravely.</p>

  <p>"It has disappeared," he said, gravely. "By consulting the chart and going
  carefully into your observations I have satisfied myself that you must have
  sailed over the very place where Santa Anna was."</p>

  <p>"In which case we need not give ourselves any further trouble in this
  matter."</p>

  <p>"In which case," Armstrong repeated, gravely, "the trouble is about to
  begin. I am going to find that island and raise it to sea level again."</p>

  <p>Harold laughed heartily. He knew something of Armstrong's visionary ideas,
  but the suggestion of raising a submerged island out of three hundred fathoms
  of water was wild and romantic even for the scientist before him.</p>

  <p>"People always laugh at what they don't understand," Armstrong said, quite
  unmoved by Harold's laughter. "My theory is that the island was a coral one,
  one of those floating masses which rise to the surface and gradually
  accumulate matter until they become quite a respectable size. You know what
  vegetation in the tropics is and how rapidly things grow. Well, Santa Anna
  grew and spread, the birds brought the seeds there, trees grew, and the soil
  became fertile. But at the same time the island was a floating one, anchored
  to its moorings by the long tenacious fibres of weed and other marine plants
  like millions of ropes, each in itself fragile, but when combined, capable of
  keeping a continent in place. We know the island was there, we need not argue
  that, and for the sake of argument we admit that it was composed of coral.
  Now I come to a vital point. What caused it to disappear, or to speak more
  plainly, to sink?</p>

  <p>"You think the island did sink then?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"Beyond question, there is no other way to account for it. But why? For
  months I have been reading old voyages and adventures, both in manuscript and
  print, but at last my search has been rewarded. In the beginning of the
  seventeenth century, so I read in an old volume, a violent irruption took
  place on the island of Caraba, so violent, says the chronicle, that for fifty
  miles around the sea was one mass of dust and liquid fire, and no one could
  approach within the radius. When the irruption was over, sailors were
  surprised to hear that several islands round had entirely disappeared, burnt
  up, as they thought is their ignorance, but sank, as we know now. How far is
  Caraba from the spot where the island of Santa Anna ought to be?"</p>

  <p>"Not far; certainly not more than thirty miles as the crow flies."</p>

  <p>"Which all tends to prove my theory," Armstrong said, calmly. "You see
  that raft and the men below? If I were to pile it two feet high all over with
  blocks of stone, what would happen to it, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"It would sink, Tom; even I can answer that question."</p>

  <p>"Precisely in the same way the volcano at Caraba sunk Santa Anna.
  Thousands and thousands of tons of stone were thrown upon the thin coral
  shell, till gradually the weight, which was naturally equally distributed,
  pressed it down, and it settled to the bottom. Santa Anna buried in three
  hundred fathoms of water."</p>

  <p>"It seems plausible enough," Harold replied; "but it is gone. There is an
  end of it."</p>

  <p>"So some people would think; but I believe nothing to be impossible. So
  convinced do I feel of the fact that there is treasure there that I am going
  to put all my money into a venture to try and recover it. All we have to do
  is to get out to Caraba and go from thence to the island of Mea Culpa, which
  is within two miles of where Santa Anna used to be, and then raise the
  island."</p>

  <p>Harold glanced at his companion in astonishment, but there was no glare of
  madness in Armstrong's glittering blue eyes as he puffed steadily at his
  pipe.</p>

  <p>Much respect as he had for Armstrong's wonderful scientific knowledge,
  Harold could not do otherwise than regard the present suggestion as the wild
  scheme of a visionary. But the wonderful things done by Armstrong had been so
  many and so strange that it was never safe to contradict him on any matter of
  theory.</p>

  <p>"Even if you can do it," Harold said, "it might take years to find the
  treasure."</p>

  <p>"It might, because you see you have only half the cypher. And now I verily
  believe I have discovered where the other half is. Latterly I have been
  spending a deal of time at the British Museum and, naturally, I have been
  reading all the books relating to the Gulf of Mexico, especially those
  bearing upon volcanic eruption. Several times lately I have noticed a
  Spaniard, whose name I find in Barrados, has been interested in much the same
  volumes. Seeing that we were both engaged in similar pursuits, I spoke to
  him, and though he was taciturn at first, he warmed up wonderfully when I
  asked him if, in the course of his reading, he had come across any mention of
  an island of Santa Anna. It was the very object of his own research.</p>

  <p>"You do not mean that?" Harold said with deepest interest. "Did he say
  more?"</p>

  <p>"He will be here presently to speak for himself," Armstrong replied. "The
  man has in his possession the missing half of the cypher."</p>

  <p>An exclamation of astonishment broke from Harold. He would have asked for
  further information had not the door opened at that moment and a stranger
  entered.</p>

  <p>He was a dark, powerful-looking individual, with handsome, but somewhat
  sinister features, and he glanced very suspiciously at Harold as Armstrong
  performed the necessary ceremony of introduction.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Miguel Barrados, Mr. Harold Coventry," he said. "It appears that Mr.
  Barrados can claim a relationship to you, although it is very slight, because
  Valerie Coventry, Amyas Coventry's daughter, married an ancestor of his."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better explain," Barrados took up the thread.</p>

  <p>"I know all about you, sir, from Captain Armstrong, but you know nothing
  of me. After the treasure was hidden at Santa Anna. Amyas Coventry fell into
  the hands of my father, who commanded a ship in the Spanish Navy. As a
  freebooter he was condemned to death, but contrived to escape, and what
  became of him afterwards I am unable to say.</p>

  <p>"But we took his ship back to Spain, and in the course of time Valerie
  Coventry, who remained with them, married the son of the man who had captured
  her father's vessel.</p>

  <p>"There is a tradition in our family that she used to relate a story of how
  Amyas Coventry concealed a vast treasure at Santa Anna.</p>

  <p>"No one was really interested in this until I discovered that at one time
  such an island as Santa Anna really existed.</p>

  <p>"The story was further borne out by the fact that my ancestress, Valerie
  Barrados, handed down to her descendants part of a cypher written on
  parchment, the other half being retained by her father, she said, he having
  taken the precaution to divide it in case he should happen to fall into the
  hands of enemies.</p>

  <p>"The coincidence, and my meeting with Captain Armstrong, is a very
  singular one, but as a proof that I am only speaking the truth, I will
  produce my half of the cypher."</p>

  <p>Without further preamble, Barrados drew from his pocket a little leather
  case, and took therefrom a dingy scrap of parchment. With some natural
  excitement, Armstrong unlocked an iron safe and took out another piece. of
  vellum-like substance, and, approaching the window so that he might have the
  full benefit of the light, put the ragged edges together.</p>

  <p>"It is the missing portion," he said, exultingly; "see for
  yourselves."</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The three men eagerly scanned the cypher.</p>

  <p>It was written in an uncertain hand with many strange signs, was all
  tattered and stained, and altogether looked anything but a valuable document,
  yet it contained, no doubt, the secret of the hidden treasure, if they could
  but decipher it.</p>

  <p>Harold and Barrados looked down at the letter, and this is what they
  saw:&#8212;</p>

  <p><a id="pic016" name="pic016"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-Letter.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Not much to be made out of that," Harold laughed, after all three had
  examined the cypher intently. "There are the usual skulls, but nothing
  beyond.</p>

  <p>"Doubtless, if we could be at the island, the cypher would be plain
  enough," Armstrong replied, "and I for one think it can be done."</p>

  <p>"You may count on my assistance in that ease," Barrados remarked quietly.
  "I know you are a man of marked ingenuity, Captain Armstrong, and if you can
  show me how that is to be done, I do not mind risking £1,000 in the venture;
  that is, of course, if Mr. Coventry, who is equally interested, will do the
  same."</p>

  <p>They both of them turned to Harold Armstrong, with his blue eyes flashing,
  and Barrados, with something like a challenge in his face. It was a lot of
  money to risk upon a visionary venture, but the spirit of the gambler was
  upon him.</p>

  <p>"I will do it," he said. "Armstrong, when will you be ready to start?"</p>

  <p>Armstrong rose from his seat and paced the room in strong excitement. In
  his mind's eye he saw already the accomplishment of his desire.</p>

  <p>"Let us go at once," he said. "All we want is Coventry's yacht, manned by
  an extra fellow or two, who will make himself generally useful, and the less
  fuss we make the better. My scientific apparatus is a matter requiring but
  little time to prepare. I can be ready to sail in a week."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <p class="first">IT is a long jump from the bay-windowed room at Greenwich,
  overlooking the Thames, to an island in the Gulf of Mexico, but one that the
  reader's imagination will easily compass. The hour was not long before sunset
  began to tinge the blue waters stretching away to the horizon, and in a quiet
  little bay a peculiar scene was being enacted. To the dark-skinned inhabitant
  of the fertile palm-clad island of Mea Culpa, the little band of Englishmen
  were merely enthusiasts who had come out on an expedition to discover
  something of no possible interest, and their operations elicited only languid
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>The yacht lay up in a little natural cove; most of the sailors had made
  their way to Havana, on the understanding that they would not he required for
  at least a month, so that there only remained the three original promoters
  and a certain Irish sailor, Larry O'Brady by name, a shrewd dare-devil
  individual whose admiration for Armstrong amounted to a passion. He could
  speak Spanish fluently and for this reason they had decided to retain
  him.</p>

  <p>Some huts had been erected on the shore by permission of Don Zalva de
  Torredos, to whom Mea Culpa belonged, and whose <i>hacienda</i> was the only
  building of any importance. The adventurers found him a courtly, educated
  gentleman who took a great interest in the operations, as also did his
  daughter, Haidee, a dark, olive-complexioned, middling-aged beauty, who as
  time went on, contrived to distract Harold's attention from the work in hand.
  It was very pleasant to lounge up at the <i>hacienda</i> in the evenings,
  when the air was heavy with the scent of myrtles and the fireflies flashed in
  the purple darkness, chatting with the silver-voiced Haidee and looking into
  her beautiful eyes. But Armstrong didn't like it: he saw trouble looming in
  the distance. The same charm attracted Barrados, who looked on gloomily at
  what appeared to be the Englishman's success. Larry, too, had found a
  congenial companion in Haidee's maid, Isidore and many were the growls which
  he caused from the picturesome cigarette-smoking natives, who resented what
  they regarded as an infringement of their rights.</p>

  <p>But no such thoughts troubled Armstrong on that perfect, still evening, as
  he stood on the shore looking out to sea. Behind him stood the tents and the
  wooden workroom, and before him a section of pontoon bridge formed of a
  series of light rafts running some two miles into the sea, at the end of
  which was a platform upon which Coventry and Barrados were standing.</p>

  <p>Armstrong picked his way carefully along the pontoon, followed by O'Brady,
  who appeared to regard the whole thing as a huge joke got up for his own
  edification. In the course of time they reached the platform that lay still
  and solid in the glassy sea with three hundred fathoms of water below.</p>

  <p>"Do you think we are out far enough?" Coventry asked. "According to the
  calculations, the raft we are on now ought to be exactly over Santa Anna,
  which was merely a hanger-on of the Mea Culpa&#8212;"</p>

  <p>Which was originally coral, and became stranded on a shoal which, although
  so close by Santa Anna, was sunk in deep water. We are over the island right
  enough. O'Brady, have you laid the composite line as I told you?</p>

  <p>By way of reply, O'Brady raised from the raft a long, thin tube, about the
  sixty-fourth part of an inch in diameter which apparently was connected with
  the shore. Attached to the end was a tiny nozzle which, as Armstrong touched
  a tap, emitted a stream of some dark fluid which penetrated the water and
  left, to the astonishment of the onlookers, a funnel-shaped opening therein.
  In other words, for the space of some few minutes, a continual hole was left
  in the water as if it had been a solid substance.</p>

  <p>"Well, by the powers, but that's a funny thing now," O'Brady commented.
  "I've often heard tell of making a hole in the water, but never seen it done
  before. Sure, Captain, you'll make the Channel Tunnel with a pop-gun, after
  all."</p>

  <p>"There are many things more unlikely," Armstrong returned, calmly. "By
  this means I propose to stand on this raft and examine different parts of the
  island."</p>

  <p>"But you don't mean to say that, with a little tube and a jet of liquid,
  you can create a circular vacuum in three hundred fathoms of water?" Harold
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I do, although it is only a matter of minutes. I have been
  labouring on this invention for years. By means of the dynamo which is
  working in my workshop at the moment I create a mixture of ether and a
  substance I call <i>onthal</i>, for want of a better name. The effect of this
  extraordinary mixture is to repel water by the generation of certain gases
  made by the contact, and which lasts for some time."</p>

  <p>"Could you create a vacuum large enough and permanent enough to enable us
  to descend to the bottom, provided we had the necessary appliances?" said
  Barrados.</p>

  <p>"Well, frankly, no. If I had the force of Niagara to drive my dynamo, I
  could create a vacuum in the Atlantic a thousand miles square, but with the
  few appliances at my command, I can only guarantee a circular shaft, as if a
  chimney led up from the ocean's bed, about two feet in diameter."</p>

  <p>With these words Armstrong pointed his tiny jet downwards, and in an
  incredibly short space of time the interested spectators were looking into a
  deep well eighteen hundred feet sheer, large enough to contain the body of a
  man, the sides appearing to be carved out of solid ice. Harold took a small
  coin from his pocket and pitched it into the funnel. It seemed to be minutes
  before an answering echo came as it struck some hard substance below.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I thought," Armstrong cried; "try another coin, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>Harold did as directed, and again there came the same sharp ring.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Armstrong went on. "The bed formation of this gulf is sand
  and mud; below us there is apparently a rich formation, which confirms my
  theory that Santa Anna was sunk by the stone and lava thrown up by the
  volcano on the island of Caraba. Allowing something for speculation, those
  coins probably fell upon the lava with which Santa Anna is covered."</p>

  <p>The speaker turned off the dark stream of fluid, and presently there came
  a hoarse, sullen rumbling from the bottom of the funnel. It seemed to close
  rapidly, as if filled by a tremendous subterranean spring, and as it closed
  there arose in the air a jet of water to the height of some hundreds of feet,
  the raft rocked like a boat on a troubled sea, a shower of stones&#8212;some
  of them of massive dimensions&#8212;fell upon the pontoon.</p>

  <p>"Just as I expected," Armstrong remarked coolly as he examined one of the
  fragments, "these stones are decidedly volcanic."</p>

  <p>Coventry and Barrados made no reply, they could not very well venture to
  express anything like a sound opinion in the presence of that master
  mind.</p>

  <p>"I hope it's all right," O'Brady said, uneasily. "But sure, and I don't
  like these devils tricks, and this playin' with the laws of Nature. Bedad,
  when I go to sea again I'd like to have a bottle of that liquor."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that we are any nearer to our object," Barrados remarked.
  "Couldn't you contrive to clear a space sufficient to descend without
  danger?"</p>

  <p>"No occasion to do that," Armstrong said dryly. "for the simple reason
  that I am going to descend without doing anything of the sort."</p>

  <p>"Impossible! No human being could live in three hundred fathoms of water.
  The pressure would crush a skull composed of the finest steel."</p>

  <p>"Given an equal pressure on all sides, how do you propose to crush a
  solid?" Armstrong asked. "You can break a nut between your teeth. But put on
  a million times the same <i>steady</i> pressure, like the force of water, for
  instance, and the nut defies you. Upon this theory I propose to act. I am not
  going to have any submarine tubes. I am merely going to make myself
  <i>solid</i>."</p>

  <p>An incredulous smile broke out on the faces of Barrados and Coventry.</p>

  <p>"I am going to make myself solid." Armstrong repeated. "You cannot gainsay
  the authenticity of the fakirs who sleep in a tomb for months at a time in a
  state of suspended animation. This suspended animation is easy enough; to get
  the same result and still be in possession of all the faculties is quite a
  different thing. This to what I propose to do."</p>

  <p>"It's witchcraft." O'Brady remarked, "nothin' less. I shouldn't be
  surprised to find myself turned into a wizard at any moment. And that's a
  nice thing for a respectable man born of a decent family."</p>

  <p>"I think I follow you," Harold said, with deep interest. "So long as
  animation&#8212; that is, so far as concerns the organs of the body&#8212; is
  suspended, you could live and move under water for any reasonable length of
  time. Can you suspend the heart and lungs and yet retain the use of the limbs
  and the brain?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Suppose I could live with my mouth and ears and nostrils
  closed--that is, suspend the mere physical act of breathing&#8212; I could
  remain under water for days or even longer, and thus discover&#8212;."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what about the pressure we spoke of?" Barrados interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Did not I tell you that I propose to make myself solid?" Armstrong asked,
  with the greatest calmness. "So far as a knowledge of the matter required to
  sustain life is concerned we are the greatest fools imaginable; we supply the
  furnace of life and let it run down before replenishing again. But no matter
  as to that. What I propose to do is to fill the body by injection with a
  peculiar fluid, which, when brought in contact with the gases of the body,
  becomes a gelatine. I shall simply be a living man stuffed with gelatine,
  upon which the organs of the body will thrive and remain practically neutral
  at the same time. But as chemical action is constantly taking place, and as
  this gelatine goes off in natural vapour, so it must be renewed, and this is
  done by a hollow India-rubber tube, which goes directly into the lungs, by
  means of which a constant supply is drawn from the surface into the
  body&#8212;in fact it is filtered into the system from a retort above. I need
  not tell yon that the greatest care must be exercised in this particular, as
  any neglect of the directions must naturally mean a lingering and terrible
  death."</p>

  <p>"We will admit the possibility of all this," Harold observed. "But in the
  first place, how are you going to get down there, and having once got down,
  how do you propose to return? Remember there is eighteen hundred feet of
  water below us."</p>

  <p>"It puzzles me at present, I admit," Armstrong replied, "but I shall do
  it."</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the determined ring is his voice. O'Brady looked at
  his revered chief with undisguised admiration.</p>

  <p>"Of course he will," he exclaimed, "if he made up his mind to go to the
  centre of the earth, nothing but the heat as they say is there could stop
  him. And then he'd have something in his waistcoat pocket to put the fire
  out."</p>

  <p>"We don't know what we can do till we try," Armstrong laughed at this
  tribute to his wonderful powers. "For the present I can see no tangible way
  of getting down or back again, unless it is by means of an electric screw
  machine, such as I partly worked out before I left England. I have the plates
  on the yacht and intend trying it tomorrow. If it will work downwards, we can
  come back easily enough, as all we have to do is to get inside the machine,
  exhaust the air, and rise to the surface."</p>

  <p>"But what about the hollow tubes which feed, you with gelatine?" Barrados
  asked.</p>

  <p>"We could cut those before we started, as the rise to the surface could
  only occupy a few minutes during which time no physical inconvenience would
  take place."</p>

  <p>"And once down there what do you propose to do?" said Harold.</p>

  <p>"Clear the island of the masses of stones that encumber it. Oh, you may
  laugh at me for a visionary, but I have an explosive here compared to which
  dynamite is a mere <i>seidlitz</i> powder. It is no larger than a rifle
  cartridge; yet were this to go off in my hands at this moment we should be
  not only annihilated, but the island of Mea Culpa would never be seen again.
  But of course the effect under water would be minimised, and the strength
  just sufficient to achieve our purpose. I will show you presently."</p>

  <p>"Put it down now, Captain, dear," Harold remarked, looking at the
  cartridge Armstrong reproduced in comical dismay.</p>

  <p>"It's a terrible thing that when anything happens to a Christian there
  shouldn't be enough left of him for a decent funeral, let alone a bit left of
  him to give excuse to the waking of him.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet," Armstrong replied, "and give me that box you brought
  along."</p>

  <p>Larry opened the little black box he had been carrying, and produced
  therefrom three brass tubes like binoculars, but far longer. There were
  glasses at either end and all were filled with some liquor of a thick inky
  hue.</p>

  <p>"Lean over the raft and place one end to your eyes, the other being in the
  water, and tell me what you see," Armstrong commanded.</p>

  <p>Harold and Barrados did as they were instructed and as they fixed the
  focus of the glasses a loud cry burst simultaneously from their lips. It was
  as if the water below had been dissolved and weed was swimming in the air,
  and as if they were looking down from a high precipice upon what had recently
  been a deep sea. <i>The marine telescope had the power of penetrating the
  water</i>.</p>

    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-02.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"It is wonderful," Harold exclaimed, "the ocean has disappeared and I can
  distinguish what at one time must have been Santa Anna, a rock-covered mass
  in the centre of an expanse of bright mud and shifting sand."</p>

  <p>"It is Santa Anna, beyond a doubt," Armstrong remarked, nothing moved.</p>

  <p>"And do you think it could remove those gigantic boulders," Barrados
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly. You asked me just now how I proposed to remove those boulders.
  On the other side of what, for a better name, we will call an island, you
  will notice a rock that must be at least five hundred tons in weight. I take
  one of my cartridges of <i>dolomite</i>, and, attaching a mechanical screw to
  the end, direct its course at that rock thus."</p>

  <p>With keen intentness the onlookers saw the little messenger making its way
  through the water&#8212;water which appeared like rarefied air through the
  telescope--till at length it struck the side of the rock. There arose a load
  of mud and rock. There was a tremendous booming noise whilst the raft rose
  and fell tremendously and when, finally, the vapour cleared away, the great
  rock, in size almost equal to a small house had totally disappeared.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Barrados exclaimed. "Really stupendous!"</p>

  <p>A cry broke from Harold who was still gazing through his telescope. He
  pointed forward and bade them to look at the spot where the explosion had
  taken place and where the blast was already settling down.</p>

  <p>"Don't you see that the native rock of the island has been laid bare?" he
  exclaimed in his excitement. "Upon it I can distinctly see three * * * just
  as they appear on Amyas Coventry's cypher."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <p class="first">ONCE well on the track of discovery, Armstrong was not the
  man to allow the grass to grow under his feet. A strong gale had ruffled the
  sea, rendering it impossible to do anything; and this time had been devoted
  by Armstrong to scientific research.</p>

  <p>"I should very much like to try the effect of the <i>scienatic</i> acid,"
  he said, as he emerged from his tent a few moments later. "This acid, you
  must know, is the gelatine to which I referred, and which I literally propose
  to fill myself with by the ordinary process of injection. It raises a kind of
  filmy vapour that fills up every portion of the body, after which the gastric
  juices turn it to a semi-opaque fluid of no particular flavour."</p>

  <p>"But are you certain it will act?" Harold asked a little anxiously.</p>

  <p>"So far as the human frame is concerned that is merely a matter of
  conjecture," Armstrong said, coolly. I injected some of the <i>scienatic</i>
  acid into a dog, and tying a heavy weight to the body, allowed it to remain
  under water for over two hours. When I raised it to the surface the animal
  became quite himself again directly the atmosphere acted and diffused the
  acid. What I propose to do is this: take one of the rafts, and, wearing an
  ordinary pair of divers boots, descend in about twenty fathoms of water.
  You can easily watch my movements with the glasses, and if anything goes
  wrong, haul me to the surface.</p>

  <p>The experiment was certainly hazardous but, as Armstrong had decided to
  try the experiment, Harold knew that nothing could be gained by attempting to
  turn him from his purpose.</p>

  <p>The sun was high in the heavens when they set out with the raft to a
  little bay where they knew the water did not exceed more than thirty fathoms
  anywhere. On the raft Armstrong had placed a stand containing a retort,
  which, when heated by a little spirit lamp below, gave off a certain gas
  which when again cooled by water, produced a semi-opaque fluid like starch.
  This, again, dropped into a metal cup, attached to a fine India-rubber tube
  of the required length, which Armstrong coolly pushed down his throat and
  into his stomach.</p>

  <p>"You will see what to do," he said. "The action of that metal cup is
  automatic, and allows a certain portion only of the <i>scienatic</i> acid to
  percolate into the the tube at a time. The little ball you see below here
  acts like a throttle valve, or, perhaps I should say, more like a syphon, and
  as the cup fills so one drop at it time falls into the tube, which the weight
  of the increasing acid opens for that purpose. It is bound to fly straight
  down to me, as the air being exhausted it the tube, my lungs act as a
  force-pump of practically boundless power. Be careful to keep up exactly the
  same quantity of heat under the retort: and now, when my face becomes
  colourless and rigid, drop me feet first into the water, and at least two of
  you lower me to the bottom by a cord tied round my waist."</p>

  <p>As Armstrong spoke, a change gradually began to come over him. His arms
  and legs appeared to retain their natural functions, but his body became
  stiff and rigid, and his chest and stomach distended till he bore a
  ridiculous likeness to a pouter pigeon. His head, too, swelled to an enormous
  size, till he was nothing else but the absurd caricature of a man. He was
  perfectly conscious of all that was taking place around him, but speech was
  impossible, as mouth, eyes, and nostrils appeared to fill and glaze over as
  if he had been absolutely varnished.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a queer use to put a man to," O'Brady remarked, as he regarded
  his employer with absolute petrifaction. "And to think that he's alive,
  too."</p>

  <p>But the others were too astonished to listen to Larry's comments. With a
  peculiar stiff, rigid motion, Armstrong moved towards the side of the raft,
  where he stood until Barrados and O'Brady fixed a rope under his arms and
  gradually dropped him into the water, whilst Harold took the marine telescope
  with a view to watch the result and signal to the others in case anything
  happened. But apparently Armstrong's calculations were surely based. He
  reached the bottom safely enough, and by the aid of the wonderful glasses
  Harold was enabled to clearly see every motion of the man below.</p>

  <p><a id="pic003" name="pic003"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-03.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Without breathing, and without being conscious of either heart or lungs,
  Armstrong alighted on his feet and proceeded to walk along the ocean's bed,
  his large iron-shod boots keeping him from rising. For nearly an hour he
  remained there without experiencing any inconvenience beyond a tremendous
  rushing sound in his ears and a peculiar tingling sensation in his
  extremities. He was perfectly conscious in a vague, dreamy way, as of a man
  who had partaken of too much alcohol, and yet not enough to steal away his
  faculties. He felt now that the desired consummation had been achieved, and
  that he had discovered something hitherto unknown&#8212;a means by which
  divers could reach ground in the deepest parts of the Atlantic ocean.</p>

  <p>Barrados and Harold watched the experiment with the most breathless
  interest. They saw their fellow adventurer creeping about the ocean's bed as
  freely and conveniently as if he had been on dry land; they saw him examine
  different varieties of marine plants and shells with ease and freedom, He
  seemed to have quite forgotten those waiting for him above, till presently he
  gave a tug at the rope and was hauled on board the raft again.</p>

  <p>Directly Harold removed the India-rubber tube from the diver's throat
  there was a marvellous transformation. The figure assumed its normal
  proportions, the face lost its glazed look, and Armstrong was himself
  again.</p>

  <p>"It's a good thing your mother couldn't see you just now, for, by the
  powers, she wouldn't have known you," O'Brady exclaimed. "And what were they
  after saying to you down below there, Captain?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing that could interest you," Armstrong laughed. "Still, my friends, I
  think I have proved to you that I have solved the problem as to how a man can
  live as well in water as on land. But there is a great difficulty still."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Coventry and Barrados asked in a breath.</p>

  <p>"Why, how to reach bottom in three hundred fathoms of water, It is absurd
  to think of going down eighteen hundred feet and returning with a vehicle so
  primitive as a long rope. My plan is to try a kind of torpedo propelled by a
  screw worked by electricity, returning to the surface in the same iron shell
  by exhausting the air down below and floating to the surface. I propose to
  send this submarine boat up and down a stout wire strand running from the
  bottom to a place on the raft so as to procure the necessaries we require
  when below. I shall also establish, between the two points, a telegraphic
  apparatus."</p>

  <p>"But why a telegraphic apparatus?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"Because one can't speak under water, stupid," Armstrong replied with some
  little asperity, "and this is why I made you both learn the signs. By this
  means we shall be able to communicate directly with the surface, then one of
  you will remain whilst the other two are down below clearing the island of
  rocks, preparatory to floating it. There is no reason why we should not work
  for several hours at a stretch, as the work is light enough. And now just to
  give you confidence, I want you two to try what I have just been through.
  There is not the smallest possible danger."</p>

  <p>For a few minutes Harold and Barrados regarded each other dubiously. But
  sooner or later the thing had to be done, and within half an hour both of
  them had spent at least ten minutes each enjoying the novel sensation of
  walking along the bed of the ocean, with at least thirty feet of water above
  them.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's over, at any rate," Armstrong remarked, as they draw up the
  anchor of the raft and made their way back to the mainland. "I think after
  all that Larry ought to have had a lesson in case of accident."</p>

  <p>"I never was of a curious disposition," Larry said, with a grin, "and the
  earth I was born upon is quite good enough for the likes of common people
  like me."</p>

  <p>But Armstrong was already deeply immersed in his calculations. He began to
  see his way clearly now to a feasible method of descending to the island, and
  not only that, but of working there for several hours a day without the least
  discomfort. All he had to do now was to test the submarine boat, and if this
  could be successfully accomplished by means of a powerful electric screw, the
  rest of the descent would be easy.</p>

  <p>Although the afternoon was by no means spent when they returned to the
  tents and indulged in a hearty lunch, they found that Don Zalva and Haidee
  had ridden down to see how operations were progressing. The former, a tall,
  handsome man of courtly bearing, listened with marked interest to Armstrong's
  narrative, whilst Harold and Barrados approached the olive-cheeked beauty
  with the dark eyes and melting lips, who reclined under the shelter of a
  friendly palm out of the rays of the brilliant sunshine.</p>

  <p>"We came to see you," she said, in the soft, seductive Spanish language,
  that sounded so charmingly from her ruby lips, Harold thought. "My father is
  deeply interested, and I confess to a little curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Not interest, then!" Harold laughed; "nothing on our account."</p>

  <p>A little, somewhat forcible, compliment escaped the lips of Barrados, at
  which Haidee flashed him a look of anger, and turned disdainfully away from
  him.</p>

  <p>She hates the cool, sulky, Spaniard, and though Barrados has discovered
  this, it only increased his admiration for Haidee the more.</p>

  <p>"I mistrust that man," she said, as Barrados slunk away with a smile on
  his lips and a feeling of malignant rage in his heart; "and, if I mistake
  not, he hates you, Signor Harold. Have a care of him."</p>

  <p>"Barrados is all right," Harold laughed; "it is only his peculiar
  way."</p>

  <p>Haidee bent her dark eyes on Harold's face with a glance of peculiar
  significance.</p>

  <p>"Never trust a Spaniard," she said, slowly. "I tell you that man hates
  you, and when the proper time comes I will prove my words."</p>

  <p>The speaker rose from her seat, and declining Harold's assistance, walked
  across to the shed where Armstrong was describing his submarine boat to Don
  Zalva. He had not been idle during the last few days, and Harold looked on
  just as curiously, for he saw that nearly the whole floor was occupied by a
  huge conical machine, in shape something like a sharp-pointed egg. The affair
  was constructed of light boiler-plate material, being fitted with a rudder
  and screw, which appeared to be reversible. The entrance merely consisted of
  a small manhole which, being closed, rendered it quite watertight, especially
  as there was an inner chamber, which no water could possibly penetrate, as
  the doors could never by any chance be left open at the same time.</p>

  <p>"You see, I have everything we require here," Armstrong explained. "We
  shall sink the construction for the first time by its own weight, as it is so
  constructed with a due regard for gravity, as to be only slightly heavier
  than water when the outer chamber is allowed to fill. I can guide it to on
  point we want, before we reach bottom, by the screw and rudder. Once bottom
  is touched, it is, of course, useless till we come to the surface again. When
  we want to rise, we get inside the first chamber, close the door, and by
  means of a vacuum pump, eject the water, although there is no occasion to do
  this when once the steel cable has been firmly laid. You follow me?"</p>

  <p>"To a certain extent," Don Zalva replied. "You propose to attach this
  machine to the steel strand, and haul it up and down at will."</p>

  <p>"Precisely, that is the way I shall always get my boat, as I call this
  thing, for want of a better name, to the same place. It will merely be used
  for our transmission up and down&#8212; once below we shall depend upon the
  <i>scienatic</i> acid tubes alone. We calculate to be able, by their means,
  to remain below for upwards of five hours at a time, and thus, by means of my
  dolamyte cartridges&#8212; which I shall take down in large quantities, as
  they are perfectly impervious to the water&#8212; we shall be able to displace
  the rocks, by which the island is held down, in ten days. By scientific
  calculations, I find that the amount of lava-rock&#8212; resting
  upon what was once known at Santa Anna, must be about three millions of
  tons."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but if your explosive is as powerful as you represent it to be, you
  may only succeed in destroying the island entirely," Don Zalva observed.</p>

  <p>"I have found a means to guard against that," Armstrong replied calmly.
  "The great peculiarity about the dolamyte is that it strikes horizontally
  only, and I can so regulate its strength that the explosion can strike up or
  down five, ten, or twenty feet at will, according to the strength. Now, coral
  formation is workable at a pressure of 12.005 to the square inch, therefore
  the amount of rock at present lying on the island I find, basing everything
  on that calculation, to be about nine to ten feet. If I succeed in blasting
  away four or, say, five feet, of this&#8212;and my explosive absolutely
  destroys all it touches&#8212;the island will float."</p>

  <p>"With so powerful an explosive, wouldn't it be rather dangerous for us
  down there?" Harold asked dubiously. "I mean, if we happened&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Armstrong interrupted. "You remember how every
  cartridge is fitted with a propelling screw, and that we could be a mile
  away, if necessary, which it is nothing of that sort, as the resisting power
  of water is enormous. A discharge of this on land would be awful, in the
  water you could be within twenty yards and not know that anything had taken
  place. And now, help me to get the machine up to the pontoon; I want to try
  its effect."</p>

  <p>Monstrous as the thing looked, it was light enough, and presently it stood
  on the raft at the end of the pontoon, just over the submerged island. As if
  inspired by a sudden thought, Armstrong took two of the <i>scienatic</i> acid
  tubes, of which he had an enormous coil, and, fixing them to the retort and
  metal cups, pulled the end out of each coil&#8212;each one hundreds of feet
  in length&#8212;and bade Harold place it on his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Let us tug now for an hour," he said; "Barrados can look after the
  retorts."</p>

  <p>Haidee's lovely face turned a little pale, but she said nothing as
  Armstrong and Harold, after distending themselves, entered the boat, first
  attaching the ends of their <i>scienatic</i> tubes to the top of the
  queer-looking monster, so that they might resume them on reaching the bottom
  of the ocean. Armstrong thrust Harold inside, and making a sign for the craft
  to be pushed into the water, entered himself and closed the manhole. A moment
  later the boat sank, and the watchers with the telescopes could see it
  gradually falling, till at length it reached the bottom. They saw the
  voyagers emerge and resume the end of their <i>scienatic</i> tubes and move
  steadily forward.</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful," Haidee exclaimed, heedless of the scowl on the face of
  Barrados. "I hope they are quite safe&#8212;but look," she ended in a scream,
  "look at the sharks; there must be at least five hundred of the monsters. Oh!
  they are lost, indeed."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the dense darkness of the tube, illuminated only by a
  glazed porthole by means of which Armstrong directed operations, the
  adventurers fell rapidly. The screw, worked by electrical apparatus, groaned
  and creaked in the water, leaving long streak of starry, silvery bubbles
  behind. It seemed to grow still blacker and darker till Armstrong was unable
  to direct the movements of the aquatic vehicle. They appeared to be passing
  through a sea of ink, an opaque gloom of which the watchers alone were
  ignorant. With his fingers, Armstrong made signs to Harold. Indeed, the deaf
  and dumb code alone was possible, since speech was practically out of the
  question.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the gloom passed away as if they had shot out of a tunnel into
  broad sunshine, or as if water lay in dense or porous strata. A light, soft
  but brilliant, poured through the porthole like a shaded electric light.
  Everything was clear and luminous at that great depth, and when finally the
  boat reached bottom, and the occupants stepped out upon the lava rock with
  which the island appeared to be covered, and resumed their <i>scienatic</i>
  tubes, it seemed to their eyes that they were situated in a locality where
  there was not only no water, but the air was in a marvellously rarefied
  condition. From the island, which stood considerably higher than the
  surrounding plain of sand, mud and dense marine foliage, they appeared to be
  able to see for miles around, and for some few moments they stood
  contemplating the scene with rapt interest.</p>

  <p>There was no exaggerating its rareness, since they were placed as no
  mortal had ever been situated before. Around them were wonders calculated to
  excite the mind and stimulate the curiosity for all time. In the water, which
  did not look or feel like water at all, but like liquid sunshine, or, rather,
  a bath of air, fishes were apparently swimming, not in water, but floating,
  in defiance of all laws or gravity, in water. Uncouth monsters sailed by
  them, gigantic soles, larger than an ordinary dining-table, and things like
  shrimps that seemed to stand up to Harold's shoulder. Under feet were oysters
  of a size never dreamt of by mortal man, huge bivalves, some closed and some
  open and all of them containing immense pearls, as the adventurers could see
  as the light flashed upon them. But it would be a bold hand that would
  venture to stray within one of these mail-like shells. Harold, with some
  difficulty, rolled into one a huge rocky fragment, and immediately the
  bivalve closed with a force and impetus that crushed the mass of stone, as a
  Nasmyth hammer pulverises a hazel nut.</p>

  <p>In front of the voyagers lay a long, level, sandy plain, apparently
  stretching away to what, on <i>terra-firma</i>, would be called the horizon,
  and here fish of every kind and description that ever were worked out of the
  grotesque brains of a pantomimist, sported and gambolled. There were eels of
  extraordinary length, a beautiful silvery fish marked with dark bars and red
  spots, like a salmon, another extraordinary-looking creature, apparently all
  head and mouth. Everything appeared to be on a gigantic sale; nothing was
  small or undersized.</p>

  <p>From where the voyagers stood they could distinctly see the formation of
  the island, which may be briefly described as in the shape of a lobster's
  claw, with what at one time, when the island floated, must have been a
  land-locked bay.</p>

  <p>"This must be the 'point' to which a allusion was made in the cypher,"
  Armstrong signalled to his companion. "The formation is clear enough; but
  before we venture any further I must protect you as I have done myself. Take
  a good number of these <i>dolomite</i> cartridges. We are certain to
  encounter presently a marine monster or two who will not be so friendly as
  those below."</p>

  <p>Harold took the explosives and placed them in a canvas bag he had slung
  over his shoulders before starting. There was something at the moment that
  attracted him more than the survey of the island or the prospect of stumbling
  on to some clue to the hidden treasure. To the left lay a gigantic mass of
  foliage far higher than the tallest trees known to man, and what appeared to
  be nothing less than a massive forest. The trees, if they may be so termed,
  were close together, but neither so close nor the undergrowth so thick that a
  passage into the forest was impossible.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see a little more of that," Harold signalled. "We are
  not down here on any particular business, and my curiosity is aroused."</p>

  <p>"I do not see any objection," Armstrong replied. "Let us try it. Our tubes
  are sufficiently long to permit us to go any distance in reason."</p>

  <p>They moved forward as quickly as the resistance of the water would permit.
  As they reached the level plain below, Armstrong stopped and pointed to a
  huge school of fish, which apparently came out of space, and which were
  unmistakably advancing towards them. As they came closer, Harold's heart sank
  as he recognised them for sharks of the most terrible description.</p>

  <p>They were indeed formidable-looking monsters, twelve or fourteen of them
  in all, and not one amongst the number being less than forty feet in length
  or less than twelve in diameter. Their powerful jaws opened to disclose row
  upon row of horrible looking hooked teeth, and as they approached the rest of
  the finny tribe scuttled away in terror.</p>

  <p>"Keep cool for your life," Armstrong said as he hurriedly took out two of
  the <i>dolomite</i> cartridges, "we have evidently attracted the attention of
  these cruel monsters, who do not quite know what to make of us yet. Wait till
  one of them makes a rush and then discharge the cartridge at him
  point-blank."</p>

  <p>Apparently the sharks, as if endowed with sense like human beings,
  hesitated and gathered together to formulate some scheme of attack upon their
  strange and novel foes. One or two of the bolder ones sailed near them
  and flashed their dull grey sides as if in the act of turning before making a
  grab with their powerful jaws. Then one, bolder than the rest, dashed from
  the group, poised on quivering fins and, like an arrow shot from the bow,
  made straight for the cool and intrepid Armstrong.</p>

  <p>Not until he had reached within fifteen yards of the victim did Armstrong
  release, with a spin from his fingers, the pretty mechanical little toy,
  which Harold saw screwing its way through the water with a rapid dating
  motion as if a minnow had advanced to meet a whale. There was an anxious
  pause for a second, then as the tiny dart and the leviathan met, the latter
  seemed like a flash, to stand still, tremble, and utterly disappear. There
  was a little tinge of brown in the water as if a puff of submarine smoke had
  been wafted from somewhere, and all was over. A second shark, advancing
  towards Harold, met the same fate. Then, emboldened by their success, the
  voyagers moved forward and discharged a dozen cartridges in quick succession
  into the school of sharks, now standing suspiciously off, with such success
  that only three of the original number remained. These, warned by some
  peculiar instinct of the deadly superiority of their foes, pointed away
  towards the north, and in a few moments had disappeared from sight so quickly
  that it might have been all a dream.</p>

  <p>"I think we are well out of that," said Harold. "We should have been in a
  nice position had you not hit upon the happy idea of those cartridges."</p>

  <p>"I should not have dreamt of coming without some such protection,"
  Armstrong replied, as they moved along towards the marine forest. "We know no
  more about the inhabitants of the deep seas than we know concerning the
  virgin depths of some of the African and Brazilian forests. Who would venture
  into the heart of an unknown country unarmed, and what right have we to
  assume that the seas contain no fish more dangerous than sharks because we
  have not chanced to meet them? I tell you the Brazilian virgin forest
  contains animal forms that man has never seen. I have listened on the skirts
  of the roads there to sounds from the throats of creatures to which we cannot
  give a name, and so it is with the deep seas, and we have to-day looked upon
  creatures such as you never dreamt of. And if I mistake not, in yonder forest
  we shall see forms more curious still."</p>

  <p>They passed under the curious heavy foliage at length, then paused for a
  moment to contemplate its wondrous beauty. The trees were large and stately,
  floating and twisting as if stirred by some unfelt breeze, and though the
  trunks of these marvellous plants were of immense diameter, they did not
  stand erect like earthly plants; but it was apparent that the water sustained
  them. Indeed, the stems were soft and porous, and opaque like dark
  wine-coloured jelly. They had flowers of all kinds of brilliant hues, large
  striped parti-coloured blossoms, growing in large bunches out of masses of
  leaves, perfectly transparent and varied in hue, so as to utterly baffle
  description.</p>

  <p>The forest illusion was rendered still more perfect by a huge number of
  peculiar looking creatures that crept like squirrels amongst the branches, a
  creature with a head covered with fur like a rat and also with long
  talon-shaped claws, whilst the tail tapered off like that of a fish.</p>

  <p>"How wonderfully strange and beautiful!" Harold exclaimed, as he looked
  around him. "In my wildest dreams I never imagined this. But why do these
  very peculiar little creatures so suddenly seem to fall and disappear as if
  they had been abruptly deprived of life?"</p>

  <p>"Look there!" Armstrong cried, "Down for your life."</p>

  <p>As he spoke there arose, apparently from nowhere, a long tendril like a
  thin lasso, which, darting up some fifty or sixty feet, twisted round the
  neck of one of the first animals and brought it to the sand, dead and
  motionless. Then the lasso seemed to draw it along till lasso and victim
  disappeared behind a gigantic rock, a little further away.</p>

  <p>"Not a nice thing to have wound lovingly round one's neck," Harold said
  with a little shudder. "Nevertheless I must see what it means."</p>

  <p>"Best he careful," Armstrong advised, "goodness only knows what
  extraordinary creature is behind that rock. We had better make a wide
  detour."</p>

  <p>They shifted round cautiously until they rounded the rock, fully two
  hundred yards on the further side. Underneath a hollow shelf-like ledge they
  could see something moving with long feelers, one of which doubtless had been
  used for the purpose of catching the creature's prey. As the spectators
  hesitated to go forward, they heard a peculiar snapping sound, and the
  lurking monster, like a colossal spider, ran out of his hole a little way and
  stood in their full view on the sand. He seemed to be angry and alarmed, and
  to cautiously regard one of the fish-creatures that lay a few yards away from
  his serpentine feelers.</p>

  <p>The thing was nothing but a lobster. But what a lobster, with a body fully
  twenty feet in diameter, and three times the length, and with big claws,
  capable of closing round and crushing an ordinary horse! It had a great mouth
  fitted with teeth like those of a saw, and eyes large and round as moons
  glittering with rage and suspicious apprehension. It stood, arched like an
  angry cat, perched upon its smaller legs, if the huge, bony mailed extenders
  could be so called, and poised ready for a spring, keeping the round, angry
  eyes fixed on the prey a little distance of, whilst the claws snapped
  together, with a sound as great as a volley fired by a company of
  infantry.</p>

  <p>"I trust all that is not intended for us," Harold observed. "Fancy having
  your body ripped between such a pair of claws as those."</p>

  <p>"We are not the cause," Armstrong replied, "besides, we are armed. There
  is an enemy, and we shall probably see a fight."</p>

  <p>Almost before the signs were finished on Armstrong's fingers, from beneath
  another rock emerged the hitherto unseen antagonist, which proved to be a
  lobster similar in size to the first, and who ran forward in the same
  cat-like manner, and then paused, snapping his tremendous claws in his turn.
  It was a strange and interesting spectacle as the feelers were thrown on
  either claw, lashing each other like whips. Directly there was an attempt to
  remove the prey, the other would thrust out a feeler and drive him off, only
  to get the same treatment in his turn. With a quick move, considering their
  enormous size, the monsters came near to each other, roaring as they
  approached.</p>

  <p>With peculiar cries and a horrid din of rattling mail and clanging claws,
  the animals suddenly rushed upon each other and a moment later were rolling
  over one another, biting and snarling like two large dogs bent on a battle to
  the death. As claw met claw and mail clashed against mail, the sand and
  stones flew in all directions, and each thrust and parry was so rapid that
  the spectators could not follow anything like half the movements in the
  strange duel. For nearly an hour the combat proceeded till gradually the
  challenger seemed to weary and then turn tail with a view to escaping to his
  lair. The movement was fatal, however, as his antagonist immediately sprang
  upon his back and with the great powerful claw fairly crushed the head of his
  opponent, who suddenly drew out and lay perfectly still motionless and
  apparently dead upon the sand, whilst the victor ran nimbly to his
  hiding-place, apparently unhurt.</p>

  <p>"We can get some idea of what the creature is like, now," Harold said, as
  he moved towards the prostrate monster. "I should like to measure him."</p>

  <p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth before the lobster, not yet dead,
  shot out a claw and took him fairly round the waist with a pinch which, had
  not his body been fully charged with <i>scienatic</i> acid, would have meant
  instant death. It was a moment of deadly peril, as Armstrong instantly
  realised, for the mere pressure of the expiring monster was quite sufficient
  in time to crush the hardest substance, and from the expression of the
  fast-fading red eyes, it seemed to Armstrong that the lobster was still
  intent on vengeance. There was no alternative but to discharge one of the
  <i>dolomite</i> cartridges, and trust to Providence for Harold's safe
  delivery.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>A moment or two later Harold lay quiet and motionless on the sand, his
  captor having been blown into space. It was impossible to determine then
  whether the unfortunate man was dead or alive and it was with feelings of the
  liveliest anxiety that those above saw Armstrong half dragging, half carrying
  his companion to the boat, into which, with infinite difficulty, he presently
  got him, having first disconnected the <i>scienatic</i> acid tubes. Presently
  they saw the boat begin to rise to the surface, slowly at first, then more
  rapidly as the air was exhausted. Five minutes later the adventurers emerged,
  and Harold was lying on the raft, still as death, whilst Armstrong, with his
  ear on his breast, strove to catch any sign of motion of the heart.</p>
  <hr>
  <a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <p class="first">HAROLD'S injuries happily did not turn out to be very
  serious. The force of the grip and the violence which he had received when
  cast away by the monster in his dying agony had produced a slight attack of
  congestion of the brain, which, under the skilful treatment of a native
  doctor and Haidee's devoted nursing, rapidly improved. When he regained
  consciousness it was to find himself lying in a cool room in Don Zalva's
  <i>hacienda</i>, with Haidee in close attendance. There was only a little
  stiffness and fatigue, otherwise Harold felt quite himself again. But,
  despite his keen interest in the doings of his companions, he was not
  insensible to the charms of those dark eloquent orbs that looked into his
  with such flattering and tender interest.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are better, I see," Haidee murmured in her own liquid language,
  as she laid a cool hand upon his forehead. "How glad I am, Señor Harold."</p>

  <p>"I remember now," Harold replied gratefully, as he carried the little hand
  to his lips, a proceeding Haidee seemed to rather like than otherwise. "I was
  attacked by a monster. But what happened afterwards I do not know."</p>

  <p>Haidee briefly described all that had taken place, how Armstrong had
  succeeded in rigging up his steel cable, and how sufficient rocks had been
  removed from the island by the aid of <i>dolomite</i> without running the
  risk of destroying the treasure along with some portion of the original
  fabric.</p>

  <p>"But you must promise me to take no further part in the undertaking."
  Haidee concluded, with a pleading glance. "I was horribly frightened before,
  and I do not want anything to happen to you."</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the tender inflexion of the last word, and Harold
  felt the hand in his tremble as she spoke. It was not the first time that
  those dark eyes had stirred his pulses, and more than once had he caught
  himself weaving rosy dreams with the brilliant Mexican beauty as the central
  figure. His heart beat warmly for her now, and the love which had been
  growing in his heart found its way to his lips.</p>

  <p>"Would you really care," he whispered, "if I had been killed?"</p>

  <p>A bright blush dyed Haidee's cheeks; her eyes grew very soft and luminous
  as he drew her down to him and looked into her flower-like face.</p>

  <p>"I think you know I should," she murmured. "Ah, Señor, we women of the
  South are poor hands at hiding our feelings, so different to your colder
  beauties. I&#8212;I think if you had died my heart would have been broken.
  Oh, will you not promise me not to go into such terrible danger again?"</p>

  <p>"I will be more cautious, little one, but I cannot desert my companions,"
  Harold replied as he drew her down and kissed the olive cheek. "I must find
  this treasure, and then I shall want to share it with a dearer treasure
  still."</p>

  <p>Haidee knew what he meant and asked no further questions. As the bright
  days flew swiftly on, and Harold grew strong again, they lingered in the
  shade of the balcony and taught one another the old, old story which is the
  same for all time and in every language. As she lay on his breast with his
  arms around her, or, with the force of tropical passion, kissed him as if her
  love were almost pain, they talked of the future, molested and suspected by
  none, says Barrados, who watched and spied as only a Spaniard can do. He
  cursed Harold's success, Haidee's contempt filled him with bitterness, for he
  loved her too, and swore to be avenged when the time and opportunity were
  ripe.</p>

  <p>"Beware of him," Haidee said again and again. "Whenever you go down below
  the sea again, I shall be present to see that he does not play you false. I
  can manage the apparatus now as well as any one, and with that faithful
  O'Brady on my side will see that he does you no harm."</p>

  <p>"He will not in any case," Harold said cosily. "He has too much at
  stake."</p>

  <p>But this loving dalliance, pleasant as it was, did not suit Armstrong, who
  peremptorily cut it short by demanding to know when Harold intended to resume
  work again. They were very short handed, he explained as he came up to the
  <i>hacienda</i> one morning, and, besides, the time had arrived when a
  serious attempt to raise the island must be made.</p>

  <p>"I am ready now," Harold replied, regardless of Haidee's entreating looks.
  "I had no idea that there was any hurry. Tell me what you have done."</p>

  <p>Armstrong related everything as they walked down to the shore, accompanied
  by Haidee and Don Zalva, who, hearing that a great experiment was about to be
  tried, decided to join in watching the operations.</p>

  <p>"I have taken as much of the lava rock from the island as I dare,"
  Armstrong said; "if we go any deeper we might destroy the tectonic, which may
  be hidden on a high point of the original circle for all I know to the
  contrary. According to my calculations, the island ought to float now, and I
  cannot think why it does not, unless it has become attached to the native
  soil and been to a certain extent embedded in. The sand has been cleared away
  from round the edges and the short coral formation exposed; in fact, it is
  like a great hollow inverted tooth in a sound gum. I propose to crawl below
  it and insert sufficient <i>dolomite</i> underneath, and thus give the
  necessary shock to raise it."</p>

  <p>"You think that that would have the desired effect?" Harold asked.
  "Perhaps, on the other hand, it may blow the coral all to pieces."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, because, as I told you before, the <i>dolomite</i> only
  strikes out in a horizontal direction, so that I shall, as it were, merely
  break off the fangs. Once that is done the island will float to a
  certainty."</p>

  <p>Apparently much had been done during Harold's absence. By using one of the
  marine telescopes he saw that the island had been nearly cleared of stone,
  and only a few feet remained where the native coral cropped out here and
  there, and the shape of the island was as sharply defined as if it had been
  engraved on a map. Fortunately for the search party Don Zalva had succeeded
  in unearthing an ancient chart of Mea Culpa, Santa Anna, and in fact all the
  small islands dotted about, showing the exact names of every bay and gulf,
  even down to the most minute detail.</p>

  <p>"This helps us greatly," Armstrong observed, as he displayed the chart for
  the benefit of Harold, who had not seen it before. "On the cypher, you
  remember, is a figure thus&#8212; [image of skull and right-pointing
  arrow]</p>

  <p>"which is calculated to baffle anyone, but on the old plan you have in
  your hand you will see that the inland is shaped like a lobster's claw, with
  an almost landlocked bay between. The tips of these claws are severally
  called on the chart Three Star and Shule Points respectively. Look at the
  cypher and see how this helps us to read the first line."</p>

  <p>"It seems feasible," Harold said, after a little time. "I can make it out
  to read: 'From ye Three Star Point take a&#8212;' Oh yes, that would be a
  boat, I suppose. 'Take a boat to Shule Point,' which means across from one
  point to another. The rest is all Greek at present."</p>

  <p>"But do not forget that with the telescope we can distinctly see a coral
  rock on Three Star Point, where three deep stars have been engraved,"
  Barrados exclaimed with intense eagerness. His eyes were flashing, his face
  was quivering with greed and avarice, so that Haidee turned away in disgust.
  "Once the inland is floated we could soon trace out the rest of the cypher.
  Why should we make any further delay in the matter?"</p>

  <p>Eager as they all were now for the experiment to take place, the afternoon
  was wearing or before everything was ready for the descent. The submarine
  ship was equipped with everything necessary, including nearly an ounce of
  <i>dolomite</i>, that being a sufficient quantity on land, according to
  Armstrong's estimate, to destroy a city, though barely enough under water to
  dislodge the fangs by which the island was attached to the bottom. The
  voyagers were also equipped with everything they needed. This being done,
  Armstrong gave his final instruction.</p>

  <p>"Coventry, you know how to work the <i>scienatic</i> tube," he said, "and
  if you forget anything, Larry is to be trusted. You will watch with the
  telescope and you will easily know when the mine is fired, which I shall do
  by attaching to the electric machine I have at the base of the steel strand,
  the large <i>dolomite</i> cartridge. I shall then place it directly under the
  island, and when I touch the battery below, the explosion will slice off the
  island as a knife cuts a carrot. Barrados, are you ready?"</p>

  <p>"I?" Barrados asked, white as ashes. "Do you really propose to take
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do, man, as Coventry is hardly fit, and Larry is out of the
  question."</p>

  <p>"The saints be praised!" Larry ejaculated fervently. "It isn't often that
  I don't resent any reflections on my duty, but I forgive you this time,
  Captain dear."</p>

  <p>Armstrong turned angrily on Barrados, who looked down doggedly as he saw
  the glance of contempt by which he was favoured on all sides. But despite the
  scorn with which they treated him, he remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible," he faltered; "I cannot, I will not go with you."</p>

  <p>Armstrong was not the man to waste time in unnecessary argument. He turned
  to Harold, who nodded his head, despite an exclamation from Haidee, which was
  not lost on Barrados, whose heart was berating with mortification.</p>

  <p>"I must go," Harold said, speaking more to Haidee, than the rest. "There
  will be no danger like there was before, and this will be for the last time.
  Larry, help me on with my canvas suit, and see nothing is forgotten."</p>

  <p>With a muttered curse on the cowardice of Barrados, Larry obeyed, whilst
  Haidee looked on with white face and clasped hands. She was afraid; some
  instinct told her that something was about to happen, and once the island
  floated she knew then those below would be entirely at the mercy of the
  Spaniard.</p>

  <p>But she knew exactly how to act. O'Brady, who would do anything for her,
  was present also, and she determined to stay and see that no outrage was
  perpetrated upon Armstrong and the man she loved.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing further to wait for," Armstrong said curtly, as he saw
  that everything was ready. "Lower the tube away there."</p>

  <p>The voyagers entered, and were speedily running downwards, guided this
  time by the steel strand than ran through a loop in the top. The watchers
  with the telescopes saw them descend, then as Haidee turned round uneasily,
  she noticed that none of the distilled <i>scienatic</i> acid was falling into
  the metal cup. She indicated the fact to Larry, who replenished the retort,
  which he declared had been full a few moments before. Haidee turned to
  Barrados who affected to be watching the voyagers with the deepest
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Don't try it again," she said between her white little teeth. "It is too
  dangerous."</p>

  <p>"I do not understand," Barrados returned, with an evil smile. "If I were
  to&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"You understand me, and I understand you, Señor. You may be sure of that.
  It is dangerous for those who are below, as I know very well. It will be
  still more dangerous for you if such a thing is repeated. There are a dozen
  men on the island who would shoot you like a dog if I only gave the word, and
  not ask a question first. Beware how you anger me."</p>

  <p>Barrados turned away with some muttered apology, his heart more revengeful
  against Coventry than ever. And meanwhile the adventurous pair reached the
  ground in safety, and taking their materials, which included the wire from
  the electric battery, which had been moved for that purpose, advanced across
  the sands to where the island stood out, to use Armstrong's expression, like
  a gigantic hollow tooth inserted in a sound gum.</p>

  <p>They could literally see beneath it in places where the coral formed
  caverns, some of them forty feet high, and having branch passages leading
  everywhere. In these gloomy caves, Armstrong and his companion could see
  several giant shadows moving, and occasionally the ugly snout of a shark
  obtruded, only to be greeted with one of the deadly cartridges, before which
  it fell like midges before a modern cannon. So far as they could see, the
  hollow dome of the island was one large cave, connected by wide irregular
  passages, into which neither of them cared to venture.</p>

  <p>"This is a difficulty I did not foresee," Armstrong signalled. "To sever
  every fang, we must lay the cartridge somewhere near the centre, and to do
  that one of us must carry it there, which means quite half-a-mile walk and
  back again. It would be a nice thing to run up against one of those lobster
  gentlemen at such close quarters. I am not afraid of anything in the
  open."</p>

  <p>It was an awkward situation, and one out of which there was apparently no
  possible escape except to run the risk of contact with some hidden monster.
  Finally they decided to enter side by side, and at every few yards discharge,
  to the right and left and in front, some of the <i>dolomite</i> cartridges,
  of which they had a great number. This precaution was apparently needed, for
  as they advanced there escaped out into the open such a number of erratic
  monsters as the mind of man never conceived. There were lobsters only a
  little less in size than the one that had been so nearly fatal to Coventry,
  water-snakes, and, more curious than all the rest, a species of alligator,
  without scales, like a gigantic newt, of which seemed to scent the approach
  of some unseen danger.</p>

  <p>At the end of a quarter of an hour they had penetrated as far as Armstrong
  deemed it advisable to go, and, laying the cartridge on a level plateau of
  rock, with the electric wire attached, crawled back till they stood in the
  soft level light of open ocean again.</p>

  <p>"Well out of that!" Harold exclaimed. "I am not a nervous man, but after
  the other day I like to know where I am going and where the danger comes
  from. Did you ever see such an extraordinary-looking lot of creatures in your
  life?"</p>

  <p>Harold pointed to the marine curiosities now slinking back one by one to
  their lairs. But Armstrong was far too interested in the electric battery to
  pay any attention to the strange shapes he saw around him.</p>

  <p>"I am going to fire the mine," he said. "If you will watch it carefully
  you will see a sight such as you have never seen in your life before, curious
  as these things appear to be. Now note the effect of the shot."</p>

  <p>Armstrong pressed his finger on the button, and then, as if by magic, the
  island seemed to rock and tremble, and finally, after a convulsive movement,
  rose slowly and with a majestic motion upwards till it floated like a cloud
  into the inky strata of water above the voyagers' heads.</p>

  <p>"Look!" Armstrong cried, as he caught Harold's arm, and attempted to drag
  him back. "What have we done? Heaven help us, we are lost!"</p>

  <p>A brilliant light, small at first, but then increasing in size, rose from
  under their very feet, till they were nearly blind. As if impelled by some
  tremendous power, they were literally forced towards the light, and as they
  reached it, still clinging to each other, they were whirled round and round
  with dizzy force. Then they fell headlong into space with millions and
  millions of tons of water dropping through a chasm in the floor as fluid
  bursts from a gigantic nozzle.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE island had floated, of that there could be no possible
  doubt. For a time the watchers above were too deeply engrossed in following
  this to notice the fate of Armstrong and Coventry. It seemed to them as if
  some Titanic monster of the deep had been freed from its cramping chains as
  the island swayed and tossed, each pitch throwing off the gigantic boulders
  that held down the coral, as one might raise one end of a board covered with
  stones and slide them off. Then the huge mass began to rise to the
  surface.</p>

  <p><a id="pic007" name="pic007"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-07.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Back to the land for your lives!" Barrados shouted. "Should that mass
  rise and strike this platform it would smash it into a thousand pieces."</p>

  <p>Fortunately for the spectators the pressure of water upon the rising
  island was so tremendous that at first it came up slowly, and thus gave them
  ample time to rush along the pontoon and gain the land. Once there, they had
  not long to wait, as presently the enormous mass rose with a prodigious
  turmoil and lashing of waters. It seemed to strike the raft and pontoon and
  shiver it, as if it had been composed of paper. It was some time before the
  waves ceased to beat and lash and when finally the disturbance had subsided
  the spectators saw a huge bank of mud and ooze drifting slowly towards the
  shore, where eventually it grounded so close that at low tide there would be
  no necessity for a boat to connect it with the mainland.</p>

  <p>"But where are they?" Harold asked, inspired by a sudden fear. "That mass
  appears to me to lie over the very spot where they ought to come up. Oh, they
  are lost! See, the steel rope has broken!"</p>

  <p>It certainly had, as one end had been snapped, and the sudden tension had
  caused it to fly, as if it had been a piece of cotton carried on the breeze.
  Barrados, indifferent as he was to the fate of his companions, so long as
  the main object was achieved, regarded the speaker helplessly.</p>

  <p>"It could not matter much," he said. "In any case they have the tube to
  rise in, the steel strand only being used as a guide. There is no cause for
  uneasiness on the score of their safety."</p>

  <p>But Haidee was not to be convinced, Don Zalva and O'Brady sharing her
  apprehensions. Not until they had taken a raft and pushed off beyond the
  recovered island would she be satisfied, and even then she insisted upon
  accompanying the rest of the little company.</p>

  <p>With the deepest apprehension she took O'Brady's glasses, and, looking
  over the edge of the raft, peered down into the depths made clear by
  Armstrong's marvellous telescope. There was nothing to be seen there save the
  curious marine monsters, the waving forest, and the peculiar strange light
  upon the spot where the wonderfully recovered island had lain. Over the
  luminous light the waters seemed to toss and whirl like a funnel of white
  foam, until it became clear that the sea was pouring into a deep chasm,
  drawing everything within a certain radius into to vortex. Haidee and the
  others noted how fish and other marine monsters came into the influence of
  the tremendous streams, and how, once they were whirled round once or twice,
  they then apparently were drawn down into the centre of the earth.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand this awful mystery," Haidee said at length, as he
  laid down her glass with a sob. "It looks to me as if a gigantic pit had been
  unsealed, and as if all the waters were pouring into the centre of the
  earth."</p>

  <p>"And thus causing an enormous whirlpool," Don Zalva, much moved himself,
  replied. "There is no doubt now that our friends have been drawn into its
  influence and carried somewhere below. Even the tube has disappeared. We can
  hope; but as for the rest we must leave it to Providence."</p>

  <p>The speaker put up his glass with an air of genuine sorrow and emotion.
  Haidee, maddened and distressed, her heart bursting with grief, demanded that
  she might be put back to shore, and so they returned quiet and sorrowful,
  with the exception of Larry, whose grief was more violent.</p>

  <p>"And all this comes of trying to live where man has no business," he said,
  with the tears running down his furrowed cheeks. "Nature sent that island
  down there, and intended it to remain. And sure it's myself that would give
  that dirty strip of mud to see my master back again, and think I had the best
  of the bargain. Treasure! what's treasure to a man who dies before he lives
  to enjoy it?"</p>

  <p>But the party was too overcome with grief to notice Larry's curious form
  of logic, all except Barrados, who inwardly rejoiced to find himself bereft
  of a rival and the sole claimant to untold treasure at the same time. Now
  that. Coventry was no more, there was no reason why he should not prevail
  open Haidee to share his lot, especially as now there was every probability
  of his claim being backed up by the possession of unknown wealth. But had he
  known the contempt his conduct during the day had inspired in Haidee's mind,
  he would have felt less confidence in the ultimate result. He said nothing as
  Haidee and her father walked sorrowfully homeward, and Larry, with his face
  to the sea, was calling down objurgations upon the fatal and mysterious
  island.</p>

  <p>Afternoon changed to night, and night to morning, and no signs of the
  missing men appeared. Don Zalva came down to the shore personally to enquire,
  with the information that Haidee was too utterly prostrated by the calamity
  of the day previous to come down in person. After a little desultory
  conversation with Barrados, who was no favourite of his, he returned to his
  <i>hacienda</i>, leaving the Spaniard free to make what his impatient soul
  had been longing for&#8212;a full and thorough examination of the island.</p>

  <p>Larry was safely out of the way, having been sent up to the
  <i>hacienda</i> on some idle pretext, where Barrados knew he would remain so
  long as Haidee's pretty maid, Isidore, chose to retain him. The powerful sun
  of the past two days had dried up all the mud and ooze that remained upon the
  fateful island, which was not much, as it had been thoroughly washed during
  its rise on the previous day. The tide was at the half-ebb as Barrados strode
  down the sand, and, wading across the little strip of water, found himself at
  length upon the very place which had occupied his exciting dreams for some
  years past.</p>

  <p>There was no mistake as to the island being one of coral formation. All
  the soil had been washed away; all the lava boulders, with one or two
  exceptions, had also disappeared, and all that remained was the naked coral,
  embedded here and there with huge stones, round which the fabric had been
  constructed generations ago, when the world was young. Whatever the formation
  of the rocks might have been, they were part of the original fabric and
  entirely different from the lava slabs by which the island had been submerged
  when the eruption took place from the volcano on Caraba nearly three
  centuries before.</p>

  <p>Barrados gazed anxiously around him and a sense of elation filled him as
  he noted how small was the area he had to investigate. So far as he could
  guess, from a rough calculation, the island was some seven acres
  altogether&#8212;not much, it is true, but quite enough without some guide to
  go upon. In the centre the coral rose till it attained the height of some
  fifty feet or so, and on this Barrados climbed. From that reign of vantage,
  with a strong binocular, he examined every portion minutely, so that he
  might, if possible, find something upon which to work out his
  calculations.</p>

  <p>He took a copy of the cypher from his pocket and studied it intently for
  some moments. The first part was clear enough, and his heart gave a throb as,
  looking through his binocular, he noticed on the southern spur of the claw
  that formed the little partially-locked bay, the table-like rock on which
  were cut three star-shaped marks. What was on the other cape or claw, he
  could not see.</p>

  <p>"It seems right enough," he muttered, "from the Three Star Point in a
  boat&#8212;yes that must be a boat to Skull Point, which means crossing over
  to the opposite point, which on Don Zalva's old chart is called Skull Point.
  Let us see what is there."</p>

  <p>With these words Barrados descended and walked round to the northern horn.
  There he found, surrounded by a raised bed of coral, a number of flat stones,
  one of which bore the rude outline of a skull. His interest was still further
  excited as he noted that these flat stones had evidently been cemented in at
  some time, and three of them bore tolerably legible inscriptions.</p>

  <p>"They are tombstones," said Barrados triumphantly. "Then these
  half-circles on the cypher were intended to represent the resting-place of
  certain sailors."</p>

  <p>It seemed clear enough now, read in the light of this discovery. The
  searcher took the first tombstone upon which he could trace something. He
  passed the second, and then, coming to the third, with a thrill of exultation
  he read the following legend. The letters were rudely cut, and some of them
  had to be picked out with a knife before he could make out what was
  written:&#8212;</p>

  <p class="poem">"To ye Memory of<br>
  RICHD. VAUGHAN.<br>
  For twenty-two years ye faithful friend of<br>
  Amyas Coventry<br>
  By whom he was buried here."</p>

  <p>"And dig down under the third tombstone, which is Richard Vaughan,"
  Barrados muttered, as he read the cypher again. "Until I shall find a
  something I cannot understand and three skulls. So the scent is getting
  warmer. But to dig under that stone requires something more than the ordinary
  implements of husbandry&#8212;it will require to be blown up."</p>

  <p>The stone was closely embedded in the coral. The cement, which had groove
  hard as the original fabric, defied the steel knife-blade. There was nothing
  for it but to procure a drill, and with a charge of powder, blow the stone
  from its long resting place.</p>

  <p>Barrados looked cautiously around, but so far as he could see, no human
  being was in sight. Hurriedly he returned to the shore and, taking some
  powder, fuse, a steel drill, and a cord, returned to his exciting
  pastime.</p>

  <p>As he hastened towards the island, Larry looked round the corner of the
  workshed and, stepping quietly inside, proceeded to watch the movements of
  the Spaniard with an interest which was largely increased by the suspicion
  with which he regarded that individual.</p>

  <p>"If you had been an Englishman none of this would have happened," he said
  sorrowfully, as he shook his fist at the retreating figure. "I'll warrant you
  had a hand in this, you oily scoundrel. But so long as I'm here you don't
  walk off with all that treasure, Mr. Barrados, Esquire."</p>

  <p>Unconscious of the espionage, Barrados returned to his task. With the
  powerful glass, Larry could watch every movement. He saw the Spaniard ply the
  steel drill and presently ram the hole he had made with a charge of powder.
  He lighted his fuse and quickly shielded himself behind a ledge of coral.
  There was a puff and a sudden report, and the tombstone lying over all that
  remained of Richard Vaughan was shivered into a thousand pieces. With
  something more than curiosity, the Spaniard approached to see the result of
  his handiwork.</p>

  <p>Below lay a natural grave formed out of the coral bed. There was no
  coffin, since there was no occasion for anything of the kind. Within the
  narrow lid lay a perfect skeleton partially covered with clothes that had
  long since rotted away. There was a massive ring set with brilliants on the
  forefinger of the left hand, an earnest of something better to follow, that
  caused the Spaniard's eyes to gleam with rapacious greed. By the side of the
  skeleton lay a curious old mattock or spade, evidently the sign on the
  cypher, Barrados thought, and at the feet, neatly arranged, were three
  skulls.</p>

  <p>"Until there is reached a spade and three skulls," Barrados muttered as he
  freely translated the cypher. "In the second skull will be found a key. Well,
  everything appears to be perfectly correct so far. And now to sea if I can
  find the key to which allusion is made."</p>

  <p>The speaker raised the third skull, every movement being clearly visible
  to Larry, who followed it with breathless interest. Barrados drew therefrom a
  little packet strongly fastened with wax, and, replacing the skull again,
  opened the package, and there dropped into his hand a steel key, bright and
  clear as the day it had been turned out by the locksmith.</p>

  <p>"So far so good," Barrados murmured. "The rest does not seems no
  easy."</p>

  <p>It was simpler, however, than it appeared. It will be remembered that the
  cypher went on to describe the position of the treasure by the words:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Then get [image of three tombstones] in one straight line,
  and about a [image of pistol] beyond, over against [image of block of stone]
  will be found a [image of 4 stars], and here all the money of mine."</p>

  <p>The whole signed Amyas Coventry.</p>

  <p>As the drift of this became clear to the mind of Barrados, he proceeded to
  attach his cord, by means of a weight, to the first tombstone, and, getting
  all three in one straight line, drew the cord out taut, stepping backwards
  till he had paced off what appeared to him to be about a pistol-shot
  distance.</p>

  <p>Exactly upon that line, one way or another, he anticipated finding
  something in the nature of a mark containing four stars, and in this, after a
  little search, he was by no means disappointed. His back, as he walked
  backwards, came in contact with a ledge of rock placed vertically, like a
  step, over which the cord rose abruptly and, looking at the steep part of the
  step, Barrados saw the four stars.</p>

  <p>He examined it with fast-beating heart. Like the tombstones, the stone
  with the four-star legend appeared to have been cemented in, and as Barrados
  tapped it with his heel, it gave out a hollow sound. With a strength born of
  excitement he plied his drill and worked away at the stone till he had made a
  hole deep enough to take another charge of powder.</p>

  <p>He rammed home the charge and lighted his fuse, sheltering himself behind
  the same friendly ledge of rock, and waited for the charge to explode, with
  impatience that caused the time to seem like hours instead of minutes.</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the dull report died away before he ran to the spot to find
  that the charge had been completely successful. Not only was the stone
  shattered, but part of the coral ore was pulverised, disclosing a large oak
  crest, clamped and bound with iron, and which had apparently escaped the
  shock.</p>

  <p>"Now for it," Barrados muttered, with trembling hands and sweat-bedabbled
  face, as he applied the key to the lock. "Now to know my fate!"</p>

  <p>Larry, watering closely, saw Barrados rise a moment later and wave his
  hands round his head, dancing and gesticulating like a madman meanwhile. He
  saw him fall forward and plunge his hands into something.</p>

  <p>But O'Brady could not see one thing&#8212;he could not see the piles and
  piles of golden pieces, the priceless jewels, and the unique vessels of
  precious metals at which Barrados was gazing in dazed tremulous amazement.
  The secret treasure of Santa Anna had been found.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <p class="first">DOWN that tossing, rushing whirlpool, locked together in a
  convulsive grip, Armstrong and Coventry fell, dazed and battered, bruised and
  half senseless, until it seemed as if they were being carried down to another
  world. The warring currents hissed and roared in their ears; the tremendous
  force would have crushed them as a hammer smashes an eggshell had it not been
  for the <i>scienatic</i> acid with which their bodies were rendered
  impervious to any outside pressure.</p>

  <p><a id="pic006" name="pic006"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-06.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>So long as they kept falling it mattered little. What Armstrong, who still
  retained sense and reason, most feared was contact with some solid body, in
  which case escape was hopeless. As they continued to fall, still locked
  together, the condition of the water changed. The shaft of liquid crystal
  still retained its tunnel-like shape, but gradually became lighter and more
  diaphanous, until the luckless men could see through it as though they were
  being shot down an interminable hollow glass cylinder.</p>

  <p>Presently they appeared to arrive at the base of the cylinder, which
  spread out and seemed to strike upon another body of water with a tremendous
  roar and hissing spray, as if an immense cataract had fallen from the clouds,
  twenty Niagaras in one hurtling upon a plane of placid and motionless
  ocean.</p>

  <p>The rush and roar gradually faded away as the adventurers were carried
  down, down into the translucent depth by the enormous forces behind them,
  till presently they began to rise again, and finally reached the surface
  about gunshot distance from the round, shining pillar of water that appeared
  to fall out of space.</p>

  <p>They did not rise a moment too soon, as the <i>scienatic</i> acid, no
  longer replenished by the tube, had commenced to evaporate, and a desire to
  breathe again had made itself painfully apparent. Armstrong's face as he rose
  was quite purple, and a little stream of blood oozed from Coventry's
  nostrils. For a few moments red spots danced and flickered before their eyes,
  then gradually, as they lay on their backs beating the water for air, sense
  and feeling returned.</p>

  <p>They were saved. The <i>scienatic</i> acid had served them in good stead.
  Their bodies, almost petrified by the drug, had merely been shot down that
  awful shaft of water from one world into another ether, and they had come off
  quite unscathed, save that there was absolutely not a rag on either, and
  every hair, even to their eyebrows, had been taken away as clean as if they
  had been shaven. Nothing could better explain the force of the awful
  avalanche of water they had so recently experienced.</p>

  <p>Now that all danger for the present was passed they had an opportunity of
  taking in their surroundings. Atmosphere or sky overhead there appeared to be
  none, although the soft brilliant light pointed to a planet somewhere. On all
  sides, as far as the eye could see, there was nothing but clear crystal
  water, still and glassy except where the cataract was falling, and dotted at
  intervals by beautiful little domains floating on the water, each apparently
  anchored and divided off from its neighbour by aquatic lanes shaded by
  trees.</p>

  <p>Imagine a kind of modern Venice transferred to the suburb of some large
  town, and instead of paths and roads nothing but the purest water and some
  idea of the scene as witnessed by our adventurers will be presented.</p>

  <p>Each floating domain contained a house and garden perfectly square, round
  which trees were planted, hanging over the water's edge, so that each liquid
  thoroughfare was a grove or avenue of foliage. There seemed to be mile after
  mile of these residences, every one of which appeared to be composed of
  crystal, as they glittered and flashed in the brilliant but mellow light, the
  source of which seemed to be a mystery.</p>

  <p>"We are not dreaming, I suppose?" Harold remarked, as he dragged himself
  on to one of the floating platforms and flung himself amongst the flowers,
  which appeared to grow like grass everywhere, breathless and exhausted. "We
  are evidently still in the universe, and it seems to me that we have come
  upon inside our own."</p>

  <p>"So it would seem," Armstrong remarked coolly. "Indeed, from the way we
  were drawn in, it is certain that the earth is hollow, as the water found a
  vent somewhere. And, as I live, there is another of those water spouts!"</p>

  <p>Armstrong pointed to a second column of descending water, some mile or two
  away, and which was exactly similar to the one which had so nearly caused a
  fatal catastrophe, so far as they were concerned. Still further on in the
  distance another could be seen, which accounted for the fact that the world
  into which they had so suddenly been hurled was a watery one entirely.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what the size of this place is?" Armstrong went on. "From the
  time it took us to exhaust the <i>scienatic</i> acid, which was practically
  done by the time we rose to the surface again, we must have been falling for
  a steady hour. Allowing the fall to average five hundred feet a second, as it
  must have done, we in that time descended at the rate of over thirty thousand
  feet per minute, or say one million eight hundred thousand feet in the time.
  Six million yards is, roughly speaking, three hundred and forty miles, which
  takes some hundred miles off."</p>

  <p>"If you would devote your attention to discovering some method whereby we
  could obtain something to cover us, it would be better," Harold interrupted
  impatiently. "You are a very good fellow, Armstrong, but you and your
  calculations have brought us to a sorry pass. I should not mind if I were
  clad, though."</p>

  <p>"I was trying to work out a problem which occurred to me as to how we
  might return to our mundane sphere," Armstrong replied. "I almost had it in
  my grasp, when you interrupted me. Still, the clothes difficulty is a serious
  one, especially as I see some being coming this way."</p>

  <p>Out of the crystal house, upon the square floating garden where the
  adventurers were seated, there came a dazzling white figure that bore down
  towards them. At first he appeared to be dressed all in white, but as
  he&#8212;for it was a man&#8212;came nearer, they saw that despite the fact
  that his limbs were exactly similar in shape to their own, and though his
  face was handsome and refined, the body was clothed, with the exception of
  hands, face and feet, in a beautifully fitting garment of some white fur,
  thick and shiny as sealskin, and equally glossy. But the skin was not a
  dress. It was a natural growth. The man was a human seal.</p>

  <p>Without a particle of fear he approached the adventurers, and for some
  moments stood regarding them with the same curiosity they bestowed upon him.
  Bereft of his hairy coating, the denizen of the mysterious world presented no
  difference, save that he was fairer, and his face was beautifully soft and
  delicate, like a woman's; indeed, any society beauty would have envied such a
  complexion.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, and what brings you here?" the strange being asked in
  peculiarly odd tones, but in excellent English, to the astonishment of the
  listeners. "You are like us, and yet you are quite different to an
  Astran."</p>

  <p>"We speak the same language," Armstrong replied. "We are quite as
  astonished to see you as you are to see us, and we shall be happy to explain
  if you will find us something wherewith to hide our nakedness."</p>

  <p>"You are not similarly clad by nature to us, then?" the Astran asked.</p>

  <p>"Not covered with skins as you are," Harold put in. "We wear
  garments."</p>

  <p>The Astran shook his head, as if the phrase had no meaning for him, and
  then, bidding the adventurers wait till his return, came back at length
  carrying a quantity of soft drapery which Armstrong and Harold arranged about
  themselves as well as they could, fastening the same with some thread, which
  their involuntary host took the precaution to bring along.</p>

  <p>"Uncomfortable, but passable," Harold remarked, as he caught sight of his
  queer aspect and bald, shining head in the translucent water. "And now, sir,
  as we owe you a debt, we will tell you who we are and from whence we
  came."</p>

  <p>The Astran listened with profound attention and many exclamations of
  astonishment to Armstrong's wonderful narrative and his lucid but necessarily
  brief account of the upper world. Then he spoke in his turn.</p>

  <p><a id="pic008" name="pic008"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-08.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"You ask me who I am, and how I came to speak your language." he said. "I
  am Telba, the name which in borne by all my race, and this is the kingdom of
  Astra. Until today I, in common with my fellows, regarded regarded this as
  the one and only universe. How I came to speak your language I cannot tell,
  but it has always been our dialect since the world&#8212;our world&#8212;was
  created three hundred years ago by one Albert, our god and founder. That god
  was probably an adventurous Englishman who found his way here by some means
  we shall never discover. Our world is not a large one, being some eight
  thousand miles in diameter, and consists entirely of water, as you see here.
  Our residences are all floating ones. We borrow wood from those who can spare
  it from their trees as families are formed, and the rich mud from the bottom
  of the water soon becomes a beautiful garden when laid on the raft.</p>

  <p>"Our houses are formed of a clear, crystal-like formation which we can
  obtain from the waters, it being the product of a certain insect. We have no
  rulers, all are on a perfect equality; and as for food, all we require you
  see before you. Our water evaporates quickly, and chemical action, as our
  elderly friend here calls it, acts upon the liquid, and produces everywhere
  the soft brilliant light which illuminates our kingdom.</p>

  <p>"To make up for the evaporation, we have those huge cascades of water
  falling from where we cannot tell, except that it does come, and without it
  we should speedily be a muddy swamp. We do not eat as you speak of doing, but
  only drink the water, which is both in the nature of meat and drink to us.
  Therefore we do not require what you describe as fire. We have no means to
  cook, no clothes to wear, besides the soft white skins in which we were born.
  Consequently, every household requires nothing. No dust or dirt rises here,
  we have nothing to do but live our lives and enjoy them. No sickness troubles
  us&#8212;our happiness is complete. We are equally at home on land or water.
  We can pass our time above or stay in the crystal depths below at pleasure.
  Indeed, that is what we usually do in the daytime, which accounts for the
  quietness here."</p>

  <p>Telba, as he called himself, paused and emitted a low piercing whistle,
  and immediately afterwards there appeared from the pellucid waters a number
  of forms like himself, who quickly sprang upon the floating gardens, where
  they stood contemplating the strangers with lively curiosity. Directly they
  emerged from the water they became perfectly dry, as a seal or an otter does.
  They were of all ages and sexes, the women especially the younger ones, being
  without an exception singularly beautiful. Their features were regular,
  classic, and with the sweetest possible expression. Every face was fair, and
  every eye a beautiful deep blue, whilst their skins were like alabaster,
  touched on the cheeks with the most transparent pink hue.</p>

  <p>They did not crowd round with vulgar curiosity, but remained at a proper
  distance whilst Telba explained the singular narrative of the
  adventurers.</p>

  <p>"Henceforth, they are our guests," Telba concluded. "Go and spread the
  news far and wide, and wherever they go let them be well and duly
  treated."</p>

  <p>With many manifestations of friendship the beautiful creatures one by one
  plunged into the water again with graceful ease, and a few minutes later the
  adventurers were alone again with Telba.</p>

  <p>"You spoke just now of food," Harold remarked. "I pray you show me where
  it can be found, for I am hungry after my journey."</p>

  <p>By way of reply Telba made a cup out of the leaf of a pitcher-like plant,
  and, dipping it in the crystal tide, handed it to the speaker, at the same
  time bidding him drink freely of the contents. He did so, and found himself
  so immediately refreshed that he partook of another and another, till, after
  the third, he experienced the same sensations as a healthy hungry man does
  who has partaken of a good meal.</p>

  <p>"It is a singularly happy and ideal life," Armstrong remarked when he had
  followed a similar example. "And you appear to have everything ready to your
  hand. But to mortals like ourselves it would become tedious in the extreme
  after a time. You understand?"</p>

  <p>Telba inclined his head, as did Harold, who was thinking of Haidee's dark
  eyes and how she would take the news of his supposed death. He perfectly
  agreed with Armstrong, although politeness restrained him from saying so.</p>

  <p>"I understand your meaning and appreciate it," Telba replied. "You mean
  that you would like to return some time to your own world."</p>

  <p>"Precisely; and the sooner the better, as we have so much depending upon
  it. You say that you possess the power of living equally well on land as on
  water. Do you think it would be possible to convey that power to us?"</p>

  <p>Telba shook his head thoughtfully. It was only an art that had come from
  the constant practice of generations.</p>

  <p>"My idea is this," Armstrong went on, as he turned to Harold, "I want to
  get under that cataract of water again, as I have an idea that the base,
  falling as it does with a twisting motion like a corkscrew, is hollow. I
  believe that there is a large cone-shaped chamber there filled with air, into
  which it is quite possible to penetrate by diving deep and rising gradually
  to the surface. If I could once get there I should have hopes of returning to
  earth yet."</p>

  <p>"But how," Harold asked, "could you penetrate such a tube of water as
  that?"</p>

  <p>"By the outlet spray," Armstrong said boldly. "If it will penetrate
  downwards it will do the name upwards&#8212;indeed, more, as the gas rises
  upwards. That being done, I should have a hollow tube four hundred and fifty
  miles in length, up which we must contrive to make our escape to our proper
  sphere again."</p>

  <p>Harold laughed, utterly amazed at the stupendous audacity of the idea. The
  suggestion of two men attempting to climb a tube of polished steel&#8212;for
  the water would give an equal resistance&#8212;a perpendicular tube reaching
  a greater distance than from London to Edinburgh was absolutely
  ridiculous.</p>

  <p>"I am going to try it," Armstrong said, unmoved, "I can make a retort out
  of the crystal from which these dwellings are formed, and fire I can easily
  get. Once I have those things I can manufacture both <i>onthal</i> and
  <i>dolomite</i>, to say nothing of <i>scienatic</i> acid. If our friend here
  does not mind being our guide he can tow us down under the waterspout, and I
  can examine the air-chamber which I know exists in the centre."</p>

  <p>"And that we shall do by charging ourselves with <i>scienatic</i> acid?"
  Harold asked. "It will be a risky experiment, especially as the acid is so
  transient, and we have no means of keeping up the supply."</p>

  <p>Armstrong only smiled. To that wonderful man, difficulties were merely
  pastimes, little pleasures which cropped up only to be overcome by energy and
  determination.</p>

  <p>"Give me a day or two to turn it over," he replied, "and I will then tell
  you all my plans. I begin to see a way already. We shall return yet."</p>

  <p>Harold looked at the tremendous waterspout and smiled sarcastically.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">NEVER till that moment had Harold fully appreciated
  Armstrong's wonderful ingenuity and marvellous fertility of resource. With
  apparently no material of any kind at hand, he began to construct an
  extraordinary contrivance for reaching the upper world again and, when once
  the novelty of the situation had passed away, and the Astrans accepted their
  visitors as a matter of course, operations commenced in earnest.</p>

  <p>The Astrans, equally at home on land and water, and playing about in the
  depths below, were excited in discovering something that aroused their
  curiosity and which, when raised to the surface, turned out to be the iron
  tube, or submarine boat, which the adventurers had used to reach the
  submerged Santa Anna. It was bent and battered into a fantastic shape but
  Armstrong regarded the steel and iron framework with the eyes of a man who
  has discovered a treasure.</p>

  <p>"The very material I wanted," he explained to Harold. "Indeed had not we
  found that I do not know what I should have done. If we could only contrive
  to force that battered mass open, it contains powders and liquids which would
  simply be invaluable to me at the present time. There is in the inner
  chamber, as you know, the raw material for making <i>onthal</i>,
  <i>scienatic</i> acid, and <i>dolomite</i>. Once that is done I am saved
  weeks of weary toil."</p>

  <p>After many attempted they succeeded in removing the outer shell of the
  boat. Fire, a novelty for the Astrans, was used, and once the outer portion
  was removed, and Armstrong discovered his box of tools within, it was easy,
  to force a way into the inner chamber, which perfectly air-tight, and where
  numerous bottles and packages were discovered. They had now all that was
  required, metal and tools and the various powders used in manufacturing the
  several articles by which they had already accomplished so much.</p>

  <p>With minute toil and difficulty, Armstrong succeeded in forming a retort
  out of the crystal of which the Astran dwellings were constructed. It was
  easy enough to store away the <i>scienatic</i> acid in bottles of which they
  had plenty, so that, were an attempt made to penetrate the gigantic
  waterspout, by diving under its base and into the hollow air tunnel, which
  Armstrong's scientific knowledge told him existed, it would be possible to
  convey enough of the acid with them to replenish their bodies for the return
  journey.</p>

  <p>For short distances and those requiring speed, it would be quite
  sufficient to inhale the acid from a bottle direct, and one bottle would
  contain enough in a condensed form to last several hours. Of course when
  under the waterspout it would not be required.</p>

  <p>"But I do not see that this is going to help you," Harold remarked as he
  watched his adventurous partner distilling the powerful essences. "If you
  find an air-chamber in the centre of that immense cataract, where the water
  lies smooth and peaceful, as you say, I do not reckon much on that. The great
  question as to how we are to return to earth remains as yet unsolved."</p>

  <p>"It does now, but it will not do so long," Armstrong replied, calmly.
  "Remember what I did with a tiny spray of <i>onthal</i>. With it I pierced a
  hole two feet in diameter to the depth of eighteen hundred feet of water. The
  jet then was no larger than a pin-point, but you see the water was, as I may
  say, paralysed before it. Wherever that gas touches, it permeates. I firmly
  believe if I were to try a strong spray I could bore a hole in that fall of
  water from end to end, although, it is nearly five hundred miles in length.
  Pshaw! man, anything can be done by the man who thinks and tries. Look
  here!"</p>

  <p>So saying, Armstrong unrolled some hundred feet or two of India-rubber
  piping, which was fitted at the one end with a small tap and hose. Out of the
  battered boat he also took a large square of India-rubber cloth, which he
  fashioned into a big cloth, something like the silk hollow of a balloon.</p>

  <p>"I fill this with <i>onthal</i>," he went on, "or at least I fill it with
  <i>onthal</i> when I get to the centre of the waterspout, where I propose to
  erect a small platform if these good people will let me have wood enough. You
  shall see presently what means I am going to adopt to get this to play upon
  the water, and so make my funnel, up which we must climb to another
  world."</p>

  <p>"'Must' is easy enough, but 'how' is a great deal better," Harold replied.
  "I confess that you make me more curious than ever."</p>

  <p>"I dare say. You have seen an ordinary rocket thrown, say, two hundred
  feet in the air by means of some simple explosive like gunpowder. Now, with
  the aid of <i>dolomite</i>, I could construct rocket capable of raising us as
  high as fifty miles. That is fairly high, but nothing like enough, you may
  say. Suppose when the first rocket explosion has exhausted its force nearly,
  I can guarantee another explosion, and repeat this till I could guarantee a
  rise of as least a thousand miles; ay, if I could find the proper kind of
  metal, to the moon. But then we don't want to go to the moon; we don't even
  want to go more than half the thousand miles, which is my limit."</p>

  <p>Further, for the present, Armstrong refused to be drawn. Day by day he
  worked until everything was ready, and the time came when he deemed it
  necessary to attempt an exploration of the waterspout. He found Telba and
  many of his companions quite willing to guide them, as the spirit of
  adventure is strong upon us all. Such a thing had never been attempted before
  by any Astran, but this did not deter them from entering heartily into the
  spirit of Armstrong's enterprise.</p>

  <p>"The force of that water is tremendous," Telba observed; "but,
  nevertheless, it loses itself in the general sea, and many of us have
  frequently passed underneath one of these cataracts without any
  inconvenience, or, indeed, without any disturbance at all, although we have
  to swim under it at a considerably lowest depth. If, as you say, you have
  something that renders you indifferent to water for some length of time, I
  have no objection to being your guide, and my daughter Asteria shall perform
  the same office for our younger friend here."</p>

  <p>The beautiful maiden with the pure face and blue eyes, whom Armstrong and
  Harold knew as Asteria, the child of Telba, laughed and nodded. There could
  be no possible danger either, as Armstrong pointed out, because, if they
  found the water too turbulent it would be easy to dive again, and thus get
  out of unpleasant consequences.</p>

  <p>There would be no difficulty either, Telba informed him, in procuring
  enough wood to make a platform, provided that they succeeded in reaching the
  centre of the cataract, where Armstrong anticipated finding the quiet pool
  under the funnel of air.</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion for delay," Armstrong remarked. "Let us go at
  once."</p>

  <p>Telba and his daughter making no objection to the proposed arrangement,
  Armstrong proceeded to attach to his neck a portion of the India-rubber
  piping, and a small bag to contain later on enough <i>onthal</i> to try an
  experiment he had in his mind. The bottles containing the ingredients for the
  generation of the gas in question he secured about Harold's shoulders, and
  divesting themselves of everything besides the closely-fitting undergarments
  that they had constructed, they proceeded to charge themselves with the
  <i>scienatic</i> acid, which they did by absorbing it out of glass bottles,
  two of which they took on purpose, and having done so, launched themselves
  into the water.</p>

  <p>Armstrong followed closely in Telba's wake, whilst Asteria, who appeared
  to divine her way by instinct, plunged downwards, Harold, who had his finger
  tips on her shoulders, allowing her to guide him as she wished. It was a new
  but by no means unpleasant experience to find himself drifting through the
  crystal depths with this beautiful mermaid.</p>

  <p>Slowly at first, then faster and faster, they progressed, till having
  taken a steady downward direction, Asteria began to rise at a sign from her
  father. Watching them closely as he did, Harold could see that they were
  actually talking to one another, although, so far as he was concerned, no
  sound escaped their lips. They rose only to encounter a mass of foam and
  turbid waters, rushing with a force that fairly drove them downwards again as
  they tried backwards and forwards for an opening.</p>

  <p>Just as Asteria, faint and exhausted, was about to give up the task she
  saw Telba dart forward a few feet and then, with his hands down to his sides
  and his head held up, rise with great rapidity. Smiling pleasantly at Harold,
  who had been driven to his <i>scienatic</i> acid bottle again, she darted
  gracefully forward, and in a moment had commenced to rise in her turn,
  through the now calm, green water, although a little beyond their radius
  Harold could see it hissing and boiling like an angry furnace. It seemed to
  get lighter and lighter as they rose and presently reached the surface.</p>

  <p>"As I expected," Armstrong cried, as the air dissolved the acid, and he
  found his voice again, "I knew that water fell with a spiral motion."</p>

  <p><a id="pic009" name="pic009"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-09.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Harold looked round and saw that they were floating on a small sea, quiet
  as green glass, a patch of fluid some two acres in extent, with a perfect
  wall of water around them and sitting over their heads to the height of a few
  feet, like a very obtuse funnel, or, to put it more plainly, as if they were
  in a bell tent of water. The apex was as fine as a needle. It was so still
  and quiet there that they were not even conscious of the tremendous din of
  the descending cataract. And it was this enormous mass, over four hundred
  miles long and considerably more than fifty feet in width, that Armstrong
  proposed to bore as engineers bore through a solid rock.</p>

  <p>"This is better than I expected," Armstrong went on, "but do you think you
  could find your way here as easily again?"</p>

  <p>"We could not miss it now," Telba explained. "I cannot make you
  understand, of course, but even in the open water there are certain signs and
  indications which our practised eye can read, although they are invisible to
  you. Asteria and I could hit the very spot blindfolded."</p>

  <p>Armstrong nodded. It was all he wanted to know now. He rolled over on his
  back, and after a little trouble, succeeded, with Harold's assistance, in
  getting into the India-rubber bag the two essences necessary to cause
  <i>onthal</i> to be formed.</p>

  <p>When it seemed so him that sufficient chemical action had taken place to
  generate the necessary gases, he raised the tube towards the apex, and,
  pressing the India-rubber bag under his arm, directed the stream of gas
  towards the green water spinning so rapidly that it appeared like one solid
  emerald mass. But firm and compact as it was, the effect of the <i>onthal</i>
  was instantaneous. A round cylinder opened immediately, and in a few minutes
  appeared to have penetrated hundreds of yards upwards, whilst Asteria and
  Telba looked on with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"I want you to pay particular attention to this," Armstrong remarked, as
  he turned off the supply again, "because we shall require your assistance,
  and our safety depends to a great extent upon the manner in which you follow
  instructions. I am going to construct a large bag, to which will be attached
  some seven or eight of these little tubes. That bag will lie upon a platform
  I shall construct here, and upon that bag, when the gases are generated, I
  shall get a dozen or more of you to throw all your weight. You will take it
  in turns to do this for three hours altogether, taking care to keep the tubes
  pointed directly towards the apex. By this means, for nearly two hours I
  shall have a funnel eight or nine feet in diameter, pierced through that
  greet tower of falling water. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Telba, who had been following the speaker with intelligent
  interest, replied. "And I will get my friends to construct the platform you
  require without delay. But I confess I am curious to know how you propose to
  propel yourselves up the shaft to the outer world when it is completed."</p>

  <p>"I can hardly explain that, because the details are not yet settled in my
  own mind," Armstrong replied. "I shall be obliged if you will see to the
  platform being made as soon as possible. A wooden frame or raft, such as your
  houses are constructed upon, will be quite sufficient. I shall require to
  have a great variety of things brought here, but that is a detail."</p>

  <p>Anxious to get to work at once, Armstrong applied himself to his
  <i>scienatic</i> acid bottle, and Harold did the same, so that a few moments
  later they were diving down into the deep green water again, the water that
  represented both food and drink to the simple-minded Astrans.</p>

  <p>Half-an-hour later Telba was back in his house, Asteria had gone off to
  join her young companion down below somewhere, and Armstrong was busily
  engaged upon his works as if every moment was of the most vital importance.
  But to a man of action idleness is an utter impossibility.</p>

  <p>A miniature forge had been constructed, and for the next two days
  Armstrong, who appeared to be able to do everything, had turned out seven or
  eight large metal cups by melting downs the old marine wreck, each cup
  fitting within the other tightly, but in every case being about 4in. shorter
  than the other, and held in its place by a metal rim. To put it more plainly,
  the first cup was about 9ft.* in height, the next one 8ft. 8in., until the
  centre one, which was heavily weighted at the bottom, and covered over with a
  perforated conical top, was only 7ft. 8in. in height, and large enough in
  diameter to contain two men easily.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The numbers in this paragraph were barely legible in
  the magazine containing the story and those that have been recorded may not
  be correct. The numbers are not critical to the story as they are not
  referred to again.&#8212;ebook editor]</p>

  <p>In the inner cup Armstrong had stored some bottles of <i>scienatic</i>
  acid fitted with tubes for immediate use, some <i>dolomite</i> cartridges he
  had constructed, together with a small, tightly-sealed bag of <i>onthal</i>,
  the use of which will be appreciated in a short time.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you going to do with those gigantic coffee-tins?"
  Harold asked, as at length the work was finished and Telba had come with the
  information that the platform had been completed.</p>

  <p>"Get them conveyed to the platform in the first place," Armstrong replied
  dryly as he proceeded to envelope his curious invention in a rubber sheet,
  "if a few of Telba's neighbours will be good enough to help us."</p>

  <p>A number, who had gathered round, hearing that some interesting experiment
  was about to be attempted, expressed their willingness, and everything being
  packed in what Harold called the gigantic coffee-tins, the package was
  entrusted to a few stalwart Astrans, who, guided by Astoria, plunged into the
  water with their burden, and slowly made their way to the waterspout.</p>

  <p>"When are you going to make the attempt?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"Now," Armstrong replied promptly. "I am very curious to hear the best or
  worst that is going to happen, and those coffee-tins as you wittily term
  them, are to be the means of escape from here. Get out your <i>scienatic</i>
  acid and let us be off at once. I am all impatience. Everything will be
  explained by the time we reach the cataract."</p>

  <p>With a glance of admiration at the calm inscrutable features of his
  companion, Harold dropped into the water. Without hesitation Telba guided
  them to the centre of the waterspout, where the Astrans had already arrived
  with their heavy burden.</p>

  <p>A breathless silence pervaded the scene as Armstrong stripped off the
  covering and laid his implements upon the platform.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some moments Barrados was like a man bereft of reason.
  With fiendish glee he danced round the the chest, he laughed and chuckled as
  he plunged his arms deep down amongst the glittering gold pieces and let them
  run through his fingers in a stream like precious fire. Thousands upon
  thousands of pounds met his eye. There were jewels, diamonds, sapphires,
  pearls, and rubies beyond price, treasures to the amount of some two millions
  English, costly plate of gold and silver, all securely packed in the great
  chest.</p>

  <p>Best of all, every ounce of it was his. There was nobody to dispute the
  possession of all that wealth which he had only to hide, a bit at a time, and
  then, when all suspicion had blown over, return for it directly he could get
  the <i>Firefly</i> manned at Havana. If he could only get O'Brady, the only
  sailor who really knew the cause of the expedition, one of the way, there was
  nothing to fear. It would be the work of a few days to remove the gold to the
  shore, where it might easily be secreted till Barrados could place it in the
  small iron-clamped boxes they had procured for that purpose before they had
  left England.</p>

  <p>With these thoughts in his mind, Barrados hastily piled some loose coral
  upon the mound under which the box lay, and walked towards the shore. So far
  as he could see there was no one in sight, Don Zalva not having presented an
  appearance, and it was necessary now to put him off the scent.</p>

  <p>With his drill, Barrados removed the inscription from the tombstone and
  also the star-shaped marks from the rocks, so that no indications pointed to
  in the cypher might remain, and having done this, and also removed all traces
  of his late occupation, the Spaniard turned inland and disappeared in the
  direction of Don Zalva's <i>hacienda</i>.</p>

  <p>"Curiosity in some people is less of a fault then a disease," Larry
  muttered, as at length he emerged from his hiding-place, "and I expect I
  inherited it from an ancestor who had it badly. Sure, I must see what he's
  found, even if it's only to show that I take an interest in the general
  proceedings."</p>

  <p>Larry, in spite of his easygoing disposition, was by no means a fool. He
  had watched Barrados sufficiently closely, and had observed the landmarks
  with careful attention enough to know almost where the Spaniard had stood
  when he indulged in his extraordinary manifestations of joy. Within a short
  time the genial Irishman was standing over the mound of coral that Barrados
  had piled up to conceal the enormous treasure from the prying eyes of
  strangers.</p>

  <p>When at length he had removed the stones, and the full force of the
  treasure burst upon him, he simply staggered back and sat down to think.
  After a moment or two he replaced the stones, and then returned to the shore
  with his hands in his pockets, whistling softly. He could not quite grasp the
  whole situation yet, save that Barrados had made a discovery which he fully
  intended to keep to himself. Having come to this sapient conclusion, Larry
  lost no time in repairing to the <i>hacienda</i>, there to describe all he
  had seen and to ask Don Zalva's advice in the matter.</p>

  <p>He found the latter and Barrados seated together on the balcony with a
  flask of wine between them and a cigarette between the lips of each, whilst
  Haidee, pale and languid and attended by Isidore, sat in the shadow. The
  latter flashed a bright coquettish glance at Larry, who responded with a
  florid bow. The pretty Mexican girl had made a conquest of Larry's
  susceptible heart, but at the same time she had contrived to lose her own in
  the exchange.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe there is any treasure on the island at all, and if there
  ever was, it must have disappeared long ago," Barrados was saying as O'Brady
  came up. "The hot lava would be sufficient to destroy it."</p>

  <p>Larry restrained the speaker with an expression which he intended to be
  cunning, but which only served to arouse the Spaniard's suspicions. It never
  struck the simple-minded Irishman that under present circumstances his best
  policy was one of silence.</p>

  <p>"I shall make a thorough search to-morrow," Barrados went on, with the
  peculiar smile that Haidee found so hateful, "and if I find nothing, shall
  send O'Brady here across to Havana to get the crew of the yacht together.
  They have had a long holiday, and after what has happened I don't care to
  remain here."</p>

  <p>"And small blame to ye either," Larry burst out, "if ye was only honest
  about it 'stead of talking that way. Never a bit do I go to Havana and leave
  you here to find the treasure, when you have found it already. What were ye
  doin' only an hour ago, you lying thief of a cowardly Spaniard?"</p>

  <p><a id="pic010" name="pic010"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-10.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>White and trembling with rage, Barrados rose, and his hand sought his left
  side, with a significant gesture. Larry, nothing daunted, would have
  continued had not he caught a warning glance in Isidore's eyes, and not till
  then did he realise that he was bringing about just what he desired to
  prevent.</p>

  <p>"The fellow is mad," Barrados said hoarsely; "he has been drinking."</p>

  <p>"He does not sound like an intoxicated fellow," Don Zalva said dryly. "We
  should like to hear more of what you were saying, my good O'Brady."</p>

  <p>But Larry sulkily declined to say any more. He had made one mistake and
  did not intend his tongue to lead him into another. Muttering something about
  a mistake, and his objection to assert any positive opinion, he dropped into
  the background whilst Barrados showed his teeth in an engaging smile. But in
  his inmost heart the suspicious Spaniard registered a vow which, if carried
  out, meant a deadly peril to the over-loquacious Irishman.</p>

  <p>"You fool!" Isidore exclaimed as she found means to get away towards a
  shady group of myrtles with Larry at a command from her mistress to try and
  discover what had really happened. "What have you found out, and why do you
  let that hateful man know? He will do you a mischief yet."</p>

  <p>"I never saw the foreigner yet that I was afraid of," Larry returned
  valiantly.</p>

  <p>"What a pretty compliment to me and my countrymen!" Isidore laughed; "you
  are positively the most stupid man I ever met, and why I care for you is a
  mystery."</p>

  <p>"But you do care for me, pretty one?" Larry interrupted with
  tenderness.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do or I should not be here, silly man," Isidore said as she
  pretended to avoid the threatened caress. "You are too careless and insolent.
  If that man has discovered the treasure, he knows that you are aware of it.
  There will be trouble yet, and it behoves you to be careful. But here is
  something else I want to speak to you about. Before you came here I had four or
  five lovers, and&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"Now you have six," Larry put in, "and still they are not satisfied,
  confound 'em."</p>

  <p>"Satisfied! Alonzo and Paulo and Andrea and all the rest of them are
  furious with you; they have sworn to have your blood. Oh, do not laugh like
  that, do not take it so easily, you do not know how treacherous and merciless
  they are. They are all of them incensed against Don Zalva, too, and only need
  a little encouragement to plunder the <i>hacienda</i> and murder us all. I
  overheard them talking last night in a way that made my blood run cold.
  Remember, if they do break out, we have nobody to protect us but the Don and
  you."</p>

  <p>Larry clenched his teeth savagely. In his present mood against Barrados
  the notion of a brush with him or anyone like him, as all foreigners were
  creatures to be condemned in O'Brady's eyes, was rather pleasant than
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>"They won't do anything," he said, "and don't you get worrying your pretty
  little head about that. Fair fighting, and I could beat the lot."</p>

  <p>"You might," Isidore shuddered, "but that is not their way. Even you are
  powerless against a treacherous thrust in the back some dark night&#8212;this
  very one, perhaps."</p>

  <p>No such gloomy forebodings troubled Larry, his contempt for the average
  man of anything but English blood was far too great. He promised cheerfully
  enough to take every precaution to protect himself from danger, but nothing,
  not even the fear of Alonzo and Paulo and Andrea, prevented him from
  returning with Isidore to the servants' quarters. He was not going to leave
  her to be annoyed by a lot of greasy Mexicans, a remark Isidore accepted in
  very good part considering that Larry was reviling her own countrymen.</p>

  <p>They sat out under the myrtles and lemon boughs till the fireflies began
  to twinkle out, whilst the men servants smoked their <i>papelilos</i> to the
  sleepy music of a gaiter. Isidore's recreant lovers sat moodily together,
  casting threatening glances from to time in Larry's direction, as he coolly
  monopolised the fair cause of all the turmoil.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in spite of all the thoughts that were troubling him, Barrados
  remained at the <i>hacienda</i> long after dinner had been disposed of, and
  Haidee, under pretence of a headache, had retired for the night. Don Zalva,
  who was hospitable before all things, pressed the Spaniard to take up his
  quarters there for the night, and indeed, so long as he remained on the
  island of Mea Culpa. But Barrados, with the memory of that treasure strong
  upon him, dared not run the risk.</p>

  <p>"I think I am better where I am," he said reluctantly, "besides, I have
  been so long a wanderer that I could not sleep in a bed. And I am going to
  devote the rest of my stay here to hunting for the treasure."</p>

  <p>Don Zalva looked sharply at the speaker. He had not yet forgotten
  O'Brady's words, and the Spaniard saw that such was the case.</p>

  <p>"You seem to doubt me a little," he said, with a forced laugh. "Surely you
  would take my solemn word before that of an ignorant sailor."</p>

  <p>"You are my guest, and a gentleman always accepts a statement till be
  knows it to be incorrect," Don Zalva said politely. "But even yet, such is
  the faith I have in that wonderful Signor Armstrong, I have not given up all
  hopes of seeing him and his young friend again. If this treasure is found
  practically upon my property, and you decide to leave us, I must courteously
  request that two-thirds of the same be left in my hands until I have
  satisfied myself that our friends are really dead. You may claim it in six
  months."</p>

  <p>"I make no objection," Barrados said coolly. "Indeed, your proposal is a
  fair one. When I find the treasure I will let you know."</p>

  <p>With these words Barrados rose to go. The night was getting on and already
  most of the household had retired to rest as the Spaniard lighted is final
  cigarette and, having shaken hands with his host, set out for his tent under
  the seashore.</p>

  <p>He had not a long distance to go, and even in the dark every step was
  familiar to him. He had not proceeded far before he became conscious of the
  fact that someone was following him. He stepped cautiously on till presently
  he wheeled round suddenly and, striking a match, held it above his head. In
  the circle of light caused by the flame he saw the figure of a man crouch
  down. Quick as thought he whipped out a revolver and pointed it towards the
  still motionless figure.</p>

  <p>"Rise and throw up your hands, or by heavens I shall fire!" he
  commanded.</p>

  <p>Hesitatingly the man obeyed, and as Barrados moved towards him he
  recognised the swarthy, sinister features of the individual whom Isidore had
  spoken of as Paulo. He looked at Barrados with sullen fear.</p>

  <p>"I was not following you. I did not mean any harm to you, I swear," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"How do I know that? What brings you here at this time, then?"</p>

  <p>A sudden passion blazed up in Paulo's eyes. In his anger he forgot his
  fear.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you then," he hissed. "I was following that sailor who came
  here with you, this O'Brady. <i>Jesu</i>, what a name! He has been warned
  more than once if he persists in his attentions to&#8212;but you
  understand&#8212;and he will not be warned. I watched and waited outside the
  <i>hacienda</i> to-night and when you came out I thought you were
  him&#8212;and&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"And you followed me under the impression that I was O'Brady. If I had
  been, you would have murdered me, I suppose?" Barrados asked grimly.</p>

  <p>"What would you have?" Paulo said, with a careless shrug. "He has been
  warned."</p>

  <p>Barrados pulled his moustache reflectively. His quick mind showed him that
  here was a way out of his difficulty. He read greed and cunning in the dark
  eyes of the man watching him, and determined on a bold stroke.</p>

  <p>"Let us suppose that I have a good reason for wishing to see O'Brady out
  of the way," he said. "Supposing I say nothing about this to anyone, but let
  you go unscathed. Supposing I could show you how to make five hundred dollars
  without any risk, would you be prepared to follow me?"</p>

  <p>"Follow you, Señor," Paulo laughed. "For five hundred dollars I would do
  anything. I could leave here and take Isidore along. I&#8212;<i>caramba</i>!
  only try me."</p>

  <p>"I am going to try you, and I am going to test you also," Barrados said
  grimly. "I want you to procure four men like yourself and come to my tent
  to-morrow morning at daybreak. If O'Brady returns to-night you must not come,
  as there will be no dollars, you understand. But if he does not
  return&#8212;"</p>

  <p>Barrados paused with a significant smile, whilst Paulo showed his yellow
  teeth in an ugly grin of appreciation. Without another word the Spaniard
  resumed his walk towards the shore whilst Paulo crept back to the
  <i>hacienda</i>. Half an hour later, with three desperadoes as abandoned as
  himself, he was hiding behind some mimosa bushes, waiting for Larry to pass.
  Their patience was not put to a very severe test as presently, utterly
  unconscious of his danger, and whistling some light ditty, O'Brady came
  along, and as he passed the mimosa bushes the ruffians dashed upon him.</p>

  <p>Like a flash he realised his danger, and as the first form, with knife
  uplifted, came towards him his fist shot out and dashed against the forehead
  of the would-be assassin with a sickening crash.</p>

  <p>"Come on, all of ye, and see what a real Irish welcome is!" he cried.
  "Holy Moses, if you put those knives down I'm good for the lot at once! Ah,
  ye murtherin' coward! you'd strike a defenceless man in the back, would
  ye."</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-11.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>Like lightning the Irishman wheeled round, and at the expense of a flesh
  wound in the arm warded off the descending blow, and a moment later his
  antagonist was lying in the dust with hie nose almost smashed to the face.
  But it was Larry's last effort as, like an arrow from a bow, another ruffian
  dashed forward and buried his knife in the Irishman's left side. With a cry
  and a groan he fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"He's dead enough," Paulo remarked as he spurned the prostrate body with
  his foot. "<i>Tesla</i>, he strikes like the kick of a mule. My face will
  carry the mark to the grave. Throw the body into the bushes there for the
  present."</p>

  <p>Coolly enough the three desperadoes obeyed the command of their
  ringleader, and no sound came from the body as it crashed into the
  undergrowth. Scarcely had the retreating footsteps of the assassins died away
  than the figure of a woman emerged from the darkness. With a little sob she
  set upon the body and laid her ear to O'Brady's heart. As if satisfied by her
  examination, and as if endowed for the time with phenomenal strength, she
  took Larry up in her arms and by easy stages carried him to Don Zalva's
  <i>hacienda</i>.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <p class="first">ARMSTRONG placed his curious contrivance on the edge of the
  platform, and for some minutes occupied himself with a careful examination of
  the affair. He satisfied himself that the cups or tins fitted exactly inside
  one another, and this being done, he drew up from the bottom of the inside
  one a series of hollow wires fitting into one another to the number of eight.
  The inner who was about an inch longer than the one into which it was fitted,
  so that he could press it down until it disappeared, and leave number two
  uppermost about an inch above number three, until the whole were exhausted.
  Each of these wires corresponded with one of the caps, the longest one being
  attached to the outer canister and the shortest one to the last canister but
  one.</p>

  <p>A layer of <i>dolomite</i> was packed in the bottom of each cup, and the
  wires were intended to fire one charge after another from the outer one
  inwards and upwards. Then Armstrong placed his essences in the huge
  India-rubber bag and, giving the eight tubes to various Astrans, bid them
  hold them upwards in a circle towards the apex of the watery ceiling, whilst
  a dozen more of the spectators flung themselves upon the bag, and so acted as
  weights do when attached to a gasometer, thus causing the gas, when
  generated, to rush upwards.</p>

  <p>"This gas is so powerful," Armstrong explained, "that it will penetrate
  anything like water, which has at the same time the power of attracting and
  being repelled by it. If you will keep those tubes steadily directed upwards
  for a few moments the water will be bored as far as it goes upwards."</p>

  <p>In an incredibly short space of time the wondering spectators were looking
  up a black endless shaft at least ten feet in diameter. The walls appeared to
  be constructed of solid shining steel. If it had been lined with gun-proof
  metal the effect could not have been mere satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"After we are gone I will get you to remain as you are till the gas in
  that bag is exhausted," Armstrong went on. "Not that there will be any need,
  because long before that our experiment will have terminated one way or
  another, but I like to be on the safe side. By this time the way of
  connection between this and the waters of the upper world is complete."</p>

  <p>"But I am quite ignorant as to how you intend to climb the shaft," Harold
  said. "All I can see at present is a peculiarly long canister, with a top
  something like a modern chimney cowl."</p>

  <p>"I was just coming to that. The apparatus you see before you is nothing
  but what I call a recurring rocket&#8212;that is, a rocket that, by a series
  of properly regulated explosions, rises higher and higher till the force is
  exhausted. With ordinary gunpowder I could construct such a firework that
  would rise forty thousand feet, or twice the height of Mont Blanc. How much
  more then can I do with the <i>dolomite</i>&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"Which you say only strikes horizontally," Harold ventured to suggest.</p>

  <p>"Yes, if made in a certain way, with the addition of a certain material,
  it strikes downwards, and by granulating it, I can make it take an upward
  direction. See these wires inside that tube. By pressing the longest one,
  that goes down to the base of my nest of canisters, I fire a charge of
  <i>dolomite</i> that leaves the inside seven whilst the outer one acts as a
  mortar, such as ordinary bombs are fired from. As <i>all</i> the force
  strikes upwards, there is no possible danger for the spectators and, such is
  the power of the <i>dolomite</i>, we shall be carried upwards a distance of
  not less than forty miles."</p>

  <p>"Then you actually propose that we should be in the rocket."</p>

  <p>"In the inner and last chamber, certainly. Do not interrupt me for a
  moment. I know what you are going to say. Forty miles out of nearly four
  hundred is not very much, but we shall be at least twenty minutes rising so
  high. Directly the speed slackens, I touch the second wire and discharge
  another bomb, as it were. The second canister acts as a mortar like the
  first, and again we rise a similar distance. Firing the charges one after
  another we could rise to the height of four hundred miles, but there will be
  no necessity to fire more than five, for a reason that any schoolboy can
  understand."</p>

  <p>Harold was silent. It might be palpable to most people, but so far as he
  was concerned, he could not understand matter at all. As he looked up the
  black, glittering, forbidding-looking funnel he shuddered to contemplate the
  great and unknown danger they were about to explore.</p>

  <p>"I am willing to trust myself in your hands, and to run any hazard you
  deem necessary," he said, "but if anything went wrong what an awful fate
  would be ours! Still, I will place no obstacle in your way."</p>

  <p>Armstrong looked up so calmly and fearlessly that his courage and
  resolution had a stimulating effect on Coventry. No danger seemed to awe the
  old sailor and, above all, he had unbounded confidence in his own powers. And
  yet the proposed undertaking was one calculated to quell the stoutest
  heart.</p>

  <p>"I have not entered upon this thing lightly," he said, "and no man risks
  his life without counting the cost. All my experiments have stood the test of
  practical experience. But if you do not care to undertake&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"Do not mention that," Harold interrupted. "I am going to accompany
  you."</p>

  <p>Armstrong waited for more. Heartily grasping Telba's hand, and having
  greeted the rest of the Astrans in the same manner, the adventurers entered
  the cylinder, and Armstrong adjusted the cap.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye!" he shouted cheerfully. "Do not forget to remain where you are
  until all the gas in the bag is exhausted. And now stand clear, and do not
  touch this tube, as you value your lives. Are you right there?"</p>

  <p>Scarcely had the response been given when the old sailor took up a hammer
  from the floor of the cylinder and brought it down sharply upon the topmost
  wire. There was a tremendous explosion that rang in the ears of the
  spectators for days afterwards, a slight vibration, and true as an arrow from
  a bow, the conical ballet-shaped mass sped up the watery funnel with the
  swiftness of the wind, leaving nothing but the lowest empty canister
  behind.</p>

  <p>For a few minutes, such was the velocity of their ascent, all Armstrong
  and Coventry could do was to crouch upon the floor of their prison house and
  try to recover their scattered senses. The air pressing down the shaft hissed
  and whistled like ten thousand demons as they sped upwards. The deadly
  pressure cut their faces like knives and caused the blood to flow freely from
  their nostrils.</p>

  <p>Always strong and sturdy, Armstrong threw off the awful feeling and,
  striking a rude match of his own composition, set fire to a couple of
  inflammable substances that sent a glare up the funnel and filled the
  cylinder with light. He raised the cap and, standing upright, looked out.</p>

  <p>For a moment the wind was so strong that it nearly beat him back again.
  In the ruddy glare he could see that they were still progressing upwards as
  the down-falling water hissed and sparkled. Presently the pressure of wind
  grew less, the peculiar candles burnt with a more steady glare, and then the
  upward motion of the peculiar aerial ship began to flag and roll
  ominously.</p>

  <p>Nothing daunted by this, Armstrong struck the second longest wire, and as
  it disappeared, without the slightest shock or vibration, the cylinder darted
  upwards again, like a thing filled with new life.</p>

  <p>An exclamation of triumph broke from Armstrong's lips. The experiment was
  going to be wholly successful.</p>

  <p>It was some little time before Harold had sufficiently recovered to take
  any interest in what was going on around him. The fourth charge had been
  fired, and the cylinder was still rising with terrific velocity, before he
  ventured to stand up and look out of the shining wall of water with
  Armstrong, whose face was beaming with success.</p>

  <p>"How far do you calculate that we have risen by this time?" Harold asked
  feebly.</p>

  <p>"Nearly two hundred miles." Armstrong replied, and he touched the fifth
  wire. "I am now beginning to know exactly how long to allow between each
  discharge. And unless I am greatly mistaken, we shall not want to try
  another."</p>

  <p>"Not another and we have still half the distance to travel!"</p>

  <p>Armstrong made no reply. He was watching the wall of water with deep
  interest. The minutes sped on, but they did not slacken. The time for firing
  the next shot was long past and yet they seemed to rise rapidly. Presently
  Harold gave a lurch, and a feeling came over him as if someone were trying to
  lift him out of the cup when Armstrong banged the cowl to and fastened it.
  The same queer sensation overcame them both. It seamed as if the cylinder had
  turned over. When they scrambled to their feet again they were standing <i>on
  the cowl</i>. The bottom of the canister had by some mysterious means become
  the roof.</p>

  <p>"What on earth does it all mean?" Harold asked. "Are we falling?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we are," Armstrong cried exultingly. "Exactly what I
  anticipated has happened, and there will no longer be occasion to fire a
  charge, even if we could in this inverted condition. We within the area of
  the earth's attraction now and we are falling, but falling towards our own
  outer planet. So long as this shaft remains open we are bound to return to
  earth. We are falling towards it, or rising towards it now, exactly for the
  same reason that Newton's apple came to the ground.</p>

  <p>"I follow you," Harold said as he grasped the gist of Armstrong's remarks,
  "but where should we land eventually, and what is to prevent us, when we come
  to the end of our journey, from being crushed into the earth?"</p>

  <p>"I have made every provision for that," Armstrong said calmly. "Directly
  the atmosphere becomes more dense, which will, I calculate, be at the time
  these lights have burned out, I know that we shall be abut the pit made when
  the Island of Santa Anna was floated, and therefore instead of a wall of
  water, as we have at present, or rather a chimney of water surrounded by air,
  we shall be back into what, for want of a better term, I will call the
  <i>solid</i> sea.</p>

  <p>"Once that is reached I propose, directly we rise above the orifice by
  which we descended, to turn this tube towards the well of water by our united
  strength, with a discharge of the sixth load of <i>dolomite</i> to force our
  way through and thus get out of the vortex of the whirlpool that dragged us
  down. With three charges left we have quite enough to take us beyond the
  radius of the maelstrom."</p>

  <p>"It seems plausible enough and, indeed, I have no right to doubt you after
  all you have done, but how are you to know when we have passed out of this
  passage into the Mexican Gulf?" Harold asked. "If you make a mistake of forty
  or fifty miles we should shoot clean through the water shaft and nothing
  could prevent us landing upon what I might call the inner earth's crust, and
  in that case not even your ingenuity could save us from destruction."</p>

  <p>"I think you may safely leave that to me," Armstrong replied quietly. "Up
  to now my calculations have been amply verified by results."</p>

  <p>As he spoke the lights became gradually low until they almost disappeared.
  Rapidly Armstrong took up the two bottles of <i>scienatic</i> acid and bade
  Harold inhale his without loss of time, and then secure it to his person.
  Scarcely was the operation complete when the lights went out altogether, and
  immediately the atmosphere became grey and luminous. Armstrong paused just a
  moment and flung himself down sideways, dragging Harold with him.</p>

  <p>"Now!" he cried, as the cylinder swung across the shaft till the funnel
  pointed against the watery wall, "take the hammer and strike quickly."</p>

  <p>He did not speak a moment too soon, as the cylinder swayed ominously.
  Harold, without a moment's hesitation, struck the wire. There was a
  tremendous splash and hissing gurgle as the cylinder crashed against the
  liquid barrier, and with a mighty impetus penetrated it until it was brought
  almost to a standstill by the resistance, after having traversed a couple of
  hundred yards.</p>

  <p>"Again," Armstrong signalled, as he slightly steered the course of the
  cylinder, which stopped and began to retrogress. "Quick, for your life!"</p>

  <p>Again the charge was fired, and again the cylinder bored its way through
  the waves, only to stop again after making a few hundred yards' headway, and
  when the last explosion lifted it forward, till it finally stopped, wavered
  and commenced again to feel the force of that powerful suction.</p>

  <p>Armstrong wrenched the funnel open and, dragging Harold out, flung himself
  upon a rocky fragment and held on to it for dear life itself.</p>

  <p><a id="pic012" name="pic012"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-12.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>The force of the current was tremendous. One explosion less, and the whole
  experiment must have ended in disastrous failure. Slowly and painfully they
  clung to the hard rocky bottom and little by little worked their way along
  till they finally found themselves outside the power of that awful
  whirlpool.</p>

  <p>It was quite time, for they were utterly exhausted, and a thrill of
  anxiety pervaded Armstrong as he realised that the amount of <i>scienatic</i>
  acid in their bodies would not last out much longer. They charged themselves
  again, and Armstrong, feeling that it was safe at length to relinquish their
  hold, they gave way and commenced to rise to the surface, a distance of
  eighteen hundred feet.</p>

  <p>Before the tube had drifted back towards the vortex, Armstrong had taken
  the precaution to secure all the loose <i>dolomite</i> cartridges therein, a
  precaution which he had every reason to congratulate himself upon before very
  long.</p>

  <p>Some time before they reached the surface, for bodies rise but slowly, all
  the <i>scienatic</i> acid in the bottles was exhausted. Coventry's head
  commenced to swim, and red spots danced before his eyes with the effort to
  keep his breath as the acid passed away. His head seemed to be bursting, and
  he flung up his arms and would have sunk again had not Armstrong caught
  him.</p>

  <p>With this agony upon them, they still rose, and as they did so it became
  darker and darker, till at length the blackness became absolutely dense. A
  feeling akin to despair agitated the old sailor as he felt what a dead weight
  his companion was in his arms, and then, when all seemed to be lost, his head
  touched something, which he grasped with one hand and, putting his herculean
  strength into the task, climbed on to a sharp shelving ledge of coral rock.
  They were saved.</p>

  <p>When Harold came to himself with a fluttering sigh, he was lying on some
  hard surface in the pitch darkness, without an idea as to where he was.
  Armstrong's hand was on his heart and the old salt gave a joyful exclamation
  as he saw that his young companion had not suffered severely from the awful
  journey.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" Harold asked, "and why is it so dark?"</p>

  <p>"I can only guess," Armstrong replied. "We had a terrible journey upwards
  and I had not breath enough left to steer a proper course. But so far as I
  can judge, we have struck one of the caves under the floating island. We are
  safe enough here and there is plenty of air. The next question is, How are we
  going to get through to the surface? as the <i>scienatic</i> acid is
  completely exhausted. Once let us find a way to penetrate the crust above us,
  and we are free."</p>

  <a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <p class="first">HOW Isidore contrived to get the body of the wounded man to
  the <i>hacienda</i> she never knew.</p>

  <p>Although the rest of the house was plunged in darkness, even to the
  servants' quarters, as if none of them had been moving lately, there was
  still a faint ray of light streaming from under the green jalousies of the
  apartment which Don Zalva kept as a combined office, library and
  smoking-reran. She tapped lightly upon the blind, and in a few moments Don
  Zalva appeared.</p>

  <p>His face grew black and stern as he listened to the incoherent recital of
  the distracted girl. There was no time to be lost in idle questions, and the
  first thing was to get O'Brady to a place of safety, and where his wound
  might receive due attention. Situated as he was, and dependent in a great
  measure upon himself in matters of this kind, the Don possessed a
  considerable knowledge of surgery, and once Larry had been removed to a
  bedroom, he found that the wound was not so dangerous as might have been
  expected under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"This must be kept a secret from the household at present," he said
  quietly. "There is no one here that I can absolutely depend upon, and if
  those scoundrels knew that we had discovered their perfidy, they would not
  hesitate a moment to murder us all. Go to your room now and leave this man to
  me, and remember that not a soul must know that he is here."</p>

  <p>Despite the difficulty of keeping anything of so serious a nature a
  secret, part of the following day went by without discovery. Barrados,
  simulating distress and uneasiness, called at the <i>hacienda</i> to know if
  they had seen anything of O'Brady. Don Zalva listened with polite interest
  and regret, but as the Spaniard proceeded he could not conclude otherwise
  than that he was acting a part, and that he was party to the cowardly
  deed.</p>

  <p>"If he is the victim of foul play, depend upon it, the villains will
  suffer," he said sternly. "Had not you better come here to sleep?"</p>

  <p>Barrados declined hastily, so hastily that the Don's suspicions were
  confirmed. But what object could Barrados have in getting rid of O'Brady
  unless he had discovered the long-lost treasure? The Don turned this problem
  over in his mind, and determined to discover the truth for himself. As the
  day wore on he could not help noticing that a change had come over Paulo and
  the other male servants, a sullen vindictiveness that caused him to tremble
  for the safety of his beloved daughter.</p>

  <p>But he was by no means the only one who was aroused sad watchful. Isidore,
  mad and distracted at the dastardly outrage perpetrated on the man she loved,
  and longing with all the passionate eagerness of her race for vengeance on
  her enemies, watched them with the intentness of a cat watching a mouse.</p>

  <p>To Paulo and Andrea and the rest, she was gay and reckless. She professed
  to regard O'Brady's mysterious disappearance as a matter of indifference, but
  no motions of theirs escaped her, and more than one hint did she hear dropped
  concerning the plans of the conspirators. Under her flashing smile, Isidore
  masked her rage, as she learnt that Barrados was at the bottom of the
  diabolical conspiracy.</p>

  <p>The evening fell again at length, and as yet the would-be assassins were
  ignorant of the fact that their victim was so near them. As darkness came
  over the island first one, and then another, of the men slipped away, Paulo
  being detained upon some household duty till the last, but when he crept
  cautiously from the house, Isidore felt that it would be safe to follow.</p>

  <p>With cat-like tread she dogged his footsteps to the shore until he came at
  length to the tent that Barrados occupied, where, from the sound of muffled
  voice, the girl rightly guessed that the others had forgathered. They paused
  as Paulo's step was heard but, directly he entered the tent, the babel of
  voices resumed. Very cautiously Isidore crept a little closer and listened
  intently.</p>

  <p>"I am a little late," she heard Paulo say, "obeying my master's commands
  for, I hope, the last time. What have you decided, my friends?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing until you came," Barrados replied. "I want the assistance of you
  all to help me to run the yacht to the Philippine Islands, as most of you are
  sailors enough to do that, for which I will pay you five hundred
  dollars."</p>

  <p>"Down," Andrea remarked. "For the risk we must have the money first."</p>

  <p>"Half down and half when we reach our destination, then. It is a fair
  offer, I think, and one which will be hard to find again. Besides which you
  may take what you like from the hacienda here, and I shall not be likely to
  say anything, provided that Don Zalva is silenced, you understand, and his
  daughter accompanies us."</p>

  <p>"It is a risk," Paulo muttered, "the money is not much for that."</p>

  <p>"It was a risk you had been contemplating long before I ever came here,"
  Barrados replied grimly. "I could see that, directly I met you. And if you
  murder the Don, as you fully intend to do, how do you expect to get away from
  this island? I find you a comfortable, well-found yacht and a large sum of
  money when once you are beyond the range of pursuit. All I ask in return is
  that you help me to navigate the yacht for a few hundred miles, and that you
  be on board to-morrow night when the tide makes&#8212;with Donna Haidee to
  keep you company."</p>

  <p>The ruffians looked at one another somewhat uneasily. It was easy work to
  plot and boast and swagger, but a very different thing when at came to
  prompt, bold action. Barrados flung away his cigarette with an impatient
  curse.</p>

  <p>"You are afraid," he said contemptuously. "I thought you would be."</p>

  <p>"Not afraid to strike you down as we did O'Brady," Paulo said, with a
  flash of his glittering eyes, "if we have any more of your insults. It is
  easy enough for you to say do this and do that when you do not share the
  danger."</p>

  <p>"Bah! I pay you to run the risk, and where duty and inclination go
  together there should be no hesitation whatsoever. I must get away from here,
  and unless you agree to accompany me I must try to make up a crew from one of
  the adjacent islands. Besides, where is the danger? There are five of you
  against an unsuspecting old man who may be lured out of the house on any
  pretext, and finished off with one of those neat strokes you understand so
  well. The tide makes at midnight to-morrow, and I see nothing to prevent us
  starting."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as you wish," Paulo replied. "But you would not object were
  we to bring Isidore&#8212;merely to look after her mistress, you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>A burst of brutal laughter followed this sally. Isidore clenched her
  little teeth, and vowed that the speaker should pay dearly for his temerity.
  Her courage rose as she began to appreciate the danger in which she
  stood.</p>

  <p>"One woman more or less makes no difference," Barrados answered. "Let it
  be as you like. And now let us fully understand one another. I shall not
  trouble to communicate with you further, but at midnight go on the yacht,
  where I will keep lights burning, and leave a boat on the shore to take you
  off. There is nothing more that I need to say."</p>

  <p>The conspirators rose, seeing that the interview was ended. With more
  coarse jests at the expense of their intended victims the conspirators slunk
  away, and as they did so, Barrados, after looking carefully round to see that
  they had really deported, took up his lamp and repaired to the workshop
  where, until recently, Armstrong had carried on his experiments. Impelled by
  some feeling of curiosity, Isidore followed him, and, treading like a cat,
  concealed herself so that she could follow all his movements.</p>

  <p>Barrados placed the light upon a huge packing-case, and, taking a key from
  his pocket, opened one small square box after another until the lamp flashed
  upon as least a dozen dazzling heaps of treasure. By dint of perseverance and
  caution he had continued to convey the gold and precious stones from their
  hiding-place to the boxes which had been constructed purposely to hold it
  when found, until in the original hiding-place designed by Amyas Coventry
  there remained not more than ten thousand dollars in gold, which Barrados had
  left till the following morning. The treasure was quite safe, even exposed as
  it was, as its existence was not suspected by anyone with the exception of
  Don Zalva and Haidee.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what those rascals would do if they knew of this?" Barrados
  muttered. "Murder me very likely. I wish it were all safely stored away in
  the yacht's hold. There is a day's work before me tomorrow, enough for a
  giant."</p>

  <p>Still muttering, he closed the lids one after another and then turned to
  go, but not before Isidore had stolen away into the darkness. She saw it all
  now: Barrados had found the enormous treasure of which she had heard
  something from Haidee, and the plan was to get it safely away before Don
  Zalva should discover what had happened and lay an embargo upon the whole
  sum. For this the Don was to be foully murdered and she and Haidee to be
  forcibly carried off.</p>

  <p>She lost no time in informing Don Zalva of her discovery. Late though it
  was, he decided to make Larry&#8212;whose robust constitution was making
  headway against his wound&#8212;acquainted with the turn of affairs, and to
  ask his advice upon the matter.</p>

  <p>"Would it be wise, do you think?" Isidore asked. "He is weak, and any
  excitement&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"He is far better than you think, girl," Don Zalva replied. "I have a
  scheme which may be successful, but I cannot carry it out without consulting
  O'Brady, who can tell me everything I wish to know. No one knew more of
  Armstrong's experiments than he did, and with his assistance I think I could
  contrive to keep back the intended catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"Until we could find some means to communicate with the mainland?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. If something happened to postpone the departure of Barrados
  for, say, a week, I could contrive to make communication with my friends, and
  thus surprise the ruffians. Without assistance we are powerless.</p>

  <p>"We could die hard," Isidore said with flashing eyes. "The villain
  who laid violent hands on me would have cause to repent his temerity. You
  have no man who can assist you here, but you may rely on me, if I am but a
  woman.</p>

  <p>"I believe you," Don Zalva said with gentle courtesy. "And now let us tell
  everything to this Irishman and see if he can help us."</p>

  <p>They found Larry in a peaceful sleep from which he awoke directly the Don
  touched him. He appeared to have rallied from his injury in a really
  wonderful manner and followed all that Don Zalva had to tell him with rapt
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Sure, and it's hardly worth while to wake a man up if you haven't any
  better news than that to tell him," he said in his driest manner. "I am not
  of much account now, worse luck, but you can count upon me for a little."</p>

  <p>"It is only a little that is required," Don Zalva replied, "I have a plan
  in my head and you can help me to carry it out. Barrados dare not trust those
  scoundrels, and if I could only make it impossible for him to carry off the
  treasure without their assistance, he would stop the present scheme, and we
  should thereby gain the delay which is of such vital importance to us."</p>

  <p>"I see," Larry said quietly. "And your plan is to&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"To get at that silver and transform all the gold and silver into one
  solid mass. Once this was done Barrados dare not take Paulo and the other
  ruffians into his confidence. If it could only be done and he was delayed for
  a day or two."</p>

  <p>"It can be done!" Larry exclaimed with marvellous energy for a wounded
  man. "Do you remember the last experiment the old captain ever showed
  you?"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I em alluding to," Don Zalva replied. "I told him
  that this island contained iron end copper ore which could not be worked for
  want of proper machinery. I showed him a mass of both metals, and with some
  acid he produced he immediately turned the whole into one great ball with a
  view to further experiment at a later period. O'Brady, if we can only procure
  this acid, and get at the treasure, our lives are saved."</p>

  <p>"Give it me and I will do it," Isidore exclaimed. "I am not afraid."</p>

  <p>"The two men regarded the speaker for a few moments in silent admiration.
  Taken as they were by her spirit and boldness, they naturally hesitated to
  confide such a dangerous task to the hand of a woman.</p>

  <p>"Why do you hesitate?" she went on. "Do I look timid or fearful? Your
  place, Don Zalva, is here, and you have nobody but me. I know where the
  treasure is and I will accomplish your desire if you will but arm me with a
  reliable revolver. As you know, it is safe in my hands."</p>

  <p>Don Zalva nodded. Isidore was no mean shot, as he knew.</p>

  <p>"Let her try, the purty creature," Larry said tenderly. "She knows the
  workshop, and all is quiet now. If she goes in there and reaches to the top
  shelf of the cupboard she will find a bottle marked '<i>intallic acid'</i>.
  Once all the gold you speak of is laid out on the floor a few drops will be
  sufficient."</p>

  <p>"We will both go," Don Zalva said, with sudden determination, "and at
  once."</p>

  <p>Larry made no reply. Nothing but his own lack of strength prevented him
  from making an attempt to join the expedition. With a fervent hope that they
  would be successful, he bade them go, and a few moments later silence reigned
  supreme.</p>

  <p>It was nearly half-an-hour afterwards that Don Zalva and his companion
  reached the workshop, which was situated some three hundred yards from
  Barrados's tent. They had little or no difficulty in opening the door, and
  once inside got to work with great rapidity. With a tin lantern to light
  them, Don Zalva, assisted by Isidore, who worked as if dear life depended
  upon her exertions, contrived to pour all the treasure into a large packing
  case, so that none of it might escape. The perspiration ran down the faces of
  the toilers, but at length their task was completed. All that remained now
  was to find the acid and apply it to the glittering mass.</p>

  <p>"Thank Heaven," Don Zalva muttered as he came upon the right phial at
  last. "And now let us make this thing sure at once."</p>

  <p>He wrenched the glass-stopper from the bottle, and lavishly sprinkled the
  contents over the mixture of gold and jewels and precious stones; the latter,
  he knew, would suffer no injury by contact with the acid. Immediately he did
  so a dense cloud of smoke and film arose which, when it cleared away,
  disclosed a realised concrete lump of gold of tremendous weight. It was a
  little warm, but cooled rapidly, scarcely burning the receptacle in which it
  was contained.</p>

    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-13.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"That is accomplished," Don Zalva said; "let us go back at once to the
  <i>hacienda</i>."</p>

  <p>Morning dawned and Barrados rose to his hard day's toil. He opened the
  treasure chests one after the other to find them empty. Frantically he
  wrenched open one packing case after the other in his despair, till at length
  he reached the right one. And then when he saw what had happened he fell
  against the wall with a groan.</p>

  <p>"What am I to do?" he said with a bitter curse. "<i>They</i> could not
  have done it because they knew nothing, and if I told them they would only
  murder me too. Who on earth could&#8212;" Here a cold perspiration broke upon
  him. "Can those men have escaped death in some miraculous way? Paulo must be
  stopped going on with his scheme at once. I must have time to work out
  another plan."</p>
  <hr>
  <a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR some two hours Armstrong and Coventry lay upon the rocky
  ledge until they had entirely recovered from the effects of their terrible
  journey. It was perfectly dark there, but entirely devoid of all danger, save
  the very unpleasant one of starvation. But so long as there was life there
  was hope, and Armstrong had too often been in situations of peril to feel
  alarmed at the present situation.</p>

  <p>"We cannot stay here," he said, when at length he had made a thorough
  examination of their prison house. "There is one thing I can see for it, and
  that is to swim about till we find some opening for escape for us."</p>

  <p>"But supposing we cannot find anything of the sort?" Harold suggested. "We
  might swim about in these caves without finding any outlet or, indeed, any
  place where we could rest when we were tired, and if we could not find our
  way back to this place again, we might be drowned like rats."</p>

  <p>"Not if one of us were to go and leave the other behind."</p>

  <p>"How would that assist us? We might just as well starve together."</p>

  <p>"Not if I can find what I want," Armstrong replied cheerfully. "All we
  want is a rope long enough to give one plenty of scope to swim about whilst
  the other remains here to haul him back if necessary, and it was found
  impossible to discover an opening. Supposing you remain here holding one end
  of the rope whilst I swim about. If the rope becomes taut, you will know that
  I have been successful, in which case you must attach one end here and feel
  your way along till you come to the opening."</p>

  <p>"An exceedingly good notion," Harold replied, "provided that you can find
  the rope."</p>

  <p>But Armstrong was not the man to be easily daunted. There was something
  near him, if he could only find it, that would solve the desired purpose, he
  knew, and that was the long, leathery, thong-like seaweed that grows so
  freely in the Mexican Gulf, and which, when plaited together, would form a
  cord long enough and strong enough to support a heavy weight. It was a long
  search that Armstrong had before he came upon the desired object, but at last
  success crowned his efforts and, with a triumphant shout he laid his hand
  upon the slimy, snake-like weed in a corner of the cave where they had so
  providentially landed. There was enough, and more than enough, for the
  purpose required, as the plant lay very compactly together. Indeed, with time
  and perseverance, they could have made a strand quite a mile in length.</p>

  <p>"Knowledge of any subject is never wasted," Armstrong said cheerfully as
  he groped his way back to Harold's side, trailing the seaweed behind him,
  "and fortunately we both know something of splicing and twisting ropes. Lend
  a hand here, and we'll soon turn out a serviceable hawser a few fathoms long;
  quite enough, as the island that covers us is not very much longer than
  that."</p>

  <p>Only too anxious to do anything to while away the monotony of the blank
  darkness, Harold complied as Armstrong arranged the long fibres to his needs.
  How long they worked it was impossible for either to tell, but, after a
  steady perseverance, Armstrong commenced to measure off the rope yard by yard
  until he had made the discovery that it was ample for the purpose
  required.</p>

  <p>"Now you know what to do," he said as he fastened one end round his waist.
  "By this means if I find no outlet I can easily draw myself back again."</p>

  <p>As Harold made no reply, he plunged into the sea and then there was
  another long spell of weary waiting.</p>

  <p>At one time the rope would be drawn to its utmost limit, and hope would
  begin to agitate Harold's breast only to be dashed an instant later as the
  cord relaxed again. Finally Harold's ears, intensified by the still darkness,
  heard something approaching, and a moment later Armstrong crawled upon the
  ledge, weary, breathless, and thoroughly disappointed.</p>

  <p>"I am utterly puzzled," he said. "I can find no opening, and I dared not
  dive under the obstacles in my way lest I should sever the connection. I
  could not even find such a thing as another ledge to rest upon. It seems as
  if we had escaped one death only to fall into another more&#8212;What is
  that?"</p>

  <p>Armstrong paused, as three quick dropping splashes after another rang in
  his ear. The noises appeared to come from the ledge upon which they lay, and
  for some time Harold had imagined that he had detected several shadowy little
  forms popping in and out of the water.</p>

  <p>"Only rats, I expect," he said gloomily. "Waiting for us probably."</p>

  <p>"More likely to be seals," Armstrong replied, "the small hairless seal
  peculiar to these parts. Yes, that was undoubtedly the sound made by
  them."</p>

  <p>They listened for a moment and, as the place grew still, the sounds came
  again, this time from several parts of the cave. With suppressed excitement
  Armstrong leant over and grasped Harold firmly by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Be silent for a time," he whispered. "I have a plan, and I must have one
  of these little animals to help me. I wonder if I could catch one?"</p>

  <p>Apparently there was nothing easier. As the men lay there the little
  creatures passed quite close to them, and actually ran across their bodies.
  As Armstrong felt one run across his chest his hands closed together with a
  vice-like grip and, despite the bite of the frightened creature, he held on
  tightly.</p>

  <p>"Make a short rope end tie it securely round this little fellow's neck,"
  he said. "Yes, that is what I want, and now let him go. Of course he takes to
  the water naturally. Fasten the long strand round my waist again, I am off on
  another adventure."</p>

  <p>"What wonderful scheme have you got on hand now?" Harold asked.</p>

  <p>"It is merely an experiment. Of course you have seen a dog piloting a
  blind man along a crowded street. Well, this seal is going to be my dog, and
  so far as this place is concerned I am certainly a blind man."</p>

  <p>"But surely you will gain nothing by that," Harold exclaimed as the seal
  that was now attached to Armstrong began to plunge and struggle. "It will
  only be a case of going out with the sole purpose of returning, I fear."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt my guide will try that on at first," Armstrong replied,
  "but when he sees that there is no purpose to serve that way, he will do what
  other hunted animals always do, and make for the open, or at least that is
  what I calculate upon. If I could only find some means of letting him know
  what I wanted, he would take me fast enough. If the cord draws taut with
  three jerks, follow me."</p>

  <p>Again the gallant sailor plunged into the water with the freshness and
  zeal of a young enthusiast. With very little hope, Harold waited minute after
  minute whilst the cord alternately tightened and slackened, until at length
  it drew firm and rigid after three pulls which had the same effect on
  Harold's nerves as if he had received an electric shock.</p>

  <p>"At last!" he said. "I wonder if we are really safe at length?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated no longer, but commenced to follow the rope. For a time it
  lay on the face of the water, but presently it took a decidedly downward
  course, taking Harold under the water till he could no longer keep his head
  above it.</p>

  <p>He swam on and on, deeper and deeper, under the pitchy darkness, till it
  seemed as if he could not hold his breath any longer, and just when he was
  commencing to feel faint and weak he saw that the gloom was breaking. A few
  more strokes and he rose to the surface with the sun shining down upon him,
  and Armstrong's cheery voice ringing in his ears. Nothing tended to
  strengthen nerve and muscle like the sight of that welcome, blessed
  sunshine.</p>

  <p>Armstrong's calculations had been fully verified. The seal, now again
  rejoicing in his accustomed liberty, had made for the open when instinct
  taught it that no chance of escape lay in the caverns.</p>

  <p>As Harold looked around him he saw the myrtles and lemon-trees of Mea
  Culpa lying in front and, peering out of a corner, Don Zalva's
  <i>hacienda</i>. A sense of happiness and gratitude to heaven caused the
  tears to rise to his eyes as he realised how merciful the escape from death
  had been.</p>

  <p>"No more experiments for me," he said with a shudder, "not for ten
  thousand times the treasure there may be concealed here."</p>

  <p>Armstrong made no reply. As they crept along the island towards the shore
  the hardy old mariner's eye did not fail to detect the fact that someone had
  recently been making a thorough investigation of the place. He saw the marks
  of the explosions, where Barrados had been forced to use gunpowder, and when
  he came at length to the grave containing the skeleton and three skulls and
  the rest, excitement fairly got the better of him. Like Harold, he knew the
  cypher by heart and this evidence was sufficient to convince him that
  Barrados had at least made an effort to find the treasure.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he cried, "see how it all points to what the cypher
  indicated. Here are the gravestones which have been mutilated for some
  purpose&#8212;"</p>

  <p>"Barrados." Harold interrupted. "There has been some underhand work
  here."</p>

  <p>"Well, it certainly does look like it," Armstrong admitted. "I cannot see
  why these inscriptions should have been removed unless Barrados wanted to
  keep his discovery to himself. And what is this cord doing here?"</p>

  <p>The speaker pointed to the string which Barrados had used to take his
  straight line from the grave of Vaughan to the three-star mark and which, in
  his excitement, he had forgotten.</p>

  <p>Walking to the end of this guide, Armstrong came upon the piled up mound
  of coral placed by the Spaniard over the place where the treasure had been
  concealed. Hastily removing the stones, the old sailor disclosed the old oak
  chest in which nothing remained now but some ten thousand dollars in
  gold.</p>

  <p>"The treasure!" Harold cried. "But what about the legend which alluded to
  millions instead of thousands? What we have found here would barely
  recompense us for our outlay. It is not more than £1,000 apiece."</p>

  <p>"Not here, but look at the marks on that old chest. Every indication
  points to the fact that until quite recently it must have been crammed with
  treasure. Has Barrados played us false and gone off with the remainder?"</p>

  <p>"Not as long as anything remained," Harold suggested, "unless, indeed, he
  found it impossible to carry any more with him. I must confess I don't like
  the very quiet appearance of things on shore yonder. Depend upon it,
  something is wrong Barrados is not the man to disclose what he has found to
  anyone, and if he thought that he could get safely away&#8212;"</p>

  <p>Harold paused as Armstrong gripped his arm and pointed towards the shore.
  There they saw Barrados coming from the direction of Don Zalva's
  <i>hacienda</i> in company with Paulo, and both of them gesticulating
  violently as they came towards the island.</p>

  <p><a id="pic014" name="pic014"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1402511h-images/TheIslandOfShadows-14.gif" alt="Illustration" title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"I do not like to see those men together and we not armed," Armstrong said
  dryly, "I am going to play the coward for once and hide behind this rock.
  Some instinct tells me that it would not be prudent to disclose our happy
  escape just at this particular moment."</p>

  <p>They had not long to wait, as Barrados and his companion walked straight
  in the direction of the island, and as they come nearer their angry excited
  voices were distinctly carried to the listeners' ears. Presently the Spaniard
  paused directly before the treasure, which Armstrong had hastily covered
  again, and turned savagely upon his companion.</p>

  <p>"You talk like a fool, like a dreamer of dreams," he said with a
  curse.</p>

  <p>"Very likely," Paulo replied more quietly, "but we intend to have more
  than five hundred dollars. Where is the treasure I hear so much of?"</p>

  <p>"Treasure! A paltry ten thousand dollars or so. Who told you of it?"</p>

  <p>"Isidore, though how she knew of it, I cannot say. We are five to one, and
  we mean to have our share. <i>Carramba!</i> are we to kill the old man and
  carry off the girls whilst you get off free and have the lion's share of the
  plunder besides? No, share and share alike."</p>

  <p>"You are under some strange misapprehension," Barrados said, striving to
  speak calmly. "I did not tell you, I should have been foolish to do so, that
  I had found any treasure at all. But I will show it you, and then you can
  determine for yourselves whether I speak the truth or not. Look there."</p>

  <p>He indicated the coral rocks piled over the chest, all of which he
  removed, and when he had done so bade Paulo see for himself. The eyes of the
  assassin sparkled with greed as he dipped his hand in the golden stream, and
  allowed the deep red gold to run like water through his fingers.</p>

  <p>"It is satisfactory," he said with a growl of satisfaction, "and we all
  share alike."</p>

  <p>"So be it, then," Barrados replied with simulated chagrin. "You shall have
  no reason to complain upon that score so long as you get to work, and that
  speedily."</p>

  <p>"It shall be as you wish, since you are willing to pay the price; but if
  you have played us false, if you have kept anything back for yourself, have a
  care, for by Heaven I would shoot you with as little thought as I would a
  dog."</p>

  <p>"Bah! It would be a small dog, then," Barrados replied, "It is easy to
  talk like that when you are as five to one. Have you secured the arms?"</p>

  <p>"I have. Don Zalva has not so much as a pop-gun to protect himself with.
  But we have had talk enough now, and I have much to do. We have already lost
  two days by your prevarication, and I want to be away. A pistol shot will rid
  us of the Don, and an hour later we could be on board with the girls. Have
  you anything more to add to the programme?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Barrados said. "I will return to the <i>hacienda</i> now to see
  that no suspicion has been aroused, and later in the afternoon we can return
  here and convey the treasure to the yacht. We need not say anything."</p>

  <p>"I tell you they all must know," Paolo exclaimed. "You do not know them as
  well as I do. We must be all present when that money is conveyed on board the
  yacht or else we shall have murder done. Once we have got it away, we could
  return to the <i>hacienda</i>, despatch Don Zalva, and carry off the women. I
  have arranged it to the minutest detail."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, I will go up to the <i>hacienda</i> now, and when you
  see me leave, get the others together, when we can come down here and
  transfer the money on board the yacht. I would willingly spare the old man;
  but in that case we should speedily be followed, and dead men tell no
  tales."</p>

  <p>The listeners behind the rocks strained their ears to catch what followed,
  but Paulo's voice had dropped to a whisper. For a few moments the
  conspirators discussed thus, till at length Barrados gave vent to a sinister
  laugh in which triumph was plainly blended with cunning.</p>

  <p>"Enough," he said, "we are merely wasting time here; let us begone."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Paulo replied in his deep tones, "everything is settled. But
  mind, if there has been anything concealed from us&#8212;"</p>

  <p>He said no more, but the pause was more significant than words.</p>
  <hr>
  <a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <p class="first">THE voices and footsteps of the conspirators died away at
  length, and as they plunged into the woods leading towards the
  <i>hacienda</i> Armstrong rose with such a look of grim determination on his
  features as Harold had never seen before. He appeared to be an avenging
  Nemesis.</p>

  <p>"We are all unarmed and in the power of these ruffians," he said slowly.
  "I am the last man in the world to shed blood unnecessarily, but in
  self-defence it is absolutely necessary. I shall be even with them yet.
  Meanwhile, there is no time to lose. You must make your way to the
  <i>hacienda</i> and contrive, unseen by these scoundrels, to warn the inmates
  of their danger."</p>

  <p>"And you?" Harold asked, nothing loth to obey, as he realised the terrible
  position in which his beloved Haidee stood, "had we not better be
  together!"</p>

  <p>"I have something else to do," Armstrong said sternly. "Hark you, Harold,
  it is a question between these ruffians and ourselves. If we do not utterly
  destroy them they will certainly murder us, and that Barrados has a vast
  amount of treasure concealed somewhere. I do not doubt for a moment. If he
  knew we were alive it would be to his interest to get us out of the way
  before the fact of his safety became generally known, therefore it behoves us
  to let our friends know of our whereabouts. Afterwards I shall cope with the
  ruffians."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but how? We are totally unarmed."</p>

  <p>"I know the way, and before night I shall rid the world of five
  scoundrels. My better nature shrinks from the task, but it must be done. And
  now away, as any moment's delay might frustrate my plans."</p>

  <p>Harold asked no further questions, being content to leave matters in the
  hands of one whose head was so much wiser than his own. As he reached the
  shore and crept cautiously towards the woods, Armstrong entered his workshop,
  where the huge mass of gold had been buried by the disappointed Barrados, and
  gave a sigh of relief when he noted that nothing had been tampered with
  during his involuntary absence.</p>

  <p>All the retorts were in their right places, his store of <i>dolomite</i>
  cartridges had not been disarranged, and even the electric batteries were
  intact and in their places. It was all that he wanted to find. There was
  nothing needed to complete his plain of retaliation.</p>

  <p>"Only just in the nick of time," he muttered, "and now to surprise the
  rascals who have counted so much upon our deaths."</p>

  <p>It was a long, tedious journey for Harold, and one fraught with many
  dangers. He knew that once he betrayed himself by his presence his life would
  not be worth a moment's purchase, unarmed as he was, and especially as his
  reappearance meant so much to the disadvantage of the conspirators. With his
  lantern face and bald, shining head, where the down was just commencing to
  appear again, he looked a curious figure as he crept through the myrtle and
  mimosa bushes that grew close up to the <i>hacienda</i>.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">FROM his hiding-place he could see the servants going about
  as if nothing particular were about to happen. He saw Don Zalva, a little
  more pale and anxious-looking than usual, smoking his cigarette on the
  balcony, and Harold's heart gave a leap as he saw Haidee looking thin and
  careworn, as she leant over his chair with loving solicitude. He could almost
  catch their words.</p>

  <p>Presently Haidee retired and Don Zalva commenced to pace the balcony with
  hurried and impatient strides. He descended to the open patch of green below,
  and after a time skirted round till Harold could have touched him.</p>

  <p>"Hist!" Harold said cautiously. "Do not say anything to attract attention.
  Walk round again and when you reach this spot once more, pretend to be
  interested in something. Don't you recognise my voice, Don Zalva?"</p>

  <p>"If I do it is a voice from the grave," Don Zalva said quietly, though
  with a violent start. "But tell me one thing. Are you both saved?"</p>

  <p>As Harold replied in the affirmative Don Zalva strode on with the same
  listless air but inward he was in a state of painfully-suppressed excitement.
  Twice did he pass the spot where Harold was concealed before he could control
  himself sufficiently to feign interest in something on the ground, whilst in
  a few hurried whispers Harold explained the adventures which had happened to himself and
  Armstrong.</p>

  <p>"But it does not in the least matter about us," he said. There is danger
  threatening you quite equal to anything that we have gone through. There is a
  plot afoot amongst Paulo and his rascally companions to murder you this very
  afternoon and carry your daughter away.</p>

  <p>"I knew it, but I did not expect it would be quite so soon," Don Zalva
  replied in tones of resignation. "But, like you, we are utterly unarmed and
  powerless unless that wonderful Armstrong can hit upon some plan for the
  destruction of the villains. Did he suggest anything?"</p>

  <p>"There was no time, as he wanted to commence at once to lay out his plans
  for compassing the rascals, which will probably be attempted when they go
  down in a body this afternoon to remove the treasure from the island."</p>

  <p>"Which is already done. I have seen it with my own eyes, an enormous mass
  of gold and jewels which must be equal to at least £2,000,000 of your English
  money."</p>

  <p>"Then Barrados must have deceived his 'confederates," Harold exclaimed, as
  Don Zalva hastily explained what had taken place with Haidee's
  assistance.</p>

  <p>"But there is a part of it remaining on the island and it is intended to
  fetch it this afternoon. The bulk will probably be hidden till Barrados can
  find a safe opportunity of coming here and conveying it away. But it was well
  done on your part."</p>

  <p>"It was absolutely necessary," Don Zalva said. "And now what is to be
  done?"</p>

  <p>"Remain where you are and keep a careful watch on the ruffians," Harold
  suggested. "If you note that they all leave at the same time, you will know
  that the arrangement as to fetching the treasure from the island holds good,
  and then you can follow them and watch the result of Armstrong's experiment,
  whatever it may be. Even if it fails, we could all reach the <i>hacienda</i>
  and barricade ourselves in before the rascals discovered our presence. But I
  have great faith in Armstrong."</p>

  <p>"As I have myself," Don Zalva exclaimed. "Surely Providence must have sent
  that marvellous man back for our protection. It is something to hear that I
  am not quite alone in the hour of danger."</p>

  <p>"Then you will follow the rascals at a safe distance," Harold replied.
  "Meanwhile I shall remain here and watch, and directly they have started,
  join you in the <i>hacienda</i>. You had better return to it now, as you do
  not know what manner of suspicion you may be arousing by your absence."</p>

  <p>Don Zalva took the hint and retired. By this time Harold had heard
  everything, even down to the dastardly attack upon Larry, whose presence in
  the <i>hacienda</i>, thanks to Isidore's caution, had not been made known to
  the conspirators. There was a new elasticity to the Don's step and a
  brightness in his eyes that aroused the suspicions of Paulo, who watched him
  closely.</p>

  <p>"Ah, we shall change all that presently," he said between his teeth, "and
  shall wash out many a slight and insult at the same time. And as for Isidore,
  I shall find some way to tame her spirit yet."</p>

  <p>Slowly the time crept on towards the afternoon, and then Don Zalva noticed
  that the ruffians gradually drew together in one corner of the green sward
  before the <i>hacienda</i>, where they appeared to be deeply discussing some
  matter much more important than the dominoes upon which they were ostensibly
  engaged.</p>

  <p>After a little dramatic display, for your Mexican does nothing without a
  motive, they rose one at a time, as if they had mutually decided to abandon
  an unpleasant game, and one by one lounged off in the direction of the
  shore.</p>

  <p>Scarcely were they all out of sight before Harold rose from his
  uncomfortable position, and rapidly crossed to the balcony of the
  <i>hacienda</i>. There was a broken cry of pleasure as a graceful figure rose
  from a dusky corner and came forward with outstretched hands.</p>

  <p>"Father told me of your marvellous escape," Haidee cried, for it was she.
  "Oh how glad add thankful I am! Heaven be thanked that you are here!"</p>

  <p>Despite the peculiar appearance that Harold presented, Haidee's bright
  eyes regarded him with a loving look that there was no mistaking. He took the
  little hands in his, and bent over till his lips touched her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Would it have mattered so very much if I had been lost altogether, little
  one?" he asked tenderly. "I thought of you, but I did not dare to
  hope&#8212;'</p>

  <p>"You did; you <i>knew</i>!" Haidee said laughing and crying in a breath.
  "Harold, you knew that all the world to me was nothing unless I had you."</p>

  <p>Harold looked into the beautiful flushed face, all aglow with love and
  tenderness. Then he took her in his arms, where she lay quiet and
  contented.</p>

  <p>"We have not passed beyond all danger yet," he said, "but if we can tide
  over this, will you give me the right to shield and guard you always?"</p>

  <p>The light that flashed in Haidee's eyes was enough. But further tender
  passages were cut short by the abrupt appearance of Don Zalva with an
  intimation that it would be as well to follow the miscreants to the
  shore.</p>

  <p>"No, you must remain here. O'Brady and Isidore will be sufficient
  protection until we return," he said, as Haidee pleaded to be permitted to
  accompany them.</p>

  <p>"When we come back again you will know your fate."</p>

  <p>Pressing Haidee's hand once more, and bidding her to be of good cheer,
  Harold followed his host into the belt of trees that sheltered the
  <i>hacienda</i> from the beach. Apparently everything had transpired as
  Armstrong had expected, and as soon as the companions emerged into the open
  they saw the five conspirators on the island, bending down and looking
  intently at the spot where the treasure had lain buried.</p>

  <p>They crept along, keeping the workshop between them and the five
  desperadoes. Not that they had any occasion for precaution, as the ruffians
  were too deeply engaged in their enthralling conversation. At the moment that
  Don Zalva and his companion reached the workshop, the door opened and
  Armstrong appeared. He seemed to have no fear of being seen, for he strode
  towards the island which, it will be remembered, had practically become part
  of the main shore, and without a moment's hesitation bailed the ruffians, who
  were scarcely a hundred yards away.</p>

  <p>"Barrados," he cried with a voice like an avenging spirit. "Barrados, what
  have you done with what belonged by every right to us?"</p>

  <p>AS if a bullet had struck him, Barrados bounded to his feet, and turned in
  the direction of the speaker, his face white and ghastly. A curse broke from
  the rest of the gang, who were prepared, now that their greed had been fired
  by a sight of the treasure, to repel opposition by fair or foul means.</p>

  <p>"Keep back," Barrados returned hoarsely, "keep back, unless you wish to be
  sent back to the grave from which you have returned."</p>

  <p>"Make a rush for them," Paulo suggested as he caught sight of Don Zalva
  and Harold. "They are unarmed, and it must be done sooner or later."</p>

  <p>Every word was distinctly audible, in the thin dry air, to the little
  group standing on the sand. Quick as thought, Armstrong laid his hand upon
  switch to which was attached an electric motor, a pretty toy enough, big
  absolutely deadly in the hands of a man of someone like himself.</p>

  <p>"Be warned in time." he said with great sternness. "Were I only to press
  my finger upon the tiny disc under my hand you would be all blown into
  eternity. Providentially, we heard you this morning, and in our own defence
  laid the mine that is now under your foot. It is for us to make terms."</p>

  <p>"He lies," Paulo growled, seeing for effect of the speaker's words upon
  his less bold companions. "Let us make a dash forward, and&#8212;"</p>

  <p>He said no more, but darted forward. As he did so the others, inspired by
  his action, made a rush, Barrados merely standing and covering his face with
  his hands, as if to close out some awful mental vision.</p>

  <p>"They <i>will</i> have it," Armstrong muttered. "After all, it is
  fated so to be."</p>

  <p>The smallest pressure, the infinitesimal downward motion of the tiny disc,
  scarcely more than a puff of wind might have done, and along the wire the
  electric spark ran on its swift message of death.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>It seemed to the spectators like some rapid optical illusion: one moment
  they were watching the ruffians racing forward over the rocks, and the next
  instant of time and the island was absolutely no more. <i>It had absolutely
  gone</i>. There was a tremendous reverberation, a rushing wind that carried
  the onlookers off their feet, a shower of stones and fragments of rock, a
  tremendous inrushing sea, and then all was over.</p>

  <p>Armstrong's plan of vengeance had been awfully successful and the little
  party were free.</p>

  <p>"There was no alternative," Armstrong said as he came forward and shook
  hands with Don Zalva. "But those rascals are not worth another thought. But I
  am sorry if I have been compelled to destroy all the treasure."</p>

  <p>For answer Don Zalva led the way to the workroom, where a great pile of
  earth told him that the huge mass of gold lay buried. A hasty examination
  disclosed the glittering nugget, absolutely studded with precious stones, and
  then in a few words Don Zalva told the whole story.</p>

  <p>"I can soon alter all that," Armstrong said. "I can easily fuse it out
  again and convert it into small bars. As to the precious stones, they will
  not hurt at all. And now, my boy," the speaker concluded, cheerfully, "you
  cannot deny that what lies there before you was worth all the risk."</p>

  <p>Harold smiled. The gold in itself was nothing, but the treasure in
  conjunction with Haidee's love was certainly worth everything. He had gained
  something which, after all, was worth far more than Amyas Coventry's
  millions.</p>

  <p><br>
  THERE is a beautiful house in the shire of broad acres where Harold Coventry
  lives with his charming Mexican wife. Society has taken kindly to her
  southern loveliness, and society pronounces Don Zalva to be the model of a
  gentleman. For the Don has sold his property, and prefers to live in England
  which, if gloomier, is much safer than his native land.</p>

  <p>Larry, who prefers to remain near his old friends, is comfortably settled
  in one of the Coventry Hall lodges where he fights his battles over again for
  the benefit of his admirers, whilst Isidore is bright and coquettish as of
  yore.</p>

  <p>Last, but by no means least, Armstrong, who strenuously refuses to accept
  more then £20,000 of the treasure, lives in a marvellous house hard by where
  he conducts all kinds of weird experiments. The spirit of adventure it still
  strong upon him, and he hopes to revisit the land of the Astrans again when
  his experiments are complete. Some day we may have something more to tell of
  the doings of the marvellous wizard known as Captain Armstrong.</p>
