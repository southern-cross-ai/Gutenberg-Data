<h2><a id="canaan1" name="canaan1">1. CALL FROM CANAAN</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">"TROUBLE on Tularoosa Creek!" A warning to
send cold fear along the spine of any man who was raised in that
isolated back-country, called Canaan, that lies between Tularoosa
and Black River&mdash;to send him racing back to that
swamp-bordered region, wherever the word might reach him.</p>

<p>It was only a whisper from the withered lips of a shuffling
black crone, who vanished among the throng before I could seize
her; but it was enough. No need to seek confirmation; no need to
inquire by what mysterious, black-folk way the word had come to
her. No need to inquire what obscure forces worked to unseal those
wrinkled lips to a Black River man. It was enough that the warning
had been given&mdash;and understood.</p>

<p>Understood? How could any Black River man fail to understand
that warning? It could have but one meaning&mdash;old hates
seething again in the jungle-deeps of the swamplands, dark shadows
slipping through the cypress, and massacre stalking out of the
black, mysterious village that broods on the moss-festooned shore
of sullen Tularoosa.</p>

<p>Within an hour New Orleans was falling further behind me with
every turn of the churning wheel. To every man born in Canaan,
there is always an invisible tie that draws him back whenever his
homeland is imperiled by the murky shadow that has lurked in its
jungled recesses for more than half a century.</p>

<p>The fastest boats I could get seemed maddeningly slow for that
race up the big river, and up the smaller, more turbulent stream. I
was burning with impatience when I stepped off on the Sharpsville
landing, with the last fifteen miles of my journey yet to make. It
was past midnight, but I hurried to the livery stable where, by
tradition half a century old, there is always a Buckner horse, day
or night.</p>

<p>As a sleepy black boy fastened the cinches, I turned to the
owner of the stable, Joe Lafely, yawning and gaping in the light of
the lantern he upheld. "There are rumors of trouble on
Tularoosa?"</p>

<p>He paled in the lantern-light.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I've heard talk. But you people in Canaan are a
shut-mouthed clan. No one <i>outside</i> knows what goes on in
there&mdash;"</p>

<p>The night swallowed his lantern and his stammering voice as I
headed west along the pike.</p>

<p>The moon set red through the black pines. Owls hooted away off
in the woods, and somewhere a hound howled his ancient wistfulness
to the night. In the darkness that foreruns dawn I crossed Nigger
Head Creek, a streak of shining black fringed by walls of solid
shadows. My horse's hooves splashed through the shallow water and
clinked on the wet stones, startlingly loud in the stillness.
Behind Nigger Head Creek began the country men called Canaan.</p>

<p>Heading in the same swamp, miles to the north, that gives birth
to Tularoosa, Nigger Head flows due south to join Black River a few
miles west of Sharpsville, while the Tularoosa runs westward to
meet the same river at a higher point. The trend of Black River is
from northwest to southeast; so these three streams form the great
irregular triangle known as Canaan.</p>

<p>In Canaan lived the sons and daughters of the white frontiersmen
who first settled the country, and the sons and daughters of their
slaves. Joe Lafely was right; we were an isolated, shut-mouthed
breed. Self-sufficient, jealous of our seclusion and
independence.</p>

<p>Beyond Nigger Head the woods thickened, the road narrowed,
winding through unfenced pinelands, broken by live-oaks and
cypresses. There was no sound except the soft clop-clop of hoofs in
the thin dust, the creak of the saddle. Then someone laughed
throatily in the shadows.</p>

<p>I drew up and peered into the trees. The moon had set and dawn
was not yet come, but a faint glow quivered among the trees, and by
it I made out a dim figure under the moss-hung branches. My hand
instinctively sought the butt of one of the dueling-pistols I wore,
and the action brought another low, musical laugh, mocking yet
seductive. I glimpsed a brown face, a pair of scintillant eyes,
white teeth displayed in an insolent smile.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Why do you ride so late, Kirby Buckner?" Taunting laughter
bubbled in the voice. The accent was foreign and unfamiliar; a
faintly negroid twang was there, but it was rich and sensuous as
the rounded body of its owner. In the lustrous pile of dusky hair a
great white blossom glimmered palely in the darkness.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" I demanded. "You're a long way from
any darky cabin. And you're a stranger to me."</p>

<p>"I came to Canaan since you went away," she answered. "My cabin
is on the Tularoosa. But now I've lost my way. And my poor brother
has hurt his leg and cannot walk."</p>

<p>"Where is your brother?" I asked, uneasily. Her perfect English
was disquieting to me, accustomed as I was to the dialect of the
black folk.</p>

<p>"Back in the woods, there&mdash;far back!" She indicated the
black depths with a swaying motion of her supple body rather than a
gesture of her hand, smiling audaciously as she did so.</p>

<p>I knew there was no injured brother, and she knew I knew it, and
laughed at me. But a strange turmoil of conflicting emotions
stirred in me. I had never before paid any attention to a black or
brown woman. But this quadroon girl was different from any I had
ever seen. Her features were regular as a white woman's, and her
speech was not that of a common wench. Yet she was barbaric, in the
open lure of her smile, in the gleam of her eyes, in the shameless
posturing of her voluptuous body. Every gesture, every motion she
made set her apart from the ordinary run of women; her beauty was
untamed and lawless, meant to madden rather than to soothe, to make
a man blind and dizzy, to rouse in him all the unreined passions
that are his heritage from his ape ancestors.</p>

<p>I hardly remember dismounting and tying my horse. My blood
pounded suffocatingly through the veins in my temples as I scowled
down at her, suspicious yet fascinated.</p>

<p>"How do you know my name? Who <i>are</i> you?"</p>

<p>With a provocative laugh, she seized my hand and drew me deeper
into the shadows. Fascinated by the lights gleaming in her dark
eyes, I was hardly aware of her action.</p>

<p>"Who does not know Kirby Buckner?" she laughed. "All the people
of Canaan speak of you, white or black. Come! My poor brother longs
to look upon you!" And she laughed with malicious triumph.</p>

<p>It was this brazen effrontery that brought me to my senses. Its
cynical mockery broke the almost hypnotic spell in which I had
fallen.</p>

<p>I stopped short, throwing her hand aside, snarling: "What
devil's game are you up to, wench?"</p>

<p>Instantly the smiling siren was changed to a blood-mad jungle
cat. Her eyes flamed murderously, her red lips writhed in a snarl
as she leaped back, crying out shrilly. A rush of bare feet
answered her call. The first faint light of dawn struck through the
branches, revealing my assailants, three gaunt black giants. I saw
the gleaming whites of their eyes, their bare glistening teeth, the
sheen of naked steel in their hands.</p>

<p>My first bullet crashed through the head of the tallest man,
knocking him dead in full stride. My second pistol
snapped&mdash;the cap had somehow slipped from the nipple. I dashed
it into a black face, and as the man fell, half stunned, I whipped
out my bowie knife and closed with the other. I parried his stab
and my counter-stroke ripped across the belly-muscles. He screamed
like a swamp-panther and made a wild grab for my knife wrist, but I
stuck him in the mouth with my clenched left fist, and felt his
lips split and his teeth crumble under the impact as he reeled
backward, his knife waving wildly. Before he could regain his
balance I was after him, thrusting, and got home under his ribs. He
groaned and slipped to the ground in a puddle of his own blood.</p>

<p>I wheeled about, looking for the other. He was just rising,
blood streaming down his face and neck. As I started for him he
sounded a panicky yell and plunged into the underbrush. The
crashing of his blind flight came back to me, muffled with
distance. The girl was gone.</p>

<h2><a id="canaan2" name="canaan2">2. THE STRANGER ON TULAROOSA</a>
</h2>

<p style="text-indent:0">THE CURIOUS GLOW that had first showed me
the quadroon girl had vanished. In my confusion I had forgotten it.
But I did not waste time on vain conjecture as to its source, as I
groped my way back to the road. Mystery had come to the pinelands
and a ghostly light that hovered among the trees was only part of
it.</p>

<p>My horse snorted and pulled against his tether, frightened by
the smell of blood that hung in the heavy damp air. Hoofs clattered
down the road, forms bulked in the growing light. Voices
challenged.</p>

<p>"Who's that? Step out and name yourself, before we shoot!"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Esau!" I called. "It's me&mdash;Kirby Buckner!"</p>

<p>"Kirby Buckner, by thunder!" ejaculated Esau McBride, lowering
his pistol. The tall rangy forms of the other riders loomed behind
him.</p>

<p>"We heard a shot," said McBride. "We was ridin' patrol on the
roads around Grimesville like we've been ridin' every night for a
week now&mdash;ever since they killed Ridge Jackson."</p>

<p>"Who killed Ridge Jackson?"</p>

<p>"The swamp niggers. That's all we know. Ridge come out of the
woods early one mornin' and knocked at Cap'n Sorley's door. Cap'n
says he was the color of ashes. He hollered for the Cap'n for God's
sake to let him in, he had somethin' awful to tell him. Well, the
Cap'n started down to open the door, but before he'd got down the
stairs he heard an awful row among the dogs outside, and a man
screamed he reckoned was Ridge. And when he got to the door, there
wasn't nothin' but a dead dog layin' in the yard with his head
knocked in, and the others all goin' crazy. They found Ridge later,
out in the pines a few hundred yards from the house. From the way
the ground and the bushes was tore up, he'd been dragged that far
by four or five men. Maybe they got tired of haulin' him along.
Anyway, they beat his head into a pulp and left him layin'
there."</p>

<p>"I'll be damned!" I muttered. "Well, there's a couple of niggers
lying back there in the brush. I want to see if you know them. I
don't."</p>

<p>A moment later we were standing in the tiny glade, now white in
the growing dawn. A black shape sprawled on the matted pine
needles, his head in a pool of blood and brains. There were wide
smears of blood on the ground and bushes on the other side of the
little clearing, but the wounded black was gone.</p>

<p>McBride turned the carcass with his foot.</p>

<p>"One of them niggers that came in with Saul Stark," he
muttered.</p>

<p>"Who the devil's that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Strange nigger that moved in since you went down the river last
time. Come from South Carolina, he says. Lives in that old cabin in
the Neck&mdash;you know, the shack where Colonel Reynolds' niggers
used to live."</p>

<p>"Suppose you ride on to Grimesville with me, Esau," I said, "and
tell me about this business as we ride. The rest of you might scout
around and see if you can find a wounded nigger in the brush."</p>

<p>They agreed without question; the Buckners have always been
tacitly considered leaders in Canaan, and it came natural for me to
offer suggestions. Nobody gives <i>orders</i> to white men in
Canaan.</p>

<p>"I reckoned you'd be showin' up soon," opined McBride, as we
rode along the whitening road. "You usually manage to keep up with
what's happenin' in Canaan."</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> happening?" I inquired. "I don't know anything.
An old black woman dropped me the word in New Orleans that there
was trouble. Naturally I came home as fast as I could. Three
strange niggers waylaid me&mdash;" I was curiously disinclined to
mention the woman. "And now you tell me somebody killed Ridge
Jackson. What's it all about?"</p>

<p>"The swamp niggers killed Ridge to shut his mouth," announced
McBride. "That's the only way to figure it. They must have been
close behind him when he knocked on Cap'n Sorley's door. Ridge
worked for Cap'n Sorley most of his life; he thought a lot of the
old man. Some kind of deviltry's bein' brewed up in the swamps, and
Ridge wanted to warn the Cap'n. That's the way I figure it."</p>

<p>"Warn him about what?"</p>

<p>"We don't know," confessed McBride. "That's why we're all on
edge. It must be an uprisin'."</p>

<p>That word was enough to strike chill fear into the heart of any
Canaan-dweller. The blacks had risen in 1845, and the red terror of
that revolt was not forgotten, nor the three lesser rebellions
before it, when the slaves rose and spread fire and slaughter from
Tularoosa to the shores of Black River. The fear of a black
uprising lurked for ever in the depths of that forgotten
back-country; the very children absorbed it in their cradles.</p>

<p>"What makes you think it might be an uprising?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The niggers have all quit the fields, for one thing. They've
all got business in Goshen. I ain't seen a nigger nigh Grimesville
for a week. <i>The town niggers have pulled out.</i></p>

<p>"In Canaan we still draw a distinction born in antebellum days.
'Town niggers' are descendants of the house-servants of the old
days, and most of them live in or near Grimesville. There are not
many, compared to the mass of 'swamp niggers' who dwell on tiny
farms along the creeks and the edge of the swamps, or in the black
village of Goshen, on the Tularoosa. They are descendants of the
field-hands of other days, and, untouched by the mellow
civilization which refined the natures of the house-servants, they
remain as primitive as their African ancestors."</p>

<p>"Where have the town niggers gone?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody knows. They lit out a week ago. Probably hidin' down on
Black River. If we win, they'll come back. If we don't, they'll
take refuge in Sharpsville."</p>

<p>I found his matter-of-factness a bit ghastly, as if the
actuality of the uprising were an assured fact.</p>

<p>"Well, what have you done?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Ain't much we could do," he confessed. "The niggers ain't made
no open move, outside of killin' Ridge Jackson; and we couldn't
prove who done that, or why they done it.</p>

<p>"They ain't done nothin' but clear out. But that's mighty
suspicious. We can't keep from thinkin' Saul Stark's behind
it."</p>

<p>"Who is this fellow?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I told you all I know, already. He got permission to settle in
that old deserted cabin on the Neck; a great big black devil that
talks better English than I like to hear a nigger talk. But he was
respectful enough. He had three or four big South Carolina bucks
with him, and a brown wench which we don't know whether she's his
daughter, sister, wife or What. He ain't been in to Grimesville but
that one time, and a few weeks after he came to Canaan, the niggers
begun actin' curious. Some of the boys wanted to ride over to
Goshen and have a show-down, but that's takin' a desperate
chance."</p>

<p>I knew he was thinking of a ghastly tale told us by our
grandfathers of how a punitive expedition from Grimesville was once
ambushed and butchered among the dense thickets that masked Goshen,
then a rendezvous for runaway slaves, while another red-handed band
devastated Grimesville, left defenseless by that reckless
invasion.</p>

<p>"Might take all the men to get Saul Stark," said McBride. "And
we don't dare leave the town unprotected. But we'll soon have
to&mdash;hello, what's this?"</p>

<p>We had emerged from the trees and were just entering the village
of Grimesville, the community center of the white population of
Canaan. It was not pretentious. Log cabins, neat and whitewashed,
were plentiful enough. Small cottages clustered about big,
old-fashioned houses which sheltered the rude aristocracy of that
backwoods democracy. All the "planter" families lived "in town."
"The country" was occupied by their tenants, and by the small
independent farmers, white and black.</p>

<p>A small log cabin stood near the point where the road wound out
of the deep forest. Voices emanated from it, in accents of menace,
and a tall lanky figure, rifle in hand, stood at the door.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Esau!" this man hailed us. "By golly, if it ain't Kirby
Buckner! Glad to see you, Kirby."</p>

<p>"What's up, Dick?" asked McBride.</p>

<p>"Got a nigger in the shack, tryin' to make him talk. Bill
Reynolds seen him sneakin' past the edge of town about daylight,
and nabbed him."</p>

<p>"Who is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Tope Sorley. John Willoughby's gone after a blacksnake."</p>

<p>With a smothered oath I swung off my horse and strode in,
followed by McBride. Half a dozen men in boots and gunbelts
clustered about a pathetic figure cowering on an old broken bunk.
Tope Sorley (his forebears had adopted the name of the family that
owned them, in slave days) was a pitiable sight just then. His skin
was ashy, his teeth chattered spasmodically, and his eyes seemed to
be trying to roll back into his head.</p>

<p>"Here's Kirby!" ejaculated one of the men as I pushed my way
through the group. "I'll bet he'll make this coon talk!"</p>

<p>"Here comes John with the blacksnake!" shouted someone, and a
tremor ran through Tope Sorley's shivering body.</p>

<p>I pushed aside the butt of the ugly whip thrust eagerly into my
hand.</p>

<p>"Tope," I said, "you've worked one of my father's farms for
years. Has any Buckner ever treated you any way but square?"</p>

<p>"Nossuh," came faintly.</p>

<p>"Then what are you afraid of? Why don't you speak up?
Something's going on in the swamps. You know, and I want you to
tell us why the town niggers have all run away, why Ridge Jackson
was killed, why the swamp niggers are acting so mysteriously."</p>

<p>"And what kind of devilment that cussed Saul Stark's cookin' up
over on Tularoosa!" shouted one of the men.</p>

<p>Tope seemed to shrink into himself at the mention of Stark.</p>

<p>"I don't dast," he shuddered. "He'd put me in de swamp!"</p>

<p>"Who?" I demanded. "Stark? Is Stark a conjer man?"</p>

<p>Tope sank his head in his hands and did not answer. I laid my
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Tope," I said, "you know if you'll talk, we'll protect you. If
you don't talk, I don't think Stark can treat you much rougher than
these men are likely to. Now spill it&mdash;what's it all
about?"</p>

<p>He lifted desperate eyes.</p>

<p>"You-all got to lemme stay here," he shuddered. "And guard me,
and gimme money to git away on when de trouble's over."</p>

<p>"We'll do all that," I agreed instantly. "You can stay right
here in this cabin, until you're ready to leave for New Orleans or
wherever you want to go."</p>

<p>He capitulated, collapsed, and words tumbled from his livid
lips.</p>

<p>"Saul Stark's a conjer man. He come here because it's way off in
back-country. He aim to kill all de white folks in
Canaan&mdash;"</p>

<p>A growl rose from the group, such a growl as rises unbidden from
the throat of the wolf-pack that scents peril.</p>

<p>"He aim to make hisself king of Canaan. He sent me to spy dis
mornin' to see if Mistah Kirby got through. He sent men to waylay
him on de road, cause he knowed Mistah Kirby was comin' back to
Canaan. Niggers makin' voodoo on Tularoosa, for weeks now. Ridge
Jackson was goin' to tell Cap'n Sorley; so Stark's niggers foller
him and kill him. That make Stark mad. He ain't want to <i>kill</i>
Ridge; he want to put him in de swamp with Tunk Bixby and de
others."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" I demanded.</p>

<p>Far out in the woods rose a strange, shrill cry, like the cry of
a bird. But no such bird ever called before in Canaan. Tope cried
out as if in answer, and shriveled into himself. He sank down on
the bunk in a veritable palsy of fear.</p>

<p>"That was a signal!" I snapped. "Some of you go out there."</p>

<p>Half a dozen men hastened to follow my suggestion, and I
returned to the task of making Tope renew his revelations. It was
useless. Some hideous fear had sealed his lips. He lay shuddering
like a stricken animal, and did not even seem to hear our
questions. No one suggested the use of the blacksnake. Anyone could
see the Negro was paralyzed with terror.</p>

<p>Presently the searchers returned empty-handed. They had seen no
one, and the thick carpet of pine needles showed no foot-prints.
The men looked at me expectantly. As Colonel Buckner's son,
leadership was expected of me.</p>

<p>"What about it, Kirby?" asked McBride. "Breckinridge and the
others have just rode in. They couldn't find that nigger you cut
up."</p>

<p>"There was another nigger I hit with a pistol," I said. "Maybe
he came back and helped him." Still I could not bring myself to
mention the brown girl. "Leave Tope alone. Maybe he'll get over his
scare after a while. Better keep a guard in the cabin all the time.
The swamp niggers may try to get him as they got Ridge Jackson.
Better scour the roads around the town, Esau; there may be some of
them hiding in the woods."</p>

<p>"I will. I reckon you'll want to be gettin' up to the house,
now, and seein' your folks."</p>

<p>"Yes. And I want to swap these toys for a couple of .44s. Then
I'm going to ride out and tell the country people to come into
Grimesville. If it's to be an uprising, we don't know when it will
commence."</p>

<p>"You're not goin' alone!" protested McBride.</p>

<p>"I'll be all right," I answered impatiently. "All this may not
amount to anything, but it's best to be on the safe side. That's
why I'm going after the country folks. No, I don't want anybody to
go with me. Just in case the niggers do get crazy enough to attack
the town, you'll need every man you've got. But if I can get hold
of some of the swamp niggers and talk to them, I don't think
there'll be any attack."</p>

<p>"You won't get a glimpse of them," McBride predicted.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="canaan3" name="canaan3">3. SHADOWS OVER CANAAN</a>
</h2>

<p>It was not yet noon when I rode out of the village westward
along the old road. Thick woods swallowed me quickly. Dense walls
of pines marched with me on either hand, giving way occasionally to
fields enclosed with straggling rail fences, with the log cabins of
the tenants or owners close by, with the usual litters of
tow-headed children and lank hound dogs.</p>

<p>Some of the cabins were empty. The occupants, if white, had
already gone into Grimesville; if black they had gone into the
swamps, or fled to the hidden refuge of the town niggers, according
to their affiliations. In any event, the vacancy of their hovels
was sinister in its suggestion.</p>

<p>A tense silence brooded over the pinelands, broken only by the
occasional wailing call of a plowman. My progress was not swift,
for from time to time I turned off the main road to give warning to
some lonely cabin huddled on the bank of one of the many
thicket-fringed creeks. Most of these farms were south of the road;
the white settlements did not extend far to the north; for in that
direction lay Tularoosa Creek with its jungle-grown marshes that
stretched inlets southward like groping fingers.</p>

<p>The actual warning was brief; there was no need to argue or
explain. I called from the saddle: "Get into town; trouble's
brewing on Tularoosa." Faces paled, and people dropped whatever
they were doing: the men to grab guns and jerk mules from the plow
to hitch to the wagons, the women to bundle necessary belongings
together and shrill the children in from their play. As I rode I
heard the cowhorns blowing up and down the creeks, summoning men
from distant fields&mdash;blowing as they had not blown for a
generation, a warning and a defiance which I knew carried to such
ears as might be listening in the edges of the swamplands. The
country emptied itself behind me, flowing in thin but steady
streams toward Grimesville.</p>

<p>The sun was swinging low among the topmost branches of the pines
when I reached the Richardson cabin, the westernmost "white" cabin
in Canaan. Beyond it lay the Neck, the angle formed by the junction
of Tularoosa with Black River, a jungle-like expanse occupied only
by scattered Negro huts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Richardson called to me anxiously from the cabin stoop.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Kirby, I'm glad to see you back in Canaan! We been
hearin' the horns all evenin', Mr. Kirby. What's it mean?
It&mdash;it ain't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You and Joe better get the children and light out for
Grimesville," I answered. "Nothing's happened yet, and may not, but
it's best to be on the safe side. All the people are going."</p>

<p>"We'll go right now!" she gasped, paling, as she snatched off
her apron. "Lord, Mr. Kirby, you reckon they'll cut us off before
we can git to town?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "They'll strike at night, if at all. We're just
playing safe. Probably nothing will come of it."</p>

<p>"I bet you're wrong there," she predicted, scurrying about in
desperate activity. "I been hearin' a drum beatin' off toward Saul
Stark's cabin, off and on, for a week now. They beat drums back in
the Big Uprisin'. My pappy's told me about it many's the time. The
nigger skinned his brother alive. The horns was blowin' all up and
down the creeks, and the drums was beatin' louder'n the horns could
blow. You'll be ridin' back with us, won't you, Mr. Kirby?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm going to scout down along the trail a piece."</p>

<p>"Don't go too far. You're liable to run into old Saul Stark and
his devils. Lord! Where is that man? Joe! <i>Joe!</i>"</p>

<p>As I rode down the trail her shrill voice followed me,
thin-edged with fear.</p>

<p>Beyond the Richardson farm pines gave way to live-oaks. The
underbrush grew ranker. A scent of rotting vegetation impregnated
the fitful breeze. Occasionally I sighted a nigger hut, half hidden
under the trees, but always it stood silent and deserted. Empty
nigger cabins meant but one thing: the blacks were collecting at
Goshen, some miles to the east on the Tularoosa; and that
gathering, too, could have but one meaning.</p>

<p>My goal was Saul Stark's hut. My intention had been formed when
I heard Tope Sorley's incoherent tale. There could be no doubt that
Saul Stark was the dominant figure in this web of mystery. With
Saul Stark I meant to deal. That I might be risking my life was a
chance any man must take who assumes the responsibility of
leadership.</p>

<p>The sun slanted through the lower branches of the cypresses when
I reached it&mdash;a log cabin set against a background of gloomy
tropical jungle. A few steps beyond it began the uninhabitable
swamp in which Tularoosa emptied its murky current into Black
River. A reek of decay hung in the air; gray moss bearded the
trees, and poisonous vines twisted in rank tangles.</p>

<p>I called: "Stark! Saul Stark! Come out here!"</p>

<p>There was no answer. A primitive silence hovered over the tiny
clearing. I dismounted, tied my horse and approached the crude,
heavy door. Perhaps this cabin held a clue to the mystery of Saul
Stark; at least it doubtless contained the implements and
paraphernalia of his noisome craft. The faint breeze dropped
suddenly. The stillness became so intense it was like a physical
impact. I paused, startled; it was as if some inner instinct had
shouted urgent warning.</p>

<p>As I stood there every fiber of me quivered in response to that
subconscious warning; some obscure, deep-hidden instinct sensed
peril, as a man senses the presence of the rattlesnake in the
darkness, or the swamp panther crouching in the bushes. I drew a
pistol, sweeping the trees and bushes, but saw no shadow or
movement to betray the ambush I feared. But my instinct was
unerring; what I sensed was not lurking in the woods about me; it
was inside the cabin&mdash;<i>waiting</i>. Trying to shake off the
feeling, and irked by a vague half-memory that kept twitching at
the back of my brain, I again advanced. And again I stopped short,
with one foot on the tiny stoop, and a hand half advanced to pull
open the door. A chill shivering swept over me, a sensation like
that which shakes a man to whom a flicker of lightning has revealed
the black abyss into which another blind step would have hurled
him. For the first time in my life I knew the meaning of fear; I
knew that black horror lurked in that sullen cabin under the
moss-bearded cypresses&mdash;a horror against which every primitive
instinct that was my heritage cried out in panic.</p>

<p>And that insistent half-memory woke suddenly. It was the memory
of a story of how voodoo men leave their huts guarded in their
absence by a powerful ju-ju spirit to deal madness and death to the
intruder. White men ascribed such deaths to superstitious fright
and hypnotic suggestion. But in that instant I understood my sense
of lurking peril; I comprehended the horror that breathed like an
invisible mist from that accursed hut. I sensed the reality of the
ju-ju, of which the grotesque wooden images which voodoo men place
in their huts are only a symbol.</p>

<p>Saul Stark was gone; but he had left a Presence to guard his
hut.</p>

<p>I backed away, sweat beading the backs of my hands. Not for a
bag of gold would I have peered into the shuttered windows or
touched that unbolted door. My pistol hung in my hand, useless I
knew against the <i>Thing</i> in that cabin. What it was I could
not know, but I knew it was some brutish, soulless entity drawn
from the black swamps by the spells of voodoo. Man and the natural
animals are not the only sentient beings that haunt this planet.
There are invisible <i>Things</i>&mdash;black spirits of the deep
swamps and the slimes of the river beds&mdash;the Negroes know of
them...</p>

<p>My horse was trembling like a leaf and he shouldered close to me
as if seeking security in bodily contact. I mounted and reined
away, fighting a panicky urge to strike in the spurs and bolt madly
down the trail.</p>

<p>I breathed an involuntary sigh of relief as the somber clearing
fell away behind me and was lost from sight. I did not, as soon as
I was out of sight of the cabin, revile myself for a silly fool. My
experience was too vivid in my mind. It was not cowardice that
prompted my retreat from that empty hut; it was the natural
instinct of self-preservation, such as keeps a squirrel from
entering the lair of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>My horse snorted and shied violently. A gun was in my hand
before I saw what had startled me. Again a rich musical laugh
taunted me.</p>

<p>She was leaning against a bent tree-trunk, her hands clasped
behind her sleek head, insolently posing her sensuous figure. The
barbaric fascination of her was not dispelled by daylight; if
anything, the glow of the low-hanging sun enhanced it.</p>

<p>"Why did you not go into the ju-ju cabin, Kirby Buckner?" she
mocked, lowering her arms and moving insolently out from the
tree.</p>

<p>She was clad as I had never seen a swamp woman, or any other
woman, dressed. Snakeskin sandals were on her feet, sewn with tiny
sea-shells that were never gathered on this continent. A short
silken skirt of flaming crimson molded her full hips, and was
upheld by a broad beadworked girdle. Barbaric anklets and armlets
clashed as she moved, heavy ornaments of crudely hammered gold that
were as African as her loftily piled coiffure. Nothing else she
wore, and on her bosom, between her arching breasts, I glimpsed the
faint lines of tattooing on her brown skin.</p>

<p>She posed derisively before me, not in allure, but in mockery.
Triumphant malice blazed in her dark eyes; her red lips curled with
cruel mirth. Looking at her then I found it easy to believe all the
tales I had heard of torture and mutilations inflicted by the women
of savage races on wounded enemies. She was alien, even in this
primitive setting; she needed a grimmer, more bestial background, a
background of steaming jungle, reeking black swamps, flaring fires
and cannibal feasts, and the bloody altars of abysmal tribal
gods.</p>

<p>"Kirby Buckner!" She seemed to caress the syllables with her red
tongue, yet the very intonation was an obscene insult. "Why did you
not enter Saul Stark's cabin? It was not locked! Did you fear what
you might see there? Did you fear you might come out with your hair
white like an old man's, and the drooling lips of an imbecile?"</p>

<p>"What's in that hut?" I demanded.</p>

<p>She laughed in my face, and snapped her fingers with a peculiar
gesture.</p>

<p>"One of the ones which come oozing like black mist out of the
night when Saul Stark beats the ju-ju drum and shrieks the black
incantation to the gods that crawl on their bellies in the
swamp."</p>

<p>"What is he doing here? The black folk were quiet until he
came."</p>

<p>Her red lips curled disdainfully. "Those black dogs? They are
his slaves. If they disobey he kills them, <i>or puts them in the
swamp</i>. For long we have looked for a place to begin our rule.
We have chosen Canaan. You whites must go. And since we know that
white people can never be driven away from their land, we must kill
you all."</p>

<p>It was my turn to laugh, grimly.</p>

<p>"They tried that, back in '45."</p>

<p>"They did not have Saul Stark to lead them, then," she answered
calmly.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose they won? Do you think that would be the end of
it? Other white men would come into Canaan and kill them all."</p>

<p>"They would have to cross water," she answered. "We can defend
the rivers and creeks. Saul Stark will have many <i>servants in the
swamps</i> to do his bidding. He will be king of black Canaan. No
one can cross the waters to come against him. He will rule his
tribe, as his fathers ruled their tribes in the Ancient Land."</p>

<p>"Mad as a loon!" I muttered. Then curiosity impelled me to ask:
"Who is this fool? What are you to him?"</p>

<p>"He is the son of a Kongo witch-finder, and he is the greatest
voodoo priest out of the Ancient Land," she answered, laughing at
me again. "I? You shall learn who I am, tonight in the swamp, in
the House of Damballah."</p>

<p>"Yes?" I grunted. "What's to prevent me from taking you into
Grimesville with me? You know the answers to questions I'd like to
ask."</p>

<p>Her laughter was like the slash of a velvet whip.</p>

<p>"You drag me to the village of the whites? Not all death and
hell could keep me from the Dance of the Skull, tonight in the
House of Damballah. You are my captive, already." She laughed
derisively as I started and glared into the shadows about me. "No
one is hiding there. I am alone, and you are the strongest man in
Canaan. Even Saul Stark fears you, for he sent me with three men to
kill you before you could reach the village. Yet you are my
captive. I have but to beckon, so"&mdash;she crooked a contemptuous
finger&mdash;"and you will follow to the fires of Damballah and the
knives of the torturers."</p>

<p>I laughed at her, but my mirth rang hollow. I could not deny the
incredible magnetism of this brown enchantress; it fascinated and
impelled, drawing me toward her, beating at my will power. I could
not fail to recognize it any more than I could fail to recognize
the peril in the ju-ju hut.</p>

<p>My agitation was apparent to her, for her eyes flashed with
unholy triumph.</p>

<p>"Black men are fools, all but Saul Stark," she laughed. "White
men are fools, too. I am the daughter of a white man, who lived in
the hut of a black king and mated with his daughters. I know the
strength of white men, and their weakness. I failed last night when
I met you in the woods, but now I cannot fail!" Savage exultation
thrummed in her voice. "By the blood in your veins I have snared
you. The knife of the man you killed scratched your
hand&mdash;seven drops of blood that fell on the pine needles have
given me your soul! I took that blood, and Saul Stark gave me the
man who ran away. Saul Stark hates cowards. With his hot, quivering
heart, and seven drops of your blood, Kirby Buckner, deep in the
swamps I have made such magic as none but the Bride of Damballah
can make. Already you feel its urge! Oh, you are strong! The man
you fought with the knife died less than an hour later. But you
cannot fight me. Your blood makes you my slave. I have put a
conjurment upon you."</p>

<p>By heaven, it was not mere madness she was mouthing! Hypnotism,
magic, call it what you will, I felt its onslaught on my brain and
will&mdash;a blind, senseless impulse that seemed to be rushing me
against my will to the brink of some nameless abyss.</p>

<p>"I have made a charm you cannot resist!" she cried. "When I call
you, you will come! Into the deep swamps you will follow me. You
will see the Dance of the Skull and you will see the doom of a poor
fool who sought to betray Saul Stark&mdash;who dreamed he could
resist the Call of Damballah when it came. Into the swamp he goes
tonight, with Tunk Bixby and the other four fools who opposed Saul
Stark. You shall see that. You shall know and understand your own
doom. And then you too shall go into the swamp, into darkness and
silence deep as the darkness of nighted Africa! But before the
darkness engulfs you there will be sharp knives, and little
fires&mdash;oh, you will scream for death, even for the death that
is beyond death!"</p>

<p>With a choking cry I whipped out a pistol and leveled it full at
her breast. It was cocked and my finger was on the trigger. At that
range I could not miss. But she looked full into the black muzzle
and laughed&mdash;laughed&mdash;laughed, in wild peals that froze
the blood in my veins.</p>

<p>And I sat there like an image pointing a pistol I could not
fire! A frightful paralysis gripped me. I knew, with numbing
certainty, that my life depended on the pull of that trigger, but I
could not crook my finger&mdash;not though every muscle in my body
quivered with the effort and sweat broke out on my face in clammy
beads.</p>

<p>She ceased laughing, then, and stood looking at me in a manner
indescribably sinister.</p>

<p>"You cannot shoot me, Kirby Buckner," she said quietly. "I have
enslaved your soul. You cannot understand my power, but it has
ensnared you. It is the Lure of the Bride of Damballah&mdash;the
blood I have mixed with the mystic waters of Africa drawing the
blood in your veins. Tonight you will come to me, in the House of
Damballah."</p>

<p>"You lie!" My voice was an unnatural croak bursting from dry
lips. "You've hypnotized me, you she-devil, so I can't pull this
trigger. But you can't drag me across the swamps to you."</p>

<p>"It is you who lie," she returned calmly. "You know you lie.
Ride back toward Grimesville or wherever you will Kirby Buckner.
But when the sun sets and the black shadows crawl out of the
swamps, you will see me beckoning you, and you will follow me. Long
I have planned your doom, Kirby Buckner, since first I heard the
white men of Canaan talking of you. It was I who sent the word down
the river that brought you back to Canaan. Not even Saul Stark
knows of my plans for you.</p>

<p>"At dawn Grimesville shall go up in flames, and the heads of the
white men will be tossed in the blood-running streets. But tonight
is the Night of Damballah, and a white sacrifice shall be given to
the black gods. Hidden among the trees you shall watch the Dance of
the Skull&mdash;and then I shall call you forth&mdash;to die! And
now, go fool! Run as far and as fast as you will. At sunset,
wherever you are, you will turn your footsteps toward the House of
Damballah!"</p>

<p>And with the spring of a panther she was gone into the thick
brush, and as she vanished the strange paralysis dropped from me.
With a gasped oath I fired blindly after her, but only a mocking
laugh floated back to me.</p>

<p>Then in a panic I wrenched my horse about and spurred him down
the trail. Reason and logic had momentarily vanished from my brain,
leaving me in the grasp of blind primitive fear. I had confronted
sorcery beyond my power to resist. I had felt my will mastered by
the mesmerism in a brown woman's eyes. And now one driving urge
overwhelmed me&mdash;a wild desire to cover as much distance as I
could before that low-hanging sun dipped below the horizon and the
black shadows came crawling from the swamps.</p>

<p>And yet I knew I could not outrun the grisly specter that
menaced me. I was like a man fleeing in a nightmare, trying to
escape from a monstrous phantom which kept pace with me despite my
desperate speed.</p>

<p>I had not reached the Richardson cabin when above the drumming
of my flight I heard the clop of hoofs ahead of me, and an instant
later, sweeping around a kink in the trail, I almost rode down a
tall, lanky man on an equally gaunt horse.</p>

<p>He yelped and dodged back as I jerked my horse to its haunches,
my pistol presented at his breast.</p>

<p>"Look out, Kirby! It's me&mdash;Jim Braxton! My God, you look
like you'd seen a ghost! What's chasin' you?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I demanded, lowering my gun.</p>

<p>"Lookin' for you. Folks got worried as it got late and you
didn't come in with the refugees: I 'lowed I'd light out and look
for you. Miz Richardson said you rode into the Neck. Where in
tarnation you been?"</p>

<p>"To Saul Stark's cabin."</p>

<p>"You takin' a big chance. What'd you find there?"</p>

<p>The sight of another white man had somewhat steadied my nerves.
I opened my mouth to narrate my adventure, and was shocked to hear
myself saying, instead: "Nothing. He wasn't there."</p>

<p>"Thought I heard a gun crack, a while ago," he remarked,
glancing sharply at me sidewise.</p>

<p>"I shot at a copperhead," I answered, and shuddered. This
reticence regarding the brown woman was compulsory; I could no more
speak of her than I could pull the trigger of the pistol aimed at
her. And I cannot describe the horror that beset me when I realized
this. The conjer spells the black men feared were not lies, I
realized sickly; demons in human form <i>did</i> exist who were
able to enslave men's will and thoughts.</p>

<p>Braxton was eyeing me strangely.</p>

<p>"We're lucky the woods ain't full of black copperheads," he
said. "Tope Sorley's pulled out."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" By an effort I pulled myself together.</p>

<p>"Just that. Tom Breckinridge was in the cabin with him. Tope
hadn't said a word since you talked to him. Just laid on that bunk
and shivered. Then a kind of holler begun way out in the woods, and
Tom went to the door with his rifle-gun, but couldn't see nothin'.
Well, while he was standin' there he got a lick on the head from
<i>behind</i>, and as he fell he seen that crazy nigger Tope jump
over him and light out for the woods. Tom he taken a shot at him,
but missed. Now what do you make of that?"</p>

<p>"The Call of Damballah!" I muttered, a chill perspiration
beading my body. "God! The poor devil!"</p>

<p>"Huh? What's that?"</p>

<p>"For God's sake let's not stand here mouthing! The sun will soon
be down!" In a frenzy of impatience I kicked my mount down the
trail. Braxton followed me, obviously puzzled. With a terrific
effort I got a grip on myself. How madly fantastic it was that
Kirby Buckner should be shaking in the grip of unreasoning terror!
It was so alien to my whole nature that it was no wonder Jim
Braxton was unable to comprehend what ailed me.</p>

<p>"Tope didn't go of his own free will," I said. "That call was a
summons he couldn't resist. Hypnotism, black magic, voodoo,
whatever you want to call it, Saul Stark has some damnable power
that enslaves men's willpower. The blacks are gathered somewhere in
the swamp, for some kind of a devilish voodoo ceremony, which I
have reason to believe will culminate in the murder of Tope Sorley.
We've got to get to Grimesville if we can. I expect an attack at
dawn."</p>

<p>Braxton was pale in the dimming light. He did not ask me where I
got my knowledge.</p>

<p>"We'll lick 'em when they come; but it'll be slaughter."</p>

<p>I did not reply. My eyes were fixed with savage intensity on the
sinking sun, and as it slid out of sight behind the trees I was
shaken with an icy tremor. In vain I told myself that no occult
power could draw me against my will. If she had been able to compel
me, why had she not forced me to accompany her from the glade of
the ju-ju hut? A grisly whisper seemed to tell me that she was but
playing with me, as a cat allows a mouse almost to escape, only to
be pounced upon again.</p>

<p>"Kirby, what's the matter with you?" I scarcely heard Braxton's
anxious voice. "You're sweatin' and shakin' like you had the
aggers. What&mdash;hey, what you stoppin' for?"</p>

<p>I had not consciously pulled on the rein, but my horse halted,
and stood trembling and snorting, before the mouth of a narrow
trail which meandered away at right angles from the road we were
following&mdash;a trail that led north.</p>

<p>"Listen!" I hissed tensely.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Braxton drew a pistol. The brief twilight of the
pinelands was deepening into dusk.</p>

<p>"Don't you hear it?" I muttered. "Drums! Drums beating in
Goshen!"</p>

<p>"I don't hear nothin'," he mumbled uneasily. "If they was
beatin' drums in Goshen you couldn't hear 'em this far away."</p>

<p>"Look there!" my sharp sudden cry made him start. I was pointing
down the dim trail, at the figure which stood there in the dusk
less than a hundred yards away. There in the dusk I saw her, even
made out the gleam of her strange eyes, the mocking smile on her
red lips. "Saul Stark's brown wench!" I raved, tearing at my
scabbard. "My God, man, are you stone-blind? Don't you see
her?"</p>

<p>"I don't see nobody!" he whispered, livid. "What are you talkin'
about, Kirby?"</p>

<p>With eyes glaring I fired down the trail, and fired again, and
yet again. This time no paralysis gripped my arm. But the smiling
face still mocked me from the shadows. A slender, rounded arm
lifted, a finger beckoned imperiously; and then she was gone and I
was spurring my horse down the narrow trail, blind, dead and dumb,
with a sensation as of being caught in a black tide that was
carrying me with it as it rushed on to a destination beyond my
comprehension.</p>

<p>Dimly I heard Braxton's urgent yells, and then he drew up beside
me with a clatter of hoofs, and grabbed my reins, setting my horse
back on its haunches. I remember striking at him with my
gun-barrel, without realizing what I was doing. All the black
rivers of Africa were surging and foaming within my consciousness,
roaring into a torrent that was sweeping me down to engulf me in an
ocean of doom.</p>

<p>"Kirby, are you crazy? This trail leads to Goshen!"</p>

<p>I shook my head dazedly. The foam of the rushing waters swirled
in my brain, and my voice sounded far away. "Go back! Ride for
Grimesville! I'm going to Goshen."</p>

<p>"Kirby, you're mad!"</p>

<p>"Mad or sane, I'm going to Goshen this night," I answered dully.
I was fully conscious. I knew what I was saying, and what I was
doing. I realized the incredible folly of my action, and I realized
my inability to help myself. Some shred to sanity impelled me to
try to conceal the grisly truth from my companion, to offer a
rational reason for my madness. "Saul Stark is in Goshen. He's the
one who's responsible for all this trouble. I'm going to kill him.
That will stop the uprising before it starts."</p>

<p>He was trembling like a man with the ague.</p>

<p>"Then I'm goin' with you."</p>

<p>"You must go on to Grimesville and warn the people," I insisted,
holding to sanity, but feeling a strong urge begin to seize me, an
irresistible urge to be in motion&mdash;to be riding in the
direction toward which I was so horribly drawn.</p>

<p>"They'll be on their guard," he said stubbornly.</p>

<p>"They won't need my warnin'. I'm goin' with you. I don't know
what's got in you, but I ain't goin' to let you die alone among
these black woods."</p>

<p>I did not argue. I could not. The blind rivers were sweeping me
on&mdash;on&mdash;on! And down the trail, dim in the dusk, I
glimpsed a supple figure, caught the gleam of uncanny eyes, the
crook of a lifted finger... Then I was in motion, galloping down
the trail, and I heard the drum of Braxton's horse's hoofs behind
me.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="canaan4" name="canaan4">4. THE DWELLERS IN THE SWAMP</a>
</h2>

<p>Night fell and the moon shone through the trees, blood-red
behind the black branches. The horses were growing hard to
manage.</p>

<p>"They got more sense'n us, Kirby," muttered Braxton.</p>

<p>"Panther, maybe," I replied absently, my eyes searching the
gloom of the trail ahead.</p>

<p>"Naw, t'ain't. Closer we get to Goshen, the worse they git. And
every time we swing nigh to a creek they shy and snort."</p>

<p>The trail had not yet crossed any of the narrow, muddy creeks
that criss-crossed that end of Canaan, but several times it had
swung so close to one of them that we glimpsed the black streak
that was water glinting dully in the shadows of the thick growth.
And each time, I remembered, the horses showed signs of fear.</p>

<p>But I had hardly noticed, wrestling as I was with the grisly
compulsion that was driving me. Remember, I was not like a man in a
hypnotic trance. I was fully aware, fully conscious. Even the daze
in which I had seemed to hear the roar of black rivers had passed,
leaving my mind clear, my thoughts lucid. And that was the sweating
hell of it: to realize my folly clearly and poignantly, but to be
unable to conquer it. Vividly I realized that I was riding to
torture and death, and leading a faithful friend to the same end.
But on I went. My efforts to break the spell that gripped me almost
unseated my reason, but on I went. I cannot explain my compulsion,
any more than I can explain why a sliver of steel is drawn to a
magnet. It was a black power beyond the ring of white man's
knowledge; a basic, elemental thing of which formal hypnotism is
but scanty crumbs, spilled at random. A power beyond my control was
drawing me to Goshen, and beyond; more I cannot explain, any more
than the rabbit could explain why the eyes of the swaying serpent
draw him into its gaping jaws.</p>

<p>We were not far from Goshen when Braxton's horse unseated its
rider, and my own began snorting and plunging.</p>

<p>"They won't go no closer!" gasped Braxton, fighting at the
reins.</p>

<p>I swung off, threw the reins over the saddle-horn.</p>

<p>"Go back, for God's sake, Jim! I'm going on afoot."</p>

<p>I heard him whimper an oath, then his horse was galloping after
mine, and he was following me on foot. The thought that he must
share my doom sickened me, but I could not dissuade him; and ahead
of me a supple form was dancing in the shadows, luring me
on&mdash;on-on...</p>

<p>I wasted no more bullets on that mocking shape. Braxton could
not see it, and I knew it was part of my enchantment, no real woman
of flesh and blood, but a hell-born will-o'-the-wisp, mocking me
and leading me through the night to a hideous death. A "sending,"
the people of the Orient, who are wiser than we, call such a
thing.</p>

<p>Braxton peered nervously at the black forest walls about us, and
I knew his flesh was crawling with the fear of sawed-off shotguns
blasting us suddenly from the shadows. But it was no ambush of lead
or steel I feared as we emerged into the moonlit clearing that
housed the cabins of Goshen.</p>

<p>The double line of log cabins faced each other across the dusty
street. One line backed against the bank of Tularoosa Creek. The
black stoops almost overhung the black waters. Nothing moved in the
moonlight. No lights showed, no smoke oozed up from the
stick-and-mud chimneys. It might have been a dead town, deserted
and forgotten.</p>

<p>"It's a trap!" hissed Braxton, his eyes blazing slits. He bent
forward like a skulking panther, a gun in each hand. "They're
layin' for us in them huts!"</p>

<p>Then he cursed, but followed me as I strode down the street. I
did not hail the silent huts. I <i>knew</i> Goshen was deserted. I
felt its emptiness. Yet there was a contradictory sensation as of
spying eyes fixed upon us. I did not try to reconcile these
opposite convictions.</p>

<p>"They're gone," muttered Braxton, nervously. "I can't smell 'em.
I can always smell niggers, if they're a lot of 'em, or if they're
right close. You reckon they've gone to raid Grimesville?"</p>

<p>"No," I muttered. "They're in the House of Damballah."</p>

<p>He shot a quick glance at me.</p>

<p>"That's a neck of land in the Tularoosa about three miles west
of here. My grandpap used to talk about it. The niggers held their
heathen palavers there back in slave times. You
ain't&mdash;Kirby&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" I wiped the icy sweat from my face.
"<i>Listen!</i>"</p>

<p>Through the black woodlands the faint throb of a drum whispered
on the wind that glided up the shadowy reaches of the
Tularoosa.</p>

<p>Braxton shivered. "It's them, all right. But for, God's sake,
Kirby&mdash;<i>look out!</i>"</p>

<p>With an oath he sprang toward the houses on the bank of the
creek. I was after him just in time to glimpse a dark clumsy object
scrambling or tumbling down, the sloping bank into the water.
Braxton threw up his long pistol, then lowered it, with a baffled
curse. A faint splash marked the disappearance of the creature. The
shiny black surface crinkled with spreading ripples.</p>

<p>"What was it?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"A nigger on his all-fours!" swore Braxton. His face was
strangely pallid in the moonlight. "He was crouched between them
cabins there, watchin' us!"</p>

<p>"It must have been an alligator." What a mystery is the human
mind! I was arguing for sanity and logic, I, the blind victim of a
compulsion beyond sanity and logic. "A nigger would have to come up
for air."</p>

<p>"He swum under the water and come up in the shadder of the bresh
where we couldn't see him," maintained Braxton. "Now he'll go warn
Saul Stark."</p>

<p>"Never mind!" The pulse was thrumming in my temples again, the
roar of foaming water rising irresistibly in my brain. "I'm
going&mdash;straight through the swamp. For the last time, go
back!"</p>

<p>"No! Sane or mad, I'm goin' with you!"</p>

<p>The pulse of the drum was fitful, growing more distinct as we
advanced. We struggled through jungle-thick growth; tangled vines
tripped us; our boots sank in scummy mire. We were entering the
fringe of the swamp which grew deeper and denser until it
culminated in the uninhabitable morass where the Tularoosa flowed
into Black River, miles farther to the west.</p>

<p>The moon had not yet set, but the shadows were black under the
interlacing branches with their mossy beards. We plunged into the
first creek we must cross, one of the many muddy streams flowing
into the Tularoosa. The water was only thigh-deep, the moss-clogged
bottom fairly firm. My foot felt the edge of a sheer drop, and I
warned Braxton: "Look out for a deep hole; keep right behind
me."</p>

<p>His answer was unintelligible. He was breathing heavily,
crowding close behind me. Just as I reached the sloping bank and
pulled myself up by the slimy, projecting roots, the water was
violently agitated behind me. Braxton cried out incoherently, and
hurled himself up the bank, almost upsetting me. I wheeled, gun in
hand, but saw only the black water seething and whirling, after his
thrashing rush through it.</p>

<p>"What the devil, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Somethin' grabbed me!" he panted. "Somethin' out of the deep
hole. I tore loose and busted up the bank. I tell you, Kirby,
something's follerin' us! Somethin' that swims under the
water."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was that nigger you saw. These swamp people swim like
fish. Maybe he swam up under the water to try to drown you."</p>

<p>He shook his head, staring at the black water, gun in hand.</p>

<p>"It <i>smelt</i> like a nigger, and the little I saw of it
<i>looked</i> like a nigger. But it didn't <i>feel</i> like any
kind of a human."</p>

<p>"Well, it was an alligator then," I muttered absently as I
turned away. As always when I halted, even for a moment, the roar
of peremptory and imperious rivers shook the foundations of my
reason.</p>

<p>He splashed after me without comment. Scummy puddles rose about
our ankles, and we stumbled over moss-grown cypress knees. Ahead of
us there loomed another, wider creek, and Braxton caught my
arm.</p>

<p>"Don't do it, Kirby!" he gasped. "If we go into that water,
it'll git us sure!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Whatever it was that flopped down that bank back
there in Goshen. The same thing that grabbed me in that creek back
yonder. Kirby, let's go back."</p>

<p>"Go back?" I laughed in bitter agony. "I wish to God I could!
I've got to go on. Either Saul Stark or I must die before
dawn."</p>

<p>He licked dry lips and whispered. "Go on, then; I'm with you,
come heaven or hell." He thrust his pistol back into its scabbard,
and drew a long keen knife from his boot. "Go ahead!"</p>

<p>I climbed down the sloping bank and splashed into the water that
rose to my hips. The cypress branches bent a gloomy, moss-trailing
arch over the creek. The water was black as midnight. Braxton was a
blur, toiling behind me. I gained the first shelf of the opposite
bank and paused, in water knee-deep, to turn and look back at
him.</p>

<p>Everything happened at once, then. I saw Braxton halt short,
staring at something on the bank behind me. He cried out, whipped
out a gun and fired, just as I turned. In the flash of the gun I
glimpsed a supple form reeling backward, a brown face fiendishly
contorted. Then in the momentary blindness that followed the flash,
I heard Jim Braxton scream.</p>

<p>Sight and brain cleared in time to show me a sudden swirl of the
murky water, a round, black object breaking the surface behind
Jim&mdash;and then Braxton gave a strangled cry and went under with
a frantic thrashing and splashing. With an incoherent yell I sprang
into the creek, stumbled and went to my knees, almost submerging
myself. As I struggled up I saw Braxton's head, now streaming
blood, break the surface for an instant, and I lunged toward it. It
went under and another head appeared in its place, a shadowy black
head. I stabbed at it ferociously, and my knife cut only the blank
water as the thing dipped out of sight.</p>

<p>I staggered from the wasted force of the blow, and when I
righted myself, the water lay unbroken about me. I called Jim's
name, but there was no answer. Then panic laid a cold hand on me,
and I splashed to the bank, sweating and trembling. With the water
no higher than my knees I halted and waited, for I knew not what.
But presently, down the creek a short distance, I made out a vague
object lying in the shallow water near the shore.</p>

<p>I waded to it, through the clinging mud and crawling vines. It
was Jim Braxton, and he was dead. It was not the wound in his head
which had killed him. Probably he had struck a submerged rock when
he was dragged under. But the marks of strangling fingers showed
black on his throat. At the sight a nameless horror oozed out of
that black swamp and coiled itself clammily about my soul; for no
human fingers ever left such marks as those.</p>

<p>I had seen a head rise in the water, a head that looked like
that of a Negro, though the features had been indistinct in the
darkness. But no man, white or black, ever possessed the fingers
that had crushed the life out of Jim Braxton. The distant drum
grunted as if in mockery.</p>

<p>I dragged the body up on the bank and left it. I could not
linger longer, for the madness was foaming in my brain again,
driving me with white-hot spurs. But as I climbed the bank, I found
blood on the bushes, and was shaken by the implication.</p>

<p>I remembered the figure I had seen staggering in the flash of
Braxton's gun. She had been there, waiting for me on the bank,
then&mdash;not a spectral illusion, but the woman herself, in flesh
and blood! Braxton had fired at her, and wounded her. But the wound
could not have been mortal; for no corpse lay among the bushes, and
the grim hypnosis that dragged me onward was unweakened. Dizzily I
wondered if she could be killed by mortal weapons.</p>

<p>The moon had set. The starlight scarcely penetrated the
interwoven branches. No more creeks barred my way, only shallow
streams, through which I splashed with sweating haste. Yet I did
not expect to be attacked. Twice the dweller in the depths had
passed me by to attack my companion. In icy despair I knew I was
being saved for the grimmer fate. Each stream I crossed might be
hiding the monster that killed Jim Braxton. Those creeks were all
connected in a network of winding waterways. It could follow me
easily. But my horror of it was less than the horror of the
jungle-born magnetism that lurked in a witch-woman's eyes.</p>

<p>And as I stumbled through the tangled vegetation, I heard the
drum rumbling ahead of me, louder and louder, a demoniacal mockery.
Then a human voice mingled with its mutter, in a long-drawn cry of
horror and agony that set every fiber of me quivering with
sympathy. Sweat coursed down my clammy flesh; soon my own voice
might be lifted like that, under unnamable torture. But on I went,
my feet moving like automatons, apart from my body, motivated by a
will not my own.</p>

<p>The drum grew loud, and a fire glowed among the black trees.
Presently, crouching among the bushes, I stared across the stretch
of black water that separated me from a nightmare scene. My halting
there was as compulsory as the rest of my actions had been. Vaguely
I knew the stage for horror had been set, but the time for my entry
upon it was not yet. When the time had come, I would receive my
summons.</p>

<p>A low, wooded island split the black creek, connected with the
shore opposite me by a narrow neck of land. At its lower end the
creek split into a network of channels threading their way among
hummocks and rotting logs and moss-grown, vine-tangled clumps of
trees. Directly across from my refuge the shore of the island was
deeply indented by an arm of open, deep black water. Bearded trees
walled a small clearing, and partly hid a hut. Between the hut and
the shore burned afire that sent up weird twisting snake-tongues of
green flames. Scores of black people squatted under the shadows of
the overhanging branches. When the green fire lit their faces it
lent them the appearance of drowned corpses.</p>

<p>In the midst of the glade stood a giant Negro, an awesome statue
in black marble. He was clad in ragged trousers, but on his head
was a band of beaten gold set with a huge red jewel, and on his
feet were barbaric sandals. His features reflected titanic vitality
no less than his huge body. But he was all Negro&mdash;flaring
nostrils, thick lips, ebony skin. I knew I looked upon Saul Stark,
the conjure man.</p>

<p>He was regarding something that lay in the sand before him,
something dark and bulky that moaned feebly. Presently, lifting his
head, he rolled out a sonorous invocation across the black waters.
From the blacks huddled under the trees there came a shuddering
response, like a wind wailing through midnight branches. Both
invocation and response were framed in an unknown tongue&mdash;a
guttural, primitive language.</p>

<p>Again he called out, this time a curious high-pitched wail. A
shuddering sigh swept the black people. All eyes were fixed on the
dusky water. And presently an object rose slowly from the depths. A
sudden trembling shook me. It looked like the head of a Negro. One
after another it was followed by similar objects until five heads
reared above the black, cypress-shadowed water. They might have
been five Negroes submerged except for their heads&mdash;but I knew
this was not so. There was something diabolical here. Their
silence, motionlessness, their whole aspect was unnatural. From the
trees came the hysterical sobbing of women, and someone whispered a
man's name.</p>

<p>Then Saul Stark lifted his hands, and the five heads silently
sank out of sight. Like a ghostly whisper I seemed to hear the
voice of the African witch: "<i>He puts them in the swamp!</i>"</p>

<p>Stark's deep voice rolled out across the narrow water: "And now
the Dance of the Skull, to make the conjer sure!"</p>

<p>What had the witch said? "<i>Hidden among the trees You shall
watch the dance of the Skull!</i>"</p>

<p>The drum struck up again, growling and rumbling. The blacks
swayed on their haunches, lifting a wordless chant. Saul Stark
paced measuredly about the figure on the sand, his arms weaving
cryptic patterns. Then he wheeled and faced toward the other end of
the glade. By some sleight of hand he now grasped a grinning human
skull, and this he cast upon the wet sand beyond the body. "Bride
of Damballah!" he thundered. "The sacrifice awaits!"</p>

<p>There was an expectant pause; the chanting sank. All eyes were
glued on the farther end of the glade. Stark stood waiting, and I
saw him scowl as if puzzled. Then as he opened his mouth to repeat
the call, a barbaric figure moved out of the shadows.</p>

<p>At the sight of her a chill shuddering shook me. For a moment
she stood motionless, the firelight glinting on her gold ornaments,
her head hanging on her breast. A tense silence reigned and I saw
Saul Stark staring at her sharply. She seemed to be detached,
somehow, standing aloof and withdrawn, head bent strangely.</p>

<p>Then, as if rousing herself, she began to sway with a jerky
rhythm, and presently whirled into the mazes of a dance that was
ancient when the ocean drowned the black kings of Atlantis. I
cannot describe it. It was bestiality and diabolism set to motion,
framed in a writhing, spinning whirl of posturing and gesturing
that would have appalled a dancer of the Pharaohs. And that cursed
skull danced with her; rattling and clashing on the sand, it
bounded and spun like a live thing in time with her leaps and
prancings.</p>

<p>But there was something amiss. I sensed it. Her arms hung limp,
her drooping head swayed. Her legs bent and faltered, making her
lurch drunkenly and out of time. A murmur rose from the people, and
bewilderment etched Saul Stark's black countenance. For the
domination of a conjure man is a thing hinged on a hair-trigger.
Any trifling dislocation of formula or ritual may disrupt the whole
web of his enchantment.</p>

<p>As for me, I felt the perspiration freeze on my flesh as I
watched the grisly dance. The unseen shackles that bound me to that
gyrating she-devil were strangling, crushing me. I knew she was
approaching a climax, when she would summon me from my
hiding-place, to wade through the black waters to the House of
Damballah, to my doom.</p>

<p>Now she whirled to a floating stop, and when she halted, poised
on her toes, she faced toward the spot where I lay hidden, and I
knew that she could see me as plainly as if I stood in the open;
knew, too, somehow, that only she knew of my presence. I felt
myself toppling on the edge of the abyss. She raised her head and I
saw the flame of her eyes, even at that distance. Her face was lit
with awful triumph. Slowly she raised her hand, and I felt my limbs
begin to jerk in response to that terrible magnetism. She opened
her mouth&mdash;</p>

<p>But from that open mouth sounded only a choking gurgle, and
suddenly her lips were dyed crimson. And suddenly, without warning,
her knees gave way and she pitched headlong into the sands.</p>

<p>And as she fell, so I too fell, sinking into the mire.Something
burst in my brain with a shower of flame. And then I was crouching
among the trees, weak and trembling, but with such a sense of
freedom and lightness of limb as I never dreamed a man could
experience. The black spell that gripped me was broken; the foul
incubus lifted from my soul. It was as if light had burst upon a
night blacker than African midnight.</p>

<p>At the fall of the girl a wild cry rose from the blacks, and
they sprang up, trembling on the verge of panic. I saw their
rolling white eyeballs, their bared teeth glistening in the
firelight. Saul Stark had worked their primitive natures up to a
pitch of madness, meaning to turn this frenzy, at the proper time,
into a fury of battle. It could as easily turn into an hysteria of
terror. Stark shouted sharply at them.</p>

<p>But just then the girl in a last convulsion, rolled over on the
wet sand, and the firelight shone on a round hole between her
breasts, which still oozed crimson. Jim Braxton's bullet had found
its mark.</p>

<p>From the first I had felt that she was not wholly human; some
black jungle spirit sired her, lending her the abysmal subhuman
vitality that made her what she was. She had said that neither
death nor hell could keep her from the Dance of the Skull. And,
shot through the heart and dying, she had come through the swamp
from the creek where she had received her death-wound to the House
of Damballah. And the Dance of the Skull had been her death
dance.</p>

<p>Dazed as a condemned man just granted a reprieve, at first I
hardly grasped the meaning of the scene that now unfolded before
me.</p>

<p>The blacks were in a frenzy. In the sudden, and to them
inexplicable, death of the sorceress they saw a fearsome portent.
They had no way of knowing that she was dying when she entered the
glade. To them, their prophetess and priestess had been struck down
under their very eyes, by an invisible death. This was magic
blacker than Saul Stark's wizardry&mdash;and obviously hostile to
them.</p>

<p>Like fear-maddened cattle they stampeded. Howling, screaming,
tearing at one another they blundered through the trees, heading
for the neck of land and the shore beyond. Saul Stark stood
transfixed, heedless of them as he stared down at the brown girl,
dead at last. And suddenly I came to myself, and with my awakened
manhood came cold fury and the lust to kill. I drew a gun, and
aiming in the uncertain firelight, pulled the trigger. Only a click
answered me. The powder in the cap-and-ball pistols was wet.</p>

<p>Saul Stark lifted his head and licked his lips. The sounds of
flight faded in the distance, and he stood alone in the glade. His
eyes rolled whitely toward the black woods around him. He bent,
grasped the man-like object that lay on the sand, and dragged it
into the hut. The instant he vanished I started toward the island,
wading through the narrow channels at the lower end. I had almost
reached the shore when a mass of driftwood gave way with me and I
slid into a deep hole.</p>

<p>Instantly the water swirled about me, and a head rose beside me;
a dim face was close to mine&mdash;the face of a Negro&mdash;<i>the
face of Tunk Bixby</i>. But now it was inhuman; as expressionless
and soulless as that of a catfish; the face of a being no longer
human, and no longer mindful of its human origin.</p>

<p>Slimy, misshapen fingers gripped my throat, and I drove my knife
into the sagging mouth. The features vanished in a wave of blood;
mutely the thing sank out of sight, and I hauled myself up the
bank, under the thick bushes.</p>

<p>Stark had run from his hut, a pistol in his hand. He was staring
wildly about, alarmed by the noise he had heard, but I knew he
could not see me. His ashy skin glistened with perspiration. He who
had ruled by fear was now ruled by fear. He feared the unknown hand
that had slain his mistress; feared the Negroes who had fled him;
feared the abysmal swamp which had sheltered him, and the
monstrosities he had created. He lifted a weird call that quavered
with panic. He called again as only four heads broke the water, but
he called in vain.</p>

<p>But the four heads began to move toward the shore and the man
who stood there. He shot them one after another. They made no
effort to avoid the bullets. They came straight on, sinking one by
one. He had fired six shots before the last head vanished. The
shots drowned the sounds of my approach. I was close behind him
when he turned at last.</p>

<p>I know he knew me; recognition flooded his face and fear went
with it, at the knowledge that he had a human being to deal with.
With a scream he hurled his empty pistol at me and rushed after it
with a lifted knife.</p>

<p>I ducked, parried his lunge and countered with a thrust that bit
deep into his ribs. He caught my wrist and I gripped his, and there
we strained, breast to breast. His eyes were like a mad dog's in
the starlight, his muscles like steel cords.</p>

<p>I ground my heel down on his bare foot, crushing the instep. He
howled and lost balance, and I tore my knife hand free and stabbed
him in the belly. Blood spurted and he dragged me down with him. I
jerked loose and rose, just as he pulled himself up on his elbow
and hurled his knife. It sang past my ear, and I stamped on his
breast. His ribs caved in under my heel. In a red killing-haze I
knelt, jerked back his head and cut his throat from ear to ear.</p>

<p>There was a pouch of dry powder in his belt. Before I moved
further I reloaded my pistols. Then I went into the hut with a
torch. And there I understood the doom the brown witch had meant
for me. Tope Sorley lay moaning on a bunk. The transmutation that
was to make him a mindless, soulless semi-human dweller in the
water was not complete, but his mind was gone. Some of the physical
changes had been made&mdash;by what godless sorcery out of Africa's
black abyss I have no wish to know. His body was rounded and
elongated, his legs dwarfed; his feet were flattened and broadened,
his fingers horribly long, and webbed. His neck was inches longer
than it should be. His features were not altered, but the
expression was no more human than that of a great fish. And there,
but for the loyalty of Jim Braxton, lay Kirby Buckner. I placed my
pistol muzzle against Tope's head in grim mercy and pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>And so the nightmare closed, and I would not drag out the grisly
narration. The white people of Canaan never found anything on the
island except the bodies of Saul Stark and the brown woman. They
think to this day that a swamp negro killed Jim Braxton, after he
had killed the brown woman, and that I broke up the threatened
uprising by killing Saul Stark. I let them think it. They will
never know the shapes the black water of Tularoosa hides. That is a
secret I share with the cowed and terror-haunted black people of
Goshen and of it neither they nor I have ever spoken.</p>
