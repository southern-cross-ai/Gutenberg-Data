<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h3>
<br>
<hr class="2">
<br>
<p><span class="a">Since</span> the 1st September, 1852, an
edition of 5,000 copies of "The Three Colonies of Australia" has
been exhausted. In this Second Edition I have made material
alterations and additions. The work is now divided into two
parts&mdash;the first Historical, the second Descriptive. I have
in preparation, as a sequel, another volume of less bulk, which
will be a Practical Hand-Book to the South Sea Colonies,
including Australia, Van Diemen's Land, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The Historical section contains, in twenty chapters of 240
pages, a sketch of the discovery and foundation of the Three
Colonies, and the principal political and social events in their
respective careers, between the landing of the first fleet in
Port Jackson and the opening of the gold mines at Mount
Alexander. In the preparation of the first seven chapters (83
pages), I had, in addition to the oral information of old
colonists and valuable MSS., the assistance of the works of
Collins, Wentworth, &amp;c. The remaining thirteen chapters,
which include the administrations of Governors Bourke, Gipps, and
Fitzroy, in New South Wales&mdash;the Land
Question&mdash;Emigration Transportation&mdash;the Constitutional
Contests of the first Australian Representative Council, and the
whole History of the Colonisation of South Australia, are in the
strictest sense of the term original. The materials were diffused
through the votes and proceedings of the Legislative Assembly,
English Blue Books, files of colonial newspapers, and other
sources still more obscure and difficult of access. Whatever,
therefore, be the demerits of this part of my work, it is the
History of the Leading Political and Social Events of a period
never before chronicled by any writer on Australia&mdash;a period
to which Australian colonists look back with as much interest as
we do in England to the struggles for the Reform Bill or for the
repeal of the Corn Laws. In this Second Edition I have rewritten
and condensed the pages devoted to the all-important Land
Question, and devoted an additional forty pages to the
Administration of Governor Fitzroy and the Colonial Policy of
Earl Grey; and I have endeavoured to throw new light on the
government of Sir George Gipps, by giving a chapter of political
poems from a Sydney newspaper, the "Atlas," which will bear
comparison with English compositions of the same kind from the
days of the "Anti-Jacobin" to the days of "Punch."</p>
<p>The Descriptive section has been rendered more complete by the
addition of a tabular view of the counties, towns, mountains, and
rivers of New South Wales and Victoria, extracted, by permission,
from Sir Thomas Mitchell's "Manual of Australasian Geography,"
and by accounts of journeys to and from the various gold-fields,
which I have in great part abridged from the able reports made by
special correspondents of the Sydney papers.</p>
<p>As I have throughout the following pages expressed my opinions
on colonial questions and colonial statesmen with a freedom which
my friends may call bold and my opponents audacious, I may
perhaps, without incurring the charge of egotism, state what have
been my opportunities for acquiring correct information on
colonial subjects.</p>
<p>In 1844 my brother, with whom I had previously kept up a close
correspondence, returned from Australia, where he had passed six
years, engaged in pastoral pursuits. He arrived in England in the
midst of the furious contest, described in Chapter XI. of this
book, between Governor Gipps and the squatters. In the cause of
the squatters he enlisted me; and when the Pastoral Question came
to be discussed in Parliament, we contributed several
letters&mdash;criticising the pastoral regulations which the
government proposed to adopt, to which some of the leading London
journals gave a prominent place.</p>
<p>Up to that time I had been a disciple of the Wakefield system
of colonisation&mdash;Land Monopoly. It was, however, only
necessary to investigate with a practical man the practical
effects of this untenable system in order to become irresistibly
convinced of its fallacy. In 1847-8 I wrote for my brother, who
was a close observer but no writer, a thin duodecimo, "A Voice
from the Far Interior of Australia, by a Bushman."</p>
<p>In 1848 we sent forth the first edition of "The Australian
Hand-Book." Shortly after its publication I had the pleasure to
read an extract, quoted from the volume, in "Blackwood's
Magazine," by the then anonymous author of "The Caxtons," who was
pleased to describe the "Hand-Book" as "admirable for wisdom and
compactness."</p>
<p>From attacking Wakefield's colonial land monopoly in print, I
ventured, on every fitting opportunity, to attack it in public at
meetings held to promote colonisation. At a meeting in 1848,
presided over by Earl Harrowby, I warned the promoters that the
land monopoly was the great bar to the popularity of Australia
among the working classes. At that period opposition to the
Wakefield system was considered wild and democratic; and the line
I took up excluded me from any part in the Colonisation Society
of Charing Cross, which, in spite of a great array of noble
names, never obtained the confidence of the working classes, but
after a brief existence, died of inanition. In the same year my
brother and I commenced our "Emigrants' Journal," with the view
of affording "plain, practical advice to intending emigrants." In
1848, before the fifth number was published, my brother returned
to Australia.</p>
<p>While conducting the "Emigrants' Journal" I acquired a vast
mass of information on colonial subjects. I was brought into
daily contact with colonists of all classes, as well as with
emigrants, and in the course of twelve months I answered more
than one thousand practical questions on emigration and
colonisation.</p>
<p>It was during the progress of this Journal that my attention
was called to the singular coincidence between the views at which
I had slowly arrived on colonial matters, and the evidence given
by Mrs. Chisholm before a Committee of the House of Lords on
Colonisation. On this evidence I wrote an article,* which led to
my making the acquaintance and acquiring the friendship of
Captain and Mrs. Chisholm, to whom I am indebted for a great and
rapid advance in what I may call my colonial education. In the
second monthly series of my "Emigrants' Journal," in the
following year, I may be permitted to say I communicated to my
countrymen a valuable contribution in placing before them the
first published account of the work done by Caroline Chisholm.
This Memoir subsequently formed the staple of all the biographies
of that lady which have appeared, including one in "Chambers'
Journal," and a paper I had the pleasure of contributing to
"Household Words," entitled "Better Ties than Red Tape Ties."</p>
<p class="foot">[* No. 8, Sidney's "Emigrants' Journal."]</p>
<p>In January, 1850, I published "A Letter to the Right
Honourable Sidney Herbert," on the need of protection for female
emigrants, and the necessity for a more careful selection of
surgeons in emigrant ships, illustrating my arguments with
evidence from Blue Books. Subsequent events proved the
reasonableness of my warnings in a very flagrant manner.</p>
<p>On April 17th of the same year a great meeting took place at
St. Martin's Hall to launch the last, the most improved plan for
colonising Canterbury, in New Zealand, under the Wakefield
system, which had so signally failed in South Australia and three
other New Zealand colonies. Having during the three preceding
years been engaged almost alone in dissecting and exposing this
antipodean form of protection and monopoly, I travelled all night
from Lincoln, in order to meet the colonising protectionists face
to face. I found a platform crowded with Bishops and dignitaries
of the Church, Peers, Members of Parliament; in the body of the
room some two thousand Clergymen, many Members of the two
Universities, and elegantly-dressed ladies. Except a small group
at the end of the room, all seemed firm believers in Gibbon
Wakefield and model High Church colonisation. I had not had time
to obtain the company of a single friend; but when the Bishop of
Norwich, Dr. Hinde, ventured to point to Adelaide, Wellington,
and Nelson as instances of colonies where "the Wakefield system"
had been tried with eminent success, and when Lord Lyttleton,
before putting the resolution, invited "the questions or
observations of any gentleman," I found courage to rise, and to
tell intending colonists that ruin had fallen on all who
colonised on the principles embodied in the bishop's resolution,
to bid them refer to parliamentary documents for details of the
sufferings of South Australian and New Zealand land purchasers,
and to say&mdash;"I wish you intending colonists to understand
that this Canterbury Colony is founded on the principle of
creating artificial advantages for those who work with their head
and not with their hand that there is no instance of a colonist
in any country employing his capital in agriculture as proposed
at Canterbury, and obtaining either low-priced labour, or fair
profit on his investment&mdash;while in pastoral pursuits the
purchase of land is unnecessary, and concentration impossible;"
and I concluded by observing&mdash;"If the colonisers wanted to
have the best bone and sinew of the country, they must not adopt
an exclusive system, under which no man with less than £500 could
become the purchaser of fifty acres, for that, according to my
experience, the best emigrants were men with large families and
very moderate means, who could till land with their own hands to
a profit, but were not willing to emigrate to become mere hewers
of wood and drawers of water."</p>
<p>It would be difficult to give any idea of the effect produced
by the incontrovertible facts and figures of my unexpected
opposition. The Bishop of Oxford made a most brilliant and
amusing reply, in which rhetoric supplied the place of facts and
arguments; Mr. Adderley, an amiable enthusiast&mdash;pretended to
believe that I was recommending the wild, free grants of Swan
River, or the churchless, school-less colonisation of New South
Wales. But not one of the whole array of model colonisers was
able to answer my simple question, "How are Canterbury colonists
to earn a living and obtain a return for capital invested after
the rate of £3 an acre? Not by agriculture, for colonial
experience proves that except to the peasant proprietor
agriculture will not pay. If pastoral pursuits are relied upon,
no land will be purchased by sane men, and the assumed advantages
of concentration, with the funds for churches, bishoprics,
schools and libraries, can never be realised."</p>
<p>The part I took on this occasion exposed me, as I expected it
would, to a good deal of petty persecution from the New Zealand
clique&mdash;to an attack from the "Spectator," and other organs
of Mr. Wakefield's last bubble; but it secured me, I rejoice to
add, the warm thanks of several intending colonists, and the
friendship of some men whose friendship is worth deserving.</p>
<p>My worst forebodings have long since been confirmed by the
letters of unfortunate Canterbury colonists. They find all the
money spent on agriculture wasted, but have good hopes from
pastoral pursuits on the fine grassy plains, which they once
dreamed of converting into Lothian or Norfolk farms.</p>
<p>My next exertions in the cause of colonisation were devoted to
the assistance of my friends, Captain and Mrs. Chisholm, in their
labours to establish Family Colonisation. In this occupation I
was enabled to extend still further my knowledge of Australia,
and of the emigrating classes.</p>
<p>Thus, I claim the merit, if merit there be, of having written
a Hand-Book of Emigration in a style before unknown, but since
popular and common, viz., a style plain and practical, candid as
to the defects of the colony, and explicit as to the hardships of
the colonist; * of having, during a series of years, criticised,
exposed, and successfully attacked the fallacies and frauds of
the Wakefield system&mdash;all the time unsupported by the press,
and opposed by the powerful and unscrupulous vested interests of
colonising companies since insolvent and defunct; of having saved
a considerable number of most respectable persons from losing
their money, their time, their health, and their hopes, in the
Canterbury colony;&mdash;of having done my utmost to make, public
and popular those common sense principles of self-supporting
Family Colonisation, and to carry out those essential reforms in
the shipping department of emigration to which my excellent
friends, Captain and Mrs. Chisholm, have devoted six active years
of their lives.</p>
<p class="foot">[* All Hand-Books of Emigration, previous to
1848, whether of Australia. New Zealand, or America, were mere
puffs, written in the spirit of a recruiting crimp.]</p>
<p>In conclusion I take leave to state, as misrepresentations
have been circulated on the subject, that except by the profits
of my books and literary contributions, I have never derived any
benefit, either directly or indirectly, from my share in
emigration agitation. My "Emigrants' Journal" barely paid its
necessary expenses. My pamphlets were, as pamphlets always are, a
source of expense. From my "Hand-Book" and miscellaneous
contributions, I of course derived considerable advantage; but it
has been from hard work of another kind that I have been able to
earn that moderate income which renders me independent of
colonising companies and patronising shipowners, and indifferent
to those official attractions to which so many who take part in
colonial questions early succumb, and which has enabled me to
wait for the success that sooner or later crowns the reputation
of those who struggle for truth and justice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<h4>AUSTRALIA FROM 1520 TO 1770.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Australia</span>&mdash;New South
Wales&mdash;Botany Bay. These are the names under which, within
the memory of men of middle age, a great island-continent at the
antipodes has been explored, settled, and advanced from the
condition of a mere gaol, or sink, on which our surplus felonry
was poured&mdash;a sheep-walk tended by nomadic burglars&mdash;to
be the wealthiest offset of the British crown a land of promise
for the adventurous&mdash;a home of peace and independence for
the industrious an El Dorado and an Arcadia combined, where the
hardest and and the easiest best-paid employments are to be
found; where every striving man who rears a race of industrious
children may sit under the shadow of his own vine and his own
fig-tree&mdash;not without work, but with little
care&mdash;living on his own land, looking down the valleys to
his herds, and towards the hills to his flocks, amid the humming
of bees which know no winter.</p>
<p>Under the genial variations of the climate of Australia all
the productions of southern and temperate latitudes
flourish&mdash;the palm and the oak, the potato and the yam, the
orange and the apple, wheat and Indian corn. Over her boundless
pastures millions of sheep wander&mdash;sheep of "noble race,"
whose feet, according to the Spanish proverb, "turn all the earth
they touch to gold;" cattle by tens of thousands, that may
compare with the best of Durham, or Hereford, or Devon; and
horses as swift and untiring as ever bounded over the stony
deserts of Arabia. In her mountain ridges and river beds gold is
gathered in greater profusion than Cortes or Pizarro dreamed
gathered without shedding one drop of blood. Peaceful seas
surround&mdash;safe harbours give access to&mdash;this goodly
land, which may be traversed inland for hundreds of miles on foot
or horseback. No ravenous wild beasts threaten or affright the
timid. The aborigines are few, and quick to learn submission.</p>
<p>The hard work of colonisation has been done; the road has been
smoothed, and made ready; yet is there ample verge and room
enough for millions to follow in the track of the thousands who
have conquered and subdued the earth, and planted and reared, not
only corn and cattle, but an English race, imbued with English
traditions, taught by English literature, enjoying English
institutions, and practising English love of order and obedience
to law while cherishing the firmest attachment to liberty.</p>
<p>With these elements of social and political prosperity, only
needing for full development a tide of population which this
country can well spare, it cannot be doubted that a very few
years will transform what our fathers considered the meanest,
into the greatest of Britain's dependencies; and that, at a
period when Continental Europe seems retrograding into deeper
than medieval darkness and despotism; side by side in friendly
rivalry with the great American republic, we shall realise the
threat of the baffled statesman (when the rising liberties of
Spain were crushed under the armies of the soon-to-be-exiled
Bourbon), and "call a new world into existence to redress the
balance of the old" *&mdash;a new field for the employment of
able-bodied industry, which, overflowing from the crowded
competition of Europe, may there help on the march of
unrestricted commerce by digging capital out of the soil, or, at
less exercise of strength, produce choice raw material for the
triumphs of machinery.</p>
<p class="foot">[* George Canning.]</p>
<p>For some fifteen years armies of emigrants have annually
proceeded in greater or less numbers to the Australian colonies,
yet it is but recently, that the general public have cared to
inquire more than how bread was to be earned or how capital
invested. Late discoveries have invested these dependencies with
new importance in the eyes of all who follow with interest the
progress of the Anglo-Saxon race. The time seems propitious for
attempting not only to describe the features, the resources, and
the prospects of these colonies, but to trace the series of
political, social, and commercial events by which an
insignificant penal settlement in the most distant quarter of the
globe, supported at great cost by the parent state, has given
birth to a cluster of prosperous self-supporting colonies,
largely contributing, directly find indirectly, to the imperial
revenues, by the production of wool and gold, by the consumption
of British manufactures, and by the employment of any amount of
labour that can be landed on their shores.</p>
<p>The name "Australia," now universally adopted to designate the
whole island-continent, was suggested by the gallant,
unfortunate, and ill-requited Flinders, in his "Account of a
Voyage of Discovery to Terra Australis," a work from which almost
all writers on Australian geography have copied their outlines of
the progress of discovery, previous to the voyage of Captain
Cook.</p>
<p>The Dutch, who first explored the whole northern coast, called
it New Holland in their own language. Captain Cook, after sailing
round the south-eastern coast, gave it the name of New South
Wales, from a supposed resemblance to that part of Great Britain,
and by that name the whole island was known in English works
until other settlements were formed. But colloquially, until very
recently, Botany Bay, the first landing-place of Captain Cook,
was vulgarly and popularly the designation given to Australia,
although no settlement was ever formed there; and it remains to
this day a swampy suburb, about an hour's ride from Sydney, from
which part of the water for the supply of that city is obtained,
and where idlers resort, to drink, smoke, and play quoits.</p>
<p>Port Phillip, the name first given to the great bay on which
are the ports of Geelong and Melbourne,* after Captain Phillip,
first governor of New South Wales, has been applied to the whole
province; and although, by the act of Parliament which created it
a separate colony, the name of Victoria has been affixed to this
region, it will be long before the old inhabitants will remember
or consent to give any other name than Port Phillip to the
district which Sir Thomas Mitchell endeavoured, not without
reason, to designate as Australia Felix.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Melbourne stands on the Yarra Yarra River,
navigable by steamers of two hundred tons. Larger vessels lie off
its mouth, in Hobson's Bay.]</p>
<p>The act of Parliament that created the third colony fixed upon
it the vague name of South Australia.</p>
<p>Official and parliamentary documents have superseded the
original name of Swan River by Western Australia. Van Diemen's
Land retains its old Dutch name, although also occasionally more
conveniently known as Tasmania.</p>
<p>Dutch, Spanish, and English have succeeded in affixing nominal
marks of their discoveries on Australia, which is almost the last
country peopled by an European race; but the French, in spite of
efforts of great pains and cost, have been generally superseded,
although at one time they had appropriated all the discoveries of
Matthew Flinders.</p>
<p>The earliest authentic records of the discovery of any part of
Australia are Spanish. The traces supposed to be found by some
geographers in ancient charts of "Jave le Grand," and in a map
attached to certain editions of Marco Polo's travels, are too
obscure to deserve serious consideration.</p>
<p>That Chinese navigators knew of the existence of Northern
Australia at a very remote period, is more than probable, looking
at the unchanging habits of that people. They have formed a
settlement on the Island of Timor, distant only 250 miles from
Cape York, and are in the habit of resorting to the coast near
the abandoned settlement of Port Essington, to collect a Chinese
dainty, the trepang or sea slug.</p>
<p>Between 1520 and 1600 the Spaniards, in the course of their
voyages from their South American possessions, discovered several
islands of the Australian group; and in 1605 Pedro Fernandez de
Quiros and Luis Vaez de Torres made a voyage of discovery in two
ships. After finding land, which they named Terra del Esperito
Santo, now known as the New Hebrides, the ships parted company in
a gale of wind. Torres, the second in command, coasted along New
Guinea, and sailed through the dangerous straits which are still
the dread of the mariner in stormy seasons, and still bear his
name. He passed two months in this difficult navigation,
mistaking the portions of the coast of Australia which he sighted
for islands. Of this voyage he transmitted a full account in a
letter to the King of Spain; but, in accordance with the jealous
policy of the age, the record was suppressed, and the existence
of Torres Straits remained unknown until they were re-discovered
by Captain Cook in 1770.</p>
<p>During our war with Spain we captured Manilla by storm, and in
the archives of that city Mr. Alexander Dalrymple, the
historiographer of the British Admiralty, discovered a copy of
the letter to the King of Spain, which had been deposited there
by Torres. Dalrymple, with that right feeling which should
inspire all men of science, did justice to the discoverer by
inscribing on the official maps issued from his department,
against the intricate passage between Australia and New Guinea,
"Torres Straits."</p>
<p>About the same time that Quiros and Torres were pursuing their
investigation, the Dutch, then in the height of their maritime
power, were prosecuting voyages of discovery in the Indian and
Pacific Oceans.</p>
<p>From the instructions prepared for the guidance of Abel Janz
Tasman previous to his voyages in 1642 and 1644 (instructions
which were signed by the Governor-General Antonio Van Diemen, and
four members of the council, at Batavia), in which the previous
discoveries of the Dutch in New Guinea and the "Great South Land"
were recited, it appears that a Dutch yacht, on a voyage of
discovery in 1605-6, discovered the "South Land," mistaking it
for the west side of New Guinea; that a second expedition, in
1617, met with no success; and that, in 1623, a third, consisting
of the yachts Pera and Arnhem, was despatched from Amboyna, by
which were discovered "the great islands of Arnhem and Spult,"
being, in fact, the north of Australia, which still bears the
name of Arnhem's Land. Other records show that, up to 1626, the
Dutch had, either accidentally or by voyages of exploration,
discovered and given names to about half the coast of
Australia.</p>
<p>Many of these names are preserved to this day, for we have not
a passion for re-naming after the standard of our own
language.</p>
<p>The Gulf of Carpentaria is still called after General Peter
Carpenter, who explored it. At that period military titles were
indifferently applied to commanders at sea as on land; and
captains of ships then, as at present in the Russian navy, wore
spurs. The names of Arnhem, Tasman, De Witt, Endrachts, and Edel,
cover the whole of the coast of Northern Australia as far as
Sharks' Bay.</p>
<p>It is curious that none of these explorations led to any
permanent settlement; and that in this instance, as in many
others&mdash;in America, at the Cape, and in India&mdash;England
has reaped the fruits of Dutch industry and enterprise. That
industrious people have scarcely been more fortunate than the
indolent, anti-commercial Spaniard. The Dutch, of all their rich
colonial possessions, retain only Java, and the Spaniards Cuba.
The two new gold-fields discovered by Dutch and Spaniards,
Australia and California, have fallen into the hands of an
English-speaking race.</p>
<p>Of Tasman's voyage no account has ever been published. There
was found on one of the islands forming the roadstead called Dirk
Hartog's roadstead, at the entrance of Shark's Bay, in 1697, and
afterwards again in 1801, a pewter plate, attached to a decayed
log half sunk in earth, which bore two inscriptions in Dutch, of
different dates, of which the following are
translations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1616. On the 25th October the ship Endracht, of
Amsterdam, arrived here; first merchant, Gilles Miebais Van Luck;
Captain Dirk Hartog, of Amsterdam. She sailed on the 27th of the
same month for Bantam. Supercargo, Janstins; chief pilot, Peter
Ecores Van Due. Year 1616."</blockquote>
<p>The second inscription was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"1697. On the 4th February the ship Geelvink, of
Amsterdam, arrived here; Wilhelem de Flaming,
captain-commandante; John Bremen, of Copenhagen, assistant;
Michel Bloem Van Estoght, assistant. The dogger Nyptaught,
Captain Gerril Coldart, of Amsterdam; Theodore Hermans, of the
same place, assistant; first pilot, Gerritzen, of Bremen.<br>
<br>
"The galley Nel Wesetje, Cornelius de Plaming, of Vielandt,
commander; Coert Gerritzen, of Bremen, pilot. Our fleet sails
hence, leaving the southern territories for
Batavia."</blockquote>
<p>In 1642 Tasman discovered and sailed along the coast of the
Island of Van Diemen's Land, supposing it to be part of the
"South Land."</p>
<p>In successive investigations by Captain Marrion, of the French
navy, in 1772; by Captain Tobias, of the British service, in
1773; by Captain Cook, in 1777; and by the French Rear-Admiral
D'Entrecasteaux, the coast line to the south and east was further
explored; but the insularity of Van Diemen's Land, the harbour of
Port Jackson, and the Rivers Hunter, Brisbane, and Yarra, all
destined to be the outlets to important districts in future
colonies, remained undiscovered.</p>
<p>The many hundred leagues of coast so frequently visited by the
Dutch, had afforded no encouragement for the plantation of
settlements similar to those which they had founded with such
brilliant results in the Indian Seas.</p>
<p>The Commander Carstens, sent by the Dutch East India Company
to explore New Holland, describes it as "barren coasts, shallow
water, islands thinly peopled by cruel, poor, and brutal natives,
and of very little use to the company." Tasman's Land was
pronounced to be the abode of "howling evil spirits." In these
discouraging reports all mariners, until the time of Captain
Cook, agreed; which is not extraordinary, considering that, after
the time of Columbus, maritime discoverers sought lands in which
either gold was to be had for gathering, or where rich tropical
fruits abounded in pleasant arbours.</p>
<p>In New Holland the natives were hostile and miserably poor, in
the lowest state of human existence. They built no huts, wore no
ornaments of gold or precious stones, cultivated no ground. Their
barren, unfruitful coast, afforded no indigenous fruits for
barter; neither the yam, the cocoa, nor the pineapple, the lemon,
the citron, the gourd, nor indeed any other fruit grateful to
European taste.</p>
<p>As the Spaniards were the first, so the British were the last,
and (in their first attempts) the least successful; in exploring
the coast of Australia.</p>
<p>William Dampier, one of the boldest and most scientific
navigators of his age, author of a "Voyage Round the World," from
which Defoe drew many hints, visited New Holland three
times&mdash;on the first occasion with his companions the
buccaneers; again as pilot of H.M.S. Roebuck when he spent about
five weeks in ranging off and on the coast of New South Wales, a
length of about 300 leagues; on the third occasion he passed
through Torres Straits as pilot to Captain Woodes Rogers, in
1710, when he explored Sharks' Bay, the coasts of New Guinea, New
Britain, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In July, 1769, Captain James Cook, after having observed the
transit of Venus at Otaheite (or Tahiti), and cruised for a month
among the other Society Islands, sailed southwards in search of
the continent <i>Terra Australis Incognita</i>, which geographers
for a preceding century had calculated must exist somewhere
thereabouts, as a counterpoise to the great tract of land in the
northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>In this search he first visited the Islands of New Zealand,
which had been previously discovered by Tasman in 1662; he spent
six months in investigating them, and ascertained that they
consisted of two large islands.</p>
<p>Leaving New Zealand, and sailing westward, he sighted New
Holland on the 11th of April, 1770, and on the 27th anchored in
the roadstead to which he afterwards gave the name of Botany Bay.
On the following day he landed, with Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph)
Banks, President of the Royal Society, Dr. Solander, and a party
of seamen. They were all charmed with the bright verdure of the
scene, in which all natural objects the kangaroo bounding through
the open forest, the evergreen eucalypti, the grass-trees, the
birds&mdash;were unlike anything they had ever seen before in the
course of their voyages in various quarters of the globe.</p>
<p>After exploring the country for several days, during which a
favourable estimate was formed of the capabilities of the
district for supporting a colony,* and vainly endeavouring to
open a communication with natives, through Tupia, a South-sea
Islander, Cook sailed to the northward, passing without visiting
the opening into Port Jackson: taking it for a mere boat harbour,
he gave it the name of the look-out seamen who announced the
indentation in the dark, lofty, basaltic cliffs which open a
passage into that noble harbour.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The author of the narrative of Cook's first
voyage says: "It was oft account of the great quantity of plants
which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander collected in this place that
Lieutenant Cook was induced to give it the name of Botany Bay. In
cultivating the ground there would e no obstacle from the trees,
which are tall, straight, and without underwood, and stand a
sufficient distance from each other."]</p>
<p>On the 17th of May, Cook anchored in a bay to which he "gave
the name of Moreton Bay; and, at a place where the land was not
at that time visible, some on board, having observed that the sea
looked paler than usual, were of opinion that the bottom of the
bay opened into a river;" but Cook came to a contrary conclusion;
it was not until 1823 that the navigable River Brisbane, which
gives access to a fine pastoral country, was discovered.</p>
<p>Leaving Moreton Bay, Cook ran down the coast as far as Cape
York, taking possession in the usual form wherever he landed.
Afterwards passing between New Guinea and Australia, he proved,
as Torres had before him, that they were distinct islands.</p>
<p>Cook landed altogether five times on this coast&mdash;first at
Botany Bay, on the 28th of April, 1770; secondly on the 22nd of
May, when he shot a kind of bustard weighing 17 lbs., and named
the landing-place Bustard Bay; the third time on the 30th of May,
at a spot which, from the absence of water, he named Thirsty
Sound. The fourth time was on the 18th of June, 1770 (seven days
after his vessel, the Endeavour, had struck upon a coral rock),
at Endeavour River, where they refitted. It was during his stay
at Endeavour River that one of his crew came running to the boat
declaring that he had seen the devil, "as large as a one-gallon
keg, with horns and wings, yet he crept so slowly I might have
touched him if I had not been afeared." This "devil" was a
grey-headed vampyre. (See Engraving on next page.)</p>
<p>On the 21st of August of the same year, having passed and
named a point on the mainland "Cape York," Cook anchored, landed
for the fifth time on an island which lies in lat. 10° 30' S.,
and having ascertained that he had discovered, by ascending a
hill from whence he had a clear view of forty miles, an open
passage to the Indian Seas, before re-embarking took possession
in the following words:&mdash;</p>
<p>"As I am now about to quit the eastern coast of New Holland,
which I have coasted from lat. 38° to this place, and which I am
confident no European has ever seen before, I once more hoist
English colours; and, though I have already taken possession of
several parts, I now take possession of the whole of the eastern
coast, by the name of New South Wales (from its great similarity
to that part of the principality), in the right of my sovereign,
George the Third, King of Great Britain."</p>
<p>His men fired three volleys of firearms, which were answered
by the same number from the guns of the ship, and by three cheers
from the main shrouds, and, then re-embarking, he named the spot
Possession Island.</p>
<p>These explorations of Cook completed the circuit of the island
commenced and prosecuted from the beginning of the seventeenth
century by the Spanish and Dutch, with the exception of the coast
19 opposite Van Diemen's Land, which was reserved for the
enterprise of Flinders and Bass.</p>

<br>
<p>In his exploration of Australia, Cook's usual sagacity and
good fortune seem to have failed him, although his contributions
to our knowledge of an important navigation were of the most
valuable character. He selected Botany Bay, a dangerous harbour,
which must remain for many years an undrained swamp. He passed
without examination Port Jackson, the site of Sydney; Moreton
Bay, with its navigable river; and, concluding that Van Diemen's
Land was part of the Island of Australia, and the dividing
straits a deep bay, lost the opportunity of investigating the
great bay of Port Phillip, on the shores of which the most
flourishing colony in the British dominions is now rising. In
God's good providence the discovery was reserved for a fitting
time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>
<h4>ORIGIN OF TRANSPORTATION.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> accumulation of criminals in our
gaols at the close of the American war became an embarrassing
question for the county magistrates and the government. Projects
for the renewal of transportation, and its effect on criminals,
became a subject of discussion among statesmen and
philanthropists.</p>
<p>Banishment, from a very early period, was an ordinary
punishment, which permitted the sentenced to proceed to any
country he pleased. Thus, in Shakspere's "Richard II.:</p>

You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of death,<br>

Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</p>
<br>
<p>Even at the present day it is common, in Guernsey and Jersey,
to "banish a criminal to England;" that is to say, to land him at
Southampton, and then leave him free to go where he will so long
as he does not revisit the Channel Islands.</p>
<p>The first legislative trace of the punishment of
transportation is to be found in the 39th of Elizabeth, c. 4,
authorising the banishment of rogues and vagabonds. This act
James the First converted into an instrument of transportation to
America, in a letter written in 1619, addressed to the council of
the colony of Virginia, commanding them "to send a hundred
dissolute persons to Virginia, that the Knight-Marshal would
deliver to them for that purpose." These being the very class of
persons against whose introduction the celebrated hero of
Virginia, Captain John Smith, had specially protested. In the
same year, as a kind of counterpoise to these dissolute persons,
the Company sent ninety agreeable girls, young and incorrupt; and
again, in 1621, sixty more, "maids of virtuous education, young,
and handsome." The first lot of females brought 120 lbs. of
tobacco each, and the second, 150 lbs. each. 21</p>
<p>The first distinct notice of transportation is to be found in
the 18th of Charles II., c. 3, which gives the judges power, at
their discretion, to execute, or transport for life, the
moss-troopers of Cumberland or Northumberland. The punishment was
inflicted very frequently, in an illegal manner, up to the reign
of George the First, when its operation was extended and
legalised.</p>
<p>Defoe, who always drew the outlines of his stories from actual
life, no doubt gives a true picture of the life led by the
convicts in the American plantations in his "History of Moll
Flanders."</p>
<p>During the reign of James the Second, transportation, or
rather reduction to slavery, was a favourite, and to certain
parties a profitable, punishment.</p>
<p>Dr. Lingard quotes a petition setting forth that seventy
persons, apprehended on account of the Salisbury rising of
Penruddock and Grove, had, after a year's imprisonment, been sold
at Barbadoes for 1,550 lbs. of sugar a-piece, more or less,
according to their working faculties. Among them were divines,
officers, and gentlemen, who were represented as "grinding at the
mills, attending at the furnaces, and digging in that scorching
island, whipped at whipping-posts, and sleeping in sties worse
than hogs in England." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Lingard, xi. 143.]</p>
<p>After Argyle's defeat the planters were on the alert to obtain
white slaves, and were successful, Some of the common prisoners,
and others, who were Highlanders, were by the Privy Council
delivered to Mr. George Scott, of Petlockey, and other planters
in New Jersey, Jamaica.</p>
<p>After Monmouth's rebellion, Lord Sunderland wrote from
"Winser, Sept. 14th, 1685, to Judge Jeffries," to acquaint him
from the king that, of such persons as the judge should think
qualified for transportation, the following individuals were to
be furnished with these numbers:&mdash;Sir Philip Howard to have
200 (convicts); Sir Richard White, 200; Sir William Booth, 100;
Mr. Kendal, 100; Mr. Nipho, 100; Sir William Stapleton, 100; Sir
Christopher Musgrave, 100; a merchant, whose name Lord Sunderland
did not know, 100. Thus it was proposed to give away 1,000. The
King directed Chief Justice Jeffries to give orders for
delivering the said numbers "to the above persons respectively,
to be forthwith transported to some of his Majesty's southern
plantations, viz., Jamaica, Barbadoes, or any of the Leeward
Islands in America, to be kept there for the space of ten years
before they have their liberty. In the end, eight hundred and
forty-nine of Monmouth's followers, all from the west, were
sold." ** Macaulay's account of the traffic between the maids of
honour and the relatives of prisoners will be in the recollection
of all our readers, as well as the question of who was the Mr.
Penn who acted as broker.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Roberts' "Duke of Monmouth," vol. ii. p.
248.]</p>
<p>But the following Bristol legend of an incident in the life of
Jeffries proves that he did not permit aldermen to follow the
example of the maids of honour: "On his return from Taunton,
where his mornings were passed in sentencing to hanging and
burning, and his evenings with a congenial soul, Colonel Kirk, in
drinking, he stopped at Bristol. Now, the mayor, aldermen, and
justices of Bristol had been used to transport convicted
criminals to the American plantations, and sell them by way of
trade; and finding the commodity turn to good account, they
contrived a way to make it more plentiful. Their legal convicts
were but few, and the exportation inconsiderable: when,
therefore, any petty rogues and pilferers were brought before
them in a judicial capacity, they were sure to be terribly
threatened with hanging, and they had some diligent officers
attending, who could advise the ignorant, intimidated creatures
to pray for transportation, as the only way to save their lives;
and in general, by some means or other, the advice was followed:
then, without any more form, each alderman in turn took one, and
sold him for his own benefit; sometimes there even arose warm
disputes among them about the next turn. This trade had been
carried on unnoticed many years, when it came to the knowledge of
the Lord Chief Justice, who, finding upon inquiry that the mayor
was equally involved with the rest of his brethren in this
outrageous practice, made him descend from the bench where he was
sitting, and stand at the bar in his scarlet and furs, and plead
like any common criminal."</p>
<p>This system, and the demand for labour, led to frequent cases
of kidnapping of the poor and friendless, and of parties who had
made themselves obnoxious to powerful and unscrupulous
individuals. Thus debtors disencumbered themselves of their
creditors, wives of their husbands, and guardians of their wards.
Even in vengeance the commercial spirit of Britain was displayed:
while the Italian stabbed or poisoned his enemy, the Englishman
sold him for a soldier, a sailor, or a slave.</p>
<p>Before the commencement of the American war of independence,
the introduction of the more docile and laborious negro had
rendered the American planters hostile to the importation of
white convicts. The war put a stop to the traffic in white flesh,
and crowded our gaols. At the same period the prison labours of
Howard commenced. In his vocation he personally examined every
place of imprisonment. He found the convicted prisoner, money in
his purse, revelling in debauchery, while the untried poor man
was half starved, lodged on damp stones, exposed, from unglazed
windows, to every blast, and crowded promiscuously with the
vilest of mankind in deep dungeons, where fever and foul
pestilence ever smouldered. Sometimes a black assize swept away
prisoners, gaolers, and even judges. The barbarity of the system
may be appreciated from the circumstance that Howard considered
he had achieved a great triumph, when he at length obtained an
order for a daily allowance of a penny loaf and small piece of
cheese for each untried prisoner.</p>
<p>Howard was anxious to establish reformatory prisons or
penitentiaries, but his humane schemes met with little favour.
With the experience we have since had, we cannot imagine that he
could have had any success, except in establishing a clean and
wholesome system of management.</p>
<p>The country was no more prepared then than it is at present,
to permit desperate ruffians to be unloosed to renew their crimes
on the expiration of their terms of imprisonment. But no one then
contemplated the construction of prisons like Reading, as costly
and comfortable palaces, in which the hard-labour test would
consist in composing moral essays, and collating texts of
Scripture.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Reading Gaol, Berks.]</p>
<p>The annual accumulation of roguery was to be got rid of! That
was the problem; and, so long as it was solved, few cared how.
Hanging had been stretched to its utmost limits; transportation
had been checked by the revolt of a country which decided to
employ no slaves who had not at least 25 per cent. of black blood
in their veins, and to receive no rogues except those who had
escaped unconvicted.</p>
<p>Under these difficult circumstances, a proposition for
"shovelling" out our criminals on the shores of the antipodes,
recently re-discovered by Cook, was eagerly entertained. There it
was presumed, on very insufficient grounds, the place of
punishment could be rendered self-supporting; at any rate, the
prisoners would cease to be a nuisance to the life and property
of this country. Howard opposed the project, but his opposition
was fortunately unheeded, although founded on very sufficient
grounds.</p>
<p>When we now examine the population, the wealth, the commerce,
the sources of annually increasing power and prosperity of the
Australian colonies, and the undeniable elements of empire which
they enjoy, it is scarcely possible to believe that the first
settlement was formed with the overflowings of our gaols and the
sweepings of our streets; that, for a long series of years, its
very existence was dependent on supplies of food, which the
famine resulting from a month's delay of a store-ship would have
rendered useless, and on grants of money, voted at a time when
votes, except on the grand field-days of contending parties, were
passed undiscussed in Parliament and unreported in
newspapers.</p>
<p>At this day, when care for the health, education, and
religious instruction of criminals is carried to an extent which
shows, in painful relief, the neglect our peasantry endure, it is
with amazement and horror that we look back on the cool, careless
indifference with which the ministers of George the Third, in
1797, set about founding a penal settlement at the opposite side
of the world.</p>
<p>Captain Cook and his companions had passed a few days on the
intended site of the proposed penal colony, and had found a small
river, a profusion of curious plants, and an indifferent harbour.
They had not seen any plains of pasture fit to feed live stock;
they had found no large edible animals, such as deer, or
buffaloes, or pigs. They had no means of ascertaining whether the
soil was capable of carrying crops for the support of a
considerable population; and the nearest land at which live stock
and dry stores could be procured was the Cape of Good Hope, a
colony in the possession of the Dutch.</p>
<p>As little judgment, as little forethought, as little common
humanity, was displayed in selecting the colonists as the colony.
The first detachment consisted of the first governor, Captain
Arthur Phillip, R.N., with a guard of marines, viz., a
major-commandant, twelve subalterns, and twenty-four
non-commissioned officers, one hundred and sixty-eight rank and
file, with forty women, their wives. These were the unconvicted
section of the intended colony. The prisoners were six hundred
men, and two hundred and fifty women, the latter being not only
the most abandoned of their sex, but many of them aged, infirm,
and even idiotic. This fearful disproportion of sexes was
maintained, and even increased, until the proportion of men to
women was as six to one, and the results became too horrible to
be here recorded.</p>
<p>This "goodly company" was embarked in a frigate, the Sirius,
an armed tender, three store-ships, and six transports, under the
command of Captain Hunter. At the last moment, by an
afterthought, one chaplain was sent on board. There was no
schoolmaster, no superintendent, or gaolers, or overseers, except
marines with muskets loaded in case of revolt. No agriculturist
was sent to teach the highwaymen and pickpockets to plough, and
delve, and sow. No system of discipline was planned, nothing
beyond mere coercion was attempted. Even the supply of mechanics
required for erecting the needful houses and stores was left a
matter of chance, dependent on the trades of the six hundred
felons; and, as it turned out, there were not half a dozen
carpenters, only one bricklayer, and not one mechanic in the
whole settlement capable of erecting a corn-mill.</p>
<p>The "first fleet" sailed on the 13th May, 1787, and, after a
voyage of eight months, during which they touched at the Cape de
Verd Islands, Rio de Janeiro, and the Cape of Good Hope, being
everywhere received with the greatest attention and courtesy,
anchored in Botany Bay on the 20th January, 1788.</p>
<p>Within four-and-twenty hours after landing, Governor Phillip
ascertained that Botany Bay was quite unsuitable for the site of
a colony, that a sufficient quantity of cultivable agricultural
land, and of fresh water, were wanting; and that the harbour was
unsafe for ships of burden. Without disembarking his charge, he
set out with a party of three boats, to explore the coast to the
northward, and particularly Broken Bay, an inlet favourably
mentioned by Captain Cook, distant about eighteen miles from
Botany Bay; but, as he sailed along the barrier of cliffs which
line the shore, he decided to examine the narrow cleft which Cook
had named Port Jackson.</p>
<p>The day was mild and serene. The expedition sailed along the
coast near enough to see, and hear the wild cries of, the
astonished natives, who followed them as far as the rugged nature
of the land would permit. As they approached Port Jackson, the
coast wore such an appearance that Captain Phillip fully expected
to find Captain Cook's unfavourable impressions realised; but he
was destined to be most agreeably disappointed.</p>
<p>The first tack carried the expedition out of the long heavy
swell of the Pacific Ocean into the smooth water of a canal
protected by two projecting "heads;" and soon they came within
sight of a vast land-locked lake, stretching as far as the eye
could reach, dotted with small islands, whose shores sloped,
forest-covered, down to the water's edge. Black swans and other
rare water-birds fluttered up as the white strangers sailed on,
charmed with a scene in which every feature was beautiful, yet
strange. They had discovered one of the finest harbours in the
world. Coasting round the shores of this great natural basin,
Governor Phillip determined to plant his colony on a promontory
where a small clear stream trickled into the salt water. After
three days spent in exploration, he returned to Botany Bay.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th January, as they were working out,
the English fleet were astonished by seeing two strange ships of
war sailing into the bay. These were the Boussole and Astrolabe,
the French expedition of discovery under the command of M. de la
Pérouse, which had left France in 1785. La Pérouse "had sailed
into Botany Bay by Captain Cook's chart, which lay before him on
the binnacle. Having heard at Kamtschatka of the intended
settlement, he had expected to have found a town built and market
established." Thus it was probably but by a few days that the
honour of discovering Port Jackson fell to England. The French
squadron remained until the 10th March to refresh and refit, and,
then departing, were never heard of more, until, in 1826, Mr.
Dillon discovered at the Manicola Islands traces of arms and
ornaments which proved their mournful fate&mdash;shipwrecked, and
murdered by savages.</p>
<p>A monument has been erected to the memory of La Pérouse and
his crew in Botany Bay.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>
<h4>GOVERNOR PHILLIP TO GOVERNOR KING.<br>
<br>
1788 TO 1806.</h4>
<p><span class="a">On</span> the 26th January the English fleet,
having been brought round, anchored in deep water close along the
shore of Sydney Cove, so called after Lord Sydney, one of the
lords of the Admiralty. A formal disembarkation took place a
detachment of marines and blue jackets leaping from their boats
into the shades of a primaeval forest. After hoisting British
colours "near where the colonnade in Bridge-street now stands,"
the proclamation and commission constituting the colony were
read, a salute of small arms was fired, and the career of the
province of New South Wales commenced. The whole party landed
amounted to one thousand and thirty souls, who encamped under
tents, and under and within hollow trees, "in a country
resembling the more woody parts of a deer park in England." Such
were the accidents of the foundation, and such the founders, of
our colonial empire in Australia.</p>
<p>No sooner had the convict colonists been disembarked, and the
erection of the necessary buildings commenced, than the want of a
sufficient body of artificers was experienced. The ships
furnished sixteen, and the prisoners twelve, carpenters; and by a
piece of unexpected good fortune, which caused much rejoicing,
"an experienced bricklayer was discovered among the convicts. He
was at once placed at the head of a party of labourers, with
orders to construct a number of brick huts: in the meantime the
governor occupied a tent."</p>
<p>This first example is a fair specimen of the manner in which
the penal discipline in the colony was conducted for a long
series of years. A useful man was placed in authority, and
allowed a variety of indulgences, quite irrespective of his moral
qualities. The greatest ruffians became overseers, and occupied
places of trust. Men of no use&mdash;mere drudges&mdash;were
treated worse than beasts of burden.</p>
<p>In the month of May the entire live stock of the colony,
public and private, consisted of&mdash;2 bulls, 5 cows, 1 horse,
3 mares, 3 colts, 29 sheep, 19 goats, 74 pigs, 5 rabbits, 18
turkeys, 29 geese, 35 ducks; 210 fowls. The cattle were of the
Cape breed, humpy on the shoulders, and long-horned&mdash;a fact
which it afterwards became of consequence to remember. In the
ensuing month it is recorded as a public calamity that two bulls
and four cows wandered away from the pickpocket herdsman who had
them in charge, and were lost in the woods. In the sequel it was
shown that the cattle were better colonists than their
owners.</p>
<p>The entrance to Port Jackson, as already partly described, is
through projecting capes, or two heads, which conceal and shelter
the far extent of the harbour. A channel, about two miles in
breadth, opens a land-locked harbour, about fifteen miles in
length, of irregular form, the shores jagged with inlets, coves,
and creeks, which, when the first adventurers landed, were
covered to the water's edge with the finest timber. At the
western extremity a current of fresh water mingling with the sea
tide gave signs of the winding Paramatta River, navigable for
vessels of small burden for eighteen miles.</p>
<p>The settlement was planted on the banks of an inlet or "cove,"
about half a mile in length, and a quarter in breadth, which
received a considerable stream of fresh water at the upper
end.</p>
<p>The native blacks, who then swarmed along the whole coast from
Botany Bay, and far beyond in either direction, came to meet the
white strangers naked, armed with the shield, the spear, and the
boomerang, which the settlers at first took for a wooden
sword.</p>
<p>From the circumstance of the aborigines not being subject to
the authority of any sort of government except that of the
strongest man, from the imperfection of their arms, and their
mental incapacity for combination, their communications and
skirmishes with the white intruders do not occupy that place in
the history of the colony which is filled by the Bed Indian
tribes in the history of North America, or the semi-civilised
Peruvians and Mexicans in that of Spanish South America.</p>
<p>On the 7th February, 1788, the king's commission for the
government of the "territory of New South Wales and its
dependencies" was read. By this instrument the colony was
declared "to extend from the northern extremity of the coast
called Cape York, in the latitude of 10° 37', to the southern
extremity of South Cape, in the latitude of 43° 39', including
all adjacent islands within those latitudes, and inland to the
westward as far as the 135th degree of east longitude." At the
same time were read the letters patent issued under the 27th
George III., cap. 56, for establishing courts of civil and
criminal judicature in the colony. Under these the
governor&mdash;or, in his absence, the lieutenant-governor was
authorised, whenever, and only when, he saw fit, to summon a
court of criminal jurisdiction, which was to be a court of
record, and to consist of the judge-advocate, and <i>six such
officers of the sea or land service</i> as the governor should
nominate by presents under hand and seal. This court was
empowered to inquire into and punish all crimes of whatever
nature; the punishment to be inflicted according to the laws of
England, as nearly as might be, considering and allowing for the
circumstances and situations of the settlement and its
inhabitants; the charge to be reduced to writing; witnesses to be
examined upon oath; the sentence of the court to be determined by
the opinion of the majority; but the punishment not to be
inflicted unless five members of the court concurred, until the
king's pleasure should be known; the provost-marshal to cause the
judgment under the governor's warrant.</p>
<p>In this court the judge-advocate was president (there was no
provision that he should be a man of legal education); he was
also to frame and exhibit the charge against the prisoner, to
have a vote in the court, and to be sworn like members of it. The
military officers were to appear in the insignia of
duty&mdash;sash and sword; they had the right to examine
witnesses as well as the judge-advocate; he alone centred in his
person the offices of prosecutor, judge, and jury.</p>
<p>There was also a civil court, consisting of the judge-advocate
and two inhabitants of the settlement, who were to be appointed
by the governor, "empowered to decide, in a summary manner, all
pleas of lands, houses, debts, contracts, and all personal pleas,
with authority to summon parties, upon complaint being made, to
examine the matter of such complaint by the oath of witnesses,
and to issue warrants of execution under the hand and seal of the
judge-advocate." From this court an appeal might be made to the
governor, and from him (where the property exceeded the value of
three hundred pounds) to the king in council. To this court was
likewise given authority to grant probates of wills, and
administration of the personal estates of intestate persons dying
within the settlement.</p>
<p>A vice-admiralty court was also established for the trial of
offences committed on the high seas. The governor was
captain-general and vice-admiral, with authority to hold general
courts-martial, to confirm and set aside sentences.</p>
<p>Powers equal to those of the first governor of New South
Wales, if held, have never been exercised by any other official
in the British dominions. He could sentence to five hundred
lashes, fine five hundred pounds, regulate customs and trade, fix
prices and wages, remit capital as well as other sentences,
bestow grants of land, and create a monopoly of any article of
necessity. All the labour in the colony was at his disposal; all
the land, all the stores, all the places of honour and profit;
and virtually all the justice, as the case of Governor Bligh
afterwards proved. The governor's subjects consisted of his
subordinates, officers&mdash;for, as captain-general, the
commandant of the troops was under his orders of the few who
resorted to New South Wales to trade (whose profits were at his
disposal), and the convicts&mdash;outcasts without civil rights.
The distance from England, the few means of communication, the
indifference of the English public to the fate of the inhabitants
of a penal or any other colony, rendered the governor, so far as
the control of law extended, actually irresponsible. As there was
no law, so there was no publicity and no public opinion to
restrain the exercise of the despotism which was the only
possible government in such a penal settlement.</p>
<p>The chief officers were naval and military, of the old school;
not the school of Cook and Keppel, Nelson and Collingwood, Wolfe
and Cornwallis, but of that school which, by its tyranny, its
abuse of power, its neglect of common honesty, of common decency,
and common humanity in the treatment, the wages, the clothing,
and the food of sailors, created the alarming mutinies of
Portsmouth and the Nore.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Portsmouth, May; the Nore, June, 1797.]</p>
<p>The powers vested in the governor were exercised without the
restraining influence of council or law adviser until 1822.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Charter of Justice was not formally
promulgated until the 17th May, 1824.]</p>
<p>Amazement and horror overcome us when we look back on the
early days of New South Wales. Under the absolute government
described, the settlers were crowded together on a narrow space a
promontory cleared of a dense forest. The soil was a barren sand;
every yard required for cultivation had to be gained by removing
enormous trees of a hardness that tried the temper of the best
axes, wielded in skilled hands. On one side was an unknown shore
and a shipless sea; on the other, an apparently limitless
country, inhabited by savages, in which not a step could be taken
without danger of being totally lost; a country which produced no
wild fruit or root fit for the sustenance of man; and, with the
exception of a wandering kangaroo, or a shy, swift emu, no game
of any size fit for food.</p>
<p>The want of enterprise which marked the early career of the
colonists, and left them so long in ignorance of the rich
districts on which, after a long interval, the colony became
self-supporting, cannot but be attributed to the form of
government and to the moral blight caused by the composition of
the society. The mass of the community were slaves&mdash;slaves
without the contented spirit of negroes or Russian serfs, for
they had been born in a free country, and could not learn to
submit and be happy, even if, in the matter of food and lodging,
they had been well provided, instead of being burned with heat,
perished with cold, and always half starved. They were slaves,
too, labouring hard, but scarcely producing anything.</p>
<p>The long voyage was a bad preparation for useful labour. The
convicts were heaped on board ship without selection, the vilest
and most venial criminals chained together. No classification of
degrees of crime, or for the purposes of useful labour, was
attempted. The overseers were prisoners selected by favouritism,
or for their bodily strength; and the work was divided between
personal service on the officers, handicraft, and mere
drudgery.</p>
<p>One chaplain of the Church of England enjoyed a salary for
preaching occasionally to an ignorant uninstructed multitude, of
whom one-third were Irish Roman Catholics, transported for
political or agrarian offences. Religious teaching, the bedside
prayer, the solemn call to repentance, were seldom heard in that
miserable Gomorrah.</p>
<p>Far from all civilising, humanising influences, in such
society the finest natures became brutalised into tyrants, while
the criminals under their command dragged on a miserable
existence or rebelled with all the dogged ruffianism of despair.
Although the chief records of the early days of the colony are
drawn from the writings and reports of officials, who were
naturally inclined to put the best face on a system of which they
were the paid instruments, and whose eyes, ears, consciences were
seared by constant contact with misery and tyranny, yet there is
more than enough testimony of the cruel and stupid despotism
which prevailed.</p>
<p>We learn from the journals of Howard, and the reports of the
parliamentary inquiries instituted through his influence, how
frightful were the abuses practised on tried and untried
prisoners at the close of the eighteenth century in England,
where the gaols were visited by numerous individuals of various
ranks, where the common-law rights of the subject had been
established, where what was considered in those clays a free
press flourished, where, from Sabbath to Sabbath, Christian
ministers assembled and led Christian congregations to prayer and
praise, where a parliament held its sittings whose orators made
Europe resound with their denunciations of tyranny, and where
laws were administered by incorruptible, independent judges. We
may more easily imagine how in New South Wales, where there was
no law but the law of the lash, tyranny became chronic, and
cruelty spread through the whole body corporate of the
colony.</p>
<p>A singular succession of serious, pitiable, ludicrous, and
disgraceful incidents, mark the history of the settlement, from
the day of proclaiming the king's commission to the end of the
year 1800, which has been minutely recorded by Collins. At one
time "a person named Smith, on his way to India, professing some
knowledge of agriculture," is engaged by the government, and
created a peace-officer at Rosehill, the site of the future town
of Paramatta, the said Smith being apparently the only freeman
with any claims to the kind of knowledge on which the subsistence
of the colony was likely to depend. At another time one Bryant, a
Devonshire prisoner, employed in his calling of a fisherman, is
detected in secreting and selling large quantities of fish, and
is severely punished; but, "being too useful a person to part
with, and send to the Brick Cart," he is retained to fish for the
settlement. This man afterwards escaped with his family and a
party of other prisoners in an open boat to the Island of Timor;
he was there captured by a mari-of-war, and carried to Batavia,
where he died. His wife was conveyed to England, tried, and
confined in Newgate until the term of her original sentence
expired.</p>
<p>Then we find convicts, "when little more than two years had
elapsed," claiming their discharge on the ground that the time of
their sentence had expired, which was possible, as it would date
from the day of their sentences. When, in answer to these claims,
inquiries are made for the documents containing the particulars,
"it is found that they have been left in England, and that,
therefore, it is impossible to affirm or deny the claims."
Consequently, the prisoners are told they must wait for an answer
to a despatch to be sent by the first opportunity to England, a
period of two or three years. One of the prisoners, not very well
pleased with the prospect of such delay, expresses himself
disrespectfully of the lieutenant-governor in the presence of the
governor. Thereupon he is seized, tried by a criminal court,
found guilty, and sentenced to receive six hundred lashes, and
wear irons for the space of six months. About the same time a
soldier having been found guilty of a horrible criminal assault
on a female child, his sentence is commuted to banishment for
life to the auxiliary agricultural settlement of Norfolk
Island.</p>
<p>These are but a few gems of the judicial system by which New
South Wales was ruled for nearly the first quarter of a century
of its existence.</p>
<p>In 1790, the third year of colonisation, four ships arrived
filled with convicts, of whom the greater number were in a dying
state: two hundred and sixty-one had died at sea; two hundred
were brought on shore in the last stage of exhaustion, from
scurvy, dysentery, fever, bad food, and foul air. In order to
save the parties in charge trouble, the men had been chained
together in rows, and confined below nearly throughout the
voyage. On board one of the ships, the Neptune, several of the
prisoners had died in irons; their companions concealed their
deaths in order to share the extra allowance of provisions, and
so slight was the supervision, that the horrible fact was not
discovered until betrayed by the offensiveness of
putrefaction.</p>
<p>Many years elapsed before a system was adopted by which the
preservation of the health of prisoners and troops became the
interest as well as the duty of the surgeon in charge. At that
time the more and the sooner prisoners died the more profitable
the transaction was to the contractor; so they commonly died like
rotten sheep.</p>
<p>Those were the days in which transportation really was a
punishment almost as terrible as death. New South Wales was then
an awful over-sea gaol, offering no prospect of advancement or
liberation; where the will of a prisoner-turnkey was law, where
death was the punishment of the most trifling crimes, and a
reproachful look was punished with the lash.</p>
<p>A few days before the four ships landed one thousand male and
two hundred arid fifty female convicts, the arrival of one
storeship, the Justinian, saved the whole colony from perishing
of famine. The Guardian, laden with a great supply of provisions,
stores, and live stock, under the command of Riou, "the gallant
good Riou," of Campbell's "Battle of Copenhagen," had struck on
an iceberg, and, after almost all the cargo had been thrown
overboard, was with difficulty carried into the Cape of Good
Hope. For weeks before the arrival of the Justinian, the whole
settlement had been put on short allowance, The governor, says
Collins, had thrown his store, 300 lbs. of flour, into the common
stock. The weekly allowance of each prisoner had been reduced to
2 lbs. of salt pork, 2½ lbs. of flour, and 2 lbs. of rice.
"Labour stood suspended for want of energy to proceed; the
countenances of the people plainly bespoke the hardships they
underwent." "Garden-robbing became prevalent; the most severe
measures were employed to repress the crime caused by, and yet
increasing, the effects of the scarcity, but in vain. A man
caught by the clergyman stealing potatoes was sentenced to three
hundred lashes, to have his rations of flour stopped for six
months, and to be chained for that period to two others caught
robbing the governor's garden; but this and many similar
punishments produced no more effect than the clemency of the
governor, who remitted three hundred out of four hundred lashes
to which one man was sentenced. The proverb that "hunger will
break through stone walls," was exemplified night and day.</p>
<p>"So great was the villany of the people, <i>or the necessity
of the times</i>, that a prisoner lying at the hospital from the
effects of punishment, part of which he had received, contrived
to get his irons off one leg, and in that state was caught
robbing a farm;" but the historian reports that at Rosehill,
where they had vegetables in abundance, no thefts were
committed.</p>
<p>The Justinian, which brought relief from this state of
destitution, was driven off Sydney Heads when within hail: it was
for some hours doubtful whether she would not strike and become a
total wreck on the reefs of Broken Bay. Had that event occurred,
and the twelve hundred and fifty additional convicts safely made
the port, death by starvation, or in a struggle for food, must
have been the fate of the whole settlement.</p>
<p>Could it be wondered if, under such a system of despotism,
without discipline in the colony, and in the face of such neglect
at home, the descendants of these men had grown fiercely disloyal
and anti-British? But yet it is not so. The Australians are a
loyal, order-loving, law-obeying race, as they have recently
proved more than once. Even gold-digging has not corrupted their
honest hearts.</p>
<p>It was not until five years after Governor Phillip's landing
that a temporary church was erected, and divine service performed
on the 25th August, 1793.</p>
<p>The founders of New England&mdash;themselves tyrannical and
intolerant, although flying from tyranny and
intolerance&mdash;did not let a week elapse without making
permanent arrangements for religious worship and education, which
endure to this day, and have spread their humanising influences
all over the wide empire of the American republic. In New South
Wales, under the rule of a sovereign which some, disparaging the
present, are accustomed to glorify as the reign of a specially
Christian king, the penalties of lash, the pillory, the gallows,
were administered as freely as teaching and preaching were
neglected.</p>
<p>It sounds strangely in this age to hear that "the clergyman
complaining of non-attendance at divine service," which was
generally performed in the open air, alike unsheltered from wind
and rain, as from the fervour of the summer's sun, "it was
ordered that three pounds of flour should be deducted from the
ration of each overseer, and two pounds from each labouring
convict who should not attend prayers once on each Sunday, unless
some reasonable excuse for absence should be assigned."</p>
<p>In 1791 (April) we find Mr. Schaffer, a German, arriving from
England as a superintendent of convicts; but on discovery that as
he spoke no English he was unable to discharge his duties, he
retired, and accepted a grant of land of 140 acres at Rosehill.
One cannot help feeling curious to know under whose patronage and
for what services a German, not speaking' English, was sent as
superintendent of convicts at the antipodes. Is it possible that
Miss Burney's friend, Madame Schwellenberg, could have had
anything to do with this little appointment?</p>
<p>At the same time James Ruse received a grant of a similar
quantity of land as a reward for being the first settler who
declared he was able to support himself on a farm he had occupied
fifteen months, and to dispense with an allowance from the
government stores.</p>
<p>These incidents, with the arrival, in two detachments, of a
regiment raised for the purpose of serving in the colony, under
the title of the New South Wales Corps, are the most remarkable
events during the latter years of the reign of Governor Phillip,
who resigned his office to Lieutenant-Governor Grose,* and
returned to England on the 11th December, 1792.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Major Grose was a son of the celebrated
antiquary.]</p>
<p>At that date there were sixty-seven settlers, holding under
grant three thousand four hundred and seventy acres, of which
four hundred and seventeen acres were in cultivation, and a
hundred more cleared. We have no means of ascertaining where all
these grants were situated, but the greater part is now occupied
as building land, and was miserably barren for agricultural
purposes, although covered with gigantic gum-trees.</p>
<p>This summary of the cultivation by free or freedmen settlers
is interesting, because it marks the first step towards rendering
the colony self-supporting. These settlers were, if they
required, victualled and clothed from the public store for
eighteen months from the time of their going on their grants,
furnished with tools and implements of husbandry, grain to sow
their grounds, such stock as could be spared from the public,
and, at the discretion of the governor, the use of as many
convicts as they would undertake to clothe, feed, and employ.
Every free or freed man had a hut erected on his farm at public
expense.</p>
<p>On ground of ordinary fertility, with settlers of average
industry, these terms would have insured early independence; but
the greater part of the district was and is as barren as the
sea-shore, and the majority of the settlers who were not idle
were perfectly ignorant of agriculture. The difficulties of
cutting down and removing the forest were so great that, without
the use of compulsory convict labour for a quarter of a century,
the Sydney district never could have been cleared.</p>
<p>During this period the government was obliged to carry on
cultivation as well as it could on public account, although with
indifferent success. A principle as old as the first step the
first tribes made toward civilisation&mdash;which, however, many
statesmen and economists even now appear not to
understand&mdash;was forcibly illustrated in the answer of a
settler, reproached with not having worked so well for the
joint-stock account as he did on his own grant of land&mdash;"We
are working for ourselves now."</p>
<p>The following were the prices of agricultural stock and
produce at the close of 1792:&mdash;Flour, 9d. per lb.; potatoes,
3d. per lb.; sheep (the Cape breed), £10 10s. each; milk goats,
£8 8s.; breeding sows, £7 7s. to £10 10s.; laying fowls, 10s.;
tea, 8s. to 16s. per lb.; sugar, 1s. 6d. per lb.; spirits, 12s.
to 20s. per gallon; porter, 1s. per quart.</p>
<p>At these famine prices the mortality among the convict
population was fearful. Between the 1st January and the 31st
December, 1792, there died two persons of the civil department,
six soldiers, four hundred and eighteen male convicts, eighteen
female convicts, and seventy-nine children.</p>
<p>Governor Phillip took with him to England two of the
aborigines, with whom, throughout the period of his government,
he had endeavoured to promote a good understanding&mdash;a task
involving great difficulties, arising from the brutality of the
convicts and the untameable nature of the savages. The tribes
that swarmed round Port Jackson and Botany Bay have, with one
exception, all died out; the character and customs of those who
survive in less settled districts remain unchanged, or at any
rate not more changed than the fox chained in a courtyard, or a
pheasant reared in an aviary.</p>
<p>In September, 1795, Governor Hunter arrived, superseded
Lieutenant-Governor Grose, and remained the usual term of five
years. His difficulties were less formidable than those of
Governor Phillip, which were not extravagantly rewarded by a
retiring pension of 500. His office was no sinecure. He had had a
large body of convict colonists under his command who would not
work, who would drink, and who were therefore dependent for
subsistence on supplies imported from England and India. By every
ship that left the harbour there was an attempt, generally
successful, to escape, on the part of convicts; fifty were taken
from one ship at a time "when the loss of the labour of one man
was important." It was no wonder that all who could, endeavoured
to fly from a colony where the population was annually put on
short allowance of food, and very often in danger of actual
starvation.</p>
<p>At this period, and for more than twenty years, spirits were
the ordinary currency of the colony. Almost all extra work was
paid for in spirits, and it was thought quite proper to stimulate
the diligence of prisoners, in unloading a vessel laden with
government stores, by giving half a pint of spirits to each.
Among free and bond, drunkenness was a prevailing vice. The
tyranny of the prisoner-overseers was so great that the
best-inclined convicts were goaded to recklessness and crime.
Criminal assaults on women were so common that "the poor
unfortunate victims were designated by a title expressive of the
insults they had received."</p>
<p>The whole population, on the arrival of Captain Hunter, with
the exception of one hundred and seventy-nine, were dependent on
the public stores for rations, many of the exceptions being
reputed thieves, presumed to subsist on plunder from stores and
gardens.</p>
<p>The most favourable feature of this epoch was the extension of
cultivation by settlers along the rich alluvial land on the banks
of the River Hawkesbury, one of the first districts which seemed
to yield a fair return to industry.</p>

<br>
<small>NEWCASTLE.&mdash;FROM A SKETCH BY J. A. JACKSON,
ESQ.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Among the events of this five years may be noted the use of a
printing-press, the discovery of the lost herd of cattle, and the
foundation of a settlement, called Newcastle, on the Coal or
Hunter's River.</p>
<p>A printing-press had been sent out with the first fleet, but
no printers. All public and private announcements were made in
manuscript, or by the bellman, until Governor Hunter discovered a
printer among his convict subjects, and established a government
gazette. In this age of newspapers, it seems incredible that a
number of officers and gentlemen should have been satisfied for
so many years without something in the shape of a newspaper; but
the colony was divided into slavedrivers and slaves, who were
equally content to spend their time in feeding pigs and getting
drunk.</p>
<p>The reports of the natives led the governor to send out as
scouts men employed as hunters, to collect fresh provisions for
public use; and they discovered, feeding on rich pastures on the
other side of the River Nepean, still known as Cow Pastures, a
herd of sixty cattle, the produce of the five cows and two bulls
lost in 1788.</p>
<p>To realise this sight, so pleasant to the eyes of men
condemned to perpetual rations of salt meat, rarely varied by
fresh pork, the governor himself set out on an expedition, and
tracked and viewed the herd with great delight. An old bull,
fiercely and obstinately charging, was slaughtered in
self-defence; he proved to be of the humpy-shouldered Cape breed
of the lost stock, which left no doubt of the identity of the
herd, and dispelled the notion of indigenous cattle. The party
made a delicious meal, and a few pounds were carried back
thirty-eight miles, over a rough road, to Paramatta, the rest
being left to the native dogs and hawks, with deep regret, "as
meat, fresh or salt, had long been a rarity with the poor sick in
the hospital." Many an Australian within the last ten years,
galloping through Cow Pastures to purchase the finest cattle at 2
a head to boil down for tallow, has been reminded of the time
when a bit of bull beef, that a well-bred dog would now reject,
was a luxury to a governor and his suite!</p>
<p>These wild cattle were preserved, and increased greatly,
dividing into "mobs," each under the charge of a victorious bull,
until the general increase of stock diminished their value. Many
were consumed by surrounding small settlers, and the rest, being
fierce and a nuisance, were destroyed by order of the government,
when beef ceased to be a luxury.</p>
<p>About the time these wild herds were discovered, three
miserable cows of the Indian breed sold for £189, and two years
afterwards two colonial ships were employed eight months in
bringing 51 cows, 3 bulls, and 90 sheep from the Cape, at a cost
exceeding the highest price ever paid for the finest
short-horns.</p>
<p>Governor Hunter, with the best intentions and an excusable
ignorance of the laws of political economy, more than once
endeavoured to fix the wages of labour, by a convention of
employers, and mutual agreement not to outbid each other. Harvest
wages were settled at 10s. a day; but we find, from frequent
proclamations, that the rule of supply and demand prevailed, and
labourers when much needed obtained "exorbitant terms," although
a reward and indemnity were offered to informers.</p>
<p>At this period officers were allowed the use of ten prisoners
for agricultural and three for domestic services, and so on in a
diminishing scale to every description of settler down to the
emancipist, who was allowed the use of <i>one</i> prisoner to
assist in tilling his grant. All these servants were fed and
clothed by the crown.</p>
<p>In 1797 the first school building was erected for the benefit
of three hundred children, and the chaplain, the Rev. Mr.
Johnson, began to catechise them after the service on each
Sunday.</p>
<p>That instruction was much needed among all classes there can
be no doubt; for on one occasion the sails of the public mill, by
which the corn of the settlers was gratuitously ground, were
stolen in the absence of the miller. On another, with a
superstition worthy of the middle ages, the authorities compelled
a soldier suspected of murdering his comrade to handle the dead
body, in order to see whether it would bleed, and so accuse
him.</p>
<p>In 1798 a great Irish expedition in search of China took
place. We laugh at it, yet it was not more foolish than many
expeditions and theories patronised in the nineteenth century. It
is also memorable for the foundation of the first brick church,
built on the model of the stables of a citizen's mansion, with
clock-tower.</p>
<p>A return made in this year shows 6,270 acres in crop with
wheat or maize, a much larger quantity of arable land in
proportion to the population than is now cultivated in any of the
Australian colonies. Among the more industrious settlers, George
Barrington, the celebrated pickpocket, figures as the owner of
twenty acres of wheat, thirteen sheep, fifty-five goats, and two
mares. He was a constable.</p>
<p>In the following year the colony was again threatened with
famine, partly owing to the deficiency of live stock, and partly
to the incurable barrenness of the Sydney district.</p>
<p>In 1800 Captain Hunter was superseded by Captain King.</p>
<p>Under Governor King the Female Orphan School was founded, and
the first issue of copper coin took place. The <i>Sydney Gazette
and New South Wales Advertiser</i>, the first Australian paper,
was founded by a prisoner, George Howe, and published by
authority in 1803. An insurrection of prisoners, two hundred and
fifty strong, armed with muskets, broke out at Castlehill, on the
4th March, 1804, and was defeated in fifteen minutes by Major
Johnstone, of the New South Wales Corps, with twenty-four men.
Sixty-seven insurgents fell on the field; ten were tried and five
hung.</p>
<p>A penal settlement was formed in Van Diemen's Land by Captain
Collins. In the first instance he proceeded to Port Phillip, but
unfortunately landed on the eastern arm, where there was a
deficiency of water; and being, as most military men are, a bad
colonist, he abandoned it and proceeded to the Derwent. Had he
made his way to the Yarra Yarra River the probability is that
Sydney would have become the second settlement; and, with the
profusion of white slave labour then available applied on the
fine agricultural land of Port Phillip, by this time a population
of several millions would have been established there.</p>
<p>1806 was signalised by the great flood on the River
Hawkesbury, on the banks of which the principal grain cultivation
of the colony was carried on. The Hawkesbury, in ordinary
periods, winds in a strangely tortuous course through a deep
valley, between the precipitous banks above which, on the
occurrence of heavy rains, it rises as much as thirty feet in a
very few hours. These floods are not periodical. Until 1806 none
of importance had occurred, and people had settled down on the
rich "interval" land, the deposit of former overflowings. Crops,
houses, and many colonists, were all swept away in one night.
Famine was the immediate result. The two-pound loaf rose to 5s.;
wheat fetched 80s. a bushel, and every vegetable in proportion. A
serious flood had occurred in 1801, but this far exceeded it. It
is difficult to teach caution in such matters.</p>
<p>This great flood on the Hawkesbury caused eventually a
complete rearrangement of the cultivation and occupation of that
district.</p>
<p>Calamities, according to popular prejudice, seldom come
single. It was certainly the casein New South Wales in 1806, for
the clock-tower fell, and Governor Bligh arrived. Captain King
resigned his command on the 13th of March.</p>
<h5>RECOLLECTIONS OF PRISONERS.</h5>
<p>On the Hawkesbury and its tributaries the first successful
agricultural colonists were planted, and there dwelt, in 1845, a
few representatives of the first fleeters. These settlers, whose
recollections * do not exactly tally with, although they confirm,
the history transmitted to us by Collins, are all in comfortable
circumstances&mdash;some positively wealthy. Among the last was
Mr. Smith, who always spoke his mind to high and low. He had been
free almost ever since he arrived in the colony, and had never
been "in trouble."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Extracted from the MSS., Voluntary Statements
of the People of New South Wales, collected by Mrs.
Chisholm.]</p>
<p>"He was an old man, with a large-featured, handsome, military
sort of face, of a red-brown complexion, shaved clean. His dress
consisted of a red flannel shirt, with a black bandana, tied
sailor-fashion, exposing his strong neck, and a pair of fustian
trousers. Out of compliment to the lady he once put on a blue
coat with gilt buttons, but, being evidently uncomfortable,
consented to take it off again. He refused to see the lady until
he learned that it was 'the Mrs. Chisholm;' being usually rough
to those he did not respect."</p>
<p>A Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, who had the reputation among the
prisoner population of never having spared any man in his anger,
or any woman in his lust, during the old flogging days, met Mr.
Smith, face to face, coming out of the bank in Sydney; and
holding out his hand said, "Come, shake hands, Mr. Smith, and let
bygones be bygones: I am glad to see you looking so well." Smith,
putting his hands behind him, answered, "I suppose, because I
have got a velvet waistcoat, and money in the bank, you want to
shake hands; but no! Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, it would take a
second resurrection to save such as thee." The doctor slunk
away.</p>

<br>
"I arrived in the colony fifty-six years since; it was Governor
Phillip's time, and I was fourteen years old; there were only
eight houses in the colony then. I know that myself and eighteen
others laid in a hollow tree for seventeen weeks, and cooked out
of a kettle with a wooden bottom: we used to stick it in a hole
in the ground, and make a fire round it. I was seven years in
service (bond), and then started working for a living wherever I
could get it. There was plenty of hardship then: I have often
taken grass, and pounded it, and made soup from a native dog. I
would eat anything then. For seventeen weeks I had only five
ounces of flour a day. We never got a full ration except when the
ship was in harbour. The motto was 'Kill them, or work them,
their provision will be in store.' Many a time have I been yoked
like a bullock with twenty or thirty others to drag along timber.
About eight hundred died in six months at a place called
Toongabbie, or Constitution-hill. I knew a man so weak, he was
thrown into the grave, when he said, 'Don't cover me up; I'm not
dead; for God's sake don't cover me up!' The overseer answered,
'D&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; your eyes, you'll die to-night, and we
shall have the trouble to come back again!' The man recovered;
his name is James Glasshouse, and he is now alive at
Richmond.<br>
<br>
"They used to have a large hole for the dead; once a day men were
sent down to collect the corpses of prisoners, and throw them in
without any ceremony or service. The native dogs used to come
down at night and fight and howl in packs, gnawing the poor dead
bodies.<br>
<br>
"The governor would order the lash at the rate of five hundred,
six hundred, or eight hundred; and if the men could have stood it
they would have had more. I knew a man hung <i>there and then</i>
for stealing a few biscuits, and another for stealing a duck
frock.* A man was condemned&mdash;no time&mdash;take him to the
tree, and hang him. The overseers were allowed to flog the men in
the fields. Often have men been taken from the gang, had fifty,
and sent back to work. Any man would have committed murder for a
month's provisions: I would have committed three (murders) for a
week's provisions! I was chained seven weeks on my back for being
out getting greens, wild herbs. The Rev. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
used to come it tightly to force some confession. Men were
obliged to tell lies to prevent their bowels from being cut out
by the lash.</blockquote>

5s. out of a tent.&mdash;Collins, p. 27, History of New South

men in a fortnight at the saw by overwork. We used to be taken in
large parties to raise a tree; when the body or the tree was
raised, he (old &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;) would call some of the men
away&mdash;then more; the men were bent double&mdash;they could
not bear it&mdash;they fell the tree on one or two, killed on the
spot. 'Take him away; put him in the ground!' There was no more
about it.<br>
<br>
"After seven years I got my liberty, and then started working
about for a living where I could get it. I stowed myself away on
board the Barrington, bound for Norfolk Island, with eighteen
others; it was not a penal settlement then. Governor King was
there. I had food plenty. I was overseer of the governor's
garden. Afterwards I went to live with old D'Arcy Wentworth,**

head of cattle; and about the same to my other son. I have also
got 80 acres&mdash;30 acres, 50, 75, beside my house, and some
fine cattle. We are never without a chest of tea in the house; we
use two in the year. I have paid £40 for a chest of tea in this

who was in the family way, with a rope round her, and duck her in
the water at Queen's-wharf. The laws were bad then. If a
gentleman wanted a man's wife, he would send the husband to
Norfolk Island. I have seen a man flogged for pulling six turnips
instead of five. One &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was overseer, the
biggest villain that ever lived delighted in torment. He used to
walk up and down and rub his hands when the blood ran. When he
walked out, the flogger walked behind him. He died a miserable
death maggots ate him up; not a man could be found to bury him. I
have seen six men executed for stealing 21 lbs. of flour. I have
seen a man struck when at work with a handspike, and killed on
the spot. I have seen men in tears round Governor
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, begging for food. He would mock them with
'Yes, yes, gentlemen; I'll make you comfortable; give you a
nightcap and a pair of stockings!'"<br>
<br>
Mrs. Smith was blind: she acted as she spoke, and wept on
recalling the horrors of her early life. The house was large, and
crowded with furniture. Smith presented Mrs. C. with a pistol as
a souvenir, which he pulled out of his belt, saying, "You may
depend on it!"</blockquote>

"I arrived in the third fleet on the 16th of October, 1791; it
was on a Sunday we landed. The ship's name was Barrington,
Captain Marsh. I was sent to Toongabbie. For nine months there I
was on five ounces of flour a day&mdash;when weighed out, barely
four; served daily. In those days we were yoked to draw timber,
twenty-five in gang. The sticks were six feet long; six men
abreast. We held the stick behind us, and dragged with our hands.
One man came ashore in the Pitt; his name was Dixon; he was a
guardsman. He was put to the drag; it soon did for him. He began
on a Thursday and died on the Saturday, as he was dragging a load
down Constitution-hill. There were thirteen hundred died there in
six months. Men used to carry trees on their shoulders. How they
used to die! The men were weak&mdash;dreadfully weak&mdash;for
want of food. A man named Gibraltar was hung for stealing a loaf
out of the governor's kitchen. He got down the chimney, stole the
loaf, had a trial, and was hung the next day at sunrise. At this
time a full ration was allowed to the governor's dog. This was

at night&mdash;twenty-five lashes each. On Sunday evening they
used to read the laws. If any man was found out of camp he got
twenty-five. The women used to be punished with iron collars. In

killed one. Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was a great tyrant. Mine is

<h3>CHAPTER [IV.]</h3>
<h4>THE DISCOVERIES OF FLINDERS AND BASS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">From</span> these doleful chronicles of
irresponsible tyranny, of crime, and famine, it is a relief to
turn and contemplate the heroism of the two men to whose
ill-rewarded enterprise the most brilliant discoveries on the
Australian coasts are due.</p>
<p>In 1795 Captain Hunter, who had commanded the "First Fleet,"
was sent out again to supersede Governor Phillip. Among the
gentlemen under his command were Matthew Flinders, midshipman;
and George Bass, surgeon. Flinders was born at Donington, in
Lincolnshire. He was a descendant of the Flemish colonists,
introduced by Henry VII., who first taught the English how to
turn desolate, heron-haunted swamps into rich pastures. From his
earliest years he displayed an adventurous and investigating
spirit. It is among the traditions of his family, that on the day
he was promoted from petticoats to "buttoned clothes," after
being lost for hours, he was found in the middle of one of the
sea marshes, his pockets stuffed with pebbles tracing the runlets
of water, "wanting to know where they came from." Being desirous
of entering the navy, he taught himself navigation from "Euclid"
and Robertson's "Elements," without the aid of a master. In 1793,
at the age of sixteen, he presented himself as a volunteer on
board the Scipio, Captain (afterwards Admiral) Pasley, by whom he
was placed on the quarter-deck, and at the instance of that
commander joined the Providence, Captain Bligh (afterwards so
infamous), engaged to carry bread-fruit trees to the West Indies.
In this voyage he was entrusted with the charge of the
chronometer, and took his first lesson in the construction of
charts.</p>
<p>On his return in the latter part of 1793, he joined the
Bellerophon, seventy-four, bearing the broad pendant of Sir
Thomas Pasley, to whom he acted as aide-de-camp in Lord Howe's
memorable victory of the 1st June, 1794. An account of this
action, with diagrams of the position of the two fleets at three
several periods of the day, drawn up by Flinders with neatness,
clearness, and minuteness, for which all his MSS. are remarkable,
are still in the possession of his surviving daughter. From the
Bellerophon he followed one of his officers, who took the command
of the Reliance, ordered to convey Governor Hunter to New South
Wales, and met in George Bass a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>When they arrived in the colony, seven years after the axes of
the "First Fleet" rang in the forests of Sydney Cove, little had
been done to work out in detail the investigations made previous
to the landing in Botany Bay. "Jervis Bay, indicated, but not
named, by him, had been entered by Lieutenant Bowen, and Port
Stephen had been examined; but the intermediate portions of the
coast, both north and south, were little further known than from
Captain Cook's general chart; and none of the more distant
openings, marked but not explored by that celebrated navigator,
had been seen."</p>
<p>The feelings of the colonists seem to have been expressed in a
touch of nature which escapes Collins in a note to his heavy,
grandiloquent History of New South Wales:&mdash;</p>
<p>"In many of these arms of Port Jackson, when sitting with my
companions at my ease in a boat, I have been struck with horror
at the bare idea of being lost in them, as, from the great
similarity of one cove to another, the recollection would he
bewildered in attempting to determine any relative situation.
Insanity would accelerate the miserable end that must ensue."</p>
<p>Within a month after their arrival in Port Jackson, in 1795,
Bass and Flinders set out in a little boat, eight feet long,
appropriately called the Tom Thumb, with a crew of one boy,
proceeded round to Botany Bay, and, ascending George's River,
explored its course twenty miles further than the survey had been
carried by Captain Hunter.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The MS. Journal of this Expedition is in the
possession of Mrs. Petrie, the daughter of Captain Flinders.]</p>
<p>On their return, a voyage to Norfolk Island interrupted
further proceedings until March, 1796, when they set out again in
the Tom Thumb to explore a large river, said to fall into the sea
some miles south of Botany Bay. They were absent eight days,
explored Port Hacking in the course of their expedition,
experienced great danger from the sea, and on land from the
savage tribes: as when "on a dark night, steering along an
unknown shore, guided by the sound of the sea breaking against
overhanging cliffs, without knowing where they should find
shelter, Mr. Bass kept the sheet of the sail in his hand, drawing
a few inches occasionally, when he saw a particularly heavy sea
following, I (Flinders) was steering with an oar, and it required
the utmost exertion and care to prevent broaching to; a single
wrong movement would have sent us to the bottom. The boy baled
out the water which, in spite of every care, the sea threw upon
us." On another occasion, when their little boat was tossed
upside down on the shore, saved from utter destruction by its
lightness&mdash;their muskets rusted and their powder
wet&mdash;Flinders amused the semi-hostile savages who surrounded
them by clipping their beards, while Bass dried the powder, and
obtained some much-needed fresh water.</p>
<p>In December, 1797, during the absence of Flinders, who had
been despatched to Norfolk Island, Bass obtained leave to make an
expedition to the southward, for which he was provided by the
governor with a whale-boat, six seamen from the ships, and six
weeks' provisions. With the assistance of occasional supplies of
petrels, fish, seals' flesh, a few geese and black swans, and by
abstinence, he managed to prolong his absence eleven weeks; and
in a boisterous climate, with an open boat, in spite of foul
winds, he explored six hundred miles of coast, discovered Western
Port and the fine district now known as Port Phillip, and
satisfied himself that Van Diemen's Land was separated from New
South Wales by the straits that now bear his name.</p>
<p>Bass, having returned on the 24th March, in September
following he sailed with Flinders, whom Governor Hunter had
placed in command of the Norfolk, a colonial-built sloop of
twenty-five tons, for the purpose of penetrating beyond Furneaux
Islands, and, should a strait be found, passing through it and
returning by the south of Van Diemen's Land. With a crew of eight
men they went through the straits, and returned to Port Jackson
in three months and two days, during which part of the coast of
Van Diemen's Land, including Port Dalrymple and the River Tamar,
was explored, and such information gained as led to founding a
settlement there in 1803-1804.</p>
<p>From this time we hear no more of Bass. We cannot learn that,
beyond inscribing his name on the straits between Port Phillip
and Van Diemen's Land, he received either reward or honour. He
left Sydney for England in 1802 as mate of a trading-vessel, and
there we lose all trace of him. Flinders, in his great work, when
describing the explorations made by his gallant and well-loved
comrade, speaks of him as no more.</p>
<p>Flinders obtained the rank of lieutenant, and sailed again in
1799, in the same small vessel, on a short voyage to explore the
coast to the north of Port Jackson, which he examined minutely as
far as 25°. He says, "Of the assistance of my able friend Bass I
was deprived, he having quitted the station to return to
England."</p>
<p>On Lieutenant Flinders's return to England, in the latter end
of 1800, the charts of the new discoveries, which Mr. Arrowsmith
pronounced the most perfect that had come before-him, were
published, and a plan proposed to Sir Joseph Banks for completing
the investigation of the coasts of Terra Australis was approved
by him and Earl Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>In February, 1801, Flinders was promoted to the rank of
commander, and appointed to the Investigator sloop. A proof of
the popularity of his character and the adventurous spirit of the
British sailor was given, when eleven men being required to
complete his crew, out of three hundred seamen on board the
Vice-Admiral's ship Zealand, two hundred and fifty
volunteered.</p>
<p>On July 18th he sailed from Spithead, furnished with a
passport from the French Government, which was granted after
precedents of similar protection afforded to Admiral La Pérouse,
and to Captain Cook, by the respective authorities in England and
France.</p>
<p>In consequence of this passport, Flinders received directions
from the Admiralty "to act in all respects towards French vessels
as if the two countries were not at war."</p>
<p>So miserably slow was the progress of the first Australian
colony that at this period, thirteen years after its foundation,
it was found necessary to take a supply of salt meat for eighteen
months, and to have a general supply of provisions for twelve
months more, to be sent after the departure of the Investigator,
and lodged in storehouses at Port Jackson for the sole use of the
Investigator.</p>
<p>Among the gentlemen who accompanied the expedition was William
Westall, landscape-painter.</p>
<p>A passport was also applied for by the French, and granted by
the English Government, to Captain Baudin, who was said to be
going round the world on a voyage of discovery.</p>
<p>In November, 1801, Captain Flinders sighted the coast of
Australia, and proceeded to examine the coast line hitherto
unexplored. In the course of his investigations he discovered and
surveyed King George's Sound, on which the settlement of Swan
River, or Western Australia, was planted in 1829; Port Lincoln,
where Sir J. Franklin, a kindred spirit, who was one of the
midshipmen in the Investigator, erected a monument to his old
commander; Kangaroo Island, Spencer's Gulf, and the coast line of
the country which, principally from his report, was selected for
the operations of the South Australian colonists; and sailed into
and surveyed Port Phillip, which had been discovered ten weeks
previously by a government schooner, the Lady Nelson, from Port
Jackson. Western Port, a bay in the district of Port Phillip, had
previously been discovered by Bass in his whale-boat.</p>
<p>In April, 1802, immediately after discovering and surveying
Spencer's Gulf, Port Lincoln, and Kangaroo Island, Captain
Flinders fell in with Captain Baudin and his ship La Géographe,*
which apparently, instead of sailing round the world, had sailed
direct for Australia; but, instead of pursuing further
discoveries from the point where the English navigators had
ended, they repaired to Van Diemen's Land, following the track of
their countryman, Admiral D'Entrecasteaux, and there remained
many months, thus losing the opportunity of discovering and
taking possession (which was the secret object of their voyage)
of more than one site for a colony; just as La Pérouse&mdash;a
very different man from Baudin lost by a few days the chance of
discovering Port Jackson.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The situation of the Investigator when I hove
to for the purpose of speaking Captain Baudin was 35° 40' south
and 138° 58' east. At the above situation, the discoveries by
Captain Baudin upon the south coast have their termination to the
west, as mine in the Investigator have to the eastward; yet
Monsieur Peron, naturalist to the French expedition, has laid a
claim for his nation to the discovery of all parts between
Western Port, in Bass's Straits, and Nuyts' Archipelago; and this
part of New South Wales is called Terre Napoleon; my Kangaroo
Island, which they openly adopted in the expedition, has been
converted into L'Isle Decrés; Spencer's Gulf is named Golfe
Bonaparte; the Gulf of St. Vincent, Golfe Josephine; and so on
along the whole coast to Cape Nuyts, not even the smallest island
being without some similar stamp of French discovery." Monsieur
Freycinet, First-lieutenant of the Géographe, said at the house
of Governor King, at Port Jackson, to Flinders, "'Captain, if we
had not been kept so long picking up shells and catching
butterflies at Van Diemen's Land, you would not have discovered
the south coast before us.' I believe M. Peron wrote from
overruling authority, and that it smote him to the
heart."&mdash;<i>Flinders' Voyage to Terra Australis</i>.]</p>
<p>From Port Phillip Bay Flinders returned to Sydney, where he
arrived the 9th of May, 1802. He sailed again the 22nd of July,
and, steering north, surveyed the great Barrier Reef, and made
the route clear and safe for future navigators through the Torres
Straits and round the shores of the great Gulf of Carpentaria,
and only ceased his labours on finding his ship "quite rotten."
After refreshing at the Island of Timor, he returned to Port
Jackson on the 9th of June, 1803, having lost many of his best
men.</p>
<p>No suitable ship to complete his survey was to be found in
Port Jackson, He therefore embarked in the Porpoise store-ship,
"in order to lay his charts and journals before the Admiralty,
and obtain, if possible, a ship to complete the examination of
Terra Australis."</p>
<p>The Porpoise was accompanied by two trading vessels, the Cato
and the Bridgwater. In passing through Torres Straits on the
night of the 17th of August, 1804, the Porpoise struck on a coral
reef, and "took a fearful heel over on her larboard beam-ends.
The Bridgwater was on the point of following, but, the Cato
giving way, the former, grazing, escaped, while the latter struck
and went over two cables' length from the Porpoise." The coward
captain of the Bridgwater, one Palmer, having escaped, sailed
away, in spite of the remonstrances of his mate, without making
an effort to aid his companions.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mr. Williams, the third mate of the
Bridgewater, kept a journal, from which the following particulars
of this unparalleled piece of cowardice on the part of Captain
Palmer are taken. After describing the situation of the Porpoise,
he says: "Though the noise of the surf was so tremendous, the
voice of the unfortunate Captain Flinders was heard, by the fifth
officer, to say, '<i>For God's sake, Captain Palmer, assist
me!</i>' I now volunteered my services to proceed in the cutter
if Captain Palmer would consent, to the aid of the Porpoise: he
did consent, but, while getting ready, he changed his mind . . .
. . . The boat was promised in the morning, for which I had every
refreshment that could be procured for the relief of my
unfortunate companions. We again stood off: at 7
<small>A.M</small>., from the mast-head, we saw the reef off the
two ships, and to leeward of them a sand-bank . . . . . . We all
rejoiced in the prospect of affording assistance to our
companions; but the captain ordered the ship to be put on the
other tack, and, sailing away, left them to their fate! I was
sent on shore at Tellicherry with the account of the loss of the
Cato and Porpoise. In giving this account, I did, for the first
time, disobey orders, and gave a contrary account; for I was
convinced that the crews of those ships were on the reef, and
that the account of their loss was given by Captain Palmer to
excuse his conduct. I wrote out the account and left it behind,
after having related it as differently as possible. This caused
many words, and ended in my leaving the ship, forfeiting my wages
and part of my clothes." So far young Williams: Palmer and his
ship were afterwards <i>lost at sea</i> In fact, they were never
afterwards heard of; Williams, by his honourable quarrel with his
captain, escaped this singularly retributive fate.]</p>
<p>Flinders took the command, safely landed the crew of the two
vessels on a sand-bank, of which a narrow space was clear at high
water collected stores, erected tents, formed an encampment, and
established a disciplined order of proceedings. The reef was a
mere patch of sand, about three hundred yards long and one
hundred broad, on which not a blade of vegetation was
growing.</p>
<p>It was determined that two decked boats, capable of conveying
all but one boat's crew, should be built from the materials of
the wreck, and that the largest cutter should be repaired and
despatched, under the charge of Captain Flinders, to Port
Jackson, a voyage of 750 miles.</p>
<p>On the 26th of August, a Friday, the cutter was launched,
named the Hope, and pushed off "amidst the cheers and good wishes
of those for whom we were going to seek relief. An <i>ensign with
the union downwards</i> had hitherto been kept hoisted as a
signal to Captain Palmer of our distress; but, in this moment of
enthusiasm, a seaman quitted the crowd, and, having obtained
permission, ran to the flagstaff, hauled aown the ensign, and
rehoisted it with the union in the upper canton. This symbolical
contempt for the Bridgwater, and of confidence in the success of
our voyage, I did not see without lively emotion."</p>
<p>Flinders safely reached Port Jackson on the 6th of September.
He returned in the only vessel he could obtain for his
purpose&mdash;a small leaky schooner, the Cumberland, of
twenty-nine tons burden&mdash;accompanied by two trading vessels,
on the 6th of October; and was received by his crew with frantic
cheers of joy, although his brother, Lieutenant Flinders, after
hearing that the rescue-ships were in sight, "calmly continued
his calculations on lunar observations until they came to
anchor."</p>
<p>In his absence the sailors had planted the reef with pumpkins,
oats, and maize, which were sprouting above the sand
flourishingly; and Flinders expresses his regret that he had not
"palm cocoa-nuts to plant, of which he thought ten thousand might
be usefully set in these seas, as warning-marks, and food for
shipwrecked mariners, as they will flourish within the spray of
the sea."</p>
<p>It is evident that Matthew Flinders in this, as in many other
instances, displayed the stuff of which a colonial governor
should be made. There have been very few among Australian rulers
who would have thought of the cocoa-nuts, especially at such a
moment: still less would they have inspired their men with the
same spirit.</p>
<p>In the miserable Cumberland, Flinders, intent on laying the
result of his researches before the Admiralty, set out on a
voyage of sixteen thousand miles to England. Every man of his
crew, except his clerk, volunteered to share the danger and
accompany him; but the leaky state of his craft compelled him
soon to seek shelter at the nearest port, and he put into the
Mauritius, relying-upon his passport. This would have been a
sufficient protection had the government of the island been in
the hands of a gentleman and man of honour; but the governor was
one De Caen, a low, malignant, envious, insolent wretch, who, to
the infinite disgust of many of his countrymen and companions in
arms, availed himself of the misfortune which had thrown Flinders
into his power to vent his spite on a nation he detested.</p>
<p>De Caen seized the Cumberland, took possession of the charts,
journals, and log-books, and detained Captain Flinders for six
years, during which period, in spite of the representations of
the French Admiral Linois, and of many of the most respectable
colonists, he treated him with every kind of cruelty and
indignity; and, after evading repeated orders for his release,
dismissed him as unceremoniously as he had seized him, detaining,
however one log-book, which Flinders was never able to recover.
In the meantime appeared an account of Captain Baudin's
voyages&mdash;the Captain Baudin who had received at Port Jackson
every kind of attention and information. In this work,
accompanied by an atlas, the discoveries of Flinders and Bass
were appropriated wholesale, and renamed.</p>
<p>Baudin had made about fifty leagues of discovery, and claimed
nine hundred leagues, part of which had been surveyed by the
Dutch a century before his time.</p>
<p>Flinders reached England in 1810, broken in health, but his
spirit of duty unimpaired. Under the regulations of the service
the time he had passed in unjust imprisonment could not count in
his professional employment. At length he petitioned the Prince
Regent for promotion, as an act of grace; but his prayer was
refused, and neither his widow nor his daughter were able to
obtain the pension to which his eminent services formed so strong
a claim.</p>
<p>Flinders devoted the last days of his broken health and
spirits to preparing his book and maps for the press&mdash;an
admirable work, which has been the foundation of every subsequent
exploration and colonisation in Australia, and died on the 14th
of July, 1814, on the very day his "Account of a Voyage to Terra
Australis" was published.</p>
<p>Of Flinders' noble fellow-labourer in the cause of
discovery&mdash;George Bass&mdash;we were unable to find any
published memorials, but while the first edition of this work was
passing through the hands of the reader for the press, a native
of Lincoln, he wrote to a relative and obtained the following
interesting particulars:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The mother of Mr. George Bass lived with them (the Calder
family) fourteen years, and died with them. Her son and only
child, George Bass, was born at Asworthy, near Sleaford, where
his father had a farm, and died when he was a boy, The widow and
son afterwards went to reside at Boston. From his boyhood he
showed a strong inclination for a seafaring life, to which his
widowed mother was much opposed. He was apprenticed to Mr.
Francis, a surgeon at Boston; and at the end of his
apprenticeship walked the hospitals and took his diploma with
honour. But his inclination for the sea being unsubdued,
according to a promise she made, she yielded to his wish, and
sank a considerable sum in fitting him out and buying a share in
a ship, which was totally lost. She was a fine, noble-minded
woman, of no ordinary intellect. Her son wrote her long-letters
containing full accounts of his discoveries. These came into the
possession of Miss Calder on the death of Mrs. Bass. A short time
ago she thought to take a peep at the letters, went to the old
box, but they were gone. The last time his mother heard of Bass
he was in the straits of China. She expected him many years,
thinking that he might be taken prisoner; but at last gave up all
hopes, concluding that he had been wrecked and drowned. He had
only been married three months when he sailed away never to
return. His widow is dead."</p>
<p>We have devoted thus much space to an imperfect record of the
labours of Flinders and Bass, as an act of justice towards two
men whose labours profit, but whose merits are scarcely known to
thousands of Australian colonists. In their silent paths they
were both heroes; who ventured and endured shipwreck, thirst,
famine, the attacks of black barbarians, and displayed not less
humanity than courage and sagacity while pursuing discoveries of
the highest possible importance to their country, with faint and
distant hopes of any reward other than that inherent feeling
which supports unknown or neglected genius and heroism&mdash;the
consciousness of power rightly exercised, of the "talent" put out
to interest tenfold&mdash;a hundredfold.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER [V.]</h3>
<h4>GOVERNOR BLIGH.<br>
<br>
1806 TO 1809.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Captain Bligh</span> appears to have received
his appointment as Governor of New South Wales as a reward for
his gallant conduct in successfully conducting an open boat, with
eighteen companions in misfortune, scantily provided with food
and water, 3,618 miles, to the Island of Timor, without the loss
of a single man, after being cast adrift by the mutineers of the
Bounty. No man could be more unfit for such an office. But
governors are appointed for the oddest reasons: sometimes because
they are distinguished soldiers or sailors: sometimes because
they have written a timely book or pamphlet; often because they
are related to some great personage, and, being in debt, want an
opportunity for saving money. But no matter for what cause, or by
what influence a governor is appointed, the most important
quality of all,-the temper of the candidate, is seldom taken into
account; and yet in the governor of a colony no talents can
compensate for a violent or spiteful temper.</p>
<p>Bligh had a very difficult task to perform. Almost the only
unconvicted colonists were the military and civil officers, and
their relatives, who formed a sort of Venetian oligarchy of
government and trade, and who, beside enjoying the lion's share
of grants of land and use of labour, had been accustomed to
divide with previous governors, at a price arbitrarily imposed
upon the importers, the cargoes of vessels as they arrived, and
enjoy the profits derived from distributing articles in demand
among the unprivileged settlers at a monopoly tariff. Spirits
formed a principal part of these cargoes, and it became the
interest of every civil and military officer in the colony that
the settlers, free and bond, should drink as much spirits as
possible. Bligh brought out instructions to put down this
traffic, and hence his immediate unpopularity. But he was a
specimen of the naval captain now happily nearly extinct violent
in temper, coarse in language, hating the military, despising the
civilians. To those of the humblest class who cringed before him
he could be generous of public land and public money; but to
those who dared resist, or even question his authority, he was
implacable.</p>
<p>At an earlier period in the career of the colony no one would
have ventured to question his acts, however tyrannical; but in
1806 the character of the settlement was slowly changing. A few
respectable free settlers had arrived under Governor King-. They
found profitable employment in growing produce for the use of the
government by the help of convicts, whom the government also fed
and clothed a very safe speculation. All the officials were, as
already observed, more or less engaged in barter; but some of the
New South Wales Corps had quitted the military service, in order
to betake themselves exclusively to agriculture and commerce.
Among these was John M'Arthur, formerly a lieutenant in that
regiment, a man of far-seeing views, great energy, great
intelligence, and indomitable courage.</p>
<p>M'Arthur observed the improvement produced by the climate of
New South Wales in the texture of the hairy Indian sheep, and
appreciated the value of the district called the Cow Pastures, on
which the produce of the lost herd of cattle were found feeding.
In 1793 he purchased eight fine-woolled sheep which had been sent
out by the Dutch Government to the Cape, and re-exported to
Sydney as the Dutch farmers preferred their own fat-tailed breed.
His purchase subjected him to much ridicule among his brother
colonists, who thought it more profitable to grow wheat or pigs
for sale at the commissariat stores.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image06" id="Image06"></a><img alt=""
src="1400441h-images/Image06.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MERINO RAM.</small></p>
<br>
<p>In 1803, in consequence of grievances of which he had to
complain at the hands of the colonial authorities, M'Arthur
visited England, and there not only obtained permission to
purchase a few pure Spanish merinos from the flock of George
III., at a time when the exportation of the merino from Spain was
a capital crime, and the breed was only to be procured by royal
favour, but produced such an effect on the Privy Council, before
whom he was examined on his wool projects, that he carried out to
the colony on his return an order for a grant of ten thousand
acres. This grant he selected on the banks of the Cowpasture
River, for he appreciated the discrimination of the lost herd
which had there fattened and increased while the colonists
starved. This spot has since become famous as "Camden," where the
first pure merinos were bred and the first vineyards planted in
New South Wales. To Camden, perhaps, future generations of
grateful Australians will make pilgrimages. For not greater
services the Greeks made of Jason a demi-god. No doubt the Golden
Fleece was shorn from a merino ram.</p>
<p>Soon after Bligh landed, Captain King introduced him to
M'Arthur, who invited the new governor to visit Camden and
inspect his flocks, the result of the crosses from the King's
merinos. The answer was a refusal in the language of the
forecastle, expressive of Bligh's contempt for all such
occupations. This was characteristic of the man. When the mother
and uncle of young Hey wood (a boy midshipman on board the
Bounty, who received a free pardon and afterwards rose to
distinction in the navy) entreated his aid in obtaining mercy for
one whose only crime had been not forcing his way through and
springing into the overladen boat, he answered in a few lines: "I
very much regret that so much baseness formed the character of a
young man I had a real regard for, and I hope to hear that his
friends can bear his loss without much concern."</p>
<p>It would be unnecessary to dwell upon Bligh's numerous acts of
cruelty and tyranny, were it not that his government was one of
the great epochs in the history of New South Wales. The results
of his despotism turned the attention of the English public to
the resources of the colony, and the defeat of his crowning act
of oppression enabled M'Arthur to change the destinies of
Australia, and make it, instead of a mere gaol, the finest
emigration field in the world.</p>
<p>A little anecdote related by Wentworth, culled from hundreds
floating in the colony at that period (1816), illustrates a form
of government and a state of society strangely at variance with
our notions of the rights of Englishmen. Governor Bligh, having
heard from his cowkeeper that the servant of an officer of the
staff had made some impertinent remarks because disappointed of
the customary supply of milk for his master, on the following
morning sent for the dissatisfied delinquent. Wondering and
trembling, he was ushered into the presence of his excellency,
was received with a condescending smile, and told that, as the
chief constable's house was on his way home, the governor had
merely sent for him to save a dragoon the trouble of going there
with a letter. The poor fellow, his mind relieved, respectfully
received the missive, delivered it, was immediately tied to the
triangles, and rewarded with twenty-five lashes from the
cat-o'-nine-tails.</p>
<p>After a career of two years, during which the person and
property of every class of the community were at the mercy of his
temper for the day, Governor Bligh proceeded with arbitrary
illegality to summon, arrest, and try Mr. M'Arthur, on a
frivolous charge of infringing the customs laws, hatched up for
the purpose of wreaking his long-smouldering spite.</p>
<p>M'Arthur having refused to notice an illegal summons, the
Advocate-General Atkins arrested him, lodged him in prison, and
proceeded to try him in a court over which he himself presided,
with the assistance of six officers of the New South Wales Corps.
This Atkins had been appointed by private interest in England,
had no knowledge of law, and was described in a private despatch
to the Secretary of State as "accustomed to inebriety, the
ridicule of the community, pronouncing sentences of death in
moments of intoxication, his knowledge of law insignificant,
subject to private inclination."</p>
<p>To supply his deficiency of legal knowledge he took for his
councillor and secretary a convict attorney of the name of
Crossley, transported for forgery.</p>
<p>With the help of this miscreant Atkins prepared a monster
indictment, charging M'Arthur with a series of
offences&mdash;from contempt of court up to high treason.
M'Arthur protested against being tried by a man who was at once
judge, juror, and prosecutor, beside having a private quarrel of
some years' standing with the prisoner. The judge-advocate
refused to receive the protest, and actually threatened to commit
him for words spoken in his own defence. Fortunately for the fate
of the colony, the six officers, who, with the advocate-general,
formed the court, sided with the prisoner. They admitted him to
bail, and repeatedly, in the most respectful terms, addressed the
governor, praying him to supersede Atkins and appoint an
impartial advocate-general. Bligh refused; perhaps he had no
power to adopt that step; but he could have put an end to
proceedings, which ought never to have been commenced, by
entering a <i>nolle prosequi</i>. But it was his object to crush
M'Arthur, so he persisted; and when he found the six officers of
the New South Wales Corps equally firm in protecting him, he
proposed to arrest and imprison the six officers on a charge of
high treason. At this stage of the proceedings the patience of
the colony was exhausted. On the 26th of January, 1806, Major
Johnstone, lieutenant-governor, commanding the New South Wales
Corps, who had been prevented by severe illness from attending to
the repeated summonses of the governor, rode into town. He was
surrounded by his friends and brother officers, who represented
to him the madly tyrannous course which the governor was bent
upon pursuing, and urged him to place the governor under
arrest.</p>
<p>In order to support him in taking this extreme step, the
following memorial was signed by every respectable settler then
in the town of Sydney:</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"<span class="a">Sir</span>,&mdash;The present
alarming state of the colony, in which every man's property,
liberty, and life are endangered, induces us most earnestly to
implore you instantly to place Governor Bligh under arrest, and
to assume the command of the colony. We pledge ourselves, at a
moment of less agitation, to come forward to support the measure
with our fortunes and our lives."</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after the presentation of this address, the drums
of the New South Wales Regiment beat to arms, the troops formed
in the barrack square, and then marched, with Major Johnstone at
their head bayonets fixed, colours flying, and band
playing&mdash;toward Government House, which they surrounded.
Mrs. Putland (afterwards married to General O'Connell, commander
of the forces in New South Wales), the widowed daughter of the
governor, courageously endeavoured to resist the entrance of the
insurgent officers through the Government gate: failing in that,
she tried to conceal her father under a bed, whence, after an
anxious search, he was dragged, and conducted, without personal
injury, to the presence of Major Johnstone, who immediately
placed him in custody, and assumed the command of the colony.
Thus ended the first act of this bloodless revolution&mdash;the
1688 of New South Wales. Had Bligh succeeded in his conspiracy to
ruin M'Arthur, the progress of the colony would have been
retarded for years. Up to 1845, wool of the breed introduced and
improved by the persevering experience of M'Arthur formed the
only certain staple export of Australia. Without fine-woolled
sheep Australia must have remained dependent for subsistence on
the commissariat expenditure, and would, perhaps, in a fit of
economy, have been abandoned, in favour of some penitentiary plan
or island prison nearer home.</p>
<p>Cowardice has been imputed to Bligh for concealing himself,
but without reason. He was neither king nor even commander to awe
the troops with his presence; and any man may be excused for
flying from an infuriated regiment; above all a man like Bligh,
conscious that there was scarcely an individual in the assemblage
which surrounded Government House whom he had not injured or
insulted.</p>
<p>Major Johnstone transmitted to the Secretary of State a full
account of the events which had forced upon him the government of
the colony. Lieutenant-Governor Foveaux, arriving from England
ignorant of the insurrection, superseded Major Johnstone, and was
himself superseded by Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, who arrived
from Van Diemen's Land on the 1st July, 1809; by him Governor
Bligh's arrest was continued until the 4th February, when the
colonel agreed to put him in possession of his ship, the
Porpoise, on condition that he should embark on the 20th, and
proceed to England without touching at any part of the territory
of New South Wales, and not return until he should have received
the instructions of his Majesty's ministers. Released from
arrest, Bligh treated engagements entered into under duress as
void, and lingered on the coast for some time, in hopes of
provoking a movement in his favour. He afterwards repaired to Van
Diemen's Land, where he was at first treated with much attention,
but, on communications arriving from the lieutenant-governor at
Sydney, was constrained to remain on board his ship.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine the sensation created in the king's
cabinet when they learned that the gaol colony of Botany Bay had
imitated our forefathers of 1688, and, after sending a tyrant
unscathed packing, had continued the government of the colony
with a new governor and new officials, without bloodshed or
plunder. Vigorous measures were decided on, and an able man was
selected to execute them.</p>
<p>Lachlan Macquarie was appointed governor, and sent out with
instructions to reinstate Captain Bligh in that office, and,
after the expiration of twenty-four hours, to resume his own
authority&mdash;to declare void all appointments, grants of land,
and processes of law which had taken place between the arrest of
Governor Bligh and his own arrival; and further, to send home
Major Johnstone in close arrest, to be tried for his rebellion.
At the same time the 73rd, Colonel Macquarie's own regiment, was
sent out to relieve the New South Wales Corps, which was
disbanded, the privates being, however, permitted to volunteer
into the 73rd. These orders were obeyed.</p>
<p>Major Johnstone was tried at Chelsea Hospital on the 11th May,
1811, found guilty 5th June, and sentenced to be cashiered. His
conduct was clearly illegal and revolutionary, but it saved the
colony. He made that a peaceable revolution which would otherwise
have flamed into a wild riot, how ending, with the fearful
materials present there, it is impossible to foretel. Major
Johnstone returned to the colony, and lived many years on his
farm at Annandale, near Bathurst district, much respected. We
have not been able to learn whether the signers of the memorial
ever attempted to compensate him for the ruin of his own
professional prospects. The gratitude of a mob, well dressed or
ill dressed, is as vain a thing as the gratitude of a prince.</p>
<p>Bligh * became an admiral, but was never again called into
active service. The slight sentence passed upon Johnstone was a
stigma he carried to his grave. He died in 1817.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bligh asked Flinders to dedicate his "Terra
Australis" to him, but Flinders,-who had formed a most
unfavourable opinion of his character while serving under him in
the Reliance, politely declined.]</p>
<p>Since the time of Bligh there have been colonial governors as
violent in temper, as tyrannical in disposition, but their powers
have been limited not only by law, but by public opinion, the
influence of a free press, and the effects of a ready
communication with Europe.</p>
<p>Without a free press or a public to restrain him, out of sight
and hearing of a British Parliament, had Bligh confined his
tyrannies to the humbler classes he might have lived honoured and
prosperous, while his victims sank brokenhearted, or died under
the lash, as hundreds have on the shores of Port Jackson and
Paramatta; but he ventured to attack a gentleman&mdash;the
comrade of soldiers&mdash;a man of courage, eloquence, and
determination&mdash;and the unjust governor fell.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>
<h4>GOVERNOR MACQUARIE.<br>
<br>
1809 TO 1821.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Colonel Macquarie</span> directed the
government of New South Wales for twelve years&mdash;the longest
period that any governor has enjoyed that office. He exercised a
pure despotism, but it was neither a stupid nor a brutal
despotism, according to the light of the day.</p>
<p>The following extract from his first despatch not unfairly
describes the state of the colony on his arrival:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I found the colony barely emerging from infantine imbecility,
suffering from various privations and disabilities; the country
impenetrable beyond forty miles from Sydney; agriculture in a yet
languishing state, commerce in its early dawn, revenue unknown;
threatened with famine, distracted by faction; the public
buildings in a state of dilapidation, the few roads and bridges
almost impassable; the population in general depressed by
poverty; no credit, public or private; the morals of the great
mass of the population in the lowest state of debasement, and
religious worship almost totally neglected."</p>
<p>He was the first man of decided talent appointed to office in
Australia. He was distinguished by his self-reliance and constant
energetic action. If the comparison had not been vulgarised, one
might liken him, comparing small with great, to Napoleon. His was
the same order of mind&mdash;views narrow but
clear&mdash;essentially a materialist in politics. In New South
Wales wealth was the visible sign of success, and Macquarie
rewarded success wherever he found it. He made roads, erected
public buildings, and again and again traversed the whole length
and breadth of the colony, following closely in the footsteps of
new explorers, distributing grants to skilful settlers, planning
townships, and pardoning industrious prisoners. His activity was
untiring, his vanty boundless. He seldom condescended to ask
advice, and, when he did, generally followed his own opinion.
With charming <i>naïveté</i> he observes, in answer to a despatch
from the Secretary of State, informing him that it was not the
intention of the Government to appoint a council to assist the
governor, as had been recommended: "I entertain a fond hope that
such an institution will never be extended to this colony."</p>
<p>Even the recommendations of Secretaries of State he
disregarded; and, as he was successful, he was permitted to
pursue his own course. He infused his own active spirit into the
settlers, and under its influence the material progress of the
colony was extraordinary. Higher praise his administration
scarcely deserves. The moral, not to say the religious, tone of
the settlement owes little to his care. One instance will
suffice. He requested, in one of his despatches, that as many men
convicts as possible should be transported, as they were useful
for labour, but as few women, as they were costly and
troublesome; thus losing sight altogether of the inevitable
demoralisation which must be the result of a community of
men.</p>
<p>Macquarie has been much attacked for saying "that the colony
consisted of those who had been transported, and those who ought
to have been;" and "that it was a colony for convicts, and free
colonists had no business there:" but there was truth at the
bottom of both these rude speeches. He looked upon New South
Wales as a place where convicts were sent to be subsisted at the
least possible expense, and certainly neither he nor any one else
at that tune foresaw a period when it would cease to be a convict
colony. His strong common sense told him that the cheapest way of
ruling his felon subjects was to make them wealthy and
respectable. Under his predecessors the idea had grown up that
convicts were sent over to be the slaves of the free settlers.
Governor Macquarie would perhaps have had no objection to that
arrangement on moral grounds, had it been possible; but it was
not, as the free settlers of free descent were too few in number,
too indolent in character. He therefore took up the opposite
ground that the colony and all its emoluments and honours were
for the benefit of those prisoners who were industrious,
prosperous, and free from legal criminality.</p>
<p>The first individual selected for favour was a Scotchman,
Andrew Thompson, transported at sixteen years of age, probably
for some trifling offence. He had not only attained wealth and
developed new sources of commerce for the colony, by building
coasting vessels, by establishing saltworks and other useful
enterprises, but had distinguished himself by his humanity and
general good conduct. For instance, in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>
of the 11th May, 1806, we find Thompson permitted to purchase
brewing utensils from the government stores, at the usual advance
of fifty per cent. on the invoice price, with the privilege of
brewing beer, in consideration of his useful and humane conduct
in saving the lives and much of the property of sufferers by
repeated floods of the Hawkesbury, as well as of his general
demeanour.</p>
<p>Macquarie, within two months after his arrival, created
Thompson a magistrate, and repeatedly invited him and other
emancipists of similar success and conduct to dine at Government
House, in spite of the remonstrances of the free inhabitants, of
the officers of the 43rd Regiment, which succeeded the 73rd, and
of hints from the Colonial Office. No doubt in New South Wales
many a prisoner was induced to persevere in sober industry by the
sight of an ex-prisoner and publican riding in his carriage to
dine at Government House; but in England the effect could
scarcely have been beneficial as a restraint on idle apprentices
and incipient pickpockets. Such reports interleaved in the
<i>Newgate Calendar</i>, and other light reading of the felonry
of Britain, must have tended to diminish the vague horrors that
previously hung round Botany Bay.</p>
<p>Governor Macquarie commenced by employing the convict
labourers not required by settlers in making roads, and erecting
and repairing public buildings. On the first harvest after his
arrival, to the horror of the martinets, he permitted the
privates of the 73rd Regiment to hire themselves out as reapers,
to be paid in grain or money, the price of wheat at that time
being £1 3s. 6d. a bushel. At the same time lie patronised
amusements which the high prices of provisions did not prevent
the wealthier classes from establishing. The <i>New South Wales
Gazette</i> of October contains an account of three days' racing,
conducted in Newmarket style, followed by an ordinary and two
balls, the principal prize, a lady's cup, being "presented to the
winner by Mrs. Macquarie." The whole proceedings are related in a
style which would leave nothing to be desired in the <i>Little
Pedlington Gazette</i>. For instance: "The subscribers' ball, on
Tuesday and Thursday night, was honoured with the presence of his
excellency the governor and his lady, his honour the
lieutenant-governor and lady, the judge-advocate and lady, the
magistrates and other officers, civil and military, <i>and all
the beauty and fashion of the colony</i>. The business of the
meeting could not fail of diffusing a glow of
satisfaction&mdash;the celebration of the first liberal amusement
instituted in the colony in the presence of its patron and
founder." A supper followed the ball:&mdash;"After the cloth was
removed the rosy deity asserted his pre-eminence, and, with the
zealous aid of Momus and Apollo, chased pale Cynthia down into
the Western World; the blazing orb of day announced his near
approach, and the god of the chariot reluctantly forsook his
company: Bacchus drooped his head, Momus could no longer animate.
The <i>bons vivants</i>, no longer relishing the tired deities,
left them to themselves!"</p>
<p>In the first year of his government, Macquarie undertook a
tour through all the known districts of the colony, and continued
the practice annually during his reign. On his return, by a
general order, he censured the settlers for the little attention
they had paid to domestic comfort or good farming, in buildings
for the residence of themselves and shelter of their cattle;
offered cattle, sheep, and goats from the government herds, to be
paid for in grain, with eighteen months' credit; and announced
that he had marked out for settlement the five new townships of
Richmond, Pitt, Wilberforce, and Castlereagh, out of reach of
floods of the Hawkesbury and Nepean, in which grants would be
awarded to deserving applicants, on condition that they erected
dwellings according to plans supplied, and other measures of a
similar practical character.</p>
<p>In the December of the same year, the first brick church, St.
Philip's, was consecrated (on Christmas-day) by the Heverend
Samuel Marsden,&mdash;a name from that time forward constantly
occupying a conspicuous place in the annals of the colony, as
clergyman, magistrate, landowner, and stockbreeder. For instance,
his next appearance in the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> is, in
conjunction with two other gentlemen, advertising a reward of one
pound sterling, <i>or a gallon of spirits</i>, for every skin of
a native dog,&mdash;an animal which was then, and has been ever
since, the scourge of flockowners.</p>

<br>
<small>NATIVE DOG, OR DINGOE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>In 1812 a Committee of the House of Commons, appointed to
inquire into the state of the colony of New South Wales, after 63
examining a number of witnesses, including the ex-Governors King
and Bligh, printed a report, from which it appears that the
population amounted to 10,454, distributed in the following
proportions:&mdash;The Sydney district, 6,158; Paramatta, 1,807;
Hawkesbury, 2,389; Newcastle, 100: of these, 5,513 were men, and
2,200 women; military, 1,100; of the remainder, one-fourth to
one-fifth was actually bond; the rest being free, or freed by
servitude or pardon. In addition, 1,321 were living in Van
Diemen's Land, and 177 in Norfolk Island, but orders had been
sent out to compel the voluntary settlers, who had adhered to
that island after the government establishment had been removed,
to withdraw.</p>
<p>The settlements of New South Wales were bounded on the west by
the Blue Mountains, "beyond which no one has been able to
penetrate the country; some have with difficulty been as far as
one hundred miles from the coast, but beyond sixty miles it
appears to be nowhere practicable for agricultural purposes;
beyond Port Stephen and Port Jervis these settlements will not be
capable of extension; of the land within the boundaries, one half
is absolutely barren." The ground in actual cultivation was
21,000 acres, and 74,000 were held in pasture. The stock, in the
hands chiefly of the settlers, was considerable, but it was still
necessary to continue the importation of salt provisions.</p>
<p>The currency of the colony was in government paper and copper
money, but barter was the principal medium of sale; and wheat and
cattle had been recognised by the court of justice as legal
tenders in payment of debts.</p>
<p>The exportations of the colony consisted principally of whale
oil, seal skins, coals, and wool. The iron ore, of which there
was abundance, had not been worked. The trade in skins and coal
was limited by the monopoly of the East India Company. Sheep were
not sufficiently numerous to make wool an article of large
exportation. The culture of hemp had been less attended to than
might have been expected. An illegal trade in sandal-wood had at
times been carried on with the South Sea Islands and China.
Mercantile speculation had been discouraged by impolitic
regulations.</p>
<p>For many years a maximum price was imposed by the governor
upon all imported merchandise, often too low to afford a fair
profit to the trader; at this price the whole cargo was
distributed amongst the civil and military officers of the
settlement, who alone had liberty to purchase; and articles of
the first necessity were afterwards retailed by them, at an
enormous profit, to the poorer settlers. The imposition of a
maximum price on imported articles, and on the price of grain and
butcher's meat, had been discontinued, and the attempt to limit
the price of labour had failed. The trade in spirits Was reported
as a great difficulty.</p>
<p>The defects of the system of criminal jurisdiction by
court-martial, and civil jurisdiction without legal assistance or
juries, are described; and the report states,-that the governor,
uncontrolled by any council, had power to pardon all offences,
except treason and murder; to impose customs duties, to grant
lands, and to issue colonial regulations; and for the breach of
these regulations to inflict a punishment of 500 lashes and a
fine of £100.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that a council should be given to
the governor. With regard to grants of land, they reported that,
according to evidence, a retiring governor had granted 1,000
acres to his successor, who had returned the compliment by a
similar grant immediately after being installed in office.</p>
<p>Free settlers latterly had not been permitted to emigrate to
New South Wales without giving proof that they were possessed of
a certain capital. On their arrival they usually received a grant
of land in proportion to their means.</p>
<p>On the arrival of Governor Bligh, two-thirds of the children
annually born in the colony were illegitimate.</p>
<p>This report, which also entered at considerable length into
the treatment of convicts, directed a little of public attention
to the antipodean colony, and the result was to induce the
Government to appoint a judge, with two magistrates chosen in
rotation, who composed a supreme court in civil and criminal
cases; and in Van Diemen's Land, as well as New South Wales, a
fifty-pound civil court, with appeal, was formed, with the
judge-advocate as sole judge.</p>
<p>This was the first step toward meliorating the absolute
despotism under which the free settlers had hitherto lived.
Measures were also taken for removing the restrictions on
commerce with Van Diemen's Land, and abolishing trade monopolies:
but Governor Macquarie's protests against the interference or
assistance of a council prevailed, and he was enabled to pursue
his plans with that concentrated vigour which is the one
advantage of an enlightened despotism.</p>
<p>To enumerate all the public works which, with no mean amount
of skill and at great cost to the parent country, Governor
Macquarie executed, would be neither useful nor amusing. It is
sufficient to state, that, while he erected many substantial if
not elegant buildings in the town of Sydney, he took care, by
well-devised roads, to render available all the cultivable land
and pastures to be found within as much of the territory as had
been explored. The settlers imbibed his spirit of progress, and
imitated his energy; flocks and herds increased to a great
extent, although the sheep were for the greater part of an
inferior breed, a mixture of the hairy Bengal and heavy-tailed
Cape, whose wool was worthless for export. But M'Arthur, whose
efforts had been neglected and repressed by previous governors,
was steadily pursuing his great idea of naturalising the "noble
race," or Spanish merino, on the plains of Australia. In
December, 1812, the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> reports that ten rams
of the merino breed, lately sold by auction from the flocks of
John M'Arthur, Esq., produced upwards of 200 guineas; and that
"several coats made entirely of the wool of New South Wales are
now in this country, and are of most excellent quality." In 1852
a whole fleet of ships were required to convey the wool of
Australia to the manufacturers of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>In 1813 occurred one of those droughts, the one drawback on
what would otherwise be a course of unvarying prosperity, which
are periodical in Australia. On this occasion it was not only the
crops that suffered; the numerous flocks and herds were unable to
find sufficient pasturage on plains which, when first discovered,
were overspread with luxuriant herbage many feet in height.
Necessity forced upon the colonists the idea of again searching
for a passage across the Blue Mountains. The attempt had been
unsuccessfully made by several early colonists; amongst others,
by the brave Surgeon Bass.</p>
<p>The last and successful effort was made by three gentlemen
whose names are still well known in the colony&mdash;William
Wentworth, son of the D'Arcy Wentworth who took an active part in
the deposition of Governor Bligh, one of the earliest free
colonists, himself destined in various ways to occupy a
distinguished place in the annals of the colony; Lieutenant
Lawson, afterwards one of the greatest land and stock owners; and
Gregory Blaxland, one of the first members of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image08" id="Image08"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>BATHURST PLAINS IN 1852.</small></p>
<br>
<p>With incredible toil and hardships, they effected a passage
across a chain of mountains clothed with dense timber and
brushwood, and intersected by a succession of ravines, which
presented extraordinary difficulties, not so much from their
height as from their precipitous character. At the foot of the
opposite side of the mountains, an easy journey led to Bathurst
Plains, the finest pasture country the colonists had yet seen,
far exceeding even the famous Cow Pastures on the Nepean. It is
to this country, the discovery of Messrs. Wentworth and Lawson,
that the gold-diggers are now streaming in thousands, but not
clambering up precipices, sliding down ravines, and cutting paths
through impenetrable brushwood, like the early pioneers; but
easily travelling, and grumbling as they go, at the ill-kept
condition of a macadamised road which has been conducted with
admirable engineering skill in a series of ascending and
descending gradients, over which even loaded drays can travel
with ease.</p>
<p>Within fifteen months from the discovery of the first pass
over the Blue Mountains, Governor Macquarie caused a practicable
road to be made. He never lost any time in planning and executing
such works. Some governors would have occupied as much time in
preparing a despatch as he did in completing the work. Many
settlers, without waiting for the road, contrived to transfer
portions of their live stock to the new pastoral El Dorado. In
April, 1815, the governor himself, with Mrs. Macquarie,
accompanied by his principal officers and Mr. Lewin, painter and
naturalist, set out on a progress to view what he called "his
last conquest."</p>
<p>The results of this progress, made two months before the
battle of Waterloo, are recorded in the following extracts from a
"General Order:" certainly one of the most curious documents of
the kind ever published.</p>
<h5>MACQUARIE'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.</h5>
<p>"The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains, through a
very handsome open forest of lofty trees for twelve miles, was
much more practicable and easy than was expected. At a further
distance of four miles a sudden change is perceived in the
appearance of the timber and quality of the soil, the former
becoming stunted, and the latter barren and rocky. Here the
country became altogether mountainous and extremely rugged. From
henceforward to the twenty-sixth mile is a succession of steep
and rugged hills, some so abrupt as to deny a passage altogether;
but at this place an extensive plain is arrived at, which
constitutes the summit of the western mountains, and from thence
a most extensive and beautiful prospect presents itself on all
sides to the eye. On the south-west side of this table land
[query, King's Table Land?] the mountain terminates in an abrupt
precipice of immense depth. At the bottom [the governor does not
mention how they got to the bottom] is seen an immense glen,
twenty-four miles in length, terminating as abruptly as the
others, bounded on the further side by mountains of great
magnitude, to which the governor gave the name of Prince Regent's
Glen. Proceeding hence to the thirty-third mile, on the top of a
hill, an opening presents itself on the south-west side of the
glen, from whence a view is obtained of mountains rising beyond
mountains with stupendous masses of rock in the foreground, in a
circular or amphitheatrical form. The road continues from hence,
for the space of seventeen miles, on the ridge of the mountain
which forms one side of Prince Regent's Glen, and there suddenly
terminates in a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet. Down this
Mr. Cox had constructed a road to which the governor gave the
name of Cox's Pass, and to the ridge, Mount York.* On descending
the pass, the first pasture land and soil fit for cultivation
appeared, watered by two rivulets running east and west, and
joining, forming Cox's River, which takes its course through
Prince Regent's Glen, and empties itself into the River Nepean.
Three miles hence the expedition of Messrs. Blaxland, Wentworth,
and Lawson, terminated. A range of very lofty hills and narrow
valleys, alternately, form the part of the country from Cox's
River for a distance of sixteen miles, until Fish River is
reached.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mount York Road has since been abandoned in
favour of an easy descent by Mount Victoria executed by Sir
Thomas Mitchell.]</p>
<p>"Passing on, the country continues hilly, but affords good
pasturage, gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley, distant eight
miles from the pass of Fish River. The land level, and the first
met, unencumbered with timber, forms a valley north-west and
south-east between hills of easy ascent, thinly covered with
timber. Leaving the valley, the country again becomes hilly;
thirteen miles brought the party to Campbell River, where an
extensive view opened of gently rising hills and fertile plains.
In the pool of Campbell's River, that very curious animal the
paradox, or water-mole, was seen in great numbers.** The Fish
River, which forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles
to the northward, has two fertile plains named O'Connell's and
Macquarie's Plains. Seven miles from the bridge over Campbell
River, Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a rich part
of champaign country of eleven miles in length, bounded on both
sides by very beautiful hills thinly wooded. The Macquarie River,
which is formed by a junction of the Campbell and Five Rivers,
takes a winding course through the plains, which can easily be
traced from the highlands by the verdure of the trees on the
banks, which are the only trees throughout the extent of the
plains. The level and clean surface (marked in plough ridges)
gives them very much the appearance of lands in a state of
cultivation."</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is now extinct in that part of the
colony.]</p>

<br>
<small>THE DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OR PARADOX.</small></p>
<br>
<p>On the south bank of the Macquarie, the governor encamped for
a week, occupying his time in making excursions in different
directions through the country on both sides the river; and on
Sunday, 7th May, 1815, fixed on a site suitable for the erection
of a town at some future period, to which he gave the name of
Bathurst."</p>
<p>This discovery, made by the courageous perseverance of the
three gentlemen before named, rendered available by the wise
energy of Macquarie, and-profitable by the fine-woolled sheep of
M'Arthur, assured the future fortunes of the Three Colonies of
Australia, and laid the foundation of an empire on the sweepings
of our gaols.</p>
<p>Macquarie was vain, hopeful, ambitious, and not unjustly proud
of what, in his despatches to Earl Bathurst, he called "his
discovery;" but his utmost expectation only extended to
supporting a considerable but isolated population by pastoral and
agricultural pursuits. He expressly stated, in his curious
general order, that "The difficulties which present themselves in
the journey from hence [Sydney] are certainly great and
inevitable; those persons who may be inclined to become permanent
settlers will probably content themselves with visiting the
capital rarely, and of course will have them seldom to
encounter." And under this impression the grants of land were
made chiefly in large blocks of several thousand acres.</p>
<p>What would have been his pride and admiration could he have
foreseen that, within a few miles of the plains of pasture land
which have realised to the first settlers hundreds of thousands
of pounds in wool, gold lay in heaps for gathering; and that
within the lifetime of Wentworth, the explorer, an unbroken army
of gold adventurers would crowd the highway from Sidney to the
"City of the Plains," and in one year double the exports and the
consuming powers of the colony.</p>
<p>The road to Bathurst Plains, executed in an incredibly short
period, under the direction of Governor Macquarie, was materially
improved by succeeding governors, and especially by the
surveyor-general, Sir Thomas Mitchell, the Cook of Australian
inland discovery. Sir Thomas Mitchell effected works second only
in importance and merit of design and execution to the Simplon
Pass over the Alps. It is unfortunate that he was not permitted
to carry out other public works which he suggested at a period
when the barracks and gaols were filled with idle convicts. The
road by Mount York was so steep that bullock drivers were in the
habit of cutting down and attaching part of a tree to their
drays, by way of substitute for a drag. Sir Thomas filled up an
intervening valley by cutting down part of the summit of Mount
Victoria.</p>
<p>Under Macquarie, in addition to the Bathurst, the Argyle
district, one of the best agricultural and pastoral districts on
the road, of which Goulburn is the centre, was discovered; as
also Port Macquarie, afterwards a penal settlement, at the mouth
of the River Hastings, leading to a fertile district, as yet, in
consequence of the price of land and labour, unoccupied to its
full extent. Mr. Oxley, the surveyor-general, traced the Rivers
Lachlan and Macquarie to the west of the Blue Mountains, where
they disappear in a swamp in dry seasons, and in seasons of
extraordinary rain form an inland sea. Macquarie also formed one
penal settlement on the fertile soil of Emu Plains, and another
in the coal district at the mouth of the River Hunter, not
improperly named Newcastle. He also materially improved the
aspect of Sydney by laying it out on a new plan, and gave
encouragement to every useful enterprise. He was wise enough to
see the importance of, and did his best to create, a class of
small farmers, who, tilling the ground with their own hands,
would be independent of hired labour, and assist in protecting
the colony against the effects of a dearth of corn. With this
view, he gave grants of thirty acres each to emancipated
convicts. Unfortunately, he did not accompany this wise measure
with an importation of female population.</p>
<p>Among the gossiping libels against the yeomanry class current
among the squatocracy is a statement that Macquarie's settlers
sold all their farms for rum. This statement was investigated by
Mrs. Chisholm, who found a great number of the settlers in the
Hawkesbury voting for members of council on their original
grants. That under the horrid single-man system many should have
flown to rum for consolation, is not extraordinary. The old saw
says&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">"Without a wife,<br>
"A farmer's is a dreary life."</p>
<p>Very little could be expected from a population of which not
one in five could obtain an honest helpmate, and which knew
little of clergymen except as sellers of rum and dispensers of
lashes. Even in the mother country, the duty of educating the
masses had hardly begun to make way; thus it was only the
inoculation of whatever good there was in the colony, and the
facility of getting an honest living, that prevented the
colonists of Macquarie's time from becoming a nation of
bucaneers.</p>
<p>The ignorant and the vicious were turned loose in New South
Wales with the lash and the gallows for those who were found out,
but with independence for those who were industrious. The result
showed how human nature can run clear where not pressed down by
poverty or compressed in towns.</p>
<p>The Rum Hospital was a specimen of the tone of morality during
the early years of New South Wales. It was built by three
gentlemen, under a contract with the governor, which gave them a
monopoly of the sale and importation of rum for a certain number
of years. The workmen were, as much as possible, paid in rum, and
public-houses were multiplied to an extent exceeding the
proportion in the lowest and poorest haunts of Great Britain.</p>
<p>Many individuals, profiting by the enormous government
expenditure, became wealthy; and all the sober, and many who were
not sober, of the free or freed population were prosperous. It
became manifestly better policy to live by work or trade than by
robbery.</p>
<p>Of churches there were two, and these barely filled; of the
few clergymen the majority were occupied as magistrates, in
awarding lashes to refractory servants, in farming, in breeding
stock, and dealing in anything that would bring a profit. When
New South Wales was considered worthy of an archdeacon, one
honourable exception, the much-loved Parson Cowper,* was passed
over and neglected, according to the rule of the day, in favour
of an ex-wine-merchant.</p>
<p class="foot">[* A son of the Rev. Mr. Cowper is one of the
most respectable and influential men in the colony, and a
valuable member of the Legislative Council.]</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics, amounting to some thousands, were not
allowed to have the comfort of a priest of their own religion.
Considering that the Roman Catholic cannot, like the Protestant,
retire to any solitude and there relieve his mind by prayer and
confession to God&mdash;that he deems the intervention of the
priest, especially on his deathbed, essential to his
salvation&mdash;it is not extraordinary that the Irish part of
the prisoner-population should have been turbulent and desperate;
they felt themselves condemned to misery in this world, and
perdition in the next&mdash;dying "unhousel'd, unannointed,
unanel'd."</p>
<p>The tone of society in the towns was horrible: no educated or
honourable class; no church worthy of the name; no schools except
for the wealthy, and these chiefly taught by convicts;
slave-masters who sold rum; slaves who drank it; an autocrat
surrounded by parasites, whose fortune he could make by a stroke
of his pen. Except military honour, and the virtue cherished by a
few who lived apart, there was as little virtue and honour as
freedom in this wretched, prosperous colony.</p>
<br>
<p>From the foundation of New South Wales to the end of Governor
Macquarie's administration, about 400,000 acres of land were
granted to private individuals. Of these, in course of time, many
town lots have become of enormous value, as likewise some of the
country land; but much was barren, and not worth cultivation when
better land was rendered accessible by roads.</p>
<p>In 1817, the first judge, Mr. Field, arrived; a branch of the
Bible Society was established-, and a Roman Catholic priest,
Father O'Flynn, landed and spent some time in the colony, but,
not having been duly authorised by the home government, he was
compelled to return. Bigotry was in full bloom before
Christianity had taken root.</p>
<p>In 1819 arrived a commissioner of inquiry, John Thomas Bigge,
Esq., and his secretary, Thomas Hobbs Scott, Esq. He remained
until February, 1821, having collected a body of evidence, which
was afterwards printed for the use of the House of Commons. It
contains many curious stories. The publication of this report had
a considerable effect in directing the attention of the British
public to the resources of Australia, and eventually caused the
influx of a superior class of emigrants. But it was not until
Governor Darling's time that the demand for convict labourers, on
terms then in force, began to exceed the supply. Colonists,
chiefly the Scotchmen, discovered the advantage of agricultural
pursuits in a colony in which, with a grant of land, they became
entitled to rations for twelve months for themselves and their
wives, and convict labourers at the rate of one for each thirty
acres, who were also rationed by the government for the space of
eighteen months. The inquiry by Mr. Commissioner Bigge was partly
owing to the representations made, in a work published by Mr.
William Wentworth, during a visit paid to England for the purpose
of being called to the bar.</p>
<p>Among other subjects that came under the notice of the
commissioner was the ecclesiastical government of New South
Wales. The report of Mr. Bigge recommended the appointment of an
archdeacon. Mr. Scott, the secretary, lost no time in taking
orders, and in 1825 reappeared in the colony as Archdeacon
Scott.</p>
<p>In the year that the royal commissioner quitted the colony a
Wesleyan chapel was opened, and the foundation stone of a Roman
Catholic cathedral was laid by the governor at the request of
Father Therry&mdash;good Father Therry&mdash;who shared with
Parson Cowper the honour, the respect, the affection of the
poorer colonists, and of the outcast prisoner population, whom
they so faithfully tended, and the persecution of their spiritual
superiors.</p>
<p>In 1822 Governor Macquarie embarked for England, after a
longer and more successful administration than any governor in
the Australian colonies has hitherto enjoyed. He found New South
Wales a gaol, and left it a colony; he found Sydney a village,
and left it a city; he found a population of idle prisoners,
paupers, and paid officials, and left a large free community,
thriving on the produce of flocks and the labour of convicts.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>
<h4>GOVERNOR BRISBANE AND GOVERNOR DARLING.<br>
<br>
1821 TO 1831.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Macquarie</span> was succeeded by Sir Thomas
Brisbane, whose term of office, undistinguished by remarkable
actions on his part, was full of events of importance to a colony
which was fast acquiring a population that could no longer be
controlled by a purely military despotism. From the day of
Macquarie's departure a struggle commenced between the people and
the government which was carried on up to the present year, when
the Duke of Newcastle conceded to the Australians full powers of
self-government and self-taxation.</p>
<p>Under any circumstances Sir Thomas Brisbane's task would have
been difficult. The fortunes made in the colony had attracted a
class of emigrants not prepared to submit to the despotic system
which the prisoner part of the population could not, and the
officials and settlers living on government patronage were not
inclined to resist. Succeeding to the absolute powers of
Macquarie, in 1824, three years after landing, the Legislative,
or rather Executive Council, against the check of which his
imperious predecessor had protested, was established. The first
chief-justice, the first attorney-general, a solicitor-general,
who was also a commissioner of the Court of Requests, a master in
chancery, and colonial treasurer, arrived in the colony. Trial by
jury took place in the first Court of Quarter Sessions; liberty
of the press was conceded; and the <i>Australian</i>, the first
colonial newspaper independent of government aid, was published
by Mr. Wentworth and Dr. Wardell, and followed by two other
journals.</p>
<p>While on this side of the globe we were declaiming and
subscribing for the liberties of Greeks, Spaniards, and South
Americans, at the antipodes our countrymen were struggling for
trial by jury and "unlicensed printing."</p>
<p>Commercial liberty yet remained to be gained. The East India
Company claimed the monopoly of trading in the Indian seas, and
repeatedly asserted their right by confiscating vessels loaded
with produce for Port Jackson. In 1824 the captain of a
man-of-war actually seized the ship Almorah, with a valuable
cargo of tea and rice, at anchor in Sydney Cove, and sent her as
a prize to Calcutta in charge of his lieutenant.</p>
<p>Major-General Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B., had acquired a high
reputation as a soldier in the Peninsula, and as a man of
science. The first observatory in Australia was erected under his
auspices. But his government, which only lasted four years, was
unpopular, and the political concessions made rendered further
concessions inevitable. To this fire was added the fuel of
grievances which went home to the pockets of almost all the
settlers and traders, and an insult which deeply offended a
powerful, united, and intelligent religious community&mdash;the
Scotch Presbyterians.</p>
<p>The Presbyterians applied in 1823 for assistance to build a
Presbyterian church in Sydney, and referred pointedly to the
support afforded the "Roman Catholics." The tone of the
application appears not to have pleased either Sir Thomas or his
secretary, and he returned a bitter reply, of which the following
is the concluding paragraph. The style is eminently
characteristic of colonial secretaries and governors:&mdash;</p>
<p>"When, therefore, the Presbyterians of the colony shall have
advanced by private donations in the erection of a temple worthy
of religion; when in the choice of their teachers they shall have
discovered a judgment equal to that which has presided at the
selection of the Roman Catholic clergymen; when they shall have
practised what they propose, 'To instruct the people to fear God
and honour the King;' when, by endeavouring to 'keep the unity of
the spirit in the bond of peace' in a a colony requiring it more
than all others, they shall have shown through their lives the
influence of the holy religion they profess, then assuredly will
the colonial executive step forward to extend its countenance and
support to those who are following the Presbyterian creed."</p>
<p>The governor, it is said, acted under the advice of his
secretary, a gentleman of the old Tory school. The Scotch
gentlemen applied to the home government, when the governor
received a severe reprimand, and the Presbyterians the aid they
required.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane's financial measures were equally
unfortunate, yet there is no reason to question the purity of his
motives.</p>
<p>It had been usual under previous governors to purchase the
surplus grain from farmers at the current price of the day. The
colonial government was almost the only purchaser, and to
government the corn-growers looked for a certain share of their
profits. Among the smaller settlers, the only cash they received
in the course of the year was from the commissariat. This was the
latter phase of a system which began with rationing the whole
community, and gave liberty to prisoners who undertook to support
themselves, which, in its second stage, willingly provided a free
and emancipated settler with land and prisoner labour, and
purchased the produce of land so tilled, to feed the prisoners
whom the settlers could not employ.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Brisbane, who arrived with Commissioner Bigge's
report hanging over him, adopted the ordinary contract system,
and invited tenders for the quantity required at the lowest
price. The small farmers, unused to calculate the effects of open
competition, rushed forward to the stores with such eagerness,
that wheat fell from 10s. and 7s. 6d. a bushel to 3s. 9d.
Abstractedly Sir Thomas Brisbane was right, practically he was
wrong; so serious a change required care and time.</p>
<p>About the same time the governor established a colonial
currency which raised the pound sterling twenty-five per cent.,
and proceeded to pay government debts in colonial money to
parties who had contracted debts in sterling currency;&mdash;a
revival of the system of depreciating the circulating medium
obsolete in England, but still practised by continental
monarchs.</p>
<p>The colonists, seeing the price at which wheat was transferred
to the government stores, took it for granted that the harvest
had been redundant, proceeded to feed pigs, and otherwise
expended the unsold proceeds of their harvest. As the season
advanced it was discovered that the harvest, so far from being
plentiful, was deficient. Wheat rose to £1 4s. a bushel. Those
who had sold cheap had to buy at a high price. The tampering with
the currency added to the severity of the crisis. A great flood
swept away the finest crops on the Hawkesbury. A famine followed:
the government, by proclamation, required that cabbage-stalks
should not be rooted up. A large body of small farmers became so
insolvent that their farms were sold to pay their debts, and
passed into the hands of money-lenders and grogshop-keepers.</p>
<p>The discontent of the colonists reacted on the home
government, and Sir Thomas Brisbane was recalled on the 1st
December, 1825.</p>
<p>Four very important discoveries were made during his
administration. In 1823, the Maneroo Plains, situated between two
and three thousand feet above the level of the sea, separated
from Twofold Bay by a lofty range of mountains, over which there
is now a dray-track, were explored by Captain Currie, R.N., who
named them Brisbane Downs, but they have since reverted to their
native name. In the same year, Mr. Oxley, the surveyor-general,
by order of Sir T. Brisbane, explored Moreton Bay, and discovered
the navigable River Brisbane, leading to the fine semi-tropical
country now fully occupied by squatters, but capable of
supporting a large agricultural population.</p>
<p>In the following year Messrs. Hovell and Hume made their
overland journey to Port Phillip; and in 1825, Mr. Allan
Cunningham, one of the most enterprising and accomplished of
Australian explorers, discovered Pandora's Pass, a cleft than
which the Alps offer nothing more wild, more imposing, or more
picturesque, affording the only practicable road from the Upper
Hunter to the pastoral uplands of Liverpool Plains.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Darling, K.C.B., succeeded
Governor Brisbane; the colony, during an interregnum of eighteen
days, having been in the hands of Colonel (afterwards General)
Stewart, of Bathurst, an honour which formed one of the boasts of
the gallant officer and standing jokes of the district for the
remainder of his life.</p>
<h5>GOVERNOR DARLING.</h5>
<p>Sir Ralph Darling arrived in December, 1825; his
administration lasted six years, and was singularly and
deservedly unpopular. He was a man of forms and precedents, of
the true red-tape school&mdash;neat, exact, punctual,
industrious, arbitrary, spiteful, commonplace. He laboured hard
to reduce into order the confusion he found in the public offices
of the colony, and substituted a system which became quite as
corrupt and more dilatory. It was like changing from the court of
a Turkish cadi to the Court of Chancery. He obstinately evaded
the control intended to be imposed upon him by the secret
official and nominee council, and perpetrated one act of tyranny
which has no parallel in English history since the time of
Charles I. and the Star Chamber, The red-tape tendencies of
Governor Darling were shown in his management of the waste lands
of the colony.</p>
<h5>THE AUSTRALIAN AGRICULTURAL COMPANY.</h5>
<p>New South Wales, in common with South American mines, Greek
and Spanish loans, and a crowd of other bubble speculations,
which seem to be decennially necessary to the commercial
existence of Englishmen, became, in the last year of Governor
Brisbane's official reign, the subject of the operations of a
great company, incorporated by charter and by act of Parliament,
with a directorate including the best men of the city of London,
a capital of a million pounds, a grant of a million acres, and
various other privileges and pre-emptions, of which a monopoly of
the working and sale of coal eventually proved the most
profitable to the shareholders and offensive to the colonists.
Under Governor Darling, the agents of this Australian
Agricultural Company selected, took possession, and commenced
operations on their grant.</p>
<p>A retrospect of the plans and prospects of this company in
1825 will perhaps afford the best landmark of the progress of the
colony from the time when the whole community depended for
salvation from famine on one ship, and that ship driven by
adverse gales out of Sydney Heads away to sea.</p>
<p>The directors of the Australian Agricultural Company, in their
original prospectus, represent New South Wales as well calculated
for the growth of "timber, wheat, tobacco, hemp, flax, and
fruits, amongst which are the olive, grape, fig, mulberry, guava,
almond, peach, citron, and orange." They derived their
information chiefly from the reports of Mr. Commissioner Bigge;
and from the same source rested great hopes of profit&mdash;</p>
<p>"1<i>st</i>, On the growth of fine merino wool.</p>
<p>"2<i>ndly</i>, From the breeding of cattle and other live
stock, and the raising corn, tobacco, &amp;c., for the supply of
persons resident in the colony.</p>
<p>"3<i>rdly</i>, From the production, at a more distant time, of
wine, olive oil, hemp, flax, silk, opium, &amp;c., as articles of
export to Great Britain.</p>
<p>"4<i>thly</i>, From a progressive advance in the value of
land, as it becomes improved; and by an increased
population."</p>
<p>The grant of land was made on the ground that the colony would
derive advantage from the importation of so large a capital,
invested in cattle, horses, and sheep of the Cheviot breeds; in
the cultivation of the produce of southern Europe; and that the
mother country would be saved the cost of maintaining a certain
number of convicts.</p>
<p>At that period it was still so much an object with the
government to relieve itself of the cost of the maintenance of
criminals, that it was agreed that the company should be relieved
of quit rent, on condition of their employing a certain number of
prisoners. But from the period of the grant to the Australian
Agricultural Company, the value of convict labour rose so
rapidly, that they never were able to obtain the stipulated
number of servants. In 1830 we find the editor of the <i>Sydney
Monitor</i> proposing that convicts should be sold on arrival to
the highest bidder, and anticipating that they would realise, in
lots of two hundred, £100 a year each for five or ten years!</p>
<p>In the course of the correspondence with this company, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies announced that in future,
"instead of giving grants of land free, lands were to be put up
to sale, according to a valuation of the surveyor-general,
similar, in many respects, to the system adopted in the United
States of America."</p>
<p>This plan had been suggested by Mr. Commissioner Bigge, with a
price of 10s. an acre for lands near towns, and 5s. an acre in
the country.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the example of the Australian Company infected
many members of Parliament and other persons of influence, who
hastened to obtain grants which cost the minister nothing, and
appeared to the granters of immense value&mdash;a delusion on
both sides. The precedent became most embarrassing to the
government, while many of the huge blocks were of very little
money value to the absentees, and of great disadvantage to the
colony.</p>
<p>As to the Australian Agricultural Company, their proceedings
created, in the then state of the colony, a financial revolution.
They sent out from England, according to the custom of joint
stock companies, a numerous staff of officers, with cargoes of
implements and breeding stock on a most costly scale; and
purchased ewes and heifers in the colony so largely, that prices
were raised nearly two hundred per cent. "The company with a long
pocket" was a popular toast at colonial dinners, and sellers were
never wanting as long as they had any money to invest.</p>
<p>A reaction followed, as it always does follow, extravagant
expectations of pecuniary profit. Nevertheless the colony derived
advantage from the introduction of the company's capital and
superior stock in sheep, horses, and cattle. The grand ideas of
vineyards, olive oil, opium, silkworm cultivation, and orange
groves, which formed applauded passages in speeches in the House
of Commons and the court-room of the company, were never extended
beyond the resident manager's gardens.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the beneficial influences were neutralised by a
further grant, which not only handed over the large tract of coal
seams which had been unprofitably worked by the government, but
actually created <i>a monopoly which precluded the colonists from
working, on any terms, any coal which might happen to be found
under their estates</i>.</p>
<p>These doings seem monstrous now. At that period they were
ordinary transactions, in which honourable men and liberal
politicians took a share without shame. In the same perverse
spirit the authorities and merchants at Sydney, up to 1826,
compelled every ship to enter and break bulk at Sydney before
calling at the ports of Van Diemen's Land. In 1825 monopoly was
as much an article of faith with statesmen as free trade in
1852.</p>
<p>Under Governor Darling emigration from England of persons of
moderate capital increased. But a vicious system was established
in the surveyor's office, for the benefit of favoured or feeing
parties, by which surveys of waste land were kept secret from the
uninitiated. In 1830 the author of "A Letter of Advice to
Emigrants" recommends "every settler to bring out an order from
the Secretary of State to be allowed to inspect charts and maps
in the surveyor's office;" and adds, "from being denied such
inspection, emigrants wander about the interior of the colony at
great expense, but to little purpose." Reform makes slow progress
in the Colonial Office. If we are to believe the boasts of an
Hibernian-German captain who, in 1848, visited Port Phillip, even
in that year there existed secret choice reserves near the town
of Melbourne, which, by the "open sesame" of his letter from Earl
Grey, after being long retained, were handed over to a German
colony.</p>
<p>Darling ruled the convicts with a rod of iron. The times of
the "first fleeters," with floggers, and short allowances of
food, were revived. A penal settlement was formed at Moreton Bay;
and there, it is commonly affirmed, the prisoners were so badly
treated that they committed murder in order to be sent for trial
to Sydney. County magistrates were permitted to award any number
of lashes for insolence, idleness, or other indefinite offences.
As it was not lawful for a man to flog-his own assigned servants,
he exchanged compliments with a neighbour. Considering the class
of persons who were then frequently selected for magistrates in
the colonies, it may easily be conceived to what brutal excesses
such irresponsible authority led.</p>
<p>But year by year the civilising elements of society made way.
At one time, in 1826, we find a dispensary opened: in the
following year a great public meeting is held, with the sheriff
in the chair, to petition the King and both Houses of Parliament
for the civil rights of trial by jury, and a House of Assembly;
and the next year a general post-office throughout the colony,
and an Australian jockey club, are established. The editor of a
newspaper is found guilty of libel, and two gentlemen fight a
bloodless duel. A dispensary, a post-office, an action for libel,
and a duel!&mdash;the banes and antidotes of civilised
society.</p>
<p>The two last years of Governor Darling present events and
contrasts still more remarkable.</p>
<p>A Legislative Council, being a step in advance of the
Executive Council established by the charter of 1824, held its
first meeting in 1829. This was the check against which Governor
Macquarie so earnestly and naively protested. The council
consisted of Archdeacon (the late Bishop) Broughton, who
superseded Mr. Scott, the Commander of the Forces, the Chief
Justice, Attorney-General, and Colonial Treasurer, Alexander
M'Cleay, afterwards (at eighty years of age) the first speaker of
the first Australian Legislative Assembly, and four members
selected by the governor.</p>
<p>The proceedings of this council were secret, under an oath
administered to that intent; and the governor had an absolute
veto. The majority were officials, totally unacquainted with the
colony; and, looking at the minority in which the nominees of the
government were constantly found in the subsequent open
Legislative Assembly, it is not extraordinary that this council
gave no satisfaction to the colony. It must, however, be
confessed, that in 1829 New South Wales did not possess the
materials for representative institutions.</p>
<p>The first act of the council was to establish trial by jury in
civil cases.</p>
<p>In the following year, on the 31st March, 1831, the first
steam-boat in Australia was launched; two other steam-boats came
into use within a few months. Close upon the steam-boat followed
Dr. Lang, from Scotland, the first Australian agitator, a
Presbyterian O'Connell, who, after professing and printing every
shade of political opinions, has recently avowed his preference
for a republic, and his hopes that he "shall yet see the British
flag trailed in the dust."</p>
<p>Decidedly, in 1831, Australia was making progress.</p>
<br>
<p>The history of General Darling's administration reads more
like that of one of Napoleon's pro-consuls than that of an
Englishman reigning over Englishmen.</p>
<p>The case of Sudds and Thompson is an instance which stands out
in the history of the colony as a sort of landmark indicating the
termination of the Algerine system of government, and affording a
singular example of the state of society in which such an outrage
on law, justice, and constitutional rights could be not only
done, but defended. The story is worth relating, if only to show
what deeds could be perpetrated in the same age by the same race
that expended millions in redeeming negro slaves and attempting
to convert aboriginal cannibals.</p>
<p>Sudds and Thompson were two private soldiers in the 57th
Regiment, doing duty in New South Wales in 1825, the second year
of Sir Ralph Darling's reign. Thompson was a well-behaved man,
who had saved some money; Sudds was a loose character. They both
wished to remain in the colony. In New South Wales these two
soldiers saw men who had arrived as convicts settled on snug
farms, established in good shops, or become even wealthy
merchants and stockowners. As to procure their discharge was out
of the question, Sudds, the scamp, suggested to Thompson that
they should qualify themselves for the good fortune of convicts,
and procure their discharge by becoming felons. Accordingly they
went together to the shop of a Sydney tradesman, and openly stole
a piece of cloth&mdash;were, as they intended, caught, tried,
convicted, and sentenced to be transported to one of the
auxiliary penal settlements for seven years. In the course of the
trial the object of the crime was clearly elicited. It became
evident that the discipline of the troops required to keep guard
over the large convict population would be seriously endangered
if the commission of a crime enabled a soldier to obtain the
superior food, condition, and prospects enjoyed by a criminal.
Accordingly, Sir Ralph Darling issued an order under which the
two soldiers, who had been tried and convicted, were taken from
the hands of the civil power, and condemned to work in chains on
the roads of the colony for the full term of their sentence,
after which they were to return to service in the ranks. On an
appointed day the garrison of Sydney were assembled and formed in
a hollow square. The culprits were brought out, their uniforms
stripped off and replaced by the convict dress; iron-spiked
collars and heavy chains, made expressly for the purpose by order
of the governor, were rivetted to their necks and legs, and then
they were drummed out of the regiment, and marched back to gaol
to the tune of "The Rogue's March." Sudds, who was in bad health
at the time of his sentence (from an affection of the liver),
overcome with shame, grief, and disappointment&mdash;oppressed by
his chains, and exhausted by the heat of the sun on the day of
the exposure in the barrack-square&mdash;died in a few days.
Thompson became insane.</p>
<p>A great outcry was raised in the colony: the opposition paper
attacked, the official paper defended, the conduct of the
governor. The colony became divided into two parties. Until the
end of his administration, Sir Ralph Darling, whose whole system
was a compound of military despotism and bureaucracy, was
pertinaciously worried by a section which included some of the
best and some of the worst men in the colony. Combining together
for the extension of the liberties of the colony, they found in
the Sudds and Thompson case "the inestimable benefit of a
grievance."</p>
<p>It would be unjust to consider Sir Ralph Darling's sentence by
the light of public opinion in England. He was governor of a
colony in which more than half the community were slaves and
criminals; he had to punish and to arrest the progress of a
dangerous crime; but he fell into the error of exercising, by
<i>ex post facto</i> decree, as the representative of the
sovereign, powers which no sovereign has exercised since the time
of Henry VIII., and violated one of the cardinal principles of
the British constitution, by rejudging and aggravating the
punishment of men who had already been judged. At the present day
it is, as we before observed, only as an historical landmark that
we recal attention to this transaction, which can never be
repeated in British dominions.</p>
<p>During General Darling's government further successful
explorations of the interior were made, both by private
individuals and officials. Among the latter were Major (now Sir
Thomas) Mitchell, Mr. Allan Cunningham, Mr. Oxley, and Captain
Sturt, the most fortunate of all. In his second expedition, in
1829, Captain Sturt embarked with a party in a boat on the
Morrumbidgee (which receives the waters of the Macquarie, the
Lachlan, and Darling), until he came to its junction with the
Murray, an apparently noble stream. Pursuing his voyage, in spite
of many impediments, hardships, and dangers, from rocks, snags,
sandbanks, and hostile savages, he reached the Lake Alexandrina,
and discovered the future province of South Australia. This 83
lake is a shallow sheet of water, sixty miles in length and forty
miles in breadth, which interposes between the sea and the river,
thus presenting an impassable obstacle to ocean communication.
The hopes excited by the discovery of this picturesque river have
hitherto not been realised. Although broad, deep, and bordered by
rich land for many score miles, the perpetual recurrence of
shallows limits the draught of water to two feet, at which depth
steamers cannot be profitably navigated. Captain Sturt, having
made this important discovery, returned by reascending the river.
In consideration of these and other services rendered to South
Australia, the new Legislative Council of that colony have
recently voted to Captain Sturt, who has unfortunately become
blind, a pension of £500&mdash;an act of liberality for which no
precedent is to be found in the proceedings of the other
settlements.</p>
<p>In October, 1831, General Darling resigned his government, and
after an interregnum of two months, filled by Colonel Lindsay,
was succeeded by General Sir Richard Bourke.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<h4>GOVERNOR BOURKE.<br>
<br>
1831 TO 1838.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Major-General Sir Richard Bourke,
K.C.B</span>., became Governor of New South Wales in December,
1831, and retired in November, 1837. He was, without question,
the ablest man who had as yet occupied that office; equal in
zeal, energy, and plain common sense to Macquarie; superior in
the liberality, humanity, and statesmanlike far-sightedness of
his views. With wise self-reliance he resisted the blandishments
of the official clique who have been the curse of all our
colonies, and the opposition of the faction of white
slave-drivers, who looked upon the colony as a farm to be
administered for their sole benefit. He had courage, too, of a
rare quality, for he dared to differ from his chief, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, on a vital point of
administration. His recorded objections to the Wakefield land
system are remarkable for their prophetic wisdom. Sir Richard
was, and his memory still is, deservedly popular among the
humble, or the wealthy sons of the once humble settlers&mdash;a
rare merit, and not a qualification for favour at the Colonial
Office. The six years of his reign were crowded with measures and
events of the utmost importance in the history of New South
Wales.</p>
<p>1. The discussions of the Legislative Council became public,
and the financial estimates were regularly submitted and
discussed.</p>
<p>2. The Church and School Corporation (which had become a gross
job) was abolished, and religious equality established by an act
of the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>3. An attempt was made to introduce the Irish national school
system (which the bigots defeated).</p>
<p>4. Free grants of land were abolished, and sale by auction at
a minimum price of 5s. substituted.</p>
<p>5. The despatch was received from Lord Glenelg, and steps were
adopted which, in 1840, finally abolished transportation to New
South Wales.</p>
<p>6. The squatting system was legalised and systematised on a
plan which has since produced nearly £60,000 per annum.</p>
<p>7. Rules for regulating the number of convict servants to
which each settler should be entitled (without favour), and the
number of lashes which should be inflicted on a convict servant
by a single magistrate, were framed and promulgated.</p>
<p>8. Port Phillip was peopled by settlers from Van Diemen's
Land, and South Australia by colonists from England.</p>
<p>The powers of the executive council imposed on the Governor of
New South Wales in the last year of Sir Thomas Brisbane's
administration were, under Sir Ralph Darling, almost nominal. Not
only were its deliberations secret and its dissent powerless, but
Governor Darling illegally and systematically exercised authority
in the only matter entrusted to the council&mdash;the
distribution of the revenues. Towards the close of his
administration he introduced a bill indemnifying himself, and
legalising his illegal assumptions. Sir Richard Bourke, on the
contrary, earnestly co-operated in raising the character of the
council, treated the non-official members with the utmost
respect, and endeavoured to give the council, as far as possible,
the tone and functions of a representative assembly; a course
directly the reverse of his successor, Sir George Gipps. Both
were able, but the one was a frank and generous, the other an
astute and jealous man. It is very much to be regretted that
Governor Bourke had not been permitted to govern with as little
interference from Secretaries of State as Governor Macquarie, and
to remain long enough to initiate the partly elective council
which fell into the unhappy hands of his successor.</p>
<h5>THE LAWS OF LAND TENURE.</h5>
<p>First in importance among the legislative changes effected by
Sir Richard Bourke's government, must be ranked the "Order in
Council," subsequently embodied in an act of parliament, by which
sales by auction, at a minimum upset price of 5s. per acre,
superseded free grants of land; and the act of the Colonial
Legislative Council, by which pastoral occupations of the vast
territories beyond the surveyed limits of the colony (colonially,
the Bush) were legalised, placed under the control of special
commissioners, and charged with a rent in the shape of a
licence-fee and a poll-tax.</p>
<p>From these two sources (the sale of land and pastoral or
squatting rents) a fund has been derived, which, during the last
twenty years, has conveyed to Australia more than one hundred
thousand free emigrants, selected from the poorest labourers of
the United Kingdom. The introduction of these labouring emigrants
rendered the abolition, first of the assignment system, and
finally of transportation, possible.</p>
<p>Here it may be convenient to review the various "land-laws"
which had prevailed in the colony up to the time when those
changes were introduced, which occupied so important a place in
colonial discussions during the government of Sir Richard Bourke
and his successor.</p>
<p>From the foundation of the colony in 1788 to 1824, regulations
for the disposal of land were left entirely in the hands of the
governor. From time to time the home Government exercised the
right of bestowing grants upon such persons as were willing to
proceed to the colony to occupy them. Up to 1818 free passages,
as well as grants of land, were offered to such free emigrants as
were willing to proceed to the colony, with rations for two
years.</p>
<p>Thus, John M'Arthur, in 1804, after reporting the result of
his experiments for naturalising the merino in New South Wales
before the Privy Council, received a grant of fifty thousand
acres, to be selected with the permission of the governor, in any
part of the unoccupied territory.</p>
<p>So, too, as long as the settlement depended for subsistence on
imported provisions, lands were bestowed on any man, bond or
free, who would undertake to support himself after the expiration
of the first year of occupation of his farm. With each grant a
certain number of convicts were allowed as labourers for every
eighty acres, who, as well as the settler and his wife, were
rationed for a limited period by the local government, thus
receiving from the government stores, beef, mutton, and flour of
the same quality as that which they themselves had the profit of
selling to the commissariat.</p>
<p>Up to the time of Governor Darling the produce of the colony
was so uncertain, and the means of profitably employing the
prisoners so limited, that every means was adopted to induce
settlers to relieve the Government of the care and cost of
convicts for whom there was no work.</p>
<p>In Macquarie's time the settler usually obtained, in addition
to a supply of farm labourers, the use of a "clearing-gang,"
which cut down, burned, rolled, and cleared the huge trees from
great tracts that no one would have attempted to cultivate
without such assistance.</p>
<p>Under these rude means, up to 1820, the last year of
Macquarie's government, 400,000 acres passed into the hands of
private individuals. Brisbane granted 180,000 acres at a yearly
quit rent of 2s. per 100 acres, and 573,000 at 15s. annual quit
rent per 100 acres; he also sold between December, 1824, and May,
1825, 369,050 acres at 5s. an acre, giving a long credit, with a
quit rent of 2s. per 100 acres in addition. In 1828, under
Darling, the total number of acres alienated amounted to
2,906,346. But this acreage cannot, for any useful purpose, be
compared with that of cultivated Europe; large patches and vast
continuous tracts are so barren or so thickly timbered as to be
of no more value than those Connemara estates offered for sale at
5s. an acre, and dear at the money.</p>
<p>It must also be noted that these quit rents were scarcely ever
collected, but allowed to run in arrear until, under the
government of Sir George Gipps, they exceeded in amount the value
of the whole fee-simple of many estates, and became the source of
a very formidable grievance.</p>
<p>Under Governors Brisbane, Darling, and the first years of
Bourke's government, it was usual to make grants to colonists in
proportion to the amount of capital they imported in cash or
implements of husbandry.</p>
<p>In 1822 Commissioner Bigge recommended that sales of land
contiguous to grants issued in consideration of capital imported
into the colony, should be made at the rate of 10s. an acre for
land in very favourable situations, and 5s. an acre in more
remote situations. But this suggestion remained a dead
letter.</p>
<p>In 1825 Lord Bathurst, as already stated, announced to the
Australian Agricultural Company, but did not carry out his
determination, that instead of free grants as theretofore, land
in New South Wales would be "put up to sale according to a system
similar in many respects to that adopted in the United States of
America." In 1824 the Secretary of State for the Colonies issued
regulations for the disposal of land in New South Wales, of which
the following is an abstract:&mdash;</p>
<p>"1. A division of the whole territory into counties, hundreds,
and parishes, is in progress. When that division shall be
completed, each parish will comprise an area of 25 square miles.
A valuation will be made of the lands throughout the colony, and
an average price will be struck for each parish.</p>
<p>"2. All the lands in the colony not hitherto granted, <i>and
not appropriated for public purposes</i>, will be put up for sale
at the average price thus fixed.</p>
<p>"3. All persons proposing to purchase lands must transmit a
written application to the governor, in a certain prescribed
form, which will be delivered at the surveyor-general's office to
all parties applying, on payment of a fee of two shillings and
sixpence.</p>
<p>"4. The purchase-money must be made by four quarterly
instalments. A discount of 10 per cent. will be allowed for ready
money payments.</p>
<p>"5. The largest quantity of land which will be sold to any
individual, 89,600 acres. The land will generally be put up in
lots of three square miles or 1,920 acres.</p>
<p>"6. Any purchaser who, within ten years of his purchase, shall
by the employment and maintenance of convicts have relieved the
public from a charge equal to ten times the purchase-money, will
have the money returned, but without interest. <i>Each convict
employed for twelve months will be computed as</i> £16 <i>saved
to the public</i>."</p>
<p>Persons desirous of becoming grantees without purchase might
obtain land on satisfying the governor that they had the power
and intention of expending in the cultivation of the land a
capital equal to half the estimated value of it.</p>
<p>On grants of not less than 320 acres, and not more than 2,560
acres, subject to a quit rent of 5 per cent. per annum on the
estimated value, redeemable within the first twenty-five years at
twenty years' purchase, with a credit for one-fifth part of the
sums the grantee might have saved by employing convicts. No quit
rent was required for the first seven years, but the grantee was
subject to forfeiture of his grant if unable, to prove to the
satisfaction of the surveyor-general that he had expended a
capital equal to one-half its value.</p>
<p>Detailed regulations like those above quoted as to expenditure
of capital can never be enforced. In practice, quit rents fell in
arrear and could not be recovered. Thousands of acres granted
were barren and utterly valueless.</p>
<p>In September, 1826, Sir Ralph Darling created a land board,
composed of the Colonial Secretary, the Civil Engineer, and the
Auditor-general of accounts, which issued the following set of
regulations worthy, for their thorough absurdity and
impracticability, of their bureaucratic descendants, the South
Australian commissioners, and the New Zealand Company.</p>
<p>Persons desirous of obtaining land were (1) to apply to the
colonial secretary for a form to be filled up and submitted to
the governor, who (2), if satisfied of the character and
respectability of the applicant, directed the colonial secretary
to supply him with a letter (3) to the land board, in order that
they might carefully investigate the stock articles of husbandry,
&amp;c., and cash, forming part of his capital. On the land board
reporting (4) to the governor satisfactorily as to capital, the
governor furnished the applicant (5) with a letter to the
surveyor-general, <i>who</i> (6) <i>was to give him authority to
proceed in search of land!</i> When he had made his selection he
had to apprise the surveyor-general (7), who twice a month was to
report (8) to the governor such applications; and, if approved
(9) by the governor, the applicant received written authority
(10) to take possession of the land <i>until his Majesty's
pleasure should be known, or the grant made out</i>. Terms as to
quit rents the same as the first set of regulations&mdash;viz.,
5s. per cent. after seven years; grants to be in square miles;
one square mile, 640 acres, for each 500 of capital, to the
extent of four square miles.</p>
<p>Land selected for purchase, not granted, to be valued by the
commissioners, put up for sale, and sold by sealed tender, not
under a price fixed by commissioners. Personal residence, or
residence of a free man as servant or deputy, required on
purchases and grants.</p>
<p>These regulations of Sir Ralph Darling were marked by every
official vice&mdash;unnecessary forms, expense, and uncertainty,
inquisitorial investigation, bribery and corruption among the
subordinates in the various offices; in fact, everything that
could be done, was done to disgust decent, unpolished, unlearned
settlers. They were adopted by the Colonial Office in 1827, and
had the effect of rendering the business of obtaining and
granting land one series of jobs. The home government always
reserved to itself the right of making grants, and exercised it
in a most baneful manner.</p>
<p>One effect, unintentional on the part of the authors of these
cumbrous arrangements for obtaining grants of land, was to
encourage unlicensed squatting in districts unsurveyed, and at
that period allowed to remain in "healthy neglect." So the live
stock increased in spite of the forms of the "land board."</p>
<p>An impartial retrospect of the granting; system, before it was
systematised and encumbered with regulations, leads to the
conclusion that with a just and intelligent governor, it was the
best that could be devised for such a colony.</p>
<p>The attraction of a free passage, with free grants of land and
the use of convict labour which were offered up to 1818, did
secure a certain number of respectable colonists. The free grant
of land made to emigrants, in proportion to their capital, and to
prisoners who had served their term, during the governments of
Macquarie and Brisbane, between 1788 and 1825, with the aid of
convict labour, did colonise and cultivate the country. For
instance, in 1821, the great road across the Blue Mountain to
Bathurst was executed, and rendered practicable for wheeled
vehicles. In 1822 the Hunter River District was a wilderness; in
1827, for a distance of 150 miles along the river, half a million
acres had been surveyed, granted, or sold to settlers whose
capital was estimated at from four to five hundred thousand
pounds, and whose stock included 25,000 horned cattle, and 80,000
fine-woolled sheep. All the improvements, buildings, fences, and
cultivation were effected by assigned servants, whom the
government fed and clothed for the first eighteen months of their
servitude. Nothing but convict labour could have done so much in
public and private works in five years.</p>
<p>Considering the slight offences for which the majority of the
prisoner population of New South Wales had been transported,
between 1788 and 1825, there can be no doubt that had the free
grants of land system been accompanied by measures for
classifying, teaching, and Christianising the convicts, and for
providing, from the destitute parts of the United Kingdom, such
an emigration of women as would have equalised the sexes, the
character of the colony would have been materially changed, and a
population provided well calculated to amalgamate with and rise
to the level of free emigrants, when the time came for abolishing
transportation, and giving up the land which convicts had
pioneered to the use of a free population.</p>
<p>But as it is difficult to obtain a succession of governors,
able and honest enough to bear the responsibility of granting
land when it comes to be of value, it is to be regretted that,
when it was no longer considered necessary to bribe prisoners to
honesty and industry by the prizes in the shape of a farm of wild
land, we did not imitate the simple system by which, during half
a century, the vast territories of the United States have been
colonised, cities founded, harbours constructed, canals cut, and
railroads made.</p>
<p>Under this system the territories for sale are surveyed in
advance, and laid out in lots of eighty acres and upwards, at a
fixed price of a dollar an acre; a mapr containing the land for
sale is open to every intending purchaser; there are no reserves
except for special stated public purposes; parties settling
beyond the bounds of surveyed land do so at their own risk, and
have no power to inflict on the parent state heavy expenses in
armies or officials. They are expected to govern and protect
themselves, and to retire or purchase when the government
surveyor makes his appearance. No doubt the American system has
its defects, but, taken as a whole, it is the best which has ever
been devised for employing a large emigrant population, and
conquering and subduing the earth, at the least possible public
expense.</p>
<p>It is possible that something like it might have eventually
been transplanted to Australia, but a series of accidents threw
that island-continent entirely into the hands of a clique of
political land-jobbers.</p>
<p>In 1829 the colony of Swan River was founded on principles,
under circumstances, and in a situation which ensured
failure.</p>
<p>Mr. Peel, a gentleman who had influence with government,
combined with Sydney merchants to found a colony in some other
part of Australia. The merchants found the money, Mr. Peel the
influence. The large fortunes which had been realised by
colonists in New South Wales led the colonisers to believe that
the same might be realised in a new colony, without the
disadvantage of a convict population.</p>
<p>Swan River, on the north-western coast of Australia, was the
site chosen. Sailors who had visited the shores gave the
favourable reports, as sailors always do of any safe harbour
where they find wood and water enough for their ship's crew.
Geographical reasons led the adventurers to expect a temperate
climate; further precise investigations as to the quality of the
soil, extent of pastures, and character of the aborigines, were
considered unnecessary.</p>
<p>The government, in total ignorance of the simplest principles
of colonisation, did its part by bestowing a million acres on the
founder, and to every other colonist acres in proportion to his
capital in cash, live stock, implements, or the number of
labourers whose passage he paid.</p>
<p>In great haste ships were freighted, and loaded with fine
gentlemen and ladies, farmers and labourers, blood-horses,
short-horned cattle, merino rams, carriages of fashionable build,
and agricultural implements enough for one of the best farmed
English counties. Those who had little money made use of their
credit to obtain consignments which would entitle them to land.
Not one of them doubted that the wild land in an unknown country
would soon be as valuable as in Bedfordshire, or, at any rate, as
on the banks of the River Hunter in New South Wales, and that the
labourers would labour as contentedly for the same wages abroad
as at home.</p>
<p>The first fleet of Western Australian colonists arrived to
find the country not only unsurveyed, but unexplored. They were
disembarked on a narrow slip of beach, bordered by thickets
filled with hostile savages, who speared men and their cattle on
every opportunity. A fine stud of thorough-bred horses perished
for want of fresh water; whole cargoes of furniture and
agricultural implements rolled on the beach without being
unpacked. The labourers repudiated their home engagements, and
obtained exorbitant wages. When the country was further explored,
the quantity of available land turned out to be extremely
limited; the live stock was rapidly consumed for food, while the
remoteness of Swan River from the old colony rendered
importations of any kind difficult, expensive, and uncertain. The
sheep turned out to pasture repeatedly died, poisoned by a plant
which, up to this day, the colonists have been unable to discover
and extirpate.</p>
<p>In a word, planted in a remote district, far from other ports
and out of the track of commerce, with very little land available
for agricultural or pastoral purposes&mdash;what little there was
of the one monopolised by a few hands, much of the other
poisonous; with colonists, both high and low, the most unfitted
by previous education for a rude, self-dependent life, without
leaders or servants of colonial experience, without forced
labour&mdash;the Swan River settlement failed miserably. This
failure would have been confined to the fortunes of the first
colonists, however bad the system of colonisation, had there
been, as in the other settled districts of Australia, vast plains
of sound pasture on which pure-bred merinoes could have fed and
multiplied; or coal, or copper, or gold to be had for digging;
but there was nothing, and is nothing up to the present hour,
beyond the bare means of sustenance; thus, without a single
staple export, Swan River, in spite of a series of systems of
colonisation, has never been able to rise from the condition of
an eleemosynary dependency, supported by the bounty of the parent
state. With the failure of Swan River the system of free grants
of land ended in Australia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>
<h4>ORIGIN OF THE WAKEFIELD SYSTEM.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> apparently digressive sketch of the
colonisation of Western Australia and its lamentable results is
rendered necessary by the fact, that on the failure of Western
Australia a new theory of colonisation was floated into public
notice and incorporated in our colonial legislation and
administration.</p>
<p>It was in 1829 that a sensation was produced in the literary
and political world of London by the appearance of a little book
entitled "A Letter from Sydney," the principal town of
Australasia (edited by Robert Gouger), which was soon known to be
the production of Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield. Out of this book
grew the "High-Priced Land System of the Three Colonies" the
monopoly of wild lands at a nominal rent, which the squatters now
enjoy the colonisation of South Australia and New Zealand some
good, and a world of misery, ruin, social and political
estrangement, of which we have not yet seen the end.</p>
<p>This "Letter from Sydney," by far the most brilliant of the
many works on colonisation by the same author, is now out of
print. It contains so clear a statement of the origin, merits,
and objects of a theory which was at one time accepted,
supported, and acted on by almost every statesman, political
economist, and journalist of eminence, that the following
abstract of its contents will not be out of place.</p>
<p>The writer represents himself to be an English gentleman of
large fortune and refined tastes, who has emigrated under the
idea that an estate of twenty thousand acres in Australia would
procure the same comforts, income, and consideration that an
estate of a thousand acres would in England. He says "I have got
20,000 acres for a mere trifle, and I imagined that a domain of
that extent would be very valuable. In this I was wholly
mistaken. As my estate cost next to nothing, so it is worth next
to nothing. The trees on my property, if growing in any part of
England, would be worth at least £150,000. The best thing that
could happen to me would be the annihilation of all this natural
produce; but the cost of destroying it would be at least
£15,000." He then goes on to enumerate mines of iron and coal
which would make him "a peer in England," but which are valueless
for want of labour or roads. "I did not, you know, intend to
become a farmer. Having fortune enough for all my wants, I
proposed to get a large domain, to build a good house, to keep
enough land in my own hands for pleasure grounds, park, and game
preserves, and to let the rest, after erecting farmhouses in
suitable spots. <i>My mansions, park, preserves, and tenants,
were all a mere dream</i>. There is no such class as a tenantry
in this country, where every man who has capital to cultivate a
farm can have one of his own." He then graphically describes the
miseries of a solitary life to a man accustomed to the elegant
luxuries of civilised life. His "own man" leaves him, and invests
his savings in a small farm. He imports labourers and mechanics
from England, and they leave him without repaying the cost of
their passage. He observes to a friend, "Were you a broken
farmer, or a poor lieutenant, I should say, come here by all
means; you cannot be placed more unhappily than at present, and
you may gain by the change. But I <i>am advising a man of
independent fortune</i>, who prefers his library even to the
beauties of nature, and to whom intellectual society is necessary
for his peace of mind. I thought at one time of establishing a
dairy; but my cows were as wild as hyaenas, and almost as wicked.
I had no dairy woman, no churns, no anything that was wanted;
<i>and, above all, I wanted industry, skill, economy, and taste,
for any such pursuits</i>, or, at least, a drudge of a wife to
supply those wants." He then paints an amusing although
exaggerated picture of the want of intellectual society in a
colonial town.</p>
<p>Having come to the conclusion that the colony would fall into
total barbarism whenever the abolition of the convict assignment
system should leave the colonists dependent on free labour, he
proceeds to state the cause of these miseries&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Fons et origo malorum."</p>
<p>The whole evil, according to this unfortunate gentleman, of
fortune without "industry, skill, economy, or taste for
agricultural or pastoral pursuits," lies in <i>cheap land</i>,
which produces <i>dear labour</i>, by drawing labourers into
landowners, by promoting dispersion&mdash;by deterring men from
renting land, as they prefer freehold. Dear labour obstructs
improvements in agriculture, in public works, in arts, in
science. There being no tenants and few servants, there is no
easy, refined, intellectual class: mere mechanics, labourers, and
even common farmers and poor lieutenants, such in fact as suffer
privations in lands where labour is cheap, are the only persons
who enjoy colonial life. With cheap land and dear labour,
colonists could get the advantage of the presence of such
emigrants as the letter-writer.</p>
<p>The remedy propounded in 1829, (repeated with equal confidence
in 1849,) is to make land so dear that labourers shall not be
able to obtain possession of land "too soon"&mdash;to affix to
all colonial land what Mr. Wakefield calls in another work a
"<i>hired labour price</i>." And further, that the money for
which the land sold should be devoted to the importation of the
redundant labour of the mother country&mdash;an importation which
he advises should be conducted <i>with a view to the greatest
benefit of the capitalist</i>,&mdash;that is to say, it should
consist entirely of young married couples under five-and-twenty
years of age, unencumbered by children or parents. "Family
Colonisation" had no charms for Gibbon Wakefield.</p>
<p>Thus supplied with ample cargoes of healthy young labourers of
both sexes, debarred by a sufficient price from becoming
freeholders, the writer of the letter from Sydney "promises that
the capitalists shall find ample profitable employment for their
capital, shall concentrate population, carry on model farming,
cultivate art and science."</p>
<p>But he anticipates one important question which he answers
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It becomes clear that the object we have in view may be
attained by fixing some considerable price on waste land. Still,
how is the proper price to be ascertained? Frankly, I confess I
do not know. I believe that it could be determined only by
experience." This was in 1829. Twenty years later, in 1849, after
having experimented on New South Wales, and on three colonies in
New Zealand, and provided for all his relations in snug colonial
berths, he says,&mdash;"It is here that I have been frequently
and tauntingly required to mention what I deem the sufficient
price; but I have hitherto avoided falling into the trap which
that demand upon me really is. I could do that certainly for some
colony with which I am particularly well acquainted, but I should
do so doubtingly and with hesitation, for the elements of
calculation are so many and so complicated, in their various
relations to each other, that in depending on them exclusively
there would be liability to error."</p>
<p>We may observe that this caution in naming price only extended
to books and pamphlets, as Mr. Wakefield never hesitated to
assure those who bought lots of land in his model colonies that
they would enjoy all the advantages it was presumed a
<i>sufficient price</i> would confer. Therefore, of course, the
colonising purchasers, seeing Mr. Wakefield in constant
communication with the managers of each colony, took it for
granted that 12s. in South Australia, or 20s. at Wellington, New
Zealand, or 30s. at Nelson, and £3 at Canterbury, according to
the colony, was the "<i>sufficient price</i>."</p>
<p>At the period when this theory, in every respect so plausible,
was propounded, there were no adverse critics except mere
colonists, and they were silenced with a jest, or a sneer at
their selfish jealousy. And it is not extraordinary, for seldom
has a chapter of political economy been clothed in language of
such eloquence as adorned and enlivened the pages of the "Letter"
from Sydney. It contains passages (the picture of the Italian
girl&mdash;the journey from Alexandria to Genoa)&mdash;so
beautiful, so warm, so real, that one cannot help regretting, for
the sake of his own happiness and reputation, as well as of his
numerous colonising victims, that Gibbon Wakefield had not
devoted himself to writing novels and travels, instead of puffs,
paragraphs, articles, pamphlets, and books in praise of joint
stock and lottery colonisation.</p>
<p>But Mr. Wakefield had to assist him in propagating his tenets
not only the charm of "style," but of personal fascination, with
a more than Protean adaptativeness, which rendered him the friend
and bosom adviser of Republicans and Radicals, Whig and
Conservative Peers, Low Church and High Church Bishops. Five
secretaries of state for the colonies&mdash;Lords Glenelg and
Stanley, Monteagle, Aberdeen, and Grey&mdash;have been more or
less his pupils; the influence of his writings&mdash;even
quotations from them&mdash;are to be found in their despatches;
while so late as 1850, he led, or rather sent captive, to
Canterbury, New Zealand, a crowd of educated victims.</p>
<p>Energetic, tenacious, indefatigable, unscrupulous, with a
wonderful talent for literary agitation, for simultaneously
feeding a hundred journalists with the same idea arid the same
illustrations in varying language, for filling eloquent, but
indolent, orators with telling speeches; at one time he had
rallied round him nearly every rising man of political
aspirations, and secured the support of nearly every economical
writer of any celebrity. He has shaken a ministry, founded and
distributed the patronage of at least two colonies, and left the
seeds, after nearly exciting open rebellion in a third.</p>
<p>But one hard unvarying undercurrent of fact destroyed the
edifice of fame and fortune which seemed rising under the
influence of Gibbon Wakefield, with his troops of friends, his
fiery orators, his city bankers, his well-descended nobles, his
bishops of all hues&mdash;Whig, Tory, and Trimmer&mdash;Hinde,
Exeter, and Oxford. The results of his theory, his best arranged
plans, were, invariably disastrous. His disciples only continued
his disciples as long as they sat at the desk critical,
speculated within reach of Threadneedle-street, or reclined on
the soft benches of the Houses of Parliament. No sooner did the
colonisers become colonists than they renounced him and all his
works.</p>
<p>We are willing to admit Gibbon Wakefield's first experiment in
colonisation was perfectly legitimate, although the manner in
which he hunted down all who ventured to question his views was
as inexcusable as the recklessness with which he sacrificed
established colonies in order to prop up his model speculation.
For like the Bourbons, he forgets nothing and learns nothing;
fiercely implacable, he has neither candour, nor truth, nor
humility. In 1849, in order to float off his Canterbury
colonisation scheme, he published "The Art of Colonisation," a
volume of 500 pages, which, as regards the land question, is
merely an amplification, in a diffuse style, with the same
arguments and even the same illustrations, of the theories so
fervidly propounded in 1829. Not a sentence, not a word, does the
book contain of Mr. Wakefield's twenty years' experience, during
which he had directed the colonisation, with successive
variations in detail, but always on the "sufficient price," or
"hired labour price" system, of four colonies&mdash;South
Australia, Wellington, Nelson, New Plymouth, beside planning half
a dozen others. Not a hint that the "Wakefield theory" had, in
every colony in which it had been attempted, ruined all those who
put faith in it, and been acknowledged to be absurd and
impracticable by the intimate friends and brothers of the
theorist.</p>
<br>
<p>In New South Wales the year 1830 was marked by a change from
the complicated system of sales at quit rents and free grants to
uniform system of sale by auction at 5s. an acre, which, in
effect, except for choice lots, was a fixed price of 5s. an acre,
for practically there was no competition. Whether this change was
brought about by the ventilation of Mr. Wakefield's theories, it
is impossible to say.</p>
<p>The announcement of land for sale by auction at the minimum
upset price of 5s. an acre soon brought money into the government
chest. Those who had occupied land of a superior quality near
their grants purchased their occupations; others rounded off
their grants, and took in slices of land for the sake of
uniformity, for a natural boundary for pasture, or for access to
water; others, who had not had either influence or patience, or
time to wade through the dreary forms of Governor Darling's land
board, indulged in freehold as soon as it became a mere matter of
money. This was especially the case with a considerable section
of the emancipist population.</p>
<p>Governor Bourke had distributed a number of ten-acre grants on
the alluvial flats of rivers among poor prisoners of good conduct
before the sales by auction were sanctioned.</p>
<p>During the years between 1831 and 1836, great encouragement to
purchase land was held out by the facility for obtaining the
labour of prisoners without favour on fixed terms; by the large
purchases of produce by the commissariat; and the activity with
which the governor prosecuted road-making wherever land was
settled. The result was a rapid and annual accession of funds to
the colonial Treasury.</p>
<p>The news of the avidity with which both colonists and
absentees purchased wild land, which the government imagined it
had been giving away for nothing, or for a nominal price, ever
since the foundation of the colony, appears to have inflamed the
imagination of the colonial department of Downing-street; and
very soon the Colonial Office began to think and act as if it had
discovered an exhaustless treasure, which could be sold in any
quantity and at any price they chose to fix. Just as in 1845,
when all the British public was mad on railways, there were
parties who believed that because one or two lines paid 10 per
cent., all lines would pay 10 per cent., and therefore wished
government to buy up and complete the whole net-works of iron
roads, and pay off the national debt with the profits.</p>
<p>In like manner, in the course of a few years after the
publication of Mr. Wakefield's theories, the whole colonial
possessions of Great Britain were surveyed, on maps only, priced,
and offered for sale at sums per acre in which intrinsic value
formed no element of the calculation.</p>
<p>The one part of the Wakefield theory for which the author
deserved credit, was the application of part of the purchase
money of land to the introduction of free emigrants in equal
numbers of both sexes. Thus, preparation was made for
substituting free for convict labour.</p>
<p>The first five years of land sales at 5s. an acre, including
the acreage sold by Governors Brisbane and Darling, and paid for
in those years, amounted to £176,435, of which the last year
amounted to £89,380. During the same period £31,028 only was
expended in introducing 3,079 emigrants.</p>
<p>But in 1835 two events occurred which materially affected the
colonising fortunes of Australia. A party of stockowners from the
Island of Van Diemen's Land, in which the accessible pastures had
been nearly all appropriated, crossed Bass's Straits, and
established themselves on the shores of Port Phillip Bay, on the
River Yarra Yarra; about the same time squatters, pushing on
westward over the plains of Maneroo, gradually extended their
pastures overland, while whalers settled at Portland Bay in the
same district. And before the government of New South Wales,
within which this territory was included under Governor Phillip's
commission, acknowledged the existence of the settlement of Port
Phillip, many thousand sheep and cattle were feeding over the
finest plains that had yet been discovered in the vicinity of a
natural port. These "unauthorised squatters," as they were called
in a despatch, poured into the new land with such rapidity that
the home government was very unwillingly obliged to sanction the
measures for their recognition and settlement which had been
taken by Governor Bourke.</p>
<p>At the same time that the Tasmanians were swarming across
Bass's Straits, and the pastors of New South Wales were marching
overland with their flocks to this and other new lands of
promise, in England a commission had been issued, an act of
Parliament obtained, and a charter granted for colonising South
Australia (the unexplored tract of land, traversed by a river
which the adventurous Sturt had descended and ascended in 1829,
and named South Australia), on the "sufficient price" principle
propounded by Gibbon Wakefield in his "Letter from Sydney."</p>
<p>The history of the origin, rise, progress, fall, and revival
of South Australia, will be found duly chronicled in the chapter
devoted to that province. We refer to it here in order to show
how the speculations of the South Australian colonisers affected
the progress of New South Wales and Port Phillip.</p>
<p>Their scheme was floated on the success of New South Wales and
the failure of Swan River.</p>
<p>Give us, they said to the legislature and the stock-jobbing
public, the territory we mark on the map; the right of imposing a
"sufficient price" on the land, and of applying it to the
importation of labour; and we will render labour cheap by the
exclusion of labourers from the possession of land, concentrate
society, introduce agriculture as scientific as that of Great
Britain, in addition to the productions of Spain and Italy, reap
all the profits that have been reaped in New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land, without the taint of convict labour, or "the
dispersion of the semi-barbarous squatter;" and we will produce a
state of society so prosperous and so charming, that the
neighbouring cheap-priced convict colonies shall hasten to follow
our example.</p>
<p>As they desired so it was granted to them; and under "South
Australia" we shall tell how bands of youths and maidens, and old
men who had not gained wisdom with their grey hairs, went singing
in triumph to sit down in a sandy plain and spend two years in
gambling for town lots and village lots, with their own and with
borrowed paper money; and how they sank into a slough of
despondency, and were only saved by resorting to the people and
pursuits they had been taught to despise.</p>
<p>But the South Australian interest&mdash;an interest much more
successful in its parliamentary tactics than in its colonising
operations&mdash;in the course of a few years succeeded in
raising the price of land successively from 5s. to a minimum of
12s. and 20s.; in inoculating the Colonial Office with their own
notions as to the value of wild land and the injurious effects of
dispersion; and in suddenly, without due preparation, abolishing
the assignment system, which supplied the greater part of the
pastoral and agricultural labour in the colony.</p>
<p>So early as 1834 the Earl of Aberdeen, then Secretary of State
for the Colonies, appears, from a despatch addressed to Governor
Bourke on the subject of the vast extensions of the pastoral
interest in every accessible direction, but especially toward the
unexplored Port Phillip district, to have embraced Mr.
Wakefield's doctrine as to the banefulness of dispersion. Both
the theorist and the statesman were applying the rules of an
agricultural to a pastoral state of society. They were looking to
the condition of the Lothians, when they should have been
studying the history of the Patriarchs. And although the
squatting system was then in its infancy and not one-third of the
territory was then explored that has since been occupied, Lord
Aberdeen expressed a strong opinion "that it was not desirable to
allow the population to become more scattered than it then
was."</p>
<p>In 1836 a committee of the House of Commons, appointed under
the influence of Mr. Wakefield's parliamentary disciples, made a
report in favour of that gentleman's principles of colonisation,
after hearing evidence which consisted almost entirely of
witnesses interested in the South Australian speculation, and
which did not include a single colonist from New South Wales.
After this report, Lord Glenelg, then Colonial Secretary,
authorised the Governor of New South Wales to raise the price of
land to 12s. if he thought fit.</p>
<p>The replies of Sir Richard Bourke on the two questions of
"dispersion" and price of land, place him in the first rank of
colonising statesmen; they display a degree of foresight which we
can now duly appreciate:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Admitting," he said in answer to Lord Aberdeen, "as every
reasonable person must, that a certain degree of concentration is
necessary for the advancement of wealth and civilisation, and
that it enables government to become at once more efficient and
more economical, I cannot avoid perceiving the peculiarities
which in this colony render it impolitic, and even impossible, to
restrain dispersion within limits that would be expedient
elsewhere. The wool of New South Wales forms at present its chief
wealth. The proprietors of thousands of acres find it necessary,
equally with the poorer settlers to send large flocks beyond the
boundaries of location, to preserve them in health throughout the
year. The colonists must otherwise restrain the increase, or
endeavour to raise artificial food for their stock. Whilst nature
presents all around an unlimited supply of wholesome pasture,
either course would seem a perverse rejection of the bounty of
Providence. Independently of these powerful reasons for allowing
dispersion it is not to be disguised that government is unable to
prevent it. *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
The question I beg leave to submit is simply this: How may
government turn to the best advantage a state of things which it
cannot wholly interdict? It may be found practicable, by means of
the sale of land in situations peculiarly advantageous, however
distant from other locations, by establishing townships and
ports, and facilitating the intercourse between remote and more
settled districts of this vast territory, to provide centres of
civilisation and government, and thus gradually extend the power
of social order to the most distant parts of the wilderness."</p>
<p>In answer to the suggestion for raising the price of land,
made at the instance of Colonel Torrens, chairman of the South
Australian speculation, who found "semi-barbarous" Port Phillip a
serious rival to his model colony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Whatever minimum is fixed, there will be found instances in
which land acquired at that price without opposition will prove a
cheap bargain; but such is not often the case. Land even of very
inferior quality, happening to possess a peculiar value to the
individual purchasing in consequence of its proximity to his
other property, finds a sale solely on that account, cannot be
considered as cheaply obtained, even at the minimum price. The
cases in which land is sold without opposition, from ignorance of
its marketable value on the part of the public, or from the
secret agreement or friendly forbearance of those otherwise
interested in bidding against each other, must diminish yet more
and more as the colony advances in wealth and population; nor are
such accidents, even if they were more numerous, deserving of
much consideration. <i>It is upon general tendencies and results
that all questions of public policy are to be decided</i>.</p>
<p>"The lands now in the market form a surplus, in many cases a
<i>refuse</i>, consisting of lands which in past years were not
saleable at any price, and were not sought after even as free
grants.</p>
<p>"By deciding to dispose of them at 5s. an acre, it by no means
follows that they will be sold at a higher rate. The result may
be to retain them for an indefinite time unsold, a result more
certain in consequence of the alternative at the settler's
command of wandering over the vast tracts of the interior. A
facility for acquiring land at a low price is the safest check to
this practice. The wealthiest colonists are continually balancing
between the opposite motives presented by the cheapness of (then)
unauthorised occupation on the one hand, and the desire of adding
to their permanent property on the other. The influence of the
latter motive must be weakened in proportion to the augmentation
of the upset price.</p>
<p>"<i>It is possible that the augmentation of the minimum price
would have the injurious effect of checking the immigration of
persons possessed of small capital, desirous of establishing
themselves upon land of their own</i>."</p>
<p>We shall hereafter show that all Sir Richard Bourke's
predictions were realised. To this hour, in the midst of settled
districts, large tracts of land remain the haunt of wild dogs and
vermin, which are no more likely to be worth £1 an acre in twenty
years to come than they were twenty years ago, unless they turn
out to be gold fields.</p>
<p>Parallel with the new arrangement, which enabled every man
with money to buy a farm, and filled the colonial treasury to
overflowing, the pastoral system, which, at the least possible
expenditure for labour, raised a vast exportable produce in wool,
was extending itself both east and west,&mdash;daily discovering
new pastures, and driving the emu, the kangaroo, and the
aborigine before armies of soft-fleeced merinoes.</p>
<p>In the early days of the colony, landowners grazed near their
grants without paying anything for what in fact was valueless
except to them. As the population of Sydney increased a charge of
2s. 6d. per 100 acres was imposed on wild lands, conveniently
situated for pasture.</p>
<p>No instance occurred of refusing-this privilege at this rent
on unoccupied land until the time of Governor Darling, who
refused to permit the editor of a paper which had ridiculed his
government to rent additional land for his increasing herds.</p>
<p>Beyond the boundaries of settlement&mdash;colonially "the
bush"&mdash;no rent was charged, and until Governor Bourke took
the matter in hand, club-law prevailed. It was not unusual for a
great squatter to drive a small one out of a district of peculiar
richness in grass or water by what was called "eating him out;"
that is to say, sending such a flock as would, in four-and-twenty
hours, devour every blade within many miles of the small
settler's hut, until Sir Richard Bourke, to a certain extent,
extended the operation of the law beyond the boundary. He seems
to have been the only governor, with the exception of Macquarie,
thoroughly impressed with the necessity of encouraging and
protecting against the prejudices of the great settlers a class
of agricultural yeomanry. It was the policy of Sir George Gipps,
acting under his instructions, to throw every impediment in the
way of freehold farms for those who, not rich enough to become
great flockowners, were not willing to become mere shepherds.
Governor Bourke saw through the selfishness of the colonial
monopolists, in the shape of great flockholders, who, forgetting
their own or their fathers' original insignificance, grudged
every acre and every head of stock that fell to the share of
hardworking men; he was not led away by a cry against the frugal
peasantry, who fed small flocks or a few cattle on wild land. He
observes, in a despatch of 18th December, 1835:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Another cause to which Judge Burton attributes the prevalence
of crime in this colony, is the occupation of waste lands by
improper persons. <i>The persons to whom Mr. Burton alludes,
familiarly called 'squatters,' * are the objects of great
animosity on the part of the wealthier settlers</i>. It must be
confessed they are only following in the steps of all the most
influential and unexceptionable colonists, whose sheep and cattle
stations are everywhere to be found side by side with the
obnoxious squatter, and held by no better title.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I trust I
shall be able to devise some measure that may moderate the evil
complained of, <i>without putting a weapon into the hands of
selfishness and oppression</i>.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* ." And again,
in September, 1836:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* The great flockowners had not at that time
appropriated the term squatter to themselves, as they did soon
afterwards. Before Bourke's time they chiefly fed their flocks on
grants.]</p>
<p>"There is a natural disposition on the part of the wealthy
stockholders to exaggerate the <i>offences of the poorer classes
of intruders upon crown lands, and an equal unwillingness to suit
themselves to such restraints as are essential to the due and
impartial regulation of this species of occupancy</i>. Of the
former disposition I have had ample proof in the result of an
inquiry lately instituted as to the number of ticket-of-leave
holders in unauthorised occupation of crown land. The dishonest
practices of this class of persons in such occupation had been
represented as one of the principal evils which required a
remedy. I have, however, discovered from the returns of the
magistrates, which I called for, that not more than twenty to
thirty ticket-of-leave holders occupy crown lands throughout the
whole colony, and of these a great proportion are reported to be
particularly honest and industrious."</p>
<p>Out of this despatch grew the pastoral or crown land rents,
which produced, the year before the gold discovery, upwards of
forty thousand a year, and which&mdash;although less equitably
worked than Sir Richard Bourke intended, or would have permitted
had he remained long enough to adapt the details to the
circumstances of the colony&mdash;had, doubtless, a great effect
in stimulating the growth of the pastoral resources of
Australia.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Bourke divided the wild land or bush, beyond the
boundaries of the settled districts, into "squatting districts,"
each under the charge of a "Commissioner of Crown Lands." An
annual licensing fee was charged to each squatter for his
occupation, and a poll-tax on his stock. Advantages of
pre-emption were, by custom, conceded to the discoverers of new
pastures. In arranging this system, it seems Sir Richard Bourke
did not expect to obtain a greater revenue than would defray the
expenses of the machinery which superseded club law by
magistrates and police.</p>
<p>Thus it will be observed that under Governor Bourke, the means
of obtaining either the absolute possession of land in
fee-simple, or the use for pastoral purposes, were systematised
and simplified. It ceased to be a matter of favour, of
complicated form, or of bribery to subordinates; and what was
still more important, and directly reverse to the policy of his
successor, the administration was conducted on the principle that
the possession of land could not be made too easy to those who
were disposed to occupy or cultivate it.</p>
<p>Sir Richard believed that he was best serving the interest of
his sovereign by promoting the prosperity of colonists of all
classes, by permitting them to follow their pursuits in their own
way, so long as they did not injure each other. He did not think
a few acres, more or less, were of the least consequence to the
crown; he thought capital would be better employed in the hands
of the colonists than in the treasury of the colony; therefore he
never attempted like his successor to extract the uttermost
farthing by haggling at land sales, or dreamed of treating
worthless, limitless forests as if they were plantations of
English oaks, or of laying claim to such waifs as "Australian
guano." In fact he believed that he was serving the crown by
administering the colony for the benefit of the colonists; he did
not pretend, like Cyrus, to force upon them a garment they did
not like, or to teach them how to transact their own
business.</p>
<p>But while these reforms were being so wisely carried out, and
cultivation among small proprietors and sheep-feeding among the
rich was daily adding wealth and stability to the colony, the
Home Government, worked upon by the parliamentary evidence, the
literary agitation, and the so far successful speculations of the
South Australian interest, became inoculated with most
extravagant ideas of the value of wild lands, and of the
necessity of asserting, with the utmost rigour, the rights of the
crown to everything worth or supposed to be worth a shilling.
There were many excuses for an infatuation which has since cost
colonists dear in Australia, New Zealand, and Natal, and induced
this country to make expensive wars on the Maories and Boers,
besides keeping up expensive colonising establishments at such
wretched outposts as the Falkland Islands.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* By valuing wild land at a farming price, it
became easy to put a Governor on the estimates instead of a
lieutenant with a file of marines.]</p>
<p>In the new colonies of South Australia and Port Phillip,
enormous prices were given by infatuated speculators for town and
country lots, and for a time enormous profits, or apparent
profits, were realised. A land mania very soon infected New South
Wales. This mania was supported by an influx of emigrants from
England, with capital and without experience. Into the details of
this mania we shall enter more precisely in a future chapter. It
is enough for our present information to observe that after a
time all ranks and ages were carried away by the infatuation.
Everything rose in price; the colonial treasury was overflowing
with the produce of land sales. These funds the governor placed
with the banks. The banks, over supplied with capital, extended
their accommodation, and credit became almost unlimited. Imports
rose enormously. To those who did not look below the surface,
there were all the outward and visible signs of prosperity
produced by the change from grants to sales. In 1837, the last
year of Sir Richard Bourke's government, the land sales produced
upwards of £120,000.</p>
<p>It was about this time that we see a sign of the fatal idea of
the intrinsic value of wild land which had begun to make way in
the Colonial Office, in the refusal of the Secretary of State for
the Colonies to permit a meritorious pilot, who had rendered
essential services, to be rewarded according to colonial custom
by a grant of fifty acres. The secretary, Lord Stanley, saw no
reason for so bestowing her Majesty's land, the said land being
worth nothing to the state, although much to the pilot. From that
time forward rigid adherence to a theory substituted ingratitude,
or money payments, for the previous convenient payment of
fifty-acre grants.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>
<h4>CONVICT LABOUR.</h4>
<p><span class="a">During</span> the six years, between 1831 and
1837, that Sir Richard Bourke had the government of New South
Wales, convicts were introduced at the rate of about three
thousand a year, while the number of free emigrants for that
period, including those introduced at the expense of the land
fund, did not exceed fifteen thousand. The proportion of the
sexes throughout the colony was about thirty women to every
hundred men.</p>
<p>During the government of Brisbane and Darling, able-bodied
convicts had ceased to be an expense to the government; they were
eagerly sought as mechanics, labourers, and shepherds, and their
distribution became an important part of government patronage. A
man on good terms with the powers in office might not only farm,
build a house, furnish it, manufacture carts and agricultural
implements, and carry on any mechanical trade with workmen to
whom he had not to pay any wages except such presents as it
pleased him to make to stimulate their vigilance. The proprietor
of a newspaper, who had criticised some act of Sir Ralph
Darling's government, was punished by the recal to government
service of the prisoner compositors he employed.</p>
<p>One of the early acts of Sir Richard Bourke was to arrange a
set of rules, on which, without favour, and according to priority
of application and extent of occupation, employers were to be
entitled to the use of prisoner servants.</p>
<p>In 1831, Sir Richard Bourke introduced and passed an act, by
which the number of lashes to be inflicted on summary conviction
by a single magistrate were limited to fifty. The moral condition
of the employing classes in the colony at that period may be
imagined from the fact, that for this measure, of justice and
mercy, the governor was assailed with a loud cry of pro-flogging
indignation, and from that time forward was subjected to a
factious opposition and a series of annoyances from the
Plutocracy of the colony, which eventually led to his
resignation. Foremost among his assailants was a Scotchman, of
the name of Mudie, who had had the misfortune to take up his
abode in New South Wales a few years too late, instead of
proceeding to Louisiana or Cuba, where his little peculiarities
might have had full scope, without impertinent interference from
governors or newspapers. Facts which came out in the course of
the trial of six servants of this Mudie, who were all hanged for
an attempt to shoot his overseer, induced Sir Richard Bourke to
strike him out of the commission of the peace. Thereupon this
white slave-driver became a grievance-monger, and wrote a book,
in which, with perfect unconsciousness, he painted his own
picture in such colours as to more than justify his erasure from
the roll of magistrates. The curious and instructive part of the
business was, that Mudie actually succeeded in obtaining a long
string of testimonials in favour of his virtue and humanity from
parties, some of whom were highly respectable.</p>
<p>Yet the following extract unconsciously conveys the severest
satire on the man and the state of society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"A young fellow who had just become free, and had got
himself established on thirty acres of land, with a few pigs,
&amp;c., set off to the factory (female convict barrack), in
search of a wife. On his way he had to pass the estate of Mudie.
In conversation with the wife of the porter he mentioned the
object of his journey. The porter's wife advised him to pay his
addresses to one of her master's convict female servants, whom
she recommended as being both sober and industrious, whereby he
would at once gain a good wife, and spare himself an additional
journey of 140 miles.<br>
<br>
"The young woman was sent for and consented at once. No wonder
that a woman would accept marriage in preference to slavery with
a Mudie. The white slave-driver author then gives the following
dialogue as taking place between himself and the young
couple:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"<i>Marianne</i>&mdash;'I hope your honour will allow me to get
married.'<br>
<br>
"<i>His Honour</i>&mdash;'Married! To whom?'<br>
<br>
"<i>Marianne</i>&mdash; (rather embarrassed) 'To a young man,
your honour.'<br>
<br>
"<i>His Honour</i>&mdash; 'To a young man! What is he?'<br>
<br>
"<i>Marianne</i>&mdash; (her embarrassment increasing) 'I really
don't know.'<br>
<br>
"<i>His Honour</i>&mdash;'What is his name? Where does he
live?'<br>
<br>
"<i>Marianne</i>&mdash;'I don't know. To tell your honour the
truth, I never saw him until just now. Mrs. Parsons sent for me
to speak to him; we agreed to be married, if your honour will
give us leave. It is a good chance for me.'<br>
<br>
"<i>His Honour</i>&mdash; 'Send the young man here.'<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center;">"<i>Enter</i> <span class=
"a">Coelebs</span>.</div>
<br>
"<i>His Honour</i>&mdash;'Well, young man, I am told you wish to
marry Marianne, one of my convict servants. Have you observed the
condition the young woman is in?' (Marianne being 'in the way
that ladies wish to be,' &amp;c.)<br>
<br>
"<i>C&oelig;lebs</i>&mdash;(grinning, as we may imagine Mudie if
some one had offered him the chance of an heiress, old, ugly,
ill-tempered, with a hundred thousand pounds)&mdash;'Why, your
honour, as to that, in a country like this, where women are
scarce, a man shouldn't be too greedy. I'm told the woman is very
sober, and that's the main chance with me. If I go to the
factory, why I might get one in the same way without knowing it,
and that might be the cause of words hereafter; and she might be
a drunken vagabond besides. As to the piccaninny, if it should
happen to be a boy it would soon be useful, and do to look after
the pigs.'"</blockquote>
<p>The American slave-owners are very indignant at the picture of
Legree, painted by their own countrywoman. If they will only take
the trouble to search the convict annals of New South Wales,
Simon Legree will appear mild beside some convict masters.</p>
<p>In 1836-7 a committee of the House of Commons sat on the
subject of transportation, at the instigation of Mr. Gibbon
Wakefield. The object of the promoters was to put a stop to the
source which supplied New South Wales with cheap slave-labour, in
competition with the hired labour of the South Australian
speculation.</p>
<p>Thus, although the subject well deserved investigation, the
promoters were dishonest, the evidence was cooked, the
conclusions were foregone, and the results, although eventually
most advantageous to Australia, retarded criminal reform, and
created vices worse than those which it was intended to
eradicate. Van Diemen's Land was sacrificed, and turned into one
vast overflowing-cesspool of crime.</p>
<p>The government was not to be blamed for the series of mistakes
committed on the subject of transportation. After fifty years'
indifference they were forced by active public opinion to do
something; they were pressed upon by a number of excellent men,
like Archbishop Whateley and Mr. C. Buller, who had been
overpowered by a "case" got up in a manner then new to the House
of Commons, but now perfectly understood. A change that should
have been gradual, and <i>accompanied by the foundation of a new
colony</i>, was made abruptly, at an enormous pecuniary loss and
moral gain to New South Wales, but to the ruin, social and
financial, of Van Diemen's Land, on which alone was poured the
felonry previously distributed over New South Wales.</p>
<p>Governor Bourke was directed to discontinue assignment by a
despatch from Lord Glenelg, dated 26th May, 1837, which took
effect in 1810. In answer to that despatch, Sir Richard Bourke
observes, with his usual good sense, "If the abolition of the
assignment system be resolved on, it should without doubt be
gradual, as the sudden interruption of the accustomed supply of
labour would produce much distress." The system was suddenly
discontinued under Sir George Gipps, and succeeded by the
horrible gang system.</p>
<h5>BOURKE'S CHURCH AND SCHOOL ACT.</h5>
<p>The "Church and School Incorporation," under which one-seventh
of the crown lands was devoted to the support of episcopalian
churches and schools, had not worked well, and in 1833 it was
dissolved by an order of the king in council. The expenses of
management had been large, the receipts small, and the results,
in the extension of religion and education, insignificant.</p>
<p>In the same year Sir Richard Bourke addressed a despatch,
dated 30th September, in which he propounded principles of
religious equality which had a very important influence on the
religious and educational institutions of the colony, and
displayed principles much in advance of the traditions of the
colonial government.</p>
<p>After stating that the followers of the Church of England were
most numerous; that one fifth of the population was Roman
Catholic; that the members of the Church of Scotland were less
numerous, but among the most respectable, consisting almost
entirely of free emigrants; that the annual charge for the Church
of England amounted to £11,542 10s.; for the Church of Scotland
to £600; and for Roman Catholic chaplains and chapels to £1,500;
while Protestant dissenters of several denominations, who had
formed congregations, "received no support from government beyond
some small grants of land for sites of chapels;" that the Church
of England possessed seven churches of stone or brick in or
within forty miles of Sydney, two in more remote districts, and
several less permanent buildings in various places; the Church of
Scotland one respectable building in Sydney, and three temporary
buildings in country districts, the one church having been built
by subscription, aided by a loan from government of £520; the
Roman Catholics one handsome church, towards which the government
had, at various times, granted sums amounting to £1,200; that the
chaplains of the Church of England were provided with glebes of
forty acres each, and with houses or lodging-money; that the
magnitude of the sums annually granted to the Church of England
in New South Wales were a subject of general complaint, and had
been the origin of a public meeting and petition numerously
signed, praying for a reduction;&mdash;Governor Bourke proceeded
to observe, that "in a new country to which persons of all
religious persuasions are invited to resort, it will be
impossible to establish a dominant and endowed church without
much hostility, and great improbability of its becoming
permanent; if, on the contrary, support were given, as required,
to every one of the three grand divisions of Christians
indifferently, and the management of the temporalities of their
churches left to themselves, the public treasury might in time be
relieved of a considerable charge, and, what is of more
importance, the people would become more attached to their
respective churches, and be more willing to listen to the voice
of their respective pastors."</p>
<p>He then proceeded to sketch out the plan afterwards carried
out by the act which will presently be quoted, and recommended
that New South Wales should be created into a separate diocese,
instead of being included in that of Bengal.</p>
<p>From the same despatch it appears that the schools which had
been established under the Church and School Corporation
consisted of a male orphan school, in which 133 boys were boarded
and taught at an annual expense of £1,300, and a female orphan
school, in which 174 girls cost £1,500 annually, exclusive of
supplies from lands cultivated for the use of the schools.</p>
<p>At Paramatta there was a boarding-school for the wealthier
classes, who paid £28 each for boarders, and £10 for day-scholars
the head master, a clergyman, receiving £100 a year and the rent
of a house.</p>
<p>There were thirty-five primary schools in various parts of the
colony in which 1,248 children were taught, at an expense of
£2,756. In all these schools the Catechism of the Church of
England was part of the instruction.</p>
<p>The Church of Scotland had received a loan of £3,500 toward
the erection of the Scotch college founded by Dr. Lang; and £800
had been granted to the Roman Catholic schools.</p>
<p>The governor stated that the disproportionate assistance for
education was a subject of very general complaint; and expressed
an opinion "that schools on the Irish system, in which Christians
of all creeds are received, where approved extracts from
Scripture are read, but no religious instruction is given by the
master or mistress, such being imparted one day in the week by
ministers of different religions attending at the school to
instruct their respective flocks, would be most suitable to the
condition of the colony. It would be necessary that the
government took the lead in their institution, erecting
school-houses, appointing well-qualified teachers at liberal
salaries." In like manner infant schools should be established in
the towns. And he adds:&mdash;"<i>I may without fear of
contradiction assert, that in no part of the world is the general
education of the people a more sacred or necessary duty of the
government than in New South Wales</i>." The home Colonial Office
have never taken any pains to perform this duty.</p>
<p>In 1836 the Legislative Council passed an act, under which,
whenever £300 had been raised by private contributions toward the
building of a church or chapel, the governor, with the advice of
his Executive Council, might issue from the colonial treasury, in
aid of the subscribers, any sum not exceeding £1,000.</p>
<p>And for minister of church or chapel with 100 adult
attendants, £100 per annum. If 200 adults, £150 per annum. If 500
adults, £200 per annum. Under special circumstances the governor
and council could grant a salary of £100 per annum where the
congregation amounted to less than 100. Where there was no place
of worship, 100 might be granted from the colonial treasury if
£50 a year were raised by private contributions. Under this act
£3,000 a year was divided between the Church of England, the
Church of Scotland, and the Church of Rome, and recently the
Wesleyan Methodists shared part of the grant.</p>
<p>In his attempt to introduce an improved system of education
Sir Richard Bourke was defeated by religious jealousies, but the
despatches and Act quoted will remain monuments of his patriotism
and statesmanship.</p>
<p>In December, 1837, Sir Richard Bourke retired deeply regretted
by all the colony, except a small section of prison-flogging
magistrates and officials of the true colonial school. New South
Wales had attained the highest state of prosperity; Port Jackson
was crowded with shipping bringing free labourers and
capitalists, the banks overflowing with money, and the whole
population full of the happiest excitement.</p>
<p>The discussions of the Council, although still secret and
irresponsible, had assumed a real character, and prepared the way
for representative institutions. Restrictions placed upon the
summary conviction of prisoners by magistrates, and preparations
for the abolition of the assignment system, concurrently with the
introduction of free emigrants by funds derived from the sale of
lands, had laid the foundation of a free colony. The colonisation
of Port Phillip and South Australia by emigrants of a superior
class had done much towards directing the attention of this
country to an island which had previously been only considered a
receptacle for criminals, while the discovery of vast tracts of
fine land in the interior, with an overland communication between
the three districts, and the establishment of the squatting
system on a legal basis, greatly stimulated the increase of live
stock, the growth of wool, and the general value of colonial
exports. The Australians began to think they could walk alone
without the aid of convict-labour, and the money of the
commissariat.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>
<h4>SIR GEORGE GIPPS.<br>
<br>
1838 TO 1846.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Sir Richard Bourke</span> was succeeded by Sir
George Gipps, who was sworn in on the 2nd February, 1838; the
government, during an interregnum of ten weeks, having been
administered by the Lieutenant-governor, Colonel Snodgrass.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps, who was a captain in the Royal Engineer
Corps, owed his appointment entirely to the talent he had
displayed while acting as secretary to the commission issued for
inquiring into the grievances of rebellious Canada. During his
residence in that colony he had devised and published a plan for
educating colonists to the use of representative institutions by
"district councils" for the administration of local affairs. It
was an ingenious theory, but, as we shall hereafter show, no more
suited for the state of society in pastoral Australia than an
American river steamboat for crossing the Atlantic. Nevertheless,
the forcing this district council scheme on the unwilling
colonists was the one great idea of Sir George Gipps's colonial
career, to which he sacrificed them and himself.</p>
<p>He was a man of abilities far above the average; an eloquent
speaker, a nervous writer; with industry, energy, and a special
aptitude for the details of administrative business; but haughty
and narrow-minded; impenetrable to reasoning which did not square
with his preconceived views; filled with inordinate ideas of his
own importance as "the representative of majesty;" with a
violent, temper, which in dealing with the colonists he took
little pains to control, although his communications with the
Colonial Office displayed a pliability almost amounting to
subservience. He claimed to receive the deference due to a
viceroy, and at the same time to exercise the duties of an
English prime minister. With sharp and ready tongue he introduced
and pressed legislative measures for carrying into effect
theories most distasteful and unsuitable to his colonial
"subjects;" but opposition, or even that fair criticism and
discussion which a British premier would expect and even invite,
he treated as personal insult to his authority; almost as high
treason.</p>
<p>The period of his accession to power was in every respect most
inopportune. Backed by a Secretary of State as fiery and
obstinate as himself, with the sanction of a House of Commons
utterly ignorant of the condition of Australia, Sir George Gipps
came determined to govern on high prerogative principles, at a
time when the colony had advanced from the Algerine rule of
Phillip and Darling, to enjoy the externals of a free state. A
Legislative Council no longer secret, although not elective, had
superseded the irresponsible decrees of the governor. Courts
regularly constituted, with juries in political cases, had taken
the place of courts martial. The press was free; the liberty of
assembling to discuss political questions had been sanctioned and
exercised. A rapid, enormous immigration from the mother country
swelled the ranks of the thousands who, however descended, were
born free; and, under the guidance of the burning eloquence of a
native-born Australian, claimed to exercise those rights of
representation and self-taxation which they had forfeited by
becoming colonists.</p>
<p>The history of this long contest would fill a volume; but the
time has not yet come for writing at full length the details of
the struggles in which the liberties of Australia were born. That
must await the growth of a colonial public. It is, however, not
venturing too much to assert that if ever&mdash;which Heaven
forbid!&mdash;Australia should rise up and violently sever her
connection with the British crown, the origin of so dire a
calamity may be distinctly traced back to the period when, with
the high approval of the home authorities, and of politicians of
all colours, Sir George Gipps coerced and insulted the colonists
of Australia, forcing, with threats and blows, legislative shoes,
modelled in Downing-street, upon their unwilling feet.</p>
<p>Yet Sir George Gipps was not without noble as well as
brilliant qualities. His hands were clean. He took no share in
the jobs of the servile crew whom he used and despised. But he
was intoxicated by the greatness thrust upon him. At one stride
he passed from a subordinate military rank to the government of a
great province of wealthy and discontented men; having in his
hands authority which could make or mar a whole class or a whole
district. In a different sphere, and subdued by the even
competition of English parliamentary life, he might have done
himself honour and the state service.</p>
<p>In the temper of the governor and the governed, questions of
difference were not long in arising.</p>
<p>Under Sir Richard Bourke the Legislative Council, although
composed of salaried officials and an equal number of the
colonists nominated by the governor, had nurtured enough of the
spirit of independence to occasionally dissent from the views of
the home government or its representative. But Governor Bourke
took a colonial view of colonial subjects; he did not hesitate to
dissent from the views of a Secretary of State; he treated the
opinions of his council with deliberate consideration and
respect, even where he came to a contrary conclusion. Sir George
Gipps adopted an opposite course. Nothing could equal the
contempt with which he treated colonial opinions, except the zeal
with which he echoed and carried out the instructions issued by
the Secretary of State.</p>
<p>The following were among the more prominent political
questions which formed the subject of contention and agitation on
the part of the colonists against the governor:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p>1st. The appropriation of the revenue of the colony.</p>
<p>2nd. The extent to which the colonists were taxed for gaols,
police, &amp;c., rendered necessary by the transportation
system.</p>
<p>3rd. The manner in which the home government exercised the
patronage of the crown, passing over colonial claims, and
appointing unfit persons, at high salaries paid by the
colonists.</p>
<p>4th. The price of land, and the arbitrary manner in which it
was raised, lowered, and raised again, at the will of the
governor.</p>
<br>
<p>These four grievances were discussed in one or more distinct
cases. On each the governor took up the position of "high
prerogative" in the most offensive manner, and found his policy
approved by the home government.</p>
<p>It is very odd that, whether Whigs or Tories hold office, the
most obnoxious regulations issued, the most discreditable rights
of patronage exercised, have been defended under the plea of
asserting "the sacred rights of the crown" in the colonies. Thus
ignorant bushmen were taught, when a few acres of waste land were
not granted, as the Legislative Council prayed, to the worthy
captain who had saved a shipwrecked crew; or when a worn-out
attorney was sent out to fill a useless office at an extravagant
salary, that the ungracious refusal and disgraceful job were both
the effect of the "Queen's Prerogative."</p>
<p>Such are the modes in which Downing-street, before the days of
unrestricted political competition, used to drag the sacred name
of the sovereign through the dirt.</p>
<p>No sooner had Sir George Gipps commenced his government than
he became involved in discussions involving very important
principles, which were carried on with such feeble means of
attack as the colonists possessed, until, in 1842, an act of the
Imperial Parliament bestowed, upon New South Wales a Legislative
Council, which consisted of twenty-four elective members, and
twelve who held their seats either in an official capacity or on
the recommendation of the governor. The opening of the Colonial
Parliament took place on August 3rd, 1843, and in his "speech
from the throne," Sir George Gipps described the Council as
"composed of three elements or three different classes of
persons&mdash;the representatives of the people&mdash;the
official servants of her Majesty, and of gentlemen of
independence the unofficial nominees of the crown."</p>
<p>The nominees were soon taught that so far from being
independent, they were expected to follow the lead of the
governor without discussion or hesitation.</p>
<p>The questions which had already occupied the attention of the
colonial press and the nominee council, afforded ample employment
for the elective chamber; among the first and most important of
these was</p>
<h5>THE REVENUE.</h5>
<p>The revenue dispute commenced in 1832, when Lord Goderich,
then Secretary of State for the Colonies, directed Sir Richard
Bourke to submit annually to the Legislative Council an estimate
of the expenditure proposed to be charged on the colonial
revenues. This estimate, if passed by the Council, was to be
embodied in an ordinance, and forwarded to the home government
for his Majesty's approval. If rejected, the majority were to be
requested to furnish their estimate, and the two were to be
forwarded for "his Majesty's approval." With this illusory
control, the non-official but nominee members and the colonists
were obliged to be content. It was not of much use to object to
an estimate that had to travel round the world; and although the
non-official councillors sometimes protested against any
particularly scandalous job, their protests were received,
and&mdash;laid up with other dusty papers.</p>
<p>At the period to which we are alluding-, the administrative
powers of the governor had been so clipped, without addition to
the legislative powers of the colonies, that he could scarcely
erect a pair of stocks without first reporting to Downing-street,
with plan and estimate. No wonder that almost all the
non-official party in the colony were republicans.</p>
<p>In 1835 the expense of maintaining the police establishment
and gaols was made a colonial charge. Every non-official and two
official members of the council protested against this heavy
burden, on the ground that these expenses were largely increased
by the presence of all the transported felonry of Great Britain,
either as prisoners or freedmen. To this it was answered, that
the colony had had the benefit of their work. However, as a
<i>per contra</i>, the surplus of the fund derived from the sale
or lease of crown land was allowed to be taken to assist the
colonial revenues, after defraying the expenses of emigration.
The terms of this arrangement or contract, as the colonists
assert, are to be found in despatches with enclosures from Mr.
Spring Rice, and from Lord Glenelg, dated respectively 15th
November, 1834, and 10th July, 1835. It is not now worth while to
quote or discuss them. The truth seems to be, that, while the
returns from the land revenue were trifling, the officers of the
crown did not care to have the spending of them, having admitted
that it was "just and reasonable that the revenues should be
applied wholly and exclusively for the benefit of the colony."
But, when the land revenues rose to hundreds of thousands of
pounds annually, the question assumed a different aspect in the
eyes of a young but accomplished bureaucrat like Sir George
Gipps.</p>
<p>Sir Richard Bourke, after receiving the despatches in
question, believed that the Legislative Council had the complete
control of the land revenue. He seems to have been always anxious
to extend the legislative powers of the colonies.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps commenced what may be called, to use a slang
term of modern polities, his <i>reactionary course</i> of policy,
by repudiating the assumed contract in the extract from a
despatch, dated November, 1838, which alone affords a complete
key to the favour in which he was held at the Colonial Office,
and the detestation in which he was held in the
colony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"It is asserted in the colony that the right to appropriate
this revenue was conceded to the governor and council by a
despatch, &amp;c., and that this right was recognised by Sir
Richard Bourke . . . . . <i>Notwithstanding the strength of these
expressions</i>, I must say that I very much doubt whether, by
the Treasury letter of the 24th September, 1834, it was intended
to give up unreservedly, and for ever, the right to select the
objects on which the crown revenue (viz., from colonial land)
should be expended; and I therefore, whenever occasion required,
maintained, during the last session of the council, that the
crown has still power to do so&mdash;<i>feeling that, if wrong in
this opinion, I could easily set myself right with the council;
but, if I committed an error the other way, I might involve
myself in difficulties from which there would be no escape</i>."
And he proceeds with great ingenuity to "get up a case" to enable
the Colonial Office at home to shear the colonists of the
trifling powers recently conceded to them.</p>
<p>This was a very pretty quarrel to begin with, and the governor
lost no opportunity of improving it.</p>
<p>Whether the contract existed or not, it is quite clear that
the powers claimed and exercised by the governor and the colonial
secretary, in the much-abused name of the sovereign, amounted to
revolting despotism under a caricature of free discussion. The
colonists were expected to defray the cost of their own
government, with all the addition of police and gaol expenses
incident to a periodical inoculation of British-grown felonry,
while, with the sham of a Legislative Council and financial
discussions, all sources of revenue, except additional taxation,
were removed from their control. As to the crown or waste
lands&mdash;the price, the management&mdash;the expenditure of
the funds arising from them in emigration&mdash;were settled by
English commissioners; the surplus was appropriated by the crown.
The custom-house tariff and the rules for levying it were
settled, and the officers appointed, by the English custom-house.
As to the funds raised by local taxation, the Colonial Secretary,
in the name of the crown, created offices, fixed fines, salaries,
and appointed officers, without the slightest regard, to the
wants or wishes of the colonists.</p>
<p>The grievance with respect to the appropriation of the land
revenues became more unbearable inconsequence of the orders and
acts of the home government in respect to the land question,
which were in direct opposition to the feelings and interests of
the colonists.</p>
<p>It was with the representative members of the Legislative
Council, while the colony was in a state of insolvency, that
Governor Gipps's battles commenced, and were carried on with an
acerbity on both sides which did not breed a rebellion, because
the materials in the shape of coercive powers had not been
conceded to the governor. The new council lost no time in
investigating the grievances of the colony, and soon collected a
most formidable list, although the most oppressed class of all,
the small settlers, were entirely unrepresented.</p>
<p>The revenues, the price of crown lands, the assessments on the
pastoral proprietors, the abuses in the exercise of crown
patronage, successively attracted the attention of the
opposition, vigorously led by William Wentworth, a gentleman of
brilliant talents and great oratorical powers, whose influence
was to a certain extent unfortunately impaired by a violent
temper and want of tact, the result of a provincial education
among men vastly his inferiors in intellect, and long exclusion
from a legitimate exercise of his powers.</p>
<p>Without the evidence printed by these Legislative Councils of
New South Wales, it would be impossible to credit that a
government at home, professed to be formed on "reform" and
"retrenchment," could have perpetrated and maintained powers so
oppressive and jobs so corrupt. But jobbery and despotism seem
incident to all corporate bodies which have the control of
sea-divided territories. It was impossible to imagine anything
worse than the administration of the Colonial Office, until the
New Zealand Company, composed of colonial reformers, showed in
perfection what a colonising Robert Macaire could do with a large
capital, a directorate of credulous capitalists, and an array of
still more credulous colonists.</p>
<p>The following cases, gathered from the reports of the
committees of the Legislative Council appointed to inquire into
certain gross cases of embezzlement and mismanagement, afford
examples of the "patronage grievance," of the sort of persons
selected for colonial office, the nature of the powers they
assumed On the strength of holding a home instead of a colonial
appointment, and the manner in which they performed their
duties.</p>
<h5>THE REGISTRAR.</h5>
<p>In 1841 the Registrar of the Supreme Court became a defaulter;
in the following year he took the benefit of the Insolvent Act,
and eventually paid a dividend of sixpence in the pound. The
committee which investigated his case, with the view of obtaining
redress from the home government for the sufferers by the
malversation of their appointed, reported, that the first
registrar, Colonel Mills, was a decayed gentleman, with no
knowledge of business, and who, therefore, left what there was to
be done to other officers. On his death the governor and council
recommended that the office, in the then state of the colony not
needed, should be abolished; but, before receiving or without
attending to this recommendation, the defaulter in question, Mr.
M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, was appointed. His antecedents were not
more encouraging than those of Colonel Mills. In 1811 he had
executed a deed of assignment of all his property for the benefit
of his creditors; and in 1823, after returning from an eight
years' residence on the Continent, had taken the benefit of the
Insolvent Act; in 1828 had been appointed Chief Justice of Nova
Scotia, and had been permitted to exchange the appointment for
that of Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, with
the duty of collecting the effects of intestates, and, according
to his own account, the privilege of investing the money for his
own benefit pending its distribution.</p>
<p>On arrival at the colony Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; took up a
high position. That part of his duty which related to registering
deeds of grants of crown land he entirely neglected and suffered
to fall into an arrear, which eventually involved great numbers
of the humbler class in litigation and ruin. But the collection
of the estates of intestates he entered on as zealously as any
wrecker on the spoils of storms. The presence of near relatives
was no protection for the moneys of the deceased: in defiance of
son, brother, or father, the registrar grasped all the estate,
invested it in his own name for his own benefit, and from 1828 to
1838 kept neither day-book, cash-book, nor ledger, but one
account at his banker's, rendered no statement for audit to any
one, and paid over what balance, if any, to the next of kin of
intestates when and how he pleased.</p>
<p>In 1838 the judges made rules of court requiring the registrar
to pass his accounts and pay the balance into the savings' bank.
The great man remonstrated against these rules in a most
indignant tone, "as threatening to take from him a source of
legitimate income, on the faith of which he immigrated to the
colony," and intimated that, "unless he was permitted to retain
and make use of the money himself, he would use no exertions to
obtain it."</p>
<p>At this audit he reported himself to be in possession of
£1,980 17s 0½d., but the court, after argument, found £3,085 18s.
2d. due, compelled him to pay it into court, and, in spite of
violent resistance, in which he was supported by one of the
official legal advisers of the governor, had a set of rules of
court sanctioned by the governor in council, under which the
registrar was bound to account regularly and pay in the proceeds
of every intestate estate within a certain fixed time (three
months from the period of the intestacy); the injured registrar
all the time protesting that "the judges were reflecting on his
honour by calling for accounts, and depriving him of the
legitimate profits to be derived from the employment of other
men's money, which had induced him to settle in the colony." The
judges being firm, and supported by the council, the registrar
then resorted to fraud, and in the course of two years became
possessed of £9,000. When no longer able to conceal his
appropriations, he announced his insolvency in a <i>debonnair</i>
yet dignified manner&mdash;a condescending, much-injured
style&mdash;which could only come from a colonial official. The
sufferers by this embezzlement petitioned for compensation from
the home government. The correspondence with the appropriator is
extremely rich and racy. Throughout he appears to consider
himself deeply injured. The home government rejected the prayers
of the petitioners.</p>
<h5>THE PROTHONOTARY.</h5>
<p>The next case is illustrative of the confidence with which
colonial secretaries set aside colonial recommendations; the
avidity with which they embrace opportunities of patronage; the
indifference with which they increase salaries; and the admirable
skill with which certain governors imbibe the principles of the
chiefs.</p>
<p>The judge, Chief Justice Dowling, finding it needful to
recommend that certain offices included in the charter of justice
should be filled up, and especially that of prothonotary, at a
salary of £800 per annum, for which he recommends one Mr. John
Grover, late chief clerk, "who, from his long services,
indefatigable industry, and experience, is admirably qualified
for the office," Governor Gipps, the late captain of engineers,
enters into a correspondence, as was his custom, with the judges,
in which he instructs them how to manage the business of their
courts, and save £50 a year. The judges demur, and show the
governor that he knows nothing about the matter.</p>
<p>The question is referred to the Colonial Secretary, Lord
Stanley, who settles the question in King Stork fashion, without
a moment's loss of time. He does not appoint the gentleman
recommended by the judges. In other respects he follows out their
recommendations, but sends out two new officers, one at £1,000 a
year, and the other at 850; and creating a third appointment, at
£650, to be filled up by the governor; thus at a blow saddling
the colony with-increased salaries to the extent of £400 a year,
on the ground that in England competent persons could not be
induced to accept these offices for less. An early act of one of
these gentlemen was to set the local legislature at defiance on a
matter of salary; the other was a worn-out, ruined attorney.</p>
<p>We have only to imagine, in order to understand colonial
feeling on these subjects, the case of the town council of
Liverpool applying to the Home Office for a stipendiary
magistrate, stating their willingness to pay a salary of £800,
and suggesting a particularly well-qualified gentleman to fill
it, and their having a total stranger thrust upon them, with
orders to pay him 200 more than they had offered. It seems the
rulo with all officials appointed from England to treat with the
greatest contempt the colonists who pay them.</p>
<h5>THE LUNATIC ASYLUM.</h5>
<p>An inquiry into the management of the Colonial Lunatic Asylum
brought out facts equally characteristic of the independence and
irresponsibility of all officials, up to the time that the
elected members of the Legislative Council began to exercise
their privilege of inquiry. In 1846, a select committee of the
Legislative Council investigated the condition of Tarban Creek,
the only lunatic asylum in New South Wales. In the course of this
inquiry it appeared that the head keeper and his wife, the
matron, <i>in consequence of having received their appointment
direct from the Secretary of State</i>, habitually resisted all
attempts to control, or even investigate the performance of their
duties, by the visiting magistrates or colonially-appointed
physician. Lunatics are sufficiently neglected and abused even to
this hour in England, but it is only in a colony that a sort of
turnkey for lunatics would presume to set the dignity of his
office against both magistrates and medical men.</p>
<p>The visiting magistrate "had occasion to refer to the governor
for definite instructions in consequence of the superintendent
considering that he was interfering." He states, "My authority is
repudiated by Mr. Digby; he says I have no right to interfere.
Although he gives me every information in his power, he does so
in courtesy, protesting against my right to interfere."</p>
<p>The committee found "no books or registers such as ought to be
kept in a public establishment; no record of cases; no written
statement of the appearance of any patient at the time of his
admission, or of the progress of the disease, or of the
treatment, medical and moral." They report that&mdash;</p>
<p>"The medical officer is not in his proper position." According
to evidence, "he gets all his information from me [the keeper] as
to the particulars of the case and form of insanity." The keeper
stated, that in going round with the doctor, if he suggests any
alteration in their moral treatment, and it appears to him [the
keeper] an improvement, he acts upon it; but if he does riot
approve of it he does not yield to him. "For instance, he might
recommend that restraint should be taken off a patient, but if,
from a better knowledge of the party, he might not deem it
advisable, he should refuse to do so."</p>
<p>We quote this passage because it so perfectly illustrates the
manner in which colonists and colonial interests are treated.</p>
<p>It is quite evident that the merits of this worthy officer of
the order of the strait-jacket were not duly acknowledged. He
ought to have been a colonial governor or a colonial secretary.
Colonists are treated like the Tarban Creek lunatics: they do not
know what is good for them neither do their representatives. The
governor is the man; he is responsible to no one; and although
the Legislative Council, liko the doctor, may recommend removing
restraint, he knows better. We have not space to go into the jail
cases, where the governor provided himself with coachman,
footman, gardener, and a crew of boatmen, out of the criminals
sentenced to imprisonment for colonial offences, and the convicts
of Hyde Park Barracks were left under charge of a convict
turnkey, who let them out to rob at so much a night, with pistols
hired at ten shillings for each case.</p>
<p>With these examples we leave the subject of official
responsibility, and return to the two great questions which
agitated the colony during the whole administration of Sir George
Gipps, and which still continue to excite the interest and
apprehension of all who look ahead&mdash;"The Land," and
"Emigration."</p>
<h5>THE LAND QUESTION.</h5>
<p>The question of the terms on which the waste lands of the
colony were to be sold, and, until sold, occupied by flock-owners
and stock-owners, formed the subject of the most bitter contest
between Governor Gipps and the colonists. To the colonists the
question was one of existence; it involved not only the liberties
so dear to every English-speaking race, but the means of
existence.</p>
<p>Just before the departure of Sir Richard Bourke, the pastoral
proprietors of New South Wales, as well as all the merchants,
capitalists, and every one else possessed of money or credit,
were seized with a land mania, which can be compared to nothing
less than the share and stock-jobbing manias which, from the
period of the Mississippi scheme down to the last rage for
railway scrip, have, from time to time, carried bankruptcy, ruin,
and roguery through the length and breadth of the infatuated
nation.</p>
<p>The disease arose in South Australia in the manner which will
be found described in the chapter devoted to the foundation of
that colony, and it received a great stimulus from the foundation
of Port Phillip, where a considerable extent of picturesque, and
more than ordinarily fertile land, easy of access from the port,
became the object of competition among English colonists with
more money than colonial experience.</p>
<p>Mr. Gibbon Wakefield's theories seemed to receive, in one
important respect, confirmation from the large sums paid into the
colonial treasuries by colonists bidding one against another for
land at government auctions. These large funds were placed in the
colonial banks. The banks, in order to employ the government
deposits, gave unusual accommodation to their customers, until,
moving in a circle of fallacies, the whole colony dreamed of
growing rich by selling to each other land which produced
nothing.</p>
<p>The series of Secretaries of State for the Colonies, Lords
Aberdeen, Glenelg, Normanby, and John Russell, who succeeded each
other in rapid succession up to 1842, and Lord Stanley, who held
office until 1845, seem all to have taken the promised results of
the Wakefield theory for granted&mdash;assumed that it was the
duty of the government to obtain the highest price for crown
lands&mdash;that a high price of land would keep down wages, and
check dispersion; and to this notion their successor, Lord Grey,
adhered, in face of an unbroken line of colonial evidence of the
most practical character.</p>
<p>Thus, in August, 1838, Lord Glenelg instructed Sir George
Gipps to substitute 12s. for 5s. an acre as the upset price of
ordinary land, adding, "If you should observe that the extension
of the population should still proceed with a rapidity beyond
what is desirable, and that the want of labour still continues to
be seriously felt, you will take measures for checking the sale
of land even at 12s."</p>
<p>It would be an insult to the powerful understanding of Sir
George Gipps to doubt that he was as well aware of the fallacy of
this idea as his predecessor, but he came out with the fixed
principle of earning the approbation of his official chiefs by
zealously and actively carrying out their desires and orders. As
he once answered a colonial remonstrant, "I was sent here to
carry out the Wakefield system of land sales, and whether it
suits the colony or not, it must be done."</p>
<p>Animated by this spirit he adopted two measures which soon
transferred the greater part of the ready money of the colonists,
new and old, into the colonial treasury. He limited the quantity
of land offered for sale so as to raise the competition between
new arrivals to the highest pitch, and he successively raised the
upset price to the last sum given by the last land-lunatic under
the excitement of an auction.</p>
<p>Thus, at a land auction on the 10th June, 1840, at Port
Phillip, the price was run up by emulation and competition to
such a height, that shipmates of Richard Howitt, with a capital
among them of £20,000, only ventured to invest £600. Land was
sold at £30 and £40 acre, which, for years afterwards, remained
in a state of nature.</p>
<p>In the New South Wales district Sir George Gipps offered and
sold land at Illawarra at 12s. and £1 an acre; when raised to £10
an acre it remained unsold; it was then reduced to £1, and, being
worthless refuse, still remained unsold. In a second and third
district, the upset price was raised to £10 in one instance, and
£100 in another, and afterwards reduced to £2 an acre. And all
this was done repeatedly against the advice of the official
surveyors, on the principle that it was the duty of the governor
to wring the uttermost farthing from the settler.</p>
<p>The land mania was followed by a crash of universal
insolvency. Land became unsaleable; live stock fell to nominal
prices; and the importers of British and foreign luxuries had
nothing better to offer their creditors than the dishonoured
bills of their customers.</p>
<p>It was in 1841, in the commencement of this crisis of
insolvency, that the British Parliament, in utter ignorance of
colonial affairs, under the influence of a band of stock-jobbing
theorists, attempted to prop up the insolvent colony of South
Australia by an act which fixed the minimum price of land in
Australia at £1 an acre.</p>
<p>In 1843, when the elective Legislative Council commenced its
labours, the dissatisfaction of the colonists with the fixed
minimum price of £1 an acre had become universal.</p>
<p>The wealthy parties who had expected their free grants, and
their purchases at five shillings an acre, to be augmented in
value by the increased price, were disappointed&mdash;the
speculators who, following the example of the South Australians,
had purchased large estates in the hope of realising large
profits, by laying out paper towns and villages, were either
insolvent or encumbered with tracts of useless waste land,
unsaleable and unprofitable&mdash;the small settlers were deeply
discontented with the impediments thrown in the way of purchasing
small farms in good agricultural districts&mdash;while the great
pastoral proprietors, or squatters, who were many of them also
landowners in the settled districts, were
<i>worried</i>&mdash;(no other word will express the policy of
Sir George Gipps)&mdash;by taxes, regulations, and restrictions
imposed, repealed, and reimposed in a most arbitrary manner, with
a view of compelling the purchase of their occupations at the
ruinous price of £1 an acre.</p>
<p>Live stock became absolutely valueless; cattle were allowed to
rove wild, unbranded on the hills; and sheep which had cost 30s.
a piece were unsaleable at 1s. 6d., until it occurred to an
ingenious gentleman to boil them down for tallow, by which the
minimum price was raised to 3s. Land sales had ceased; the fund,
which had previously imported labouring emigrants to take the
place of convicts, was exhausted. The pastoral interest, whose
fortunes had already been seriously injured by the depreciation
of their stock, determined to resist the governor in his attempt
to regulate their taxation, and to virtually confiscate their
property on the fiat of himself and his irresponsible
representatives, the Crown Commissioners.</p>
<p>In the same year Lord Stanley's despatch, accompanying the act
of Parliament which gave legislative fixity to the land system,
arrived in the colony, and damped the expectations of those who
had hoped that the failure of the £1 an acre panacea for
promoting concentration, regulating wages, and encouraging
cultivation, would induce the home government to consult a little
more the wishes and interests of actual colonists.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the first of six committees of the
Legislative Council which have examined and reported on this
question&mdash;viz., two committees in 1843, one in 1844, one in
1845, and two in 1847&mdash;was appointed, held its sittings,
examined witnesses, and made its report.</p>
<p>The committee of 1843 on "the crown land sales" examined,
amongst others, the surveyor-general, Sir Thomas Mitchell, one of
the M'Arthurs, and several landed and pastoral proprietors. They
reported that "the act of Parliament under their consideration
cannot but be injurious in its operation&mdash;<i>that it is
calculated to prevent emigration</i> (of small capitalists), to
withdraw capital, and <i>to prevent the permanent occupancy of
the soil</i>."</p>
<p>In the same year the select committee on immigration also
reported by its chairman, Dr. Nicholson (since elected speaker of
the Council, and knighted), "that the measure of her Majesty's
government for raising the upset price of land from 5s. to 12s.,
and subsequently to 20s. an acre, had completely annihilated the
land fund, which, in six years previous to the change, had
produced one million sterling;" and they recommended, in a series
of resolutions, one for "<i>rescinding the present land
regulations and effecting a return of the old system of sales ly
auction, at an upset rate not exceeding 5s. an acre</i> for
pastoral land."</p>
<p>In 1844 a "select committee on grievances connected with land
in the colony" examined twenty-six witnesses, and received
answers to a printed circular of questions from one hundred and
twenty-two justices of the peace. The attention of the committee
was directed, among other subjects, to the minimum price of land,
and to the attempts to harass the squatter, not being a purchaser
of land, by rendering his tenure of crown lands as uncertain and
onerous as possible.</p>
<p>All the witnesses who were asked the question (except Mr. Deas
Thompson, the Colonial Secretary, who declined, on the ground of
his official character, to give an answer), and all the replies
to the circulars, except three, expressed decided opinions
against the measure which raised the minimum price of crown land
from 5s. to £1; all justly taking it for granted that at £1 an
acre the purchase of pastoral lands was impossible, claimed
fixity of tenure by lease, and right of pre-emption for the
squatter. The latter was the grand point with the squatters; that
gained, their interest in the land question, except in promoting
sales to create an emigration fund, ceased.</p>
<p>The opinions of the three dissentients from the report of the
committee exhibit very exactly the feelings of the small class,
resident chiefly in Port Phillip and South Australia, who
advocate the high price of land.</p>
<p>These three gentlemen are John Leslie Foster, of Leslie Park,
Melbourne&mdash;Peter M'Arthur, of Arthurton,
Melbourne&mdash;John Moore Airey, of Geelong.</p>
<p><i>Mr. Foster</i> says, very candidly, "I look on the price of
one pound as not too much for agricultural land, and as a
prohibition on the purchase of mere pastoral land. <i>Being both
a landowner and a settler</i>, I would in both characters regret
to see any reduction in the price, as <i>it would not only reduce
the value of my</i> (purchased) <i>land</i>, but, by <i>rendering
it easier for others to purchase my (rented) runs</i>, would
diminish the permanent interest I now hold in them." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Foster has recently been appointed
Colonial Secretary of Victoria.]</p>
<p><i>Mr. Moore</i> thought "the country destined, from its
physical character, to become an aristocratic one;" that "the
class of emigrants really beneficial to the country, English
country gentlemen with some property, but with large families and
limited means, would not be deterred by £1 an acre; that a class
of small but independent farmers will never be generally adapted
to the country; that it will eventually fall into the hands of a
landed aristocracy, who, possessing the frontages to water
convenient to the residence of tenants, will possess capital
sufficient to guard them against the vicissitudes of the seasons,
as well as means to cultivate the interior to advantage."</p>
<p><i>Mr. Peter M'Arthur</i> (no relation to "the M'Arthur," of
Camden) "arrived in the colony in 1834, specially introduced to
the favour and protection of the governor by the Secretary of
State." He recommends that "the governor shall have the power to
grant twelve thousand eight hundred acres to respectable parties
of station and education, and capital, and of habits worthy of
being imitated by the humbler class;" one thousand acres to be
purchased at £1 an acre, payable by instalments in ten years; the
remaining eleven thousand eight hundred to be held on a perpetual
quit rent of £12 per annum.</p>
<p>These three gentlemen evidently considered that imperial and
colonial interests were bound up in the encouragement of their
class, in the protection of their interests, and the keeping down
of aspiring yeomanry.</p>
<p>The report of the committee on crown land grievances was the
foundation of a fierce agitation on the part of the pastoral
interests for the suppression of the obnoxious regulations as to
the pastoral occupations, and for fixity of tenure. In this
agitation, which was also directed against the £1 acre minimum,
the whole colony joined. Public meetings were held in every part
of New South Wales; petitions and memorials addressed to the home
government were signed, sent to England, and placed in the hands
of political men of influence; and influential organs of the
English press were enlisted in defence of the great pastoral
interest.</p>
<p>In the same year the whole Council adopted resolutions
condemning the high price of land in the terms suggested by the
committee.</p>
<p>In 1845 a fourth select committee reported against the £1 an
acre Act, supporting their opinions with a great body of facts
and statistics, and concluded by observing, that "the practical
evils resulting from the augmentation of the upset price of land
had already been fully developed in the Report on Immigration and
the Report on Waste Lands in 1843, and in the Land Grievance
Report of 1844, and in the opinions of your honourable Council,
distinctly pronounced on the same subject, in the resolutions of
the whole Council of the 17th September, 1844."</p>
<p>To complete the history of the land question we will add, that
in 1847, under the administration of Sir George Gipps's
successor, a select committee on immigration, of which Mr. Cowper
was chairman, reported "the <i>disastrous results and impolicy of
the high upset price;</i>" and also that a select committee,
presided over by Mr. Robert Lowe (now so well known in England),
made an elaborate report against the high upset price of land, to
which we shall have occasion to allude more minutely in
describing the compromise effected between the government and the
squatters under the government of Sir Charles Fitzroy.</p>
<p>But Governor Gipps stood firm; determined to make war on the
squatters, determined to maintain the obnoxious £1 an acre, and
to carry out the spirit of the act which imposed it, by throwing,
as he was instructed, all possible obstacles in the way of men of
small capital investing their savings in land; and he was
supported by the British Colonial Office.</p>
<p>For while the governor was courageously attacking the most
wealthy and powerful body in the colony, he took no pains to
foster that class of yeomanry which were the object of Sir
Richard Bourke's peculiar care. He divided the land into large
lots; discouraged small holdings, whether of land or stock; and
treated emigrants as merchandise or live stock consigned for the
benefit of the purchasers of land.</p>
<p>It certainly was most unfortunate for the colony that the
initiation of a representative government, the substitution of
free emigrant for prisoner labour, and the attempt to establish
local self-government, should have fallen under the direction of
one who, with great talents, was obstinately determined not to
learn anything from experience, and not to permit any measure of
reform he did not originate. His want of pliability was
strikingly displayed in the conduct of emigration.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>
<h4>EMIGRATION.</h4>
<p><span class="a">When</span> grants of land ceased altogether,
and were superseded by sales, the character of emigration to
Australia, and even the motives which directed it, were
materially changed. To Australia, previous to 1831, the same
class of persons proceeded in small numbers, who by thousands
have resorted, during the last ten years, to Canada, and, above
all, to the western states of America families with capital
varying from fifty to five hundred pounds, intent on living on
land of their own.</p>
<p>The distance, and the then little known capabilities, of
Australia, would, twenty years ago, have made it, under any
circumstances, a difficult task to direct towards its shores a
similar stream of colonists; but the new system of so raising the
price and the quantity of land sold, so as to discourage the
purchases of all but the wealthy, and of devoting the proceeds to
the importation of able-bodied labourers for their use, altered
the whole character of the free colonisation. The new system was
not without merits as a temporary expedient for supplying, as
rapidly as possible, the demand for shepherd servants, occasioned
by the abolition of the assignment system, peopling the shores of
the newly-settled districts in Port Phillip and South Australia.
But as a permanent measure the moral and social defects were, and
are, very serious.</p>
<p>By the emigration land fund system the parent state is
relieved of a certain amount of (surplus?) labour without
expense, and the colonies are supplied with the same, in
proportion to the amount received for the purchase or rent of
land. According to the principles of the system, those who are
rich enough to purchase or rent land (the minimum of rent being
4,000 sheep) have a right to dictate what manner of labour shall
be supplied for the money. The sort of labourers who suit the
employers of labour are not often those who would contribute most
to the intelligence and education of a colony. For a long series
of years the Australian flockowners' <i>beau-ideal</i> of an
emigrant was an able-bodied single man from an agricultural
county humble, ignorant, and strong.</p>
<p>The South Australian commissioners exhibited one
halfpennyworth of sense, amid gallons of nonsense and jobbery, by
introducing the system of <i>pairs</i> of both sexes. This was
the one good feature in their system.</p>
<p>The Australian squatters, and all persons more or less in
communication with, and able to influence, the home government,
like our own agricultural and the American manufacturing
interest, held two very strong opinions&mdash;first, that their
pursuit was the only calling of any consequence to the State;
and, secondly, that it could not be protected too much. They
always wanted labour, and it could not be too cheap.</p>
<p>We find them constantly desiring to bring down wages to a
level which, if reached, would have very soon put a stop to all
emigration, for it would have been lower than in England, and
that was not worth crossing the sea to earn. We find them
constantly desiring to dictate what class of labourers they would
have, and that class specially in reference to sheep. We find
them depreciating, not untruthfully perhaps, but untruly, the
character of the Australian soil and of the Australian
agricultural settlers. To them the Alpha and Omega of the
Australian colonies&mdash;was breed sheep, to grow wool and
tallow.</p>
<p>Even when claiming a return to a low price of land, many
desired to keep up the size of lots, so as to exclude small
farmers from freehold.</p>
<p>The result we now see. For fifteen years the agents of the
colony and the emigration commissioners have been recruiting and
sending out emigrant recruits. Their most successful operations
have been conducted in times of distress in the home labour
market. The fund in the early period of the system down to 1839,
when all the colonists were madly engaged in nodding at the
government continental land sales, was sufficient to pay the
passages out of fifty thousand emigrants. For a time the market
was apparently glutted, but the increase of stock, and the
judicious measures introduced by Caroline Chisholm, soon absorbed
them. Soon arose an increased demand for labour. The land fund
was dried up; sales at £1 an acre were few and far between,
except in the copper-mining colony of South Australia; but by
degrees he rents from pastoral occupations of crown lands became
so large that security was found for an emigration debt, to which
was added, from time to time, the produce of town and suburban
lots, and, as the population increased, occasionally of choice
rural land. But it occurred more than once that when labour was
needed in the colony there were no funds, and, when funds were
forwarded to England, that the commissioners found a difficulty
in collecting suitable emigrants.</p>
<p>Indeed, until the discovery of the gold-fields, very few,
except the utterly destitute among the labouring classes, turned
their attention to Australia.</p>
<p>Committees on emigration were appointed by the Legislative
Council in 1839, when the bounty system was in operation, in
1842, in 1843, and in 1845; and in 1843 and 1844 committees on
the "distressed labourers" of Sydney collected important evidence
bearing on the same subject. It is worthy of remark that in
these, as in committees appointed by the British Parliament,
witnesses have seldom been called from among the respectable
mechanics and labourers who are most interested in emigration,
and best acquainted with the emigrating classes.</p>
<p>The committee of 1839 reported that emigrants were being
introduced at the rate of 12,500 souls a year, at a cost of about
£17 per adult, expressed a decided preference for bounty over
government emigrants, and recommended a loan to be raised on the
security of the land fund, and devoted to emigration a bounty at
19 a head for adults only, <i>excluding children</i>, and <i>very
humbly</i> prayed that the crown would devote the land fund,
which they calculated at not less than £150,000 a year, to
emigration purposes. It is curious to remark that the committee
object to the introduction of emigrants over forty years of age.
The government emigration agent had invited emigrants of fifty
years of age. The gold discoveries have recently enlightened the
pastoral interests to the value of parents of even sixty years of
age.</p>
<p>In 1842 the committee repeat their preference for the bounty
system, announcing that in the preceding twelve months 23,000
emigrants had been introduced, and the cessation of emigration,
in consequence of the falling off of the land fund, to an extent
unexpected by the home government. They gently hint at the
propriety of a reduction of the price of land to five shillings
an acre. The tone of the document is that of a respectable
nominee council.</p>
<p>The committee of 1843 represented the wealthy squatting class,
and the majority took an entirely colonial and pastoral view of
the labour question. They wanted shepherds as quickly and as
cheaply as possible, and nothing else. No seven-shilling a week
farmer&mdash;no cottage-destroying landlord&mdash;no
unlimited-time-of-labour manufacturer&mdash;no woman-employing
coal-worker, could have taken a narrower view of the
question.</p>
<p>There is unfortunately in all of us a germ of selfishness
which, when unchecked by public opinion or political opposition,
is apt to grow into injustice and tyranny. In private life the
squatters were excellent, generous, hospitable men; but one large
proportion consisted of old colonists accustomed to convict
servants, who cost nothing beyond their board and lodging, and
another of young bachelors of capital, who arrived in the colony
to make a fortune, intent on returning to the old country as soon
as it was made. The one despised, and the other were indifferent
to the opinions of the working classes. Both dreamed of
naturalising in Australia the miserable wages of the southern
counties of England and the Highland counties of Scotland.</p>
<p>To resist the aggressions of Sir George G-ipps on the pastoral
interest the squatters had formed themselves into a protective
association, and by an easy process the association, founded to
resist unjust confiscation and taxation, branched off into a
combination for permanently lowering the wages of the colony. At
the head of this association was the late Mr. Benjamin Boyd. Mr.
Boyd arrived with the express purpose of making investments at
the time (1841) that the colony was in a general state of
insolvency, or, as he expressed it, "in a jam." A yacht of the
Royal Squadron, an apparently unlimited capital, an imposing
personal appearance, fluent oratory, aristocratic connexions, and
a fair share of commercial acuteness, acquired on the Stock
Exchange, at once and deservedly placed him at the head of the
squatocracy. His aim was the possession of a million sheep. He
was the chief of the hundred thousand sheepmen, with whom he
combined to obtain fixity of tenure for their sheep pastures, to
put down small settlers, and to reduce wages.</p>
<p>At the period we are describing, from 1841 to 1844, the
colonial labour market presented the most curious contradictions.
The bounty agents were pouring in a crowd of most unsuitable
persons, who, once landed, were soon left to shift for
themselves. Among the merchants of the town of Sydney distress
prevailed in consequence of the cessation of building and other
works, the wages of mechanics were depressed to a rate before
unknown, and newly-arrived immigrants were astonished at the low
rate of pay for town labour, so different to the flaming
representations of the crimps by whom they had been collected.
But in the country districts, and especially in the bush, where
sheep and cattle were breeding, while their proprietors were
going through the insolvent process, wages were maintained; and
the anomaly was presented of large bodies of men being employed
at the expense of government, at high wages, at public works, on
a sham labour test, while flocks were wanting shepherds in the
interior. Several causes supported this anomaly: 1st, There was
no government machinery for distributing newly-arrived emigrants;
2ndly, The preference of the squatters for single men left
families on the hands of the government; 3rdly, The Squatters'
Club were not sorry to see the government embarrassed by the
presence of a large body of unemployed labourers in Sydney;
4thly, The dishonest conduct of certain masters in withholding or
unfairly deducting wages promised had given the bush a bad name;
5thly, Many of the emigrants were of a class who, having left
parish aid behind, liked to keep close to government rations and
wages. All were engaged, as far as their short-sighted views
would permit, in killing the golden goose of colonisation.</p>
<p>Mr. Boyd's evidence before the immigration committee of 1843
affords, when read with the notes we can supply, a fair specimen
of the haughty, gentlemanly, selfish class he represented. He had
then been eighteen months in the colony, and was employing two
hundred shepherds and stockmen, besides artificers. He was
building a town and port at Twofold Bay; had two steam-boats, and
a schooner yacht, the Wanderer. He had devised a wild scheme of
saving labour, by putting three thousand sheep, instead of eight
hundred, under the charge of one shepherd, on horseback.</p>
<p>Mr. Boyd despaired of the prosperity of the colony "unless the
wages of a shepherd could be brought to £10 a year, or about 3s.
10d. a week, with meat and flour, without tea and sugar." The two
last had been previously universally allowed; but he expressed
his intention of doing away with them, "being of very
questionable utility and necessity, although such is the waste
and extravagance here that 8 lbs of tea and 90 lbs. of sugar are
consumed per head." He states, further, that he "had no
difficulty in engaging shepherds at £10 with these rations, but
much difficulty in getting men engaged at these low wages
forwarded to stations, as they were generally picked up on the
road." "Any money advanced towards travelling expenses was
usually spent in public-houses;" and it is his decided opinion
that "more than 10 a year only does harm to shepherds, by sending
them to public-houses."</p>
<p>Mr. Boyd also mentioned how he had kindly given a free passage
to Twofold Bay, distant 600 miles from Sydney, to one hundred
labourers out of employ. He did not mention that, on their
arriving there, those who refused to accept £10 wages were
refused a passage back for less than £5; and that, while a few
strong men walked back over the mountains, those who remained
created such a feeling in the country that Mr. Boyd could not
venture to visit his stations until the time of the year when the
police magistrate, with a guard of policemen, took his annual
round.</p>
<p>Fortunately all squatters were not like the Boyd clan, and the
productiveness of the land defeated the combination. Had it been
otherwise, a very few years would have produced a servile war of
men against masters. From the Boyd clan proceeded stories founded
on fact, and dressed to suit a purpose, about allotments of land
sold for quarts of rum, champagne drunk in buckets by shearers
and shepherds, who insisted on having pickles with their
[measley?] pork.</p>
<p>Another order of men, chiefly permanent colonists, residing on
their own property, were represented by Mr. Charles Campbell as
employing from fifty to sixty shepherds and watchmen. "He had
been obliged by the pressure of the times, to reduce his old
servants to £18 for shepherds and £16 for watchmen, and had not
found them so reluctant to accept the reduction as he expected.
He would hardly like to see wages lower." He thought a great
oversight had been committed by settlers in neglecting to form
villages on their estates. He says, "Many of those who now
complain of want of employment in Sidney might have been
comfortably settled up the country in small villages, containing
from ten to twelve men, heads of families, in various callings.
In the present state of things we employ, at sheepshearing and
reaping, men who wander through the country, from one place to
another, in quest of occasional employment. Many of these are
handy, clever fellows, but unmarried, and of irregular and
dissolute habits. All these men earn is frequently spent in the
first public-houses they come to after leaving the station where
they have been employed. If, instead of employing men of this
class, the flockmasters and landowners had invited married
emigrants to settle in small villages, by allowing them land at a
low rent, and not attempting to monopolise their labour,
permitting them to choose their own employer in the
neighbourhood, we should have our reaping, mowing, and shearing
done at a cheaper rate; and the emigrants, by means of the money
made during the busy season, added to their earnings, would
maintain their families well, and their children, from not being
scattered, might have opportunities of learning to read and
write, and of receiving religious instruction. Many would in a
few years become small farmers&mdash;first as tenants, then as
landholders, and in either capacity would increase the demand for
labour."</p>
<p>This was sound sense in Charles Campbell, as contrasted with
the selfishness of Benjamin Boyd; but although Mr. Campbell's
views were afterwards enforced and illustrated with a large
collection of facts gathered by the one great colonial reformer
produced by Australia, yet 1851 found the pastoral interests as
ill provided with permanent labour as 1843. The selfish maxims of
Mr. Boyd's Bent Street Club prevailed after the ruin and death of
the founder. The successful efforts to retain good land as sheep
walks only,&mdash;to encourage the growth of sheep and discourage
the rearing of children, found Australia, when the golden
revolution broke out, largely dependent on wandering shepherds,
bound by no ties, either moral or local, social or domestic, to
the district or the land of which they had no share. Even at this
hour short-sighted successors to the Boyd policy are attempting
to forge legal bonds to retain the unwilling services of cheap
shepherds, hired in Europe&mdash;anything rather than give up a
share in the land monopoly, although it is melting from their
grasp.</p>
<p>But while the governor, backed by the Colonial Office, was
deep in the contest which killed him and deceived
thousands&mdash;while the bounty crimps were pouring in their
miscellaneous collections to work or saunter, or, if women, walk
the streets&mdash;while the squatters, losing sight of the just
half of their claim, were factiously obstructing all government,
and ready to ruin the bodies and souls of shepherds to save
wool&mdash;an individual appeared, unencumbered with colonising
theories, undebased by any mercenary objects, laborious in
collecting facts, diffident in expressing new opinions, prepared
to learn, willing to teach, and anxious to be useful to all
conditions of men. This individual&mdash;Caroline
Chisholm&mdash;the greatest, the only practical reformer and
worker in colonisation of the age, who will be remembered and
blessed by thousands following their flocks and cultivating their
farms in Australia, when the names of the land-jobbers and
charlatans of the "sufficient-price school," the "Protectionists
of colonial capital," are forgotten.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>
<h4>CAROLINE CHISHOLM.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Mrs. Caroline Chisholm</span> arrived in
Sydney in 1839, with her children and husband, Captain Archibald
Chisholm, of the Madras army, who had been making a tour of the
Australian colonies during a limited sick leave. On returning to
India he decided to leave his family in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Soon after their arrival, during the first crash of insolvency
of 1839, some Highland emigrants, who spoke no English and had
large families, found difficulty in obtaining employment. A
little money lent them by Captain Chisholm to purchase tools, and
a little useful advice, set them up as wood-cutters, and they
prospered; while assisting his countrymen, having seen the
neglected state of the bounty emigrants, he pointed them out to
his wife as fit objects for her charitable zeal and energy. There
is a wonderful freemasonry among the poor&mdash;by degrees Mrs.
Chisholm's rooms were crowded by emigrants seeking advice. But it
was the unprotected position of female and often friendless
emigrants that awakened her warmest sympathies. She commenced her
<i>work</i>, in the literal sense of the term, by at the same
time gathering information and acquiring the confidence of the
working classes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm found young women who had emigrated nominally
under the care of friends, but really under that of strangers, at
the instigation of the bounty agent, without home, some lodged in
tents with companions of indifferent character, others wandering
friendless through the streets of Sydney. Many of them having
been collected in rural districts, knew more of cows and pigs
than housework, and if engaged in town, soon lost their
situations, and were superseded by more accomplished servants
from ships which arrived daily. Some of these poor creatures
slept in retired nooks out in the public gardens and in the
rocks, rather than face the contamination of the streets. The
total number of respectable females unemployed in Sydney at one
time in 1840-1 amounted to six hundred.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>MRS. CAROLINE CHISHOLM.</small></p>
<br>
<p>There were other and more serious evils attendant on
emigration, as then conducted, than the condition of the
emigrants on landing. A considerable number of females of
notoriously bad character were sent out in the bounty ships for
whom bounty was never claimed. The Emigration Board sat in Sydney
merely to apportion the bounty; the utmost punishment they could
inflict was to stop the passage-money due to the agents. So long
as the emigrants were delivered in good health, and within the
standard, there was neither tribunal nor even organised opinion
which could be brought to bear on any of the parties connected
with the mercantile transaction. If duly invoiced, the bill for
the live lumber was paid, while damaged goods were rejected. In
some ships the emigrants were deprived of their fair share of
provisions, insulted and assaulted by the crew, even by the
officers, and otherwise abused. In others unrestrained
intercourse took place between the officers, the crew, and the
female passengers. In more than one instance the captain or
surgeon selected pretty emigrants for companions during the
voyage, and during their stay in Sydney.</p>
<p>On arrival in harbour, not only were single gentlemen allowed
to choose housekeepers on board, but notorious brothel-keepers
regularly visited the emigrant-ships. The captain and surgeon
could not know them, and had no power to impede them if they did.
There was no government officer on board to superintend the
contracts or protect the emigrants; and thus, while women fell
into the hands of seducers and harlots, there were a certain
number of keen hands, with whom few in the colony would deal
without a lawyer, who skimmed the cream of the labour from the
ship on terms of very sharp practice. All these things oozed out
in England among the emigrating classes, and made, and continued
to make, long after they were to a great extent remedied,
emigration very unpopular; but no one cared, or dared to take up
the obnoxious and ungenteel position of the emigrants' friend in
Sydney. The colonists had not then learned that the cheapest and
most powerful mode of colonising is to make the working colonists
content.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm had courage and foresight. She began by
appealing to the press and to private individuals on behalf of
the poor destitute girl immigrants. At first she met with much
discouragement, a few civil speeches&mdash;no assistance.</p>
<p>The most imperious section of the employer class saw no
advantage from the protection of the employed. The officials
foresaw more work, some supervision, and no increase of pay. The
Roman Catholics, as soon as they found it was to be a universal,
or, to use the Irish term, a "godless" scheme of practical
philanthropy, and not sectarian and proselytising, opposed it
vehemently. A dignitary of that church wrote a letter to a
newspaper, in which he termed Mrs. Chisholm a lady labouring
under amiable delusions. At the same time the Protestants raised
the cry of "No Popery!"</p>
<p>But she pressed on her plan of a "Home," and when almost
defeated was nerved to determination by the sight of a Highland
beauty, "poor Flora"&mdash;whom she had last known a happy,
hopeful girl&mdash;drunken, despairing, contemplating, and
hastening to commit, suicide.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm offered to devote her time gratuitously to a
"Home of Protection," and to endeavour to procure situations for
the emigrant girls, unengaged and out of place, in the
country&mdash;an offer which was eventually accepted, after "she
had given an undertaking not to put the government to any
expense." On obtaining this concession she issued the following
circular, which will give an example of that practical business
talent to which she owes her success, not less than to her
genuine philanthropy:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:right;"><small>"<span class=
"a">Jamieson-street, Sydney</span>, <i>October</i> 21<i>st</i>,
1841.</small></div>
<br>
"Sir,&mdash;I am endeavouring to establish a 'Home for Female
Immigrants,' and have little doubt but funds will soon be raised
to enable me to accomplish this; and, as my first object is to
facilitate their obtaining employment in the country, I shall
feel obliged if you will favour my intention (should you approve
of the same) by giving me the information I require regarding
your district; and any suggestion you may think useful will be
considered a favour.<br>
<br>
"1st. Whether girls who at home have merely been accustomed to
milk cows, wash, and the common household work about a farm,
would readily get places? at what wages? and how many do you
think would in the course of the next two years be required?<br>
<br>
"2nd. Good servants, such as housemaids and cooks, the rate of
wages? and the probable number required for the same period?<br>
<br>
"3rd. Married couples with small families, say two or three
children, ditto.<br>
<br>
"4th. Could employment and protection be found for boys and girls
from seven to fourteen years of age?<br>
<br>
"5th. Have you had opportunities of observing if the young women
can save any part of their wages? for they are generally of
opinion that nothing can be saved in the country, every article
of wearing apparel being so much dearer than in town.<br>
<br>
"6th. What would be the cheapest and best way of conveying the
young women to your district?<br>
<br>
"I have to observe that the servants will be classed according to
their qualifications, and distributed fairly, so that those who
are absent will have an <i>equal chance</i> of getting a good
servant with those who are present. Subscribers of £1 will have
servants selected and sent to them without any trouble; it will,
however, be necessary that an order should be sent to cover the
expense of their conveyance.<br>
<br>
"I require by donations to raise what will furnish a house; and
by subscriptions I expect to support the institution. I am of
opinion that when families in the interior can get servants sent
them, we shall not hear of young women suffering distress and
losing character for want of a situation. I shall feel obliged if
you will favour me with a reply by the 10th of November next.<br>
<br>
"I have taken the liberty to annex a subscription list, and I
shall feel obliged if you would leave it in the hands of some
person to receive subscriptions, and acquaint me with the name,
that it may appear in the papers."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>It was in reply to one of these circulars that the Rev. Henry
Styles, of Windsor, the chaplain to the Bishop of Australia, an
honest opponent, wrote:&mdash;"I fully appreciate the zeal and
charity in your endeavours to establish the 'Home for Female
Emigrants.' My only reason for declining to co-operate in a
design which at first sight appears so entirely laudable is, that
it is natural to suppose that an institution established by a
lady who is a devoted member of the Catholic Church, which
renders allegiance to Rome, should prove rather an instrument for
augmenting the numbers of that communion, than merely what its
name imports&mdash;a home for all destitute female emigrants,
without respect to their religious professions. The result would
be, that the immigrants in your 'Home' would be <i>advised,
restrained</i>, and <i>protected</i> by the clergy of the Church
of Rome." After thus expressing himself, the reverend gentlemen
replied minutely to every question in the circular.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm's answer to this plain and proper letter
produced a second letter from Mr. Styles, in which he said, "Your
frank and straightforward avowal of the objects you aim at, and
the means you will use for their attainment, disarm suspicion.
The assurance in your note that you will not be led by the agents
of any ecclesiastical party, but that you will pursue steadily
the good of the whole of the emigrants who may come under your
care, referring in matters of religion to their respective clergy
and teachers, induces me to offer you very cordially whatever
support I am able to afford. I beg to enclose £2 as a
donation."</p>
<p>Eleven years have elapsed since this correspondence took
place. Proselytism and propagandism are not to be done in a
corner. For every day during that period Mrs. Chisholm has almost
lived in public, yet no case of misuse of her influence has ever
been brought against her.</p>
<p>The government building appropriated to the "Home" consisted
of a low wooden barrack fourteen feet square. Mrs. Chisholm found
it needful, for the protection of the characters of the girls, to
sleep on the premises. A store-room seven feet square, without a
fire-place, and infested with rats, was cleared out for her
accommodation. There she dwelt, eating, drinking, and sleeping,
dependent on the kindness of a prisoner employed in the adjoining
government printing-office for a kettle of hot water for tea, her
only luxury; and there she laid the foundation of a system to
which thousands owe their happiness in this world and the world
to come&mdash;saved from temptation to vice, and put on the road
to industrious independence; a system which, if fairly carried
out, would save and civilise a great empire from the pollution of
nomadic money-earning and unsocial profusion&mdash;from the rule
of a plutocracy and the horrors of a servile war.</p>
<p>Following the example of our greatest philosophers in every
branch of science, Mrs. Chisholm was careful and eager to collect
facts, but slow to publish grave conclusions. If she claimed
publicity it was not to propound a complicated theory, but to
attack some flagrant abuse.</p>
<p>The first party of girls collected within the "Home" amounted
to ninety, whom Mrs. Chisholm protected from open insult, covert
seduction, and the evil influence of black sheep, inevitably
admitted at times, while seeking to obtain them employment. The
difficulties were great, the annoyances most wearying. The girls
were many of them ignorant and awkward, others too pretty, and
others again too proud and idle to work; but Mrs. Chisholm never
gave them up while there was hope and a good heart.</p>
<p>She says in her first pamphlet&mdash;"If I had entered the
office expecting grateful thanks from all, I should have seen in
a week my folly; but, having a very fair knowledge of human
nature, I was aware that to be able to do a good I must be
prepared to encounter certain disagreeables. I did not start
expecting to please all, but intending to be just and fair
towards all."</p>
<p>As for the mistresses, she told them in print&mdash;probably
the first time so wholesome a truth had been so plainly
stated&mdash;that "the assignment system of convict servants had
spoiled them a little; it will take some time to teach them," she
observes, "that they have lost a little power, or, in fact, that
they must bear and forbear;" "an English servant would not like
the ration and lock-up system, and would expect domestic comforts
not common in Sydney;" "many of the mistresses are apt to take
the law into their own hands."</p>
<p>These statements were unpleasant to make and unpopular; but
they worked a cure, which if not effected would have damaged the
character of the colony in the home country.</p>
<p>The general public, as distinguished from the official class,
when they understood the nature of the plans Mrs. Chisholm was
engaged upon, responded very liberally to her appeal for
assistance. But before they gained confidence in her plans the
"Home" became crowded with a number of girls more fit for rough
country work than town service. There was no machinery extant for
distributing them, so Mrs. Chisholm determined to avail herself
of the information supplied in answers to her circulars, and to
send them into the country. The first dray that came to the door
was sent away empty: frightened with foolish 'board-ship stories
of blacks and bushrangers, not one girl would go. A second
attempt, the first failure having been kept a secret, was
successful. Mrs. Chisholm, at her own risk and expense, took a
party up the Hunter River district by steam-boat. The enterprise
was considered so Quixotish by her friends that, as she sat on
deck in the centre of her troop of girls, no one of her
acquaintance dared to expose himself to the ridicule of owning
acquaintance by offering any refreshment.</p>
<p>The plan succeeded; the girls were well placed in the families
of often humble but always respectable married people, and
competent committees were induced to undertake the charge of
"Branch Homes" in the interior. The bush journeys were repeated
with parties of young women, varing from sixteen to thirty, who
were conveyed to Campbell Town, Maitland, Liverpool, Paramatta,
Cross Roads, and Port Macquarie&mdash;Yass, Gundegai,
Murrumbidgee, Goulburn, and Bathurst&mdash;where she went from
farm to farm, scrutinising the characters of the residents before
she trusted them with "her children."</p>
<p>The settlers came forward nobly, and supplied provisions,
horses, and drays; the inns universally refused payment for Mrs.
Chisholm's personal accommodation; and the coaches, a most costly
conveyance in Australia, carried her sick women and children
free. Mr. William Bradley, a gentleman born in the colony, a
member of the Legislative Council, gave an unlimited credit to
draw for anything for the use of the emigrants&mdash;of which she
was not obliged to avail herself, so liberally did the colonists
of the interior come forward.</p>
<p>Very soon the fathers, brothers, sons, and husbands claimed
the same care, and asked to be permitted to form part of her
parties. Her journeys became longer and her armies larger: 147
souls left Sydney, which increased on the road to 240, in one
party, in drays and on foot, Mrs. Chisholm leading the way on
horseback. She established a registry-office for servants, where
names could be inscribed and agreements effected on fair terms
gratuitously: she drew up and printed <i>a fair</i> agreement, of
which the master took one, the servant one, and one was filed.
The result of this registration was to extinguish litigation as
far as regards servants engaged at the "Home." Out of many
thousands only two were litigated. Yet in the course of her
experience, before she stirred in the matter, and for want of
<i>agreements</i> and speedy justice, fifty-one cases occurred up
to 1843 of wages unjustly detained or taxed. For the first time
the emigrant found a "friend."</p>
<p>The abuse of power by captains, and the immorality of the
inferior sort of surgeons, at that time engaged in the Australian
trade, were checked by a prosecution which she compelled the
governor to institute against parties who had driven a girl mad
by their violence.</p>
<p>When Sir George Gipps, hesitating, said, as officials will
say, "A government prosecution is a very serious matter," she
answered, "I am ready to prosecute: <i>I</i> have the necessary
evidence; and if it be a risk whether I or these men shall go to
prison, I am ready to stand the risk." That trial established a
precedent and checked the abuse.</p>
<p>By the end of 1842 Mrs. Chisholm had succeeded in placing
comfortably two thousand emigrants of both sexes, and then, when
slowly recovering from the effects of a serious illness brought
on by her exertions, she published the remarkable report to which
we have before alluded.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Female Emigration considered in a Brief
Account of the Sydney Emigrants' Home. By the Secretary. Sydney:
James Tegg, 1842."]</p>
<p>It is a collection of notes and memoranda, interspersed with
pithy remarks and pathetic and comic sketches from real
life&mdash;a valuable contribution to the art of colonisation,
and a literary curiosity. It was an outspoken book; it did not
mince matters&mdash;as, for instance, in the following passage,
which went far to kill the bounty system, and so, although people
were shocked, the evil was abated:&mdash;"One girl, long known at
Liverpool as the Countess, arrived per ship; the last time I saw
her was on a Sunday; she had evidently started in the morning,
with an intention to look interesting at either St. James's or
St. Mary's, for her book was in her hand; but she had taken a
glass by the way, and was so far aware of her state that she
retired to the domain. I saw her fall twice. Now people express
their astonishment 'that English girls are not sent out.' We will
suppose that some Liverpool families are meditating this step,
and, in their anxiety to obtain all information, they learn that
the <i>Countess</i> is missing&mdash;has left for Australia (by a
bounty ship). They condemn all for one they shrink with horror
from sending their daughters where the <i>Countess</i> is
received&mdash;they are strangers to all on board, therefore all
suffer for one. I wish particularly to call attention to the
injustice done to girls of good character by a case of
association, and not a solitary one like the one I have stated.
Again, in Sydney, the character of the <i>Countess</i> is known
in less than two hours, arid the girls of good character in the
same ship suffer."</p>
<p>In this "<i>Countess</i>" story was the germ of one great
feature of Mrs. Chisholm's Family Colonisation
Society&mdash;protection for single girls.</p>
<p>In the same effective manner the letter exposes all the tricks
practised on the Bounty Board and on the government agents. The
following illustrates a class still plentiful:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"One girl, having health and strength, had refused
five situations; at last I thought I had suited her. She was to
live in a settler's family, and teach five children to read and
write: she was not required to wash the children; but, as the
good and thrifty woman kept no servants, she was to wash her own
clothes (or pay for the same out of her wages), make her own bed,
and clean her own room: the good woman also said, she would teach
her anything she knew, but ask her to do nothing. I thought there
could be no objection to this; but when I told her that once a
week she must scour her own room (the best in the
house)&mdash;when I said this she burst into a passionate flood
of tears; the degradation was more than she could bear. I thought
it then my duty to refuse her the benefit of the Home. In less
than three months from this this victim of false pride was living
with &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;; anything rather than work. I have
since regretted that I did not give her one more trial."<br>
<br>
"The 'Do-nothings.' This name will surprise some and offend
others, but in the end will do good; and I really do not know any
one useful thing they can do. E&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; was entered
as a governess; I was glad of this, for I had then, as I have
now, several applications for governesses, in the country: she
was a pretty girl too; and I know when pretty girls have no
money&mdash;no friends Sydney is a very bad place. There is
nothing so unpleasant as to question a young lady as to her
competency. She could teach music, French, drawing, &amp;c.
&amp;c.; she was satisfied with the salary, and her testimonials
were first-rate. 'You say you can teach music?' 'Yes ma'am.' 'You
thoroughly understand it?' 'Most certainly.' 'One of your pupils
is nine years of age; how long do you think it will take her to
get through Cramer's Instruction Book?' A pause. 'Perhaps you
have not seen it?' 'No, ma'am, but I was very quick
myself&mdash;I have a good ear for music.' 'What book did you
study from?' 'I learnt singing and music at the same time.' 'Tell
me the name of the first piece you played? 'Cherry ripe.' 'The
second?' 'Home sweet home.' 'The third?' 'We're a'noddin.' I said
no more about music. I gave her a sum in addition; and she made
sixteen pounds five, eighteen pounds four. Now this girl I
afterwards ascertained, at home, had lived in a family as
nursemaid, and washed the clothes of five children every week:
but she was a pretty girl&mdash;something of a favourite at sea.
The captain was very anxious about her; had taken her in his own
boat, to the North-shore, to try and get her a good place; he
devoted seven hours to this work of charity. Nor did his zeal
rest here&mdash;the following day he took her to Paramatta; they
returned to the ship, and this girl was kept four days in it,
after the other girls left. When he called at my office he was
astonished, horrified, that I knew the detail; said Sydney was a
scandalising place; that his feelings were those of a father.
However, I received the girl the same evening, and removed her
the following day very far from his parental influence."<br>
<br>
"But for another specimen; and really, out of fifty, I am at a
loss how to select; but I will give &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. She
was another of the would-be governesses; but her views were more
humble&mdash;for the nursery. Now, she could neither read, write,
nor spell, correctly. 'Can you wash your own clothes?' 'Never did
such a thing in my life.' 'Can you make a dress?' 'No.' 'Cook?'
'No.' 'What can you do?' 'Why, ma'am, I could look after
servants; I could direct them; I should make an excellent
housekeeper.' 'You are certain?' 'Yes, or I would not say so.'
'Do you know the quantity of the different ingredients wanted for
a beef-steak pie for that dish and a rice pudding for this?' 'Oh,
no, ma'am, that's not what I mean; I'd see that the servants did
it.' 'But there might be great waste, and you not know it;
besides all, or nearly all, the servants sent to this colony
require teaching.' Nothing but my faith in Providence that there
must be a place for everybody enabled me to bear with this
infliction; and yet, if I turned them out, I knew their fate. But
it was trying to my patience every morning to be up and
breakfasted, and in my office first. I never had but one in the
Home of this class that fairly made her own bed; they would
smooth them over and, night after night, get into
them."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The following is in a more serious strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I may here remark, that in going my evening rounds
in the rear of the establishment I never met with any
impertinence. And after I had been three months or so in office,
on going out, I saw a large party of men at the corner of the
Domain-gate, evidently trying to conceal two girls: I knew one of
them, the other was a stranger. 'Have you any relations in the
colony?' 'No.' 'Then come with me.' She was a young girl, not
more than fifteen; she refused, and went into the Domain. I sent
the other into the Home, and followed her; in a few minutes she
returned with me, and I found myself suddenly surrounded by men,
I felt, I must acknowledge, in that lonely place, very
uncomfortable, but my fears were groundless; they came to
apologise, to express their regret at the great annoyance they
had given me, and promised me never again to go near the place.
'We never knew you until to-night; we thought you were well paid
for looking after the emigrant girls; but when we saw you follow
the strip of a girl and we have been talking to this man, and he
says you don't get a penny, and that all you do is for the girls'
good, we do say, that that man is <i>not a man</i> who gives you
trouble;&mdash;good night, ma'am.' I never saw but one of these
men afterwards, and he came on a mission of mercy, to tell me of
a girl that he thought would be advised, and kept from ruin; he
was in terror lest he should be found out. 'I should be jeered
at, past bearing; but somehow it lay on my mind&mdash;I ought to
tell you.' This girl is now well married; and she may thank this
poor man that she, under Providence, escaped the pit dug for
her."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>This strange little book concludes with the following
recommendation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I am now going to give advice, and am really at a
loss how and where to begin. 'Tis a delicate&mdash;an ungracious
task; this I know from experience. Perhaps the very thing I am
going to advise, &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has determined to do; and
if this is the case, I dread the perverseness of human nature:
for I have more than once heard a person say, 'Now I meant to do
the very thing you tell me; but if I do it now it will look like
taking your advice and to be advised by a lady! Pshaw!
nonsense&mdash;the idea is ridiculous, and I won't do it.' Now an
'I won't' from a gentleman is just as troublesome a thing to
manage as an 'I will' from a lady&mdash;how must I proceed? By
the bye, I recollect having read that enlightened men of all ages
have looked upon advisers as friends, and have said that 'shreds
of knowledge may be picked up from ploughboys, and patches from
old women are worth preserving:' this encourages me to begin; and
as this is a very ceremonious colony, where a breach of etiquette
would be a serious offence, I will commence with his excellency
the governor I therefore, with every feeling of respect, beg to
suggest to his excellency the governor, that he should promise
protection and shelter to all female emigrants sent to this
colony, until situations are provided for them. I also most
earnestly entreat and implore that no more engagements may be
allowed on board ship. As soon as an emigrant ship arrives, the
board should assemble, and the emigrants be fairly drafted to the
district Homes, giving a fair and proportionate share to Sydney.
The gentleman whose duty it is to draft the emigrants according
to orders received must have the confidence of the people; he
must be a person of honourable integrity, and alike proof against
a lady's entreaties and a gentleman's censure. Those emigrants
that are intended for Port Macquarie, Moreton Bay, Maitland,
Wollongong, Manning Elver, &amp;c., should be received per
steamers and small crafts from the ship. Those intended for
Sydney, Liverpool, Campbell Town, Goulburn, Bathurst, &amp;c.,
should be sent to the place intended for their reception, and I
hope Grose's Farm will be appropriated for this purpose: this
would be very convenient for drays. I also beg to curtail the
privileges of the board: they must not be allowed to select
servants for themselves or their friends, even though they chance
to be members of the Bent-street club.* All who want servants
must go to the Registry-office for them; let all have a fair
chance: this appendage to the agent's office I hope your
excellency will sanction. The district Homes cannot be kept open
without one, and I do hope your excellency will give them all the
aid in your power. Any government buildings that are unoccupied
cannot be better employed; and I also hope you will lend tents
freely. I think you must acknowledge that I have not asked for
half what your excellency expected: my moderation will, I hope,
induce you to grant all."</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Benjamin Boyd's Club of
Squatters&mdash;the aristocracy of wool.]</p>
<blockquote>"I now beg to call the attention of the gentlemen of
the interior to the necessity of establishing Homes. The expense
of a Home in the country is very trifling: if there should be no
government buildings available, a few tents, and a small cottage
will suffice. Food is cheap and plentiful a sack of flour from
one, a bag of potatoes from another, a basket of cabbages, and a
few pumpkins, go a great way, and all would help the Home&mdash;a
few sheep too, a welcome gift; and what gentleman is there that
would not give one or two in the year? The amount of the ten
days' rations you could fairly claim. Sending the emigrants up in
large numbers would make conveyance cheap: you would establish
such rules as met the wants of your district. A Home well looked
after will be a saving to you of time, trouble, and expense. You
become familiar with the people; you know their characters; you
can influence them for their good. If a man forfeits his word,
and flies from his agreement, his conduct is reported to the
committee; his character is known in the district. I see no other
plan by which you can get a fair supply of servants: if you go on
in the old way, you must take what the people of Sydney refuse.
Wealthy men can afford to spend their time in Sydney; and before
you can hear, in the country, of a ship's arrival in Sydney, the
single men, the shepherds you want, will be on their way to J.
B.'s or members of council."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The appendix contains answers to a circular from ten
magistrates and clergymen, stating that "not one of the girls
sent through Mrs. Chisholm's name had lost character as regarded
<i>honesty and morality</i>;" and a letter to the "Sydney
Immigration Board," with hints not without value, even in
1853.</p>
<p>"The present mode of selecting emigrants must be faulty, as it
allows so many bad bargains to creep in. I have heard that this
evil is to be remedied by getting the parochial clergy of England
to select emigrants for you. The idea amuses me, <i>that you
should suppose you can get people to do for you what you ought to
do for yourselves</i>." "There are poor rates in the mother
country, and to suppose that the clergy and magistrates will send
you their best, and keep their worst, is to give them credit for
an extraordinary share of kindness." And again, after some comic
pictures of pauper hard-bargains, who were "too sick to work, but
not sick enough for the hospital," she says&mdash;referring to
the fall in wages that took place between the time when the
crimps published their glowing placards, and the arrival of the
ship in the colony:&mdash;</p>
<p>"From the opening of the office I had the confidence of the
emigrants.* In a short time they requested me to fix the wages
they should accept. Disappointed, as many of them were, in their
expectations, they never doubted my endeavours to serve them.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This is the secret of successful colonisation
which none of our squatter and capitalist or church colonising
societies have yet learned&mdash;S. S.]</p>
<p>"Feeling the responsibility and confidence, I exerted myself
to obtain, as far as was possible, an accurate knowledge of what
rate of wages the flockmasters could pay their shepherds.</p>
<p>"I first inquired of the wealthy men whose flocks cover the
mountains, and whose cattle crowd the valleys. They agreed on £15
and £16 per annum as the most that could be paid. These gentlemen
said they acted on principle, and did not care for the money.</p>
<p>"I then inquired of those respectable, but less wealthy
settlers who have one sheep and one cattle station, and live
retired at a convenient distance from both. They thought from £18
to £20 a year; the latter doubtful. I went lastly to the third
class, who, having two stations, instead of employing servants
only, live always at one or the other farm their own farms, in
fact. These could afford to pay £20&mdash;never wanted, or
wished, to see wages less.</p>
<p>"There is nothing, perhaps, that injures a colony more than
giving the working population a bad character. Respectable people
of capital get alarmed: yet many charges have been brought
against servants which I consider unjust."</p>
<p>This plain speaking and unusual style of colonial
publication&mdash;hard truths without acidity&mdash;did its work.
A considerable reform was introduced. Government protection was
granted to friendless young women; an agent appointed to
superintend and witness the agreements with men on board ship;
and the colonial press, when furnished with the materials, did
good service to emigration reform. The whole cost to government
of the guarding and distribution of the emigrants was little more
than 100. The other expenses were borne by Mrs. Chisholm and the
friends whom her honest, clear-sighted policy had made among
persons of all politics and various religious views.</p>
<p>In 1843, before a committee of the Legislative Council, which
was appointed to consider the condition of the "distressed
labourers," and especially of three hundred parties with large
families whom, in the depressed condition of the colony, the
settlers could not afford to engage, Mrs. Chisholm took another
step forward. She proposed, and entered into, the details of a
plan which, at a very trifling expense, would have placed these
three hundred families in a self-supporting position on land,
instead of continuing to receive 3s. a day for nominal labour on
government works.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps's instructions precluded him from granting or
<i>leasing</i> of crown land for this valuable, or any other
purpose, except feeding sheep. As he expressed it, "he was sent
out to carry out the Wakefield system," and could turn neither to
the right nor to the left, Nevertheless, on private property, on
clearing leases, Mrs. Chisholm succeeded in placing some families
of mechanics.</p>
<p>In the course of her examination it appears that the
government had then expended £2,500 in casual relief. For £1,000
she considered the whole distress could be extinguished, and the
people not only removed, but placed where they could do some good
for themselves. "The distress will increase unless proper
measures are taken, but if they are promptly taken it will not be
very serious." There are several "trades mentioned in the list
that are not required; for instance, I have only had two
applications for shoemakers; for tailors four. The number stated
to be unemployed is forty-seven. About twenty months ago forty
tailors came to me out of employ. The flockmasters refused to
take them as shepherds. With a great deal of trouble I scattered
them through different parts of the country as domestic servants,
and in other capacities; and it is remarkable that nearly all
thus scattered have been able to find work at their own trade.
With respect to tradesmen and labourers with large families,
there is no way in which they could provide for their families so
well as on a piece of land.</p>
<p>"My first arrangement would be to select from fifty families
one who was a good judge of land, and one of the women, as women
would require to know what kind of a place they were going to,
whether the children would be comfortable, &amp;c. I should also
require two or three good bush hands [prisoners] from Hyde Park
Barracks. With these, as soon as arrived on land, I would set to
work to clear half an acre, in order that the people might see
what could be done in a given time. There must be some tents
provided until more substantial buildings could be erected. One
allotment must be set apart as a family allotment, to be first
cleared and cultivated, to supply food for the whole community.
Then the land must be divided and apportioned to the different
families. A schoolmaster will go with the party, to have land
rent free. The parents of the children have agreed to pay for the
education of their children, the terms settled by me. One day's
labour per quarter for each child, and for the whole family 1
cwt. of potatoes and one bushel of wheat.</p>
<p>"I have worked this plan on a small scale for the last three
years, where there has been a large family. The eldest girl has,
in some instances, gone to service, and given up a portion of her
earnings to support them. Upwards of one hundred small settlers
have thus received assistance from their relatives. Many have
half or a third share in a dray.</p>
<p>"I should advise limiting these people to twenty acres, with a
lease of not less than ten or fifteen years. On a less term the
tenant works for the proprietor. . . . The plan is before you to
accept or reject. All I ask is that, if you approve it, you will
let me work it out my own way. Appoint the government emigration
agent treasurer, and two gentlemen to examine and control the
expenditure. You will bear in mind, in forming an opinion of my
statements, that mine is not a plan of to-day. The working it out
will be attended with much trouble and responsibility to me; at
the same time I am certain the people will work with me. The
distress will be removed, and those persons who are now suffering
in Sydney will, if my plan is carried out, within three years,
become the employers of labour."</p>
<p>At this last sentence one of the committee allowed his fears
of the bugaboo ever present to the imagination of the Australian
capitalist&mdash;to escape him, a terror carefully nourished by
the Colonial Office, and guarded against with endless folds of
red tape of the true Wakefield hue. He exclaimed, "I am afraid we
should find that these people, becoming employers of labour,
would do us mischief!"</p>
<p>Not a word, not a thought of the benefit conferred upon three
hundred destitute families, converted from costly paupers to
independent peasant proprietors, but only terror lest they should
become so well off as to give wages at £20 a year instead of
£16.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm answered, "I do not think so, but rather that
you would be able to obtain in the children of these people
brought up in sober, industrious, and frugal habits, a most
valuable description of labourers; this class of persons prefer
sending their children at a certain age (and for a limited
period) into service with respectable families."</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm's plan was rejected, and she was left to work it
out as well as she could with private assistance on the land of a
speculator; and to go on laboriously registering agreements and
distributing emigrants from farm to farm, as we shall presently
describe.</p>
<p>The committee in their report recorded "their grateful sense
of the valuable services of a lady to whose benevolent exertions
on behalf of the unemployed, as well as of free emigrants of the
humbler classes generally, this colony is under the highest
obligations,&mdash;Mrs. Chisholm, whose name is so well known for
her disinterested and untiring exertions."</p>
<p>The chairman of the committee was Dr. Lang.</p>
<p>In August, 1844, the distress amongst the labourers and
mechanics of Sydney had not ceased. A committee was reappointed
to consider it. There was a great clamour in favour of
undertaking bridges, roads, and other public works, with public
money. The mob and officials were favourable to the scheme. The
government emigration agent was examined before this committee.
"His knowledge," he states, "of the emigrants who arrived in past
years was merely general, of the present year tolerably
accurate;" "had no knowledge of the number of destitute families
then in Sydney;" had no detailed information, but thought a
certain detailed statement delivered in by a former witness
exaggerated. This was a gentleman paid for his services, who,
according to colonial custom, considered it his duty to perform
his strictly office duties, and think and know no more,&mdash;a
very natural view, considering the ill reward that any zeal
obtains, except zeal for the views of the Colonial Secretary of
State.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm, being called before this committee, produced a
complete statistical statement, exhibiting the numbers, ages,
sexes, characters, and trades of the unemployed (in all 2,034
souls), the number of weeks and average number per man they had
been unemployed. These tables show some curious particulars: 59
carpenters and 25 joiners, 10 butlers and 10 coachmen and grooms,
15 cabinet-makers, 26 brickmakers, 10 quarrymen and 19
bricklayers, 2 surgeons, 2 hairdressers, and 1 tailor; 244 farm
labourers&mdash;in all 572. "The large number of children made it
difficult to provide for many of these families."
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* "The system of relieving distress has
now been in operation for a year; we have been consuming capital,
we can only remove distress by producing it." "Last year I
settled some families on land, and, considering the many
difficulties thrown in my way, they have succeeded remarkably
well on private land. I wished to try the system of leasing, in
order to see whether the people were industrious, and could
subsist on land; and I have satisfied myself that, although any
gentleman would lose a large fortune if he were to commence as a
farmer, where the family are all workers an industrious man
cannot do better than get on land. The great difficulty with me
has been that I have never had an opportunity of putting a
sufficient number of people together; and where they are only a
few they have no team, no set of tools, and there is a constant
struggle; yet they do succeed."</p>
<p>Now, this in a few words is the true art of colonisation.
Locate poor men on waste land in England or Ireland and they sink
under the multiplicity of money payments or debts, having to
compete with a fund of cheap labour, and inferior land against
superior land and skilled cultivation. Locate the same men in a
colony, and they rise buoyed up by a surrounding dear labour
market, which enables them to barter their chief possession,
labour, for seeds, tools, stock, or whatever they may need; a
virgin soil, and the absence of money payments for rent or taxes,
and of competition of agricultural skill, compensating for the
want of capital and rural experience. Thus, a day's labour from
time to time with a neighbouring farmer will buy a yoke of
bullocks, a dray, a quarter of wheat or maize, and assist both.
In England and Ireland a poor man clings to land in hopes of
making more than bare wages by extra toil; in a colony a man
desires land to keep his family together, even at some sacrifice
of money wages. In old countries the little freehold must be
divided with sons and sons-in-law; in a colony the full-fledged
brood can always, if idle "protective" laws do not impede, go
further afield, and find a new site for a nest. So argued in
other words Mrs. Chisholm; and many a flockowner, now
contemplating his flocks spreading wildly unshepherded over his
run, and the deserted huts of his single men shepherds on their
way to the diggings, wishes he had followed Mrs. Chisholm's
advice, and encouraged children as well as sheep.</p>
<p>Not being able to induce the governor and the influential
colonists to go heartily into her land-colonising plans, Mrs.
Chisholm continued to employ herself in dispersing the people
through the interior, and in teaching the government and the
colonists, by example, how the colonial part of colonisation
should be conducted. She worked hard for six years, warmly
supported by some of the first among the colonists, the
Wentworths, M'Arthurs, Bradleys, Fitzgeralds, Suttors, and Dr.
Nicholson, the present speaker of the Legislative Council, and by
the unanimous confidence of the working classes, but subject to
much obstruction and annoyance in official quarters.</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps, who was capable of noble sentiments when his
evil temper or home instructions did not override them, took a
public opportunity of expressing his sense of the merit and
utility of her plans&mdash;saying, "I think it right to make this
public acknowledgment, having formerly thrown cold water upon
them."</p>
<p>A characteristic anecdote is circulated in the colony in
reference to the privilege of franking letters, which Sir George
had given to Mrs. Chisholm. A few days after the permission had
been granted, the governor sent for her in a great hurry. She
found him much excited, and the table covered with her own
letters. "Mrs. Chisholm," he exclaimed, "when I gave you the
privilege of franking, I presumed you would address yourself to
the magistrates, the clergy, and the principal settlers; but who,
pray, are these John Varleys and Dick Hogans, and other people,
of whom I have never heard since I have been in the colony?"</p>
<p>"If," replied Mrs. Chisholm, "I had required to know the
opinions of those respectable gentlemen on the subject of the
demand for labour, and the rate of wages they could afford, I
need not have written; I can turn to half a dozen blue books and
find there 'shepherds always wanting, and wages always too high;'
besides, to have answered me they must have gone to their
overseers, and then answered me vaguely. I want to know, as
nearly as possible, what number of labourers each district can
absorb, and of what class and what wages. If your excellency will
wait until I get my answers, you will admit that I have applied
to men humble but intelligent, and able to afford exactly the
information I require."</p>
<p>Sir George Gipps was satisfied with the explanation, and still
more with the replies of the bush settlers; so the sub-officials
were on this occasion discomfited.</p>
<p>By Mrs. Chisholm's exertions, applied to the elastic resources
of Australia, before 1845 the distress of 2,000 souls was so far
removed that some parties were ready in a few years to assert,
forgetting that a detailed list was on record, that it had never
existed; and in 1845, as Mrs. Chisholm, in her evidence before
the committee of 1844, prophesied, the demand for labour was more
vigorous than ever, and has never since been checked, even for a
moment; on the contrary, the supply has always been under the
demand, both in quantity and quality.</p>

<br>
<small>BUSHING IT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It was while making forced marches at the head of armies of
emigrants, as far as 300 miles into the far interior, sometimes
sleeping at the stations of wealthy settlers, sometimes in the
huts of poor emigrants or prisoners; sometimes camping out in the
bush, teaching the timid, awkward peasantry of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, Protestants and Roman Catholics, Orangemen and
Repealers, how to "bush it;" comforting the women, nursing the
children, putting down any discontented or forward spirits among
the men; now taking a few weary children into her covered
tandem-cart; now mounting on horseback and galloping over a short
cut through the hills to meet her weary caravan, with supper
foraged from the hospitable settlers;&mdash;it was in the midst
of marshes in which she managed the discipline, the route, the
commissariat, the hospital, and the billetting, all herself, with
such aides-de-camp as each army happened to furnish, that she
commenced another great work subsidiary to colonisation, the
"Voluntary Statements of the People of New South Wales," for the
use of the home country. These were statements in answer to the
series of printed questions, taken down in the words of the
informant, of which we shall give some examples at the end of
this chapter.</p>
<p>They were written down in all manner of dwellings, but chiefly
among the humbler; in cottages and bark huts; on the roadside; on
the top of a hat; in the field, on a plough; in the forest, on
the first log of a frugal bush servant's first freehold.</p>
<p>There were nearly eight hundred of these statements from
natives of almost every county of the United Kingdom, from
emigrants, from "old hands," and from ticket-of-leave men.</p>
<p>These records proved incontestably that Australia was a
country in which any industrious man could thrive; that there was
ample verge and room enough for millions; that land which
squatters then and now assert to be only fit for sheep pasture
would support yeomanry in comfort and independence. They laid
bare much injustice, exhibited in a striking manner the demand
and necessity for an increased female population, and presented a
more perfect, truthful, and valuable picture of bush life,
painted by servants and settlers, than had ever been drawn in
travellers' tales or parliamentary blue books.</p>
<p>It was in consequence of the habit of collecting these
statements that Mrs. Chisholm was able to tell the committee of
the House of Lords in 1847:&mdash;"I never returned from a
journey to the interior without gaining information which would
enable me to provide for a second number; and it was frequently
unnecessary to go into a district more than once; then I knew the
character of the people and the sort of servants that would suit
them, and it enabled me to advise people when they called at my
residence to say, 'You go to such a place and I can guarantee you
employment.' My first object was always to get one female
emigrant placed: having succeeded in getting one female servant
in a neighbourhood, I would leave the feeling to spread among
this class. These girls eventually married best, for the parents
were thankful if their son married her.</p>
<p>"One of the most serious impediments to transacting business
of hiring servants in the country were the applications for
wives. Shepherds left their sheep and would come for miles for
this purpose, with their certificates of good character, and of
money deposited in the savings banks, and list of their stock,
and even bank notes. I had more than forty applications of this
kind in two years. One man, according to a note in my
register-book, who came down to Sydney for a wife, was very
anxious to know 'when we should have a new governor who would
attend to matters of consequence like that."</p>
<p>The governor took a different view of the subject, for when,
in the early days of the "Home Protection," it was suggested to
him that many of the forlorn girls if sent into the interior
would marry well, "His excellency drew himself up to his full
height, and exclaimed indignantly, 'What, Mrs. Chisholm! is it my
business to find wives for bush servants?'" He might have done
worse.</p>
<p>In 1845 Mrs. Chisholm was examined before a committee of the
Legislative Council, on the best means of promoting emigration,
the whole distress having been absorbed, and the demand for
labour being urgent. She then produced a few of the "Voluntary
Statements."</p>
<p>In the same year she published a "Prospectus of a Work to be
entitled 'Voluntary Information from the People of New South
Wales, respecting the Social Condition of the Middle and Working
Classes in the Colony,' with the view of furnishing the labourer,
the mechanic, and the capitalist with trustworthy information,
and pointing out obstructions to immigration that ought to be
eradicated." She writes:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Few persons, if any, are more intimately acquainted with the
actual condition of the working classes than I am. Silence,
therefore, would be culpable. The servant in Sydney, the
shepherd, and the small settler in the bush are known to me; I
have visited their homes and witnessed their trials and
deprivations; I have the satisfaction of laying before the public
proofs of their importance as a body and their merits as
individuals: their virtues far exceed their failings&mdash;their
language may be rude, but their hearts are kind and true. To
improve the condition of these people is my object; to break up
the bachelor stations my design; happy homes my reward. To supply
flockmasters with shepherds is a good work: to supply those
shepherds with wives a better. To give the shepherd a good wife
is to make a gloomy, miserable hut a cheerful, contended home; to
introduce married families into the interior is to make
squatters' stations fit abodes for Christian men.</p>
<p>"If I meet with the co-operation I expect, it is my intention
to submit to her Majesty's commissioners of emigration a plan for
female emigration, which will secure the young women the
protection which they so essentially require on the passage and
on their arrival. If protection is extended to the
helpless&mdash;if Britain's moral banner is to be unfurled in the
far interior civilisation and religion will advance until the
spires of the churches guide the traveller from hamlet to hamlet,
and shepherds' huts become the homes of happy, virtuous men and
women,
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"I feel that a judicious circulation of these statements will
promote the best interests in the colony. Personal interest in
the labour market I have none. I hope to enjoy the proud
satisfaction of laying before the British public several thousand
proofs of the good character and persevering energy of her
Majesty's subjects in New South Wales."</p>
<p>In the following year, 1846, Mrs. Chisholm left the colony
with her family for England, charged with the following missions
from the humbler classes:&mdash;</p>
<p>Firstly, From a number of freed prisoners, who had been
promised by the government that if well conducted their wives and
children should be sent to join them. This promise had been
forgotten. A return made to the Legislative Council showed that
these claimants numbered several hundreds.</p>
<p>Secondly, From successful emigrants, who desired to pay the
passages of their wives, parents, and other near relatives.</p>
<p>Thirdly, From parents who, to comply with the regulations of
the emigration commissioners, had left young children beyond the
standard number to the care of poor relatives or the parish.</p>
<p>In the first and last cases, armed with the facts and proofs
necessary, without which she never makes a claim, Mrs. Chisholm
succeeded. The other formed the foundation of the Family
Colonisation Loan Society.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Chisholm sailed for England a committee, which
included eight members of the Legislative Council, magistrates,
landholders, and others of all shades of opinion, raised a
subscription for a testimonial to that lady, and presented an
address, in which they said:&mdash;</p>
<p>"We beg to offer you, on the occasion of your departure from
this colony, the expression of our thanks for your active and
zealous exertions on behalf of the emigrant population during the
last seven years. In establishing <i>emigrants' homes</i>, in
establishing great numbers of the emigrant population in the
interior as servants and occupiers of small farms, your exertions
have proved of signal advantage to the community. In the large
collection of '<i>statistical facts</i>' and 'voluntary
information,' derived from the labouring classes, you have
accumulated materials for establishing the great advantages which
New South Wales possesses as a favourable field for the
emigration of British settlers."</p>
<p>In the course of her reply, Mrs. Chisholm said:&mdash;"<i>It
is my intention, if supported by your co-operation, to attempt
more than I have hitherto performed</i>."</p>
<p>During-the six years and eight months which she spent in
Australia, Mrs. Chisholm, without wealth or rank, or any support
except what her earnest philanthropy gradually acquired, provided
for eleven thousand souls.</p>
<p>Yet since her sojourn in England she has redeemed her pledge,
and done much more. With less than two thousand pounds, between
1850 and 1852, she personally sent out more than one thousand
emigrants of the best class, and has advised, corresponded with,
or otherwise assisted tens of thousands.</p>
<p>We have devoted thus much space to the colonising career of
Mrs. Chisholm, because with her exertions the colonisation of the
interior commenced. Before her time, emigrants were merely
tumbled out on the shores, like so much live stock, to find their
own way to market&mdash;to service, marriage, sin, or death.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm first taught the Australian squatters that
property had its duties as well as its rights. She tapped the
springs of spontaneous self-supporting emigration, and showed how
closely the extension of national power was connected with the
social and domestic virtues inseparable from family
colonisation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>
<h4>RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Beside</span> the questions involved in the
price of land, the tenure and tax on pastures, the abolition of
assignment of prisoners, and cessation of transportation&mdash;on
all of which the governor and his chiefs were at issue with the
colonists, from the day of the opening of the Legislative
Council, when the word "humble" was struck out of the motion for
an address in answer to the governor's speech&mdash;certain
constitutional questions of great importance were at issue
between Sir George Gipps and the Legislative Council.</p>
<p>The Colonial Parliament was justly incensed at finding that
the new constitution gave them nothing more than the liberty of
talking and taxing themselves. Three schedules appropriated
upwards of 80,000 to the payment of officials, over whose
appointment, from the colonial secretary down to the
prothonotary, they had no sort of control. The council attempted
to regulate the distribution of the funds secured by the
schedules, by taking from those who did nothing to give to those
who worked hard. The governor successfully resisted the attempt,
and in other words told them, as Lord Ellenborough told Hone, "to
protest and go about their business." Whereupon the Colonial
Parliament being unable to cut down the sinecure salaries
included in the schedules, retaliated by refusing to vote the
estimates for the sums required over and above the estimates. The
governor responded by cutting down that part of the public
service which was most needed by the colonists. For instance, he
retained the Prothonotary and Master in Equity, and closed the
office of Registrar of Deeds, who regulated all the titles and
mortgages in the colony. From that time forward the struggle
between the governor and that part of the council which was not
official, became relentless. Evil breeds evil&mdash;so in
proportion as Sir George Gipps was despotic and insolent, the
opposition became virulent and factious. Between both it was war
to the knife.</p>
<p>A great battle was fought upon the "District Councils." The
idea of district councils made Sir George Gipps Governor of New
South Wales. He had had influence enough to have the scheme
embodied in the Act of Parliament (5 and 6 Vict. cap. 79, sect.
47), which gave the colony representative institutions. The
theory was plausible: it might have suited Canada, it may suit
England. It met the high approval of Lords Stanley and John
Russell. To this day Earl Grey believes it failed through the
spiteful obstinacy of the colonists. Sir George Gipps, during the
few years of his administration, postponed measures for
establishing schools, for repairing and constructing roads, and
other practical works of the utmost importance to the colony, at
first in order that "his district councils" might reap a harvest
of glory, and afterwards to spite the scoundrels for rejecting so
admirable an institution. And so it was admirable on paper, but
perfectly impracticable in a pastoral colony. Had any other than
himself originated it, the governor would have seen its fallacy
in a month, and dissected it in a masterly despatch.</p>
<p>According to Sir George's plan the inhabitants of each
district were empowered to elect, and if they neglected to elect,
the governor had power to appoint a council, which should decide
on the sum required for a year for the district. Half such sum
was to be contributed from the colonial treasury, and the other
half to be levied on the property in the district. If no local
treasurer was elected, the colonial treasurer could issue his
warrant, and sell up as much of the property of the district as
would raise the requisite sum. But the scheme would not work.</p>
<p>In the first place, there was no population sufficiently dense
to work such a system, there were very few electors, and no
councillors; in the second place, there was no ready money to pay
the taxes.</p>
<p>In a pastoral colony like Australia wages are high,
consumption is large, and by taxes on consumption, levied at the
ports, a considerable revenue may be raised, but by direct
taxation very little. The colonists have, or rather had&mdash;for
it is impossible to say what changes a gold currency may
effect&mdash;sheep and cattle, which they exchanged, in meat,
wool, and tallow, for what they needed in tea, sugar, tobacco,
and clothing, but very little money.</p>
<p>When Sir George Gipps attempted to introduce his district
councils he found the colonists unprepared to travel for miles to
elect a councillor, or pay five or ten pounds per annum for roads
over which they never travelled, and bridges a hundred miles from
their farms, and indignant at suddenly finding their property at
the mercy of the colonial treasurer, the irresponsible officer of
the governor. The colonists determined to resist the district
council scheme. The governor was determined to enforce it. It was
his darling child; he had conceived it while looking out from his
study on the dense population of a different state of society,
and he was not the man to be beaten by circumstances. Like the
Abbé Sièyes, and other celebrated manufacturers of constitutions
and governing machines, he was blind and deaf to all facts which
militated against his theories,&mdash;prepared that everybody
should suffer so long as he maintained his character as a
legislator. Thus he answered a deputation of the Legislative
Council, and other influential colonists, who waited on him to
point out the practical difficulties in the way of executing his
district council scheme: "Whether it ruins the colony or not, an
Act of Parliament must and shall be carried out."</p>
<p>On this question the battle began. The inhabitants, except in
one district, neglected to elect committees. The governor
appointed them. Then came the question of levying, after
assessing, a rate. A flaw was discovered in the Act of
Parliament. It was decided that the word "levy" did not empower
the council to <i>distrain</i>. The governor applied to the
Legislative Council for an Act to amend the flaw. The Legislative
Council refused to help him. He was thrown back on the powers
vested in the colonial treasurer; the "Algerine clause," as it
was called in the colony, he threatened, but he dared not put in
force. The struggle was carried on for years. The governor was
supported by the approval of the home authorities; but the
passive resistance of the colonists was too much for him. At
length, in 1846, Earl Grey called for a report from the principal
officials, including Mr. Deas Thomson, the colonial secretary for
New South Wales, and Mr. Latrobe, the lieutenant-governor of Port
Phillip, and they reported in a manner which effectually, and for
ever, shelved Sir George Gipps' district councils.</p>
<p>In 1844, before the district councils had been shelved, a
select committee of the Legislative Council investigated
"grievances unconnected with land," and drew up a report, which
was a kind of Australian declaration of rights.</p>
<p>These grievances, of which the following is a summary,
remained unredressed until the advent of Sir John Pakington and
the Duke of Newcastle to the Colonial Office opened up
"unrestricted competition" in colonial concessions.</p>
<p>The colonists' committee complained of "being saddled with
taxation for a civil list which they were not empowered to
discuss, to the extent of £81,000." By the Act of 1850 this civil
list was increased.</p>
<p>Of the total failure of the "District Councils, which created
municipalities where the sparse population render popular
election and local taxation impossible, and which placed in the
hands of the governors the nomination of an officer with powers
of taxation."</p>
<p>Of the want of a "responsible government," the governor being,
in fact, merely a subordinate officer of the Colonial Secretary
of State for the time being; and the governor's official advisers
in a position which made them practically as independent of the
Legislative Council as if they had been merely his private
friends. Thus, so long as the governor and his official advisers
satisfied the home authorities, the colonists were without remedy
for any illegality committed by the colonial government, however
flagrant. As an instance of the working of the system, the report
cites £127,000 applied to various illegal (<i>not fraudulent</i>)
purposes by the governor in the course of seven years; "and a sum
of £30,743 15s., which was not only expended by his excellency
without any authority of the Legislative Council, but applied, by
the governor's mere fiat, to the payment of debentures and other
purposes to which the ordinary revenue was not applicable by
law."</p>
<p>They further protested against the expense in police, gaols,
and judicial expenditure inflicted upon the colonists in
consequence of New South Wales being made a receptacle for the
felons of England, after it had ceased to derive the profits of
their labour on the assignment system; and of the violation of
the [alleged] compact by which the surplus land revenues and
other casual revenues of the crown had been ceded to the colonial
treasuries. Under this head the committee claimed a large
sum&mdash;£831,742 3s. 7d., and for the future an annual payment
towards police, gaols, and courts of assize of £74,195 6s.
8d.</p>
<p>And finally, they requested that persons having claims of any
description against the local government should, by special Act
of Parliament, be enabled to sue a public officer as nominal
defendant, and that the judges of the Supreme Court should be
placed in the same position as to tenure of office and security
of salary as the judges of the mother country, and no longer be
liable to be suspended by the fiat and removed by the report of
the governor.</p>
<p>But it would be impossible within any reasonable space to
detail the series of overt acts which characterised the
sedition-breeding policy of Sir George Gipps.</p>
<p>Nominally, a portion of the land revenue was set apart for the
benefit of the aborigines; but when application was made for
curing a native of a dangerous infectious skin disease, the
governor "had no funds for such a purpose," and poor Jemmy Nyrang
was pushed out of the government hospital.</p>
<p>Session after session it was a game at cross purposes and
crooked answers between the representatives of the colonists, the
governor, and his patrons in Downing-street.</p>
<p>For instance, the colonists proposed to reduce the salaries of
certain colonial custom-house officers; in the next session of
the British Parliament, it is presumed at the instigation of
Governor Gipps, the British Colonial Secretary passed a special
Act, taking that department from the control of the newly-created
colonial Parliament. The colonists proposed to spend £9,000 of
their own money in building a lighthouse in Bass's Straits; they
were informed that they must first consult the home government on
its situation&mdash;a matter of two years' delay. The colonists
passed an Act, establishing mortgage and register for mortgages
on wool; the Colonial Secretary of State, without consulting the
colonists, disallowed the Act, as "repugnant to the laws of
England." See p. 164. But after long delay and great loss of
property, the home government was obliged to yield and sanction a
measure indispensable in a pastoral country. The colonists
examined and unanimously protested against the land system
established by the Imperial Parliament, arid still more
unanimously against the ordinances affecting pastoral occupation.
Lord Stanley, without regarding petitions which, as Sir George
Gipps admitted, expressed the almost unanimous opinions of the
colonists, hastened to pen in a despatch "his determination to
uphold the land system, and his perfect approval of the arbitrary
powers exercised by the governor against the squatting interest."
A bill was introduced into the British Parliament for
establishing the new system of pastoral occupation&mdash;the
ex-governor was consulted&mdash;the Legislative Council were left
in ignorance of the provisions of the bill.</p>
<p>In fact, the records of the Legislative Council are largely
occupied with discussions between the governor and the elected
members on every possible subject, the governor constantly
adopting a line of defiance, always treating the opposition as if
it were rebellion. On the one side were the colonists, on the
other the governor, backed by the home government, concentrating
in his own person all power and patronage, supported by the
official members, and the <i>nominees</i>, who were plainly
instructed that, unless prepared to support the governor, "right
or wrong" (if a governor could be wrong), they must resign.</p>
<p>The ability and integrity of the colonial secretaries of state
during the administration of Sir George Gipps, and of Sir George
himself, are indisputable; but they obstinately insisted on
knowing whether shoes fitted or not better than the people who
wore them, and insisted too, that they should wear them, whether
they pinched or not. Fortunately the prosperity of the colony did
not entirely depend on the crotchets of a colonial minister, or
of a governor, although both could, and did, seriously retard its
progress.</p>
<p>But while the Legislative Council were contesting, inch by
inch, the "elementary rights of Englishmen," the grass was
growing, the sheep were breeding, the stockmen were exploring new
pastures, and the frugal industry of settlers was replacing and
increasing the capital lost by wild speculations. And in 1845-6,
Sir George Gipps was able to announce that the revenue exceeded
the expenditure, and the exports the imports, while the glut of
labour which followed his arrival had been succeeded by a demand
which the squatters termed a <i>dearth</i>.</p>
<p>In July, 1846, Sir George Gipps retired from the government of
New South Wales, and embarked for England, worn out in body and
mind by the excitement of perpetual contests with colonists as
unscrupulous in their attacks as he was obstinate and haughty in
maintaining his opinions and position. It was a war to the knife
on both sides. The last measure he presented to the Legislative
Council (a bill to renew the border police) was rejected, and an
address voted, by a large majority, after two nights' debate,
which was virtually a vote of censure on his government, after
which the council adjourned itself for a month.</p>
<p>During an administration of eight years, distinguished by
unusual official and literary aptitude, Sir George Gipps
succeeded in earning the warm approbation of the Downing-street
chiefs, and the detestation of the members of every colonial
class and interest, except his immediate dependents. The
squatocracy, the mercantile, and the settler class were equally
opposed to him. Yet even with the same political and economical
views, erroneous and baneful as many of them were, with much less
talent, but with a more conciliatory temper, he might have been a
happy, a popular, and a really useful governor. The value, as
well as the popularity, of a colonial governor depends more on
the manner in which he conciliates and advises the people under
his charge, than on the manner in which he pens a despatch or
delivers a speech from the vice-throne.</p>
<p>We have dwelt on Sir George's unhappy career unhappy&mdash;for
himself and for the colony under his charge&mdash;to show what
manner of policy was approved and rewarded by the Colonial Office
of Lord Stanley and Earl Grey, and why discontent has been
chronic in New South Wales for so many years.</p>
<p>Had he been a man of less mark, or a governor of less power,
his faults and foibles should have been buried with him; but
unfortunately they form an important part of the history of the
colony he misgoverned. We may yet have to reap a bitter harvest
from the seeds he sowed. Imperfectly as our task has been
performed, we have said enough to show that his administration
must always be considered one of the most important epochs in the
history of Australia.</p>
<p>The permanent infliction of the £1 an acre monopoly&mdash;the
consequent triumph of the great pastoral over the freehold
interest&mdash;the development of the wonderful pastoral
resources of Australia&mdash;the abolition of assignment and
transportation of criminals&mdash;the rise of a free
population&mdash;the introduction of the elective element into
the legislature&mdash;the commencement of a legitimate
parliamentary struggle for the establishment of responsible
government, and a crowd of events of great local but minor
national importance,&mdash;all these date back to the period
during which Sir George Gipps "reigned and governed too,"
contesting every possible question with the Legislative Council,
with the judges, with the crown land commissioners, with the
clergy of all denominations, with squatters, with settlers, with
every colonist who dared to have any other opinion than the
opinion of the Governor.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV.</h3>
<h4>SONGS OF THE SQUATTERS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Among</span> the "signs of the times" during
Sir George Gipps' government, we notice a decided progress in the
literature of the colony: verse as well as prose of no mean order
was called into existence by the fierce contest between the
colonists and their governor. We give a few extracts from the
colonial newspaper of 1845. They may be received as evidence of
some value by those who do not care to dive into any of the
reports we have quoted on important but not very amusing
questions.</p>
<p align="center">THE BUSHMAN'S COMPLAINT.</p>
<p class="poem"><span class="a">The</span> commissioner bet me a
pony&mdash;I won&mdash;<br>
So he cut off exactly two-thirds of my run;<br>
For he said I was making a fortune too fast,<br>
And profit gained slower the longer would last.<br>
<br>
He remark'd, as devouring my mutton he sat,<br>
That I suffer'd my sheep to grow sadly too fat;<br>
That they wasted the waste land, did prerogative brown<br>
And rebelliously nibbled the <i>droits</i> of the crown;<br>
<br>
That the creek that divided my station in two<br>
Show'd nature design'd that two fees should be due.<br>
Mr. Riddel assured me 'twas paid but for show,<br>
But he kept it and spent it, that's all that I know.<br>
<br>
The commissioner fined me because I forgot<br>
To return an old ewe that was ill of the rot;<br>
And a poor, wry-neck'd lamb that we kept for a pet,<br>
And he said it was treason such things to forget.<br>
<br>
The commissioner pounded my cattle, because<br>
They had mumbled the scrub with their famishing jaws<br>
On the part of the run he had taken away,<br>
And he sold them by auction the cost to defray.<br>
<br>
The Border police were out all the day,<br>
To look for some thieves who had ransack'd my dray;<br>
But the thieves they continued in quiet and peace,<br>
For they robb'd it themselves, had the Border police.<br>
<br>
When the white thieves were gone next the black thieves
appear'd,<br>
My shepherds they waddied, my cattle they spear'd;<br>
But for fear of my license I said not a word;<br>
For I knew it was gone if the government heard.<br>
<br>
The commissioner's bosom with anger was fill'd<br>
Against me because my poor shepherd was kill'd;<br>
So he straight took away the last third of my run,<br>
And got it transferr'd to the name of his son.<br>
<br>
The cattle that had not been sold at the pound,<br>
He took with the run at five shillings all round,<br>
And the sheep the blacks left me at sixpence a head,<br>
And a very good price the commissioner said.<br>
<br>
The governor told me I justly was served;<br>
That commissioners never from duty had swerved;<br>
But that if I'd apply for any more land,<br>
For one pound an acre he'd plenty on hand.</p>

<p class="negindent2">Mivins, a Port Phillipian squatter, has
been bought out of his run. On his road, with his sheep, looking
for a new station, he meets Timmins, an old "lag," who, by
"tipping" the Clerks at the Crown Land Office, has had his run
kept out of the government sales.</p>

Has done the business, Mivins, for my sake;<br>
I tip him very regular, you must know&mdash;<br>
A brace of lambs I send, or else a ewe;<br>
And thus you see it comes about,<br>
That I have not been purchased out.<br></p>
<p class="negindent4"><span class=

you, but wonder how,<br>
Or why, they have got up this blessed row;<br>
The ewes and lambs I am too weak to drive,<br>
And fear I'll bring off very few alive;<br>
The weakest lambs I put upon the dray,<br>
But still I save but few alas the day!<br>
A score of them are dead in yonder spot,<br>
The very finest too of all the lot.<br>

<p class="negindent4"><span class=

call Sydney, I once thought<br>
Was like this town of Melbourne, where we brought<br>
Our wedders oft for sale; so ewes to lambs<br>
Resemblance show, and cubs are like their dams:<br>
But Sydney does this town of ours surpass,<br>
As does the tall white gum the burnt up grass.<br></p>

freedom, which, with some delay,<br>
I did obtain at last; but while away<br>
I saw the swell I mentioned: and I tell you<br>
There are no flies about him, my good fellow;<br>
And when I asked him if I were secure<br>
My run should not be purchased, "To be sure,"<br>
Says he: "Don't be in such a fright;<br>
You pay the tip, and I'll make it all right."<br></p>
<p class="negindent4"><span class=
"a">Mivins</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fortunate old
chap you surely are;<br>
For though the run may seem a little bare,<br>
And dotted over here and there with rock,<br>
Yet still it is sufficient for your stock;<br>
And by the river is so well protected,<br>
There is no danger of its being infected.<br>
But some of us must go to Portland Bay,<br>
Others to Gipps's land or Goulburn way;<br>
Or else to South Australia and the plains<br>
North of the Pyrenees and Grampians.<br>
I wonder if I ever shall again<br>
Behold the spot which once was my domain;<br>
The door against the Bushman never shut,<br>
And the bark covering of my humble hut.<br>
Some half-pay officer will reap my corn,<br>
Some sailor shear my flocks may I be shorn,<br>
If I had thought it would have reach'd this pass,<br>
If ever I'd have been the infernal ass<br>
To build a wool-shed, or to put a rod<br>
Of fencing up, or turn a single sod.<br></p>

you'll spend the night with me,<br>

<blockquote>In 1844 the colony was visited by severe floods. The
water was from four to five feet deep in the township of
Gundagai, which had been laid out and sold in building lots by
the government sometime previously. The Commissioner of Crown
Lands, in the district, addressed a letter to the Colonial
Secretary, Mr. Deas Thomson, suggesting that, "in consequence of
the late floods, it would be highly essential to the future
welfare of the township of Gundagai to have part of the township
laid out on the south bank of the Murrumbidgee River, on
moderately high ground, well adapted for building, giving the
parties who have now allotments in the recently-flooded land
others on the high land." The suggestion of the Crown
Commissioner as to laying out allotments was adopted; but in
conveying this information Mr. Thomson adds:&mdash;"His
Excellency further directs me to inform you that he cannot
sanction the proposed exchange of the flooded allotments, <i>as
he considers that what a man buys he buys for better or
worse</i>." *</blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>
<h4>SIR CHARLES FITZROY.<br>
<br>
1846 TO 1850.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Sir Charles Fitzroy</span>, a younger son of
the Grafton family, and a brother-in-law of the Duke of Richmond,
who had previously been Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward's
Island, and Governor of Antigua, in the West Indies, succeeded
Sir George Gipps in August, 1846; Sir Charles M. O'Connell,
Commander of the Forces in New South Wales, having administered
the colony during the intermediate space of a month.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Fitzroy, who has retained the office with
increased dignity as Governor-General, under the Australian
Reform Bill, is in every respect the reverse of Sir George Gipps.
His talents are not above mediocrity, and his manners are
conciliatory. On colonial politics he has no opinions and no
prejudices; apparently his chief object has been to lead an easy
life. It is said that on landing he exclaimed&mdash;"I cannot
conceive how Sir George Gipps could permit himself to be bored by
anything in this delicious climate." Sir Charles is in fact an
eminent example of how far good temper and the impartiality of
indifference, in the absence of higher qualities, may make a very
respectable colonial governor. By placing himself unreservedly in
the hands of men of colonial experience&mdash;by yielding every
point left to his own discretion by the home government to the
wishes of the majority of the Legislative Council&mdash;and in
fact by never taking the trouble to have any opinion on any
colonial subject, has glided over difficulties on which men of
more intellect and obstinacy would have made shipwreck. And
perhaps, after all, the sporting, four-in-hand driving,
ball-giving governor,</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"A dandy of sixty, who bows with
a grace,"</p>
<p>and leaves the political part of his work to his secretaries
and law advisers, is the best governor for Australia,&mdash;until
some nobleman or great commoner can be found of common sense and
conciliatory manners, not only able to initiate the business of
colonial government with advantage to the dependency and the
parent state, but to teach the rising generation of Australia by
example, that without a taste for art, science, and refined
intellectual amusements, the most fashionable tailor, the most
correct equipage, the most beautiful horses, the most stately
mansion, and the most varied wine-cellar, will not make a
gentleman, as colonial plutocrats often fancy.</p>
<p>The Earl of Derby (then Lord Stanley) had held the seals of
the Colonial Office during nearly the whole period of Sir George
Gipps's government, and heartily sustained him in all his
needless and despotic assertions of royal prerogative. He had
earned, too, considerable personal unpopularity by disallowing
several important acts of the Legislative Council, by the
exercise of his patronage in an arbitrary manner in favour of
very improper objects, and by a general course of conduct both
negligent and defiant. In 1845 Lord Stanley resigned, and was
succeeded by the Right Hon. William Gladstone, who retired with
Sir Robert Peel's government in June, 1846.</p>
<h5>THE ANTI-CONVICT CONTEST.</h5>
<p>Transportation to New South Wales had been discontinued in
1840, in consequence of the report of a committee of the House of
Commons made in 1838. The class of convicts who had previously
been distributed over New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land as
assigned servants, following agricultural and pastoral
occupations, were all poured into the island of Van Diemen's
Land, and there massed into what were called probation gangs.
Without separate cells or trustworthy gaolers, they festered into
the foulest community that ever poisoned the population of a
civilised state.</p>
<p>The gentlemen of the House of Commons who forced the sudden
abolition of the assignment system on the government, were the
cat's-paws of certain South Australian and New Zealand
land-jobbers. By a <i>coup de main</i> they compelled the
government to do that in a day which required the preparation of
years. For the consequent mistakes and failures which occurred
between 1840 and 1845 the Colonial Office is scarcely answerable.
The experiment was new; it was suddenly forced upon them by a
powerful political combination, and at that period the means of
obtaining authentic information from the colonies were few and
far between.</p>
<p>In 1845 Mr. Secretary Gladstone's attention was directed to
two serious facts in regard to convictism. On the one hand the
gang and probation system in Van Diemen's Land had produced a
state of crime and danger fatal to the progress of the whole
colony, which could no longer remain unnoticed. On the other, on
the rich pastoral plains of the Port Phillip district the
increase of flocks and herds had been so rapid as to place the
proprietary of squatting runs in great difficulties for want of
labourers; and they had consequently formed an association, made
a subscription, and imported about two thousand expirees and
ticket-of-leave holders from Van Diemen, to supply their urgent
demand for pastoral servants. With a view of controlling these
whitewashed criminals, the Legislature of New South Wales (which
until 1850 extended over Port Phillip) proposed to subject the
Van Diemonian importations to a system of registration and
surveillance similar to that to which the ticket-of-leave men
were subjected who had originally been sentenced to New South
Wales.</p>
<p>The home government declined to sanction a colonial
legislative act, which would have made such a registration
legal.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* One of the first acts of the Legislative
Assemblies created by the Australian Reform Bill of 1850, was to
pass similar acts levelled against Van Diemonian expirees.]</p>
<p>But although pastoral proprietors, anxious to preserve and
multiply their fleecy treasures, were willing to accept the
services of convicts, just as some of them had endeavoured to
introduce Feejee cannibals, by a new slave trade, and Pagan
Chinese, there was a large free population in the towns of
Australia which was satisfied to depend on free emigrants for the
supply of labour, and determined to resist the return to
convictism. With the educated and wealthy opponents of white
slavery were banded the labouring classes, who naturally were
just as anxious to keep wages up as their employers were to keep
them down.</p>
<p>It was then&mdash;in the commencement of a contest between
that portion of the population resident in towns or engaged in
agriculture, which, on moral and political grounds, objected to
the renewal of transportation, backed by the labouring classes,
who were equally averse to the reduction of wages and to the
vexatious police regulations incident to the system of prisoner
labour which affected all labouring men, and the squatters, to
whom cheap and obedient labour was essential if they were to
retain their wealthy and dominant position while the respective
parties had scarcely marshalled their forces, that a despatch
arrived from Mr. Gladstone, in which he requested the governor
"to submit to the consideration of the council whether they would
not accept, in part supply of the labour market, a renewal of a
modified system of transportation." Mr. Gladstone had already
determined to discontinue transportation to Van Diemen's Land for
two years, pending the arrangement of a better system; and also
to found, on northern Australia, a new penal settlement.</p>
<p>On the 13th of October a committee of the Legislative Council
was appointed, on the motion of Mr. Went worth, which contained,
of ten members, five squatters and two colonial officials.</p>
<p>The first act of this committee was to meet and decide that it
was not expedient at that late period of the session to take any
evidence as to the question in Mr. Gladstone's
letter&mdash;"Whether a modified and carefully-regulated
introduction of convict labourers will be in accordance with the
general sense of the colony." Accordingly they confined their
labours to inquiring from the employers of labour whether they
would like a renewal of transportation&mdash;that is to say,
cheap labour&mdash;they were unanimously answered in the
affirmative, provided the transportation was accompanied with
certain precautions which they mentioned&mdash;and inquiring from
the police magistrates in what manner and on what terms such
transportation ought to be renewed. Although while the committee
was sitting, a number of petitions against the renewal of
transportation were presented, no witnesses holding the opinions
of the petitioners were examined.</p>
<p>Among other witnesses called was Captain J. Innes, stipendiary
magistrate at the convict barracks, and superintendent of
irongangs, a gentleman whose office and position alike secured
him from any sentimental terror of convictism, and induced him to
acquiesce as much as possible in the views of those home
authorities from whom he received his appointment. But Captain
Innes only ventured to propose, as the terms on which the colony
should consent to receive a limited number of prisoners, "that
the colonial government should have the power of settling the
rules for the management and discipline of the prisoners;" "that
the home government should pay half the police, and gaol, and
administration of justice expenditure, the cost of the penal
establishments in the colony, and send out one male and one
female immigrant for each prisoner and all the female convicts,
so as to keep a parity of sexes."</p>
<p>From the same evidence we learn that at that period (1846)
there were about fifteen hundred old convicts "the very worst
class of men imaginable" still remaining in the gangs and gaols;
and that in the colony there were 13,400 ticket-of-leave holders.
The committee reported, too late for the council to take their
recommendations into consideration, to the following
effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>They commence by observing that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"They are sufficiently cognizant of the state of
public feeling among their fellow-colonists to be satisfied that
if the proposed renewal of transportation were any longer
practically and substantially an open question; if it rested on
the colonists themselves to decide whether the deportation of
convicts <i>to this hemisphere</i> should cease or
continue&mdash;whether they should at once and for ever free
themselves and their posterity from the further taint of the
convict system, doubtless a large majority, especially of the
operative classes, would give the proposal for renewed
transportation an unhesitating veto; nor do your committee feel
by any means certain that the decision of the majority of the
upper and middle classes of society would now also be in
accordance with the report of the General Grievance Committee of
1844, 'that the moral and social influences of the convict
system, the contamination and the vice which are inseparable from
it, are evils for which no mere pecuniary benefits could serve as
a counterpoise;' and if the Secretary of State be prepared to
discontinue the transportation of the convicts of the British
empire to all of the Australian colonies, and thus practically as
well as nominally free this continent from their presence, such a
course would be more generally 'conducive to the interests, and
agreeable to the inclinations of those whom it will ultimately
concern.' Seeing, however, that in the view of your committee,
transportation is no longer an open question&mdash;that
transportation is still to go on to Van Diemen's
Land&mdash;seeing, moreover, that a new penal settlement is
immediately to be formed on the very northern boundary of the
colony&mdash;that thus this colony, already inundated on the
south with the outpourings of the probation system in Van
Diemen's Land, the most demoralising that ever was invented, is
soon to have poured upon it from the north the exiles of the
mother country, as well as the expirees from that colony; and
that to augment the volume of this double stream of felonry, a
system of conditional pardons, confining the holders of them
practically to the Australian colonies, has been resorted to,
with the effect of relieving the British treasury from the cost
of maintaining this <i>class of criminals in reality, although
free men in name</i>: seeing this, your committee consider the
question narrowed down to whether transportation should exist in
the indirect and polluted shape which it has already assumed;
whether, in short, we are to have this double tide of moral
contamination flowing upon us without restraint or check; or
whether, along with whatever compensation transportation can be
surrounded, <i>we are to have the additional advantage of
modifying and regulating its introduction into the colony by the
knowledge which fifty years' experience of its working has given
us</i>, which will at all events enable us to combine with the
greatest possible good derivable from it, the least possible
admixture of evil."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The committee, after arguing in a very forcible manner against
anything in the nature of probation gangs or other aggregation of
criminals, "whether for the execution of public works generally,
or making and repair of roads," proceed to report&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"As a mere choice of evils, which, whatever may be
the general desire, this community has no power to escape from,
<i>we are willing to submit to a renewal of transportation</i>
upon the following terms, and <i>upon no other</i>:&mdash;<br>
<br>
"1st. That no alteration shall be made in the Constitutional Act,
5 and 6 Vict. c. 76, except with the view to the extension of the
elective principle.<br>
<br>
"2nd. That the transportation of male convicts be accompanied, as
a simultaneous measure, with the importation of an equal number
of females, to consist of female convicts as far as they exist,
and the balance to be made up of female immigrants.<br>
<br>
"3rd. That, as a further simultaneous measure, such
transportation be accompanied with an equal importation of free
immigrants, as nearly as possible in equal proportions as to
sexes.<br>
<br>
"4th. That the wives and families of all convicts receiving
permanent or temporary indulgences should be brought out, and
count as part of this free immigration.<br>
<br>
"5th. That no fewer than five thousand male convicts be annually
deported.<br>
<br>
"6th. That the ironed or road gangs of criminals under colonial
sentence, and the convict establishments of Norfolk Island and
Cockatoo Islands should be maintained as heretofore at the cost
of the British treasury.<br>
<br>
"7th. That two-thirds of the expense of police, gaols, and the
criminal administration of justice be paid by the home
government; but that on the relinquishment of the land fund and
all other revenues or <i>droits</i> of the crown to the
appropriation of the governor and Legislative Council, the whole
of this branch of convict expenditure be assumed by the colony,
with a view to aid the British government in defraying the cost
of the free emigration stipulated for in the second and third
conditions.<br>
<br>
"8th. That in order to insure due permanency and efficiency in
the regulations to be provided for the government and discipline
of convicts, the sole power of making such regulations be vested
in the governor and Legislative Council, saving entire the royal
prerogative of mercy.<br>
<br>
"The description of convicts the colony should agree to receive
on the above conditions are&mdash;<br>
<br>
"1st. Young delinquents who have committed first
offences&mdash;to be sent after little or no probation.<br>
<br>
"2nd. Convicts who have committed grave offences, after a
probation, under the separate system, considered adequate to the
crime.<br>
<br>
"3rd. Convicts at the commencement of their sentences who have
committed various crimes.<br>
<br>
"4th. Convicts with tickets of leave (if any) from Van Diemen's
Land.<br>
<br>
"The committee recommend that&mdash;<br>
<br>
"The two first classes receive tickets of leave entitling the
holders to dwell in some particular district, altogether
excluding them from towns.<br>
<br>
"The third class to be assigned in the nineteen counties in which
pastoral pursuits were most followed and the squatting districts,
to parties into whose character rigid inquiry had been
made."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The committee express a preference for assignment over
probation for the second class.</p>
<p>With respect to the Van Diemonian ticket-of-leave men, the
committee state that they would rather not receive them at all,
but that a system of granting conditional pardons very
indiscriminately having been very extensively practised, they
would prefer receiving men subject to registry muster and the
surveillance of the police, to receiving them without any
restraint at all.</p>
<p>In another part of their report the committee observe, "The
secret to disarm transportation of its evil influences is to
increase the free population," that it may always maintain a
decided ascendancy, and to keep up the equality of the sexes,
that the colony may never more be subjected to the horrors of a
<i>populus virorum</i>."</p>
<p>It seems that at that period the males of the colony were
114,000 to 74,000 females.</p>
<p>The committee conclude with an eloquent peroration, no doubt
the work of their accomplished chairman, on the beneficial
results to be anticipated from their recommendations.</p>
<p>This report having been issued too late to be discussed by the
Legislative Council, was forwarded by the government to the
Colonial Office, and fell into the hands of Mr. Gladstone's
successor, Earl Grey.</p>
<h5>EARL GREY.</h5>
<p>Sir Charles Fitzroy, warned by the error of Governor Gipps, in
his first address to the Legislative Council, assured them that
he should defer any legislative action on his own part until he
made such a stay and such investigations as were "necessary to
acquire personal experience upon several momentous questions upon
which it would be presumptuous to offer any opinion at so early a
period of our intercourse;" and he added: "I take this
opportunity of publicly declaring, in perfect sincerity, that I
have assumed the responsible trust with which our Sovereign has
honoured me, <i>unfettered by any preconceived opinions</i> on
every subject affecting the interests of any class of her
Majesty's subjects in this territory."</p>
<p>Among the important subjects affected by this timely and
sagacious declaration stood foremost the renewal of
transportation; the upset price of crown lands; the terms on
which those lands were to be temporarily occupied by pastoral
proprietors; the control and appropriation of the colonial
revenues; and the establishment of steam communication.</p>
<p>On all these and many other colonial subjects, as we learn
from a work recently published by the noble earl, Lord Grey had
fully made up his mind, with that instinctive intuition peculiar
to those who are "swaddled, and rocked, and dandled into
legislators."</p>
<p>And here we must pause in tracing the progress of the
transportation question to describe the minister who has had so
large a share in alienating the affections of the Australian
colonists from the mother country, and in elevating into patriots
of the hour those unprincipled agitators who found, to their
infinite satisfaction, in the anti-transportation cry the means
of preaching sedition.</p>
<p>Lord Grey, as Lord Howick in the House of Commons, early
became a convert to the brilliant plausibilities of Gibbon
Wakefield's land theory. He took an active part in the South
Australian Committee of 1841, and in 1845 he vehemently supported
the attack made in Committee arid in Parliament on Lord Stanley
and Sir Robert Peel's government by the New Zealand Company, and
had a large share in securing to that corporation a renewed lease
of the powers they exercised so injuriously to the interests of
their shareholders and their colonists.</p>
<p>On his accession to the Colonial Office his first step was to
break up the colony contemplated by Mr. Gladstone in Northern
Australia.</p>
<p>In reply to Sir Charles Fitzroy, Earl Grey declined to accede
to any of the conditions suggested by the Transportation
Committee, except that which stipulated for the emigration at the
expense of the mother country of a number of free emigrants equal
in number to the convicts sent; but he suspended any action until
the decision of the Legislative Council should be pronounced.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Legislative Council, in the session of
1847, had considered Mr. Went worth's report and rejected it.</p>
<p>In the same year Earl Grey wrote to the Governor of Tan
Diemen's Land, Sir William Denison, "that it was not the
intention of her Majesty's government that transportation to Van
Diemen's Land should be resumed at the expiration of the two
years for which it has already been decided that it should be
discontinued." The Governor, Sir William Denison, took the
sentence in its literal sense, and announced the good news in
terms which caused general rejoicing. But although it appeared in
the sequel that Earl Grey had never meant to discontinue
transportation, but only to have convicts on the shores of Van
Diemen's Land as exiles&mdash;that is to say, convicted emigrants
or ticket-of-leave men, instead of concentrating crime in
probation gangs,&mdash;he took no measures to disabuse, to
correct the mistaken reading of the governor, until the time came
when transportation was openly renewed. In actual fact, although
the number of criminals sent to Van Diemen's Land was diminished,
transportation never was discontinued during the proposed two
years, but prisoners who had passed through a course of penal
discipline in English gaols were landed and almost immediately
set at liberty, either as exiles or "ticket-of-leavers," to the
extent of 3,154 between 1846 and 1848.</p>
<p>The despatch from Sir William Denison, informing the Colonial
Office that he had announced the abolition of transportation to
Van Diemen's Land, and that to revive it in any form would be a
breach of faith, was received at the Colonial Office on the 5th
February, 1848. The receipt was acknowledged by Earl Grey, by a
despatch on the 27th April, 1848, in which, without reprimanding
the governor for the since-alleged misconstruction of the
despatch, which seemed to announce that transportation was to be
discontinued, he thanked the governor for his valuable
information, and, without preamble, announced that prisoners
would be sent out with tickets of leave. From that period,
without interruption up to the present time, the free colonists
of Van Diemen's Land have never ceased to agitate and protest
against the system, with such unanimity that at the first general
election under the new constitution no single member was returned
who did not pledge himself to resist to the uttermost the
continuance of transportation; and this in the face of opposition
from candidates who were supported by all the influence of a
government expending upwards of £100,000 a year.</p>
<p>It is quite true, as Earl Grey states in the apology for the
failure of his colonial policy, which he has lately addressed to
the (colonial) ignorance of the British public, that there were
gentlemen in Van Diemen's Land who, sharing the patronage of the
government, openly approved of this wholesale transportation. It
is extraordinary, with so large a government expenditure among a
community so limited, its supporters were not more numerous, and
it is equally true that there were always employers to be found
willing to engage the cheap labour provided by ships laden with
"ticket-of-leavers." But cheap labour will always find customers,
whatever the quality or morality. The pest and crime-breeding
cottages of Dorsetshire, denounced by the Rev. Sidney Godolphin
Osborne&mdash;the seven-shilling-a-week life, with a workhouse
burial, as the goal of Wiltshire labourers&mdash;the employment
of women in mines, and the unlimited hours of labour in
factories, have, in turn, met with apologists as well as
supporters. So in Van Diemen's Land, those who fertilised their
lands or derived wealth from the moral cesspool approved it, and
not unwillingly saw it overflow the neighbouring colony.</p>
<p>A key to the unpopularity which in Australia attended Earl
Grey's administration of the Colonial Office, may be found in the
communications which passed between certain elective members of
the Legislative Council of New South Wales, who were chosen a
corresponding committee, and the parliamentary agent or
representative of the colony, the Hon. Francis Scott, M.P., from
which we shall presently make some extracts.</p>
<p>But as regards transportation, in 1848, the Legislative
Council received some accession of strength from the squatter
party; the colony was in straits from the cessation of
immigration, which had fallen from some six thousand in 1842 to
barely three thousand two hundred during the whole five years of
1843, 1844, 1845, 1846, and 1847, and ventured to pass a
resolution assenting to a proposition made by Earl Grey, by which
he undertook to forward a certain number of criminals who had
passed through a course of discipline in British penitentiaries,
to be landed with tickets of leave; and further to accompany
their immigration with that of an equal number of free emigrants
to be sent, not at the cost of the Colonial Land Fund, but of the
British Exchequer.</p>
<p>The passing of this resolution was the signal for the
organisation of a fierce agitation against the renewal of
transportation, which was kept alive by the arrival from time to
time of small bands of felons under the new name of exiles.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Fitzroy's despatch, enclosing Mr. Wentworth's
resolution in favour of the renewal of transportation, reached
England in August, 1848.</p>
<p>The financial state of the country deterred the English
government from proposing the vote needful for defraying the
expenses of the free emigrants promised to the colony, in
consideration of their receiving convicts. Had the compromise
been strictly fulfilled by Earl Grey, and accompanied by such
measures as would have prevented the convicts from remaining in
towns to compete with free labourers, it is possible that
convictism might have been endured for some years longer; at any
rate until the discovery of gold rendered transportation to
Australia absurd as a punishment. But Earl Grey, in a defiance of
public opinion in the colonies, as exhibited in a crowd of
petitions, resolutions, and reports of public meetings forwarded
to him, as well as in the universal tone of the colonial
newspapers, adopted that part of the bargain which suited the
mother country, and neglected to fulfil the colonial conditions
on which the concession was made. He decided to send out
prisoners but no free emigrants&mdash;revoked the order in
council of 1840, by which New South Wales had ceased to be a
place for the reception of convicts&mdash;and commenced to send
out the pets of Pentonville and Parkhurst.</p>
<p>The publication of this despatch in the colony was received
with one universal outburst of indignation. A passage at the
conclusion of the communication, in which Sir C. Fitzroy was told
that "if the Legislative Council should object to receive
convicts without free immigration at the expense of the home
government according to the stipulation of the compromise, the
transmission of convicts would be stopped, and application made
to parliament for the means of fulfilling the originaj promise,"
was considered as approaching insult, because it was evident
that-during at least nearly twelve months between the penning of
that despatch to the receipt of an answer, transportation must
flow on. From that time compromise was impossible; the breach of
faith became a potent rhetorical weapon in the hands of political
agitators. The excitement and fury of all parties was such, that
it only needed the presence of an obstinate and haughty governor
to provoke a rebellious outburst. Fortunately Governor Fitzroy
preferred a pleasant day on the race-course to any assertion of
vice-royal attributes.</p>
<p>In 1849, the <i>Hashemy</i> convict-ship arrived in Sydney
harbour. At one of the largest public meetings ever held in that
city, speeches of the most violent character were delivered, and
resolutions passed, calling upon the governor to send back the
cargo of England's crimes to England. At the same time certain of
the great flockowners&mdash;the political Buckinghams and
Newdegates of the colony&mdash;eagerly engaged the
ticket-of-leave men, tamed somewhat by penitentiary discipline,
and all unencumbered by wives and families, at lower wages, in
preference to a thousand free emigrants, consisting of men,
women, and children, who arrived at the same time.</p>
<p>In the latter end of 1848 the results of distress in England
and famine in Ireland were felt in Australia in the shape of an
inflowing of free emigrants more numerous than had been received
since the frantic mania of 1841; and this was increased to such
an extent in 1849, that little short of thirteen thousand
labouring people were landed in Sydney, and an equal number at
Port Phillip. An addition of many thousand free emigrants to the
population could not fail to produce an effect on the
anti-transportation feelings of the colony. It is self-evident
that when emigrants begin to flock freely into a colony, the
period for employing convict labour has passed.</p>
<p>In 1849, the Legislative Council answered Earl Grey's
extraordinary reading of the compromise offered him in 1848, by
voting an address to the Queen in which they protested against
the adoption of any measure by which the colony would be degraded
into a penal settlement, "and entreated her Majesty to revoke the
order in Council by which New South Wales had been again made a
place to which British offenders may be transported." That in
this address they only echoed the feelings of the great majority
of the colonists was proved in the next election, when gentlemen
with the highest claims to the honours of Legislation were
rejected on the one ground of having supported the transportation
compromise.</p>
<p>Earl Grey, in his recent apology for his colonial policy,
treats this absolute reversal of the compromise previously
offered as something marvellously inconsistent, if not
unprincipled: his own "error of judgment" in sending the poison
without the antidote, he treats very lightly.</p>
<p>But Earl Grey writes like a man whose political position and
still more his tone of mind remove him altogether from those
influences which affect popular assemblies. During his official
career he had no constituents; no equal cared, no subordinate
dared, to controvert his fixed ideas on all colonial subjects;
and when colonists ventured in deputation to urge unpleasant
arguments, we have ourselves witnessed with what impassive,
incredulous sternness he bowed them out!</p>
<p>Earl Grey takes some pains to marshal the respective elements
of the pro and anti-transportation parties; he performs his task
in a manner which reminds one of the instruction for a brief
given, according to an old circuit story, by an attorney to his
new clerk&mdash;"our client, the plaintiff, is a most respectable
baker, the defendant is a rascally cheesemonger."</p>
<p>And so Earl Grey declares, that the "minority in favour of the
renewal of transportation included no small proportion of the
most intelligent and enterprising members of society," whilst the
majority against included not only those "who sincerely
entertained the repugnance they professed on moral grounds, but a
great number of the labouring classes who were influenced by
jealousy of the competition of convicts, and a fear that their
coming might lead to a reduction of the extravagant wages they
had been in the habit of obtaining. Others, again, for personal
or electioneering objects, thought it their interest to excite
popular passions. The anti-transportation party in the interval
since the subject was previously considered in the Legislative
Council gained the ascendancy, assisted in no small degree by the
diminished urgency of the demand for labour, in consequence of
the large free emigration." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Colonial Policy, by Earl Grey, vol. 2, p.
47.]</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that the dearth of labour which had
prevailed in previous years, was owing entirely to Earl Grey's
refusal to adopt the measures pressed upon him by "the most
intelligent and enterprising colonists," and that the supply of
labour was due, not to his commissioners, but to the English
distress and Irish famine. But in order that those not conversant
with colonial affairs may not be imposed upon by the strenuous
efforts of Lord Grey to extenuate a course of policy which, if
pardonable in a novice, is quite unpardonable in a statesman, we
venture on the following parallel passage from English
History:&mdash;</p>
<p>An administration, of which Earl Grey formed one, offered to
compromise the corn-law question by offering an 8s. duty. That
offer was rejected by the agricultural interest in 1842; while in
1848 nothing less than the total and immediate abolition would
satisfy those who would once willingly have accepted the 8s.
compromise, those who in 1842 had rejected it disdainfully would
have been only too willing to accept it. In the same way the
party who carried the repeal of the corn laws, was composed of
some who sincerely approved of it on moral and political grounds,
others who were chiefly moved by the prospect of increased trade,
and others who saw in the movement personal and political
advantages and the way to the enjoyment of extravagant official
salaries.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* We do not consider that the secretaries of
state are by any means extravagantly paid, but it is very likely
that a colonist might. And we do not agree-with Earl Grey that
the wages of colonial labourers are to be measured by a
Northumberland standard, for what is extravagant in England is
moderate in a new country.]</p>
<p>It would be difficult to find two passages in cotemporary
history more alike. When Earl Grey reads colonial events with
such singular one-sidedness, it is not surprising that he did not
observe that the party in favour of the renewal of transportation
was composed of those whose income would be increased by hundreds
and thousands per annum by a reduction of the price of labour to
£16 per annum&mdash;who would never be brought in contact with
the convict element&mdash;who could afford free butlers and
ladies' maids&mdash;whose sons would not associate and whose
daughters would not be entrapped into marriage with Pentonville
exiles or ticket-of-leavers.</p>
<p>The obnoxious order in council making New South Wales a penal
colony was, after a brief contest, withdrawn, but the seed of
agitation had been sown, the anti-transportation league,
embracing all the Australian colonies and Van Diemen's Land, had
been organised. The gold discoveries proved to every one, except
to the son and heir of the great man who carried the Reform Bill,
that transportation was not only odious to the colonists but
absurd as a punishment. Within the present year it has been
abolished by the Duke of Newcastle. But Earl Grey, like his
countryman, the gallant Whittington, still fights upon his
stumps, and endeavours to perpetuate the bitter dislike with
which his official career was regarded in the colonies, by
proclaiming that as regards Van Diemen's Land he would not, had
he continued in power, have yielded to either gold or agitation;
nay, more, that he would have created the Moreton Bay district
into a separate colony for the express purpose of enabling the
squatters&mdash;whom his land policy has fixed in possession of
that fine country to the exclusion of yeomanry&mdash;to accept
the convicts whom the colonists on the whole line of coast
eastward have agreed in rejecting.</p>
<p>Such are the leading facts of the Anti-Transportation
Question, one of several which formed the subjects of bitter
contest between the colonists and Earl Grey during the
administration of Governor Fitzroy. Of the seeds of distrust,
almost of sedition, then sown, we fear we have not yet seen the
full fruit.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII.</h3>
<h4>CORRESPONDENCE WITH PARLIAMENTARY AGENT.</h4>
<p><span class="a">We</span> are enabled to obtain a good idea of
the state of public opinion on all the important points which
formed the subject of discussion between the Colonial Office and
the colonists during-Sir Charles Fitzroy's administration, by
turning to the correspondence which took place between a
committee of the Legislative Council, named as the Corresponding
Committee, over which the Speaker of the Council presided, and
Mr. Francis Scott, M.P.</p>
<p>So early as 1844 the Legislative Council, in the height of
their contest with the Governor and Colonial Secretary of State
on "the grievances connected with crown lands," turned their
attention to the propriety of securing the services, as paid
agent, of some member of the British Parliament, who would fill
for New South Wales the post occupied by Edmund Burke, as
representative of the State of New York, before the breaking out
of the War of Independence.</p>
<p>With this view the late Mr. Benjamin Boyd, who was urging with
indefatigable energy and zeal the cause of his brother squatters
in England, selected the Hon. Francis Scott, M.P., brother of
Lord Polwarth, a barrister, a director of the South-Western
Railway, a Conservative of very decided Protestant and
Protectionist views, with a good political connection among his
party, and industrious business habits. But when the scheme was
laid before Lord Stanley, the Colonial Minister, he declined to
give it his sanction unless the Council would consent that
one-third of the Committee of Correspondence should consist of
nominee members&mdash;that is to say, in the same proportion as
the council. To this the elective councillors would by no means
agree, and the official appointment of Mr. Scott, and his salary,
remained in abeyance, with many other questions of greater
importance; but in the meantime Mr. Scott exerted himself with
considerable success to oppose the bill prepared by Lord Stanley,
on the information of Sir George Gipps, for settling the tenure
of pastoral lands, and entered into a correspondence, from which
we make the following extracts.</p>
<p>In a letter addressed by Mr. F. Scott to the Speaker of the
Legislative Council, dated 30th June, 1846, he refers to "the
small amount of attention which colonial questions command in
parliament," and adds "two more examples to one given in a
previous letter," in the fact that twice the House of Commons had
been counted out when he had motions standing for considering the
subject of emigration. So that at that time it was impossible to
find forty members willing to listen to Mr. Scott, on a question
vitally affecting an important colony.</p>
<p>He then goes on to state that he had ascertained that the bill
for the regulation of waste lands of Australia, laid on the table
of the House of Lords by Lord Lyttleton, the under-secretary of
the recently-appointed secretary, Mr. Gladstone, was
substantially the same as one which had been printed the previous
session, laid on the table of the House of Commons, and sent out
to the colonies. He observes&mdash;"After a year's deliberation,
after ascertaining the opinions of the colonists to be opposed to
the measure, it is a matter of deep regret that the government
should introduce the same bill to settle a question of vital
importance, which it leaves more unsettled than ever." Then he
adds these remarkable words coming from a Conservative of the old
school: "I am not aware that the opinions of any one in this
country connected with New South Wales, or of any one in the
colony except his Excellency Sir George Gipps, were either
ascertained or asked for. So that it would appear that the
transmission of a bill by the government in this country for the
consideration of a colony with a Legislative Council as a
<i>deliberative assembly, is little more than its transmission to
the colony for the signature of the colonial governor without the
council. The bill seems to be framed rather in accordance with
the observations of the land and emigration commissioners than
with a view to the interests of the Australian public</i>."</p>
<p>The principle of the bill protested against was to maintain
the high price of land, and to retain the land until sold in the
hands of the crown, to be rented to tenants at will, or on short
leases, as in Turkey and Egypt, on such terms as would have left
the fortune of every pastoral proprietor in the hands of the
governor or his subordinates.</p>
<p>Eventually Mr. Scott was able to organise an opposition among
the aristocratic and wealthy relatives of the squatters&mdash;the
Elliots, the Trevylyans, the Edens&mdash;more formidable than had
been anticipated. Among the other questions he was instructed to
urge was the concession of the control of the casual revenues of
the colony&mdash;claimed by the council and refused by Sir George
Gipps; and assistance for establishing steam
communication&mdash;a subject which had occupied the council
since 1845.</p>
<p>Earl Grey commenced auspiciously by ceding the point as to the
casual revenues. On the land question he adhered to the opinions
of his preceptor in the art of colonisation, Gibbon Wakefield,
and addressed a despatch to Sir Charles Fitzroy, containing a
report prepared by his obedient, sympathising subordinates, the
Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners, the tenor of which
may be gathered from the colonial documents we are about to
quote.</p>
<p>In July, 1847, Sir Charles Nicholson, as chairman of the
committee of correspondence, addressed a letter to Mr. Scott, in
which, after recapitulating the circumstances under which the
correspondence had commenced in 1845, and the discussion with
Lord Stanley; the passing of a bill in September, 1846, for
appointing Mr. Scott agent for three years at a salary of £500 a
year; the reservation of that bill "for the signification of her
Majesty's pleasure," "in consequence of the terms of Lord
Stanley's despatch;" the absolute refusal of the council to
submit to the "unconstitutional" terms suggested by Lord Grey as
to the composition of the committee; the passing of a vote for
£1,000 toward two years' salary of the agent; and acknowledging
the receipt of several letters, including the one already quoted,
Sir Charles Nicholson proceeds to observe that "the provisions of
the Australian Land Bill" introduced by Lord Stanley in July 18,
1845, "were <i>framed in utter disregard of the
repeatedly-expressed opinions and votes of this council</i>. The
vesting the executive with enormous and all but uncontrolled
powers, in order to carry out its provisions; the reservation to
the crown of the right of sole appropriation of the revenue
derivable from the waste lands, and the continuance of the high
upset price, are the most prominent, though not the only
objections which characterise Lord Stanley's bill." He
continues:&mdash;"Many of the objections urged against the bill
brought in by Lord Stanley, apply with equal force to that of
Earl Grey&mdash;"<i>The most prominent of the evils with which
this measure is defaced is the continuance of the hiah upset mice
of land</i>."</p>
<p>As we have before observed, Lord Grey was early a convert to
the "sufficient price theory." In 1841, when, by the influence of
the South Australian and New Zealand speculators, the committee
on South Australian Insolvency reported on permanently fixing the
price of land by Act of Parliament at £1 an acre, they came to
this conclusion, without examining any colonial evidence, on the
strength of a case carefully and ingeniously prepared and filled
up by the evidence of the two principal witnesses, Mr. Gibbon
Wakefield and Colonel Torrens. In that committee Lord Grey, then
Lord Howick, proposed, although he did not succeed in carrying, a
resolution to the effect that the price of land in Australia
should never be less than 2 an acre, and that it should be from
time to time increased in price until the want of labour, and the
high price of labour then experienced, should be diminished.</p>
<p>It is quite clear that at that time he believed the price of
land regulated the price of labour; and, considering the
influences brought to bear upon them, he might fairly be excused
for so believing. But in the five years which had elapsed since
1841, although a series of reports&mdash;to which we have already
referred in Chapter XI.&mdash;from the Legislative Council,
supported by a mass of evidence, had disproved the advantages
anticipated, it seems that Earl Grey had either never read or
totally disregarded the colonial authorities, and steadfastly
adhered to his first impressions; for in Nov., 1846, he had
addressed a despatch to Sir Charles Fitzroy, in which, "in
justification of the policy pursued by Parliament in prohibiting
the sale below its present price," he "recalled to recollection
the grounds upon which that policy was originally adopted, and so
far he considered that it ought to be chiefly adhered to. And he
referred to the despatches of Lord Ripon," where the expediency
of abolishing the system of free grants, and substituting one of
sales by auction, at a uniform price, is stated, and the example
afforded by the failure of Swan River is cited.</p>
<p>It would not now answer any useful purpose to quote this
despatch at any length, especially as the contents may be
gathered from the criticisms contained in the letter from which
we are quoting.</p>
<p>The speaker observes, first, "That neither the council nor the
colony have ever proposed to revert to the new grant system.
Secondly, that Lord Ripon's system was 5s. an acre and not £1;
that £1 an acre had only produced £57,104, while the low upset
price had produced £680,000. Thirdly, that sales at 5s. an acre
had abated the evil of free grants. Fourthly, that the answer to
Earl Grey's argument, 'that value will be eventually given to the
land by the application of the proceeds of sales to emigration,'
is, that purchasers cannot be found at the price. Fifthly, that
the idea of concentrating-population by affixing a high upset
price is signally defeated in the practical working of the
system; for as all persons settling can only afford to settle as
graziers, they migrate to distant parts of the interior colony.
Thus the system increases dispersion."</p>
<p>But these arguments produced no effect on the impassive and
perfectly self-contented mind of Earl Grey; nor did a more
elaborate report made in the same year, to which we shall
presently advert; for we find in 1853, that, in exact imitation
of Gibbon Wakefield in 1850, Earl Grey published his "Colonial
Policy," and there, in the very words of his despatch of 1846,
urged the same arguments on the land question, with the same
example of Swan Elver, without appearing conscious of the
contradicting facts above quoted, which had been so repeatedly
pressed upon his attention.</p>
<p>In the same letter it is announced that in 1846 the
Legislative Council had agreed to make a contribution of £6,000 a
year for three years toward promoting steam navigation, or about
one-third of the estimated cost. The gold discoveries of 1851
found the colony no further advanced toward steam communication
than 1846.</p>
<p>In a second letter, dated the 1st October, 1847, we find the
following passage:&mdash;"Intelligence has reached the colony
indirectly through various channels, that Earl Grey has under
consideration the establishment of constitutions for the
Australian colonies upon a new scheme, allied to that framed for
New Zealand. The mere suggestion of any such constitution, <i>in
which district councils appear to be the predominant element</i>,
being fastened upon us has excited general dismay. Should our
apprehensions prove well founded in this matter, it will afford
another and striking instance of the injustice of which we have
not unfrequently to complain, of being made the subject of great
and important changes through the medium of Parliament without
any reference to ourselves, or any consultation with those best
qualified to form an accurate judgment of our social and
political wants."</p>
<p>From these extracts it will be seen that the first intimation
of the accession of Earl Grey to office was accompanied with
ample cause for distrust, which he lost no time in improving and
justifying.</p>
<p>When the colonists learned the terms on which the contest
between the pastoral interest and the Colonial Office had been
settled, they saw at once that the interest of all those who were
not squatters with four thousand sheep had been sacrificed; and
that to maintain a high price of land on sale, land on lease had
been handed over in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Many of those who had supported the squatters so long as Sir
George Gipps attempted to confiscate their property, and had
encouraged them to resist a system of taxation based on royal
prerogative, similar to that which Hampden died resisting, now
saw that the compromise sacrificed everything to the pastoral
interest, and seriously checked the extension of that class of
yeoman freeholders on whom the colonisation of the colony chiefly
depended&mdash;for without farms there would be few wives and
children in the bush.</p>
<p>Among these was Mr. Robert Lowe, who, as chairman of the
committee appointed "to consider the minimum upset price of
land," drew up a report, in which, on the evidence of all the
most distinguished men in the colony, the whole legislation of
the mother country on the subject of land was shown to be opposed
to the feelings, to the needs of the colonies, and, in fact, to
the colonisation of such a country as Australia.</p>
<p>In the same year Mr. Lowe issued a small pamphlet, entitled
"Address to the colonists of New South Wales, on the proposed
Land Orders," which shortly and clearly explained the defects of
the compromise with the squatters. He observes:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"The position of the squatter has always varied with
the price of land. Precarious when land is low, more assured when
it is high, and little short of freehold, when the sale of land
is, as now, virtually prohibited. Up to the year 1841, when the
price of land was raised from five shillings to twelve shillings
per acre, the squatters looked upon themselves, and were regarded
by the community as merely temporary occupants, depasturing the
land till it was wanted for sale&mdash;as persons who might soon,
and must eventually, be removed, to make way for the proprietor
in fee-simple. The Act of Parliament which passed in 1842, for
raising the minimum price of land to £1 an acre, was not intended
to have any effect on the position of the squatter; it was
intended, as Lord Grey tells us, to prevent jobbing to
concentrate the population&mdash;to bring out immigrants by
raising a large land fund, and by means of such immigrants to
raise the value of land. Instead of preventing jobbing, it has
sacrificed almost the whole territory to one vast job. Instead of
concentration, it has given us dispersion; it has destroyed the
land fund which it was intended to raise, stopped the immigration
it was intended to promote, and annihilated the value of land it
was intended to enhance.<br>
<br>
"The squatters, considering that they held the land till it was
required for purchase, and that the purchase had been made by
Parliament impossible, began to look upon their runs as their
own. They began to sprout from tenants-at-will into freeholders.
Sir George Gipps saw the danger, but instead of meeting it by a
reduction of the minimum price of land, which would at once have
extinguished these aspiring hopes, he sought, by showing them the
precarious nuture of their tenure, by exacting arbitrary tribute,
more objectionable in its nature than in its amount, and by
withholding from them all the machinery of government, for the
use of which they were taxed, to check this encroaching spirit.
This injudicious harshness had precisely the contrary effect. It
united in favour of the squatters all the liberal and
constitutional men in the community. Advantage was taken of this
indignation to divert public attention from the real cause of the
evil&mdash;the high price of land&mdash;which alone had made the
squatting question of importance, and to fix it on the plausible
palliation of leases and pre-emption.<br>
<br>
"It is needless to dwell upon the vacillating and contradictory
schemes of the home and local government during the years 1845
and 1846, in which they seem to have considered every expedient
for settling the question, except the only effectual one, the
reduction of the price of land. At last the Act 9 and 10
Victoria, chap. 104, was passed. By this Act, Parliament
delegated the powers which it withheld from the Legislative
Council of New South Wales, to the Privy Council of England. The
Privy Council has transmitted a set of proposed rules to the
colony, not for the purpose of obtaining the opinion of the
colonists, (for what right have they to an opinion about their
own affairs?) but to prepare the local government for the
exercise of the powers which the Privy Council&mdash;the delegate
of Parliament&mdash;has delegated to it. These rules are in
substance that the governor shall divide the lands of the colony
into three districts, to be called the "settled," "intermediate,"
and "unsettled." The settled lands are to be sold by auction at
£1 an acre, upset price, and the unsold parts are to be leased
for not more than one year, by auction. In the unsettled lands,
every holder of a licence is entitled to <i>demand</i> a lease
for fourteen years. His rent is to be £2 10s. for every thousand
sheep or 640 cattle which the run will carry. During the fourteen
years nobody else can buy the run, but the lessee can buy any
portion, not less than 160 acres, at £1 an acre, <i>without
competition</i>. At the end of the lease, the lessee is entitled
to a renewal for another fourteen years, unless at least
one-fourth of the run be sold at auction, when the upset price
will consist of £1 an acre, and the value of the improvements. In
the intermediate districts the lease is to be for eight years
only, and the land is liable to be sold at the end of every
year.</blockquote>
<p align="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<blockquote>"Once grant these leases, and beyond the settled
districts there will be no land to be sold&mdash;the lessees will
have a right to hold their lands until some one will give £1 an
acre for them.<br>
<br>
"These leases cannot be sold, mortgaged, or sublet. Be the
capabilities of these lands what they may, they are to be a sheep
walk for ever. The home government which raised the price of land
to enforce concentration, is now in the sequel of its policy
compelling dispersion.<br>
<br>
"The squatter may make sure of his run at the end of his lease by
buying up, in the exercise of his pre-emptive right, all the
water and all the water frontage; thus rendering the run
valueless to any one except himself.<br>
<br>
"The price he is to pay for these privileges is, counting three
sheep to an acre, one-fifth of a penny per acre. Thus does a
government which is so niggard of its land that it will not part
with the fee-simple of the most barren rock for less than £1 an
acre, while that £1 an acre law remains in force, alienate
millions of acres at one-tenth of the rent which it received on
its free grants. The system devised for the preservation of the
waste lands will end in their confiscation.<br>
<br>
"Deal liberally with the squatters give them the most ample
compensation&mdash;give them the land for nothing till it is
wanted for purchase&mdash;comply with all their reasonable, nay
more, with many of their unreasonable demands&mdash;their present
views have been forced upon them by the folly of the home
government&mdash;not originated by themselves; they are a great
and growing interest, producing the main export of the colony,
respectable for their numbers, their intelligence, and their
wealth. But we ought never to forget, that if we give over to
them their territory, we are giying away what is not our
own&mdash;we are trustees for posterity.</blockquote>
<p align="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<blockquote>"Our obvious duty therefore is, to press upon the
home government the repeal of the £1 an acre Act, and the Act
under which these orders were made not because the first has
dispersed our population, driven away capital and checked
emigration, but because this Act, in addition to these minor
grievances, is about to wrench from us for ever the possession of
our own territory, and give it over to men who have no right to
it whatever, and who will neither develop its resources nor
enable others to do so."</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<p>This protest, supported as it was by the public opinion of the
great majority of the colonists, had no effect on the official or
home government. Earl Grey assigned to the three Land and
Emigration Commissioners the task of replying to the report of a
committee which had embodied the opinions of a large body of
experienced and intelligent colonists, and these three young
gentlemen, whose lives had been passed in the study and practice
of official routine, "looking out on St. James's Park, settled to
the entire satisfaction of themselves and their chief, and in
direct contradiction to the opinions of the Colonial Legislative
Council, how land was to be sold and grazed at the
antipodes."</p>
<p>This was adding insult to injury. In 1848 a committee of the
House of Lords on colonisation examined a number of Australian
colonists. With one exception, a gentleman engaged in promoting a
new land speculation in Western Australia, all the witnesses
agreed on the impolicy of the land system which had been fastened
on the Australian colonies.</p>
<p>For instance, Lieutenent-Colonel Sir Thomas Mitchell, surveyor
general and member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales,
thus describes the course imposed on a colonist desirous of
purchasing land:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"The intending purchaser must notify and describe to
the government the land he wishes to purchase. Then no matter in
what part of the very extensive colony it may be, the land must
be measured and described, and a report made upon it to the local
government. After this selection has received the governor's
sanction, which takes time, the land is put up and advertised
three months for sale by public auction, so that a party who may
have taken the trouble to seek out a suitable portion of land,
has to wait a long time before it can be advertised for sale, and
then three months after such advertising he has to run the risk,
at the end of that time which he has lost, of seeing another
person purchase the land which he may have taken the trouble to
seek out and select.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;
During the time of Sir George Gipps the maximum price of the last
sale was ordered to be the minimum price of the next sale
<i>that</i> operated to stop that kind of colonisation
altogether."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>He also says in reference to the "ordinances" we have
quoted&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"The squatters have been clamorous to obtain some
title to possession; a great concession has recently been made,
and according to orders in council recently sent out, they are to
have leases of runs for fourteen years. The colonists in general
seem to consider a fourteen years' lease with power to renew
almost as good as fee-simple."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>Before the same committee Mr. William Bradley, a native
Australian member of the Legislative Council, a landed
proprietor, a magistrate, and holder of a run of three hundred
thousand acres; Captain Coghill, member of the Legislative
Council, and a proprietor of thirty thousand acres of freehold;
and Mr. W. Verner, late Chief Commissioner of the Insolvent
Court, and a settler in Port Phillip, gave strong evidence to the
same effect.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Chisholm said&mdash;"The most important thing to be
done, would be to get a survey of land, laying out farms, varying
from thirty acres to one hundred acres. That land would be
purchased by small capitalists, who are now in the labour market,
and only want an opportunity to purchase land. There is very
little encouragement given to agriculture; there is a difficulty
in getting land. If families are to be provided for, it is
necessary that agricultural farms should be thrown open to them,
by making it easy for the poor man, when he has saved his money,
to purchase a farm without loss of time."</p>
<p>But, as in 1848 the Squattocracy had obtained all and more
than they had ever hoped to obtain; as Earl Grey, who never
changes his mind, was at the head of the Colonial-office; as
emigration was rendered brisk by the distress at home; no change
was made toward multiplying freeholders in Australia.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chisholm also suggested that as a means of enabling
labouring men to invest in land, and inducing them to save, land
notes or tickets should be issued of the value of five pounds
each and upwards, which should pass current in the purchase of
government land, so that frugal families might find a safe
substitute for the savings bank.</p>
<p>Subsequent events have doubly proved the soundness of the
principles of those who opposed the government land system.</p>
<p>The good land of Australia lies in patches, "<i>oases</i>" in
deserts fit only for pasture. The high-priced symmetrical system,
condemned by Sir Thomas Mitchell, doomed many districts to sheep,
where villages and agriculture would have been found of great
value not only in extending population and civilisation but in
providing food for the gold diggers.</p>
<p>The result of the policy inaugurated by Lord Stanley, carried
out and still approved by Earl Grey, was to make the humbler
class of the Australian population as loose as possible on the
land, vagrants instead of settlers. The condition of the country
would have been infinitely less critical, if for the last ten
years the successful emigrants had been encouraged to settle as
much as possible on land instead of investing their savings, if
not in drink, in stock, or in tours on the coast. Freeholds,
easily obtained, would have stimulated marriage, and those who
resorted to gold hunting would have returned successful or
unsuccessful to their homesteads.</p>
<p>Another result pregnant with evil looms in the future. The
best land for settlement and cultivation in the neighbourhood of
a gold-field may be held on lease by a squatter, who having held
it for a nominal rent during the lease may claim to purchase it
in a block at a price which, considering the enhanced value, will
be nominal! It will not be surprising if the men enriched by
gold-digging, who saw themselves before the golden age of
Australia excluded from freehold by squatters, runs, and the £1
an acre lots, grow rather discontented, when under the new order
of things they again meet their old friend the squatter still in
the character of a monopolist, with power to buy for £1 land
worth ten which he has held on lease for a rent of one-fifth of a
penny, when it was well worth in 100 acre lots 5s. or 10s. an
acre.</p>
<p>But these are questions we must leave the colonists and their
Parliaments to settle. Fortunately, we have not Earl Grey at the
Colonial-office to fan up the flames of insurrection; for we
learn from his apology for his "Colonial Policy," that in 1832
the universal evidence of the colonists against his land system
had not shaken his original convictions; he considered "that the
working of the Act (of 1842), far from showing that there was
anything erroneous in the views of those by whom it was
recommended and passed, seems to have proved the soundness of the
principles on which it was founded. At the same time, some
improvements in its detail were suggested by experience." And he
proceeds to quote the Act of 1846, and the orders in council,
which we have dissected, as specimens of "improvements in
detail." * A little further on he says, "those who contended that
instead of adopting the squatting ordinances the minimum price of
land ought to have been reduced, asserted, that by the
regulations the squatters were virtually put in possession of
land which could never be resumed if wanted. Experience has,
however, demonstrated that there was no ground for such an
apprehension. <i>Already in Victoria above</i> £20,000 <i>has
been laid out by one individual, in purchasing the fee-simple of
land which had been occupied as a run by another person</i>."
Earl Grey's illustration is most unfortunate, but characteristic
of the careless manner in which he collects the few
"<i>facts</i>" with which he embellishes his narrative. In the
case cited no lease had been granted to the occupier of the run,
no lease could be granted, inasmuch as it was within the settled
district of Melbourne. Leases are for 8 years and for 14 years,
and no lease granted under the ordinances has yet run out. The
purchase in question consisted of land, which from its quali ty
and situation, if put up for auction in convenient lots even at
an upset of one shilling-an acre, would have fetched more than
the sum paid under the special survey system, in one block, viz.,
£20,000 for 20,000 acres without competition. This purchase gave
the purchaser the right of pre-emption and of pasturage over
three times as much more land, which was worth to rent altogether
at that time one thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Vol. I., p. 314, Earl Grey's Colonial
Policy.]</p>
<p>Earl Grey says (vol i. page 317), "there can be no doubt that
by reducing the price as much as would be necessary to meet the
views of the chief opponents of the present system, a powerful
impulse would be given to the spirit of land jobbing."</p>
<p>For our own parts we cannot conceive any system more
calculated to promote land-jobbing than that which retains good
agricultural land as sheep walks, until such time as the spread
of population raises the demand high enough to tempt a capitalist
speculator who lays out twenty thousand pounds in order to make
sixty, by retailing to actual cultivators, without adding a
shilling to the value of the land, by roads, buildings or
fences.</p>
<p>And that is the system Earl Grey approved and maintained in
office, and still approves in his unwilling retirement.</p>
<br>
<p>We have deemed it right to give the history of the land
question at great length, with full quotations from colonial
evidence on the subject, because its past and proximate effects
on the condition of the colonists, and their relations with the
parent state, fill a place in colonial annals not less important
than the anti-corn law struggle in the political history of Great
Britain&mdash;and because, too, Earl Grey has ventured, in his
published defence of his policy, on a misrepresentation and
suppression of the facts of the case, which may mislead those who
are not prepared for the drudgery of searching for colonial truth
in blue-books, despatches, and files of colonial debates.</p>
<h5>THE NEW CONSTITUTION.</h5>
<p>While the transportation question was unsettled and the land
question in hot dispute, a third question, that of a new
constitution, with extended powers, from time to time occupied
the attention of the politicians of the three colonies. South
Australia looked forward anxiously to the enjoyment of
representative institutions having, up to 1850 been ruled by a
governor with an official and nominee council. Port Phillip
desired separation from New South Wales, and a representative
legislature of its own. The distance of Melbourne from Sydney was
so great that it was found impossible, in a limited and dispersed
population, to find gentlemen able and willing to abandon their
pursuits and property to pass the legislative sessions in so
distant a city as Sydney.</p>
<p>In New South Wales it was confidently expected that the new
constitution would bestow rights similar to those enjoyed by the
Canadians&mdash;that is to say, an executive responsible to the
Legislative Council, with full control over their revenues and
the disposal of the waste lands.</p>
<p>In 1847 Earl Grey prepared a scheme by which the district
councils, which were held throughout the colony in equal hatred
and contempt, were to form electoral colleges, and by double
election return a representative assembly, while a second
superior chamber was to be composed of nominees.</p>
<p>The publication in the colony of the despatch containing a
sketch of this scheme, which looked in print like a chapter out
of "Telemachus," was followed by such a manifestation of
opposition, and by petitions so numerously signed, requesting
that no change should be made in the constitution without the
colonists being first permitted to express their opinion upon it,
that the colonial minister withdrew his project.</p>
<p>In 1849 a committee of the Board of Trade, to whom Earl Grey
entrusted the task, prepared a report suggesting a form of
constitution to be bestowed on the three colonies. A bill for
carrying into effect this report was introduced into, but not
carried through the British Parliament. Under this bill the three
colonies would have had the power of settling the land, and
several other questions, by a sort of congress.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Report was sent out to the colonies. In
Port Phillip and South Australia the concession of representative
institutions was considered so great a boon that the other parts
of the scheme were not too closely criticised. In Port Phillip
especially, where an ancient contest had been carried on to
obtain separation from New South Wales, the new constitution was
received with the utmost enthusiasm. In New South Wales, where a
representative council had existed for several years, the
sections of the report which gave the most satisfaction were
those which appeared to give control over the expenditure of the
land revenues, and the power of fixing the price of land.</p>
<p>In the session of 1850 a bill became law, of which the
following is an abstract:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:center">13 and 14 Vict. cap.
59&mdash;<i>An Act for the better Government of her Majesty's
Australian Colonies</i>.</div>
<br>
<br>
§ 1, after reciting the previous acts for the government of the
Australian governments, enacts that the district of Port Phillip
shall form a separate colony, to be henceforth known as the
colony of Victoria. After the separation (2), in the colony of
New South Wales the Legislative Council is to consist of such a
number of members as the Governor and Council shall determine, of
which one-third is to be appointed by her Majesty, and the
remaining two-thirds to be elected by the inhabitants of the
colony; and the Governor arid Council are to establish the
electoral districts and polling-places, issue the necessary writs
for the elections, and make regulations for taking the polls and
deciding on the validity of the returns. § 4 provides that every
natural-born or naturalised subject of her Majesty, of the age of
21, possessing a freehold estate within the district of £100
clear value above all incumbrances or charges on it, for at least
six months before the date of the writ or the last registration,
if a registration has been established, or occupying a
dwelling-house for six months of the clear annual value of £10,
or holding a licence to depasture lands within the district, or
holding a leasehold estate in the district of the yearly value of
£10 of which the lease has not less than three years to run, and
on which in all cases the rates and taxes due to within three
months of such election or registration have been paid, and is
not attainted of treason, felony, &amp;c., is to be entitled to
vote at the election of a member of the Legislative Council.<br>
<br>
Power is given (§ 11) to the Governor and Legislative Council to
alter the districts, and to increase the number of members, but
in the case of an increase a number equal to one-third of the
whole is to be appointed by her Majesty.<br>
<br>
The Governor and Legislative Council (§ 14), when thus
constituted, are authorised to make laws within the said colony,
and to appropriate the whole of the revenues arising from taxes,
duties, rates, &amp;c., provided such are not repugnant to the
laws of England; <i>but they are not to interfere with the lands
belonging to the crown, nor with the revenues arising
therefrom</i>, nor shall it be lawful to appropriate any sums of
money to the public service, unless the Governor have first
recommended to the Council to make such provision for the
specific public service towards which such money is to be
appropriated, nor shall any money be issued except under the
order of the Governor directed to the treasurer; and the revenues
(§ 15) are to be charged with the costs and charges for the
collection and management of the same, subject to such
regulations and audits as may be directed by the Treasury Board
of England. Out of the revenues (§ 17) are to be paid the sums
for judicial, official, and religious services, enumerated in
schedules A, B, C, and D; these sums, however, may be altered by
the Governor and Legislative Council (§ 18), subject to the
consent of her Majesty.<br>
<br>
By § 22 power is continued to district councils to make by-laws,
subject to the approval of the Governor, who is to appoint the
districts, fix the number and qualification of councillors, and
the time and manner of election, nominate the first councillors,
make regulations for their going out of office, and to define
their powers; but the Governor and Legislative Councils (§ 24)
may regulate the tolls, rates, and assessments in such districts,
and may also regulate the constitution and duties of the district
councillors, and the number and boundaries of the districts.<br>
<br>
27 empowers the Governor and Council to levy customs on goods
imported, but no duty to be imposed on any article from one
country that is not alike imposed on the same article from other
countries. No duties, however (§ 31), are to be levied on
articles imported for the supply of her Majesty's land or sea
forces, nor may they grant any exemption, or impose any duty at
variance with any treaty concluded by her Majesty with any
foreign power.<br>
<br>
By § 32 power is given to the Governor and Legislative Council,
subject to the assent of her Majesty, to alter the provisions of
this act as to the election of members of the Legislative
Councils, and the qualification of members and electors; or to
establish, instead of the Legislative Council, a Council and a
House of Representatives or other Legislative Houses, and to vest
in the same the powers of the Legislative Council.<br>
<br>
The other clauses extend to all the other colonies in Australia,
namely, Victoria, Van Diemen's Land, South Australia, and Western
Australia, the same rights as are given to New South Wales, with
power to extend them to new colonies; they also enable the
boundaries to be altered, and provide a new Supreme Court at
Victoria. The act is to commence within six weeks after a copy
has been received by each Governor respectively.<br>
<br>
Schedules referred to in the foregoing act. New South Wales is
marked A, Victoria B, Van Diemen's Land C, and South Australia
D.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>In the new province of Victoria, and in South Australia, the
new law was received, as was to be expected, with universal
satisfaction. They had obtained at least as much as they
expected; but when the colonists of New South Wales found that
the clauses as to land and revenue for which they were most
anxious had been excised, their universal discontent was embodied
in the following remonstrance, and passed as almost their last
act by the expiring Legislative Council. The hand of the author,
William Wentworth, fiercely eloquent, is visible in every
line:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"We, the Legislative Council of New South Wales, in
council assembled, feel it a solemn duty which we owe to
ourselves, our constituents, and our posterity, before we give
place to the new legislature established by the 13 and 14 Vict.,
cap. 59, to record our deep disappointment and dissatisfaction at
the constitution conferred by that act on the colony we
represent. <i>After the reiterated reports, resolutions,
addresses, and petitions, which have proceeded from us during the
whole course of our legislative career, against the schedules
appended to the</i> 5 <i>and</i> 6 <i>Vict., cap</i>. 76, <i>and
the appropriations of our ordinary revenue therein made, by the
sole authority of Parliament against the administration of our
waste lands, and our territorial revenue thence arising against
the withholding of the customs department from our control
against the dispensation of the patronage of the colony by or at
the nomination of the minister for the colonies and against the
veto reserved and exercised by the same minister, in the name of
the crown, in all matters of local legislation</i>; we feel that
we had a right to expect that these undoubted grievances would
have been redressed by the 13 and 14 Vict., cap. 59; or else that
power to redress them would have been conferred on the
constituent bodies thereby created, with the avowed intention of
establishing an authority more competent than Parliament itself
to frame suitable constitutions for the whole group of the
Australian colonies. These our reasonable expectations have been
utterly frustrated. The schedules, instead of being abolished,
have been increased. The powers of altering the appropriations in
these schedules, conferred on the colonial legislature by this
new enactment, limited as these powers are, have been, in effect,
nullified by the subsequent instructions of the colonial
minister. The exploded fallacies of the Wakefield theory are
still clung to; the pernicious Land Sales Act (5 and 6 Vict.,
cap. 36) is still maintained in all its integrity; and thousands
of our fellow-countrymen (in consequence of the undue price put
by that mischievous and impolitic enactment upon-our waste lands,
in defiance of the precedents of the United States, of Canada,
and the other North American colonies, and even of the
neighbouring colony of the Cape of Good Hope) are annually
diverted from our shores, and thus forced against their will to
seek a home for themselves and their children in the backwoods of
America. Nor is this all. Our territorial revenue, diminished as
it is by this insane policy, is in a great measure confined to
the introduction among us of people unsuited to our wants, in
many instances the outpourings of the poorhouses and unions of
the United Kingdom; instead of being applied, as it ought to be,
in directing to our colony a stream of vigorous and efficient
labour, calculated to elevate the character of our industrial
population. The bestowal of offices among us, with but partial
exceptions, is still exercised by or at the nomination of the
colonial minister, and without reference to the just and
paramount claims of the colonists, as if the colony itself were
but the fief of that minister. The salaries of the officers of
the customs and all other departments of government mentioned in
the schedules are placed beyond our control; and the only result
of this new enactment, ushered as it was into Parliament by the
Prime Minister himself with so much parade, and under the
pretence of conferring upon us enlarged powers of
self-government, and treating us, at last, as an integral portion
of the British empire, is, that all the material powers exercised
for centuries by the House of Commons are still withheld from us.
That our loyalty and our desire for the maintenance of proper
order are so far distrusted that we are not permitted to vote our
own civil list, lest it might prove inadequate to the necessities
of the public service. That our waste lands, and our territorial
revenue, for which her Majesty is but a trustee, instead of being
spontaneously surrendered as an equivalent for such civil list,
is still reserved, to our great detriment, to swell the patronage
and power of the ministers of the crown.<br>
<br>
"Thus circumstanced, we feel that on the eve of this council's
dissolution, and as the closing act of our legislative existence,
no other course is open to us but to enter on our journals our
solemn declaration, protest, and remonstrance, as well against
the Act of Parliament itself (13 and 14 Vict., cap. 59) as
against the instruction of the minister by which the small power
of retrenchment that act confers on the colonial legislature has
been thus overridden; and to bequeath the redress of the
grievances, which we have been unable to effect by constitutional
means, to the Legislative Council by which we are about to be
succeeded."</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<p>It would be easy to prove to those who were unacquainted with
the political history of New South Wales that these grievances
are for the most part imaginary; for in <i>theory</i> the
colonists have almost all the rights claimed, and against
granting them those they have not there are plausible theoretical
objections.</p>
<p>For instance they have nearly the same control in theory over
the customs department that we have; but as the officers are
appointed in England by a board distant sixteen thousand miles,
and paid out of a fund over which the colonists have no control,
it may easily be imagined that they find it difficult to regulate
the due execution of the duties of a department which has been
almost too powerful for the merchants of London with all their
parliamentary influence close at hand. It is true that here the
salaries and cost of collection are deducted from the gross
revenues, and so far the Australian rule follows the bad British
precedent; but here the ministers who refuse to redress an
administrative grievance may be turned out of office&mdash;there
the advisers of the governor are irremovable.</p>
<p>So too there are theoretical reasons for making the salaries
of the principal officers permanent, but the colonists
remonstrating had in their view instances in which they had been
compelled to pay Masters in Equity and prothonotaries, thrust
upon them against their will.</p>
<p>There is no question that to confine patronage to colonists
would be to shut out much talent and learning from the colony;
but the remonstrants were thinking of a whole line of incapables
and insolvents who had been provided for by the British minister
at the expense of the colony.</p>
<p>Again, it is desirable that in certain cases the imperial
government should have the power of vetoing colonial legislation;
but the remonstrants were thinking of instances then recent in
which that power had been exercised in a most injurious
manner,&mdash;as for instance, in the "Wool Lien Act."</p>
<p>We need not pursue further the particulars of a contest which
has died away, not without leaving some ill-healed scars, under
the conciliating policy of Earl Grey's successors and the
hilarious prosperity of the gold discoveries.</p>
<p>We have mentioned enough to prove that the discontents of the
colonists of New South Wales were not excited by imaginary
causes, but had their source in real and chiefly in taxing
grievances&mdash;the sort of grievance, next to an interference
with his personal liberty, which troubles the Englishman most
acutely.</p>
<p>It is quite certain that the colonists were not always in the
right; sometimes in their contests with the Colonial Office they
were very much in the wrong,&mdash;just as we in England are
subject to political and commercial aberrations; but in order to
form anything like an apology for Earl Grey's unpopularity in
Australia we must assume that he was infallible&mdash;that he
knew better than any colonist what was good for the colony; and
that therefore he was justified in ruling a transmarine
dependency, peopled by an English race, on principles that no
minister dare apply to Yorkshire or Lancashire.</p>
<br>
<p>In the midst of the first session of the new Colonial
Parliaments, all political contests, internal and external, were
cast into the shade by the gold discoveries: land question,
convict question, taxation question, all were absorbed by the
digging up of gold, over which flocks and herds had long been
carelessly driven. The year 1850 found New South Wales with
200,000 free people, an export of £2,899,600, an import of
£2,078,300, and 7,000,000 sheep&mdash;a surplus revenue and an
annual demand for labour&mdash;nominal freedom of
self-government, actual restriction from legislation on every
vital interest. Who can say in what condition, social and
political, 1860 will find the felon colony of 1788?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>
<h4>VICTORIA, OR PORT PHILLIP.<br>
<br>
1835 TO 1850.</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the year 1834 Victoria, or Port
Phillip, was a desert, barely known to Europeans except by the
reports of wandering shore parties of whalers and sealers. In the
year 1852 nearly two hundred thousand inhabitants, six millions
of fine-woolled sheep, a city furnished with many of the luxuries
if not the comforts of civilised life, two thriving ports crowded
with ships, steam-boats, and coasters, farms, gardens, and
vineyards, attested the colonising vigour of the English race,
the advantages of its soil and climate, and, not least, of
<i>administrative and legislative neglect</i>; for Port Phillip
attained all its solid prosperity without the aid of colonising
companies or acts of Parliament, or governors or regiments, or
any of the complicated machinery with which sham colonies are
bolstered up, and real colonies are so often encumbered.</p>
<p>A small band of experienced colonists, a succession of flocks
and herds from the opposite coast, a magistrate, a few policemen
and customs officers, then a sort of deputy-governor under the
modest name of superintendent&mdash;these were found sufficient
for building up the most flourishing dependency of the British
crown, without calling on the home country for a single
shilling.</p>
<p>The history of Port Phillip is singularly barren of incident,
and may be comprised in a very few pages, while volumes might be
filled with the moving accidents which have chequered the career
of colonies which have not attained, and are not likely to
attain, one-tenth of its wealth and importance as a field for
British labour and capital.</p>
<p>In 1798, Bass, in the course of his whale-boat expedition,
visited Western Port, one of the harbours of Victoria. In 1802
Flinders sailed into Port Phillip Bay, having been preceded ten
weeks previously by Lieutenant John Murray, of the Lady
Nelson.</p>
<p>In 1803 Lieutenant Governor Collins, who held the office of
judge-advocate under Governor Phillip in the first colony, and on
his return to England in 1796 had published an "Account of New
South Wales," was sent out with H. M. ships Calcutta and Ocean
with detachments of royal marines, a number of free settlers, and
several hundred prisoners to found a settlement at Port Phillip,
where, having sailed on April 27th, he arrived October 3rd. The
expedition disembarked on the southern shore of the bay, where
the beach was unfavourable for landing, and there was no fresh
water. It is evident, from a narrative published by one of the
party,* that from the first Colonel Collins ** had no earnest
desire to form a settlement at Port Phillip: he had heard glowing
accounts of the beauty and fertility of the opposite shores of
Van Diemen's Land, and, after a very cursory survey, he decided
on removing thither. In the course of a walk round the bay,
undertaken by the officers of the ship, they found "on the
eastern shore, twenty-eight miles from the entrance, a stream of
water emptying itself into the port." "The bed of the stream is
covered with folicacious mica, which our people first conceived
to be gold-dust." At the present day we cannot be so sure that it
was mica. According to an account given in a Tasmanian almanack,
which does not agree with that of Lieutenant Tuckey, the
expedition remained at Port Phillip from 3rd Oct. to 30th
January. If that were so, it is difficult to understand how the
great natural advantages of Port Phillip could have escaped the
observation of two ships' crews.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Lieutenant Tuckey's Voyage in H. M. S.
Calcutta, to found a Settlement in Bass's Straits. 1803-4."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Colonel David Collins was the grandson of
Arthur Collins, author of the Peerage of England, which was
afterwards continued by Sir Egerton Brydges. He was a Lieutenant
of Marines in the Southampton frigate in 1772, when Matilda,
Queen of Denmark, took refuge on board. He afterwards fought at
the battle of Bunker's Hill, under his father, General Collins:
he died in Van Diemen's Land.]</p>
<p>During their encampment on the shores of Port Phillip three of
the convicts escaped into the interior: one of them was William
Buckley, a native of Macclesfield, who had been a grenadier,
served under the Duke of York in Flanders, and had been
transported for striking his superior officer.</p>
<p>Previous to the arrival of Collins, Mr. Charles Grimes, the
surveyor-general of the colony, had completed the marine survey
of Flinders by making an outline of the harbour, where he
reported the existence of the river now known as the Yarra Yarra,
or "ever-flowing water."</p>
<p>In 1824 Messrs. Hume and Hovell, two stockowners of New South
Wales, made an expedition to explore new pastures, and,
travelling from near Lake George four hundred miles, in the
course of which they traversed the flanks of the Australian Alps,
and crossed three rivers, which they named the Hume, the Ovens,
and the Goulburn, emerged on shores which they imagined to be
those of Western Port; but there is now little doubt that they
had really reached the western arm of Port Phillip Bay, near the
site of the port of Geelong. In looking at a map of the Melbourne
district a spot will be found marked <i>Mount Disappointment</i>,
about thirty miles from Melbourne. It was this hill that the
weary travellers climbed, calculating that from its summit they
would behold the sea. They were right in the direction, and a
long line of coast and a stretch of the finest sheep plains lay
in a line before them; but, unfortunately, lofty broad-boled
trees hid everything from their longing eyes, and they descended
sad and disheartened.</p>
<p>It would seem as if there had been a spell over this fortunate
land which guarded its wealth from the discovery of a series of
explorers, from Cook to Hovell and Hume.</p>
<p>Mr. Hovell was afterwards employed by the government to form a
settlement at Western Port, which, however, was soon abandoned;
and the fine pastoral country traversed in the course of his
journey with Mr. Hume excited little attention, in consequence of
the discovery, about the same time, of Brisbane Downs, better
known as Maneroo, which were more accessible from the
previously-occupied districts.</p>
<p>In 1834 Messrs. Henty, engaged in the whaling trade at
Launceston in Van Diemen's Land, formed a branch establishment at
Portland Bay, and soon afterwards imported a few sheep and cattle
to feed on the splendid pastures which there, unlike the other
districts of Australia, carpetted the shores almost to the
water's edge; and in the same year other flockowners from Van
Diemen's Land crossed the straits to Port Phillip.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>GUM TREES NEAR MELBOURNE.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Already the Tasmanians had found the pastures of their island,
covered as the greater portion of it is by inaccessible mountains
and forests of gigantic timber, too limited for the annual
increase of their flocks. The reports of the pastoral resources
of the opposite shore became a constant subject for discussion;
and in April, 1835, a party of settlers formed themselves into an
association,* for the purpose of taking possession of an estate
in Port Phillip; but before they could execute their project Mr.
John Batman, a blacksmith, born in New South Wales, but then
visiting Van Diemen's Land, secretly set sail from Launceston,
accompanied by a party of tame blacks from the neighbourhood of
Sydney, landed in the middle of May, and, through his native
interpreter, entered into an arrangement with the Port Phillip
aborigines for the purchase of some of their land; returned to
Van Diemen's Land, and, again crossing the straits with a store
of goods, induced the savages to put their marks to a deed
prepared by a Tasmanian lawyer, which purported to transfer a
large tract of land, altogether about half a million acres, in
consideration of certain blankets and tomahawks. This
transaction, like all similar purchases from hunting tribes, was
mere child's play. The aborigines of Australia have no idea of
cultivation, and consequently no idea of possession of land or
anything else. They accepted Batman's blankets, tobacco, 203
flour, tomahawks, &amp;c., and only understood that by that
payment he became their ally.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The association consisted of Messrs. S. and N.
Jackson, Fawkner, Marr, Evans, and Lancy.]</p>
<p>Batman selected the site of his future manor-house at Indented
Head. Thence he soon beheld the approach of the ships of the
Association whom, by his rapid proceedings, he had forestalled in
the honour of founding the future Victoria.</p>
<p>It is said, we know not with what truth, that he mounted his
horse, and, galloping down to the beach, warned them off his
estate. Perhaps, in 1950, a young Victorian painter may assemble
crowds in the Melbourne National Gallery, to see "Batman warning
the intruders from Port Phillip Bay."</p>
<p>Some of the party, awed by his legal threats, retired inland,
and set their flocks to feed on land they eventually acquired.
Mr. John Pascoe Fawkner, a name still well known in Victoria,
with more obstinacy and good fortune, took up a position on the
northern banks of the Yarra, overlooking the spot where a natural
ledge divided the salt tide from the fresh river at the ebb,
above a natural basin, which has since, by the aid of masonry,
been converted into a port for the city of Melbourne, open to
vessels and steamers of two hundred tons.</p>
<p>Batman had previously addressed a letter to Colonel Arthur,
the Governor of Van Diemen's Land, in which he informed him of
his proceedings; described the country he had explored in glowing
but not exaggerated terms; and requested the support of his
excellency in his schemes of colonisation, and for the
civilisation of the natives. Colonel Arthur transmitted copies of
Batman's letter, and all the documents connected with his alleged
purchase from the natives, to the Colonial Office; expressed his
decided opinion that the settlement of Port Phillip would form a
useful outlet for the settlers of Van Diemen's Land; and that Mr.
Batman, "whose conduct had been marked by humanity as well as
enterprise," was deserving of a grant of land, although his
purchase, as he had already informed him, was clearly
illegal.</p>
<p>Lord Aberdeen, and his successor, Lord Glenelg, followed the
unfortunate course which has almost invariably been adopted by
our colonial ministers. They began by saying no, and in a very
short period were obliged to say <i>yes</i>&mdash;to acknowledge
a fact!</p>
<p>Lord Aberdeen in December, 1834, and Lord Glenelg in July,
1835, wrote elaborate despatches, the one against the occupation
of Twofold Bay, the outlet to Brisbane Downs, or Maneroo, as it
is now called, on the borders of Port Phillip, as recommended by
Sir Richard Bourke, and the other against the occupation of Port
Phillip, as recommended by Colonel Arthur, objecting to measures
"the consequence of which would be to spread over a still further
extent of country a population which it was the object of the
land regulations to concentrate," and declining, on the ground of
"expense to the mother country, and danger to the natives and
settlers," to sanction the proceedings of Batman and his
associates.</p>
<p>But before the despatches were unsealed the thing was done.
Mother Partington's mop was not more powerful to stop the
Atlantic than paper proclamations to arrest the march of
Australian settlers with sheep and lambs in sight of "fresh
fields and pastures new."</p>
<p>On the one hand, shepherds and stockmen were spreading
overland, following their flock from pasture to pasture toward
Port Phillip; on the other, a Port Phillip fever seized the
Tasmanians, and they crowded across the straits like the
patriarchs of old, with tents and all their woolly
possessions.</p>
<p>"We went down," says a lady, who was then a little child, "to
see the six adventurers embark for Port Phillip, with the same
feeling as if it had been Cortez or Pizarro; but very soon there
was the same universal rush for Port Phillip that there is now
for the gold-diggings."</p>
<p>It was while one of these early parties was landing from boats
near the future site of Melbourne that they saw, amid a tribe of
natives sitting under a tree, with all the arms and tokens of a
chief, a man of large limbs and gigantic stature,
lighter-coloured than his companions, as well as could be
distinguished through tan, paint, and dirt. He stared hard at the
strangers, and seemed muttering to himself; then, rising, he
approached, and addressed them in a strange jargon, in which a
few words of English were distinguishable. It was Buckley, one of
the convicts who had escaped from the party of Colonel Collins,
and, after thirty-two years' sojourning with the aborigines,
again found himself among his countrymen.</p>
<p>He had forgotten his native tongue, and had assumed all the
habits of his savage companions, among whom he was a chief by
virtue of his superior stature and strength.* He at once joined
the colonists, gradually re-acquired the English tongue, and
exercised very useful influence over his late subjects. Colonel
Arthur, the Governor of Van Diemen's Land, granted him a free
pardon, and, as it was disagreeable to him to remain in the scene
of his savage life, he became a constable in Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Buckley was six feet seven inches in
height.]</p>
<p>But either some original infirmity or long absence from
civilised social life had impaired his intellect, and he rarely
and unwillingly conversed on the events of his extraordinary
career. There is reason to believe that he and his tribe never
wandered more than forty miles inland from the shores of the
bay.</p>
<p>When, in June, 1836, a magistrate, Mr. Stewart, despatched by
Sir Richard Bourke, arrived to assert her Majesty's rights, and
to announce the invalidity of all purchases from the aborigines,
he found the country already occupied, and the work of
colonisation steadily proceeding. Nearly two hundred men had
arrived from Van Diemen's Land, and were settled around the
estuary of Port Phillip; 35,000 sheep, under the charge of strong
armed parties, with a number of horned cattle and horses, were
spread for many miles over the site of the present Ballarat
gold-fields, each party seeking to appropriate as large a run as
possible.</p>
<p>Until very recently, on the station of Messrs. Jackson, at
Saltwater River, was to be seen one of the great bells, mounted
on a lofty frame, which used to be rung from station to station
to summon assistance when an attack from the blacks was
anticipated.</p>
<p>In the same year Sir Thomas Mitchell re-explored and surveyed
the overland route from Xew South Wales, part of which had been
traversed by Messrs. Hovell and Hume, and described the fine
plains of Victoria, to which he gave the name of Australia
Felix&mdash;"the better to distinguish it from the parched
deserts of the interior country, where we had wandered so
unprofitably and so long." ** He then discovered and named Mount
Byng, the hill since become world-famous as Mount Alexander.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Mitchell's "Australia Felix."]</p>
<p>The publication of this report in the colonial and English
papers, and afterwards of Sir T. Mitchell's travels, fanned up
the flame of the Port Phillip fever, and very soon, along the
overland route, pool after pool was drunk dry by the thousands of
stock marching on to the promised land.</p>
<p>In April, 1837, Sir Richard Bourke visited the new colony, and
gave directions for laying out the town of Melbourne on two
hills, East and West Hill, sloping down to the banks of the River
Yarra. In June the first land sale took place, and speculation
commenced, and did not cease until it ended in wide-spread
insolvency in 1841 and 1842.</p>
<p>The steady course of depending on their increase of flocks and
herds was abandoned; all but a few went into town speculations
and country lots; village sites were laid out in all directions,
some of which remain projects or miserable hamlets to this hour.
Emigrants crowded in from all parts of Great Britain. At Hobson's
Bay, the entrance to the Yarra, more than one hundred
three-masted ships were to be seen at anchor at one time. Labour
rose to an enormous price; brickmakers earned 8s. a day; the
common four-pound loaf was sold for 3s. 6d.; and mere huts were
let at the rate of £100 a year. Meantime, fortunately, the living
pastoral treasures of Australia came pouring in, and increased
and multiplied on the fine downs and grass-covered hills, while
some wise, hard-working settlers devoted themselves to
agriculture.</p>
<p>During this period the Port Phillip district was nominally
under the government of the central authority at Sydney, but in
reality the people governed themselves, with the help of a
magistrate and a few policemen, while a neighbouring colony of
the same date was enjoying all the costly magnificence of
elaborate government machinery.</p>
<p>In 1839 C. J. La Trobe, Esq., the present governor, was
appointed superintendent of Port Phillip district, with an
authority little more than nominal, as the surveys, post-office,
customs, &amp;c., were managed by subordinates responsible to the
chief departments at Sydney; and even up to 1839 the sales of
rural land took place at Sydney.</p>
<p>The centralisation of authority in a distant city, having
different interests, and the appropriation of funds derived from
Port Phillip land sales to emigration into Sydney district, were
long subjects of grievance on which, as they have been redressed,
it is not necessary to dwell.</p>
<p>When representative institutions were conceded to New South
Wales, six representatives were apportioned to the Port Phillip
district; but it was soon found impossible to find that number of
colonists able and willing to live for six months of the year six
hundred miles away from their estates; and for several sessions
before 1850 the Port Phillippians virtually declined to elect
representatives.</p>
<p>In 1842 Melbourne obtained a municipal corporation, under 5
and 6 Victoria, c. 76. Victoria has, however, never been a penal
colony, although long and still suffering from the overflowings
of the felonry of Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>It would not serve any useful purpose to record the struggles
of Port Phillip to obtain an independent existence as a separate
colony, now that the question has been finally settled.</p>
<p>The general quality of the soil in Port Phillip has given the
settlers an advantage over land purchasers in less fertile
districts of Australia, and the absence of an expensive local
government has enabled the colonists to escape a local debt like
that which so long weighed down South Australia.</p>
<p>In fact the brief history of Port Phillip proves how much more
safely, successfully, and inexpensively colonies may be planted
by colonists than by enthusiastic amateurs and speculating
companies.</p>
<p>In 1852 the assembling of the first Legislative Council of
Victoria marked the commencement of a new era of independence and
prosperity, crowned by the golden discoveries at Ballarat and
Mount Alexander.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX.</h3>
<h4>SOUTH AUSTRALIA.<br>
<br>
1835 TO 1851.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Lord Alvanley</span>, stopping at a country
inn, met Beau Brummel's valet descending the stairs with an
armful of crumpled clean cravats. "Pray," he inquired, "what are
those?" "These, my lord," replied the valet, "are my master's
failures." When the Beau emigrated to Calais, amongst other
creditors, he owed an enormous bill to his laundress.</p>
<p>South Australia was the first, as Canterbury, in New Zealand,
was the last, of Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield's colonising
failures&mdash;failures which have been tried at the expense of
every class of capitalist. But, his credit being now exhausted,
it seems as if he would end his days without a good fit, thus,
sharing the fate of other unfortunate philosophers and
financiers, like Law, Owen, Cabet, and Louis Blanc, with this
difference, that those gentlemen all sacrificed something to
their theories&mdash;they lost fortune, or character, or country;
but Mr. Wakefield, while his disciples have suffered in purse and
in person, has contrived to patch up a character originally much
damaged, and build a living, if not a fortune, out of a series of
bubbles.</p>
<p>In 1829 Mr. Wakefield's charming little book, which was
analysed in Chapter IX., with its really ingenious theory and
really desirable aims&mdash;good wages, large profits, and
complete civilisation took the active world by storm; and no
sooner was the serious business of carrying the Reform Bill
completed, than a society was formed for carrying it into
practical effect.</p>
<p>The extraordinary success with which this theory was received
at home, although opposed by every intelligent colonist, may be
traced to the skilful manner in which it combined the interests
and conciliated the prejudices of the legislative and middle as
well as the executive class. The capitalist for the first time
saw himself painted as an injured victim, and presented with a
new field for ample profits; the ratepayer was charmed at the
idea of getting rid of an unlimited number of paupers; the
educated gentleman hoped to live on his 20,000 with all the
state, dignity, and luxury, physical and intellectual, that a
landed estate of £100,000 confers in England or Scotland. The
adventurous of the middle class dwelt on the charms of
distinction which would be open to them in a new colony; while to
ardent politicians and essayists, who in 1830 were for the most
part deeply dissatisfied with all our ancient institutions, the
idea of becoming founders and modellers of a model commonwealth
was truly delightful. Even the government was eventually
conciliated by the prospect of additional patronage which a new
colony presented.</p>
<p>In 1831 Major Bacon, a fellow-soldier in the Spanish Legion
with Colonel Wakefield, brother to the theorist, appears to have
opened negotiations at the Colonial Office, then under Lord
Goderich, for establishing a chartered colony in some part of
Australia; and in 1832 these negotiations had so far progressed
that a provisional committee of the South Australian Land Company
had been formed, with Colonel Torrens, then one of the
proprietors of the <i>Globe</i> newspaper, as its chairman, with
a proposed capital of £50,000.</p>
<p>In a letter dated 9th July, 1832, Colonel Torrens transmitted
a draft of the charter suggested by his committee, and drawn
under the instructions of Mr. Wakefield. On perusing this draft
Lord Goderich curtly closed the negotiation, on the ground that
"it would virtually transfer to the company the sovereignty of a
vast unexplored territory; that it would encroach upon the limits
of the existing colonies of New South Wales and Western
Australia; that the charter would invest the company, with powers
of legislation, of erecting courts, of appointing judges, of
raising and commanding militia; that all the powers of the
company, involving in their practical effects the sovereign
dominion of the whole territory, would be transferred to a
popular assembly, which would be to erect within the British
monarchy a government purely republican; and that the company
would be receivers of large sums of money, for the due
application of which they do not propose to give any specific
security."</p>
<p>When the promoters offered to modify their plan they were
informed, "that the views entertained by the proposed company are
not sufficiently precise and determined to lead his lordship to
apprehend that any advantage will arise from continuing a
correspondence that has for some time been going on."</p>
<p>In 1833 another association was formed, and the chairman, W.
W. Whitmore, Esq., M.P., opened negotiations with the present
Earl of Derby, then Under Secretary for the Colonies. He proposed
to found a colony on the site where it was eventually planted, to
sell land at 5s. an acre ("this will ensure the concentration of
settlers in proportion to the price at which land is sold"), and
devote the proceeds to the conveyance of young pauper labourers
of both sexes in equal numbers. The company to have a million
acres at 5s. an acre. "On this land they will perform such works
as they may deem expedient, with a view to attract population
thereto, while government will sell in an entirely unimproved
state the land not purchased by the company to any individuals
desirous of purchasing it."</p>
<p>This association, which contemplated fame and patronage rather
than profit, included George Grote, the eminent historian of
Greece; William Hutt, afterwards Governor of Western Australia;
Henry Bulwer, since an Ambassador and K.C.B.; Colonel Torrens; H.
G. Ward, since Governor of the Ionian Islands and K.C.B.; J. A.
Roebuck; Sir William Molesworth; Benjamin Hawes, since Colonial
Under Secretary; and Edward Strutt, since Chief Commissioner of
Railways.</p>
<p>This negotiation also failed. Mr. Gibbon Wakefield's charter
was not approved.</p>
<p>While approving of the plan of colonisation suggested as
regarded the disposal of land, Mr. Secretary Stanley insisted
that the government of the colony should be left in the hands of
the crown until such tune as it was able to govern itself.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Letter from John Lefevre, Esq., to W. W.
Whitmore, Esq., M.P., dated Downing-street, 17 March, 1834.]</p>
<p>After receiving this communication the South Australian
Association decided to continue their operations for the purpose
of forming a crown colony, provided that, by Act of Parliament,
provision were made for the permanent establishment of the mode
of disposing of waste land, and of the purchase-money of such
land, devised by Mr. Gibbon Wakefield.</p>
<p>Before the negotiation concluded Mr. Stanley resigned. Mr.
Spring Rice (now Lord Monteagle) became Secretary for the
Colonies. Under his administration an act was passed, in the
session of 1834, substantially embodying the terms agreed upon
with Mr. Stanley, by which the present province of South
Australia was established, the minimum price of land fixed at
12s. an acre, and the business of colonisation was placed in the
hands of a body of commissioners.</p>
<p>Lord Aberdeen having become Secretary for the Colonies, eight
commissioners were selected from the members of the South
Australian Association, and gazetted May, 1835, Colonel Torrens
being appointed chairman, because, as he stated in his letter of
application, he had "more knowledge of the object and principles
of the proposed colony than any of the other gentlemen willing to
act."</p>
<p>It is important to note that, although the Colonial Office
refused to permit the foundation of a chartered colony, in which
the government and responsibility would have been in the hands of
the colonisers, from first to last the personal friends and
pupils of Mr. Wakefield had the sole control of every arrangement
and the selection of every officer, and that every step was taken
under the advice of Mr. Gibbon Wakefield, who was a constant
attendant at the rooms of the association in the Adelphi.</p>
<p>The commissioners first offered the post of governor to the
present distinguished General (then Colonel) Charles James
Napier; but on being refused a small body of troops as police,
and power to draw on the British government for money in case of
need, he declined the dangerous honour, observing, with wise
prescience, "While sufficient security exists for the supply of
labour in the colony, and even <i>forces</i> that supply, there
does not appear to be any security that the supply of capital
will be sufficient to employ that labour." Thus South Australia
lost an active governor, and India obtained a great general. Of
two governors subsequently appointed, one was compelled to
overdraw £400,000, and the next obtained a company of soldiers in
lieu of an expensive police. The commissioners then selected as
governor Captain Hindmarsh, R.N., a distinguished naval-officer,
now Sir John Hindmarsh, Governor of Heligoland, and Colonel Light
as chief officer of the survey department; Mr. Fisher, as
resident commissioner; Mr. Robert Gouger, the editor of the
"Letter from Sydney" and secretary of the South Australian
Association, as colonial secretary&mdash;in all seventeen
appointments, including two attorneys, and an unsuccessful
merchant, "who had been found useful to the commission in selling
land and raising money." The parties selected seem to have been
studiously chosen for their innocence of all colonial, official,
and agricultural experience.</p>
<p>While the political steps for founding the model colony were
progressing, means for agitating the public mind in favour of
emigration, on the new principle, to the unknown territory
selected by the South Australian Association had not been
neglected.</p>
<p>The theory propounded in the "Letter from Sydney" had been
repeated and enlarged upon in a work called "England and
America," and in a multitude of pamphlets, reviews in newspapers,
speeches, and lectures. The active world began to believe that a
political philosopher's stone had been discovered.</p>
<p>A newspaper, the <i>South Australian Gazette</i>, was
published in London, with the view of being transplanted to the
new colony as soon as a hut could be found for its reception;
while the most influential daily and weekly organs re-echoed the
statements and conclusions which received the admiring assent of
all parties. Anything in the shape of opposition, or even
doubtful criticism, from persons of colonial experience, was
greeted with the utmost degree of scorn and contempt. They were
hissed down, unheard, as the most stupid or jealously envious of
mortals. The friends of Mr. Wakefield's theory had, from the
first taken it for granted that nothing but the basest motives
could induce any one to hesitate in accepting their panacea for
colonial ills, and they had the same advantage in attacking the
Colonial Office that a quack like Morison or Holloway has in
ridiculing a venerable, high-charging, pill-and-potion,
bleed-and-blister practitioner of the old bag-wig school.</p>
<p>A small book, published in 1834, entitled "The New British
Province of South Australia, with an account of the Principles,
Objects, Plan, and Prospects of the colony," one of scores of the
same tendency which appeared about the same time, is a favourable
and temperate specimen and the ingenious literary agitation which
Mr. Wakefield perfected, if he did not invent. This work, adorned
with maps, a picture of a bay, with palm trees and an emu,
commences with an extract from one of Archbishop Whately's
speeches, which now sounds excessively absurd, but which was then
received with enthusiasm:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"A colony so founded would fairly represent English
society: every new comer would have his own class to fall into,
and to whatever class he belonged he would find its relation to
the others, and the support derived from the others much the same
as in the parent country. There would be little more revolting to
the feelings of an emigrant than if he had merely shifted his
residence from Sussex to Cumberland or Devonshire."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>And then, after devoting many pages to disparaging all other
colonies and systems of colonisation, and promising a supply of
labour and a state of refinement equal to that of an old colony,
a considerable space is devoted to a description of the proposed
country, particularly "Kangaroo Island," and its resources, with
a list of <i>probable</i> exports. Seldom have more errors been
propagated in so few pages, in so formal, so positive, and so
pompous a manner. Out of five pages of tabulated exports only
one, "wool," has been obtained, and that, not as promised, in
greater, but in less quantities than in the older colonies. The
means of communication promised by the seacoast, the Lake
Alexandria, and the River Murray, remain unused to this hour, and
Kangaroo Island is still a solitary waste.</p>
<p>A day in Adelaide at any time, from the founding of the city
down to the time when the last ship left the port, would show how
absurdly the following premises have been falsified:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"The price of land will take out the labourers free
of cost to their employer, and will enable him to retain their
services. It will be the first colony combining plenty of labour
and plenty of land." "The large produce of industry, divided in
the shape of high profits and high wages, will not only make
living high, but will cause the interest of money to be high,
<i>and will thus enable persons owning, money, without engaging
in any work</i>, to obtain much larger and more effective incomes
than their property yields in England; and will furnish a demand
for such persons as surveyors, architects, engineers, clerks,
teachers, lawyers, and clergymen."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>These were the inducements held out with eminent success to
tempt men most unfit for the toil of early colonisation to
emigrate to a colony which was to be founded, not by slow
degrees, but complete. The land was to be sold <i>in England</i>,
at such a fixed price as would, by preventing labourers from
becoming landowners "too soon," preserve a "hired labour price,"
and secure high profits on good wages. The proceeds of the land
sold were to be applied to supplying labourers with free
passages, and thus a complete section of all the ranks and
classes composing the parent state was to be transplanted, full
grown, to the antipodes.</p>
<p>In the commencement the commissioners found difficulty in
selling the quantity of land and raising a sufficient amount of
the loan of £200,000, at £10 per cent., authorised by the
government. But eventually these difficulties were overcome by
the active assistance of Mr. G. F. Angas, and Mr. John Wright,
the once eminent and afterwards notorious banker of Covent
Garden.</p>
<p>Mr. Angas resigned his post as commissioner, and formed the
South Australian Company, which commenced operations by
purchasing a large quantity of land from the commissioners with
certain special privileges. A sum of £30,000 completed the
preliminary financial operations, and the first part of the
colonising career of South Australia commenced.</p>
<p>The South Australian Company, which had obtained special
privileges in consideration of their large and early purchase,
lost no time in sending out a pioneer expedition, with emigrants
and officers, to make preparations for carrying on every kind of
pursuit considered likely to be profitable in a
colony&mdash;farming, sheep-feeding, banking, building, and
whaling. We may mention here that after an experience of eleven
years the company have found reason to subside into the humble
but more profitable position of absentee landholders and land
jobbers.</p>
<p>Colonel Light was despatched by the commissioners in March,
1836, and a surveying staff and a few emigrants; and when he
arrived at the appointed rendezvous in Nepean Bay, on the 19th
August, he found three vessels of the South Australian Company,
which had brought a body of emigrants who were settled on
Kangaroo Island; and in November the Africaine arrived with the
colonial secretary, <i>a banking association, and a
newspaper</i>.</p>
<p>In July Captain Hindmarsh, the governor, sailed in the
Buffalo, a vessel of war, with a number of emigrants.</p>
<p>All this was done before the commissioners had received any
report as to the suitability of the district selected for
supporting emigrants. Kangaroo Island, which had figured largely
in prospectuses and speeches, was found to be unfit for
colonisation, after time and money had been wasted by emigrants
and the company in building and clearing.</p>
<p>Colonel Light landed in the Gulf of St. Vincent, and after a
survey fixed upon the site of the present city of Adelaide for
the capital, and the present Port Adelaide for its harbour. It
was then a narrow, rather shallow creek, about as wide as the
Thames at Richmond, leading out of St. Vincent's Gulf. The
landing was in a mangrove swamp, seven miles from the intended
capital. Wharves, deep dredging, a solid road, and other
improvements have now transformed the mangrove creek into a good
harbour, not inconveniently distant from the capital, to which it
will be soon united by a railway.</p>
<p>Governor Hindmarsh arrived on 28th of December, 1836, read his
commission under a gum tree, in presence of about two hundred
emigrants and officials; and then, looking round, felt extremely
dissatisfied with the selection made by the resident commissioner
and the surveyor-general. That he should have been dissatisfied
with a selection which placed the capital in a picturesque but
hot valley far from a port, and without the use of a navigable
river, and that he should as a sailor have been forcibly
impressed with the fearful cost of landing and conveying cargoes
to the interior from such a harbour, is not extraordinary;
nevertheless experience has proved that the site was as good as
any that could have been chosen, and art has corrected the
defects of nature. Governor Hindmarsh attempted to change the
site of Adelaide. Differences of a serious character arose
between him and the resident commissioner: the colony became
divided into two parties, one of which supported the governor and
the other the resident commissioner. Both parties were greatly to
blame. Lord Glenelg settled the question by. acceding to the
request of the commissioners and recalling Captain Hindmarsh. In
the sequel the site of the capital to which Captain Hindmarsh had
objected was retained, and almost all the officials, from whom he
had experienced most vexatious and insolent opposition, were
found either incompetent or corrupt, and dismissed by his
successor.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The most serious evils that befel the South
Australian colonists arose from the precipitancy with which
emigrants were sent out, before the surveyor-general had reported
whether the country was fit for settlement, and before any
preparation had been made, by roads, wharves, barracks,
conveyances, surveys, and importation of live stock, for
employing or feeding emigrants, But it seems part of the system
to care rather for producing a sensation of doing business in
England than for the welfare of the emigrants. The same error was
committed at Wellington, in New Zealand, where, with a shipload
of colonists going they knew not where, Colonel Wakefield was
obliged to settle at Wellington&mdash;a fine harbour shut out by
inaccessible mountains from the adjoining country. Even expensive
military roads have not yet opened out land enough to feed the
town population; and two secondary settlements at Wanganui,
distant 100 miles, and New Plymouth were formed in order to
obtain the quantity of land sold in England. On a second occasion
Nelson was chosen without proper survey, where, in order to find
land enough, two thousand colonists are obliged to spread over
150 miles of coast. Even in founding Canterbury, Mr. Wakefield
had influence enough to persuade the directors to send out, at an
enormous useless extra expense, a fleet of four large ships half
filled, to the great inconvenience of the first colonists, in
order to make a sensation in the English newspapers. The
expedient failed.]</p>

<br>
<small>ADELAIDE FROM "THE HILLS."</small></p>
<br>
<p>To replace Captain Hindmarsh the commissioners recommended and
secured the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel George Gawler. At
the same time that Colonel Gawler was appointed governor he was
also made resident commissioner&mdash;vice Mr.
Fisher,&mdash;dismissed and thus united in his own person all the
administrative powers of the colony.</p>
<p>In order to obtain money to commence operations, before the
colony had been surveyed or even settled, the commissioners
issued "preliminary orders," as a bonus to the first purchasers
and colonists, at £72 12s. each, which entitled the purchaser to
select, in a rotation settled by lottery, 120 acres of country
land, and one acre in the intended capital of the intended
colony. This capital city, before discovery or survey, was
settled by the commissioners to consist of 1,200 acres, or nearly
nine square miles&mdash;a space sufficient to accommodate the
population of Westminster. As soon as the capital, Adelaide, had
been selected and mapped, the holders of preliminary orders,
forming the first body of colonists, selected their sections, and
the whole surplus was put up for auction to the colonists, "as a
reward for their enterprise," and sold at an average rate of £2
per acre. Thus, more than ten times the space that has ever been
required was turned into and perpetually dedicated to building
land. From that moment the great object of the first colonists
became to puff, magnify, and sell to future colonists their
building land in Adelaide. No crop was so profitable as land left
in a state of nature, but called and sold for a street.</p>
<p>The first operation having been performed, by which the future
site of what was intended to be a great city had been transferred
into the hands of a few persons, chiefly consisting of the
friends of the commissioners and the officials of the South
Australian Company, the next was to sell as much land as possible
in England, by giving English purchasers a decided advantage over
those who, nevertheless intending to emigrate, declined to buy a
pig in a poke.</p>
<p>Accordingly land orders were issued at 80 each, which entitled
the holder to select eighty acres of country land in the order
dictated by the date of payment. Thus, when any particularly
desirable plot of land was brought into the market, a speculation
arose to discover and purchase the oldest "order" in the colony.
A class of Adelaide brokers arose who dealt in and professed to
put a value on these "scrip," according to their respective
dates. Sometimes an emigrant who had been months in the colony
would be superseded by the holder of the land order of an
absentee sent at the latest moment by ship letter. It was a
foreshadowing of the railway stagging of 1846, and a revival of
the famous days of the South Sea Bubble. On one occasion the
supposed discovery of a lead mine, under an eighty-acre section,
sent up the earliest-dated order to a premium of £500. After all
there was no lead mine; but the lucky purchaser, being in command
of the market made use of a later order, and reserved his £500
prize for future use.</p>
<p>After five days of the week had been consumed by those who
purchased "land orders" in England in selecting the best
sections, on the sixth the colonising emigrant who had preferred
seeing before investing, or the frugal labourer who had saved
enough to work for himself on his own land, was allowed to take
his pick of the refuse. Such parties were required to send in a
sealed tender. A person tendering for several adjoining sections
had the preference over a person tendering for a single section.
Thus, in every way, the cultivating colonist was discouraged, and
land-jobbing speculation invited.</p>
<p>That no element of confusion might be wanting in the land
arrangements of the model colony, the commissioners devised, and
Mr. Wakefield approved, the "special survey system," which
enabled them to raise large sums of money, by offering special
privileges to capitalists; and it proved most effective in
England. Under this system a capitalist was entitled to have
15,000 acres surveyed in any part of the province, on condition
that he purchased not less than 4,000 acres at £1 an acre. In
South Australia, as in New South Wales, there is a great scarcity
of water, and good cultivable land lies only in patches
surrounded by other land which is, at best, only fit for pasture.
By judicious management the purchaser of a special survey could
command all the water, and all the pastoral advantages of 15,000
acres, by purchasing 4,000; the remainder, 11,000 acres, being
useless to any one else, fell naturally in his occupation, at an
average of 5s. 4d. an acre. To increase the mischief, purchasers
of special surveys were permitted to establish secondary towns,
in addition to Adelaide, which was twenty times too large for the
population; while the staff of surveyors were continually
interrupted in their regular work, to the great injury of
cultivating emigrants, in order to make these special surveys, at
an expense often exceeding the total value of the
purchase-money.</p>
<p>In a very short time all the good land in the neighbourhood of
217 Adelaide was monopolised by the absentee capitalists and
proprietors of the South Australian Company.</p>
<p>In a word, the whole system discouraged the proper pursuits of
colonists, and propagated a spirit of land-jobbing, which, by its
apparent profits, very soon infected the neighbouring colonies,
and bewildered and deceived the merchants, the legislature, and
the colonial department of Great Britain.</p>
<p>At an epoch in the existence of an infant state, when the
first settlers ought to consist of a few gardeners, a few
shepherds, a few farmers, and a few mechanics, with half a dozen
men of superior attainments and energy, and plenty of sheep and
cattle, and when a village with a wharf was all the town needed,
South Australia had nine square miles of building land, a bank,
two newspapers, and a population of speculative gentlemen. In
England, paragraphs carefully culled from South Australian land
sellers' newspapers were circulated as accompaniments to flaming
advertisements in the English press, with the lectures and
speeches of well-paid agents of the South Australian interest,
combined to raise the colonising speculations and movements to
fever pitch about the time that Colonel Gawler anchored in St.
Vincent's Gulf.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX.</h3>
<h4>COLONEL GAWLER'S GOVERNMENT.<br>
<br>
1838 TO 1841.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Colonel Gawler</span> arrived in South
Australia on the 13th October, 1838, and was recalled in May,
1841. Under his administration the colony attained the highest
state of external prosperity; the population quadrupled, the port
was filled with ships bringing imports and emigrants; public
buildings, shops, mansions, and paved roads were constructed on
land which four years previously had been desert; wharves and
warehouses on a swampy creek, which was converted into a
convenient port; ornamental gardens were laid out, farms were
cultivated, live stock was imported by thousands, the interior
explored, and the whole colony rendered more familiarly and
favourably known to the intellectual portion of the British
community than any other colony; and under Colonel Gawler the
land sales ceased, capital and labour emigrated, insolvency was
universal, and the colony, loaded with public and private debt,
collapsed more rapidly than it had risen.</p>
<p>The powerful party whose pecuniary interests and personal
pride, as colonising philosophers, are alike concerned in
upholding the system on which South Australia was founded, have
long been in the habit of attributing the rise of that colony to
the merits of their system, and its fall to the extravagance of
Colonel Crawler; and they have passed uncontradicted, because
actual colonists are ill represented in Parliament and the press,
and it has not been worth the while of the public to dive into
blue books or examine colonial evidence for the truth.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This, true when written, has ceased to be true
in 1853, since the failure of Canterbury colony&mdash;a failure
predicted by the author.]</p>
<p>A very slight examination of the history of South Australia
will show that it was what is called the extravagance of Colonel
Gawler which caused those sales of land, that export of
emigrants, that speculation in building lots and houses which was
supposed to be prosperity. If a million sterling had been at the
disposal of the governor at the time when, to speak commercially,
the colonial government stopped payment, the mania for
land-buying might have been continued some time longer, but it
must have stopped sooner or later, just as the railway-scrip
mania came to an end, because the purchasers and sellers were
producing nothing; and no amount of imported population and
capital could have made the colony produce enough to pay for its
consumption until time had been given to raise some staple
article saleable in a foreign market. Wool cannot be produced,
like calico or cloth, by steam power; for agricultural produce
there was no foreign demand worth mentioning; the existence of
mineral wealth was not suspected. When Colonel Gawler resigned
his office into the hands of his successor, South Australia was
in debt about £400,000, on account of the colonial government;
the private debts of the colonists to English merchants were at
least as much more. The utmost extent of excess in Colonel
Gawler's expenditure was £20,000, or five per cent. on the
expenses.</p>
<p>It always takes a considerable time to inoculate the English
people with new ideas. About the time that Captain Hindmarsh was
recalled and Colonel Gawler sailed, the fruits of skilful
agitation began to be reaped by the South Australian
Commissioners. No unfavourable accounts of the new colony were
allowed to appear in any organ of influence; flourishing reports
of the beauty, the fertility, and the commercial importance of
the new city were industriously circulated. Colonel Torrens, in
lectures he condescended to deliver, stated and believed that the
situation of the city of Adelaide would give it the same
importance with respect to the valley of the Murray that New
Orleans held with respect to the valley of the
Mississippi:&mdash;the Murray, which in 1851 had not yet been
navigated by anything beyond a whaleboat, and which a range of
lofty mountains divides from Adelaide! An influential agent in
the South Australian interest not only produced a
magnificently-coloured plan of the new city, divided into streets
and squares, but, by a further stroke of imagination, anchored a
400 ton ship in the Torrens, opposite Government House&mdash;the
River Torrens being a chain of pools in which the most desperate
suicide would ordinarily have difficulty in drowning himself, and
across which a child may generally step dryshod!</p>
<p>Thus land was sold, and emigrants were shipped off before the
commissioners had time to receive further accounts from their new
and trusted governor and commissioner.</p>
<p>Colonel Gawler being an amiable, enthusiastic, simple-minded,
yet ambitious man, was dazzled with the idea of becoming the
founder of a great, civilised, self-supporting community. He
accepted the theories of Mr. Wakefield as solemn, immutable
truths, and the calculations of the commissioners as the
emanations of the highest financial ability. Confiding in the
private assurances of the commissioners, he was most bitterly and
cruelly deceived.</p>
<p>Under the original plan of the colony the commissioners had
calculated that an annual sum of £10,000, over and above any
revenue to be derived from customs or local taxation, would be
sufficient to defray all the govermental expenses of South
Australia. This calculation was founded on what they hoped to be
able to raise, and not on the necessities of the case. In order
to make it fit they fixed on an arbitrary number of officials at
arbitrary salaries.</p>
<p>The statements made in a despatch written by Colonel Gawler,
immediately after his arrival, show that if he had been less
zealous to carry out the views of the commissioners and more
cautious about his own personal interests, he would have at once
brought the progress of colonisation to a stand-still, strictly
followed his written instructions, and retired with his private
fortune uninjured, to his own profession.</p>
<p>He found the treasury empty&mdash;the accounts in confusion.
Twelve thousand pounds, being two thousand pounds more than the
whole amount authorised to be drawn for in England in the year,
had been drawn in the first six months; a large expense was
required for the support of emigrants sick of fever and
dysentery; provisions, wages, and house rent were enormously
high; custom-houses, police-stations, a gaol, and offices for
transaction of public business were urgently required; a police
establishment, at colonial wages, in the absence of a military
force, was indispensable; the commissioners in their calculations
had omitted to provide for a postmaster, a sheriff, or a gaoler
for letters, debtors, or criminals; the surveys were seriously in
arrear; the head of the staff and all his attendants had
resigned; the late resident commissioner and accountant-general,
the colonial treasurer, and several other officers were found
insubordinate, irregular in their accounts, and grossly
inefficient; it was necessary to supersede two of them
peremptorily&mdash;almost immediately; all officials were
dissatisfied with low salaries in the face of the high prices of
provisions, house rent, &amp;c.; Governor Gawler himself, with
Mrs. Gawler, his children, private secretary, and servants, was
compelled to occupy a small hut, and expend £1,800 a year whilst
receiving a salary of £800. With this imperfect machinery, and an
empty treasury, a population of some four or five thousand souls,
partly encamped on the site of the city of Adelaide, and partly
dispersed in pastoral pursuits over a tract of country one
hundred miles long by forty miles broad, instead of being,
according to the theories of the commissioners, concentrated on
ten square miles, engaged in reproducing English agriculture, had
to be governed, customs dues and debts had to be levied,
criminals imprisoned, and aborigines repressed.</p>
<p>As to the prospects of the colony, and character of pursuits
of the colonists, the inspector of the Australasian Bank at
Sydney wrote to his Directors in October, 1818, about the time
Governor Gawler landed:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"I venture to express my fears that the price
received for the sale of land will be found insufficient to pay
for the transplantation and government of emigrants; and, unless
funds be provided by the British government, it will be
impossible to provide for the administration of police and law.
There appears also to have been a great want of experience and
decision in directing the energies of the colonists to that
source from which alone they can hope to rise to wealth or
prevent themselves from sinking into poverty, until an article of
export be produced in considerable quantity; as otherwise the
funds of the colonists must be expended in paying for articles of
import and luxuries considered as necessaries of life. <i>Wool is
the only article of export that can be produced</i>, and on this
subject the colonists seem as supine as they have been <i>eager
to purchase town allotments and build houses</i>, giving the
place what seems to me a false appearance of commercial
prosperity. Had it been left to me I should have delayed
establishing a branch bank until I could be sure there were at
least 100,000 sheep in the settlement, and that provision was
made for the efficient administration of the law." *</blockquote>
<br>
<p class="foot">[* Report of House of Commons on South Australia,
1841, p. 146.]</p>
<p>The new governor, full of colonising enthusiasm and innocent
of colonial or commercial experience, was dazzled and deceived by
the building activity which had excited the serious apprehensions
of the experienced bank manager. He found a. large body of
educated, apparently intelligent men, who had encamped on the
site of the city of Adelaide, all hopeful, active, speculating,
dealing with each other and with each party of newly-arrived
emigrants, full of magnificent plans for every sort of
investment, in markets, warehouses, arcades, ship-building, and
whaling. A bit of painted board nailed to a tree created a
Wakefield, a Torrens, an Angas, or Whit-more street. All the
notabilities of the South Australian interest were thus
immortalised. Each speculator, having so large a space to deal
with, endeavoured to draw the tide of trade or fashion into his
own locality, and thus, instead of one compact village, as near
as possible to the port, tents, wooden huts, pisé huts, wooden
houses imported from England, shops of slabs, brick, and stone,
and elegant cottages of gentility, surrounded by iron rails, were
scattered over a vast park of 1,130 acres.</p>
<p>Those who had not been able to secure town lots at prices to
their mind proceeded into the suburbs, where at one time, with
the aid of surveyors' pegged lines, not less than thirty villages
were founded, for sale to those who could not afford to give the
city price; others were building mansions, laying out pleasure
grounds, and even contemplating deer parks. The climate was
delightful, the valley of the Torrens fertile; and emigrants of
capital poured in, burning to commence realising the golden
dreams they had enjoyed during a three months' voyage.</p>
<p>Colonel Crawler was carried away by the stream. The very con
fusion in which he found public business, the inefficiency of all
the officers selected by the commissioners, the backward state of
the surveys, were to a certain extent an encouragement; because
he sanguinely contemplated that, if so much had been done under
no system, or the worst possible system of administration when no
accounts were kept&mdash;when the governor and the resident
commissioner held rival public meetings, and the colonial
secretary and colonial treasurer fought in the streets,&mdash;how
much more might be done under an orderly, regular government,
such as he lost no time in establishing.</p>
<p>He proceeded to supersede the incompetent officials, to bring
all the government business into a regular form, to press on the
surveys, and to make proper arrangements for the reception of the
emigrants into barracks, and the numerous sick of ship-fever and
dysentery into an hospital. In order to obtain a revenue from
customs dues, to keep down illicit distillation, and protect the
public from criminals, it was necessary, as Colonel Napier had
foreseen, to raise a police. As labourers were worth from 10s. to
15s. a day, and indifferent horses cost 50 each, this was an
expensive affair; but, by giving a tasteful uniform, and making
the appointment rather honourable, he succeeded in obtaining a
highly respectable body of men, including some poor gentlemen, at
5s. a day.</p>
<p>The port on Colonel Gawler's arrival was a narrow swamp,
through which, for seven miles, emigrants dragged their luggage
and merchandise. Under his arrangements a road was constructed,
and wharves and warehouses erected. He built a government-house
of no extravagant pretensions, but which, nevertheless, cost,
from the price of labour and materials, £20,000; and he also
built custom-houses, police-stations, and other public buildings,
which were indispensable for transacting public business. He
expended a large sum in protecting and endeavouring to civilise
the aborigines. He contributed to two expeditions which were
unsuccessfully made by Mr. Eyre in search of tracts of fertile
country. To every charitable claim his purse was open; while his
hospitalities were on a liberal scale.</p>
<p>The result of his measures was to give an extraordinary
impetus to the apparent prosperity of the colony. The brilliant
reports of public and private buildings in progress, building
land sold at £500 and even £1,000 an acre, of balls, fêtes,
pic-nics, horticultural shows, dexterously reproduced in England,
tempted men of fortune to emigrate, capitalists to invest, and
merchants and manufacturers to forward goods of all kinds on
credit. Port Adelaide was crowded with shipping, which discharged
living and dead cargoes, and departed in ballast. When 14,000
colonists had arrived, in the fourth year after the foundation,
scarcely a vestige of an export had been produced. The land sales
and the custom-house receipts rose to enormous amounts.</p>
<p>In the midst of a career of infatuation, by which some half
dozen money lenders realised fortunes, and hundreds were entirely
ruined, there were men of considerable fortune who endeavoured to
realise the Utopia they had been taught to dream in England, and
introduce the comforts and the scientific cultivation of an
English country gentleman, as sketched in Mr. Wakefield's letter
from Sydney. These gentlemen purchased what in English eyes
appeared considerable tracts of land; loaded ships with
furniture, with curious, useless agricultural implements, with
live stock of choice breeds; brought domestic servants,
labourers, and even tenants, and landed intent on making,
according to the cant cry of the hour, the "desert blossom like
the rose."</p>
<p>The example of one gentleman, whose name it would be cruel to
mention, will exemplify the case of scores of his class, although
less wealthy, who sank and died without notice in other colonies,
or in England. Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; possessed an English
estate which brought him in about £1,000 a year: fascinated by
Mr. Gibbon Wakefield's writings, he sold his estate, and landed
in South Australia with an extensive land order, built a house of
no great size or comfort at a vast expense, fenced in a farm, and
began to cultivate; but the cheap labour promised in the
commissioners' pamphlets was no more forthcoming than the roads.
He soon found that he was sowing shillings to reap halfpence.
After spending a great deal of capital he gave up farming in
disgust, and went to live in Adelaide: there, thrown constantly
among the company of speculators, having a considerable balance
at his banker's, he was inclined to do as everybody did, and
speculate. He lost everything, at middle age returned home with
his family penniless, and, after living a few years dependent on
the bounty of his relations, died broken-hearted, a victim of the
"sufficient price" delusion.</p>
<p>Among the successful there were scarcely any of the
head-working, white-handed class, but a number of hard-working,
frugal men, who, landing without a penny, accumulated enough by
labour to purchase a good eighty-acre section, and there, by
growing vegetables and wheat, rearing pigs and poultry, with the
help of their wives and families, throve steadily, and made
money, in spite of the system which was intended to retain them
for an indefinite time as labourers at some three shillings a
day. These people often derived considerable advantage from
sections of land adjoining their own being the property of
absentees. On these sections they were able to pasture their live
stock without expense. Where labourers could not afford to buy a
whole section they clubbed together and divided one; for free men
will have land whenever agriculture is the only manufacture, and
no protective laws can prevent them. It was these cottier farmers
and a few sheep squatters who saved the colony from being totally
abandoned when the inevitable crisis came.</p>
<p>A Scotch gentleman of ancient lineage and no fortune, in every
respect the converse of Mr. B., afforded an instance of what may
be done in a colony by industrious hard work, with the help of a
large family, without that capital which, according to theorists,
it is indispensable that a landowner should possess. He arrived
in the colony very early, the owner of a single eighty-acre
section, with twelve children, one half of whom were stout,
well-grown lads and lasses: his whole property consisted of a
little furniture, a few Highland implements, a gun or two, a very
little ready money, and several barrels of oatmeal and biscuit.
His section had been selected for him previous to his arrival. It
lay on the other side of a steep range of hills, over which no
road had then been made, ten miles from the town. He lost no time
and spent no money in refreshing or relaxing in Adelaide; he
found out a fellow-countryman who lent him a team of oxen,
dragged his goods over the hills to his land, and encamped the
first night on the ground, under a few blankets and canvass
spread on the brush. The next and successive days the family
worked at cutting trees; there was timber plenty for building a
house. This house, situated on the slope of a hill, consisted of
one long, low, wooden room, surrounded by a dry ditch to drain
off the rain, and divided into partitions by blankets. The river
lay below: any water needed was fetched in a bucket by one of the
young ladies. A garden, in which all manner of vegetables,
including tobacco and water melons, soon grew, was laid out
almost as soon as the house; an early investment was made in
poultry, they requiring no other food than the grasshoppers and
grass-seeds on the waste land round. Until the poultry gave a
crop of eggs and chickens the guns of the lads supplied plenty of
quail, ducks, and parrots. In due time a crop of maize, of wheat,
and of oats was got in. Before the barrels of oatmeal were
exhausted, eggs, chickens, potatoes, kale, and maize afforded
ample sustenance, and something to send to market. Labour cost
nothing, fuel nothing, rent nothing, keeping up appearances
nothing; no one dressed on week days in broadcloth, except the
head of the house. First a few goats, and then a cow, eventually
a fair herd of stock, were accumulated. Butter and vegetables
found their way to Adelaide; and, while the kid-glove gentry were
ruining themselves, the bare-legged boys of the Highland
gentleman were independent, if not rich. The daughters, who were
pretty, proud, and useful, have married well. In another
generation families like this will be among the wealthiest in the
colony.</p>
<p>Now, it is certain that every shilling taken from industrious
settlers like this Scotch family, under pretence of supplying
labour, was money very unprofitably invested, as it would have
fructified more rapidly in their own hard hands.</p>
<p>A lady, who landed at Port Adelaide a few months after the
governor, in a MS. letter describes the then "dreary appearance
of the shores; the anchoring of the ship in a narrow creek,
where, as far as the eye could reach, a mangrove swamp extended;
disembarking from a small boat into the arms of long shoremen
upon a damp mudbank, under a persecuting assault of musquitoes."
On this mudbank lay heaps of goods of all descriptions, half
covered with sand and saturated with salt water, broken chests of
tea and barrels of flour, cases of hardware, furniture of all
kinds, pianos and empty plate-chests, ploughs and
thrashing-machines. A little further, at the commencement of the
"muddy track which led to Adelaide, bullock-drays stood ready to
hire for conveying our baggage. The lowest charge for a load was
10. All along the side of the track were strewn baggage and
broken conveyances, abandoned in despair by their owners. We
stopped at a small public-house to get a little refreshment. For
a cup of tea, with brown sugar, bread, and oily butter full of
insects, we paid 4s. 6d. each. The butter seemed spread with a
thumb."</p>
<p>"Our troubles partly vanished when we reached the beautiful
site of Adelaide, where it almost seemed as if a large party of
ladies and gentlemen playing at gipsying had encamped. This was
the third removal of some who had pitched tents on Kangaroo
Island, then built huts in Holdfast Bay, and finally took up
their abode in the city of Adelaide. Several times, before the
small, bright green, highly ornamented wooden summer house which
had been engaged for us, our carriage had like to have been upset
over stumps and logs. Every one we met seemed in the highest
spirits; and it was more like a walk in Kensington Gardens than
in a colony scarcely two years old."</p>
<p>This bit of contemporary description affords a key to much
that is singular and contradictory in the early accounts of the
foundation of South Australia. Nat Lee, the mad poet,
sings&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">"There is a joy in madness none
but madmen know."</p>
<p>and there was a charm about the gipsy encampment of Adelaide,
with its wild speculation, perpetual excitement, liberal
hospitality and charity, constant succession of new faces,
splendid luxuries, and curious shifts, to which the survivors
look back with the feelings of a mariner to the months he spent
with jolly companions on a desert island, with plenty of turtles
and plenty of rum puncheons&mdash;the difference being, that in
the one case the shipwreck preceded, and in the other followed,
the jollification.</p>
<p>Governor Gawler held a little court, which was graced by the
magnificent uniforms of the officers of the volunteer corps, a
corps which consisted of some two dozen officers, from a cornet
to a brigade-major, and four or five privates. There were
courtiers, too, and ladies in plumes and great airs; there were
fashionables, and exclusives held to be the <i>crême de la
crême</i>; there was an aristocracy composed of the principal
officials; there were balls given, to be invited to which great
manoeuvres were practised. It was a life like that of one of the
little gambling courts and watering-places of Germany, with more
heartiness, in consequence of the constant arrival of friends and
victims from England. The town lots of Adelaide formed the great
<i>rouge-et-noir</i> table. The climate rendered out-of-door life
delightful, the imaginary streets swarmed with well-dressed
crowds; so much really good society, so many fashionable men, had
never before been found in a colony; every one fancied himself
the hero of a great enterprise, and enjoyed all the pleasures of
gambling, while dreaming that he was helping to found an
empire.</p>
<p>In the morning the men dashed about on horses, in dog-carts,
barouches, and four-in-hands, which cost fabulous sums, in search
of eligible sections and sites for villages. In the evenings
grand dinners were given in tents and huts, where champagne,
hock, burgundy, and every luxury that could be preserved in a tin
case abounded; fashionable dance music and the songs of Kossini
and Donizetti resounded from the cottages of the "great world;"
and at cock-crow beaux in beards and white waistcoats, "half
savage, half soft," might be met picking their way, in the
thinnest, shiniest boots, through the dust or mud of a projected
crescent or arcade. There was scandal written and spoken;
political intrigue; a court party and an opposition, with each a
newspaper; and everybody flattered everybody else that building,
dining, dancing, drinking, writing, and speechifying, "was doing
the heroic work of colonisation."</p>
<p>Young men of spirit were not satisfied to retire into the bush
and look after a flock of silly sheep while it was possible to
buy a section of land at £1 an acre, give it a fine name as a
village site, sell the same thing at £10 an acre, for a bill the
bank would discount, and live in style at the Southern Cross
Hotel; for when a man had made such a speculation he could not,
and did not, do less than invite a party of new-made friends to
celebrate his good fortune by a dinner, a ball, or a pic-nic,
with a few cases of champagne imported by the merchant on
credit.</p>
<p>At this period a romantic air was infused into the simplest
transactions. For instance, in the old colony exploring
expeditions had been undertaken either by a government surveyor,
who marched out from some remote station without any special
demonstration, or by a squatter who, with a friend or two, a
stockman, and perhaps a couple of black boys, all on horseback,
set out as quickly as possible to find new pastures for his
stock. In South Australia they managed things very differently.
Mr. V. Eyre having undertaken to explore the interior of the
province, on the day appointed for his setting out a grand
entertainment was given, over which the governor presided. At the
close of an affecting speech a band of young ladies clothed in
white garments marched up the room, and presented, amid the
cheers of the men and the sobs of the women, a banner which they
worked, to be planted on the limits of his proposed
discovery.</p>
<p>Mr. Eyre's journey, and a second expedition, proved the
hopeless barrenness of a great part of the province. He
afterwards became lieutenant-governor of the small settlement of
Nelson, in New Zealand. It is rather curious that two gallant but
unsuccessful exploring expeditions, that of Mr. Eyre and that of
Lieutenant (now Sir George) Grey, should have led to the
appointment of two governors.</p>
<p>During the administration of Colonel Crawler important
assistance was afforded to the colonists by the arrival of the
overlanders, who, led by love of adventure and hope of gain,
found their way from the bush of New South Wales and Port
Phillip, across inhospitable deserts, over precipitous hills,
through dense forests, rivers, and swamps, and, in spite of
tribes of fiercely hostile savages, brought flocks of sheep and
"mobs" of cattle and horses to the South Australians, at a time
when butchers' meat was rising to famine price, when a good pair
of bullocks could earn 60 a week in working from the port to the
city, and horses which had arrived from Van Diemen's Land, after
a long voyage of alternate calms and adverse winds, mere
skeletons covered with sores, were sold as a favour at £100
each.</p>
<p>The overlanders saved the colony from total abandonment during
the first crash of insolvency. The strength of Australia is in
her pastures: sheep to the Australian, before the discovery of
copper and gold, were what the pine-tree was to the Highland
laird, who on his death-bed said to his son, "Jock, be aye
putting in a tree: it will be growing while ye are sleeping." The
natural pastures and the climate grow the wool, and men, women,
or children can be shepherds who have neither strength to fell
timber, nor power or skill to plough, to sow, or to thrash.
Besides, a pack of wool is always worth cash, while a bushel of
wheat in Australia may be worth 10s. one year and nothing the
next; in the worst of times ewes go on breeding and increasing,
and wethers boil down for tallow, while a field allowed to go out
of cultivation under an Australian climate, after devouring all
the capital spent on reclamation, very soon becomes as much waste
as before the plough turned the first furrow. The overlanders who
brought these invaluable animals were many of them men of
education: the enormous profits reaped by the first parties, in
spite of the loss of both men and beasts by drought and
skirmishes with the blacks, made the overland route a favourite
adventure with the young bushmen. They brought with them, as well
as live stock, "old hands," who taught the cockneys how to fell a
tree and make a fence, and sometimes gave the Gawler police a
good deal of trouble.</p>
<p>The gentlemen overlanders affected a banditti style of hair
and costume. They rode blood, or half-bred Arab horses, wore
broad-brimmed sombreros trimmed with fur and eagle plumes,
scarlet flannel shirts, broad belts filled with pistols, knives,
and tomahawks, tremendous beards, and moustachios. They generally
encamped and let their stock refresh about 100 miles from
Adelaide, and then rode on to strike a bargain with their anxious
customers. Before the journey became a matter of course, the
arrival of a band of these brown, bearded, banditti-looking
gentlemen created quite a sensation&mdash;something like the
arrival of a party of successful buccaneers in a quiet seaport,
with a cargo to sell, in old Dampier's time.</p>
<p>In a few days the stock was sold; the overland garments were
exchanged for the most picturesque and fashionable costume which
the best Hindley-street tailor "from Bond-street" could supply;
and then, with hair combed, brushed, oiled, and gracefully
arranged after Raphael or Vandyke, the overlander proceeded to
spend freely the money he had so hardly gained, and, as one of
the lions of the place, to cast into the shade the pert, smooth,
political economists and model colonists fresh from the
Adelphi.</p>
<p>New arrivals from England, fortunate enough to be admitted to
the delightful evening parties given by a lady of the "highest
ton," the leader of the Adelaidean fashion, were astonished when,
to fill up basso in an Italian piece, she called on a huge man
with brown hands, brown face, and a flowing beard, magnificently
attired, in whom they recognised the individual they had met the
day before in a torn flannel jersey, with a short black pipe in
his mouth.</p>
<p>The overlanders included every rank, from the emancipist to
the first-class Oxford man. By the end of 1840 they had
introduced nearly 50,000 sheep into the colony, and taught the
wiser colonists the necessity of looking to pastoral pursuits for
the safe investment of capital.</p>
<p>The trade of turning wild land worth a few shillings an acre
into building sections, to be sold at from four or five pounds to
one thousand pounds an acre, by the simple expedient of a few
pegs and a coloured plan, was too good to be monopolised by South
Australia. The government and private speculators followed the
ingenious example in New South Wales and Port Phillip; while in
England a dozen foolish or fraudulent schemes were started, under
the patronage of names as respectable as those who patronised the
South American mines of 1824, and the railway delusion of 1845,
for colonising New Zealand, the Chatham Islands, New Caledonia,
the Falkland Islands, and other countries having the inestimable
advantage of being very distant and almost unknown; all to be
divided into "town, suburban, and country lots," to be sold in
England at a "sufficient price."</p>
<p>The competition of these new bubbles, home and colonial,
diverted the attention of intending colonists from South
Australia, where the high price of town lots left but small
margin for profits or premiums. Besides, in those epochs of
speculative frenzy which periodically recur in England and
Scotland, unknown schemes have a certain advantage. About the end
of the second year of Colonel Gawler's administration, the
resources of South Australia as an investment for capital were
partly known, while, as nothing was known about the resources of
New Zealand, not even whether there was any available land there
at all, it became an excellent and fashionable subject for
speculation.</p>
<p>Colonel Gawler piteously complains in some of his despatches
of the misrepresentations of rival colonists, and of parties who,
after a very partial inspection of the port and coast, had
departed, exclaiming, "All is barren!" But the fact was, that the
capitalists who had landed found no advantageous opening for the
investment of capital; town lots had been driven up to an
enormous premium; the cultivation of land did not pay, and has
never paid the employer of labour on a large scale in any new
country. Wool-growing and other pastoral pursuits were more
profitable in Port Phillip and the new districts of New South
Wales; besides, under the puffing forcing system, enough land,
supposing it all fertile, had been sold to support a population
of 200,000. The population of the colony was 15,000, of which
8,000 were settled in Adelaide, gambling with each other. As for
the labourers, they were partly employed in waiting and working
for the white-handed emigrants who had come out under Mr.
Wakefield's advice "to labour with their heads, not with their
hands," and who, therefore, required more work done for them than
old-fashioned colonists, who were not ashamed to mend their own
tools or carry their own packages, and partly in executing works
for the government and for the South Australian Company. A
considerable number were in the hospital, and others were working
at such sham labour tests as drawing fallen timber from the park,
to be used for fuel in the government offices.</p>
<p>It had been found impracticable then, as in all subsequent
attempts, to carry out the scheme of obtaining recruits for free
passages "exclusively of young married couples not exceeding
twenty-four years of age." The labouring classes have their
feelings and affections as keenly in regard to family ties as
their superiors in fortune and education; they are not to be
draughted out, as the Wakefield theory proposes, like sheep or
cattle; and the parties charged with supplying the quota of
labourers required for the ships, so recklessly despatched to
South Australia, completed the number by a per centage who from
age, feebleness, or unfitness for colonial labour, became almost
immediately chargeable on the government. All who were shipped,
if able to work, claimed under their shipping order a minimum of
5s. a day.</p>
<p>When more houses had been built than could be let when the
capital, of which a large portion was exported for the
importation of labour which it was impossible to employ
profitably, began to grow scarce&mdash;the price of land orders
fell, and the rate of wages. Then the frugal labourers began to
retire from service, to settle down on purchased sections, and
combine to purchase and divide sections of 80 acres, to the
extreme disgust of the hired-labour and sufficient-price
theorists.</p>
<p>In England the large draughts of the governor, in conjunction
with the falling off of land sales, had driven the commissioners
to endeavour without success to negotiate the remainder of the
loan authorised by their two acts of Parliament, and then to
apply for assistance to the Treasury, which was in the first
instance granted to a limited extent.</p>
<p>In the colony Colonel Gawler was travelling on a declivity,
and could not arrest his course. When he found the commissioners
could no longer meet his bills he drew upon the Treasury for the
expenses of government. The first bills were met; but eventually
a series of draughts, to the amount of £69,000, were
dishonoured.</p>
<p>The commissioners, who had been perfectly content with Colonel
Gawler, as long as the public continued to purchase land, fell
upon him like a herd upon a stricken deer, repudiated acts to
which they had given tacit approval, and tried to throw the
failure due to their absurd plan and improvident conduct on "the
governor's extravagance." He was recalled abruptly, and left to
hear of the dishonour of his bills by a circuitous private
source. The commissioners themselves were soon after
ignominiously dismissed.</p>
<p>When the news of the dishonour of the governor's bills reached
the colony the bubble burst; land became immediately unsaleable;
an insolvency all but universal followed, from which the banks,
from early private intelligence, were able to protect themselves.
The chief sufferers were English merchants, shippers, and
manufacturers. The colonial speculators had long been trading on
fictitious capital. A certain number of colonists of fortune were
reduced to absolute beggary. A rapid re-emigration of capital and
labour took place. Many labourers were thrown on the government
for support. The price of food, rent, and wages fell rapidly.
Adelaide became almost a deserted village. The only persons busy
were officials whom the commissioners had forgotten to appoint,
viz., the sheriff and his officers, engaged in pursuing beggared
debtors, and the Judge of the Insolvent Court, by whom they were
rapidly whitewashed.</p>
<p>Colonel Crawler retired, after having sacrificed a
considerable private fortune to his faith in an impracticable
system, and became the scapegoat for the criminal absurdities of
the colonising theorists in London. But his hospitality, his
charity, his truthfulness, his genuine kindness of heart,
rendered him respected and beloved in South Australia, especially
among the humbler classes, or those who were humble in his
time.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by Captain (now Sir George) Grey, who,
happening to be in London at the time Colonel Gawler was
recalled, and able to afford the Colonial Office some information
about this pantomime colony, received and accepted the ungrateful
office of governor.</p>
<p>From that day it has been the endeavour of the theorists and
their orators to charge to the extravagance of the ruined
ex-governor the inevitable result of an attempt to plant a colony
without the preparations dictated by common prudence&mdash;to
regulate the flow of capital and labour&mdash;and to raise
revenue and profits from the application of capital and labour to
unproductive works. The commissioners sent ship-loads of
colonists, where, had they been wise, they would have sent
sheep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI.</h3>
<h4>GOVERNOR GREY.<br>
<br>
1841 TO 1844.</h4>
<p><span class="a">When</span> Colonel Gawler retired, land
became unsaleable, emigrants ceased to arrive, and of those who
were in the colony a large per centage re-emigrated to colonies
where there were more cattle and fewer town lots. The population
of Adelaide diminished in twelve months to the extent of four
thousand souls. The price of everything fell fifty per cent.;
whole streets of Messrs. Gouger's and Stephens's cottages stood
empty; the South Australian merchants who had paid their English
creditors in the Insolvent Court, ceased to be trusted with
speculative shipments; the police horses were turned to graze
upon the beautiful gardens constructed by Colonel Gawler on the
banks of the Torrens; Government House, late the scene of
vice-royal entertainments, was closed; the little world of
Adelaide recovered its senses and lost some of its conceit; and
the sober and industrious were able to survey and take stock of
the true position of the colony.</p>
<p>The raw materials of colonisation had been provided, a road
had been constructed from the port, others toward the interior
had been marked out and made practicable. Land suitable for
cultivation had been discovered, surveyed, and handed over to
land purchasers, who had now no temptation to stay in town, if
they meant to remain in the colony; labourers were willing to
take reasonable wages, or ready to set to work for themselves
with hearty good will; and, what was most satisfactory of all,
live stock by importation, by overland, and by natural increase,
afforded an ample supply of meat at reasonable prices, with a
certain and increasing quantity of wool and tallow for
exportation. Impoverished gentry were now happy to fall back,
from imported fresh salmon, or ducks and green peas in tin cases,
at fifty per cent. above the Piccadilly tariff, upon native
poultry, at almost nominal prices. During the land mania geese
imported from Van Diemen's land sold at 12s. 6d. each, fowls, 5s.
a head, and everything else in proportion. In 1842 country people
used to drive a cart filled with live poultry, fowls, ducks,
geese, turkeys, in fair condition, covered over with a sheet, and
sell the whole lot at from fourteen to sixteen shillings.</p>
<p>Under the bountiful, genial climate of South Australia actual
want was unknown, and-industry produced immediate results.</p>
<p>Governor Grey's task was easy. The famine or speculative
prices of labour and provisions had fallen to reasonable rates,
the emigration of paupers had ceased, and with the immigration
the cost of maintaining the infirm, the sick, and the lazy. The
unhired were set to work at such bare wages as induced them to
seek private employers as soon as possible; the surveys were
carried on steadily without pressure, and without exorbitant
expenses for stores and hire of drays; and the police expenses
were partly superseded by the arrival of a company of soldiers
granted to Governor Grey, although indignantly refused to Sir
Charles Napier. With these reductions of expenditure, and power
to draw upon the home government for a limited sum, Governor Grey
was still unable, in homely phrase, to make both ends meet; but
the colony survived and vegetated in a sort of obscurity, which
contrasted painfully with the brilliancy of its early, brief,
blooming, hothouse career.</p>
<p>In the mean tune the model colonists were not idle in England.
On the 7th July, 1840, the colonisation commissioners for South
Australia brought under the notice of the Colonial Secretary
(Lord J. Russell) the embarrassed state of the finances of the
colony; and in August they reported that the revenue of the
colony did not much exceed £20,000 per annum, and the current
expenditure had risen to £140,000. Under these circumstances the
Secretary of State, by letter dated 5th November, 1840, undertook
to guarantee a loan of £120,000 to be raised by the
commissioners; but negotiations to raise this loan failed.</p>
<p>In the same year the original commissioners were
dismissed.</p>
<p>In February, 1841, a select committee of the House of Commons
was appointed to consider the South Australian acts, and the
actual condition of the colony of South Australia. The inquiry
lasted until the 10th June. A long array of witnesses were called
on behalf of the Colonial Office and the South Australian
interest. Personal and documentary evidence proved in the
clearest manner that the Colonial Office had given every
reasonable assistance to the commissioners, and were in no manner
responsible for the blunders of the commissioners or the
commissioners' agents. The South Australian interest, including
non-resident purchasers of vast tracts of land, and Mr. Gibbon
Wakefield and his disciples, were examined at great length, but
not a single representative or settler from any of the colonies
whose interests were likely to be affected by the decisions of
the committee was called.</p>
<p>The case for South Australia was "got up and worked," in
railway phrase, by Mr. Wakefield and Colonel Torrens, and all the
colonial evidence was made to <i>fit</i> their peculiar
views.</p>
<p>The committee made two reports. In the first, on the 9th
March, 1840, they state, "that at the present moment the sales by
the colonisation commissioners of land in the colony are
suspended; emigration has ceased since the month of August; the
bills drawn by the governor have been protested, the estimated
amount of such bills already due and in progress is £97,000, the
amount due to parties in England for services performed is
£56,000; the debt from the revenue to the emigration fund is
£56,000; making a total deficiency of about £210,000."</p>
<p>In the second report they enter into the history of the colony
in detail, in the course of which they say:&mdash;"With regard to
Colonel Gawler, it is impossible to doubt that when he entered on
the duties of his office they were in a state of the greatest
confusion, and that the difficulties he had to contend with were
most embarrassing; that shortly after his arrival in the colony
he represented these circumstances, and gave the commissioners
reason to expect a considerable excess of expenditure above what
had been provided; that among those witnesses who have most
decidedly pronounced his expenditure excessive, none have been
able to point out any specific items which could have been
reduced without great public inconvenience, while the chief item
of expenditure, incurred on account of the government house and
public offices, was one that the late board had authorised."</p>
<p align="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"The commissioners had originally set apart a sum of £10,000
annually, over and above the revenue, out of which they intended
that all the ordinary expenditure should be defrayed. <i>It is
now calculated that after spending the whole local revenue, and
providing otherwise for the charge of surveys, which has hitherto
been defrayed by drafts upon the commissioners, and without
making any allowance for public works, there will still remain to
be provided for an annual deficit of about</i> £40,000."</p>
<p>But the committee, as experience has since proved, were more
correct in their statement of facts than fortunate and sagacious
in proposing a remedy. Having unsuspectingly received all Mr.
Gibbon Wakefield's assumptions and assertions as incontrovertible
economical truths, they proceeded to recommend by resolutions,
amongst other things, that all land be sold by auction at a
minimum upset price, except special surveys of 20,000 acres; that
"the minimum price of land in South Australia may safely be
raised above the present amount of £1 an acre; and that in fixing
such amount it is desirable to keep in view the principle of
maintaining such an amount as may tend to remedy the evils
arising out of a <i>too great facility of obtaining landed
property, and a consequently disproportionate supply of labour
and exorbitant rate of wages</i>."</p>
<p>At that time the committee were firmly convinced that they
could regulate the rate of wages by the price of land; and Lord
Howick, since Colonial Secretary as Earl Grey, then a pupil of
Mr. Wakefield, moved as an amendment to the above-quoted
resolution, "That one minimum price for land in all the
Australian colonies ought to be established, and that this price
ought not to be lower than £2 per acre, and that it ought to be
progressively increased until it is found that the great scarcity
of labour now complained of in these colonies no longer
exists."</p>
<p>The fallacy of these assumptions has now been rendered as
patent as another favourite assumption of the same
period&mdash;that the price of corn in England regulated the rate
of wages.</p>
<p>Ten years' experience have proved that the highest rate of
wages may exist in the face of a price of land so high as to
exclude all but a very small number of purchasers; and in that
ten years the home government, in the face of a ruinous rate of
wages, have been unable, although willing, to raise the price of
land in Australia. The sale of land has ceased, except in the
immediate neighbourhood of towns, in choice situations, and where
mines were supposed to exist.</p>
<p>But in 1841 colonial opinions were treated with contempt. As
in 1847 grave commercial men like Mr. Morrison, deceived by
imaginary dividends, believed that government could buy up and
work all the railways of Great Britain at a profit, so Lord
Stanley and Lord Grey, dazzled by the land purchases of mad
speculators in New South Wales, Port Phillip, and South
Australia, fancied that the government had an inexhaustible
treasure for emigration and patronage in the waste lands of every
colony in the British dominions, from the Sugar Loaf Hills of New
Zealand to the wild wintry moors of the Falkland Islands.</p>
<p>Two acts brought in and carried by Lord Stanley, the Colonial
Secretary, in the session of 1842, embodied the recommendations
of the committee, and arranged for the future government of South
Australia. By one a minimum price of £1 an acre, with sale by
auction, except in the case of special surveys of 20,000 acres,
was imposed on all the Australian colonies, including Van
Diemen's Land. It is this act against which the colonists, who
were never consulted, have not ceased to protest. By the other
act South Australia was transferred from the management of
commissioners to the Colonial Office, and its debts were arranged
in the following manner:&mdash;The whole debt amounted to
£405,433; of this, £155,000, which had been granted by Parliament
in 1841 for passing exigencies, was made a free gift; £45,936, of
which £17,646 had been incurred by Governor Grey in maintaining
unemployed emigrants, was to be paid by the Treasury; and the
remainder was converted into debentures, partly guaranteed by the
government and partly charged on the colonial revenues.</p>
<p>It may be convenient to state here that renewed sales of land,
after the discovery of copper mines, paid off the greater part of
these debts, with interest, between 1845 and 1849, with the
exception of the £155,000. About £50,000 still remains due.</p>
<p>On the passing of this act South Australia sank into
obscurity, and in spite of the vigorous efforts of the South
Australian Company, which found itself in possession of large
tracts of land that could neither be sold nor let to rent-paying
tenants, ceased to attract the attention of emigrants.</p>
<p>Great bankers and capitalists who had been induced to purchase
lots of land wrote them out in their books as value nil. So late
as 1850 there were parties in the city of London who had
forgotten that they held some thousand acres in South Australia
until reminded by an application to purchase from returned
colonists. In very rare cases has the investment in rural land at
£1 an acre turned out profitable.</p>
<p>Dover, the quietest and least enterprising of towns,
contributed by public subscription in 1837-8 one emigrant to
South Australia. The fortunate man no sooner arrived, with
nothing to lose, than, carried away by enthusiasm and the
persuasions of the Colonial Secretary, Gouger, he became the
purchaser of a thousand acres of land, and boldly drew upon two
of the gentlemen who had charitably sent him out, advising them
of the favour he had done them, and promising to remit in due
course the title-deeds. The good Doverians, on the arrival of the
tremendous bill, held a consultation, learned the total ruin that
would fall on the drawer if it were returned protested, wishing,
too, not to have the one Dover emigrant disgraced, and perhaps a
little dazzled by the brilliant reports of fortunes daily
realised in Australian land, made a round robin of 100 apiece,
met the bill, in due course received the grant, and from that
time forward never heard a word of the emigrant or the land.</p>

self-supporting, sufficient-price colony:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus it appears that, between 1837 and 1840, 15,000
inhabitants, who were importing provisions at the rate of
£200,000 per annum, only cultivated 2,000 acres; but in three
years after they had abandoned land-gambling, and lost all credit
in the English market, they had 28,000 acres in cultivation, of
which 23,000 were in wheat, and the number of landed proprietors
had nearly doubled. But the result of this industry proved that,
although much misery would have been saved the colony had
agriculture occupied the colonists instead of land-gambling,
still that agriculture could not be carried on with a profit with
hired labour in the colony, for in 1843-4 wheat fell to 3s. 6d.
and even 2s. 6d. a bushel, with wages at least 3s. a day; while
Van Diemen's Land, with better soil and climate for wheat
growing, and cheaper labour, could not afford to grow wheat for
less than 4s. or 5s. a bushel. In fact, the South Australians
found themselves in possession of 200,000 bushels of wheat which
was absolutely unsaleable, although of admirable quality; and in
June, 1845, after exporting 200,000 bushels, chiefly sold at a
loss, a surplus of 156,000 bushels remained.</p>
<p>Of wool there were only 5,000 bales to export in 1843. Port
Phillip, colonised with sheep and shepherds at the time that
model colonists were forwarded to Port Adelaide in thousands,
exported 9,000 bales in 1841; and in 1843 enjoyed exports to the
amount of £307,000, without a shilling of debt, against South
Australian exports of £46,000, and £400,000 debt.</p>
<p>In 1843 the results of the monstrous system on which South
Australia was colonised began to disappear. The ruined
capitalists were forgotten, so too were the debts due to the home
government and home creditors. Those who had been able to weather
the storm of insolvency and keep a few sheep had retired towards
the interior: there dispersed, they were able to live cheaply, to
carry on their business with little hired labour, and to look
forward with confidence to annual income from the clip of wool,
and annual increase of wealth by the natural increase of their
flocks.</p>
<p>Thus, in 1843, South Australia, formed with so much
preparation, the subject of so much printing, colonised by a
superior class, forced forward by an enormous expenditure of
public and private capital, instead of presenting a picture of a
contented population, divided into capitalists and labourers
engaged in scientific agriculture, owed all its exports to
dispersion after the manner of neighbouring colonies, whose
"barbarous manners" had been so much contemned, and presented a
picture of cottier farmers, vegetating in obscurity, content to
live with few comforts, without rent or taxes. Some squatted on
land the property of absentees, many more as tenants not paying
any rent, whom the landlords were glad to retain in order to keep
their land in condition. The tenants of the South Australian
Company were in this state.</p>
<p>Looking back at the condition of South Australia after it had
ceased to attract the importation of capital, there can be no
doubt that if it had been as far from the old ports of the
colonies as Swan River, and out of reach of the expeditions of
overlanders, it would have sunk even to a lower ebb than Western
Australia.</p>
<p>When land-jobbing had been exhausted, and all the schemes
hatched in England for employing capital had been tried and found
wanting, an accident revealed to the colonists the existence of a
treasure which even the sanguine and poetical promoters of the
colony had never suspected or suggested. They had placed coals,
marble, slate, and precious stones among the probable exports;
but copper and lead had not entered into their calculations.</p>
<p>In 1841 a little lead ore was discovered and sent to England.
In 1843 Mr. Button, the brother of a gentleman of some means, but
who had himself been compelled by the general depression to
accept the situation of sheep overseer, accidentally discovered,
and, in partnership with Captain Bagot, became the purchaser of,
the eighty-acre section which included the Kapunda mine. Other
mines were subsequently discovered, to which, wherever of any
importance, a description will be given in the chapter devoted to
the present resources of the colony; but the great event, the
turning-point of the fortunes of South Australia, was the
discovery of the Burra Burra mine, which has alone furnished for
the last five years more than four-fifths of South Australian
exports.</p>
<p>The discovery of the Kapunda set all the colony hunting for
mineral outcrops; the residue of the land-jobbers took up the
geologist's hammer; but by a singular fortune, the investigations
of Mr. Mengs, a practised geologist, were fruitless, while a mine
of wealth was turned up by the wheel of a bullock-dray.</p>
<p>In 1845 the existence of a remarkable and promising outcrop on
the Burra hills became well known in the colony: rumours on the
subject had been afloat in 1840. In order to secure the whole
district without the unlimited competition, application was made
to the governor for a special survey of 20,000 acres. At the same
time a party of speculators arrived from Sydney, intent on
securing the great prize if possible. The survey was ordered; a
day and hour was fixed for the payment of the £20,000; the
governor decided not to accept bills of the local bank, or
anything but cash. Cash in 1845 was a very scarce commodity in
Adelaide, although corn was plentiful, and pride as rampant, and
with as little reason, as in any decayed watering-place in
England. The retailers, and all not within a certain
indescribable line, were dubbed the snobs; the officials and
self-elected aristocracy the nobs.</p>
<p>To raise the £20,000, a union between the nobs and snobs
became indispensable; but even that was not enough, for there was
scarcely so much gold in the possession of all the colonists, and
the Sydney speculators were waiting ready to bear off the prize.
On the last day for payment a hunt for gold was commenced by half
a dozen men of good credit. Cash-boxes in hand, they traversed
the streets and suburbs of Adelaide, offering with ample security
a handsome premium for sovereigns. On that day many secret hoards
were dug out; husbands learned that prudent wives had unknown
stores, and old women were even tempted to draw their £1 and £2
from the recesses of old stockings. Almost at the last minute the
money was collected, counted, and paid, and the richest
copper-mine in the world rewarded the long suffering of the South
Australians, and awakened all their old gambling spirit. The
purchase effected, the class spirit which forms so absurd an
element in the English character, broke out, and a division of
the 20,000 acres was decided on. The toss-up of a coin gave the
"snobs" the first choice; they took 10,000 acres, to which they
gave a native name, the Burra Burra. The nobs named their 10,000
acres the Princess Royal. The outcroppings on the hills of the
Princess Royal were magnificent; nevertheless in 1850 their £50
scrip was not saleable at £12. The history of this mine is the
history of the commercial progress of South Australia. Farms,
land sales; emigration, wharves, warehouses, projected railways,
imports, rents, wages, have all rested on the yield of the Burra
Burra.</p>
<p>The government was vested in the governor and
commander-in-chief, assisted by an executive and legislative
council, composed of the governor, the colonial secretary, the
advocate-general, the surveyor-general, and the assistant
commissioner, to whom were subsequently added four nominees from
among the non-official colonists.</p>
<p>Of the progress of South Australia since the discovery of
mines and the dissolution of the South Australian Commission, the
following figures will afford some idea:&mdash;</p>
<p>The exports of the year ending April, 1850, amounted to
£453,668 12s. Of this sum £11,212 was in wheat, £20,279 in flour,
£63,729 in copper in ingots, £211,361 in copper ore, £8,188 in
tallow, and [£]113,259 in wool.</p>
<p>The imports for the same period were £887,423, part of the
excess arising from imports of railway and mining machinery, and
other productive investments. In the same year 64,728½ acres were
in cultivation&mdash;wheat, 41,807 acres; potatoes, 1,780;
gardens, 1,370; vineyards, 282; hay, 13,000.</p>
<p>The population was 63,900, of which 7,000 were Germans.</p>
<p>Live Stock: Cattle, 100,000; sheep, 1,200,000; horses,
6,000.*</p>

to the gold mines of New South Wales and Victoria.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII.</h3>
<h4>A GLANCE AT THE EXTENT, FORM, SOIL, CLIMATE, RIVERS, AND
PRODUCTIONS OF AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Australia</span> is the largest island in the
world, so large that it is more correctly described as an
island-continent, situated between the 10th and 45th degrees of
south latitude, and the 112th and 154th degrees of longitude east
from Greenwich. It may be said to be nearly three thousand miles
from west to east, and two thousand miles from north to south, of
a nearly square form, were it not for the deep indentation formed
by the great Gulf of Carpenteria. But this superficial extent,
which is sometimes compared with that of other continents,
affords no true index to the area really available, or ever
likely to be available, for colonisation. A great portion of the
interior is more hopelessly barren and impassable than the
deserts of Africa, being in dry weather a hollow basin of sand,
in rainy seasons a vast shallow inland sea, alternately and
rapidly swelled by tropical torrents, and dried up by the
tropical sun.</p>
<p>Comparisons are frequently instituted between the relative
areas and populations of Europe and Australia; but nothing can be
more fallacious or dishonest.</p>
<p>The resources of Australia have been as yet barely discovered;
a century of active colonisation can scarcely develop them to
their fullest extent. Even without the appliances of science and
combined labour a vast population may be subsisted in comfort;
but, without some change more extensive and material than it is
possible to foresee, there can be no such dense multitudes
concentrated in Australia as are found in the more civilised
states of Europe, and as may be found at some future period in
North America. The absence of great rivers and the means of
forming inland water communication, and the quality of a great
proportion of the soil, settle this point.</p>
<p>The surface of this island is depressed in the centre, bounded
by an almost continuous range of hills and plateaux, which,
varying in height from one to six thousand feet above the level
of the sea, in some places approach the coast and present lofty,
inaccessible cliffs to the ocean&mdash;as, for instance, the
heads of Port Jackson&mdash;and in others tend toward the
interior of the country, at a distance of from twenty to eighty
miles; but these elevations being all of an undulating, not a
precipitous character, no part of the country can be considered
strictly alpine.</p>
<p>The features on the exterior and interior of this range of
hills differ so much as to present the results of climates
usually found much further apart, especially on the eastern
coast, where between the mountains and the sea as,&mdash;for
instance, at Illawarra, Port Macquarie, and Moreton Bay&mdash;the
vegetation partakes to a great extent of a tropical character;
and on the rich debris washed down from the hills we find forests
of towering palms and various species of gum-trees
(<i>Eucalypti</i>), the surface of the ground beneath clothed
with dense and impervious underwood, composed of dwarf trees,
shrubs, and tree-ferns, festooned with creepers and parasitic
plants, from the size of a convolvulus and vine to the cable of a
man-of-war. These dense forests, through which exploring
travellers have been obliged to cut their way inland at the rate
of not more than a mile or two a day, are interspersed with open
glades or meadow reaches, admirably adapted for pasturing cattle,
to which the colonists have given the name of apple-tree flats,
from the fancied resemblance between the apple-trees of Europe
and those (<i>Angophoræ</i>) with which these glades are thinly
dotted.</p>
<p>Within the ranges, on the other hand, are found immense open
downs and grassy plains, divided by rocky and round-backed ranges
of hills, and interspersed by open forest without undergrowth and
detached belts of gum trees (<i>Eucalypti acaciæ</i>), presenting
a park-like appearance, which, advancing towards the interior,
are succeeded either by marshes, or sandy and stony deserts,
perfectly sterile and uninhabitable, except by a few reptiles,
and birds which prey upon them.</p>
<p>The rivers of Australia are few in number, and insignificant
in a navigable point of view. The one series, rising from the
seaside of the mountain range, flow deviously until they reach
the coast, seldom affording a navigable stream more than twenty
miles inland, usually rushing down with such rapidity during the
rainy season as to fill up their seamouths with a bar which
excludes all except boats of slight draught of water. The other
series, falling toward the interior, are lost in quicksands,
marshes, or shallow lakes, after a course varying from a score to
many hundred miles of zigzag current, now flowing with a full,
deep stream, and then suddenly diminishing to a depth of a few
inches, or even totally and suddenly disappearing.</p>
<p>The Dutch colonists in South Africa have terms by which they
express the exact value of flowing water, whether perpetual or
intermittent, whether a mere rivulet or a deep stream; but there
are no words invented in the English language which convey a
correct idea of Australian waters. The two terms most in use are
creek and river, the former being an arm or branch of the latter.
But an Australian river, even when marked by an imposing coloured
line on a map, giving according to proportion an idea of a Rhine,
a Danube, or a Thames, is generally a chain of pools, varying in
dimension from a few yards to a league in diameter, which are,
with a few grand exceptions, according to their respective depth
and proximity to mountains, reduced to an absolute or comparative
state of mud in dry seasons, or united into a deep, still stream,
or roaring torrent, after a few hours of tropical rain.</p>
<p>The brother of the writer rode down, on an exploring
expedition during a season of drought, with a fellow-squatter, in
search of fresh pastures, and discovered a river, flowing bank
high, as broad as the Thames at Richmond, winding along plains
which, as far as the eye could reach, were covered with rich
grass higher than the necks of their horses. As they rode along,
ground pigeons, grass parroquets, and quails rose up in
thousands; and from time to time flocks of emus thundered past,
while kangaroos bounded swiftly away, and from the river rose
clouds of waterfowl. There seemed game enough to feed an army,
and grass enough for tens of thousands of live stock. Yet he
lived to see within a few years the grassy plain burned to a
sandy desert, and the great river shrink to a chain of shallow
pools, in which it was difficult to find water enough for a
hundred oxen.</p>
<p>The deep pools, called colonially "waterholes," and the
winding course pursued by all the Australian rivers, economise
the supply during the long droughts, and at the same time
distribute it over a considerable part of the country. Thus the
Hawkesbury, one of the earliest rivers navigated by the settlers,
is not more than thirty-five miles in a direct line from Windsor,
where it is navigable to Broken Bay, and where it flows into the
sea; but its tortuous route is one hundred and forty miles, and
higher up its windings are still more remarkably circuitous. The
Murray, the greatest river of Australia, rising on the western
flank of the Australian alps, after a course of fourteen hundred
miles, in which it receives the waters of the Ovens, the Darling,
and the Murrumbidgee, by which name it is known for part of its
course, ends in the broad shallow lake of Alexandrina, in South
Australia.</p>
<p>Until the later explorations of Mitchell and Leichardt hopes
were confidently entertained of discovering an inland sea, and a
great navigable river, flowing to the northward; but these hopes
are now no longer entertained, and it is certain that on land
conveyance the chief Australian communications must depend.</p>
<p>A great diversity of climate prevails in Australia, varying
with the latitude and the height from the sea. Van Diemen's Land,
with its more isolated and more southern position, enjoys more
rain and the irrigation of many streams. In certain districts of
Australia, especially between the 25th and 35th degrees of
latitude, the thermometer frequently rises to 110°, 120°, and
even 130°, in the shade, while hot winds sweep over the country
from the sterile, burning plains of the interior. This great heat
is unaccompanied by night-dews; and droughts of many months'
duration occur at uncertain intervals, and are of uncertain
extent, during which rivers and waterholes are dried up. The
settlers, who have not yet imitated the costly construction of
tanks and aqueducts, or even the more simple and successful
contrivances adopted in peninsular India and in Asia Minor for
collecting and husbanding rain and spring-water, suffer dreadful
straits. The pastures become parched deserts&mdash;the sheep eat
the grass to the roots&mdash;the waterholes are poisoned by the
bodies of cattle suffocated in sloughs when struggling for drink,
and thousands of stock of all kinds perish either before moving
or while on the road to districts which the drought has not
affected. It is during these droughts that almost all the great
discoveries of new pastures have been made by enterprising
stockowners and their servants.</p>
<p>But after a time&mdash;which no man, white or native, can
calculate&mdash;rains fall in torrents, grass springs up
abundantly, "and the plains, on which but lately not a blade of
herbage was to be seen, and over which the stillness of
desolation reigned, become green with luxuriant vegetation." The
rivers and creeks fill with marvellous rapidity; a roaring flood
rushes down the lately dry bed of a stream, overflows the banks,
and carries all that impedes its progress in white foam before
it. On such occasions the Hawkesbury has risen, between
precipitous cliffs, ninety-five feet in a few hours. In 1851, in
the Maneroo district, the sites of townships recently laid out
for sale by the government surveyor were converted into deep
lakes, and a whole camp of aborigines were drowned.</p>
<p>The ravages of the drought and flood are quickly replaced in a
climate so favourable to the increase of live stock, and in a
very short time the losses and the dangers are forgotten. These
afflictions were of a more serious character in the early years
of the first colony, when but a comparatively limited part had
been explored. At present plenty in one colony or one district
counterbalances the droughts or floods of another.</p>
<p>At a height of two or three thousand feet above the level of
the sea a temperate and even cold region is to be found, where
the vegetables, fruits, and grain of northern Europe nourish, and
the settler or traveller finds the necessity of warm clothing,
and the comfort of blazing fires.</p>
<p>But despite all the varieties of temperature found in
Australia, the climate is, with the exception of the burning
plains of the interior, congenial to Europeans. Even the tropical
regions of the coast are free from those fevers which decimate
white men visiting the Indian seas and the African coast.</p>
<p>The soil of Australia varies even more than its climate. Of
the whole extent a very large proportion is hopelessly barren,
but still enough remains capable of supporting a very numerous,
and in some districts a dense population. There are no data for
calculating with such a degree of accuracy as would be useful the
proportions of available land in the occupied districts. It will
be safe to assume that only two-thirds of the land worth
occupying is, or ever will be, fit for pastoral purposes, and can
no more be profitably cultivated than the limestone hills and
moors of Wales, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and Gloucestershire, or
the Highlands of Scotland.</p>
<p>Of land fit for agricultural purposes, and sufficiently clear
of trees to be put under plough at a reasonable expenditure of
labour, there is enough to support a population to be counted by
millions, but continually intersected by barren ranges and
forests of scrub, which can never be of any value except for
firewood.</p>
<p>On the coast to the northward, between Port Macquarie and
Moreton Bay, are vast tracts of well-watered land, on which the
soil is excellently adapted for various crops, but so covered
with heavy timber that nothing less than the old system of
convict-clearing gangs, or of free grants to clearing parties,
will bring them into cultivation in this generation, although
well placed for water conveyance to the seaport towns. On the
other hand, in Port Phillip there are plains on which the plough
might be driven for one hundred miles in a straight line, turning
up a furrow of rich mould along the whole tract; and the other
two colonies can present similar instances, although not to the
same extent, or so near the seacoast.</p>
<p>The soil of Australia presents as many anomalies as its
configuration and its animal and vegetable productions.</p>
<p>In other parts of the world the most fertile tracts are
generally found near the mouths of rivers; in Australia the
greatest fertility usually commences where the navigation ceases.
In Europe the valleys will generally be found full of rich soil;
in Australia some of the richest mould is to be found on the tops
of hills. The low hills formed on the banks of rivers above the
navigable waters are often unequalled in richness, while the
valleys are composed of a soft clay, producing a rich coarse
herbage, very fit for pasturing horned cattle, but unsuitable for
cultivation.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of the first settlement, west and south-west
of Sydney, is chiefly composed of sandstone and unproductive
clays. The first good land was found in patches on the River
Hawkesbury; and on the alluvial flats formed by the overflowing
fresh-water rivers the richest cultivable land is to be found.
Works for draining or irrigating can only be attempted where
damming a valley or draining a high-lying marsh can produce a
great effect at a moderate expense. For half a century the
progress of colonisation in Australia has rested on its pastoral
resources, which are of the very first order, as regards soil,
climate, and arrangement of territory.</p>
<p>From the level of the sea to the summit of the highest
mountains pastures are to be found extending for hundreds of
miles,&mdash;now undulating smoothly and almost imperceptibly,
then extending in broad, flat plains, or over a succession of
round-backed hills, broken with rocky ranges, and ending in deep
gullies. Over these the flockmaster may, if needful, drive his
flock for days, nay, for weeks, without meeting any serious
interruption to his progress, or without failure of the pasture
on which sheep thrive.</p>
<p>The districts which, from their dampness and rankness of the
vegetation, would be unsuitable for sheep, are available for
cattle, which in certain regions, in default of grass, find good
feed on the tender branches of a species of primrose.</p>
<p>Agriculture has hitherto been but rudely pursued in Australia,
with rare exceptions. To gentlemen of capital it is not, and is
not likely to become, a profitable pursuit; for this reason, a
prejudice against the agricultural capabilities of the colonies
has been entertained and sedulously encouraged among the pastoral
interest, who, dreading the prospect of a class of yeomanry which
might encroach on their sheep-walks, can with difficulty be
induced to admit that there is any fertile soil to be
found&mdash;a prejudice which must always be taken into
consideration in estimating the value of colonial evidence on
such subjects. It is quite certain that ignorant cultivators have
successfully cropped farms on the Hawkesbury, the Hunter, the
Macquarie, year after year, without manure, and without any
sensible diminution in the returns. As to quality of grain, the
wheat imported into this country from South Australia, Port
Phillip, and Van Diemen's Land, has been pronounced equal to any
ever exhibited in Mark-lane for weight, size, and flavour.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>
<h4>A GEOGRAPHICAL SKETCH AND TABULAR VIEW OF EASTERN
AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<p><span class="a">New South Wales</span> and the new province of
Victoria have so recently been divided, and are geographically so
completely united, that it is difficult to describe the principal
rivers or mountains of the one without referring to the other.
The reader must therefore study the colonial divisions of Eastern
Australia with a map.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Mitchell, as Survey or-General, was in 1827
entrusted with the task of surveying and dividing that district
into counties, and the laying out of towns, roads, and reserves
for public purposes. In this work, now complete, he has been
zealously engaged for twenty-six years. He has cut all the passes
that lead through mountains to the interior country, planned two
hundred towns and villages, and reported (without success) in
favour of several roads and public works, which would have
conferred the utmost benefit on the colony.</p>
<p>The following sketch is taken by permission of the author from
a manual of Australasian Geography, prepared by Sir Thomas
Mitchell for the use of colonial schools.</p>
<p>New South Wales is divided into sixty-seven
counties&mdash;formerly into ninety&mdash;but twenty-three have
been cut off by the act which erected Australia Felix, under the
name of Victoria, into a separate colony.</p>
<p>"The nineteen counties," frequently referred to in colonial
documents, are those which were first proclaimed by "Letters
Patent." The principal rivers falling to the eastern coast are
the Shoalhaven (on which the township of Braidwood stands), the
Hawkesbury (on which there are the townships of Penrith,
Castlereagh, Richmond, Windsor, and Pitt Town, all in the county
of Cumberland, and Emu and Wilberforce, in the county of Cook),
and the Hunter. The Hunter receives from the south the waters of
the River Wollombi; from the north the rivers Page, Paterson, and
Williams; its most western source is the Goulburn. The following
townships are on the northern tributaries of the
Hunter:&mdash;Muscle Brook, on the northern branch of the Hunter;
Murrurundi, on the Page; Dulwich, on Glendon Brook; Paterson, on
the navigable branch of that name; and Clarence Town, at the head
of the navigation of the William.</p>

<br>
<p>Port Jackson is the fittest centre from which to take a survey
of the settled and inhabitable districts in Australia, being not
only the finest harbour and the port of the greatest Australian
city, but the inlet and outlet for commerce, having settled on
its shores the wealthiest and most dense population in the whole
island.</p>
<p>The usual course to Sydney for sailing-vessels is through
Bass's Straits; and in fair weather, with a favourable wind,
ships frequently pass sufficiently near the shores to afford an
agreeable but very tantalising view of the scenery.</p>
<p>"The shore is bold and picturesque, and the country behind,
gradually rising higher and higher into swelling hills of
moderate elevation, to the utmost distance the eye can reach, is
covered with wide-branching, evergreen forest trees and close
brushwood, exhibiting a prospect of never-failing foliage,
although sadly monotonous and dull in tone compared with the
luxuriant summer foliage of Europe. Grey rocks at intervals
project among these endless forests, while here and there some
gigantic tree, scorched dead by the summer fires, uplifts its
blasted branches above the green saplings around." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cunningham.]</p>
<p>Approaching Port Jackson, the coast line consists of cliffs of
a reddish hue. Where the land can be seen, shrubs and trees of
strange foliage are found nourishing on a white, sandy, barren
soil, destitute of herbage.</p>
<p>The entrance to the port is marked by the north and south
heads, about three quarters of a mile apart. On the southern head
a stone lighthouse, bearing the often-repeated name of Macquarie,
affords a revolving flame at night and a white landmark by day to
the great ships from distant quarters of the globe, and to the
crowd of large-sailed coasters which ply between innumerable
coast villages and Sydney.</p>
<p>Steering westerly, the great harbour, like a landlocked lake,
protected by the curving projecting heads from the roll of the
Pacific storms, opens out until lost in the distance, where it
joins the Paramatta River. The banks on either hand, varying from
two to five miles in breadth, are sometimes steep and sometimes
sloping, but repeatedly indented by coves and bays, which,
fringed with green shrubs down to the white sandy water-margin,
when bathed in golden sunlight, present dainty retreats as
brilliant as Danby's Enchanted Island.</p>
<p>On one of the first and most romantic coves stands Vaucluse,
the marine villa of William Wentworth.</p>
<p>Five miles from the heads, on "Sydney Cove," is the city of
Sydney, the head-quarters of the Governor-General, the residence
and episcopal city of the Bishop of Australia, and the greatest
wool port in the world. The still waters, alive with steamers
passing and repassing, with ships of English and American flags,
and a crowd of small craft, yachts, and pleasure-boats, betoken
the approach to a centre of busy commerce, even before the church
spires show themselves against the sky. In this city, which has
been too often described to need any detailed account here, every
comfort and every luxury of Europe is to be obtained that can be
purchased with money.</p>
<p>The entrance to Port Jackson is so safe and easy that the
American surveying ships ran in at night without a pilot; and
when the inhabitants rose in the morning they found themselves
under the guns of a frigate carrying the stripes and stars.</p>
<p>Vessels of considerable burden can unload alongside the
quays.</p>
<p>Sydney Cove is formed by two small promontories, between which
the rivulet flows which induced Governor Phillip to choose this
site for his settlement, as it possessed a safe harbour, wood and
water, three essential points, although not alone sufficient to
support a flourishing colony. The first harbour is of little
value, unless it is the outlet to a country capable of producing
some exports.</p>
<p>Tanks were cut for storing the water of the fresh-water stream
during the summer; but the increase of the town having rendered
this supply insufficient, water was brought from Botany Bay; and
recently further extensive works have been executed, by which an
aqueduct is brought from Cook's River, where a dam has been built
to exclude the salt water.</p>
<p>Along the hollow formed by the two promontories or ridges,
where the native track through the woods formerly led down to the
water's edge, George-street extends, and holds in the colonial
metropolis the relative ranks of the Strand and Regent-street.
There, until recently, stately plate-glass shops were to be found
side by side with wooden huts.</p>
<p>The harbour of Port Jackson affords an almost unlimited line
of deep water, along which, when needed by the extension of
commerce, quays and warehouses may be erected at a very trifling
expense. Many of the coves in Port Jackson are even now as much
in a state of nature as when Captain Phillip first discovered it.
As a central point for the commerce of the Australian seas, it is
not probable that it can ever be superseded as a maritime
station, even by other colonies planted in a more fertile
situation, although it may be asserted that, with rare
exceptions, the land for a hundred miles round Sydney is a sandy
desert. But roads, railroads, and steamers will afford Sydney the
advantages of the produce of districts which have no such harbour
as Port Jackson.</p>
<p>Cumberland and Camden were the two counties first settled.
Cumberland is the most densely-populated district in Australia,
and has the poorest soil; a belt of land parallel to the sea,
from twenty to forty miles in breadth, is either light sand
dotted with picturesque, unprofitable scrub, or a stiff clay or
ironstone, thickly covered with hard-wood timber and underwood.
After passing this belt, to which the colonists confined
themselves for more than ten years, with a few spirited
exceptions, the soil improves a little; that is to say, narrow
tracks of a rich alluvial character are found on the banks of the
rivers, but the greater proportion consists of forest on a poor
impenetrable soil, which defies the perseverance of the most
skilled agriculturist. The deeper you go the worse it is.</p>
<p>Camden has a moderate extent of cultivable land, including the
singular district of Illawarra, which is at once one of the most
beautiful and fertile spots in the world, in regard both to the
luxuriance and variety of its vegetable productions. The pastures
of Camden are extensive, and were considered important until the
discovery of the western and southern plains.</p>
<p>The dryness of the counties of Camden and Cumberland, in
which, in the course of the year, nearly as much rain falls as in
the counties of Essex and Sussex, is greatly owing to the stiff
clay of which the soil is chiefly composed, through which the
rain cannot easily filter, or from which springs can with
difficulty burst forth. Boring, on the artesian plan, has been
recently adopted with success.</p>
<p>To describe in detail the character of each county and each
district would be a difficult and wearisome task. Many, after
being charmed with the exquisitely picturesque appearance of Port
Jackson and Sydney, on a very cursory inspection of the
surrounding country, come to the conclusion that the whole
province of New South Wales is a barren desert only fit for
feeding sheep&mdash;a conclusion which is not more correct than
to judge of the agricultural capabilities of England by Dartmoor,
or of France by the "Landes."</p>
<p>Within the Sydney district are the towns of Paramatta,
Windsor, and Liverpool; but, in consequence of the dispersion
incident to the pastoral pursuits which have hitherto formed the
chief employment of Australia, there are really no towns in the
European sense of the word, with the exception of the three
capitals, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and Geelong in
Victoria, which, being the port to a rich district is likely to
rival Melbourne. The other towns with imposing names are mere
villages, with a gaol; a magistrate's office, some stores, and a
great many public-houses.</p>
<p>Taking Sydney as the starting point, we propose to survey the
general features of the settled and pastoral districts,
proceeding first towards the north, and returning to Port
Jackson, travelling along the coast to the other two
colonies.</p>
<p>The three great colonies of New South Wales, Victoria (late
Port Phillip), and South Australia, occupy a continuous coast
line, extending from Wide Bay, in New South Wales, to Cape Adieu,
in South Australia. With the exception of the small and
unsuccessful colony of Western Australia, or Swan River, the
remaining coast line of this island-continent is unsettled, and
only inhabited by wandering savages or stray parties of whalers
and sealers. Attempts have been made more than once to form
settlements in Northern Australia, but they have been abandoned,
and will not probably be renewed until the older colonists find
the need of further extensions inland, or some coal stations are
established for the numerous steamers which are now plying
between England and the gold regions.</p>
<p>The three colonies are only divided by imaginary lines, so
easy are the means of inland intercommunication. Overland
journeys have been executed between all by parties driving great
herds over an imtracked country.</p>
<p>The principal ports to the north of Port Jackson are Broken
Bay, the mouth of the River Hawkesbury, up which vessels of one
hundred tons can proceed for four miles beyond the town of
Windsor, which is one hundred and forty miles by the river, and
about forty miles in a direct line from the coast. Broken Bay is
not a safe harbour, being much exposed to the east and south-east
as well as the north-west winds.</p>
<p>Port Hunter is the mouth of the Hunter River, which receives
the waters of the Rivers Williams and Paterson.* It is navigable
for about thirty-five miles by waterway, and twenty-five miles in
a direct line from the coast. This stream was formerly called the
Coal River. On the bay sheltered by Nobby Island stands
Newcastle, a town which owes its name and importance to the
coal-fields by which it is surrounded, and has recently been made
the see of a bishoprick, extending to the extreme northern
district of the colony. Forty miles up the river are East and
West Maitland, and four miles nearer the sea Morpeth, the port of
the Hunter River Company. A regular steam-boat traffic in all the
produce of the Hunter River district is carried on between
Morpeth, Newcastle, and Sydney, from which they are distant about
eighty miles, the cheapness of steam communication having led to
the abandonment of the road formed at immense cost by convict
labour over the mountainous barren country inland between Sydney
and the Hunter River.</p>
<p class="foot">[* So named after Colonel Paterson, for a short
time Lieutenant-Governor; one of the earliest colonists who
devoted himself to botany, and introduced the first orange trees
in 1791.]</p>
<p>Hunter River is subject to droughts, but otherwise one of the
oldest and finest agricultural districts. Vine cultivation is
carried on there successfully, on a large scale. Its tributaries,
the Williams and Paterson Rivers, are both navigable for a
greater distance than the Hunter, the Williams uniting at twenty
miles and the Paterson at thirty-five miles from Newcastle. They
give access to districts which are cooler and better supplied
with rain than the Hunter.</p>
<p>Maitland owes its double name to the government having laid
out East Maitland during the land-buying mania, three miles up
the river, at a point too shallow for steam-boats to approach; on
which speculators laid out West Maitland.</p>
<p>The country round is flat, sometimes flooded, and produces
fine crops of wheat and Indian corn. Along the Paterson the
country is undulating and fertile, surrounded by hills which
attract rain, and render it better adapted for cattle than sheep.
Tobacco cultivation has been successfully pursued: thriving farms
occupy the banks of the rivers, which fetch a good price, either
to sell or rent. Kangaroos, plentiful a few years ago, are
becoming scarce; but wild ducks may be shot on the river, and
good fish caught.</p>
<p>In April the winter sets in and continues until September,
with nights cold enough to make a fire pleasant, and sharp frost
at daybreak.</p>
<p>In October the summer commences, and the wheat harvest in
November. Then in the Hunter district the hot winds commence,
blow for three days, and not unfrequently blight wheat just
coming into ear: these hot winds are usually succeeded by a sharp
southerly gale, accompanied by rain, which soon makes everything
not actually blighted look green again. This more particularly
refers to the Paterson. At Segenhoe, one of the most beautiful
estates in New South Wales, which extends in romantic park-like
scenery for six miles along the River Hunter, in the county of
Brisbane, three years have sometimes elapsed before the fall of
rain.</p>
<p>The Hunter River may be considered a favourable specimen of an
accessible and long-settled district. The river is now not only
the means of communication by the sea for the produce of its
immediate territory, but also for all the wool and all the
supplies interchanged by the great squatting district of New
England and Liverpool Plains, to which access is obtained by a
deep cleft through a spur of the Australian cordilleras, called
the Liverpool Eange, which bounds the Liverpool Plains in a
northerly direction. A great and increasing steam communication
exists between Sydney and Hunter River.</p>
<p>Port Stephens is a large estuary fifteen miles in length and
contracted to about a mile in breadth in the centre, into which
the rivers Karuah and Myall flow. The Karuah is navigable for
twelve miles only for small craft to Booral, a village built by
the Australian Agricultural Company. The valley of the Karuah, in
the county of Gloucester, is chiefly in the possession of the
Australian Agricultural Company, and pronounced by Count
Strzelecki to be one of the finest agricultural districts in the
colony.</p>
<p>On this estate some of the rarest birds of Australia are
found. The wonga wonga pigeon (<i>Leucosarcia picata</i>) is a
large bird, with white flesh, excellent eating, with handsome
black-patched plumage, which spends most of its time upon the
ground, "feeding upon the seeds of stones of the fallen fruits of
the towering trees under whose shade it dwells, seldom exposing
itself to the rays of the sun, or seeking the open parts of the
forest, whence when disturbed it rises with a loud fluttering,
like a pheasant. Its flight is not of long duration, being merely
employed to remove it to a sufficient distance to avoid detection
by again descending to the ground or mounting the branch of a
tree. It is a species which bears confinement well." The
accompanying engraving, as well as all our illustrations from
natural history, are copied by permission from Mr. Gould's
splendid work on Australia. In Port Stephens harbour, at certain
times of the year, the aborigines may be seen fishing and
disporting in their canoes. Their habits are as uncivilised as
when their ancestors were seen by Cook and Dampier, but quite
harmless.</p>

<p>The park-like scenery, the neatness of the cottages provided
by the company for their servants, the richness of the
vegetation, and the fertility of gardens full of the choicest
fruits and flowers, render this one of the counties which the
traveller who can afford the time should visit, as it affords a
pleasing contrast to the dry, barren country round Sydney, in the
county of Cumberland.</p>
<p>From Booral the Australian Company have an overland
communication with their stations on Liverpool Plains, but they
ship most of their wool at the Hunter,</p>
<p>In the orchards of the Australian Agricultural Company at Port
Stephens, Count Strzelecki mentions that he saw an example of the
extensive range which the beautiful climate of New South Wales
embraces in its isothermal lines&mdash;the English oak
flourishing by the side of the banana, which again was surrounded
by vines, lemons, and orange-trees of luxurious growth. "To the
southward of Port Stephens are a series of thriving farms
spreading along the Goulburn, Pages, Hunter, Paterson, and
Williams Rivers, which comprise an agricultural district of 2,000
square miles in extent. The excellent harbour of Newcastle, good
water and tolerable roads, a coal-mine, a soil well adapted for
wheat, barley, turnips, the vine, and European fruits, and a
situation most favourable to the application of irrigation,
render this district one of the richest and most important in the
colony."</p>
<p>Captain Stokes, in "The Voyage of the Beagle," says: "A change
took place in the features of this portion of the eastern coast:
a number of conical hills, from four to six hundred feet in
height, presented themselves. Two very remarkable headlands,
Wacaba and Tomare, constitute the entrance points of Port
Stephens. The sea face of Tomare is a high line of cliffs.</p>
<p>"On the side of a hill, two miles and a half within the
narrowest part of the harbour, is Tahlee, the residence of the
superintendent. It stands on the crest of a steep grassy slope,
over which are scattered numerous small bushy lemon-trees, the
deep verdure of their foliage interspersed with golden fruit,
contrasting charmingly with the light green carpet from which
they spring. At the foot of this declivity a screen of trees,
rising to a considerable height, almost shuts out the view of the
water, though breaks here and there allow small patches to to be
seen.</p>
<p>"I ascended to Booral, twelve miles up the River Karuah, where
all goods are landed for the company's stations. The treasurer
resides there in a charming cottage, almost covered with roses
and honeysuckles. About two miles within the entrance the river
winds between high and steep banks, densely covered with
creepers, acacias, and other vegetation of a tropical character,
hanging in festoons, the ends floating in the water.</p>
<p>"We were as much delighted as surprised with the richness of
the vegetation, when compared with its dry, parched appearance at
Sydney&mdash;another of the striking characteristics of
Australia."</p>
<p>The next harbour after leaving Port Stephens is Port
Macquarie, which is the outlet of the Rivers Hastings and
Wilson.</p>
<p>Port Macquarie is a bar harbour, into which vessels drawing
more than nine feet water cannot safely enter, but there is a
good anchorage outside. The River Hastings cannot be ascended for
more than ten miles by vessels of any burden; but from the
mountains where it rises it flows in a full although not deep
stream for fifty miles, traversing an undulating district,
chiefly open forest.</p>
<p>Port Macquarie was first founded as a penal settlement. It is
the commencement of a fertile semi-tropical district, extending
to Moreton Bay. The township has gradually decayed since the
penal settlement was discontinued.</p>
<p>The following striking picture is from the work of a gentleman
who was the first to draw public attention to this fine district
* :&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Port Macquarie to Moreton Bay, first explored
and surveyed by Clement Hodgkinson.]</p>
<p>"On entering the surf of the bar of Port Macquarie,
immediately beyond the last breaker, the mirror-like surface of
the river extends in a long reach, whilst on the left dark
serpentine rocks protect the smooth round eminence, covered with
green sward, and crowned by a signal-post, fire-beacon, and
windmill. A little further on is the town, built on a gentle
rise, the tall, square church tower rising conspicuously in the
highest part. A grove of magnificent trees encircles the port,
whilst, turning to the west and north-west, appears a wide extent
of forest country, the windings of the valley among the mountain
ranges through which the River Wilson flows; Mount Caoulapatamba
being sufficiently near to enable one to distinguish every tree
on its grassy declivities."</p>
<p>The soil of the country in the county of Cumberland round
Sydney appears barren, the vegetation harsh and dismal, but "on
the coast of Port Macquarie dense thickets of cabbage-palms and
myrtle-trees extend down the rocky declivities, even within reach
of the spray, and every unwooded patch is covered with grass,
while the lofty forest rising luxuriantly close to the sea
presents a striking contrast to the stunted Banksia thickets and
desiccated scrubs on the sandstone round Sydney. The mountains
approaching near the coast collect vapours from the sea, and
cause frequent rains; in summer heavy thunderstorms mitigate the
heat."</p>
<p>The River Hastings was discovered by Mr. Oxley, a late
surveyor-general, on the report of two shipwrecked mariners whom
he rescued on the coast.</p>
<p>It has been calculated that there are twelve million fertile
acres well watered by small streams. The dividing range of
mountains rises upwards of six thousand feet; on the other side
lies New England&mdash;a range of table land, where a temperate
climate prevails, where potatoes and gooseberries are raised in
perfection, and the settlers retain the rosy bloom of
England,&mdash;one of the finest sheep districts in the colony. A
road has been made across the mountains for bringing down wool to
Port Macquarie.</p>
<p>Shoal Bay, the next harbour, is the embouchure of the River
Clarence, navigable for steamers for more than fifty miles,
flowing through a rich, fertile, and hot country, the reverse of
the New England climate: large boats have ascended as far as
ninety miles. It was surveyed and made public in 1839 by a
private expedition under the charge of S. Perry, Esq. The average
width of this river is from 450 to 600 yards, with a depth of
from six to twenty feet water, the banks from ten to twenty-five
feet above high-water mark. About twenty miles from the mouth is
an island fifteen miles long, and from three to four miles broad;
a range of hills rises in the centre. It is occupied as a cattle
station, and partly for agricultural purposes, by the occupant,
who holds it under a squatting licence.</p>
<p>Grafton is the township of the Clarence district, situated
fifty miles from the mouth of the river. The finest land for
arable purposes is found on the river banks, about thirty miles
from Grafton, where the valley is wider, and the country consists
of a scrub, easily cleared. The climate, too hot for growing
wheat or raising sheep, suits cattle and maize. The sheep
stations are being gradually discontinued. But although the land
is admirably fertile on the banks of the river, at the distance
of a few miles it is barren, with few patches of good soil.</p>
<p>The next river to the Clarence is the Richmond, which waters
an infinitely finer cattle country, better supplied with rich
pasture. The heads of the Richmond are about fifty miles from the
Clarence River. The mouth is obstructed by a bar, dangerous for
vessels drawing more than one hundred tons. After crossing the
bar, the river is deep, winding in a narrow channel. This is one
of the districts from which Sydney draws its chief supply of
cedar.</p>
<p>It is right to mention that the plains lying between the
Clarence and Richmond River, forty miles north of Shoal Bay, and
as far north as Wide Bay, are all taken up and stocked under
squatting licences. The soil is rich and the water advantages
superior, but the climate more hot and less healthy than the
plains on the other side of the range.</p>
<p>The next port, and centre and site of the capital of all this
district, is Moreton Bay, into which flows the Brisbane River,
discovered by Mr. Oxley, on an exploring expedition, in December,
1823. He reported that "when examining Moreton Bay we had the
satisfaction to find the tide sweeping up a considerable inlet
between the first mangrove island and the mainland. A few hours
ended our anxiety: the water became perfectly fresh, and no
diminution had taken place in the size of the river after passing
Sea Reach. The scenery was peculiarly beautiful; the country
along the banks alternately hilly and level, but not flooded; the
soil of the finest description of good brush land, on which grew
timber of great magnitude, some of a description quite unknown to
us, amongst others a magnificent species of pine.* Up to this
point the river was navigable for vessels not drawing more than
sixteen feet of water. The tide rose about five feet, being the
same as at the entrance. We proceeded about thirty miles further,
no diminution having taken place in either the depth or the
breadth of the river, except in one place, for the extent of
thirty yards, where a ridge of detached rocks extended across the
river, not having more than twelve feet upon them at high water.
From this period to Termination Hill the river continued nearly
of uniform size. The tide ascends daily fifty miles up the mouth
of the Brisbane. The country on either side is of very superior
description, and equally well adapted for cultivation or
grazing."</p>
<p class="foot">[* The pine forests mark the commencement and the
boundaries of intertropical Australia.]</p>
<p>On Mr. Oxley's report, which further explorations have proved
to be in no degree exaggerated, a penal settlement was founded at
Brisbane, and among other experiments for employing the
prisoners, sugar was cultivated, until a flood swept the
machinery away. There is no doubt that the climate and soil of
the Moreton Bay district, by which it is better known than by its
parliamentary title, county of Stanley, would produce sugar and
cotton; but that those crops would be remunerative to capitalists
at the present or probable price of labour in Australia is more
than doubtful. Whether any tropical cultivation could be
successfully carried on by families of small freeholders remains
yet to be tried. At some future period when New South Wales has
the power of promoting colonisation without consulting
Downing-street, perhaps families of Germans, of the class that
have at times settled in Brazil, may be induced to try the
experiment.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay is forty-five miles in length, and twenty in
breadth, enclosed between the two islands of Stradbroke and
Maitland. This harbour is rendered unsafe by numerous shoals and
narrow winding passages.</p>
<p>Moreton Bay Island is nineteen miles in length, and four and a
half in breadth. It consists of a series of sandhills one of
which is nine hundred feet in height, quite barren in an
agricultural point of view, but producing a cypress which is a
good furniture wood.</p>
<p>The river Brisbane flows into the bay about the middle of its
western side, with a bar on which there are not more than eleven
feet of water at flood-tide. Large vessels have to anchor about
five miles off, under the shelter of one of the islands.</p>
<p>The towns of Brisbane, north and south, are fourteen miles
from the mouth of the river, and thirty-five miles from Ipswich,
on the River Bremer, an inland port for shipping wool from the
Moreton Bay district.</p>
<p>Steam communication is maintained between Brisbane and
Ipswich, and between Moreton Bay and Sydney.</p>
<p>From Moreton Bay a considerable trade is carried on with
Sydney, and other less-favoured settlements, especially in the
Moreton Bay pine (<i>Auracaria Cunninghami</i>), which is of the
same quality as the Norfolk Island pine, as well as wool and
tallow, the staples of the country.</p>
<p>In the bay and on the coast the aborigines eagerly pursue the
dugong, a species of small whale, generally known to the
colonists as the sea-pig. The head of the dugong is small in
proportion to his body, and is most singularly shaped. The upper
lip is very thick, and flattened at the extremity. It is to this
queer looking snout, we presume, that the animal is indebted for
the swinish cognomen by which it is ordinarily known. The dugong
has a thick smooth skin, with a few hairs scattered over its
surface. Its colour is bluish on the back, with a white breast
and belly. In size the full-grown male has never, we believe,
been found more than eighteen or twenty feet long; but those
commonly taken are much less than this.</p>
<p>The food of the dugong consists chiefly of marine vegetables,
which it finds at the bottom of inlets, in comparatively shallow
water, where it is easily captured. Its flesh resembles good
beef, and is much esteemed. The oil obtained from its fat is
peculiarly clear and limpid, and is free from any disagreeable
smell, such as most animal oils are accompanied with. It has not
yet been produced in sufficient quantities to acquire a
recognised market value.</p>
<p>The blacks devour the carcase roasted, after expressing the
oil for sale to the colonists. A perfumer in Sydney tried to
convert this oil into a new mixture for the hair: unfortunately,
an experiment upon himself and his wife produced baldness instead
of luxuriance, yet its appearance is as fine as sperm.</p>
<p>Behind Moreton Bay, on the other side the mountain range,
forming a district of high tableland and cool temperature, are
the Darling Downs, a magnificent sheep country, which is also
accessible from the Clarence River.</p>
<p>The climate of the Moreton Bay district, like nearly all the
district north of Port Macquarie, is too hot for wheat, which
grows luxuriantly, but is subject to blight: for sheep and cattle
there is no finer country, and maize and all semi-tropical
productions grow in perfection. Grapes ripen, but are too subject
to frosts to make good wine.</p>
<p>A very short distance from the town of Brisbane the clearings
end and the forest commences; now green trees, then pine, then
open plains, and well-watered valleys.</p>
<p>The rainy season of this intertropical region has been
graphically described by Mr. Mossman:&mdash;"Masses of dense scud
rise up from the Pacific Ocean towards the interior, until they
are checked by the southerly wind blowing over the higher, colder
New England country (on the other side of the mountain ranges),
and packed into a uniform mass shrouding the heavens; a stifling
sultriness succeeds, the lightning bursts forth from the lurid
gloom, flash succeeds with fearful rapidity&mdash;now forked from
the zenith, anon like a chain around the verge of the horizon,
while the crash of thunder resounds. The floodgates of the black
canopy are opened&mdash;the rain descends in torrents with a loud
pattering&mdash;soon the narrow tributaries of the river are
swollen, some rising as much as fifty feet in twelve
hours&mdash;the surrounding plains are deluged. In the five
months of rain the earth becomes saturated, the forests drip
continually, while the nearly vertical sun creates a warm, humid,
unhealthy atmosphere." Ophthalmia and general debility follow
this kind of weather; but the author of the passage just quoted
considers that if Indian bungalows were erected by the settlers,
instead of naked English cottages, many of the ill effects of the
rainy season would be avoided.</p>
<p>In the Moreton Bay district may be found many establishments
containing all the luxuries of Europe&mdash;elegant houses,
gardens, libraries, music, pictures, and wives in Parisian
bonnets.</p>
<p>Wide Bay, beyond Moreton Bay, and the boundary of the county
of Stanley, is the last port of the colony of New South Wales: it
receives the waters of the Mary Fitzroy River. The land is
undulating, well timbered, covered with good grass, and suited
for horned stock. Within the last five years a considerable
number of stations have been formed there, and the country taken
up in cattle runs for more than two hundred miles in the
interior. In the 27th parallel of the Wide Bay District grows the
bunya-bunya tree, a species of pine, often from seventeen to
twenty feet in circumference, and upwards of one hundred feet in
height, which once in three years yields a harvest of cones about
a foot long and three quarters in diameter, containing seeds or
kernels, which the natives from the most distant regions
triennially journey to collect, roast, and eat, afterwards
enjoying the relaxation of a little fighting.</p>
<p>Orders have been issued by the colonial government that no
stations be planted and no stock run in this bunya-bunya country,
which occupies a space of about fifty miles in length by ten in
breadth. It will be difficult to enforce this order.</p>
<p>Dr. Leichardt, one of the scientific travellers who has, we
fear, like Cunningham, Gilbert, and Kennedy, fallen a victim to
his adventurous courage in an attempt to penetrate overland to
Swan River, passed some time in the Moreton Bay district,
preparing himself for the successful journey he afterwards made
overland, in 1844, to Port Essington, in Northern Australia. In a
letter addressed to Professor Owen, which is quoted in that
eminent physiologist's "Report on the Extinct Mammals of
Australia," read at the annual meeting of the British
Association, July, 1845, and which accompanied a box of fossil
bones from Darling Downs, he describes his life in terms which
sound sadly and strangely affecting, now that, after succeeding
in his first, he has perished in his second
enterprise:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Living here as the bird lives who flies from tree to
tree&mdash;living on the kindness of a friend fond of my science,
or on the hospitality of the settler and squatter&mdash;with a
little mare I travelled more than 2,500 miles, zigzag, from
Newcastle to Wide Bay, being often my own groom, cook,
washerwoman, geologist, and botanist at the same time; and I
delighted in this life. When next you hear of me, it will be
either that I am lost and dead, or that I have succeeded in
penetrating through the interior to Port Essington."</p>
<p>Leichardt set out on this expedition, and left Jimba, the last
station on the Darling Downs, 30th September, 1844, and reached
Port Essington in December of the same year. The privations he
endured were terrible. Mr. Gilbert, a naturalist in the
employment of Mr. Gould, fell a sacrifice to the savages. More
than once the bronze-winged pigeon, flying to water, saved them
from dying of thirst.</p>

<br>
<p>To the parties engaged in this expedition the Legislative
Council voted £1,000, and 1,500 was raised by private
subscription for the same purpose. Of these two sums, £1,450 were
presented to Dr. Leichardt. He lost no time in preparing a second
expedition, for the purpose of "exploring the interior of
Australia, the extent of Sturt's desert, and the character of the
western and north-western coast, and to observe he gradual change
in vegetation and animal life from one side of the continent to
the other." This expedition set out in December, 1846, and was
expected to occupy not less than two years and a half in reaching
Swan River. The following is the last letter ever received from
him, addressed to a friend in Sydney:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I take the last opportunity of giving you an account
of my progress. For eleven days we travelled from Mr. Birell's
station, on the Condamine, to Mr. Macpherson's, on the Fitzroy
Downs. Though the country was occasionally very difficult, yet
everything went on well. My mules are in excellent order, my
companions in excellent spirits. Three of my cattle are footsore,
but I shall kill one of them to-night to lay in our necessary
stock of dried beef.</blockquote>

<br>
<small>DR. LEICHARDT.</small></p>
<br>
<blockquote>"The Fitzroy Downs, over which we travelled or about
twenty-two miles from east to west, is indeed a splendid region,
and Sir Thomas Mitchell has not exaggerated their beauty in his
account. The soil is pebbly and sound, richly grassed, and, to
judge from the myall, of most fattening quality. I came right on
Mount Abundance, and passed over a gap of it with my whole train.
My latitude agreed well with Mitchell's. I fear that the absence
of water on Fitzroy Downs will render this fine country to a
great degree unavailable. I observe the thermometer daily at 6
<small>A.M.</small> and <small>P.M.</small>, which are the only
convenient hours. I have tried the wet thermometer, but I am
afraid my observations will be very deficient. I shall, however,
improve on them as I proceed. The only serious accident that has
happened was the loss of a spade; but we are fortunate enough to
make it up on this station, where the superintendent is going to
spare us one of his.<br>
<br>
"Though the days are still very hot, the beautiful clear nights
are cool, and benumb the musquitoes, which have ceased to trouble
us. Myriads of flies are the only annoyance we have.<br>
<br>
"Seeing how much I have been favoured in my present progress, I
am full of hope that our Almighty Protector will allow me to
bring my darling scheme to a successful termination.&mdash;Your
most sincere friend,<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:right;">"<span class="a">Ludwig
Leichardt</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<small><span class="a">Mr. Macpherson's Station, Cogoon</span>,
April 3, 1848."</small></blockquote>
<br>
<p>There is now little doubt that the brave Leichardt was
murdered by savages shortly after leaving Cogoon.</p>
<p>It would be impossible in any reasonable space to convey a
correct idea of the physical character of a country like
Melbourne, Port Jackson, and Wide Bay, which extends over more
than eight hundred miles of coast range alone.* But the
distinctive features of this north-eastern coast, as far as
Moreton Bay, have been very clearly summed up by Mr. Clement
Hodgkinson, in his before-quoted work:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* Port Albury, recently discovered near Cape
York, on Albury Island, affords a good and ready anchorage and
easy access to vessels to or from Torres Straits or Sydney.]</p>
<p>"First. Its geological formation, which, instead of being
sandstone, which so generally predominates on the Hunter,
consists of rocks of primitive or transition origin, such as
granite, trap, ancient limestone, slates, &amp;c., all which in
Australia furnish, by their decomposition, a much more fertile
surface than sandstone.</p>
<p>"Secondly. The mountainous nature of the country, the great
altitude of the mountains exceeding six thousand feet above the
level of the sea, and their proximity to the coast.</p>
<p>"Thirdly. The abundance of water and the proximity of
navigable rivers. From Moreton Bay to Macquarie, in 270 miles of
coast, there are nine rivers with bar harbours, which can be
entered by coasting vessels and small steamers, viz., the
Brisbane, Tweed, Richmond, Clarence, Bellergen, Macleary,
Hastings, Camden Haven, and the Manning.</p>
<p>"Lastly. The fitness of the rich alluvial soil, which extends
in continuous narrow borders of brush land along these rivers,
for tropical cultivation (if labour could be applied at not too
great a cost at clearing away the brush)."</p>
<p>Thus it will be observed that the north and north-eastern
track of New South Wales, lying between the mountains and the
sea, is exempt from the aridity which characterises a large
portion of Australia.</p>
<p>Retracing our steps, we will now take a glance at what may be
called the transmontane regions, lying parallel to the coast
district just described, separated by the dividing range of the
Blue Mountains, or, as it has been lately termed, the Australian
Cordilleras.</p>
<p>Passing the dividing range which separates the hot lower
countries watered by the Brisbane and the Clarence, we reach
Darling Downs (discovered by Allan Cunningham, the king's
botanist, in 1830, when he travelled from Sydney to Moreton Bay
by land), which are watered by the river of the same name. These
downs are part of a system of high table lands continued toward
the north, where the boundaries are indefinite, by the Fitzroy
Downs, discovered by Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1846, and toward the
south by the New England district. There a rapid descent changes
the climate from snow and hail to the hot country of the Peel,
Page, and the Liverpool Plains, bounded on the south by the great
dividing or Liverpool Range, through which Pandora's Pass gives
exit to the Hunter River; and thus with intervals of mountain
range or desert, a series of pastoral plains run parallel with
the interior of the mountain range which encircles the eastern
coast of Australia, including the Goulburn, Bathurst district,
the Maneroo or Brisbane Downs, and the Murray district, which
flow into, if we may use the term, the province of Victoria. And
in this series of pastoral plains the climate is considerably
modified by their altitude above the sea. It was these plains,
where fine-woolled sheep increase and multiply at the least
possible expense, which first gave exports and wealth to
Australia. Before the shepherd and his flock the savage and the
emu gradually disappear.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>
<h4>JOURNEY FROM PORT JACKSON TO PORT PHILLIP.</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> traversing the coast from Port
Jackson to Port Phillip there is a singular absence of good
harbours. The first. Botany Bay, fourteen miles from Port
Jackson, receives the waters of the George River, on which the
township of Liverpool was planted by Macquarie, but has not
flourished; and the Cook's River which has been dammed, for the
purpose of affording a supply of fresh water to Sydney. Botany
Bay is unsheltered, and offers indifferent accommodation for
small vessels. A brass plate on the cliffs marks the spot where
Captain Cook first landed; and the stranger may drink from the
well of fresh water opened by that illustrious navigator.</p>
<p>Between Botany Bay and Shoalhaven is Illawarra, also known as
the Five Islands, one of the most fertile and wildly beautiful
districts in the world, which, from the peculiarity of its
situation, bounded by the sea for eighteen miles, running north
and south, and by a mountain chain which encircles about 150,000
acres, unites the peculiarities of both temperate and tropical
climates, a sort of Norway or Switzerland, rocks, lakes, fat
alluvial valleys, under a southern sun, tempered by breezes from
the sea. We descend from the landward side by crossing a range of
hills 1,500 feet in height, so precipitous that it is difficult
for a horseman to ride down, and, without dismounting, impossible
for a loaded dray to descend.</p>
<p>The communication with Sydney, which Illawarra supplies with
large quantities of fruit, vegetables, and agricultural produce,
is chiefly carried on by coasters from the small harbour of
Wollongong, a favourite resort for invalids. Here is a celebrated
show-garden, where may be seen fruits and English watercress,
tropical oranges, pomegranates, nectarines, and bananas, and
avenues covered with grape-bearing vines of all colours. Here is
Illawarra Lake, too, than which it is scarcely possible to
conceive anything more picturesquely beautiful, environed by
rocks and tropical vegetation, peopled with bright-coloured
birds.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A beautiful and accurate view of this lake was
given in Prout's Australian Panorama.]</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>BLACKS UNDER GUNYAH.</small></p>
<br>
<p>At Illawarra the palm and the tree-fern flourish, and from
land as fertile, and cultivation as careful, as that of
Devonshire, a short walk may bring you to a camp of aborigines
sheltering from the warm rain beneath their gunyah, the nearest
approach to a hut which these poor creatures have contrived.</p>
<p>Jervis Bay&mdash;in the county of St. Vincent where the
township of South Huskisson has been founded&mdash;is eighty
miles from Sydney, with an entrance two miles wide, and an inner
harbour three leagues in length, safe for ships of the heaviest
burden, with access to ample supplies of wood and water, and
presents a total change of climate. Unfortunately, this fine port
is surrounded by a hopelessly barren country. It has been
suggested by Mr. Ralfe, an experienced Australian surveyor, that
Jervis Bay should become the terminus of a railway from the
Bathurst district. A railway for wool and tallow would be a very
doubtful speculation; but recent events have laid the foundation
for more important exports and imports. Perhaps by following the
course of streams it would be possible to find workable gradients
for a tramway on the Welsh coal-mining or American plan.</p>
<p>The next ports, Ulladulla and Bateman's Bay, the outlet of the
Clyde River, are only accessible for coasters; but the latter has
recently come into notice from the discovery of the
gold-diggings, distant only thirty miles: that thirty miles being
over a country of so difficult a character that a party with
loaded packhorses were three days in crossing it.</p>
<p>The last harbour in the New South Wales district is Twofold
Bay, 240 miles from Sydney, on which two townships have been
founded, Eden by the government, and Boyd Town by the late
Benjamin Boyd, with the funds of a Scotch company which he
represented. Eden has never been anything better than a
government project at the expense of a few foolish land
speculators. Boyd Town enjoyed a brief period of factitious
prosperity, when the steamers, whalers, and yacht of the founder
lay in harbour. It was at Boyd Town he appeared with almost
viceroyal state, when laying the first stone of the never lighted
lighthouse; and it was there that he landed the island cannibals
whom he had purchased from their savage conquerors, with the view
of reducing wages by introducing slavery into Australia, rather
than encourage shepherd families upon his boundless
sheep-runs.</p>
<p>The steep range of hills which separates Twofold Bay from the
vast squatting district of Maneroo has hitherto, in spite of a
road constructed at much expense by Mr. Boyd, to a great degree
neutralised its advantageous position as the only harbour for
large ships on a long line of coast. It is still used as a
station for shore whalers being almost the only station for that
purpose in the colony. There has been a great falling off in the
whaling operations of the Sydney merchants.</p>
<p>The Australian whalers are for the most part from 200 to 300
tons burden. All on board, from the captain downwards, are paid
by a share of the oil procured, which share is called, in
whalemen's parlance, a "lay," and is proportioned of course to
the rank and ability of the man. There is one feature of this
trade in the Pacific which is not generally known&mdash;the
intercourse of those who follow it with the tribes of Polynesia.
Whaling captains generally seek some of the islands for the
purpose of procuring supplies of provisions, or of repairing
slight damages sustained at sea; because, in the first place,
they can obtain provisions there at infinitely less cost than in
any of the colonial ports; and, in the second place, they find it
easier to keep their men together. Supplies arc frequently
procured in boats, without bringing the vessel to an anchor.
These supplies, consisting of pigs and fowls, with yams,
cocoanuts, bread-fruit, and other productions of a similar
nature, are procured by barter: calicoes, hardware, common
trinkets, and other matters likely to be prized by the untutored
islanders being carried for that purpose. These articles are
technically known as "trade." All the precautions which the
captains can take are insufficient to prevent occasional
desertion; and extraordinarily numerous as are the islands of the
Pacific, there is scarcely one of them which has not one or more
runaway sailors domesticated among the people who inhabit
it.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The runaway sailors and escaped convicts
dwelling in the islands of the Pacific have been estimated at
many thousands, but great numbers have been attracted from their
retreats by the Californian and Australian gold diggings.]</p>
<h5>VICTORIA.</h5>
<p>From Twofold Bay, passing Cape Howe, which receives the point
of the imaginary line dividing the provinces of New South Wales
and Victoria, no harbour presents itself until we reach Corner
Inlet, within which is Alberton, on the River Albert, the capital
of the fine district of Gipps's Land; unfortunately it is
obstructed by a bar. Then follows Western Port, discovered by
George Bass in his whale-boat, a port formed by two islands, Port
Phillip, Port Fairy and Portland Bay. Leaving Western Port, we
enter the now world-famous Port Phillip, an inland sea, which
receives the ships whose cargoes or passengers are destined for
the towns of Melbourne and Geelong.</p>
<p>The entrance to Port Phillip Bay is little more than one mile
and a half across. On the one hand Point Nepean, a low sandy
promontory, like a rabbit-warren without rabbits, at the base of
the cape: beyond rises for a thousand feet Arthur's Seat, a woody
range of hills, precipitous towards the sea, with barely room for
a road between its foot and the flood-tide. In the distance, on
the same margin, Mount Eliza, a range of hills, with extensive
outline, mark the bounds of Port Phillip Bay. On the other side
the lowlands of Indented Head and Shortland Bluff present a dull
scene, sprinkled with funereal shiak or "she oak trees."</p>
<p>The rush of waters through the narrow canal into this Great
Lake, nearly fifty miles in length by twenty-five in breadth,
which forms Port Phillip, in certain states of the wind and tide,
creates a foaming, stormy whirl of water not a little alarming to
the inexperienced landsman. Within the bay the waters calm down,
and a beautiful and picturesque scene is unrolled.</p>
<p>At Port Phillip Bay the great dividing range which runs
parallel at varying distances with the coast from Wide Bay,
penetrating New South Wales under various names (the Blue
Mountains near Sydney, the Australian Alps in Gipps's Land),
seems to sink into the sea across Bass's Straits, where its
course is marked by a chain of islands, and reappears with the
same character in Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Thus it is that, sailing up the bay, the scenery changes: the
rugged cliffs and alpine ranges of the east coast give way to
undulating grassy plains, sprinkled with picturesque hills. The
western arm of Port Phillip, extending about twenty miles, opens
the course to Geelong. In sailing up the bay the hills around
Geelong appear, covered with cultivation.</p>
<p>Ships of burden for Melbourne cast anchor in Hobson's Bay, at
the mouth of the River Yarra, off Williams Town, which is built
on a flat promontory, with three sides to the water. Williams
Town was laid out by Sir Richard Bourke as the seaport of Port
Phillip, for which the situation affords advantages; but the want
of good drinking water has hitherto hindered it from making any
progress since the years of the mania when town lots were sold
there at a great price. It contains the harbour-master's
residence, two or three public-houses, a few butcher's shops, a
clergyman's house, and a small temporary church. An aqueduct or
water-pipes would soon make Williams Town an important place.</p>
<p>The shores of the Yarra are so even with Hobson's Bay that
from the anchorage the entrance can scarcely be
distinguished.</p>
<p>From Hobson's Bay, taking a boat for a mile, a walk or ride of
a mile and a half will bring the traveller to Melbourne; but by
the winding channel of the river, which is just wide and deep
enough to admit the steamers which ply constantly from Sydney and
Geelong, the distance is seven miles.</p>
<p>"Passing the junction of the Maryburrong, or Salt-water River,
on the bank of which are beautiful villa sites, the Melbourne
race-course, and several establishments for boiling down sheep
and cattle into tallow, which give out a most villanous odour,
the city, of which only an indistinct glimpse was to be observed
from the bay, comes in view; the cathedral, a heavy building,
without a tower or a steeple; and the government offices, built
of stone, without ornament, on the highest point of the hill."
The voyage ends in a sort of pool where steamers can find room to
turn round and take up a berth alongside the quay. A breakwater
has been erected on the foundation of a natural ledge of rocks
which effectually divides the fresh water from the salt.</p>
<p>Melbourne occupies two sides of a valley, East Hill and West
Hill, of very fertile soil. Inferior in port accommodation and in
picturesque beauty to Sydney, it has the advantage of being in
the midst of productive corn-fields, gardens, vineyards, and
pastures.</p>
<p>The principal street is a mile long, crossed at right angles
by other streets of half that length: a macadamised causeway runs
down the middle, leaving a strip on each side to be converted
into mud in the rainy season. The footpaths for the most part are
of gravel, with kerbstones. So far there is an improvement. Some
years ago a traveller was shocked the day after his arrival by
seeing among the announcements in a local paper, "Another Child
drowned in the Streets of Melbourne."</p>
<p>The buildings present the irregularity incident to all
colonial towns; occasionally great gaps of building land were to
be found representing investments made eight or ten years ago by
absentee speculators. But the gold revolution has covered every
vacant space with weather-board huts and tents. The chief lion
work of Melbourne is a stone bridge across the Yarra, of the same
size and proportions as the centre arch of London-bridge, which
cost an enormous sum.</p>
<p>The population was about twenty thousand in 1851; what it is
at present it is impossible to say. It is to be feared that
houses will be built more rapidly than the present streets will
be drained and rendered wholesome. The lower part of Melbourne is
subject to sudden floods from the falling of rains and melting of
snow in the range of hills in which the Yarra takes its rise. An
Australian flood is "short, sharp, and decisive."</p>
<p>From the summit of either East or West Hill, by which the
valley of Melbourne is formed, may be seen Mount Macedon, the
crowning mountain of a range of the same name thirty-five miles
from the city, three thousand feet in height, covered with open
forests, and the richest vegetation of Australia. Thence may be
viewed the richest mountain in the world, the Mount Byng of its
discoverer Mitchell, the Mount Alexander in gold-digging records.
To the north of Mount Alexander is Mount Hope, from the summit of
which the weary eyes of Mitchell were gladdened by all the sylvan
pastoral glories of "Australia Felix."</p>
<p>Fifty-four miles from Melbourne, by sea or land, with access
by steamers several times in the day, is Geelong, the western arm
of Port Phillip, which "opens on the larboard hand of a vessel
immediately upon clearing the shoals at the entrance of the Great
Lake, standing between the miniature Bay of Corio with its
picturesque green hills and sheltered water, and the River
Barwon, which flows into the Lake Connemarra."</p>
<p>The situation, in the centre of one of the best grazing and
agricultural districts, near a gold-field, will probably render
it an important town. A bar at the mouth of the harbour at
present restricts the entry of vessels drawing more than ten feet
water; but this, it is thought, may be removed by dredging.
Should this be the case, the province of Victoria will enjoy the
advantage of two excellent available ports, and have two great
towns. In the other provinces there seems no probability of any
rival competing with Sydney or Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>Forty miles from Geelong the Buninyong range forms part of the
second series of mountains, after the termination of the
Australian Alps. At Ballarat, one of the spurs of Buninyong, in
the midst of plains of unequalled fertility, the first gold-field
in Victoria was worked.</p>
<p>In proceeding along the coast to the point where an imaginary
line divides Victoria from South Australia, the whole coast line
of the former being about 600 miles, the most important harbour
is found in Portland Bay, 255 miles from Melbourne. Three
streams, none of them navigable, fall into this bay, which is
little better than a roadstead, and very dangerous when the
south-easterly gales, which prevail during the summer months, are
blowing. The government has been compelled to pay one pound a ton
more chartering for vessels to Portland Bay than to Hobson's Bay.
The north shore is low; the western rises in bold cliffs, upwards
of 150 feet.</p>
<p>It was at Portland Bay that one of the earliest settlements
was formed by one of Messrs. Henty's whaling parties, on which
the land explorers came, to their great surprise, after many
weeks' journey through an unknown, uninhabited country.</p>
<p>The Portland Bay district receives streams from the Grampians,
a range running to the northward, of which Mount William, the
extreme eastern point, is 4,500 feet in height. Mitchell ascended
Mount Abrupt, on the south-eastern extremity of the Grampian
range, and beheld from the edge of an almost perpendicular
precipice, 1,700 feet in height, vast open plains, bordered with
forests and studded with lakes. "Certainly a land more favourable
could not be found. Flocks might be turned out upon its hills, or
the plough at once set agoing upon its plains. No primeval
forests require to be first rooted out here, although there is as
much timber as could be needed for utility or ornament."
Australia Felix is one of the few regions in which the sanguine
expectations of the discoverers have been realised.</p>

<br>
<small>GOLD-WASHING AT BALLARAT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>It will be found on examining a map of the province of
Victoria and of the Melbourne district&mdash;and a most excellent
one has been published by Mr. Ham, of Melbourne&mdash;that it has
three natural divisions. The central division, including
Australia Felix and Mount Alexander, finds its natural port and
capital in Melbourne. The western division, including Portland
Bay, for want of a better harbour, finds its outlet chiefly at
Geelong. The eastern division, including Gipps's Land, finds
partly an outlet at Western Port; but Gipps's Land must export
and import through Alberton.</p>
<p>Victoria has many streams and rivulets, mentioned in our table
of the counties at page 255, but no rivers navigable in the
European sense of the term.</p>
<p>Gipps's Land was discovered by Count Strzelecki, C.B., who is
equally eminent as a scientific traveller and philanthropist. The
honour has been claimed for a Mr. Macmillan, who communicated his
discovery to his employers some months before the count published
his report. This is probable. Stockmen have been the first
explorers of most of the finest pasture districts of Australia;
but it is contrary to the custom and interest of squatters to
make such discoveries public.</p>
<p>In the count's report to Sir George Gipps he says: "Seventeen
miles S.S.E. from Lake Omeo, a beautiful stream, the first of the
eastern waters, soon assumed the breadth of a river, and appeared
to be a guide into a country hitherto unoccupied by white men. A
hilly country closes the valley, narrows the river banks, and
brings the explorer across the mountain ridges to an elevation
whence there is a view of the sea on the distant horizon; to the
south-east an undulating country, with mountain ridges to the
north-east. Approaching or receding from the river, according to
the windings of its bordering hills, the descent into a noble
forest is effected. A series of rich pasture valleys, prairies,
and open forests are intersected and studded with rivers, lakes,
and wooded hills; the pastures opening out and sloping towards
the sea." Strzelecki describes Gipps's Land, viewed from Mount
Gisborne, as resembling a semi-lunar amphitheatre, walled from
north-east to south-west by lofty picturesque mountain scenery,
and sloping towards the south-east down to the sea.</p>
<p>In 1840 Strzelecki was engaged for twenty-six days in cutting
his way through the scrub-covered ranges between Gipps's Land and
Western Port, was obliged to abandon his packhorses, and he and
his party did not escape without imminent danger both from famine
and exhaustion.</p>
<p>In 1844 Mr. Hawdon, with a party of twelve able-bodied men,
including black native police, was instructed by the government
to open up a practicable route for cattle from Western Port to
Gipps's Land. He has published a very interesting account of his
expedition, with some spirited illustrations. He was engaged
thirty days in the task, and he, too, very nearly perished in the
scrub; yet he considered himself well repaid for the famine and
fatigue he had endured "by the sight of the fine
plains&mdash;Barney's Plains of the map&mdash;beyond the
Glengarry." The good country lies upwards of fifty miles from the
government township of Victoria founded on the Albert River.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of Mr. Hawdon that the greater part of the
scrub country through which he travelled would be capable of
cultivation if cleared. This scrubby tract is nowhere found in
Victoria except between Gipps's Land and Western Port.</p>
<p>It was while performing this journey that he had an
opportunity of closely examining the shy and curious lyre bird
(<i>Menura superba</i>), which is peculiar to Australia, and only
found on the south-eastern coast. The settlers sometimes called
it a pheasant, but it is in reality one of the thrush family.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image24" id="Image24"></a><img alt=""
src="1400441h-images/Image24.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>LYRE BIRD.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"I was awakened," writes Mr. Hawdon, "at sunrise by the
singing of numerous pheasants. These are the mocking-birds of
Australia, imitating all sounds that are heard in the bush in
great perfection; they are about the size of a small fowl, of a
dirty brown colour, approaching to black in some parts; their
greatest attraction consists in the graceful tail of the cock
bird, which is something like a lyre. But little is known of
their habits, for it is seldom they are found near the dwellings
of civilised man.</p>
<p>"Hearing one scratching in the scrub close to the dray, I
crawled out, gun in hand, intending to provide a fresh meal for
breakfast. The sun having just risen, inclined it to commence its
morning song; but the natural note (bleu bleu) was almost lost
among the multitude of imitative sounds through which it
ran&mdash;croaking like a crow, then screaming like a cockatoo,
chattering like a parrot, and howling like the native
dog&mdash;until a stranger might have fancied that he was in the
midst of them all. Creeping cautiously round a point of scrub, I
came in view of a large cock bird, strutting round in a circle,
scratching up the leaves and mould with his formidable claws,
while feeding upon a small leech which is the torment of
travellers, and spreading open his beauteous tail to catch the
rays of the sun as it broke through the dense forest. As I raised
my gun a piece went off within six feet of me: it was one of the
black police who had blown the bird's head off that had been
amusing me for more than an hour."</p>
<p>These birds when disturbed never rise high, but run off into
the densest scrub, scarcely allowing a sportsman time to raise
his piece before they are out of his reach. Even the aborigines,
who are so skilful in creeping up to game of all kinds, seldom
kill more than three brace in a day. Their song is not often
heard during rain, or when the sun is obscured. "The nest is
about three feet in circumference, and one foot deep, having an
orifice on one side: they lay but one egg, of slate colour with
black spots. The female is a very unattractive bird, having but a
poor tail, nothing like the male."</p>
<p>Gipps's Land, with its boundary of snow-capped precipitous
mountains, its fine plains, many lakes, and temperate climate,
may be considered as one of the several contrasts of soil,
climate, and vegetation, of which Darling Downs, Moreton Bay,
Illawarra, and Bathurst, each afford different examples.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>
<h4>SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> River Glenelg, flowing into the
sea, marks the natural boundary between the province of Victoria
and that of South Australia, thence embracing a seaboard of about
fifteen hundred miles, into which no river navigable by vessels
of burden flows, and only two ports have as yet been found
capable of safely accommodating ships of burden. As a
compensation, inland journeys may be performed with little
obstruction, on horseback or by drays, for hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>The first important indentation in to the line of the coast is
Encounter Bay; but there are coasting ports at Rivoli Bay and
Guichen Bay, at which wool has been shipped. Hopes were once
confidently entertained of finding an entrance from the sea to
the River Murray, but it has unfortunately proved that this, the
noblest stream in Australia, ends in the Lake Alexandrina, and is
divided from the ocean by a barrier of land and a surf-beaten sea
margin.</p>
<p>Cape Jervis forms the apex of the county of Hindmarsh, which
is for the most part occupied by industrious settlers, although
the promontory itself is rather barren, and only known for its
shore whale fishery. On rounding this cape, Kingscote Harbour and
Nepean Bay appear on the opposite shores of Kangaroo
Island&mdash;excellent harbours, and one of them well supplied
with water. Unfortunately they lead to nothing. The buildings
erected by the South Australian Company in 1837 were permitted to
fall into decay. Recently a few stock stations have been taken up
on the island, and about one hundred persons are resident
there.</p>
<p>The kangaroos and the emus, so numerous in Flinders' time,
have disappeared; and the large white eagles that stooped upon
his men, mistaking them for kangaroos, have become rare.</p>
<p>Entering St. Vincent's Gulf, and passing Holdfast Bay, where
Governor Hindmarsh disembarked, and Mrs. Hindmarsh's piano was
floated ashore through the surf&mdash;for it is no harbour at
all, but a dangerous open roadstead&mdash;passing a number of
seaside villages, Port Adelaide is reached. By dint of dredging,
and with the advantage of quays, this has become a safe and
convenient harbour; and, with the aid of the intended railroad,
will afford the city of Adelaide nearly as much convenience as if
it had been planted on a navigable river, or on a deep
harbour;&mdash;that was impossible, since no site exists in South
Australia combining a good harbour, agricultural land, and fresh
water. No other port presents itself in St. Vincent's Gulf,
unless we except Port Wakefield, to which vessels from Swansea
with cargoes of coal for smelting copper have recently been
consigned. It has been proposed to construct a tramway between
this port and the Burra Burra mines, and an attempt would have
been made to execute this project if the gold diggings had not
temporarily withdrawn all English speculation from South
Australia.</p>
<p>The whole sea face of York Peninsula and Spencer's Gulf is
unfavourable to the formation of a port and town, until we arrive
at Port Lincoln, on the western arm of Spencer's Gulf, where a
natural harbour could receive the largest squadron that ever went
to sea&mdash;a landlocked estuary, protected at its mouth by
Boston Island, with three arms or bays, Spalding Cove, Port
Lincoln proper, and Boston Bay. But these harbours, viewed with
so much admiration by seamen, are silent; no busy population
labours on the shores, a few scattered flocks and herds are all
that the mainland supports; and the allotments, which were
competed for so eagerly in the years of land mania, are left to
nature and a few wandering cattle.</p>
<p>On entering Port Lincoln, a white obelisk, on the summit of a
hill, may be seen, which bears the following inscription by Sir
John and Lady Franklin:&mdash;</p>

<br>
<small>LIEUT.-GOVERNOR OF VAN DIEMEN'S LAND.</small></p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir John Franklin served under Flinders in the
Terra Australis Voyage of Discovery.]</p>
<p>To pursue the coast line of the province of Victoria to 132 of
E. longitude, where it ends in a desert, would be useless, as no
rivers or harbours break the line of this almost uninhabited
coast.</p>
<p>Equally absurd would it be to state&mdash;as South Australian
advocates who do not know the value of truth frequently
do&mdash;that South Australia contains an area of 300,000 square
miles, or nearly twenty millions of acres, without adding that a
very large proportion of this vast space is occupied by stony
deserts and lakes of mud. Nevertheless, enough of land remains
admirably fertile and well watered to support a large population,
much larger than is likely to occupy it for a long series of
years. In the most inhospitable regions, copper, lead, silver,
and iron have been found; and there is no reason to doubt that
gold will eventually be discovered.</p>
<p>The district in a north-westerly direction, between Port
Lincoln and Streaky Bay, has been but imperfectly explored, and,
with the exception of a few detached squatters' stations,
settlement has not extended beyond the peninsula formed between
the River Murray and St. Vincent's Gulf, the furthest inland
township being founded by the Burra Burra mine, ninety miles from
the capital.</p>
<p>South Australia is intersected by three mountain
ranges,&mdash;Mount Lofty, Mount Barker, and Wakefield.</p>
<p>The Mount Lofty range runs from north-west, and after
attaining a height of about 2,000 feet, twelve miles east of
Adelaide, falls to the south-west, terminating in low cliffs on
the seashore near Ockaparinga.</p>
<p>From these hills Adelaide, in the valley of the Torrens,
presents a singular scene&mdash;a green oasis in the midst of a
bed of sand, running like a riband along the sea by which it has
been upheaved.</p>
<p>Capital farms occupy the foot of Mount Lofty, with a sure
market in Adelaide. A steep road leads across the hills or
mountains; on the other side rich but not extensive valleys are
found; in one of these, twenty-four miles from Adelaide, is
Hansdorf, one of three German settlements to which South
Australia owes much in vine culture and sheep management. Beyond,
parallel with Mount Lofty, is the Mount Barker range, the summit
being 800 feet above the level of the surrounding country, which
is about 1,600 feet above the level of the sea. The summit forms
table-land, on which there are some good cattle and sheep
stations. This is the range which divides the waters that flow on
the one side into the Murray and Lake Alexandrina, and on the
other into Spencer's Gulf.</p>
<p>To the north of Adelaide a long tract of level, well-watered
country extends, which, at about one hundred miles' distance,
opens into a series of high, open downs.</p>
<p>The River Torrens, which formed so prominent a feature in
early puffs and pictures of the colony, is not a river at all,
but, like many of the misnamed rivers of Australia, simply a
watercourse, which during the rainy season rushes along
furiously, ending in a marsh; but when the rains cease, the
"river" becomes a mere chain of pools, unreplenished with
mountain springs, which shrink daily with the heat, like a
farmyard rain-filled pond, such as are common on the wolds of
Lincolnshire. Colonel Light saw the Torrens when full of water,
and that and the beauty of the valley decided his choice.
Fortunately water is to be obtained in Adelaide, by sinking
wells, at a very moderate expense; and the same advantage is
found on farms, and in the slopes of the neighbouring hills. But
in this instance of the Torrens, as in many others, the
injudicious puffs of speculators reacted and threw undeserved
discredit on the solid advantages of a very fine colony.</p>
<p>The one great river of Australia is the Murray, which, rising
in the Australian Alps, where its sources were discovered by
Count Strzelecki near Mount Kosciusko, in Victoria, receives the
waters of the Murrumbidgee, the Lachlan, and the Darling, and
presents, at certain times of the year, so full and flowing a
stream that the early colonists expected to draw down its waters
the commerce of the squatting districts of Yass and Albury, in
New South Wales; for they calculated that the cheapness of an
unbroken water communication would draw away the dray traffic,
which was then, and is now, carried to Sydney. But the uncertain
supply of water, and the obstacles arising from rocks and snags,
have hitherto defeated this project.</p>
<p>The Murrumbidgee rises in the dividing range of mountains in
the Maneroo district, two hundred and fifty miles S.W. of the
city of Sydney, then flows onwards for five hundred miles, until
it unites with the Lachlan at a point where the brave Sturt took
a boat and descended to the sea in thirty-six days, when he
discovered South Australia, returning in forty days&mdash;thus
earning the title of the father of South Australia.</p>
<p>The early course of the Murrumbidgee is between hills steeply
sloping, covered with herbage and creeping vines, down to the
water's edge. "As I sat in a boat," writes a lady to the author,
"I could see above me small, very small cattle, in single
file&mdash;now lost in the foliage, now reappearing, as by zigzag
well-worn paths they descended to the water to drink. So lofty
and steep were the cliffs that I fancied they would fall down
upon me. At length they made their appearance at the edge of the
stream, drinking beneath bowers of overhanging creepers&mdash;a
huge bull and a mob of portly cows."</p>
<p>The space encircled between this river and the Murray (the
Murray was formerly named the Hume by its discoverers, Hovel and
Hume) is one of the fine squatting grounds of New South Wales.
Higher up the stream the hills disappear, and long alluvial flats
succeed. The Murrumbidgee spreads and loses some of its waters in
the marshes of the Lachlan.</p>
<p>It is the peculiar character of the Murray, the Darling, and
the Murrumbidgee, that after receiving the waters of the Maranoa,
the Balorme, the Gwydir, the Namoi, the Castlereagh, the
Macquarie, and the Bogan, they flow hundreds of miles without
receiving any tributaries.</p>
<p>The navigation of the River Murray has been the subject of a
commission appointed by Sir Henry Young, the present Governor of
South Australia; and, although the financial calculations of the
commission have been questioned by a committee of the South
Australian Legislative Council, it is presumed their facts may be
relied on. They are quoted from the abstract of a gentleman (Mr.
White) who was endeavouring to obtain steamers to open the
navigation of this river:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"In August, 1850, the Legislative Council of that
province voted '£4,000 to be equally divided between the two
first iron steamers of not less than forty horse power, and not
exceeding two feet draught of water when loaded, that shall
successfully navigate the waters of the River Murray from the
Goolwa to the junction of the Darling, computed to be about five
hundred and fifty-one miles.'<br>
<br>
"1st. The natural seamouth of the Murray cannot be entered, owing
to the great surf that is constantly breaking on the Encounter
Bay coast, and consequently any vessels intended to navigate the
river would have to be constructed on the shores of the Lake
Alexandrina.<br>
<br>
"2nd. This lake, into which the river empties itself previous to
its passage to the sea, is about thirty miles long by ten broad,
and from six to eighteen fathoms deep, and fresh water is found
about the middle.<br>
<br>
"3rd. The river preserves an uniform width of about three hundred
yards to the junction of the Darling, which latter river is about
one hundred yards wide, and the width of the Murray is not
materially altered onwards to the junction cf the Murrumbidgee
and the Lachlan. The soundings that have been made from the Lake
to the Darling, in the months of September and October, give an
average depth of two fathoms, or rather, this may be said to be
the shallowest.<br>
<br>
"The Murray is subject, like all the other streams in the
country, to annual floods. It begins to rise towards the end of
June, and continues rising until the end of January, generally
from ten to twelve feet.<br>
<br>
"The only impediments that occur are in the shape of snags or
fallen trees, which in some places would have to be removed; but
for this the assistance of the natives could be obtained, and up
to the junction of the Darling they present no serious obstacle.
This point being the limit of the province, the river beyond has
not been surveyed; but from those who have descended it so far as
the town of Albury (a distance of only three hundred and sixty
miles from Sydney) it has been ascertained that, before
steam-vessels of the smallest size could navigate it, the snags
would have to be removed, though a canoe, drawing eleven inches
of water, went the entire distance at a time when the river was
lower than has been known within the memory of the 'white man.'
From a point in the channel of the Goolwa, which is a stream
issuing from the lake, and also one of the mouths of the Murray,
it is proposed to lay down a railroad of seven miles in length to
a point in Encounter Bay where a safe anchorage may be effected.
In the event of any unforeseen difficulties occurring in the
construction of Port Elliot, it would be necessary to make a road
from Morundee to the city of Adelaide (a distance of about sixty
miles), which road would pass through some of the richest
districts of South Australia.<br>
<br>
"With reference to the country of the Lower Murray, the estimate
of the traffic is about 2,000 tons annually, made up of ores from
the mines, green, dairy, and other produce.<br>
<br>
"On either side of the river to the Darling there are extensive
cattle-runs, all of which are taken up.<br>
<br>
"Proceeding up the river from this point, we enter upon the
province of Victoria, and the extensive sheep-runs of the
Lachlan, the Lower Darling, and the Murrumbidgee, which in June,
1860, according to the New South Wales statistical and other
authentic accounts, were stocked by 1,155,774 sheep, 306,861
horned cattle, 10,093 horses, and 1,872 pigs. There is in
Australia an annual increase of 40 per cent. on sheep, and 25 per
cent. on cattle. According to the commissioners' report, the
increase by the close of 1852, allowing for sales, &amp;c., will
have amounted to, say, 2,500,000 sheep, 500,000 cattle, the
former yielding about 3,384 tons wool, washed and unwashed; and
if a quarter of the annual increase were boiled down, say 250,000
sheep, averaging 28 lbs. tallow, 3,125 tons; and 31,000 cattle,
averaging 154 lbs. tallow, 2,130 tons. Total annual freights,
8,603 tons, independent of hides, skins, and other matters, at
present thrown aside on account of the great cost of
transport.<br>
<br>
"For return cargo it is estimated that no less than 5,000 rations
would offer, say 1,450 tons, with at least an equal quantity of
slops, iron, paling, and other goods, say 2,900 tons. The produce
from those remote districts is at present conveyed to Melbourne
and Geelong in bullock-drays, travelling about ten miles a day,
occupying many weeks in its transit to the port."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>In our opinion speculations involving so trifling an amount of
capital as a couple of small iron steam-boats should be
undertaken and managed by colonists or the provincial government,
and would be, if worth doing at all.</p>
<p>The navigation of the Murray is an enterprise, if feasible,
within the means of a party of colonists, although the clearing
of the river is a national and provincial work, to which this
country might be called upon to contribute; but the less
absentees have to do with small colonial speculations the better
for their finances and the credit of the colony.</p>
<p>In the Murray scrub&mdash;a beautiful but barren belt of
shrubs and plants from fifteen to twenty miles in breadth, which
runs parallel to the river for many miles between Lake
Alexandrina and the Great Bend in lat. 34 S.&mdash;a great number
of the rare birds and animals of Australia are to be seen;
amongst others, the leipoa, or mound-building bird, improperly
named by the colonists the wild turkey, is found in great
numbers; and the satin, or bower bird, which builds a bower for
its mate so curiously arched and adorned with shells and shining
stones, that when Mr. Gould first discovered one he took it for
the playground of some aboriginal child. The leipoa, which was
first brought before the attention of the scientific world by Mr.
Gould, realises the ancient fable of the ostrich, and buries its
eggs, to be hatched by the fermentation of a mound of decomposed
leaves and earth.</p>
<p>Mr. Gould observes in his great work, from which all our
objects of natural history have been, by permission,
copied:&mdash;</p>
<p>"This family of birds (<i>Tallegalla, Leipoa</i>, and
<i>Megapodius</i>) forms part of a great family of birds
inhabiting Australia, New Guinea, the Celebes, and the Philippine
Islands, whose habits and economy differ from those of every
other group of birds which now exists upon the surface of our
globe. In their structure they are most nearly allied to the
<i>Galllnaceæ</i>, while in some of their actions and in their
mode of flight they much resemble the Rallidæ: the small size of
their brain, coupled with the extraordinary means employed for
the incubation of their eggs, indicates an extremely low degree
of organisation. Three species inhabiting Australia, viz.,
<i>Leipoa ocellatta, Tallegalla</i>, and <i>Megapodius
tumulus</i>, although referable to distinct genera, have many
habits in common, particularly in their mode of incubation, each
and all depositing their eggs in mounds of earth and leaves,
which, becoming heated either by fermentation of the vegetable
matter, or by the sun's rays, form a kind of natural hatching
apparatus, from which the young at length emerge, fully
feathered, capable of sustaining life by their own unaided
efforts.</p>
<p>The male bird of the leipoa (according to a letter to Mr.
Gould from Sir George Grey, the present Governor of New Zealand)
weighs about four pounds and a half; they never fly if they can
help it, and roost on trees at night. The mounds are from twelve
to thirteen feet in circumference at the base, and from two to
three feet in height. To construct the mound a nearly circular
hole of about eighteen inches in diameter is scratched in the
ground to the depth of seven or eight inches, and filled with
dead leaves, dead grass, and similar materials; over this layer a
mound of sand, mixed with dry grass, &amp;c., is thrown; and,
finally, the whole assumes the form of a dome. When an egg is to
be deposited, the top is laid open, and a hole scraped in the
centre to within two or three inches of the bottom of the layer
of dead leaves; the egg is placed in the sand just at the edge of
the hole, in a vertical position, with the smaller end downwards;
the sand is then thrown in again until the mound assumes its
original form. "Egg after egg is thus deposited up to eight,
arranged on the same plane in a circle, with a few inches of sand
between each. The cock assists the hen in opening and covering up
the mound. The native name on the Murray River is marrah-ko; in
Western Australia the name of the bird is ngow-ngoweer, meaning a
tuft of feathers."</p>
<p>The <i>Megapodius</i>, of which we give an engraving, was
found by Mr. John M'Gillivray, during a survey of Endeavour
Straits, to construct a much larger mound, 24 feet in its utmost
height, and 150 feet in circumference at the base.</p>
<p>South Australia has been divided into counties, which are more
recognised as distinctive boundaries than in the other colonies,
were the first colonisation was effected by sheep.</p>
<p>These counties are eleven in number, viz.&mdash;1. Adelaide;
2. Hindmarsh; 3. Gawler; 4. Light; 5. Sturt; 6. Eyre; 7. Stanley;
8. Flinders; 9. Russell; 10. Robe; 11. Grey.</p>

<br>
<small>MEGAPODIUS, OR MOUND-BUILDING BIRD.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The county of Adelaide is that in which cultivation is most
extensively carried on, the other districts being chiefly
occupied for grazing, as the difficulty of getting crops to
market prevents sellers from raising more than for their own
consumption. But in every favourable situation vineyards are
making great progress.</p>
<p>Port Adelaide has a population of 2,000, who find occupation
in the extensive movements of a large export and import trade.
The primitive appearance of the Mangrove Creek, through which the
disconsolate first colonists waded, has disappeared.</p>
<p>A road of seven miles, through sterile, sandy ground, leads to
the city, which is traversed by conveyances of all kinds, from
the heavy dray to the omnibus and smart dog-cart. Crossing the
Torrens by a wooden bridge, one of four which is occasionally
swept away by the torrents, after performing a sinecure duty for
many months, the city of Adelaide appears in the midst of trees,
often full of most rare and curious birds, which migrate
periodically from the colder to the hotter climates, in a warm,
pretty, and dusty valley. Adelaide, although very unlike a city
according to European notions, presents a much more pleasing
appearance than Melbourne, which is crowded into a narrow valley,
without squares, park, or boulevard. In the park lands
surrounding and intersecting the straggling streets of the
former, which are as picturesque as Wiesbaden or Cheltenham,
although less finished, Colonel Gawler encouraged the blacks to
camp by frequent feasts of flour and mutton, aud there strangers
had an opportunity of seeing, sometimes to their amusement,
oftener to their surprise, their peculiar customs, habits and
sports. Many pretty cottages are to be found in the suburbs, as
neat and highly finished as in England.</p>
<p>South Adelaide is considered the commercial quarter of the
town, and contains the principal streets, one of which is 130
feet wide, and Government House, which stands in the centre of a
domain of ten acres.</p>
<p>Hindley-street is the Regent-street of Adelaide, and has the
distinction of being paved. For want of this luxury of
civilisation, coupled with the nature of the soil, Adelaide is
terribly afflicted with dust, at all times a nuisance, which is
indeed common to all Australian towns. Sydney has at certain
times of the year its brickfielders. In addition to the park
lands, which occupy a breadth of half a mile round the two
divisions of the city, a cemetery and a racecourse are among its
out-of-door ornaments.</p>
<p>In the surrounding suburbs many pretty villages have been
founded, both inland and on the shore. The system of selling land
regularly in eighty-acre lots has, in some degree, neutralised
the disadvantage of the large absentee proprietorships and the
special surveys, which have monopolised so much of the limited
extent of agricultural land.</p>
<p>There is one point in which the South Australians possess an
unquestionable superiority over the other two colonies, and that
is their local literature. With the exception of the <i>Sydney
Morning Herald</i>, which is the <i>Times</i> of the southern
hemisphere, the newspapers and periodicals are very superior in
style of getting up and in matter to those of New South Wales and
Port Phillip. This superiority is especially marked in the South
Australian almanacs, which contain a fund of useful information
on the statistics, the agriculture, the horticulture, and the
mining progress of that colony.</p>
<p>Before the check occasioned by the gold discoveries, sheep
stations had been formed as far north as Mount Brown, toward the
Darling, near the eastern boundary. The whole of York Peninsula
had been occupied, and, in the country westward of Spencer's
Gulf, flockmasters had penetrated to Anxious Bay, on the
Australian Bight; and townships had been founded at Rivoli Bay,
in the county of Grey, and Guichen Bay, in the county of Robe,
whence a coasting trade had been opened.</p>

<br>
<p>Ever since 1843 South Australia has been a corn-exporting
country, although with great fluctuations: in that year 38,480
bushels were exported; in the following year the quantity
increased to 132,000 bushels; but the low price, 2s. 9d. a
bushel, reduced the cultivation by ten thousand acres. In 1845
the price continued low, and cultivation was further reduced; but
high prices at the end of the year increased cultivation to
36,000 acres in 1847. And thus, according to price, cultivation
ebbed and flowed, constantly making more progress as small
settlers became landholders, and became more steady. As a general
rule it may be asserted that miners are situated in barren
districts, and obliged to draw their grain and vegetables from
some considerable distance. The system of eighty-acre lots
enables colonists of the cultivating class to plant themselves
upon land at the most convenient distance for supplying the
mines. These same cottage farmers also derived great advantage
from contracts for conveying ore from the mine to the port, and
coals and wood to the smelting establishments, in their
bullock-drays.</p>
<p>In 1850 the whole original scheme of the colony had
disappeared: cultivation was entirely in the hands of the working
classes; the capitalists and educated were engaged either as
squatters, in commerce, or in mining speculations. The remains of
the old ideas were only to be found in a little grandiloquent
speechmaking, and, better still, in some very beautiful gardens.
There were a few fortunate purchasers of town lots in the main
streets who made and retained very handsome fortunes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>
<h4>MINES OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</h4>
<p><span class="a">Up</span> to 1850 South Australia was
considered the mineral district, <i>par excellence</i>, of
Australia. In the old colony of New South Wales indications of
copper mines had been discovered many years previously, but the
reservation of minerals by the crown prevented purchasers and
grantees from pursuing discoveries which might only lead to the
disturbance of their freeholds by some stranger under official
patronage. The South Australian colonists had influence enough in
the home Parliament to obtain a concession of the "rights of the
crown." The discovery of the Burra Burra gave a vivid impulse to
mineral exploration, and in 1850 not less than thirty-nine South
Australian mining adventures were before the colonial and British
public, in various stages of progress, most of which depended on
English capital for their working. Nearly all, according to the
reports of the promoters, "only needed the expenditure of a
little more capital to become most flourishing investments." Not
one, with the exception of the Burra Burra, had ever paid a
public dividend; and when the gold discoveries brought them all
to a stand-still by the abstraction of labour, several "most
respectable colonists" were engaged in preferring new schemes for
the benefit of English capitalists. At that time the following
mines, in addition to nearly sixty other schemes which had never
gone beyond a prospectus, were in the market at a discount.</p>
<p>The Wheal Gawler silver lead was the first mine discovered in
the province; opened in 1841; abandoned, and re-opened by a
company without success; nevertheless the directors in 1850
boasted their good prospects. The Adelaide Mining Company, near
Montacute, "with a capital of £1,000; the Australian Mining
Company, with an English capital of £400,000, and a special
survey of Reedy Creek, forty-six miles from Adelaide, other lots
at Tungkillo and at Kapunda" founded in 1845&mdash;the outlay has
been enormous&mdash;no dividends; the Barossa Mining Company,
with a capital of £30,000, formed in England, with a view of
prosecuting mineral explorations on the property of G. T. Angas,
Esq.; the Glen Ormond, another English company, with a capital of
£30,000, founded in 1845; the Port Lincoln, with a capital of
£10,000; the Mount Remarkable, with a capital of 25,000 in 1846;
the North Kapunda, a capital of £22,200, in 1846; the Paringa,
capital £20,000, in 1845; the Port Lincoln, capital £4,000, in
1848; the Princess Royal, capital £20,000, in 1845: this was the
unlucky half of the Burra.</p>
<p>There were two gold companies established in 1846, the
workings of one of which were suspended in 1850, "pending an
anticipated sale of the sett in England."</p>
<p>Two conclusions may be drawn from an examination of the
reports of these mines&mdash;first, that South Australia is
extremely rich in minerals; and secondly, that parties who do not
understand mining should be cautious in taking the advice of
South Australian friends as to mining investments.</p>
<p>In Cornwall there are always a number of mines manufactured
for the benefit of green strangers. It was the same in South
Australia. For this reason the gold crisis, which destroyed the
fictitious credit and bubble mining adventures of South
Australia, will in the end do good, by directing the attention of
the South Australians to labor instead of puffery for the
development of the true wealth of their noble province.</p>
<h5>THE BURRA BURRA.</h5>
<p>The following statement of the results of the Burra Burra mine
will show that the South Australians have some reasonable excuse
for the gambling mining spirit with which they are afflicted, and
which succeeded to the town-lot roulette of 1839-40:&mdash;</p>
<p>The Burra proprietary divided their purchase into 2,464 shares
of £5 each, with liberty to increase their capital to £20,000,
which they have since done.</p>
<p>In the first year, from 29th September, 1845, to 29th
September, 1846, at a cost of £16,624, they raised 7,200 tons of
ore. As the depth of the workings increased a great improvement
in the quality of the ore took place; instead of the blue
carbonate, the red oxide, malachite, and the richest description
of ore became predominant. The highest price realised for the
first 800 tons was £31 9s., and the lowest £10 16s. per ton. At a
considerable distance from the principal workings eighty tons of
blue and green carbonate of copper were raised in the month of
March, 1847.</p>
<p>In the months of June and July, 1847, the first and second
dividends of fifty shillings each per share were paid to the
shareholders. These dividends were paid out of the net proceeds
of 2,959 tons of ore, amounting to £35,678, out of which also
were paid the expenses of the association, including the cost of
producing the 2,959 tons of ore, amounting to £15,926, leaving an
undivided balance of £7,584. During the six months ending 30th
September, 1847, 7,264 tons were raised within that period of a
superior quality. During the six months ending the 31st March,
1848, 6,068 tons were raised. The large raising of the whole
year, amounting to 13,533 tons, was produced from within the
limits of the twenty-fathom level. All the ore discovered below
that to the thirty fathoms was left for future raising, there
being plenty of good ore-ground above the twenty-fathom level to
employ the miners for some time to come.</p>
<p>The wages and cost of working the mine, including timber,
fixed machinery, tools, &amp;c., amounted to £74,030, and the
cartage of the ore to £44,803.</p>
<p>In this year £83,106 was realised, out of which the expenses
of working the mine and carting the ore were paid, but three
further dividends were declared. By March, 1848, the original £5
shares had advanced up to 150; a sixth and seventh dividend of
£10 each, in June and September, raised the prices to £200 and
£210 for cash. A fall afterwards took place in consequence of the
depreciation of the value of copper in Europe. But an important
discovery was made of a valuable lode in the thirty-fathom level
leading from Kingston to Graham's shaft. The lode was cut four
fathoms below the water level, was solid, and from ten to eleven
feet wide, composed of a compact green carbonate or malachite,
producing upwards of 40 per cent. of copper. The lode was
described as clearly defined, in easy working order, and dipping
well into the mine.</p>
<p>In the half year ending the 30th September, 1848, 10,163 tons
were raised, making a sum total for the ore raised during the
first three years' working of the mine of 33,386 tons, equal to
upwards of 10,000 tons of fine copper ore (at £70 per ton),
£700,000. The cost of the mine for the year ending the 30th of
September, 1848, was £81,491; of the cartage of ore, £31,445.</p>
<p>In the latter part of 1848 the miners struck for higher wages.
The workings of the mine were suspended from November until
February, 1849. In March the miners resumed work.</p>
<p>Further important discoveries were made&mdash;one of a lode in
the thirty-fathom level, south-west from Graham's shaft,
consisting of red oxide and malachite in great abundance; and the
other of a lode two fathoms wide, yielding malachite of high
produce. Only two pitches were set on these lodes, and twelve men
produced in the first week eighty tons of the richest ores.</p>
<p>On the 5th of September, 1849, an eighth dividend of £5 per
share was declared. In the year 1850 the £10 quarterly dividends
were regularly paid. Two steam-engines of thirty-five horse power
each, one for crushing the ore and the other for drawing from the
shafts, arrived; and the directors ordered seventy fathoms of
fifteen-inch pumps to replace the eleven-inch lifts then in work,
and a pumping-engine of three-hundred-horse power.</p>
<p>The quantity of ore raised in the year ending September, 1850,
was 18,692 tons. Since that period the returns have experienced a
check from the emigration to the gold-diggings, and shares have
fluctuated in value, but of the ultimate value of this property
there can be no question.</p>
<h5>SUMMARY OP WORKINGS AND PROFITS.</h5>
<p>The workings of the mines at the close of the year 1850
consisted of the following shafts, winzes and levels viz., 45
whim shafts, of an aggregate depth of 812 fathoms; seven trial
shafts, of an aggregate depth of 34 fathoms; 35 winzes and ladder
roads, of an aggregate depth of 270 fathoms; 3,876 fathoms of
levels, equal in length to four and one-third British miles. The
whole of the transactions of the company, from its formation to
the 29th September, 1849, embracing four years and a half, were,
in the year 1850, finally balanced, and the profits during that
period were found to amount to £229,535, of which £221,760 were
divided among the shareholders in twelve dividends, the twelfth
dividend of 10 having been paid on the 1st September, 1850. The
ore raised during this period was 37,736 tons, at a cost of
£309,825 3s. 6d., or 8 4s. 3d. per ton, and produced in the
province, free of freight and charges, £536,486 13s. 4d., or £14
4s. 4d. per ton, leaving a profit of £226,661 6s. 10d., or £6 0s.
1d. per ton. During the year 1850, the company, however, incurred
the following expenses:&mdash;</p>

<p>Making, with other expenses, a sum total of £169,611 2s. 5d.
After deducting these expenses from the estimated value of ore on
hand, the directors notified that 52,000 was applicable to
dividends, and a 10 dividend was accordingly paid in December,
1850, and in March, 1851.</p>
<h5>A DRIVE TO THE BURRA BURRA.</h5>
<blockquote>The Burra Burra Mine is distant about a hundred miles
from Adelaide, and reached by a road which, although low and
dusty, is good in the summer months. The transit was recently
performed by the mail, an open four-horse omnibus, at a charge of
£l, in fifteen hours' travelling, halting for the night on the
road. "A party is frequently conveyed to the Burra in a spring
cart, driven tandem fashion, and supplied with fresh horses from
the stations along the road, belonging to Mr. Chambers. A trip of
this sort, to and from the Burra mine, costs about £12 or 13. The
road from Adelaide to Gawler Town traverses a flat open country
along the coast line of St. Vincent's Gulf. On each side of the
road the country is subdivided into small farms reaching on one
side to the gulf, and on the other extending to the long range of
hills which intersects the province of South Australia. The
country in February last presented a brown parched appearance
owing to a long and unprecedented drought. Very few objects of
interest are met on the road, being limited to the teams of the
German farmers, and the bullock drays, laden with bars of refined
copper, <i>en route</i> from the smelting works to Adelaide. At
Gawler Town&mdash;a rapidly improving township&mdash;there are
two large inns with excellent accommodation. About thirty miles
from Gawler Town you reach the Kapunda, the property of Captain
Bagot, M.L.C., and some proprietors in England. The North Kapunda
and the South Kapunda mines adjoin the Kapunda. They are mineral
sections of land which were purchased in the expectation of their
containing a continuation of the rich lodes found in the Kapunda;
but although much had in 1851 been done with the scrip of the
North Kapunda and South Kapunda Companies, but little profit or
success had attended the working of the mines themselves. The
road from the Kapunda passes through an undulating park-like
country and an extensive plain, across which, in the distance,
the mirage is often plainly distinguishable. About eight miles
before arriving at the Burra the country becomes remarkably
barren and hilly, and the eye is at once attracted by the
peculiar appearance of ridges which run north and south along the
ground at what seem to be regular intervals of distance,
suggesting the natural inference of lodes of some kind or other.
This inference is fortified by the multitudinous out-croppings of
lime and other descriptions of stone which appear at the base and
along the brow of the hills. As you approach towards the Burra, a
tall white chimney, rising from the summit of one of the hills
before you, announces that the mine is not far off, and then your
eye fixes upon a congeries of bald rounded hills towards the
north, looking like so many tents crowded together upon raised
ground.<br>
<br>
"The Burra Hotel, situated at the commencement of the Burra Burra
township, is a fine spacious stone building, furnishing every
accommodation to visitors, and unsurpassed by any house of the
kind, either in the province or New South Wales. The township of
Kooringa is well laid out, comprising several very handsome stone
buildings, and contained, in 1851, a population of 5,000
inhabitants. Five years ago the whole of this place was a barren
wilderness: now stores, and shops, and offices line the
High-street. Several ministers of religion are located here.
Excellent accommodation is afforded to the wives and families of
miners, and workmen belonging to the smelting-works, in several
well laid out squares of comfortable cottages, chiefly built of
stone, and let at low rents. The whole of the township is the
freehold of the Burra Company, who have let some of the
properties such, for instance, as the Burra Hotel, on long
improving leases.<br>
<br>
"Leaving the Burra Hotel, you pass down the High-street, and
proceed along a road, which on one side winds round the base of a
large hill, and on the other side is skirted by a creek that
exhibits a very singular coup d'&oelig;il. Along the channel of
the creek runs a thin stream of water, and on each bank is a line
of little detached cottages or sheds, each of which has been
excavated out of the sides of the creek, and faced with weather
boards. The inside of each house has a fire-place and a chimney
or flue, which, making its exit out of the surface ground, is
then capped, either by a small beer barrel or mound of earth with
a hole in the centre, as a substitute for the ordinary
chimney-pot. In these strange dwelling-places, which take up two
miles of the creek on each side, the great bulk of the miners and
their families reside, being permitted by the Burra Company to do
so rent free.* A busy hum pervades the creek swarms of children
are at every door here&mdash;and there a knot of gossips is
collected and every now and then the scene is diversified by the
chatter of a tame magpie, the barking of quarrelsome curs, the
grunting of swine, the neighing of horses stabled alongside the
huts, or the fluttering of red shirts and other apparel drying in
the open air. Two minutes' walk brings you to the mine. Turning
from the creek, and looking towards the low but gently-rising
ground that lies between three hills, you observe an area of from
eighty to one hundred acres, crowded with stone buildings,
covered shafts leading under ground, machinery and engine works,
engine-houses, storehouses, tanks, and dams of water, innumerable
sheds of all sizes, and countless piles of copper ore of various
assorted qualities, in different stages of dressing, lying almost
in every direction. If you arrive after six in the evening
expecting to find all quiet and the business of the day over,
great will be your surprise at the bustling animated appearance
of the place. The first striking object is the gigantic white
chimney towering from the summit of the middle hill, and carrying
the smoke from the different engine-flues which run under the
surface of the ground towards the middle hill. At the summit of
this same hill, also, you observe a large well-finished stone
warehouse, used as a powder magazine. The eye is next caught by a
fine lofty stone building, situate about the centre of the
ground&mdash;the three-storied pumping engine-house, with the
great beam in front, steadily working up and down. Ascending the
road, you pass the weigh-bridge, and an extensive square of
stone-built offices and stores adjoining a spacious yard,
enclosed by a stone wall. These premises are used as depots for
building timber, iron, workmen's tools, and various engineering
stores. In the back ground, on the brow of the hill, is a row of
well-built stone cottages two of them the residences of Captain
Roach and another mine captain, and the third comprising the
consultation room, the changing rooms, and the office of the
company's accountant and his clerk.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* Since this description was written a flood has
destroyed these dwellings, drowning some of the inhabitants.]</p>
<blockquote>"On the right of these cottages is another similar
range, the residences of the other captains of the mine and their
families. Still further to the right is a pretty detached
cottage, occupied by Dr. Chambers, the principal surgeon at the
mine. On the brow of the right hill is a long line of stabling
and sheds for carts, with adjoining yards and barns. The stalls
are roomy, floored with small stones, and capable of receiving
upwards of one hundred horses. Near the stabling is a substantial
and capacious shed, used as a timber-store and saw-pit, and close
by a similar one was in the course of erection for the further
accommodation of the carpenters. About eleven whims were at work
at the shafts. Most of these whims, as well as the great pumping
engine, are at work day and night, which accounts for the busy
scene presented to the eye, although long past six o'clock. The
whims are situate each of them close to a shaft which
communicates with one or other of the different levels under
ground. Connected with the pumping engine shaft is a series of
long wooden spouting, elevated upon and supported by stands. The
spouts which receive the water drawn up from the mine run
backward in several directions, and feed various tanks, and dams,
and other places, where the operations of cleansing and dressing
the ore are carried on. The refuse water is conducted to the head
of the Burra Creek, down which it makes its way for seven miles,
reaching the Princess Royal Mine, and ultimately running into the
Murray flats. Near each shaft where the whim is at work are
ranges of sheds, in which parties of men and boys are busily
engaged in crushing and reducing lumps of ore from one size to
another, and so facilitating the washing and separation of the
copper ore from the earth and foreign matter with which it is
mixed.<br>
<br>
"There are other sheds set apart for tanks and various
contrivances, by which parties of men and boys wash and sift the
copper ore, until prepared for sampling. Collected near the sheds
are numberless square and oblong heaps of ore, about six feet
long, four feet broad, and two to three feet deep. These heaps
are composed of copper ore of various qualities, and in different
stages of dressing. When it is remembered, that in addition to
the large heaps of ore which cover the ground near these sheds,
and near the dams and tanks for washing, there are innumerable
piles of ore ready for the samplers and smelters, gathered
together in every available quarter of this eighty-acre area,
some faint idea may be formed of the enormous masses of mineral
wealth thus collected at the Burra. A pleasing aspect is imparted
to them by the rich deep blue of the carbonate, and by the
greenish hues which characterise the malachite ore, affording a
striking contrast to the sombre appearance of the red oxide. The
offices of the clerk of the works, and of the assayers, and of
the samplers, form another range of buildings. The workshops of
the engineers and the different mechanics engaged on the ground
are of course pretty numerous, but still each place is so
situate, and all the works are proceeding in such a manner, as to
impress even a superficial spectator with the conviction that the
most thorough order and method is the principle of the
establishment throughout. A stone engine-house has been
completed, and fitted up with an engine of forty-five horse
power, from the Perran Foundry, Cornwall, intended for crushing
the ore, and so dispensing with a large amount of expensive
manual labour. A stamping machine, for extracting the leavings
from the refuse copper ore which has hitherto been thrown on one
side, is also very near completion. Workmen were also engaged
upon a new engine-house, in which a winding-engine of thirty-five
horse power, already at the mine, is to be placed. When the
deeper levels of the mine are reached, this winding-engine will
be connected with the ropes and iron buckets now worked by the
horse-Whims, and thus save a large expenditure, which is now
necessary at the several shafts. Of the extent of the operations
going on at the surface of the mine, some notion may be obtained
from the number of men who are employed by the Burra Company at
surface work. Most of the buildings and engineering works are
erected by contract, and, reckoning exclusively of the men
working for the contractors, and also of the officers of the
mine, 383 men and 111 boys are employed by the Burra Company as
ore dressers, and labourers, and similar descriptions of surface
work; 27 men are employed as carters and stablemen, and 85 men as
carpenters, masons, smiths, painters, plasterers, engineers, and
boiler-makers&mdash;total, 600."</blockquote>

<br>
<h5>SMELTING WORKS.</h5>
<p>The copper ore raised in the South Australian mines has been
principally sent to Swansea. As there is a considerable demand
for copper in India and China, it became an object to refine the
ore in South Australia. With this view an immense capital has
been sunk in establishing several copper-smelting companies, but
hitherto with moderate success, in consequence of the scarcity of
fuel. Coal has not yet been discovered, therefore the smelters
were dependent on wood or imported coal. According to experience
in Norway, a large forest is soon consumed by the demands of a
smelting establishment. The most extensive smelting works, late
the property of Messrs. Schneider, have unfortunately been
planted close to the Burra mine, where wood is scarce, and where
four tons of coal must be carted up for every ton of ore. The
proper site would have been at or near a port.</p>
<p>The necessity of transporting coal imported from England, or
from the Newcastle of New South Wales, has called into use Port
Wakefield, a creek at the head of St. Vincent's Gulf, forming the
embouchure of the River Wakefield. The intervening country
between the Burra and Port Wakefield, a distance of about thirty
miles, is composed partly of undulating hills and partly over
flat land well adapted for heavy carriage. No doubt had the
smelting works continued in full operation, a tramway would have
been attempted over this line.</p>
<p>Mining, agriculture, and pastoral pursuits have been the
principal investments of the South Australian colonists. The
number of sheep grazing was about one-sixth of that of the Port
Phillip district. Fat cattle are driven over from Portland Bay to
Rivoli Bay for South Australian consumption.</p>
<p>South Australia is at present under a cloud, but the
depression can only be temporary. A genial sun, a fertile soil, a
healthy climate, with sheep, cattle, English colonists, and a
Burra Burra mine, cannot but produce good fruits, although the
dreams of empire of newly-fledged legislators may scarcely be
realised.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>
<h4>RELIGION, EDUCATION, LAW.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> provisions made for the promotion
of religion and education are nearly the same in New South Wales
and Victoria, having been finally settled before the two
provinces were divided. In South Australia the system of the old
colony seems to have been taken as a model. In all three colonies
the law is, with a few local exceptions, the same.</p>
<p>We have already mentioned the circumstances under which a
bishop was appointed in New South Wales. By the munificence of
Miss Burdett Coutts a bishopric was endowed in South Australia;
this led to the appointment of a bishop of Melbourne, and perhaps
to the creation of the second bishopric in New South Wales, the
diocese of Newcastle, which extends to the northward, the
residence being at Morpeth.</p>
<p>The assistance afforded to the building of churches and the
support of religious ministers in New South Wales and Port
Phillip is at present regulated by the act passed by Sir Richard
Bourke, described at page 109.</p>
<p>By an act of the Legislative Council of South Australia,
passed 3rd of August, 1847, for promoting the building of
Christian churches and chapels, public money was issued, under
the sanction of the governor and Executive Council, in proportion
to the amount of private contributions; the grants in aid of
building to range from £50 to £150, and toward the stipends of
clergy and ministers from £50 to £200 a year. One-fourth of the
sittings in places of worship so assisted must be free.</p>
<p>The Congregationalists and Baptists have always refused to
receive aid from the state; and there exists in the three
colonies, especially in South Australia, a party opposed to all
state assistance to religion. In our opinion, although religion
and education may be sustained in towns with a large floating
population by the voluntary system, the inhabitants of the
interior, without government assistance, will remain to a great
extent in a state of practical heathendom altogether, without the
advantage of religious rites and ordinances. The state of life in
the bush is, or ought to be, patriarchal: churches are an
impossibility: every father must be the pastor of his family. To
establish the voluntary system is to decree that the long lines
of rivers shall never be visited by a minister of religion.</p>
<p>It is a pity that a few thousands cannot be tithed from the
vast sums spent on hopeless missions to the heathen for the
support of itinerant missionaries to our emigrant countrymen:
missionaries who would not disdain to be also schoolmasters. The
collection of bibles in many languages in the Great Exhibition
was a fine, an impressive sight; but still it is to be regretted
that men of piety, rank, wealth, and influence, do not pursue
rather the positive kind possible than the impossible, and begin
by taking care that every child in the bush of Australia shall
have and know how to read a bible before sending missionaries to
perish in Patagonia, or attempting an impossible Church of
England Utopia in Canterbury, New Zealand.</p>
<p>The following are the numbers of the various religious
denominations in New South Wales:&mdash;Church of England,
93,137; Church of Scotland, 18,156; Wesleyan Methodists, 10,000;
other Protestants, 6,472; Roman Catholics, 56,899; Jews, 979;
Mahomedans and Pagans, 852; other persuasions, 740. The churches
which receive State support are the English, the Scotch, the
Wesleyan, and the Romish. The respective amounts paid for the
year 1850 were as follows:&mdash;The diocese of Sydney, £12,015
17s. 4d.; the diocese of Newcastle, £4,028 7s. 10d.; the
Presbyterian Church, £3,378 1s. 1d.; the Wesleyan Church, £850;
and the Roman Catholic Church, £8,159 0s. 9d.; in all about
£30,000. In South Australia the places of worship of the Church
of England are seventeen; of the Roman Catholics, six; Church of
Scotland, seven; Methodists, twelve (having 1,300 Sunday-school
scholars); Congregationalists, nine; Baptists, three or four. The
Germans have six pastors, and five places where they meet for
worship.</p>
<p>Up to 1836 education was as much neglected in Australia as in
England, until Lord Brougham commenced the agitation compromised
by the establishment of the miscalled <i>national</i> schools. A
large proportion of the colonial population consisted of adult
convicts, who arrived as ignorant as vicious.</p>
<p>We have already described in Chapter X. how Sir Richard Bourke
carried through the Legislative Council, at the time that the
church and school lands were surrendered, a measure for
founding-schools throughout the colony, on the plan of Lord
Stanley's (now Earl of Derby) Irish national school system. But
the opposition on the part of the late Bishop of Australia was so
hot and effective that the local act remained a dead letter, and
the moderate per centage of education afforded to the working
classes was distributed through denominational or sectarian
schools, aided by colonial funds. The result was, that many
country districts were left without schools, whilst two or three
were established to educate forty or fifty scholars. At Camden
there were three schools, none of which had more than twenty
scholars.</p>
<p>In 1844 a committee of the Legislative Council, appointed to
investigate the subject of colonial education, of which Robert
Lowe, Esq., was chairman, reported strongly in favour of the
Irish national system, observing:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>"There are about 25,676 children between the ages of
four and fourteen years: of these only 7,642 receive instruction
in public schools, and 4,865 in private ones, leaving about
13,000 who, as far as the committee can learn, receive no
education at all. The expense of education is about £1 a head.
This deficient education is partly attributable to the ignorance,
dissolute habits, and avarice of too many parents, and partly to
the want of good schoolmasters and schoolbooks, but a far greater
proportion of the evil has arisen from the strictly
denominational character of the public schools.<br>
<br>
"The very essence of a denominational system is to leave the
majority uneducated, in order thoroughly to imbue the minority
with peculiar tenets. The natural result is, that where one
school is founded two will arise, not because they are wanted,
but because it is feared that proselytes will be made. It is a
system impossible to be carried out in a thinly-inhabited
country, and, being exclusively in the hands of the clergy, it
places the state in the awkward dilemma of either supplying
money, whose expenditure it is not permitted to regulate, or of
interfering between the clergy and their superiors."</blockquote>
<br>
<p>The committee further recommended the formation of a board, to
be appointed by the governor, consisting of persons favourable to
the plan, and possessing the confidence of the different
denominations, "with a salaried secretary."</p>
<p>The Lord Bishop of Australia and the Roman Catholic Archbishop
were both examined before this committee; both were strongly
opposed to the Irish system of educating different denominations
in one school, and expressed their adherence to the
denominational system. The Bishop of Australia would countenance
no schools in which the dogmas of the Church of England were not
taught; the Roman Catholic Archbishop, in like manner, insisted
on having exclusive Roman Catholic schools for the members of his
church.* They were both excellent, charitable, and pious men; but
either was evidently prepared, if he had the power, to enforce
the dogmatic teaching of his own church in all the schools, and
to leave those who did not agree with it without any teaching,
moral or educational. They were not satisfied with a compromise
system, by which the duties of truth, chastity, honesty, charity,
forgiveness of enemies, and thankfulness to God, should be
inculcated, with reading, writing, and arithmetic, unless the
questions of the number of sacraments and the right line of
apostolic succession were also expounded according to the views
of each; and sooner than either would give way, they were content
to leave infant minds to gather all their learning from the
blasphemy of the streets.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The two following instances will show how far
sectarian zeal will carry excellent and educated men. There is
not in all Australia a more pious and actively charitable man
than the Rev. Robert Allwood. A remarkable instance of his
benevolence is mentioned in Mrs. Chisholm's report of the
"Emigrants' Home" in 1844. Mr. Allwood says, "I could not
sanction any system in which the Church of England catechism was
not taught." Q. "In thinly-peopled districts, where it is
impossible to find schoolmasters for each denomination, and where
some concession is necessary to each, in order to get education
for all, do you not think the Scriptures might be read by all
Protestants, the Roman Catholic children being exempted, this
education being supplemented by Sunday-schools?"&mdash;"I would
not approve of it." On the other hand, the Roman Catholic
Archbishop Polding considered "religious and moral instruction in
a very low state in England," which may, perhaps, be true; but in
another part of his evidence, which is too long to quote, he
leaves it to be inferred that the state of education at Rome, as
regards the humblest classes, is in a most satisfactory state,
that a large proportion of the public revenues is given to
education," and that "the Papal government is extremely anxious
that all should have the means of education." Archbishop Polding
must have examined the English in courts and alleys, and looked
at the Romans through the windows of a cardinal's carnage.]</p>
<p>The vigorous opposition of these two prelates, and others of
their mind, aided by many who, really worshipping nothing, except
what the Americans rather profanely call the "Almighty Dollar,"
yet loved a party cry, temporarily suspended the carrying out of
the recommendations of this report.</p>
<p>But the Stanley National system of instruction is the only
system possible in a colony where the divers religions were so
evenly balanced, and made and is making progress. In the
principal towns where denominational schools were in existence in
1844 they are still maintained, but in new districts Lord
Stanley's system is introduced.</p>
<p>In pursuance of the recommendations of Mr. Lowe's committee, a
board has been formed on the principle of the Irish Board of
Education; and a normal school for training teachers on the Irish
system has been established.</p>
<p>Throughout the "Three Colonies" great anxiety prevails among
all classes for the extension of education, and a willingness to
bear taxation for that purpose.</p>
<p>The normal school of Sydney affords one of the many comical
anecdotes afloat illustrating the mode in which officials in
England attend to colonial affairs.</p>
<p>In consequence of the suggestion of Mr. Lowe's committee,
after the heat of the educational question had toned down,
application was made to the Colonial Office for a master
acquainted with the Irish school system, and capable of taking
charge of a normal school for the instruction of masters in that
system. For nearly four years the Colonial Office slept on the
application: at the end of that time, by some chance, the "order
for a schoolmaster" turned up. Earl Grey, it is presumed after
some inquiries, selected a Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson received a
letter desiring him to call on Earl Grey, in Downing-street. He
went, was congratulated, favoured with a little of the good
advice of which great men keep a stock for the benefit of the
small, and then handed over to Mr. Benjamin Hawes, the late
Under-Secretary for the Colonies, who in due course handed him
over to Mr. Gairdner, the chief clerk, who transferred him to a
stylish young gentleman, name unknown, who stood with his back to
the fire, a pot of stout in his right hand, and delivered himself
something in the following strain:&mdash;"Well, you're appointed
to this berth in Australia? Consider yourself lucky; you'll make
your fortune. Now, these colonial fellows are in a deuce of a
hurry, so you must lose no time. Let me see the shipping list.
Ah! here's a ship sails on Friday for Adelaide. This is
Monday&mdash;you must go on Friday&mdash;your passage will be
paid, and all right."</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson remonstrated on the shortness of the time, but it
was of no use: the colonists were in a "deuce of a hurry." He
suggested that Adelaide was a considerable distance from Sydney.
The objection was pooh-poohed&mdash;knowledge of colonial
geography is not an indispensable qualification for colonial
office. Poor Mr. Wilson was hurried off by the ship to Adelaide.
Arrived there, he had to wait nearly a month for a conveyance to
Sydney. Arrived in Sydney, and installed in his office, he was
questioned as to the latest improvements in the Irish national
system. He knew nothing about it, had never heard of it, had
never seen any of the books; he had been master of an excellent
Church of England school. So, after four years' delay, in
desperate haste, the Colonial Office had sent off the wrong man,
to the wrong place!</p>
<p>In justice to Mr. Wilson it is right to add, that, being a
clever and conscientious man, he applied himself to the study of
the Irish schoolbooks, and has performed the duties of his office
with credit to himself and advantage to the colony.</p>
<p>In South Australia, by an act of the Legislative Council,
passed in August, 1847, the governor is authorised to appoint a
board of education, who shall have power, under his sanction, to
make regulations for giving effect to the ordinance. No aid to be
given to schoolhouses. The salaries issued to teachers will be in
proportion to the children taught, not less than twenty, between
six and sixteen years of age, 20 being the lowest and 40 the
highest sum. The governor to appoint visitors and inspectors. The
reports to be laid before the Legislative Council, and one public
examination to take place yearly. The boards, previous to the
introduction of an elective Legislative Council, consisted of the
judge of the Supreme Court, the advocate-general, the colonial
chaplain, a dissenting minister, and a layman.</p>
<p>The University of Sydney, established by an Act of the
Legislative Council, was opened in October, 1852, on the
following scale and plan:&mdash;A fee of two pounds must be paid
on matriculation, and two guineas for each course of lectures.
All students matriculated the first year, were required to attend
the lectures on classics and mathematics, and to be attired in
academical costume. Six scholarships, of £50 a year each, tenable
for three years, have been established.</p>
<p>The candidates for matriculation in October, 1852, were
examined in Mathematics: in the ordinary rules of Arithmetic,
vulgar and decimal Fractions; the first four rules of Algebra,
and the first book of Euclid. In Classics: in the sixth book of
Homer's Iliad; the first book of Xenophon's Anabasis; the first
book of Virgil's Æneid; the Bellum Catilinarum of Sallust; and in
the History and Geography connected with those portions of those
works. In the same session the Principal lectured to the Upper
Division on Thucydides, Bk. 1; Sophocles, Antigone: Sallust,
Bell. Jug.; Horace, Epistles. To the Lower Division, on Xen.
Anabasis, Bk. 1; Hom. Iliad, Bk. 1; Cicero de Senectute; Virg.
Æneid, Bk. 6. The Professor of Mathematics lectured on Euclid,
first four Books; Arithmetic, and Algebra. Lectures were also
delivered daily on Chemistry, Natural and Experimental
Philosophy, by a third professor.</p>
<p>The following are the subjects on which the candidates for
scholarship were examined:&mdash;Mathematics: Arithmetic and
Algebra, as far as Quadratic Equations inclusive; first four
books of Euclid; the popular Elements of Statics and Dynamics.
Classics&mdash;<i>Greek</i>: The Medea of Euripides; Xenophon's
Anabasis. <i>Latin</i>: First six books of Virgil's Æneid; Cicero
de Amicitia; Roman Antiquities; Translations from English into
Latin; Questions in Ancient History connected with the foregoing
works.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted that no provision has hitherto been
made for founding professorial chairs of English Literature,
Modern History, and Moral Philosophy. Some such counteracting
influences are needed in a country where at present public
libraries are unknown, literary influences do not exist, and
wealth and official rank are the only recognised
distinctions.</p>
<p>The <i>Supreme Court</i> of New South Wales consists of a
chief and two puisne judges, who exercise the powers of the three
Courts of Queen's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer at
Westminster, and have criminal jurisdiction. They go on circuit
twice a year to Bathurst, Goulburn, Maitland, and Brisbane.</p>
<p>In common law the "new rules" of pleading are in force.</p>
<p>One judge sits in equity (by delegation) with the powers of a
vice-chancellor, and there is an appeal from his decision to the
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The proceedings are by bill and answer. The equity rules of
1841 are in force; but in 1849 a reform was introduced, by which
the proceedings for obtaining a rule nisi in a common law court,
by affidavit, and a defence by affidavit, were, in a variety of
instances, substituted for the tedious complication of the old
chancery system.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court also exercises, in the person of one of the
judges appointed for the purpose, those functions as regards the
validity of testamentary dispositions, letters of administration,
&amp;c., which in England are performed by the Ecclesiastical
Courts; but no court exists for deciding on questions of divorce,
alimony, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Master in Equity presides over an Admiralty Court.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court exercises jurisdiction in bankruptcy and
insolvency. One of the judges presides, exercising powers similar
to the commissioners in England, with an appeal to the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>Estates of insolvents are vested in official assignees.</p>
<p>A person can be made a bankrupt or insolvent either by
petition of creditors or by his own petition.</p>
<p>A <i>Court of Conscience</i>, presided over by a single
commissioner, who decides, not according to law or evidence, but
according "to equity and good conscience," like the courts which
have been superseded in England by our County Courts, is held for
the metropolitan county of Cumberland in Sydney, and one for the
metropolitan county of Bourke in Melbourne, which has
jurisdiction up to 30.</p>
<p>The magistrates, paid and unpaid, in the other districts have
jurisdiction up to £10 absolutely, and up to 30 by mutual consent
in cases of simple debt, but not in actions for damages or
disputed rights to land, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Under the enactments of the "Masters and Servants Act," two
magistrates can decide on disputes as to wages and service: they
can commit a servant refusing to perform his written agreement,
and levy a distress on the property of a master or his agent if
wages are unpaid; and, by a recent law, this power extends to
contracts made in England.</p>
<p>The division of barrister and attorney is maintained in the
colonies.</p>
<p>English barristers and Scotch advocates are admitted at once
to practise.</p>
<p>The judges appoint a board of examiners, and admit any man of
good character to practise as a barrister, after passing an
examination in classics, mathematics, and law.</p>
<p>Attorneys and writers to the signet are admitted to practise
of course.</p>
<p>Persons who have served their articles and not passed in
England may be admitted in the colony. The result is, that
parties who have been or would have been rejected in England, in
consequence of tainted character, are able to practise in New
South Wales.</p>
<p>Three important law reforms are due to the exertions of Robert
Lowe, Esq., now member for Kidderminster, during the time he was
a member of the Legislative Council, and practised at the bar in
Sydney:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The substitution in 1849, in the Colonial Equity Court, of
the common law proceedings on application for a rule nisi instead
of the tedious delays of bill and answer.</p>
<p>2. The abolition of imprisonment for debt on final process. In
Australia to commit a man to prison virtually amounted to
destroying all his property.</p>
<p>3. Arrangements for admitting gentlemen to the bar without
proceeding to England, provided they are able to pass an
examination in classics, mathematics, and law, before examiners
appointed by the judges. The sons of Australian gentlemen, for
want of friends accustomed to the state of society in the
universities, are usually ruined.</p>
<p>In South Australia there is a Supreme Court, composed of one
judge, who also presides in the Vice-Admiralty Court, a
commissioner in the Insolvent Court, and three police
magistrates.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h3>
<h4>STATISTICS OF NEW SOUTH WALES.</h4>
<p><span class="a">We</span> are in possession of very exact
statistics of New South Wales; but in Victoria, in consequence of
the confusion into which every public department has been thrown
by the revolution in ordinary colonial pursuits, and the enormous
influx of population, it has been impossible to prepare the same
accurate collection of statistical facts. The same causes have
depressed South Australia.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to observe, that all the natural productions
enumerated in the statistical account of New South Wales, may be
grown or manufactured in the other two colonies, the soil and
climate being essentially the same.</p>
<h5>POPULATION.</h5>
<p>By the census taken on the 1st March, 1851, the population
consisted of 108,691 males and 81,260 females, making a total of
189,951. The increase to the 31st December, 1851, had been 9,043
males and 5,243 females. The increase in the males, arose from
immigration, 5,799; from births, 3,244. In the females, from
immigration, 2,091; from births, 3,152. The decrease to the 31st
December was 4,702 males and 2,367 females. The decrease in the
males arose from deaths, 1,344; departure from the colony, 3,358;
and in the females from deaths, 823; and from departures, 1,544.
The total increase was 14,286; the total decrease, 7,069, leaving
the nett increase, during the three quarters of the year,
7,217&mdash;viz., by births, 4,229; by immigration,
2,968&mdash;the increase by births being a fraction more than 2
per cent., and by immigration about 1¼ per cent. The number of
marriages in the year 1851 was 1,915, and they were solemnised as
follows:&mdash;Church of England, 765; Church of Scotland, 426;
Wesleyan, 100; Independents, 8; Baptists, 4; Church of Rome, 605;
Jews' Synagogue, 7. Since the year 1837 the returns show, almost
without exception, an increase in the births and a decrease in
the deaths over and above the proportionate increase of
population.</p>
<h5>IMMIGRATION.</h5>
<p>The total number of immigrants introduced at the public
expense was, in 1832, 792; in 1833, 1,253; in 1834, 484; in 1835,
545; in 1836, 808; in 1837, 2,664; in 1838, 6,102; in 1839,
7,852; in 1840, 5,216; in 1841, 12,188; in 1842, 5,071; in 1843,
nil; in 1844, 2,726; in 1845, 497; in 1846, nil; in 1847, nil; in
1848, 4,376; in 1849, 8,309; in 1850, 4,078; in 1851, 1,846
making a total number of immigrants, introduced during the twenty
years at the public expense, of 64,807; consisting of 21,653 male
and 25,595 female adults, and 17,559 children under fourteen
years of age. The total cost to the colony for this immigration
was £1,134,511 15s. 6d. In 1832 the cost per head was £6 13s.
8d.; in 1833, £10 16s. 10d.; in 1834, £10 9s. 7d.; in 1835, £18
0s. 9d.; in 1836, £16 4s. 6d.; in 1837, £17 13s. 10d.; in 1838,
£16 18s. 11d.; in 1839, £18 17s. 6d.; in 1840, £22 12s. 5d.; in
1841, £17 0s. 2d.; in 1842, £16 9s.; in 1844, £16 9s. 9d.; in
1845, £19 4s. 2d. The averages for the remaining years are not
given, but they have been about £15 per head. The whole of this
expenditure has been borne out of the territorial revenue of the
colony, although it has at times been found necessary to
anticipate that revenue by borrowing upon its security. The
debentures issued by the Government for this purpose amount in
all to £336,800; and the nett proceeds realised by the sale of
these debentures is £338,286 15s. 1d. The amount of debentures
which has been paid off was £149,700; and the amount outstanding
on the 31st of December, 1851, £187,100. The interest paid on
debentures has been £33,786 14s. 1d.</p>
<h5>EDUCATION.</h5>
<p>In the year 1840 there were in the colony 159 schools, with
4,639 male and 3,935 female scholars&mdash;total, 8,574. In 1841,
192 schools, with 4,935 male and 4,124 female
scholars&mdash;total, 9,059. In 1842, 232 schools, with 5,698
male and 4,635 female scholars&mdash;total, 10,333. In 1843, 279
schools, with 6,286 male and 5,103 female scholars&mdash;total,
11,389. In 1844, 313 schools, with 6,814 male and 5,776 female
scholars&mdash;total, 12,590. In 1845, 327 schools, with 7,813
male, and 6,641 female scholars&mdash;total, 14,454. In 1846, 338
schools, with 8,613 male and 7,650 female scholars&mdash;total,
16,263. In 1847, 376 schools, with 9,848 male and 8,752 female
scholars&mdash;total, 18,600. In 1848, 382 schools, with 10,267
male and 8,722 female scholars&mdash;total, 18,989. In 1849, 444
schools, with 10,721 male and 9,250 female scholars&mdash;total,
19,971. In 1850, 493 schools, with 11,214 male and 10,170 female
scholars&mdash;total, 21,384. In 1851, 423 schools, with 11,118
male and 10,002 female scholars&mdash;total, 21,120. The schools
in the year 1851 consisted of the Protestant and Roman Catholic
orphan schools, with 345 scholars, maintained by Government at an
expense of £5,212 3s. 11d.; the Church of England denominational
schools, with 4,998 scholars, receiving 5,321 5s. 3d. from
Government, and paying £2,324 2s. 7d. by voluntary contributions;
the Wesleyan schools, with 891 scholars, receiving £588 9s. 2d.
from the Government, and £665 11s. 2d. from voluntary
contributions; the Roman Catholic schools, with 3,310 scholars,
receiving £2,576 15s. 4d. from the Government, and £985 17s. 1d.
from voluntary contributions; the National schools, containing
2,861 scholars, receiving from Government £6,766 10s. 3d., and
£1,179 17s. 3½d. from voluntary contributions; private schools,
consisting of 227 in number, containing 6,721 scholars.</p>
<h5>LUNACY.</h5>
<p>The next chapter in the colonial statistics is a very painful
one one, we fear, that is scarcely equalled in its mournful
details by the experience of any other British colony. It is a
return of the lunatics in the colony. The first establishment
mentioned is that at Tarban Creek. During the year 1851, 50 male
and 35 female lunatics were received into the asylum; 18 males
and 14 females were cured, 9 males and 18 females improved, 14
males and 4 females died. On the 31st of December, 1851, there
remained in the asylum, 42 males and 24 females, supposed to be
curable; 25 males and 27 females supposed to be incurable. Total
in the asylum, 118. In the establishment at Paramatta for free
lunatics there were admitted in the year, 8 males and 17 females;
there were cured, 3 males and 3 females. On the 31st of December,
1851, there remained in the establishment, 5 males and 6 females
supposed to be curable, and 51 males and 50 females supposed to
be incurable. Total in the establishment, 112. In the Convict,
Lunatic, and Invalid Establishment at Paramatta (the invalids
being for the most part helpless and imbecile), there were
lunatics&mdash;males 5, females 2, supposed to be curable; males
95? females 20, supposed to be incurable. Total, 122. The total
number of lunatics in the asylums of the colony is 352, or about
one in every 550 persons.</p>
<h5>CRIMINALS.</h5>
<p>The return of the convictions in the colonial courts of the
colony is one of a much more agreeable nature. In the year 1839,
the convictions for felony were 741; in 1840, 652; in 1841, 563,
in 1842, 542; in 1843, 523; in 1844, 488; in 1845, 442; in 1846,
463; in 347, 396; in 1848, 360; in 1849, 437; in 1850, 451; in
1851, 641. The convictions for misdemeanour in 1839, were 125; in
1840, 149; in 1841, 78; in 1842, 94; in 1843, 76; in 1844, 78; in
1845, 78; in 1846, 115; in 1847, 85; in 1848, 85; in 1849, 97; in
1850, 104; in 1851, 113.</p>
<p>Thus the total convictions in 1839, were 866, while in 1851,
with a population nearly double, they were reduced to 574. The
capital executions were in the same manner reduced from 22 in
1839 to 2 in 1851.</p>
<h5>SQUATTING STATISTICS.</h5>
<p>The order in council, dated 9th March, 1847, came into
operation on the 7th of October that year; under which the lands
of the colony were divided into three classes&mdash;the settled,
the intermediate, and the unsettled districts. The settled
districts in the colony of New South Wales comprise the whole of
the nineteen counties, the counties of Stanley and Macquarie, the
towns in the country districts with the lands immediately
adjacent, all the land within three miles of the sea, and the
lands at the head and along the banks of some principal
rivers.</p>
<p>The intermediate districts in New South Wales comprehend the
county of Auckland, Gipps' Land, and some other partially settled
districts.</p>
<p>The unsettled districts comprise all the remaining lands of
the colony.</p>
<p>In the unsettled districts occupation leases are given for
fourteen years with the right to cultivate for the consumption of
the establishment of the lessee, and no further: the amount of
rent being ten pounds per annum for the estimated capability of
the run to carry 4,000 sheep or an equivalent number of cattle;
the capability of the run to be determined by two valuers, one
appointed by the commissioner of the district, and one by the
occupier. During the lease the land can be sold to only the
occupant. The lease may be renewed for the whole run if no
portion is sold, or for any portion of the run, provided that
one-fourth of the whole remains unsold.</p>
<p>In the leases there are reservations for public purposes, and
conditions for the payment of rent, &amp;c., punishable by the
forfeiture of the run in case of non-observance.</p>
<p>In the intermediate districts, the leases are confined to
eight years, it being, however, a condition that at the end of
every successive year from the date of the lease, the governor
may, by giving sixty days' previous notice, offer for sale the
whole or any part of the lands on the said run.</p>
<p>In the settled districts the leases are given from year to
year only.</p>
<p>This, then, is the position, politically speaking, in which
the pastoral districts now stand; under the constitutional act of
1850 the population outside the boundaries were allowed the
elective franchise. At present, however, the squatting districts
have been erected, under certain combinations, into electoral
districts, and exercise very considerable influence in the
legislature of the country.</p>
<p>In the year 1810, twenty-two years after the establishment of
the country, the sheep of the colony were 25,888 head, and the
cattle 12,442. In the year 1821, the number of sheep had
increased to 119,777; in 1828, it was 503,691; in 1834, it
reached one million; in 1843, the number of sheep was 3,452,539;
in 1844, 3,743,732; in 1845, 4,409,504; in 1846, 4,909,819; in
1847, 5,673,266; in 1848, 6,530,542; in 1849, 6,784,494; in 1850,
7,092,200; in 1851, 7,396,895. In 1837, the export of wool was
4,273,715 lbs.; in 1840, it was 7,668,960 lbs.; in 1845, it was
10,522,921 lbs.; in 1850, it was 14,270,632 lbs.; in 1851, it was
15,268,473 lbs.</p>
<p>By the authorised returns for the year 1851, the number of
sheep within the settled districts was 2,263,386, beyond the
settled districts it was 5,133,509. The proportion of cattle and
other live stock between the two classes is very nearly the
same.</p>
<p>The returns of the number of horses, horned cattle, and pigs
are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the year 1851, the number of horses within the settled
districts was 81,083; horned cattle, 451,263; pigs, 59,439.
Beyond this settled districts there were horses, 35,214; horned
cattle, 923,994; pigs, 6,081.</p>
<p>In the year 1843, the export of tallow was 4,660 cwt.; in
1844, 48,029 cwt.; in 1845, 64,440 cwt.; in 1846, 18,117 cwt.; in
1847, 58,478 cwt.; in 1848, 71,304 cwt.; in 1849, 84,454 cwt.; in
1850, 128,090 cwt.; in 1851, 86,460 cwt.; in the year 1850, the
estimated value of the export of tallow was £167,858. In the year
1850, 190,791 yards of woollen cloth were manufactured in the
colony.</p>
<p>During the year 1851, the exports derived from pastoral
pursuits in this colony exceeded 1,000,000. The live stock of the
colony in proportion to the whole adult and infant population of
the colony (197,168) is as follows: To every individual 37 sheep,
six and a half horned cattle, two-thirds of a horse, and one
third of a pig.</p>
<p>It is probable that the community of New South Wales is, in
proportion to the number of its population, the largest
meat-consuming one in the world; certainly it is the largest
consuming community of beef and mutton, as there is little fish,
and scarcely any game.</p>
<p>The pastoral pursuits of the colony afford an export very
nearly amounting to £6 per head for every man, woman, or child in
the colony.</p>

<p><i>The Grape</i>.&mdash;In 1848, 508 acres of vineyard
produced 33,915 gallons wine; brandy, 751. In 1850, 1,069¾ acres,
111,085 gallons wine; 1,985 gallons brandy. In 1851, 1,060 acres,
84,843 gallons wine; 1,641 gallons brandy.</p>
<p>The wine imported in 1851 amounted to 273,856, the export of
colonial wine, 3,000 gallons.</p>
<h5>MANUFACTURES.</h5>
<p>The manufactures of the colony are at present very limited;
and they have in fact in some branches considerably diminished of
late years. Three years after the foundation of the colony,
brickmaking commenced; and the first brick building built of
colonial bricks was erected in 1791. In 1805 the first sailing
vessel was built; in 1815, the first steam-engine was worked in
the colony. In 1820, colonial tobacco was first manufactured, and
colonial spirits first distilled; and in 1831 the first colonial
steam-boat was launched.</p>
<p><i>Distillers</i>.&mdash;There were two distilleries
established in the year 1837, and these have remained in full
work, except at short intervals, up to the present time. Under
the old system of very high duties on foreign spirits, these
distilleries made large profits; but even these were insufficient
to satisfy the proprietors, and illicit distillation took place
to a considerable extent in 1846; however, more stringent
regulations for the inspection of distilleries were enacted, and
the duty on foreign rum was reduced from 7s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. The
profits of the distillers then began to fall off, and the largest
of them was compelled to shut up, but it has recently been again
set to work by a sugar-refining company, and the two distilleries
are now turning out from 7,000 to 10,000 gallons weekly. Nearly
the whole of the spirits distilled in this colony are
manufactured from sugar and molasses. In addition to these
distilleries there is one extensive rectifying and compounding
establishment; and in former years there were three or four. In
the year 1837 there were seven breweries&mdash;three in Sydney,
two in Parramatta, one in Windsor, and one in Maitland. In 1844
there were twelve; in 1845 there were fifteen; in 1846, sixteen;
in 1847, fifteen; in 1848, twelve; in 1849 twenty-one; in 1850,
nineteen; and in 1851, seventeen.</p>
<p><i>Beer</i>.&mdash;The beer brewed at these breweries is drank
to a very considerable extent in the colony by the humbler
classes, but a very large portion of it is an unwholesome
beverage, being adulterated with many deleterious articles.
Medical men have attributed death in many instances to the
excessive use of this drink. The two largest breweries in the
colony are in Sydney; and as they are carried on by men of
respectability and large capital, the profits are large. The
quantity of beer consumed in the colony is very great, as in
addition to the home-made, the importation of the article in 1851
amounted to 57,000. The colonial beer is very inferior to the
British, and is sold at less than half the price. It is probable,
however, that a better article will soon be produced to supply
the deficiency of English beer which frequently exists. One of
the Sydney brewers has lately succeeded in producing a beer which
successfully competed with the English beverage for some
months.</p>
<p>Sugar.&mdash;There are two sugar-refining companies in the
colony, one of which has been established ten years, the other
four. The Australasian Sugar Refining Company carries on a very
large trade, supplying not only nearly the whole of the home
consumption, but also the wants of the neighbouring colonies. The
raw sugar is procured for the most part from Manilla, and the
trade to that settlement is much encouraged by these
establishments. The prices charged by the company for its sugar
in ordinary times are about 45s. per cwt. for loaf, and 34s. per
cwt. for crystallised. The quantity of refined sugar manufactured
in 1847 was 39,600 cwt.; in 1848, 26,000 cwt.; in 1849, 35,000
cwt.; in 1850, 51,000 cwt.; and in 1851, 74,000 cwt.</p>
<p><i>Soap and Candles</i>.&mdash;There are twelve soap and
candle manufacturers in the colony, and they produce a
considerable quantity of both articles both for home consumption
and for exportation. With the exception of sperm candles, indeed,
the whole colony is supplied by the home manufactories. The
colonial soap has of late years nearly superseded the English
article, which used to be imported in large quantities. The soap
made in the colony is preferred for use, while it is produced at
a cost of about 3d. per pound. The quantity of soap manufactured
in 1847 was 19,925 cwt.; in 1848, 18,900 cwt.; in 1849, 24,623
cwt.; in 1850, 25,986 cwt.; in 1851, 33,065 cwt.</p>
<p><i>Tobacco</i>.&mdash;There are at present only six
manufactories of tobacco in the colony, but in 1849 there were
fifteen; and in 1850, fourteen. These, however, were on a small
scale, and the quantity manufactured was but small. Many samples
of tobacco grown and manufactured in the colony have been
pronounced by competent judges equal to Virginian; but a very
considerable prejudice exists against it. The reduction of the
duties on foreign tobacco in the last session of the Council will
probably retard the progress of the production and manufacture of
this article; but with an abundance of labour there is no
question that this branch of industry will be again profitably
resorted to. The quantity of tobacco manufactured in 1847 was
1,321 cwt.; in 1848, 714 cwt.; in 1849, 2,758 cwt.; in 1850,
3,833 cwt.; in 1851, 4,841 cwt.</p>
<p><i>Cloth</i>.&mdash;There are five woollen cloth manufactories
in the colony, the largest of which is the Messrs. Byrnes', at
Paramatta. This establishment is very extensive, and is conducted
by its enterprising proprietors on the true British principle.
There was also a large manufactory at Maitland, but the works
have been interfered with by a serious fire, which took place
there some time back, and this accounts for the falling off in
the production last year. The cloth principally manufactured in
the colony is tweeds, and the quality has been much improved in
the last few years. The quantity of cloth and tweeds manufactured
in the colony in 1847 was 175,088 yards; in 1848, 164,749 yards;
in 1849, 180,197 yards; in 1850, 190,791 yards; in 1851, 114,394
yards.</p>
<p>In addition to the larger factories thus enumerated, there are
two hat manufactories, fifty-five tanneries, nine salting and
meat-preserving establishments, four potteries, two copper
smelting establishments, and fifteen iron and brass foundries.
The export of unmanufactured leather is very considerable,
amounting in 1851 to 562,215 lbs., valued at £11,665. The
consumption of colonial leather in the colony is also very large,
both for shoes and boots, and for coach-building and harness. The
other establishments we have enumerated are chiefly employed in
supplying the colonial consumption. The lighter handicrafts in a
small way are pursued with great avidity and considerable skill
in the towns of the colony, especially in Sydney. There are
plenty of expert jewellers; and the articles of colonial
workmanship, manufactured from colonial gold and colonial gems,
would, in many instances, do credit to London establishments.
Furniture, and some of the larger articles of cabinet ware, are
also manufactured with much taste in the colony. Many of the
woods of the colony are peculiarly appropriate to this trade,
which, we have no doubt, will one day assume a very considerable
importance. There are also one or two small cutlery
establishments; but though very good knives and scissors, and
even surgical instruments, have been made in the colony, they are
principally employed in repairing such instruments.</p>
<h5>SHIP BUILDING.</h5>
<p>Ship building has been engaged in to a very considerable
extent, and the colonial vessels for the most part, as models of
soundness and durability, are highly creditable to the colony.
There is an abundance of excellent timber suited for every
department of ship building.</p>
<p>In 1840, the vessels built in the colony were 17; tonnage,
1,196. In 1841, 33; tonnage, 2,037; In 1842, 25; tonnage, 1,297.
In 1843, 41; tonnage, 1,231. In 1844, 15; tonnage, 498. In 1845,
15; tonnage, 931. In 1846, 27; tonnage, 1,013. In 1847, 33;
tonnage, 2,122. In 1848, 26; tonnage, 1,281. In 1849, 35;
tonnage, 1,720. In 1850, 36; tonnage 1,605. In 1851, 24; tonnage
939.</p>
<h5>TIMBER.</h5>
<p>In 1837 the import was in value £4,303; in 1838, £3,347; in
1839, £8,260; in 1840, £15,254; in 1841, £13,192; in 1842,
£11,559; in 1843, £3,457; in 1844, £1,553; in 1845, £6,235; in
1846, 4,051; in 1847, 4,426; in 1848, 1,765; in 1849, 1,891; in
1850, £2,159; in 1851, £3,721. The export has been, in 1837,
£14,562; in 1838, £6,444; in 1839, £8,815; in 1840, £21,750; in
1841, £7,004; in 1842, £5,806; in 1843, £9,534; in 1844, £7,989;
in 1845, £7,319; in 1846, £7,060; in 1847, £7,158; in 1848,
£5,591; in 1849, £12,988; in 1850, £17,138; in 1851, £17,462.</p>
<h5>THE FISHERIES.</h5>
<p>The return of the export of all the produce of the fisheries
of the colony, shows a very great decrease in late years. The
value of the oil exported in 1837 was £183,122; in 1838,
£197,644; in 1839, £172,315; in 1840, £224,144; in 1841,
£127,470; in 1842, £77,012; in 1843, £72,877; in 1844, £52,665;
in 1845, £95,674; in 1846, £68,936; in 1847, £79,298; in 1848,
£68,969; in 1849, £44,993; In 1850, £28,999; in 1851,
£25,877.</p>
<h5>AUCTION SALES AND DUTIES.</h5>
<p>The return on auction sales and duties is more satisfactory.
In 1840 the sales were £1,035,196 5s., and the duty was £15,527
18s. 10d.; in 1841 the duty was £12,811 0s. 1d.; in 1842, £8,900
8s. 2d.; in 1843, £5,865 15s. 5d.; from which it sank down by
1847 to £4,834 6s. After that year the auction duties were taken
off articles of colonial produce, and the sales in 1848 were
£649,815 16s. 8d., duties, £3,249 1s. 7d.; in 1849, sales
£545,797 10s., duties, £2,728 18s. 9d.; in 1850, sales £1,143,649
3s. 4d., duties £5,718 4s. 11d.; in 1851, sales £467,575, duties
£2,337 17s. 6d.</p>
<h5>SALE OF CROWN LANDS.</h5>
<p>The sale of Crown lands is also a return of interest, as it is
now separated from the Port Phillip sales. In 1837, the amount
sold was £116,474 18s. 5d.; in 1838, £79,130 6s. 10d.; in 1839,
£92,968 1s. 9d.; in 1840, £97,498 10s. 11d.; in 1841, £19,235
15s. 7d.; in 1842, £11,844 17s. 8d.; in 1843, £5,311 2s.; in
1844, £6,745 14s. 8d.; in 1845, £11,563 13s. 10d.; in 1846,
£11,249 19s. 3d.; in 1847, £2,929 19s. 2d.; in 1848, £7,624 6s.
6d.; in 1849, £20,113 12s. 3d.; in 1850, £33,757 6s. 11d.; in
1851, £64,425 17s. 6d. In the last three years, at least
one-third of the amount went to the credit of the general
revenue, being the produce of the sale of the land on the site of
the Circular Quay and old Military Barracks.</p>
<h5>COIN IN THE COLONY.</h5>
<p>The next return is of coin in the colony, contained in the
military chest, and in the banks; and in 1845, when the amount
was greatest, it was £855,166; in 1846, £827,306; in 1847,
£634,186; in 1848, £633,803; in 1849, £643,458; in 1850,
£670,852; in 1851, £540,766.</p>
<h5>GENERAL REVENUE.</h5>
<p>The amount of the general revenue collected in the year 1851
was £277,728 18s. 1d.; the territorial revenue was £204,508 7s.
2d.; the Church and School Estates fund, £4,460 18s. 9d.; being a
total revenue of £486,698 4s.</p>
<p>The total expenditure of the general revenue was £290,361 6s.
3d.; of the territorial, £153,747 3s. 7d.; total, £444,108 9s.
10d.</p>
<h5>THE POST-OFFICE.</h5>
<p>The Post-office return is very interesting. In the year 1849,
the year before the Uniform Postage Act came into operation, the
number of post-offices in the colony was 88; the number of
persons employed, 115; the number of miles travelled by the
mails, 586,675; the number of ship letters, 178,533; inland
letters, 383,353; town letters, 47,135; ship newspapers, 277,787;
inland, 457,197; total letters, 609,201; newspapers, 734,984;
income, £15,462 9s. 10d.; expenditure, £13,751 7s. 11d. In 1850,
when the new Act came into force, the number of post-offices was
increased to 96, and in 1851 to 101; the number of persons
employed, to 123; in 1851, to 137; the number of miles travelled,
to 686,614; and in 1851, to 751,154; the number of ship letters,
not affected by the new Act, to 179,406; and in 1851, to 202,480;
the number of inland letters, from 383,353 to 592,026; and in
1851, to 694,356; the number of town letters, to 70,877; and in
1851, to 78,482; the number of inland newspapers in the first
year rather decreased, as there was a postage charge of one penny
made upon them for the first time. The total number of letters in
1850 was 842,309; and in 1851, 975,318. The income in 1850 was
reduced from £15,462 9s. 10d. to £13,646 5s. 9d., while the
expenditure was increased from £13,651 7s. 11d. to £15,732 11s.
4d.; but in 1851 the revenue had increased to £18,252 1s. 11d.,
while the expenditure was £16,324 13s. 4d.</p>
<h5>IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.</h5>
<p>The value of the total imports and exports of the colony of
New South Wales, in each of the last eight years, was in round
numbers as follows:</p>

<br>
<p>The imports of last year exceeded those of the previous year
by £230,500, or rather more than seventeen per cent.; while the
exports show the far larger increase of £439,100, or thirty-two
per cent. So that in the first year of our gold discovery, the
increase of our exports was nearly double that of our
imports.</p>
<p>Comparing the figures of 1851 with those of 1844, it will be
seen that during the last seven years both the imports and
exports had rather more than doubled themselves.</p>
<p>Last year the exports exceeded the imports by £233,000, or
about 15 per cent. It should not be overlooked, however, that the
exports of 1851 include colonial gold to the amount of £468,336,
being the produce of about six months' digging.</p>
<p>The ratios per head of the population, at each of the last two
censuses, were about as follows:&mdash;</p>
<table class="2" style=
"table-layout:fixed; width:70%; font-size:90%;" align="center"

</tbody>
</table>
<br>
<p>It thus appears that while the ratio of imports shows a
diminution of three shillings per head, that of exports shows an
increase of £2 15s.; and that while in 1846 the imports exceeded
the exports by £1 13s. per head, in 1851 the exports exceeded the
imports by £1 5s.</p>
<h5>TAXES AND CUSTOMS DUES.</h5>
<p>The revenue of the colony of New South Wales is derived from
customs dues and the proceeds of pastoral licences, an assessment
on live stock, and the licences issued to gold diggers and the
sale of land.</p>
<p>An inclination was at one time prevalent among influential
members of the Legislative Council to establish a protective
tariff, if the power of so doing should be conceded by the
Imperial Parliament; but more sound financial ideas have recently
prevailed, and in 1852 the new Legislative Council established a
tariff of great simplicity and liberality, while the auction
duties have been abolished, as also all port and harbour dues. In
fact, Sydney offers an example of a great free-trade port.</p>
<p>The duties now charged on goods imported to New South Wales
are solely as follows:&mdash;Ale and beer in wood, 1d. per
gallon; ale and beer in bottle, 3d. per gallon; coffee,
chocolate, and cocoa, ¾d. per lb.; currants, raisins, and other
dried fruits, ½d. per lb.; brandy, proof strength, 6s. per
gallon; gin, ditto, 6s. per gallon; rum, and all other spirits,
4s. per gallon; perfumed spirits, of whatever strength, 4s. per
gallon; all spirits, liqueurs, cordials, brandied fruits, or
strong waters, 6s. per gallon; refined sugar, 3s. 4d. per cwt.;
unrefined ditto, 2s. 6d. per cwt.; molasses, 1s. 8d. per cwt.;
tea, l½d. per lb.; manufactured tobacco, other than cigars and
snuffs, 1s. 6d. until the 31st day of December, 1853, and
thereafter, 1s.; unmanufactured tobacco, Is; per lb. until 31st
December, 1853, and thereafter 8d. per lb.; cigars and snuffs,
2s. per lb.; wine, 1s. per gallon.</p>
<p>The eminent simplicity of this tariff has created the highest
satisfaction throughout the colony. The duties on spirits and
tobacco, being articles of luxury and the use of which, indeed, a
wise policy would be as far as prudent to resist can be no burden
on any one.</p>
<p>The duty on tea and sugar is one which will so equally and
universally affect all classes, that no injustice can be
inflicted by it; and if it cause a fractional advance in the
price of these articles to the consumer, the absence of taxation
on all other articles will enable him to procure those articles
at a proportionably cheaper rate. As long as money must be raised
by taxation for revenue purposes, the one great principle to be
observed is to make that taxation bear equally on all, and it is
wise therefore to confine duties to those articles only which are
of very general consumption.</p>
<p>It is confidently anticipated that this alteration of the
tariff will have a most beneficial effect, both as regards the
amount of revenue collected, and the encouragement it will give
to trade. Concurrently with the passing of this act, <i>all port
and harbour dues, and all auction duties, were repealed</i>; and
it may perhaps be said, that New South Wales affords the first
example of a great commercial community abandoning almost without
exception the legislative restrictions by which trade has
hitherto been governed.</p>
<h5>PORT PHILLIP.</h5>
<p>The statistics of Port Phillip have not been prepared this
year.</p>
<p>In 1851 the population of Melbourne was 23,000, of which
12,000 were males. This population has been increased to
something approaching 60,000, dwelling in huts and tents.</p>
<p>The population of 1851 was divided as to religion into 10,000
Church of England, 3,000 Presbyterians, 1,600 Wesleyans, 1,500
other Protestants, 5,500 Roman Catholics, 233 Jews.</p>
<p>The Quarter's Revenue for the quarter ending 30th September,
1852, showed an increase of four hundred thousand pounds over the
same quarter in 1851. Every item of the revenue depending on
consumption shows an increase, the post-office only being
stationary. The gold licences produced 109,000, but considering
that at least 60,000 diggers were at work, this item ought to
have amounted to £270,000.</p>
<p>The Live Stock were by the last returns:&mdash;Sheep,
6,033,000; Cattle, 346,562; Horses, 16,734.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX.</h3>
<h4>[THE GOLD DISCOVERIES.]</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the month of April, 1851, New South
Wales and Port Phillip were enjoying an unexampled condition of
financial and commercial prosperity; the demand for labour was
steadily increasing, and in the elder colony several manufactures
and copper-mines were affording new investments for colonial
capital. The leading colonial journal was amusing its readers
with calculations of the period when all the pastoral land of the
colony would be overstocked with sheep and cattle. The
politicians had their grievances to discuss, among which was the
long delay in establishing a steam post.</p>
<p>In the midst of this satisfactory state of affairs, "through
the Exchange of Sydney a horrid rumour ran" that a great
gold-field had been found near Bathurst. Very soon small
"nuggets"&mdash;the word is Californian&mdash;arrived in the
city, and were handed about as curiosities. Thereupon a few score
pedestrians, chiefly of the humblest class, set out to walk to
Bathurst, 140 miles.</p>
<p>By the 2nd May there was no longer any doubt about the
diggings; crowds of all ranks streamed across the Blue Mountains;
the governor's proclamation gave official currency to the
dazzling fact; the gold fever commenced.</p>
<p>When whispers and rumours had grown into a great fact, every
body wondered that the discovery had not been made before, as it
had been so often prophesied by various individuals, none of whom
seem to have had, like Mr. Hargreaves, sufficient confidence in
their own judgment to travel to the district, and put a spade
into the ground.</p>
<p>The history of the gold discoveries in Australia lies in a
very short compass, but is worth telling. It illustrates many
curious things.</p>
<p>The first written reference to the existence of gold in
Australia is to be found in a despatch (not published at the
time) addressed by Sir George Gipps, 2nd of September, 1840, to
the Secretary of State for the Colonies, in which he encloses a
report from Count Strzelecki, mentioning under gold "an
auriferous sulphuret of iron, partly decomposed, yielding a very
small quantity of gold, although not enough to repay extraction,"
which he found in the Vale of Clwdd. It was known to a few that
an old shepherd of the name of Macgregor was in the habit of
annually selling small parcels of gold to jewellers; but those
who watched him could discover nothing, and the common belief was
that he sold the produce of robberies which had been melted up to
destroy suspicion. The Rev. D. Mackenzie, in his "Gold-digger,"
states that this old man has recently acknowledged that he
obtained his gold from a place called Mitchell's Creek, beyond
Wellington Valley, about 200 miles west of Sydney.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. B. Clarke, one of the colonial chaplains, and a
geologist of considerable acquirements, in 1846, privately, but
unsuccessfully, directed the attention of some of his brother
colonists, among others of Mr. Manning to the gold-bearing
regions of Bathurst. While in England Sir Roderick Murchison read
a paper before the Royal Geographical Society, in 1844, compared
the eastern chain of Australia to the Ural Mountains. In 1846, a
year before the Californian discovery, he addressed the Royal
Geological Society of Cornwall, recommending unemployed Cornish
tin-miners to emigrate to New South Wales, and dig for gold in
the debris and drift of what he termed the "Australian
Cordillera," in which he had recently heard that gold had been
discovered in small quantities, and in which he anticipated, from
the similarity with the Ural Mountains, that it would certainly
be found in abundance.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image29" id="Image29"></a><img alt=""
src="1400441h-images/Image29.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>GOLD DIGGINGS AT OPHIR.</small></p>
<br>
<p>After these opinions had been made public, persons resident in
Sydney and Adelaide sought for and found specimens of gold, which
they transmitted to Sir Roderick, who thereupon wrote to Earl
Grey, the minister for the colonies, in November, 1848, stating
the grounds for his confident expectation that gold would be
found in large quantities, and suggesting precautionary measures.
Earl Grey never answered this letter, and neither took measures
nor sent out private instructions to prepare the governor for the
realisation of the predictions of the man of science. As he
afterwards explained, he thought it better that the people should
stick to wool-growing.</p>
<p>The first printed notice by Mr. Clarke appeared in the
<i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> in 1847, in which, following in Sir
Roderick Murchison's footsteps, he compared Australia with the
Ural.</p>
<p>In 1848 a Mr. Smith, engaged in iron-works near Berrima,*
waited upon Mr. Deas Thomson, the colonial secretary, produced a
lump of gold imbedded in quartz, which he said he had found, and
offered, on receipt of £800, to discover the locality. On
reference to the governor, a verbal answer was returned that, if
Mr. Smith chose to trust to the liberality of the government, he
might rely on being rewarded in proportion to the value of the
alleged discovery. The government suspected that the lump of gold
came from California, "and were afraid of agitating the public
mind by ordering geological investigations." Nothing more has
been heard of Mr. Smith.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Berrima, In the county of Camden, eighty-one
miles from Sydney.]</p>
<p>On the 3rd of April, 1851, Mr. Edward Hargreaves addressed a
letter to the colonial secretary, after several interviews, in
which he said that if the government would award him 500 as a
compensation, he would, point out localities where gold was to be
found, and leave it to the generosity of the government to make
him an additional reward commensurate with the benefit likely to
accrue to the government.</p>
<p>It seems that Mr. Hargreaves, while in California, was struck
with the similarity between the richest diggings of that country
and a district in the Bathurst country which he had travelled
over fifteen years previously; and on his return to Sydney made
an exploring expedition of two months, which realised his
expectations.</p>
<p>The same answer was returned to Mr. Hargreaves as to Mr.
Smith. He was satisfied, and on the 30th April wrote, naming
Lewis Ponds and Summerhill Creeks, and Macquarie River, in the
district of Bathurst and Wellington, as the districts where gold
would be found.</p>
<p>A copy of this letter was, by the governor's directions,
forwarded to the colonial geologist, Mr. Stutchbury, with whom
Mr. Hargreaves was put in communication.</p>
<p>Messrs. Hargreaves and Stutchbury set out on their journey. On
the 8th of May, a Mr. Green, a crown commissioner, wrote in great
alarm from Bathurst that "a Mr. Hargreaves has been employing
people to dig for gold on the Summerhill Creek, who have found
several ounces;" and suggested "that some stringent measure be
adopted to prevent the labouring classes from leaving their
employments to search on the crown lands." On the 13th of May Mr.
Green writes again, in still more alarm:&mdash;"A piece of gold
valued at £30 had been brought in, and that he feared that any
future regulations would be set at defiance."</p>
<p>Having frequently in the course of this work had occasion to
stigmatise the mistakes and misdeeds of the local colonial
government, it is only common justice to say that the line of
conduct adopted by Sir Charles Fitzroy and his council on the
occurrence of the gold crisis reflects upon them the highest
credit.</p>
<p>A few dates will show how rapidly gold-gathering grew into an
important pursuit, stimulating agriculture, and overshadowing the
pastoral interest.</p>
<p>May 14th. Mr. Stutchbury reported that he "had seen sufficient
to prove the existence of grain gold."</p>
<p>19th. "That many persons with merely a tin dish have obtained
one or two ounces a day. Four hundred persons at work, occupying
about a mile of the Summerhill Creek, fear that great confusion
will arise in consequence of people setting up claims."</p>
<p>22nd. A proclamation was issued declaring the rights of the
crown to gold found in its natural place of deposit within the
territory of New South Wales.</p>
<p>23rd. John Richard Hardy, Esq., chief magistrate of Paramatta,
was appointed the first gold commissioner, with instructions to
organise a mounted police of ten men; to issue licences to gold
diggers, at the rate of 30s. a month; to receive in payment gold
obtained by amalgamation at £2 8s. per ounce, and at £3 4s. per
ounce for gold obtained by washing. And, to preserve the peace
and put down outrage and violence, he was further instructed to
co-operate with the local police, and to swear in special
constables from the licensed diggers.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>ISSUING LICENCES</small></p>
<br>
<p>25th. Mr. Stutchbury reported that gold diggers had increased
to one thousand; that lumps had been found varying in weight from
one ounce to four pounds; that the larger pieces were generally
got out of fissures in the rock, "clay slate," which forms the
bed of the river, dipped to the north-east at various angles, the
fissile edges presenting jagged edges, which had opened under the
influence of the atmosphere, "the smaller grain gold being
procured by washing the alluvial soil resting upon and filling in
the clewage joints of the slate;" that "gold was also found in
the planks of the ranges, proving that it had originated in the
mountains."</p>
<p>He observes:&mdash;"The workings at present are conducted in
the most wasteful manner, from the cupidity and ignorance of the
people, which cannot be remedied until some officer is appointed
acquainted with the proper mode of working, with power to enforce
it. The best thing that could happen would be a severe flood,
which would fill the diggings, and oblige them to begin, <i>de
novo</i>, under proper restrictions."</p>
<p>Such is the constant hankering of government officials to
teach and regulate commercial enterprise.</p>
<p>Mr. Stutchbury further reported that gold had been found in
Argyle, on the Abercrombie River, in the creeks running north and
south of the Canobolas Mountains, such as Oakey Creek, the whole
length of the Macquarie from Bathurst to Wellington.</p>
<p>About this time a considerable number of respectable persons
were seized with terror, lest the whole framework of society
should become disorganised, and anarchy and violence become
chronic.</p>
<p>When the existence of gold was first ascertained, there were
flock-owners who disapproved of the course pursued by the
governor in raising gold-digging to the condition of a regular
industrial pursuit, and recommended "that martial law should be
proclaimed, and all gold-digging peremptorily prohibited, <i>in
order that the ordinary industrial pursuits of the country should
not be interfered with</i>;" that is to say, some of the same
order who have always patronised vagabond bachelor shepherds, and
opposed the establishment of wives, families, and small farms in
the interior, were ready to risk a civil war rather than endanger
their wool crops.</p>
<p>But, fortunately, the governor had no taste for spilling the
blood of his countrymen in a "futile attempt to stop the influx
of the tide."</p>
<p>Provincial Inspector Scott, of the police, reports from
Bathurst that the distance thence to Summerhill Creek is forty
miles, over a clear and denned but mountainous road, fit for the
passage of drays:</p>
<p>"Thought that the deposits of the creek would be exhausted
soon&mdash;that any mechanics in full work would commit an act of
insanity to resign their situations in search of gold; that on
Sabbath all parties left off work, and the Rev. Mr. Chapman, a
Wesleyan minister, preached to a large congregation. Further, Mr.
Scott anticipated difficulty in preserving the peace, unless
prompt and energetic measures were adopted&mdash;viz., to swear
in all respectable persons as special constables, and permit them
to be armed; to grant licences to other classes (not
respectable), and take their arms away to be locked up in
Bathurst Courthouse."</p>
<p>From the letters of the provincial inspector of the same date,
reporting the preparations he had made to assist the gold
commissioner, in case of the anticipated resistance, it is
evident that no ordinary degree of alarm was generally
experienced.</p>
<p>But, fortunately, the colonists of Australia proved themselves
more orderly and sensible than the police and other timid
individuals had imagined; and in Mr. Hardy, the first gold
commissioner, the governor had selected a man of judgment,
temper, and cool courage, who was determined to let the
industrious miners have fair play, and equally determined to
enforce his lawful authority. His reports are all models of
strong common sense.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image31" id="Image31"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>MR. HARDY, THE FIRST GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>For instance, when called before the Executive Council to be
informed of his appointment, he states, "that he does not
consider that he should have any difficulty in enforcing an
observance of any reasonable regulations, if twelve mounted men
on whom he could depend were attached to him, all being soldiers
who have but a short time longer to serve to entitle them to
claim their discharge with pensions." He does not desire to
associate civilians with soldiers. His confidence was not
misplaced.</p>
<p>June 2nd. Mr. Hardy arrived on Summerhill with eight extra
police, lent by Major Went worth; found not the least desire to
resist the government regulations, and did not keep the extra
force on the ground half an hour. An arrangement to intercept all
new arrivals, by sending them to an unoccupied ground, prevented
confusion.</p>
<p>On June 8th, four hundred and forty-six licences had been
issued; to two or three hundred new arrivals he had given a few
days to pay; quiet and good order prevailed: "in one instance
alone was there an inclination to disregard my decision. A tall,
strong man, a butcher at Bathurst, who had been in the habit of
beginning to work wherever he saw promises of lumps of gold,
trusting to his strength to keep down opposition, began to work
on another man's opening. I told him to desist; but as soon as I
turned my back, he began again saying he would work where he
liked in spite of any one. I turned back immediately, and as I
went up to him he dropped his pick and snatched up a spade as if
to strike at me. I instantly collared him, put him in handcuffs,
and marched him off the ground, declaring my intention of sending
him to Bathurst gaol. I sent up to my camp, with orders for a
policeman to get ready to take him in, and continued my walk. On
my return, in about an hour, the man was very penitent, begged to
be let off, which I did: he has been working quietly ever since,
and the neighbourhood has been relieved of a very unpleasant man.
I have mentioned this to show how easily such a population may be
managed. There is no occasion for any increase of force
here."</p>
<p>There is no doubt that if convicts from Van Diemen's Land
could have been kept out of the gold-fields, there never would
have been any dangerous disturbances.</p>
<p>June 9. The government geologist reported the existence of
gold in the Turon, and other branches of the River Macquarie; and
Mr. Hardy, anxious that there should be no great accumulation of
diggers, posted up notices of the new discoveries.</p>
<p>For this measure, as tending to stimulate gold-digging, for
giving time to new arrivals to pay for their licences, and for
not swearing in special constables, he was called to account by
the Executive Council.</p>
<p>The advantage of dispersing the daily-arriving armies of
diggers, by giving them actual intelligence instead of mere
rumours for a guide, would seem obvious to any one except those
Mother Partingtons of legislation who still hoped to mop back the
tide which had set in from other employments towards the
gold-field.</p>
<p>June 11. Mr. Hardy writes:&mdash;"All anxiety as to the
payment of the licence fee is at end. I give parties who profess
themselves unable to pay at the onset a few days. But it is well
understood, and invariably acted on, that no man works more than
a few days without a licence; and it is partly from this known
circumstance that so many leave after a week's fruitless labour.
This is, after all, of a good tendency. Universally successful
diggers would leave the colony in a bad position. The return to
their former employments adds greatly to the general benefit.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image32" id="Image32"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>DODGING THE COMMISSIONER.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"With respect to special constables I do not think I need be
under any apprehension of any opposition to the payment of
licences. It was necessary on two occasions to break the cradles,
and march the owners off the ground, not on account of any
refusal to pay the licence fee, but because the parties had
worked the four or five days I had given them to determine
whether they were able to pay or not, and still professed their
inability to pay, and refused to take up their cradles and
remove. In such cases, and indeed <i>in all cases, instant and
determined action is necessary, and disregard of possible
consequences the safest policy</i>. Some days ago several persons
were working on Mr. Lane's land, and on the application of Mr.
Rudder, who was in charge of the ground, I ordered them off. Half
an hour after I found one set of men still at work, and, although
alone, and two miles away from my men, I did not hesitate to kick
the cradle into the stream, and take the owner a prisoner into
the town. If I had thought it necessary to call upon Mr. Rudder
and those who were with him, instead of acting as I did, I should
not have succeeded better&mdash;I probably should not have
succeeded at all; and the probability is, that on the many
occasions when I am necessarily alone, and in remote places, I
might meet with defiance, as one who could do nothing unless his
police were with him. I can rely on myself; I have the most
perfect reliance on the men, one and all, that the government has
given me; but I could never rely on special constables, however
respectable: <i>the more respectable the more unfit under the
peculiar circumstances</i>."</p>
<p>The same good sense and firmness characterise Mr. Hardy's
answer to the deputation of diggers who came up to present a
petition and some resolutions for the reduction of the licence
fee from thirty shillings a month to seven shillings and
sixpence:&mdash;"I informed the deputation that I should advise
the government not to lower the licence fee, and I informed them
of my reasons for so doing, as follows:&mdash;It was well
ascertained that about eight hundred persons earned on an average
£1 per diem; that about six or seven hundred earned from three to
four or five shillings a day; that about three hundred earned
nothing; that the first-mentioned eight hundred were able,
industrious, and persevering men, working in the numerous
favourable localities on the creek; that the second six or seven
hundred were men who worked some time less than a week without
judgment, and who had not the energy, strength, and bodily powers
to be successful; that the last-mentioned three hundred were men
who did not work at all, but, after looking about for a day or
two, went off in disgust; consequently, that to the eight hundred
successful diggers the thirty-shilling fee was positively
nothing, seeing that any man could live well on nine shillings a
week; that the remainder&mdash;the partially and totally
unsuccessful&mdash;would be much better employed in their past
avocations. That the government had to consider the general
interests of the community, and not those of the diggers alone,
and that those general interests would not be advanced by
encouraging all the labouring hands of the colony to be employed
in gold-digging."</p>
<p>In July the rush to the diggings had somewhat moderated, when
the discovery of a hundredweight of gold revived and stimulated
the excitement to a degree which affected all classes of society;
and, after that discovery, crowds of gentlemen repaired to the
diggings. This great prize having been raised by a gentleman (Dr.
Kerr) who had not taken out a licence, the gold commissioner, in
the exercise of his duty, seized it, in order to assert the
rights of the crown. By an equitable arrangement it was
afterwards given up, a precedent having thus been established, on
payment of a royalty of ten per cent.</p>
<p>"In the first week of July an educated aboriginal, formerly
attached to the Wellington mission, and who has been in the
service of W. J. Kerr, Esq., of Wallawa, about seven years,
returned home to his employer with the intelligence that he had
discovered a large mass of gold amongst a heap of quartz upon the
run whilst tending his sheep. He had amused himself by exploring
the country adjacent to his employer's land, and his attention
was first called to the lucky spot by observing a speck of some
glittering yellow substance upon the surface of a block of the
quartz, upon which he applied his tomahawk, and broke off a
portion. At that moment the splendid prize stood revealed to his
sight. His first care was to start off home and disclose his
discovery to his master, to whom he presented whatever gold might
be procured from it. As may be supposed, little time was lost by
the worthy doctor. Quick as horseflesh would carry him he was on
the ground, and in a very short period the three blocks of
quartz, containing <i>the hundredweight of gold</i>, were
released from the bed where, charged with unknown wealth, they
had rested perhaps for thousands of years, awaiting the hand of
civilised man to disturb them.</p>
<p>"The largest of the blocks was about a foot in diameter, and
weighed 75 lbs. gross. Out of this piece 60 lbs. of pure gold
were taken. Before separation it was beautifully encased in
quartz. The other two were something smaller. The auriferous mass
weighed as nearly as could be guessed from two to three
hundredweight. Not being able to move it conveniently, Dr. Kerr
broke the pieces into small fragments, and herein committed a
very grand error. As specimens the glittering blocks would have
been invaluable. Nothing yet known of would have borne
comparison, or, if any, the comparison would have been in our
favour. From the description given by him, as seen in their
original state, the world has seen nothing like them yet.</p>
<p>"The heaviest of the two large pieces presented an appearance
not unlike a honeycomb or sponge, and consisted of particles of a
crystalline form, as did nearly the whole of the gold. The second
larger piece was smoother, and the particles more condensed, and
seemed as if it had been acted upon by water. The remainder was
broken into lumps of from two to three pounds and downwards, and
were remarkably free from quartz or earthy matter.</p>
<p>"In the place where this mass of treasure was found, quartz
blocks formed an isolated heap, and were distant about one
hundred yards from a quartz vein which stretches up the ridge
from the Meroo Creek. The locality is the commencement of an
undulating tableland, very fertile, and is contiguous to a
never-failing supply of water in the above-named creek. It is
distant about fifty-three miles from Bathurst, eighteen from
Mudgee, thirty from Wellington, and eighteen to the nearest point
of the Macquarie river, and is within about eight miles of Dr.
Kerr's head station. The neighbouring country has been pretty
well explored since the discovery, but, with the exception of
dust, no further indication has been found.</p>
<p>"In return for his very valuable services, Dr. Kerr has
presented the black fellow and his brother with two flocks of
sheep, two saddle horses, and a quantity of rations, and supplied
them with a team of bullocks to plough some land in which they
are about to sow a crop of maize and potatoes. One of the
brothers, mounted on a serviceable roadster, accompanied the
party into town, and appeared not a little proud of his share in
the transaction."</p>
<p>Dr. Kerr, the fortunate finder of this lump of gold, is
mentioned in one of the Voluntary Statements from which we have
several times quoted as an excellent, kind master. His
brother-in-law, Mr. Suttor, of Brucedale, is a son of the
introducer of orange-groves, also one of the most deservedly
popular men in the colony.</p>

<br>
<small>A NUGGET OF GOLD</small></p>
<br>
<p>Dr. Kerr's great prize revived the "sacred rage for gold"
among the whole population, and Sydney seemed about to be
deserted. New discoveries in various directions were made.</p>
<p>The Bathurst district consists of elevated table-land,
intersected by barren ridges, watered by a series of Australian
rivers flowing from the Canobolas Mountains, most of which have
been found to be auriferous. The journey to Bathurst was easily
performed by mail-coach or on horseback. Arrived at Bathurst, the
explorer found himself in the midst of a rich pastoral and
agricultural district, in which every fertile valley had a small
colony of settlers, ready to supply flour, meat, milk, and
butter, at reasonable charges.</p>
<p>The gold-diggers, instead of settling in a wilderness infested
by grizzly bears and savage Indians, like California, found
themselves in a district where a market was only needed to call
into cultivation thousands of acres of capital land&mdash;at
Frederick's Valley, a gold placer of extraordinary richness,
belonging to Mr. Wentworth; at Summerhill Farms, at King's
Plains, Pretty Plains, Emu Swamp, and the Cornish Settlement,
where the crops in the severest droughts never failed.</p>
<p>The Summerhill diggings, which are now nearly exhausted, and
the style of life which prevails throughout the interior of
Australia, are well depicted in the following sketch by a
correspondent of the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Monday, June 2.&mdash;In the morning the ice was thick upon
the water in the dishes outside, and the ground covered with hoar
frost, as it always is here in fine weather at this season; hot
days and frosty nights.</p>
<p>"To an unscientific eye the gold country (Bathurst district)
consists of a mass, not of ranges, but apparently of points of
ranges, thrown together without any regular arrangement, but
dovetailing into one another like the teeth of two saws placed
close together, face to face; these teeth again being cut into
smaller pieces by narrow precipitous gullies, many of them nearly
as deep as the main creek itself. Small creeks twist and twine
down these narrow gullies, which have a sudden bend every
half-dozen yards, into the Summerhill or main creek, which twists
and twines like the others, but on a larger scale. The banks of
the gullies are precipitous on both sides, but in the main creek
there are alternate bluffs and low points, the teeth of the saw
sloping gently down, diminishing in height as they do in width,
till they come to a point overhung on the opposite side by a high
bluff or precipice, which forms the inside of the nick of the
opposite saw; and, as we stood upon the edge of the cliff, we
looked down nearly two hundred feet over and along each side of
the opposite point, dotted with tents and gunyas of bark or
branches, each with its fire in front, sending the blue smoke up
into the clear frosty morning air; some under the noble swamp
oaks at the water's edge, others behind and under the box and gum
trees which towered one above another till the rising branch was
merged in the main ridge behind. The point was occupied by about
fifteen parties cutting straight into the hill; and, as we looked
down upon their busy movements, digging, carrying earth, and
working the cradles at the edge of the water, with the noise of
the pick, the sound of voices, and the washing of the shingle in
the iron boxes of the cradles, I could scarcely believe that two
months ago this was a quiet secluded gully in a far-out
cattle-run, where a solitary stockkeeper or black fellow on the
hunt were all that ever broke the solitude of nature. On saying
so to Scotch Harry, he said that he had stock-kept there for
nearly twenty years, and when he came there were flocks of
kangaroos; these were driven off by the cattle, and now they were
as completely driven off by the gold-diggers, 'Little enough the
first occupiers thought of gold,' I remarked. 'Yes,' answered
Scotch Harry, 'and it would be well for some of these fellows if
they thought as little;' and he told us of two who had gone mad
already&mdash;one a shepherd, in the neighbourhood, found a piece
while poking about his run, and came to him making a great
mystery about the place, till he could find no more, when he took
him to it, but it was a chance piece, and not accompanied by five
or six more, as is usually the case; the fellow, however, was not
satisfied, and continued searching about, till, from excitement
and anxiety, he went mad; the other was a man who, after starving
for two days, found 5 lbs. weight, fainted repeatedly, and is now
in confinement. Kerr said that two months ago hardly a traveller
passed his house in a week, now they were in crowds every hour;
his children never thought there were so many people in the world
before, and wondered what it all meant; he could hardly believe
it himself. We did not find our dray, but heard of it close at
hand, and sat down to look about us. Drays and parties of men
were arriving every few minutes, many of whom gave a cheer as if
they saw fortune in their hand when they looked down upon the
workers in the bed of the creek below; some were putting up tents
and gunyas, and some working, but all busy and all in good
humour, barring the men who were constantly leaving, and looked
sufficiently disgusted. We were a good deal puzzled how to get
our baggage carried to Messrs. Roach and Barrington's, as it
would take us at least two days to carry seven hundredweight over
two miles of such ridges, or down the bed of the creek, cut up as
it is in every direction; but, just as the last rays of the sun
were leaving the top of the ridge, a party of nine native
warriors, in their new government blankets, painted and armed
with spears and boomerangs, came winding down the bank. As they
passed through our camp, I asked the foremost if they would carry
our baggage, to which they at once agreed, and camped with
us.</p>
<p>"We were all astir at daylight, and found the water frozen in
the bucket, and the top of our blankets quite wet within the
tent. The loads were adjusted, and the blacks, with the two men,
started under the guidance of the company, and returned about
noon by a short cut, we remaining to erect the tent. On loading
them again, one fellow complained that a pot of beef hurt his
head, so I gave him a roll of brown paper, but soon found my
mistake, as not a man would move without the same, so that when I
came to the last there was not a scrap left; he had only bedding
to carry, and I explained to him that no pad was necessary, but
he drew himself up and asked if I thought him a fool; 'Another
one black fellow hab it.' He was evidently in earnest, and would
have left his load there and then, had I not clapped a
calling-card on his shaggy bullet head, and he went off quite
proud; we gave them one shilling each and their rations, which is
high pay for a black. Many return at once, without giving it one
minute's trial. I saw one party arrive, six respectable looking
hardworking men, all well provided with tools, clothes, and
provisions. As I stood conversing with one of them, who was
putting his things together to move to their tent, a parcel
unrolled, and a Bible and Prayer-book fell out. He looked up, and
said they should not forget these even for gold, to which I
assented, with the remark that men would get none the less gold
for minding them."</p>
<p>The Turon, which, like many Australian names, was scarcely
known beyond its immediate neighbourhood before the gold
discoveries, rises in the county of Roxburgh, near Cullen Cullen,
and flows, like the Summerhill Creek, into the Macquarie. On its
banks Sofala has been founded. Here it was that the art of
cradling gold and washing gold was learned by thousands who have
since removed to Mount Alexander and other districts.</p>
<p>The gold-fields of the Turon include river-bed claims and dry
diggings.</p>
<p>In the river-bed claims it is the object to clear a deep hole
of water, and then wash the mud and sand which have been carried
there in the course of ages; partly washed to the hand of the
miner by the torrents of nature. "In dry diggings" the earth
after being raised must be carefully broken up and washed.</p>
<p>Fortunate diggers come from time to time upon lumps or
"nuggets" of various sizes, which once excited great attention
and curious comparison between those found in quartz, in clay, in
alluvial mould; but now in the auction-rooms of Sydney and
Melbourne they excite no more attention, unless of rare beauty,
than so much copper or lead.</p>
<p>The immediate result of the rush to the Bathurst gold-fields
was to supply the district with labour at reasonable rates. A
traveller observes:&mdash;"We were much struck by the difference
between their ideas of the mines and those of men at a greater
distance. To the latter the gold country is a place with pieces
of gold ready to be picked up without trouble, and they start
off, trusting to find food somehow, and quarters somewhere, as
they have done hitherto in the bush; but to these men here it is
an open box forest, with severe frosts every night, sleet and
snow for weeks at a time, without any accommodations whatever, or
rations, unless paid for in hard money, at three times the usual
price: if they turn out, they exchange their comfortable warm hut
and regular meals for cold and hunger at once, so that there is
no room for the imagination to work. And though they all intend
to give it a trial when they get their discharge, and their wages
to fit them out, they expressed the greatest astonishment at the
folly of the men they saw passing every day, totally unprovided:
they looked upon them as literally mad."</p>
<p>It would fill a volume, which we may at some future time be
tempted to write, to follow the history of the New South Wales
Gold Fields, with all the curious attendant anecdotes. At present
we cannot do better than avail ourselves of the report made to a
Sydney paper by an eye-witness in the autumn of 1852:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<blockquote>The time which has elapsed since Mr. Hargreaves
announced that extensive auriferous regions existed in the colony
has done much less towards the development of the hidden golden
treasures of this province of the island than was at first
anticipated. In fact, during the last twelve months, since the
attractions of Mount Alexander began to tell on the mining
population engaged at our diggings, we have made but little
progress. With one or two exceptions, our present supplies of
gold are derived from the very same localities whence they were
received last year, the only difference being, that they are in
diminished quantity. The only diggings opened up since that time
which have materially affected the increase in our production of
gold are those of Tambaroura and the Hanging Rock. Even these
were known before that period, although their richness was not
established. In July, 1851, parties were at work in the vicinity
of the Bald Hill, and a short time after at the Dirt Holes; and
about the same time gold had been found, although in small
quantities, near the present diggings on the Peel. During the
last twelve months, the Turon and the Braidwood diggings have
retrogressed, partly in consequence of the incessant rains
impeding as they do mining operations in the beds of creeks and
rivers, but chiefly on account of the migration of the population
to the Victoria gold-fields.<br>
<br>
The attractions of other gold-fields have drawn away the great
body of adventurers&mdash;those who had no other motive to attach
them to the gold-fields here than desire of gain. The large
proportion of gold-diggers left are persons who have got a
permanent interest in the country&mdash;inhabitants of the small
inland towns&mdash;where their families are resident, or settlers
on farms in which all their property is invested. These persons
distributed over the face of the country, of course find it more
profitable and convenient to devote their spare time to working
at diggings in the vicinity of their dwellings, and consequently
are ever on the search for gold near home. There is hardly a
shepherd's hut in the interior, where there is the slightest
probability that the precious metal may be found, which does not
boast of a cradle and other mining implements, devoted to use
whenever opportunity offers.<br>
<br>
The first locality which claims attention is <i>Ophir</i>, the
parent diggings of the colony. Ophir may be regarded as belonging
to what may be termed the Canobolas gold-field. This mountain,
which is nearly a mile in height above the level of the sea, and
is composed chiefly of trap rock, is the centre whence a
considerable number of streams, including the Summerhill Creek,
take their rise, and flowing through a country composed chiefly
of schists and quartzites, are more or less auriferous. Gold has
been found throughout the length of the Summerhill Creek, from
its source at the Canobolas to its junction with the Macquarie,
but most abundantly at Ophir, and Frederick's Valley, where the
Wentworth diggings are situated. The gold is chiefly of a
nuggetty description, and has been found in lumps of three or
four pounds in weight. At the Wentworth diggings, very fine gold
has been obtained in considerable quantities. The country about
Ophir is very broken and rugged, and the deposit of gold lies,
for the most part, in the bed of the creek, as the banks are too
steep to allow of extensive dry or bank diggings. Towards the
Macquarie the banks of the creek become still more rocky and
abrupt, and there is not much likelihood of any extensive deposit
of gold having been formed. The bed of the creek at Ophir has
never been sufficiently dry to allow of its being profitably
worked since the first rains after the opening up of the diggings
on Fitzroy Bar. The population has never been very great since
that period, and at present does not number over two or three
hundred. The earnings at these diggings average from 10s. to 60s.
per diem, and in a few cases much more. There are many parties at
work in the vicinity of the Canobolas, and on creeks flowing from
it. At the Tea Tree Creek and Brown's Creek, profitable diggings
have been opened, and the earnings are from 10s. to 20s. a day,
but the number of persons engaged at these places is not large.
The whole of the region surrounding this mountain, which is
situated some forty or fifty miles to the westward of Bathurst,
may be regarded as a gold-field comparatively unexplored, which
when the return wave of population and enterprise shall have set
in to the gold-fields of this colony, will occupy no
insignificant position.<br>
<br>
The <i>Turon</i> still claims the first position among the
gold-fields of the colony in point of richness and extent.
Sofala, the township which has been formed at the richest
locality on the Turon, is distant about twenty-five miles north
from Bathurst. Fifteen miles above Sofala remunerative diggings
were opened at what is called the Gulf, and thence to the
junction of the river with the Macquarie, a distance of nearly
forty miles, digging operations having been carried on with more
or less success. The geological formation of the country is of
schist, intersected by quartz veins of various thickness, but
there are many other rocks present at different portions of the
river. The mountains are lofty, but with rounded summits and
gently sloping bases, and the river flows for the greater part
through a narrow valley between the ranges. The banks and slopes
on the river side are seldom abrupt, and dry diggings
consequently abound. The gold procured on the river itself is
chiefly dust, generally of a very fine description, but coarse
gold has been obtained in various places, and is abundant in the
creeks and ravines opening into the river. Lumps weighing as much
as seven pounds have been found The yield of gold on the Turon
has been in many instances most extraordinary, In several cases,
from eighty to 100 oz. a day have been obtained by parties of
three or four for days together; in numerous instances from
twenty to fifty ounces a day have been procured, and from five to
fifteen ounces were at one time a common yield. The gold has been
obtained in equal quantities in the bed of the river, and on the
banks and slopes in its vicinity. In the former case the greatest
depth to which it is necessary to go for the gold is from four to
ten or twelve feet, but the continual presence of water has
rendered it generally a matter of difficulty, and often of
impossibility to get at the auriferous deposits. In the dry
diggings the depth of the claims varies from the surface to forty
or fifty feet, and the largest deposits of gold are got in the
pockets and crevices of the bed rock. In the river diggings the
useless surface soil is wholly removed, but in the dry diggings
when a shaft has been sunk, the ground on the level of the gold
deposit is tunnelled. The dry diggings on banks of the Turon are
considered by many to he comparatively exhausted, but this is by
no means the case in the opinion of more competent judges.
Recently rich dry diggings have been discovered on the slope of
the hill leading to the township of Sofala, and not more than a
pistol shot distance from the town. This ground has been
constantly traversed by eager miners for many months, and is
proved to abound in deposits of precious metal, which hundreds
have left its vicinity to seek for at distant localities. The
mining population of the Turon numbered at one time certainly not
less than 10,000, but at present (September, 1852,) the number of
persons engaged in digging on the Turon and its tributaries does
not exceed 1,200. The average yield at these diggings, is from
15s. to £3 or £4 a day, but the instances are numerous in which
large sums are earned in a very short period. The labour required
is great, whether in the bed or the dry diggings, as in the
former the water has constantly to be contended with, and in the
latter, the conglomerate soil which has to be wrought through is
almost as hard as rock. Many of these tributaries, Big Oakey and
Little Oakey Creek especially, have yielded a large amount of
gold. On the tableland, where their source is, parties have been
at work for months, making large earnings; and more extensive
research would, undoubtedly, develop many rich deposits at this
place. Along the Bathurst-road gold has been found, and at
Wyagden Hill, midway between that town and the Turon, operations
on a large scale have been begun.<br>
<br>
The <i>Braidwood</i> diggings next-claim attention. They are
confined chiefly to Major's and Bell's Creeks, which flow over
the tableland, above the valley of Araluen. They are not more
than ten or twelve miles distant from the town of Braidwood. What
is peculiar in these diggings is the fact that they are situated
to the eastwards of the dividing range of mountains. These creeks
before named join the river Moruya, which flows into the sea at
Short Maven, on the east coast, between Bateman's Bay and Twofold
Bay. Major's Creek and its tributary Bell's Creek have amply
repaid those engaged in mining operations on them. The country is
not of so mountainous a description as at the Turon. Slate and
quartz abound in the vicinity, but the bed-rock is granite, and
the gold has been found chiefly in what is regarded as decomposed
granite. The prosperity of these diggings has been seriously
retarded by the incessant rains which have fallen during the last
several months, and the population has almost deserted them. At
one time there must have been nearly 2,000 persons on Major's and
Bell's Creeks and at Araluen; but at present there are not, at
most, more than 500. The average earnings at these diggings
approximate to those at the Turon, and, as at the latter place,
many instances of surprising good fortune have occurred. At
Mungarlow, some fifteen or twenty miles from Major's Creek,
remunerative diggings have been opened, and several nuggets have
been found weighing up to eight or ten ounces. At the Braidwood
diggings the gold is generally fine, and it is reckoned to be
very pure. Dry diggings have been opened on Major's Creek, in
which many parties are procuring four or five ounces of gold a
day.</blockquote>

<br>
<small>GOLD WASHING.</small></p>
<br>
<blockquote>About thirty miles north of the Turon are the Meroo
diggings. The Meroo is a river somewhat resembling the Turon in
its general features, and in its banks and bars large deposits of
gold have been found. The geological character of the country is
similar to that of the Turon. The diggings already opened here
extend several miles along the river. The yield of gold is
generally large, and the gold itself coarse, with occasional
large nuggets. Several points on the Meroo have turned out
uncommonly rich. The golden reputation of the Meroo itself,
however, is small in comparison to that of one of its tributary
creeks, the Louisa, on whose banks such extraordinary masses of
the precious metal have been found, and where the great nugget
vein lies. The country about the Louisa is generally of a flat
description, and the declivities of the creeks are mild. Mr.
Green, assistant commissioner, in a report on the Western Gold
Fields, has expressed his opinion that the auriferous ground
available for dry diggings at this creek extends for several
miles to Campbell's Creek, and that on the tableland, of which
this forms a portion, 40,000 or 50,000 miners could find
profitable employment. Considering that this table land includes
the rich diggings at the Long Creek, the Dirt Holes, the
Tambaroura and other creeks, we do not think that it is any
exaggeration of the truth. At the Louisa beautiful specimens of
gold in the matrix are constantly procured, and nearly all the
gold obtained here is coarse and not waterworn. Nuggets of large
size have been discovered. The hundredweight every one is
familiar with. Brenan's twenty-seven pound lump was found at the
Louisa, as was also the largest waterworn nugget yet obtained,
weighing 157 ounces, besides numerous other nuggets of less size,
which it would be tedious to enumerate. The heavy rains have
greatly interfered with all the diggings from the Meroo to the
Turon, putting a stop to further operations, and compelling the
miners to seek other places. This has been the case at Long
Creek, the Devil's Hole, Pyramul Creek, Nuggetty Gully, Married
Man's Creek, the Dirt Holes, &amp;c. The gold at these places is
coarse, and the earnings are in many cases very large. Generally
speaking a man may make certain of securing 20s. a day if the
weather is favourable and he sticks to his work. The number of
diggers on the Meroo, the Louisa, and the other places just
named, may be put down at 1,500.<br>
<br>
Between the Turon and the Pyramul, and parallel to both, lies the
<i>Tambaroura Creek</i>, which disembogues itself into the
Macquarie several miles below the junction of the Turon. This
place has lately taken an important position among the diggings
for richness and extent, and bids fair to retain it. The diggings
are situated chiefly on tableland, and the yield of gold, when
the weather allows of operations being carried on, is very large.
Many of the claims yield from two to twelve ounces a day. The
gold is coarse, and lies at various depths from the surface. At
Golden Gully, and at the Bald Hill also, the diggings are very
prolific, and to all appearance an extensive region teeming with
golden wealth lies around. Although mining operations are very
much impeded by the frequent rains, which convert the tableland
into a swamp, yet it is feared that in dry seasons these diggings
will be unworkable for want of water. The number of miners at
work at the Tambaroura and the vicinity is probably about
1,000.<br>
<br>
The <i>Hanging Rock</i> may be regarded as among the number of
those gold fields whose richness has been established. It is
situated at the River Peel in New England. The Oakenville,
Hurdle, and Oakey Creeks, flowing into the Peel, have been found
to be rich in auriferous deposits, and a large tract of country
in the vicinity presents the same indications. The number of
diggers at the Hanging Rock is about 200, who are doing
exceedingly well. As much as twenty ounces per diem have been
obtained here, and dry diggings have been discovered which
promise to be exceedingly rich. Although the richness of the
Hanging Rock diggings has been established, the extent and
probable productiveness are still matter of doubt.<br>
<br>
These northern diggings are fifty miles from the Page River; the
nearest road by Aberdeen, between Muswell Brook and Scone. From
Goonoo Goonoo, the head station of the Australian Agricultural
Company is about twenty-seven miles. The whole of the country is
extremely hilly, and in wet weather the numerous creeks present
an impassable barrier to the traveller.<br>
<br>
The direct approach to the Hanging Rock is over a series of most
difficult precipitous ascents, but there is a bridle path. The
Hanging Rock is a prodigious mountain, the sides of which are
overhung with huge masses of rock, which seem on the point of
being precipitated into the yawning gullies beneath. The herbage
is scant, affording but a bare subsistence for the horses and
cattle. Descending over the ridge which shadows what is called
the Rock, you arrive at the "Hanging Rock Creek," and the "Swamp
Diggings." All these are liable to interruption in the wet
season.<br>
<br>
The bed of the creek is composed of a very compact mass,
interspersed with quartz. The banks are chiefly a black, thick
loam, intermixed with red, ferruginous clay. The richest claims
are where the quartz ridges dip down into the creek.<br>
<br>
The <i>Dry Diggings</i> are in one of many deep gullies which
prevail in this region.<br>
<br>
<i>Oakenville Creek</i> is in this (the rainy) season a narrow,
rapid rush of water down the bed of a deep, precipitous, rocky
gully.<br>
<br>
<i>The Peel River Diggings</i>.&mdash;The Peel River diggings are
divided into two classes. The field on the western side of the
river belongs to the Australian Agricultural Company, whose
stations extend seventy or eighty miles along the banks of this
stream. The gold-field is situated about five miles from Hanging
Rock, and was discovered in March, 1853. The company, in the
first instance, endeavoured to raise a revenue by issuing
licences, but as only thirty-six were taken, while more than one
hundred and fifty were at work, the deputy-governor adopted means
for driving off all trespassers, and at length succeeded. The
gold is found on the banks of the river in thick ferruginous
clay; in some instances nuggets are found clinging to the roots
of the grass. The greatest wealth is supposed to exist in the
quartz ridges. The reporter found several lumps the size of a
duck's egg, thickly speckled with gold.<br>
<br>
The river diggings on the crown side are principally three
spots:&mdash;Golden Point, Blackfellow's Gully, and Bold
Ridge.<br>
<br>
Of the remaining gold-fields, which are so only by anticipation,
their riches not having been developed, and but little being
known of their extent, the Abercrombie is one of the longest
known, and probably one of the most important. Gold has been
found in considerable quantities, not only in the river itself at
the Sounding Rock, or Tarshish diggings, but also on its
tributary creeks, the Tuena, Mulgunnia, Copperhannia, and
Mountain Run. The Abercrombie lies some forty miles to the
southward of Bathurst, and forms the upper portion of the Lachlan
River. Dry diggings abound on some of the creeks&mdash;the Tuena
especially&mdash;and large earnings have been made here. The gold
is coarse. The field may be regarded as unexplored, as there are
not more than 200 persons at work on it.<br>
<br>
North of the Abercrombie lie the diggings at Campbell's River
called Havilah, and those on the Gilmandyke and Davis Creeks, its
tributaries. Gold was found at Havilah shortly after the
discovery of the Turon diggings; but as the yield was small, the
latter soon drew away the enterprising pioneers at Campbell's
River. The gold procured was very fine, but no locality has yet
been discovered where the deposits are so plentiful as to entitle
these diggings to consideration. On the Gilmandyke and Davis
Creeks coarse gold is obtained, and there are promising
indications of future richness. Perhaps about 100 miners are
engaged at these diggings, who are making fair earnings.<br>
<br>
There is about the same number of persons engaged in digging on
Winburndale Creek, which rises on the tableland a few miles to
the northward of Bathurst, and, flowing in a north-west
direction, falls into the Macquarie several miles above the
junction of the Turon. No very sanguine anticipations are
entertained as to the productiveness of these diggings, where,
however, fair wages are made by the few persons engaged at them.
It is far otherwise, however, with the regions adjacent to the
Macquarie River. Gold has for a long time been found on this
river, but the diggings hitherto opened have been isolated. Late
researches, however, have brought to light auriferous deposits,
where the depth of washing-soil is ten and even fifteen feet, and
these extend for miles along the banks of the river. The
capabilities of such a gold-field may be guessed at where the
supply promises to be almost inexhaustible. Only in dry weather,
however, can these be turned to account, as the river is a large
and important stream during the greater part of the year, and
from the prevalence of water the claims cannot be worked. The
Macquarie receives the tributary waters of the Winburndale, the
Turon, Summerhill, Tambaroura, Pyramul, &amp;c., all auriferous
streams.<br>
<br>
An extensive gold-field has been discovered at the Billabong
range, which lies nearly a hundred miles to the west of Bathurst,
between the waters of the Lachlan and Bogan. Schists and quartz
are the constituent rocks, and specimens of gold in the matrix
have been found. At the Snowy Mountains, to the southward, where
many of the great streams of the colony, the Murrumbidgee,
Murray, Snowy River, &amp;c., take their rise, the researches of
the Rev. W. B. Clarke, who was specially appointed by the
Government to survey this district, have disclosed an extensive
tract of auriferous country, and several localities which promise
to be highly productive. The severity of the weather in these
Alpine regions will, however, preclude mining operations being
carried on for several months in the year. Over both these
extensive portions of country the utmost done in gold-digging are
isolated efforts of a few prospecting parties, who are merely
testing the capabilities of the country. In these alone a vast
field for enterprise lies open to the world.<br>
<br>
The last-discovered diggings in this colony, which have excited
the most sanguine expectations of their future productions, are
Bingara, situated on the Courangoura Creek, which joins the
Gwydir, seventy miles to the north-west of Tarn worth. The
diggers who first discovered the treasures of this locality made
extraordinary gains in a short time, and the gold appeared to lie
in such abundance on all sides, as to be inexhaustible. The gold
obtained has consisted chiefly of nuggets and coarse grain, very
little worn. Nuggets weighing fourteen and sixteen ounces have
been obtained. Upon the intelligence of the success of these
diggings a large number of persons started for them, and at
present we dare say there are 300 on the ground. The diggings at
present opened are situated on tableland, and it is feared that
there will not be a sufficiency of water even in moderately dry
seasons. The usual characteristics of a gold region, slate and
quartz, abound; and a large extent of country in the vicinity has
the same external appearance as that at the diggings at the
Courangoura Creek. The country is very level, resembling the
gold-fields of Victoria, and the samples of precious metal
obtained resemble those of Mount Alexander in the coarseness of
the grains and their rich appearance. At various places, between
the Hanging Rock and Bingara, gold has been found in some
instances lying on the surface of the ground. The distance of
this gold-field from Maitland is upwards of 200 miles in a north
by west direction. A considerable quantity of gold has been
received from it, and at present there is a large quantity in the
hands of the miners.<br>
<br>
According to the estimated number of diggers which we have stated
as engaged in each locality, the total number at the places
particularised is about 6,000. As there are numerous creeks and
gullies throughout the country where miners are at work, but
which are either too unimportant to be named such as the Jew's
Creek, the Crudine, &amp;c.&mdash;or are altogether unknown, a
considerable addition must be made to this number. If we add
2,000 more to the 6,000, it will include all these detached
miners, and any possible deficiency in our estimate of the number
of diggers at the established gold-fields. The total number of
persons engaged in gold-digging in this colony will then be about
8,000.<br>
<br>
Hitherto a pick and shovel and a cradle, with probably the
addition of a crowbar and pump, have constituted a miner's
outfit. At the diggings of Victoria, indeed, thousands of the
more successful miners never use a cradle, the richness of their
claims in large gold preventing the necessity; but at the Turon
and other places, the fineness of the gold dust, and the manner
in which it is diffused throughout the soil, have necessitated
the utmost skill and care in cradling. Lately, however, companies
have been formed in this colony for the more effectual
development of the wealth of the gold-fields. About half-a-dozen
of these companies have commenced operations. The Great Nugget
Vein Company are setting up expensive machinery on the banks of
the Louisa for crushing the auriferous quartz of their claim at
that locality. The Turon Golden Ridge Quartz Crushing Company are
making active preparations for developing the richness of an
auriferous quartz vein on the Lower Turon, which promises the
most splendid results. The Messrs. Samuel are proceeding with
their exertions to drain the waterhole at Ophir. The Australian
Mutual and the British Australian Gold Mining Companies have
combined operations, for the purpose of working the alluvial
claims on the Turon. They have secured ground at Lucky Point, and
have made considerable progress towards developing the golden
deposits of an island in the bed of the Turon contiguous to
Erskine Point.<br>
<br>
Gold has been found throughout more than eight degrees of
latitude, from Bingara at the north to the ranges near Cape
Otway, in Victoria. There is good reason for believing that it
exists throughout twelve degrees, as samples of the precious
metal were found by the late Mr. Roderick Mitchell, son of the
surveyor-general, as far north as Mount Abundance at the Fitzroy
Downs. The easternmost diggings in Australia yet discovered are
those at the Hanging Rock, about the 151 of E. long. A gold-field
has been discovered in South Australia, in about the 139
longitude, twelve degrees to the westward; but whether gold will
be found throughout the intervening country it is impossible to
say. It has certainly been found as far westward, in Victoria, as
the 143rd meridian, and at Mount Cole and Mount William.<br>
<br>
On Thursday, 2nd September, I joined a gentleman of Murrurundi,
whose business required his attention here, and travelled over
the almost trackless ranges to the Isis, one of the rivulets
which runs into the Hunter. Towards evening we reached the
hospitable abode of a venerable Highlander, who here, high above
all other human habitations, at the foot of the Liverpool range,
aided by his stalwart sons, tends his numerous and thriving
flocks.<br>
<br>
The next morning they directed our steps to a remarkable cave,
the front apartment of which is adorned with stalactites, in the
form of pillars and curtains. The entrance being turned upwards,
is altogether hidden from most passers by; but when a descent has
been accomplished over the broken rocks, the main arch of the
cavern has a fine appearance. To this cave the worthy and
patriotic Highlander has given the name 'Uamh Garrie,' Garry's
Cave, from its resemblance to a cave of that name in the
Highlands of Scotland.<br>
<br>
There is a larger cave lower down the stream, which we had not
time to visit, but which some travellers have said will surely
become an object of great interest, as soon as better modes of
travelling are afforded to the inhabitants of our towns and
cities.<br>
<br>
On leaving the Isis, we ascended the Liverpool
Range&mdash;crossing, at various elevations, on both sides of the
range, tablelands of the most promising soil; where several
thousands of agriculturalists are likely to find a highly
remunerative field for their industry and skill as soon as
markets for the gold-finding population of the neighbourhood, and
means of transit to distant towns, make their settlement
practicable. In the afternoon, soon after crossing the Peel, we
came in sight of the perpendicular facing of rock which gives a
peculiar appearance and a name to this mountain. The ascent to
this flat, near the summit, is a steep one of at least three
miles; did we not see the tracks, we could not believe it
possible for drays to be brought up it by any means. As the
golden creek runs in all directions from the top, and the
precious metal is found at all heights, there is no regular camp
of tents here as at the Turon and other places; the people are
thinly scattered over a wide space, and hidden from one another
by the ridges. Never, perhaps, did men pursue their daily toil in
such delightful and beautiful workshops as these ravines, where
the dark foliage of the oak, the rugged and fantastic piles of
rock, and the numerous cascades, combine to form pleasant
pictures. Among the diggers it is easy to discover many a
thorough gentleman, and many a worthy farmer, artisan, and
sailor.</blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX.</h3>
<h4>GOLD FIELDS OF VICTORIA.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> opening up of the gold fields of
Victoria followed quick, and soon eclipsed the river claims and
dry diggings of the older colony.</p>
<p>Gold was sold in small quantities to a jeweller of the name of
Brentano, in 1848, which was found on the banks of the river
Loddon, at the foot of the Climes Hill, which is supposed to be
of volcanic origin, and rises from a plane.</p>
<p>In August, 1851, after a reward had been offered for the
discovery of gold in the Port Phillip district, the diggings were
opened at the Climes, whence a piece of two pounds of fine grain
gold was sold. Afterwards they were successfully opened at
Buninyong, a deep gorge formed by the bed of Anderson's Creek, in
the heart of stringy bark ranges.</p>
<p>The weather was unfavourable, and the first attempt to levy
licence fees at the Climes created discontent. A different spirit
from that at the Turon was displayed; the people struck their
tents and retreated further into the ranges; this led to the
discovery of Ballarat.</p>
<p>The commissioner having acted with great discretion, taken
pains to conciliate, and applied his mechanical talent to
constructing a better cradle, an improved feeling was
created.</p>
<p>In September the returns were better more nuggets one man
getting eight ounces in a week. Success soon brought two hundred
up; and, the weather clearing, gold gathering became one of the
trades of Victoria, and licence fees, being found a protection,
were paid willingly. Diggers combined to preserve order, held
meetings, and settled all disputed points.</p>
<p>At Clunes the rock was mined&mdash;at Ballarat the soil only
was washed.</p>
<p>In October the government escort was established, and large
returns were raised daily. By the middle of the month ten
thousand men were at work with 1,200 to 1,300 cradles at
Ballarat. The estimated daily earnings were £10,000, very
unequally distributed.</p>
<br>

src="1400441h-images/Image36.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>GOLD ESCORT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>In the same month a public meeting of the Ballarat diggers was
held, to adopt measures for securing a supply of water during the
coming dry season, and a subscription of one shilling a head was
commenced for the purpose of damming up the waters of the creek;
the commissioner of crown lands was elected treasurer, and any
surplus was to go towards an hospital for the sick diggers.</p>
<p>In September the gold was found in such quantities round Mount
Alexander, the Mount Byng of Mitchell, as to attract large
numbers from Ballarat. At Mount Alexander gold was taken up with
pocket-knives from soil a few inches below the surface in such
profusion, that one man filled a quart pot with small nuggets in
the course of the day. A rush took place from all the other
diggings to the last-found region, and in a very few days there
were eight thousand at work.</p>
<p>In November three tons of gold lay at the commissioner's tent
at Forest Creek waiting for an escort, and not less than
twenty-five thousand persons were working at the spot.</p>
<p>On December 1st government issued a notice raising the licence
fee to £3 a month; but this move met so much resistance that it
was almost immediately rescinded.</p>
<p>The dry weather setting in, the diggers in the course of
January were reduced to 10,000 persons.</p>
<p>In January the new Legislative Council came to a series of
resolutions adverse to the licensing system, and suggesting an
export duty.</p>
<p>In the same month a working man found at the Forest Creek
diggings the largest lump of solid gold yet discovered, weighing
27 lbs. 8 oz., perfectly pure, free from quartz or other
impurity, which he sold to a Melbourne dealer.</p>
<p>In May, 1852, the numbers at Mount Alexander were estimated at
from thirty to forty thousand souls.</p>
<p>Since that period the gold-fields round Mount Ballarat have
been almost deserted, except by residents in the locality.</p>
<h5>A TANDEM DRIVE FROM MELBOURNE TO BALLARAT, IN 1851.</h5>
<p>"Having cleared the city we overtook the golden army of
bullock-drays moving northward, surrounded by companies of men
and lads: occasionally a female is seen. Four bulldogs pull one
carriage, a great dog in the shafts of another, and a man pushing
behind at a load of near five hundredweight.</p>
<p>"Presently the splendid panorama opened to view an extensive
sweep of plains, encircled by mountain ranges in the remote
distance. Far as the eye can reach, the pilgrimage, its line
moving along the undulations, now hid, now rising into view
English and Germans, Irish and Scotch, Tasmanians.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"Sixteen drays at Yuille's Ford, and nearly two hundred
people. It is nearly impassable, from the fresh current of
yesterday's rain. But the men, tailing on to the ropes by dozens,
pull both the horses and carts through. Some there are pulling,
some cooking their midday meals, some unloading the drays, some
moving off the ground. Over the ford the road is delightful, the
scenery charming, the land more broken, and timbered like a park.
Ladidak comes in view, a beautiful ravine formed by the
convergence of several hills, at the base of which the river so
winds that it must be crossed thrice.</p>
<p>"Where formerly was silence, only broken by the voice of the
bellbird, now bullock-drays, bullocks, and bullock-drivers, are
shouting, roaring, and swearing up the hill, or descending
splashing through the once clear stream. On, on until the expanse
of Bacchus Marsh opens, until lately a favourite meet of our
hounds.</p>
<p>"A camp of tents has been formed by those who think it
discreet to put off the crossing struggle until their beasts have
had the benefit of a night's rest; loud is the ringing of
bullock-bells; meanwhile an impromptu bridge of a tree has been
thrown across the river, and men are crossing and recrossing like
a stream of ants. A dray deep in the stream makes a complete
capsize before it can be hauled through.</p>
<p>"Our tandem dog-cart dashes through gallantly, we reach the
Pentland Hills, where another encampment has been formed in the
long ravine; we trot on slowly, the moon bright, the sky
cloudless, a sharp frost nips the uplands, the campers eating,
drinking, and smoking; architects, jewellers, chemists,
booksellers, tinker, tailor, and sailor, all cold but cheerful.
At the next station we halt and enjoy our friend's fire and
supper.</p>
<p>"The next morning broke bright and fresh; the ground was white
with frost; at daylight the train of pilgrims were crossing the
plain&mdash;the Germans with wheelbarrows led the way. At Ballan
we find the inn eaten out. A horse passes at speed bearing on his
back two horsemen. We meet sulky parties of the unsuccessful
returning, and see signs in small excavations of prospecting
parties. The forest grows denser; toward evening we reach the
hospitable roof-tree of Lal Lal, where at daybreak all the
laughing jackasses of the country seemed to have established a
representative assembly. Ha, ha, ha! ho, ho, ho! hu, hu, hu! ring
forth in every variety of key innumerous.</p>

<br>
<small>LAUGHING JACKASS.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"The cavalcade in motion splashes through the broad river,
where one driver, in his shirt, without breeches, walks beside
and urges on his horses, fearful of his dray sticking on the way.
Our next point is Warren Neep, where we refresh with a draught
from the delicious mineral spring. Two miles from Warren Neep the
hills begin gradually to slope toward Ballarat. The forest trees
are loftier and denser, but the surface soil is not so richly
grassed. The road emerges on to a rich bottom of considerable
extent, and the hill to the left extends upwards in such a gentle
slope as to diminish the appearance of its height. Within a mile
and a half of Golden Point the tents begin to peer through the
trees. The Black Hill rises precipitously on the right from a
creek that washes its base, and through its thick forest covering
the road is visible down which the carriers are conveying their
earth.</p>
<p>"The bank of the creek is lined with cradles, and the washers
are in full operation. Round the base of the mountain, on the
further side, at right angles with this creek, the River Lee
flows; and for half a mile along its bank the cradles are at
work. We descend, leave the road, cross the bottom, spring over a
dam, and are among the workmen. 'Rock, rock, rock! swish, swash,
swish!'&mdash;such the universal sound.</p>
<p>"The cradle is placed lengthwise with the water. The
<i>cradleman</i>, holding the handle in his left hand, with a
stick or scraper to break the lumps of earth or stir up the
contents, keeps the cradle constantly going. The <i>waterman</i>,
standing at the head of the cradle with a ladle of any kind,
keeps baling water continuously into it. A third man washes
carefully into a large tin dish the deposit that has fallen
through the sieves of the cradle on to the boards beneath,
carries it into the stream, where he stands knee-deep, and,
tilting the dish up under the water, and shaking its contents,
the precious metal falls to the bottom, while the earth and sand
are washed out by the water.</p>
<p>"After long washing the glittering dust is seen along the
bottom edges of the dish. This residuum is carefully washed into
a pannikin, dried over the fire, and bottled or packed for
exportation. Meanwhile the 'cradleman' and 'waterman' examine the
quartz stones in the upper sieve for quartz gold. Occasionally
some are found with pieces of quartz adhering, the rest are
thrown aside. The cradle filled, the men are at work again, and
the rocking recommences. On the top of the hill the diggers are
hard at work; the carriers descend the steep side, dragging a
loaded sled filled with the gold-impregnated earth, some with tin
vessels on their heads, others with bags on their backs. The
earth thrown down, they reascend the toilsome way; and this is
the process 'from morn till dewy eve.'</p>
<p>"Returning to the road, the outer encampment this side of
Golden Point became visible. A sound is heard like the continuous
beat of a thousand muffled drums, or the rushing of a mighty
waterfall. As we issue from the trees the cause is beheld. From
the margin of the forest a broad swamp spreads, through which the
Lee runs. Over against you the broad shoulder of a bold hill is
pushed out to meet its attacking waters, and round its base run
the swamp waters, uniting with the river. Along this the cradles
are ranged for about half a mile, on both sides of the creek and
down the river, forming the letter T with the ends upturned. They
are crowded so closely together as barely to permit being worked,
in some places in triple file. At this distance you see some of
the excavations, and the carriers swarming up and down hill with
all sorts of vessels, from the bag to the wheelbarrow. The
enormous ant-hive swarms like a railway cutting, where the crown
of a hill is carried down to fill a valley.</p>
<br>

src="1400441h-images/Image38.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>CHILDREN CRADLING.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"Higher up the hill's crest, along its sides, and stretching
down to the swamp far away to the right and left, are the tents,
thickly clustered and pitched, and, far beyond, the lofty
white-barked trees form a background. This is Ballarat!</p>
<p>"Crossing the swamp, we reach the commissioner's tent, where
he is trying a depredator, who, for want of a lock-up, has been
tied to a tree all through the hard night's frost.</p>
<p>"Troops of horses, drays, carts, and gigs, with their owners,
are all around. Squatter, merchant, farmer, shopkeeper, labourer,
shepherd, artisan, law, physic, and divinity, all are here.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;
You meet men you have not seen for years, but they recognise you
first, for even your most intimate friends are scarcely to be
known in the disguise of costume, beard, and dirt.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;
'Welcome to Golden Point!' 'Ah, old friend! hardly knew you. How
are you getting on?' 'Did nothing for a week; tried six holes and
found no gold. My party, disheartened, left me. I formed another
party; sank eighteen feet until we came to the quartz, and dug
through it, and now I have reached the blue clay. It is a capital
hole; come and see it.'</p>
<p>"Imagine a gigantic honeycomb, in which the cells are eight
feet wide and from six to twenty-five feet deep, with the
partitions proportionately thin, and to follow a friend to find a
hole in the very midst is dangerous work&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote" align="center">'Lightly tread, 'tis hollowed
ground.'</p>
<p>"The miners move nimbly about, with barrow, pick, and bag,
swarming along the narrow ledges, while below others are picking,
shovelling, and heating the stove.</p>
<p>"'No danger, sir; our bank is supported by quartz. We've got
to the gold at last. Made an ounce yesterday. There was a man
killed yesterday three holes off; the bank fell down on him as he
was squatting down this way, picking under the bank, and squeezed
him together. His mate had his head cut, and was covered up to
the throat.'</p>
<p>"Down the shady excuse for a ladder, half the way, then a
jump, and the bottom of the capital hole is gained. Nearly four
feet of red sand formed the upper layer, next a strata of
pipeclay, below which lie the quartz boulders; then a formation
of quartz pebbles, with sand impregnated with iron; this
penetrated, the bluish marl is reached in which the vein of gold
is found.</p>
<p>"Down among the men washing there is nothing to be observed.
The work is earnest&mdash;no time for talk.</p>
<p>"The commissioner has a busy time issuing licences. His tent
has the mounted police on one side, and the native police on the
other. The black fellows are busy tailoring; one on the broad of
his back, in the sun, with his eyes shut, chanting a monotonous
aboriginal ditty.</p>
<p>"Three men are waiting their turn with the commissioner.</p>
<p>"'I say, Bill, this here's rayther respectable
okipashun&mdash;that cove with the specs is a first-class swell
in Melbourne, and there's a lot in the same party with him. The
greatest nobs are all the same as uz snobs! I saw Mr.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; from the Barwon here this morning: he found
his shepherd in a hole getting gold, and no mistake! He comes
with his brother to have a turn with the rest; but when he saw
him he looked non-plushed, and said to himself, "Well, I can't go
down to this,"&mdash;and I believe the fool started
back;&mdash;but come, it's our turn now.'</p>
<p>"The evening shadows fall, the gun from the commissioner's
tent is fired&mdash;the signal for digging to cease; the fires
blaze up, the men gather round them for their evening meal, their
smoke floats over the trees as over a city, the sounds of labour
are hushed, but are succeeded by loud voices and ringing
laughter, mingled with the bells of the browsing oxen, and the
dogs baying more loudly as the darkness grows more dark. A party
of gamblers are staking each a pinch of gold-dust on the turn of
a copper. The native police, lithe and graceful as kangaroo-dogs,
are enjoying a round of sham combat; one black fellow attacks
with a frying-pan; the other pretends to shoot him with his
knife: a painter might study their attitudes. Hark! to the
sax-horns from the Black Hill floating to us across the valley;
close at hand the sweet melody of the German hymn in chorus
rises; and then down from toward the river comes the roaring
chorus of a sailor's song. The space and distance mellow in one
harmonious whole all the sounds; and as we retreat they fall upon
one wearied with hard labour, like the rich hum of an English
meadow in harvest time.</p>
<p>"A flash! a bang! another! now platoon-firing: become
infectious, the sounds of war mingle with and overpower the
music.</p>
<p>"The warm day terminated in a bitter cold night, and a storm
of snow and hail ushered in Sunday&mdash;for we are 1,200 feet
above the sea. On the Sabbath digging and washing gold cease; but
the axe and the hammer ring continually, and the crash of falling
timber booms over the hills. The miners, with what few wives are
there, are building huts, mending tents, gathering firewood, and
washing out their mud-stained garments.</p>
<p>"The men soon assume a clean and more civilised costume, form
groups, compare notes, make calls. The unsuccessful wander off
into remote spots, prospecting. Some start for the post-office.
The tide of emigrants flows in, and men who never before dwelt
out of reach of an inn and a waiter have to learn now to camp
under a tree and cook a chop without a frying-pan."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI.</h3>
<h4>THE DIARIES OF DIGGERS.</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> disappointments in California had
rendered the English public cautious, but the arrival in the port
of London of actual cargoes of gold, and letters from colonists
enriched by digging, presently brought the emigrating public to
fever heat, and thousands of all classes and ages betook
themselves to Australia, and a large re-emigration took place
from South Australia and New South Wales. From the correspondence
and journals of these adventurers&mdash;some of them experienced
colonists we condense accounts of what they saw, omitting much of
what they thought, hoped, feared, and ejaculated.</p>
<h5>PASSAGE.</h5>
<p>"In the first place, take your own passage or berth for
yourself: trust not to any one, not even a brother, for it.
Second, make the bargain that no one is to be in the same berth
with you (that is, if you go in the second cabin or
intermediate.) Bring on board a small barrel for holding water
(not a tin can, on any account), a camp stool for sitting on, a
lock and key for your berth door, and a determination to make a
companion of no one all the voyage, and only seek a speaking
friend after you have been three weeks at sea. It is also
indispensably necessary that every article you possess, except
the wearing apparel on your person, be locked in your trunks and
the keys in your pocket.</p>
<p>"In the accounts of the voyages to Australia you will notice
that much is said about the great heat; but, as far as my
experience goes, too little is said about the extreme cold
weather which is experienced after rounding the Cape of Good
Hope. It is necessary, therefore, to have a suit of very warm
clothing, no matter how coarse it is, but warm it must be. If you
were not teetotalers, I should also advise you to bring with you
two bottles of brandy and the same quantity of whiskey, but that
as your taste inclines.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>
<h5>PORT PHILLIP.</h5>
<p>"The headlands of Port Phillip were reached and entered, the
anchor was thrown overboard, and our vessel from Liverpool, with
175 passengers, had completed the voyage from England to
Australia in eighty-two days.
&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We thought then our troubles were over, but not so. Well, the
anchor is dropped; and the captain, who has been up all night,
hoarse with bawling and swearing, goes down below to sleep. You
go below also to get breakfast, and find that the steward does
not consider himself bound to serve the passengers with clean
cups any longer. On being remonstrated with, his answer will
probably be, 'You may go to the devil.' Well, it is no use
kicking against the pricks; therefore help yourself, and go to
the cookhouse for hot water, and get everything requisite for
breakfast. The talk then begins in the forenoon&mdash;after all
the beauties of the bay have been pointed out over and over
again, until you are absolutely sick of them&mdash;the cry then
is, 'Where is the pilot?' The answer from some one is, 'Oh, all
those ships are to go up the bay before us, and we must wait our
turn. It may be a week before we get up yet.' Day draws on, but
no pilot. Next morning no pilot; still dirty plates, and the
steward grown more insolent. In the afternoon the pilot comes on
board. He says, 'The wind is against us, we may lie here a week.'
All next day the wind is against us, but the following day a
breeze springs up, the sails are spread out to the breeze, a man
is placed in the chains to heave the lead, and off we go. In the
afternoon we reach Hobson's Bay, still a part of Port Phillip,
but a different creek. Well, the anchor is again dropped, the
pilot leaves the ship, and another is added to the 150 ships at
anchor in the bay. We are still eight miles from Melbourne, which
lies on the Yarra Yarra. The cry then is, 'When shall we get
ashore?' 'Oh,' replies one, 'the inspector must come on board
first, and the captain must go on shore to deliver up his papers,
and a lighter or steamer must be engaged to take us up.' Well, in
two days no steamer or lighter appeared: and Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and I went off' with a steamer that was
plying about among the shipping, and paid 5s. each for a sail of
eight miles. We reached Melbourne. We asked where a house was to
be had. The reply was, 'There are no houses to let in Melbourne.'
Lodgings we could have got at 2 each a week, but that we did not
want. All that day we walked through the town searching for a
house, but found none. We returned to the ship, and paid 7s. each
for another sail. We came on shore next day for 2s. 6d., walked
all day, and again failed in our object; but that night we stayed
in an inn on shore, and next morning we had the pleasure of
securing a wooden erection, miscalled a house, of two rooms, at
the moderate rent of £1 per week. Joyfully we returned to the
ship, expecting that a lighter would be alongside to take our
luggage and our wives to the house we had rented; but, alas for
the courtesy and attention of our captain! no such comfort
awaited us. 'It will be here to-morrow,' was his reply when asked
about it. To-morrow came, but no lighter. Passengers got savage;
some swore; some urged that a deputation should be sent to the
agent of the ship, and to the magistrates of Melbourne. This
course was adopted; two gentlemen were deputed to go. They went.
The agent told them he knew nothing about it, and that they had
better get on shore with their luggage as best they could. The
magistrates said, 'Make your case known to a respectable
solicitor, and we will hear it.' Thus were we pushed about from
one to another. One man took his luggage ashore in a boat, at his
own cost, at an expense of £9 sterling. Had I followed his
example it would have cost me as much. I went to the captain; he
assured me the lighter would come in a few days, and, being sick
of the ship, Mary and I, along with a Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
and her daughter, bolted from the ship, and left our luggage to
the care of Providence. We slept two nights in an inn. Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s luggage came at the expiry of that
period in a lighter, and we then got his boxes into one of the
wooden houses previously taken. There we lived for a fortnight.
None of my luggage came ashore all that time. I was in the same
position as the rest of the passengers, and after waiting and
wearying our hopes almost out, we got everything safe and sound
out of the lighter on the 1st of November. That, however, was but
one-half of my troubles. Melbourne was flooded with young men
seeking situations, which were not to be had."</p>
<p>After several unsuccessful applications for employment, and
some other mishaps, the writer continues&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sad, dejected, and weary, we reached Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s house, where we slept all night. Next
day I got up my luggage and took one of P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'s
rooms, dressed myself in my best, went to the Argus office, quite
in a state of desperation, and was civilly received, and offered
at once a situation at £208 per annum."</p>
<h5>LANDING.</h5>
<p align="right"><small>"<span class="a">Melbourne</span>, Nov.
4, 1852.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>
<p>"Here am I at this moment seated on a trunk, with my
writing-desk opened on the top of another trunk, and a blazing
wood fire on the hearth, with the lamp that served us on the
voyage lighted beside me. My wife is seated on my carpet bag,
stuffed with dirty clothes, busily engaged in mending stockings,
which yesterday she washed and dried at the front of the house.
The floor is covered with canvass; the walls are of wood, through
which the light shines when the lamp is extinguished, and the
roof is also covered with pieces of wood instead of good blue
slates. Our mattresses, which served us on the ship&mdash;good
hair ones&mdash;are spread out in one corner of the room. In
another is a load of wood, for which I paid this day the sum of
£1 5s., and my large trunk stands against a partition, with the
lid covered with all my books and papers. The house has two
rooms. Mr. Hutton and his wife stay in one apartment, James Pett
and his wife are living in the other. There, now you have a
picture of our domestic economy; and when I add that both Mary
and I are cheerful and happy in it, I give you full liberty to
enjoy a laugh at what I have the honour to call my first
house.</p>
<p>"The advance of Melbourne, in a commercial point of view, is
surprisingly rapid, and so far her prosperity seems to be based
on a safe monetary foundation. The business part of the city is
crowded each day by an anxious throng, mostly parties preparing
for or returning from the diggings. In one lot you will see the
lately arrived 'new chum,' with his carefully cultivated
moustache, raised on the voyage, <i>a la</i> Bond-street; his
leathern overalls, his fancy stick, and his 'swag' done up in
Mackintosh. In another you may behold the 'old hand,' the wary
old file who has campaigned it at the Turon, at Braidwood, and at
the Mount, and who is now preparing for a trip to Bendigo, but
who declares that there is no use going till the roads are open.
With him there is none of your finery. A pair of stout boots, a
blanket, and the everlasting 'hook-pot,' complete his equipment.
Anon you enter a gold-buyer's shop, and perceive a party
disposing of the proceeds of their adventure. One party of three
that I saw the other day had 145 lbs. weight to dispose of.
Another, a sailor lad, had 28 lbs., the produce of three months'
work at the Bendigo. Such instances are of no rare occurrence; in
short they are rather the rule than the exception.</p>
<p>"I have said much about the immorality of the place; it is but
fair to state that my remarks apply only to a certain class, who
are, as it were, beyond the pale of society, but whose conduct
exercises a pernicious influence upon the whole social system. I
have been to most of the churches on Sabbath, and I was pleased
to find all of them well filled with respectable and attentive
congregations. In one particular the clergy are reaping a golden
harvest from the diggings themselves. I allude to the demand
which there is for their services in that ceremony which binds
the sexes together 'for better for worse' through life. And let
me inform you that a digger's marriage here is no everyday
affair, though they be upon each successive Sunday. The turn-out
on all occasions is spicy. I have seen even the wheels of the
vehicles (six in number) adorned with rosettes of love ribbons;
the jarvey and the horse covered with white so profusely that at
a distance they might pass for a small locomotive pyramid of
snow. And such dresses as are worn by the brides and bridesmaids
such silks,&mdash;such satins, such orange blossoms!</p>
<p>"The city itself, though well laid out, is in the most
wretched condition as regards all sanitary regulations, and as
regards what is still of more immediate consequence to its
inhabitants&mdash;protection for life and property. The rains,
which have not yet ceased for the season, continue to pour down
in incessant torrents, covering all the flat and marshy ground
around the city, and within it it is no exaggeration to say that
the streets are like so many rivers of mud, and in many instances
knee deep. So deep and so dirty are the streets, that one out of
every three pedestrians you meet in the course of the day, has
his nether man encased in a pair of huge leather boots&mdash;no
other way of getting along with safety being available. Add to
the filthy state of the streets the fact that there is no gas in
the town, nor attempt made to light it in any way, and that water
for culinary purposes is so dear as to become an article of
luxury rather than of use, and you will be able to form some
slight idea of the sanitary condition of this city.</p>
<p>"There is not household accommodation for one-third of its
present occupants. I have seen instances of over-crowding in
sleeping apartments since I came here, that were it to occur in
any other country in the world would breed almost instant fever.
It is no rare thing to see twenty stout and stalwart men, each
requiring as much air for the proper inflation of his lungs as an
ox, stretched upon the floor of a close, confined, unventilated
room, night after night; and for this accommodation various
prices are charged, from one-and-sixpence to half-a-crown. Nor in
this respect are what may be termed respectable taverns much
better. I know an instance where four men were sleeping in one
room, in a respectable hotel, and were all thrown into dirty
sheets, handed on the first morning of their sojourn, dirty, nay
filthy towels; and after the lapse of four days I happened to
meet with one of the party, and making inquiry as to whether
there had been any reform in the toilet department&mdash;'No,'
said he, 'the same nasty things are there yet. We asked for a
change, but were told that if we did not like them we might
change our quarters, and so we are just as before.'</p>
<p>"A few evenings since I was at the house of a friend of that
peace-loving class called Quakers, and several other gentlemen
were there besides, when we were all at once startled by a heavy
rap at the door. Our host and 'friend' immediately opened it,
when a herculean savage thrust a great bullet head inside, and in
the most insolent tones demanded either money or a night's
lodging. Friend John expostulated, but, being rather diminutive
in stature, the intruder paid but little attention to him until
he perceived the company, when he retired grumbling and swearing,
'What, though he was a government man, he had as good a right to
summit as any other.' It is generally believed here that the
parties who are the ringleaders, at least, of those vagabonds are
those gentlemen whom Earl Grey so pathetically describes as
bearing favourable comparison with the free emigrants who have
come here."</p>
<h5>THE SUBURBS OF MELBOURNE.</h5>
<p>"In the neighbourhood of the capital of Victoria there are
many pleasant spots, where one given to rambling may spend a
quiet afternoon, and where 'ye manners and ye customs of ye
people' may be learned as clearly as if you mingled in all their
everyday avocations. Amongst the most popular places of resort
are, St. Kilda and Liardet's Beach, both situated on the margin
of the noble bay, nearly opposite William's Town. Although
Melbourne possesses a tolerably fair steam fleet, in the shape of
various tug boats, belonging chiefly to Captain Cole, not one of
these vessels is allowed to ply on Sunday; and hence there is,
upon one day in the week at least, a very great demand for
horse-flesh. The bazaars and livery stables upon a Sunday morning
present a very animated spectacle; for here almost every
masculine biped of the <i>genus homo</i> considers it his
peculiar privilege to mount his horse on Sunday, without, be it
remembered, the smallest reference to the fact as to whether he
can ride or not.</p>
<p>"St. Kilda lies about three miles from Melbourne, on the south
side of the Yarra, and as there is no highway, except the usual
bush ruts after the Prince's Bridge is crossed, the walk or ride,
which you please, is very pleasant. Arrived at the village, you
are somewhat surprised at the appearance of rapid growth which
everything indicates. Houses (wooden, of course) are in course of
construction, some nearly finished, others but commenced; and yet
so eager are the people for house accommodation, that the
shingles are scarcely on the roofs before they are tenanted. At
St. Kilda there is a very fine hotel, at which they charge very
fine prices; but then, in the go-a-head city, as Melbourne is now
called, who cares for a handful of silver? I was much pleased to
observe here a taste more generally diffused for the cultivation
of flowers than is to be found generally about Melbourne.</p>
<p>"The ramble from St. Kilda to Liardet's Beach, by the margin
of the wide and noble bay, a distance of about two miles, is very
agreeable; although, beyond the broad expanse of water, dotted,
nay, closely studded with shipping at anchor, there is nothing to
relieve the dull monotony of the place. At Liardet's, however,
the scene changes, and from the solitude of the shore and your
own reflections, you are once more aroused by the din of human
voices. Here they are again&mdash;shopkeepers, shopmen, diggers,
ladies, diggers' wives, horses, hackney carriages, shandies,
gigs, and almost every possible, and sometimes very questionable
modes of conveyance, all congregated on the sand. Pedestrians
wandering, promenading, flirting, drinking, laughing, talking, on
the pier and in the shade of the cool verandahs; pic-nics in the
scrub; mirth and merriment everywhere; boatmen lustily bawling
for passengers, and waiters for more drink at the bar of the
hotel. Tents are pitched upon all the ground surrounding this
house of entertainment, wherein many a new chum for the first
time indulges in a glass of ale, and when he has paid sixpence,
declares that it is not half so good as Burton or Alton.'</p>
<p>"A good deal of novelty is added to this scene by the constant
transit to and from a large ship, the <i>Duke of Bedford</i>,
which is here moored off the pier, and turned into a model
lodging-house. 'Bed and board, sir,' said our conductors on
board, the other day, 'for two pounds a week; delightful marine
residence and boatage found into the bargain.' Decidedly the
accommodations are excellent, and the worthy proprietor keeps a
good table. His apartments are full. It would be well if a few
more of the dozens upon dozens of idle ships lying in harbour
were turned to an equally useful and profitable account to their
owners. I was a good deal surprised to find, amidst all the
recreations of all classes and all kinds who visit the beach upon
Sunday, so little riot or intoxication. Except upon the arrival
of a lot of 'new chums,' with more money than sense, you will
hardly observe any riot or drunkenness. Noise there is, but still
there is order.</p>
<p>"The road from the beach to town lies through a low marshy
scrub, which presents not one single pleasing feature, except we
diverge at the Emerald Hill and take a look in at the encampment
of the tents of gold-diggers <i>in transitu</i> to the Mount or
elsewhere. There are the coverings erected by poor new-comers to
shelter them from the heavens, and to make a temporary but safe
refuge for themselves, their luggage, and their families. And,
oh! such squalor, such misery. It is pitiable to see well-dressed
and genteelly-reared females, young and tender infants, as well
as grown-up persons, crouching and squatting in miserable
wigwams, of which a North-American Indian would be ashamed. But
what can the creatures do?</p>
<p>"The botanic garden is another favourite resort for the
Melbournites upon Sunday; but its visitors are of a different
class. This is the ground where half the 'matches' which grace
our churches daily are contracted. Here it is that newly-married
husbands display their brides during the honeymoon. Such a blaze
of silk and satin, such bonnets, such feathers, flowers
(artificial, of course), and such ribbons! I was particularly
struck with the freshness and beauty of many of the charming
belles who frequent the gardens, contrasting strongly with the
general sallow and somewhat acclimatised style of female beauty
prevalent about Sydney. They are generally handsome, and fresh in
colour.</p>
<p>"The charges to which poor confiding passengers are subjected
to before landing here from the bay are monstrous. These people
take their passage at Liverpool or London on the faith that
themselves and luggage will be delivered at Melbourne the same as
at Sydney; but guess their astonishment when they find that they
have 4s. each to pay for steam-boat fare up, and 30s. per ton for
their luggage; and when they get on the wharf, there are other
dues which, as the wharves belong to private individuals, are
fixed at such rates as their honours please.</p>
<p>"When the <i>Lady Head</i> arrived here from Liverpool the
weather was most inclement&mdash;wet pouring down in bucketfuls,
and the dirt, slop, and mud more than knee-deep, not only in the
thoroughfares, but in every spot where it was possible for human
beings to set foot. In this state of affairs I saw more than 400
poor people thrust upon our wharves, without food or shelter, but
what their scanty bedding supplied. In this state of affairs, Mr.
Cole allowed the poor sufferers the use of the sheds on his
wharf. Happening to be there in the early part of the night, I
ascertained that a young woman, the wife of an intelligent
Scotchman, gave birth to her first-born child.</p>
<p>"The public buildings of Melbourne are of a most inferior
description, both in point of architectural style and internal
accommodation. The only building of note at all adequate to its
requirements is the Mechanics' Institution; and it has now to do
the treble duty of concert hall, assembly room, and town hall,
including offices, &amp;c., for the town clerk. The library
attached to the institution is very good indeed, and the rooms
spacious and commodious. The Legislative Council sits now in St.
Patrick's Hall."</p>
<h5>DIARY OF A JOURNEY FROM MELBOURNE TO BENDIGO.</h5>
<p>"<i>Sep</i>. 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left the camp, passed through
Flemington, about three miles out of Melbourne; roads in a
dreadful state. Hundreds going to and returning from the
diggings. Met several of those who came down in the
<i>Waratah</i> with us, who had been up at the diggings, and had
returned already, having 'ta'en a scunner' at it, as they say in
Scotland. A most beautiful country, as green as emerald, hills
richly sloping, and clotted with umbrageous trees. The country,
from the appearance of the soil and formation of the hills,
appears to be admirably adapted for the cultivation of the vine.
The mimosa, which is a much handsomer tree here than in New South
Wales, being large and shady, appears scattered through the
forest, and lacing now in full bloom, presents to the view a
perfect mass of beautiful golden flowers. Travelled to-day only
five miles, the roads being ankle-deep.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>A SHEPHERD'S HUT.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our horses strayed away during the night,
and we did not find them until mid-day. Just after starting it
commenced to rain slightly. Crossing Keila Plains the roads were
awfully bad, and to add to our ills the rain poured down in
regular torrents. Had our horses not have been first-rate ones we
must inevitably have stuck fast, as during the whole day they had
heavy pulling, men on foot being unable to walk the road without
sinking knee-deep. We had two horses in the cart, and had about
12 cwt. on it. Notwithstanding the plight in which we were, we
could not but admire the scenery, which was beautifully
varied&mdash;now broad, undulating meadows&mdash;now groves of
shea-oaks, eucalyptus, and mimosa; while the grass everywhere was
green and soft as silk. Crossed the Broad Meadow, and came to the
foot of Gellibrand's Hill. Several drays were at the bottom of
this, trying to get up, but it was with the greatest difficulty
that they reached the summit, five or six bullocks falling down
at a time through the slipperiness of the road. Ascended it
without much difficulty, and encamped on the top of it. Travelled
seven miles.</p>
<p>"10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Roads worse than on either of the previous
days, the ground being quite rotten and swampy. Country
resembling parts of Liverpool Plains; timber principally box. In
the evening a suspicious looking character came to the camp,
having no boots or hat on, telling us that he had been robbed,
and threatening vengeance on the thief. Our clothes-box being in
the cart, C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; wanted to have it brought into
the tent, as our fortune he said was in it, upon which some wit
in the camp replied that it was a <i>ragged</i> one. The fellow,
however, who appeared to be a shepherd for some one in the
vicinity, after staying some time, and using some ferocious
language in reference to his spoliator, departed quietly, but not
before we had given him several hints that his room was more
acceptable than his company. Eight miles.</p>
<p>"11<i>th</i>.&mdash;When at breakfast this morning, a large
brown snake came out of the log that was burning, and went into a
pool of water close by. Those who doubt the fact of a snake's
having legs might have been convinced of it by seeing this one,
as the legs were distinctly visible after they had been swollen
by the heat, and much resembled those of a caterpillar, only they
were much larger. Roads very swampy. Kept along the Deep Creek
for a considerable part of the day, Mount Macedon being in sight
on our left hand. Much of the scenery very picturesque,
especially on the Deep Creek, the trees consisting of
honeysuckle, cherry-tree, mimosa, eucalyptus, &amp;c. There is a
species of thorny mimosa growing here, which I have never seen in
New South Wales, and the foliage of which is very pretty. Came to
the Rocky Waterholes' Plain, where we met a bullock driver, who
informed us that gold had been found within a few miles on a
station belonging to Mr. Rigg. We determined upon inspecting the
new gold-field, and leaving the others with the cart, three of us
started in search of it. After going about half a mile, we came
to Rigg's house, when we were directed to the diggings, about a
quarter of a mile distant. When we got there, there were about a
dozen men, two of whom only were at work; the rest having come,
like ourselves, to see the place. The two men who had discovered
the gold informed us that they had been working there about a
fortnight&mdash;no one knowing it until the day before. They had
sunk several holes on the top of a pretty high hill&mdash;the
gullies as yet being too wet to allow of a hole to be sunk in
them. From what we could learn from themselves, and from washing
several tin dishfuls of earth taken from the bottom of the holes
which they had sunk, it did not appear to us that much could be
done in that spot, although it seems very probable that a rich
gold-field will be discovered somewhere in the neighbourhood.
About four feet below the surface there was a vein of quartz,
which was extraordinarily rich in ore. Every stone that we broke
was dotted with minute specks of gold. One of the men showed us a
piece that he had obtained from one of the holes, about the size
of a pea. The soil through which they sunk was decomposed slate,
resting on a bed of pipeclay. The appearance of the country
around is very picturesque, particularly near the banks of the
Deep Creek gently sloping hills, dotted with umbrageous
gum-trees, and covered with a thick sward of grass as green as
emerald. Went back to our mates, intending to proceed about half
a mile further before we pitched our tent. Crossing a flat, we
were obliged to divide the load into two; but notwithstanding
this, we got bogged, and were obliged to unload and take the
horses out. Camped on Rigg's station. Five miles. The mosquitoes
very troublesome, which one would not expect at this time of the
year.</p>
<p>"12<i>th</i> (Sunday).&mdash;Stayed at encampment. Some went
out to inspect the new diggings, and returned bringing with them
several pieces of quartz full of specks of gold. The majority,
notwithstanding, determined on proceeding to Bendigo, in
preference to stopping to give the place a trial. Four men
encamped with us this night, who reported a fight about a claim
at the diggings, in which two or three men were killed, and
several wounded. They told us also that a nugget of pure gold,
weighing upwards of 28 lbs., had been found at Eagle Hawk Gully,
Bendigo. The Deep Creek, on which the new diggings are situated,
runs eastward. If, therefore, gold in abundance be found there,
it will be somewhat in contradiction to geological theories. The
distance is twenty-five miles from Melbourne.</p>
<p>"13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Very bad roads again. Country undulating
and more thickly timbered; box and stringy-bark ranges. Get
bogged, and take the horses out. Ascended Pretty Sally's or the
Big Hill. The soil excellent, and cultivation on the very top of
the mountain. The road which we came and that to Sydney meet on
the top of this hill. Magnificent view from the top of the
hill&mdash;open plains, wood-crowned heights, shady valleys, and
towering hills&mdash;'places which pale passion loves' the view
extending on one side to the sea coast, and the habitations of
man alone being wanting to make the scenery perfect. Descended
the hill and encamped at the foot of it. Twelve miles. A tall
Highlander who was at a camp close by came down to converse with
some of his countrymen who were with us, and afforded us much
amusement.</p>
<p>"14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Passed through Kilmore; the land very
rich; saw the wife of the man who had obtained the 28 lb. nugget
at Bendigo. She informed us that her husband had sold it for £4
per ounce. About midday it commenced to rain very hard; roads
indescribably bad; got bogged and unloaded, pulled the dray out,
went a few yards and got bogged again; pulled the dray out again,
and camped on the side of a ridge; the ground everywhere, both on
the road and ranges, being perfectly rotten. Up nearly all night
drying our bed-clothes, &amp;c., which had got wet through.
Obliged every night to cut poles and boughs to put under us, the
ground being a regular quagmire. The tinkling of the oxen's
bells, which one hears at every encampment, gives somewhat of an
oriental character to the scene. Six miles.</p>
<p>"15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Crossed Donohoe's Creek; broke one of the
traces in crossing, with fair pulling. If the horses had not been
extraordinarily good they could never have kept on, in the state
in which the roads were. Came to a creek in which there were
several drays stuck&mdash;one with nine horses&mdash;it being
unable to cross. There is scarcely a dray you meet on the road
that is not accompanied with one or two women, oftentimes with
families of children, all bound for or returning from the
diggings. Got bogged in crossing the creek, unloaded, and then
had great difficulty in getting over, as the horses had no
footing, and sank up to the shoulder. The country very beautiful,
compensating in part for the badness of the roads, which were the
worst we had encountered. The hills and valleys were covered with
flowers&mdash;daisies, white and yellow butter-cups, snowdrops,
&amp;c., while the mimosa bloomed along our path, adding fresh
beauty to the scene and fragrancy to the air. Each succeeding
scene only impresses more forcibly on the mind the
appropriateness of the title bestowed upon the country by Sir T.
Mitchell, of 'Australia Felix.' The country is well grassed and
watered, the timber low and branching, without any underwood, and
more beautiful and picturesque than any park. Just before
encamping got bogged the second time, the ground being very
deceiving, the horses sinking to their middle in a place where
you would least expect it. Encamped in a most beautiful and
romantic valley, on the banks of a deep creek, with large
waterholes&mdash;which some fanciful individuals of our party
imagined might be the retreats of the far-famed bunyip.
Honeysuckle, mimosa, and eucalyptus were the most common trees,
and formed beautiful groves. Five miles.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image41" id="Image41"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>GRASS TREES.</small></p>
<br>
<p>"16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Crossed two very bad creeks; met a great
number of drays; crossed box hill and stringy bark ranges; the
latter always dreary-looking. Witnessed some beautiful scenery;
hills rising over hills, covered with grass and shady trees; the
valleys enamelled with flowers. Passed Morrison's station&mdash;a
beautiful place. Ascended the Dividing Range. Granite in large
masses begins to appear; quartz predominates in this to a very
unusual extent, and this fact may probably throw some light on
the richness of the Victoria gold-fields. The rocks are ofttimes
of very peculiar forms, and in remarkable situations; large
masses of tons weight, and quite round, lying on top of one
another; the least effort being sufficient to remove them, and
send them headlong down the mountain. The ranges are very low,
and in fact the whole country is remarkably level; a circumstance
which is contrary to one's preconceived notions of a gold-bearing
region. The roads much better, and lined with diggers homeward
and outward bound. The soil decomposed granite, which appears to
be the only rock in the neighbourhood. The honeysuckle is met
with here much farther from the coast than in Australia Proper,
and grows in all sorts of soil and situations. Crossed Morrison's
Creek, over which there is a bridge, the passage over which is
rather unsafe, in consequence of the late heavy rains. Overtook
two horse teams from Goulburn, which had been four months on the
road, having been detained in crossing the river a week or
fortnight at a time. Splendid views from the axis of the mountain
ranges; sheep and cattle feeding on the wood-crowned hills, and
in the fertile valleys, and forming a charming and enticing
picture of pastoral life. Encamped, having for beds the branches
of the gum wattle, as soft and luxurious as a bed of down.
Fourteen miles.</p>
<p>"17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Crossed scrubby stringy bark ranges; got
bogged, and were obliged to lay logs for twenty or thirty yards
in order to get through roads pretty good except in the gullies,
which were desperately bad; fragmentary quartz in great
abundance, and strong indications of gold; got bogged the second
time near the M'lvor Inn; most beautiful scenery; roads
excellent, and as level as possible for the last three miles of
this day's journey; encamped in the most delightful valley that
the eye of man could behold. Never before did the country seem so
justly to merit the appellation of the 'blest
Australia'&mdash;never before did the mimosa seem to bear such
lovely blossoms, or shed such fragrant odours&mdash;never before
did the air seem so pure, clear, and inspiriting as in that
delicious valley. The herbage soft, green, and luxuriant. Flowers
of all hues, white, and purple, and crimson, and gold, and
violet, in which those of a golden colour predominated, enamelled
the hills and valleys, grateful alike to the sight and smell.
Buttercups, dandelions, eglantine, daisies, snowdrops, &amp;c.,
completely covered the ground; the first-mentioned, in
particular, growing as richly as possible over acres, nay, miles
of ground. The trees are principally mimosa and honeysuckle, and
here and there some giant of the eucalyptus order grew in
handsome clumps, some in full blossom, others without any, but
not the less beautiful; while between them were green open
spaces, on which the sun poured down a flood of light. To
complete the scene the M'Ivor meandered through the valley, each
winding-turn disclosing 'some fresher beauties varying round.'
Travelled to-day eleven miles.</p>
<p>"18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled along the course of the M'Ivor
for eleven miles. The scenery equal, if not superior, to that of
yesterday. Even those who are usually unmindful of natural
beauties were unable to gaze on the landscape without giving vent
to passionate exclamations of admiration; English, Irish, and
Scotch, all concurred in agreeing that they had never before seen
anything so beautiful. To add to our pleasure the roads were
excellent, and as level as a bowling-green. The formation of the
country is principally schistose, with an abundance of
fragmentary quartz. Crossed the M'Ivor, and came on to box flats,
in which swamp oak appeared for the first time. Scrubby ranges,
box, and stringy bark; coarse grass and herbs like those at the
Turon; country more level than at the Turon. From the geological
structure and general appearance I should imagine that gold would
be found somewhere in the neighbourhood in abundance. Roads very
bad again. Crossed a box flat entirely consisting of hillocks
having the appearance of waves, and very uniform in their size.
It seems as if the land had been thrown up in a fused and
slightly agitated mass, and then suddenly cooled. Came to the
Campaspie River, and had a fresh view of the celebrated Mount
Alexander; romantic scenery, great abundance of trap rock. When
we got here, we were told we could not cross, as the river was
up. About forty drays were encamped on the banks, waiting the
first opportunity to pass over; we accordingly pitched our tent
on the bank of the river, intending to cross over on Monday
morning, the stream being then considerably swollen and running
rapidly. To-day eighteen miles.</p>
<p>"19<i>th</i> (Sunday).&mdash;Remained in camp. An immense
number of people, on foot and on horseback, crossed the Campaspie
to-day, on their way to and from the diggings, The river fell
considerably during the day and previous night. About sunset the
sky became overcast with heavy clouds, threatening immediate
rain, and therefore we thought it advisable to cross the river at
once, as it was probable we should be detained on its banks a
week or two if it should happen to rain. Packed up accordingly,
and started to cross over, one of the party riding the leading
horse. When about half way over, the leader laid down, which
circumstance was nearly causing an unlucky termination to our
passage; fortunately, however, she rose again, and we crossed
without further trouble, although the water was above the bed of
the cart, and running with a strong current. It was lucky for us
that we did cross, as it rained hard during the night.</p>
<p>"20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Raining hard during the forenoon, but fine
in the afternoon. Passed over box and gum forests, scrubby in
places, and thinly-timbered well-grassed flats. The country in
general, so far as this, was as fine as could be wished for. The
grass every where soft, silky, and as green as a field of young
wheat. Unlike that of New South Wales, the grass and pasture here
consists of nutritious herbs and very fine grass, growing in a
thick sward, and completely hiding the soil. Hills and vales
alike were covered with flowers, principally of a yellow colour,
and growing as thick as they could&mdash;presenting to the eye of
one accustomed to the almost flowerless fields of Australia an
unusual and beautiful appearance, realising in some respects the
description given of English meadows. Everywhere, too, the
mimosa, loveliest of the flowering trees of Australia, and
destined to be as much celebrated in the lays of her poets as the
hawthorn has been in those of the British bards, scented the air
with its perfume, and dazzled the eye with its rich yellow
blossoms. Passed over some barren ranges covered with quartz, the
only thing pleasant on them being some flowering shrubs, chiefly
of the mimosa species. Through some fertile flats, the roads very
level and good, as indeed they were during the greater part of
the day&mdash;the only fault in them being a bog here and there,
which after our previous bad roads we considered a mere nothing.
Met several men who were returning from the diggings, and from
whom we learned that robberies and murders had of late been very
frequent at Bendigo. On Wednesday last, near thirty drays were
stopped by a large gang of bushrangers in the Black Forest, and
rum, tobacco, and other property taken from them to a great
amount. One man lost upwards of £700 worth of gold. No less than
three murders have been committed during the last week at
Bendigo, one in Eagle Hawk, another at Peg Log Gully, and another
in the Long Gully. One of the murdered men, we are informed, had
his head completely severed from the body. Our informants told us
that they had heard cries of 'murder' from the tent in which one
of the unfortunate men was killed, but hearing some one (probably
one of the perpetrators of the crime) laugh at the same time,
they thought that the men were joking among themselves. The
police are out scouring the bush in all directions. We thanked
our stars that we had not gone by the road through the Black
Forest, as we had at first intended, since being indifferently
armed, how much soever we might have wished to display our
heroism, we should have had but little chance of doing so.
Crossed Emu Creek; the country of slate formation; quartz in
abundance. An immense number of people passing to and from the
diggings; men, women, and children along the whole road from this
to Bendigo. Came to Bullock Creek, where we saw the places that
the diggers had made for cradling during the dry weather, when
the washing stuff had to be carried here from Bendigo, a distance
of seven or eight miles. Four seizures of sly grog-sellers'
carts, &amp;c., were made here by the commissioner and police
this morning. Passed over barren ridges, the timber on which
consisted of iron bark, box, gum, and stringy bark. This was the
first time I had seen iron bark in Victoria. Quartz in great
abundance, every ridge being covered with it. The country, in its
geological structure and general appearance, very much resembles
that on the Long Creek in the Western diggings. The ridges are
unusually uniform in their size, lower than one would be inclined
to imagine in a gold region, and have all the same direction. The
strike of the strata is north by west and south by east;
schistose formation well developed; and quartz in unusual
abundance. The whole, or nearly the whole, of the country over
which we passed to-day, has every appearance of being a rich
gold-field, but it has not yet had a fair trial. About three
<small>P.M.</small> came in sight of the commencement of the
Bendigo diggings, or what is called the Back Creek. Pitched our
tent on the Back Creek. Travelled to-day a distance of 16 miles
thus making the whole distance to Bendigo 107 miles, which I
think is correct, although less than what we were informed it
was.</p>
<p>"We, however, travelled upwards of 140 miles, having to make
so many detours in order to avoid bad places in the roads.</p>

<small>OPOSSUM.</small></p>
<br>
<h5>A FOOT JOURNEY TO MOUNT ALEXANDER.</h5>
<p>"We started for these mines on foot, each carrying his
swag&mdash;mine weighed 50 lbs. We had no other alternative, for
there was no dray to be got. I found the roads as bad as I had
heard. We saw about 100 drays on the road stuck fast. We could
only make fifteen miles a day, so it took us seven days; and when
we arrived I was knocked up with cold, owing to being continually
wet through between heavy rains and wading through creeks up to
the middle. I and another got lost once on the mountains for
eight hours; but, as luck would have it, we fell in with our
party at the Bendigo diggings, which, when all mustered,
consisted of five. To-day ends our first week's work; my share
consists of £15, besides half an ounce I made myself.</p>
<p>"I enjoy very good health now, otherwise it would be a hard
case, as doctors charge £5 5s. for looking at you.</p>
<p>"You would scarcely know me. My hair is very long, I wear an
old cap, a flannel shirt next my skin, and a blue one over all,
with a belt round my waist, where hang a brace of pistols and a
knife eighteen inches long, and a pair of antepopelos up to my
haunches. I am always covered with mud and soaked with water. You
may judge of the weather when I tell you, that when we rise in
the morning our blankets are covered with frost."</p>
<h5>FOREST CREEK.</h5>
<p>"The surface of the hills in this district, in many places, is
quite white from the quantity of small quartz, from the size of a
pin's head to a man's head. I tried surface washing, and knocked
out an ounce a day, taking eight or nine inches of the surface
like the above, the quartz being embedded in black loam. I also
found gold in a red clay under the above, say from nine to
fifteen inches under the surface. This was heavier gold, as if it
had by gravity gone through the loam and rested in the clay. The
richest surfacing here has been on Spring Hill, which is the
highest part of the range between Forest Creek and Fryer's Creek,
the summit being about 600 feet above these creeks, which are
four or five miles from each other. Surfacing is as uncertain as
sinking. You may wash a whole day and get nothing, or you may
happen upon some ounces in a square foot. I have tried many
places, and invariably found at least a few streaks of gold in
each dishful.</p>
<p>"The quartz lying in this soil I may liken to the fruit in a
good plum-pudding. Where there is gold on the surface, there is
sure to be gold lying on the rock below.</p>
<p>"Sinking in gullies and flats, I have always found the clay
predominating, generally lying in strata more or less mixed with
gravel, and sometimes a stratum of pure gravel or pure sand; the
latter is reckoned a bad sign. In this sort of sinking you come
to the rock at various depths to twenty-five feet; I have seen
none deeper. Hill sinking is more tedious, as the strata are
always harder&mdash;going through a hard red conglomerate gravel,
or a hard white cemented quartz, very gritty the base rock is
often forty or fifty feet down.</p>
<p>"These base rocks, on the top of which the gold lies, are
sandstone, generally red, and pipe-clay. This pipe-clay appears
to be slate in a softer state. It is laminated, and will cut
easily with a knife. The top of the slate is softish for four or
five inches, and contains gold. It is this top that is scraped
off with a knife and washed. The pipe-clay is seldom a good
gold-bearing bottom. All the rocks run almost north and
south&mdash;are in laminæ and on edge, like a ream of paper
placed on its edge, not laid flat. Often you will find these
different sort of bottoms in the same hole.</p>
<p>"We have done very little here for six weeks past in
gold-finding, though we have worked hard. In the above time we
have seen (three of us) the bottoms of ten holes, two of them
upwards of twenty feet deep, and all turned out not worth the
washing. We have just bottomed two others, nearly twenty feet
deep; two or three days will show what it will turn out. In my
hole I have to-day commenced mining; but I do not expect to see
gold in any quantity till I get six or seven feet in. I took out
a few pounds of gold about two months ago, but I am sorry to say
that it is all spent, everything is so expensive. I have also
been speculating foolishly in things I knew nothing about, and
naturally got burned. I cannot, therefore, leave this till I have
made a few pounds. By persevering at the digging, I have no doubt
fortune will favour me at last, Spring, of course, is the best
time for digging, so that it is not likely I shall be in New
Zealand soon, unless my luck turns very soon."</p>
<h5>SOUTH AUSTRALIA.</h5>
<p>South Australia seemed about to be depopulated by the rush to
the gold diggings of Victoria, when the happy idea was suggested
of establishing an overland route, so as to give Port Adelaide
the advantage of a gold escort. The following journal gives a
better idea of the country and bush life than the most elaborate
description:&mdash;</p>

<small>GOLD DIGGERS AT DINNER.</small></p>
<br>
<h5>JOURNAL OVERLAND BETWEEN ADELAIDE AND MOUNT ALEXANDER.</h5>
<blockquote>Having conceived that a shorter and better route
could be found between Adelaide and the Victoria gold-fields, and
that the adoption of a regular escort of mounted police to bring
the gold from the mines would be a benefit to South Australia,
and his Excellency the Lieutenant-Governor having approved of the
same, I received instructions on the 6th instant to proceed
forthwith, and in obedience thereto left Adelaide on the 10th
February, at nine o'clock, <small>A.M.</small><br>
<br>
During the day overtook numerous parties travelling overland in
almost every description of vehicle; many were on foot, advancing
with a firm step, and head erect, as if determined to face and
surmount whatever hardships might cross their path. Arrived at
Mount Barker at twelve o'clock, rested a couple of hours, and
again started for the crossing-place at Wellington, which I
reached at half-past seven, <small>P.M.</small>; thus making the
distance in eight hours and a half, including the two hours' rest
on the way. The present line of road between Mount Barker and the
crossing-place on the Murray is very circuitous, and might be
greatly improved by cutting a direct line across the scrub,
starting from near Mr. Ray's station. I imagine that ten miles
might thus be saved in the distance; and Corporal Hall, of the
mounted police, who is stationed here, informs me that the ground
is sound, and good travelling over. Overtook the police light
cart at Langhorn's Creek, the driver of which had started from
Adelaide the day previous, and was furnished with instructions to
the officers in charge at Mount Gambier and Mosquito Creek police
stations to join me without delay at Mount Alexander, to form an
escort hack to South Australia.<br>
<br>
Wednesday, 11th.&mdash;The sun rose at twenty minutes past five.
Got up early to prepare for the journey; saw the horses safely
across the Murray; fitted packsaddle to carry water, &amp;c.;
secured the services of an intelligent native, and rigged him out
at the store with a new blanket, shirt, and half a pound of
tobacco, with which he seemed highly delighted. The number of
persons, horses, and carts daily crossing the ferry, is truly
astonishing. I ascertained that no less than 1,234 passengers,
1,266 horses and bullocks, and 164 carriages of all descriptions
passed during the month of February. The fees collected were £64
14s. 2½d.<br>
<br>
Thursday, 12th.&mdash;Rose early; had the horses well fed and
saddled. At seven o'clock made a final start; taking an
east-south-east course; my party, consisting of myself, two
constables, one native, and five horses, the extra one being used
as a pack-horse to carry water and provisions. The morning cool
and cloudy, and very favourable for travelling. During the first
few miles I cut the surveyor's tracks several times; crossed
extensive well-grassed plains, extending seven or eight miles;
good travelling ground. Entered some low scrub, rather sandy;
made for a scrubby-looking range, distant about ten miles.
Following same course, came to a belt of shea-oaks
(<i>casuarina</i>), with a little grass in the centre of a flat;
here there is a splendid well, or cave, with abundance of water.
The survey party had encamped at this spot, and had secured the
top of the well by fixing, a cask sawn in half. As we approached
a number of bronze-winged pigeons flew from within. Watered the
horses by means of my oiled calico tent, and pushed on, keeping
same course towards two peaks. Halted for a few minutes in a
valley amongst some light-looking sandy ranges; very little
grass, no water. Native says water could be obtained by digging.
Distance from last halting-place ten miles. Passed through heavy,
sandy country, densely scrubby; saw some native signal fires to
the north-east. The scrub became still more dense as we
proceeded, and impeded our progress greatly; added to this, the
pack became every moment entangled in the branches, so that
towards night I found myself forced to fall back upon the beaten
track which cuts that part of the desert known as the Hundred
Mile Scrub. Made the road at dusk, but saw no signs of the survey
party having passed. Pushed on about a mile further, and encamped
amongst some shea-oaks, honeysuckles, and a variety of shrubs,
with plenty of grass, and a good supply of water. Shortly after
encamping, two drays belonging to the survey party came up, the
drivers of which informed me that the rest of their party were
sinking a well, about ten miles back, in a well-grassed patch of
country of about fifty acres in extent, well wooded. Doubts were,
however, entertained as to their succeeding in obtaining water.
They had already sunk twenty feet. Wrote a letter to the Deputy
Surveyor-General, acquainting him with the object of my journey,
and enclosing a copy of the Colonial Secretary's letter,
addressed to me on the subject. Distance travelled this day,
thirty miles.<br>
<br>
Friday, 13th.&mdash;A drizzling rain during the night, which
soaked us completely; left camping-place by eight o'clock;
traversed extensive open country, sandy, and covered with low
bush or heath. About four and a half miles from last camp found
water in three different spots amongst the shea-oaks. Numerous
remarkable granite rocks crop out of the ground near this, and
will not fail to indicate the precise spot to travellers. The
wells can be much improved by deepening. At noon halted to
refresh the horses in a flat, with a fine spring of water, good
feed, convenient halting-place. The road to-day I found very
heavy on account of the sandy nature of the soil; the heat of the
sun excessive. Rested two hours, and pushed on; distance from
last camp, sixteen and a half miles; horses much refreshed; two
and a half miles further, again found water and feed; five miles
more, discovered another well&mdash;the latter requires deepening
and cleaning, however, before it is made available. Observed the
tracks round the wells of a great number of emus; the
bronze-winged pigeon is likewise seen about the water a sure
indication that that great desideratum to the wearied traveller
is at hand. Passed two or three small plains well grassed,
containing from fifty to one hundred acres, surrounded with
scrub&mdash;no water; possibly it could be obtained by sinking,
as the soil differs-from the generality of that found in the
scrub: it is of a rich black loam, and might be made useful for
growing hay and other produce. Encamped for the night amongst the
shea-oaks; here two or three wells have been sunk in which we
found abundance of water. This spot makes an excellent
camping-place, as there is plenty of feed for the horses:
distance, forty miles.<br>
<br>
Saturday, 14th.&mdash;Morning cloudy; fine travelling weather.
Got up early; not much refreshed, however, in consequence of
having been disturbed by the howling of the native dogs, which
were prowling about our camp. These animals are perfectly
harmless, and have never been known to attack any one. It would
be well, however, for bushmen to drive them off when heard in the
vicinity of their camp, as they are apt to gnaw the tethers, and
thereby loosen the horses: a good, useful kangaroo-dog will
always scare them away. Moved off from the camp at six o'clock,
<small>A.M.</small>: on emerging from the scrub which surrounded
our camp, we entered a large plain, covered with heath, extending
to the eastward, as far as the eye could reach, bounded by a
ridge to the north-north-east&mdash;a conspicuous hill bearing
east-south-east, near which, the native informs me, there is a
sheep-station: steered direct for it. The road passes at its
base, and winds round to the left. The road, although sandy, is
much less so than yesterday. I noticed a great variety of new
shrubs, one in particular was pointed out to me by my sable
companion he informed me it bore a fruit in winter which the
natives are very fond of; it is sweet-tasted like sugar. Saw an
emu quietly feeding in the plains. As soon as it noticed us it
made off, and would in a few moments have been out of sight, but
old Cusack commenced whistling in a peculiar manner, which, to my
surprise and great amusement, not only put a stop to its further
retreat, but actually brought it back to within a few yards.
After surveying us for a few moments, it again started off at a
wonderful speed. I have frequently in my bush excursions ridden
after this extraordinary bird, but although well mounted, seldom
succeeded in overtaking it; it gains fresh impetus at every
stride. Reached the hill above described; distance from our last
encamping ground, fifteen miles. Observed the fresh tracks of
sheep; but being anxious not to delay a moment I did not attempt
to look for the station. This will make a good halting-place for
travellers, as there is plenty of wood, grass, and water. The
road after this is extremely heavy, the soil being composed of
sand. Arrived at a deserted sheep-station; the feed luxurious,
the country well timbered with gum, shea-oak, blackwood, and
other trees. Distance from hill where sheep-tracks seen, fifteen
miles. I may here remark, that on reaching this station the
desert ends. The traveller will find abundance of feed and water
in a well wherewith to recruit his horse before again proceeding
on his journey. Marked a tree, and left a note for Mr. M'Laren,
directing him where to find water. Altered my course to the east,
and pushed on to Mr. Scott's station; distance, eight miles. Had
dinner, resumed my journey, and encamped at the Woolshed Station.
This station is supplied with excellent water from a chain of
deep water-holes; water permanent.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Sunday, 15th. Finding the water-kegs were very
inconvenient (causing considerable delay in my progress), and as
water could now be obtained with certainty, I determined upon
leaving them at the station until my return. Resumed my journey
at seven o'clock, after our morning meal. Passed through the same
sort of country rich and fertile; water at intervals at from
three to five miles My attention was drawn to a very graceful
tree (swamp-oak) quite peculiar to this locality; the leaf is
similar to the casuarina, with this exception, that the former
stands erect whereas the latter droops; it is likewise dissimilar
in taste&mdash;the one being acid and the other bitter: the wood
is very hard, and is much used by the settlers for fencing and
building purposes. Crossed the Boundary line at eight miles. One
mile to the eastward of the line Messrs. Lloyd and Young have a
station. I called but both were from home Moved on, and halted
two hours at one of their out-stations, and had dinner. At this,
as well as at every other station I have called at, a woman
"hutkeeps," while the husband is minding the sheep. Hutkeepers,
shepherds, and other labourers are as difficult to be obtained in
this province as in South Australia; all are gold-digging mad.
Continued an easterly course; came to a lagoon, and had to turn
to the north in order to head it. The country through, which I
rode this day surpasses anything I have met with in South
Australia; vast extensive plains, with luxurious herbage,
everywhere meet the eye: these are intersected by belts of fine
timber of all kinds. In crossing one of the plains, saw a mob of
wild cattle; no sooner did they perceive us than they started
off, tearing over the ground and raising such clouds of dust, one
might have imagined a herd of buffaloes. Came across old
sheep-tracks; but could not spare time to look for the station.
Suddenly came to a long lagoon, stretching to the north and south
for several miles. After refreshing ourselves with a pannican of
tea, pushed on, altering my course to the southward for some
distance to head the swamp. As this delayed me considerably, and
took me out of my course, I determined upon crossing, and made a
dash accordingly. Succeeded, but found it boggy, and water rather
deep, occasionally reaching to the saddle-flaps. I have not the
least doubt but what this awkward spot can be avoided by going
round. Same sort of country; occasionally undulating, well
grassed, and timbered. Travelled till late, and encamped amongst
some large timber, with abundance of grass. I deemed we had
travelled this day thirty miles.<br>
<br>
Monday, 16th.&mdash;Horses are looking well and keep in good
condition. One or two of them have unfortunately sore
backs&mdash;a matter which, particularly in hot weather, is
difficult to guard against on long journeys. Saddled the horses
and started, keeping my old course; heard the bark of a dog, and
on going towards it found that we had encamped within a mile of
one of Major Firebrace's out-stations (sheep); here there is a
permanent spring of splendid water. Heat of the sun dreadful.
Reached a deserted sheep-station, found water near the hut:
distance from our camp, fifteen miles. Our course then took an
east-south-east direction, across a heath, sandy and bad
travelling. Mount Arapiles bearing south-east; followed the
beaten track, and entered some scrub; slow travelling, heavy
sand; this I regret to say continued for fifteen miles. I have
since been informed that ten miles of this heavy part of the road
can be avoided by continuing same course at the sheep-station,
and not turning to the east-south-east, as I was directed to do
by the hutkeeper at Major Firebrace's station. By following the
line which I now indicate, Mr. Patterson's station on the Wimmera
will be made, and from thence a track will be found leading, to
the village of Horsham, which is on the direct route to Mount
Alexander (see map.) After leaving the scrub we came out on some
open country, near two salt lakes, Mount Arapiles distant ten
miles. Entered some thickly-timbered country, well grassed,
halted for two hours to refresh the horses-at some water which we
found in a swamp on the left of the road; ten minutes after
resuming our journey crossed the Wimmera River. This is a fine
stream, not unlike the Onkaparinga, near Hahndorf; the holes are,
however, considerably larger and deeper, some, I dare say,
measure thirty yards in breadth and from two hundred to three
hundred in length; the soil on either bank for miles, cannot, I
am satisfied, be anywhere surpassed for its fertility and
richness. Passed the station of Messrs. Baily and Hamilton, and
moved on, keeping along the north bank of the river to Major
Firebrace's station. The Major was from home; his son, however,
hospitably entertained me and my party; to him I feel much
indebted for a great deal of valuable information respecting the
line of route which we have still to travel. Distance made this
day, thirty-five miles. At night it thundered and lightened
considerably, which greatly cooled the air; heavy drops of rain
fell.<br>
<br>
Tuesday, 17th.&mdash;I got up very early and left the house
without disturbing the family, and started. The regular beaten
overland road passes close to tins station; we got upon it and
followed it the whole of the day; it is rather circuitous, as it
follows the windings of the river: by a little observation many
miles might be saved during a day's journey. Passed several fine
stations. The homestead is invariably enclosed by a substantial
fence, and stands in die centre of a paddock of from 300 or 400
acres. From inquiries which I made, I find that none of the land
belongs to the squatters; they rent it from the Crown with a
pre-emptive right of purchase. Passed numerous parties on their
way to the diggings, some encamped, others travelling. Came to
the-village of Horsham, distant twelve miles from the station of
Major Firebrace; after a stay of a few minutes at the "pub,"
resumed my journey. Here is a police-station, a store, a
blacksmith, and one or two wooden houses. Travelled during the
day pretty smartly, and arrived about nine o'clock,
<small>P.M.</small> at the village of Glenarchy. The village is
similar to Horsham, about the same size, and containing about the
same number of houses. I was forced, much against my inclination,
to pass the night at the inn, in consequence of the want of feed
in the neighbourhood. I did not at first like the appearance of
either the building or the inmates, and in truth I was not
deceived; the accommodation was bad, beds filthy, full of bugs,
charges exorbitant, and extremely uncivil withal. The rascally
hostler had the impudence (as I was giving directions about the
feeding of my horses) coolly to tell me to feed them myself!
Distance made, forty-four miles.<br>
<br>
Wednesday, 18th.&mdash;Made rather a late start; obliged to ride
pack-horse, in consequence of my own having a galled back. On
reaching Mr. Green's station, distant twelve miles from
Glenarchy, turned off to left, to avoid the village of Burnbank,
thereby saving a distance of twenty miles to Mount Alexander:
indicated the spot by marking a gum tree with the words, "Take to
the left." This track leads through a well-watered country, with
plenty of grass, to the Navarre Inn, kept by a person named
Mackoy, distant from Glenarchy thirteen miles. A glance at the
map will at once point out how the saving is effected. Rested the
horses two hours, and once more moved on; a high range in the
distance, beautiful in appearance, much resembling the Mount
Lofty Range of South Australia. On leaving the inn the road
became very circuitous; it winds by the bank of a creek, well
watered, into the heart of the mountains: good travelling almost
level.<br>
<br>
Thursday, 19th.&mdash;Up by the break of day; felt much
refreshed, having slept soundly all night; effected a good start
at half-past six o'clock; road led through a beautiful valley,
with a creek meandering through it; the country then became
undulating, exceedingly beautiful and romantic, the rising slopes
and valleys studded here and there with shrubs of every
description, amongst which I noticed the silver wattle, or Van
Diemen's Land acacia, predominating. Passed Mr. M'Kinnon's sheep
station nine miles; country more hilly, densely timbered; the
stringy bark, blue and white gum, box, and many other trees
familiar to a South Australian, are found in the hills. Crossed a
creek near the station of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. I could
not help remarking that the water in all the creeks, as I get
nearer and nearer to Mount Alexander, is of a singularly dark
colour, perfectly clear, however, when taken out, and sweet
tasted. Query can this be an indication of During the day passed
through open forest land, plains, and now and again
densely-timbered flats of from three to four miles in extent.
Made Mr. Bucknall's station; crossed a large creek a few hundred
yards below the house. The country here, as we emerged from the
thick timber, changed like magic; hills appeared in our front
extending to the right and left for miles, grassy, but perfectly
bare of a single tree; these again were bounded to the east and
south-east by a more distant, remarkable, high-peaked range, to
all appearance of the same character. Turning the head to the
north-east a ridge, thickly wooded, similar to that already
described, is seen, behind which rises the already far-famed
Mount Alexander; entered the thick wood seen sometime back; again
emerged into a large plain, crossing which we came to the River
Loddon, where the diggings commence, thus accomplishing the
journey between the Murray and it in eight days. Encamped on the
east bank of the river; good feed and water; distance travelled
this stage, fifty-nine miles.<br>
<br>
Friday, 20th.&mdash;Visited Forest Creek and Adelaide Gully;
conversed with many of the South Australian gold seekers, and
informed them of the purport of my visit; shortly after it was
made known throughout the diggings that I had arrived, I was met
by crowds, who expressed their delight at the success which I hud
had in making so quick a journey, at the news I was bearer of,
and at the establishment of a mounted escort to convey the gold
to Adelaide. I have since been assured that hundreds will remit
their hard-earned earnings by the present escort, and will so
continue if it be regularly established, instead of having to
send it to Melbourne, or otherwise dispose of it, at a shameful
loss, to agents who reside at the mines. It affords me much
pleasure to note that the Adelaide diggers in general have
obtained, and still continue to obtain, more gold-dust than
others. The greatest good feeling appears to prevail amongst
them, and I can confidently assert that nine out of ten will, as
soon as possible, return to settle permanently in South
Australia, rather than remain in Victoria.</blockquote>

<hr class="2">
<h5>FROM BENDIGO TO MELBOURNE.</h5>
<p class="quote" align="center"><small>BY A RETURNED SYDNEY
DIGGER.</small></p>
<blockquote><span class="a">Dear</span> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, We
left Bendigo on Tuesday, about 12 <small>A.M.</small>, and
arrived in Melbourne on the Friday following, about 2
<small>P.M.</small> Previous to leaving we had to sell two carts
and horses. The mode of disposing of such articles at Bendigo is
rather peculiar, but answers better than any other. The cart is
driven through the diggings with a flag, or rather a substitute
for one in the shape of a handkerchief, flying in front, and the
words "For Sale" chalked in large letters on the sides and back.
The same plan is pursued with respect to all other articles for
sale, and answers admirably; the goods being speedily disposed
of. There are several purchasers of second hand tools, &amp;c.,
but as these parties of course buy to make a profit, the mode
above described is generally resorted to by the diggers. The
practice has even reached Melbourne, as I saw several carts
driven about the town with the words "For Sale" on them in
letters of enormous magnitude.<br>
<br>
Having disposed of the carts we set out on our journey with light
hearts, although the day was excessively hot.<br>
<br>
The first day, having had a late start, we only went as far as
the junction of the road leading to Forest Creek.<br>
<br>
You will recollect that we went up by the Kilmore road, which at
that time, though by far the longest, was the best for drays. The
road by which we came down, usually called the "Kyneton Road," is
much shorter, and at all times better for foot-men, inconsequence
of the great number of accommodation houses which are situated
along the whole road at about the rate of one to every two or
three miles. The roads at this time of the year are in splendid
condition, and, as there is abundance of grass and water, nothing
can be more agreeable than travelling on them. There is no lack
of public-houses, moreover, where the weary traveller may solace
himself with a cheering cup, but for which he has to pay at
rather a high rate: spirits and beer at nearly all the inns are
1s. 6d. per glass. Provisions, too, are far dearer than at the
diggings. The four-pound loaf is 5s., and beef is 9d. per pound
at the Bush Inn, which is only thirty-six miles from
Melbourne.<br>
<br>
On Wednesday morning we were up by day-break and on the road. We
walked ten miles to the Robert Burns hotel, where we had
breakfast, which, considering the price of things, was not very
dear, being only 3s. Here we got a lift in a cart for £1 each as
far as the Broad Meadow, which is within ten miles of Melbourne.
The number of people whom we met on their way to the diggings was
astonishing. Most of them were evidently new arrivals; and being
unaccustomed to carrying heavy swags, many of them appeared to be
quite worn out. More than one-half of those whom we met wore
veils, and at a distance might easily be mistaken for women.<br>
<br>
Women, too, there were in abundance bound for the gold-fields,
many of them with large families, seemingly bent upon making the
diggings their home for some time. The country through which we
passed was most beautiful, being luxuriantly grassed and but
lightly timbered. In fact it might be described as a succession
of undulating plains, there being scarcely trees enough to
relieve the scenery from the charge of monotony. We had dinner at
the Columbine where there is a township, which seems rapidly
progressing; wooden houses, some of them very elegant, springing
up in all directions. The Columbine was running at the time with
a considerable body of water, which was as clear as crystal. In
the middle of summer, however, the country is completely parched
up, and there is not a drop of water to be had on the road for
miles. The government has at length bestirred itself with regard
to the road, and there are now numerous parties at work metalling
it. When approaching Kyneton, we met six men drawing a laden
cart, arranged in the form of a wedge, one leading, two in the
middle and three behind. This is no uncommon thing to see on the
diggings, but it is rather unusual on the roads from Melbourne.
They appeared to be a party of recent arrivals from England. We
passed through Kyneton, which, since the diggings have commenced,
has been making considerable progress, being the principal town
between them and Melbourne. About three miles from Kyneton is
Carlsruhe, 5 there is a large police-station. As we were passing
there was a sergeant ilfing about a dozen recruits, most of them
boys, in every variety of costume, from the blue shirt to almost
no shirt at all; but in this respect they are only like the rest
of the Victorian police. It was impossible to refrain from
laughter while watching their movements, which disrespect on our
part caused the sergeant to look austere, although he said
nothing. After going about three miles beyond Carlsruhe we camped
for the night.<br>
<br>
"Thursday morning we were on the road as soon as we had
breakfast, and after travelling about three miles came to the
entrance of the "Black Forest," of evil memory. During the more
lawless days of the Victorian gold diggings, it was the custom
for travellers to wait on the verge of the forest until a
sufficient number were collected to insure their passage through
it in safety. Latterly, however, the place, although offering
uncommon opportunities of concealment to the bushranger, has
become so quiet, that no more fear is entertained by those who
pass through it than on any other portion of the road. The Black
Forest well deserves its name, for it is as gloomy a place as the
imagination could well conceive. It is situated at the foot of
Mount Macedon, and extends for several miles in all directions.
The timber, chiefly stringy-bark, is very large&mdash;indeed by
far the largest that I saw in Port Phillip. The stringy-bark of
itself is a dismal looking tree, and is here more so, from having
its trunk blackened with fire. The underwood, too, is very thick,
which adds to the gloom of the forest. Some years ago there were
great fires in several parts of Victoria, which occasioned an
immense destruction of life and property. The day on which the
fire took place, or in which it was at the highest pitch, is
still known in Port Phillip by the name of Black Thursday. Traces
of this fire are to be seen in several other localities beside
the Black Forest. The part of the forest through which we passed
was about twelve miles across, commencing at a place called
Wood's End and ending at the Bush Inn. There are now several
accommodation houses in the forest, which were much needed.<br>
<br>
The road through the forest was crowded with teams; and it
certainly would have been a difficult matter for any gang of
bushrangers to have committed any depredations, as they would
have been obliged to "stick up" hundreds of drays. One of my
companions counted no less than seventy-five drays within the
space of a mile. It must be taken into consideration, also, that
there were three or four other roads to the diggings, on all of
which the traffic was nearly as great as on that of which I am
speaking. After leaving the Bush Inn you again come into an open
country of trap formation. The soil, though uncultivated, is
evidently fertile, and would be admirably adapted to the
cultivation of the vine. The most peculiar feature of the scene
is Mount Macedon, which is visible both from Melbourne and the
diggings, rising almost abruptly from the surrounding country. In
consequence of its vicinity to Mount Macedon, scarcely a day
passes on which more or less rain does not fall in the Black
Forest,&mdash;a fact which was exemplified when we passed through
it. The trees in many places after leaving the forest are dying
out, and as there are no new ones springing up to replace them,
it seems probable that in time a great portion of Victoria will
be quite destitute of timber. From Spring Hill, distant about
twenty-seven miles from Melbourne, there is a splendid view over
Keilor Plains, which are clothed with the most luxuriant verdure.
The view extends as far as the sea coast, and on a clear day the
shipping in William's Town can be distinctly seen. We camped this
night at Jackson's Creek, where there was the greatest abundance
of feed and excellent water.<br>
<br>
Friday morning was cold and rainy, and as we had to travel
through an open country, we found it impossible to keep ourselves
warm. We crossed the Deep Creek, which flows between banks of a
great height, and in the winter season carries all before it. The
country is of granitic formation, and along the banks of the
creek highly picturesque, though tame enough everywhere else.
What forcibly strikes the traveller in Victoria is the entirely
uncultivated state of the country, and the almost total want of
gardens and orchards, notwithstanding the fertility of the
greater portion of the soil. In this respect, also, the contrast
between Melbourne and Sydney is very unfavourable to the former,
the numerous gardens and shrubberies in and around Sydney giving
it an infinitely superior and more delightful appearance than
Melbourne. From the Deep Creek you have a first-rate view of the
shipping at William's Town, which to one coming from the interior
is a more agreeable sight than could be imagined. Leaving the
drays at the Broad Meadow, we struck across the country until we
came to the old Sydney mad, which we followed until we arrived at
Flemington, where we met the governor starting on a tour through
the gold-fields. After leaving Flemington, which is about three
miles from Melbourne, if you have been the road before, you are
perfectly bewildered at the change that has taken place in a
short space of time. Wooden houses and tents have arisen as it
were by the power of Aladdin's lamp, and have completely altered
the appearance of the scene.<br>
<br>
Now you begin also to see some of the bustle that necessarily
characterises such a stirring place as Melbourne. You feel
yourself, moreover, safer, as it were, than previously, although
I doubt if you have any reason for so doing. However, your plan
is to consider every man as a rogue you may meet between Bendigo
and the Flag-staff. You now begin to get fairly in the city, and
after a few minutes' walk you are in Collins Street, the
principal street of Melbourne. Here you witness such a bustling
scene as you are altogether unprepared for, notwithstanding your
previously conceived opinions of the great traffic that must
exist in Melbourne. It is literally impossible to walk through
the streets without being jostled and squeezed at every step; and
if you for a moment deviate from the foot-path, you run the most
imminent risk of being knocked down by a cart or cab, which
completely block up the streets. Melbourne is swarmed with Jews,
and being easily recognised as a gold-digger as you are walking
down the streets, you are every half-dozen yards accosted by them
something in the following style:&mdash;"Any gold tor sale, sir?"
"£3 10s. to-day for gold, mate." "I say, old fellow, have you got
any gold to sell?"&mdash;the salutation being framed according to
their different ideas of which will be most acceptable, the
familiar or the polite style. You are so pestered with these
wasps, that you are compelled at length, in self-defence, to
return them some saucy answer, which, being well accustomed to,
they receive with the most philosophical indifference. Next you
take a stroll along the wharves, where goods of every description
are lying piled in immense heaps, and completely exposed to the
destructive influence of the weather. The wharves are, if
possible, more crowded than the streets, and if not particularly
alive to your own safety, you stand every chance of taking a cold
bath in the Yarra.<br>
<br>
Here and there are groups collected around some recent arrivals
by the English vessels, who are selling off their superfluous
goods, most of which they are obliged to dispose of at a loss.
But what matters this? They have reached this El Dorado, the land
of their long-cherished hopes. Look now to the south side of the
Yarra, and there you will see a perfect city of tents. It is
estimated that there are between three and four thousand
individuals living there, and there certainly cannot be less.
These are all new arrivals, sojourning here for a time, until
they resolve upon whether they shall go to some employment, or
shape their course for the gold-fields. Everywhere you go in this
golden city your olfactory senses are disagreeably assailed with
almost unbearable stenches, which must at no distant period
occasion some frightful epidemic. The influenza is now raging in
Melbourne to an unusual extent, and the great numbers of funerals
that take place daily tell but too sadly the "common tale" of
humanity. It needs no great wight to foretel that some terrible
disasters will befal Melbourne if the people do not speedily
bestir themselves to introduce a better state of social
affairs.<br>
<br>
To-day I was at the Victoria Gold Escort Company's office, an
establishment admirably conducted. Those holding escort receipts
may obtain their gold or money in a few hours after the escort
arrives, whereas at the government office there are the most
unnecessary and provoking delays. The name of the depositor is
not written in the receipts given by the company, but is
transcribed into a book kept for that purpose, together with the
amount said to be deposited. The receipt merely states that so
many ounces or pounds are said to be in the bag, neither money
nor gold being counted or weighed. The bag is tied and sealed,
and received thus by the depositor, the company not holding
themselves in any way responsible for the amount. Omitting the
depositor's name in the receipt is obviously an excellent plan,
and prevents a great deal of fraud.<br>
<br>
I have been employed the greater part of the day in looking out
for a vessel. So many people are hurrying home just now that it
is a matter of some difficulty, notwithstanding the number of
vessels laid on for Sydney, to obtain a passage for that port. I
have at length obtained one in the <i>Wild Irish Girl</i>, the
passage-money being £9, which is an advance of 3 on what the
cabin passages were formerly.</blockquote>
<p>With these extracts, which afford so perfect an idea of the
life and the land of the diggers, we conclude our attempt to
describe the Australian Gold Regions. New creeks, rivers, and
mountains are daily announced as the sites of inexhaustible
treasures, the last being generally for a time considered the
richest. The Ovens, near the River Murray, is now exciting a good
deal of attention in New South Wales, and has caused the
desertion of localities previously in great repute,* while the
discovery of two enormous nuggets at Ballarat has caused a vast
re-emigration to the first discovered Victorian gold-field.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mr. Stutchbury, the government geologist,
found in the Cudgegong River small specimens of ruby, sapphire
and chrysolite, topaz, hyacinth, amethyst, and cairngorm, and
expects to find emerald and aqua marine.]</p>
<p>The South Australians have not yet been successful in
discovering a gold-field worth working. At Echunga 1,208 licences
were in the first instance issued, but of these only 166 were
renewed once, only 64 twice, and 7 three times. At the last
accounts 180 persons were at work.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the outfit required for four gold
diggers. The cradles sold in England are for the most part toys,
not strong enough to bear rough work. English carts, forges, and
pumps, unless made from colonial directions, are not worth their
freight for real use:&mdash;</p>

<p>To this must be added the cost of a tent; and at any of the
Victoria diggings, a cart, a team, and provisions for six

<br>
<p>While New South Wales and Victoria were becoming wealthy and
populous on the strength of their gold-fields, the able-bodied
population of South Australia proceeded <i>en masse</i> to the
neighbouring colonies. Two measures wisely and promptly adopted
by the local government and the Legislative Council saved South
Australia. By an act, rapidly passed through the legislature, in
January, 1852, gold of 22 carats was made a legal tender at the
banks at the rate of £3 11s. per ounce against an issue of
bank-notes. It thus became the interest of South Australian
diggers to bring the produce of their labour to their own colony,
there to employ it in purchasing land at government sales, in
paying duties on imports, and in other modes in which it was
worth more money than in the gold provinces. South Australia was
the first province to strike gold tokens, which passed there for
twenty shillings, and in England are worth about twenty-three
shillings.</p>
<p>At the same time that the Bullion Act was passed, the overland
route to Mount Alexander was opened, and a government escort was
established.</p>
<p>The system prevalent in South Australia of selling land in
small lots in quantities always in advance of demand, afforded a
further inducement to the return of gold-diggers to settle on
small farms. The results have been most satisfactory; a regular
export trade in agricultural produce has been established between
Port Adelaide and the gold colonies.</p>
<br>
<p>The Legislature of New South Wales have passed a Gold Mining
Act, of which the following are the most important
clauses:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image45" id="Image45"></a><img alt=""
src="1400441h-images/Image45.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>REMOVING GOODS.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Clauses 2, 5, and 8, withhold the ordinary privileges of
mining from any persons who are not British subjects, except on
payment of double fees or royalties. Clause 2 gives power to the
executive to grant leases or licences for gold mining, in regard
to auriferous tracts, for twenty-one years; and clause 10
authorises the demand of a fee, not exceeding £25, from any
applicant for quartz vein or auriferous tracts, which is to be
returned if his application is not granted. Clause 3 gives power
to suspend pastoral leases or licences, in so far as may be
necessary to mining operations, upon the runs to which these
leases or licences pertain, and to make compensation for such
suspension according to a previously established rule. Clause 4.
No sort of occupation may be carried on within any auriferous
tract of crown lands without licence except the pastoral and
agricultural. Women not mining, and children under fourteen years
of age, are exempt from this rule. Clause 11. Persons employed in
making tunnels or drains are to be permitted, on condition that
they give security that they will pay the due royalty upon any
gold they may accidentally find in the course of their work.
Clause 9 allows a half-licence to be taken after the fifteenth
day of any month, the applicant not having been guilty of
anything during the previous half month to furnish a sufficient
ground of objection.</p>
<p>An idea of the financial importance of the gold exports may be
gathered from figures:</p>

<p class="foot">[* Flour is usually sold in Melbourne by the ton
of 2,000 lbs., instead of 2,240 lbs., as in the United Kingdom.
If reckoned by the ton of 2,000 lbs., the price is respectively
£15 and £22 10s.]</p>
<p>The <i>Melbourne Argus</i> of January 3 estimates the number
of diggers at the Victoria Mines at 100,000, earning on an
average an ounce per man per week.</p>
<p>The forebodings of the pastoral proprietors, who saw in the
gold discoveries the desertion of all their labourers and the
destruction of their flocks, have not been realised. A very large
per centage of the armies of emigrants who are daily landing on
the shores of Australia either find themselves prevented from
taking to the pursuit which led them to emigrate, by the expense
and toil of the journey to the interior; or, after having tried
gold-digging, are compelled to abandon labour harder than they
can endure. These disappointed ones fall back upon the staple
employments of the colony, and either turn farmers or accept
situations as gardeners, shepherds, agricultural labourers,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>We have every reason to believe that while the great prizes of
the gold-fields are suffered to attract a steady stream of
self-supporting emigration, the overplus, unfit for such a
laborious occupation, will be sufficient to maintain the flocks
of sheep and herds of cattle which have hitherto supplied in wool
and tallow the principal exports of the gold colonies.</p>
<p>The first effect of gold mining has been to give a value, in
the shape of beef and mutton, to sheep and cattle, which had
previously been only worth money to shear or boil down. Another
result will be the establishment of towns and villages,
surrounded by agricultural farms, in districts which, under the
pastoral system, seemed condemned to perpetual barrenness and
solitude. The question of opening the navigation of the Murray,
by clearing away shoals, rocks, and snags, will perhaps be
successfully solved by the gold-diggings at Albury.</p>
<p>If these anticipations be realised, gold will prove a most
valuable agent in stimulating colonisation. Every gold-digger
gives occupation to at least three other men, in feeding him,
clothing him, and conveying backwards and forwards what he
produces, and what he consumes. The profits on meat lately given
to the dogs supports many a butcher in a gold district, and land
only used by sheep becomes worth the toil of tillage.</p>
<p>It is a most favourable feature of the Australian gold-fields,
that they are within reach of settled communities, surrounded by
live beef and mutton, and by land of the best quality, which only
needs the plough and the hoe, roughly handled, to produce great
crops of wheat, maize, and every green vegetable. These lands
will not remain untilled.</p>
<p>The Australian gold-digger, unlike the Californian, has no
sooner filled his pockets than he sets to work to settle his wife
comfortably in a neat cottage with a garden, reserving the
chances of another visit to the mines if he should find more
capital needful.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII.</h3>
<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the preceding pages we have followed
step by step the series of social, commercial, and political
events which have established three free and prosperous colonies
on the island-continent of Australia; the progress of the
pastoral interest from the eight merinos imported by M'Arthur to
the fourteen millions of fine-woolled sheep which now graze over
Australian pastures; the progress of emigration, from the few
score officials, soldiers, turnkeys, and rum-traders, who, for a
quarter of a century, formed the only free additions to the
native-born population, to the present time, when armies of
emigrants, counted in tens of thousands, arrive from all
countries of Europe and America; the progress of the value of
land from the period when a bribe of rations and the aid of
government-fed slave labour was needed to induce a colonist to
accept a farm, to the present year, when land is sold by the foot
at the rate of thousands of pounds per acre; the progress of
trade from the mere barter of the year 1800, with imports
dependent on the expenditure of the home government, to the year
1853, when millions of Australian exports in gold and wool create
a new and profitable export for almost every branch of British
manufactures, and afford employment for an amount of tonnage
which British shipowners find themselves unable to supply; the
progress of political institutions, from the irresponsible
despotism of the first governor and gaoler, to the concession of
the amplest powers of self-government and taxation, with full
control of land and land funds, customs and casual revenues, to
the three Legislative Assemblies of New South Wales, Victoria,
and South Australia, by the Conservative Duke of Newcastle.</p>
<p>These rapid strides of the English-speaking Australian
colonists, in which the acquisition of political rights has kept
pace with the enlargement of their material resources, we have
endeavoured to trace with a firm and impartial pen. We conclude
our task at a moment when the brightest prospects seem opening to
the three colonies; when, released from the baneful control of
transmarine bureaucracy, permitted to exercise with the most
perfect freedom those rights of self-government which are so
essential to the full development of the powers of an English
race; relieved from the contamination of old world felonry; with
all the aid that can be derived from the capital, the credit, the
colonisation, and "cheap defence" of the parent state, Australia
seems starting on the race of empire with greater advantages than
have ever fallen to the offshoot of a great nation in ancient or
modern times. Free institutions, unrestricted commerce, ample
revenues, without debt, and without the taxes which a defensive
force, naval or military, would require nothing can retard the
progress of our Australian fellow-countrymen, if they prepare in
good time to counteract the money-worshipping, utilitarian
spirit, and low tone of commercial morality which are the bane of
new communities.</p>
<p>An antidote is to be found in the teaching of zealous
Christian ministers, and in the study of those treasures of the
literature, art, and science of the old world, which no modern
material El Dorado can excel.</p>
<p>The regulation of the future colonisation of the Australians
will rest with the colonists themselves. If they are wise, they
will give no encouragement to that system of pauper emigration
which the Government Commissioners have long patronised. No
population can be more difficult to govern than a mob of
uneducated peasantry, suddenly transferred from indigence to the
wages of a gold country. It is the interest alike of the colonies
and of this country, that the influence of rude men who crowd to
the gold diggings should be counterbalanced by a stream of
industrious, educated, intelligent families, the yeomen and
frugal mechanics, with large families, who swell the ranks of
"Family Colonisation," men who would be prepared to carry on
colonisation by cultivation, and reproduce on the fertile lands
of Australia the farms and villages of England. We commend to the
attention of the Colonial Legislatures, the fathers of this
many-childrened class, who are led to emigration, not by
discontent, not by vain Utopian longings, but by</p>
<p class="poem">"The pride to rear an independent shed,<br>
And give the lips they love unborrow'd bread,<br>
To skirt their home with harvests widely sown,<br>
And call the blooming landscape all their own,<br>
Their children's heritage in prospect long."</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">The</span> Legislative Council of New South
Wales, on the recommendation of the Committee (whose report we
give below, I.), have passed an Act (which we also give, II.),
rendering it lawful to make contracts with emigrants in this or
any other country,&mdash;to bind them to work for wages settled
in Europe&mdash;to repay the cost of their passage to
Australia&mdash;to compel emigrants sent out by the Emigration
Commissioners to repay part of their passage money&mdash;to
apprentice boys and girls above the age of thirteen for four
years, at £5 for two years, and £10 for two years, with
board.</p>
<p>The principle that emigrants should repay part or all the cost
of their passage is sound, but whether the mode proposed by the
Parliament of New South Wales will work, we may be permitted to
doubt.</p>
<p>Attempts to make labourers or mechanics work for less than
current wages have always failed in this country, and so have
contracts binding men to serve a particular master in a skilled
trade.</p>
<p>If the Council had made the passage-money paid by the colony a
debt due by the emigrant, that would have been reasonable; but to
bind a man in Europe to serve a master he has never seen, in an
employment he has never practised, for wages to be fixed by the
master, is to sow the seeds of perpetual litigation and
discontent, especially as the magistrates who will have to decide
the disputes are inevitably employers of labour; and no man is a
safe judge in his own cause.</p>
<p>In like manner the theory of apprenticing minors is
reasonable, but this legislation is one-sided.</p>
<p>The wages will often be inadequate, and no provision is made
in the Act for the inspection or protection of those apprenticed
orphans. There may be Mrs. Sloanes in Australia as well as in
England.</p>
<p>We feel for the hard position of the great stockowners and
other employers of labour in the difficult position in which they
are placed by the labour attraction of the gold-fields, but we
venture to hint that the only law which will bind the labourer to
his employer under such circumstances, is the law of kindness.

<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="negindent3"><i>Second Report of the Select Committee of
the Legislative Council, appointed on the 10th June, 1852, "to
inquire into and report upon the most speedy and effectual means
of introducing into the colony a supply of labour adequate to its
requirements</i>."</p>
<br>
<blockquote>THE number of applications which are now pouring-in
upon the Emigration Commissioners for passages to this colony,
under the existing regulations, is so great, that it is evident
the territorial revenue as at present administered can no longer
of itself sustain the charge, nor can it supply an immigration at
all commensurate with the large and growing requirements of the
colony. The fact, too, that the immigrants who are thus
introduced at the public expense, are under no obligation to
embark on their arrival in the ordinary industrial pursuits of
the colony, which was the primary object of their introduction,
and is the sole ground upon which any expenditure of the public
revenue for such an object can be justified, renders it both just
and necessary that they should not only be compelled, as a
preliminary measure, to enter into such an engagement in England
for a term of not less than two years, but that they should also
bind themselves to repay, by equal yearly instalments, a certain
sum towards their passage-money, which your committee have fixed
at 13. It is considered that this amount ought to be repaid by
all statute adults, that is, by all persons above fourteen years
of age, because they can earn wages which will enable them to
repay without difficulty; but no contributions will be required
from the mothers of families, and children under that age. Whilst
it is obviously but just that the immigrant who is likely to
benefit so largely by being brought to this colony at the public
expense, should be compelled to refund this stipulated amount to
the public treasury on the one hand, it has been deemed equitable
on the other hand, first, that he should be allowed on his
arrival to repay (if he can) his passage-money; second, that for
a certain short period after his arrival here (to be fixed by
public regulation) he shall be permitted to choose his employer,
so as to enable him to obtain the current rate of wages; and
third, that after serving an employer for one year he shall be at
liberty to pay any balance of passage-money 'due by him, on
giving three months' notice to his employer, and so terminate his
agreement. To carry out the details of this new system, it will
be necessary that the immigrant, in England, should indent
himself in England to the immigration agent in the colony, and
that this officer again should have power to bind him by
indenture here to any competent employer, so as to carry these
regulations into effect. For this purpose a local enactment will
be necessary, which your committee will prepare.<br>
<br>
Your committee further recommend, that the Immigration
Commissioners should be instructed, as a general rule in the
distribution of passages by emigrant vessels, to give a
preference to emigrants hired under indenture in England by
colonial employers, or for them by their English agents, so long
as they belong to any enumerated classes now eligible for bounty
emigration; but with an understanding, nevertheless, that they
are to be subject to the repayment out of their wages, of the
amount of passage-money, viz., 13, thus fixed by your
committee.<br>
<br>
As some misunderstanding seems to exist in England as to the
necessity that such indenture should be stamped, it may be as
well here to observe, that, by the 9th Geo. IV., cap. 83, all
indentures of this sort are expressly exempt from the stamp duty;
and to make this exception the more certain, a clause to the like
effect will be introduced into the legislative measure which will
be required to carry out these recommendations.<br>
<br>
Your committee having-learnt by advices lately received from
England, that there are large numbers of boys and girls of good
character, of thirteen years of age and upwards, in the orphan
schools and other eleemosynary establishments of the United
Kingdom, towards whose emigration to this colony the guardians
and other managers of such establishments would contribute
largely out of parochial or other funds, with a view as well to
the relief of such establishments from the cost of their
maintenance, as to the advantageous settlement of the apprentices
themselves in the colony, recommend that whenever any such boys
or girls are under indenture to the immigration agent of this
colony for the time being, to serve an apprenticeship of four
years, the two first for wages at the rate of 5 a year, and the
two last for wages at the rate of 10 a year, a contribution of at
a rate not exceeding 8 for statute adults, should be made towards
their passage-money from the territorial revenue, and be repaid
by the employer at the time the apprentice is indented to him by
the immigration agent, provided the remainder of their
passage-money and their outfit be contributed by the guardians or
other managers of any such institutions at home.<br>
<br>
The emigrants of the enumerated classes, and to whom your
committee recommend that passages should be furnished under the
foregoing stipulations as to indenture and repayment, are as
follows:</blockquote>

<br>
Your committee, in thus recommending a complete alteration in the
present bounty system, feel that a new era has arisen in the
whole of the colonies forming the Australian group, which renders
them the most eligible of all the countries in the globe as a
field for immigration, not from the United Kingdom alone but from
all Europe; that the necessity, therefore, which has hitherto
existed to hold out extraordinary inducements to intending
emigrants to select these colonies as a future home, has entirely
ceased; that all future immigration therefore should, if its cost
be not in the first instance defrayed out of the funds of the
immigrants themselves, be at least for the most part of a
self-supporting character, so as to relieve that branch of our
public revenue which has hitherto been almost exclusively devoted
to this object from this absorbing-charge; and to enable it
hereafter to be devoted to those internal improvements which the
continued progress of population and civilisation will render
indispensable: and that in order to carry out these views, the
present system of bounty emigration from the mother country
should be abolished, and all future immigration, to this colony
at least, be established on that self-supporting, or nearly
self-supporting, basis which is indicated in this Report, unless
some unforeseen necessity for a deviation from it should
arise.<br>
<br>
As to the following resolutions referred to this committee on the
motion of Mr. Donaldson&mdash;<br>
<br>
1st.&mdash;That this House considers that a sum of not less than
10,000 out of the amount now in course of transmission to England
by the Governor-General, might with great propriety be applied in
furtherance of the object of the Family Colonisation Loan
Society, in such manner as might be arranged between the
Secretary of State for the Colonies and the London Committee of
this Society, whether by way of guarantee funds, or by actual
appropriation, as might be decided on.<br>
<br>
2nd.&mdash;This House being of opinion that the Family
Colonisation Loan Society, established by Mrs. Chisholm, and
represented in London by a Committee consisting of the Right
Honourable the Earl of Shaftesbury and others, forms a valuable
adjunct to the other means employed for the promotion of
emigration of a good character to the Australian colonies.<br>
<br>
Your committee propose that the provisions of the intended local
enactment shall be made applicable to emigrants brought out under
the regulations of this society.<br>
<br>
Your committee have no hesitation in recommending these
resolutions for the adoption of your honourable House, and that
the sum of £10,000 out of the amount now in course of
transmission to England for emigration purposes, be held at the
disposal of the London Committee of the Colonisation Loan
Society, presided over by the Earl of Shaftesbury.<br>
<br>
With regard to the report from the immigration agent for 1851,
and the despatches from the Secretary of State, referred to your
committee, they are at present only enabled to observe that any
recommendations or regulations suggested in them which may be at
variance with any of the suggestions of your committee, which
refer to the suppression of the present bounty system and the
substitution in its stead of the more largely self-supporting
system recommended in this report, should give way to the views
of your committee on this most important subject.</blockquote>

<p class="negindent3"><i>An Act to regulate the Indenting of
Assisted Immigrants and others in the United Kingdom and
elsewhere, and their employment in this Colony for a certain time
after their arrival therein</i>.</p>
<br>
<blockquote><span class="a">Whereas</span>, the present system of
bounty emigration has become highly burdensome and impolitic, by
reason that the emigrants sent out under that system, at the cost
of the territorial revenue, are not required, on their arrival in
this colony, to take service, or to repay any portion of the
public money thus expended in providing-them with a passage to
this colony, and it is expedient that the said system should be
reformed: Be it therefore enacted, by His Excellency the Governor
of New South Wales, with the advice and consent of the
Legislative Council of the said Colony, as follows:<br>
<br>
I.&mdash;Every male of or above the age of fourteen years, and
every unmarried female of or above that age, who shall hereafter
be provided with a passage as an emigrant to this colony by Her
Majesty's Emigration Commissioners, and who shall not pay the
full cost of his or her passage, previously to his or her
embarkation to this colony, or the embarkation of the wife or
family of any such male emigrant, shall, before obtaining an
authority for such embarkation, sign an indenture in the form or
to the effect set forth in the Schedule A to this Act annexed:
Provided that no emigrant of the class of country mechanics shall
be required or bound to pay more than the sum of fifteen pounds
sterling for his passage, inclusive of any deposit made by him in
the United Kingdom under any regulation then in force, and that
no other class of emigrants shall be required or bound to pay
more than the sum of thirteen pounds sterling for his or her said
passage, inclusive as aforesaid.<br>
<br>
II.&mdash;If any immigrant so under indenture shall, on his or
her arrival in the colony, or within any period thereafter to be
prescribed by the immigration agent in this colony for the time
being, not exceeding fourteen days, pay to such immigration
agent, on behalf of the government, the full sum set against his
or her name in the said indenture, every such indenture shall
thereupon be cancelled, so far as it relates to every immigrant
paying such sum.<br>
<br>
III.&mdash;The immigration agent for the time being, or any
person deputed by him for that purpose, with the approbation of
the governor, shall have authority, with or without the consent
of any such immigrant, not so paying his or her passage-money, or
any balance due therefor, to make and sign in his or her name,
and on his or her behalf, a contract of service with any
competent employer for the term of two years, to be computed from
the day on which such contract is made and signed, by an
agreement in the form or to the effect in Schedule B to this Act
appended; and every such employer shall thereupon pay into the
hands of such immigration agent, for the use of the government of
the colony, half the amount then due to the government for the
passage of every immigrant so bound; and such employer shall
undertake to pay the balance of the passage-money required by the
regulations from such immigrant, at or before the expiration of
twelve calendar months from the making of such contract; such
employer being hereby authorised to deduct such payments, so to
be made, on behalf of any such immigrant, from his or her wages,
as such wages accrue or become due, by eight equal deductions
from the same, during such term of two years.<br>
<br>
IV.&mdash;Every immigrant serving an employer under any such
contract, may, at any time after the expiration of the first
year, cancel the same, by giving such employer three calendar
months' notice thereof, in writing, and by paying such employer
the amount of money then remaining due for his or her
passage.<br>
<br>
V.&mdash;It shall be lawful for any artificer, domestic servant,
handicraftsman, mechanic, gardener, servant in husbandry,
shepherd, herdsman, wool-sorter, coachman, groom, vine-dresser,
or other labourer, and also for any male or female, being above
the age of eighteen years, and for all and every other classes
and class of labourers, workmen, tradesmen, or artificers,
whether they be subjects of Her Majesty or of any foreign
country, by indenture or other agreement duly executed, to
contract with any person or persons about to proceed to or
actually resident in this colony, or with the agent or agents of
any such person or persons in the said colony, for any period not
exceeding the full term of five years.<br>
<br>
VI.&mdash;Every emigrant already under indenture, or hereafter
contracting, by indenture or otherwise, to serve any employer in
this colony, shall be liable to repay to such employer, any sum
which he or she may contract with such employer, or with any
agent of such employer, to repay, for whatever object advanced,
and whether his or her passage were paid for in the first
instance by such employer, or were paid by the said Emigration
Commissioners out of the public funds of this colony, and repaid
or secured by such employer to such commissioners, or to the
immigration agent of the said colony.<br>
<br>
VII.&mdash;It shall be competent to Her Majesty's Emigration
Commissioners by a written instrument, in the form or to the
effect in Schedule C to this Act appended, to engage on behalf of
the immigration agent of this colony for the time being, any boy
or girl of and above the age of thirteen years, from any orphan
or other public school or eleemosynary establishment in any part
of the United Kingdom, or from any parishes or boards of
guardians, or parents or guardians willing to contribute at the
rate fixed by the regulations towards their passage to this
colony; and the said commissioners shall be at liberty, if they
shall see fit, to contribute the remainder of their passage-money
not exceeding for any such boy or girl the sum of eight pounds
sterling out of any fund belonging to the said colony at their
disposal.<br>
<br>
VIII.&mdash;Such boys and girls, on their arrival in the colony,
may be bound by the immigration agent for the time being, by
indenture, in the form or to the effect in Schedule D to this Act
appended, to proper employers, who, upon the execution of any
such indenture, shall pay the balance of the passage-money due to
the government for such boys and girls; and shall enter into the
agreement for their due maintenance and support, and also for the
payment to them of wages at the rates and times in the said
indenture mentioned.<br>
<br>
IX.&mdash;If any owner or master of any ship or vessel shall
contract, in writing, with any emigrant, either from the United
Kingdom, or from any foreign country, for his or her conveyance
to any port in this colony, and any such emigrant shall engage
either to pay any portion of his or her passage-money, not
exceeding ten pounds, within six days after his or her arrival,
or to execute within the same period, with the concurrence of the
emigration agent of this colony for the time being, or his
deputy, an indenture of service for two years, to some competent
employer, at such rates of wages as may be agreed upon between
the parties, or as the immigration agent may deem reasonable, and
by which the employer engages, upon the execution thereof, to pay
or secure the amount of passage-money remaining due from such
emigrant; then every such emigrant shall be held bound to the due
fulfilment of such contract, in the same manner, and subject to
the same penalties and punishment for non-performance, as if he
or she had arrived under indenture to Her Majesty's Emigration
Commissioners in England, under the provisions of this Act.<br>
<br>
X.&mdash;The provisions of this Act shall extend and apply, as
far as the same can be applied, to all contracts and indentures,
entered into in any part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland, by any emigrant brought out to this colony at the
expense of any society organised or established in any part
thereof for the promotion or encouragement of emigration to this
colony, and to all contracts or indentures of service or
apprenticeship which may be entered into by any emigrant or
apprentice after their arrival here, with a view of repaying or
securing to any such society the whole or any part of the
passage-money of any such emigrant or apprentice.<br>
<br>
XI.&mdash;All such indentures, or other written agreements as are
hereinbefore mentioned, shall, in all courts, and before all
justices within the said colony, be deemed to be valid, in
whatever country they may be executed, and shall be of the like
force and effect within this colony, as if they had actually been
made and executed by the respective parties thereto within the
same; and every such contract of service or indenture of
apprenticeship as hereinbefore mentioned, executed by the
immigration agent for the time being of the said colony, whether
executed or not by the party to be bound thereby, or with or
without his or her consent, shall be as valid and binding on such
party as if the same had been executed by such party, or by any
parent, guardian, or other lawful authority by or on his or her
behalf, and shall subject such party for any breach thereof, or
of any condition or contract therein contained, upon summary
conviction by or before two or more justices, to the like tines,
penalties, and punishments as are now or may be hereafter
provided by law for any wilful violation of the provisions of any
ordinary contract of service or indenture of apprenticeship, or
for any misdemeanor, miscarriage, misconduct, or ill-behaviour of
any master, servant, or apprentice within the said colony; and if
any such party, whether he or she be of the full age of
twenty-one years or not, shall abscond from the service of any
employer to whom he or she shall be under such contract of
service or indenture of apprenticeship, as hereinbefore
mentioned, without lawful excuse, shall be liable for a first
offence to imprisonment, with or without hard labour, at the
discretion of the convicting justices, for a period not exceeding
three calendar months; and for every subsequent offence to
imprisonment with or without hard labour, for any period not
exceeding six calendar months; and the periods of such absconding
and imprisonment shall not be deemed to be a part of the term of
service mentioned in any such contract of service or indenture as
aforesaid.<br>
<br>
XII.&mdash;Any person who shall employ, retain, harbour, or
conceal any immigrant of any of the classes or descriptions
mentioned in this Act, during the time such immigrant shall be
under contract to serve any employer in this colony, who shall
have paid, or come under engagement to pay, the whole or any
portion of the passage-money of any such immigrant, shall be
liable to pay such employer at the rate of five shillings a day
for every day such immigrant may be so employed, retained,
harboured, or concealed by any such person, up to the full amount
or sum not exceeding fifteen pounds, which such employer may have
so paid, or came under engagement to pay; and every complaint for
so employing, retaining, harbouring, or concealing any such
immigrant, may be heard and determined in a summary way before
any two justices of the peace, who, in addition to any damages
they may award, by virtue of this Act, may give the complainant
full costs: Provided always, that if upon the hearing-of any
information under this section any person so employing,
retaining, harbouring, or concealing any such immigrant, shall
prove to the satisfaction of the justices hearing the same, that
he has not been guilty of undue negligence, such information
shall be thereupon dismissed.<br>
<br>
XIII.&mdash;Every indenture or other written agreement officially
transmitted to the immigration agent of this colony, by Her
Majesty's Commissioners for Emigration in England, shall be
conclusive evidence in any court or before any justices, of the
signature or consent of the several parties thereto, whose names
are therein or thereunder written or mentioned, and shall require
no further proof of its authenticity than its production in any
such court, or before any justices, by or on behalf of such
immigration agent, or by or on behalf of the employer of any such
immigrant; and any certificate under the hand of the said
immigration agent that any such immigrant came out as such in any
vessel bringing out assisted immigrants, shall be receivable in
any court, or before any justices, and shall be conclusive as to
the identity of such immigrant, and as to all the facts therein
certified to be true.</blockquote>
