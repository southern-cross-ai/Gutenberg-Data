<h1>A STRANGER IN BOHEMIA<br>
<small>A "GIPSY" STORY</small></h1>
<h3>ILLUSTRATED BY CHARLES J. CROMBIE</h3>
<h3>Published in <i>The Windsor Magazine</i>, Vol XLI, May 1915, pp 779-
785</h3>
<hr>
<p>THE little man with the snaky hair and deep-set eyes, sitting in the corner
of the canteen, was known to all and sundry as "Gipsy." To the uninitiated this
title, of course, had no geographical significance. To the casual, Gipsy was no
more than a foreman ganger employed upon the great new water system at
Penguilt; but there were men working there who could have told you that, in the
freemasonry of the craft, the name of Gipsy carried from the Golden Gate to the
Yukon Valley, and from the Nile to the Amazon. The little man sitting there,
drinking his beer and smoking something particularly painful in the way of a
cigarette, was Bohemian to his blunt finger-tips. He would have resented the
suggestion that he was anything but an Englishman, though his looks belied him,
and the Zingari in his blood drifted him from time to time all over the world.
He was a master of argot in many languages; he had its slang and its illusive
profanities on the tip of his tongue. Wherever the spade and the drill and the
dynamite cartridge carried in the making of the world's highways, you could
have put Gipsy down over a gang of men, be they white or black, orange or
copper-coloured, and he would have handled them, too, and they would have known
that they had a man over them from the word "Go!"</p>
<p>Gipsy, therefore, was a celebrity in his way. Great captains of industry
knew him by name; they encountered him from China to Peru, so that he formed
the link between East and West, and in a way was proud of it. Gipsy might have
made money had he been less generous and not quite so romantic. For there was a
strong vein of sentiment in the little man, who, had he been blessed with the
advantage of education, would most assuredly have made a name for himself as a
dramatist. He was a Sardou without power of expression, a Shakespeare in
embryo, lacking the gift of the written word. As a matter of fact, he could
hardly write his own name; but he <i>could</i> plot and plan, and many a comedy
had been played in the Settlement which had not been rehearsed from the written
scrip.</p>
<p>There was nothing that Gipsy liked better than the weaving of romances in
which he played the leading part. And to his credit, be it said, most of them
were founded upon fact. There were those amongst the tough brotherhood of the
pick and shovel who implicitly believed all that Gipsy said, and on the other
hand were ranged the cynical, who spoke of him frankly and luridly as a liar.
But this is essentially a penalty of greatness, and touched Gipsy not at all.
In one respect, however, even the most doubting regarded Gipsy with veneration:
he was by far the most gifted and accomplished poacher amongst the ten thousand
odd gathered together there amongst the mighty reservoirs carved out of the
hillsides of Penguilt. Everybody knew this, and Gipsy was flattered
accordingly. There were trout and salmon there, partridges and pheasants, and
grouse, too, on the upper moors. Gipsy looked after himself all right, and the
mess-mates in his hut, but to the rest of them he was profoundly and almost
eccentrically modest.</p>
<p>He talked fast enough&mdash;in fact, he was always talking&mdash;but not
about the best way to circumvent the wily salmon or the elusive trout, and the
more silent Gipsy was on these points, the more sure were his satellites when
he was planning some wily campaign on his lordship's preserves. He was talking
now, telling one of his stories in which he was playing the hero, as usual. It
was hard on the time when Gipsy usually embarked upon his third pint of beer,
and his mood had reached the softened and sentimental stage.</p>
<p>"I am tellin' you no word of a lie, mates," he said. "There is a poet as I
once 'eard on as said somethin' about flowers what was meant to blush unseen. I
read that bit in a paper as come my way about fifteen year ago, when we was
makin' that dam for the Russian Government out in Manchuria. Remember it,
Joe?"</p>
<p>The man addressed as Joe nodded over his pipe. One of the beauties of
Gipsy's stories was their verisimilitude. He rarely embarked upon a romance
without the presence of some witness who could speak geographically. Therefore
Joe nodded.</p>
<p>"I made a tidy bit o' money them times," Gipsy went on. "I couldn't well
spend it, and it began to pile up, till I'd sent 'ome nigh on seven 'undred
quid in about three year. And then I begins to ask myself what I should do with
it. Not but what I'd got an idea in me 'ead. Fust-rate idea for a play it were,
too. It was all about a gel&mdash;a little gel as I picked up on them plains of
Manchuria. She wasn't nothin' more than a peasant's kid as 'ad been abandoned
by 'er father and mother in consequence of a bit of a scrap what 'ad taken
place between some Manchus and a tribe of Chinese pirates. Found 'er in a
burnin' 'ut, I did, wrapped up in a bit o' blanket. Funny thing, but that kid
took to me from the first. And blowed if I 'adn't got my 'eroin' fust
'and!"</p>
<p>"Lor, what a liar it is!" an admiring voice came from the background. "But
go on, Gipsy, cough it up."</p>
<p>"I was about to do so," Gipsy said, with some dignity. "And if you don't
believe as that scrap took place, ask ole Joe 'ere."</p>
<p>Joe gave the desired assurance, and Gipsy resumed.</p>
<p>"As I was a-sayin'," he went on, "there was my 'eroin' all ready-made. What
did I do with 'er? Why, adopted 'er, of course! I 'ad to put off the play, but
that didn't matter. Now, mind, I'd got a tidy bit o' money put by, which I was
pretty certain to do in fust time we got back to England.</p>
<p>So I goes to one of our engineers what 'ad got a missus and kids out yonder,
and I puts it afore 'im plain. I tells 'im as that little nipper, what might
'ave been about four year old, was goin' to be my heiress."</p>
<p>A burst of laughter followed, but Gipsy went on gravely.</p>
<p>"I wanted that kid sent over to England to eddicate. And our engineer 'e
says: 'Good iron!' Says that I should only make a fool of meself if I kept the
money. So I passes it all over to 'im, and 'e agrees to spend it at the rate of
about a 'undred quid a year on the kiddie's eddication, and, what's more, 'e
does it. Now she is a lady, a real proper lady, as swanks about in 'er silks
and satins, and mixes regular with the nobs. Fit to go into any 'ouse in the
kingdom, she is. They tells me at the present time as she's governess to the
daughters of a bloomin' earl. Lives in the 'ouse with them, and is regular one
of the family. She's dark and she's beautiful and she's 'aughty, and I ain't
sure as a lot more earls ain't on their bended knees askin' 'er to marry
them."</p>
<p>"Ain't 'e a knock-out?" a voice in the tobacco fog said, appealing. "Ain't
'e better than a Sunday piper? Ever stay with 'er, Gipsy? Ever put in a
week-end at one of them castles?"</p>
<p>"We 'ave never met," Gipsy said loftily. "My adopted daughter 'as not seen
'er toil-worn parent. Probably she never will. Who am I that I should stand in
the girl's way? Why should I drag 'er down to my sordid level? It's what some
newspapers call a perlite fiction that I am dead, and that in future the
beautiful orphan will 'ave to rely upon 'erself for 'er daily bread."</p>
<p>"She might be able to lend yer a bit," a practical member of the audience
suggested. "If she gets spliced to one o' them dooks you spoke of, she ought to
be good for a couple o' quid a week. But it's all lies! We are a set o' fools
to listen to it all. And yet, when you begins to tell one o' these 'ere stories
o' yours, I am never quite sure whether you are a blithering liar or not!"</p>
<p>Gipsy smiled with the air of a man who is the recipient of some graceful and
well-chosen compliment. He knew that he was holding his audience in spite of
themselves, and these cynical lapses into common-sense were really attributes
to his powers. One man, a little less easily moved than the rest, jeered
openly.</p>
<p>"Wery good," he said. "But yer story don't go far enough, mate. There's few
chaps in this camp what knows the Surrey Theatre and the old Britannia better'n
me. I've seen that 'eroin' o' yours 'undreds o' times. Why, you're the bloke as
she finds dying in a work'ouse, or drags into the marble 'alls by the scruff o'
the neck on a snowy Christmas Eve! She calls you 'er benefactor, and 'er
husband, the dook, shakes you by the 'and and fills you up with port wine and
roast goose. So far it's all right, Gipsy. But you've got to 'ave somethin' as
proves your indemnity."</p>
<p>"That proves my <i>what</i>?" Gipsy asked. "Lor, what an ignorant set o'
blokes you are! Meanin' my identity, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"Well, that's just wot I said," replied the other man diplomatically.
"You've got to 'ave a mark o' some sort&mdash;a wound as you got when you
rescued 'er from the fire, or perhaps a photograph."</p>
<p>Gipsy smiled in a superior fashion.</p>
<p>"I thanks the right honerable gentleman for makin' the remark," he said.
"He's been good enough to call me a liar. Well, I can't show no
wounds&mdash;that's wot they calls scars in the play&mdash;but the photograph's
all right. 'Ere, wot price this?"</p>
<p>From a capacious inner pocket Gipsy produced a stiff leather case, from
which he took a framed photograph. It represented a girl on the eve of
womanhood, a tall dark girl in evening-dress, with a face serenely beautiful
and faintly smiling. She seemed typically one of the upper classes, essentially
to the manner born, with that elusive suggestion of superiority that makes the
thing which, for want of a better word, they call a lady. For a moment Gipsy
regarded it with a certain reverent affection. Grudgingly he released it from
his horny thumb and forefinger and passed it round amongst his mates.</p>
<p>"There yer are," he said defiantly, "that's the lidy. And if anybody 'ere
calls 'er anythin' else, I'll push his fice in!"</p>
<p>There was no occasion for the threat, for the spirit of cynicism had
vanished the moment that Gipsy had crowned his story with this startling piece
of circumstantial evidence. Even the man in the far corner was silent and
almost inclined to believe.</p>
<p>"Where's the lidy now?" a respectful voice asked.</p>
<p>"I dunno," Gipsy said shortly. "I got this photograph about two years ago,
and I ain't made no inquiries since. I ain't goin' to stand in the girl's way.
Some of these days there'll be a duchess or a countess as'll never know as she
owes 'er 'appiness to a common ole bloke named Gipsy."</p>
<p>With these dignified words, Gipsy collected his photograph and walked slowly
and sorrowfully out into the darkness. He conveyed a subtle impression that
deep and tender chords had been touched, that he was a strong, silent man who
wished to hide the full measure of his grief from the eyes of a cold and
unsympathetic world.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, this dramatic exit was a skilful ruse, born of the
knowledge that Gipsy was going up over the far side of his lordship's preserves
in search of a casual pheasant for the benefit of a sick friend. His gun was
concealed in the leg of his corduroy trousers, and he carried half a dozen
cartridges in his waistcoat pocket. He was not out to-night on a grand
scale&mdash;he merely wanted a brace of pheasants for the pot, and an odd bird
or two for the wife of a ganger down at Coomlyn. Therefore it behoved him to be
careful. He knew that the keepers were out in force, and the fact that they had
marked him down as a dangerous poacher added zest to the expedition. Gipsy had
poached game of all sorts in many lands, but never yet had that wily Bohemian
been laid by the heels.</p>
<p>It was the one thing he dreaded, the thing he was horribly afraid of. For
the sun on the hillside, the breeze in the trees, and the smell of the mouldy
woods, were just the breath of life to this son of Zingari. He was as strong as
a bull and as tough as leather, and impervious to pain, and yet three months in
gaol would have been the death of him. He would have pined and died, as an
eagle droops in a cage. The mere thought of captivity gripped him by the heart
and caused his footsteps to falter; but the call of the wild was too strong,
and the unseen force dragged him on till he stood ankle-deep in the fallen
leaves and saw the pheasants roosting overhead.</p>
<p>All his prudence had gone to the winds now; he raised his gun, and two of
the birds dropped like gorgeous stones at his feet. And at once the dank and
dripping wood became alive with men. Gipsy asked no questions&mdash;he was
hardly taken by surprise. He dropped to his knees and hid his gun cunningly.
Then he was on his feet again, flying headlong downhill for dear life. It was
not for him to show fight, for Gipsy was no lover of violence. He was a poacher
pure and simple, and all he wanted now was to obliterate his tracks and make
his way to freedom. He knew every inch of the ground&mdash;no woodman born on
the estate knew the covers better than he&mdash;for to him woodcraft was an
instinct, and it had come to him with the first breath of life.</p>
<p>He saw the enemy spread out like a fan, he saw the long-legged head-keeper
working round to the right to cut off his retreat. There was only one thing for
it, therefore, and that was to break through the big spinny, through a wide
belt of shrubs, and thence make a bold dash across the lawns in front of Lord
Llanwye's house. It was a counsel of despair, a forlorn hope, but Gipsy did not
hesitate. He ran on and on until his legs began to fail him and his heart beat
like a muffled drum. He was in sight of the house now, the long, low house all
in darkness save for the light glowing in the drawing-room windows.
Self-consciously, Gipsy could see that one of the drawing-room windows was open
to the lawn, though the blind was drawn down, and almost at the same moment he
could make out the lean form of the head-keeper lurking in the shadows at the
far end of the terrace.</p>
<p>For once in his life Gipsy knew the meaning of the word "fear." It was not
that he was physically afraid. But his imagination was at work, and he could
see himself within the four walls of a prison cell, pining for the open fields
and the smell of the good red earth. He was utterly spent for the moment, he
knew that he would be like ripe corn for the sickle of the long-legged keeper,
and a certain sense of desperation seized him. He did not even stop to think;
he crept across the terrace and, lifting the blind, walked straight into the
drawing-room of Llanwye Castle. Here was melodrama all ready and glowing to
Gipsy's hand.</p>
<p>He dropped the blind and looked around him with an admiring contemplation of
the finest stage-setting he had ever seen. Here was a magnificent room filled
with pictures and flowers and gleaming statuary, here were thick, luxurious
carpets, and everything blended into one harmonious whole under the half-dim
light of the shaded electrics. Never in his life had Gipsy imagined anything
like this, never in his wildest flights of imagination had he conjured up so
fair a scene. He had got himself in hand now; he was ready for the part that
Fate had thrown in his way.</p>
<p>For the moment, at any rate, he was the leading character on this
bewildering stage. He was the actor-manager who cannot sustain a whole drama by
himself, and Gipsy began to look round vaguely for something in the way of a
heroine. Therefore there was no surprise in his mind as he saw her arise from a
big ingle-nook and come slowly and majestically in his direction. She was young
and tall and willowy, as every properly constituted heroine should be; she was
serene and haughty and absolutely self-possessed. She seemed part and parcel of
that room, she was one to the manner born, a true patrician who had evidently
drifted down the primrose path of life in silk attire and with the world for
slave at her dainty feet. She was not in the least annoyed or angry or even
surprised. She was just a specimen of glorious womanhood, as far above Gipsy as
the star is above the moth. He stood there open-mouthed, drinking in her
glorious beauty, as yet unable to grasp the situation and fumbling for his cue.
It was up to her to speak first, of course; she had possession of the stage,
and he waited for her to begin.</p>
<p>She looked at him as if he had been some strange animal, some annoying
insect, a kind of human wasp to be driven out unmercifully. And then it came to
Gipsy like a flash.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" the girl asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I was out poachin', miss," he explained. "They got me into a tight
place, and so I just run in 'ere like a frightened rabbit. After 'is lordship's
pheasants, I was. You won't give me away, miss. I couldn't go to gaol, miss; it
'ud be the death of me. And I never did no real 'arm to anybody. Besides, if I
don't make a mistake, I am an old friend of yours."</p>
<p>The tall, slim figure standing there stiffened, a look of cold displeasure
came into the dark eyes.</p>
<p>"I think you are mistaken," the girl said. "My name is Trevelyan&mdash;Hilda
Trevelyan. I am governess to Lord Llanwye's children, and for the moment am in
charge of the house. And I am quite sure that I have never seen you
before."</p>
<p>By way of reply, Gipsy dived into his pocket and produced his precious
photograph. Without a word he handed it over to his companion, who looked at it
long and narrowly. It seemed to Gipsy that she was breathing a little faster,
and that the full red of her lips had lost a little of their colour. But she
gave no outward sign save that her dark eyes were fixed steadily on Gipsy's
face as if she were trying to read his story.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this?" she said. "Tell me the truth."</p>
<p>"Would I tell a lidy like you a lie?" Gipsy retorted. "I've been all over
the world, and I don't deny as I made a good bit o' money now and again. But I
never could keep it, 'cause I ain't that sort. And that's why I've got nothing
in the world as I values except the photo in that lily-white 'and of yours. It
was give to me by a gentleman what was called Mr. Masters. An engineer, 'e
was&mdash;one of my bosses in a job we 'ad years ago in Manchuria. Now I dare
say you may 'ave 'eard of this?"</p>
<p>"You are speaking of my guardian," the girl said coldly. "To all practical
purposes, Mr. Masters was my father."</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say 'e is dead, miss?" Gipsy said.</p>
<p>"He died a few years ago. Both he and his family were killed in China during
the revolution there. It seems a very strange thing that I should be standing
here discussing my most intimate affairs with a common poacher and a man I have
never heard of before. If you have any intention of blackmailing me&mdash;"</p>
<p>Gipsy thrilled. The drama was going splendidly, for here he was in the
centre of a most glorious stage, playing lead to the most exquisite of
heroines, and she was actually accusing him of blackmail. The woods and the
pheasants were forgotten now; the lurking foe outside ceased to exist.</p>
<p>"You touched me on me tenderest point," Gipsy said. "A woman in
distress&mdash;leastwise, I don't mean that. Look 'ere, miss, I knew you as a
kiddie. I've 'ad you in me arms many a time. And it was me as found you in a
burnin' 'ut, and me as 'ands you over to Mrs. Masters. An' a sweet pretty
little thing you was. And she takes yer to 'er 'eart, and they brings you up as
one of their family. For three years you lived with them out there. Many a time
'ave I come and watched you playin' together with the other children, afore you
was all sent over to school. Ah, 'e was a good friend to you, Mr. Masters was !
Few men would 'ave done as much. You might 'ave been one of 'is own kids, for
the way 'e behaved."</p>
<p>Gipsy pulled up suddenly, surprised and rendered a little uneasy by the
change that had come over the girl's face. It was no longer cold and haughty,
but the red lips were quivering and the dark eyes were swimming with unshed
tears.</p>
<p>"There is something wrong here," the girl said unsteadily. "Mr. and Mrs.
Masters were exceedingly good to me, but they were in no position to bring me
up and pay my education. They always told me that my benefactor had placed me
in their hands, with a sufficient sum of money to keep and educate me and equip
me for my struggle with the world. To that unknown benefactor I owe everything.
I was told that I was not to ask his name, and that he would make himself known
to me in good time. And all that I have done in return for so much kindness was
to send this photograph to Mr. Masters to forward to my best friend. Shortly
before he died he wrote and told me he had done so. And, well, I don't think I
need tell you any more. Is my benefactor dead, and did he ask you to bring that
photograph back to me? What was he like? You must have known him well, or he
would never have trusted you with my photograph. Describe him to me."</p>
<p>Gipsy drew a long, deep breath. The drama was proceeding apace, reeling off
beautifully and in accordance with the best traditions. It was the great hour
of Gipsy's life, the golden hour marred only by the reflection that it was
played without an audience. If some of the gang down at the canteen could only
see him now!</p>
<p>And yet there could be no curtain on the rigid lines laid down for the nice
conduct of conventional melodrama. Gipsy was too fine an artist for that; his
sense of the theatre amounted to genius. He could not take this fair creature
in his arms and let her sob her gratitude out upon his homely shoulder. For
here was a creature who, sooner or later, would take her pick of Britain's
belted earls and hand down those glorious features to future generations.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you, miss," Gipsy said. "Not as I'm goin' to mention no
names. The chap as found you in a burnin' 'ut was no more than a common navvy.
But he took a fancy to you, and as he 'ad saved a bit o' money, he asked 'is
boss to 'elp 'im. And 'e did. And 'e didn't ask nothin' in return; you never
saw a chap so surprised in 'is life as 'e was when Mr. Masters sent 'im this
'ere photograph. Whatever 'e'd done, that photograph paid 'im for. 'E told me
that when 'e&mdash;'e lay dyin' with 'is 'and in mine."</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure he is dead?" the girl asked unsteadily.</p>
<p>"Dead as doornails," Gipsy said solemnly. "Dead as a cartload of 'em. Buried
miles and miles away from 'ere at the bottom of a valley wot's now the centre
of a lake. You couldn't get at 'im not if you'd got a million o' money. The
last thing 'e told me, I was to find you out and give you back this photograph.
'E forgot to give me the address, but I knew I should find it somewhere. So if
you'll take it, miss, and let me go while it's safe&mdash;"</p>
<p>One of the unshed tears dropped from one of the dark eyes and splashed on
the face of the photograph.</p>
<p>"You may go, if you like," the girl said; "but I should prefer that you
retained the photograph for the present. There are a great many questions I
should like to ask you, but the servants may come in for the keys at any moment
now, and your presence here might be misunderstood. After you have finished
your work to-morrow, you will please come up here and ask for Miss Trevelyan. I
want you to come and have tea with me, because I'm not at all satisfied that I
have seen the last of my noble benefactor."</p>
<p>Gipsy stooped and lifted the slim fingers to his lips. He was anxious enough
to get away now, and anxious to leave with a most efficient curtain falling on
his exit. He knew that he had played his part properly&mdash;his correct
instinct told him that.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200801h-images/1200801h-01.jpg" alt=
"Gipsy lifted the slim fingers to his lips."></p>
<p>He kissed the slim fingers, then he thrust the window-blind on one side and
walked out into the night. In all his crowded life this was the greatest hour
that his star had ever shone upon. It was the play that had occupied his waking
dreams for many a year. For he, the hero, knew, and she, the heroine, knew,
too, though no word of explanation had passed between them. And to go back on
the morrow would be to spoil everything; it would be no more than a cheap and
tawdry anti-climax, a lurid tag torn from a penny novelette. To be sure,
Gipsy's mates down at the canteen would never know how fine a hero they had
nourished in their breasts, but that was a small matter by comparison.</p>
<p>"It can't be done," Gipsy told himself, as he turned his face homewards.
"Now, most people would go back and 'ave it out alone with a lot o' tears. Then
they'd drop into the canteen and discuss it over a gallon or two of
beer&mdash;and spoil everything. But that ain't the way of a man wot
