<br>
<small>24th JANUARY, 1793.</small></p>
<p>AT five o'clock in the morning I landed near the entrance of
our anchoring-place. Along the shore I observed blocks of
sand-stone, the decomposition of which had furnished the very
fine quartzose sand, on which I walked for some time.</p>
<p>The Esperance had already found a watering-place, in a little
cove to the north-west, where there was very good water, easily
procured. The brook that furnished it fell into the sea from a
height of more than three feet, so that it would readily run into
the long-boat through wooden troughs.</p>
<p>We soon reached the head of the bay, where we found a hut,
which the savages had constructed with much art. The ingenuity
with which they had disposed the bark that covered its roof,
excited our admiration; the heaviest rain could not penetrate it.
It had an opening in the side towards the sea, and curiosity
induced us to enter.</p>
<p>Some of the people on board the Esperance had told us, that
the evening before they had seen three natives, sitting round a
small fire, close to the hut, who, being frightened by the sound
of a gun discharged at a bird, had fled with precipitation. We
had soon another proof of their presence at this extremity of the
bay; and it appeared to us, that they came regularly to sleep in
this hut. In a very short time we repented our entering into it;
for the vermin that stuck to our clothes, bit us in a very
disagreeable manner.</p>
<p>The tide of flood had raised the sea to a height that enabled
it to slow within the land, where we saw on it many ducks; but
they would not let us approach within a considerable distance of
them. From their being thus afraid of man I infer, that they are
not safe from the attacks of the natives.</p>
<p>In the woods we found few insects; but for this we were amply
compensated when we returned to the sea-side. As the weather was
very fine, the infects had flown thither from all parts; and
among the great number of those that had attempted to cross the
bay, many termites, and various coleoptera, of very strange
shapes. The wind had driven them upon the sand, where we could
collect them with great ease.</p>
<p>Next morning, at day-break, we landed near the head of the
bay, whence we entered a large valley, which stretches to the
south-west, between some very high hills. From the top of one of
the highest we could see all the country, as far as the foot of
the great mountain, that bore north-west from our ships. The snow
still remaining on its summit, rendered the view very
picturesque, and by its contrast heightened the beautiful verdure
of the large trees, which appeared to grow on it with great
vigour.</p>
<p>Many species of <i>embothrium</i> were observed on the
declivity of the hills where we were. Lower down we perceived
springs of clear water, creeping out at several places, and
running into a lake; where I saw some pelicans, but unfortunately
I was able to fire at them only from a great distance. This lake
is in the midst of a large plain; the soil of which, in the
lowest parts, consists of clay, thoroughly drenched with water,
and covered with roots of different plants, which form a bad kind
of turf on a slaking bottom. Through this are openings in several
places a few feet broad, displaying a very thin mud, covered with
water. Near these bogs, I had the pleasure of collecting a great
number of plants, among which I remarked several new species of
<i>calceolaria</i> and <i>drosera</i>, (sun-dew.)</p>
<p>Continuing our walk, we soon had a vegetable mould under our
feet, which I found the same at more than half a yard deep
throughout the whole breadth of the valley. The temperature of
the climate would be extremely favourable to the cultivation of
most of the vegetables of Europe; and a few trenches, dug in,
proper places, would give a sufficient discharge to the water, to
drain almost all the marshes found there, and convert them into
fertile soil.</p>
<p>As night approached, we had reached the spot where we landed,
and saw there several heaps of oyster-shells, brought by the
natives, which had induced our fishers to search for them in the
bay. At low water they discovered, very near this place, an
oyster-bank, from which they took a large quantity; and the flood
brought in with it several species of ray, some of which they
caught also.</p>
<p>The whole of the 26th I spent in describing and preparing
every thing I had collected since our arrival in Rocky Bay. I was
astonished at the great variety of productions frill afforded me
by this part of New Holland, where I had been very diligent in my
researches for more than a month the preceding year; though, it
is true, several leagues from the places we had now visited, and
in a more advanced season, when a great number of plants, that I
now found, must have disappeared.</p>
<p>On the following morning, as soon as it began to dawn; we set
off, with the design of remaining on shore a couple of days,
resolving to pursue our researches to a considerable distance
from our place of anchorage. We landed in the south-west, and
followed a path, traced nearly in that direction by the natives,
where we observed tolerably recent marks of naked feet, among
which were some of very young children. No doubt, some families,
alarmed by our stay in Rocky Bay, had gone in quest of another
retreat, where they deemed themselves in more safety.</p>
<p>After an hour's walk, we rested in a low place, where the
waters from the neighbouring hills were collected. To several
species of <i>leptospermum</i> this moisture was so well suited,
that they had grown up to very large trees; though all that I had
hitherto found in other places were but little shrubs. Some here,
were more than thirty yards high, though the trunk was not eight
inches in diameter. One species was remarkable for its bark,
which was about an inch thick, and composed of a great number of
flakes, lying one over another, very easily separable, and as
thin as the finest Chinese paper. This singular organization of
the bark occurs only in New Holland; it is nearly the same in the
<i>eucalyptus resinifera</i>; and I had observed it also on the
south-west coast of this country, on two largo trees, one
belonging to the family of <i>protea</i>, the other to the
myrtles.</p>
<p>We soon found a current of air opposite to the strong breezes
from the south-west. Near we saw the marks of a fire, which
appeared to have been lately burning. The natives had left there
part of a stalk of <i>fucus palmatus</i> (the palmated or sweet
fucus,) which the natives eat, after they have broiled it, as we
had afterwards an opportunity of seeing.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* This species of sea-wrack, we are informed, is
eaten both in Scotland and Ireland, sometimes fresh, as a sallad;
but more frequently it is dried, rolled together, and chewed as
tobacco. In the Isle of Sky it is used as a
medicine.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>The south-west wind, which had been preceded by a great
descent of the quicksilver in the barometer, blew in the
afternoon in violent gusts, which brought on rain just as we
reached the sea shore near South Cape. Fortunately a shrub of the
rutaceous family afforded us an excellent sucker by its bushy
thickness. This shrub grows vigorously on these heights,
notwithstanding its being exposed to all the impetuosity of the
violent winds that prevail on these coasts.</p>
<p>To this new genus I have given the name of
<i>maxeutoxeron</i>.</p>
<p>The calyx is bell-shaped, and four-toothed.</p>
<p>The petals are attached to the bottom of the calyx.</p>
<p>The stamens, eight in number, are fixed to the receptacle.</p>
<p>The germen is oval. The style is not quite so long as the
stamens. The stigma has four divisions.</p>
<p>The capsule has four cells, each of which is formed of two
valves; and is covered with hairs.</p>
<p>Each cell contains two or three seeds, nearly spherical.</p>
<p>The leaves are opposite, rounded, covered with thick down, and
of a fallow colour underneath.</p>
<p>The flowers are solitary, and placed at the insertions of the
leaves.</p>
<p>To this shrub I give the name of <i>mazeutoxeron

<p>We walked some way to the north across hillocks of sand,
before we got down to the beach, the windings of which we
followed with great case for a considerable distance; but at
length we were stopped by a mountain, which terminated in a
cliff; where it advanced into the sea. We attempted to go round
it on the land side, but found it impossible to penetrate through
the thickets, by which it was environed.</p>
<p>Night coming on, we returned in search of a convenient place
to pass the night near a rivulet, which we had crossed. A thick
bush was the best shelter we could find; and this we increased by
the addition of branches from others, so that we expected to have
been perfectly secure against any inconvenience from the wind.
But the gale from the south-west blew so strong during the night,
that the rain penetrated our covering on all sides; and to
heighten our distress, the cold was very piercing, which drove
most of us near the fire, though there we were still more exposed
to the wet, than in our sort of hut.</p>
<p>28th. As soon as day broke, we quitted our uncomfortable
lodging, and crossed the downs, that surrounded us. To some
places, where the sand appeared lately to have fallen down, I
observed, that these sand hills appeared to rest partly on a very
hard steatite, of a dark grey colour, partly on sandstone.
Presently, after observed from the borders of the shore a very
large rock, standing, in the sea, and not far from the land,
which exhibited on all sides the same species of steatite. This
rock, which is very high, is pierced at one of its
extremities.</p>
<p>The waves had separated from the bottom of the sea much sponge
of the species called <i>spongia cancellata</i>, great quantities
of which we saw thrown upon the shore.</p>
<p>In the midst of these downs grew a new species of plantain,
which I call <i>plantago tricuspidata</i>, from the form of its
leaves. This must be reckoned among the most useful plants, which
this country affords for the food of man. The hope of finding
some vegetables fit to eat as sallad had induced the most
provident among us, to bring the necessary sauce, and the sallad
furnished by the leaves of this plant, which were very tender,
was highly relished by all the company.</p>
<p>Several kinds of grass, among which I noticed many new species
of fescue (<i>festuca</i>), served to bind the sand together. A
new <i>geranium</i>, with an herbaceous stalk, very small, and
with leaves deeply cut, was among the number of plants I
collected. It was the first plant of the genus, that I found in
this country.</p>
<p>I had observed several burrows made in the ground, where the
sand had sufficient solidity, but I knew not by what animal they
were formed; when a kangarou of a middle size started up at our
approach, and ran into one of them. We fired in several times,
hoping the smoke would drive him out, but he would not quit his
hole.</p>
<p>Several tracks of kangarous through a little wood routed the
ardour of two of our shooters, who were with us; and they soon
got sight of several of these animals in the midst of a meadow
watered by a delightful rivulet, but all of them were too shy to
be approached.</p>
<p>At length we got on board, greatly fatigued for want of sleep,
as we had not closed our eyes for more than forty hours.</p>
<p>29th. The four subsequent days I employed in visiting the
environs of the place where we lay at anchor. Toward the
south-south-east I found a fine tree, which appeared to me to
belong to the family of <i>conifer&aelig;</i>, judging by the
disposition of its stamens, and the resinous smell of every part;
but I was never able to procure any of its fruit, though I
afterwards saw several trees of the same kind. No doubt the
season was not yet far enough advanced; and the stamens, which I
observed, appeared to have remained ever since the preceding
year. I mention this tree, not only on account of the singularity
of its leaves for a tree of this family, for they are broad, and
deeply indented on their edges, but for their utility in making
beer. They afforded a bitter and aromatic extract, which I
imagined might be used as that of spruce; and on making a trial
of it with malt, I found that I was not mistaken.</p>
<p>This fine tree is often a yard in thickness, and twenty-five
or thirty yards high. Its wood is very hard, of a reddish colour,
and susceptible of a fine polish.</p>
<p>The thick woods we had to the north-north-west of our ships
furnished a great number of trees of a moderate height, which
grew extremely well, notwithstanding the shade of the vast
<i>eucalyptus globulus</i>.</p>
<p>I shall give some account of a new genus of the family of the
hypericums, which constituted the ornament of these solitary
places, and which I call <i>carpodontos</i>.</p>
<p>The calyx has four scarious leaves, united at the upper part;
they fall off as the corolla unfolds itself.</p>
<p>The corolla is formed of four petals, attached beneath the
germen.</p>
<p>The stamens are numerous, (thirty or forty.)</p>
<p>The germen is elongated, and surmounted with six or seven
styles, each of which has an acute stigma.</p>
<p>The capsule opens into six or seven valves, woody, cleft
internally throughout their whole length, and bidentated at their
superior extremity.</p>
<p>The seeds are few, and flattened.</p>
<p>This tree, which does not reach a height of more than eight or
ten yards, is but slender.</p>
<p>Its leaves are, oval; opposite, coriaceous, shining, and
covered with a thin film of resin, which transudes from the upper
part; the under part is whitish, and the lateral ribs are
scarcely perceptible on it.</p>
<p>I have given it the name of <i>carpodontos lucida</i></p>
.

<p>FEBRUARY 2d. We had planned a visit to the highest of the
mountains in this part of New Holland; the various sites of which
gave us hopes of a great number of new productions. Each of us
took provision for five days, which we presumed would afford us
sufficient time for our purpose. Accordingly we set off very
early in the morning, with a tolerable hock of biscuit, cheese,
bacon, and brandy, our usual more on distant excursions.</p>
<p>When we had proceeded about half way on the road we had before
taken, in our journey to South Cape, we found an extensive
opening through the woods, which facilitated our progress
westerly, as far as the foot of the hills, that we were obliged
to cross; and then we plunged into the mica of the woods, with no
other guide but the compass.</p>
<p>We directed our way to the north, advancing slowly from the
obstacles presented us at every step, by vast trees lying one
upon another. Most of these, blown down by the violence of the
winds, had torn up in their fall part of the soil that bore them;
others, that had fallen in consequence of their age, were every
where rotten, and the lower part of their trunks was frequently
seen standing amidst the wreck of their upper parts, that lay in
huge heaps around.</p>
<p>After a very laborious walk, we at length reached the summit
of a mountain, whence we perceived to the south the middle of the
roadstead of South Cape, and to the north-west the large
mountain, toward which we directed our reps.</p>
<p>Night soon obliging us to halt, we kindled a large fire, round
which we reposed; and a comfortable sleep dissipated the fatigues
of the day. We slept in the open air, for we should have found it
difficult, to construct a shelter in a short time among the large
trees, as their branches were mostly near the summit, and this
part of the forest was destitute of shrubs. We looked in vain for
some large trunks hollowed by fire; these are to be found only in
places frequented by the natives. We had seen a great number on
the borders of the sea, where we had observed mangy paths, which
the natives had cleared; but nothing gave us any intimation that
they had ever come into the midst of these thick forests.</p>
<p>The air was extremely calm; and about midnight I awaked, when,
solitary in the midst of these silent woods, the majesty of which
was half disclosed to, me by the feeble gleam of the stars, I
felt myself penetrated with a sentiment of admiration of the
grandeur of nature, which it is beyond my power to express.</p>
<p>3d. At day-break we resumed our journey in the same direction
as before. Our difficulties increased more and more. The trunks
of trees lying one upon another often presented an almost
impenetrable barrier, obliging us to climb to the uppermost, and
then to walk from tree to tree, at the hazard of a fall from a
considerable height; for several were covered with a spongy bark,
so wet with the damp continually prevailing in these thick woods,
that our path was extremely eery, as well as difficult.</p>
<p>The day was considerably advanced, when we arrived at the
summit of a mountain, from which we perceived the whole extent of
a long valley, which we had still to cross, before we could reach
the foot of the mountains, which we had set out to visit. The
intermediate space appeared to be about eighteen miles; and this
space was occupied by forests, as thick as those through which we
had just penetrated. It was to be apprehended, that it would take
us upwards of two days, to reach the end of our intended journey;
even if we were not retarded by extensive marshes, or other
obstacles, which we could not possibly foresee. It would require
nearly as long a time to return; and from this calculation, our
provision would be expended three days before the termination of
our journey. These forests in the mean time afforded nothing that
could contribute to our subsistence; and consequently we were
obliged to relinquish our design.</p>
<p>The great chain of mountains appeared to stretch from the
north-east to the south-west, through a vast extent of
country.</p>
<p>In the forests we had just traversed, we found the same kind
of stones which we had already met with towards South Cape.
Seeing this cape south by east, we took this direction, and went
to spend the night on the skirts of the forest, near a rivulet,
which runs to the foot of the mountains.</p>
<p>4th. The difficulty of penetrating through the woods, made, us
resolve in future to follow the shore as far as we could, and
avail ourselves of the openings that terminated on it, to proceed
into the interior part of the country. In this manner we could
traverse a considerable extent of ground in little time; but it
was necessary for us first to pass the cliff that projected into
the sea, and had stopped us a few days before. By fresh attempts
at length we succeeded, and, after surmounting the greatest
difficulties, we penetrated through the thick woods that opposed
our passage. On quitting these we were able to continue our
journey along the sea-side, the way being sufficiently easy, as
the mountain terminated at the shore by a gentle slope; but we
were soon obliged to climb over steep rocks, at the foot of which
the sea broke in a tremendous manner. This road, notwithstanding
its difficulty, was frequented by the natives, for we found in it
one of their spears. This weapon was no more than a very straight
long stick, which they had not taken the pains to smooth, but
which was pointed at each end.</p>
<p>The side of the mountains being exposed for a considerable
extent, we observed a horizontal vein of coal, the greatest
thickness of which did not exceed four inches. We noticed it for
the space of more than three hundred yards. The stratum beneath
it was sand stone; that above, a dark brown schist. From these
indications I presume, that excellent coal may be found in
abundance at a greater depth. It is well known, that the richest
mines of this fuel are commonly found beneath sandstone.</p>
<p>The rust, with which I perceived the water, that trickled from
the rocks, highly coloured, was the first indication these
mountains afforded me of their containing iron; but it was not
long before I found fine fragments of hematites of a bronze red
colour, and farther on an ochry earth of a tolerably bright red.
Small separate fragments of tripoli also were scattered about in
the way we took; probably separated from the higher strata, which
we could not distinguish, as they were covered by the earth that
tumbled down in large masses.</p>
<p>Several new species of <i>lobelia</i> grew out from the clefts
of the rocks, which became more and more steep. Some of them were
perpendicular cliffs, more than two hundred yards in height above
the level of the sea. Very recent marks of the earth having
tumbled down made us resolve to take our way through the woods,
and not to approach the cliffs again without the greatest
caution.</p>
<p>For some time we proceeded amid shrubs, most of which were of
the heath family (<i>erica</i>), or that of <i>diospyros</i>.</p>
<p>Our attention was soon called to a fearful sound, the
repetitions of which seemed to obey the motions of the waves, and
with the greatest astonishment we beheld the terrible spectacle
of the destructive effects of the sea, continually undermining
these cliffs. The base of an enormous rock was already buried in
the waves, while its summit was hollowed into a vast arch,
suspended at the height of more than two hundred yards, which, by
reverberating the sound, increased the noise of the reiterated
dashings of the impetuous waves that broke against its sides.</p>
<p>Having passed the first two capes to the west of South Cape,
we returned towards the latter, where we spent a very bad night,
for unfortunately we were at no great distance from some stagnant
waters, and the extreme calmness of the air exposed us to all the
fury of the moschettoes.</p>
<p>5th. Morning being the time of low water, we hoped to be
enabled, by its means, to procure some shell-fish, of which the
bad quality of our provision made us feel a pressing want; but
the breeze setting in from the sea disappointed us; by raising
the water nearly as high as it would have been at flood tide.
Thus we were obliged to content ourselves with our salt
provision.</p>
<p>The cascade at South Cape, from which a great deal of water
fell into the sea, when Captain Furneaux landed there, was nearly
dry at this time. From the marks of its bed, however, it was easy
to perceive that its run must be considerable in the rainy
season.</p>
<p>We found a dead seal on the shore, of the species called
<i>phoca monacus</i>. Two severe contusions on its head gave us
reason to suppose, that it had been driven against some rocks by
the violence of the waves, which it had not strength to
surmount.</p>
<p>Bending our course toward our anchoring-place; we found two
large pools to the east-north-east of South Cape; and as we went
round them, we saw on their borders several burrows of kangarous.
A new species of <i>utricularia</i> displayed its beautiful
flowers on the surface of their tranquil waters. I was astonished
that these stagnant pools did not. exhale a fetid smell, as is
usually the case; but it is probable; that the water is speedily
renewed by filtering through the ground.</p>
<p>It was three o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived on
board. One of the gunners of the Esperance, named Boucher, we
learned had died, during our absence, of a consumption.</p>
<p>6th and 7th. After haying described and prepared the subjects
of natural history, which I had collected the preceding days, I
employed the remainder of my time in visiting the low lands to
the south-east. The woods here were easily penetrated, as the
trees stood at some distance from each other. Almost every where
I found the soil an excellent mould. I cut specimens of several
sorts of wood, to find out the different uses for which each
might be employed. That fine, tree, which I imagine to be of the
coniferous family, and which I have already mentioned, gave
considerable resistance to the saw; no doubt it will furnish the
most compact timber of any of that family.</p>
<p>It had long been my wish, that the greater part of the seeds
we had brought from Europe, capable of succeeding in this
climate, might be Town on this part of the coast in a good mould
sufficiently watered; but on my return I saw with regret that a
very dry and very sandy spot, pretty near the head of the bay,
had been dug up and sown.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 8th, the gardener and I, with two
of the crew, set off for Port Dentrecasteaux, intending to spend
two days in examining its environs. We landed at the mouth of the
harbour, on its western side; and fortunately found ourselves on
a bank of oysters, of which we collected an abundant store.</p>
<p>It was with pleasure we saw once more a place, which we had
visited several times the preceding year. Most of the little
rivulets we had then met with, and even that where we procured
our water, were now dry.</p>
<p>We soon reached the head of the harbour, and found, as we
proceeded up the river, very close and marshy thickets, which
often retarded our progress.</p>
<p>Snakes are not common at Diemen's Cape, yet I saw two,
sleeping in the sun, on large trunks of trees; on our approach
they withdrew into the hollow trunks, that served them for a
retreat. They were of the species I had found the year before,
which is by no means dangerous.</p>
<p>Though the course of the river was obstructed by large trees
at almost every step, we were obliged to go up it near a mile and
half, before we could find one, by means of which we could cross
to the opposite bank without too great difficulty.</p>
<p>From this place we proceeded north-east, traversing very
commodiously a spacious plain, part of the vegetables growing on
which had lately been burned by the natives. In a short time we
reached the head of the great lake, along the borders of which we
walked as far as the sea, and having travelled over a
considerable extent of ground, we returned to its extremity, to
spend the night near a rivulet, which we had already crossed. As
the weather was very fine, we lay down to sleep in the open air,
sheltered solely by large trunks of trees; that lay on the
ground; but the piercing cold we felt soon obliged us to kindle a
large fire.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that the temperature of the air, at this
extremity of New Holland, is sometimes 17&deg; lower in the night
than it was in the day. (From 23&deg; to 6&deg; of the mercurial
thermometer graduated according to Reaumur, which is always to be
understood). In fact this narrow land, lying in a pretty high
latitude, is not very capable of long retaining the heat, which
has been imparted to it by the rays of the sun. This great
difference of temperature was very inconvenient to us, as it
obliged us to encumber ourselves with clothes, which we found
very troublesome in the day. I must observe, however, that the
variation of the thermometer on board at the same time did not
exceed 5&deg; or 6&deg;.</p>
<p>9th. As soon as day-light appeared, while the two men that
accompanied us were full asleep, the gardener and I proceeded
towards the part of the lake opposite that which we had visited
the evening before.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of collecting several species of
<i>mimosa</i> with simple leaves, all the parts of fructification
of which were unfolded. I had already some specimens, but they
were very impeded.</p>
<p>After walking at least a couple of miles, we fancied we heard
human voices before us. Redoubling our attention, we advanced a
few steps, When a sudden cry, arising from several voices united,
issued from one spot, and we perceived through the trees a number
of the natives, most of whom appeared to be fishing on the
borders of the lake. As we were unarmed, and ignorant of their
intentions, we did not hesitate to return to our companions, each
of whom had a musket; and immediately crossed through the wood,
that the savages might not see us, lest they should be tempted to
pursue us, on perceiving our flight.</p>
<p>When we had told our men the occasion of our return, I
expressed my strong desire to have an interview with these
people. It was necessary first, however, to prepare our means of
defence, so that we might be able to avail ourselves of them in
case of an assault. Accordingly we got ready a few cartridges, as
fast as we could, and set out towards the place, where we had
seen the natives. It was now only nine o'clock. We had gone only
a few steps before we met them. The men and youths were ranged in
front, nearly in a semi-circle; the women, children, and girls,
were a few paces distant behind. As their manner did not appear
to indicate any hostile design, I hesitated not to go up to the
oldest, who accepted, with a very good grace, a piece of biscuit
I offered him, of which he had seen me eat. I then held out my
hand to him as a sign of friendship, and had the pleasure to
perceive, that he comprehended my meaning very well; he gave me
his, inclining himself a little, and raising at the same time the
left foot, which he carried backward in proportion as he bent his
body forward. These motions were accompanied by a pleasing
smile.</p>
<p>My companions also advanced up to the others, and immediately
the bet understanding prevailed among us. They received with
great joy the neck-cloths which we offered them; the young people
approached nearer to us; and one of them had the generosity to
give me a few small shells of the whelk kind, pierced near the
middle, and strung like a necklace. This ornament, which he
called <i>canlaride</i>, was the only one he possessed, and he
wore it round his head. A handkerchief supplied the place of this
present, gratifying the utmost wishes of my savage, who advanced
toward me, that I might tie it round his head for him, and who
expressed the greatest joy, as he lifted his hand up to feel it
again and again. We wore abundance of clothes, as I have already
observed, on account of the coldness of the nights; and we
bestowed the greater part on these islanders.</p>
<p>The women were very desirous of coming nearer to us; and
though the men made signs to them, to keep at a distance, their
curiosity was ready every moment to break through all other
considerations. The gradual increase of confidence, however, that
took place, obtained them permission to approach. It appeared to
us very astonishing, that in so high a latitude, where, at period
of the year so little advanced as the present, we already
experienced the cold at night to be pretty severe, these people
did not feel the necessity of clothing themselves. Even the women
were for the most part entirely naked, as well as the men. Some
of them only had the shoulders and part of the back covered with
a kangarou's skin, worn with the hair next the body; and among
these we observed two, each of whom had an infant at the breast.
The sole garment of one was a strip of kangarou's skin, about two
inches broad, which was wrapped six or seven times round the
waist; another had a collar of skin round the neck; and some had
a slender cord bound several times round the head. I afterwards
learned, that most of these cords were fabricated from the bark
of a shrub of the spurge family, very common in this country.</p>
<p>A pole-axe, which we used for cutting off some branches from
the trees, excited the admiration of these people. As they
perceived us willing to give them any thing in our possession,
they did not scruple to beg it; and when we granted their
request, they were overcome with joy. They were fully sensible of
the value of our knives, likewise; and received a few tin vessels
with pleasure. When I shewed them my watch, it attracted their
desire; and one of them, in particular, expressed his wish to
possess it; but he quickly desisted from his request, when he
found, that I was not willing to part with it.</p>
<p>The readiness with which we gave them our things, no doubt,
led them to presume, that they might take any thing belonging to
us, without asking for it: this obliged us to set bounds to their
desires; but we found, to our great satisfaction, that they
returned to us, without the least resistance, such things as we
could not dispense with for our own use.</p>
<p>I had given them several articles, without requiring any thing
in return; but I wished to get a kangarou's skin, when, among the
savages about us, there happened to be only a young girl, who had
one. When I proposed to her, to give it me in exchange for a pair
of pantaloons, then ran away, to hide herself in the woods. The
other natives appeared truly hurt at her, refusal, and called to
her several times. At length she yielded to their intreaties, and
came to bring me the skin. Perhaps it was from timidity only,
that she could not prevail on herself to part with this kind of
garment; in return for which the received a pair of pantaloons,
less useful to her, according to the customs of the ladies in
this country, than the skin, which served to cover the shoulders.
We shewed her the manner of wearing them; but, notwithstanding,
it was necessary for us, to put them on for her ourselves. To
this she yielded with the best grace in the world, resting both
her hands on our shoulders, to support herself, while she lifted
up first one leg, then the other, to put them into this new
garment. Desirous of avoiding every cause of offence, we behaved
with all the gravity we could on the occasion.</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE VI. <i>Woman of Van Diemen's Land</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>This party of savages consisted of two-and-forty, seven of
whom were men, eight women; the rest appeared to be their
children; and among these we observed several marriageable girls,
still less clothed than most of the mothers. We invited them all
to come and sit near our fire; and when they arrived there, one
of the savages informed us by unequivocal signs, that he had come
to reconnoitre us during the night. That we might understand he
had seen us asleep, he inclined his, head on one side, laying it
on the palm of his right hand, and closing his eyes; and with the
other he pointed out the spot, where we had passed the night. He
then acquainted us, by signs equally expressive, that he was at
the time on the other side of the brook, whence he observed us.
In fact, one of us had been awakened about the middle of the
night by a rustling among the branches, and had even fancied,
that he heard some broken off: but, being greatly fatigued, he
had soon fallen asleep again, persuaded it was a kangarou, that
had come to visit us. Our fire had been a guide to this native,
whom the party had seat to reconnoitre us; while we had slept
with the utmost tranquillity, notwithstanding we had been at the
mercy of these savages the whole night. One of the men that
accompanied us, then said, that in the evening, at sun-set, he
perceived some smoke on the other side of the lake, whence he
presumed, that some of the natives were assembled there; but he
forgot to mention it to us, when we joined them.</p>
<p>We were desirous of showing these savages the effects of our
fire-arms, after having given them to understand, that they had
nothing to fear. They appeared, however, to be a little
frightened at their report.</p>
<p>These people have woolly hair, and let their beards grow.
Plates VI, VII, and VIII, will give more accurate ideas of their
persons, and exhibit the characteristics that distinguish them
more strikingly, than a long and minute description. It may be
observed (Plate VII), that in the children the upper jaw advances
considerably beyond the lower; but sinking as they grow up, both
jaws are nearly even in the adult. Their skin is not of a very
deep black; but no doubt they consider extreme blackness as a
beauty, for, in order to heighten this colour beyond its natural
state, they rub themselves over, particularly on the upper parts
of the body, with powdered charcoal.</p>
<p>On their skin, particularly on the breast and shoulders, may
be observed tubercles symmetrically arranged, exhibiting
sometimes lines four inches in length, at other times points
placed at different distances. The application, by which these
risings were produced, had not destroyed the cellular membrane,
however, for they were of the same colour as the rest of the
skin.</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE VII. <i>Man of Van Diemen's Land&mdash;Child of Van
Diemen's Land</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>The custom of extracting two of the front teeth of the upper
jaw, which, from the accounts of some voyagers, had been supposed
general among the inhabitants of this country, certainly has not
been introduced into this tribe; for we did not see one among
them, in whom a single tooth of the upper jaw was wanting; and
indeed they had all very good teeth.</p>
<p>One of the sailors, that accompanied us, thought he could not
regale them better than with a glass of brandy; but, accustomed
to; drink nothing but water, they quickly spit it out, and it
seemed to have given them a very disagreeable sensation.</p>
<p>These savages, going completely naked, are liable to wound
themselves, particularly in the lower extremities, when they pass
through the woods. We observed one, who walked with difficulty,
and one of whose feet was wrapped up in a piece of skin.</p>
<p>I had not perceived the young girls for some time, and
imagined that they had all retired into the woods; but happening
to look behind me, I saw, with surprise, seven who had perched
themselves on a rout limb of a tree; more than three yards from
the ground, whence they attentively watched our slightest
movements. As they all squatted on the bough, they formed a
pleasing group.</p>
<p>We were at, a considerable distance from the shore, where a
boat was to wait for us, to take us on board. It was time for us
to be on our way toward it. We were quitting this peaceable party
with regret, when we saw the men and four of the youths
separating from the rest, iii order to accompany us. One of the
most robust presently went into the wood, whence he returned
almost instantly, holding in his hand two long spears. As he came
near, he made signs to us, that we need be under no
apprehensions; on the contrary, it appeared as if he were
desirous of protecting us with his arms. No doubt they had left
their weapons in the wood, when they came to meet us in the
morning, that they might give us no alarm.</p>
<p>The other natives, whom we, had just quitted, approached our
party. Immediately on our requesting him, who carried the spears,
to give us a specimen of his dexterity, he grasped one of them
with the right hand near the middle, then raising it as high as
his head, and holding it horizontally, he drew it back toward
himself three times following with a jerk, which gave it a very
perceptible tremulous movement at each extremity, when he darted
it forward near a hundred paces. The weapon, supported throughout
its whole length by the column of air beneath it, flew in a
tolerably horizontal direction more than three fourths of the
distance. The tremulous motion impressed on it contributed,
unquestionably, to accelerate its progress, and to support it
longer in the air.</p>
<p>The savage was very ready to gratify our wishes, by launching
his spear several times following. He then aimed at an object,
which we pointed out to him, and every time was near enough to
it, to give us a high idea of his skill. Presently after another
showed us two holes in a kangarou's skin, which had been made
apparently with the point of a spear, giving us thus to
understand, that they employed this weapon to kill these animals.
In reality, they launched it with sufficient force to pierce the
animal through and through.</p>
<p>At length we parted with our new guides, whose pace was
sufficiently flow for us to follow them with ease. It seemed as
if they were not accustomed to take a long walk without
interruption; for we had scarcely been half an hour on our way,
before they invited is to sit down, saying <i>m&egrave;di</i>;
and we immediately stopped. This halt lasted but a few minutes,
when they rose, saying to us <i>tangara</i>, which signifies "let
us set off". On this we resumed our journey; and they made us
halt again, in the same manner, four times, at nearly equal
distances.</p>
<p>The attentions lavished on us by these savages astonished us.
If our path were interrupted by heaps of dry branches, some of
them walked before, and removed them to either side; they even
broke off such as stretched across our way from the trees that
had fallen down.</p>
<p>We could not walk on the dry grass without slipping every
moment, particularly where the ground was sloping; but these good
savages, to prevent our sailing, took hold of us by the arm, and
thus supported us. We found it difficult to persuade them that
none of us would fall, even, if unassisted; and they continued,
nevertheless, to bestow on us these marks of affectionate
kindness; nay, they frequently stationed themselves, one on each
side, to support us the better. As they obstinately persisted in
paying us this obliging attention, we no longer declined it.</p>
<p>They no doubt conceived it to be our intention to return to
Port Dentrecasteaux, for we were twice mistaken in the road, and
they both times pointed out to as that which led directly to
it.</p>
<p>A trifling incident gave us reason to presume, that they
sometimes catch birds with their hands. A paroquet, of the
species figured in Plate X. which I shall describe presently,
flew by us, and pitched on the ground at a little distance.
Immediately two of the young savages set off to catch it, and
were on the point of putting their hands upon it, when the bird
took wing.</p>
<p>It may be presumed, that there are no snakes at Diemen's Cape,
the bite of which is to be dreaded; at least, if there be any
such, the natives well know how to distinguish them. They pointed
out one to us, gliding through the grass very near them, yet they
did not appear to be under the least apprehension from it.</p>
<p>At length they brought us near the place, where we had
anchored the year before. The oldest of then was very thirsty;
and immediately made one of the youths fetch him an oyster-shell,
to serve as a cup, which he emptied several times before his
thirst was quenched.</p>
<p>As we were very near the garden, which had been formed the
preceding year by Citizen Lahaye, gardener to the expedition, we
resolved to visit it; and took the opportunity, when the savages
had seated themselves. We wished to leave them with our two
sailors, lest they should go and do any injury to such vegetables
as might have succeeded; but one of them was resolved to
accompany us. He examined attentively the plants in the garden,
and pointed them out with his finger, appearing to distinguish
them perfectly from their indigenous vegetables. We saw, with
regret, that there remained only a small number of cabbages, a
few potatoes, some radishes, cresses, wild succory, and sorrel,
all in a bad condition: no doubt they would have succeeded
better, had they been sown nearer a rivulet, which we observed to
the west. I expected to have found some cresses at least sown on
its banks; that I did not must surely have been owing to
forgetfulness on the part of the gardener.</p>
<p>Our boat was not yet arrived. We were very desirous that these
savages should have a near view of it; and we hoped, likewise, to
be able to prevail on some of them to go on board with us; but
they were already leaving us to rejoin their families. At our
invitation, however, they deferred their departure, and we walked
together along the beach toward the entrance of the harbour. Some
trees, that lay on the ground along the shore, gave them an
opportunity of displaying their agility to us by leaping over
them. We were too much fatigued to give them an exhibition of
what we were capable of doing; but I believe, savages as they
were, they would have found themselves excelled by an European
tolerably expert at this exercise.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat came, we invited some of them to go on
board her with us. After taking a long while to resolve on it,
three of them contented to get into the boat; but it appeared
that they had no intention to quit their party, for they got out
again in great haste, as soon as we prepared to push off from the
shore.</p>
<p>We then saw them walk with tranquillity along the sea-side,
looking toward us from time to time, and uttering cries of
joy.</p>
<p>10th. The next day we returned in a large party to these
savages.</p>
<p>We rowed along the shore, beyond Port Dentrecasteaux, for some
time, when a fire we perceived not far from the sea-side induced
us to land.</p>
<p>Some of the natives soon came to meet us, expressing by their
cries the pleasure they felt at seeing us again.</p>
<p>Our musician had brought on shore his violin, imagining that
he should excite as much enthusiasm among them by some noisy
tunes, as we had observed in the islanders at Bouka; but his
self-love was truly mortified, at the indifference shown to his
performance here. Savages, in general, are not very sensible to
the tones of stringed instruments.</p>
<p>As we ascended the heights that skirt the sea, we soon found a
party of those natives, by whom we had been so civilly received
the day before. A lively joy was depicted on all their features,
when they saw us drawing near. There were nineteen of them, round
three small fires, making their meal on barnacles, which they
roasted on the coals, and ate as fast as they were ready. Every
now and then some of the women went to pick these shell-fish from
under the neighbouring rocks, and did not return till they had
filled their baskets with them. On the same fires we observed
them broil that species of sea-wrack, which is called <i>fucus
palmatus</i>, and when it was softened to a certain point, they
tore it to pieces to eat it.</p>
<p>The pains taken by one of the mothers to quiet her infant, yet
at the breast, who cried at the first sight of us, appeared to us
very engaging. She could not pacify him, till she covered his
eyes with her hand, that he might not see us.</p>
<p>None of these people appeared with arms; but, probably, they
had left them in the wood near for several of us having expressed
an intention of going into it, one of the savages urgently
entreated them not to go that way. Our people did not persist in
it, lest they should give them some cause of mistrust; part of
the boat's crew, however, in order to deceive the vigilance of
this centinel, walked a little way along the shore, that they
might enter the wood, without being observed by him; but no
sooner did one of the women perceive their design, than she
uttered horrible cries, to give notice to the other savages, who
intreated them to return toward the sea.</p>
<p>We did not know to what to ascribe their repugnance for our
viands, but they would taste none that we offered them. They
would not even suffer their children to eat the sugar we gave
them, being very careful to take it out of their mouths the
moment they were going to taste it. Yet their confidence in us
was so great, that one of the women, who was suckling a child,
was not afraid to entrust it to several of us.</p>
<p>I imagined that these people, passing most of their nights in
the open air, in a climate of which the temperature is so
variable, must have been subject to violent inflammations of the
eyes; yet all of them appeared to have their sight very good, one
only excepted, who had a cataract.</p>
<p>Some of them sat on kangarou skins, and some others had a
little pillow, which they called <i>ro&eacute;r&eacute;</i>, near
a quarter of a yard long, and covered with skin, on which they
rested one of their elbows.</p>
<p>We observed with surprize, the singular posture of the women,
when they sit on the ground. Though for the most part they are
entirely naked, it appears to be a point of decorum with these
ladies, as they sit with their knees asunder, to cover with one
foot, what modesty bids them conceal in that situation.</p>
<p>These people seemed to be so nearly in a state of nature, that
their most trifling anions appeared to me worthy of observation.
I shall not pals over in silence, therefore, the correction a
father gave one of his children, for having thrown a stone at the
back of another younger than himself; it was merely a light slap
on the shoulder, which made him shed tears, and prevented his
doing so again.</p>
<p>The painter to the expedition expressed to these savages a
with of having his skin covered like theirs with the powder of
charcoal. His request, as might naturally be supposed, was
favourably received; and immediately one of the natives selected
some of the most friable coals, which he ground to powder by
rubbing them between his hands. This powder he applied to all the
parts of the body that were uncovered, employing nothing to make
it adhere beside the rubbing of the hand, and our friend Piron
was presently as black as a New-Hollander. The savage appeared
highly satisfied with his performance, which he finished by
gently blowing off the dust that adhered very slightly, taking
particular care to remove all that might have gotten into the
eyes.</p>
<p>When we departed for Port Dentrecasteaux, more than half these
peaceable natives rose to accompany us. Four young girls also
were of the party, who received with indifference the garments we
gave them, and, that they might not be encumbered with an useless
burden, immediately hung them on the bushes near the path,
intending, no doubt, to take them with them on their return. As a
proof that they set little value on such presents, we did not see
on any of them one of the garments that we had given them the day
before. Three of these young women were marriageable, and all of
them were of very cheerful dispositions. In one of them it was
observed that the right breast had acquired its full size, while
the left was still perfectly flat. This temporary deformity had
no effect on the liveliness of her manner. They several times ran
races on the shore, which was very smooth, and some of us
endeavoured to catch them; when we had the pleasure to see, that
Europeans could frequently run better than these savages.</p>
<p>The men followed with a grave pace, each carrying his hands
resting one against the other upon his loins; or sometimes the
left hand passing behind the back, and grasping the right arm
about the middle.</p>
<p>No doubt we lost much by not understanding the language of
these natives, for one of the girls said a great deal to us; she
talked a long while with extraordinary volubility; though she
must have perceived that we could not comprehend her meaning no
matter, she must talk.</p>
<p>The others attempted more than once to charm us by songs, with
the modulation of which I was singularly struck, from the great
analogy of the tunes to those of the Arabs in Asia Minor. Several
times two of them sung the same tune at once, but always one, a
third above the other, forming a concord with the greatest
justness.</p>
<p>Amid these sands grew a species of ficoides, in almost every
point resembling the <i>mesembryanthemum edule</i>, or eatable
fig-marigold of the Hottentots. It differed completely in the
colour of the flowers, indeed, which were red, while those of the
fig-marigold of the Hottentots are yellow; but it bore fruit like
it, much resembling in flavour a very ripe apple. This fruit is a
delicacy among the New-Hollanders, who seek for it with care, and
eat it as soon as they find it.</p>
<p>During this long walk, some of our companions took us by the
arm from time to time to assist us.</p>
<p>One of the young girls having perceived at a distance a head,
which the gunner of the Esperance had carved on the stump of a
tree, appeared at first extremely surprized, and stopped short
for a moment. She then went up to it with us, and, after having
considered it attentively, named to us the different parts,
pointing them out at the same time with the hand.</p>
<p>Soon after we arrived at the entrance of Port
Dentrecasteaux.</p>
<p>Two of the young girls followed the different windings of the
shore without mistrust; at a distance from the other natives,
with three of out sailors, when these took the opportunity of one
of the most retired places, to treat them with a degree of
freedom, which was received in a very different manner from what
they had hoped. The young women immediately fled to the rocks
most advanced into the sea, and appeared ready to leap into it,
and swim away, if our men had followed them. They presently
repaired to the place, where we were assembled with the other
savages; but it seems they did not disclose this adventure, for
the most perfect harmony continued to prevail between us.</p>
<p>Wishing to know whether these islanders were expert swimmers,
one of our officers jumped into the water, and dived several
times; but it was in vain that he invited them to follow his
example. They are very good divers, however, as we had afterwards
an opportunity of seeing, for it is by diving they procure a
considerable part of their food. We invited them to eat with us
some oysters and lobsters, which we had just roasted on the
coals; but they all refused, one excepted, who tasted a lobster.
At first we imagined that it was yet too early for their
meal-time; but in this we were mistaken, for it was not long
before they took their repast. They themselves, however, dressed
their food, which was shell-fish of the same kinds, but much more
roasted than what we had offered them.</p>
<p>We observed some of the savages employed in cutting little
bits of wood in the form of a spatula, and smoothing them with a
shell, for the purpose of separating from the rocks limpets and
sea-cars, on which they feast as they get ready.</p>
<p>The time for our returning on board arrived, but none of the
natives would accompany us, they all leaving us, and retiring
into the woods.</p>
<p>11th. The engineer-geographer of the Recherche went in the
barge on the 11th in the morning, to examine the extent of the
vast bay that is at the entrance of Dentrecasteaux strait. For
this strait we were soon to set sail.</p>
<p>In the course of the day we quitted all the places we had
occupied on shore during our stay in Rocky Bay. The repairs of
both vessels were finished. The trial made the year before of the
wood of the <i>eucalyptus globulus</i>, induced our carpenters to
employ it in preference to the other species of the same
genus.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image7" id="Image7"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>PLATE X. <i>Black spotted Parroquet of Van Diemen's
Land</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>For my part I entered into the thick woods to the north-west
of us. Several species of shrubs, of the <i>pistacia</i> family,
grow under the shade of the large trees; and the <i>fagara
evodia</i> distinguished itself by its beautiful foliage. In
these gloomy places the eye rested with pleasure on the
<i>carpodontos lucida</i>, the branches of which were quite
covered with fine white flowers.</p>
<p>As I advanced toward the south-west, I crossed some open
spots, where I killed a beautiful species of paroquet, which I
distinguish by the name of the black-spotted paroquet of Diemen's
Cape (See Plate X.). I had already met with it in several other
places, but always such as were low, and destitute of covert.
Very different from the known species of the same genus, it does
not perch, for I uniformly observed it rise from among the grass,
on which it almost immediately settled again. The shape of the
feet, which are furnished with very long claws but little curved,
sufficiently indicate the manners of the bird. Its plumage is
green, spotted with black; some of the spots being surrounded
with little yellowish bands. The under part of the wings is
ashen-grey, with a broad band of pale yellow. Under the belly the
black and yellow predominate. The under feathers of the tail are
remarkable for transverse bands, alternately black and pale
yellow. A few small reddish feathers are observable at the bale
of the beak at the upper part of the superior mandible.</p>
<p>12th. The next day a great number of us, from both ships,
landed near Port Dentrecasteaux, to endeavour to see the savages
again. It was not. long before some of them came to meet us,
giving us tokens of the greatest confidence. They first examined
with great attention the insides of our boats, and then they took
us by the arm, and invited us to follow them along the shore.</p>
<p>We had scarcely gone a mile before we found ourselves in the
midst of eight-and-forty of the natives; ten men, fourteen women,
and twenty-four children, among whom we observed as many girls as
boys. Seven fires were burning, and round each was assembled a
little family.</p>
<p>The least of the children, frightened at the sight of such a
number of Europeans, immediately took refuge in the arms of their
mothers, who lavished on them marks of the greatest affection.
The fears of the children were soon removed; and they showed us,
that they were not exempt from little passions, whence arose
differences, to which the mothers almost immediately put an end
by slight correction; but they soon found it necessary to stop
their tears by caresses.</p>
<p>We knew already that these savages had little taste for the
violin; but we flattered ourselves that they would not be
altogether insensible to its tones, if lively tunes, and very
distinct in their measure, were played. At first they left us in
doubt for some time; on which our musician redoubled his
exertions, in hopes of obtaining their applause; but the bow
dropped from his hand, when he beheld the whole assembly stopping
their ears with their fingers, that they might hear no more.</p>
<p>These people are covered with vermin. We admired the patience
of a mother, who was a long while employed in freeing one of her
children from them; but we observed with disgust that, like most
of the blacks, she crushed these filthy insects between her
teeth, and then swallowed them. It is to be remarked, that apes
have the same custom.</p>
<p>The little children were very desirous of every thing shining,
and were not afraid to come up to us, to endeavour to pull off
our buttons. Their mothers, less curious with respect to their
own dress than that of their children, held them to us, that we
might decorate them with the ornaments which we had intended for
themselves.</p>
<p>I ought not to omit a waggish trick, which a young savage
played one of our people. The sailor had laid down a bag full of
shell-fish at the foot of a rock; the youth slily removed it to
another place, and let him search for it a long time in vain; at
length he replaced it where the sailor had left it, and was
highly diverted with the trick he had played him.</p>
<p>This numerous party was transported with admiration, when they
saw the effects of gunpowder thrown on the burning coals. They
all intreated us to let them have the pleasure of seeing it
several times.</p>
<p>Not being able to persuade themselves that we had none but men
among us, they long believed, notwithstanding all we could say,
that the youngest of us were women. Their curiosity on this head
carried them further than we should have expected, for they were
not to be convinced, till they had assured themselves of the
fact.</p>
<p>The women have adopted a mode which I imagine our belles will
never imitate, though it occasions the disappearance of a
considerable part of the wrinkles that pregnancy occasions. They
have the skin of the abdomen marked with three large semicircular
risings, one above the other whether from coquetry, or not, would
be difficult to determine.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image8" id="Image8"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>PLATE IV. <i>Natives of Van Diemen's Land fishing</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>One of the savages had several marks of very recent burns on
the head. Perhaps they employ the actual cautery in many
diseases, which is an established practice among various other
people, and particularly among most of the Indians.</p>
<p>About noon we saw them prepare their repast. Hitherto we had
but a faint idea of the pains the women take to procure the food
requisite for the subsistence of their families. They took each a
basket, and were followed by their daughters, who did the same.
Getting on the rocks, that projected into the sea, they plunged
from them to the bottom in search of shell-fish. When they had
been down some time, we became very uneasy on their account; for
where they had dived were sea-weeds of great length, among which
we observed the <i>fucus pyriferus</i>, and we feared that they
might have been entangled in these, so as to be unable to regain
the surface. At length, however, they appeared, and convinced us
that they were capable of remaining under water twice as long as
our ablest divers. An instant was sufficient for them to take
breath, and then they dived again. This they did repeatedly, till
their baskets were nearly full. Most of them were provided with a
little bit of wood, cut into the shape of a spatula, of which I
spoke above; and with these they separated from beneath the
rocks, at great depths, very large sea-ears. Perhaps they choose
the biggest, for all they brought were of a great size.</p>
<p>On seeing the large lobsters, which they had in their baskets,
we were afraid that they must have wounded these poor women
terribly with their large claws; but we soon found, that they had
taken the precaution to kill them as soon as they caught them.
They quitted the water only to bring their husbands the fruits of
their labour; and frequently returned almost immediately to their
diving, till they had procured a sufficient meal for their
families. At other times they staid a little while to warm,
themselves, with their faces toward the fire on which their fish
was roasting, and other little fires burning behind them, that
they might be warmed on all sides at once.</p>
<p>It seemed as is they were unwilling to lose a moment's time,
for while they were warming themselves, they were employed in
roasting fish; some of which they laid on the coals with the
utmost caution though they took little care of the lobsters,
which they threw any where into the fire, and when they were
ready, they divided the claws among the men and children,
reserving the body for themselves, which they sometimes ate
before they returned into the water.</p>
<p>It gave us great pain to see these poor women condemned to
such severe toil; while, at the same time, they ran the hazard of
being devoured by sharks, or entangled among the weeds that rise
from the bottom of the sea. We often intreated their husbands to
take a share in their labour at least, but always in vain. They
remained constantly near the fire, feasting on the best bits, and
eating broiled fucus, or fern-roots. Occasionally they took the
trouble to break boughs of trees into short pieces, to feed the
fire, taking care to choose the driest. From their manner of
breaking them, we found that their skulls must be very hard; for,
taking hold of the sticks at each end with the hand, they bent
them over their heads, as we do at the knee, till they broke.
Their heads being constantly bare, and often exposed to all
weathers, in this high latitude, acquire a capacity of resisting
such efforts: besides, their hair forms a cushion, which
diminishes the pressure, and renders it much less painful on the
summit of the head, than on any other part of the body. Few of
the women, however, could have done as much; for some had their
hair cut pretty short, and wore a string several times round the
head, others had only a simple crown of hair. (See Plates IV. and
V.) We made the same observation with respect to, several of the
children, but none of the men. These had the back, breast,
shoulders, and arms, covered with downy hair.</p>
<p>Two of the stoutest of the party were sitting in the midst of
their children, and each had two women by his side. They informed
us by signs, that these were their wives, and gave us a fresh
proof that polygamy is, established among them. The other women,
who had only one husband, were equally careful to let us know it.
It would be difficult to say which are the happiest; as the most
laborious of their domestic occupations devolve upon them, the
former had the advantage of a partner in them, which perhaps
might sufficiently compensate their having only a share in their
husband's affections.</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE V. <i>Natives of Van Diemen's Land preparing their
Repast</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>Their meal had continued a long time, and we were much
surprized that not one of them had yet, drank; but this they
deferred, till they were fully satisfied with eating. The women
and girls then went to fetch water with the vessels of sea-weed,
of which I have already spoken, getting it at the first place
they came to and setting it down by the men, who drank it without
ceremony, though it was very muddy and stagnant. Then they
finished their repast.</p>
<p>When we returned toward Port Dentrecasteaux; most of the
savages accompanied us; and before they left us, they gave us to
understand, that, in two days, by proceeding along the shore,
they should be very near our ships. To inform us that they should
make this journey in two days, they pointed out with their hands
the diurnal motion of the sun, and expressed the number two by as
many of their fingers.</p>
<p>When we re-embarked to go on board, these good people followed
us with their eyes for some time, before they left the shore, and
then they disappeared in the woods. Their way brought them at
times to the shore again, of which we were immediately informed
by the cries of joy, with which they made the air resound. These
testimonies of pleasure did not cease till we lost sight of them
from the distance.</p>
<p>During the whole time we spent with them, nothing appeared to
indicate that they had any chiefs. Each family, on the contrary,
seemed to us, to live in perfect independence; though we observed
in the children the greatest subordination to their parents, and
in the women the same to their husbands. It appeared, that the
women were careful to avoid giving their husbands any occasion
for jealousy; though, when we returned on board, one of the crew
boasted of the favours he had received from one of the beauties
of Cape Diemen; but it is difficult to say, how far his story was
founded on truth.</p>
<p>13th. On the 24th I made an excursion to the south-east, where
I found an opportunity of adding, to the observations I had
already made respecting the different productions of the
country.</p>
<p>14th. The next day, every thing was ready for our departure,
and we waited only for a fair wind to set sail; but being delayed
by a calm, we saw with pleasure, that the savages, who, at our
last interview, had promised to come near our anchoring-place
within two days, had kept their words. In fact, a little before
noon we perceived a fire not far from our watering-place; and
there could be no doubt that it was kindled by them, as all our
crew were on board. A great number of us immediately repaired in
several boats to the place of rendezvous. It was the first time
that General Dentrecasteaux had the pleasure of seeing any of the
natives. They soon quitted their fire, and proceeded for some
time through the paths made in the wood along the shore, in order
to come still nearer to us. We went to meet them; and when we
were near them they stopped, appearing well pleased at seeing us
come ashore. There were five of them. One of them carried a piece
of decayed wood in his hand, lighted at one end, and burning
slowly. He used this kind of match in order to keep fire, and
amused himself now and then with setting it to a tuft, where
there were some very dry herbs. The others being invited by some
of our crew to dance in a ring with them, imitated all their
movements tolerably well. We made them presents of a great number
of things, which they let us hang round their necks with strings,
and soon they were almost covered with them, apparently to their
great satisfaction; but they gave us nothing, for they had
brought nothing with them, probably that they might walk with the
more facility.</p>
<p>A native, to whom we had just given a hatchet, displayed great
dexterity at striking several times following in the same place,
thus attempting to imitate one of our sailors, who had cut down a
tree. We showed him that he must strike in different places, so
as to cut out a notch, which he did immediately; and was
transported with joy when the tree was felled by his strokes.
They were astonished at the quickness with which we sawed the
trunk in two; and we made them a present of some hand-saws, which
they used with great readiness, as soon as we had shown them the
way.</p>
<p>From the manner in which we had seen them procure fish, we had
reason to presume that they had no fish-hooks: accordingly we
gave them some of ours, and taught them how to use them,
congratulating ourselves at having supplied them with the means
of diminishing one of the most fatiguing employments of the
women.</p>
<p>These savages were much surprised at seeing us kindle the
spongy bark of the <i>eucalyptus resinifera</i> in the focus of a
burning glass. He who appeared the most intelligent among them,
desirous of trying the effects of the lens himself, threw the
converging rays of the sun upon his thigh by its means; but the
pain he felt, took from him all inclination of repeating the
experiment.</p>
<p>We let one of the natives see our ships through a good
perspective-glass, and he soon yielded to our solicitations, to
go on board the Recherche in one of our boats. He went up the
side with an air of confidence, and examined the inside of the
ship with much attention. His looks were then directed chiefly to
such objects as might serve for food. Led by the similitude in
shape, between the black swans of Cape Diemen and the geese of
Guinea, which he saw on board, ho asked for one, giving us to
understand that it was to eat. When he came opposite to our
hen-coops, he appeared struck with the beauty of a very large
cock, which was presented to him; and on receiving it he let us
know, that he would lose no time in broiling and eating it. After
having remained on board more than half an hour, and been loaded
with presents, he desired to return, and was immediately carried
ashore. We had taken an ape on shore with us, which afforded much
amusement to the savages; and one of the crew took a goat with
him, which formed a subject of conversation for them a long time,
and to which they occasionally spoke, saying, <i>medi</i> (sit
down).</p>
<p>They have given particular names to every vegetable. We
assured ourselves, that their botanical knowledge was
unequivocal, by asking several of them, at different times, the
names of the same plants.</p>
<p>In this interview we had an opportunity of adding considerably
to the vocabulary of their language, which we had before begun to
collect, and which will be found at the end of this work. On
comparing it with the vocabulary, which several voyagers have
given us, of the language of the people on the eastern coast of
New Holland, it will be seen, that it has no affinity with them;
which proves, that all these people have not one common,
origin.</p>
<p>The savage, who had been oar board our vessel, was not long
before he quitted us, expressing much gratitude, and pointing to
the cock, which he took upon one of his shoulders.</p>
<p>The rest, before they went away, gave us to understand, that
the next day their families would be at the place where we were;
but they appeared to apprehend our meaning, when we acquainted
them that we should sail the same day, and seemed to be much
grieved at it.</p>
<p>Our observatory, erected to the south-south-east of the place
where we lay at anchor, and a little more than half a mile
distant from it, was in latitude 43&deg; 34' 37" south, and
longitude 144&deg; 37' east.</p>
<p>A great number of observations made on board gave us for the
variation of the needle 7&deg; 34' east, while at the observatory
we found only 2&deg; 55' east variation. A difference so great
must unquestionably have arisen from some magnetic point;
besides, we had already found indications of ferruginous
substances at a very little distance from the place. It is
remarkable that, at the observatory of the Esperance, which was
about six hundred yards only from that of the Recherche, the
variation of the needle was 8&deg; east. We satisfied ourselves
that this difference was not owing to the compasses used, for we
found it the same when we made an exchange between them, by
removing them from one observatory to the other.</p>
<p>The dip of the needle was 72&deg; at the observatory of the
Recherche, and 71&deg; at that of the Esperance.</p>
<p>During our stay in Rocky Bay, the winds varied from north-west
to south-west, and frequently in heavy squalls. The sky was
seldom clear, but we had little rain.</p>
<p>The tides were perceptible only once in twenty-four hours. As
the wind influenced them much, we could not determine with
precision the time of high-water at the full and change of the
moon. Their greatest perpendicular rise was only five feet, or a
little more.</p>
<p>During this stay, our sailors lost much of their ardour for
fishing; for this laborious occupation, in which they were
employed chiefly by night, did not exempt them from the duties of
the ship in the day; so that, after having sitten up to fish,
they were obliged to work all day, as well as those who had
enjoyed their regular sleep in the night. Care should have been
taken, however, not to damp the zeal of our fishers, for it was
an object of general importance to all, to procure an ample
supply of fresh provision; besides, it was unjust not to allow at
least a few hours rest in the day to men, who had been spending
the night in procuring agreeable and salubrious food for all the
rest of the crew.</p>
<p>We set ashore here a she-goat and a young he-goat, in hopes of
naturalizing these animals in New Holland, as they could not fail
to thrive on the mountains at this extremity of the country, and
prove at some future period a great resource to navigators; it is
only to be feared, that the savages may destroy them, before they
have had time to propagate their breed.</p>

<br>
<small>15th FEBRUARY.</small></p>
<p>AT day-break we set sail from Rocky Bay, with a south-west
wind, and steered east-north-east till we reached its mouth,
intending to cast anchor in Dentrecasteaux Strait.</p>
<p>Some of the natives gave us notice of their presence by
several fires, which they had lighted on the eastern coast.</p>
<p>We had already crossed the great road, which is at the
beginning of the Strait, and were running along, very close to
the larboard shore, when, about half after one, P.M. we struck on
a small shoal, consisting of sand mixed with mud. The ebb had
just begun to set the current against us; and the tide falling
lower and lower, we were obliged to wait till half after six for
high water, to let us afloat again. The Esperance had gotten
still deeper in the sand than we, for she was not able to get off
till near eight o'clock.</p>
<p>Our boat, which had been sent off five days before, returned,
after having discovered several very deep creeks, that formed
excellent anchoring places, but without finding any river. It is
remarkable, that all we had seen at Cape Diemen were small, which
indicates a very broken country.</p>
<p>The boat was laded with black swans, shot by our people, whom
they suffered to come very near them. It was not easy to get
those that had been merely wounded; for, as they could still swim
with great speed, it was necessary to row hard, to catch them
even then.</p>
<p>16th. During the whole night we saw several fires, which the
natives had kindled on the borders of the sea toward the
south-south-east, near two miles from the place where we had
anchored.</p>
<p>We hoped that a fair wind would have allowed us to set sail
again in the morning; but the mind proving contrary, the General
determined that he would remain at anchor till the next day.
Accordingly we went ashore toward the southeast, on some low
ground, whence it was easy to reach Adventure Bay in a short
time.</p>
<p>Among the different shrubs that constitute the ornaments of
these places, I shall mention one, which I refer to the genus,
that I have already described under the name of
<i>mazeutoxeron</i>. It agrees with this genus in all its
characters; only the petals, which are distinct at the base,
adhere together at the middle of their edges, but they may be
separated without breaking them. The style is simple and
acute.</p>
<p>To this new species I give the name of <i>mazeutoxeron
reflexum</i>, on account of its leaves, which are inclined toward
the ground. They are hairy and whitish beneath.</p>
<p>The flowers are greenish, solitary, and issue out between two
small oval leaves; toward the middle of the peduncle they have
two filiform appendices a little larger than the calyx.</p>

<p>Citizen Beaupr&eacute;, engineer geographer, set off in the
evening, in the General's barge, for the great creek, which we
had perceived the preceding year to the north, in sailing out of
Dentrecasteaux Strait. The principal object was, to ascertain
whether it had any opening that communicated with the main sea,
and whether the island of Maria was really separated from the
land of New Holland; for this had not been sufficiently resolved
by Marion, or even by Captain Cook.</p>
<p>The wind continuing to the north all the 17th, prevented our
weighing anchor, and we went ashore, while our fishers proceeded
toward the mouth of the strait. The flood brought in with it a
considerable quantity of fish, and they caught several species of
ray of a large size. Some were found to weigh upwards of two
hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
<p>We got under way the next morning; but the wind was too faint,
to enable us to stem the current, which set against us, so that
we quickly let go our anchor again.</p>
<p>Toward noon some of the natives appeared on the eastern shore,
about half a mile from our ship. Some others soon joined them;
and we could count as many as ten, when they kindled a fire, and
seated themselves round it. From time to time they answered with
shouts of joy the shouts of our sailors. We hastened on shore in
a large party, to have a nearer view of them; and where we were
but a little way from the beach, they advanced toward us without
arms, their smiling countenances leaving us no room to doubt that
our visit gave them pleasure. They were as destitute of clothes
as those whom we had seen in the neighbourhood of Port
Dentrecasteaux; but we were much surprised to see most of them
holding the extremity of the prepuce with the left hand; no doubt
from a bad habit, for we did not observe any thing of the kind
among some others, who soon after joined them. Their joy was
expressed by loud bursts of laughter; at the same time they
carried their hands to their heads, and made a quick tapping with
their feet on the ground, while their countenances showed, that
they were well pleased to see us.</p>
<p>We invited them to sit down, speaking in the language of the
other natives, whom we had already met with at this extremity of
New Holland; and they understood us very well, immediately
acceding to our invitation. They understood likewise the other
words of the language of these people, which we had collected
from them, and we had no doubt, that they spoke the same tongue;
yet Anderson has given to the public some, words of the language
of the people of Adventure Bay, which have no similitude to
those, that we had an opportunity of acquiring and verifying.</p>
<p>These savages expressed much thankfulness, when we gave them a
few small pieces of stuffs of different colours, glass beads, a
hatchet, and some other articles of hardware.</p>
<p>Several other savages came out of the wood, and approached us.
There was no woman among them, but there were some young men.
Among these was one of the middle size, whose figure, which we
all admired, was very finely proportioned, even in the judgment
of our painter. From his dress we presumed this savage to be a
New Holland beau; he was tatooed with great symmetry, and his
hair, plastered with grease, was well powdered with ochre.</p>
<p>One of the natives gave us to understand, that he had seen
vessels in Adventure Bay before: probably he spoke of Bligh; who
had anchored there in the beginning of 1792, as we learned some
days, after from several inscriptions, which we found carved on
the trunks of trees.</p>
<p>An officer belonging to our ship imagined, that he should not
frighten them, by letting them see the effects of our fire-arms;
but as most of them were not previously informed of his design,
they were alarmed at the report of the gun, immediately role, and
would not sit down again. Supposing their wives and children were
retired to a little distance in the wood, we expressed to them
our wishes to see them join us; and the savages informed us that
we should find them, after walking some time across the wood in a
path, which led toward the south-south-west, and which they
immediately took, inviting us to follow them. This we did; but it
was not long before they expressed their desire to see us return
toward our ships, and parted from us, frequently looking back to
watch our motions.</p>
<p>On my pronouncing the word <i>quangloa</i>, however, which
signifies, in their language, <i>will you come</i>, they stopped,
and I went up to them with one of the officers of the Recherche.
They continued to lead us along the same path, which appeared
much frequented, and we walked slowly, that our people might have
time to join us. In this way we walked on for a quarter of an
hour; holding them by the arm, when on a sudden they quickened
their pace, so that it was not easy for us to follow them
farther. It appeared to us, that they wished we should leave
them, for some of them would not allow us to hold them by the arm
any longer, and walked by themselves, at some distance from us.
One of our crew, desirous of rejoining one of the fugitives, ran
after him, bawling out with all his might; and this alarmed all
the rest, who immediately hastened away, and kept at a
considerable distance from us. No doubt they were desirous to
reach the place where they had deposited their weapons
unaccompanied; for, after having again quickened their pace, they
struck out of the path a little, and presently we saw them with
three or four spears each, which they carried away, most of them
proceeding toward Adventure Bay, which others took their course
to the west. They then invited us to follow them; but we were not
willing to go any farther, for we had no desire to imitate them
in their course, and besides it was time for us to return on
board.</p>
<p>These natives appeared to us to have the greatest resemblance
to those whom we had seen a few days before; only we observed
some, in whom one of the middle teeth of the upper jaw was
wanting, and others in whom both were gone. We could not learn
the object of this custom; but it is not general, for the greater
part of the people had all their teeth.</p>
<p>They appeared to be equally ignorant with the others of the
use of the bow.</p>
<p>Almost all of them were tatooed with raised points, sometimes
placed in two lines, one over the other, much in the shape of a
horse-shoe; though frequently these points were in three straight
and parallel lines on each side of the breast; some were
observed, too, toward the bottom of the shoulder blades, and in
other places.</p>
<p>In many the navel appeared puffed up, and very prominent, but
we assured ourselves, that this deformity was not occasioned by a
hernia. Perhaps it is owing to the too great distance from the
abdomen, at which the umbilical cord is separated.</p>
<p>They acquainted us that they lived upon fish, as well as the
other inhabitants of Cape Diemen; yet I must observe, that we did
not see a single person who had the least trace of any disease of
the skin; which by no means agrees with the opinion of those, who
maintain, that ichthyophagi are subject to a species of leprosy.
Historians even assert, that such of the Greeks as would not
adopt in Egypt the regimen prescribed by Orpheus, were attacked
by the elephantiasis.</p>
<p>Soon after sun-set we arrived on board; when, the wind having
become fair, we weighed, and proceeded two leagues farther, where
we dropped anchor again.</p>
<p>19th. The next morning we got up our anchor pretty early, but
were obliged to let it go again almost immediately, as the wind
became foul.</p>
<p>I then landed on the eastern shore, whence I penetrated into
the woods, taking paths much frequented by the savages. It was
not long before I perceived a new species of <i>exocarpos</i>,
which I call <i>exocarpos expansa</i>, because its branches
spread much wider from each other than those of the <i>exocarpos
cupressiformis</i>. Its fruit is larger than that of the latter
species.</p>
<p>Two guns from the Recherche informed us, that the was
preparing to get up her anchor, and immediately we repaired on
board. By five o'clock we were under sail, but the breeze was so
faint, that we had made little way when night came. From the
place where we came to an anchor we reckoned now we had not above
a couple of leagues to the extremity of the strait; but we were
so delayed by the winds and currents, that it was four days
longer, before we could clear it.</p>
<p>In this interval the barge, which the General had dispatched
for the purpose of making geographical researches, returned after
five days absence. Citizen Beaupr&eacute; had discovered several
bays before unknown; the farthest to the north extended to
42&deg; 42' of S. lat., and the easternmost reached to the
longitude of Cape Pillar. He had seen the channel, which
separates the Island of Maria from the mainland.</p>
<p>It was with astonishment we saw the prodigious number of
sheltered situations, which, from Cape South to the meridian of
Cape Pillar, offer a continued chain of excellent anchoring
places, in a space including about sixteen leagues from east to
west, and about twenty from north to south.</p>
<p>Fresh water appears to be very scarce in these bays at this
season; yet near the head of that, which stretches farthest to
the north, there is a river, where, about fifty paces distant
from its month, there is perfectly fresh water of the depth of
six feet, even within an hour after flood-tide; for its current
is sufficiently rapid to repel the water of the sea, and prevent
its mingling with the stream.</p>
<p>On the 24th, about half after eleven in the morning, we
anchored in Adventure Bay, in eleven fathoms water; on a bottom
of mud mixed with a small portion of sand.</p>
<p>The nearest shore bore from us south-east, distant five
furlongs, and Penguin Island north 51&deg; east.</p>
<p>Immediately a boat was dispatched, to see whether it were easy
to furnish ourselves with water toward the north-west, at the
place pointed out by Captain Cook in the plan which he has given
of this bay. The east-south-east winds, however, occasioned a
very troublesome surf there, which induced us to prefer a place
to the south-east; but we found that the water procured there was
a little brackish; which proved, that it was taken from a place
too low, and too near the sea.</p>
<p>This bay being open to the east and south-east winds, they
sometimes occasion a heavy swell on the western shore, which,
tending thither from all sides, render it somewhat difficult to
land.</p>
<p>During the time we remained at anchor, I made excursions into
the adjacent country every day; but I found little to add to the
numerous articles I had collected at Cape Diemen.</p>
<p>Penguin Island, which I visited, is nothing but a hill,
scarcely separated from the great island, for at low water I
crossed the channel between them almost dry-shod. It consists of
a dark gray sandstone, the same as forms great part of the
borders of Adventure Bay. To the south it is overtopped by Fluted
Cape, which is formed of a reddish sandstone, disposed in
parallel strata perpendicular to the horizon. The difference of
tint in these strata exhibit at a distance the appearance of deep
flutings, which has given occasion to its name. It must be from
an error of the press, that it is said Anderson found this cape
to consist of a white sandstone.</p>
<p>On Penguin Island I found a new species of slate, remarkable
for its large lamin&aelig; of a light fawn colour; an
<i>eucalyptus</i> of a moderate height, which may readily be
distinguished by its opposite, sessile leaves, of a whitish green
colour, with a slight tint of blue (<i>glauques</i>); an
<i>embothrium</i>, with leaves very deeply indented; several fine
species of <i>philadelphus</i>, the flowers of which have no
smell, &amp;c.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image11" id="Image11"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>PLATE XLVI. <i>Catimarron of Van Diemen's Land&mdash;Canoe of
the Isle of St. Croix</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>We found a raft, which the waves had thrown upon the western
shore of Adventure Bay. Perhaps it had served to bring some
savages into this bay from the island of Maria. It was made of
the bark of trees; in shape nearly resembling that which is
represented in Plate XLVI. Fig. 2, being as broad, but not so
long by more than a third. The pieces of bark, that composed it,
were of the same structure as that of the <i>eucalyptus
resinifera</i>, but its leaves were much thinner. These pieces
had been held together by cords, made of the leaves of grasses,
forming a texture of very large meshes, most of which had the
form of a pretty regular pentagon.</p>
<p>Just by we saw some limestone rocks, bounding an extensive
sandy shore. On its borders we found the remains of a place which
had been made by Europeans for sawing wood, the pegs they had
used for erecting a tent, and some large logs, on which, it
appeared to us, they had placed instruments for making
astronomical observations.</p>
<p>The steep hills, which skirt the sandy shore a little farther
to the north, had in them caves, which appeared pretty much
frequented by the natives, to judge by the black colour they had
received from smoke, and the shells of lobsters and other fish
which we found there.</p>
<p>Several inscriptions, engraved on the trunks of trees,
acquainted us, that Captain Bligh had anchored in this bay in the
month of February 1792; when he was on his voyage to the Society
Islands for bread-fruit frees, which he was to carry to the
English colonies in the West Indies lying between the
tropics.</p>
<p>Bligh had with him two botanists, who sowed, at a little
distance from the shore, cresses, a few acorns, celery, &amp;c.
We saw three young fig trees, two pomegranate trees, and a quince
tree they had planted, which had thriven very well; but it
appeared to us, that one of the trees they had planted in this
country had already perished, for the following inscription,
which we found on the trunk of a large tree near, mentions
seven;</p>
<p><i>Near this Tree Captain William Bligh planted seven Fruit
Trees, 1792. Messrs. S. and W. Botanists.</i></p>
<p>The other inscriptions were couched in nearly similar terms.
They all displayed the same marks of deference which the English
botanists paid the Commander of their ship, by putting only the
initial letters of their own names, and expressing that the
Captain himself had sowed and planted the various vegetable
productions, which he had carried from Europe. I am much inclined
to doubt, whether Bligh was very sensible to the honour which the
botanists were desirous of paying him.</p>
<p>Toward the south-east, at a little distance from the beach, we
found an apple tree, the stem of which was near six feet and a
half high, and about two inches thick. It did not appear to us
that it had ever been grafted.</p>
<p>Our fishers were not unsuccessful at this anchoring place. The
fires they kindled along the shore in the night attracted a large
quantity of fish to their nets. The stratagem had before
succeeded so completely with the fishers of the Esperance in
Dentrecasteaux Strait, that they had laid in a stock of fish
sufficient for some months, part dried, and part pickled in
strong brine.</p>
<p>Several times in the course of the day I was present when they
hauled the seine, and always observed some new species of
<i>diodon</i> (porcupine fish). I admired the readiness with
which these little fishes erected the prickles that cover them,
by distending their bodies as soon as they were touched; but they
lowered them, and kept them close to their skirt, throughout
their whole length, as soon as they imagined themselves, out of
danger. This observation shows, that the attitude given to fish
of this genus, by distending them as much as possible, in which
manner they are exhibited in collections of natural history, is
not that which is most usual to them.</p>
<p>Near the north shore of this bay we minded a young he-goat,
and a she-goat big with kid, putting up our prayers that the
savages might allow them to propagate their breed in this island.
Perhaps they may multiply in it to such a degree, as to occasion
a total change in the manner of life of the inhabitants, who may
then become a pastoral people, quit without regret the borders of
the sea, and taste the pleasure of not being obliged to dive in
search of their food, at the risk of being devoured by sharks.
The women, who are condemned to this toilsome occupation, will be
much more sensible of the value of such a present than the men;
but it is to be feared that these animals will be killed before
they have time to breed, as appears to have happened to the sow
and boar left by Captain Cook; at least no one of us ever
perceived the slightest trace of these animals.</p>
<p>The latitude of our observatory, which was near a mile and a
quarter south from our anchoring place, was 43&deg; 21' 18"
south, and its longitude 145&deg; 12' 17" east.</p>
<p>The variation of the needle, observed at the same place, was
7&deg; 30' east.</p>

<br>
<small>1st MARCH.</small></p>
<p>WE set sail from Adventure Bay about eight in the morning,
with hard squalls from the south-west, which soon carried us
beyond Cape Pillar, behind which we saw several fires kindled by
the savages. We then steered toward the north, where we were in
sight of the coast about sixteen leagues distant, leaving Oyster
Bay to the west, and then we directed our course for the Friendly
Islands.</p>
<p>At day-break, on the 13th, we made the islands called the
Three Kings.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock, being in longitude 169&deg; 56' east, we
set the middle island of the group north, distant one league, and
ascertained its latitude to be 34&deg; 20' south.</p>
<p>We saw three principal rocks, of a moderate height, nearly in
the same parallel, at no great distance from each other, and
surrounded by other rocks that were much smaller. Notwithstanding
the fog that had just come on, we distinguished some more toward
the north, making a part of the same cluster. They were very
bare, and we did not suppose them to be inhabited: but a large
column of smoke, arising from the easternmost islet, informed us
that there were savages on it. No doubt they chafe this place of
residence, because it afforded them an opportunity of procuring
fish with case among the shoals.</p>
<p>About three quarters after ten we made the land of
New-Zealand, which we approached by steering easterly, under
favour of a light breeze from the west-north-west.</p>
<p>The natives had kindled a large fire on the loftiest of the
hills that skirt the sea, and which extend to Cape North. At half
after five we were a very little way from the cape, when two
canoes came off from the shore, and paddled toward us. They soon
came up with us, but remained some time astern of the ship before
they ventured alongside. Judging rightly of our disposition
toward them, however, they approached with confidence; aware, no
doubt, that the Europeans, who had visited them, had never been
the aggressors when any dispute arose. They immediately showed us
bundles of the New Zealand flax (<i>phormium tenax</i>), shaking
them, in order that we might observe all their beauty, and
offering to barter with us. The tuffs of different colours we
gave them were received with marks of great satisfaction, and
they always delivered to us, with the most scrupulous exactness,
the price on which we had agreed.</p>
<p>Iron they decidedly preferred to every thing else that we
offered them. This metal is so valuable in the eyes of these
warlike people, that expressions of the most lively joy burst
from them when they found we had some. Though at first we showed
it them only at a distance, they knew it perfectly well, from the
sound two pieces gave when struck against each other.</p>
<p>In exchange for our articles, these people gave us almost
everything they had in their canoes; and, which we considered as
a mark of the greater confidence, they made not the least
difficulty at disposing of all their weapons to us.</p>
<p>The largest of the spears they gave us were not above five
yards long, and an inch and half thick; the smallest were only
half that length. They were all made of a single piece of very
hard wood, which they had rendered perfectly smooth.</p>
<p>They gave us fishing lines, and, hooks of different shapes; to
the end of some of which feathers were fastened, which they use
as a bait for voracious fishes. Several of these lines were of
great length, and had at the end a piece of hard serpentine, to
make them sink very deep in the water. We admired the fine polish
they had given this tone, which was of a spherical form,
surmounted with a small protuberance, in which they had made a
hole, to pals a firing through. It must be very difficult to
these savages to bore a tone of such hardness, and no doubt
requires a great deal of time; but they have much leisure for
such employments, for their wants are few, and the sea supplies
them with food in abundance. They sold us a great deal of fish,
which they had just caught; and there is such a quantity along
the coast, that, during the short time we lay to, we saw several
numerous shoals, which, rising to the surface of the sea,
agitated it for a considerable space at different times,
producing nearly the same appearance as a current passing over a
shallow in calm weather.</p>
<p>These savages even stripped themselves of their clothes in
order to barter with us.</p>
<p>Some of the young men had drops at their ears, made with a
serpentine of great hardness. They were cut of an oval figure,
and for the most part hear four inches long.</p>
<p>The men of riper years wore, as a kind of trophy; a little
piece of the large bone of the forearm of a man, which hung at
the breast by a little string that passed round the neck. (See
Plate XXV.) They set a great value on this ornament.</p>

<b>PLATE XXV. <i>Man of New Zealand&mdash;Girl of New
Zealand</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>It is well known that these people are greedy devourers of
human flesh; and every thing that recals to their minds the idea
of such food, seems to give them the greatest pleasure. A sailor
on board offered one of them a knife; and, to shew him the use of
it, imitated the action of cutting off one of his fingers, which
he immediately carried to his mouth, and pretended to eat. The
cannibal, who watched all his motions, expressed great joy,
laughing heartily for some time, and rubbing his hands. They were
all very tall, and of a muscular make. Soon after sun-set they
left us.</p>
<p>At the same moment a third canoe arrived from the nearest
shore, with twelve of the islanders in it, who immediately
demanded hatchets in exchange for their goods. One of them had
already obtained a hatchet, when another addressed himself to us
in a rough voice, bawling out with all his strength <i>etoki</i>
(a hatchet), and was not silent till he had obtained one.</p>
<p>It was now night, and the Esperance was so far distant as to
be out of sight; accordingly we let off a few small quantities of
powder, to induce her to make known to us her situation; but we
observed with surprise, that the natives, far from, displaying
any dread of the effects of gunpowder, continued their barter
nevertheless. It had been. dark for more than an hour, when they
paddled away to the shore.</p>
<p>As we lay to, we hove the lead several times, and always found
a bottom of fine sand, and from thirty-six to fifty fathoms
water.</p>
<p>24th. The faint breeze that set off from the land during the
night, was succeeded toward day-break by a north-west wind. We
were still very near the coast, and we might easily have come to
an anchor in Lauriston Bay, but the fatal disasters that befell
Captain Marion, and afterwards Furneaux, made the General resolve
to pass on.</p>
<p>I thought it my duty, however, to represent to him, how
important an object it was, to procure from New Zealand the
liliaceous plant known by the name of <i>phormium tenax</i>, or
New Zealand flax, in order to convey it to Europe, where it would
thrive in perfection. The fibres obtained from the leaves of this
plant are much superior in strength to any other vegetable
production employed for making ropes, and cables made of it would
bear the greatest strain. No one could be more sensible of all
the benefits our navy might derive from this plant, than the
Commander in Chief of our expedition; yet we held on our course
for the Friendly Islands, continuing to steer north-east.</p>
<p>There would have been this advantage, likewise, in stopping at
the northern extremity of New Zealand, that it would have
afforded us an opportunity of verifying our observations, which
led us to place Cape North 36' more to the eastward than it is
laid down by Wales. It will be granted, however, that we have
sufficient reason to give our observations the preference, when
it is considered, that the English astronomer determined the
situation of this point only from the longitude observed in Ship
Cove, and the distance run along the coast by Captain Cook; and
it must be remembered, that this celebrated navigator had no
time-keeper on board during his first voyage, an instrument
indispensably necessary to ascertain with precision the distance
run upon a coast, where the currents are very rapid and
irregular.</p>
<p>17th. About four in the afternoon, the man at the mast-head
called out, that he had sight of a large rock to the
north-north-east; and we were soon surrounded by a great number
of sea-fowl, among which we noticed many boobies and gulls. It
was night when we passed about six hundred yards to leeward of
this shoal, from which we heard the screams of several of these
birds; and by the favour of a fine moon-light night, we
distinguished on the most prominent points a whiteness, which we
ascribed to their excrement.</p>
<p>This rock, which is in latitude 31&deg; 33' 20" south,
longitude 179&deg; east, is not much above, half a mile in
circumference, and seventy or eighty yards high. Toward its west
end some reefs were observed.</p>
<p>As we passed to leeward of this shoal, we were in completely
smooth water, so that if there had been any sunken rock in our
course, we should not have been informed of our danger till the
vessel struck upon it. If we had doubled the rock to windward, or
even to leeward at a proper distance, we should not have run this
risk.</p>
<p>18th. Next morning at day-break we made Curtis's Islands.
These are two very small isles, near four leagues distant from
each other. The southernmost is about a mile long only from north
to south, steep, very bare, and interspersed with a great number
of rocks, the summits of the highest of which reach about a
hundred yards above the level of the sea. Their whitish colour
led me to presume, that they were of a calcareous nature, like
most of the islands found in these seas.</p>
<p>The other island is tolerably rounded, covered with verdure,
and as high as the former. Its sides are steep almost every
where, yet you may land upon it toward the west. It is in the
latitude of 30&deg; 18' 26" south, longitude 179&deg; 38'
east.</p>
<p>About six in the evening we perceived at a great distance to
the north-north-west, a new island, which induced us to lay to
all night.</p>
<p>19th. The next morning, when day broke we had sight of the
same island toward the north, and still upwards of ten leagues
distance; but about five in the afternoon we were close in with
it, and had already seen the whole of its circumference, the
extent of which might be about three leagues.</p>
<p>To this island, the latitude of which is 29&deg; 20' 18"
south, longitude 179&deg; 55' east, we gave the name of
Recherche. Its figure is nearly triangular. Toward the middle the
land rises to the height of about five hundred yards above the
level of the sea. On the east the earth had crumbled down in a
few places of no great extent, where a boat might land.</p>
<p>In all the perpendicular cliffs we could clearly distinguish
the arrangement of the thin, parallel, and horizontal strata of a
whitish, and no doubt calcareous stone, of which the island is
formed. In the interior part of the island we saw considerable
precipices, and there were trees to the very summit of the
highest places.</p>
<p>There is a shoal almost close to the shore on the north-west,
which extends at least six hundred yards in that direction.</p>
<p>Eight rocks, a few hundred yards distant from each other,
stretch out into the sea for the space of a league to the
east-south-east.</p>
<p>Between the west and north west points, we observed a small
bight, where probably very good ground would be found, and which
affords complete shelter from the easterly winds.</p>
<p>Between the north-west and south-east points we saw a little
rivulet, which runs into the sea; and at a little distance, from
it, in a perpendicular cliff, we observed a large patch of earth,
of a tolerably deep red colour, perhaps a sort of clay, which
appeared incrusted by the calcareous stone.</p>
<p>On the 23d, about nine in the evening, we entered the Torrid
Zone, in the longitude of 184&deg; east. This was the fourth time
of our passing the Tropic of Capricorn.</p>
<p>24th. The next day, at one o'clock in the afternoon, we made
Eooa, one of the Friendly Islands, bearing from us north-west,
distant about, fourteen leagues; and it was not long before we
had a pretty near view of it. The beautiful verdure with which it
was every where covered, proclaimed the fertility of the soil.
The land is of a moderate height.</p>
<p>It was half after six when we brought to, to wait for the
Esperance, and we spent the night in plying to windward.</p>
<p>On the 25th, at seven o'clock in the morning, we were about
six leagues only from Tongataboo, and yet we could not easily
distinguish it, because the land is so low. We soon of pretty
near in with the eastern coast, standing toward the north and
north-west, that we might not miss the opening that leads to the
harbour, which is to be entered only by passing between some
reefs, which are so close together that the break between them is
not to be distinguished at a little distance.</p>
<p>As soon as we were about the middle of this channel, several
canoes with out-riggers came to meet us, laden with fruit, hogs,
and poultry, which they offered us. Each had two on three natives
on board, seldom four. One of them coming toward us with too much
speed, her out-rigger gave way, and we had the sorrow to see the
three rowers fall into the water. They seemed less disconcerted,
however, than we should have imagined, and swam to the nearest
shore, dragging with them their canoe, which was soon set afloat
again. These canoes are so slight that they must frequently be
exposed to such accidents; and, indeed, their countrymen, who
passed close by, seemed scarcely to notice it.</p>
<p>All these canoes had eatables on board, one excepted, in which
we observed none, and which, therefore, we imagined, had nothing
to offer us. But we were mistaken; it was navigated by two men,
whose countenances expressed much gaiety, while they pointed out
to us two women, who were paddling with them; and the signs they
made left us no room to doubt, that they were making us very
gallant proposals.</p>
<p>At a distance we saw some large sailing canoes.</p>
<p>About half after eleven, being in the narrowed part of the
channel, where it did not appear to us to be above four hundred
yards over, we had bottom near the middle at six fathoms.</p>
<p>Just as we were on the point of entering into it, a large
canoe came to meet us, and the people in her invited us to follow
them in a much wider channel, which was on the larboard of it;
but when they saw us take another course, they returned, and
continued some time a-head of us, willing to instruct is how to
steer.</p>
<p>At length we reached the road of Tongataboo, and after making
several tacks to fetch the anchorage, brought up a mile to the
south-west of Panga&iuml;motoo, in eleven fathoms and a half of
water, on a bottom of very fine grey sand.</p>
<p>One of the western points of Tongataboo bore west 3&deg;
north; the western extremity of Panga&iuml;motoo, north 24&deg;
east; and the extremity of the reefs on that side, north 20&deg;
west.</p>
<p>We were immediately surrounded by the natives, who came on
board in such numbers, that the deck was soon covered with them.
Several came in double canoes, of the shape represented in Plate
XXVIII.</p>
<p>One of these people, followed by several others, who appeared
to pay him great respect, announced himself as one of the chiefs
of the island. He desired to see the Commander of the vessel, and
immediately ordered a hog to be brought, of which he made him a
present. This person expressed much gratitude on receiving a
hatchet from the General's own hands.</p>
<p>In less than an hour we procured, by way of barter, a dozen
hogs, the smallest of which was at least a hundred weight. For
each a hatchet, of a middling size, was given.</p>
<p>The General had given orders to one of his officers to treat
with the islanders for what provision they could furnish; and to
prevent all competition, which might have been injurious to the
supply of our ships, he had forbidden every other person to make
any exchange. But it was impossible to see these orders executed
to the letter; and it was difficult to resist the eagerness of
the natives to dispose of their wares, which each endeavoured to
display to the best advantage. We were much amused to see them
holding their little pigs under their arms, and every now and
then pulling them by the ears to make them squeal, that we might
know they had them to sell.</p>
<p>A chief of the warriors, named Feenou, came on board about
five in the afternoon. He was a man about forty-five years of
age, of a middling stature, and very fat. Like the rest of the
natives, he had altogether the features of an European. His body
was covered with scars in various places, and he pointed out to
us two on the breast, which, he said, were from wounds received
by spears in different battles against the people of Feejee.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image13" id="Image13"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>PLATE VIII. <i>Man of Van Diemen's Land&mdash;Feenou, Chief of
the Warriors of Tongataboo</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>The portrait of this warrior, Plate VIII. Fig. 2, is a very
faithful resemblance. His hair, powdered with lime, was dressed
in such a way, that he might be supposed to have worn a wig.</p>
<p>He seated himself on the bench on the quarter-deck, with four
of the natives, and ordered all the rest to squat down; some of
them, however, he permitted to sit on the arm-chest. I know not
whether these were great personages; but we remarked among them a
man advanced in years, accompanied by a young girl, who employed
all his eloquence to tempt such of us as came near her.</p>
<p>Feenou made a present to the General of the largest hog that
we had yet seen fence we had been at anchor. He gave him likewise
two very fine clubs, made of <i>casuarina</i> wood, inlaid with
plates of bone, some cut round, others in stars, and others in
the shape of birds, of which, however, they were but poor
resemblances. This chief appeared well satisfied when the General
gave him a hatchet, a large piece of red stuff, and a few nails.
To testify his gratitude, he took each of these articles in his
left hand, and touched the left side of his forehead with it.</p>
<p>Towards sun-set we requested him to send out of the ship all
the natives, the crowd of whom was become immense. We were
desirous that not one should remain, as we did not wish to have
the trouble of watching them during the night; but perhaps his
authority did not extend to them all; for, after he had driven
away the greater part only, he left us, and returned towards the
western shore of Tongataboo.</p>
<p>The step he took to rid our ship of these islanders, by whom
we were incommoded to an excessive degree, could not easily be
guessed. He drove them out with his club, which he handled so
vigorously, that they had no way to escape the rude blows of this
weapon, but by leaping into the sea.</p>
<p>Almost all their clubs are made with the wood of the
<i>casuarina</i>, which is extremely hard; yet we saw a few of
bone, somewhat more than a yard long. As theft islanders have no
quadruped capable of furnishing a bone of such length, there can
be no doubt but it must belong to some large animal of the whale
genus.</p>
<p>Beside many fowls, they sold us pigeons of the species called
<i>columba aenea</i> (nutmeg pigeon), bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts,
yams, and several varieties of plaintain, of a delicious
flavour.</p>
<p>We desired all the natives to go ashore before night, for
several had not come ihr the purpose of satisfying their
curiosity merely, or selling us their goods; as we soon
discovered that they had stolen several articles from us. All the
canoes, however, were gone, and there were still six of the
islanders left on board; who, having no means of getting on shore
but by swimming, requested us to let them pass the night upon
deck, one excepted, who chose rather to swim ashore, though we
were a mile from the nearest land. We admired the facility with
which he executed all his movements. He swam constantly on the
belly, his neck being entirely out of water, and making very
short strokes with his left hand, which he kept constantly before
him, while he gave a great spread to his right hand, which he
carried to the thigh on the same side at every stroke. The body
was at the same time a little inclined to the left, which
increased the rapidity, with which it cut the water. I never saw
an Europeans swim with such confidence, or with such speed.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A somewhat similar mode of swimming, I
believe, is not unfrequent among expert swimmers in England; at
least I have often seen it practised by others, and have had
recourse to it myself, when engaged in a contest of
speed&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>26th. Feenou returned the next morning, and spent a few hours
on board. He was singularly amused by an ape belonging to one of
our gunners, to the slightest actions of which he was
attentive.</p>
<p>The tents of the observatory were pitched on the south-west
shore of Panga&iuml;motoo, and to the same place were conveyed
stuffs of different colours, with a great many articles of
hardware, to exchange for fresh provision. As the inhabitants
brought us a great many hogs, the General resolved to make an
addition to our salt stores; and Citizen Renard, one of our
surgeons, offered to superintend the salting in of the pork.</p>
<p>An enclosure was marked out by a rope, fastened to the ends of
some stakes, which were stuck into the ground at four or five
yards distance from each other. This barrier was intended to keep
out the natives, day and night, above two thousand of whom, most
of them from Tongataboo, were already gathered round us.</p>
<p>Futtafaihe, one of the sons of the late King Poulaho, repaired
early to the same place. He took upon himself to preserve order
among the natives; and accordingly our trade was carried on with
the greatest peaceableness; but we saw with regret that, to make
himself obeyed, he employed means as barbarous with respect to
them, as laborious to himself; or if, any one of them dared to
pass the enclosure that was traced out, by a few hand's-breadths
only, he immediately threw at him the first thing that came to
hand, as a warning for him to retire, without paying any regard
to the injury that might be done by it. A young man, who advanced
a little too far, had nearly lost his life by his inattention to
the orders of Futtafaihe, who immediately threw at him with
violence a large log of wood, but he was fortunate enough to
avoid the blow.</p>
<p>We were obliged to cross this numerous circle to penetrate
into the interior part of the island; and it was not easy to
avoid treading on the feet or legs of the natives, who sat on the
ground very close together, all with their legs across; yet, far
from being angry, they held, out their hands to assist us when,
for fear of hurting them, we knew not where to set our feet. A
few of them followed us.</p>
<p>We found many of the people employed in constructing huts, in
order to remain on the island of Panga&iuml;motoo; whither they
were attracted by our making choice of this little island as a
market place for the provision, with which they could supply us.
Several of these huts were already finished. The islanders, whom
we met with in them, received us with various testimonies of
great affection.</p>
<p>The ground occupied by each of these habitations was not, in
general, above sixteen feet long, and ten feet wide. The roof,
about six feet and a half high in the middle, sloped down to the
ground. In one of its sides an opening was made, sometimes the
whole length of the hut, but so low, that there was no entering,
without stooping so much, as to be obliged to creep on all fours.
On the opposite side we observed another opening, still lower and
narrower, which seemed intended to promote the circulation of
air. In others, a greater number of openings were seen, but
smaller, and made even in the ends of the huts. We admired the
fine texture of the mats, which were spread upon the ground. The
roofs were covered with the leaves of the cocoa tree, or of the
mountain palm (<i>corypha umbraculifera</i>), sometimes too with
grass or rushes. Under such a roof there is no standing, except
in the middle; but these people commonly squat on the ground, so
that they can sit tolerably near to the sides.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of these tranquil dwellings we frequently
met with very obliging though stout men, who took care to inform
strangers of the favourable reception, they might meet with from
the fair sex in these fortunate islands. Their offers, no doubt,
were in some measure owing to their wish to oblige; but it
appeared; that they had an eye to their own interest at the same
time, as they never forgot to ask some recompense in return for
their information.</p>
<p>We walked some time along the borders of the shore, on which
we saw a great number of bread-fruit trees in full vigour, though
their roots were bathed with brackish water. But soon the water
rising with the flood-tide, obliged us to go farther within the
land, where we traversed thick woods, in the shade of which grew
the <i>tacca pinnatifida</i>, <i>saccharum spontaneum</i>,
<i>muss&aelig;nda frondosa</i>, <i>abrus precatorius</i> (Jamaica
wild liquorice), the species of pepper tree which they use for
making <i>kava</i>, &amp;c. We then walked over grounds employed
partly in the culture of the sweet potatoe, partly in that of the
species of yam called <i>dioscorea alata</i>; we saw, too, young
plants of <i>vacoua</i>, or <i>pandanus odoratissima</i> (sweet
scented screw-pine), the leaves of which are used for making
mats. Farther on we found plantations of the paper mulberry tree;
cultivated for the sake of its bark, of which they fabricate
stuff for garments. The <i>hibiscus tiliaceus</i> grew
spontaneously on the borders of these cultivated spots, and close
by the sea. Its bark likewise furnishes them with materials for
making a kind of stuff, but much inferior in beauty to that of
the paper mulberry tree.</p>
<p>Some of the natives, who followed us very close, affected the
appearance of having no other design, but that of being useful to
us; yet we caught some of them now and then putting their hands
into our pockets, to steal what they could find; and when we
discovered them, we always obliged them to return what they had
taken. One of them, however, having seized a knife, that belonged
to one of the crew, took to his heels with all speed, and
disappeared amid the wood.</p>
<p>It was not long before we fell in with a company of the
islanders, who were preparing to drink lava. They invited us to
sit down by them, and we remained all the time they were
preparing their beverage. They give the same name to the species
of pepper tree, which constitutes its chief ingredient, and the
long, fleshy, and very tender roots of which are often more than
four inches thick. These they first cleaned with the greatest
care. They then chewed them, so as to reduce them to a kind of
paste, of which they formed balls, nearly four, inches in
circumference. As fast as these balls were made, they were put
into a large wooden vessel; and when the bottom was covered with
them, standing about four inches distant from each other, they
filled up the vessel with water. The liquor was then shaken, and
served out in cups to all the guests. Some drank out of cocoa-nut
shells, others made themselves cups on the occasion from the
leaves of the plantain tree.</p>
<p>The large roots, with which the <i>kava</i> was made, had, in
the direction of their length, very slender woody fibres, which
subsided to the bottom of the liquor. These fibres, the person
who served it out, collected in one of his hands, and used as a
sponge, to fill the cups.</p>
<p>We were invited to take a share of this beverage; but our
seeing it prepared was sufficient to make us decline the civil
offer. The Chaplain of our ship, however, had the courage to
swallow a bumper of it. For my part, as I was desirous also of
tasting the flavour of the root, I preferred chewing a bit of it
myself, and found it acrid and stimulant. Each of the company
afterwards ate some yams, fresh roasted under the embers, and
plaintains; no doubt to take off the heat, which the stomach must
feel from this intoxicating liquor.</p>
<p>These people set much store by the pepper tree, from which
they procure it. Its stalk, frequently bigger than the thumb, is
tolerably straight, and requires no support. They cut off several
pieces in the spaces between the knots, and made us a present of
them, informing us, that they set them thus in the ground, in
order to propagate the plant.</p>
<p>We were not far from the tents of the observatory, when some
others of the natives invited us to eat fruit, among which we had
the pleasure of seeing that of the <i>spondias cytherea</i>
(<i>pommes de cyth&egrave;re</i>). Every one sat down: Citizen
Riche just laid down a pole-axe, when a native crept slily behind
him, took it up, and ran off as fast as he could. We immediately
pursued him, but he had too far the start for us to come up with
him. A chief, who was then near us, would make the thief restore
the pole-axe, and ran after him likewise; but he soon returned,
and appeared very sorry, that he could not overtake the
fugitive.</p>
<p>We soon arrived within the enclosure where the traffic was
carried on. Futtafaihe was still there. We were informed that he
had caused a sabre, and several other things belonging to
different persons of the crew, which had been stolen by the
natives, to be returned. Riche accordingly applied to him, in
order to procure his pole-axe again; but the inquiries of
Futtafaihe were to no purpose.</p>
<p>27th. A great many canoes surrounded our ships, though the
General had given orders to oblige them to keep off; but they
disposed of their merchandize to better advantage here, than at
the market on shore; for there little was sold but eatables, the
price of which was fixed; while on board they frequently received
a high price for objects of fancy. Besides, these canoes carried
on another sort of trade, still more rigorously prohibited by the
orders of General Dentrecasteaux; but the entries not being very
strict in this point, many young girls easily evaded their
notice, and were creeping in at the port-holes every moment.</p>
<p>We went ashore very early at the nearer place, where we had
the pleasure to see that these islanders were in possession of
the sugar-cane. They offered us some very large ones, which we
accepted. They sold us several birds, and among others a
beautiful species of lory, which they informed us had been
brought to them from Feejee; a fine species of dove, remarkable
for a red spot on the head, and known by the name of <i>columba
purpurata</i>; the Philippine rail, <i>ragas philippensis</i>;
the pigeon called <i>columba pacifica</i>, &amp;c. Several had
the lizard known by the appellation of <i>lacerta
amboinensis</i>, which they offered us as very good to eat.</p>
<p>The natives, who followed us, were very troublesome to us by
their number, and even by their eagerness to oblige us. Seeing us
collect plants, several pulled up, indiscriminately all they
sounds made them up into large bundles, brought them to us, and
then wanted to load us with them. Others, observing us collect
insects, were incessantly asking whether they were not to feed
the birds we had just purchased. But most put on a semblance of
having the greatest affection for us, while they were purloining
our things. Several times we endeavoured in vain to get rid of
them, the methods we took being unquestionably too mild, for
people accustomed to be treated so roughly by their chiefs.</p>
<p>Futtafaihe, accompanied by another chief, had been to dine
with the General, who presented one with a scarlet suit of
clothes, the other with a blue. Adorned with this new dress,
which they had put on over their own clothes, they were in one of
the tents of the observatory, when Feenou made his appearance at
the entrance of it, and displayed great jealousy at seeing them
thus equipped. He retired with an air of great discontent,
saying, that every body passed themselves off for chiefs
(<i>egui</i>), and went to drink <i>kava</i> with some others. We
did not know what to think of Feenou's precipitate retreat but we
presumed; that he was less powerful than Futtafaihe, and declined
appearing before him, that he might not be under the necessity of
paying him the honours due to his rank.</p>
<p>The officer entrusted with the purchase of provision had a
very laborious task to fulfil: for, though he had fixed a regular
value on every article, the natives, still in hopes of selling
them dearer, never parted with their goods till they had disputed
a long time about their price.</p>
<p>Pressed by hunger, we retired into the tent, where the
provision purchased in the course of the day was deposited; and
were followed by two natives, whom we took for chiefs. One of
them shewed the greatest eagerness to select for me the choicest
fruit. I had laid my hat on the ground, thinking it a place of
security; but these two thieves were not inattentive to their
trade; he that was behind me was adroit enough, to hide my hat
under his clothes, and went away, without my perceiving it; and
the other quickly followed him. I was the less apprehensive of
such a trick, as I did not suppose that they would have ventured
upon an article of such bulk, at the risk of being caught within
the enclosure, into which we had permitted them to enter;
besides, a hat could be of very little use to people who commonly
go bare-headed. The address they displayed in robbing me,
convinced us that it was not their first attempt; and led us to
presume, that they frequently rob one another. The chiefs, too,
might have some interest in the thefts committed on us; for we
frequently saw them seize what they found in the hands of their
subjects, whom they plundered very openly.</p>
<p>We were extremely unwilling to proceed to extremities with
these knaves; but it was high time to check their boldness, which
impunity served only to encourage. With this view, we proposed to
let them see the effect of our fire-arms on a cock, which we tied
to the end of a long pole. But the person, who fired at it, was
so incautious, as to take a double-barrelled gun, which had been
exposed to the dampness of the air all the preceding night; in
consequence of which, the first time it flashed in the pan, the
next it hung fire; so that he was obliged to take another piece
to bring clown the cock. Accordingly the natives appeared to
retain a much higher idea of their weapons than of ours, when one
of them, with a long arrow, furnished with three diverging
points, shot another cock, fixed at the end of the same pole. In
order to take aim at the bird, having placed himself just under
it, he raised himself as high as he could on tiptoe, so that the
point of his arrow was not above four yards from the cock. All
the rest had their eyes fixed upon him, and kept the most
profound silence; but the moment he hit the object, their shouts
of admiration gave us to understand that they did not in general
succeed so well, even at so short a distance.</p>
<p>The arrow used upon this occasion was near three yards long;
but they have others of inferior dimensions, which they likewise
carry in quivers of bamboo.</p>
<p>28th. Two sentries kept guard day and night at the post we had
established on the Island of Panga&iuml;motoo, who were
sufficient to keep off such of the natives as might endeavour to
heal into it secretly, to carry off the articles we had deposited
there. Undoubtedly no apprehensions had been entertained, that
they would break into it by force, for no precautions had been
taken to guard against an of fault. A native, however, took
advantage of a heavy fall of rain, which came on just as day was
breaking, to get behind one of our entries, and gave him such a
violent stroke on the head with his club, that he knocked him
down, though his helmet-cap warded off much of the violence of
the blow. The assassin immediately made off with his musket; and
the other sentry instantly gave notice of it to those of us, who
were sleeping in the tents. The alarm was great, and several
moved nearer to the shore, that they might be able to reach the
long-boat, if the islanders should fall upon us in great number.
The cry of alarm was heard on board the Esperance, that ship
having come within hail of the shore the preceding evening, and
immediately a few muskets were fired from her, to give notice of
it to the Recherche; but our fear of a general attack from the
natives did not continue long, for we quickly assured ourselves,
that most of them were still fast asleep round our poor, and
those, who had been awakened, had sled. An officer, too, who
arrived from the interior of the island, almost at the instant of
the assassination, reported, that he had seen a great many of the
natives, all of whom appeared to him to be in a profound
sleep.</p>
<p>The Commander of our expedition went on shore about six
o'clock, with a detachment well armed, and gave orders to strike
the tents immediately, and carry them aboard, with every thing
than had been left at the post for the purpose of barter.</p>
<p>Our removal much grieved several of the chiefs, who came to
the General to express the sorrow they felt at this disagreeable
affair. They loudly expressed their disapprobation of this
cowardly piece of treachery, laying, that the culprit deserved
death, and should not long escape the due reward of his crime. At
the same time they did every thing in their power to prevail on
us to continue our barter as before.</p>
<p>Our detachment having advanced a little way into the island,
to examine the disposition of the natives, found near a thousand,
who had slept in the neighbourhood of our pest, and requested
them to remove to a greater distance; which they all did, except
a small party of armed men, who, lifting up their clubs and
spears, refused to retire a single step. Perhaps it would have
been proper to have punished their audacity, which led us to
consider them as accomplices of the assassin; but a chief, named
Toobou, one of the king's relations, fell upon them with fury,
and quickly dispersed them by heavy blows with his club.</p>
<p>The General, before he got into the boat to return on board,
made a few presents to the different chiefs, who were collected,
around him. He also required them to deliver up the assassin, and
return the musket he had stolen, with the sabre that had been
taken from our gunner the day before; informing them, that he
would allow the barter to be renewed on these conditions
alone.</p>
<p>All the natives retired when our long boat put off from the
shore; but as soon as it arrived along-side the vessel, several
of them went to the spot we had quitted, and examined it very
carefully, to see whether we had not left something or other
behind us. We observed one, who had the dexterity to pull out the
nail by which one of our clocks had been hung up to a post.</p>
<p>Feenou came on board in the afternoon, and made the General a
present of some bread-fruit, yams, plantains, and a pig. In
return he received a saw, a hatchet, and several chisels; but we
perceived, that he gave the hatchet a decided preference to the
other tools. After having paid the greatest attention to the
account we gave him of the attack made on our sentry by one of
the natives, he promised to return the musket the next day; and
told us, that he would bring the assassin to us, and do justice
on him in our presence. He desired, to see the gunner, who had
received a large wound in the head, but happily not dangerous, as
the helmet-cap he wore had deadened the blow. Feenou displayed
much sensibility on seeing the wound, and presented the gunner
with a piece of the stuff fabricated of the bark of the paper
mulberry tree, to use in dressing the wound. In fact the
properties of this stuff render it well adapted to such a
purpose.</p>
<p>Feenou having ordered several of the natives, who attended
him, to make <i>kava</i>, these immediately began to chew some
large roots of the species of pepper tree, to which they give
that name, and the liquor was soon prepared. He drank of it
first, and the rest was shared among the other natives, who, as
well as Feenou, ate plantains after it. Out of respect to him,
they all squatted on the deck, while he sat on the watch
bench.</p>
<p>We showed this chief several engravings in the voyages of
Captain Cook. It was with the greatest respect that he several
times pronounced the name of that celebrated navigator, which he
called <i>Toote</i>. It is remarkable, that though we could
pronounce words of their language with great facility, they could
not do so with ours; for instance, when they wished to pronounce
the word <i>Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, they said
<i>Palan&ccedil;ois</i>; instead of <i>Beaupr&eacute;</i>, the
said <i>Beaup&eacute;l&eacute;</i>, &amp;c. Feenou talked to us
of Otaheite, and said, that he had seen Omai at Anamooka. Perhaps
this is the same Feenou who was particularly intimate with Cook
in his last voyage, though that navigator says he was a tall
man.</p>
<p>His attendants said a great deal to us about King. Toobou, of
whose power they made great boast; and to point out to us his
superiority, they raised the right arm very high, pronouncing his
name at the same time, and then touched it near the elbow with
the left hand, to mark the inferiority of Feenou. He himself
assented to this pre-eminence, of Toobou, who, he said, was to be
on board us the next day.</p>
<p>29th. I had intended to spend this day on the island of
Tongataboo, with some of my shipmates; but the General desired us
to postpone this excursion, till the chiefs had given us a proof,
that they were really determined to put an end to the
depredations committed by their subjects.</p>
<p>Several canoes surrounded our vessels, but no one was
permitted to come alongside. Many of their people, weary of their
situation, as they could not carry on, any kind of traffic,
amused themselves with fishing. Their nets were nearly nine yards
long, about a yard and a half deep, and the meshes were about an
inch square. From the shape of these nets, several of which we
had already purchased, we imagined that they used them as we do
seines, hauling them up on the beach; but we were much astonished
to see them throw them out in the open road, much in the same
manner as we do a casting-net. On the lower side were fastened
pieces of coral, which sunk the net rapidly, to the bottom; and
the fishermen immediately dived, to bring the two ends together
by means of small lines fastened to them; thus enclosing the
fish, which they put into their canoes. It is obvious that fish
must be very plenty, for them to be caught in this manner in the
open sea. No doubt the fishermen would not have taken all this
trouble, had not their hunger been extremely craving; for, as
they had no means of dressing their fish in their canoes, they
did not hesitate to devour it raw.</p>
<p>About nine in the morning three chiefs came on board, to
acquaint us that Toobou, the supreme chief (<i>egui la&iuml;</i>)
of Tongataboo, Vavao, Anamooka, &amp;c. was coming to pay us a
visit, and that he would deliver into our hands the assassin we
demanded, and restore the musket that had been stolen. In fact,
it was scarcely eleven o'clock when Toobou arrived, with several
chiefs. The assassin was at his feet, lying on his belly with his
hands bound behind his back. He ordered him on board immediately,
and then directed the musket, with its bayonet fixed, which had
been taken from one of our sentries, to be brought. Two pieces of
stuff, made of the bark of the paper mulberry, so large, that
each, if spread out, would have completely covered our vessel,
two hogs, and several very large mats, composed the present which
he brought to the Commander of our expedition. The warrior
Feenou, not disdaining to perform the office of executioner,
lifted up his club, to beat out the brains of the culprit, and it
was somewhat difficult to prevent him from doing justice on the
prisoner before our eyes. At length, however, he delivered him
into the hands of the General, imagining, no doubt, that he was
desirous of keeping him, to inflict on him himself the punishment
due to his crime. The prisoner too, supposing that his last hour
was come, already stretched out his neck, when our sentry, whom
he had knocked down, begged the life of the offender. On this he
was dismissed, with a few stripes on the back with a rope's end;
but Feenou, thinking this punishment far too little, again raised
his club, to put an end to his existence. The General bawled out
as loud as he could, <i>ica&iuml; mat&eacute;</i>, (that he
should grant him his life); but Feenou declared, nevertheless,
that he should not escape the punishment he deserved. As we were
examining several marks on his head, from blows this man had
received with a club, before he had been brought to us, we were
informed, that these had been given to him when he was taken. The
General ordered our surgeon to dress his wounds, and then removed
him to the Esperance, intending to let him ashore in the night,
to endeavour to save his life.</p>
<p>King Toobou received as a present from the General's hands a
suit of scarlet, in which he dressed himself immediately, and a
large hatchet. Feenou, too, received a scarlet suit, with a
hatchet of much smaller dimensions; and a few small hatchets were
distributed among the other chiefs. They were all on the deck,
forming a circle round Toobou, who sat on the watch bench, with
Feenou on his right hand, and another chief, named Omala&iuml;,
on his left.</p>
<p>Toobou appeared to us to be at least sixty years old. He was
of a middling height, and still much more corpulent than Feenou.
His garments were made in the same shape as those of the other
natives, differing only in the fineness of their texture. He wore
a very beautiful mat, fastened round him by means of a girdle,
fabricated of the bark of the paper mulberry tree.</p>
<p>When Toobou gave orders for making <i>kava</i>, we requested
some of the chiefs to take upon themselves its preparation, and
chew the roots of the <i>kava</i> pepper tree, which we offered
them; but they uniformly refused, with an air of disdaining an
occupation beneath them. It was entrusted to men of an inferior
class (<i>mouas</i>), who were seated near the middle of the
circle, formed by the chiefs.</p>
<p>The rain, which had come on in the mean time, increasing
rapidly, we imagined that every one of them would have sought
shelter; but they all braved the weather, without quitting their
places, except the king, who withdrew into the General's cabin,
with Feenou; and Toobou-Foa, one of the royal family. <i>Kava</i>
was carried to, them in cups, which had just been made of
plantain leaves, and then plantains were offered to them. The
General invited them all three to dinner; but the king did not
permit either of the chiefs to sit at the same table with him. He
tasted all the dishes, refused most of them, and ate very little
of those that he did not appear to dislike, sugar excepted. The
General had made him a present of a bird-organ, with which he was
wonderfully amused, and on which he played almost all dinner
time.</p>
<p>These islanders shave with the edge of a shell, and the
operation takes up a great deal of time. They were struck with
astonishment, when they saw how quickly our barber took off the
beards of several of our crew, and every one was desirous of
experiencing his skill. Among the rest, he had the honour of
shaving his majesty himself.</p>
<p>About half after three, the king giving us notice of his
intention to depart, an offer was made to put him ashore in the
barge, which he accepted. He was attended by a great number of
canoes, and soon arrived at the island of Panga&iuml;motoo, with
most of the chiefs who had accompanied him on board. As soon as
he landed, he ordered some yams, a bread-fruit, some pork and
plantains, to be brought; and we were much surprised to see him
eat with a very hearty appetite for we imagined that he was not
hungry, as he had done so little honour to our General's table.
We had no reason to suppose, that our dishes had not been to his
taste, since the other natives were perfectly satisfied with
them. Perhaps it is a point of etiquette, for his majesty not to
indulge his appetite when he accepts an invitation, particularly
from strangers. He afterwards made a speech, in which, no doubt,
he expressed our friendly disposition toward them, and our
intention to punish all who should be guilty of robbing us; and
then he repaired to the island of Tongataboo.</p>
<p>Just before night Feenou brought the sabre which had been
taken from one of our gunners. He returned it to the General, and
made him a present of a very large fish, of the perch genus, the
<i>perca guttata</i> (the <i>hind</i> of Catesby). Before he left
us, he informed the canoes around, that we should begin to trade
with them again the next day.</p>
<p>30th. Very early the next morning our boat was sent on shore
to the island of Panga&iuml;motoo, with a quantity of stuffs and
hardware. The canoes round our ship were several times desired in
vain to repair to the market, which had just been re-established
on that little island. We fancied, however, that we had
discovered effectual means of driving them away from our ships,
when we saw them take flight with precipitancy, on some water
being spouted on them from an engine; but the success of this
mode was of short duration for soon finding that they ran no risk
but of a wetting, we might play the engine on them as long as we
pleased, and they would not stir. Dauribeau, the captain of the
Recherche, then gave orders, to upset them when any of our boats,
went ashore and presently the launch was sent off for the nearest
part of the island, with various instruments for making
astronomical observations. Accordingly our people pulled away,
steering directly for a canoe which had three men and two girls
on board; and, as they carried away the out-rigger, we should
soon have had the vexation of seeing these two pretty lasses
tumbled into the water; but to prevent this accident, the men
jumped overboard, and two of them steadied the canoe, while the
third set the out-rigger to rights, and then they paddled away
for Tongataboo without delay. The other canoes, warned of their
danger, had the address to avoid such of our boats as afterwards
endeavoured to upset them.</p>
<p>Feenou came in board very early in the morning, with Toobou,
the king's brother. These two chiefs invited the General to a
feast, which the King intended to give him the next day but one,
in the island of Tongataboo. Having requested us to let them see
the effects of our swivels and carronades, we gratified them with
a specimen, at which they showed equal marks of affright and
admiration.</p>
<p>When we arrived on shore, we observed with surprise, that the
market was very well supplied, though there were not a fourth as
many of the natives present, as on the preceding days. Every
thing there was going on with the greatest order.</p>
<p>The same officer (Lagrandi&egrave;re) had still the management
of the traffic with them for victualling the ships. He was
singularly delighted with the thought of having procured some
ends of iron hoops, to be cut into the shape of carpenter's
chisels, and of having turned them to good account in dealing
with the natives. Yet we had on board a great number of very good
tools, which had been brought from Europe, to give them; and we
could not conceive how it was possible, that the satisfaction he
must have felt at procuring them durable instruments, should not
have been of more weight with him, than any other
consideration.</p>
<p>Traversing the interior of the island, we saw a barber
employed in shaving one of the chiefs, after-their fashion. The
chief sat with his back leaning against his hut. The barber's
razor consisted of the two shells of the <i>solen radiatus</i>
(violet-coloured, or radiated razor-sheath), one of which he held
firmly against the skin with the left hand, while with the right
he applied the edge of the other to the hair, as near the root as
he could, and by repeated scraping, brought it away, scarcely
more than a hair at a time. We were astonished at so much
patience; and left him, as might be supposed, long before he had
finished his operation.</p>

<br>
<p>The art of the potter has made no great progress among these
people. We saw in their possession some very porous earthen
vessels, which they had baked indeed, but very slightly. In these
they kept fresh water, which would have quickly filtered through
them, if they had not taken the precaution to give them a coating
of resin. Vessels thus made, could be of no use to them in
dressing victuals. The natives showed us some of a tolerably
elegant form, which they said had been brought from Feejee. (See
Plate XXXI. Fig. 8.) We saw them drinking in companies out of
cups of this sort, round which they put a net of a pretty large
mesh, to be able to carry them about easily. When they had
emptied a few of them, they went to fill them again out of little
holes, which they had dug in the ground, that the water might
flow into them. Though these holes were about a hundred and fifty
toises only from the shore, the water was scarcely to be called
brackish. As we found it necessary to replace what we had
expended since leaving Adventure Bay, we dug a hole in the
ground, more than a yard deep, and at a good distance from the
shore, and it was presently supplied with very drinkable water.
With this we filled small casks, which the natives of the
<i>toua</i> class were very ready to carry on their shoulders to
the boat; but the part on which the iron hoops of the cask rested
being bare, was soon galled, and they gave up their work. We had
on board, however, a little cart, which we had brought from
Europe, and on this they readily consented to draw the barrels
down to the shore. The <i>touas</i>, twelve in number, sung to
mark the time of uniting their efforts in pulling. These twelve
soon increased to twenty, and at first required no addition to
the pay we had agreed upon for each turn, which was twelve glass
beads; a few days after, however, they demanded a higher price
for their labour. They assured us that we should not find water
at Tongataboo, except in ponds, or by digging holes in the ground
as at Panga&iuml;motoo; but that very good spring-water was to be
procured at Kao, a small island near Tofoa.</p>
<p>I had not yet seen a dog since we had been at anchor. In the
afternoon a native brought one to sell us, assuring us that its
flesh was very good eating. They give the name of <i>kouli</i> to
this animal, which in these islands is commonly of a fallow
colour, small, and pretty nearly resembling the Pomeranian
dog.</p>
<p>Citizen Riche informed us, that the assassin, who was
mentioned above, having been conveyed to the western coast of
Panga&iuml;motoo the preceding night, by one of the Esperance's
boats, had hesitated some time about going on shore, and had
inquired of the boat's crew, with an air of great uneasiness,
which way Feenou had gone, when he went on shore in the evening.
At last he ventured to land, but crawled along the beach on his
hands and knees for more than three hundred paces, before he
durst, proceed into the interior part of the island.</p>
<p>Close by the market, to which the natives brought their
different kinds of provision, we observed a woman of
extraordinary corpulence, at least fifty years of age, round whom
the natives formed a very numerous circle. Some of them paid her
their respects in our presence, by taking her right foot and
placing it on their head, making a very low bow; others came and
touched the sole of her right foot with their right hands.
Several chiefs, whom we knew, paid her other marks of their
reverence. We were informed that this lady was Queen Tin&eacute;.
Her hair, cut to the length of about two inches and halt, was
covered, as well as part of her forehead, with a reddish
powder.</p>
<p>After having expressed her inclination to go on board the
Recherche, to see the Commander of our expedition, the invited us
to accompany her, and immediately set off with part of her court.
She presented General Dentrecasteaux with several very fine mats,
a hog, and some yams; and he gave her in return various pieces of
stuff, on which the appeared to set a great value.</p>
<p>Desirous of knowing what effect our vocal music, accompanied
by a violin and cittern, would have on these people, we
entertained them with a specimen, and had the pleasure of
perceiving that it was pleasing to them; but a few tunes on a
bird-organ obtained more striking marks of their applause.</p>
<p>Queen Tin&eacute;, unwilling to remain in our debt, ordered
some young girls of her suite to sing.</p>
<p>One of the prettiest immediately rose, and we did not fail to
applaud her performance. She sang, indeed, nothing but which she
continued</p>
<p align="center"><a name="score" id="score"></a><img alt="" src=
"1204001h-images/score.jpg"><br>
<br>

<p>repeating for half an hour at least; but she displayed so much
grace in the action with which the accompanied this air, that we
were sorry she finished so soon. She moved her arms forward, one
after the other, following the measure, and at the same time
raised her feet alternately, though without quitting her place;
the time she marked with her fore-finger, which, after having
been bent by the thumb, was let go against the middle finger; and
sometimes by moving the thumb against the fore and middle
fingers. The beauty of these movements depended greatly on the
fine shape of the hand and arm, which is so common among these
people, and was striking in this young woman. Soon after two
other young girls repeated the same air, which they sang in
parts, one singing uniformly a fifth to the other; and several
men rose to dance to the music of their melodious voices. These
marked the time by movements analogous to those of the young
women, at first with their feet, and frequently carrying one of
their hands to the opposite arm.</p>
<p>We took the words of this air (<i>apou lelley</i>, charming
evening) as a compliment from the islanders, congratulating
themselves on spending the afternoon with us.</p>
<p>The queen tasted the different dishes we offered her, but she
gave a particular preference to preserved bananas. Our
ma&icirc;tre-d'hotel stood behind her in readiness to remove her
plate, but she saved him the trouble, by keeping both it and the
table-cloth for herself.</p>
<p>Tin&eacute; was extremely tenacious of the honours, which the
chiefs could not refuse to pay when they met her; and hence some
of them avoided her presence. Feenou, and the brother of King
Toobou were on board, and had just promised to stay and dine with
us when she arrived. They immediately intreated, with great
earnestness, that she might not be permitted to come upon deck;
but she came on board at once without ceremony, and the two
chiefs hastened into their canoes, because otherwise they would
have been obliged, as many of the natives assured us, to come and
take her right foot, and carry it very respectfully to their
heads, as a token of their inferiority. The queen informed us
with an air of satisfaction, that King Toobou himself was bound
to pay her these marks of respect, because it was from her he
derived his dignity.</p>
<p>After having informed us that the purposed to take up her
abode in the island of Pang&acirc;imotoo, as long as we staid in
the road, the invited the General to come and reside on shore,
and sleep in her house. I do not imagine that the old lady had
any other intention, than to procure him a more pleasant and
healthy residence than he had on board; but the General had no
opportunity of ascertaining with precision her motive for this
obliging offer, for he did not accept her invitation.</p>
<p>One of our sailors had in his hand a bit of bacon, which he
was going to eat, when F&eacute;ogo, one of Tin&eacute;'s maids
of honour, appeared desirous of tasting it. He offered it to her,
and the received it with thankfulness; but as she could not think
of eating it in the royal presence, the Queen had the
complaisance to go and sit about twelve paces off, that her
attendant might be at a distance from her; yet before the quitted
her place, she had received from the young lady the same marks of
respect, as others of the natives had already paid her in our
presence.</p>
<p>Two hours before sun-set, Tin&eacute; expressed a wish to
return to the island of Panga&iuml;motoo, and soon after went in
our barge with part of her attendants.</p>
<p>We had seen in Bligh's narrative, that, just as he was
preparing to quit the island of Tofoa, the sailor, whom he had
sent on shore to cast off the mooring of the launch, was killed
by one of the natives. The people of Tongataboo informed us that
the murder was committed by a chief named Moudoulalo; but we
could not learn the motive which had induced him to this
excessive barbarity. All of us were astonished at the coolness
with which the natives told the tale.</p>
<p>We had already seen several knives of English manufacture in
the hand of the natives; and this morning early Feenou brought us
a bayonet that he had received from Captain Cook, the point of
which he requested us to sharpen, as it was blunted.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we visited some islets, lying at a very
little distance from each other between Tongataboo and
Panga&iuml;motoo. They are all connected together by a shoal,
which is almost wholly dry at low water.</p>
<p>We first arrived at a bank of sand, lately emerged from the
water, on which, however, a commencement of vegetation already
appeared. From this, called by the natives <i>Iniou</i>, we
proceeded to the little isle of <i>Manima</i>; to reach which we
were obliged to cross a tolerably rapid current, not above six
feet deep soon after the tide had begun to make in and the water
of which was warmed by passing over a beach strongly heated by
the rays of the sun. Here we found one of the Queen's maids of
honour; to whom I presented a few beads; and immediately she sent
to catch a couple of fowls to offer us. These we took the trouble
of carrying, lest she should have been chagrined at our refusal
of them. She was very careful to let us know that she did not
give them by way of barter; affecting to repeat with an air of
dignity <i>ika&iuml; fokatau</i>, and to inform us by the word
<i>adoup&eacute;</i>, that she made us a present of them. Indeed
the chiefs never offered to barter their articles for ours; they
made us presents, and received whatever we thought proper to
give.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that the natives brought to our market
several cocks, but very seldom any hens. These they kept to hatch
chickens, and of course they sold us but few eggs likewise.</p>
<p>The two fowls now given us were hens, and had been caught in
our sight with the same kind of net, as we had seen employed to
take fish in the open road.</p>
<p>The soil of the island of Manima is little cultivated; we saw
in it, however, a few fields of yams, cocoa trees, and
plantains.</p>
<p>After crossing a channel as shallow as the preceding, we
arrived at <i>Oneata</i>. Having the curiosity to examine the
inside of a habitation, constructed with much art, we were
greatly surprized to see a chief, who, sitting very gravely near
the middle of the hut, permitted a fore-mast-man of our ship to
take the greatest freedoms with one of the prettiest girls in the
island. He informed us, on offering some cocoa nuts, that he
could not allow us to drink their liquor within his dwelling. We
could not have supposed that the witness of the party, we had
just happened to interrupt under his roof, would have been so
rigid to persons who came thither merely to quench their thirst;
but we made a point of not disputing the matter with him.</p>
<p>Two natives arrived in the mean time, bringing in their hands
some very ripe cocoa-nuts opened, and with these we saw them
prepare a. dish, of which they appeared to be very fond. With
shells, fixed in a piece of wood by way of handle, they scraped
out the nuts, which they bruised with a very hot stone, so as to
make a pulp of it; this they reduced to the consistence of a
pudding, after mixing it with some fresh roasted bread-fruit;
which done, they formed it into balls; and these they ate
immediately.</p>
<p>Under a large shed we saw a double canoe, forty feet long,
placed there by the natives to preserve it against the injuries
of the weather.</p>
<p>We were not far from the little island called <i>Nougou
Nougou</i>, when some of the natives pointed out to us an islet,
by the name of <i>Mackaha</i>, very near Panga&iuml;motoo. We
proceeded toward the lost island, and, as the tide was rising, we
were obliged to wade up to our middles, to reach it. We soon
reached the place, where the queen kept a regular court. It was
under the shade of a very bushy bread-fruit tree, at a small
distance from our market. There she was giving a concert of vocal
music, in which Futtafaihe sung, he regulating the time, which
all the musicians followed with the greatest accuracy. Some
performed their parts by accompanying the simple melody of the
rest with various modulations. In these we occasionally noticed
discords, which seemed to be highly agreeable to the ears of the
natives.</p>
<p>During this concert we saw a great number of people arrive,
each carrying a long pole on his shoulder, at the ends of which
hung fish and yams; and with these they immediately formed the
base of a quadrangular pyramid, which they built up nearly to the
height of two yards. This was a present for General
Dentrecasteaux; to whom Tin&eacute; was giving an entertainment.
She warned us against the danger of walking alone about the
island in the evening, telling us, that thieves might take
advantage of the darkness, to knock us down with their clubs, and
then rob us.</p>
<p>On the 1st of APRIL, at six in the morning, the General set
off, agreeably to the invitation of King Toobou, who meant to,
give him an entertainment in the island of Tongataboo. We
accompanied him, with almost all the officers of the expedition,
and a detachment well armed.</p>
<p>Some of the natives, who followed us in their canoes, made us
coast along shore toward the west for some time, in order to
conduct us to a place, where, they informed us, we should find a
great number of the natives assembled with several of their
chiefs. As soon as we landed, Feenou came to meet the General,
and accompany him into the midst of a large assembly of the
natives, with <i>Omala&iuml;</i> at their head. This chief
invited him to sit down on his left hand, after having ordered
the natives, to arrange themselves in a circle round him. We
rested ourselves a moment on some mats spread on the ground,
under the shade of several trees, some of which were the
<i>cerbera manghas</i> (Indian mango tree), others the
<i>hernandia ovigera</i> (ovigerous jack-in-the-box tree), the
fruit of which is used by these people as an ornament. Soon after
we went to see a very lofty shed, which served as a shelter to a
war canoe, eighty feet long, the inside of which was strengthened
by very stout knees, placed about a yard distant from each other.
Feenou, after having made us admire the construction of this
double canoe, informed us, that he had taken it in an engagement,
which he had fought with the people of the Feejee Islands.</p>
<p>As we proceeded toward the west, we crossed a spacious
enclosure, formed of palisades, the posts of which, placed in an
oblique direction, were tolerably near to each other, within this
grew bread-fruit trees, plantain trees, the <i>corypha
umbraculifera</i> (great fan palm), &amp;c. Farther on, in an
enclosure of much less extent, we found a small hut, of a conical
figure, in which, we were informed, were deposited the remains of
a chief lately dead; and a caution was given us, that entering
into it was prohibited.</p>
<p>After this we walked on near a quarter of an hour in a narrow
path, bounded on each side by palisades, till we reached an
extensive esplanade, where King Toobou was soon to arrive. (See
Plate XXVI.)</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image15" id="Image15"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>PLATE XXVI. <i>An Entertainment given to General
Dentrecasteaux by Toobou, King of the Friendly
Islands</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>We were invited by Omala&iuml;, to take the cool air under a
shed, the shape of which was nearly half an oval, twelve yards in
length, by five in breadth. The roof, covered with the leaves of
the <i>vacoua</i>, which rendered it impenetrable to the heavier
shower, had an elevation of about five yards and a half, and
descended within three quarters of a yard of the ground, on which
some fine mats were spread. The floor was raised six or eight
inches higher than the surrounding earth, which secured it from
all danger of being overflowed; and the roof was supported by ten
pillars.</p>
<p>At length Toobou arrived with two of his daughters, who had
poured on their hair an abundance of cocoa-nut oil, and wore each
a necklace, made with the pretty seeds of the <i>abrus
precatorius</i>.</p>
<p>The natives formed a great concourse on all sides. According
to our estimation, at least four thousand of them were present.
The place of honour, no doubt, was on the king's left hand, for
it was there he invited the General to sit, who immediately
ordered the presents, which he intended for Toobou, to be brought
forward. The king expressed much thankfulness for them; but, of
all that was offered him, nothing so much excited the admiration
of this numerous assembly, as a piece of crimson damask, the
lively colour of which produced from all sides an exclamation of
eho! eho! which they continued repeating a long time, with an
appearance of the greatest surprise. They uttered the same
exclamation, when we unrolled a few pieces of ribbon, in which
red was the predominant colour. The General then presented a
she-goat with kid, a he-goat, and a couple of rabbits, one a
buck, the other a doe, of which the king promised to take the
greatest care, and to let them breed and multiply in the
island.</p>
<p>Omala&iuml;, who, Toobou told us, was his son, also received
some presents from the General, as did several other chiefs.</p>
<p>On our right, toward the north-east, were thirteen musicians,
seated under the shade of a bread-fruit tree, which was loaded
with a prodigious quantity of fruit. They sung together in
different parts. Four of them held in their hands a bamboo of a
yard, or a yard and a half long, with which they beat time on the
ground; the longest, these bamboos sometimes serving to mark the
measure. The sounds these instruments gave approached tolerably
near those of the tambourin, and the following were their
proportions to each other. Two bamboos of the middle length were
in unison, the longest was a note and a half below them, and the
shortest was two notes and a half above. The musician, that sung
the counter-tenor, made his voice be heard much above the rest,
though it was a little hoarse; and at the same time he
accompanied it by beating with two little sticks of
<i>casuarina</i> on a bamboo, six yards long, cleft throughout
its whole length. Three musicians placed before the others
expressed the subject of their song by action also, which no
doubt they had thoroughly studied, for their gestures, were
performed all together, and in the same manner. Every now and
then they turned toward the king, making not ungraceful motions
with their arms; sometimes they bowed their heads quickly, till
the chin touched the breast, and shook them several times,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>In the mean time, Toobou presented the General with some
pieces of stuff fabricated with the bark of the paper mulberry
tree, causing them to be spread abroad with a great deal of
ostentation, that we might be sensible of all the value of the
gift.</p>
<p>One of his ministers, who sat on his right hand, ordered
<i>kava</i> to be prepared, and presently a wooden bowl, of an
oval shape, and a yard long (See Plate XXXI, Fig. 9), was brought
in full of this liquor.</p>
<p>The musicians, no doubt, had reserved their choicest pieces
for this instant; as now, at every pause they made, the cry of
<i>m&acirc;li, m&acirc;li</i>, resounded from every quarter, and
the reiterated applauses of the natives informed us, that this
music made a very strong and pleasing impression upon them.</p>
<p>The <i>kava</i> was then distributed to the different chiefs,
by him who had given orders for its preparation. He sent it to
them in cups, which were made on the spot with the leaves of the
plantain, and every time he offered a cup, he pronounced, in a
pretty loud voice, the name of him for whom it was intended.
Feenou he served first, saying <i>may&eacute; maa Feenou</i>; and
he did the same to the other chiefs, all whose names we could
easily pronounce. Some of these, perhaps, the reader will not be
displeased to hear; they were <i>Nufatoa</i>, <i>Fef&eacute;</i>,
<i>Mafi</i>, <i>Famouna</i>, <i>Fatoumona</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We may presume, it was necessary, that some of the chiefs
should judge of the goodness of the liquor, before the king
drank; for it was not offered to him till it came to the fourth
cup. None was sent to his daughters; and indeed it always
appeared to us, that this liquor was reserved entirely for the
men.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the presence of the General, the king very
soon fell asleep, and snored aloud, with his legs crossed, and
his head bowed down almost to his knees. When he awoke, we showed
him a drawing of a cow, and asked if that given to King Poulaho
by Captain Cook had bred. He knew the animal perfectly well,
which he called <i>boakka, toote</i>, and told us, there were
none now at Tongataboo, but there were at Hapaee. Several of the
natives, however, assured us, imitating at the same time
tolerably well their lowing, that there were some at Tongataboo,
though others denied it. Thus we were unable to learn what had
become of the bull and cow, which Captain Cook had left on the
island; and it was the same with regard to the horse and mare,
which he had given to Feenou. Perhaps they were afraid that we
should require some of these animals from them.</p>
<p>Quitting the assembly, we walked toward the east, ascending a
gentle slope. At first we passed along, paths bordered with
palisadoes; but we bon reached the end of these, and came to
fields of yams fully cropped. Farther on, the ground, recently
turned up, exhibited every appearance of fertility.</p>
<p>We soon reached a delightful spot on the top of a little hill,
where the natives had formed a sort of rotunda, about four yards
wide, with palisades, and some shrubs cut with art. Under this
rotunda we still saw the remains of <i>kava</i> roots, that had
been chewed; and round it were twenty-four small huts,
constructed in a circle of fifteen or sixteen yards diameter.
These huts were all covered with cocoa leaves, interlaced
together their shape was nearly that of half; an oval, three
yards long by two broad; and they were divided at the top,
throughout their whole length; by a very narrow slit, which was
the only opening in them, though there was no entering without
separating its edges. We were informed by some of the natives;
who had followed us, that the king frequently came to this place,
to drink <i>kava</i>, with several of the chiefs of the island,
and that then each went to take a nap in these sort of huts.</p>
<p>On returning toward the place of entertainment, we went round
the largest circle formed by the natives; in the midst of which
we saw several <i>egui's</i> wives. The wife of Futtafaihe
attracted almost every eye by her beauty; but she took care, from
time to time, to acquaint us that it was her duty to preserve her
fidelity to her husband. This the expressed with great
simplicity, by <i>taboo, mitzi mitzi</i>, words of which I cannot
give a literal translation, as may be seen by the vocabulary of
the language of the Friendly Islands, which will be found at the
end of this work.</p>
<p>We observed in the hands of one lady, who appeared to be of
some consideration, a sort of mat, about two feet square, and of
a white colour, made of the hair of a horse's tail. Possibly they
were obtained from those which Cook left on the island; but she
would not satisfy our curiosity on this head.</p>
<p>The King had ordered his subjects to bring the presents which
he intended for the General; and ever since half after ten we had
seen many arrive at intervals, each of them carrying on his
shoulder a bamboo two yards long, at the ends of which hung small
fishes of the <i>scarus</i> and <i>ch&aelig;todon</i> genera,
most of them ready dressed, and wrapped in cocoa-leaves; others
brought bread-fruit, yams, &amp;c.; and presently, by laying
their bamboos across each other, they raised two portions of
triangular pyramids, one of them two yards high, the other one
yard only. The raw fish already began to stink very much.</p>
<p>About one o'clock in the afternoon Toobou went away, without
saying a word to any person. We then left the assembly, and were
accompanied to the place where we landed by Feenou and
Omala&iuml;, who ordered a whole hog just dressed, some fish,
yams, and bread-fruit, to be brought us, and invited us to sit
down to our repast; but their hog not being half ready, for such
is their usual mode of cookery, we preferred going on board to
dinner.</p>
<p>They then requested us to accept these different articles of
provision, which they ordered to be carried into our long-boat,
while others of the natives, in obedience to the orders of
Toobou, were filling it with the eatables taken from the
pyramids, that had been erected for our Commander. In a very
little time, every thing was ready for our departure.</p>
<p>Our boats having been obliged to push off from the shore, on
account of the low water, we could not reach them but by crossing
a coral bank covered with water for more than three hundred
paces; but we found the natives extremely civil; for, that we
might not be wetted, they carried us to some rocks just above
water, to which others came with their canoes to fetch us, and
conveyed us to our boats.</p>
<p>The men who carried us appeared well satisfied with the
articles we gave them for their trouble; but in this short
passage others contrived to gain still more, by robbing us at
their ease, after having crept slily behind us, while their
countrymen had us on their backs. All these pickpockets, however,
did not meet with equal success, for we gave chace to some, whom
we forced to restore what they had taken.</p>
<p>As soon as we got on board, the commanding officer informed us
that, during our absence, he had caused a native to be seized, at
the moment when he was going off with several articles of
hardware, which he had stolen between decks; and that Futtafaihe,
reprobating the habit of pilfering, of which the natives were
every day guilty towards us, had affected to say publicly, that
the culprit should be punished with death. But this, they soon
perceived, was all artifice on the part of the chief: for, as
soon as they began to inflict the punishment of the rope's end on
the pilferer, he interceded for, his pardon, which, however, was
not granted; and Futtafaihe seemed to be greatly affected at his
receiving the five-and-twenty stripes, which he had been
condemned to suffer.</p>
<p>2d. Pretty early the next morning, we received a visit from
<i>Tonga</i>, who accompanied his father Toobou, the King's
brother. They both took a great deal of trouble to explain to us
all the dignities of their family.</p>
<p>Tonga several times gave us proofs of great intelligence, in
particular when we showed him a chart of the Friendly Islands
constructed by Captain Cook. He first glanced his eye rapidly
over the archipelago; and then, stopping at Tongataboo, he
observed to us, that several reefs of rocks had been laid down
which did not exit; informing us that, to the north-west we
should find a passage, through which we might easily carry our
vessels into the open sea. This information was the more
important to us, because we had supposed, that we must get out of
the road, through the narrow channel by which we had entered, and
in which we should probably have had to work out against the
prevailing winds, which would be extremely favourable to our
passing out through the new channel. Tonga offered to show it us,
and would sleep on board that night, to conduct to it Citizen
Beaupr&eacute;, our engineer-geographer, who would ascertain its
position.</p>
<p>On an excursion we made into the country nearest the anchoring
place, we found among a group of the natives a young person, who
had all the characteristics of an albino, and who was in other
respects of a very sickly complexion, as is commonly the case,
for this deviation from nature is owing to a state of
disease.</p>
<p>3d. In the morning of the third, having surprised some of the
natives, who were making off to the coast of Tongataboo with some
articles, which they had just stolen from our ship, the
commanding officer sent some of our people in pursuit of them;
when one of the party, who had caused himself to be announced as
a chief, said, that he would punish them himse1f, and would bring
us the next day the things that had been stolen. But it appeared,
that he was connected with the thieves, for he took care never to
return on board again.</p>
<p>When we went ashore, Omala&iuml; accompanied us, and admired
the boat's rudder for a long time. He was desirous of steering
himself, and did so with great skill. These people use nothing
but paddles for steering their canoes.</p>
<p>The ladies, in dressing their hair, made use of cocoa-nut oil,
previously perfumed with a small seed, which they call <i>kava
kali</i>, and which is gathered on the island of Tongataboo. On
examining a little of the oil, we observed, that some of the
bruised nut, which in their language is called <i>mou</i>, was
mixed with it. They exposed the nuts to the sun, after having
spread them on mats, in order to dry them, before they press out
the oil, with which the women anoint the upper parts of the body,
no doubt to preserve the suppleness of the skin, and to prevent
too copious perspiration. They preserve the oil in the seedpod of
the <i>melodinus scandens</i>, after having taken out the seed.
When we bought some of these little phials, a representation of
which may be seen in Plate XXXI, Fig. 14, we frequently threw
away the oil, lest it should run out in our pockets; but the
women, being us with regret waste an article which they much
value, commonly came forward, to receive it on their heads, and
then, with their hands, they spread it over their shoulders and
arms.</p>
<p>The natives had already sold us a great number of clubs of
various forms, and fashioned with skill, as may be seen in Plate
XXXIII; and we saw several who were employed in cutting out
others with shark's teeth fixed at the extremity of a piece of
wood (Plate XXXII, Fig. 23). We were astonished to see them cut
with a child like this the wood of the <i>casuarina</i>,
notwithstanding its extreme hardness. Others already handled the
iron tools they had obtained from us with considerable dexterity.
All these workmen had a little bag of matting, containing
pumice-stones, with which they polished their work.</p>

<br>
<p>I observed several cotton-plants of the species called
<i>gossipium religiosum</i>, growing in uncultivated places; and
I saw with surprise, that the fine cotton, which might be
procured from it in abundance, was not used by the natives in any
of their works.</p>
<p>About nine in the evening we perceived a canoe close by one of
our buoys. Apprehensive that the people in her would cut the
buoy-rope, we sent one of our boats in chace of her; but the boat
had scarcely put off from the ship's side, when somebody was
heard to fall into the water. Our men immediately hastened to the
person's assistance; when seeing him swim away, without speaking
a word, we had no doubt but it was a thief making off with his
booty. He was pursued immediately, frequently escaped by diving,
and was not taken at last till he had been wounded in the thigh
with a boat-hook, which was employed to catch hold of him. As
soon as he was brought on board, he was secured upon deck, where
he remained all night. He confessed that, having taken several
things out of our launch, he had conveyed them to the canoe,
which was in waiting for them near our buoy, and had made off
without delay. In half an hour afterwards, we fancied we saw her
slowly approaching our ship astern, in search of the native whom
we had seized. The men in our yawl immediately pulled away toward
her, and when they came up with her, they found in her only one
man and two paddles; but they soon discovered that they had
brought us another thief, who had roamed about the ship till the
arrival of another canoe, that came to convey him ashore. As soon
as our people got sight of her, they gave her chace, but the
natives in her paddled away with such speed, that it was
impossible to overtake them.</p>
<p>4th. At three o'clock in the morning Citizen Beaupr&eacute;
returned with Tonga, after having examined the passage toward the
north-west, of which Tonga had given us information. They had run
along very close to <i>Attata</i>, which they, had left on the
larboard, as they sailed from our anchorage. <i>Kepa</i>, the
chief of this little island, had come to meet them, and, received
them with great civility. In the morning he came to see us, and
inquired after Captain Cook, who, he told us, was his friend. On
being informed of his death, he could not restrain from tears,
and took out of his girdle a shark's tooth, with which he was
going to wound his cheeks, in order to express the violence of
his grief, if we had not prevented him.</p>
<p>The art of physic is practised among those people with a
parade of mystery. One of our crew, who had accompanied us along
the beach, having hurt his wrist by an exertion, a native offered
to ease the pain, and succeeded pretty quickly by squeezing and
pressing the part injured, (<i>en massant la partie
bless&eacute;e</i>); at the same time he blew upon it repeatedly,
intending, no doubt, that we should ascribe the cure to his
breath.</p>
<p>On the sea-side we saw several natives occupied in squaring
some large stones of the calcareous kind, which, we were
informed, were intended to be employed in burying a chief, who
was related to Futtafaihe. They first removed the earth from
them, and then separated them by breaking them with a volcanic
pebble, round which, near the middle, they took the precaution to
wrap pieces of matting, to prevent the splinters from flying into
their eyes. They were scarcely below the surface of the earth,
and arranged in strata about four inches thick.</p>
<p>We had before observed among these people a game with the
hands, which they call <i>l&eacute;agui</i>, and which requires
great attention. Two play at it, and it consists in one's
endeavouring instantly to repeat the signs made by the other,
while the former makes signs in his turn, which the other is to
repeat in like manner. We saw two in, a party at no great
distance from our market, who were so quick at this exercise,
that our eyes were scarcely able to follow their motions.</p>
<p>Citizen Legrand, who had been sent the day before to discover
some passages to leeward of our anchorage, returned in the
evening, after having found two towards the north.</p>
<p>5th. Early in the morning I set off, with all the other
naturalists of our expedition, for the island of Tongataboo. Some
of the natives would carry us thither in their little canoes, but
most of us, not being sufficiently careful in preserving our
equilibrium, upset them as soon as they put off. We then
determined to go in their double canoes, which they managed very
skilfully, and soon set us ashore, making the passage under sail.
The mast was set up in that canoe which was to leeward.</p>
<p>We were obliged to get out of the canoes more than six hundred
paces from the shore, on account of the shallowness of the water,
through which the natives carried us on their backs. They then
showed us the dwelling of Toobou, the king's brother, where we
stopped; and the gardener made him a present of several kinds of
seeds, that were brought from Europe, chiefly of culinary
vegetables, which the chief promised us to cultivate with care.
We left him, to strike into the woods; the soil of which was of a
calcareous nature; and we observed in different places heaps of
madrepores, which proved that the waters of the sea had long
covered the ground. On the trees we observed many large bats, of,
the species called <i>vespertilio vampyrus</i> (the vampire bat),
which the inhabitants told us were very good food.</p>
<p>We were near the middle of the wood, when a native, who had
crept behind one of our party, snatched out of his hands a pair
of pincers, which he used for catching insects. The thief
instantly took to his heels; but he had scarcely run four-score
paces, when, finding himself briskly and closely pursued, he
placed himself behind a tree, round which he turned several
times, to avoid being caught. Our companion, however, laid hold
of his clothes, and fancied himself on the point of recovering
his pincers, as he imagined he had the thief fast; but what was
his surprise, when the other loosened his girdle, and left his
clothes behind him, to escape with the article he had stolen!</p>
<p>We soon got into the fields, where we saw the property of each
individual divided into small enclosures, surrounded by
palisades, and completely cultivated. The Indian cole, <i>arum
esculentum</i>, grew there vigorously among many other
vegetables, which I have already mentioned, and which equally
with it are used as food by the natives. The sugar-canes we saw
there, were planted at a pretty considerable distance from each
other, under the shade of the <i>inocarpus edulis</i>, the fruit
of which these people road and eat, its flavour much resembling
that of the chesnut. In the same enclosure, we saw several of the
orange-leaved Indian mulberry trees (<i>morinda citrifolia</i>),
loaded as with ripe fruit, which is much esteemed by the natives.
They brought us a great quantity of this fruit for a few days
when we first anchored here but we refused it on account of its
insipidity.</p>
<p>After, proceeding some way to the eastward, we stopped to
examine two little huts, erected in an enclosure of small extent,
and shadowed by some fine shaddock trees, loaded with fruit, and
several <i>casuarina</i> trees. Some natives informed us, that
the remains of two chiefs of Toobou's family had been deposited
in them; we lifted up the mat, which closed the entrance of the
larger. The surface of the ground within was covered with sand,
and toward the middle, we observed an oblong square; formed of
small pebbles of different colours. None of the natives who were
with us, would gather any of the shaddocks, no doubt from respect
to the dead, though we desired to buy some of them. They said
that they could not sell them to us.</p>
<p>In a short time we returned to the house of Toobou, to whom we
made a complaint against the stealer of the pincers. He promised
to return them to us the next day; and he kept his word. This
chief pressed us to spend the night in his habitation; but we
would not accept his offer, left our absence should occasion any
uneasiness on board.</p>
<p>These people are accustomed to geld their pigs, with a view to
render the flesh more delicate. We saw this operation performed
on a very young pig, which one of the natives laid on the back,
after having tied his legs, while another made an incision into
the scrotum with the edge of a piece of bamboo, and removed the
testicles, separating them from the parts to which they adhered,
with all the dexterity of an anatomist.</p>
<p>Toobou treated us with fowls broiled on the coals; yams,
plantains, and bread-fruit, roasted under the ashes, and the
liquor of the cocoa-nut to drink.</p>
<p>Three of the daughters of this chief came to keep us company.
They talked a great deal; and though we were very hungry, they
did not scruple to interrupt us frequently, by forcing us to
answer their questions, which related chiefly to the customs of
the French, particularly those of the women. As they observed our
seamen address every one indiscriminately, they enquired with
earnestness, whether the women were not <i>tabooed</i> in France;
that is to say, whether they enjoyed the same liberty as most of
those in their island.</p>
<p>The answer, by which we endeavoured to convey to them an idea
of our customs, pleased them highly. They informed us, that the
<i>eguis</i> (chiefs) of Tongataboo had several wives; and asked
how many wives a French <i>egui</i> usually had. When they
understood that each had but one, they burst out into a laugh;
and we had great trouble to persuade them, that the <i>egui
la&iuml;</i> (kings) of Europe, had no more, which gave them no
very high idea of their power.</p>
<p>Of all the articles with which we presented the ladies,
odoriferous waters were most esteemed. They appeared to us as
passionately fond of perfumes, as most of the inhabitants of warm
climates; and yet their bodies were partly besmeared with
cocoa-nut oil, which diffused a disagreeable odour.</p>
<p>One of the finest girls in this party having the little finger
of the left hand wrapped round with a piece of stuff of the paper
mulberry, which appeared bloody, we begged to see the wound.
Another immediately took down from the roof, under which we sat,
a piece of a plantain leaf, out of which she drew the first two
joints of the little finger of the young girl, who had them very
lately cut off, in order to cure her, as she told us, of a severe
disease. She showed us the hatchet, made of a volcanic stone,
which had been used for the operation; and informed us, that the
edge had first been placed at the extremity of the third phalanx
of the finger, and then the operator struck a smart blow on the
head of this hatchet with the handle of another.</p>
<p>This young person soon left us; but, before she went away, she
kissed Toobou's daughters after the manner of the inhabitants of
the Friendly Islands, which is by touching with the tip of the
nose the nose of the person you salute. It is remarkable, that
these islanders, who pretty much resemble Europeans, have,
notwithstanding, the extremity of the nose a little flattened;
this slight deformity may very probably be owing to the custom,
of which I have just spoken.</p>
<p>Toobou's daughters changed names with us; an established
custom among these people, to testify their affection. They then
played a very monotonous duet on flutes made of bamboo; but we
were much amused at seeing them blow with the nose into a hole at
the extremity of the instrument, in order to make it sound. We
received from them as a present some combs of a very elegant
shape, represented in Plate XXXII. Fig. 21.</p>
<p>The natives, who formed a circle round us, having stolen
several of our things, we complained of it to Toobou's daughters,
who soon after left us without saying a word, probably to go in
search of their father, and request him to come and put an end to
these pilferings; but, as we could not wait till their return, we
soon began to walk toward the island of Panga&iuml;motoo. The
tide being very low, we easily passed over the shoals, which
connect the islets with the principal island. We stopped about
half way at a hut, where we were witnesses of the manner, in
which a woman was eating her meal, that appeared to us laughable
enough. Sitting near a post, and motionless as a statue, the
opened her mouth from time to time, to receive models of
bread-fruit, which another woman put into it. We were informed,
that it was not allowable far her to touch any kind of food with
her own hands, because a few days before she had washed the body
of a deceased chief.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Panga&iuml;motoo, Queen Tin&eacute;,
sitting under a shed covered with cocoa-leaves, and erected under
the shade of several fine bread-fruit trees, was giving an
entertainment to General Dentrecasteaux. She first ordered some
young persons of her attendants to dance; which they did with
infinite gracefulness, singing at the same time, while
Futtafaihe, who was standing, directed their movements, and
animated them by his voice and gestures. (See Plate XXVII.)</p>
<p>After this we had a grand concert, which differed little from
that the King had given us a few days before, only on the present
occasion the expression of joy was much more lively.</p>
<p>The Queen was surrounded by women, while a great number of men
kept at a little distance opposite to her, forming a circle round
the musicians.</p>
<p>When the women had ceased dancing, several men rose up, each
holding in his hand a little club, nearly of the shape of a
paddle. These they brandished about, keeping time with much
precision, and making different movements with their feet. The
musicians, after they had sung some tunes in very slow time, sing
often very quick, which gave this sort of pyrrhic dance a very
animated action, that we admired for a long while. The subject of
this dance excited our curiosity; but we soon found, that its
object was to celebrate the great deeds of some of their
warriors. The women occasionally united their voices with those
of the men, accompanying their song with very graceful
movements.</p>
<p>One of the armourers of the Esperance was much surprized to
see among those dancers, and not far from Futtafaihe, the native
who had stolen his sabre; this chief having always assured us
that he could never find out the thief. It appeared to us,
however, that it was one of his attendants: but he retired with
precipitation as soon as he perceived that he was known.</p>
<p>During this time a pyramid of bamboos had been erected, to
which were suspended different fruits, designed as fa present to
the General from Queen Tin&eacute;.</p>
<p>We expressed a strong desire to see some of the natives engage
in a wrestling match; but we were told that a spectacle of this
sort was never exhibited before the Queen.</p>
<p>This entertainment had attracted a great number of the
natives, among whom were several thieves, whose impudence was
continually increasing. They had already taken several articles
from some or other of us by open force, and run off with them
into the woods.</p>
<p>More than thirty of us were assembled together, and we were
quenching our thirst with the delicious liquor of the cocoa-nuts,
which Tin&eacute; had just presented to the General, when a
native had the audacity to snatch a knife out of one of our
hands. Indignant at such effrontery, several of our party
immediately ran after the thief, and pursued him as far as the
island of Tongataboo; but, finding themselves surrounded by a
great number of the natives, they presently returned toward our
anchoring place. The smith of the Recherche, however, a German by
birth, thought it was proper to show more courage than the rest,
by venturing farther and farther among the natives. These soon
faced about, pursued him in turn, as soon as they found him
inclined to make off, and even attempted to strike him with their
clubs; but he kept them at bay a long time, by presenting to the
most forward a bad pistol, which he several times attempted to
fire. Being now about seven hundred yards only from our ships, he
fancied himself secure from any attempt on their part, when onto
them laid open his skull with a club, and another threw a spear
at his back. A great number of them fell upon him, and continued
their blows till they thought he was dead. One of them tried
repeatedly to shoot him with his own pistol, which they had
seized, but fortunately the priming was gone. They were already
dividing his clothes, when they were observed from the Esperance,
and a cannon was immediately fired, the ball of which passed very
near the assassins, and quickly dispersed them. We ran from all
quarters to the assistance of the unfortunate smith. One of the
crew, having come along the beach to his succour, was attacked by
a native, who knocked out two of his teeth with his club; but the
assault cost him his life, for he was instantly shot dead. Our
smith was soon raised from the ground, and, though his head was
laid open at the left frontal sinus to a considerable extent, and
he had other very dangerous wounds, he had still sufficient
courage to walk to the boat, supported only by the arms.</p>
<p>A few guns loaded with langrage were fired, to protect such of
us as were on shore. The natives fled on all sides, and collected
in very numerous bodies in different parts of the island; and, to
endeavour to disperse them, and to bring off those of our people,
who were still in the interior of the island, a detachment was
sent on shore well armed.</p>
<p>Several chiefs, assembled close by our market with some of us,
were rising to depart; but they yielded to our invitation not to
quit the place.</p>
<p>Presently we saw a launch manned and armed coming from the
Esperance, under the command of Trobriant, her First-Lieutenant.
Knowing very little of the occasion of the alarm, and supposing
that all the natives were preparing to fall upon us, he ordered
his party to seize upon a double canoe, just as she was coming to
the shore, totally ignorant of all that had passed. Most of the
natives in her immediately leaped into the sea; but the chief, to
whom the belonged, remaining on the deck, Trobriant sent one of
the crew to seize him. On his attempting to strike the chief with
a club the chief disarmed him; they laid hold of each other; and,
Trobriant thought proper to fire on the chief, whom he shot dead.
We were all extremely grieved at this misfortune.</p>
<p>Another native, witnessing what passed, leaped from the
canoe's mast-head into the sea, not daring to come down upon deck
and immediately a negro, whom we had taken on board at Amboyna,
pursued him with a pike, which he had in his hand, but
fortunately could not overtake him.</p>
<p>The rage of these barbarians was not yet appeased. A marine,
by birth a German, whom likewise we shipped at Amboyna,
perceiving the daughter of the unfortunate chief, who had
concealed herself in the bottom of the canoe, had already raised
his sabre to run her through, when a gunner belonging to the
Recherche, Citizen Avignon, caught hold of the madman's arm. He
then threw himself between him and the poor girl, whose mother
soon gained the shore, distracted at the death of her husband.
The daughter, too, wept bitterly for the loss of her father, and
we saw her beating herself violently with the fist on the cheeks
and breast.</p>
<p>We detained as hostages the son of the king, and
<i>Titifa</i>, chief of the island of Panga&iuml;motoo; but we
all remarked with sorrow, the dejection into which this
confinement threw the king's son, whom we had often seen issue
his commands with such haughtiness to the subjects of his father.
He frequently repeated that he was our friend, and that he could
with to accompany us to France. Titifa, on the contrary,
expressed not the least fear.</p>
<p>These two chiefs spent the night in the great cabin of the
Recherche. Each had brought with him a wooden pillow, of the
shape of that represented in Plate XXXIII. Fig. 35, on which
after lying down, they laid the back part of their head,
according to the custom of these people, which is no doubt the
cause of the very perceptible flattening observed in that
part.</p>
<p>During the night we saw a greater number of fires on the north
coast of Tongataboo, than we had ever perceived before.</p>
<p>The next morning at day-break we were awakened by the piercing
cries of two women, who were making their lamentations, as they
went round our ship in their canoe. They cried alternately one
after the other, no doubt that their voices might be
distinguished by Titifa; who knew them immediately. These women
were his wife and daughter, who, in their grief, beat their
cheeks and breast with their fists. He immediately ran upon deck,
but could not quiet their alarm, till he had given them an
account of the good treatment he had received on hoard; and when
he told them that he should soon return on shore, they were
transported with joy. A short time after he and King Toobou's son
were both sent ashore in our barge, to the Island of
Panga&iuml;motoo. The wife and daughter of Titifa followed us in
their canoe, when, as they were passing close by the Esperance, a
blunderbuss went off by accident, and hit their canoe, which they
were obliged to quit, as in consequence she presently filled. We
took them into our boat, and expressed our great sorrow at this
mischance; but they soon forgot the danger they had run, for they
were with Titifa, and thought of nothing more but the pleasure of
seeing him set at liberty. We made them a present of a few
articles of hardware, among which a hatchet gave them great
satisfaction. Titifa told us, he should employ this in
constructing another canoe, so that he should soon repair the
loss he had just experienced.</p>
<p>When we landed, most of the natives retired from the shore,
and were proceeding into the interior part of the island; but
Titifa desired them to return, and ordered them to range
themselves in a circle, which they immediately did. Our trade
then recommenced with the greatest order imaginable. This chief
would not quit us the whole time; but Toobou's son disappeared as
soon as he set his foot on shore.</p>
<p>The chief, who had been killed the day before by Trobriant,
appeared to be greatly loved by the natives, for several
displayed much sensibility in lamenting his death.</p>
<p>For fear, they should endeavour to make reprisals on us, the
General ordered every person belonging to our ships, to remain
within the place where the trade was carried on.</p>
<p>Our ships were sufficiently stocked with all such provision as
these people could furnish. As we had now nothing more to
apprehend from the consequences of competition, some articles of
hardware were distributed among the crew, that they might procure
a few things for themselves. On this the natives raised their
demands, for their goods to a very high price, frequently asking
ten times as much as before they had been contented to take.</p>
<p>We saw in their possession an iron hook, which they had had
skill enough to form like those which they fabricate of bone,
tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, and other animal substances, the
figure of which may be seen in Plate XXXII., Fig. 27 and 28. The
line, to which it was fixed, was intended, undoubtedly, to fish
in very deep water, for a pretty large piece of alabaster, cut
into a conical shape, was fastened to it. (See Plate XXXII, Fig.
25 and 26).</p>

<p>Titifa and several other chiefs were not without anxiety, on
account of the hostile intentions of some of the natives toward
us. They imparted to us their apprehensions, and persuaded us to
return on board before the close of the day; their authority, no
doubt, being insufficient to control them.</p>
<p>At night-fall we perceived, that our rudder chains had been
taken away.</p>
<p>7th. We observed on shore several young girls, who had cut
their hair to the length of an inch, except round the head, and
afterwards powdered it with lime, for the purpose, we were told,
of making it grow of a light colour. We saw several others, whose
hair was of this complexion already.</p>
<p>Most of the women did not desist from asking us for glass and
beads, with which they adorned themselves, as soon as they
obtained them. Their request was always accompanied with a
pleasing smile, and at the same time they inclined their head,
laying one of their hands on the breast, in the manner
represented, Plate XXX, Fig. 1.</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE XXX. <i>Woman of the Friendly Islands&mdash;Woman of

<br>
<p>Titifa brought us some nutmegs, which were tolerably round,
and as large again as those of the cultivated nutmeg, but they
were destitute of aromatic flavour. The mace was covered with a
pretty thick down. The natives, observing we received these with
pleasure, quickly brought us more.</p>
<p>These people have invented a kind of flute, differing from
that called in Europe Pan's reed only in the proportion of the
tones. All the pipes gave full notes, and of little extent; and
the highest is a fourth to the lowest. We purchased several of
these flutes.</p>
<p>I obtained of our Commander a large box, to hold some young
bread-fruit plants, for the purpose of enriching our colonies
with that useful vegetable; and it was placed upon the larboard
quarter gallery. Some of the natives procured me a great number
of suckers, and I planted them in very good mould, which they
brought me, and which they called <i>kel&eacute; kel&eacute;</i>.
I also took some roots and cuttings of this valuable tree, which
I buried in loam, <i>oummea</i> in their language, placing them
horizontally. These cuttings were so many shoots, which I
intended to plant on our arrival at the Isle of France.</p>
<p>8th. Queen Tin&eacute; came on board, just as Feenou was in
the cabin with the General, to whom he had brought as a present a
diadem, made with the beautiful red feathers of the tropic-bird,
with some other very small feathers of a brilliant red colour.
When he went out of the cabin, to return ashore, he endeavoured
to avoid the sight of the queen; but the moment the perceived
him, she made him come to her, and held out to him her right
foot, which he took hold of immediately, and placed on the hind
part of his head, making a profound bow, in testimony of the
respect he owed the queen. He dared not refuse her these honours,
though it appeared to us, that he was deeply affected by it. The
General had just made him a present of several iron-tools, and we
observed with pleasure, that he appeared to know the value of
this metal, giving it a very decided preference to the bones and
volcanic stones, of which most of the hatchets of these islanders
are made.</p>
<p>We were afterwards visited by different chiefs, who repeated
to us, what several others had already informed us, respecting
the reigning family. They employed for the purpose playing cards,
with which we furnished them. These they first spread on the
table, and then they assigned to each the name of one of the
persons of the family; which did not appear to us to bear one
common surname, as Captain Cook imagined (that of Futtafaihe, at
present the name of the son of Poulaho); for Poulaho's father was
named <i>Taibouloutou</i>. Taibouloutou married a wife, whose
name was <i>Toobouhou</i>, by whom he had four children; two
sons, <i>Poulaho</i>, who succeeded him, and Futtafaihe; and two
daughters, the one named <i>Tin&eacute;</i>, the other
<i>Nanatchi</i>. When <i>Poulaho</i> died, he left a son very
young, named <i>Futtafaihe</i>, whose uncle then took into his
hands the reins of government; but he did not long survive his
brother, and then the sovereignty devolved upon
<i>Tin&eacute;</i>, the elder sister. She held all the honours of
it, without exercising the authority, however; with which it
appears a female cannot be invested; the power, therefore, passed
into the hand of a chief named <i>Toobou</i>, brother to
<i>Tin&eacute;'s</i> mother. This queen had married <i>Ovea</i>,
one of the chiefs of Tosoa; and he had divorced her, after having
had two sons by her, <i>Vea&iuml;cou</i>, and <i>Veatchi</i>.</p>
<p>Thus it appears, that the succession to the throne devolves
first on the brothers, then on the sisters, of the prince who has
reigned, before it comes to his sons; and when a woman succeeds
to the royal title, the sovereign authority is exercised by one
of her mother's nearer relations, though only during the life of
the queen. The family of Toobou will retain the power during the
reign of <i>Tin&eacute;</i>; and Futtafaihe, the son of
<i>Poulaho</i>, will not ascend the throne, till after the death
of both his aunts. The royal family, at this time divested of the
sovereign power, nevertheless enjoyed the regal honours, and even
received the homage of those, by whom the authority was
exercised, as we observed on several occasions.</p>
<p><i>Vouac&eacute;c&eacute;</i>, one of the chiefs of Feejee,
had arrived at Tongataboo, soon after we anchored there. We were
frequently visited by him, and he affirmed to us, what he had
said several times, that it would take him three days sailing, in
his double canoe, with a south-east wind, to reach Feejee, the
situation of which he pointed out to the north-west. Hence we
reckoned, that this island, which is very lofty, and of the
fertility of which he boasted, much, was about a hundred and
fifty leagues from Tongataboo. This is an immense voyage for
people, who, having no instruments, steer only by observing the
sun and stars with the naked eye, as soon as they are out of
sight of land; but it is still more difficult to conceive, how
they can reach Tongataboo from such a distance, when they have to
work up against the south-east winds; and they must be very sure
of their marks in the heavens, not to miss the land, after being
obliged to ply to windward, as they are sometimes, for more than
a month.</p>
<p>The people of Tongataboo informed us, that the natives of the
Feejee Islands were cannibals but Vouac&eacute;c&eacute;
endeavoured to exculpate himself from this accusation, by
assuring us, that the lower class of people only, the
<i>touas</i>, ate human flesh. It appeared to us, however, from
what we learned on other occasions, that the chiefs ate it
likewise; indeed, as these people eat their enemies only, and
commit this savage act solely to glut their rage, it may be
presumed the people of Tongataboo did not impose upon us when
they assured us that the Feejee chiefs themselves were
cannibals.</p>
<p>Unquestionably the reader will be astonished to hear, that,
notwithstanding this mark of ferociousness, the arts are much
farther advanced at Feejee than at the Friendly. Islands; the
inhabitants of which never sailed to inform us that the finer
articles they sold us came from Feejee, being careful to give us
to understand that they were very decidedly superior to those
which they fabricated themselves.</p>
<p>Vouac&eacute;c&eacute; displayed much greater desire of
acquiring knowledge than any native of the Friendly Islands, most
of whom visited us solely from motives of interest, and examined
all parts of our ship with the greatest attention. He was very
well made, and his physiognomy was strikingly expressive of
character (see Plate XXIX. Fig. 2). His hair, on the fore-part of
the head, was ornamented with red powder.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image19" id="Image19"></a><img alt=""
src="1204001h-images/Image19.jpg"><br>
<br>
<b>PLATE XXIX. <i>Toobou, Son of the King of the Friendly Islands
&mdash;Vouac&eacute;c&eacute;, Native of Feejee</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>The natives of Feejee are frequently at war with those of
Tongataboo; but, as soon as hostilities are at an end, a great
trade is carried on between them.</p>
<p>The General received as a present from Futtafaihe a little
canoe with an out-rigger, which was immediately stowed near the
main-chains. It was near ten feet long, a foot wide, and capable
of carrying only two persons. These canoes are decked for about a
fifth part of their length at each end, which is sufficient for
them to navigate with security within the reefs; but their double
canoes, being intended for the open sea, are decked throughout
their whole length, except toward the middle, where a little
opening is left for a man to go down and bale out the water when
it is necessary.</p>
<p>I saw with admiration that these people had consulted nature
in constructing their canoes for speed. The bottom nearly
resembles the under part of a fish of the cetaceous kind, which
swims with the greatest swiftness, darting along by bounds on the
surface of the water, the <i>delphinus delphis</i>, the
dolphin.</p>
<p>9th. King Toobou having heard that we were soon to quit the
island, came to intreat us to postpone our departure, and
appeared extremely sorry when he found us determined to go.</p>
<p>The natives imagined, no doubt, that we wished to lay in a
great stock of bread-fruit, for they brought much more than usual
to our market but this fruit would not keep long without rotting,
unless we had cut it into slices and dried it, or fermented it,
as the natives do, much in the same manner as is done in Europe
with several species of culinary vegetables. Ever since we had
been at anchor we had sufficient for our daily consumption; and
we ate it with pleasure, relinquishing for it without regret our
biscuit, and even the small allowance of fresh bread, which was
usually served out to us every day, though this was of a very
good quality. We preferred the bread-fruit to yams; but the
natives, who came to dine with us, seemed to eat them almost
indiscriminately. Our cook commonly boiled it for us; yet it
would have tasted much better had he taken the trouble to bake it
in the oven.</p>
<p>This fruit is nearly of an oval shape, about a foot long, and
eight inches thick. The whole is eatable, except a very thin
rind, with which it is covered, and a small portion at the
centre, where the cells terminate. These contain no seeds, but
are full of a very nutritious pulp, easy of digestion,
sufficiently agreeable to the taste, and which we always ate with
fresh pleasure.</p>
<p>During eight months of the year this tree produces its fruits,
which, ripening one after another, thus afford the natives an
abundance of wholesome food, I shall not describe it here, as
this has been done already by skilful botanists. The want of
seeds, no doubt, arises from propagating the tree by suckers and
in this respect it differs remarkably from the wild species, the
fruit of which is much smaller, not very numerous, and full of
large kernels, which are difficult of digestion.</p>
<p>The natives brought us a few bits of yellow sanders, and to
render its smell more powerful, they took care to rub it strongly
with a rasp made of the skin of the ray, such as is represented
in Plate XXXII. Fig. 24. They told us, that they procured it from
the Feejee Islands, whence they call it <i>ha&iuml;-feejee</i>:
and they said that they had frequently endeavoured to transplant
some of the trees to their own island, but they could not
succeed.</p>
<p>The canoes round our ship left us when night was coming on,
returning to the nearer part of the shore, as was customary; and
our men were still very merry, when the young women, who had
found means to get between decks, gave them notice of their
departure, saying to them aloud, <i>bongui bongui, mitzi
mitzi</i>. These words I shall not attempt to translate; but from
the vocabulary of the language of these people, given toward the
end of the present work, it may be seen, that the girls were not
ashamed to publish what had passed between them and the crew, at
the same time that they promised them to come again the next
day.</p>
<p>Early the next morning several chiefs came to see us, and
announced to the natives, who were already assembled round our
vessel in their canoes, that we were on the point of quitting
their island; when we were much surprised to see a number of
young women immediately falling into tears, and uttering piercing
cries. No doubt their sorrow was very acute, but it was of short
duration; for soon after we saw them merry enough with their
companions.</p>
<p>Futtafaihe requested us to sharpen for him a couple of
hatchets, which had been given him by Captain Cook, and which he
had had reforged on board the Esperance. This chief was
accompanied by his wife, who amused herself a long while by
playing with a sort of cup and ball, invented by these islanders.
This toy consisted of a ball of wood, which the threw up into the
air, and then endeavoured to let fall through a very small
semicircle of shell, to which the ball was fastened by means of a
long string. We were admiring her address, when Futtafaihe,
seized with a fit of jealousy at seeing in her hands some
presents which she had just received from one of our officers,
began to abuse her; and though his suspicions were without
foundation, they had a great deal of difficulty to persuade him
of his mistake. This chief was with his father-in-law, We made
them some presents just as the son of king Toobou arrived, and
they immediately hid them in their girdles; but Toobou perceived
it, and we had soon a fresh proof that if the royal family
enjoyed the honours of sovereignty, the family of Toobou reaped
all its profits. Toobou searched the girdles of the two chiefs,
and seized every thing they had just received. Futtafaihe had no
other means of revenge but by preventing his eating in his
presence, not suffering him to sit by his side, and placing his
foot on his head; accordingly he presented his foot to him soon
after, and Toobou paid him the homage due to a person of superior
rank.</p>
<p>We had many times seen the chiefs openly taking to themselves
things that belonged to people of the lower class; and we always
remarked with surprise that this species of oppression by no
means diminished the unalterable gaiety of their dispositions.
When they were assembled together, you would hear them every
moment burst out into great peals of laughter. Their government
appeared to us, as it did to Captain Cook, to have a considerable
affinity to the feudal system.</p>
<p>Several natives requested to embark with us, in order to
accompany us to France; and Captain Huon allotted a birth on
board the Esperance to <i>Kov&eacute;</i>, a son of the queen.
This chief, to convince us that he was prompted only by the wish
to accompany us, would not accept any of the articles we offered
him. The General, whom he came to see, set before him the
principal inconveniencies attendant on long voyages; yet he
persisted in his resolution, and returned on board the Esperance.
Just as he was sitting down to dinner, however, several natives
came to intreat him to go on shore to see his family at least
once more, before he undertook a voyage of such a length. He
complied with their intreaties, and never returned on board
again. Some of the natives informed us, that he was unable to
resist the prayers and tears of nine wives and several children,
whom he was going to leave, perhaps never to see more; and that
he had promised not to quit them. Kov&eacute; had a fine
countenance, but not the gaiety of the other natives. Perhaps
some domestic uneasiness had been one of the chief causes of his
desire to leave his country. Had he carried his design into
execution, he would many times have regretted the delicious
fruits of his native isle, when reduced, like us, to feed on
worm-eaten biscuit.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the night we fired off ten or a dozen
muskets, and immediately we heard the shouts of a great number of
the natives, which were repeated from different places along the
shore.</p>
<p>Our stay at the Friendly Islands contributed greatly to
restore the health of our crew. We found there plenty of
vegetables, and laid in a great stock. The pork was excellent,
which must be attributed in part to the good quality of the roots
and fruits with which the natives feed their hogs. We took on
board as many as our stye would contain; and we were convinced,
in the sequel, that they could bear a long voyage, though Captain
Cook informs us that he experienced the contrary with respect to
those which he procured at the Friendly Islands in the different
visits he paid them. We purchased upwards of four hundred while
we lay at anchor, the greater part of which we salted. We adopted
the process recommended by Cook in his third voyage, which
consists in using a strong brine, with a sufficient quantity of
vinegar to dissolve the salt. This we could do the more easily,
as a great part of our wine was turned sour.</p>
<p>A small quantity of pork was salted by our butcher with salt
alone; and though under the Torrid Zone, it kept as well as what
we prepared after Cook's manner, and tasted even better. The fat
preserved in the brine made with vinegar was disgusting on
account of its extreme softness, and it had a very strong taste
of the vinegar, which no one liked.</p>
<p>Our coops were filled with fowls.</p>
<p>During the whole time of our lying at anchor, the quicksilver
in the barometer did not rise above 28 inches two lines, French
measure, and its variation was about one line.</p>
<p>The thermometer in the shade on shore had not risen higher
than 25&deg; 4-10ths, though we felt excessive heat.</p>
<p>The winds had varied from the south-east to the north-east,
blowing but faintly.</p>
<p>Our observatory was in 21&deg; 8' 19" S. lat., and 180&deg;
29' 38" E. long.</p>
<p>The variation of the needle was 10&deg; E.</p>
<p>The spring-tides rose five feet; and it was high water about
half after six on the days of new and full moon.</p>
<p>From the accounts given us of the ships that had anchored in
this archipelago, by very intelligent natives, we were convinced
that La P&eacute;rouse had never put in to any of these islands.
Besides, they assured us, that no accident had happened to any
vessel that had stopped at them, except to Bligh's launch; the
affair of which they related without disguise, as I have
mentioned above. The indifference with which they told us this
story, convinced us, that if these people be not naturally
ferocious, they are at least strangers to sentiments of humanity.
The blows with clubs, or logs of wood, with which the chiefs
usually accompany their orders, are an additional proof of this.
They well remembered the different periods at which they had seen
Captain Cook; and, to acquaint us with the intervals, they
reckoned them by harvests of yams; giving two of these to each
year. Several of the natives, particularly those of the royal
family, pronounced the name of Cook with enthusiasm; but the
great severity of that celebrated navigator had prevented many
others from bearing him in memory with equal pleasure; they spoke
of him only with complaints of the rigorous treatment they had
experienced at his hands. In fact, though in his last voyage he
speaks only of one man wounded by a ball in the thigh, we saw
another who had been shot through the shoulder;* and he assured
us that he had received this wound during Cook's last visit to
Tongataboo.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In the account of Cook's last voyage, now
before me, it is expressly said, that the man was shot through
the shoulder, the ball having entered a little above; the inner
part of the collar bone, and passed out obliquely backward. How
Labillardiere was led into this mistake, I cannot
say.&mdash;<i>Translator</i>.]</p>
<p>The natives of the Friendly Islands are in general tall and
well made; for which they are principally indebted, no doubt, to
the abundance and good quality of their food. The fine shape of
these people is not degraded by excessive toil. Their muscles
being strongly marked, we presumed, they must have great
strength; but the idle life they lead renders them very little
capable of great exertion, accordingly, when they tried their
strength against our sailors, they were almost always
worsted.</p>
<p>The men, as well as the women, are accustomed to cut off one
or two joints of the little finger, and sometimes of the finger
next to it, in the hope of obtaining a cure from severe
diseases.</p>
<p>Most of them are tatooed on all parts of the body. We saw a
great number, whose akin was covered with a scurfy eruption;
which perhaps is owing to their not being accustomed to wipe
themselves, or wash themselves with fresh water, after having
been into the sea.</p>
<p>We observed no symptoms of the venereal disease among the
natives; one of our seamen, however, caught a gonorrhoea there,
but from a woman, who had kept company with a man belonging to
the Esperance, that had long laboured under the complaint. Have
these people been fortunate enough, for the disease to have
become naturally extinct among them; after having run through its
several stages with rapidity ? since, from the testimony of
Captain Cook, there can be no doubt but it has formerly made
great ravages in these islands.</p>
<p>The skin of the people of the Friendly Islands is tawny,
because they frequently expose themselves o the heat of the sun;
but the women, who remain pretty constantly within doors, or in
the shade of their trees, have very fair complexions. The
countenances of the women are in general very pleasing, and
highly animated; and the good state of health they enjoy is
particularly owing to their extreme cleanliness, and the good
quality of their diet.</p>

<br>
<small>10th APRIL.</small></p>
<p>ABOUT seven in the morning we got under way, with a pretty
fresh breeze from the east-south-east, and steered for an hour
from north-west by south to north, and afterward north by east,
passing out through a channel toward the north of our anchoring
place, which had been examined by Citizen Legrand.</p>
<p>In this channel we found by the lead from five fathoms and a
half to nine fathoms water.</p>
<p>Some of the natives followed us in their canoes, expressing
great regret at our quitting their island. They cried out from
all parts, <i>offa, offa Palan&ccedil;ois</i>, at the same time
giving us marks of their regard.</p>
<p>We soon got ahead of the canoes that were paddled along; but
those with sails were obliged to slacken their rate of going, to
keep at a short distance from us; and we had an opportunity of
observing, that they would have taken the lead of our vessels
considerably, is they had availed themselves of the whole force
of the breeze this advantage, however, they could soon have lost,
if the wind had been stronger, and the water less smooth. As soon
as we got into the open sea, they desisted from keeping us
company any farther. We were then more than two leagues from the
anchoring place we had just quitted, and we set the west end of
Attata, bearing south 48&deg; west.</p>
<p>At this time we had a gravelly bottom, with twenty-two fathoms
and a half of water.</p>
<p>11th. The next day, about five in the afternoon, we made
Tortoise Island, bearing froth us north-west by north.</p>
<p>On the 16th, about seven o'clock in the evening, the Esperance
made a signal for seeing land west 18&deg; north, about eight
leagues distance. This was Erronan, the easternmost of the
islands of the archipelago of Espiritu Santo, discovered by
Quiros in 1606. A little before noon the island of Annaton was in
sight, distant ten leagues, south west by south.</p>
<p>It was five in the afternoon when we made the island of Tanna,
bearing west 16&deg; north. Pillars of smoke issued from its
volcano, and spread abroad in the air, forming clouds, which rose
at first to a prodigious height, and which, after having
traversed an immense space, sunk lower as they grew cooler.
During the night we enjoyed the brilliant spectacle of these
clouds, illumined by the vivid light of the burning matter, which
was thrown out from the bowels of the volcano at intervals.</p>
<p>18th. We were steering westerly, the wind blowing very fresh
from the east, when, about half after three in the morning,
Dum&eacute;rite, the officer on the watch, heard the screams of a
flock of sea-fowl passing very close by our ship: apprehensive,
that we were near some of the rocks, which commonly serve them as
a retreat, he thought it advisable to bring to, and wait for
day-light to continue our course; and as soon as day broke; we
saw a very little way to leeward of us some reefs of rocks
stretching a great way; on which our ship must inevitably have
struck, if this fortuitous occurrence had not given us notice to
stop our course in time. In fact, as the night was extremely
dark, it would have been impossible to have seen the breakers
soon enough to avoid them; besides, the wind blowing very fresh,
the sea ran so high all round us, that we could not soon enough
have distinguished the waves that broke on the reefs from the
refs. Beyond these reefs, and near two leagues distant from them,
we saw an island, which bore, when we made it, south 28&deg;
west, and to which I gave the name of Citizen Beaupr&eacute;,
engineer-geographer to our expedition. This island lies in the
latitude of 20&deg; 14' south, longitude 163&deg; 47' east. It is
very low, and about 1500 toises long. We afterwards discovered
some rocks bearing south 21&deg; east; and a little while after
some others towards the south.</p>
<p>It is to be remarked, that the currents let us to the north
about twenty-four minutes a day, when we were near Tierra del
Espiritu Santo, and passing between that archipelago and New
Caledonia. Undoubtedly this is owing to the position of the land,
which, while it changes the direction of the currents determined
by the general winds, increases their strength.</p>
<p>About one o'clock in the afternoon we got sight of the high
mountains of New Caledonia to the south-west; and at half-after
four we were within a thousand toises of the reefs bordering that
island. The foot of the mountains on this side are washed by the
sea, and they are likewise more steep here than on the western
shore, which we coasted along the year before.</p>
<p>We saw a fine cascade, the water of which, after having
disappeared several, times in deep gullies, came tumbling into
the seat, and we admired the picturesque effect of the torrents,
which we perceived toward the south-west, their waters white with
foam producing an agreeable contrast to the dusky verdure of
these high lands.</p>
<p>During the night we continued plying to windward, endeavouring
to maintain our station against the currents; that we might be in
a situation to come to an anchor the next day.</p>
<p>19th. As soon as day-light appeared we approached within 800
toises of the reefs, along which we ran, in order to find the
opening through which we were to reach the anchoring place; but
it blew very hard from the south-south-east, and we had already
fallen to leeward, when we. distinguished the opening in the
reefs. Though we were pretty near the shore, we did not perceive
Observatory Island, which left us for some time doubtful whether
we were opposite the place where Captain Cook anchored in 1774;
and accordingly we put about, to get more to the the north-east.
At noon we found by our observations, that we must be near
Observatory Island, and it was not long before we got sight of
it, though it is extremely low; when we immediately bore away for
the anchoring place. In the opening between the reefs we had from
eleven fathom water to thirteen and a half, but when we got
within them we had only from seven fathoms to eight and a
half.</p>
<p>A double canoe immediately came sailing out to us. She had on
board eleven natives, whose manoeuvres gave us no very high idea
of their skill in navigation. They spoke to us, and showed us
some pieces of white stuff, which they waved in the air, still
keeping more than a hundred toises from the ship. A short time
after they returned on shore.</p>
<p>The Esperance, being a little to windward of us, grounded on a
shoal which we in consequence took care to avoid, and presently
after let go our anchor, in order to lend her assistance. General
Dentrecasteaux immediately sent our long-boat to her, and at
eight o'clock in the evening we had the agreeable news that the
was again afloat, and had received no damage.</p>
<p>20th. At sun-rise the next morning we saw four canoes under
sail, coming towards our ships. When they got very near us, they
seemed to be under some fears; but one of the savages, having
yielded to our invitations, and come on board, was followed by
almost all the rest. We were surprized, to find them set more
value on our stuffs than on our nails, or even hatchets, which
they called <i>togui</i>; a name much resembling that given them
at the Friendly Islands, though they do not speak the same
tongue, as maybe seen by the vocabularies of the languages of
these people, at the end of the present work. We could not doubt,
however, but they were acquainted with iron, which they
designated to us by the denomination of <i>pitiou</i>; but the
very hard stones which they use, renders it of less importance to
them, than to many other inhabitants of the South Sea
Islands.</p>
<p>We showed them some cocoas and yams, and requested them to
bring us some; but, far from going to fetch any for us, they
wanted to buy ours, offering us in exchange their spears and
clubs, and giving us to understand that they were very hungry,
putting their hands to their bellies, which were extremely flat.
They expressed some fear on seeing the pigs which we had on
board, which led us to suppose that they had no such animal;
though Captain Cook had left two, a boar and sow, with one of
their chiefs. As soon as they saw our poultry, however, they
imitated the crowing of the cock tolerably well, so as to leave
us no doubt that they had fowls on their island.</p>
<p>None of the women in the canoes contented to come on board our
vessel; and when we were desirous of making them a present of any
thing, the men took it to carry to them.</p>

<br>
<b>XLV. <i>Double Canoe of New Caledonia</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>These savages came in double canoes of the shape represented
in Plate XLV. Fig. 1. Their mast was fixed at an equal distance
from the two canoes, and toward the fore part of the platform, by
which they were joined together. They are not so skilfully
constructed as those of the Friendly Islands, to which they are
much inferior in point of sailing. One of them, running against
our ship with too much force, received so much damage, that the
canoe on one side soon filled. The savages in her immediately got
upon the other, and let themselves go with the current, which
drifted them toward the shore. The other canoes left us presently
after, and sailed after her, in order to give her assistance.</p>
<p>21st. Early in the morning we manned the capstan, in order to
warp our ship nearer to Observatory Island; for which purpose we
had carried out several hawsers tied end to end; but they gave
way several times, and obliged us to let go the anchor again.</p>
<p>We were surrounded by canoes, the natives in which came on
board our ship, and sold us several articles, such as are
delineated in Plates XXXVII and XXXVIII. Some of them had a few
cocoa-nuts and sugar-canes, which they would not part with by any
means, though we offered a great price for them.</p>

<br>
<p>These savages were all naked, except that they wrapped their
privities in pieces of coarse stuff, made of bark, or in large
leaves of trees. Their hair is woolly; and their skin is nearly
of as deep a black as that of the inhabitants of Diemen's Cape,
whom they very much resemble in the general cast of their
countenance. Several of them had their heads bound round with a
little net, the meshes of which were large. We observed with
surprize, a great many, who, desirous, no doubt, of having the
appearance of long hair, had fastened to their own locks two or
three tresses, made with the leaves of some plants of the grass
kind, and covered with the hair of the vampire bat, which hung
down to the middle of their backs.</p>
<p>Most of these islanders, armed with spears and clubs, carried
at, their waist a little bag full of stones, cut into an oval
shape, which they throw with slings. (See Plates XXXV and
XXXVIII. Fig. 16, 17, and 18.) The lower lobe of their cars,
perforated with a very large hole, hung down to their shoulders.
Into these holes some had introduced leaves of trees, others a
piece of wood, to stretch them bigger. Several had this lobe
jagged perhaps from having been torn, either in battle, or in
running through the woods.</p>
<p>[MISSING: PLATE XXXV. Native of New Caledonia throwing a
Javelin]</p>
<p>Behind the ears of one of these savages we observed tubercles
of the shape of a veal sweetbread, and half as big as a man's
fist. He appeared well pleased at seeing us examine this
ornament, the growth of which he had effected by means of a
caustic, by which the parts, no doubt, must have been greatly
irritated for a considerable time.</p>
<p>The women had no other garment than a kind of fringe, made of
the filaments of the bark of trees, which served them as a
girdle, passing several times round the waist. (See Plate
XXXVI).</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE XXXVI. <i>A Woman of New Caledonia</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>The canoes kept themselves close by our ship, by means of
different ropes, which we had thrown out to them. Each of them,
however, had a large stone, to serve as an anchor, fastened to a
long rope, but they did not make use of these on the present
occasion.</p>
<p>22d. The next day we got up our anchor at six o'clock in the
morning, and made several stretches to get nearer to Observatory
Island, which the natives call by the name of <i>Pudyoua</i>. At
half after ten, when we brought up, this island was not above 500
toises distant to the east 3&deg; 15' south. We saw the land of
New Caledonia from east 19&deg; 30' south, to west 12&deg; north,
from the nearest shore of which we were only 590 toises. The
inhabitants now had no occasion for their canoes to come to us;
most of them swam to the ship, with the articles which they
wished to sell.</p>
<p>I ought not here to omit a malicious trick, which had nearly
caused the loss of the young bread-fruit trees, that I had
brought from the Friendly Islands. I had watered them in the
evening; but, seeing some drops of water early in the morning
trickle from the box in which they were planted. I had no doubt,
but some one had watered them long after me. Of this I was fully
convinced, the moment I tasted the water, that filtered through
the mould; for it was salt. The inquiries I made to discover the
person who had been guilty of this trick, were in vain.</p>
<p>About one in the afternoon we went ashore, and were soon
surrounded by a great number of the natives, who just came out of
the middle of the wood, into which we had entered several times,
though still keeping near the shore. We presently found a few
scattered huts, three or four hundred paces distant from each
other, and overshadowed by a few cocoa trees. Soon after we came
to four, which, formed a little hamlet, in one of the gloomiest
parts of the forest. They were all nearly of the shape of
beehives, a toise and a half in height, and as much in breadth.
(See Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 28, 29, 30).</p>
<p>Figure 28 represents one of these huts, surrounded by a
palisade a yard and a half high, made with the limbs of the cocoa
tree, arranged pretty close to each other, and three feet and
half from the borders of the hut. A. little walk was formed, in
the same manner before the door.</p>
<p>We afterwards saw several huts which were not surrounded by
palisades (See Fig. 29). The door, which was about a yard high,
and half a yard wide, was sometimes closed by means of a piece of
a limb of the cocoa tree, the folioles of which were interlaced.
Several of these doors had two posts, made of planks, at the
upper extremity of each of which a man's head was rudely carved.
The lower part of these huts was erected perpendicularly to the
height of a yard, where they tapered off in a pretty regular
cone, terminated by the upper end of a post that was fixed in the
centre of the floor.</p>
<p>Figure 30 represents the inside of these huts. The frame
consists of poles, bearing against the upper end of the post,
which may be seen rising from the middle of the floor, and which
is near three inches in diameter at the bottom. A few pieces of
wood bent to an arch, render these little habitations
sufficiently strong. They are covered with straw to the thickness
of two or three inches. The floor, on which the natives are
perfectly sheltered from the weather, is spread with mats. But
the moschettoes are so troublesome, that they are obliged to
light fires to drive them away when they go to deep; and as there
is no vent for the smoke, except at the door, they must be
extremely incommoded, by it.</p>
<p>In general there is a board within the hut on one side,
fastened with cords in a horizontal position, about a yard from
the ground. This shelf however, can support nothing of much
weight, for the cords are very slight.</p>
<p>Near some of their dwellings we saw little hillocks of earth,
twelve or fourteen inches high, with, a very open trellis in the
middle, of the height of two or three yards. The savages called
these <i>nbouet</i>, and informed us that they were graves;
inclining the head on one side, while they supported it with the
hand, and closing the eyes, to express the repose enjoyed by the
remains of those who were there deposited.</p>
<p>On returning toward the place where we landed, we found more
than seven hundred natives, who had run thither from all parts.
They asked us for stuffs and iron in exchange for their effects,
and some of them soon convinced us that they were very audacious
thieves. Among their different tricks I shall relate one which
these knaves played me. One of them offered to sell me a little
bag, which held stones cut into an oval shape, and which was
fastened to his waist. He untied it, and held it out as if ready
to deliver it to me with one hand, while he received the price
agreed upon with the other; but at the very instant another
savage, who hast posted himself behind me, gave a great scream,
which made me turn my head round, and immediately the rogue his
comrade ran away with his bag and my things, endeavouring to
conceal himself in the crowd. We were unwilling to punish him,
though most of us were armed with firelocks. It was to be feared,
however, that this aft of forbearance would be considered as a
mark of weakness by the natives, and render them still more
insolent. What happened soon after seemed to confirm this;
several of them were so bold as to throw stones at an officer,
who was not above two hundred paces from us. We would not yet
treat them with severity; for we were so much prejudiced in their
favour, from the account given of them by Forster, that more
facts were necessary to destroy the good opinion we entertained
of the gentleness of their dispositions; but we had soon
incontestable proofs of their ferociousness. One of them having
in his hand a bone fresh roasted, and devouring the remainder of
the flesh still adhering to it, came up to Citizen Piron, and
invited him to share his repast. He, supposing the savage was
offering him a piece of some quadruped, accepted the bone, on
which nothing but the tendinous parts were left; and, having
shown, it to me, I perceived that it belonged to the pelvis of a
child of fourteen or fifteen years of age. The natives around us,
pointed out on a child the situation of this bone; confessed,
without hesitation, that the flesh of it had furnished some one
of their countrymen with a meal; and even gave us to understand,
that they considered it as a dainty.</p>
<p>This discovery made us very uneasy for those of our people,
who were still in the woods; shortly after, however, we had the
pleasure to find ourselves all assembled together in the same
spot, and no longer feared that some of us would fall victims to
the barbarity of these islanders.</p>
<p>When we got on board our ship, being surprised at seeing none
of the savages there, we were formed that there had been a great
many, but that they had been driven away because they had stolen
several things. Most of them had made off in their canoes; and
the rest had jumped into the sea and swam ashore; two, however,
were returned on board, not being able to swim fast enough to
join the others, whether owing to some bodily infirmity, or to
their having leaped into the sea too long after the departure of
their boats to be able to take refuge in them. As, the sun was
already set, and they were cold, they went to warm themselves at
the fire in our cook-room.</p>
<p>The most part of those who belonged to our expedition, and who
had remained on board, would not give credit to our recital of
the barbarous taste of those islanders, not being able to
persuade themselves that people, of whom Captains Cook and
Forster had given so favourable an account, could degrade
themselves by such a horrible practice; but it was not very
difficult to convince the most incredulous. I had brought with me
a bone which had already been picked, and which our Surgeon-Major
said was the bone, of a child. I presented it to the two natives
whom we had on board. One of those cannibals immediately seized
it with avidity, and tore with his teeth the sinews and ligaments
which yet remained. I gave it next to his companion, who found
something more to pick from it.</p>
<p>The different signs which our people made, in order to obtain
an avowal of the practice of eating human flesh, being aukwardly
made, occasioned a very great mistake. An excessive consternation
was instantly visible in all their features; doubtless because
they thought that we also were men-eaters, and, imagining that
their last hour was come, they began to weep. We did not succeed
in convincing them entirely of their mistake, by all the signs we
could make of our abhorrence of so terrible a practice. One of
them made a precipitate retreat through a port-hole, and held
fast by one of the ropes of the mizen mast shrouds, ready to leap
into the sea; the other jumped into the water at once, and swam
to the most distant of the boats astern of our vessel; they were
not long, however, before they recovered from their fear, and
rejoined our company.</p>
<p>The small stream, where Captain Cook had taken in water when
he touched at this place, was dry when we visited it; we found,
however, a small watering place to the south-west of our vessel,
about three hundred paces distant from the sea; the water was
very good, but it was rather difficult to be come at, and the
reservoir which furnished it scarcely supplied enough to fill
once in a day casks sufficient to load the long-boat of each
ship, so that it was necessary to wait till next day till more
was collected to replenish them.</p>
<p>We found very near this watering place the rusty bottom of an
iron candlestick, which probably had lain there ever since 1774,
when Captain Cook anchored in this road.</p>
<p>23d. The next morning we went on shore at the nearest landing
place, where we found a number of savages who were already taking
some refreshment. They invited us to join them in eating some
meat just broiled, which we distinguished to be human flesh. The
skin which yet remained, preserved its form, and even its colour
on several parts. They shewed us they had just cut that piece
from the middle of the arm, and they gave us to understand, by
very expressive signs, that after having pierced with their darts
the person of whose limbs we saw the remnants in their hands,
they had dispatched him with their clubs. They no doubt winced to
make us sensible that they only eat their enemies, and indeed it
was not possible that we should have found so many inhabitants in
this country, if they had had any other inducement but that of
hunger to make them devour each other. We went to the
south-south-west, and soon crossed a country which lies rather
low, where we saw some plantations of yams and potatoes; we then
came to the foot of some mountains, where we found ten of the
inhabitants who joined our company. They soon began to climb up
trees of the species called <i>hibiscus tiliaceus</i>, the
younger sprouts of which they pulled off and immediately chewed,
in order to suck the juice contained in the bark. Others gathered
the fruit of the <i>cordia sebestina</i>, which they eat even to
the kernel. We did not expect to see cannibals content themselves
with so frugal a repast.</p>
<p>The heat was excessive, and we had not yet found any water. We
followed a hollow track, in which we remarked the traces of a
torrent of water in the wet season. The verdure of the underwood,
which we perceived a little farther off on its borders, gave us
hopes of finding a spring to quench our thirst; in fact we were
no sooner arrived than we saw a very limpid stream issuing from
an enormous rock of freestone, and afterwards filling a large
cavity, hollowed out in a block of the same sort of stone. Here
we halted, and the natives, who accompanied us, sat down by us.
We gave them biscuits, which they devoured with avidity, though
they were very much worm-eaten, but they would not even taste our
cheese, and we had nothing eatable besides to offer them.</p>
<p>They preferred the water of the reservoir to wine or brandy,
and drank in a manner which afforded us no small entertainment,
inclining the head at about two feet distance above the surface
of the water, they threw it up against their faces with their
hands, opening their mouths very wide, and catching as much as
they could; thus they soon quenched their thirst. It may easily
be conceived, that even the most expert at this method of
drinking must wet the greatest part of their bodies. As they
disturbed our water, we begged them to go lower down to drink,
which request they immediately complied with.</p>
<p>Some of them approached the most robust amongst us, and, at
different intervals, pressed with their fingers the most muscular
parts of their arms and legs, pronouncing <i>rapareck</i> with an
air of admiration, and even of longing, which rather alarmed us,
but upon the whole they gave us no cause for dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>I observed in these places a number of plants belonging to the
same genera with many of those I had collected in New Holland,
although the two countries are at very great distance from each
other.</p>
<p>We saw with surprize, about a third part of the ascent up the
mountain, small walls raised one above another, to prevent the
rolling down of the ground which the natives cultivated. I have
found the same practice extremely general amongst the inhabitants
of the mountains of Asia Minor.</p>
<p>It is not a common practice amongst the savages of New
Caledonia to make an incision in the prepuce; nevertheless, out
of six of them, whom we persuaded to satisfy our curiosity in
that respect, we found one who had it slit in a longitudinal
direction on the upper side.</p>
<p>When we had reached the middle of the mountain, the natives
who followed would have persuaded us not to go any farther, and
informed us that the inhabitants on the other side of this ridge
would eat us; we, however, persisted in ascending to the top, for
we were sufficiently armed to be under no apprehension of danger
from these cannibals. Those who accompanied us were, without
doubt, at war with the others, for they would not follow us any
farther.</p>
<p>The mountains which we ascended rise in the form of an
amphitheatre, and are a continuation of the great chain which
runs the whole length of the island. Their perpendicular height
is about 2,500 feet above the level of the sea. We observed them
rise gradually to the east-south-east, till they terminated in a
very high mountain about three miles from our moorings.</p>
<p>The chief component parts of those mountains are quartz, mica,
and steatite, of a softer or harder quality, schorl of a green
colour, granite, iron ore, &amp;c.</p>
<p>On our descent from these mountains, we stopped at the bottom
in the midst of several families of savages assembled in the
neighbourhood of their huts, to whom we signified a desire to
quench our thirst with the water of the cocoa-nuts; but as this
fruit is rather scarce in that part of the island, they consulted
together for a considerable time before they agreed to sell us
any. At last one of their number went to pull a few from the top
of one of the highest trees, in order to bring them to us. We
were extremely surprised at the rapidity with which he ascended,
holding the body of the tree with his hands, he ran along the
whole length of it, almost with as much case and celerity as if
he had been walking on an horizontal plain. I never before had
occasion to admire such agility amongst any of the other
islanders whom we had visited.</p>
<p>The sea water frequently washed the foot of the tree from
which our cocoa-nuts were taken, so that the liquor with which
they were filled was somewhat sour, but we drank it, being
extremely thirsty. The children of these savages waited till we
had emptied the water of the cocoa-nuts, when they begged them of
us, finding means to get something more from them. They tore with
their teeth the fibrous covering of these young fruits, of which
the nuts were scarcely formed, and then eat the tender part
enclosed in it, which was much too bitter for our palates.</p>
<p>When we arrived on board, we learned that two of the islanders
had that morning carried off from an officer of our vessel
(Bonvouloir), a uniform cap and a sabre, while he was occupied on
shore making some astronomical observations, although the
sailors, who had landed with him, had traced upon the sand a
large circle round the place of observation, which they had
forbidden the savages to enter; but two thieves having concerted
their enterprise, advanced with precipitation behind the officer
who had just sat down, and placed his sabre underneath him. One
of them seized his cap, and the instant he rose up to pursue him,
the other ran away with his sabre. This bold manoeuvre was
certainly not their first attempt.</p>
<p>Night approached, all our boats were, already alongside, yet
two officers (Dewelle and Willaumez), were still on shore, with
two of the ship's crew, but, they soon arrived on the beach,
followed by a great number of the inhabitants. The General's boat
was instantly dispatched to bring them on board. They told us
that the savages, who had crowded around them, to the number of
above three hundred, upon observing that all our boats had
quitted the shore, had behaved in the most audacious manner. One
of them having wrested his sword from Dewelle, the latter
attempted to pursue the thief, but the others immediately raised
their clubs in his defence. All of our people were robbed with
the greatest effrontery, but when our boat arrived, two chiefs,
who probably had prevented the savages from proceeding to greater
extremities, begged leave to embark in it. They carried two small
parcels of sugar-cane and cocoa-nuts to the General, who made
them in return a present of an axe, and several pieces of stuff.
Those chiefs, whom they called <i>Theabouma</i> in their
language, wore on their head bonnets of a cylindrical form,
adorned with feathers, shells, &amp;c. (See Plate XXXVII, Fig.
1st and 2d.) but as they were open at top, they were no covering
from the rain.</p>
<p>It was not long before a double canoe, dispatched from the
shore, came to convey the chiefs back again. It was night before
they departed, and the savages on shore had lighted a fire on a
sandbank to warm themselves. We went ashore on the 25th with
those of the crew who were appointed to recruit our stock of
wood, which they cut at a place 500 yards distant from where we
had watered.</p>
<p>We did not stray far from our wood-cutters, for we were but
few in number, and the designs of the natives appeared to us very
suspicious. About nine in the morning they took possession of our
shallop which was anchored near the coast, and only guarded by
one man. They were already, dragging it towards the strand, in
order to carry off the effects that were in it with the greater
ease, when another boat's crew came to its relief; but the
thieves did not give up their enterprise till they were on the
point of being fired upon.</p>
<p>Lasseny having gone on shore to make some astronomical
observations, was obliged to re-embark almost immediately, being
unable to keep off a number, of savages who seemed inclined to
attempt the seizure of the instruments, although he was armed and
accompanied by two assistants, besides several of the boat's
crew.</p>
<p>The master gunner of the Esperance, while hunting in the
forest, perceived about noon, in a large open space not far from
the wood-cutters, above two hundred natives, who were practising
themselves in throwing their darts, and different exercises. He
retired unperceived, and hastened to relate to us what he had
just witnessed. One of the officers of our vessel immediately
went with four fusileers to observe the motions of the savages;
who, on perceiving them, advanced; and obliged them to make a
precipitate retreat towards the wood-cutters. The savages soon
repaired thither likewise; and we were not long before we
discovered the design they had formed of seizing our axes, which
had been laid in a heap in the midst of our workmen, who were
assembled to take some refreshment. The commanding officer
instantly gave orders for those tools to be carried into the long
boat; but the sailor who attempted it was assailed by the
islanders, who were on the point of carrying them off, when
several musquet shots were fired. One of the most audacious, who
fell on that occasion, had still strength enough to crawl as far
as the wood. The others retired immediately, and saluted us with
a shower of stones from their slings. The stones, which they
carried in small bags suspended from their belts, were cut into
an oval form; but they did not wound any one dangerously, on
account of the great distance; besides, most of them were stopped
by the branches of the trees, behind which the natives had taken
refuge. This is not always the case when they fight among
themselves; for being then probably less afraid to advance, they
frequently have their eyes beat out in these battles, as several
of the inhabitants, who had lost one of them, informed us. When
they discharge the stones from their slings they only make half a
turn with them above their heads, which is done with as much
expedition as if thrown with the hand. These stones, cut from a
steatite of considerable hardness, are very smooth, for which
reason the savages take the precaution to wet them with their
spittle, to prevent their sliding from the two small cords of
which the bottoms of their slings are formed.</p>
<p>The different movements of these savages having been perceived
from on board the Recherche, the General ordered two cannon-shot
to be fired on them, which made them immediately disperse across
the wood; but soon after one of their chiefs advanced towards us
alone and unarmed, holding in his hand a piece of white stuff,
made of the bark of a tree, which the Commanding Officer received
as a token that the good understanding between us and the savages
should not be interrupted. Soon after four other natives came and
sat down in the midst of us with as much confidence as their
chief, behind whom they placed themselves; but he seemed much
displeased with several others who came to rest themselves under
the shade of the neighbouring trees, whom he several times called
robbers (<i>kaya</i>).</p>
<p>We re-embarked at four o'clock, P.M. and were already steering
towards our ships, when we saw a troop of savages running along
the strand towards us, loaded with a variety of fruits, which
they had brought as a present for us. They leaped into the water
several times to bring them to us, but we were driven in a
westerly direction by a strong current, and could not stop to
receive those marks of reconciliation.</p>
<p>I went on shore next day very near the watering place at the
same time that the General arrived there. The guard was stronger
than the day before, in order the better to keep the islanders in
awe. It was feared after what had passed the preceding day, they
might attempt to poison the water with which we were going to
fill our casks, and it was thought necessary, according to the
opinion of our Chief Surgeon, to try the experiment on a goose;
but it was attended with no bad effects. Indeed, several of our
sailors would not wait for the result of that proof, but, being
very thirsty, had already drank of the water even before the
commencement of the experiment.</p>
<p>The inhabitants having approached our place of landing, lines
were drawn on the sand, the limits of which they were forbidden
to pass, and we had the satisfaction to observe that they
submitted peaceably to those orders. We gave to most of them
pieces of biscuit, which they begged by extending one hand,
whilst with the other they pointed to their bellies, which were
naturally very flat, but the muscles of which they contracted as
much as possible, to make them look still more empty. I saw,
nevertheless, one man whose stomach was already well lined, but
who, in our presence, eat a piece of steatite, which was very
soft, of a greenish colour, and twice as large as a man's fist.
We afterwards saw a number of others eat of the same earth, which
serves to allay the sensation of hunger by filling the stomach,
and thereby supporting the viscera of the diaphragm; although
that substance affords no nutritive aliment, it is nevertheless
very useful to these people, who are often exposed to long
privations from food, because they neglect the cultivation of the
soil, which is of itself very barren.</p>
<p>It is probable that the natives of New Caledonia have made
choice of this earth on account of its being very liable to
crumble; it is extremely easy of digestion, and one would never
have suspected that cannibals would have recourse to, such an
expedient when pressed by hunger.</p>
<p>Three women having joined the other savages who surrounded us,
gave us no very favourable idea of their music. They sung a trio,
keeping time very exactly, but the roughness and discordant tones
of their voices excited in us very disagreeable sensations, which
the savages, however, seemed to listen to with much pleasure.</p>
<p>Lahaie, the gardener, and myself, ventured into the middle of
the wood, followed by only two of the ship's company; we went
from choice into those places where we thought we had least
chance of meeting with the natives, who took care to conceal
themselves behind bushes when they perceived us; at other times
they hid themselves behind large trees, changing their position
as we moved; but one old man, finding us approaching on both
sides of the tree, behind which, he was, so that he could not
conceal himself, came up to us as if abandoning himself to our
discretion, but he soon appeared satisfied he was safe when we
gave him a few pieces of biscuit.</p>
<p>The gardener had already scattered in the wood different sorts
of seeds which he had brought from Europe; but as some still
remained, he gave them to the savage, requesting him to sow
them.</p>
<p>We soon discovered a number of huts standing at some distance
from each other, and were surprised at not finding any
inhabitants in them. They were constructed in the same manner as
that described in the beginning of this chapter; further on we
perceived a heap of ashes; probably one of the habitations had
been recently consumed by the fire which the savages kindle to
drive away the musquitoes.</p>
<p>Two tombs which were not far distant had not sustained any
damage. I saw two human bones, each suspended by a cord to a long
pole stick, in the ground; the one was a tibia, the other a thigh
bone.</p>
<p>I observed, on the hills which I crossed to return to our
landing place, the tree called <i>commersonia echinata</i>, which
is very common in the Moluccas. Amongst the different sorts of
shrubs which I gathered was a jessamine remarkable for the
plainness of its leaves and its flowers, which have no smell, and
are of the colour of marigolds.</p>
<p>Several fires lighted near the summit of the neighbouring
mountain convinced us that it served as a retreat for the
natives.</p>
<p>On arriving at our landing place we found a great number of
savages, who had assembled there since our departure. They
informed us that several of the inhabitants had been wounded in
the affair of the preceding evening, and that one had already
expired of his wounds. They did not manifest any hostile
dispositions towards us; but a boat belonging to the Esperance
being at a considerable distance from thence towards the east,
had been attacked by another party of savages, who thought they
were in some sufficient to make themselves mailers of it, but
fortunately they failed in the attempt.</p>
<p>We were told on arriving on board that not a single, canoe had
approached our vessels; which we thought was rather to be
attributed to a smart gale which had blown the whole day, than to
any fear of our resentment for the hostile disposition manifested
by them the preceding evening.</p>
<p>We had formed a design, together with several persons
belonging to the two vessels, to go and visit the other side of
the mountains, bearing south of our moorings; for this purpose we
assembled on the shore to the number of twenty-eight, early in
the morning of the 26th. We had all agreed to come armed, that we
might be able to render mutual assistance, in case the savages
should venture to make an attack upon us.</p>
<p>We marched for a long while in paths that were well beaten,
accompanied by some of the inhabitants, and many of us, in
imitation of them, chewed the young sprouts of the <i>hibiscus
tiliaceus</i>, and threw them away almost immediately; but to our
great surprise the savages eagerly picked them up, and chewed
them over again without the least hesitation.</p>
<p>When we had reached the middle of the mountain we found very
large blocks of mica, wherein we perceived granites which had
lost their transparency, and most of them larger than a man's
thumb. We found others farther on in the rocks of freestone,
which were very small, but retained their lustre.</p>
<p>A smoke which we observed to issue at intervals from grove at
a small distance to the S.S.W. induced us to direct our course
that way. We there found two men and a child occupied in
broiling, in a fire of charcoal, the roots of a sort of bean,
which is known to botanists by the name of <i>dolichos
tuberosus</i>, and which the islanders call <i>yale</i>. They had
been but recently dug up, for the stalks were still hanging to
them, and were covered with flowers and fruits. They partook of,
the barrenness of the soil which produced them, the fibres were
very stringy, and they were not more than three-quarters of an
inch in thickness, and about ten or eleven inches in length.</p>
<p>We met very near the same spot with a small family, which
appeared to be alarmed at our approach. We immediately made each
of them a few presents, in hopes of encouraging them, which had
the desired effect upon the husband and two children; but one of
our people having offered a pair of scissars to the mother; and
wishing to shew her the use of them, by cutting off a few of her
hairs, the poor woman began instantly to cry, no doubt giving
herself up for lost: but her fears subsided as soon as she was
put in possession of the instrument.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of these mountains appeared to us to live in
the greatest wretchedness. They were all extremely meagre. They
sleep in the open air without being tormented by the musquitoes;
for these insects are driven from the high grounds by the E.S.E.
winds, which blow here almost incessantly. The same winds are so
prejudicial to vegetation, that trees which below grow to a great
height, here wear the appearance of shrubs. <i>Melaleuca
latifolia</i>, for example, is scarcely fourteen inches high,
whereas on the hills it attains the height of twenty-seven or
thirty feet. But still there are vegetables peculiar to the
summits of those mountains, which appear to agree perfectly well
with the current of air to which they are thus exposed. I shall
give a description of one of the most remarkable. It forms a new
genus, which I distinguish by the name of
<i>dracophyllum</i>.</p>
<p>The calix is composed of six small oval leaves, pointed
towards the end.</p>
<p>The corolla is in one piece, and divided slightly on the
border into six equal parts. It is surrounded with six small
scales at the lower end.</p>
<p>The stamina, to the number of six, are attached to the corolla
by small fine threads, nearly of the same length with the
anther&aelig;.</p>
<p>The ovarium is at the top, of a roundish form, and surmounted
by a style, of which the stigma is of a simple form.</p>
<p>The capsule is composed of six cells, each containing a number
of seeds, most of which are unproductive.</p>
<p>I ought to observe, that one of the parts of fructification is
often wanting.</p>
<p>I have given this plant the name of <i>dracophyllum
verticillatum</i>, its flowers being disposed in rings.</p>
<p>These leaves are rough, and slightly dentated, or notched, on
the edges. They leave their impression on the stalk as they
separate from it, as is the case with all sorts of
<i>dracaena</i>, with which that plant has a great analogy, even
in the texture of the wood it produces. It is therefore of the
division of <i>minocotyledon</i>, although it has a calyx and a
corolla, and naturally takes the next place to the species of
asparagus.</p>

<p>In examining from the summit of these mountains a great extent
of breakers which defend the approach to this island, we observed
another passage, at a small distance to the west of that by which
our vessels had reached their present moorings. Towards the south
we had a prospect of a delightful valley, surrounded with large
plantations of cocoa trees, from amongst which we saw columns of
smoke arising, from the fires made by the savages. Vast fields,
which appeared to us to be cultivated, even in the lowest parts,
indicated a great population. The valley was traversed by a canal
filled with water, which we mistook for a river, the different
branches of which came from the foot of the eastern mountains;
but we afterwards found that this canal was filled with stagnated
sea-water. We perceived towards the south-west the shoal, along
which we had sailed the year before; and we distinguished the
same inlet in it which the violence of the wind had prevented us
from sounding. It appeared to us a place of safety for such
vessels as wished to anchor out of the reach of breakers.</p>
<p>We were only followed by three natives, who no doubt had seen
us sail along the western coast of their island last year; for
before they had quitted us, they spoke of two vessels they had
seen in that direction.</p>
<p>We proceeded for some time along the tops of the mountains
towards the south-west, then we descended into a hollow, where we
found two men and a child, who showed no concern with respect to
us, and did not quit the rock upon which they were seated. When
we were close by them, they shewed us a basket (see Plate
XXXVIII. Fig. 24), filled with roots, resembling those of a kind
of sun-flower called <i>helianthus tuberosus</i>. They called
them <i>paoua</i>, saying that they were good to eat, and, they
wanted to sell us a small quantity.</p>
<p>Perceiving, at about thirty yards distance, a thick smoke
issuing from the midst of large broken rocks, which offered a
good shelter from the wind, we directed our course towards it,
and found a young savage busy roasting some roots, amongst which
we distinguished those of the <i>dolichos tuberosus</i>. He did
not appear surprized at our visit, and smiled at us from the
bottom of his cavern, which was filled with a very black smoke,
whereby he however did not appear to be at all incommoded.</p>
<p>Near, this place the side of the mountain, laid open by the
torrents which descend in the rainy season, discovered to us
clusters of beautiful pieces of green schorl in a soft steatite,
and below that small fragments of a very transparent rock
chrystal.</p>
<p>In returning to our vessel we came through a small village,
the inhabitants of which left their huts unarmed. They allowed us
to examine the inside of them, and one of them, without any
hesitation, sold us some human bones which were hanging up over
one of their tombs.</p>
<p>We soon after arrived on the sea coast, where we found a party
of the natives who followed us, begging something to eat, but as
all our provisions were confirmed, I gave them some green
steatite, which I had brought from the summit of one of the
mountains; some of them eat as much as two pounds weight of
it.</p>
<p>Whilst we were embarking in order to return en board, one of
the crew fired his piece in the air to unload it, which struck
such a panick in most of the islanders who were on the shore,
that they instantly ran off to conceal themselves in the woods;
but some of them, confident of our good intentions towards them,
shewed no symptoms of fear, but called back the fugitives, who
soon rejoined them.</p>
<p>On the 27th I was obliged to remain all day on board, in order
to arrange and write descriptions of various articles which I had
collected the day before.</p>
<p>We received a visit from several of the natives who swam to
the vessel. They were at great pains to assure us that they were
not in the number of those who had committed acts of hostility
against us, and they told us they had eaten two of those robbers,
or kaya, one of whom had received a ball in the thigh and another
in the belly in the engagement with us, but we did not give
entire credit to this story, supposing they had fabricated it to
screen themselves from suspicion.</p>
<p>They brought with them an instrument which they called
<i>nbouet</i>, a name which they likewise gave to their tombs; it
was formed of a fine piece of flat serpentine stone, with sharp
edges, and nearly of an oval form, perfectly well polished, and
of the length of nearly seven inches. It was perforated with two
holes, through each of which passed two very flexible rods,
whereby it was fixed to a wooden handle, to which they were
fastened with bands made of bat's-skin. This instrument was
supported by a pedestal made of a cocoa-nut shell, which was
likewise tied with strings of the same kind, some of which were
longer (See Plate XXXVIII, Fig. 19). We could not till then
discover the use of this instrument; these savages told us that
it was to cut up the limbs of their enemies, which they divided
amongst them after a battle. One of them shewed us the manner, by
imitating it on one of the ship's company, who, at his desire,
lay down on his back. The savage first represented a combat, in
which he indicated by signs that the enemy fell under the strokes
of his javelin and club, which he brandished with great violence.
He then performed a sort of warlike dance, holding in his hand
the instrument of murder; he then shewed us that they begin by
opening the belly with the nbouet, throwing away the intestines,
after having torn them out with an instrument (represented in
Plate XXXVIII. Fig. 20), made of two human cubitus, well
polished, and fixed to a very strong tape. He shewed us they next
cut off the parts of generation, which fell to the share of the
conqueror. The legs and arms are cut off at the joints, and
distributed, as well as the other parts, amongst the combatants
to carry home to their families. It is difficult to describe the
ferocious avidity with which he represented to us the manner in
which the flesh of the unfortunate victim is devoured by them,
after being broiled on a fire of charcoal.</p>
<p>The same cannibal gave us likewise to understand that the
flesh of the arms and legs is cut into pieces about three inches
thick, and that the muscular parts are reckoned by these people a
very delicious morsel. It was no longer difficult for us to
conceive why they felt our legs and arms with their fingers in a
longing manner, at which times they made a slight whistling
noire, produced by shutting the teeth, and applying the end of
the tongue to them, then opening their mouths, they gave several
smacks with their lips.</p>
<p>We went on shore on the 28th, but not being in sufficient
numbers, durst not venture to go far beyond our watering place.
We no longer saw in the environs large parties of natives, as on
the first days after anchoring here, which made us think that
they had returned to their habitations, probably at a
considerable distance from this place; indeed how could such a
vast number of men have found the means of subsistence on a coast
so extremely barren.</p>
<p>Next day (the 29th), we set off early, to the number of
eighteen, all well armed, with the intention of ascending a very
high mountain, situated to the south-south-east, and from thence
descending, if the weather should prove favourable, into a
delightful valley, which we had already perceived at a great
distance behind the mountain.</p>
<p>We marched at first towards the east along the shore, and soon
entered an extensive wood, when, amongst other birds which we
killed, there was a species of pie, which I named the pie of New
Caledonia. It is entirely black except the breast, shoulders and
neck, which are white. The bill is rather jagged at the extremity
of each mandible, and is of a light black from the root to within
one-third of the point, the remainder is yellowish. The feathers
of the tail are arranged in rows two by. two, the upper ones
being much longer than the others (See Plate XXXIX, in which the
bird is represented.)</p>

<b>PLATE XXXIX. <i>Magpie of New Caledonia</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>We had already proceeded above a mile, when we arrived at a
village composed of a small number of huts, sufficiently distant
from each other to prevent the flames from communicating in case
of any unfortunate conflagration. Two of them had been recently
consumed. We there saw women cooking victuals, composed of the
bark of trees and a variety of roots, amongst which I discerned
those of the hypoxis, of which I have already made mention. These
different articles were put dry into a large earthen pot,
supported over a fire by three large stones, which supplied the
place of a trevet. We observed near the entrance to one of those
huts a large heap of human bones, on which the recent effects of
fire were very evident.</p>
<p>It was probably an inhabitant of this village who stole the
sabre of Bonvouloir, as related above, for here we found the
sheath and belt suspended over one of their tombs, as a kind of
trophy.</p>
<p>Upon leaving this village, we followed a beaten path to the
south-east, where we were not long before we saw some Caribbee
cabbages (<i>arum esculentum</i>), planted near a rivulet, the
stream of which the inhabitants of the island had turned off
lower down to a plantation of <i>arum macrorrhizon</i>. Farther
on we remarked some young banana trees planted at five or six
yards distance from each other, as also some sugar canes.</p>
<p>Soon after this we were surrounded by at least forty of the
natives, who came out from the adjacent huts, and from some
straggling cottages scattered in an extensive plain covered with
plants and shrubs, above which rose a small number of cocoa
trees; but we were astonished to see only very few men amongst
these savages, all of whom were either old or infirm, and most of
them cripples. The remainder consisted of women and children, who
testified much joy at receiving some presents of glass ware which
we gave them. We presumed that the stout men were engaged at a
distance in some expedition again their neighbours.</p>
<p>We were about one mile distant from the first village when we
discovered another twice as large, situated on the borders of a
small river, along which we went upon a rising ground in a
southerly direction. Upwards of thirty natives came out to meet
us, and followed us for some time. We soon perceived three others
descend from the mountains, one of whom we knew, having received
several visits from him on board the Recherche. Several amongst
the natives pointed him out to us as a chief of great
distinction, whom they called <i>Aliki</i>.</p>
<p>We sat down on the borders of the small river to take some
refreshment, and to prevent the danger of any surprize from the
savages, we invited them to sit down. Aliki immediately complied
with our invitation, and his example was followed by the others.
The water being a few paces below us, the savages filled our
bottles as fast as we emptied them.</p>
<p>After breakfast we ascended towards the south, accompanied by
<i>Aliki</i> and three other natives, who testified a strong
desire to follow us. Some cocoa and banana trees, planted on the
least rugged of the borders of the hollow formed by the waters of
the small river, pointed out to us the residence of some of the
natives. We found there a hut exactly like those which we had had
seen before. <i>Aliki</i> said the hut belonged to him. It was
surrounded with several of a new species of fig tree, the fruit
of which those people eat, after having exposed it to the fire
for some time in earthen vessels, in order to extract its
corrosive quality.</p>
<p>Clouds, brought on by a brisk gale from the south-east,
covered the tops of the mountains about ten in the morning, and
occasioned a heavy shower of rain, of which the savages took
scarcely any notice. They did not even seek for any shelter;
whilst we retired underneath the thickest trees. As soon as it
ceased we continued our route, and they followed us with many
marks of friendship. One of them, wishing to relieve a sailor who
was loaded with a large tin-box, filled with a variety of objects
of natural history, carried it for above four hours.</p>
<p>We soon after crossed over the small river, on the banks of
which I observed the <i>acanthus ilicifolius</i>. We then
ascended very rugged rocks for a considerable time, and were
under great obligations to the savages, who exerted themselves in
supporting its by the arms, to prevent our falling.</p>
<p>Each of them carried an axe of serpentine stone; and one of
them wishing to show us how they made use of them to cut wood,
hacked off a branch of the <i>melaleuca latifolia</i>, about four
inches thick.</p>
<p>It was not till after a number of strokes, that he was able to
make a slight notch in it, then he broke it by forcibly bending
down the end of it; they all shewed the greatest surprize at
seeing us cut down in a short time, with a military axe, some of
the largest trees in the forest.</p>
<p>We had just reached the summit of one of the highest of those
mountains, when one of our people made signs to the savages that
he wished to have some water to drink. Immediately two of them
offered to go and fetch some from a hollow that appeared to be
above half a mile distant. They set off, and we soon lost sight
of them. As they were a long time before they returned, we were
afraid they had gone away with the bottles we had entrusted them
with, but at last they returned, and appeared pleased that they
had it in their power to offer us some very pure water to quench
our thirst.</p>
<p>After this we descended towards the south-east and crossed a
fine valley, where I made a copious collection of plants, among
which were the <i>acrostichum australe</i>, and several new
species of <i>limodorum</i>.</p>
<p>A very heavy rain obliged us to seek for shelter in the
hollows of the rocks, where we remained for some time. We invited
the savages who accompanied us to partake of our repast, but were
much surprised to find those cannibals reject with disdain the
salted pork which was offered them.</p>
<p>The badness of the weather having prevented our continuing all
night on the mountains, we returned towards our vessels, going in
a westerly direction, in order to follow the declivity into a
large valley, parallel with that which we had just crossed. I
there observed many new species of <i>passiflora</i>. The ginger,
<i>amomum zingiber</i>, grew there abundantly, but the natives
told us they made no use of it. As soon as we arrived on the
shore, where we found our boats in waiting, to take us on board
the ships, they quitted us, and went off to the eastward.</p>
<p>I employed the whole of the 30th in describing and assorting
the numerous collection of articles of natural history, which I
had made the day before.</p>
<p>MAY 1st. This day we went towards the south-east, and after
having penetrated a considerable way into the woods, we arrived
at a hut surrounded with palisades, behind which were a woman and
two children, who appeared frightened on our approach, but they
resumed their courage upon our presenting them with some pieces
of cloth, and a few glass beads.</p>
<p>We next went towards two great fires that were kindled by the
savages in one of the most gloomy parts of the forest. They
dispersed as soon as they perceived us, leaving two baskets
filled with the bark of trees.</p>
<p>Soon after we arrived on the borders of some marches, where we
killed several beautiful birds of the genus <i>muscicapa</i>;
they had been attracted thither by the swarms of musquitoes,
which served them for food. Further on we so found two young
girls who had just lighted a fire: they were dressing for their
repast different sorts of roots, amongst which I recognized
several belonging to plants which I had met with under the shade
of the large trees in the forest. The girls left their provisions
for some time, retiring as we approached them.</p>
<p>On our quitting the wood, we met with several savages who
accompanied us to our landing place. They were much amused with
seeing Citizen Riche's dog pursue some of the natives who were at
a considerable distance, and whom he soon overtook, though they
ran as fast as they could. As he did them no injury, those who
were with us begged us to let him at some women who were then
coming out of the wood, and were anticipating their fright, but
we would not be persuaded to comply with their request.</p>
<p>We were witness, on arriving at the shore, to a fact which
proves the great corruption of manners amongst these cannibals.
There were two girls, the oldest of whom was not more than
eighteen, who were shewing to our sailors that part which they
are accustomed to conceal with the fringed girdle mentioned
above, and which forms the whole of their clothing. A nail, or
something of equal value, was fixed upon as the price of this
favour; but they took care to make their curious customers pay
beforehand.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the ship, I found a chief who had dined at
the table with the officers. He had come in his canoe,
accompanied by his wife, whom he would never allow to come on
board, notwithstanding our repeated requests to that purpose.</p>
<p>On the 2d we went a shooting in the great woods, which we had
not explored, to the south-east, where we killed a prodigious
quantity of birds. We stopped in a small village, where we saw
over two tombs pieces of wood rudely carved: the inhabitants told
us that it was forbidden to approach them, but they consented
very readily to sell us in exchange for some pieces of cloth a
human scull that was suspended over another tomb, the coronal
bone of which was fractured on the left side. They informed us,
that the warrior it belonged to had been killed in battle by a
club.</p>
<p>Next morning early, twenty of us set off with an intention to
cross the mountains, and front thence to descend into the
extensive valley, where, in one of our excursions, we had
descried at a great distance a considerable number of cultivated
fields. It was probable that we should there meet with a great
number of inhabitants, but we were sufficiently armed to be able
to repel any attack which they might venture to make.</p>
<p>At first we followed the coast, advancing towards the west,
and penetrating from time to time into the woods, we saw a number
of inhabitants quit their huts, and leave behind them a net which
they had spread out to dry. It appeared that that implement of
fishing is very rare amongst these savages: its common size is
about eight yards in length, and eighteen inches in breadth. They
shewed us but very few of them during our whole stay in the
island, and no price could tempt any of them to part with
one.</p>
<p>We perceived near this place a great quantity of broken shells
of fish, which had served the Islanders for food. We found
several of the species known by the name of <i>benitier</i>, of
the length of twelve or thirteen inches. They still bore the
marks of the fire which had served to dress the animal contained
in them.</p>
<p>The women principally are employed in fishing for shell-fish.
We saw some of them from time to time, opposite to where we lay
at anchor, who advanced into the water up to their waists and
gathered great quantities, which they discovered in the sand, by
means of pointed sticks with which they groped for them.</p>
<p>We had already gone about three miles along the coast without
finding any stream of water, when three young savages came to
meet us, and persuaded us to follow them to their cottage, not
far out of our road. We then found a spring, below which they had
dug some trenches to conduct the water to some plants of the
<i>arum macrorrhizon</i>, the roots of which they eat.</p>
<p>We were on the dope of a small hill, under the shade of some
cocoa trees. One of the savages, whom I requested to procure us
some of their fruit, climbed to the top of the tree with an
extraordinary degree of agility.</p>
<p>We soon after continued our course to the westward. The air
was serene, and the heat excessive, and we were attacked by a
cloud of musquitoes, which tormented us very much, by stinging
every part of the body, not even sparing our eyes and ears.
Fortunately a breeze of wind springing up soon after, relieved us
from their persecutions, by dispersing them.</p>
<p>Soon after this we arrived on the borders of a deep canal,
which went in an inland direction to the foot of a very craggy
mountain. This canal served as a harbour for the islanders, three
of whom we saw enter it in a double canoe, which they immediately
fastened with a rope tied to the foot of a tree on the same side
we were. They then went at a slow pace towards the small hills on
the south-east, pretending not to have perceived us. Their canoe
was the only one in the harbour. We made use of it to cross to
the other side, where we found a small cottage, the plantations
contiguous to which had been recently laid waste. We still
perceived tome remains of Caribbee cabbages, and of sugar canes.
The tops of all the cocoa trees had been cut off, and perhaps
inhabitants had fallen victims to the voracity of the barbarians
who had thus destroyed them.</p>
<p>Till then we had never met with any of the tombs of the
savages, except close by their huts, but we now found one at a
great distance from any habitation whatever, on the side of the
road which we pursued. It differed from the others, being built
of stone from the base till about half way up.</p>
<p>We halted about noon, under the shade of several <i>casuarina
equesetifolia</i>, and of several new species of <i>cerbera</i>,
which grew on the banks of a rivulet, where we quenched our
thirst, and in which we found some fragments of <i>roche de
corne</i>, brought down by the water. We caught two sea-snakes
(<i>coluber laticandotus</i>), which we broiled and eat, but
found very tough and ill tasted.</p>
<p>We were about eleven miles distant from our vessels when fresh
marks of devastation made us lament the lot of the wretched
inhabitants, whom revenge often prompts to the commission of the
most horrible excesses. They had destroyed the principal
habitations, and cut off the tops of all the cocoa trees about
them, having only spared two small sheds which were covered with
spongy bark of the <i>melaleuca latifolia</i>.</p>
<p>Presently after a forest of cocoa trees, whose tops we
perceived at the distance of a mile and a half to the west,
together with several columns of smoke which rose in different
directions, were indications of a great population. We directed
our course toward this place for some time, but the marshy ground
which we must have crossed to reach it, caused us to abandon our
design; besides, the day drew towards a close. We then went
southward in search of a commodious situation to pass the night
in, when we soon pitched on an eminence, the difficult access to
which secured us from being surprised by the savages. We lighted
a fire, for the cold was sharp and piercing on those high
grounds, and we felt it the more sensibly, as during the day we
had experienced in the plain a very great degree of heat.</p>
<p>I gave all the birds which I did not mean to preserve to those
of the ship's crew who accompanied us, and amongst those which
they broiled immediately for our supper were several of the
<i>corvus caledonicus</i>, and some very large pigeons of a new
species, which I had before met with on the first days after our
arrival.</p>
<p>We all supped and then went to sleep, leaving two of our
number to watch by turn, for it was to be feared that the light
of our fire would bring some of the islanders to us. In a very
short time we were apprised that the light of several torches,
with which the savages were approaching our retreat in an
easterly direction, was perceived towards the foot of the
mountains. In an instant, we were all on our legs to observe
their motions, and prepared to give them such a reception as
circumstances might render necessary in case of attack; but after
traversing several small hills, they descended towards the coast,
getting farther from us to the eastward. Perhaps these cannibals
were upon some expedition against their enemies. As we did not
appear to be the object they were in quest of, we immediately lay
down again to sleep, trusting to the vigilance of our
centinels.</p>
<p>4th. At day-break we ascended towards the south-east, and were
not long before we reached the summit of the mountain, from
whence we perceived, toward the west-south-west, on the sea
coast, the great opening of the canal which traverses the plain
we proposed to visit.</p>
<p>We soon descended into a valley, nearly about the middle of
which stood a delightful grove, to appearance planted by the hand
of man, but it was only the goodness of the soil, moistened by
the water from the neighbouring mountains, that rendered the
bushes so strong and luxuriant. I then collected a great number
of plants, amongst which I found a new kind of fern of the
<i>myriotheca</i> species, the tallest of which rose to the
height of twelve feet, although the stem was not more than three
inches and three quarters in circumference.</p>
<p>On leaving the grove we perceived two natives about three
hundred yards below us, going towards the plain, of which we now
discovered the full extent. They looked at us without stopping,
notwithstanding the signs of invitation we made them to come to
us. One of them carried on his shoulder, at the end of a stick, a
basket, in all probability filled with roots.</p>
<p>We had only a few more small hills to cross before we reached
the plain, when several of our companions, apprehensive that we
should be in want of victuals if we went much farther, or perhaps
that we should meet with numerous parties of savages, left us and
returned to the ships early in the day. Our number was now
reduced to fifteen, upon their departure; nevertheless we
continued our journey. We soon found by the side of a path which
seemed much frequented by the savages, several cabbage-palms, and
having refreshed ourselves with the tender leaves from the tops
of those trees, we descended into a hollow, where several fine
aleurites added to our repast a plentiful dessert of fruit, the
kernels of which we found of a very agreeable flavour.</p>
<p>The quartz and mica which were spread over a large space,
formed in that place a foliated rock of a very brilliant
appearance, composed of a thin strata.</p>
<p>We at length gained the plain, where the melancholy sight of a
habitation entirely destroyed, and cocoa trees cut up by the
roots, furnished us with fresh proofs of the barbarity of the
natives.</p>
<p>Farther on we saw plantations of yams, potatoes, &amp;c. We
proceeded for some time towards the south, and were surprised at
not seeing any of the savages, when I perceived an old man
employed in pulling up the roots of the <i>dolichos
tuberosus</i>, which he gave to a child to clean. He did not seem
in the least intimidated on observing us approach him, but every
feature of the child was expressive of the most violent
apprehension. The old man had lost one eye, which he told us had
been knocked out by a stone, and we thought we recognised him to
be one of those inhabitants who had come several times to visit
us on board of our vessels.</p>
<p>This man accompanied us along the path in a south-easterly
direction across the plain, but had much difficulty in keeping up
with us, for he had been wounded in one leg, where we perceived
two great scars opposite to each other, as if it had been pierced
through and through with a dart.</p>
<p>On both sides of the road we saw draggling huts at great
distances from each other, surrounded with cocoa trees. Only a
few savages appeared at a distance in the middle of the vast
plain. On our right lay a thick forest of cocoa trees extending
to the foot of the mountains, on the edge of which we perceived a
great number of huts.</p>
<p>We had gone a little more than a mile with the savage, when he
persuaded us to stop in the neighbourhood of a habitation,
probably his own, for he invited us to gather the fruit of the
cocoa trees which surrounded it ourselves, excusing himself from
climbing the trees on account of his wounds. I gave him some
pieces of cloth of different colours, and some nails, which he
seemed to value highly.</p>
<p>Soon after a another savage came to us, and both followed us
till we came to the banks of a branch of the great canal which
crossed the plain; it was filled with stagnant water, equally
salt with that of the sea.</p>
<p>We perceived at a distance some women and children, when our
two savages left us, after having pointed out the path which
concluded us to the mountains.</p>
<p>At the same instant some other natives set fire to the dry
grass at a great distance before us on the side of the path which
we were following, and immediately disappeared in the woods.</p>
<p>After proceeding about half an hour, I arrived on a very
agreeable eminence, where the natives had built themselves sheds
about six feet in height, in order to enjoy the fresh air. They
were of a semicircular form, and open at bottom all round to the
height of about one foot, to admit a free circulation of air. We
found no savages in either of two neighbouring huts, which were
built near a bog, surrounded with the <i>hibiscus tiliaceus</i>;
but contiguous to them we saw a large cultivated field, covered
with yams, potatoes, and a sort of hypoxis, the roots of which
those people eat, and which grows spontaneously in their
forests.</p>
<p>It was already one hour after dark, when we at last arrived at
the summit of the mountains; from whence, looking in a north-west
direction, we perceived the lights of our vessels. At six or
eight hundred paces below were several fires, lighted by the
natives. The cold compelled us likewise to kindle a very large
one, round which we sat down to refresh ourselves, after which we
went to sleep, leaving two sentinels to guard two passages by
which the islanders might come to surprize us, but none of them
attempted to disturb our repose. Only at day-break the sentinel
who was to the north-east espied three of them approaching very
slowly, but they returned back on hearing him cry out to warn us
of their coming.</p>
<p>5th. All our provisions being consumed, we felt sensibly the
necessity of returning on board. I could not, however, resist the
desire I had to spend a few hours in visiting a charming grove of
trees, situated on the other side of the mountain, at a small
distance from the place where we had passed the night. I there
observed a great quantity of plants, which I had not yet found in
any of the excursions I had made in this island. They belonged
chiefly to the class of the silver tree and the trumpet
flower.</p>
<p>I will here give a description of one of the finest shrubs
which grows on these heights. It forms a genus which I call
<i>antholoma</i>, and which ought to be placed amongst the
species of the plaqueminiers.</p>
<p>The calyx, composed of from two to four leaves of an oval
form, often falls off w when the flower blows.</p>
<p>The corolla is of one piece in the form of a cup, and
irregularly indented on the edges.</p>
<p>The stamina are numerous (about an hundred), and attached to a
fleshy receptacle.</p>
<p>The ovarium is of a pyramidal form, quadrangular, slightly
sunk into the receptacle, and surmounted by a style terminated by
a pointed stigma.</p>
<p>The fruit has four cells filled with a great number of seeds;
it was not yet ripe, but I think it becomes a capsule.</p>
<p>I have distinguished a shrub by the name of <i>antholoma
montana</i>, many plants of which I observed fifteen feet in
height. Its leaves are alternate, very strong, and, as well as
the flowers, are only to be found at the extremity of the
branches.</p>

<p>One of the geographers of our company having left us about
this time for the distance of rather more than half a mile, in
order to ascertain the position of the shoals which he discovered
from a high peak, received a visit from a savage, who approached
him in a threatening manner; he was armed with a dart and a club,
and we were afraid he intended to attack him, but he contented
himself with examining the instruments which he was using,
without giving him the smallest cause of complaint.</p>
<p>We arrived at our vessels about noon. I observed along the
coast a double canoe with two sails. It was constructed like
those of the islanders of New Caledonia, but the men who were in
it spoke the language of the natives of the Friendly Islands.
They were eight in number, being seven, men and one woman, all
very muscularly built (See Plate XXXIV.) They told us that the
island from whence they came was a day's sail to the east of our
moorings, and that the name of it was <i>Aouvea</i>; it was
doubtless the island of Beaupr&eacute; which they meant.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image27" id="Image27"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<b>PLATE XXXIV. <i>Woman of the Island of
Beaupr&eacute;&mdash;Man of the Island of
Beaupr&eacute;</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>These islanders, who were quite naked, had the end of the
prepuce tied to the lower part of the belly by a cord of the
outer covering of the cocoa-nut, which went twice round them.
They know the use of iron, and appeared much more intelligent
than the natives of New Caledonia.</p>
<p>I was much surprized to see one of the planks of their canoes
covered with a coat of varnish; and it appeared to have belonged
to some European vessel, which I was convinced of when I found
that the powder of lead formed a great part in the composition of
the varnish. Without doubt the plank had belonged to a vessel of
some civilized nation wrecked on this coast. I requested the
savages to inform us of what they knew concerning the plank; they
set sail soon after to the west, promising to return next day to
bring us information; but they did not keep their word; and we
never had an opportunity of seeing them again.</p>
<p>When we returned, we were informed that the same day that we
had left the ship on our excursion, the savages had attempted to
seize the hatchets of our wood-cutters, whom they had attacked
with stones, but two musket shots had been sufficient to disperse
them.</p>
<p>I employed the whole of the 6th to describe and arrange the
numerous collection of articles of natural history which I had
brought with me from the mountains.</p>
<p>Next day the intelligence of the death of Captain Huon, which
we learnt at day-break, spread a general sorrow amongst all those
concerned in the expedition. This skilful naval officer had
fallen a sacrifice to a hectic fever about one o'clock in the
morning, after an illness of several months. He met death with
the greatest coolness, and was interred, according to his
particular desire, near the centre of the island of Pudyona,
favoured by the veil of night. He had requested that no kind of
monument might be erected for him, apprehensive that it might
lead to a discovery of his burial place by the inhabitants of New
Caledonia.</p>
<p>Soon after sunrise eight of us went ashore, and penetrated
into the woods in a west-south-west direction. We soon arrived at
a cottage, from whence came a native carrying in his hand a mask,
which he agreed to sell to me for two joiner's chissels. This
mask was cut out of a piece of the wood of the cocoa tree (See
Plate XXXVII. Fig. 10.), but much better carved than the figures
we had seen in other places at the entrance into their houses. He
covered his face with it several times, peeping through the holes
made in the upper part of it. There was an opening for the mouth,
but there were none for the eyes. They probably make use of those
masks to prevent being known by their enemies when they undertake
any hostile enterprize.</p>
<p>We then advanced towards two fires lighted close by the huts,
where we found a man and woman dressing figs of a new species,
which they had placed upon the fire in a great earthen pot,
without water, to take away the corrosive quality. They called
those figs <i>ouyou</i>.</p>
<p>I remarked two children at the fire, regaling themselves with
spiders of a new species, which I had observed frequently in the
woods, where they spread their webs of such strength, as
frequently to incommode us very much in our progress. They first
killed them, covering them up in a great earthen vessel, which
they heated on a brisk fire. They then broiled and eat them. They
swallowed at least one hundred of them in our presence. We saw
afterwards in the same island several other inhabitants eagerly
seeking the same kind of food.</p>
<p>Such an extravagant and yet so general a taste amongst so many
numerous tribes caused us great surprize, although we knew that
some Europeans eat spiders, and in preference such as are found
in cellars, which they affirm taste like nuts.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of New Caledonia call this a species of
<i>nougui</i>, which I distinguish by the name of <i>aranea
edulis</i> (spider which the Caledonians eat.). This spider is
represented in Plate XII. Fig. 4. The situation of its eyes (See
Fig. 5 and 6.) which are eight in number, two being near the
middle of its back, at a great distance from the others, make me
give it a place in a new section of a black colour. Its back is
grey, and above is covered with silver down; between the eyes are
four spots of a brown colour; below it is black. The lower part
of the belly is of the same colour as the upper part of the back,
and is marked with from eight to ten spots of a brown colour. On
the sides are six greyish lines in an oblique direction, and
below several faun-coloured spots. The legs, which are also of a
faun-colour and covered with claws of a silver grey, are blackish
towards their extremity.</p>
<p>One of the fusileers who accompanied us had lost one of his
pistols; we informed the inhabitants of this circumstance, and
promised them a reward if they would bring it to us. It was with
considerable pleasure that we saw, an hour after we had quitted
them, a savage come running towards us with the pistol, which he
said he had found on the sands. In fact, the soldier remembers
having left it in the place where we had dined. A piece of cloth
and a waistcoat proved a very agreeable recompense to the
islander. He followed us for some time accompanied by another
Caledonian; then bid us adieu, pronouncing the word
<i>alaou&eacute;</i>, bowing slightly with his head, retiring
with an appearance of great satisfaction.</p>
<p>When we had reached the shore, one of us fired his piece as a
signal to the ship's company, that a boat might be sent off for
us; the noise of the explosion collected above eighty of the
natives around us. We invited them to sit down as fast as they
arrived, in order to prevent them from coming too close, and
notwithstanding the disproportion of our number, (for we were
only eight), they all agreed to our request. One of these savages
had a few tolerably sweet oranges, which he consented to sell to
me for a pair of scissars.</p>
<p>We learned, on arriving on board, that several persons
belonging to the Esperance, being in a canoe, had been assailed
this morning with a shower of stones by the natives, on which it
was found necessary so fire several musket shot to make them
retire into the wood. It must, however, be allowed, that this
contest was owing to the imprudence of one of our men, who,
wishing to keep the Caledonians at a distance, had pointed his
piece at them, which went off, through his aukwardness.</p>
<p>8th. General Dentrecasteaux gave the command of the Esperance
to Dauribeau.</p>
<p>I was very busy during the greater part of the day, at a work
which was indispensably necessary for the preservation of my
collections. In the afternoon I went on shore, and soon after I
perceived a number of the islanders who had attacked our
fishermen, in order to carry off both the net and the fish that
were caught. We were obliged to fire at least twenty musket shot
before they could be entirely dispersed. They stood firm on the
shore the whole time, returning our musketry with their slings, a
stone from one of which wounded the master-gunner of the
Esperance seriously in the arm; they then gave way, but in a few
seconds returned anew to the attack; however, when they perceived
two of their number fall, in consequence of our fire, and wounded
so as to be scarcely able to crawl to the neighbouring wood, they
were seized with a general panic, and fled, nor did any others
venture to renew the attack.</p>
<p>At the same time that this encounter began, the Commander in
Chief of the expedition left his vessel to go on board the
Esperance; he immediately directed his boat toward the shore, but
the savages were entirely dispersed before he arrived there.</p>
<p>Before our fishermen had been interrupted by the islanders,
they had caught several species of the <i>scorpaena</i>, amongst
which was that known by the name of <i>scorpaena digitata</i>
pricked one of our seamen so acutely in the hand, that for
several hours he felt a very violent pain through his whole
arm.</p>
<p>9th. This morning at day break we went ashore at the nearest
landing place to our ship, and six of us, well armed, penetrated
into the woods, advancing for a long time to the
south-south-west. I found on that excursion many plants which I
had not before met with.</p>
<p>I soon observed a large bread-fruit tree, which grew near the
middle of the mountain, being the second I, had met with in the
island. I took from it three suckers, which I planted in a box in
which I had put those I had taken in the Friendly Islands. Their
leaves were not so wide apart as those of the latter, perhaps
they might not produce such excellent fruit. But after the care
which I observed the natives take of that which I had seen in a
village to the south-east of our ship, I could not doubt but that
they set a great value on this tree; it was planted in a very
good soil, and surrounded with strong palisades. Neither of those
trees yielded fruit at that time, but had a great number of male
flowers.</p>
<p>We had already advanced a great way up the mountain, when some
of the people belonging to our vessel, who went on shore,
discharged their pieces before they returned on board. The report
of the musketry made us resolve to direct our course toward them
immediately, apprehensive of their being engaged with the
savages.</p>
<p>Night approached, and we went off to go on board our veal, but
the wind blew from east-south-east with such violence, and the
current was so strong, that they were driven rapidly to westward;
we had even great difficulty in making the Esperance, which we
left half an hour afterwards to go on board the Recherche, as the
weather had become more favourable.</p>
<p>The natives of New Caledonia are in general of the middle
size, we however, saw one who was more than six feet in height,
but very ill built. Their hair is woolly; their custom of pulling
it up by the roots is very general; but we saw some of them who,
let their beards grow. The colour of their skin is as dark as
that of the inhabitants of Diemen's land. They do not cover
themselves like the former with charcoal dust, though we remarked
a few amongst, them who had blackened a part of their breasts
with it; tracing thereon broad strokes in an oblique direction
which they call <i>poun</i>, in their language; many of them were
adorned with necklaces, like that represented in Plate XXXVII,
Fig. 4; these necklaces were made of twisted threads, suspended
from which they usually carried at the end of a bit of string, a
small piece of bone very indifferently carved, which appeared to
be a human bone. Their arms were sometimes ornamented with
bracelets cut, some from shells, Others of quartz, or very hard
stones. (See Plate XXXVII. Fig. 5 and 6.)</p>
<p>These warlike people devote the greatest attention to the
manufacture of their arms, which they polish perfectly well.
Their clubs are of a great variety of forms, some of which are to
be seen in Plate XXXVII.</p>
<p>I was much surprised to find that they were unacquainted with
the use of bows.</p>
<p>Their javelins, which are commonly fifteen feet in length, are
not more than two and a half inches in circumference in the
middle. I admired the ingenious method they had invented to
accelerate the motion of those javelins when they throw them. For
that purpose they employ a piece of very elastic cord, made of
the covering of the cocoa-nut and fish skin, one extremity of
which they fix to the end of the fore-finger, and the other which
ends in a sort of round button, is twisted round the end of the
dart, but in such a manner as to quit its hold as soon as that
weapon is thrown into the air. (See Plate XXXV.[MISSING])</p>
<p>I did not perceive amongst these islanders any confirmed
symptom of the venereal disease, although many of them had a
swelling of considerable size on the organs of generation, and
others had obstructions of the seminal glands.</p>
<p>The voracity of which the Caledonians had given us evident
proofs, prevented the General from giving them the he and she
goats as he had intended; they had, doubtless, devoured the hogs
and the two dogs, of which Captain Cook had made a present to one
of their chiefs. They scarcely took any care of their fowls; I
only saw three hens and one cock during our stay in the
island.</p>
<p>We did not perceive amongst them any of the articles given
them by Captain Cook. Perhaps these riches had been the cause of
the misfortunes of the inhabitants of this coast, by exciting
their neighbours to come and plunder them.</p>
<p>I remarked with astonishment that the authority of their
chiefs had always appeared very inconsiderable in our various
dealings with the savages; but I was not less surprised to find
that they exercised great power when their own private interest
was at stake, for they generally seized upon such articles as
their subjects had received from us.</p>
<p>While we were in New Caledonia we enjoyed a pretty serene
sky.</p>
<p>The winds varied from the north-east to the south, and the
strongest were the east and the south-east.</p>
<p>Our moorings were in lat. 20&deg; 17' 29" south, and 162&deg;
16' 28" east longitude.</p>
<p>The variation of the needle was 9&deg; 30' towards the
east.</p>
<p>The mercury in the barometer never rose above 28 inches lines
and 2-10ths, and never fell below 28 inches 1 line and
4-10ths.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the excessive heat which we felt on the coast,
the thermometer never exceeded 25&deg;, and on board never rose
above 21&deg;.</p>
<p>The tides were not observable above once a day, when we lay at
anchor. The flood took place at half past six, and the waters
rose in perpendicular height four feet seven inches.</p>
<p>We could not gather the least intelligence during our stay at
New Caledonia, concerning the fate of those unfortunate
navigators who were the object of our researches. It is not,
however, improbable, that this dangerous and almost inaccessible
coast proved fatal to them. We know that La P&eacute;rouse was to
have explored the western coast of it, and one is chilled with
horror in reflecting on the fate that would await those
unfortunate seamen, should a shipwreck have obliged them to seek
for refuge amongst the cannibals that inhabit it.</p>

<small>10th MAY.</small></p>
<p>EARLY in the morning we set sail from New Caledonia, but were
no sooner in the open sea than we were becalmed near a long range
of rocks, which we perceived to eastward, and against which the
sea broke in a tremendous manner; we however got clear of them,
favoured by a light breeze from the south-east; sailed by them in
a longitudinal direction on the 11th and, 12th, and on the 13th
descried beyond that chain to the west the island of Moulin, at
about 17 miles distance, and afterwards the Huon Islands.</p>
<p>Next day our vessel was on the point of being dashed to pieces
on the rocks with which these islands are surrounded, when at
day-break we perceived the danger of our situation. We
immediately tacked about and stood off from them, and discovered
before the evening that these rocks were connected with those
along which we had sailed the year before.</p>
<p>Soon after we steered for the island of Saint Croix, which,
early on the morning of the 20th, we perceived to the north-west,
at about twenty-two miles distance.</p>
<p>Next day, about four in the afternoon, being then three miles
distant from the shore, we perceived two natives coming towards
us in a canoe with an out-rigger. They kept at a great distance
till five other canoes had joined them, when they came nearer to
our ship. One only of these canoes carried three savages, the
others contained no more than two. They addressed their
conversation to us, and made signs for us to land upon their
island, but none of them would venture on board our ship,
notwithstanding repeated invitations to that effect. The boldest
of them did not come nearer than about fifty yards. They were
armed with bows and arrows, and their whole dress confined of
necklaces and bracelets, ornamented with shells.</p>
<p>As night approached, our sailors worked the ship to stand on
different tacks, when the savages left us and returned to the
coast, but several hours afterwards, notwithstanding the darkness
of the night, we were visited by another canoe, the savages in
which certainly thought that we understood their language, for
they spoke to us for a long time in a very low tone of voice,
but, not receiving any answer, they at length returned to their
island.</p>
<p>22d. At day-break we approached the coast, and soon perceived
twelve canoes making towards us. They hastened alongside of our
vessel, and the most of them were loaded with different kinds of
fruit, amongst which I remarked the bread-fruit, but of a smaller
size, and not so good in quality as what we had met with at the
Friendly Islands; it was not, however, of the wild sort, for it
only contained a very small quantity of seed.</p>
<p>We were not a little surprized to observe that those islanders
set very little value on the iron which we offered them, though
we could not doubt that they knew the use of it, for one of them
had a piece of a joiner's chissel with a wooden handle, of the
same kind as their stone hatchets; but when we showed them some
pieces of red cloth, their admiration, expressed by the words
<i>youli, youli</i>, gave us hopes of succeeding better with
these articles in bartering for their commodities than with our
hardware. In fact they consented to sell us some of their arms,
but probably fearing, lest we should turn them against
themselves, they took the precaution not to part with any of
their bows, and even to blunt the arrows which they sold us.</p>
<p>Soon after several of them gave us proofs of their dishonesty.
With a view to cheat us of our articles in bartering, they at
first offered a good equivalent, but insisted on having our goods
delivered to them before hand, which they kept, refusing to give
us any thing in return.</p>
<p>About eight o'clock in the morning, the General sent two boats
to sound a creek, which we perceived at about a mile distance to
the north-west. On a sudden we lost sight of them, and were under
some apprehensions respecting them, when, about noon they
appeared again at the mouth of the creek, which they had been to
reconnoitre. Several musket-shot fired from these boats gave us
to understand that they had been attacked by the savages. At the
report, the canoes which surrounded us made off with great
precipitation. Our boats were not long before they arrived, and
informed us that the opening which we had taken for a bay, was
the extremity of a channel, which separates the island of St.
Croix from that of New Jersey. This channel extends in length
N.E.&frac14;E. being at the utmost not three miles long, and its
greatest breadth does not exceed one mile. It was founded with
great accuracy, and a line of sixty-seven yards did not find the
bottom in any part of it, not even within an hundred yards of the
shore.</p>
<p>A great number of canoes had followed our boats, whilst large
parties of savages on the shore endeavoured to entice our people
to them, by shewing their cocoa-nuts, bananas, and several other
fruits; at length some of them swam off with those productions of
their island in exchange for such pieces of cloth of different
colours as were intended for them.</p>
<p>Our boats on their return, at the entrance into the channel,
and near a small village on the coast of New Jersey, were just
leaving those savages, when one of them was seen to stand up in
the middle of his canoe, and prepare to shoot an arrow at a man
belonging to the boat of the Esperance. Every one seized his
arms, but nevertheless the islander recommenced his signs of
hostility, whereupon one of our men presented his musket, but the
savage without being terrified with this menace, bent his bow
very deliberately and let fly an arrow, which struck one of the
rowers on the forehead, although at the distance of about eighty
yards. This attack was instantly returned by the discharge of a
musket and blunderbuss, the latter of which having sent a shower
of bullets into the canoe, from which the arrow had been
discharged, the three islanders who were in it immediately jumped
overboard. Soon after they returned to their canoe and paddled
hastily towards the shore, but a ball at length reaching the
aggressor, all three again jumped into the water, leaving their
canoe, with their bows and arrows, which fell into the hands of
our boat's crew.</p>
<p>All these canoes have out-riggers, and are constructed as
represented in Plate XLVI. Fig. 3. Their bows are placed upon the
platform, situated between the canoe and the out-rigger, and
formed of close wicker work. The body of the canoes is in general
fifteen feet long and six in width. It is of a single piece cut
out of the trunk of a tree, very light, and almost as soft as the
wood of the mapou. There is through the whole length an
excavation of five inches wide. Here the rowers sit with their
legs one before the other, and up to the calf in the hollow. They
are seated on the upper part, which is smooth. At each of the
extremities, which are formed like a heart, we observed two T's,
the one above the other, cut out, but not very deep, and
sometimes in relievo. The lower part of the canoe is very well
formed for moving through the water. The out-rigger is always on
the left of the rowers.</p>
<p>These islanders are accustomed to chew betel. They keep the
leaves of it with areca-nuts, in small bags made of matting, or
of the outer covering of the cocoa-nuts. The lime which they mix
with it is carried in bamboo canes, or in calebashes.</p>
<p>These people are, in general, of a deep olive colour, and the
expression of their countenances indicates an intimate connection
between them and the generality of the inhabitants of the
Moluccas; though we remarked some who had a very black skin,
thick lips, and large flat noses, and appeared to be of a very
different race; but all these had woolly hair and very large
foreheads. They are in general of a good stature, but their legs
and thighs are rather small, probably owing, in a great measure,
to their inactivity, and the length of time which they are
confined in their canoes.</p>
<p>Most of them had their noses and ears bored, and wore in them
rings made of tortoise-shell.</p>
<p>Almost all were tatooed, particularly on the back.</p>
<p>I remarked with surprise that the fashion of wearing their
hair white was very general among these savages, and formed a
striking contrast with the colour of their skin. Without doubt,
those <i>petits ma&icirc;tres</i> used lime for that purpose in
the same manner as I had observed amongst the inhabitants of the
Friendly Islands. They are in the habit of pulling up their hair
by the roots. Their notions of modesty have not taught these
people the use of clothes. They generally have their bellies tied
with a cord, which goes two or three times round them. Their
bracelets are formed of matted work, and ornamented with shells
that have been worn; these are fixed to different parts of the
arm, and even above the elbow.</p>
<p>The sailor, who had been wounded in the head by the arrow, did
not feel much pain from it; he might have had it dressed
immediately by the surgeon of the Recherche, but he chose rather
to wait till we should get on board the Esperance. No one would,
at that time, have supposed that so slight a wound would one day
prove mortal.</p>
<p>As soon as the boats were hoisted on board the vessels we
stood to the south-west, a quarter west, coasting the island of
St. Croix, at the distance of about three quarters of a mile, and
observed many of the savages call to, and invite us to land.
Several amongst them launched their canoes to come to us, but we
sailed too fast for them to overtake us.</p>
<p>We discovered some mountains, the highest of which were at
least three hundred yards perpendicular; they were all covered
with large trees, between which we perceived here and there very
white spots of ground, which appeared to be laid out in beds.</p>
<p>From thence, after having sailed along the coast about nine
miles, we found ourselves opposite to a large bay, which has,
without doubt, a good bottom, but it is exposed to the south-east
wind, which blew at that time.</p>
<p>We soon after perceived at a distance, to the south, several
canoes making towards the island of St. Croix; others were seen
at a still greater distance, apparently employed in fishing, in
shallow water; at the same time we descried to the south another
shoal very near us, and which extended far to the westward.</p>
<p>We had just discovered Volcano Island, when a great number of
canoes left Gracious Bay, and made towards us, and as we had very
little wind, they had sufficient time to come up with us. We
already counted seventy-four, which had stopped at the distance
of eight or nine hundred yards from the vessel, when the clouds,
which had gathered on the mountains, caused the savages, by whom
these perilous vessels were manned; to be apprehensive for their
safety if they remained longer at sea. They immediately paddled
towards the shore, but before they had reached it a violent
squall, accompanied with a heavy shower of rain, very much
impeded their progress.</p>
<p>We stood off and on all night. The General proposed to anchor
in Gracious Bay the next day.</p>
<p>Several fires were kindled on the coast, to which we were near
enough to distinguish the voices of the inhabitants, who seemed
to be calling to us. We fired several muskets, intending, to give
them an agreeable surprize, and immediately cries of admiration
were heard from different parts of the coast, but the most
profound silence succeeded to these demonstrations of joy,
although several other shot were fired.</p>
<p>23d. We did not perceive during the night; upon Volcano
Island, any indications that it still contained subterraneous
fire. This small island cannot contain a sufficient quantity of
combustible matter to supply, incessantly the volcanic fire,
which Captain Carteret had observed there twenty-six years
ago.</p>
<p>The south-east wind continued all that day, and even on the
next (24th), prevented us from entering the bay, near which a
great number of cottages were built under the shade of the cocoa
trees, that were planted along the beach.</p>
<p>The natives soon made their appearance on the shore, when the
General sent out two boats, following them with our vessels, so
as to cover them in case of an attack from the natives. The surf
was too great to admit of our landing, nevertheless several of
the natives swam to us, bringing cocoa-nuts in exchange for
pieces of red cloth, which they, preferred before every other
article we offered them. Some came in their canoes, and all of
them appeared very honest in bargaining with us, which was
perhaps owing to their having heard what had passed between us
and the inhabitants of the east side of the island. They,
however, offered us only the worst things they had; most of the
cocoa-nuts they brought were growing seedy. It was not till after
some time that they would sell us some bows and arrows, but
fearing lest we should turn these arms against themselves, they
took the precaution to carry the bows to one boat and the arrows
to another. The latter were not pointed. We observed, that by
means of a reddish gum, a small piece of bone or tortoise-shell;
about half an inch long and well sharpened, was fixed to the end
of them; others were pointed with the same sort of materials from
ten to twelve inches long; but many were armed with the bone
which is found next the tail in that species of ray called
<i>raia pastinaca</i>.</p>
<p>We observed several hogs on shore, which they would not bring
to us at any price, but promised to sell them if we would come
ashore.</p>
<p>I remarked in their possession a necklace of glass beads, some
green and others red, which appeared to me to be of English
manufacture, and which they agreed to exchange.</p>
<p>We bought from these inhabitants a piece of cloth, which gave
us no very favourable idea of their industry; it was composed of
coarse bark of trees, and very indifferently joined together.</p>
<p>One of them wore, suspended upon his breast, a small flat
circular piece of alabaster, which he parted with to satisfy
us.</p>
<p>This interview had lasted nearly two hours, when, at a signal
from one of their chiefs, all the savages left us; but, when they
saw our boats preparing to leave the shore, the women came close
to the water's edge to endeavour to persuade us to land; we,
however, continued ready to our purpose, in a short time got on
board the vessels, and soon after set sail for the Islands of
Arsacides.</p>
<p>On the 26th, about ten A.M. we perceived the Islands of
Deliverance to the westward. At noon we discovered the
southernmost of them, between W. 13&deg; S. and W. 19&deg; S.
distant about twelve miles, and the other bearing W. 27&deg; S.
We found, by observation, that our vessel was in 10&deg; 48' S.
lat. and 160&deg; 18' E. long. Almost the whole circumference of
these two small islands is very rugged, but they do not lie very
high. We perceived inhabitants upon them, and large plantations
of cocoa trees.</p>
<p>We then crowded sail for the Arsacides, the lofty mountains of
which we saw to the west-south-west.</p>
<p>27th. We coasted along it this day. About ten A.M. we had just
passed a shoal near two miles in breadth, when, through the
negligence of the watch, the ship went over another shoal, where,
however, there was fortunately sufficient water to prevent her
receiving any injury.</p>
<p>At noon we were in lat. 10&deg; 54' south, and long. 159&deg;
41' east, when the land of the Arsacides bore from east 21&deg;
north, to west 23&deg; north; we were then about three miles to
the south of the nearest shore. These coasts were indented,
having small hills projecting into the sea, forming a number of
little bays, which afforded shelter from the east wind. Most of
these small capes are each terminated by a pyramidal rock of
considerable height, crowned with a tuft of very green bushes.
Farther in the interior of the country we saw the same kind of
small hills standing on mountains of a moderate height, which
exhibited a very picturesque appearance.</p>
<p>It was generally at the extremity of the small creeks that the
inhabitants fixed their residence. Many of them had come upon the
beach to enjoy the novel spectacle which our vessels presented to
them. Their cottages were built under the shade of numerous
plantations of cocoa trees.</p>
<p>We had not yet seen any canoes on that coast, when, about four
in the afternoon, one came towards us. We were much astonished
that the islanders who were in it durst venture out on a sea
greatly agitated in so frail a vessel, the width of which was not
any where more than two feet, and they sat in the deepest part in
order to preserve a proper equilibrium. (See Plate XLIV.)</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE XLIV. <i>Canoe of the Arsacides</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>After having approached to about two hundred and fifty yards
of our frigate, they addressed a few words to us in a very
elevated tone of voice, pointing to their island, and inviting us
to go on shore. They then came hill nearer, but a violent gust of
wind compelled them to return to the shore.</p>
<p>These islanders had not more clothing than the inhabitants of
the island of St. Croix, to whom they bear great resemblance.</p>
<p>28th. This morning at day-break we perceived that the current
had driven us 18' east during the night. Our surprise at this was
the greater, as the easterly wind, which prevailed at this time,
should have counteracted, the force of the currents. Can the
tides occasion this singular direction of the currents in these
latitudes?</p>
<p>About ten in the morning four canoes came off the shore and
advanced to within about four hundred yards of our ship, but we
could not wait for their nearer approach, as we were obliged to
continue our course to double a cape, which would have
interrupted some nautical observations we intended to make.</p>
<p>At noon we were in 10&deg; 33' S. lat. and 158&deg; 57' E.
long. and we saw the sea breaking with great violence against
Cape Philip, which is a very rugged point. We doubled it about
four P.M., and soon after perceived a large bay, the shores of
which appeared to be very populous. We saw several sheds under
which the inhabitants had put their canoes to shelter them from
the weather, and observed cottages in every part even to the
summits of the highest mountains.</p>
<p>Soon after the savages launched five canoes, and sailed
towards us. They all kept within call except one man, who,
mounted in a catimarron canoe, came much nearer the stern of our
vessel, to receive some pieces of red cloth which we had thrown
into the sea. His behaviour indicated the greatest mistrust. He
kept his eyes fixed on us, none of our motions escaped him, and
at the same time he had the dexterity to catch every article that
we threw him. The appearance of this native, seated upon a few
planks, beat about by the waves, amused us for some seconds. Our
musician wanted to entertain those islanders with some tunes on
the violin, but just as he was tuning his instrument, they went
off towards the Esperance.</p>
<p>Soon after five other canoes came along side our vessel,
testifying the greater confidence in us. The natives by which
they were manned were certainly acquainted with the use of iron,
for they expressed great joy upon receiving some nails which we
offered them. We could not learn whether these people are used to
barter their commodities; at least we were not able to obtain any
thing from them by this mode of traffic, although they had
javelins, tomahawks, bows and arrows. They were, however, very
willing to accept of any thing that we offered them by way of
present, and made us very obliging proposals if we would land
upon their coasts; whilst, with their natural gaiety of manner,
they frequently repeated the word <i>sousou</i> (the bosom),
accompanying their discourse with very significant gestures,
which produced great merriment among our sailors.</p>
<p>At sun-set the savages returned on shore and kindled three
large fires.</p>
<p>29th. The currents had carried us during the night into a
large channel which runs along this easterly island of the
Arsacides; formerly called the Island of St. Christopher, and
belonging to the archipelago of Solomon, discovered by Mendana.
It now bore north, and soon after we descried the Isle des
Contrari&eacute;t&eacute;s, which about noon bore E. 14&deg; N.
to E. 30&deg; N. at a distance of 5,130. toises, we being in
9&deg; 53' S. lat. 159&deg; 8' E. long. This small island is
rather mountainous and very woody.</p>
<p>We soon coasted along the small islands called the Three
Sisters, after which we plied to windward, in, order to get to
the southward, so as to pass the strait which separates the
island called by Mendana Guadal-canal from that of St.
Christopher.</p>
<p>About eight in the evening the Esperance came near enough to
us to acquaint us, by the speaking-trumpet, of a piece of
treachery which had been practised upon her crew by the
islanders. She had been surrounded, during the preceding night,
by a great number of canoes, from which only two of the natives
came on board. These savages commended, in very high terms, the
fruits of their island, and promised to give a great quantity of
them to our men, is they would come on shore; at length they
departed about midnight; but amongst the number of canoes which
remained near the Esperance, one was observed much larger than
the rest, which, about break of day, rowed several times round
the vessel, and suddenly stopping, at least twelve arrows were
discharged from it, one of which wounded one of the crew (Desert)
in the arm the greater part of the rest, fortunately, sticking in
the sides of the ship. After making this perfidious attack, they
immediately fled with precipitation, and were already at a
considerable distance before a musket was fired at them; none of
them were wounded but a rocket, which was discharged with a very
good aim, and burst quite close to the canoe, terrified them
exceedingly.</p>
<p>The other canoes had likewise fled at first, but they soon
returned to the vessel.</p>
<p>This act of treachery, and the perfidious conduct of the same
savages to Captain Surville, gave us reason to believe that they
had been actuated by the same motives, when they used their
utmost endeavours to persuade us to land upon their island.</p>
<p>30th. Being scarcely able to govern our vessel, on account of
the slightness of the breeze, which blew by intervals from N.W.
and W.N.W., we were very perceptibly carried by the currents
towards the Isle des Contrari&eacute;t&eacute;s. As the sky was
very clear, we had a good view of the island, of which the
engraving published by Surville affords a pretty exact
representation. We were at the distance of 1,500 toises, when a
canoe rowed from the shore, and came alongside of our vessel. It
was manned by four of the natives, who were very thankful for the
presents of stuffs and hardware which we made them, and
immediately gave us in return some cocoa-nuts, which, like most
of the natives of the South Seas, they call <i>uiou</i>.</p>
<p>They appeared highly pleased with the nails which we gave
them; and continually begged for more, frequently repeating the
word <i>mat&eacute;</i> (death), and endeavouring to intimate to
us by their gestures, that they intended to employ them against
their enemies. Eight other canoes soon joined the first, and
approached our vessel without shewing any signs of fear. We
admired the elegant form of their canoes, which were exactly
similar to those we had seen the preceding days at the easterly
part of the Arsacides. (See Plate XLIV). They were about
twenty-one feet in length, two in breadth, and fifteen inches in
depth. The bottom consisted of a single piece cut from the trunk
of a tree, and the sides were formed of a plank, the whole length
of the boat, supported by beams fired at equal distances into the
bottom; at both ends other planks were attached to the first.
These were ornamented on the outside with figures of birds,
fishes, &amp;c., rudely carved. The greater part of the canoes
were terminated in front with the head of a bird, under which was
seen a large bunch of fringe, coloured with a red dye, which
appeared to me to have been made of the leaves of the vacoua. The
other extremity of the boat was likewise ornamented with red
fringe, and here we frequently observed, in the inner side, the
carving of a dog projecting from the vessel, which led me to
suppose that the savages possess this animal. I was surprised to
observe that they had given it nearly the form of a blood-hound;
though it is probable they do not possess that species, but that
the carving was nothing more than an imperfect representation of
the dog usually met with in the South Sea Islands.</p>
<p>The savages were obliged to remain constantly at the bottom of
their canoes, in order to prevent their being overset by the
waves, and, what rendered their situation still more
incommodious, they had to sit in the water which was thrown in by
the surge. They, however, took care to bale it out from time to
time.</p>
<p>Amongst the commodities which were obtained from them, was a
long fishing line attached to the extremity of a large rod, which
appeared to me somewhat remarkable, as the greater part of the
savages we had hitherto seen, were in the practice of holding
their fishing lines in their hands. The hook was made of
tortoise-shell.</p>
<p>Some of these natives wore as ornaments, bracelets made of
various kinds of shells; others had them of the rind of the
cocoa-nut, bespangled throughout their whole circumference with a
great number of coloured seeds.</p>
<p>It does not appear that they chew betel; at least I never
perceived any signs of their doing it.</p>
<p>After these boats had remained several hours about our vessel,
one of their chiefs gave them the signal for departing, upon
which they immediately rowed towards the coast with great speed.
One of the boats, however remained a few moments, to receive some
pieces of red cloth which we were about to present to the natives
at the instant when the signal was given but as soon as these
islanders saw that their companions had left them behind, they
plied their oars with all the speed they were able, in order to
overtake them. We were amazed to see their canoe skim the waves
with such rapidity, that it must have run at the rate of at least
7,500 toises an hour.</p>
<p>JUNE 1st. Early in the morning we began to range along the
southern coast of Guadal-canal, which descends with a very gentle
declivity to the sea, and observed in the interior part of the
island a long chain of very high mountains, running in the same
direction. We soon distinguished the Mount Lama of Shortland. The
coast was bordered with cocoa trees, under the tirade of which we
observed a great number of huts. The low grounds rendered a large
extent of this coast inaccessible to our vessels, and we were
much incommoded by the currents which carried us to eastward.
This unexpected direction of the currents surprised us the more,
as the winds that had prevailed during our stay in these parts
might have been expelled to direct their course to the
westward.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 4th, we doubled Cape Hunter, discovered
by Shortland. About ten o'clock we passed quite close to a small
island connected by some reefs to the coast, where we saw several
groups of the savages seated under the shade of fine plantations
of cocoas, and bananas, which give this island a very picturesque
appearance. A great number of canoes lay upon the beach, and we
expected that the natives would put to sea with some of them to
come to our vessels but their indifference astonished us; not one
of them moved from his place, nor even rose from his sitting
posture in order to have a better view of our ships.</p>
<p>This small island is situated in 9&deg; 31' S. lat. 157&deg;
19' E. long.</p>
<p>We soon came in sight of the westernmost point of
Guadal-canal.</p>
<p>On the 7th, about noon, we descried the largest of Hammond's
islands, N. 4&deg; W. to E. 6&deg; N. at the distance of 5,130
toises, we being in 8&deg; 49' S. lat. 155&deg; 9' E. long. We
now left this archipelago, and made sail for the northern coast
of Louisiade.</p>
<p>The survey which we had taken of the Arsacides, left us no
room to doubt of their being the archipelago of Solomon,
discovered by Mendana as had been supposed upon the same grounds
by Citizen Fleurieu, in his excellent work upon the discoveries
of the French.</p>
<p>On the 9th, the Esperance informed us of the death of an
unfortunate man of her crew (Mahol), who had been wounded in the
forehead, seventeen days before, by an arrow from one of the
savages of the island Sainte Croix. The wound, however, had
cicatrized very well, and, for fourteen days, the man had felt no
troublesome symptom whatever; when he was suddenly attacked with
a violent tetanas, under which he expired in three days time.</p>
<p>Many of our company supposed that the arrow with which he was
wounded had been poisoned; but this conjecture appears to me
improbable, as the wound cicatrized, and the man remained
fourteen days in good health. Besides, we found that the arrows,
left in the canoe by the savages, and afterwards taken
possession, of by our sailors, were not poisoned; for several
birds that we pricked with them experienced no troublesome
consequences from the puncture; but it is a common occurrence in
hot climates, that the slightest puncture is followed by a
general spasmodic affection, which almost always terminates
fatally.</p>
<p>On the 12th, about ten in the morning, we descried the coats
of Louisiade, and at first mistook the most easterly extremity
for Cape Deliverance, but soon discovered that to be 25' farther
north.</p>
<p>We were astonished to find that the rapidity of the currents
had been so great as to carry us 44' to the northward in the
space of twenty-four hours. The observations made on board the
Esperance gave the same result.</p>
<p>We now steered west, coasting along pretty highlands, from
which, however, we were obliged to keep at a considerable
distance, on account of the great number of shoals which extended
very far into the sea, and rendered our navigation extremely
dangerous.</p>
<p>On the 14th, at day-break, we found ourselves surrounded with
rocks, and shoals, amongst which we had been carried during the
night by the currents from W.N.W. In vain we plied to windward
with a very good south-east breeze, with a. view of extricating
ourselves from this dangerous situation; the currents always
prevented us from getting beyond a small island situated to the
north-east, at the distance of 2,500 toises, near which there
appeared to be a passage into the open sea. We were then in
10&deg; 58' S. lat. 151&deg; 18' E. long. Our room for beating
became more confined, and our situation the more hazardous, in
proportion as we were carried farther to the westward; besides,
we found no bottom, so that we were at length obliged to resolve
venturing among the shoals to the N.W. in hopes of finding there
a passage for our vessels; but this resolution was not taken till
late in the evening. It was already night when we found ourselves
becalmed in a narrow channel, and at the mercy of a rapid
current, which might every moment prove our destruction, by
driving us upon the rocks with which we were surrounded. However,
at break of day we had the satisfaction of finding ourselves in
the open sea, extricated from all our dangers. Our situation had
undoubtedly been a very hazardous one; but since we had already
traversed seas full of shoals, we were become so accustomed to
danger, that myself, as well as several others of our company,
went to bed at our usual hour, and slept as soundly as if we had
been in a state of the most perfect security.</p>
<p>17th. The coasts, along which we had hitherto ranged to the
northward of the islands, were intercepted by a great number of
channels. We had seen may habitations in this numerous
collection, of islands, but not one of the natives. On the 29th,
being in latitude 10&deg; 8' S. long. 149&deg; 37' east, and
sailing at a small distance northward of a clutter of small
islands, we observed fifteen of the natives coming out of their
huts. Three of them immediately entered a canoe, and made towards
us, but we sailed so fast, that they were not able to come up
with our vessels.</p>
<p>Another canoe soon appeared near the westernmost island of the
group; it was much larger than the former, and carried an almost
square sail, which being immediately loosed, it soon came very
near to us, but all our endeavours to persuade the men to come
alongside of our vessel were in vain. They afterwards made
towards the Esperance, and having approached within a small
distance of her, drew in their sail, and would not come nearer;
our vessels were then lying to, Citizen Legrand, being very
desirous of an interview with the natives, threw himself into the
sea, and soon swam up to the canoe. We were informed in the
evening that this officer had not seen any arms amongst them;
and, that though they were twelve in number, they had shewed some
signs of fear when they saw him approach them.</p>
<p>It appears that they are unacquainted with the use of iron, as
they seemed to set little value upon that which he presented to
them.</p>
<p>These islanders were of a black colour, not very deep, and
stark naked. Their woolly hair was ornamented with tufts of
feathers, and they wore cords bound several times round the
circumference of their bodies, undoubtedly intended to afford a
support to the muscles of the belly. Many of them wore bracelets
made of the rind of the cocoa tree.</p>
<p>We admired their dexterity in steering near the wind when they
returned to the shore.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, two canoes with out-riggers and
sails, each manned by twelve savages, sailed swiftly round our
vessel, watching us with great attention, but at a considerable
distance. They afterwards kept for a long time to windward of us.
We were then in 9&deg; 53' S. lat. 149&deg; 10' E. long. There
was every appearance of great population on the southern coast,
and especially towards the farther end of a large bay that
extends to S.S.W. We soon perceived several canoes rowing towards
us each manned by ten or eleven natives, who kept at the distance
of about a hundred yards from our vessel, till some pieces of
cloth, which he threw into the sea for them, induced them to
approach nearer. They appeared much surprized at seeing a young
black on board of our vessel, whom we had brought with us from
Amboyna. They did not understand him when he addressed them in
the Malay language. These savages had all woolly hair and
olive-coloured skins; I observed, however, one amongst them who
was as black, as the negroes of Mozambique, and resembled them
also in other particulars. His lower lip, as is the case with
them, projected considerably beyond the upper. All these
islanders used betel; and they were all stark naked. They wore
bracelets ornamented with shells. Many of them had a small piece
of bone passed through the partition between the nostrils; others
wore a string of shells like a scarf over their shoulders.</p>
<p>They presented to us roots baked in the ashes, and carefully
peeled. We observed no other weapons amongst them than short
javelins, pointed only at one end.</p>
<p>Their huts were supported six or eight feet above the ground
upon stakes, like those of the Papous.</p>
<p>These savages wished us to land upon their island, but
observing that we receded farther from it, in consequence of the
currents which carried us to the westward, they left us and
returned to their coasts.</p>
<p>Two of the canoes were still quite close to the Esperance at
half after three o'clock, when we observed three muskets fired
from that vessel, upon which the savages sled, rowing with all
their might. We soon learnt that the men in one of the canoes had
thrown stones at the crew of the ship without the least
provocation having been given. None of the sailors, however, had
been wounded by this act of treachery; and the muskets had been
fired only to terrify them.</p>
<p>Soon after two boats were dispatched in order to sound several
creeks along the coast, where we hoped to find good
anchorage.&mdash;We found ourselves disappointed; as it was
necessary to approach within a hundred yards of the coast, before
the bottom could be reached with a line of seventy yards; and at
the distance of two hundred yards we could not strike the ground
with a line of less than a hundred and sixteen.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fright which the muskets fired at their
companions might have given them; some of the natives came
alongside of our vessel from the very place to which the others
had made their escape. They shewed themselves very, fraudulent in
their dealings with us, bargaining at any price for the
commodities which we had to barter with them, and as soon as they
had got them in their possession, refuting to give us any thing
in return. One of them, however, consented to give up to us a
flute and a necklace, which are represented in Plate XXXVIII.
Fig. 26 and 27.</p>
<p>I observed one of the natives who wore, suspended from his
neck by a thin cord, a part of a human bone, cut from about the
middle of the cubitus. Whether this might be a trophy of some
victory gained over an enemy, and those natives belong to the
class of the cannibals, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>Many of them had their faces smeared over with the powder of
charcoal.</p>
<p>They generally cover their natural parts with large leaves of
vacoua, passing between their thighs, and fastened to the girdle
before and behind by a very tight ligature.</p>
<p>They had with them some pretty large fishing nets, to the
lower end of which they had fastened various sorts of shells;
some of these shells they carried in small cylindrical baskets,
furnished in the inside with cords seemingly intended to prevent
their breaking.</p>
<p>They used combs with three diverging teeth, some made of
bamboo, others of tortoise-shell.</p>
<p>The savages left us at the close of the evening, and we plied
to windward during the whole night.</p>
<p>We had scarcely advanced more than 10,000 toises to the N.E.
since the preceding evening, when we found ourselves surrounded
with low islands connected by shoals, amongst which we were
obliged to beat even during the night. We several times passed
over flats, which we could distinguish by the dim light of the
moon, and often found ourselves in less than ten fathoms
water.</p>
<p>A calm coming on about midnight, left us at the mercy of the
current, which carried us towards the coast where the savages had
lighted several fires.</p>
<p>At break of day we perceived the Esperance at a great distance
from us, and much nearer to the land than our vessel, so that she
was obliged to be towed by the boats.</p>
<p>The savages soon came in great numbers along-side of our
vessel, but were not to be prevailed upon to come on board. An
old man, who had already left his canoe in order to comply with
our invitation, was prevented by the rest, who eagerly pulled him
back to them, as if they imagined him to be about to expose
himself to some great danger.</p>
<p>We thought that we recognized amongst these islanders some of
those whom we had seen on the two preceding days. They were very
curious to know the names of the things we gave them; but what
surprised us very much was, that they enquired with the terms
<i>poe nama</i>, which very much resemble the Malayan words
<i>apa nama</i>, signifying "what is the name of this?" They
however, understood none of the men in our ships, who addressed
them in the Malay language.</p>
<p>These savages brought with them a sort of pudding, which we
found to consist partly of roots and the flesh of lobsters. They
offered us some of it, and those of us who ate of it, found it
very well tasted.</p>
<p>Most of these islanders made use of a human cubitus, scooped
out at the extremity, for drawing the pieces of chalk which they
mixed with their betel, from the bottom of a calabash.</p>
<p>They sold us an axe shaped like that represented in Plate XII.
Fig. 9; it was made of serpentine alone, very well polished, and
hafted with a single piece of wood. The edge of the axe was in
the direction of the length of the handle, as in ours.</p>
<p>These islanders are very fond of perfumes; most of the things
we got from them, were scented. They had pieces of the bark of
different aromatic trees, one of which seemed to me to belong to
the species of laurel, known by the name of <i>laurus
culilabau</i>, which is very common among the Molucca
islands.</p>
<p>The calm still continued, and about one o'clock the Commander
sent the barge to assist in towing the Esperance, as the crew
might be supposed already much fatigued with their labour. At
length, about half an hour after four a breeze sprung up from the
south-east, which enabled her to get clear of the shoals. The
barge soon returned to our vessel, when we were informed that the
Esperance had been surrounded for a long time by a great number
of the savages; that about noon they had pointed out to the crew
two canoes rowing from two small islands to meet each other, and
given them to understand that the islanders in the boats were
going to fight a battle, and that these who came off conquerors
intended to devour their enemies. During this recital, a
ferocious expression of pleasure was visible in their
countenances, as if they were to partake of this horrible
banquet. After this communication, almost all those among our
crew who had eaten of the pudding, which the savages brought them
in the morning, were seized with retchings, from the apprehension
that this food, which seemed to be so highly grateful to the
islanders, was partly composed of human flesh.</p>
<p>The two canoes were soon near enough together to commence the
engagement. The combatants were seen mounted upon a platform of
wood, supported by the out-rigger, and the canoe, from whence
they threw stones with their slings; each of them wearing a
buckler upon his left arm; with which he endeavoured to ward off
the stones thrown by his adversary. They, however, separated
after a fight of half a quarter of an hour, in which none of them
appeared to have been dangerously wounded, and returned to the
shore.</p>
<p>The captain of the Esperance sent to the Commander a tomahawk
and a buckler which he had obtained from these savages.</p>
<p>The tomahawk was very broad, and flat at one of its
extremities. The buckler was the first defensive weapon which we
had observed among the savage nations we had hitherto visited. It
was made of very hard wood, and of the form represented in Plate
XII, Fig. 7 and 8. It was nearly three feet in length, a foot and
a quarter in breadth, and upwards of half an inch in thickness.
The outer side was slightly convex. About the middle of Fig. 8,
which represents the inner-side of the buckler, three small
pieces of cane are visible, by which the islanders fix it to the
left arm.</p>
<p>Though the natives had been in great numbers about the
Esperance, they had attempted no act of hostility, except that
one of them appeared to be preparing to throw a javelin at one of
the crew who was upon the wale, but seeing himself observed, he
desisted from his design, and the canoe in which he was rowed
away from the vessel with precipitation.</p>
<p>On the following days we sailed by some very low small
islands, beyond which we saw very high lands to the southward.
The prodigious numbers of flats which we continually encountered,
prevented us from ranging nearer to the coast.</p>
<p>On the 25th, being in 8&deg; 7 south latitude, 146&deg; 39'
east longitude, we saw the high grounds of New Guinea extending
from south-west to northwest. After having followed them in their
direction to north-west, we arrived on the 27th at a deep gulph,
about 40,000 toises in extent, and, surrounded by very high
mountains, the loftiest of which are on the north side, where
they unite with that which forms the Cape of King William. The
calm detained us here till the 29th, when we sailed for the
straits of Dampier.</p>
<p>On the 30th, at break of day, we discovered to the N.W.W. a
very high mountain furrowed near its summits by longitudinal
excavations of a great depth. This was the Cape of King William.
We afterwards observed the western coast of New Britain, for
which we steered under full sail, in order to get before night to
the northward of the straits of Dampier. The sun being in our
face, the man at the mast-head could not perceive timely enough a
flat over which we passed about eight in the morning, the surge
running very high. After getting clear of this, we thought
ourselves out of all danger; but about three quarters of an hour
after, we found ourselves between two shoals very near to each,
other, which inclosed us in such a manner, that it was impossible
to pass through with the south-south-east wind, which drove us
farther and farther in. The Commander gave orders immediately to
put about; but there was not time sufficient to perform this
manoeuvre, before our vessel drove towards the shoals to the
northward, where we expected the would soon be wrecked, when
Citizen Gicquel cried from the mast-head that he saw a passage
between the rocks which, though very narrow, was yet wide enough
for our vessel to sail through. We immediately steered for this
passage, and were at length extricated from one of the most
hazardous situations which we experienced during the whole course
of our expedition. We were, however, not yet out of all danger,
being still surrounded for some time by other shoals, which
obliged us several times to change our direction; but we were at
length fortunate enough to find a passage through the narrow
straits by which they were separated from each other.</p>
<p>About noon we were already very far up the strait, our
latitude being 5&deg; 38' south, longitude 146&deg; 24' east.</p>
<p>The coast of New Britain bore from east 37&deg; south, to east
61&deg; north, we being at the distance of 2,500 toises from the
land.</p>
<p>The island on which Dampier discovered a volcano bore west
38&deg; north, at the distance of 7,600 toises. This volcano was
then extinguished; but we saw, at the distance of 5,130 toises,
west 28&deg; north, a small island of a conical form, which was
not observed by Dampier to exhibit any signs of subterraneous
fire. A thick smoke proceeded at intervals from the summit of the
mountain; and about half an hour after three, a great quantity of
burning substances were thrown out of the aperture of the
volcano, which lighting upon the eastern declivity of the
mountain, rolled down the sides till they fell into the sea,
where they immediately produced an ebullition in the water, and
raised it into vapours of a shining white colour. At the moment
of the eruption, a thick, smoke, tinged with different hues, but
principally of a copper colour, was thrown out with such
violence, as to ascend above the highest clouds.</p>
<p>We saw a great number of inhabitants along the coast of New
Britain, and several huts raised upon stones, after the manner of
the Papous.</p>
<p>We left the strait before close of evening.</p>
<p>We now ranged along the northern coast of New Britain, where
we discovered several small islands, very mountainous, and
hitherto unknown. The currents in this passage were scarcely
perceptible, except under the meridian of Port Montague, where
they carried us rapidly to the northward, which led us to suppose
that we were opposite a channel that divides the lands of
New-Britain. We left this coast on the 9th July, after having
been impeded in our survey of it by the winds from the
south-east, and the frequent calms.</p>
<p>We had been obliged for a long time to live upon worm-eaten
biscuit and salt-meat, which was already considerably tainted, in
consequence of which, the scurvy had begun to make great ravages
amongst us. The greater part of us found ourselves compelled to
leave off the use of coffee, as it occasioned very troublesome
spasmodic affections.</p>
<p>On the 11th we steered very near the Portland Islands.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 12th we espied the most easterly of
the Admiralty Isles.</p>
<p>On the 18th, about sun-set, we discovered the Anchorites S.W.
by W.</p>
<p>About seven o'clock in the evening of the 21st, we lost our
Commander Dentrecasteaux; he sunk under the violence of a cholic
which had attacked him two days before. For some time he had
experienced a few slight symptoms of the scurvy, but we were far
from imagining ourselves threatened with so heavy a loss.</p>
<p>AUGUST 2d. we descried the Traitors Islands, and about noon we
saw them at the distance of 20,000 toises, from S. 35&deg; W. to
S 42&deg; W., we being in 6' S. lat. 134&deg; 3' E. long.</p>
<p>On the 8th our baker died of the scurvy, his whole body having
been previously affected with an emphysema, which had encreased
with astonishing rapidity, in consequence of the heats of the
Equator.</p>
<p>On the 11th we doubled the Cape of Good Hope of New Guinea,
and on the 16th cast anchor at Waygiou.</p>

<br></p>
<p>DURING our stay at Waygiou we were frequently visited by the
natives, who brought us turtles, several of which weighed from
200 to 240 pounds. They had mostly been taken on the islands of
Aiou. The soup which we made of them afforded great relief to our
scorbutic patients. When the natives perceived, that we were in
need of them, they made us pay for them at ten tithes their
value. These animals continued to crawl about several hours after
their heads had been cut off. The natives sold us likewise,
turtle eggs roasted and dried, broiled turtle flesh, pullets,
hogs, of which they told us there was great abundance in their
woods; oranges, cocoa-nuts, papayas, gourds of different kinds,
rice, purslain (<i>portulaca guadrifida</i>), sugar canes,
pimento; unripe ears of Turkey corn roasted, and the fresh
sprouts of the papaya tree. They told us that the sprouts and
unripe fruit of this tree were very good eating when boiled. They
brought us also sago, made into a sort of flat cakes, three
inches broad and six long, which they ate without any farther
preparation. Some of them brought us sago made into a sourish
tasted paste, after having undergone fermentation.</p>
<p>Most of these islanders were naked all but their natural
parts, which they cover with a coarse stuff, apparently made of
the bark of the fig tree. The heat of the climate renders all
other cloathing unnecessary. Only their chiefs wear very wide
trowsers and jackets, made of stuffs which they buy from the
Chinese, who, as they told us, came from time to time to anchor
where we were. Some of them wore also bracelets of silver, which
they had likewise bought of the Chinese. Almost all the chiefs of
these savages had been at the Molucca Islands, and spoke the
Malay language. Some wore hats made of the leaves of
<i>vacoua</i>, of a conical form, and very like to those of the
Chinese. Others had their heads bound round with a sort of
turban. They have all curled hair, which grows very thick, and to
a considerable length. The colour of their skins is not very
black. Some suffer the beard on the upper lip to grow, and have
their ears and the division of the nose bored. Several of them
shewed us their dexterity in shooting with the how at a mark
placed at the distance of more than forty paces; and their arrows
always came very near their aim. Others were armed with very long
lances, pointed, with iron or bone. These islanders undoubtedly
know how to forge the iron, as they set great value upon some
bars of this metal, which we gave them. Tin was likewise in great
requests with them. But of all our commodities they gave a
decided preference to cloth, particularly such as was of a red
colour.</p>
<p>The island Waygiou, called by the inhabitants Ouarido, is
covered with large trees, and throughout mountainous, even at a
very small distance from the coast. The huts were built of
bamboo, raised upon stakes, about three yards above the ground,
and covered with reeds.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that as soon as we had landed, those of our
crew who were the least affected with the scurvy, or even shewed
no symptoms at all of that disorder, became affected with a
considerable degree of swelling all over the body; but this
symptom, which had very much alarmed some of us, disappeared
entirely after walking three or four hours.</p>
<p>During our stay in this island I made very frequent excursions
into the forests, where I collected a great number of new plants,
and killed a variety of rare birds, amongst which was that
species of the promerops which Buffon calls the promerops of New
Guinea; also a large <i>psitaccus aterrimus</i>, and a new
species of calao, to which I gave the name of the calao of the
island Waygiou. Its beak is bent, of a dirty white colour, and
about six inches in length. Each mandible is unequally notched,
and the superior is surmounted by a hood of a yellow colour, flat
at the top and ridged. The wings and body are black, the tail
white, and the neck of a lively red. (See Plate XI.) This
beautiful bird is two feet in length, from the tip of the beak to
the extremity of the feet.</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE XI. <i>Calao of the Island of Waygiou</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>I saw several wild cocks in the woods. The female of this
species, which was brought us by the natives, was scarcely larger
than a partridge, and yet its eggs were as large again as those
of our domestic hen. This wild species of the dung-hill-cock is
black, that which I had found in the forests of Java was
grey.</p>
<p>The crowned pheasant of India (<i>columba coronata</i>) is
very common in these thick forests, where we found here and there
wild orange trees; the fruit of which furnished our scorbutic
patients with a very wholesome sort of lemonade.</p>
<p>The natives told us, that the road-stead where our vessels
rode at anchor was infested by alligators; but this did not deter
several of our sailors from bathing in it. We afterwards found
some of the prints of their feet in the woods. It is particularly
during the night-time that these animals are most to be
feared.</p>
<p>Whilst we lay at anchor we were visited by several of the
chiefs. The chief of Ravak supped and slept on board the
Esperance the night before our departure; but as soon as he saw
preparations for weighing anchor, he threw himself into the sea,
from, the apprehension that we were going to carry him away with
us. We should have been surprised at his harbouring such a
suspicion, if we had not been informed, that five months before
the Dutch had carried off his brother, during an entertainment
which they had made for him on board of their vessel. This chief
wore trowsers, with a very wide Indian cloak, and a waistcoat of
satin. His ear-rings were of gold.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this island had declared war against the
Dutch, and the greater part of them, with the most powerful of
the chiefs, to whom they give the title of Sultan, at their head,
were gone to unite with the inhabitants of Ceram, in order to
attack the Governor of Amboyna, who was expected there on his
visit to the Molucca Islands. The inhabitants of the huts built
on the coast near our anchoring station, had provided for the
safety of their women and children, by conducting them, before
their departure from the island, into the villages in the heart
of the country. The road-stead where our vessels lay is called by
the natives Boni-Sain&eacute;. It is distant about 5,130 toises
to the eastward of Ravak, and formed by the coast of Waygiou and
a small island called by the natives Boni, which was eastward of
our station. We were here almost under the Equator, our latitude
being found by observation 38" S. Our longitude was 128&deg; 53'
E.</p>
<p>We took in our water towards the extremity of the road-stead,
at a pretty large river, into which our boats could enter more
than 500 toises from its mouth at low water, and twice as far at
high water.</p>
<p>The thermometer, as observed on board, did not rise higher
than 24&deg;, undoubtedly in consequence of the abundant
rains.</p>
<p>The barometer varied only from 28 inches 1 line to 28 inches
1&frac12; line.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle was 1&deg; 14' E.</p>
<p>The breezes were very slight, and varied only from S.S.E. to
S.W.</p>
<p>On the 28th we sailed from Waygiou, and ranged along its
northern coast, standing to the west, in order to weather the
westerly point. We here met with a flat which is not indicated
upon the charts, where the soundings gave us a depth of from four
to eight, fathoms, within a space of about 300 toises in length,
which we were obliged to cross. We observed in different places,
rocks almost even with the water's edge, but were fortunate
enough to keep clear of them. The greatest length of this flat is
about 1,000 toises from north to south.</p>
<p>On the 4th of SEPTEMBER we cast anchor in the road-stead of
Bourou, at the distance of 1,000 toises from the Dutch
settlement, in a depth of 20 fathoms, over a bottom of sand and
mud. The Commander of this station immediately sent a corporal to
us, to offer us a supply of whatever fresh provisions we might
have occasion for. A few minutes after we, observed some muskets
fired amongst a herd of buffaloes that were walking along the
shore, and were informed that the Resident had ordered two of the
fattest to be killed for the use of our vessels. Well acquainted
with the wants of navigators, he had sent us a great quantity of
fruit, several bottles of an agreeable liquor extracted from the
palm-tree, and some of the young leaves of a species of fern of
the <i>genus asplenium</i>, which grows in moist places in the
shade; eaten as sallad they are very tender and well-tasted.</p>
<p>The Resident, Henry Commans, was a man of great simplicity of
manners, and very much beloved by the inhabitants. It was the
whole happiness the Dutch of Amboyna described, by, telling us
that he might sleep as much as he pleased. We met with several
persons in his house who had seen Admiral Bougainville during his
stay at Bourou, and who mentioned the name of that celebrated
navigator with enthusiastic admiration.</p>
<p>This and the following day were employed by me in surveying
the different districts of this island, which presents every
where a very varied and picturesque appearance. The sago tree
grows here in great abundance; it forms the principal source of
subsistence to the inhabitants, and affords even an article of
exportation. Large plantations of it were seen near the Dutch
establishment, in marshes which render this place very unhealthy,
particularly in the beginning of the spring. The cayou pouti of
the Malays (<i>melaleuca latifolia</i>), grows in great abundance
upon the hills. The Resident showed us a large alembic, which he
uses for distilling the leaves of this tree, from which he
procures every year a great quantity of the oil of cajeput.</p>
<p>The island of Bourou produces several kinds of wood proper for
inlaid work, which are its great request among the Chinese; and
others useful in dyeing. Two Chinese vessels were run aground in
the mud to the N.E. of the Dutch fort. The village near which the
fort is built is called Cayeli, in the Malay language. Those of
the natives who follow the Mahometan religion have a mosque,
whose roofs diminishing in regular gradation, as they rise one
above the other, present a very agreeable appearance. (See Plate
XLII, which represents, a part of this village.)</p>

<br>
<b>PLATE XLII. <i>View of the Island of Bourou, taken from the
Road</i></b></p>
<br>
<p>The coast to the east of the village is watered only by very
small streams, but about 2,500, toises to the N.W. we went up a
very considerable river, called by the inhabitants Aer-Bessar,
which discharges itself into the road-stead. This river is very
deep, and for the length of about 2,000 toises, as far as we went
up it, more than 70 feet broad. The island of Bourou undoubtedly
owes its possessing so considerable a stream to the great
elevation of its mountains. On the borders of the river I
frequently found the beautiful shrub known by the name of
<i>portlandia grandiflora</i>.</p>
<p>The pebbles rolled from the mountains, which on the banks of
several rivulets, were fragments of rocks of quartz mixed with
mica, and frequently of a sort of free stone, which likewise
consisted of quartzose particles.</p>
<p>Birds, especially parrots, are so numerous in this island,
that it probably derives from this circumstance its name, which
signifies in the Malayan language, a bird.</p>
<p>The woods affords such abundance of deer, goats and wild
boars, that the natives can furnish the Resident with as many as
he has occasion for, at the rate of two musket shots fired at
each. The species of boar called babi-roussa (<i>sus
babyrussa</i>), is also found here.</p>
<p>The natives seemed to be much afraid of several kinds of
snakes, which they told us were very numerous in their island;
but during the whole of our stay in this place, which I spent
almost entirely in rambling through the woods, I never met with
one of these reptiles.</p>
<p>Although the rainy season had not yet set in, violent forms
blew almost every night from the high mountains.</p>
<p>Upon sounding the bay, we discovered at its entrance, a little
on this side of the eat point, called Point Rouba, a shelf of
rocks, at a depth of not more than a fathom throughout an extent
of about 2,000 toises; but the rest of this spacious outlet very
deep, and that even at a small distance from the western point,
or Point Lessatello, called by the natives <i>Tanguiou Corbau</i>
(Buffalo Point).</p>
<p>According to astronomical, observations made at the village of
Cayeli, its latitude was 3&deg; 21' 54" S. long. 125&deg; 1' 6"
E.</p>
<p>The dip of the magnetic needle was 20&deg; 30'.</p>
<p>Its variation, as observed on board, was 0&deg; 54' E.</p>
<p>The highest point indicated by the thermometer on board was
23&deg;, and on shore 25&deg; 3-10ths.</p>
<p>The mercury in the barometer varied only from 28 inches 1 line
to 28 inches 2 lines.</p>
<p>The time of high water on the full and change days was three
quarters after eleven; it then rose to six feet perpendicular
height.</p>
<p>On the 16th we sailed from Bourou, steering for the Strait of
Bouton, which we entered on the afternoon of the 22d.</p>
<p>17th. On the following day, about sun-set, we cast anchor 513
toises from the coast, opposite to the outlet of the channel
which separates Pangesani from Celebes. Rossel, who, in
consequence of Dauribeau's being indisposed, had now the command
of the expedition, formed the project of sailing out through this
channel. Early in the morning of the 24th, he dispatched a
pinnace, which reconnoitred the channel to the extent of 15,000,
toises. A great number of small islands were scattered throughout
the Strait, particularly towards the coast of Celebes; and both
coasts were almost every where bordered with marshes. After this
report many of our seamen thought there was reason to apprehend
that we might not be able to find a sufficient depth of water in
every part of the channel for our vessels to pass through it;
however we sailed into it on the following day, and, after having
proceeded about 10,000 toises east, anchored at the close of the
evening.</p>
<p>26th. The following day another pinnace was sent out to sound
throughout the whole of this passage. She returned on the 29th in
the afternoon, with the intelligence that she had found a great
number of sand-banks and some flats, very difficult to have
discovered on account of their black colour, which rendered the
passage extremely dangerous. It was therefore determined to
return to the Strait of Bouton; and after having been obliged to
cast anchor, often several times in the course of a single day,
we at length arrived, on the 7th OCTOBER, at its southern
extremity, and anchored near the village of Bouton, at the
distance of 1,000 toises from the nearest coast.</p>
<p>We had spent a considerable space of time in passing through
this Strait, as we were obliged to lie at anchor during the whole
night time, and in the day to wait till the tide was favourable
to our intended course, before we could set sail.</p>
<p>During our passage the natives brought us various sorts of
fruits common in the Moluccas. Some of their boats had a cargo of
wild bread-fruit, the kernels of which, those who eat of them,
found very indigestible, even when roasted. They brought us
likewise a great number of pullets, goats, dried and sometimes
fresh fish. Most of those natives would not exchange any of their
commodities with us, before they had asked permission of the
Commander of our vessel, to whom they generally made a present.
They informed us that a year ago they had seen four European
vessels sailing through this Strait; namely, two from Ternate,
the others from Banda and Amboyna. These people trade with the
Dutch. They preferred money to any other commodity we offered
them. Most of them, however, were very desirous to procure powder
and ball from us; but when they found that we would not give them
any, one of them offered us two slaves in exchange for a small
quantity of ammunition, and appeared extremely surprised that we
did not accept of his proposal.</p>
<p>These islanders brought us a great number of parrots, of the
species <i>psillacus alexandri</i> and <i>psillacus
cristatus</i>.</p>
<p>We were much surprised to see them bring some cotton stuffs,
and thread made of the <i>agave vivipara</i>, which, they told
us, were of their own manufacture.</p>
<p>I made use of the opportunities afforded me by our detention
in the Strait to go on shore. I found a great number of plants
which I had never met with before: among others, the uviform
nutmeg tree described by Citizen Lamark; its fruit has no
aromatic quality. I likewise collected the <i>cynometra
ramiflora</i> the <i>gyrinocarpus</i> of G&aelig;rtner, and
various species of <i>calamus</i>, which, after raising
themselves to the summit of the tallest trees, descend again to
the ground, from whence they climb up others trees of equal
height, their stalks frequently growing to the length of several
hundred yards.</p>
<p>The fruit of the <i>bombax ceiba</i>, and that of several new
species of the same genus, affords abundant nourishment to the
numerous troops of apes that are found here, some of which we
killed, in order to preserve their skins.</p>
<p>The moist ground exhibited almost every where marks of the
feet of deer, wild boars, and buffaloes. We frequently found
numerous herds of the last-mentioned animals lying upon the wet
ground; but they always betook themselves to flight as soon as
they saw us, and it was impossible to pursue them through the
mire.</p>
<p>In the island of Pangesani I frequently traversed thick
forests of the palm, known by the name of <i>corypha
umbraculifera</i>, where I found squirrels of the species called
<i>feiurus palmarum</i>, which always fled at the approach of a
man.</p>
<p>The natives had erected several sheds near the shore, where
they kept the bamboo hurdles, upon which they place their fish
when they dry them at the fire in order to preserve them.</p>
<p>The islanders, aware of the danger of living near the
morasses, which render the northern coast of Pangesani very
unhealthy, have built no villages in that part of the country. It
was in the midst of these morasses that our crew became first
infected with a dysentery of a very contagious nature, which
produced the greatest ravages amongst us, as we were already much
debilitated by the long use of bad provisions, which had become
still more unwholesome during the course of our voyage. I was
also infected with this disorder which proved fatal to great
numbers of our crew.</p>
<p>8th. This morning at sun-rise, four chiefs, who bore the title
of Oran-kai, came on board to notify to us, that we were not
permitted to land, before the Sultana, who resided at Bouton, and
was an ally of the Dutch Company, had been previously informed of
our design. We told them that we were very desirous of viewing
this part of the island, and one of them went immediately to
signify our wish to that petty sovereign.</p>
<p>We were soon visited by two Dutch soldiers, who offered to
procure us an interview with the Sultan, assuring us that without
his permission the natives durst not sell us any provisions. They
then conducted us to their own dwelling, where we were informed
that the Sultan would not be visible till very late in the
afternoon. Upon this intelligence a considerable number of us
took an excursion into the interior of the island, directing our
route to the eastward. The natives did not appear surprised at
seeing us, and shewed no inclination to follow us.</p>
<p>After having walked for more than two hours along the banks of
a small river, covered with a great number of boats, some of
which had come from the strait laden with fish, we forded the
stream with a view of proceeding to the northward. We went up
very steep ascents, where I collected a great number of plants;
among others, the <i>barleria prionitis</i>, and several new
species of the <i>croton</i>.</p>
<p>Most of the habitations in this part of the country were built
upon the summits of delightful hills, with which this side of the
island abounds. We met with a very friendly reception from the
inhabitants, who presented to us fruits of different kinds. One
of them, who went to gather some cocoa-nuts for us, climbed very
quickly to the top of the tree, by means of an expedient which to
me appeared singular. He tied his legs together near the ancle
with a stripe of cloth, by which he was enabled to grasp the
trunk of the tree with his feet so strongly as to support the
whole weight of his body; and, as the stem was not very thick, by
thus clasping it alternately with his feet and his arms, he very
soon reached the top.</p>
<p>We remarked some forts built on the most inaccessible heights
amongst these hills, which serve the inhabitants for a place of
refuge, when their habitations are invaded by an enemy. These
fortifications consist of stone walls of considerable thickness,
and about ten or twelve feet high, inclosing a plot of ground
from sixty to eighty feet square.</p>
<p>The natives who sold us stuffs a few days before, had not
deceived us when they told us that they had been manufactured in
the island of Bouton. We saw to-day, in, several of the houses,
looms for manufacturing similar stuffs; the workmen performing
their operations in a manner very like our linen weavers. They
use cotton threads of various colours; but red and blue appear to
be the most in request among the natives.</p>
<p>About four o'clock in the afternoon we went to the village of
Bouton to see the Sultan. We had not been informed that it was
necessary to bring some presents with us, in order to be admitted
to an audience. As we had nothing to offer him, he was not to be
spoken with; but his son and nephew received us at the sort where
he resides. They frequently repeated to us, with great emphasis,
that the whole island was under his dominion; that he was an ally
of the Dutch Company, and that their enemies were his enemies.
They then told us that the natives of Ceram having lately invaded
their coasts, four of them were taken and delivered up to the
King, who immediately ordered them to be beheaded. They then
desired us to step a few paces further, and viewed us, with an
air of great satisfaction, the heads of these unfortunate
islanders, exposed upon long poles planted on the walls of the
fort.</p>
<p>The village of Bouton is built upon an eminence with a very
steep declivity to the north-west, and surrounded with thick
walls which secure the inhabitants from the incursions of their
enemies. The houses are built of bamboo, and their roofs covered
with palm-trees, like those of the other inhabitants of the
Moluccas.</p>
<p>The Sultan resides in a fort built of stone. It appeared to us
that this chief shews great distrust of the agents of the Dutch
Company, though they are his allies; for the three Dutch
soldiers, who were the only inhabitants of the Company's house,
were not permitted to live in the village where he resides. They
were obliged to remain in an inconvenient, isolated dwelling,
more than a 1000 toises distant from his residence. They were
soon to leave the island, and go to Macassar; but were still
detained by the apprehension of meeting with the vessels. of the
natives of Ceram, which had been cruising for some time in these
seas.</p>
<p>It was already night when we returned to the shore in order to
go on board. As it was then low water, we, were obliged to wade
in the sea up to our waists, though the greater part of us had
laboured under the dysentery for several days, which was very
much aggravated in consequence.</p>
<p>During the day the natives had brought, for the use of our
vessels, rice, maize, sugar canes, pullets' eggs, ducks and
goats. In exchange for these provisions they had been offered
hardware commodities, but they preferred the money current in the
Moluccas, especially the small silvered coin which they call
<i>koupan pera</i>, and which is brought over by the Dutch from
Europe.</p>
<p>The time of high water in this bay at full and change-days, is
about one o'clock in the afternoon, the tide rising six feet
perpendicular height.</p>
<p>Our anchoring station was 5&deg; 27' 8" S. lat. 120&deg; 27'
E. long.</p>
<p>On the 9th in the afternoon we weighed anchor, and steering
under full sails to get out of the strait of Bouton, we soon
reached the open sea.</p>
<p>On the 11th we passed the Strait of Salayer. A great number of
canoes and natives were seen upon the beach, others were sailing
towards Celebes.</p>
<p>We cast anchor several times along the coast of Madura, and on
the afternoon of the 19th, in a bottom of reddish mud, at the
depth of five fathoms, not far distant from the north-west point
of the island, and at the entrance of the channel that leads to
Sourabaya, one of the principal establishments of the Dutch in
the island of Java. As we intended to come to anchor there, a
pinnace had been dispatched, about nine o'clock in the morning,
to the village of Griss&eacute;, by the Esperance, to demand a
pilot who could conduct us through the channel.</p>
<p>Five days elapsed without our receiving any news of our
pinnace. We were apprehensive that she had fallen in with
pirates; and, on the 23d, another was sent out, upon the
supposition that the former had not arrived at the place of her
destination; for we could not have imagined that she had been
detained by the Dutch, who were well acquainted with the purpose
of our expedition; but on the 25th, we received a letter from the
officer who had the command of the pinnace, acquainting us that
he was detained prisoner by the Dutch, who were then at war with
France. Soon, however, a message was brought us from the Council
of Sourabaya, informing us that in pursuance of the instructions
which they had just received from Batavia, they were willing to
afford us every assistance in their power; and on the 26th two
pilots were sent us. We were obliged to cast anchor several times
before we could get into the roads of Sourabaya, where we cast
anchor on the 28th, about 1,000 toises northward of the river
that runs through the town the flag of the fort bearing S. 2&deg;
E. and the village of Griss&eacute; W. 30' N.</p>
<p>The dysentery had already carried off six of our crew since
our departure from Bouton.</p>
<p>31st. We soon obtained permission to reside in the town of
Sourabaya, where I procured a lodging in the house of Messrs.
Bawer and Stagh, who received me with the greatest
cordiality.</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 10th. The council revoked the permission they had
granted us, and all our company were immediately obliged to
return on board, with the exception of our invalids, to which
number I belonged, the dysentery having left me in a state of
extreme debility. Being now removed from the rest of my
fellow-sufferers in this contagious malady, I was very much
relieved by the use of purgatives, sago, and skimmed milk; and in
a short time completely recovered.</p>
<p>It was high time that this captivity should have an end; for
the number of sick persons on board increased with alarming
rapidity. Almost one half of the crew were attacked with
dysentery and contagious fevers, which did not abate of their
violence till they had carried off several of our men. At length
the Council again granted the permission which they had revoked a
few days before, and we had the satisfaction of meeting again
together in the town.</p>
<p>The heat was excessive during the first days of our stay at
Sourabaya. I was astonished to see Reaumur's thermometer rise to
27&deg;; but these burning heats were but of short duration; for
the change of the monsoon, which took place about the beginning
of November, caused for a considerable time, especially in the
afternoon, abundant falls of rain, which cooled the atmosphere to
such a degree, that the thermometer did not stand higher than
22&deg; or 23&deg;, in the hottest part of the day.</p>
<p>As soon as my health was a little re-established, I made
frequent excursions in the environs of the town, and as far into
the country as my strength permitted me. I had the pleasure of
seeing my collections of natural history encrease with a great
number of specimens which I had never before met with.</p>
<p>Most of the roads to a considerable distance from Sourabaya
are shaded by hedges of bamboo. Others were inclosed between long
avenues of <i>mimusops elengi</i>, <i>guillandina moringa</i>,
<i>nauclea orientalis</i>, <i>hybiscus tiliaceus</i>, &amp;c. the
shade of which produces a very salutary effect in this fervid
climate. I was much surprised to see the last mentioned tree send
out branches from the whole length of its trunk, as far down as
the root; differing in this respect from all of the same species,
that I had seen in other places, but I soon observed some of the
Javanese employed in making incisions very close to each other in
the bark of the trees with a large knife, and was informed that
this operation has been practised here from time immemorial for
the purpose of causing young shoots to sprout from the places cut
in this manner. They, always choose the rainy season for
performing this operation, as it succeeds with most certainty at
that period. Vegetation is then so rapid in this climate, that a
very short time after the incisions had been made, I saw them
filled with a vast number of young buds. The inhabitants of this
island are, however, in general, but little skilled in the
agricultural arts.</p>
<p>On the 12th of DECEMBER, those of us who were engaged in the
pursuit of natural history, obtained permission from the Governor
of Sourabaya to visit the mountains of Prau, situated at the
distance of about 30,000 toises west-south-west of the town.</p>
<p>On the following day we set out for the village of Poron,
situated near the foot of the mountains. The Javanese who carried
our baggage, suspended it to long poles of bamboo, each borne
between the shoulders of two men.</p>
<p>Having proceeded about 20,000 toises, we arrived at Sonde
Kari, where we dined after the Javanese fashion with the chief of
the village, who had ordered a sumptuous repast to be prepared
for us. It consisted of sever al dishes of broiled fish, and the
flesh of buffaloes and horses that had been preserved, as we were
told, for six months, by being cut into thin slices, and dried in
the sun. All the dishes were seasoned very highly with pepper,
pimento and ginger. Rice served us in the place of bread, and the
entertainment concluded with a plentiful desert of excellent
fruit.</p>
<p>We soon set forward on our journey, and were overtaken by a
heavy rain, which put us to great inconvenience. A serjeant of
the Dutch troop gave us a proof of his authority over the
Javanese, who returned to the village we had left, by taking out
of their hands the umbrellas which they had brought with them;
none of them daring to resist. We did not know what he intended
to do with them, till he came up and offered them to us, laying,
that he thought it very presumptuous in these men to shelter
themselves from the rain, while they saw us exposed to it; but to
his great surprise, none of us would make use of the umbrellas,
but desired him to return them to the owners.</p>
<p>At length we arrived at the village of Poron, where we were
received by the chief, who bears the title of Deman. His
principal office is to apportion to the natives their daily tasks
of labour.</p>
<p>The country through which we had palled is a vast plain, in
which rice is principally cultivated. The plantations were
already covered with six or eight inches of water, retained by
the earthen mounds with which they were surrounded.</p>
<p>Before we arrived at Sonda Kari, we had observed large
plantations of indigo. This article is principally cultivated in
Java by the Chinese, who have a much more extensive acquaintance
with the arts than the natives.</p>
<p>We saw likewise several fields in which the <i>ricinus
communis</i> was cultivated from the seeds of which the Javanese
extract a kind of lamp-oil.</p>
<p>This plain contains also a few plantations of maize, sugar
canes, and the <i>holcus sorghum</i>.</p>
<p>We spent the night in a very neat house, built of bamboo,
which stood close by that of the Deman.</p>
<p>14th. On the following day we baited at the west extremity of
the same village upon lands under the jurisdiction of the Tomogon
of Banguil, who, though he resided at the distance of more than
7,500 toises from thence, came early in the morning to give
orders to the inhabitants to provide for our safety, and furnish
us with whatever eatables we might want.</p>
<p>The Tomogon was a man of much good sense, spoke the Dutch
language very well, and had a competent knowledge of the affairs
of Europe. He was a Chinese by birth, but had embraced the
Mahometan religion in order to obtain the title of Tomogon.</p>
<p>We were extremely fatigued with the journey we had made the
preceding day upon the small honks common in this island. Their
very hard trot galled us the more, as the saddles we were obliged
to make use of were not stuffed, but confined of a very hard kind
of wood, with a thick piece of skin glued on for their only
covering. Besides, the Javanese stirrups were too short for us,
and could not be lowered, which rendered our posture extremely
uneasy. We therefore went very little from our habitation during
this day, but on the following (15th), we passed over a plain
about 2,500 toises in length, and for the greater part already
covered with water, before we arrived at the mountains of Prau.
The Tomagon of Banguil came to this place on horseback,
accompanied by upwards of a hundred attendants, very well
mounted. We found him in the forest, where he waited for us; but,
having probably very little idea of the simple mode in which
naturalists choose to travel, he had made his men bring chairs
with them for us to sit down upon at the top of one of the
mountains, from whence, we had a view through the trees of a
great extent of country, which he told us was all in his
dependency; and, to impress it the more strongly upon our minds,
he immediately ordered the tops of several tek-trees to be struck
off; but we saw with regret more than a hundred feet of the
trunks of these beautiful trees destroyed and sacrificed to such
a momentary gratification.</p>
<p>Peacocks were very common in these forests through which we
rambled in every direction, and we shot several of them. Amongst
other plants, I collected several beautiful species of
<i>uvaria</i>, <i>helecteres</i> and <i>bauhinia</i>.</p>
<p>The natives were employed in clearing a fine piece of ground
at the foot of the eastern mountains. The smaller trees they cut
down with axes; the larger they only stripped of their bark near
the root, in order to make them decay.</p>
<p>In the afternoon a distant sound of thunder ushered in a
violent fall of rain, as is usual at this season, which compelled
us to hasten back to our habitation. The Tomagon, before he
returned to Banguil, repeated the orders he had already given to
the natives, to provide for our safety and our wants.</p>
<p>On the following days we visited the mountains of Panangounan,
penetrating into the territory of the Emperor of Solo through
vast forests, of tek-trees, under the shade of which the
<i>pancratium amboinense</i> grew in abundance. Our guides often
expressed their fear of meeting with tigers, which, they told us,
were very common in the thickets on the banks of the rivers,
where they lie in wait for the animals that come to drink. We,
however, met with none of these beasts of prey.</p>
<p>The Javanese who accompanied us were almost continually on
horseback, and did not dismount even in the most inaccessible
parts of the forest; but whenever they saw the plant, called in
their language <i>kadiarankri</i>, they immediately threw
themselves on their feet, and ran as fast as they were, able to
gather it, trying to outstrip each other. Their eagerness raising
our curiosity to know the cause of their valuing this plant so
highly, we were informed that the knobs of its roots, dried and
reduced to powder, were a powerful aphrodisiac. It appears that
these auxiliary medicines are much esteemed amongst this people,
as, indeed, they generally are amongst the inhabitants of hot
climates. This parasite plant is only to be found upon the trunks
of large trees. It was not yet at its period of fructification;
however, it appeared to me to be a new species of the
<i>pothos</i>.</p>
<p>During these excursions I killed several wild cocks, whose
plumage was diversified with a variety of colours of admirable
brilliancy. Their crowing, which we often heard in the midst of
the woods, led us at first to imagine that we were in the
vicinity of some habitation, but we soon learnt to distinguish
their note perfectly well from that of the domestic cock. The
comb of the wild cock is not red, but of a whitish colour, with a
slight tinge of violet, which grows somewhat deeper towards the
edges. The greater part of the swamps in the neighbourhood of our
dwelling were covered with very large leaves of the <i>nymphea
nelumbo</i>, upon which we frequently observed a species of bird
similar to that called <i>parra sinensis</i>; and admired the
lightness with which it walked over the surface of the water,
stepping with its long legs from one leaf to the other.</p>
<p>At a small distance westward of the village of Porou, we saw
two colossal statues, called by the Javanese <i>rectio</i>, and
in high veneration amongst them. They were both hewn out of
blocks of stone eleven feet high; their drapery was very wide,
and the physiognomy of the two heads bore a Moorish character. To
me it appeared probable that these statues had been creed in
honour of some of the Moorish conquerors of the Moluccas; but the
natives could give us no information upon this head.</p>
<p>The Dutch serjeant who accompanied us was a passionate admirer
of the music of the Javanese. Soon after our arrival at Porou, he
sent for a female singer, whose shrill voice was accompanied by
two musicians, who played every evening upon instruments, one of
which resembled a dulcimer, and the other a mandolin. Whilst we
were employed in preparing and describing our collections, we
were obliged to hear, for several hours together, this discordant
music, which, however, had always charms sufficient to attract a
great concourse of the natives round the performers.</p>
<p>All the airs were sung in the Javanese language. They
generally turned upon the subject of love, as our serjeant, who
understood the Javanese language perfectly well, interpreted them
to us. He told us that these airs were all <i>impromptu</i> as
those sung by the singing-women of Java generally are. Ours
accompanied her voice with a variety of gestures appropriate to
the subject, and especially with certain movements of her fingers
of very difficult execution, which were much applauded by the
natives. If report does not do them injustice; these
singing-women are not distinguished by any extraordinary rigidity
of virtue.</p>
<p>On the 20th [December 1793] we returned to Sourabaya.</p>
<p>Citizen Riche and I had formed a plan of spending some time
among the mountains of Passervan; to which we had approached very
near during our last excursion. They are very high; and we had
often heard their fertility much token of. Grain is cultivated
there with great success. Many European fruit-trees likewise
succeed very well upon those heights, on account of the mild
temperature of their atmosphere. It was necessary for us to
procure a new order from the Governor before we could undertake
this expedition; but Dauribeau, who had offered to request it for
us, brought us information that the Governor had shortly received
new instructions from the Council at Batavia, according to which
he could not permit us to go to any great distance from the town;
a walk of three or four hours, being all that was allowed us. I
went several times to see a spring situated at the distance of
about 7,500 toises to the westward. A great quantity of petroleum
rises to the surface of its water, and is carefully collected by
the inhabitants, who mix it with pitch. Abundance of pumice-stone
is found in the surrounding country.</p>
<p>Citizen Riche and I lodged in the same house. We generally
went out together to pursue our researches, and returned in the
evening to Sourabaya with the new specimens we had collected. It
was always with regret that we found our labours suspended by the
approach of night. But on the 19th of February 1794, about four
o'clock in the morning, Chateauvieux, the commandant of the
place, came with a troop of thirty soldiers under arms, to inform
us, in the name of Dauribeau and the principal officers of our
expedition, that we were under arrest. Shortly after we learnt
that several others of our companions had shared the same fate,
without being able to divine the cause of so arbitrary an act of
authority; but we were soon informed that intelligence which
Dauribeau had received from Europe, had determined him to hoist
the white flag, and put himself under the protection of the
Dutch, who were then at war with France. He had undoubtedly
already then formed the project, which he afterwards carried into
execution, of selling the vessels of our expedition. To insure
his success, it was necessary for him to get rid of all those
persons under him who he knew would strongly disapprove of such a
measure. We were therefore delivered into the hands of the Dutch
as prisoners of war, to the number of seven, namely, Legrand,
Laignel, Willaumez, Riche, Ventenat, Piron, and myself, and
conducted to Samarang by a march of 200,000 toises, over roads
bad in the extreme, and in the rainy season. We were obliged to
use boats to cross several large plains, inundated by the
torrents descending from the mountains situated to the southward,
and which form a part of the great chain which runs through the
whole island of Java from east to west.</p>
<p>Michel Sirot and Pierre Creno, servants on board the
Esperance, followed us in our proscription.</p>
<p>Dauribeau had robbed me of all my collections. When we left
Sourabaya, I had intrusted to the care of Lahaie, the gardener,
eleven bread-fruit trees, and an equal number of the roots and
items of this valuable plant, kept in clay in perfect
preservation, and fit to produce as many young trees. He promised
to take the best care of them, and gave me a receipt for the
deposit.</p>
<p>The greater part of the crews were thrown into the prisons of
the Tomagon of Sourabaya, from whence they were taken out some
time after, part to be sent into those of Batavia, and part to
remain with Dauribeau.</p>
<p>We left Sourabaya on the 24th of February.</p>
<p>This town is situated in 7&deg; 14' 28" south lat. 110&deg;
35' 43" east long.</p>
<p>The variation of the magnetic needle was 2&deg; 31' 14" west,
and the distance 25&deg;.</p>
<p>After a long course of fatigue we at length arrived at
Samarang, on the morning of the 11th March.</p>
<p>The Commandant of the place immediately conducted us to
Governor Overstraaten. The Governor told us that the first
surgeon of the hospital had got a lodging prepared for us, and
sent us to take possession of it; but what was our surprise,
when, having been introduced to the surgeon, he led us into one
of the wards of his hospital, where he shewed us seven beds,
which he said had just been made ready for us. There was neither
table nor chairs in this place. It was in vain that we
represented to him that we were not sick, and did not with to
become so by living in an hospital; his answer always was, that,
according to the orders of his Excellency the Governor, he had no
other lodging to offer us.</p>
<p>We were obliged at last to appeal to the Governor, and to make
him sensible, if possible, of the harshness of such a mode of
proceeding with respect to men, who, upon their return from a
long and toilsome expedition, undertaken for the advancement of
the arts and sciences, had a right to expect a better reception
from a civilized nation. It was not, however, till after
parleying for several hours, that the order for our imprisonment
in an hospital was reversed. We were now permitted to live in the
centre of the town, and this was our prison.</p>
<p>Some time after we obtained permission to go to the distance
of about 2,500 toises from Samarang, but with the restriction
that we should not approach the sea-coast.</p>
<p>During our march from Sourabaya to Samarang, I had been
surprised to observe in the market places of several villages,
shops where small flat squares of a reddish clay, called by the
inhabitants <i>tana ampo</i>, were exposed for sale. At first I
imagined that they might be employed for fulling cloths; but I
soon observed the inhabitants chewing small quantities of this
clay, and they assured me that this was all the use they made of
it.</p>
<p>Whilst we were passing through the extensive rice plantations
at the foot of the mountains, the natives had frequently pointed
out to us, fields of rice upon declivities too steep to be able
to retain the water. The rice cultivated in these places was of a
species, that does not require an inundated soil to succeed
perfectly well; but they only cultivate it in the season when the
land is daily drenched with copious rains.</p>
<p>I had already remarked upon several hills in the island of
Java, a great number of cocoa trees which were stripped of their
leaves and dead at the root. It had appeared very singular to me
to find so great a number within so small a space but I was at
length informed, by several of the inhabitants of the hills
situated at a little distance north-west of Samarang, where I saw
many cocoa trees in the same condition, that they had been struck
by lightning, and they informed me that the same circumstance
frequently happens upon many other hills in the island. In fact,
these high trees are particularly exposed by their situation, to
the terrible effects of the lightning; besides, the sap, with
which they abound, contributes in a great degree to attract the
electric matter.</p>
<p>On the 5th of April, we were informed that a packet was
shortly to sail from Batavia for Europe. The Governor of Samarang
was willing that two of us should go to Batavia, to solicit
permission of the Regency for themselves to return in this
vessel. As we were all animated by the same desire of revisiting
our native country, we agreed to cast lots. The fortunate persons
were Citizens Riche and Legrand, and on the 8th. of May they set
out for Batavia.</p>
<p>Twelve days after we received orders from the Governor of
Samarang, to go to the same place, and there to wait for another
opportunity of returning to France, than that of the packet above
mentioned for it was even very uncertain, whether or not Riche
and Legrand would find a place in it.</p>
<p>Some of the Dutch who were interested about us, informed us,
that the fleet, upon which our hopes of returning to Europe
depended, was not to set sail in less than six or seven months,
and they assured us, that before that period it was not probable
we should meet with any other opportunity of returning to out
native country. The dysentery which I had caught among the
marshes of Strait Bouton, made me apprehensive that a relapse
would be produced by those of Batavia, where the exhalations are
still more noxious. Besides, the situation of Batavia is so
pernicious, so Europeans, particularly during the first year of
their abode there, that out of every hundred soldiers who arrive
there from Europe, twenty-four generally die in the first year,
and those who become somewhat accustomed to the climate, still
remain in a languishing state of health. Other Europeans who have
all the conveniencies of life at their command, do not die in so
terrifying a proportion; but from the small allowance that was
granted us as prisoners of war, we could not hope to be able to
procure ourselves any thing beyond the mere necessaries of
life.</p>
<p>Citizen Piron and myself obtained permission to delay our
departure for Batavia till the Dutch fleet was just about to
sail. Our companions in misfortune, Laignel, Ventenat, and
Willaumez, set off for that place; and as soon as they arrived
there they were sent to Fort Tangaran, more than 7,500 toises
distant from the town. Riche and Legrand, instead of procuring a
passage in the packet, which was immediately to set sail, had
been exiled to Fort Ank&eacute;. However, about two months
afterwards, they had the good fortune to embark for Isle de
France, on board of a vessel in which some prisoners taken from
our privateers were conveyed to that place.</p>
<p>Dauribeau, not satisfied with having taken away my
collections, requested of the Governor of Samarang, that the
manuscript which contained the observations I had made during the
voyage in search of P&eacute;rouse might likewise be taken from
me. In vain I protested against this violation of the most sacred
species of property. Governor Overstraaten gave orders, on the
28th of July, that my effects, to which the seal had been applied
a month before, should be searched; but fortunately my journal
was not found.</p>
<p>Dauribeau shortly after his arrival at Samarang, for the
purpose of treating with the Governor concerning the sale of the
vessels, died there on the 22d of August.</p>
<p>As the time appointed or the sailing of the Dutch fleet was at
hand, Citizen Piron and myself set out for Batavia on the 31st.
On board of the vessel which conveyed us thither were several
Javanese, one of whom was in irons. His unfortunate wife sat
beside him, having voluntarily chosen to follow him in his
banishment. We were penetrated with compassion, when we heard
from the mouth of this unhappy man the occasion of his ruin. His
name, he told us, was Piromongolo; he was of the village of
Calibongou, in the dependency of the Government of Samarang. He
had paid 350 rix dollars to become a freeman of that place, but
was supplanted by another person, who offered a still larger sum
for the same privilege; and those who had received his money,
instead of returning it to him, thought fit to put him out of
their way by banishing him to Ceylon, where he was to be in the
same confinement with many others of the inhabitants of the
Moluccas, who are sacrificed by the Dutch to their revengeful
disposition, or pretended political interests. Amongst the
injuries that had been heaped upon him, he had been accused, he
said, of being a sorcerer. Though he assured us, with a great
deal of simplicity, that if he was one, he had never known any
thing about it; but at any rate he was sure that those who had
robbed him of his three hundred and fifty dollars, were a much
more dangerous kind of sorcerers than he.</p>
<p>The salary which the different Governors of the Island of Java
receive from the Dutch Company very moderate; but then the abuses
are connived at, which result from the very ample
indemnification, which the greater part make themselves, by
raising contributions upon the natives to a much greater amount
than what they have to deliver into the magazines of the Company,
the surplus of which they appropriate to their own profit.</p>
<p>The Chinese are almost the only persons employed here in the
cultivation of sugar. They scarcely make any other than
sugar-candy, which they, are not allowed to sell, except to the
Governor, who purchases it on the Company's account; but
frequently he compels these unfortunate Chinese to sell it him at
half the price which he makes the Company pay for it, though even
they buy it at a comparatively low rate.</p>
<p>The contributions which the Governors receive in specie, are
likewise a great source of profit to them, as they keep this
money in their own hands; and pay the amount to the Company in
paper. During my stay in Java their emoluments in this way
amounted to twenty per cent.</p>
<p>The nomination of the natives to different offices, is
likewise a source from whence the Governors and Residents, derive
great profits.</p>
<p>On the 2d of September we anchored in the roadstead of
Batavia.</p>
<p>4th. Aster we had remained two days on board, the Commandant
of the roadstead conducted us on shore, and we were immediately
conveyed to Fort Ank&eacute;, distant not more than about 2,500
toises from the town. The same chamber was allotted us, which our
companions in misfortune, Riche and Legrand, had formerly
occupied.</p>
<p>We were surrounded on all sides by marshes, which render this
situation very unhealthy; it is, however, much less so than that
of the town, where, at low water, the black mud collected in a
great number of canals, is exposed to the heat of the sun, and
exhales the most pestilential effluvia. The marshes of
Ank&eacute;, on the contrary, were covered with a variety of
plants, so close to each other, that they presented the
appearance of fine meadows in full vegetation. A great number of
different kinds of grasses, rushes, nelumbo, &amp;c. grew forth
from the bottom of the stagnant water, and the interstices
between these plants were covered with large quantities of the
<i>ptisia stratiotes</i>, which, floating on the surface of the
water by means of the small air-bladders, with which its leaves
are provided at their bases, absorb a great quantity of the
noxious vapours as fast as they are exhaled from the mud, and
change them, with the aid of the solar rays, as we know, into
respirable air. This transmutation is affected by the
<i>ptisia</i> more than by any other plant; for it is known by
experiment to be so powerful a preventive of the decomposition of
stagnant water, that if fishes be put into a small quantity of
water, in which they would otherwise perish in the course of a
few days they may be preserved alive for a long time, by covering
its surface with these singular plants, every one of which
occupies a space of about nine square inches.</p>
<p>These marshes are haunted by the enormous serpent known by the
name of boa constrictor. One of these snakes came regularly every
five or six days, and stole one of the fowls from a hen-coop
belonging to a publican in the neighbourhood of Fort Ank&eacute;,
with whom we were allowed to take our meals. This publican was a
very severe master; for, whenever he missed one of his fowls he
always taxed an old slave, who had the care of his hen-coop, with
dishonesty; and for every one that disappeared, he ordered fifty
strokes of a ratan to be inflicted without mercy upon the
unfortunate wretch; but one day the thief having swallowed a very
large hen, found himself so stuffed with his meal, that he could
not get out of the coop by the hole through which he had entered;
and the slave revenged himself for the chastisement he had
received by cutting the animal in pieces. The fowl, which was
taken out of his stomach, had been swallowed down head foremost,
and had as yet undergone no change in its substance. This serpent
was but of a middling size, being only twelve feet in length; but
a few days afterwards the natives killed one at a small distance
from this place, which measured forty feet. It appeared that this
animal did not use to prey upon fowls; for they found in his
stomach a kid that weighed thirty pounds.</p>
<p>The river that runs at the foot of Fort Ank&eacute; is
frequented by alligators. One day I saw a very large one advance
towards a company of boys who were swimming in the river. He
immediately seized one of them and disappeared under the water;
nevertheless, a few days after another, company of boys came to
bathe in the same place.</p>
<p>During the last months of our stay at Ank&eacute;, four
officers of the French privateer Le Modeste were confined in the
same fortress, and alleviated the tediousness of our captivity by
their company. They had been made prisoners of war on board of a
Dutch vessel, shortly after they had made prize of her.</p>
<p>The Major of the place, who visited us very frequently,
informed us of the death of Giradrin, purser to the Recherche,
who was discovered to be a woman, as we had suspected from the
beginning of the voyage. An impulse of curiosity seems to have
been her principal motive for embarking in this expedition. She
had left a very young child behind her in France.</p>
<p>The corvette La Nathalie, having Citizen Riche on board, had
been dispatched from Isle de France to Batavia in order to demand
our vessels from the Regency; but, after she had arrived in the
roads, she was detained for five months under the cannon of two
Dutch ships of war, and all that the could obtain was to sail
back with those persons belonging to our expedition, who were in
confinement, and some other French prisoners of war.</p>
<p>At length, on the 29th of March 1795, we set sail for the Isle
de France.</p>
<p>It was high time for me to be released from my confinement
amongst the marches of Fort Ank&eacute;, as I had laboured
already more than a month under a dysentery, which was making a
very rapid progress. But as soon as I was removed into a purer
air, my malady diminished from day to day.</p>
<p>On the 18th of May we arrived at Isle de France, I made
frequent excursions among the mountains, where I observed a great
variety of natural productions.</p>
<p>I had long been waiting for an opportunity of returning to my
native country, when at length General Malartic dispatched the
Minerva to France, under the command of Citizen Laignel, one of
my companions in misfortune. I embarked in this vessel, which
sailed from Isle de France on the 20th of November.</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that during a run of upwards of 600,000
toises west-north-west, from 25&deg; N. lat. and 31&deg; W. long.
we found the sea covered with a prodigious quantity of <i>fucus
natans</i>, which indicate the existence of some very extensive
banks upon which this sea-weed is produced. This is a subject
well worthy of the investigation of navigators.</p>
<p>On the 12th of March 1796, we cast anchor at the Isle of Bar,
from whence I soon returned to Paris.</p>
<p>Soon after I arrived in that city, I was informed that my
collections of natural history had been sent to England. The
French Government immediately put in their claim for them, which,
being supported by Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal
Society of London, with all the exertions that were to have been
expected from his known love for the sciences, I soon had the
satisfaction of finding myself again in possession of the
requisite materials, for making known to the world the natural
productions which I had discovered in the different countries we
had visited during the course of our expedition.</p>
<p>The bread-fruit plants which I left in the custody of the
gardener Lahaie, were transported, with several others which he
had cultivated, to Isle de France; from whence some have been
sent to Cayenne, and others to Paris, where they are deposited in
the hot-houses of the Botanical Garden.</p>
