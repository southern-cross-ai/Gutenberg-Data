  <h2><a name="chap01"
     id="chap01">THE STORY OF ROMULUS AND NUMA</a></h2>

  <p>ÆNEAS of Troy, coming to the land of Italy, took to wife Lavinia, daughter
  of King Latinus, and built him a city, which he called Lavinium, after the
  name of his wife. And, after thirty years, his son Ascanius went forth from
  Lavinium with much people, and built him a new city, which he called Alba. In
  this city reigned kings of the house and lineage of Æneas for twelve
  generations. Of these kings the eleventh in descent was one Procas, who,
  having two sons, Numitor and Amulius, left his kingdom, according to the
  custom, to Numitor, the elder. But Amulius drave out his brother, and reigned
  in his stead. Nor was he content with this wickedness, but slew all the male
  children of his brother. And the daughter of his brother, that was named Rhea
  Silvia, he chose to be a priestess of Vesta, making as though he would do the
  maiden honor, but his thought was that the name of his brother should perish,
  for they that serve Vesta are vowed to perpetual virginity.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Wolf and the Twins.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>But it came to pass that Rhea bare twin sons, whose father, it was said,
  was the god Mars. Very wroth was Amulius when he heard this thing; Rhea he
  made fast in prison, and the children he gave to certain or his servants that
  they should cast them into the river. Now it chanced that at this season
  Tiber had overflowed his banks, neither could the servants come near to the
  stream of the river; nevertheless they did not doubt that the children would
  perish, for all that the overflowing of the water was neither deep nor of a
  swift current. Thinking then that they had duly performed the commandment of
  the King, they set down the babes in the flood and departed. But after a
  while the flood abated, and left the basket wherein the children had been
  laid on dry ground. And a she-wolf coming down from the hill to drink at the
  river (for the country in those days was desert and abounding in wild
  beasts), heard the crying of the children and ran to them. Nor did she devour
  them, but gave them suck; nay, so gentle, was she that Faustulus, the King's
  shepherd, chancing to go by, saw that she licked them with her tongue. This
  Faustulus took the children and gave them to his wife to rear; and these,
  when they were of age to go by themselves, were not willing to abide with the
  flocks and herds, but were hunters, wandering through the forests that were
  in those parts. And afterward, being now come to full strength, they were not
  content to slay wild beasts only, but would assail troops of robbers, as
  these were returning laden with their booty, and would divide the spoils
  among the shepherds. Now there was held in those days, on the hill that is
  now called the Palatine, a yearly festival to the god Pan. This festival King
  Evander first ordained, having come from Arcadia, in which land, being a land
  of shepherds, Pan that is the god of shepherds is greatly honored. And when
  the young men and their company (for they had gathered a great company of
  shepherds about them, and led them in all matters both of business and of
  sport) were busy with the festival, there came upon them certain robbers that
  had made an ambush in the place, being very wroth by reason of the booty
  which they had lost. These laid hands on Remus, but Romulus they could not
  take, so fiercely did he fight against them. Remus, therefore, they delivered
  up to King Amulius, accusing him of many things and chiefly of this, that he
  and his companions had invaded the land of Numitor, dealing with them in the
  fashion of an enemy and carrying off much spoil. To Numitor, therefore, did
  the King deliver Remus, that he might put him to death. Now Faustulus had
  believed from the beginning that the children were of the royal house, for he
  knew that the babes had been cast into the river by the King's command, and
  the time also of his finding them agreed thereto. Nevertheless he had not
  judged it expedient to open the matter before due time, but waited till
  occasion or necessity should arise. But now, there being such necessity, he
  opened the matter to Romulus. Numitor also, when he had the young man Remus
  in his custody, knowing that he and his brother were twins, and that the time
  agreed, and seeing that they were of a high spirit, bethought him of his
  grandsons; and, indeed, having asked many questions of Remus, was come nigh
  to knowing of what race he was. And now also Romulus was ready to help his
  brother. To come openly with his whole company he dared not, for he was not a
  match for the power of King Amulius; but he bade sundry shepherds make their
  way to the palace, each as best he could, appointing to them a time at which
  they should meet. And now came Remus also, with a troop of youths gathered
  together from the household of Numitor. Then did Romulus and Remus slay King
  Amulius. In the meanwhile Numitor gathered the youth of Alba to the citadel,
  crying out that they must make the place safe, for that the enemy was upon
  them; but when he perceived that the young men had done the deed, forthwith
  he called an assembly of the citizens, and set forth to them the wickedness
  which his brother had wrought against him, and how his grandsons had been
  born and bred and made known to him, and then, in order, how the tyrant had
  been slain, himself having counselled the deed. When he had so spoken the
  young men came with their company into the midst of the assembly, and saluted
  him as King; to which thing the whole multitude agreeing with one consent,
  Numitor was established upon the throne.</p>

  <p>After this Romulus and his brother conceived this purpose, that, leaving
  their grandfather to be king at Alba, they should build for themselves a new
  city in the place where, having been at the first left to die, they had been
  brought up by Faustulus the shepherd. And to this purpose many agreed both of
  the men of Alba and of the Latins, and also of the shepherds that had
  followed them from the first, holding it for certain all of them that Alba
  and Lavinium would be of small account in comparison of this new city which
  they should build together. But while the brothers were busy with these
  things, there sprang up afresh the same evil thing which had before wrought
  such trouble in their house, even the lust of power. For though the
  beginnings of the strife between them were peaceful, yet did it end in great
  wickedness. The matter fell out in this wise. Seeing that the brothers were
  twins, and that neither could claim to have the preference to the other in
  respect of his age, it was agreed between them that the gods that were the
  guardians of that country should make known by means of augury which of the
  two they chose to give his name to the new city. Then Romulus stood on the
  Palatine hill, and when there had been marked out for him a certain region of
  the sky, watched therein for a sign; and Remus watched in like manner,
  standing on the Aventine. And to Remus first came a sign, six vultures; but
  so soon as the sign had been proclaimed there came another to Romulus, even
  twelve vultures. Then they that favored Remus clamored that the gods had
  chosen him for King, because he had first seen the birds; and they that
  favored Romulus answered that he was to be preferred because he had seen more
  in number. This dispute waxed so hot that they fell to fighting; and in the
  fight it chanced that Remus was slain. But some say that when Romulus had
  marked out the borders of the town which he would build, and had caused them
  to build a wall round it, Remus leapt over the wall, scorning it because it
  was mean and low; and that Romulus slew him, crying out, "Thus shall every
  man perish that shall dare to leap over my walls." Only others will have it
  that though he perished for this cause Romulus slew him not, but a certain
  Celer. This much is certain, that Romulus gained the whole kingdom for
  himself and called the city after his own name.</p>

  <p>And now, having first done sacrifice to the gods, he called a general
  assembly of the people, that he might give them laws, knowing that without
  laws no city can endure. And judging that these would be the better kept of
  his subjects if he should himself bear something of the show of royal
  majesty, he took certain signs of dignity, and especially twelve men that
  should continually attend him, bearing bundles of rods, and in the midst of
  the rods an axe; these men they called lictors. Meanwhile the city increased,
  for the King and his people enlarged their borders, looking rather to the
  greatness for which they hoped than to that which they had. And that this
  increase might not be altogether empty walls without men, Romulus set up a
  sanctuary, to which were gathered a great multitude of men from the nations
  round about. All that were discontented and lovers of novelty came to him.
  Nor did he take any account of their condition, whether they were bond or
  free, but received them all. Thus was there added to the city great strength.
  And the King when he judged that there was strength sufficient, was minded to
  add to the strength counsel. Wherefore he chose a hundred men for
  counsellors. A hundred he chose, either because he held that number to be
  sufficient, or because there were no more that were fit to bear this dignity
  and be called Fathers, for this was the name of these counsellors.</p>

  <p>After this the people bethought themselves how they should get for
  themselves wives, for there were no women in the place. Wherefore Romulus
  sent ambassadors to the nations round about, praying that they should give
  their daughters to his people for wives. "Cities," he said, "have humble
  beginnings even as all other things. Nevertheless they that have the gods and
  their own valor to help become great. Now that the gods are with us, as ye
  know, be assured also that valor shall not be wanting." But the nations round
  about would not hearken to him, thinking scorn of this gathering of robbers
  and slaves and runaways, so that they said, "Why do ye not open a sanctuary
  for women also that so ye may find fit wives for your people?" Also they
  feared for themselves and their children what this new city might grow to.
  Now when the ambassadors brought back this answer the Romans were greatly
  wroth, and would take by force that which their neighbors would not give of
  their free will. And to the end that they might do this more easily, King
  Romulus appointed certain days whereon he and his people would hold a
  festival with games to Neptune; and to this festival he called all them that
  dwelt in the cities round about. But when many were gathered together (for
  they were fain to see what this new city might be), and were now wholly bent
  on the spectacle of the games, the young men of the Romans ran in upon them,
  and carried off all such as were unwedded among the women. To these King
  Romulus spake kindly, saying, "The fault is not with us but with your
  fathers, who dealt proudly with us, and would not give you to us in marriage.
  But now ye shall be held in all honor as our wives, and shall have your
  portion of all that we possess. Put away therefore your anger, for ye shall
  find us so much the better husbands than other men, as we must be to you not
  for husbands only but parents also and native country."</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile the parents of them that had been carried off put on
  sackcloth, and went about through the cities crying out for vengeance upon
  the Romans. And chiefly they sought for help from Titus Tatius, that was king
  of the Sabines in those days, and of great power and renown. But when the
  Sabines seemed to be tardy in the matter, the men of Cære first gathered
  together their army and marched into the country of the Romans. Against these
  King Romulus led forth his men and put them to flight without much ado,
  having first slain their king with his own hand. After then returning to Rome
  he carried the arms which he had taken from the body of the king to the hill
  of the Capitol, and laid them down at the shepherds' oak that stood thereon
  in those days. And when he had measured out the length and breadth of a
  temple that he would build to Jupiter upon the hill, he said, "O Jupiter, I,
  King Romulus, offer to thee these arms of a King, and dedicate therewith a
  temple in this place, in which temple they that come after me shall offer to
  thee like spoils in like manner, when it shall chance that the leader of our
  host shall himself slay with his own hands the leader of the host of the
  enemy." And this was the first temple that was dedicated in Rome. And in all
  the time to come two only offered in this manner, to wit, Cornelius Cossus
  that slew Lars Tolumnius, king of Veii, and Claudius Marcellus that slew
  Britomarus, king of the Gauls.</p>

  <p>After this, King Tatius and the Sabines came up against Rome with a great
  army. And first of all they gained the citadel by treachery in this manner.
  One Tarpeius was governor of the citadel, whose daughter, Tarpeia by name,
  going forth from the walls to fetch water for a sacrifice, took money from
  the King that she should receive certain of the soldiers within the citadel;
  but when they had been so received, the men cast their shields upon her,
  slaying her with the weight of them. This they did either that they might be
  thought to have taken the place by force, or that they judged it to be well
  that no faith should be kept with traitors. Some also tell this tale, that
  the Sabines wore great bracelets of gold on their left arms, and on their
  left hands fair rings with precious stones therein, and that when the maiden
  covenanted with them that she should have for a reward that which they
  carried in their left hands, they cast their shields upon her. And other say
  that she asked for their shields having the purpose to betray them, and for
  this cause was slain.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Death of Tarpeia.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Thus the Sabines had possession of the citadel; and the next day King
  Romulus set the battle in array on the plain that lay between the hill of the
  Capitol and the hill of the Palatine. And first the Romans were very eager to
  recover the citadel, a certain Hostilius being their leader. But when this
  man, fighting in the forefront of the battle, was slain, the Romans turned
  their backs and fled before the Sabines, even unto the gate of the Palatine.
  Then King Romulus (for he himself had been carried away by the crowd of them
  that fled) held up his sword and his spear to the heavens, and cried aloud,
  "O Jupiter, here in the Palatine didst thou first, by the tokens which thou
  sentest me, lay the foundations of my city. And lo! the Sabines have taken
  the citadel by wicked craft, and have crossed the valley, and are come up
  even hither. But if thou sufferest them so far, do thou at the least defend
  this place against them, and stay this shameful flight of my people. So will
  I build a temple for thee in this place, even a temple of Jupiter the Stayer,
  that may be a memorial to after generations of how thou didst this day save
  this city." And when the had so spoken, even as though he knew that the
  prayer had been heard, he cried, "Ye men of Rome, Jupiter bids you stand fast
  in this place and renew the battle." And when the men of Rome heard these
  words, it was as if a voice from heaven had spoken to them, and they stood
  fast, and the King himself went forward and stood among the foremost. Now the
  leader of the Sabines was one Curtius. This man, as he drave the Romans
  before him, cried out to his comrades, "See we have conquered these men,
  false hosts and feeble foes that they are! Surely now they know that it is
  one thing to carry off maidens and another to fight with men." But whilst he
  boasted himself thus, King Romulus and a company of the youth rushed upon
  him. Now Curtius was fighting on horseback, and being thus assailed he fled,
  plunging into a certain pool which lay between the Palatine hill and the
  Capitol. Thus did he barely escape with his life, and the lake was called
  thereafter Curtius' pool. And now the Sabines began to give way to the
  Romans, when suddenly the women for whose sake they fought, having their hair
  loosened and their garments rent, ran in between them that fought, crying
  out, "Shed ye not each other's blood ye that are fathers-in- law and
  sons-in-law to each other. But if ya break this bond that is between you,
  slay us that are the cause of this trouble. And surely it were better for us
  to die than to live if we be bereaved of our fathers or of our husbands."
  With these words they stirred the hearts both of the chiefs and of the
  people, so that there was suddenly made a great silence. And afterward the
  leaders came forth to make a covenant; and these indeed so ordered matters
  that there was not peace only, but one state where there had been two. For
  the Sabines came to Rome and dwelt there and King Romulus and King Tatius
  reigned together. Only, after a while, certain men of Lanuvium slew King
  Tatius as he was sacrificing to the gods at Lavinium; and thereafter Romulus
  only was king as before.</p>

  <p>When he had reigned thirty and seven years there befell the thing that
  shall now be told. On a certain day he called the people together on the
  field of Mars, and held a review of his army. But while he did this there
  arose suddenly a great storm with loud thunderings and very thick clouds, so
  that the king was hidden away from the eyes of all the people. Nor indeed was
  he ever again seen upon the earth. And when men were recovered of their fear
  they were in great trouble, because they had lost their King, though indeed
  the Fathers would have it that he had been carried by a whirlwind into
  heaven. Yet after awhile they began to worship him as being now a god; and
  when nevertheless some doubted, and would even whisper among themselves that
  Romulus had been torn in pieces by the Fathers, there came forward a certain
  Proculus, who spake after this manner: "Ye men of Rome, this day, in the
  early morning, I saw Romulus, the father of this city, come down from heaven
  and stand before me. And when great fear came upon me, I prayed that it might
  be lawful for me to look upon him face to face. Then said he to me, 'Go thy
  way, tell the men of Rome that it is the will of them that dwell in heaven
  that Rome should be the chiefest city in the world. Bid them therefore be
  diligent in war; and let them know for themselves and tell their children
  after them that there is no power on earth so great that it shall be able to
  stand against them!' And when he had thus spoken, he departed from me going
  up into heaven." All men believed Proculus when he thus spake, and the people
  ceased from their sorrow when they knew that King Romulus had been taken up
  into heaven.</p>

  <p>And now it was needful that another king should be chosen. No man in those
  days was more renowned for his righteousness and piety than a certain Numa
  Pompilius that dwelt at Cures in the land of the Sabines. Now it seemed at
  first to the Senate that the Sabines would be too powerful in the state if
  the king should be chosen from among them, nevertheless because they could
  not agree upon any other man, at last with one consent they decreed that the
  kingdom should be offered to him. And Numa was willing to receive it if only
  the gods consented. And the consent of the gods was asked in this fashion.
  Being led by the augur into the citadel, he sat down on a stone with his face
  looking toward the south, and on his left hand sat the augur, having his head
  covered and in his hand an augur's staff, which is a wand bent at the end and
  having no knot. Then looking toward the city and the country round about, he
  offered prayers to the gods and marked out the region of the sky from the
  sunrising to the sunsetting; the parts toward the south he called the right,
  and the parts toward the north he called the left; and he set a boundary
  before as far as his eye could reach. After this he took his staff in his
  left hand and laid his right on the head of Numa, praying in these words:
  "Father Jupiter, if it be thy will that this Numa Pompilius, whose head I
  hold, should be King of Rome, show us, I pray thee, clear tokens of this thy
  will within the space which I have marked out." He then named the tokens
  which he desired, and when they had been shown, Numa was declared to be
  King.</p>

  <p>King Numa, considering that the city was but newly founded, and that by
  violence and force, conceived that he ought to found it anew, giving it
  justice and laws and religion; and that he might soften the manners and
  tempers of the people, he would have them cease awhile from war. To this end
  he built a temple of Janus, by which it might be signified whether there was
  peace or war in the state; for, if it were peace, the gates of the temple
  should be shut, but if it were war, they should be open. Twice only were the
  gates shut after the days of Numa; for the first time when Titus Manlius was
  Consul, after the ending of the first war against Carthage, and for the
  second time when the Emperor Augustus, after vanquishing Antony at Actium,
  established universal peace both by land and sea. This temple then King Numa
  built, and shut the gates thereof, having first made treaties of peace with
  the nations round about.</p>

  <p>Many other things did King Numa set in order for his people. First he
  divided the year into twelve months, each month being according to the course
  of the moon, and in every twenty-fourth year another month, that the year
  might so agree with the course of the sun. Also he appointed certain lawful
  days for business, and other days on which nothing might be done. He made
  priests also, of whom the chief was the priest of Jupiter, to whom he gave
  splendid apparel and a chair of ivory. Two other priests he made, one of
  Mars, and the other of Quirinus, that is to say, of Romulus the god. And he
  chose virgins for the service of Vesta, who should keep alive the sacred
  fire, and twelve priests of Mars, whom he called the Salii, to be keepers of
  the sacred shield. (This shield, men said, fell down from heaven, and that it
  might be kept the more safely, King Numa commanded that they should make
  eleven other shields like unto it.) This shield and its fellows the Salii
  were to carry through the city, having on flowered tunics and breastplates of
  brass, and dancing and singing hymns. And many other things as to the worship
  of the gods, and the interpreting of signs, and the dealing with marvels and
  portents, King Numa set in order. And that the people might regard these laws
  and customs with the more reverence, he gave out that he had not devised them
  of his own wit, but that he had learnt them from a certain goddess whose name
  was Egeria, whom he was wont to meet in a grove that was hard by the
  city.</p>

  <p>King Numa died, having reigned forty and three years; and the people chose
  in his room one Tullus Hostilius.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap02"
     id="chap02">THE STORY OF ALBA</a></h2>

  <p>KING TULLUS HOSTILIUS, being newly come to the throne, looked about for an
  occasion of war; for the Romans had now for a long time been at peace. Now it
  chanced that in those days the men of Rome and the men of Alba had a quarrel,
  the one against the other, the country folk being wont to cross the border
  and to plunder their neighbors; and that ambassadors were sent from either
  city to seek restitution of such things as had been carried off. King Tullus
  said to his ambassador, "Delay not to do your business so soon as ye shall be
  come to Alba;" knowing that the men of Alba would certainly refuse to deliver
  up the things, and thinking that he could thus with a good conscience
  proclaim war against them. As for the ambassadors of Alba, when they were
  come to Rome, they made no haste about their business, but ate and drank, the
  King entertaining them with much courtesy and kindness. While therefore they
  feasted with him, there came back the ambassadors of Rome telling the King
  how they had made demand for the things carried off, and when the men of Alba
  had refused to deliver them, had declared war within the space of thirty
  days. Which when the King heard, he called to him the ambassadors of Alba,
  and said to them, "Wherefore are ye come to Rome? Set forth now your
  mission." Then the men, not knowing what had befallen, began to make excuse,
  saying, "We would not willingly say aught that should displease the King, but
  we are constrained by them that have sent us thither. We are come to ask for
  the things that your country folk have carried off. And, if ye will not
  deliver them up, we are bidden to declare war against you." To this Tullus
  made answer, "Now do I call the gods to witness that ye men of Alba first
  refused to repair the thing that has been done amiss, and I pray them that
  they will bring all the blood of this war upon your heads." And with this
  message the men of Alba went home.</p>

  <p>After this the two cities made great preparations for war. And because the
  men of Troy had built Lavinium, from which some going forth had set up the
  city of Alba, and from the royal house of Alba had come the founder of Rome,
  it was as though the children would fight against their fathers. Yet it came
  not to this, the matter being finished without a battle. The men of Alba
  first marched into the land of the Romans, having with them a very great
  army, and pitched their camp five miles from the city, digging about it a
  deep ditch. But while they lay in this camp their King Cluilius died, and a
  certain Mettus was made dictator in his room. Which when King Tullus heard,
  he became very bold, saying that the gods had smitten Cluilius for his
  wrong-doing, and would smite also the whole people of Alba. Whereupon he
  marched into the land of the Albans, leaving the enemy's camp to one side.
  And when these also had come forth against him, and the two armies were now
  drawn up in battle array, the one against the other, there came a messenger
  to King Tullus, saying that Mettus of Alba desired to have speech with him,
  having that to say to him which concerned the Romans not less than the men of
  Alba. Nor did King Tullus refuse to hear him, though indeed battle had
  pleased him better than speech. So when the King and certain nobles with him
  had gone forth into the open space that was between the two armies, and
  Mettus also with his companions had come to the same place, this last spake,
  saying, "I have heard King Cluilius that is dead affirm that your
  wrong-doing, ye men of Rome, in that ye would not deliver up the things that
  had been carried off, was the cause of this war; nor do I doubt but that
  thou, King Tullus, hast the same quarrel against us. Yet if we would speak
  that which is true rather than that which has a fair show, we should, I doubt
  not, confess that we, though we be both kinsmen and neighbors, are driven
  into this war by the lust of power. Now I say not whether this be just or no.
  Let others look to this; for I am not king of Alba, but captain of the host
  only. Yet there is a matter which I would fain call to thy mind, King. Thou
  knowest the Etruscans, how mighty they are both by land and sea; for indeed
  they are nearer by far to thee at Rome than to us at Alba. Bethink thee,
  therefore, how, when thou shalt give the signal of battle between thy army
  and our army, the same Etruscans will look on, rejoicing to see us fight
  together; and how, when the battle is ended, they will fall upon us, having
  us at disadvantage; for of a truth, whether ye or we prevail, we shall have
  but little strength remaining to us. If therefore we be not content with the
  freedom that we have, but must needs set on the chance of a die whether we
  shall be masters or servants, let us devise some way by which the one may win
  dominion over the other without great loss and shedding of blood." Now King
  Tullus was a great warrior, and would willingly have fought, being confident
  that he and his people would prevail; nevertheless the thing that Mettus of
  Alba had said pleased him. And when they came to consider the matter, there
  seemed by good fortune to be a way ready to their hands. There were in the
  army of Alba three brothers that had been born at one birth, whose name was
  Curiatius. And in the army of the Romans there were other three and these
  born likewise at one birth, whose name was Horatius. Nor was there much
  difference in respect either of age or of strength between the brothers of
  Alba and the brothers of Rome. Then King Tullus and Mettus of Alba called for
  the brothers, and inquired of them whether they were willing to fight each
  three for their own country, agreement being first made that that people
  should bear rule for ever whose champions should prevail in the battle. And
  as the young men were willing, a place was appointed for the battle and a
  time also. But first there was made a treaty in this fashion, for the fashion
  of making treaties is the same always, though their conditions be different.
  The herald said, "Wilt thou, King Tullus, that I make a treaty with the
  minister of the people of Alba?" And when the King answered "Yea," the herald
  said, "I will that thou give me the sacred herbs." Then the King made reply,
  "Take them, and see that they be clean." So the herald took them clean from
  the hill of the citadel. Having done this, he said to the King, "Dost thou
  appoint me to do the pleasure of the people of Rome, me and my implements and
  my attendants with me? And the King answered, "So that it be without damage
  to the people of Rome." Then the herald appointed one Spurius to be minister
  that he should take the oath, and touched his hair with the sacred herbs. And
  when Spurius had taken the oath, and the conditions of the treaty had been
  read aloud, he spake, saying, "Hear thou, Jupiter, and thou also, minister of
  the people of Alba, and ye men of Alba; as these conditions have been duly
  read aloud this day from the beginning even to the end from these tables, and
  after the interpretation by which they may be the most easily understood,
  even so shall the Roman people abide by them. And if this people, acting by
  common consent, shall falsely depart from them, then do thou, O Jupiter,
  smite the Roman people, even as I shall smite this swine to-day. And smite
  them by so much the more strongly as thou art stronger than I." And when he
  had said this he smote the swine with a knife of stone. The men of Alba also
  took the oath, and confirmed it after their own fashion. These things having
  been thus ordered, the champions made them ready for battle. And first their
  fellows exhorted them severally in many words, saying that the gods of their
  country, their countrymen also and kinsfolk, whether they tarried at home or
  stood in the field, regarded their arms that day; and afterward they went
  forth into the space that lay between the two armies. And these sat and
  watched them before their camps, being quit indeed of the peril of battle,
  but full of care how the matter should end, seeing that so great things, even
  sovereignty and freedom, should be decided by the valor and good luck of so
  few men. Then the signal of battle being given, the three met the three with
  such courage and fierceness as though there were a whole army on either side.
  And as their swords rang against each other and flashed, all men trembled to
  see, and could scarcely speak or breathe for fear of what should happen. And
  for a while, in so narrow a space did the men fight, nought could be seen but
  how they swayed to and fro, and how the blood ran down upon the ground. But
  afterward it was plain to see that of the three Romans two were fallen dead
  upon the ground, and that of the three champions of Alba each man was
  wounded. At this sight the Alban host shouted for joy, but the men of Rome
  had no more any hope but only fear to think what should befall their one
  champion that had now three enemies against him. Now, by good luck, it had so
  fallen out that this one had received no wound, so that, though he was no
  match for the three together, he did not doubt but that he should prevail
  over them severally one by one. Wherefore, that he might so meet them,
  dividing them the one from the other, he made a feint to fly, thinking that
  they would follow them each as quickly as his wound might suffer him. And so
  it fell out. For when he had fled now no small space from the ground where
  they had fought at the first, he saw, looking behind him, that the three were
  following him at a great distance one from the other, and that one was very
  near to himself. Then he turned himself and ran fiercely upon the man; and
  behold even while the men of Alba cried aloud to the two that they should
  help their brother, he had slain him, and was now running toward the second.
  And when the men of Rome saw what had befallen, they set up a great shout, as
  men are wont when they have good luck beyond their hopes; and their champion
  made such haste to do his part that or ever the third of the Alban three
  could come up, though indeed he was close at hand, he had slain the second
  also. And now, seeing that there remained one only on either side, there was
  in some sort an equality, yet were the two not equal either in hope or in
  strength. For the champion of Rome had suffered no wound, and having overcome
  his foes now once and again was full of courage; but the champion of Alba
  being now spent with his wound, and wearied also with running, was as it were
  vanquished already. Nor indeed was there a battle between the two; for the
  Roman cried, "One and another of my foes I have offered to the spirits of my
  brothers; but this third will I offer to the cause for which we have fought
  this day, even that Rome may have the dominion over Alba." And when the
  champion of Alba could now scarce bear up his shield, he stood over and ran
  his sword downward into his throat. Afterward as the man lay dead upon the
  ground, he spoiled him of his arms. Then did the men of Rome receive their
  champion with much rejoicing, having all the more gladness because they had
  been in so great fear. Afterward each host set themselves to bury their dead,
  whose tombs remain to this day, each in the spot where he fell, for the two
  Romans are buried in one sepulchre nearer to Alba, and the three champions of
  Alba as you go toward Rome, but with somewhat of space between them, even as
  they fought.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Horatii and the Curiatii.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Before the armies departed to their homes, Mettus of Alba inquired of
  Tullus what he would have him to do according to treaty. And the King
  answered, "Keep the young men under arms. I shall call for them if I have war
  against the men of Veii."</p>

  <p>And now the men of Rome went back to the city, and Horatius went before
  them, carrying the spoils of the three whom he had slain. But at the Capene
  gate there met him his sister, who was betrothed to one of the champions of
  Alba; and when the maiden saw upon his shoulders the cloak of her betrothed
  (and indeed she had wrought it with her own hands) she tore her hair and
  cried to the dead man by name with a lamentable voice. But Horatius was wroth
  to hear the words of mourning on the day when he had won so great a victory
  and the people rejoiced; and he drew his sword and slew the maiden, crying,
  "Depart hence to thy lover with the love that thou cherishest out of season;
  thou that forgettest thy brethren that are dead, and thy brother that is yet
  alive, and thine own people also. So perish whosoever shall make lamentations
  for an enemy of Rome." And when the Fathers and the Commons saw what was
  done, they thought it a wicked deed, but remembered what great service the
  man had newly rendered to Rome. Nevertheless they laid hands on him and took
  him to the King that he should judge him. But the King being loath to judge
  such a matter, or to give sentence against the man, said, "I appoint two men
  as the law commands, who shall judge Horatius for murder." Now the law was
  this: "If a man do murder, two men shall judge him; if he appeal against the
  two, let the appeal be tried; if their sentence be confirmed, ye shall cover
  his head and scourge him within the walls or without the walls, and hang him
  by a rope upon the gallows." Then there were appointed two men according to
  the law, who affirmed that they could not let the man go free, whether his
  guilt was small or great, seeing that he had manifestly done the deed.
  Therefore said one of them, "Publius Horatius, we adjudge thee to be guilty
  of murder. Go, lictor, bind his hands." But when the lictor came and was now
  ready to cast the rope about him, Horatius cried, "I appeal to the people;"
  for the King himself, being mercifully disposed to him, bade him do so. Then
  was there a trial before the people, in which that which most wrought upon
  the hearts of men was that the father of Horatius constantly affirmed that
  his daughter had been rightly slain. " Nay," said he, "verily, if the young
  man had not slain her, I had used against him my right as a father, and had
  condemned him to die." Then again he besought them that they should not leave
  him desolate and bereaved of his children, he who but the day before had had
  so fair a stock. Afterward, throwing his arms about the young man, he
  stretched out his hands to the spoils of the Curiatii, crying, "Will ye
  endure, men of Rome, to see him bound under the gallows and beaten with
  stripes whom ye beheld but yesterday adorned with these spoils and rejoicing
  in his victory? Not so. Surely the men of Alba themselves had not borne to
  see such a sight. Go, lictor, bind his hands, though but yesterday they won
  so great a dominion for the people of Rome. Go, cover the head of him that
  made this people free; hang him upon the accursed tree; scourge him, whether
  within the walls, so that thou do it among the spoils of them that he slew,
  or without the walls, so that fit be near to the sepulchres of the champions
  of Alba. Whither can ye take this youth that the memorials of his valor shall
  not save him from so foul a punishment?" And when the people saw the tears of
  the old man, and bethought them also what great courage the youth had shown
  in danger, they could not endure to condemn him; but regarding his valor
  rather than the goodness of his cause, let him go free. Only, because the
  deed had been so manifest, a command was laid upon the father that he should
  make a trespass offering for his son at the public charge. Then the father,
  having made certain sacrifices of expiation&mdash;which are performed to this
  day in the house of Horatius&mdash;set up a beam across the way and covered
  his son's head, and led him beneath it. As for the maiden, they built her
  tomb of hewn stone in the place where she was slain.</p>

  <p>Now the men of Alba were wroth to think that the fortunes of the whole
  people had been thus trusted to the hands of three soldiers; and Mettus,
  being of an unstable mind, was led away to evil in his desire to do them a
  pleasure. And as before he had sought for peace when others were desirous of
  war, so now he desired war when others were minded to be at peace. But
  because he knew that the men of Alba were not able of their own strength to
  do that which they desired, he stirred up certain others of the nations round
  about, that they should make war openly against Rome. As for himself and his
  people, he purposed that they should seem indeed to be friends and allies,
  but should be ready for treachery when occasion served. Thereupon the men of
  Fidenæ, being colonists from Rome, and the men of Veii promised that they
  would make war, and Mettus on his part promised that he would come over to
  them with his army in the battle. First the men of Fidenæ rebelled, and King
  Tullus marched against them, bidding Mettus come also with his army, and
  having crossed the river Anio, pitched his camp where Anio flows into Tiber.
  And by this time the men of Veii also had come up with their army, and these
  were on the right wing next to the river, and the men of Fidenæ on the left,
  next to the mountains. The ordering of King Tullus was that he and his men
  should do battle with the men of Veii, and Mettus and the Albans with the men
  of Fidenæ. Now Mettus, as he was not minded to do right, so had no courage to
  do wrong boldly; and because he dared not to go over to the enemy, led his
  men away slowly toward the mountains. Being come thither, he set out his men
  in battle array, being minded to join them whom he should perceive to
  prevail. At first the Romans marvelled that Mettus and his men should so
  depart from them and after a while they sent a messenger to the King, saying,
  "The men of Alba have left us." Then the King knew in his heart that there
  was treachery, and he vowed that he would build temples to Paleness and
  Panic, if he should win the victory that day. Nevertheless he showed no sign
  of fear, but cried to the horsemen with a loud voice, that the enemy might
  hear, saying, "Go thou back to the battle, and bid thy comrades be of good
  courage. Mettus does my bidding that he may take the men of Fidenæ in the
  rear." Also he bade the cavalry raise their spears in the air, that so the
  Romans might, for the most part, be hindered from seeing that the men of Alba
  had deserted them; and they that saw, believing what the King had said,
  fought with the more courage. Then there fell a great fear upon the enemy,
  for these also had heard the saying, which, being in the Latin tongue, was
  understood of the men of Fidenæ. They, therefore, fearing lest Mettus and the
  army of Alba should come down from the mountains and shut them off from their
  town, began to give ground. And when the King had broken their array, he
  turned the more fiercely on the men of Veii. These also fled before him, but
  were hindered from escape by the river. And some, throwing away their arms,
  ran blindly into the water, and some while they lingered on the bank, and
  knew not whether they should fight or fly, so perished. Never before had the
  Romans so fierce a fight with their enemies.</p>

  <p>After this the army of Alba came down from the mountains, and Mettus said
  to the King that he rejoiced that he had won so great a victory, and the King
  on his part spake friendly to him, and would have him join his camp with the
  camp of the Romans. Also he appointed a sacrifice of purification for the
  next day. And when it was day, all things being now ready after the custom of
  such sacrifices, the King commanded that both armies should be called to an
  assembly. And the heralds summoned the men of Alba first, so that they might
  be in the inner place; to which also they came of their own accord, for they
  sought to be near the King, greatly desiring to hear what he should say. And
  the King so ordered it to the end that the army of Rome might surround them
  on all sides. Also he gave his commands to certain captains of hundreds that
  they fulfil without delay whatsoever commands he should give them. After this
  the King spoke in this fashion, "Men of Rome, if ever before ye had occasion
  to give thanks for victory won, first to the immortal gods, and secondly to
  your own valor, such occasion ye found in the battle of yesterday. For ye
  fought not only with the enemy, but with that from which there is peril
  greater by far, even treachery in allies. I would not have you ignorant of
  the truth. It was not by any ordering of mine that the men of Alba went
  toward the mountains. I gave no such command; yet did I feign that I had
  given it to this end, that ye might not know that ye were deserted, and so
  might fight with the better courage, and that our enemies, thinking that they
  should be assailed from behind, might be stricken with fear and so fly before
  us. Yet I say not that all the men of Alba are guilty of this matter. They
  followed their captain, even as ye, men of Rome, would have followed me
  whithersoever I might have led you. Mettus only is guilty. He contrived this
  departure; even as he brought about this war, and brake the covenant that was
  between Alba and Rome. And what he hath done others may dare hereafter, if I
  do not so deal with him that he shall be an example for all that come after."
  Then the captains of hundreds, having arms in their hands, laid hold upon
  Mettus. After this the King spake again: "May the gods bless to the people of
  Rome, and to me, and to you also, men of Alba, that which I purpose to do.
  For my purpose is to carry away the people of Alba to Rome; the commons of
  Alba will I make citizens of Rome, and the nobles will I number among our
  Senators. So shall there be one city and one commonwealth." When the men of
  Alba heard these words, all had not the same mind about the matter, but all
  kept silence, fearing to speak, because being without arms they were
  compassed on every side with armed men.</p>

  <p>Then said the King, "Mettus, if indeed thou couldst learn faith and the
  keeping of treaties, I had suffered thee to live that thou mightest have such
  teaching from me. But now, seeing that thy disease is past healing, thou
  shalt teach other men to hold in reverence the holy things which thou hast
  despised. For even as thou wart divided in heart between Rome and Fidenæ, so
  shall thy body be divided." Then at the King's bidding, they brought two
  chariots, with four horses harnessed to each of them; and binding the body of
  Mettus to the chariots, they drave the horses divers ways so that the man was
  torn asunder.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile there had been sent horsemen to Alba who should bring the
  people to Rome; and now the army also was led thither that they might destroy
  the city utterly. Great sorrow was there in Alba that day, men knowing not
  for fear and grief what they should carry with them or leave behind. For a
  while, indeed, they wandered through their houses, knowing that they should
  not see them any more. But when the horsemen shouted to them that they should
  depart, and the crash of houses which men were now destroying began to be
  heard, and the dust rising up from the outskirts of the city covered all
  things as with a cloud, then they snatched up in haste each such things as
  they could, and so departed the home in which they had been born and bred.
  Very lamentable was their cry as they went, more especially of the women,
  when they saw armed men in the temples wherein they had been wont to worship,
  the very gods themselves being left, as it seemed, in captivity. And when the
  people were now gone forth from their city the Romans left not one stone upon
  another of all that was in the city; so that that which had been four hundred
  years in building (for so long had Alba endured) perished in one hour.
  Nevertheless they harmed not the temples, for so the King had commanded.</p>

  <p>But because Alba was thus brought to destruction, Rome increased greatly;
  for the number of the citizens was increased twofold. The C&oelig;lian hill
  was added to the city, in which hill, that others might the more readily
  dwell there, the King himself commanded that they should build him a palace.
  Also the chief houses of Alba, as the house of Julius and of Servilius, were
  chosen into the Senate; and that there might be a place of meeting for the
  Senate being thus multiplied, the King built a temple and called it Hostilia,
  after his own name. Also ten squadrons of horsemen were chosen out of the men
  of Alba.</p>

  <p>But after certain days, when the Romans had now conquered the Sabines, and
  had made treaties of peace with the Etrurians, and were in great peace and
  prosperity, they and their King, there was brought tidings to Rome that there
  had fallen a shower of stones on Mount Alba. Which when men could scarce
  believe, they sent messengers to learn if these things were true, who having
  come to Alba, found the stones lying on the ground, even as it had been hail.
  Also there was heard a voice from the grove that was on the top of the hill,
  saying, "Let the men of Alba do worship after the manner of their fathers;"
  for they having left their country, had left also their gods, and did worship
  after the, manner of the Romans, or for wrath at that which had befallen
  them, as is wont to be with men in such case, had ceased from worship
  altogether. The Romans also, by reason of this same voice that was heard on
  Mount Alba, or by warning of the soothsayers, kept a festival of nine days.
  And this became a custom for the time to come, that when there came tidings
  of such marvels to Rome, there was kept a like festival.</p>

  <p>Now the end of King Tullus was this. There came a pestilence upon the
  land. And when for this cause the people were wearied of war, nevertheless
  the King, both because he delighted in war, and because he believed that the
  young men should have better health if they went abroad than if they tarried
  at home, gave them no rest. But after a while he also fell into a tedious
  sickness, which so brake him both in body and mind that, whereas in time past
  he thought it unworthy of a King to busy himself with matters of religion,
  now he gave himself up wholly to superstition, and filled the minds of his
  people also with the like thoughts, so that they regarded nothing but this,
  how they should make atonement to the gods, and so be rid of their present
  distress. As for the King himself, men say that reading the sacred book of
  King Numa he found therein certain sacrifices, very secret and solemn, that
  should be done to Jupiter by such as would bring him down from heaven, and
  that he shut himself up to do these sacrifices; but because he set not about
  them rightly or did them not in due form, there appeared to him no similitude
  of the immortal gods (for such he had hoped to see); but Jupiter, having
  great wrath at such unlawful dealings, struck him with lightning and consumed
  both him and his house.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap03"
     id="chap03">THE STORY OF THE ELDER TARQUIN</a></h2>

  <p>DEMARATUS was lord of Corinth in the land of Greece. This Demaratus had a
  son who, having been driven from Corinth by strife among the citizens, came
  to Tarquinii that is in the land of Etruria, and dwelt there. And having
  married a wife, he had two sons born to him, Lucumo and Aruns. (It was the
  custom of the princes of the Etrurians to call the eldest son Lucumo and the
  younger Aruns.) This Lucumo, being very wealthy (for his father had left to
  him all his riches, his brother Aruns having died), took to wife a certain
  Tanaquil that was a noble lady in those parts. Now Tanaquil could not endure
  that any should be preferred before him, wherefore when the people of
  Tarquinii despised Lucumo, because he was the son of a stranger, Tanaquil
  could not endure it, and caring not for her country, if only she could see
  her husband held in honor, purposed to depart thence and dwell else where.
  And of all places Rome seemed to her the best, being a new country wherein
  men were honored for their deservings rather than for their birth, and he
  that should show himself brave and diligent would find occasion to win
  renown. So Numa, coming from Cures that is in the land of the Sabines, had
  been called to the kingdom. King Ancus also was born of a mother that was a
  Sabine, nor was noble at all save for his kinship to Numa. With these words
  she easily persuaded her husband, so that, gathering together all his
  possessions, he departed from Tarquinii to Rome. And when he came near to the
  city, at the hill that is called Janiculum, there happened to him this
  marvel. As he sat in the chariot with his wife, an eagle, having its wings
  stretched out, descended slowly upon him from the sky, and carried off the
  hat that was upon his head. Then for a while it flew over the chariot, making
  a great crying, and afterward, as it had been inspired to do this office, set
  it back upon his head and so vanished into the air. Now all the women of the
  Etrurians have great knowledge of augury (for so they call the signs and
  tokens of birds), and Tanaquil was of good courage when she saw what the
  eagle had done, and she embraced her husband, and bade him hope for great
  honors in Rome; for the bird, she said, had come from the sky, and the sign
  that it showed concerned the crown of a man, for it had taken from his head
  the glory that man's hand set upon it, that it might give it back to him from
  the gods. So Lucumo and Tanaquil his wife came to Rome, hoping to do great
  things; and the man dwelt there, giving out that his name was Tarquinius. And
  because he was a new comer and wealthy, men took the more note of him; also
  he would speak courteously to all men, and use much hospitality, and do such
  service as he could to them that had need of it. And after a while King Ancus
  heard of him, and made acquaintance with him, which acquaintance grew into
  friendship, till at the last, having found him faithful and ready in all that
  was put into his charge, whether at home or abroad, he appointed him to be
  guardian to his children.</p>

  <p>After this King Ancus died, having reigned twenty and four years, and left
  two sons, not yet old enough to reign, yet nearly grown to manhood. And some
  would have delayed the choosing of a king till these should be come to full
  age, but Tarquinius counselled that he should be chosen forthwith. And when
  the day for this choosing was appointed, having sent out the lads to hunt, he
  spake to the people after this manner. "This is no new thing that I seek the
  kingdom at your hands; for Tatius the Sabine became your king, having been
  before not a stranger only but also an enemy; and Numa also was called to
  this dignity; though he sought not for it. As for me, I came hither so soon
  as I was master of myself; and of the years of my manhood, I have lived in
  Rome more than in my own country; nor have I been ill taught the ways of a
  King, ministering to Ancus both at home and abroad."</p>

  <p>With these words he persuaded the people that they chose him to be king.
  Being so chosen he did many things that pleased the people; for having waged
  war with the Latins, and taken one of their cities and with it much booty, he
  built the great circus, and fetched horses and boxes from the land of Etruria
  to make sport. This became a custom year by year; and they called these games
  the Great Games of Rome.</p>

  <p>Afterward he would have compassed the city with a wall of stone; but while
  he was busy with the building of it the Sabines came upon him. And this they
  did with such speed that they had crossed the Anio before ever the Romans
  were ready to meet them; and when they fought many were slain on both sides,
  but neither had the victory. Now when the King, the enemy having returned to
  their camp, had space to consider how he might best make his army the
  stronger, it seemed that it would profit him most if he should increase the
  number of his horsemen, of whom there were three companies only. But when he
  was minded to add others to them, and to call them after his own name, one
  Attus Navius, that was a famous soothsayer in those days, withstood him.
  "For," said he, "King Romulus made these companies in due form, and thou
  mayest not add to their number, unless the gods permit, signifying their will
  by the voices of birds." But the King was wroth to hear these words, and
  mocked the soothsayer's art, saying, "Come now, thou wise man, divine unto
  me, can that which I think in my heart be done, or no?" Attus answered,
  having first made trial of his art, "Of a surety it can be done." Then said
  the King, "I thought this thing in my heart, that thou shouldst cut asunder
  this whetstone with a razor. Take it, therefore, and cut it asunder; for thy
  birds will have it that thou canst." And straightway Attus took the whetstone
  and cut it asunder. So they made a statue of him, standing with his head
  covered, in the place where the thing was done; even in the place of
  assembly, on the right hand of the steps by which a man goes up to the
  senate-house. And by his side they laid the stone to be a memorial of this
  miracle to them that should come after. Certainly there came such honor to
  the soothsayers that nothing thereafter was done at home or abroad except
  they first allowed it; and if an assembly of the people was called or the
  army gathered together, it must be dispersed again unless the birds should
  signify that it was according to the pleasure of the gods. King Tarquin,
  therefore, changed not the number or the name of the companies. Only he added
  to each as many more horsemen as it had at the first.</p>

  <p>After this there was yet another battle with the Sabines; and these fled
  before the Romans, the horsemen especially doing good service against them.
  And the King sent them that were taken captive and the booty to Rome; but the
  arms of those that were slain he made into a great heap, and burned them with
  fire, for he had vowed thus to Vulcan, that is the god of fire. And the King
  took Collatia, that is a town of the Sabines, from them, and afterward he
  subdued the whole nation of the Latins that it became obedient to Rome.</p>

  <p>They tell this story also of King Tarquin. There came to him one day a
  woman bearing twelve books, which she said were books of prophecies, wherein
  were written all things that should come to pass thereafter concerning the
  city of Rome. These books she would have sold to him. But because he knew not
  who she was, nor what she brought, and also because the price of the books
  seemed great out of measure, he would have none of them. Then the woman
  departed, and having burned three of the books with fire, brought back the
  nine that remained, and would sell them. And the price that she had demanded
  for the twelve, this she asked without abatement for the nine. And when the
  King would not buy, she departed and burned three more; and so returning
  would sell the six; but the price was that which she demanded for the twelve.
  Then the King, being greatly astonished, asked counsel of the priests and the
  soothsayers, and so bought the books. These were kept with great care and
  honor at Rome; and when in time to come there arose great need or peril in
  the city, then there were appointed men of repute who should open the books
  and learn what had best be done.</p>

  <p>In those days there happened, in the palace of the King, a great marvel.
  There was a certain slave boy whose name was Servius Tullius. The head of
  this boy, as he slept, was seen to burn with fire; and when the King and the
  Queen had been called to see this strange thing, and certain of the servants
  would have fetched water wherewith to quench the fire, Queen Tanaquil would
  not suffer them, but commanded that they should leave the child as he lay.
  And when he woke from his sleep, lo! the flame departed. Then said Queen
  Tanaquil to her husband, "Seest thou this boy whom we rear in this humble
  fashion? Know that he will be in time to come a light in our darkness and a
  succor to our house in its great trouble. Let us, therefore, use all favor
  and kindness to him." Thereafter they dealt with the lad as though he was
  free-born and not a slave, and gave him such teaching as befit them that are
  born to high place. The lad also, on his part, showed such parts and temper
  as befitted the house of a king; and when Tarquin would choose a husband for
  his daughter there was not found one fitter for such honor than Servius. So
  the King betrothed to him his daughter. Yet is it scarce to be believed that
  he would have done this thing if Servius had been indeed born of a
  bond-woman. Some say, therefore, and the story seems worthy of belief, that
  he was the son of a great lady of Corniculum, which was a town of the Latins;
  that this town being taken by King Tarquin, Servius Tullius, that was its
  chief ruler, was slain, whose wife, being with child, was carried to Rome;
  and that because she was of noble birth, she was not sold into slavery with
  the other women but taken into the King's palace, and there bare this child,
  of whom, because his mother had been taken captive in war, men said that he
  was the son of a slave.</p>

  <p>Now the sons of Ancus, since they had been grown to manhood, had taken it
  ill that Tarquin had been preferred before them to the throne of their
  father, and now they were the more angry, seeing how he had chosen another
  than them to be King after him. "See now," they said, "this fellow that is
  not a Roman nay, nor an Italian, but a stranger from Greece, how being made
  tutor to us by the King our father, he filched the throne from us by craft,
  and now handeth it over to one that is the son of a bond-woman. Surely this
  is a shameful thing for this city and people. For the kingdom of Romulus,
  that is now a god in heaven, will pass within the space of a hundred years to
  one that is a slave."</p>

  <p>And first they would avenge themselves on King Tarquin. This they did
  after this fashion. They chose them two shepherds, the fiercest of their
  company, and caused them to come, carrying crooks of iron, after their
  custom, within the King's palace; who, so soon as they were come within the
  porch, made as if they had a grievous quarrel the one against the other, and
  cried out that the King should be the judge between them; for in those days
  kings were wont to perform the office of a judge. So they that kept order in
  the palace brought them before the King. At the first they made both of them
  a great uproar, crying out against each other; but afterward, when the beadle
  bade them be quiet if they would be heard of the King, bare themselves in
  more orderly fashion. Then the first began to tell his story; but when the
  King turned to him, and was wholly given up to hearing what the man might
  say, the other dealt him a great blow upon the head with the iron which he
  carried. And when he had done this he left the iron where it was, and hasted,
  he and his companion with him, to escape by the door. Then some of the
  ministers of the court caught the King as he fell ready to die upon the
  ground, and others laid hold on the murderers and hindered them from
  escaping. At the same time much people ran together to the place, wondering
  what new thing had happened. But Queen Tanaquil gave command that they should
  shut the doors of the palace, and would have none remain within but her own
  folk. And first she prepared with all diligence such things as might be
  serviceable in the dressing of the wound, making as if there were some hope
  that the King might yet live; and next she devised how, this hope failing
  her, things might nevertheless be ordered according to her wish. Sending,
  therefore, for Servius in all haste, she pointed to the King, as he lay now
  ready to die, and spake, saying, "Servius, my son, this kingdom is thine if
  thou wilt only show thyself a man. Neither shall it go to them who have done
  this wicked deed, albeit not by their own hands. Rouse thyself, therefore,
  and follow the leading of the gods, who in days past, showed that thy head
  should bear great honor by the fire from heaven which they caused to shine
  round about it. Let that fire stir thee this day. Nor do thou take account of
  thy birth. For we also were strangers to this city and yet have borne rule
  therein. Bethink thee, therefore, what manner of man thou art, rather than of
  whom thou wast born. And if perchance thine own counsels are troubled at so
  grievous a chance, be thou obedient unto mine."</p>

  <p>After this, as the people without the palace cried aloud and would have
  thrust in the doors, the Queen went to an upper chamber and spake to the
  multitude through a window that looked upon the New Street (for the palace of
  the King stood hard by the temple of Jupiter the Stayer). "Be of good courage
  and hope," she said; "the king was stunned by the suddenness of the blow, but
  the iron entered not deep into the flesh, and he came speedily to himself.
  Now we have washed off the blood and looked into the wound. All is well. Be
  of good cheer, therefore, and believe that before many days be past ye shall
  see the King. Meanwhile, render due obedience to Servius, who will do justice
  between man and man in the room of the King and order all else that shall be
  needed." So Servius came forth to the people, wearing the royal robe, with
  the men that bare the axes after him; and sitting down on the throne of the
  King, heard the causes of them that sought for justice, giving judgment in
  some things, and in others making mention that he would consult King Tarquin.
  This he did for many days, none knowing that the King was dead, and
  established himself in power, while he made as if he were administering the
  power of another. And when Queen Tanaquil thought that the due time was come,
  she gave out that King Tarquin was dead, and commanded that mourning should
  be made for him according to custom. And Servius, coming forth with his
  guards about him, was proclaimed King; only at the first the Senate alone,
  and not the people, consented. As for the sons of Ancus, when they heard that
  the murderers had been taken, and that the King was yet alive, and that
  Servius also was so well established in his power, they fled to the town of
  Suessa Pometia.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap04"
     id="chap04">THE STORY OF SERVIUS</a></h2>

  <p>AND now Servius thought to establish himself in his kingdom. And first of
  all, lest the sons of King Tarquin should so regard him as the son of Ancus
  had regarded King Tarquin, he gave his daughters in marriage to the two young
  men (for King Tarquin had left two sons, Lucius and Aruns by name). Nor yet
  did the counsels of man avail to change the decree of fate, that there should
  rise up against the King foes from out of his own household, as, indeed, will
  be shown hereafter. Yet for a while all things went peaceably. First the King
  got himself great renown in a war with the men of Veii, with whom the truce
  had expired by lapse of time. These he put to flight with great slaughter,
  and so returning to Rome was manifestly acknowledged not by the Senators
  only, but was also by the people.</p>

  <p>And now he set about the work of ordering the state, dividing the citizens
  according to their birth and to that which they possessed. First of all he
  put the Senators, and after them such as served in the wars on horseback, and
  these he called knights. And the rest of the people he divided into classes
  according to the armor with which they were able to furnish themselves for
  war. The first class were they that had one hundred thousand pounds of brass
  or more; and these had for armor a helmet, a long shield, a cuirass, and
  greaves upon their legs, of brass all of them, and for warfare a spear and a
  sword. In this class there were eighty companies of a hundred, forty of the
  elders that should defend the city, and of the younger that should go and
  fight abroad forty also. The next class to these had a short shield for a
  long, and lacked the cuirass; and after these another that had the same arms,
  only wanting the greaves. The fourth class had nothing of armor, and for
  weapons a spear and a javelin; and the fifth slings and stones. These last
  were such as had eleven thousand pounds of brass; as for such as had less
  they were free from service in war. When this ordering was finished, he
  commanded that the people should assemble themselves on the field of Mars;
  and when their number was counted, it was found that they were eighty
  thousand in all.</p>

  <p>King Servius also was minded to enlarge his kingdom by including within it
  the nations round about, seeking to do this not by arms so much as by
  counsel. And first he joined the Latins to the Romans, contriving the matter
  in this fashion. There was in those days a famous temple of Diana at Ephesus
  which the cities of Asia had joined together in building. Now King Servius
  would often speak of this thing to the Princes of Latium, to whom, indeed, he
  was careful to use much hospitality, declaring how noble and excellent a
  thing it was that they who dwelt in the same land should have their gods also
  and worship in common. And when he had ofttimes used much argument to this
  purpose, at the last he persuaded them that the cities of Latium should join
  together with men of Rome and build a temple to Diana, and that this temple
  should be at Rome, whereby it was confessed that Rome was the chief city.</p>

  <p>As for the Sabines this same end was brought about in a different fashion.
  There was a certain householder of this nation that had born upon his farm a
  heifer of marvellous greatness and beauty. How great it was might be seen
  from the horns of the beast which hung in the front of Diana's temple for
  many generations. Now the birth of this great creature was counted for a
  portent; and the prophets prophesied that the rule should belong to that
  nation whose citizens should offer it in sacrifice to Diana; and this
  prophecy came to the ears of Diana's priest. The Sabine therefore, so soon as
  a fitting day for sacrifice was come, brought the great heifer to the temple
  at Rome and set it before the altar. And when the priest saw it he perceived
  from its greatness that it was the beast of which the prophets had spoken.
  Therefore knowing what they had said he spake to the man, saying, "Friend,
  what is this that thou art minded to do? Wilt thou do sacrifice to Diana
  profanely, not having first cleansed thyself? See now where the Tiber flows
  in the valley beneath, Do thou therefore bathe thyself therein and so offer
  thy sacrifice." And when the man, being very scrupulous to do all things in
  order that the thing might have its due fulfilment, went down to this river,
  the priest took the heifer and offered it up to the goddess. This thing was
  marvellously pleasing to King Servius and to all the people.</p>

  <p>The King, having now enlarged his borders, divided the land which had been
  taken from the enemy man by man among the people; and feared not, having
  gained their hearts by this bounty, to ask them, being gathered together in
  assembly, "Is it your pleasure that I should reign over you?" To which
  question there was given such assent as no king before him had received.
  Nevertheless the son of King Tarquin ceased not to cherish in his heart the
  hope of the kingdom; to which hope, indeed, he was the more stirred up by
  Tullia his wife. For now there sprang up in the palace of the kings of Rome a
  monstrous growth of wickedness, to the end, it may well be believed, that the
  people might, for hatred of kingship and its way, come the earlier to love
  liberty.</p>

  <p>Now King Tarquin had two sons, this Lucius of whom mention has been made,
  a haughty and violent man, and another, Aruns by name, that was of a quiet
  and gentle temper. And as they differed the one from the other, so also did
  their wives, the daughters of King Servius; and it so fell out that she that
  had the fiercer temper of the two, a certain Tullia, was married to Aruns,
  and she that was gentle to Lucius. Now it vexed Tullia to the heart that her
  husband was of so peaceable a spirit, so that in the end she despised him,
  and looked to his brother as being the more worthy to be her husband. And the
  end of the matter was this, that Lucius and Tullia plotted together this
  great wickedness, that he should rid himself of his wife and she should rid
  herself of her husband. And this they did; and then the two being thus in
  evil fashion made one, Lucius took Tullia to wife, the King not hindering the
  thing, though indeed he approved it not. And now did this wicked woman
  increase day by day her rage and fury against the King her father. For having
  done one evil deed she began to compass others; nor would she suffer her
  husband to rest, stirring him up to all wickedness, and speaking to him in
  such fashion as this: "Truly I had a husband that pleased me well had I been
  content to serve together with him. But the husband that I looked for was one
  that should think himself worthy to be a king, that should remember that he
  was a son of King Tarquin, that should choose rather to have the crown in
  possession than to hope for it hereafter. Such an one I thought to find in
  thee; and if I thought right, then truly I call thee true husband and King,
  but if not, then I count myself to have suffered loss, seeing that thou art
  not a coward only, but also blood-guilty. Be up and doing, therefore. Thou
  hast not, as had thy father, to come from Corinth, or even from Tarquinii, to
  win for himself a kingdom among strangers. All things that are about thee
  mark thee out for kingship, to which, if thou judge thyself unequal, then
  depart from this place where thou seemest to be that which thou art not."</p>

  <p>With such words did Tullia daily stir up her husband; thinking shame to
  herself, if so be Tanaquil, who was a foreigner, had been able to make two
  kings, first her husband and then her son-in-law, she, being the daughter of
  a king, could not accomplish as much. Then did Lucius begin to seek favor
  among the nobles, especially such as were of the lesser houses, and so
  ambitious of higher place in the State. Some he would remind of kindnesses
  that his father had done them in past time, and would ask for a like return;
  and to some he would promise gifts; and all he sought to turn against the
  King. And at the last, when it now seemed time to make his venture, he burst
  into the market- place, having with him a company of armed men; and all that
  stood near being so stricken with dismay that they hindered him not,
  commanded the herald that he should call the Senators to meet King Tarquin.
  Nor did the Senators, being thus summoned, refuse to come, for some had been
  won over to the young man beforehand, and others feared that they should
  suffer harm if they came not, for the matter was altogether beyond their
  expectation; also they thought that King Servius had already perished. And
  when they were assembled, Tarquin sat down upon the throne and spake in some
  such fashion as this: "The slave that was the son of a slave-woman seized the
  kingdom when the King my father had been shamefully slain. Neither was there
  any assembly held for election; nor did the people give their votes for him,
  nor did the Senate confirm the matter. By none of these things doth he
  possess this great dignity, but by the bounty of a woman. And now he, being
  such an one as he is, favors the lowest of the people, to whom he divideth
  this land, which is of right the possession of the nobles; in like manner the
  burdens which at one time were borne in common by all, he putteth upon you;
  and this ordering of the citizens that he hath lately established, for what
  purpose is it but that he may know who hath aught, that he may make
  distribution to the needy?"</p>

  <p>While he thus spake there came in King Servius, having been fetched by a
  messenger in hot haste, and cried with a loud voice from the porch of the
  senate-house, "What doest thou here, Tarquin? How darest thou, while I am yet
  alive, to call the Senators together and to sit upon my throne?"</p>

  <p>To which Tarquin made answer, "This throne is the throne of the King my
  father, of which I, being the son of a king, am worthier than thou that art
  the son of a slave. Surely now thou hast long enough triumphed over them that
  are by right thy masters."</p>

    <p class="caption">Tullia driving over the body of her father.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>After this there was a great shouting and tumult, some favoring Servius
  and some Tarquin; and the people ran together into the senate-house; and it
  was manifest that he that should prevail in that conflict would possess the
  kingdom. Then Tarquin, thinking that having ventured so much he must dare all
  things, laid hands on King Servius and cast him down the steps of the senate-
  house into the market-place. Then they that accompanied the King, that is to
  say his ministers and guards, were stricken with fear and fled, and Servius
  himself, seeking to return to the palace, and having now reached the end of
  the street of Cyprus, was overtaken by them that Tarquin had sent to pursue
  him, and there slain. And men say that this was done at the bidding of
  Tullia; and indeed it agrees with the other wickedness of this woman. That
  she rode in her carriage into the market-place, and, fearing not to come into
  the assembly of men, called forth her husband from the senate-house, and
  before all others saluted him as King&mdash;all this is known for certain.
  And when he bade her depart to her home, and she had come to the top of the
  street of Cyprus, and would turn aside to the Esquiline hill, he that drave
  the horses drew back the rein and tarried, showing to his mistress the body
  of Servius where it lay in the street. Then did she a wicked deed, whereof
  there remains a memorial to this day, in that men call the street the Wicked
  Street, for she drave her carriage over the body of her father, and so went
  on to her house, having the blood of her father upon her wheels, aye, and
  upon her own garments. And as the reign of King Tarquin began with blood,
  even so also did it end.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap05"
     id="chap05">THE STORY OF BRUTUS</a></h2>

  <p>LUCIUS TARQUIN, having thus seized the kingdom (for he had not the consent
  either of the Senators or of the Commons to his deed), bare himself very
  haughtily, so that men called him Tarquin the Proud. First, lest some other,
  taking example by him, should deal with him as he had dealt with Tullius, he
  had about him a company of armed men for guards. And because he knew that
  none loved him, he would have them fear him. To this end he caused men to be
  accused before him. And when they were so accused, he judged them by himself,
  none sitting with him to see that right was done. Some he slew unjustly, and
  some he banished, and some he spoiled of their goods. And when the number of
  the Senators was greatly diminished by these means (for he laid his plots
  mostly against the Senators, as being rich men and the chief of the State),
  he would not choose any into their place, thinking that the people would
  lightly esteem them if there were but a few of them. Nor did he call them
  together to ask their counsel, but ruled according to his own pleasure,
  making peace and war, and binding treaties or unbinding, with none to gainsay
  him.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, for a while he increased greatly in power and glory. He made
  alliance with Octavius Mamilius, prince of Tusculum, giving him his daughter
  in marriage; nor was there any man greater than Mamilius in all the cities of
  the Latins; and Suessa Pometia, that was a city of the Volsci, he took by
  force, and finding that the spoil was very rich (for there were in it forty
  talents of gold and silver), he built with the money a temple to Jupiter on
  the Capitol, very great and splendid, and worthy not only of his present
  kingdom but also of that great Empire that should be thereafter. Also he took
  the city of Gabii by fraud, as shall now be told.</p>

  <p>The manner of his fraud was this. He made as if he had changed his purpose
  about the city, leading away his army from before it, and busying himself
  with laying the foundations of the Temple of Jupiter and other like things.
  But while he did this, Sextus, that was the youngest of his three sons, fled
  to Gabii, as if he were a deserter from the army of his father, and
  complained grievously to the men of the city of the cruelty which the King
  had used toward him. "Surely now," he said, "my father has turned away his
  fury from others upon them that are of his own household; and that same
  solitude which he has made in the Senate he would have also in his own home,
  being so jealous of his kingdom that he will not have any near him that shall
  inherit it. As for myself I barely escaped with my life from them that would
  have slain me by his command; nor do I count myself safe except among such as
  are enemies to the King. As for you, think not that he has given up his
  purpose concerning you. He only waits an occasion when he may take you
  unawares." The men of Gabii, when they heard these words, received the young
  man kindly and bade him be of good cheer, for that they would defend him from
  his father. They said also that they counted themselves fortunate to gain
  such help, knowing him to be brave and skillful in war, and that doubtless,
  with his aid, they should soon carry the war from their own city even to the
  walls of Rome. After this, when the young man had gone, not once only but
  many times, with the young men of Gabii, making war against the Romans and
  plundering their country, and had always fared well, putting the enemy to
  flight and bringing back much spoil (and, indeed, things were so ordered by
  the King that it should be so), the people of Gabii were persuaded that he
  was dealing honestly with them, and chose him to be the captain of their
  host. After this, when he found that he could now do all things at his
  pleasure in Gabii, he sent a messenger to the King his father, desiring to
  know what he would have him do. To this messenger the King, doubting whether
  the man was faithful, gave no answer by word of mouth, but rose up from his
  place and walked in the garden that was by the palace, having the look of one
  that took deep counsel with himself. And as he walked he smote off the heads
  of the tallest poppies that were in the garden with a staff that he had in
  his hand, but spake never a word. At the last, the messenger being wearied
  out with the asking of a question to no purpose, departed, thinking that he
  had now fulfilled his errand. And when he came to Gabii he told to Sextus
  what he had seen; "only," he said, "the King your father, whether for anger
  or for haughtiness, spake not one word." But Sextus knew right well what his
  father would have him do. For he set himself to overthrow the chief men of
  the city. Some he accused to the people; and against some he took occasion of
  offence given to the Commons. Some were put to death publicly, and others, to
  whose charge nothing could be laid, were slain by secret violence. Others
  again were suffered to go of their own accord into banishment; and the goods
  of all, whether they were slain or banished, were divided among the Commons;
  nor did these, being blinded by the desire of gain, perceive what damage the
  State suffered, till Gabii, having lost all its rulers and counsellors, fell
  into the hands of the Romans without so much as a battle. By such means did
  King Tarquin increase his power.</p>

  <p>Now there was at Rome in the days of Tarquin a noble youth, by name Lucius
  Junius, who was akin to the house of Tarquin, seeing that his mother was
  sister to the King. This man, seeing how the King sought to destroy all the
  chief men in the state (and, indeed, the brother of Lucius had been so
  slain), judged it well so to bear himself that there should be nothing in him
  which the King should either covet or desire. Wherefore he feigned
  foolishness, suffering all that he had to be made a prey; for which reason
  men gave him the name of Brutus, or the foolish. Then he bided his time,
  waiting till the occasion should come when he might win freedom for the
  people.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced that King Tarquin, being disturbed by the marvel of a great
  snake, which had been seen of a sudden to glide from the altar in his house,
  sent messengers to Delphi to inquire of the god what this thing might mean.
  And because he cared not that any strangers should hear the answer of the
  oracle, he sent his own sons, Titus and Aruns, and with them, to bear them
  company, or rather as one of whom they might make sport, this same Lucius
  Brutus. And when the young men offered gifts to the god, Brutus offered gold
  hidden away in a stick that had been hollowed to receive it; meaning thereby
  a parable of himself, as of a light hidden beneath that which seemed dull and
  of little worth. Now when the sons of the King had fulfilled the commands of
  their father, there came upon them a desire to inquire of the god which of
  them should be king in time to come. Whereupon there came forth from the
  depths of the cave this voice: "Know, O young men, that he of you who shall
  first give a kiss to his mother, shall bear the chief rule hereafter at
  Rome." When the sons of the King heard these words they would have their
  brother Sextus, who had been left behind at Rome, know nothing of the matter,
  lest he also should have a hope of the kingdom. Wherefore they agreed among
  themselves that the matter should be kept secret, and that they should leave
  to the casting of lots which of the two should first give a kiss to his
  mother. But Brutus judged that the answer of the god had another
  signification than this. Therefore, so soon as they were come out of the
  temple, he made as if he stumbled, and falling on his face, he kissed the
  earth, holding that the earth was his mother, being indeed the common mother
  of us all.</p>

  <p>Not many days after these things there came to Brutus an occasion of
  showing what manner of man he was. Sextus, the King's son, did so grievous a
  wrong to Lucretia, that was the wife of Collatinus, that the woman could not
  endure to live, but slew herself with her own hand. But before she died she
  called to her husband and her father and Brutus, and bade them avenge her
  upon the evil house of Tarquin. And when her father and her husband sat
  silent for grief and fear, Brutus drew the knife wherewith she slew herself
  from the wound, and held it before him dripping with blood, and cried aloud,
  "By this blood I swear, calling the gods to witness, that I will pursue with
  fire and sword and with all other means of destruction Tarquin the proud,
  with his accursed wife and all his race; and that I will suffer no man
  hereafter to be king in this city of Rome." And when he had ended he bade the
  others swear after the same form of words. This they did and, forgetting
  their grief, thought only how they might best avenge this great wrong that
  had been done.</p>

  <p>First they carried the body of Lucretia, all covered with blood, into the
  market-place of Collatia (for these things happened at Collatia), and roused
  all the people that saw a thing so shameful and pitiful, till all that were
  of an age for war assembled themselves carrying arms. Some of them stayed
  behind to keep the gates of Collatia, that no one should carry tidings of the
  matter to the King, and the rest Brutus took with him with all the speed that
  he might to Rome. There also was stirred up a like commotion, Brutus calling
  the people together and telling them what a shameful wrong the young Tarquin
  had done. Also he spake to them of the labors with which the King wore them
  out in the building of temples and palaces and the like, so that they who had
  been in time past the conquerors of all the nations round about were now come
  to be but as hewers of wood and drawers of water. Also he set before them in
  what shameful sort King Tullius had been slain, and how his daughter had
  driven her chariot over the dead body of her father. With suchlike words he
  stirred up the people to great wrath, so that they passed a decree that there
  should be no more kings in Rome, and that Lucius Tarquin with his wife and
  his children should be banished. After this Brutus made haste to the camp and
  stirred up the army against the King. And in the meanwhile Queen Tullia fled
  from her palace, all that saw her cursing her as she went. As for King
  Tarquin, when he came to the city he found the gates shut against him;
  thereupon he returned and dwelt at Cære that is in the land of Etruria, and
  two of his sons with him; but Sextus going to Gabii, as to a city which he
  had made his own, was slain by the inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The King and his house being thus driven out, Brutus was made consul with
  one Collatinus for his colleague. First he bound the people by an oath that
  they would never thereafter suffer any man to be King at Rome; and afterward,
  because Collatinus was of the name and lineage of Tarquin, he wrought with
  them that he also should be banished from the city. "These Tarquins," he
  said, "are overmuch accustomed to kingship. For Tarquin the elder reigned in
  Rome, and though after him another, even Servius, was king, yet did not his
  son forget the kingdom of his father, but took it for his own. And now this
  Collatinus Tarquin bears rule in the city, whose very name, seeing that they
  of his house know not how to be subject unto others, has in it great danger
  to liberty." When he had wrought on the minds of the people with these words,
  he called the people to an assembly, and spake to them thus: "Ye have sworn
  that ye will suffer no man to be king at Rome, nor endure aught which may
  bring liberty into peril. Now this that I am about to say, I say against my
  will, speaking against a man that is dear to me, nor indeed had I said it but
  that my love for my country prevailed over all other things. The Roman people
  are not assured in their heart that they have won liberty in very deed and
  truth, knowing that they who are of the house and lineage of the King not
  only dwell in this State, but even bear rule in it. Do thou, therefore,
  Collatinus, remove this fear from the heart of thy countrymen. We deny not
  that thou didst drive away the kings. Complete therefore this thy good deed,
  even by taking away from this city a name which is the name of kings. All
  that thou hast we will duly render thee; nay more, if thou lackest anything,
  we will supply it bountifully. Depart therefore as a friend might depart; for
  though this fear be idle, yet it troubles thy countrymen who think that they
  shall not be quit of kingship till they be quit of all that bear a king's
  name."</p>

  <p>To these words Collatinus at the first could answer nothing, so astonished
  was he at the matter; and afterward, when he would have spoken, the chief men
  of the State came round, entreating that he would hearken to Brutus. So when
  he had considered the thing for a space, he consented, fearing lest when he
  should be no longer Consul, the same might happen to him, together also with
  loss of his goods and much wrong to himself. Wherefore he abdicated his
  office and departed with all that he had to Lanuvium. After this Brutus
  caused that the people passed a law that all of the house of Tarquin should
  be banished for ever.</p>

  <p>That the King would seek to come back by force of arms none doubted. But
  while he delayed, as indeed he did delay beyond the expectation of all,
  liberty was well-nigh lost by treachery and treason. There were among the
  youth of Rome certain young nobles that had been wont to live as companions
  with the King's son with much license and luxury, after the fashion of
  courts. These men, now that all citizens had equal rights, loudly complained
  among themselves that other men's freedom had turned to their own bondage.
  "It pleaseth us well," said they, "to have a king, for he is a man even as we
  are, from whom we may ask and obtain what we will, be it right or wrong, who
  can have a favor and do kindness, can be angry or have compassion, whereas
  laws are deaf and not to be turned by prayers, being better forsooth for the
  poor than for the rich."</p>

  <p>While they thought these things in their hearts there chanced to come
  ambassadors from King Tarquin. These made no mention of the matter whether
  the King should return, but asked only that his goods should be restored to
  him. To these the Senate gave audience; and when they had heard them were not
  a few days in debating the matter, for they said, "If we give not back these
  goods, there is open cause for war; and if we give them back, we minister
  means by which war may be carried on." In the meanwhile the ambassadors,
  making pretence to concern themselves only about the goods of the King,
  plotted in secret how they might bring him back. Going about therefore among
  the young nobles as if they would bespeak their favor on behalf of their
  errand, they made trial of what temper they were as to the bringing back of
  the King, and when they found that their words were not ill taken, they gave
  them certain tokens that they had brought from Tarquin, and had converse how
  the gates might be opened to him by night. And the matter was put in charge
  of certain noblemen, brothers, whose sister Brutus had to wife, and of this
  marriage there had been born to Brutus two sons that were now grown to
  manhood; and these young men had knowledge of the plot from the brethren of
  their mother. After a while the Senate passed a decree that the goods of the
  King should be given back to him; and the ambassadors made excuse to tarry
  yet longer, asking time of the Consul that they find wagons sufficient to
  carry the goods. This time they spent wholly in consulting with them that
  were privy to the plot, being urgent with them that they should give them a
  letter to carry to the King, "for," said they, "who will believe us if we
  bring not some written testimony in a matter so grave?" So the conspirators
  gave them a letter and thereby made manifest proof of their guilt. For a
  certain slave had conceived some suspicion of the matter, but waited for some
  more certain knowledge. Now it fell out that on the night before the day when
  the ambassador should depart there was a banquet at the house of them that
  had chief charge of the matter in Rome, at which banquet there was much talk,
  none being present but such as were privy to the plot. But the slave of whom
  mention has been made, having hidden himself, overheard that which was said;
  and when he knew that the letter had been given, he carried the matter
  straightway to the Consuls, who going laid hands on the ambassadors and on
  them that were privy to the plot, and so without uproar or violence brought
  the matter to an end. They that would have betrayed their country were thrown
  straightway into prison; as for the ambassadors, men doubted awhile how they
  should deal with them; but judged it better to send them away unhurt for all
  their misdoing. About the King's goods counsel was taken anew; and the Senate
  decreed that neither should they be given back, nor should the price of them
  be brought into the treasury, but rather that the people should spoil them at
  their will. This having been done, the conspirators were brought to judgment,
  and being condemned, suffered death, being first beaten with rods and then
  beheaded. Now the Consuls' office was that, sitting in their seats, they
  should see sentence executed on evil doers. And this they did, nor did Brutus
  turn away from his duty, for all that his own sons were done to death before
  his eyes, but sat in his place, seeing that all things were done according to
  the law. As for the slave that bare witness against the conspirators, he had
  freedom and citizenship for his reward.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>The end of Brutus was this. The men of Veii and the men of Tarquinii
  gathered together their armies and marched against Rome, that they might
  bring back King Tarquin. And the Romans came forth to meet them, Valerius
  having command of the foot soldiers and Brutus riding before with the
  horsemen. In the host of the enemy also the horsemen had the first place,
  their leaders being Aruns son of King Tarquin. And the lictors told Aruns,
  while they were yet far off, "See there is Brutus the Consul," who himself
  also, when the armies were now near together, knew the face of the man. Then
  he cried aloud in great wrath, "Lo, there is the man that hath driven us
  forth into banishment. See how proudly he goeth, bearing the honors that by
  good right are ours. Now may the gods that avenge the wrongs of kings be with
  me that I may slay him." So he struck spurs into his horse, and when Brutus
  saw that Aruns came against him he made haste to meet him. (In those days
  they that led armies into battle held it to be to their honor themselves to
  do battle.) And so full of fury were these two that neither took any thought
  how he might defend himself, but each smote the other through the body with
  his spear, so that they fell dying both of them from their horses.</p>

  <p>After this there was fought a great battle, neither side having the
  victory, for when the men of Veii fled before the Romans, the men of
  Tarquinii prevailed against them that stood over against them. Nevertheless
  in the night a great panic fell upon the army of the Etrurians, so that they
  departed and went to their homes. Also they say that there was heard a voice
  from the grave of the hero Horatius, saying, "There fell in this battle more
  in number by one of the Etrurians than of the Romans; therefore the Romans
  are conquerors." When it was now day there was not a man of the Etrurians in
  his place; so Valerius the consul gathered together the spoil and returned in
  great triumph to Rondo, Also he made a great burial for Brutus; and the
  people also mourned greatly for him, the women lamenting him for the space of
  a whole year, even as is the custom for women to lament for a father or a
  brother. And this they did because he had avenged the wrong done to a woman
  in so noble a fashion.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap06"
     id="chap06">THE STORY OF LARS PORSENNA</a></h2>

  <p>KING TARQUIN and his son Lucius (for he only remained to him of the three)
  fled to Lars Porsenna, king of Clusium, and besought him that he would help
  them. "Suffer not," they said, "that we, who are Tuscans by birth, should
  remain any more in poverty and exile. And take heed also to thyself and thine
  own kingdom if thou permit this new fashion of driving forth kings to go
  unpunished. For surely there is that in freedom which men greatly desire, and
  if they that be kings defend not their dignity as stoutly as others seek to
  overthrow it, then shall the highest be made even as the lowest, and there
  shall be an end of kingship, than which there is nothing more honorable under
  heaven." With these words they persuaded King Porsenna, who judging it well
  for the Etrurians that there should be a king at Rome, and that king an
  Etrurian by birth, gathered together a great army and came up against Rome.
  But when men heard of his coming, so mighty a city was Clusium in those days,
  and so great the fame of King Porsenna, there was such fear as had never been
  before. Nevertheless they were steadfastly purposed to hold out. And first
  all that were in the country fled into the city, and round about the city
  they set guards to keep it, part thereof being defended by walls, and part,
  for so it seemed, being made safe by the river. But here a great peril had
  well-nigh overtaken the city; for there was a wooden bridge on the river by
  which the enemy had crossed but for the courage of a certain Horatius Cocles.
  The matter fell out in this wise.</p>

  <p>There was a certain hill which men called Janiculum on the side of the
  river, and this hill King Porsenna took by a sudden attack. Which when
  Horatius saw (for he chanced to have been set to guard the bridge, and saw
  also how the enemy were running at full speed to the place, and how the
  Romans were fleeing in confusion and threw away their arms as they ran), he
  cried with a loud voice, "Men of Rome, it is to no purpose that ye thus leave
  your post and flee, for if ye leave this bridge behind you for men to pass
  over, ye shall soon find that ye have more enemies in your city than in
  Janiculum. Do ye therefore break it down with axe and fire as best ye can. In
  the meanwhile I, so far as one man may do, will stay the enemy." And as he
  spake he ran forward to the further end of the bridge and made ready to keep
  the way against the enemy. Nevertheless there stood two with him, Lartius and
  Herminius by name, men, of noble birth both of them and of great renown in
  arms. So these three for a while stayed the first onset of the enemy; and the
  men of Rome meanwhile brake down the bridge. And when there was but a small
  part remaining, and they that brake it down called to the three that they
  should come back, Horatius bade Lartius and Herminius return, but he himself
  remained on the further side, turning his eyes full of wrath in threatening
  fashion on the princes of the Etrurians, and crying, "Dare ye now to fight
  with me? or why are ye thus come at the bidding of your master, King
  Porsenna, to rob others of the freedom that ye care not to have for
  yourselves?" For a while they delayed, looking each man to his neighbor, who
  should first deal with this champion of the Romans. Then, for very shame,
  they all ran forward, and raising a great shout, threw their javelins at him.
  These all he took upon his shield, nor stood the less firmly in his place on
  the bridge, from which when they would have thrust him by force, of a sudden
  the men of Rome raised a great shout, for the bridge was now altogether
  broken down, and fell with a great crash into the river. And as the enemy
  stayed a while for fear, Horatius turned him to the river and said, "O Father
  Tiber, I beseech thee this day with all reverence that thou kindly receive
  this soldier and his arms." And as he spake he leapt with all his arms into
  the river and swam across to his own people, and though many javelins of the
  enemy fell about him, he was not one whit hurt. Nor did such valor fail to
  receive due honor from the city. For the citizens set up a statue of Horatius
  in the market-place; and they gave him of the public land so much as he could
  plough about in one day. Also there was this honor paid him, that each
  citizen took somewhat of his own store and gave it to him, for food was
  scarce in the city by reason of the siege.</p>

    <p class="caption">Horatius on the bridge.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>After these things King Porsenna thought not any more to take the city by
  assault, but rather to shut it up. To this end he held Janiculum with a
  garrison, and pitched his own camp on the plain ground by the river; and the
  river he kept with ships, lest food should be brought into the city by water.
  Thus it came to pass in no long time that the famine in the city was scarcely
  to be endured, so that the King had good hopes that the Romans would
  surrender themselves to him. But being in these straits, they were delivered
  by the boldness of a noble youth, whose name was Caius Mucius. This man at
  the first purposed with himself to make his way into the camp of the enemy
  without the knowledge of any; but fearing lest if he should go without
  bidding from the Consuls, no man knowing his purpose, he might haply be taken
  by the sentinels and carried back to the city as one that sought to desert to
  the enemy&mdash;Rome being in so evil a plight that such an accusation would
  be readily believed&mdash;he sought audience of the Senate. And being
  admitted he said, "Fathers, I purpose to cross the Tiber, and to enter, if I
  shall be able, the camp of the enemy; plunder I seek not, but have some
  greater purpose in my heart." So the Fathers giving their consent, he hid a
  dagger under his garment and set forth; and having made his way into the
  camp, he took his stand where the crowd was thickest, hard by the
  judgment-seat of the King. Now it chanced that the soldiers were receiving
  their wages. There sat by the King's side a scribe, and the man wore garments
  like unto the King's garments. And Mucius, seeing that the man was busy about
  many things, and that the soldiers for the most part spake with him rather
  than with the other, and fearing to ask which of the two might be the King,
  lest he should so show himself to be a stranger, left the matter to chance,
  and slew the scribe. Then he turned to flee, making a way for himself through
  the crowd with his bloody sword; but the ministers of the King laid hands on
  him, and set him before the judgment-seat. Thereupon he cried, "I am a
  citizen of Rome, and men call me Caius Mucius. Thou art my enemy, O King, and
  I sought to slay thee; and now, as I feared not to smite, so I fear not to
  die. We men of Rome have courage both to do and to suffer. Think not that I
  only have this purpose against thee; there are many coming after me that seek
  honor in this same fashion by slaying thee. Prepare thee, therefore, to stand
  in peril of thy life every hour, and know that thou hast an enemy waiting
  ever at thy door. The youth of Rome declares war against thee, and this war
  it will wage, not by battle, but by such deeds as I would have done this
  day."</p>

  <p>King Porsenna, when he heard these words, was greatly moved both by wrath
  and by fear, and bade them bring fire, as though he would have burned the
  young man alive, unless he should speedily reveal what that danger which he
  threatened against the King might be. Then said Mucius, "See now and learn
  how cheaply they hold their bodies that set great glory before their eyes,"
  and he thrust his right hand into a fire that had been lighted for sacrifice.
  And as he stood and seemed to have no feeling of the pain, the King, greatly
  marvelling at the thing, leapt from his seat and bade them take away the
  young man from the altar. "Depart thou hence," he cried, "for I see that thou
  darest even worse things against thyself than against me. I would bid thee go
  on and prosper with thy courage wert thou a friend and not an enemy. And now
  I send thee away free and unharmed." Then said Mucius, as though he would
  make due return for such favor, "Hearken, O King; seeing that thou canst pay
  due respect unto courage, I will tell thee freely that which thou couldst
  never have wrung from me by threats. Three hundred youths of Rome have banded
  themselves together with an oath that they will slay thee as I would have
  slain thee. And because the lot fell to me I came first of the three hundred,
  who all will follow, each in his own time, according as the lot shall
  fall."</p>

    <p class="caption">Mucius Scaevola before Lars Porsenna.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>So Mucius departed; and men called him thereafter Scævola, or the left-
  handed, because he had thus burned his right hand in the fire. No long time
  after there came ambassadors from King Porsenna to Rome, for the King was so
  moved not only by the peril that was past, but also by that which was to
  come, so long as any of the three hundred yet lived, that of his own accord
  he offered conditions of peace to the Romans. And in these conditions he made
  mention of bringing back the Tarquins, knowing indeed that the men of Rome
  would not allow it, but because he was under promise to make such demand. As
  to other matters, he required, the Romans consenting, that the land of the
  men of Veii should be given back to them, and he would have hostages given to
  him if he should take away his garrison from Janiculum. To this also the
  Romans agreed by compulsion. So King Porsenna departed from Rome; and the
  Senate gave to Mucius certain lands beyond the Tiber that were called in time
  to come after his name.</p>

  <p>And now were the women of Rome also stirred up to do bold deeds for their
  country. For a certain maiden, Cl&oelig;lia by name, that was one of the
  hostages, the camp of the Etrurians having been pitched near unto the Tiber,
  escaped from them that kept her, and swam across the river, the whole troop
  of her companions following her. These she brought back to the city and
  delivered safe to their kinsfolk. News of this deed being brought to the King
  he was at the first moved to great wrath, and sent ambassadors to Rome who
  should demand the hostage Cl&oelig;lia to be restored; as for the others he
  cared little for them; but afterward, his wrath giving place to wonder, he
  cried, "Surely this deed is greater even than the keeping of the bridge by
  Horatius, or the burning of his right hand by Scævola. As for the treaty, I
  shall hold it to be broken if the Romans give not up the hostage; but if she
  be given up I will send her back unharmed to her own kindred." And so indeed
  it was done, both parties keeping faith, for the Romans gave up Cl&oelig;lia
  as the treaty commanded, and the King judged valor to be worthy not of safety
  alone but also of reward. "I will give thee," he said to her, "a certain
  portion of the hostages: thou shalt choose whom thou wilt." Then she chose
  such as were of tender age, not only because this best became the modesty of
  a maiden, but because such would be in the greater peril of harm. To her the
  Romans set up in the Sacred Road a statue, a maiden sitting on
  horseback&mdash;a new honor, even as the valor that was so honored was new
  also.</p>

  <p>So King Porsenna departed from Rome, and departing gave his camp, that was
  full of all manner of good things, to the men of Rome, there being great
  scarcity in the city by reason of the length of the siege. In the next year
  he sent ambassadors yet once again who should deal with the people of Rome
  about the bringing back of the King. To them was given this answer, "that the
  Senators would send ambassadors about the matter." These ambassadors, who
  were the chiefest men in the city, being arrived, spake in this fashion: "We
  might have answered thy ambassadors, O King, in very few words, saying that
  we take not back the King. But we are come this day that there may never
  again be made mention of this matter, lest there come out of it trouble both
  to thee and to us, if thou shouldst ask that which would be against the
  liberty of the Roman people, and we should be driven to refuse something to
  thee who would gladly refuse thee nothing. The men of Rome are free and serve
  not kings, and verily they would the sooner open their gates to their enemies
  than to kings. And this is the mind of us all. That day which shall make an
  end of our freedom shall make an end also of our city. If therefore thou
  wouldst have us live, suffer us, we pray thee, to be free."</p>

  <p>To this the King made answer in these words: "I will weary you no more by
  asking that which ye may not grant, nor will I deceive the Tarquins by show
  of help that it is not in me to give. As for them, whether they be minded to
  have peace or war, let them seek for another place of exile, that there come
  not anything to make mischief between you and me."</p>

  <p>To these words he added much kindness in deeds, for he gave back such of
  the hostages as yet remained with him; also he restored to the Romans the
  land of the men of Veii that had been taken from them by the treaty of
  Janiculum.</p>

  <p>After this, King Tarquin took up his abode with Mamilius Octavius, his
  son- in- law, that dwelt at Tusculum. And Mamilius stirred up the thirty
  cities of Latium to make war against Rome. For five years he made great
  preparations, and in the sixth year he set forth. And when the Romans knew of
  his coming, they made Aulus Postumius Dictator. Now a dictator was one that
  had the power, as it were, of a king in the city, only he might not remain
  for a greater space than six months. And Postumius chose Æbutius to be Master
  of the Horse, for the Master of the Horse is next under the Dictator. These
  having gathered together their army, marched forth and met the Latins hard by
  the Lake Regillus that is in the land of Tusculum. And so soon as the Romans
  knew that King Tarquin was in the army of the Latins, they were full of wrath
  and would fight without more delay. Nor indeed was ever battle harder and
  fiercer than this; for the chiefs contented themselves not with giving
  counsel how it might best be ordered, but themselves fought together, so that
  scarce one of them, save the Dictator only, came out of the battle unhurt.
  First of all King Tarquin, for all that he was an old man whose force was
  somewhat abated, when he saw the Dictator in the front ranks setting his men
  in order and bidding them be of good cheer, set spurs to his horse and rode
  against him; but some one smote him on the side as he rode. Nevertheless, his
  own men running about him, he was carried back alive into the host. On the
  other wing the Master of the Horse made at Mamilius, prince of Tusculum. And
  when Mamilius saw him coming he also spurred his horse against him, and the
  two came together with so great force that Mamilius was wounded in the
  breast, and Æbutius was smitten through the arm. Then the Master of the
  Horse, because his right arm was wounded, and he could not hold a weapon in
  it, departed from the battle, but Mamilius, caring nought for his wound,
  still stirred up the Latins to fight; and because he perceived them to be
  somewhat troubled with fear, he bade advance the company of exiles that had
  gone forth from Rome with King Tarquin. Very fiercely did they fight, as men
  that had been spoiled both of goods and country, and bare back the Romans a
  space. And when Valerius that was brother to Publicola (than whom none but
  Brutus only had been more zealous in driving out the King) saw the King's son
  among the foremost of the exiles, he set spurs to his horse and made at him
  with his spear. Nor did the young Tarquin abide his coming, but turned his
  back, hiding himself in the company of the exiles; and as Valerius pursued
  him and rode, taking no thought of what he did, into the very ranks of the
  enemy, one smote him upon the side so that he fell from his horse dying. And
  when the Dictator saw that so brave a champion was dead, and that the exiles
  were pressing on more fiercely and that the Romans gave place in great fear,
  he cried to the company that followed him, "See that ye deal with any Roman
  that ye see fleeing as with an enemy." Then they that fled, seeing this peril
  behind them, stayed their steps and addressed themselves again to the battle.
  But when Mamilius saw that the company of exiles was well-nigh surrounded by
  the Dictator and his men (for these were fresh and vigorous), he brought up
  sundry companies from the reserve, and would have assailed them. But
  Herminius, the same that kept the bridge over Tiber along with Horatius
  against the army of King Porsenna, espied him coming, and knew him for the
  Chief by his garments. He made at him with all his might, and with one blow
  smote him through the side and slew him. But while he stripped the body of
  its armor one of the Latins thrust at him with a spear, and hurt him that he
  fell to the earth. Men carried him back to the camp, but when they would have
  tended his wound he died. Then the Dictator cried to the horsemen that
  followed him, "See now how the foot soldiers are wearied out. Leap down
  therefore from off your horses, and fight on foot." And when the foot
  soldiers saw them leap down, they took courage again, and made forward
  against the Latins; and these, after a while, turned their backs and fled.
  Then the Dictator bade them bring again their horses for the horsemen, that
  they might the more conveniently pursue the enemy. Also, that no help either
  from God or man might be wanting, he made a vow to the Twin Brethren that he
  would build them a temple, and he proclaimed that he would give rewards, one
  to him who should be first in the camp of the enemy, and another to him who
  should be second. So great, indeed, was the courage of the soldiers that they
  took the camp of the Latins that very same hour. Thus did the men of Rome put
  the Latins to flight at the Lake Regillus, and the Dictator with the Master
  of the Horse returned in great triumph to Rome.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap07"
     id="chap07">THE STORY OF CORIOLANUS</a></h2>

  <p>IT came to pass about the space of fifty years after the driving out of
  the kings that there arose great talk in Rome by reason of those that were in
  debt, their creditors dealing harshly with them. For the law was that if a
  man was in debt and had not wherewithal to pay, his creditor could cast him
  into prison and scourge him, dealing with him in all ways as with a slave.
  And when many of the people were already in this case, and many more feared
  lest they should be so hereafter, neither was there any hope of relief,
  because the rich men would not, for the most part, relax a right that was
  their due, they took counsel how they might best deliver themselves from this
  bondage. Now it chanced in a certain year that the army, having put to flight
  all their enemies, and being now returned to Rome, was bidden by the Consuls
  to set forth yet again to the battle, for the Consuls feared lest the men,
  being discharged from their service, should seek to make some change in the
  State. This bidding they were not willing to obey. First they doubted whether
  they should not slay the Consuls, thinking thus to be free from their oath;
  but, considering that a man cannot free himself from an oath by such
  ill-doing, they followed rather the counsel of a certain Sicinius, who bade
  them depart from Rome as though they would build them a city of their own. So
  they departed, marching to a certain place that men called the Sacred Hill,
  that is distant from the city about three miles, and is on the other side of
  the river Anio. There they made a camp with trench and rampart, and abode in
  this place many days, doing nothing either for good or evil. But when the
  nobles saw what had been done, they were in great fear what this thing might
  mean, but doubted not that Rome must be brought to destruction, unless the
  rich and the poor should be reconciled the one to the other. Therefore they
  sent a certain Menenius Agrippa, an eloquent man and dear to the Commons, as
  belonging to them by birth, who should be their spokesman. So Agrippa, coming
  to the camp and being admitted thereunto, spoke to the Commons this parable
  only; for in those days men were not wont to make set speeches. "In old times
  the members of man lived not together in such harmony as we now see to be
  among them; but each member had his own counsel and his own speech. All the
  others members therefore had great wrath against the belly, because that all
  things were gained for it by their care, and labor, and service, while it,
  remaining at rest in the midst of them all, did nought but enjoy the
  pleasures provided for it. Wherefore they conspired that the hands should not
  carry food to the mouth, that the mouth should not take that which was
  offered to it, nor the teeth chew it. So it came to pass that while they
  would have subdued the belly by hunger, they themselves and the whole body
  were brought to great extremity of weakness. Then did it become manifest that
  the belly was not idle, but had also an office and service of its own,
  feeding others, even as itself was fed, seeing that it changed the food into
  that blood from which we have life and vigor, and so sent it back into all
  parts of the body. Consider then, and see how this wrath of the Commons
  against the nobles is as the wrath of the members against the belly." With
  these words he wrought upon the minds of the people so that they were willing
  to be reconciled, certain conditions being granted, whereof the chief was
  this, that the Commons should have officers of their own, tribunes by name,
  whom no man might harm under pain of death, and who should help the Commons,
  if need should arise, against the Consuls. Also it was provided that no noble
  should hold this office for ever.</p>

  <p>Now it fell out not many days after these things that there arose a great
  famine in this land, so that the slaves and not a few of the Commons also had
  perished, but that the Consuls diligently gathered wheat from all places
  where it could be bought. And it came to pass that there was brought much
  wheat from the island of Sicily, and the Senators debated among themselves on
  what terms it should be given to the people. Now there were some among the
  nobles that took it very ill that the Commons should have officers of their
  own, by whose help they might stand against the Consuls, and the counsel of
  these was to use the occasion of this famine against them. The chiefest of
  these was a certain Marcius, that was surnamed Coriolanus.</p>

  <p>How Marcius had won for himself this surname must now be told. The army of
  the Romans besieged Corioli, that was a town of the Volsci; and while they
  were busy with the siege, and thought only of the townsfolk that were shut in
  the town, there came upon them of a sudden an army of the Volscians from
  Antium, and at the same time the townsfolk sallied forth from the city. Now
  Marcius chanced to be on guard, and he, having a chosen band of soldiers with
  him, not only drave back them that had sallied forth, but entered into the
  city by the gate that was opened to receive them, slew them that were near,
  and set fire to such houses as were near to the walls. And when the townsfolk
  set up a shout, and the women and children cried out as is their wont in such
  alarm, the courage of the Romans was greatly increased, and the Volscians
  were troubled, thinking that the city to whose help they had come was already
  taken. Thus did Corioli come into possession of the Romans, and men gave to
  Marcius thereafter the surname of Coriolanus.</p>

  <p>This Coriolanus therefore, being ill content that the Commons should have
  tribunes, spake in the Senate in this manner: "If the people will have such
  cheapness in corn as they had in old time, let them render back to the
  Fathers such rights as they also in old times possessed. Why should I see
  officers chosen from the multitude, and such a fellow as is this Sicinius
  bearing rule? Should I endure such disgrace longer than I needs must? If I
  would not endure King Tarquin, should I now endure King Sicinius? Let him
  call the Commons, if he will, to the Sacred Hill. The way thither&mdash;aye,
  and to other hills besides&mdash;is open if he would go. They have made this
  dearth for themselves, suffering their lands to be untilled; let them
  therefore enjoy what they have made."</p>

  <p>This counsel seemed over harsh to the Senate; as for the Commons, it
  wrought them to madness. "See now," they cried, "how they would subdue us by
  hunger, even as though we were enemies! See how they would cheat us even of
  food! Lo! there is come this wheat from the stranger, which fortune has given
  us beyond all our hopes, and they would snatch it even from our mouths,
  unless, forsooth, we hand over our tribunes bound hand and foot to this
  Marcius, when they may work their will on the Commons of Rome with their
  scourges. What a savage is this that has risen up in our State, bidding us
  choose whether we will have slavery or death!" And as Coriolanus went forth
  from the senate-house they would have taken his life, but that the tribune
  named a day when he should stand his trial before the people. When they heard
  this their wrath abated, knowing that they had the power of life and death
  over their enemy.</p>

  <p>Now at the first Coriolanus made light of the matter. "Who are these
  tribunes," he would say, "that they venture on such matters? Succor they may
  give to them that need it, but whence have they the power to punish? And are
  they not tribunes of the Commons and not of the nobles?" Notwithstanding,
  when the wrath of the people increased beyond all measure, the Fathers
  perceived that they must let one man suffer for all. For a while, indeed,
  they held their place, using all their power if haply they might prevail.
  First, they would set their followers about the city, who might prevent the
  Commons from holding assemblies, and so bring the matter to nought. After
  they came forth all of them, so that a man might have thought that all the
  Fathers were on their trial, using prayers and supplications for Coriolanus.
  "If ye will not acquit him of the charge, count him guilty indeed, but spare
  him for favor toward us."</p>

  <p>When the day of trial was come, Coriolanus appeared not to answer, and the
  wrath of the people was still fierce against him. Being condemned, he was
  banished, and was to pass his exile among the Volscians, having even now in
  his heart the spirit of an enemy against Rome.</p>

  <p>The Volscians, indeed, bade him welcome right heartily; and their goodwill
  toward him increased when they perceived what wrath he bore against his
  native country. His host was a certain Attius Tullus, than whom there was
  none among the Volscians either more powerful or more hostile to Rome. So the
  two held counsel together how they might stir up war. They knew, indeed, that
  the people could not easily be moved to that which they had tried so often
  with ill success. For their spirits were broken not only with many defeats
  which they had suffered in time past from the men of Rome, but also from
  pestilence, which had of late sorely troubled them. Nevertheless Attius had
  good hopes that he might yet kindle their anger against the Romans; and this
  indeed he accomplished, as shall now be told.</p>

  <p>It chanced that in that year the great games at Rome were celebrated a
  second time; and the reason why they were celebrated a second time was this.
  On the day of the first celebration, early in the morning, a certain
  householder drave one of his slaves through the market-place, beating him
  with rods. Afterward the games began, and no man thought that aught was
  amiss. But no long time after a certain Atinius, a man of the people, dreamed
  a dream. He saw Jupiter, who spake to him saying, "I liked not him that
  danced the first dance at my Games. Unless they be celebrated again, and that
  right splendidly, there will be danger to the city. And do thou go and tell
  this to the Consuls." Now the man was not careless of the gods, nevertheless
  because he stood in great fear of the Consuls he went not, lest he should be
  laughed to scorn for idle words. But this delay cost him dearly, for within a
  few days his son died. And that he might not doubt what this great trouble
  might mean, the god appeared to him yet again in a dream. "Hast thou had
  wages enough for thy neglect of that which I commanded? Verily, thou shalt
  receive yet more if thou tell not the matter straightway to the Consuls."
  Nevertheless, though the matter was now more urgent, yet the man delayed, and
  there fell upon him suddenly a great sickness and weakness. Thereupon he
  called his kinsfolk together to counsel, and told them all that he had seen
  and heard, how Jupiter had appeared to him in his dream, and had threatened
  him with punishment, and what had thereupon ensued. When they heard these
  things, all with one consent agreed that the man should be carried
  straightway in a litter to the market-place into the presence of the Consuls.
  The Consuls commanded that he should be taken into the senate-house where,
  being set down, he related all that had been told, to the great wonder of the
  Fathers. And when he had finished speaking, lo! there followed another
  marvel. His sickness departed from him in a moment, so that he that had been
  brought into the senate-house without power to move any limb, now, having
  fulfilled the command of the god, returned upon his feet to his own home.</p>

  <p>The Senate, therefore, decreed that the Great Games should be celebrated a
  second time with great pomp. To this festival there came at the bidding of
  Attius, a great company of the Volscians. But before the beginning of the
  games Attius, having agreed with Coriolanus what should be done, sought
  audience of the Consuls, saying that he would speak with them of a matter of
  great moment to the State. To them, none others being present, he said, "I
  like not to speak ill of my own countrymen. Yet seeing that I have not to
  accuse them of aught that they have done amiss, but rather to take care they
  do it not, I will even speak my mind. The Volscians are of too light and
  fickle temper. From this cause we have already in time past suffered many
  things, so that in truth it is of your long-suffering rather than of our
  well-deserving that we are alive this day. Even now there is a great company
  of my people in this city; ye, men of Rome, will be wholly occupied with
  these games. Now I remember what on the like occasion was done in this place
  by certain young men of the Sabines, and I am in some fear lest the Volscians
  also should venture on a like misdeed. Of this, therefore, I give you
  warning, not for your sakes only, but also for ours. As for myself, it is my
  purpose to return straightway to my own home, lest something of the guilt of
  my countrymen should fall also upon me."</p>

  <p>So Attius departed. And when the Consuls had brought the matter before the
  Senate, the Fathers, judging that they must take heed to that which had been
  told on such authority, commanded that all the Volscians should depart
  forthwith from the city. Thereupon criers were sent into all parts making
  proclamation, "Let every Volscian depart hence before nightfall." At the
  first, on the hearing of these words, as they hastened each man to his
  lodgings, to take up such things as belonged to him, there was great fear;
  and afterward, when they were now setting out on their journey, not the less
  anger. "What is this," said they, "that we are driven forth from the presence
  of gods and men on a day of festival as if we were polluted with crime?" Now
  Attius had gone before them to the Fountain of Ferentina; and as each of the
  chief men of the State came hither he spake with him about this matter,
  making loud complaints and much display of wrath. And the chiefs gathered the
  people together to an assembly in the plain ground that is beneath the road.
  To whom Tullus spake, saying, "Though ye forget, ye Volscians, all the wrong
  that the Romans have done to us in old times and all that we have suffered at
  their hands, how will ye bear the scorn that hath been put upon you this day,
  when they have begun their games by making sport of us? Do ye not perceive
  that when ye departed in this fashion ye were made a spectacle to citizens
  and strangers and all the nations round about? What thought they that heard
  the voice of the crier? or they that saw you depart? or they that met you as
  ye came hither in such unseemly plight? What but this, that ye had done some
  great wickedness, wherefore ye must be driven away from the gathering of gods
  and men lest your presence should be a defilement? Is not this a city of
  enemies, wherein if ye had tarried but one single day ye would all have
  suffered death? They have declared war against you, and if ye are men they
  will suffer no small loss therefrom."</p>

    <p class="caption">The mother of Coriolanus pleads with her son.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>Thus it was brought to pass that all the Volscians joined together to make
  war against Rome. First they chose for leaders Attius and Coriolanus, in whom
  indeed they trusted the more of the two. And indeed they trusted rightly, as
  was proved in the end, so that it became manifest that Rome had prevailed
  rather through the skillfulness of leaders than the courage of armies. First
  Coriolanus came to Circeii, that is hard by the sea, and drave out thence the
  Roman colonists, and gave over the city to the Romans. After this he took
  many cities of the Latins, and at the last pitched his camp five miles from
  Rome, sending out thence those who might spoil the lands of the Romans. Only
  he gave commandment that they should not spoil the lands of the nobles. And
  this he did, either because he hated the Commons more than the nobles, or
  that he would sow dissension between the two. This, indeed, he did not, for a
  common fear bound them together. Yet there was so much of disagreement that
  the nobles would have had recourse to war to rid them of the enemy, but the
  Commons were urgent that they should rather seek for conditions of peace. And
  this opinion prevailed. Ambassadors therefore were sent to Coriolanus, to
  whom he gave this answer only: "When ye shall have given back all their lands
  to the Volscians, then may ye talk of peace. But if ye seek to enjoy in peace
  that which ye took for yourselves by war, ye shall see that I forget neither
  what wrong I suffered from my own people, nor what kindness I have received
  from my hosts." And when the ambassadors were sent a second time he would not
  suffer them to enter the camp. After them came the priests, bearing the
  emblems of their office; nor did these prevail more than the ambassadors.
  Then a great company of the women came to Veturia, the mother of Coriolanus,
  and to Volumnia, that was his wife. But whether they did this by consent of
  the rulers, or by prompting of their own fear, cannot be affirmed for
  certain. These women then prevailed with Veturia, though she was now well
  stricken in years, and with Volumnia, that they should go to the camp to
  Coriolanus; and Volumnia carried with her the two sons that she had borne to
  Coriolanus. These having come, it was told the man that a great company of
  women was arrived. At the first, indeed, he was not minded to yield to their
  tears that which he had steadfastly refused to the ambassadors. But
  afterward, when a certain one of his friends, seeing Veturia stand together
  with her daughter-in-law and grandsons, said, "Unless my eyes deceive me, thy
  mother and wife and children are here." Coriolanus, being greatly troubled,
  leapt from his seat and would have embraced his mother. But she, turning from
  supplication to anger, cried, "I would fain know, before I receive thy
  embrace, whether I see a son or an enemy before me, whether I am thy mother
  or a prisoner. Has long life been given me for this, that I should see thee
  first an exile and afterward an enemy? Couldst thou bear to lay waste this
  land which gave thee birth and nurture? Didst thou not think to thyself,
  seeing Rome, 'Within those walls are my home, my mother, my wife, my
  children'? As for me I cannot suffer more than I have already endured; nor
  doth there yet remain to me a long space of life or of misery. But consider
  these thy children. If thou art steadfast to work thy will, they must either
  die before their time or grow old in bondage." When she had ended these
  words, his wife and his children embraced him; and at the same time the whole
  company of women set up a great wailing. Thus was the purpose of Coriolanus
  against his country changed, and, breaking up his camp, he led his army away.
  Some say that the Volscians slew him for wrath that he let slip this occasion
  against Rome; but others relate that he lived to old age, being wont to say,
  "There is no man so unhappy as he that is old and also an exile."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap08"
     id="chap08">THE STORY OF THE FABII</a></h2>

  <p>OF the chief houses in Rome there was none greater than the house of the
  Fabii; nor in this house any man of more valor and renown than a certain
  Kæso. Good service had he done, more particularly against the Etrurians, and
  thrice was he chosen Consul. Now the third time that he was so chosen he was
  urgent with the Fathers that they divide the land that had been taken from
  the enemy as fairly as might be among the Commons. For the tribunes of the
  Commons were wont, year after year, to demand such division, and the counsel
  of Kæso was that the nobles should be beforehand with them, giving them this
  boon of their own accord. "Verily," he said, "it is well that they should
  have the land who have won it by their own toil and by the shedding of their
  blood." Nevertheless this counsel pleased not the nobles. "This Kæso," they
  said, "was wise, but too great glory has turned his wisdom into folly." For
  this cause Kæso was ill content, and was the more willing to take such
  occasion as offered of serving his country elsewhere than at Rome.</p>

  <p>Now the city of Veii, being ten miles only distant from Rome, was ever at
  variance with it. Never was there peace between these two, neither was there
  open war. When the Roman legions marched forth, the men of Veii would flee
  before them and seek refuge in their city; but so soon as they perceived that
  the legions had departed, then they would sally forth and spoil the land of
  the Romans. These had other enemies also with whom to deal; for the Æquians
  and the Volscians were content to be quiet only till they should have
  recovered themselves from the loss they had of late suffered, and the Sabines
  were always enemies, and all the cities of Etruria were manifestly making
  ready for war.</p>

  <p>These things being so, Kæso Fabius, the Consul, on behalf of the whole
  house of the Fabii, spake thus to the Senate: "This war with the men of Veii,
  as ye well know, Fathers, needeth not a great army, yet needeth one that
  shall be ever at hand. With this, therefore, we that are of the house of
  Fabius will deal; the others we leave to you. This will we wage of our own
  strength and at our own cost, with some saving, we trust, of men and money to
  the State." The Senate receiving these words with much thankfulness, the
  Consul departed to his own house; the Fabii, who had stood in the porch of
  the senate-house till the matter should be settled, following him.
  Straightway the fame of the thing spread throughout the city, and all men
  extolled the Fabii. "See now," they said, "how this one family has undertaken
  the burden of the State. Had we but two such houses besides who might
  undertake, this to do battle with the Æquians and that with the Volscians,
  the city might remain at peace and do its business quietly, while all the
  nations round about should be subdued unto it." The next day the Fabii arm
  themselves for battle, and assemble as Kæso had commanded. Then the Consul,
  coming from his house with his soldier's cloak upon his shoulders, saw all
  his kindred drawn up in array before the porch. And when these had received
  him into their midst, he bade them lift the standards. Never had there passed
  through the city a smaller army, or one more renowned and admired among men.
  Three hundred and six soldiers there were, nobles all of them, all of one
  house, not one but might well have been a leader of men. And after them
  followed a great crowd, first of kinsfolk and friends, then of the other
  citizens, bidding them God speed in this their enterprise. "Be bold," they
  cried, "and fortunate. Let the issue of this undertaking be even as the
  beginning, and ye shall have from us consulships and triumph, yea, and all
  honors that ye can desire." And as the army passed by the Capitol they prayed
  to all the gods that they would guide it safely on its way and bring it back
  safely home. They prayed to no purpose. Passing by that which men call the
  Unlucky Way, through the right archway of the Gate of Carmenta, the Fabii
  went on their way till they came to the river Cremera, thinking that to be a
  fit place for building a fort.</p>

  <p>For a while all things prospered with the Fabii in their dealings with the
  men of Veii. And not only did they make incursions upon their lands and carry
  off much booty, but fought set battles, not once or twice, but many times; a
  single Roman house so winning victory over that which was the wealthiest of
  all the cities of Etruria. Now this seemed to the men of Veii a shameful
  thing, and one that was not to be endured. So they began to take counsel how
  they might take this enemy by subtlety, and perceived, not without joy, that
  the Fabii grew daily bolder by success.</p>

  <p>So when the men went to gather booty they would cause that herds of cattle
  came in their way, as though it had been by chance, and that companies of
  soldiers, sent to hinder them from their plundering, fled before them, making
  pretence of fear. And now the Fabii had such contempt for the enemy that they
  thought themselves such as could never be conquered at any place or time. In
  which confidence, seeing on a certain day herds of cattle on the plain, they
  ran forth to drive them, heeding not that they were distant from the fort a
  great space of plain. And so, scattering themselves in thoughtless fashion,
  they passed a place where the enemy had set an ambush, and busied themselves
  with the cattle. Then all of sudden the Etrurians rose up from the ambush and
  lo! there were enemies both before them and on all sides. These set up a
  great shout and threw their javelins, still closing in upon them, so that the
  Fabii also were compelled to gather themselves more and more closely
  together, so making it the more evident how few they were in comparison of
  them that were against them. After this they fought not as before, turning
  every way against them that pressed upon them, but set themselves with all
  their strength to gain one certain point&mdash;a hill of no great height that
  stood hard by the road. And to this, by dint of strength and plying their
  swords, they won their way, and made there a stand for a while; nay more,
  because the higher ground gave them breathing space and advantage, they drave
  back them that assailed them from below. But after a time the men of Veii,
  climbing the ridge from behind, took them in the rear, so that the enemy was
  again above them. Thus all the Fabii were slain that day; and indeed the
  whole house had perished, but that there had been left behind at Rome a youth
  not fully grown to manhood. From him there sprang anew a race of Fabii that
  did good service to Rome in perilous times, both at home and abroad.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap09"
     id="chap09">THE STORY OF CINCINNATUS</a></h2>

  <p>IN the seventy and third year after the driving out of the kings the
  strife between the nobles and the Commons grew to be fierce beyond measure;
  for on the one hand the Consuls would have levied an army to make war with
  the Volscians, and this the tribunes hindered; and on the other hand the
  tribunes sought to establish a law that should set bounds to the power of the
  Consuls, and this law the nobles hindered that it should not be passed. Now
  among the nobles (who were mostly of the younger sort, for the elders held
  aloof from the matter) the chief mover was one Kæso Quinctius, a youth of
  singular strength and courage, and that had won for himself great renown in
  war. This man was wont to drive the tribunes from the market-place and
  scatter the people, and when Virginius, that was one of the tribunes, named a
  day on which he should be brought to judgment for his misdeeds, he was not
  one whit dismayed, but bare himself as haughtily as before. Meanwhile
  Virginius stirred up the people, saying, "See ye not, men of Rome, that if ye
  suffer this Kæso to dwell in this city, it cannot be that this law which ye
  desire should be established? But why speak of laws? This man is the enemy of
  liberty itself; not King Tarquin himself was so haughty and violent. He is a
  very king already; what think ye will he be if he be made consul or
  dictator?" To these words many gave assent, complaining that Kæso had beaten
  them, and were urgent with the tribune that he should carry the matter to an
  end. Then it came to pass that, when the day of trial was come, the people
  were of one mind that Kæso should be condemned. Then, indeed, the young man
  and his kinsfolk and friends turned to supplications and prayers. Titus
  Quinctius, that had been three times consul, affirmed, "Never in the home of
  Quinctius, never verily in this city of Rome, has there been a soldier of so
  ripe a courage, When I was captain of the host, he was ever the first; with
  these eyes have I seen him fighting against the enemy." Also Lucretius, that
  had been consul the year before, winning great glory from the Volscians and
  Æquians, testified that Kæso had helped him to conquer as none other had
  done; and one Furius that he had delivered him and his army from great peril
  of defeat. As for Lucius Quinctius, his father, whose surname was
  Cincinnatus, he sought not to magnify the valor and brave deeds of his son,
  lest haply he should so stir up the more jealousy against him, but sought to
  make excuse for him, as one who had erred for want of discretion, beseeching
  men that, if he himself had wronged no man by word or deed, so they would
  grant him for a favor the pardon of his son. But nothing availed with the
  people, some fearing the wrath of their fellows if they should give ear to
  such words, and some making complaint that they had suffered violence from
  the hands of Kæso, and affirming that they would be avenged of him for his
  misdeeds. Now of all things that were alleged against him the most grievous
  was the accusation brought by a certain Volscius that had once been tribune
  of the Commons; for Volscius bare this witness against him: "Not many days
  after the plague had ceased from the city, I, with others in my company, fell
  in with certain young men, of whom this Kæso was one, disporting themselves
  in the street. These fell out with us, and Kæso smote my elder brother with
  the fist, so that he fell fainting to the ground, being then not wholly
  recovered from the plague. And being carried home, he died by noon, as I
  doubt not, of this blow. But when I would have brought Kæso to judgment for
  this offence, the Consuls would not suffer it." At the hearing of this tale
  the wrath of the Commons waxed so hot that they could scarcely be kept from
  falling on Kæso and slaying him. At the last, after much debate between the
  nobles and the tribunes, it was agreed that the young man should appear the
  next day to make his answer to these accusations, giving sureties in the
  meanwhile lest he should fail to do so. Ten sureties he gave, and each was
  bound in three thousand pounds of copper. So being suffered to depart from
  the market-place, he departed that same night from Rome, going into
  banishment among the Etrurians. As for his sureties, the money was exacted
  from his father to the uttermost farthing, so that he was compelled to sell
  all his goods, and to dwell in a mean cottage on the other side of the
  Tiber.</p>

  <p>It came to pass in the third year after these things that the Æquians
  brake the treaty of peace which they had made with Rome, and, taking one
  Gracchus Cl&oelig;lius for their leader, marched into the land of Tusculum;
  and when they had plundered the country thereabouts, and had gathered
  together much booty, they pitched their camp on Mount Ægidus. To them the
  Romans sent three ambassadors, who should complain of the wrong done, and
  seek redress. But when they would have fulfilled their errand, Gracchus the
  Æquian spake, saying, "If ye have any message from the Senate of Rome, tell
  it to this oak, for I have other business to do;" for it chanced that there
  was a great oak that stood hard by, and made a shadow over the general's
  tent. Then one of the ambassadors, as he turned to depart, made reply, "Yes,
  let this sacred oak and all the gods that are in heaven hear how ye have
  wrongfully broken the treaty of peace; and let them that hear help us also in
  the day of battle, when we shall avenge on you the laws both of gods and of
  men that ye have set at nought."</p>

  <p>When the ambassadors had returned to Rome the Senate commanded that there
  should be levied two armies; and that Minucius the consul should march with
  the one against the Æquians on Mount Ægidus, and that the other should hinder
  the enemy from their plundering. This levying the tribunes of the Commons
  sought to hinder; and perchance had done so, but there also came well-nigh to
  the walls of the city a great host of the Sabines plundering all the country.
  Thereupon the people willingly offered themselves, and there were levied
  forthwith two great armies. Nevertheless when the consul Minucius had marched
  to Mount Ægidus, and had pitched his camp not far from the Æquians, he did
  nought for fear of the enemy, but kept himself within his entrenchments. And
  when the enemy perceived that he was afraid, growing the bolder for his lack
  of courage, they drew lines about him, keeping him in on every side. Yet
  before that he was altogether shut up there escaped from his camp five
  horsemen, that bare tidings to Rome how that the Consul, together with his
  army, was besieged. The people were sorely dismayed to hear such tidings;
  nor, when they cast about for help, saw they any man that might be sufficient
  for such peril, save only Cincinnatus. By common consent, therefore, he was
  made Dictator for six months, a thing that may well be noted by those who
  hold that nothing is to be accounted of in comparison of riches, and that no
  man may win great honor or show forth singular virtue unless he be well
  furnished with wealth. For here in this great peril of the Roman people there
  was no hope of safety but in one who was cultivating with his own hand a
  little plot of scarcely three acres of ground. For when the messengers of the
  people came to him they found him ploughing, or, as some say, digging a
  ditch. When they had greeted each the other, the messengers said, "May the
  Gods prosper this thing to the Roman people and to thee. Put on thy robe and
  hear the words of the people." Then said Cincinnatus, being not a little
  astonished, "Is all well?" and at the same time he called to his wife Racilia
  that she should bring forth his robe from the cottage. So she brought it
  forth, and the man wiped from him the dust and the sweat, and clad himself in
  his robe, and stood before the messengers. These said to him, "The people of
  Rome make thee Dictator, and bid thee come forthwith to the city." And at the
  same time they told how the Consul and his army were besieged by the Æquians.
  So Cincinnatus departed to Rome; and when he came to the other side of the
  Tiber there met him first his three sons, and next many of his kinsfolk and
  friends, and after them a numerous company of the nobles. These all conducted
  him to his house, the lictors, four and twenty in number, marching before
  him. There was also assembled a very great concourse of the people, fearing
  much how the Dictator might deal with them, for they knew what manner of man
  he was, and that there was no limit to his Power, nor any appeal from
  him.</p>

    <p class="caption">Put on thy robe and hear the words of the people.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The next day before dawn the Dictator came into the market-place, and
  appointed one Lucius Tarquinius to be Master of the Horse. This Tarquinius
  was held by common consent to excel all other men in exercises of war; only,
  though, being a noble by birth, he should have been among the horsemen, he
  had served, for lack of means, as a foot soldier. This done he called an
  assembly of the people and commanded that all the shops in the city should be
  shut; that no man should concern himself with any private business, but all
  that were of an age to go to the war should be present before sunset in the
  Field of Mars, each man having with him provisions of cooked food for five
  days, and twelve stakes. As for them that were past the age, they should
  prepare the food while the young men made ready their arms and sought for the
  stakes. These last they took as they found them, no man hindering them; and
  when the time appointed by the Dictator was come, all were assembled, ready,
  as occasion might serve, either to march or to give battle. Forthwith they
  set out, the Dictator leading the foot soldiers by their legions, and
  Tarquinius the horsemen, and each bidding them that followed make all haste.
  "We must needs come," they said, "to our journey's end while it is yet night.
  Remember that the Consul and his army have been besieged now for three days,
  and that no man knows what a day or a night may bring forth." The soldiers
  themselves also were zealous to obey, crying out to the standard-bearers that
  they should quicken their steps, and to their fellows that they should not
  lag behind. Thus they came at midnight to Mount Ægidus, and when they
  perceived that the enemy was at hand they halted the standards. Then the
  Consul rode forward to see, so far as the darkness would suffer him, how
  great was the camp of the Æquians and after what fashion it was pitched. This
  done he commanded that the baggage should be gathered together into a heap,
  and that the soldiers should stand every man in his own place. After this he
  compassed about the whole army of the enemy with his own army, and commanded
  that at a set signal every man should shout, and when they had shouted should
  dig a trench and set up therein the stakes. This the soldiers did, and the
  noise of the shouting passed over the camp of the enemy and came into the
  city, causing therein great joy, even as it caused great fear in the camp.
  For the Romans cried, "These be our countrymen, and they bring us help." Then
  said the Consul, "We must make no delay. By that shout is signified, not that
  they are come only, but that they are already dealing with the enemy.
  Doubtless the camp of the Æquians is even now assailed from without. Take ye
  your arms and follow me." So the legion went forth, it being yet night, to
  the battle, and as they went they shouted, that the Dictator might be aware.
  Now the Æquians had set themselves to hinder the making of a ditch and
  rampart which should shut them in; but when the Romans from the camp fell
  upon them, fearing lest these should make their way through the midst of
  their camp, they left them that were with Cincinnatus to finish their
  entrenching, and fought with the Consul. And when it was now light, lo! they
  were already shut in, and the Romans, having finished their entrenching,
  began to trouble them. And when the Æquians perceived that the battle was now
  on either side of them, they could withstand no longer, but sent ambassadors
  praying for peace, and saying, "Ye have prevailed; slay us not, but rather
  permit us to depart, leaving our arms behind us." Then said the Dictator, "I
  care not to have the blood of the Æquians. Ye may depart, but ye shall depart
  passing under the yoke, that ye may thus acknowledge to all men that ye are
  indeed vanquished." Now the yoke is thus made. There are set up in the ground
  two spears, and over them is bound by ropes a third spear. So the Æquians
  passed under the yoke.</p>

  <p>In the camp of the enemy there was found abundance of spoil. This the
  Dictator gave wholly to his own soldiers. "Ye were well-nigh a spoil to the
  enemy," said he to the army of the Consul, "therefore ye shall have no share
  in the spoiling of them. As for thee, Minucius, be thou a lieutenant only
  till thou hast learnt how to bear thyself as a consul." Meanwhile at Rome
  there was held a meeting of the Senate, at which it was commanded that
  Cincinnatus should enter the city in triumph, his soldiers following him in
  order of march.</p>

  <p>Before his chariot there were led the generals of the enemy; also the
  standards were carried in the front; and after these came the army, every man
  laden with spoil. That day there was great rejoicing in the city, every man
  setting forth a banquet before his doors in the street.</p>

  <p>After this, Volscius, that had borne false witness against Kæso, was found
  guilty of perjury, and went into exile. And when Cincinnatus saw that justice
  had been done to this evil-doer, he resigned his dictatorship, having held it
  for sixteen days only.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">THE STORY OF THE DECEMVIRS AND OF VIRGINIA</a></h2>

  <p>IT was agreed between the nobles and the Commons that, to make an end of
  disputing about the laws, ambassadors should be sent into Greece, and
  especially to Athens (which city and its lawgiver, Solon, were held in high
  repute in those days), to learn what manner of laws and customs they had, and
  to bring back a report of them. And when the ambassadors had brought back
  their report, it seemed good to the people that in the following year there
  should be appointed neither consuls nor any other magistrate, but decemvirs
  only; that is to say, ten men, who should set in order the laws of Rome. Thus
  it came to pass in the ninety and first year from the driving out of the
  kings, that decemvirs were appointed in the stead of consuls, Appius Claudius
  being the chief of the ten.</p>

  <p>For a while these pleased the people well, doing justice equally between
  man and man. And the custom was that each day one of the ten sat as judge
  with the twelve lictors about him, the nine others sitting with one minister
  only. Also they busied themselves with the ordering of the laws; and at last
  set forth ten tables on which these were written. At the same time they
  called the people together to an assembly, and spake to them thus: "The Gods
  grant that this undertaking may turn to the credit of the State, and of you,
  and of your children. Go, therefore, and read these laws which we have set
  forth; for though we have done what ten men could do to provide laws that
  should be just to all, whether they be high or low, yet the understandings of
  many men may yet change many things for the better. Consider therefore all
  these matters in your own minds, and debate them among yourselves. For we
  will that the Roman people should be bound by such laws only as they shall
  have agreed together to establish."</p>

  <p>The ten tables were therefore set forth, and when these had been
  sufficiently considered, and such corrections made therein as seemed good, a
  regular assembly of the people was called, and the laws were duly
  established. But now there was spread abroad a report that two tables were
  yet wanting, and that when these should have been added the whole would be
  complete; and thence there arose a desire that the Ten should be appointed to
  hold office a second year. This indeed was done; but Appius Claudius so
  ordered matters that there were elected together with him none of the chief
  men of the State, but only such as were of an inferior condition and
  fortune.</p>

  <p>After this the Ten began more and more to set aside all law and right.
  Thus whereas at the first one only on each day was followed by the twelve
  lictors, each of the ten came daily into the market-place so attended; and
  whereas before the lictors carried bundles of rods only, now there was bound
  up with the rods an axe, whereby was signified the power of life and death.
  Their actions also agreed with this show, for they and their ministers
  plundered the goods and chattels of the people. Some also they scourged, and
  some they beheaded. And when they had so put a man to death, they would
  divide his substance among those that waited upon them to do their
  pleasure.</p>

  <p>Among their misdeeds two were especially notable. There was a certain
  Sicinius in the host, a man of singular strength and courage, who took it ill
  that the Ten should thus set themselves above all law, and was wont to say to
  his comrades that the Commons should depart from the city as they had done in
  time past, or should at the least make them tribunes to be their champions as
  of old. This Sicinius the Ten sent on before the army, there being then war
  with the Sabines, to search out a place for a camp; and with him they sent
  certain others, bidding them slay him when they should have come to some
  convenient place. This they did, but not without suffering much loss; for the
  man fought for his life and defended himself, slaying many of his enemies.
  Then they that escaped ran into the camp, saying that Sicinius had fallen
  into an ambuscade and had died along with certain others of the soldiers. At
  the first, indeed, this story was believed; but afterward, when, by
  permission of the Ten, there went some to bury the dead, they found that none
  of the dead bodies had been spoiled, and that Sicinius lay with his arms in
  the midst, the others having their faces toward him; also that there was no
  dead body of an enemy in the place, nor any track as of them that had gone
  from the place; for which reasons they brought back tidings that Sicinius had
  certainly been slain by his own comrades. At this there was great wrath in
  the camp; and the soldiers were ready to carry the body of Sicinius to Rome,
  but that the Ten made a military funeral for him at the public cost. So they
  buried Sicinius with great lamentation; but the Ten were thereafter in very
  ill repute among the soldiers.</p>

  <p>Again, there was a certain centurion, Lucius Virginius by name, an upright
  man and of good credit both at home and abroad. This Virginius had a
  daughter, Virginia, a very fair and virtuous maiden, whom he had espoused to
  a certain Icilius that had once been a tribune of the Commons. On this maiden
  Appius Claudius, the chief of the Ten, sought to lay hands, and for this end
  gave commandment to one Marcus Claudius, who was one of the clients of his
  house, that he should claim the girl for a slave. On the morrow therefore as
  Virginia passed across the market-place, being on her way to school (for the
  schools in those days were held in the market-place), this Claudius seized
  her, affirming that she was born of a woman that was a slave, and was
  therefore by right a slave herself. The maiden standing still for fear, the
  nurse that attended her set up a great cry and called the citizens to help.
  Straightway there was a great concourse, for many knew the maiden's father
  Virginius, and Icilius to whom she was betrothed. Then said Claudius, seeing
  that he could not take her by force, "There is no need of tumult or of
  gathering a crowd. I would proceed by law, not by force." Thereupon he
  summoned the girl before the judge. When they came to the judgment-seat of
  Appius the man told a tale that had already been agreed upon between the two.
  "This girl," he said, "was born in my house, and was thence secretly taken to
  the house of Virginius, and passed off on the man as his daughter. Of this I
  will bring proof sufficient, such as will convince Virginius himself, who
  doubtless has received the chief wrong in this matter. But in the meanwhile
  it is reasonable that the slave should remain in the house of her master." To
  this the friends of the girl made answer, "Virginius is absent on the service
  of the State, and will be here within the space of two days, if tidings of
  this matter be sent to him. Now it is manifestly wrong that judgment
  concerning a man's children should be given while he is himself absent. Let
  the cause, therefore, be postponed till he come. Meanwhile let the maiden
  have her freedom according to the law which Appius and his fellows have
  themselves established."</p>

  <p>Appius gave sentence in these words: "That I am a favorer of freedom is
  manifest from this law of which ye make mention. Yet this law must be
  observed in all cases and without respect of persons; and as to this girl,
  there is none but her father only to whom her owner may yield the custody of
  her. Let her father therefore be sent for; but in the meanwhile Claudius must
  have custody of her, as is his right, only giving security that he will
  produce her on the morrow."</p>

  <p>At this decree, so manifestly unrighteous was it, there was much
  murmuring, yet none dared to oppose it, till Numitorius, the girl's uncle,
  and Icilius came forth from the crowd. The lictor cried, "Sentence has been
  given," and bade Icilius give place. Then Icilius turned to Appius, saying,
  "Appius, thou must drive me hence with the sword before thou canst have thy
  will in this matter. This maiden is my espoused wife; and verily, though thou
  call hither all thy lictors and the lictors of thy colleagues, she shall not
  remain in any house save the house of her father."</p>

  <p>To this Appius, seeing that the multitude was greatly moved and were ready
  to break forth into open violence, made this reply: "Icilius cares not for
  Virginia, but being a lover of sedition and tumult, seeks an occasion for
  strife. Such occasion I will not give him to-day. But that he may know that I
  yield not to his insolence, but have regard to the rights of a father, I
  pronounce no sentence. I ask of Marcus Claudius that he will concede
  something of his right, and suffer surety to be given for the girl against
  the morrow. But if on the morrow the father be not present here, then I tell
  Icilius and his fellows that he who is the author of this law will not fail
  to execute it. Neither will I call in the lictors of my colleague to put down
  them that raise a tumult. For this my own lictors shall suffice."</p>

  <p>So much time being thus gained, it seemed good to the friends of the
  maiden that the son of Numitorius and the brother of Icilius, young men both
  of them and active, should hasten with all speed to the camp, and bring
  Virginius thence as quickly as might be. So the two set out, and putting
  their horses to their full speed, carried tidings of the matter to the
  father. As for Appius, he sat a while on the judgment-seat, waiting for other
  business to be brought before him, for he would not have it seem that he had
  come for this cause only; but finding that there was none, and indeed the
  people were wholly intent on the matter of Virginia, he departed to his own
  house. Thence he sent an epistle to his colleagues that were at the camp,
  saying, "Grant no leave of absence to Virginius, but keep him in safe custody
  with you." But this availed nothing, for already, before ever the epistle was
  brought to the camp, at the very first watch of the night, Virginius had set
  forth.</p>

  <p>When Virginius was come to the city, it being then early dawn, he put on
  mean apparel, as was the custom with such as were in danger of life or
  liberty, and carried about his daughter, who was clad in like manner, praying
  all that he met to help and succor him. "Remember," said he, "that day by day
  I stand fighting for you and for your children against your enemies. But what
  shall this profit you or me if, this city being safe, nevertheless our
  children stand in peril of slavery and shame?" Icilius spake in like manner,
  and the women (for a company of matrons followed Virginia) wept silently,
  stirring greatly the hearts of all that looked upon them. But Appius, so set
  was his heart on evil, heeded none of these things; but so soon as he had sat
  him down on the seat of judgment, and he that claimed the girl had said a few
  words complaining that right had not been done to him, he gave his sentence;
  suffering not Virginius to speak. What pretence of reason he gave can scarce
  be imagined, but the sentence (for this only is certain) was that the girl
  should be in the custody of Claudius till the matter should be decided by
  law. But when Claudius came to take the maiden, her friends and all the women
  that bare her company thrust him back. Then said Appius, "I have sure proof,
  and this not from the violence only of Icilius, but from what is told to me
  of gatherings by night in the city, that there is a purpose in certain men to
  stir up sedition. Knowing this I have come hither with armed men; not to
  trouble quiet citizens, but to punish such as would break the peace of the
  State. Such as be wise, therefore, will keep themselves quiet. Lictor, remove
  this crowd, and make room for the master that he may take his slave." These
  words he thundered forth in great anger; and the people, when they heard
  them, fell back in fear, so that the maiden stood without defence. Then
  Virginius, seeing that there were none to help him, said to Appius, "I pray
  thee, Appius, if I have said aught that was harsh to thee, that thou wilt
  pardon it, knowing how a father must needs suffer in such a case. But now
  suffer me to inquire somewhat of this woman that is the girl's nurse, that I
  may know what is the truth of the matter. For if I have been deceived in the
  matter, and am not in truth father to the girl, I shall be more content."
  Then, Appius giving permission, he led his daughter and her nurse a little
  space aside, to the shops that are by the temple of Cloacina, and snatching a
  knife from a butcher's, said, "My daughter, there is but this one way that I
  can make thee free," and he drave the knife into her breast. Then he looked
  back to the judgment-seat and cried, "With this blood, Appius, I devote thee
  and thy life to perdition." There went up a great cry from all that stood
  there when they saw so dreadful a deed, and Appius commanded that they should
  seize him. But no man laid hands on him, for he made a way for himself with
  the knife that he carried in his hand, and they that followed defended him,
  till he came to the gate of the city. Then Icilius and Numitorius took up the
  dead body of the maiden and showed it to the people, saying much of the
  wickedness of him who had driven a father to do such a deed, and much also of
  the liberty which had been taken from them, and which, if they would only use
  this occasion, they might now recover. As for Appius, he cried out to his
  lictors that they should lay hands on Icilius, and when the crowd suffered
  not the lictors to approach, would himself have made a way to him, by the
  help of the young nobles that stood by him. But now the crowd had leaders,
  themselves also nobles, Valerius and Horatius. These said, "If Appius would
  deal with Icilius according to law we will be securities for him; if he mean
  to use violence, we are ready to meet him." And when the lictor would have
  laid hands on these two the multitude brake his rods to pieces. Then Appius
  would have spoken to the people, but they clamored against him, so that at
  last, losing all courage and fearing for his life, he covered his head and
  fled secretly to his own house.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>Meanwhile Virginius had made his way to the camp, which was now on Mount
  Vecilius, and stirred up the army yet more than he had stirred the city. "Lay
  not to my charge," he said, "that which is in truth the wickedness of Appius;
  neither turn from me as from the murderer of my daughter. Her indeed I slew,
  thinking that death was better than slavery and shame; nor indeed had I
  survived her but that I hoped to avenge her death by the help of my
  comrades." Others also that had come from the city persuaded the soldiers;
  some saying that the power of the Ten was overthrown, and others that Appius
  had gone of his own accord into banishment. These words so prevailed with the
  soldiers that, without any bidding from their generals, they took up their
  arms, and, with their standards carried before them, came to Rome and pitched
  their camp on the Aventine.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the Ten were still obstinate, affirming that they would not
  resign their authority till they had finished the work for which they had
  been appointed, namely, the drawing up of the twelve tables of the laws. And
  when the army perceived this they marched from the Aventine and took up their
  abode on the Sacred Hill, all the Commons following them, so that there was
  not left in the city a single man that had ability to move; nor did the women
  and children stay behind, but all, as many as could move, bare them company;
  for Duilius, that had been tribune, said, "Unless the Senate see the city
  deserted, they will take no heed of your complaints." And indeed, when these
  perceived what had taken place, they were more urgent than before that the
  Ten should resign their office. And these at last consented; "Only," said
  they, "do not suffer us to perish from the rage of the Commons. It will be an
  ill day for the nobles when the people shall learn to take vengeance on
  them." And the Senate so wrought that though at the first the Commons in
  their great fury demanded that the Ten should be burned alive, yet they were
  persuaded to yield, it being agreed that each man should be judged by the law
  according to his deserts. Appius, therefore, was accused by Virginius, and
  being cast into prison, slew himself before the day appointed for the trial.
  Oppius also, another of the Ten, whom the Commons hated for his misdeeds next
  after Appius, was accused and died in like manner. As for Claudius, that had
  claimed Virginia for his slave, he was condemned to be banished. And thus at
  the last, the guilty having been punished, the spirit of Virginia had
  rest.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">THE STORY OF VEII</a></h2>

  <p>IN the three hundred and forty-eighth year after the building of the city,
  the truce that had been for now nearly twenty years with the men of Veii
  being ended, ambassadors and heralds were sent thither to demand satisfaction
  for injuries received. So coming to the border of the land they encountered
  an embassy from Veii journeying to Rome. These made request that the Romans
  should not go to Veii before that they themselves had had audience of the
  Senate. Such audience they had, and obtained their petition; to wit, that
  satisfaction should not be demanded that year, because they were much
  troubled by strife among themselves. But in the year following there was war.
  For when the ambassadors came from Rome making the same demand for
  restitution as before, the men of Veil made answer to them in these words:
  "Make haste and depart from the land, else we will give you such answer as
  Lars Tolumnius gave to your fellows."</p>

  <p>Now the story of Lars Tolumnius is this. Fidenæ, that was a colony of
  Rome, revolted to Veii, of which city Lars Tolumnius was king in those days.
  And when the Romans sent ambassadors inquiring of the men of the city why
  they had done this thing, the ambassadors were put to death; and this was
  done, it was said, at the bidding of Tolumnius. But some have sought to
  excuse Tolumnius in this fashion. They say that he was playing at dice, and
  that when the men of Fidenæ came to him asking, "Shall we do well to slay
  these ambassadors of Rome?" he said, "Excellently," not hearing what they
  said, but thinking only of the dice and of his game, for he had at the very
  moment thrown most fortunately. But it cannot be believed that in so great a
  matter he should have been so careless. This Lars Tolumnius was slain
  afterward by Cornelius Cossus in single combat, and his spoils were dedicated
  in the temple of Jupiter, hard by the spoils which King Romulus won from the
  King of Cære.</p>

  <p>When this answer was brought back to Rome, the Senate would have war
  declared against Veii without delay; but the people murmured, saying, "We
  have enough to do already with the Volscians, and why will ye have another
  war with the men of Veii, who will stir up all the Etrurians against you?"
  The tribunes took occasion by this to hinder the matter, and the war was
  delayed.</p>

  <p>The next year there was war with the Volscians, and Anxur, one of their
  chief cities, was taken, and the spoil was given to the soldiers. They were
  greatly pleased with this bounty, and yet more when it was ordained that
  thereafter the soldiers should have pay from the public treasury. And now it
  was resolved, none opposing, that war should be declared against Veii, for
  which war a great army was levied forthwith, the greater part of the soldiers
  offering themselves of their own free will. Thus it came to pass that in the
  three hundred and fiftieth year after the building of the city, Veii was shut
  in.</p>

  <p>In the third year of the siege the men of Veii, being weary of the strife
  which troubled them year by year in the choosing of their magistrates, made
  for themselves a king. But this thing was a grievous offence to the other
  Etrurians, who hated not so much kingship as the man who had been chosen to
  be king. The cause of which hatred was this, that the man, being angry
  because, by the vote of the twelve nations of the Etrurians, another had been
  preferred before him to be high priest, had caused their yearly festival to
  be broken off in the midst, a thing which the Etrurians, than whom was never
  a people more scrupulous in matters of religion, judged to be most impious.
  This thing he did by taking away the actors of plays, who were for the most
  part his own slaves. And now the whole nation, being assembled in council,
  decreed that no help should be given to the men of Veii so long as they
  should be under the rule of a king. But of this decree no mention was made in
  Veii, for the King gave out that if any man talked of such matters he should
  be held guilty of sedition. Nevertheless the Romans, fearing lest the purpose
  of the Etrurians might suffer a change, made the fortifications wherewith
  they had shut in the city to be double, having one face against such sallies
  as the townsmen might make, and the other turned toward Etruria, if perchance
  help should come thence to the city.</p>

  <p>In this year also, because the Romans hoped to take the city by siege
  rather than by assault, winter quarters, a wholly new thing in those days,
  were begun to be built; and it was decreed that the army should abide before
  the city continually, not departing, as the custom had been. at the beginning
  of the winter. About this there was great debate at Rome, the tribunes
  protesting that the nobles had invented this device against liberty,
  contriving that the better part of the Commons should thus be kept away
  perpetually from the city; while the nobles on the other hand protested by
  the mouth of Appius Claudius, son of the decemvir, that in no other way could
  this war be brought to an end, for that it was a grievous waste of time and
  labor that the works which had been made with so much toil in the summer
  should be destroyed or suffered to perish in the winter. "The love of sport,"
  said he, "takes them that hunt to the mountains, where they suffer frost and
  rain without complaint, and shall our soldiers be less enduring when they
  fight for their country? And if the Greeks were content for the sake of a
  woman, to besiege the city of Troy for ten years without ceasing, and that
  far from their country and beyond the sea, shall we refuse to remain for the
  space of a year before a city which is not so much as twenty miles
  distant?"</p>

  <p>While this matter was debated at Rome, the people inclining, for the most
  part, to Appius rather than to the tribunes, there came such tidings from
  Veii as made all men agree that the city must be attacked with all
  steadfastness and energy. The works of the besiegers were now pushed forward
  well-nigh to the walls, and the minds of all being wholly given to the
  finishing of them, it followed, that though they were diligently advanced in
  the day, they were the less carefully watched by night. The townsfolk
  perceiving this, a great multitude of men issued forth from the gates
  carrying torches in their hands, and set fire to the works, consuming in a
  very brief space of time that which had been finished after many months. Not
  a few also of them that would have stayed the burning perished either by fire
  or by the sword. When these tidings were brought to them the city was greatly
  disturbed. Nevertheless the matter turned to the public good. First they that
  had the dignity of horsemen in the State, but were not called to serve, came
  forward saying, that they would serve, finding horses at their own cost;
  likewise a great multitude of the people offered themselves to serve as foot
  soldiers. Thus was there raised a great army, which, marching to Veii, not
  only restored that which had been destroyed by fire, but also made works that
  were larger and stronger by far.</p>

  <p>In the fourth year of the siege the Romans suffered no small loss. First
  Anxur was lost, the garrison being surprised by the Volscians, and afterward
  there followed great reverses at Veii. The men of Capena and Falerii came to
  the help of Veii, judging that if this city should be taken they themselves
  would be the next to perish. These fought against a certain part of the
  Romans, and at the same time the townsfolk sallied from the gates. And when
  help should have been given to them from the other part of the camp, because
  there was a strife between the generals, none such was sent; for the one
  said, "If my colleague be in need of help he will ask for it," and the other,
  for pride and jealousy, had rather be conquered by the enemy than conquer by
  aid of one whom he loved not. So it came to pass that Sergius (for he it was
  whom the men of Capena and Falerii had attacked) with his soldiers left the
  works and fled, some escaping to the other camp, but the greater part making
  escape to Rome.</p>

  <p>In the seventh year of the siege there happened many marvels. Of these,
  for the most part, men took little count; but one seemed especially
  noteworthy, to wit, that the water of the lake of Alba rose to such a height
  as had never been seen before, and this without great rains or any other
  cause which might make the thing less to be wondered at. Messengers therefore
  were sent to the oracle of Delphi to inquire of the god what this might
  portend. But the Romans found, for so fate would have it, an interpreter of
  the marvel that was nearer at hand than the oracle of Apollo. As the Roman
  soldiers and the soldiers of Veii talked together at the outposts, a certain
  old man, an Etrurian, chanted in the fashion that prophets use this
  verse&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Ne'er till the depths of Alba's lake be drained<br>
  Shall Veii's walls by Roman arms be gained."</p>

  <p>Of these words none at first took any heed, but afterward some began to
  doubt what they might mean. A certain Roman therefore inquired of the
  townsfolk (for the siege having now endured for many years there had grown up
  acquaintance between them) who the man might be that had chanted this
  prophecy. And when he heard he was a soothsayer, he spake to him, saying that
  he would fain have some talk with him, for that there had happened to himself
  a certain marvel, and he desired to know how he might rightly deal with it.
  So the two went to certain place by themselves, neither of them carrying
  arms. Then the Roman (for he was a young man and of great strength) caught up
  the Etrurian in his arms and carried him away to the camp, the Etrurians not
  being able to hinder him. So they brought the soothsayer to the general, and
  the general sent him to the Senate; and when the Senate inquired of him what
  it was that he had prophesied concerning the lake of Alba, the old man
  answered, "Surely the Gods were wroth with Veii that day when they put it
  into my mind to betray the thing which by the ordering of fate must bring
  about the destruction of the city. Nevertheless I cannot recall that which I
  once uttered by divine inspiration so that it should be as if it were unsaid;
  and perchance there is no less wickedness in concealing that which the
  immortal Gods would have revealed than in uttering that which they would have
  concealed. Know therefore that in the books of fate and in the lore of the
  Etrurians it is written that if ever the water of the lake of Alba shall
  increase, the Romans, draining it off in due manner, shall prevail over the
  men of Veii, but that before that shall have been done, the Gods will not
  desert the walls of the city." And when he had said this he expounded to them
  what the due manner of draining off the water might be. Nevertheless because
  the man seemed to be of small authority, upon whom it would not be well to
  trust in so great a matter, the Senate determined that messengers should be
  sent to inquire of the god at Delphi.</p>

  <p>In the ninth year of the war these messengers returned, bringing back this
  answer from the god.</p>

  <p class="verse">"Let not imprisoned chafe the Alban Lake,<br>
  Nor yet to sea its wilful passage take;<br>
  Draw high its gates, but in the boundless plain<br>
  Disperse its power, its pride of speed refrain;<br>
  Then mount the breach, for then by Heaven's decree<br>
  Long-leaguered Veii, Roman, yields to thee,<br>
  Thy warfare done, throng thankful to the shrine,<br>
  Repair thy great default, and pay me that is mine."</p>

  <p>When this answer was had the Etrurian soothsayer was held in great honor,
  and the magistrates sought his help that all things might be done duly and in
  order. Especially they desired to know what rites had been neglected, and
  what solemnity left unperformed. As to this they discovered that magistrates
  not appointed according to due order had kept profanely the yearly festival
  of the Latins on the hills of Alba. It was commanded therefore that these
  should resign their office and that all things should be done afresh.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile there was held a council of the tribes of the Etrurians
  at the temple of Voltumna, and when the men of Capena and of Falerii demanded
  that the whole nation should join their forces with one consent, and deliver
  Veii from being besieged, they were thus answered: "Before we denied our aid
  to the men of Veil because they had not asked our counsel in a matter wherein
  such counsel was most needed. But now it is not we but our necessities that
  deny it, and especially in this part of Etruria, for there is come hither
  among us a strange people even the Gauls, with whom we have neither sure
  peace nor open war."</p>

  <p>And now in the tenth year the games and the great festival of the Latins
  had been celebrated anew, and the water had been drained off from the lake of
  Alba, and the day was drawing near when Veii should perish. And because there
  seemed but one man whom the Gods were keeping to do this work for Rome,
  Furius Camillus was chosen Dictator, and Camillus chose Cornelius Scipio to
  be Master of the Horse. And now the general being changed, all things beside
  seemed to be changed also. First Camillus went to the camp that he might
  encourage the soldiers; and afterward he raised a new army in the city,
  neither did any man draw back from the service. The warriors also of the
  Latins and of the Hernici came offering help, to whom the Senate gave public
  thanks. Then the Dictator vowed that he would celebrate the Great Games when
  Veii should have been taken; also he vowed to build anew and dedicate the
  temple of Mother Matuta, which temple King Servius Tullius dedicated at the
  first. And so setting forth, and putting to flight on his way the men of
  Falerii and of Capena, he came to Veii. There he strengthened the works,
  shutting up the enemy more closely than before. Also he commanded that a mine
  should be driven under the very citadel of the town. And that this might not
  be interrupted on the one hand, nor they that did it spent with labor on the
  other, he divided them that made the mine into six companies, and commanded
  that each company should labor for six hours. So the work was carried on
  without ceasing both by night and by day, till the mine was driven into the
  citadel.</p>

  <p>After this, seeing that victory was now in his hands, and considering also
  that he was about to capture a very wealthy city, wherein was such spoil as
  had never before been taken in all the wars of the Roman people, he feared
  lest the soldiers should be provoked to anger if he should seem to grudge
  them the booty, or the Senate blame him if he should be too bountiful.
  Whereupon he wrote a letter in these words: "The favor of the Gods and my own
  counsels and the valor of the soldiers have brought it to pass that Veil will
  soon be in the possession of the Roman people. What then, think ye, should be
  done with the spoil?" On this matter there was great debate in the Senate;
  but at the last it seemed good that proclamation should be made to the
  people: "Whosoever will have a share in the spoil of Veii, let him go to the
  camp to the Dictator."</p>

  <p>This proclamation having been made, a vast multitude set forth, so that
  the camp was filled from the one end to the other. Then the Dictator, after
  duly performing sacrifice, commanded the soldiers that they should arm
  themselves, Afterward he prayed, speaking these words. "Apollo, God of
  Delphi, by whose guidance and bidding I have come to destroy this city of
  Veii, to thee I vow a tenth part of the spoil. And do thou also, Queen Juno,
  that now dwellest in Veii, follow us, I pray thee, to Rome, that is now our
  city and shall soon be thine, where also thou shalt have a temple worthy of
  thy magnificence."</p>

  <p>When he had thus prayed, seeing that he had an exceedingly great multitude
  of men, he attacked the city on all sides at the same time, because the
  inhabitants would be thus at less leisure to observe the peril that was
  threatening them from the mine. As to the men of Veii, they knew not that the
  oracles of the stranger, yea, that their own prophets, had betrayed them,
  that the gods of their land were even now looking to dwell in the temples of
  Rome, and that even now their last day had come; neither did they think that
  their walls had been undermined, and that their very citadel was full of
  enemies. With good heart, therefore, they took up their arms and ran to the
  walls, marvelling what strange fury was this that drave the Romans to attack
  them thus suddenly, seeing that now for many days none had moved in the
  outposts. And some tell this story: that as the king of Veii was doing
  sacrifice, an augur that stood by cried aloud, "To him that shall cut in
  pieces the inwards of this victim shall be given the victory;" and that the
  Roman soldiers, being in the mine below, heard the words, and breaking open
  the mine, laid hands on the victim, and carried it to the Dictator. But
  whether this be true or no, no man can say; nevertheless it is certain that
  at the time appointed a great company of men, chosen for this end, suddenly
  came forth from the mine, in the temple of Juno, which was in the citadel. Of
  these some took the enemy in the rearward as they stood upon the walls, and
  some drew back the bolts of the gates; and others, seeing that the women and
  slaves were casting stones and tiles from the roofs of the houses, began to
  set fire to the city. And now, the armed men being driven from off the wall
  and the gates being thrown open, there ran in many from the host that was
  without And now there was fighting in all the streets and squares of the
  city, and many were slain; till, the men of Veii growing feeble, the Dictator
  proclaimed that all such as did not bear arms should be spared. After this
  there was no more bloodshed; the inhabitants threw down their arms and
  surrendered themselves; and the soldiers, the Dictator permitting them,
  scattered to gather spoil. And when the Dictator saw how great was the spoil
  and of how precious things, being far beyond all hope and expectation, he
  lifted up his hands to heaven and prayed, saying, "If the good fortune of the
  Roman people seem over great to any god or man, I pray that such jealousy may
  be appeased by my own loss rather than by the damage of the State." But as he
  turned him after making this prayer he stumbled and fell. And this omen was
  judged by them that interpreted it by the things that followed, to look first
  to the condemnation of Camillus by the people, and second to the great
  overthrow of the city at the hands of the Gauls; both of which things will be
  related hereafter.</p>

  <p>This day, therefore, was spent in the subduing of the enemy and in the
  plundering of the city; and never indeed was city more wealthy. The next day
  the Dictator sold by public auction all the inhabitants that were of free
  condition; the money from which sale was brought into the public treasury;
  and though none other was so brought the Commons took it ill. And indeed for
  such spoil as each man bare home with him, they thought themselves to be in
  debt not indeed to Camillus, that had referred to the Senate a matter that
  lay within his own power, but to him that had prevailed with the Senate that
  it should be given to the people.</p>

  <p>All the possessions of the men of Veil having been now carried away, the
  Romans began to remove the offerings of the gods and the gods themselves; but
  this they did after the manner of worshippers rather than of plunderers. For
  certain young men, chosen out of the whole host, having first washed their
  bodies in pure water and clothed themselves in white garments, came into the
  temple, having made due obeisance; and so, with much awe, laid their hands on
  the goddess. It was the custom among the Etrurians that none should touch
  that image save the priests only. This having been done, one of the youths,
  whether speaking by inspiration from heaven, or in boisterous jest, cried,
  "Wilt thou away to Rome, Juno?" and the others cried that the image nodded
  her head. In after time it was said that the image even spake the words, "I
  will." Certainly it is related that it was moved from its place with small
  trouble, and that when it was carried to Rome it passed lightly and easily,
  as one that followed freely; and so was brought unhurt to its dwelling on
  Mount Aventine, where was built a temple, according to the vow of the
  Dictator, which temple he himself in due time dedicated.</p>

  <p>Thus perished the city of Veii, than which there was none among the
  Etrurians more wealthy. For ten years was it besieged, both summer and
  winter; and now it fell not so much by force as by the art of the
  engineer.</p>

  <p>The tidings of this thing being brought to Rome there was great rejoicing;
  because, for all the prophecies of the soothsayers and the answers of the
  oracle, and the greatness of Camillus, men had scarce believed that so strong
  a city, from which so much loss had been suffered in time past, would indeed
  be conquered. Straightway the temples were crowded with women that gave
  thanks to the gods. And the Senate decreed a thanksgiving of four days, such
  as never had been decreed before.</p>

  <p>As for the Dictator, when he came back to the city, there went out to meet
  him men of all ranks and conditions. Such honor was rendered to him as had
  never before been rendered to any man. But when he rode through the city in a
  chariot drawn by white horses, men said, "This becometh not a citizen, nor
  indeed a man, how great soever he be. He maketh himself equal to Jupiter or
  Apollo." Afterward, having contracted for the building of a temple to Queen
  Juno on Mount Aventine, and dedicated the temple to Mother Matuta, he
  resigned the dictatorship. And now came the paying of the tenth of the spoil
  to Apollo, according to the vow which Camillus had vowed. For the priests
  affirmed that the people were bound by the vow. It was commanded, therefore,
  that every man should set a price on the spoil which he had carried away from
  Veii, and should pay a tenth part to the god. This also turned away the
  hearts of the Commons from Camillus.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">THE STORY OF CAMILLUS</a></h2>

  <p>IN the next year the Senate would have sent a colony into the country of
  the Volscians, giving to each man two acres of land and more. But the thing
  pleased not the Commons, who said, "Why do ye send us into exile in the land
  of the Volscians while this fair city of Veii lieth within view, having lands
  both wider and more fertile than are the lands of Rome?" The city also they
  preferred to their own, both for its situation and for the magnificence of
  its buildings both public and private. Their counsel, therefore, was that the
  State should be divided, and that the nobles should dwell at Rome and the
  Commons at Veii. But the nobles steadfastly withstood it, saying, "We will
  die rather than that such a thing be done. If there be such trouble in one
  city, how much more, think ye, will there be in two? Will ye prefer a city
  that is vanquished to that which is victorious? Will ye leave Romulus, your
  founder, a god and a son of a god, and follow Sicinius?" (This Sicinius was
  tribune of the Commons and had brought this matter forward.)</p>

  <p>None was more urgent against this counsel than Camillus. "Verily," he
  would say, "there is nothing at which to marvel in these troubles. The whole
  state is mad, for, though it is bound by a vow, it careth for every matter
  rather than how this vow may best be paid. Of that which was paid for the
  tenth, verily a small part in place of the whole, I say nothing. This
  toucheth the consciences of all, but the state is free. But there is another
  matter of which I dare not be silent any more. We have set apart a tenth of
  those things which were movable. Of the city and of the lands ye make no
  mention, yet were these comprehended in the vow." This matter the Senate
  referred to the priests, and the priests, having called Camillus into
  council, gave this sentence: "There is due to Apollo a tenth of all that
  before the uttering of the vow belonged to the men of Veii, and afterward
  came into the power of the Roman people." Thus the city and the lands thereof
  were included. The money, therefore, was paid out of the public treasury; and
  the magistrates were commanded to purchase gold therewith. And when there was
  not found a sufficient quantity of this metal, the matrons, having first met
  and deliberated on the matter, promised that they would themselves supply the
  magistrates with gold, and carried all their ornaments to the treasury. Never
  was anything done that more pleased the Senate than this liberality of the
  women; and, by way of recompense, it was ordered that they should thereafter
  enjoy this privilege, that they should use covered chariots whensoever they
  went to public worship or to the games, and other carriages on any day,
  whether festival or common. Notwithstanding, the tribunes of the Commons were
  still bitter against Camillus. "Verily," they said, by his confiscations and
  consecrations he hath brought the spoil of Veii to nothing."</p>

  <p>The next year there was war with the men of Falerii. These at the first,
  for fear of the Romans, kept themselves within their walls; but afterward,
  not enduring to see the plundering of their lands, came forth, and pitched
  their camp about the space of a mile from the town, in a steep and difficult
  place. But Camillus, for he was the captain of the host, taking for his guide
  a man of those parts that had been made prisoner, left his place by night,
  and showed himself in the morning on ground higher by far. And when the enemy
  assailed him, as he was fortifying his camp, he put them to flight, putting
  them into such fear that they left their camp and fled to the city, but
  suffered much loss of slain and wounded before they could arrive at the
  gates.</p>

  <p>The town was now shut up; but because they that were besieged had better
  supply of corn and other things needful than they that besieged, the matter
  might have been delayed no less than was the taking of Veii, but for the good
  fortune and virtue of Camillus.</p>

  <p>It was the custom among the men of Falerii to use the same person for
  teachers of their children and also for their companions. Also, according to
  the Greek fashion, many boys would be taught by the same man. Now the
  children of the chief citizens of the place were in the charge of a certain
  teacher, that had the repute of excelling all others in knowledge. This man
  had been wont in time of peace to lead the boys out of the city for the sake
  of exercise and sport; and this custom he had not ceased even after the
  beginning of the war, but would take them away from the gates at one time in
  longer at another in shorter journeys. At length he took occasion to lead
  them farther than before, and to bring them, occupying them meanwhile with
  sport and talk, as far as the camp of the Romans. Taking them therefore to
  the tent of Camillus, he said, "I have delivered Falerii into your hands, for
  these boys that ye see are the children of the chief men of the city." To
  this Camillus made answer, "Neither the general nor the people to whom thou
  comest bringing this wicked gift is like unto thyself. With the men of
  Falerii we have not indeed friendship, yet we have with them as with all men
  a natural fellowship. War also has laws even as peace, and to these laws we
  have learnt obedience, even as we have learned courage. Our arms we carry not
  against lads of tender age, who are not harmed even in the storming of
  cities, but against men that carry arms in their hands. These I shall
  conquer, even as I conquered Veii, in Roman fashion, even by valor, by labor,
  and by arms."</p>

  <p>When he had so spoken he commanded that the man should be stripped of his
  clothing, and that his hands should be tied behind his back. In this plight
  he delivered him to the lads to be taken back to the city, giving them rods
  wherewith to scourge the traitor, and drive him back to Falerii. There was a
  great concourse of people to see this sight; and the Senate was summoned by
  the magistrates so consider the matter. So great a change was wrought in the
  minds of men that they who a little before had been obstinate to perish like
  the men of Veii, now with one voice desired peace. Ambassadors therefore were
  sent to Camillus, who, having been bidden by him to go to Rome, had audience
  of the Senate, to whom they spake thus: "Fathers, ye and your generals have
  overcome us in such a fashion as neither gods nor men can blame. We therefore
  surrender ourselves to you, making no doubt that we shall live more happily
  under your government than under our own laws." Peace was granted to them on
  the condition that they should bring the tax for that year, that the burden
  of the Commons might be eased.</p>

  <p>After this the Senate sent three messengers to Delphi bearing with them
  the offering of the Roman people to the god, namely, a mixing-bowl of gold.
  These messengers were taken by pirates of Lipara and carried to that town.
  Now the custom at Lipara was that plunder so taken was divided among the
  people. But the chief magistrate of Lipara for that year, having a reverence
  for the character of ambassadors, and considering also that they were
  carrying an offering to the god, and knowing for what cause this offering was
  made, persuaded the multitude also. The messengers, therefore, were
  entertained at the public expense, and having been sent with a convoy of
  ships to Greece, were so brought back safe to the city of Rome.</p>

  <p>In the fourth year after these things, one Marcus Cædicius, a man of the
  Commons, gave information to the magistrates that in the new street above the
  temple of Vesta he had heard a voice louder than the voice of man, that said
  these words, "The Gauls are coming." No heed was taken of this thing, both
  because the man that told it was of little account, and because the nation of
  the Gauls, dwelling far off, was little known.</p>

  <p>Not only did the people of Rome despise the warnings of the gods, but also
  they deprived themselves, as far as in them lay, of all human help, driving
  away Camillus from their city. For, having been summoned to stand his trial
  by one of the tribunes of the Commons in the matter of the spoil of Veii (and
  it had chanced also that in those same days he had suffered the loss of a son
  that was almost grown to years of manhood), he called together to his house
  the members of his tribe and his dependants, being themselves no small part
  of the Commons, and laid the matter before them. And when they had answered
  him that they would contribute among themselves whatsoever fine he might be
  condemned to pay, but that they could not bring it about that he should be
  acquitted, he went into exile, first putting up to the immortal gods this
  prayer. "If I am not deserving of this wrong, cause, I beseech you, that this
  people may repent them that they have driven me forth." Being absent on the
  day of trial he was condemned to pay fifteen thousand pounds' weight of
  copper.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">THE STORY OF ROME AND THE GAULS</a></h2>

  <p>IN this same year, being the three hundred and sixty and fourth from the
  building of the City, came ambassadors from Clusium asking help of the Romans
  against the Gauls. Now some men say that these Gauls crossed the Alps and
  took to themselves the lands which the Etrurians had before possessed, being
  drawn by the delightsomeness of the things grown therein, especially of wine,
  a pleasure before unknown to them. And they say also that wine was brought
  into Gaul by one Aruns of Clusium for the sake of avenging himself upon a
  certain Lucumo who had taken from him his wife, this Lucumo being a prince in
  his country, whom there was no hope that he could punish unless he should get
  help in some such way from foreigners. However this may be, it is certain
  that the Gauls crossed the Alps before this time by many years, and that they
  fought many battles with the Etrurians. First, in the days of King Tarquinius
  the Elder, one Ambigatus that was king of the Celts, who inhabited the third
  part of Gaul, sent his sister's sons to seek out for themselves new kingdoms,
  of whom one was directed by the oracle to go toward Germany, and the other by
  a far more pleasant way to Italy. These then having come to the Alps wondered
  how they might pass them, the top of them seeming to be joined to the sky.
  And while they doubted there came tidings how certain others, strangers like
  to themselves, and that had come seeking lands wherein to dwell, were
  attacked by the natives of the Salyi. (These strangers were the inhabitants
  of Phocæa, that had fled from their town when it was besieged by Cyrus king
  of Persia.) Having helped the Phocæans to build a city, they themselves
  climbed over the Alps, and, descending on the other side, put to flight the
  Etrurians near the river Ticinus, and formed a city called Mediolanum.</p>

  <p>After these came many companies of Gauls by the same way into Italy, those
  that were now fighting against Clusium being the nations of the Senones. And
  the men of Clusium seeing how great was the multitude of this people, and
  what manner of men they were, being unlike to any that they had seen before,
  and of very great stature, and also what arms they carried, were in great
  fear. Knowing also that the armies of the Etrurians had often been put to
  flight by them, they determined to send ambassadors to Rome, asking help from
  the Senate, though, indeed, they had no claim either for friendship or
  alliance' sake, save only that they had not given succor to their kinsmen of
  Veii. Help the Senate was not willing to give; but they sent three
  ambassadors, brothers and sons of Fabius Ambustus, who should say to the
  Gauls, "In the name of the Senate and Commons of Rome we bid you do no harm
  to them who are allies and friends of the Roman people, and from whom ye have
  suffered no wrong. For them, if occasion demand, we must support even by
  force of arms. Nevertheless it will please us well to be friends rather than
  enemies of the Gauls, of whom we have now for the first time knowledge."</p>

  <p>The message, indeed, was sufficiently gentle, but it was intrusted to men
  of too fierce a temper, that were, indeed, like to Gauls rather than to
  Romans. When the Fabii had set forth the commission in an assembly of the
  Gauls, there was made to them this answer: "We have not, indeed, before heard
  the name of the Romans, but we believe you to be brave men, seeing that the
  men of Clusium have sought to you for help. Seeing that ye would stand
  between us and your allies, and would deal by persuasion rather than by force
  of arms, we accept your conditions; only let the men of Clusium, seeing that
  they possess more land than they need, give up that which is over and above
  to the Gauls. On these terms only will we give peace. Let them answer now in
  your presence. And if they will not give the land, let them fight with us
  also in your presence, that ye may tell your countrymen how far we excel all
  other men in valor." "Nay," said the Romans, "by what right do ye ask land
  from them that possess it, and threaten war to them that refuse? And what
  concern have ye, being Gauls, with the men of Etruria?" To this the Gauls
  made reply in haughty words: "Our right we carry on the points of our swords,
  for to the brave all things belong."</p>

  <p>Thus there was great anger stirred up on both sides; and they made ready
  for battle. And now (for so the destiny of the city of Rome would have it)
  the ambassadors, setting the law of nations at naught, went into the battle.
  Nor was this hidden from the Gauls, for not only were the three conspicuous
  for strength and courage, but one of them, Quintus by name, spurring out
  before the line, slew a chieftain of the Gauls that had fallen upon the
  standards of the Etrurians, running him through with his spear. And the Gauls
  knew him for one of the ambassadors, while he spoiled the body of the arms.
  Straightway the report of this thing was spread through the whole army, and
  the signal was given to retreat, for they thought no more of the Clusines,
  but would have vengeance on the Romans. Some indeed would have had the host
  march straightway; but the elders prevailed, advising that ambassadors should
  be sent complaining of the wrong done, and demanding that the Fabii should be
  given up to them for punishment. So ambassadors were sent, and when these had
  set forth the matter, the Senate was much displeased with the Fabii, and
  confessed that the Gauls demanded only that which was within their right.
  Nevertheless, because the Fabii were men of high degree, favor prevailed
  against justice. But lest they should be blamed if any misfortune followed,
  the Senators referred the decision of the matter to an assembly of the
  people; in which assembly favor and wealth availed so much that the Fabii
  were not only let go unpunished, but were even chosen with three others to be
  tribunes of the soldiers for the year to come. When the ambassadors of the
  Gauls knew what had been done, they were greatly wroth, and returned to their
  countrymen, having first proclaimed war against Rome.</p>

  <p>And now, though so great a peril was at hand, none at Rome thought or
  cared. And indeed it is always thus that they that are doomed to perish have
  their eyes blinded against that which is coming upon them. For though the
  Romans had been wont to use all means of help against enemies near at hand,
  and to appoint a dictator in times of need, yet now, having to deal with an
  enemy of whom they had had before no experience or knowledge, they neglected
  all these things. They whose rashness had brought about the war, having the
  charge of the thing committed to them, used no more diligence in the levying
  of an army than if they were dealing with one of the nations round about, but
  made light of the matter. In the meanwhile the Gauls, when they heard that
  the very men that had set at nought the law of nations had been promoted to
  great honor, were filled with fury, and forthwith snatching up their
  standards, marched toward Rome with all speed. And when the inhabitants of
  the country were terrified at their coming, the dwellers in the cities
  running to arms, and the countryfolk leaving their homes, the Gauls cried out
  to them that they were bound for Rome. Nevertheless the report of their
  coming went before them, messengers from Clusium and from other states
  hastening to Rome, from whose reports, as also from the great speed of the
  enemy, there arose great fear among the Romans. These levied an army with all
  haste and marched forth, meeting the Gauls at the river Allia, where, flowing
  down from the mountains of Crustumeria in a very deep channel, it is joined
  to the Tiber, about eleven miles from Rome. There they found the whole
  country, both in front and on either side, occupied by great multitudes of
  Gauls, and in an uproar with the loud singing and shouting with which this
  nation is wont to terrify its enemies.</p>

  <p>And now the tribunes of the soldiers, having neither pitched a camp nor
  made a rampart to be a defence if they should be driven back, nor taken any
  account of omens, nor offered sacrifice (for they were careless alike of gods
  and of men), drew up their army in array, extending their line lest they
  should be surrounded by the multitude of the enemy. But even then, though
  they so weakened the middle part that their ranks scarce held together, they
  could not make their front equal to the front of the enemy. There was a
  little hill on the right hand, and this they occupied with a reserve. Against
  this reserve Brennus, the king of the Gauls, made his first attack; for
  seeing that the Romans were few in number, he judged that they must excel in
  skill, and that the hill had been thus occupied to the end that the Gauls
  might be assailed from behind while they were fighting with the legions in
  front. He judged, therefore, that if he could thrust down them that were on
  this hill his army might easily deal with the Romans on the plain, seeing
  that they far exceeded them in number. So true is it that on this day the
  barbarians were superior not in fortune only but also in judgment and skill.
  As for the Romans, neither the captains nor the soldiers were in anywise
  worthy of their name. Their souls were wholly possessed with terror, so that,
  forgetting everything, they fled to Veii, that had belonged to their enemies,
  and this though the Tiber was in their way, rather than to Rome, to their
  wives and children. The reserves were defended for a while by the ground
  whereon they stood, but the rest of the army turned their backs forthwith and
  fled so soon as they heard the battle shout of the Gauls. For they sought not
  to come to blows with them, nor even set up a shout in answer; but without
  making trial of the enemy, nor so much as daring to look at him, fled with
  all haste. In the battle, indeed, none were slain; but there was great
  slaughter among the rearward when these were crowded together in such haste
  and confusion that they hindered one another. Many also were slain on the
  bank of the Tiber, whither the whole of the left wing of the host had fled,
  first throwing away their arms; and many also were swallowed up by the river,
  either not knowing how to swim or from lack of strength, being overburdened
  by the weight of their coats of mail and other armor. Nevertheless the
  greater part of the men escaped safe to Veii; but none went from this place
  to the help of Rome, nor did they so much as send tidings of the battle. As
  for them that had been set on the right wing, these all went to Rome; and
  when they were come thither, delayed not even to shut the gate of the city,
  but fled straightway into the citadel. This battle was fought on the
  eighteenth day of the month Quintilis; nor was it ever lawful in Rome
  thereafter to do any public business on that day.</p>

  <p>The Gauls were beyond measure astonished that they had vanquished their
  enemy so easily and in so short a space of time. At the first they stood
  still in fear, not knowing what had taken place; afterward they began to fear
  some stratagem; at last they buried the dead bodies of the slain, and piled
  together the arms in heaps according to their custom. And now, not perceiving
  in any place the sign of an enemy, they began to march forward, and came to
  Rome a little before sunset. But when the horsemen whom they had sent on
  before brought back tidings that the gates were open, with none to defend
  them and no soldiers upon the walls, they were not less astonished than
  before, and came to a halt, fearing lest, in the darkness of the night and in
  a place whereof they knew nothing, they might fall into some peril. They took
  up a station, therefore, between Rome and the river Anio, sending scouts
  about the walls and the gates of the city who should learn what the enemy
  purposed to do in the great extremity whereunto they had been brought.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="chap14"
     id="chap14">THE STORY OF ROME AND THE GAULS (CONTINUED)</a></h2>

  <p>MEANWHILE the city was full of weeping and wailing, for none thought that
  they who had fled to Veii were yet alive, or that any had been saved from the
  battle, save such as were already come back to Rome. But when tidings were
  brought that the Gauls were close at hand, sorrow gave place to fear. And now
  the Gauls were seen to move backward and forward before the walls, and there
  was heard the sound of shouting and of the barbarous music that this people
  use. And still the inhabitants expected till an attack should be made upon
  the city. At first they thought that this would be done at the first coming
  of the enemy; but afterward believed that it would be delayed until
  nightfall, that the terror might be increased by the darkness. Nevertheless
  all men bore themselves bravely, and altogether unlike to them who had turned
  their backs in such shameful fashion at the river Allia. For since there was
  no hope that the city should be defended by the small number that yet
  remained, it was resolved that all the young men that could bear arms,
  together with such of the Senators as had strength sufficient for war, should
  go up with their wives and children to the Citadel and the Capitol, where
  stores of arms and corn having been collected, they might defend the gods of
  Rome and the honor of the State. Also it was determined that the priests of
  Quirinus, and the virgins of Vesta with them, should carry away far from
  peril of fire and sword all that appertained to the gods, that their worship
  might not be interrupted so long as any should be left to perform it. For
  they said, "If the Citadel and the Capitol, wherein are the dwellings of the
  Gods, and the Senate, which is the council of the State, and the youth that
  are of an age to carry arms, survive the destruction that hangs over the
  city, it is but a small matter that the aged should perish." And that the
  common people might bear their fate with the more willingness, the old men of
  the nobles that had been honored in former days with triumphs and consulships
  affirmed that they would meet death together with the rest; neither would
  they burden the scanty stores of the fighting men with bodies that had no
  longer the strength to carry arms.</p>

  <p>When the old men had thus comforted one another they addressed themselves
  to encourage the young. These they accompanied to the Capitol, commending to
  their valor and strength all that now was left of the greatness of Rome. And
  now when they who were resolved that they would not survive the capture and
  destruction of the city had departed, the women ran to and fro asking of
  their husbands and of their sons what they should do. But of these many were
  suffered to follow their husbands and kinsfolk into the Capitol, none
  forbidding, though none called them, for that which would have profited the
  besieged, by diminishing the number of the useless, seemed to be barbarous
  and cruel. As for the rest of the people, for whom there was neither room in
  so small a hill nor food in so scanty a provision of corn, these went forth
  from the city, as it were in a great host, toward the hill Janiculum. Thence
  some scattered themselves over the country, and some made their way to the
  neighboring cities; but there was no leader or common purpose, and each
  concerned himself with his own affairs only, for of the State all despaired.
  Meanwhile the priests of Quirinus and the virgins of Vesta, taking no thought
  for their own affairs, took counsel together which of the sacred things they
  should carry away with them and which they should leave behind, for they had
  not strength sufficient for the carrying of all; also in what place they
  might most safely leave them. It seemed good to them to put such things as it
  was needful to leave behind in a cask and to bury them in the ground within
  the chapel that was hard by the dwelling-house of the priests of Quirinus.
  The rest they carried, dividing the burden of them among themselves, and went
  by the way that leads to the mount Janiculum, over the wooden bridge. And
  while they were mounting the hill, one Lucius Albinius, a man of the Commons,
  saw them, who was carrying his wife and children in a cart amongst the crowd
  that was leaving the city as having no strength for arms. This Albinius
  forgot not even in such peril the reverence due to religion, and thinking it
  shame that the priests with the holy things should go afoot while he and his
  were carried, bade his wife and children come down from the cart, and putting
  therein the virgins, with the sacred things, carried them to Cære, whither it
  had been their purpose to go.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile at Rome all things had been set in order, as far as might be,
  for the defending of the Citadel; and the old men, going back to their homes,
  sat awaiting the coming of the Gauls with minds wholly fixed on death. And
  such among them as had borne the more honorable magistracies, because they
  would die having on them the emblems of their old glory, put on them the
  splendid robes which they wear who draw the ropes of the chariots of the
  gods, or ride in triumph, and so sat down in their ivory chairs before their
  houses. Some say that, following a form of words which Marcus Folius the
  chief priest repeated, they devoted themselves to death for their country and
  for the citizens of Rome.</p>

  <p>The next day the Gauls entered the city by the Colline Gate without any
  anger or fury, for such as had been stirred by the battle had abated during
  the night; and indeed they had met with no peril in the field, nor did they
  now take the city by storm. So they came to the market-place and thence
  looked about them on the Citadel, which alone in the city still preserved
  some semblance of war, and on the temples of the Gods. Here they left a guard
  of no great strength, lest haply some attack should be made upon them from
  the Capitol, while they were scattered; and the rest scattered themselves to
  gather spoil, some seeking in the dwellings that were nigh at hand, and some
  in such as were more distant, thinking that they would find these rather
  untouched and abounding with riches. Thence again, terrified by the silence
  of the place, and fearing lest some stratagem of the enemy might be concealed
  thereby, they returned to the market-place and to the parts adjacent thereto.
  Here finding that the palaces of the nobles were open, and the houses of the
  common folk barred, they were slower to enter the open than the shut, for
  they beheld with no small reverence the men that sat each in the porch of his
  house, noting how great was the splendor of their apparel and their
  ornaments, and that the majesty of their countenances was rather that of gods
  than of men. So they stood marvelling at them as though they had been images
  of the gods, till a certain Marcus Papirius, one of the priests, smote a Gaul
  on the head with his ivory staff, the man having stroked his beard, which it
  was then the custom to wear of a great length. The barbarian in a rage slew
  him, and all the others also were slain where they sat. The nobles having
  thus perished, all others that were found in the city were slaughtered in
  like manner, the houses were plundered, and being emptied of their goods were
  set on fire.</p>

  <p>For a while no small part of the city was spared, for the leaders of the
  Gauls said, "It may be that the hearts of them that keep the Citadel will be
  turned to surrender by the loss of their own homes." These indeed were full
  of grief and anger, seeing the streets of the city full of the enemy, and
  beholding new destructions every hour. Never indeed were men besieged in such
  evil plight, for they were shut out from their country, and saw all their
  possessions in the power of the enemy. For all this their courage failed not
  for one hour, though all about them was laid even with the ground by fire and
  sword, but were obstinate to keep the hill which was now the sole
  abiding-place of freedom. As for their troubles they took no account of them,
  nor had any hope save only in the swords which they carried in their
  hands.</p>

    <p class="caption">The Gauls and the senators.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>The Gauls having spent their fury on the dwellings in the city, seeing
  that the spirit of the Romans was in no wise subdued, but was steadfastly set
  against surrender, resolved to make an assault on the Citadel. Therefore, at
  dawn of day, after signal had been given, they drew up their whole army in
  the market-place; and then, setting up a shout and locking shields over their
  heads in the fashion that is called the "tortoise," they began to climb the
  hill. On the other hand the Romans did nothing rashly or in a hurry; but
  strengthening the guards at every point of attack, set their main body where
  the Gauls were coming; and these they suffered to climb the slope, judging
  that the higher they should have mounted the more easily would they be driven
  down. But when they were come to the middle of the hill, then the Romans ran
  down upon them, and made a great slaughter among them, driving them over the
  steep, so that never again, either with a part of their force or with the
  whole thereof, did they make trial of this manner of fighting. They set
  themselves, therefore, to take the Citadel by blockade. But for this they had
  made no preparation, having burned all the provision of food that was in the
  houses of the city, while that which was in the field had by this time been
  carried into Veii; wherefore, dividing their forces, they set some to keep
  watch on the Citadel, and some they sent to gather spoil in the country round
  about.</p>

  <p>Now they that were sent to gather spoil came by chance to Ardea, in which
  city Camillus dwelt, grieving for his country rather than for himself, and
  marvelling what had befallen the men who with him had conquered Veii and
  Falerii. And now, hearing that the Gauls were near at hand, and that the men
  of Ardea, being in no small fear, were taking counsel about the matter, he
  came forward in the assembly and spake thus: "Men of Ardea, ye have now
  opportunity to repay the benefits which ye have received from the Roman
  people, concerning which benefits, how many and how great they be, there is
  no need that I remind you. And ye have opportunity also to win for yourselves
  great renown. These Gauls that are coming against you are great in stature
  rather than in strength, and make a terrible show in battle, but yet are not
  hard to withstand. For consider what has befallen Rome. They took the city
  when all the gates lay open; but now the Citadel, though it is kept by a
  small company, they are not able to take. Wearied already of besieging it,
  they are scattering themselves over the face of the land to gather spoil.
  Their manner is to gorge themselves with meat and great draughts of wine, and
  at nightfall to throw themselves on the ground like beasts, without defence
  or outposts or guards. And now by reason of their late victory they are
  careless even beyond their wont. If then ye would keep your city safe, and
  would not have this whole land become a part of Gaul, take all of you your
  arms at the first watch of the night. Follow me, and if I deliver them not in
  your hands, fast bound with sleep, to be slaughtered as cattle, then banish
  me even as the Romans banished me."</p>

  <p>Now all that heard him knew that there was no man so great in war as he.
  Therefore, when the assembly was dismissed, they refreshed themselves and
  waited eagerly till he should give the signal. And when they heard it, they
  hastened to the gate of the city to meet Camillus; nor had they gone far from
  the city when they found the camp of Gauls was, as Camillus foretold,
  altogether without guards; and setting up a shout they fell upon it. No
  fighting was there, but only a great slaughter, for the men were naked and
  overpowered with sleep. Some also that were in the furthest part of the camp,
  being awakened by the uproar, and not knowing what had happened, fell into
  the hands of the enemy; and many going forth to plunder the lands of the men
  of Antium fell upon a company of the townsfolk, and were surrounded and
  slain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the Gauls watched the Citadel at Rome, that none should go forth
  between the posts. And now there was done by a Roman youth a thing which both
  friends and foes greatly admired. The house of the Fabii had a yearly
  sacrifice on the Hill of Quirinus. A certain Quintus Fabius Dorso, therefore,
  that he might duly perform this sacrifice, came down from the Capitol, clad
  in the vestment that is used for such purpose, and carrying the holy things
  in his hands, and so came to the Hill of Quirinus, passing through the midst
  of the guards of the enemy, and heeding not their speech or threatening.
  There he duly performed all the ceremony, and, coming back by the same way,
  with look and step composed as before, returned to his friends in the
  Capitol, having a good hope that the gods, whose service he had not neglected
  for any extremity of fear, looked upon him with favor. As for the Gauls, they
  did him no harm, either for wonder at his boldness, or for religion's sake,
  for which indeed this people had no small regard.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile they that were at Veii gathered daily both courage and strength,
  for not only did the Romans that had escaped from the battle or fled from the
  city assemble themselves there, but volunteers also from Latium flocked
  thither, hoping to share in the spoil of the enemy. And now it seemed high
  time that they should deliver their country out of the hand of the Gauls;
  only, though the body was strong, there yet lacked a head. Then, because the
  place wherein they were reminded them of Camillus, and because many of the
  soldiers had had him for their captain in time past, they all agreed that he
  should be sent for from Ardea. But first they would consult the Senate at
  Rome, so careful were they of law, not forgetting for all their extremity of
  peril that which was right to be done. Now there was no small danger in
  passing through the posts of the enemy. This a certain Cominius, a young man
  and of great activity, undertook to do; and he, supporting himself on corks,
  was carried down the Tiber as far as the city. There, climbing the side that
  was nearest to the river, where the rock was steep, and for that cause left
  unguarded by the Gauls, he climbed into the Capitol; and then, being brought
  before the magistrates, delivered to them the message of the army. Then the
  Senate passed a decree that Camillus, having been first in due form released
  from exile, should be Dictator, so that the soldiers might have him for
  captain whom they desired. With this decree the messenger returned to Veii by
  the same way by which he came, and messengers went to fetch Camillus from
  Ardea.</p>

  <p>While these things were being done at Veii, the Citadel of Rome had been
  in great peril, for the Gauls either had seen the footmarks where the
  messenger from Veii had climbed into the Capitol, or had observed for
  themselves that there was an easy ascent by the rock of Carmentis. On a
  moonlight night, therefore, having first sent a man unarmed to make trial of
  the ascent, they set out. Their arms they handed one to the other, and when
  there was any hindrance in the way they supported or drew up each other, and
  so climbed to the top, and this so silently that they did not even wake the
  dogs, though these animals are very watchful for any noise that may take
  place in the night. But they escaped not the notice of the geese, for there
  were geese in the Capitol, and these, being sacred to Juno, they had not
  eaten, though being sorely in need of food. And this regard for holy things
  was their salvation. For a certain Marcus Manlius, being awoke by their cries
  and by the flapping of their wings, hasted forth, catching up his arms, and
  calling all the rest to do likewise. And they indeed were at first in great
  confusion, but Manlius drave the boss of his shield against a Gaul, for one
  was now standing on the very top of the hill. And the man fell and overthrew
  them that stood close at hand; and when the others in great fear dropped
  their arms and laid hold of the rocks, he fell upon them and slew them. By
  this time others also had rallied to him, and these, throwing javelins and
  stones upon the Gauls, beat them down, so that the whole company were
  overthrown and fell headlong down the steep. The rest of that night they
  slept, so far as they could for remembrance of the great peril from which
  they had been delivered; and at dawn all the soldiers were summoned to an
  assembly by sound of the bugle, it being needful to give due recompense both
  to that which had been well and that which had been ill done. First Manlius
  received both praises and gifts for his valor, and this not only from the
  captains, but from the common consent of the soldiers, every man carrying to
  his house, which was in the Capitol, half a pound of corn and half a pint of
  wine, a gift which seems indeed very small in the telling, but yet was a
  great proof of affection, the great scarcity of all things which prevailed at
  the time being considered, since all subtracted something from their
  necessary food to give it to this one man. After this the guards that had
  been set to watch the place by which the enemy had climbed up the hill were
  summoned to the assembly. Of these, though Sulpicius, tribune of the
  soldiers, had affirmed that he would deal with all of them according to
  military custom, only one was punished, all agreeing to throw the chief blame
  on him, and he, being beyond all doubt guilty in the matter, was by common
  consent cast down from the rock. After this the watch was kept more
  diligently on both sides, for the Gauls knew that messengers had gone to and
  fro between Veii and Rome, and the Romans remembered from how great a peril
  they had escaped.</p>

  <p>Beyond all other evils of war famine troubled both armies. The Gauls were
  vexed with pestilence also, having their camp in low ground that lay among
  hills, and was scorched with the burning of the houses. If there was anything
  of wind also, this brought with it not dust only but ashes. All these things
  and the heat of the year the Gauls, who are accustomed to wet and cold, were
  little able to endure, so that they died, as it were, in herds; so that their
  fellows, wearied of burying the dead one by one, made great heaps of their
  carcases and burned them with fire. And now a truce was made with the Romans,
  and conferences held. In this the Gauls spake much of the famine as being
  good cause of surrender; whereupon, it is said, the Romans threw loaves of
  bread among their posts, as if to show them that there was no scarcity among
  them. Nevertheless their hunger was such that now it could neither be hidden
  nor endured. Wherefore, while Camillus levied an army at Ardea, the garrison
  of the Capitol, worn out with watching, and yet able to endure all other ills
  save hunger only, seeing that the help they looked for came not, and that
  when the guards went forth to their watch they could scarce for weakness
  stand up under their arms, were resolute that they should either surrender or
  ransom themselves on such terms as might be had. And this they did the more
  readily because the Gauls had made it plain that they might be persuaded by
  no great sum of money to give up the siege. The Senate, therefore, was called
  together, and the matter was intrusted to the tribunes of the soldiers. After
  this a conference was held between Sulpicius and Brennus, king of the Gauls,
  by whom it was agreed that a thousand pounds' weight of gold should be the
  ransom of a people that was thereafter to rule the world; a shameful thing,
  made yet more shameful by insult. For the Gauls bringing false weights which
  the tribune refused, King Brennus threw his sword into the scale that held
  the weights, saying at the same time words that no Roman could endure; "Woe
  to the vanquished!"</p>

  <p>But both gods and men forbade that Rome should be ransomed in this
  fashion. For before the payment was made, the whole quantity of gold not
  having been weighed by reason of this dispute, the Dictator coming up
  commanded that the gold should be taken away, and bade the Gauls depart.
  These indeed made opposition, affirming that the covenant had been made and
  must be performed; to which Camillus made answer that it had been made
  without his permission by a lower magistrate, he being at the time Dictator,
  and he warned the Gauls to make them ready forthwith to battle. To his own
  men he gave command that they should throw their baggage into a heap and gird
  on their arms. "Ransom your country," said he, "with steel rather than with
  gold, having before your eyes the temples of the Gods, your wives, your
  children, and all which ye most desire." After this he drew up in line of
  battle, as well as the place permitted, being covered with the ruins of the
  city. The Gauls, troubled by these things, which had happened beyond all
  their expectations, took up their arms and ran upon the Romans with much rage
  but little skill. And now (such change was there in fortune) they were put to
  flight no less easily than they had put the Romans to flight at Allia. There
  was yet another battle between the Gauls and the Romans; and this was fought
  at the eighth milestone on the road to Gabii, for to this place they had fled
  from Rome. Here there was slaughter without end. The camp of the Gauls was
  taken, and all perished, so that not so much as one was left to carry home
  the tidings. Then Camillus returned in triumph to Rome, being greeted by the
  soldiers in their rude fashion as a second Romulus, the true father and
  founder of his country.</p>

  <p>Having now saved Rome by war, he saved it beyond all doubt in peace also,
  for he forbade the people to depart from the city and take up their dwelling
  at Veii, which counsel was urged more diligently by the tribunes now that the
  city had been burned by fire, the commons being not a little inclined
  thereto. But Camillus, that he might the more effectually hinder it, resigned
  not his office of dictator, according to custom, after his triumph, but still
  kept it till all these things were brought to an end.</p>

  <p>First, being always careful of things that concerned the gods, he proposed
  that all the temples should be duly restored and purified; that the people of
  Cære should be admitted to the friendship of the Roman people, because they
  had given shelter to the priests and the virgins and the sacred things, and
  that games should be held in honor of Jupiter of the Capitol as having
  delivered the city from the enemy. The gold that had been taken from the
  Gauls, with that which had been taken from the temples, no one knowing to
  whom or to what place it appertained, was to be laid beneath the throne of
  Jupiter. To the matrons public thanks were given, with this honor, that they
  should be praised with funeral orations in like manner with men. Then he
  spake about the counsel of departing to Veii, showing them many causes why
  they should refuse it, and this above all others, that it was not lawful to
  worship the gods of their country in any other place but only in Rome. But
  that which prevailed with them more than all the speech of Camillus was a
  word spoken by chance. While the Senate debated the matter in the Hall of
  Hostilius, certain cohorts that were returning from keeping the guards passed
  through the market-place, whereupon a centurion cried out, "Standard-bearer,
  set up thy standard. We shall best remain in this place." And when the Senate
  heard these words they exclaimed with one voice, "We accept the omen;" and
  the multitude of the people that stood around approved.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap15"
     id="chap15">THE STORY OF MANLIUS OF THE TWISTED CHAIN</a></h2>

  <p>THERE dwelt in Rome a certain Lucius Manlius, of the kindred of that
  Manlius that thrust down the Gauls from the Capitol, and men gave him the
  surname of Imperious by reason of the haughtiness of his temper. This Manlius
  was made dictator for this one purpose, that he might drive a nail into the
  wall of the temple of Jupiter. For it had been a custom in old time that
  whoever was chief magistrate at Rome should drive a nail in this place on the
  fifteenth day of the month September, to the end that the number of the year
  might thus be marked, there being in those days but small use of letters and
  figures; and this nail was driven into the wall that looks toward the temple
  of Minerva, because Minerva is the goddess of numbers. But in the days of
  Manlius this custom had been long since forgotten; and when it chanced that a
  pestilence came upon the city and nothing else availed to stay it (for
  besides other things stage players were brought from Etruria to make a show
  that might appease the anger of the gods), certain old men remembered that in
  former years such plagues had been stayed by the appointing of a dictator to
  drive in a nail. This Manlius then was thus appointed; but when he had done
  his office he conceived the purpose of carrying on war against the Hernici,
  and would have levied an army but that the tribunes of the Commons hindered
  him.</p>

  <p>In the beginning of the next year one of the tribunes, Pomponius by name,
  brought Manlius to trial, bringing sundry accusations against him. For in the
  levy that he sought to make he had dealt cruelly with them that answered not
  to their names, causing some to be beaten with rods and casting others into
  prison. His surname also was proof sufficient that he was of such a temper as
  could not be endured in a free state. "And this temper," said the tribune,
  "he had shown not to strangers only, but even to those that are of his own
  blood. His own son, a young man uncondemned of any crime, he has banished
  from the city and from his home, forbidding him to have any converse with his
  fellows, and compelling him to work after the fashion of a slave. And for
  what fault in the young man, think ye, that he hath done this thing? Because
  he is not eloquent or ready of speech. But should not a father, if there be
  any natural kindness in him, seek to apply remedies to such defects rather
  than to punish them? Even the brute beasts, if their offspring chance to be
  ill-shaped, are the more careful to nourish and cherish it. But this Manlius
  has rather increased the affliction of his son, and made his wits yet slower
  than they were, extinguishing such natural power as he may have by causing
  him to dwell among the beasts of the field."</p>

  <p>This accusation stirred great anger against the father in all men save
  only in the son himself. For when the young man knew that an accusation had
  been made against his father on his account he was much troubled. And that
  both gods and men might know that he desired to give help to his father
  rather than to the enemies of his father, he conceived a plan which indeed
  ill became a citizen and one who would be obedient to the laws, yet still was
  to be commended for its piety. Girding himself with a knife he came, none
  knowing his purpose, early in the morning to the city, and went straightway
  from the gate to the house of Pomponius the tribune. Then he said to the
  porter, "I must needs speak forthwith with your master. Tell him that Titus
  Manlius, son of Lucius Manlius, seeks him." The tribune, thinking that the
  young man had come full of anger against his father, to bring, it might be,
  some new accusation, commanded that he should be brought into his chamber.
  When they had greeted one another Manlius said, "I have somewhat to say to
  thee which thou must hear alone." So the tribune bade all that were present
  withdraw themselves. This being done Manlius drew his dagger, and standing
  over the bed, threatened that he would run him through therewith unless he
  should swear in words that he would himself dictate that he would never hold
  a meeting of the Commons before which to bring his father to judgment. The
  tribune, fearing the steel which glittered before his eyes, and knowing that
  the young man was not only of exceeding strength but also of a very fierce
  and savage temper, and being himself without arms, sware as he was bidden,
  and afterward told what had taken place, showing that he had given up his
  purpose under compulsion. The people took it ill that they could not sit in
  judgment on a man of so cruel a temper; nevertheless they commended his son
  for his piety; and all the more because the harshness of his father had not
  extinguished in him his natural affection. The father indeed escaped not,
  being brought to trial, and the son reaped from the matter this reward, that
  in the following year, when the people for the first time, for so it chanced
  to happen, chose their tribune in the army, he was so chosen, having the
  second place among six, and this though he had done nothing either at home or
  abroad which might commend him to their favor.</p>

  <p>In the year following there was a war with the Gauls, who had pitched
  their camp three miles only from Rome on the other side of the river Anio. A
  certain Quinctius Pennus, being made dictator, gathered a great army and
  encamped on the near side, of the river. Now between the two armies there was
  a bridge, which neither the one nor the other would break down, lest they
  should seem to fear the enemy. For this bridge many battles were fought; and
  it could not be told, so equal was the strength on either side, to whom it
  belonged. At a certain day there came forth a Gaul of exceeding great stature
  and stood upon the bridge, crying with a loud voice, "Hear now, ye men of
  Rome, let the bravest man that ye have among you come forth, and let him
  fight with me; and according as I shall prevail over him, or he prevail over
  me, so shall we know whether Gauls or Romans are the better in war."</p>

  <p>For a long time there was silence among the Roman people, for they were
  ashamed to refuse the battle, yet were loath to take the very first place in
  this great peril. Then Titus Manlius, the son of Lucius, came forth, and said
  to the Dictator, "I would never fight out of my due place in the host without
  thy bidding, not even though I should see victory clearly assured. But now,
  if thou wilt suffer me, I would gladly show to that brute beast that shows
  himself so confidently before the standards of the enemy that I am of the
  name of Manlius and of the kindred of him that drave down the Gauls from the
  Capitol." To him the Dictator made answer, "Thou doest well, Manlius, with
  thy valor and thy piety, both toward thy country and thy father. Go thou and
  show, the Gods helping thee, that a Roman cannot be conquered." Then his
  comrades armed the youth, giving him the long shield of a foot soldier and a
  Spanish sword, which, for its shortness, was well suited for fighting in
  close combat. Then they led him forward against the Gaul; and even noted how,
  for scorn of his enemy, the barbarian thrust out his tongue. So the two stood
  together between the armies, being ill matched, if one would judge by the
  appearance. The Gaul, indeed, was of exceedingly great stature, and was clad
  in a garment of many colors, and his arms were painted and inlaid with gold.
  As for the Roman, he was of the middle stature, such as is commonly to be
  seen among soldiers, his bearing being without pride, and his arms fitted for
  use rather than for show. He used no song of defiance, nor leaping from the
  ground, nor idle shaking of his arms; but kept his courage and wrath silent
  within his heart, nor showed his fierceness till the combat itself should
  need it. So they stood, and the two armies regarded them with hope and fear.
  First the Gaul, being like to some great mass that was ready to crush
  everything under it, thrusting forward his shield on his left arm, dealt a
  great blow on the armor of Manlius with his sword, striking with the edge
  (for the swords of the Gauls had no points), but harming him not, though the
  sound of it was great. But the Roman, first thrusting aside the shield of the
  enemy with his own shield, ran in close upon him, so that the man could not
  strike him&mdash;his sword being over long&mdash;and so driving his sword
  pointwise from beneath, smote him twice in the belly and in the groin, so
  that he fell his whole length upon the ground. And as he lay, he stripped
  from his body, to which he did no other harm, a chain of twisted gold that
  the man wore, and threw it, covered with blood as it was, about his own neck.
  Meanwhile the Gauls stood still for fear and wonder; but the Romans running
  forth with joy from their ranks to meet their champion, so led him to the
  Dictator. From this deed Titus Manlius was called "Manlius of the Twisted
  Chain;" and this name he handed down to his descendants after him.</p>

  <p>About twenty years after this deed there was a great war between the
  Romans and the Latins (for the Latins demanded that one consul should always
  be of their nation, and, this being denied to them, made war against Rome)
  and this same Manlius was consul. Now it was needful that there should be
  discipline of the strictest sort in the army; and also, because the Latins
  spake the same tongue as did the Romans, and had their arms and all other
  things that appertained to war the same, the Consuls issued a decree that no
  man should fight with the enemy, save only at his post in the army.</p>

  <p>Now it chanced that Titus Manlius, son of the Consul, being captain of a
  squadron of horsemen, rode so far with his squadron (the horsemen being sent
  out in all directions to spy out the country) that he was scarce the length
  of a spear's throw from the camp of the enemy, at a certain part where the
  horsemen of Tusculum had their station. The leader of these horsemen was
  Metius, a certain man of noble birth and renowned among his countrymen for
  his valor. This Metius, seeing the Roman horsemen, and Manlius the Consul's
  son riding in the front, and knowing him who he was (for indeed all the men
  of note in the two armies were known to each other), cried out, "Are ye
  minded, ye men of Rome, being but one squadron, to do battle with the Latins
  and their allies? What are the Consuls doing, and their two armies?" To this
  Manlius made answer, "They will come in due time; aye, one that is mightier
  than they, even Jupiter, will come also: Jupiter, who is witness to the
  treaties which ye have broken. If at the Lake Regillus we fought with you
  till we were weary, so here also we will give you such entertainment as ye
  shall little like." Then said Metius, "Art thou willing, then, in the mean
  while while the day on which ye will make so mighty a stir is yet coming, to
  fight here with me, that from the issue of our meeting all men may know by
  how much a Latin horseman is better than a horseman of the Romans?" Thereupon
  anger, or shame that he should seem to shrink from such combat, or, it may
  be, the will of fate, that none may escape, stirred the young man's haughty
  spirit, so that, taking no account of his father's commands or of the decree
  of the Consuls, he thrust himself headlong into a combat in which it mattered
  but little whether he was vanquished or no. The other horsemen removed
  themselves far off to look at the combat, leaving a space of clear ground for
  the two, who, driving their horses over the plain, met in the midst with
  their spears levelled. The spear of Metius crossed the horse's neck of
  Manlius, and the spear of Manlius passed above the head of the Latin. After
  this they wheeled their horses about, and Manlius, rising first to deal a
  second blow, smote the horse of the Latin between the ears; and when the
  horse felt the wound he reared himself upon his hind legs and shook off his
  rider; and when the man, sorely shaken by so grievous a fall, would have
  raised himself by help of his shield and spear, the Roman smote him with his
  spear in the throat, so that the point came out through his ribs, making him
  fast to the earth. Then Manlius gathered the spoils from the dead man, and
  rode back to the camp, his squadron following him with great joy. Being come
  to the camp, he went to the general's tent, knowing not what fate awaited him
  or whether he had earned praise or punishment. Then he said to his father, "I
  desired that all men should know that I am truly thy son; and therefore,
  having been challenged to combat, I fought, and now bring back these spoils
  from the enemy whom I slew." But the Consul, so soon as he heard these words,
  turning his face from his son, commanded that the bugle should be sounded and
  the soldiers called to an assembly. And when the men had come together in
  great numbers, he said, "Titus Manlius, thou hast had no respect to the
  authority of the Consuls or to the dignity of thy father, and, disobeying our
  decree, hast fought with the enemy elsewhere than in thy place, loosening
  thereby, so far as in thee lay, that military discipline by which up to this
  time the commonwealth of Rome hath stood and been established. And me thou
  hast brought into these straits, that I must forget either the commonwealth
  or myself and my own kindred. Rather, therefore, will we suffer ourselves for
  our own fault than suffer the commonwealth to suffer for us at so great a
  loss to itself. Truly we two shall be a warning, sad indeed yet wholesome, to
  our youth in time to come. As for myself, I am truly troubled, not only by
  that love for my children which is natural to all men, but also by the valor
  which, led astray by a false appearance of glory, thou hast shown this day.
  Nevertheless, seeing that the Consuls' power must either be established for
  ever by thy death or abolished for ever by thy escape, I judge that thou
  thyself also, if there is aught of my blood in thee, wilt not refuse to die,
  and so establish again that military discipline which thou hast weakened by
  thy misdoing. Go, lictor, bind him to the stake."</p>

  <p>All that were present in the assembly stood stricken with terror at so
  cruel a command, and stood silent, but rather from fear than from obedience,
  each seeming to see the axe made ready against himself. Thus were they
  overwhelmed with astonishment, and stood holding their peace. But when the
  young man's head was smitten off and the blood was seen to pour forth, then,
  recovering themselves, they cried aloud and spared neither lamentations nor
  curses. Afterward for the young man they made a soldier's funeral with all
  the zeal that they could show, covering his body with the spoils of war and
  burning it on a pile in a place without the rampart of the camp. From that
  day, when the men would speak of some savage command or exercising of power,
  they are wont to call it a "Manlian rule." As for Titus Manlius the father,
  when he came back in triumph to Rome (for the Romans were victorious in the
  war, as will be told hereafter) the elders only went forth to meet him; the
  young men, both then and ever afterward, so long as he lived, turned from him
  with hatred and curses.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap16"
     id="chap16">STORIES OF CERTAIN GREAT ROMANS</a></h2>

  <p>IN the three hundred and ninety-third year after the building of the city
  there was seen suddenly to open in the market-place a great gulf of a
  deepness that no man could measure. And this gulf could not be filled up
  though all the people brought earth and stones and the like to cast into it.
  But at the last there was sent a message from the gods that the Romans must
  inquire what was that by which more than all things the State was made
  strong. "For," said the soothsayer, "this thing must be dedicated to the Gods
  in this place if the commonwealth of Rome is to stand fast for ever." And
  while they doubted, one Marcus Curtius, a youth that had won great renown in
  war, rebuked them saying, "Can ye doubt that Rome hath nothing better than
  arms and valor?" Then all the people stood silent; and Curtius, first
  beholding the temples of the immortal gods that hung over the market-place
  and the Capitol, and afterward stretching forth his hands both to heaven
  above and to this gulf that opened its mouth to the very pit, as it were, of
  hell, devoted himself for his country; and so, being clothed in armor and
  with arms in his hand, and having his horse arrayed as sumptuously as might
  be, he leapt into the gulf; and the multitude, both of men and women, threw
  in gifts and offerings of the fruits of the earth, and afterward the earth
  closed together.</p>

    <p class="caption">Curtius leaping into the chasm.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>About the space of thirteen years after these things there was again war
  with the Gauls; and when the Romans had levied a great army of ten legions of
  men, Camillus the Consul (being son to that Camillus that had delivered the
  city in time past) marched therewith into the Latin plain, and pitched his
  camp near to the marshes by the sea, over against the camp of the Gauls.</p>

  <p>And while the two armies lay quiet, a Gaul of great stature, and having
  splendid arms, came forth, who, striking his shield with his spear, by way of
  token that he would have silence, challenged by the mouth of an interpreter
  any one that would of the men of Rome to do battle with him. Thereupon a
  certain Marcus Valerius, thinking that he might win for himself like renown
  with Manlius, that was surnamed of the Twisted Chain, came forth fully armed
  into the space between the two armies, having first obtained permission of
  the Consul. When these two were about to join battle, a crow lighted suddenly
  upon the helmet of Valerius, with his face toward the Gaul. And Valerius
  received it with joy as an augury sent from heaven, crying out, "May the god
  or goddess that has sent this bird of good omen to me be favorable to me and
  succor me." Then, marvellous to relate, the bird not only remained steadfast
  in the place whereupon it had lighted, but as soon as the two began to fight
  together, raised itself upon its wings, and wounded with its beak and claws
  the face and eyes of the enemy, so that, terrified by so marvellous a thing,
  he was easily slain by Valerius. Now, up to this time the foremost lines of
  both armies had remained quiet; but when Valerius began to strip the spoils
  from the body of the dead man, the Gauls ran forward to hinder him. Then with
  yet greater speed ran the Romans to his help; and there was a great fight
  about the dead body. And Camillus seeing that the men were confident by
  reason not only of the valor of Valerius, but also of the manifest favor of
  the Gods, he cried aloud, "Soldiers, do as Valerius hath done, and slay
  multitudes of Gauls as he hath slain their champion." Thus was there won a
  great victory over the Gauls, for though some of them fought valiantly, the
  greater part fled before even the Romans had come within a spear's cast of
  them. As for Valerius, he was made Consul in the year following, though he
  was but twenty and three years of age (it was not lawful in those days that a
  man should be Consul till he was forty and two years of age); and he and his
  posterity after him had for themselves the surname of Corvus, which is, being
  interpreted, a crow.</p>

  <p>In the four hundred and twelfth year after the building of the city there
  was war between the Romans and the Samnites, in which war, when the one
  Consul, Valerius, had won a great victory, the other, Cornelius, was well
  nigh destroyed together with his army. For, leading his soldiers into a
  certain narrow pass, he did not perceive that it was surrounded on all sides
  by the enemy, and that these were also on the higher ground above him. And
  while he doubted what he should do (for it was no longer possible that he
  should return by the same way by which he came), a certain Decius Mus, being
  a tribune of the soldiers, perceived a hill above the camp of the enemy, and
  that this hill might easily be climbed by soldiers lightly armed. Thereupon
  he said to the Consul, "Cornelius, seest thou that hill? Thereby we may save
  ourselves if we only make haste and occupy it; for the Samnites are blind
  that they have not occupied it before. Give me only the front rank and the
  spearmen of one legion; and when with these I shall have climbed to the top,
  do thou move forward with the legions, fearing nothing, for the Samnites
  cannot follow thee, having to pass this hill. As for us, the fortune of the
  Roman people or our own valor will deliver us." And when he had said this,
  leading his men by secret paths, he climbed to the top of the hill, the
  Samnites not perceiving what he did. And while these doubted what they should
  do for wonder and fear, the Consul escaped with his army. As to Decius also,
  they knew not whether they should surround the hill on all sides, and so shut
  him in, or, leaving a way open, should attack him when he should have come
  down to the plain. And while they doubted, darkness came upon them.</p>

  <p>At the first Decius thought that the enemy would come up the hill against
  him, and that he should fight against them with advantage from the higher
  ground, but when they neither came nor yet began to build a rampart round the
  hill, he called his centurions to him and said, "What ignorance or indolence
  is this in these men, that they sit still and do nothing when they might by
  this time have shut us in? Surely we shall be as bad as they if we stop
  longer in this place than shall be convenient to us. Come then with me, and
  while there is yet some light, let us see where they have set their guards,
  and where we may find a way of departing from this place." So the centurions,
  having clad themselves in the garb of common soldiers, lest the enemy should
  know them, spied out the nature of the place. Afterward, when he had posted
  the sentinels, he commanded that the rest of the soldiers should assemble at
  the second watch. To them he said, "Ye must hear my words in silence, not
  signifying your assent by a shout in soldiers' fashion. Such as shall approve
  my counsel let them come over to the right side; and if the greater part of
  you shall so come, we will abide by it. The enemy having neglected to occupy
  this place at the first, have neglected also to shut us in with a rampart.
  Stay we cannot, lest we perish with hunger and thirst. Sally forth we must,
  if we are to be delivered. And if we wait for day, can we doubt that the
  enemy will do that which he should have done long since, and make a ditch and
  a rampart about the place? Night therefore is the better time, and if the
  night, then also this hour of the night is better than all others; for at
  this second watch the sleep of men is commonly the deepest. Follow me
  therefore even as ye have followed me hitherto. Let them to whom this counsel
  seems good come over to the right side." They came over all of them, and
  followed Decius as he led the way by a place which the enemy had left without
  guards. But when they were now come to the middle of the camp, one of the
  Romans, as he would have stepped over a sleeping man, stumbled upon his
  shield and so woke him. The man roused his neighbor, and he again others; and
  Decius, perceiving that he was discovered, commanded his men to shout; and
  the Samnites, being confused and scarcely yet awake, nor able to bestir
  themselves, could not hinder him and his men from escaping.</p>

  <p>The next day, after he had entered the camp of the Consul (for though he
  reached it before the night was spent, he would not enter till it was day,
  thinking that they came back to their countrymen with such glory as should
  not be concealed by darkness), Cornelius summoned the soldiers to assembly
  and began to set forth the praises of Decius. But Decius said, "I would
  counsel, Cornelius, that you postpone everything to the occasion of victory
  that is now given you. Attack the enemy while they are in confusion and
  scattered, for doubtless many have been sent to pursue me." This the Consul
  did, and won a great victory over the Samnites, and took their camp, wherein
  were slain, it is said, thirty thousand men.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>As for Decius, the Consul gave him a golden crown and a hundred oxen,
  whereof one was white and of surpassing beauty, having gilded horns. And to
  each of the soldiers that had followed him he gave a double portion of corn
  for ever and an ox and two garments. And the legion set on the head of Decius
  a crown of grass, by which was signified deliverance from siege; his own men
  also gave him another such crown. Then Decius sacrificed the white ox to
  Mars, and gave the other oxen to his soldiers. To these men the rest of the
  legions made a contribution, a pound of corn and a pint of wine for each.</p>

  <p>In the third year after these things, Decius being then Consul together
  with Manlius, there was a great war with the Latins. And while the armies lay
  over against each other in a place near to the city of Capua, there appeared
  to both Consuls, as they slept, the same figure of a man, only of greater
  stature and of more dignity than belongs to man, which figure spake to each
  the same words: "There is due to the Gods that dwell below, and to Mother
  Earth, from the one side a general, and from the other an army. And on which
  side soever of these two a general shall devote himself, together with the
  army of the enemy, to the Gods below and to Mother Earth, that side shall
  have the victory." When the Consuls had told their dreams one to the other,
  they ordered that sacrifices should be offered to avert the wrath of the
  gods; and that if the soothsayers examining the entrails of the beasts should
  find the signs therein to agree with the dreams that they had dreamed, one or
  other of the Consuls should fulfil the decree of fate. So they sacrificed the
  beasts, and hearing from the soothsayers that such signs had been found, they
  called the officers together and told them, how they agreed that if either
  side began to give way the consul then commanding should devote himself for
  the Roman people and for his country.</p>

  <p>On the morning of the day when the battle was fought (the place being near
  to Mount Vesuvius) the Consuls offered sacrifice each for himself. Then the
  soothsayer showed the Consul Decius how, the signs being in other respects
  altogether favorable, the head of the liver was wounded on that side that
  regarded himself. Manlius, on the other hand, found all things altogether
  favorable. Then said Decius, "It is well if the offering of my colleague has
  been accepted." After these things they marched forth to the battle, Manlius
  commanding the right wing and Decius the left.</p>

  <p>For a while both armies fought with equal courage and strength. Then the
  Roman spearmen, being the front rank, gave way before the Latins, and fell
  back upon the rank behind them. Thereupon Decius cried with a loud voice to
  Valerius, "Valerius, we have, need of the help of the Gods. Come therefore,
  and, as high priest of the Roman people, dictate to me the words in which I
  may devote myself for the legions." Then the high priest bade him put on the
  robe that is called Prætexta&mdash;that is to say, having a stripe of purple
  about it&mdash;and to cover his head, and, thrusting his hand under his gown
  up to his chin, to say after him these words: "O Janus, Jupiter, Father Mars,
  Quirinus, Bellona, Gods of the households, Gods of the land, Gods of the
  dwellings below, I beseech you that ye grant strength and victory to the
  Roman people, and send upon the enemies of the Roman people terror, and
  panic, and death. And now I devote myself, and with me the legions of our
  enemies, to the infernal Gods, on behalf of the commonwealth of Rome and the
  legions of the Roman people." Then girding himself after the manner of Gabii,
  and taking his sword, he leapt upon his horse and hastened into the midst of
  the enemy. To both armies he seemed to he more than man, being sent, as it
  were, from heaven, to avert the anger of the gods, to avert destruction from
  his countrymen, and to bring it upon his enemies; and the Latins were
  overwhelmed with terror, giving way before him wherever his horse carried
  him, and when at last he fell slain by a shower of javelins, flying from the
  place where he lay. As for the Romans, they fought with greater hope and
  courage, as knowing that they had been delivered from the anger of the
  gods.</p>

  <p>When the battle had now lasted many hours, and the Latins had no fresh
  soldiers to bring up, the consul Manlius cried to the veterans whom he had
  kept behind, kneeling on one knee, till they should be needed, "Rise, and
  deal with the enemy as men that are fresh to the battle should deal with the
  weary. Remember your wives and children; remember also your Consul that has
  died that ye may have victory." So the veterans rose and advanced, bringing
  up a fresh line against the enemy; nor could these withstand them, but turned
  and fled. Many were slain in the field, and many also in the camp, which was
  taken that same day. The day following the body of Decius was found, covered
  with javelins, with many dead corpses of the enemy about it; and the consul
  Manlius made for this a great funeral.</p>

  <p>In the forty-second year after these things, Publius Decius Mus, being son
  to that Decius who devoted himself for the army in the battle of Mount
  Vesuvius, was made consul together with Quintus Fabius, having been consul
  three times before. In that year the Gauls had leagued together with the
  Etrurians against the Romans, having also upon their side the Umbrians and
  the Samnites. And the armies pitched their camp near to Sentinum, having a
  space of about four miles between them. Now it had been agreed among the
  enemy that on the day of battle the Gauls with the Samnites should fight with
  the army, and that the Etrurians with the men of Umbria should attack the
  camp. But this counsel certain deserters from Clusium declared to the
  Consuls. Thereupon the Consuls sent word by letter to their lieutenants that
  they should lay waste the country of the Etrurians. And this they did,
  working such destruction that the Etrurians with the men of Umbria
  straightway departed, that they might defend their own possessions. Then the
  Consuls made haste that they might fight before these should come back. For
  two days, therefore, they challenged the enemy to battle; but though a few
  were killed on either side, nothing worthy of note was done. But on the third
  day both the armies came down into the plain ready to do battle, and, while
  they stood, a hind that fled from a wolf ran down from the mountains across
  the plain that lay between the two hosts, and the two beasts went different
  ways, the hind among the Gauls and the wolf among the Romans. The hind,
  indeed, the Gauls slew, but the Romans gave place to the wolf to pass through
  their lines. Then a soldier that stood in the front rank cried aloud, "Look
  ye, flight and slaughter go that way where ye see the hind, a beast that is
  sacred to the goddess Diana, lie dead; but to us the wolf of Mars, whom we
  have left unharmed, is a pledge of victory, reminding us of him of whose race
  we come."</p>

  <p>On the right wing of the enemy were the Gauls and on the left the
  Samnites, Quintus Fabius being set to fight against these, and Decius Mus
  against the Gauls. At the first when the battle was begun the strength on
  either side was so equal that, if only the Etrurians or the men of Umbria had
  been there, the Romans had doubtless suffered some great loss either in the
  field or in the camp. Nevertheless the fashion of the battle was not the same
  in both wings. For Fabius and his legions defended themselves rather than
  attacked; Fabius judging that the Gauls and Samnites were most to be feared
  at their first charge, and that if only this could be sustained the day would
  go well with the Romans; the Samnites growing slack in valor, and the Gauls
  being unaccustomed to endure toil and heat for a long space of time, so that
  at the first they would fight with more than the strength of men, and at the
  last with less than the strength of women. Wherefore he kept the best
  strength of his soldiers till such time as the enemy were accustomed to be
  worsted. But Decius, being vigorous in body and of a high spirit, used his
  whole strength to the utmost in the very beginning of the battle. And because
  the foot soldiers seemed to him to fight with a certain slackness, he brought
  up the horsemen to their help. Then riding into the midst of one of the
  squadrons in which were many youths of noble birth, he cried to them, saying,
  "Follow me against the enemy. Ye shall win for yourselves a double share of
  glory if the victory shall be first won on this side." Twice did they put to
  flight the horsemen of the Gauls; but when they charged now for a third time,
  riding far on among the enemy, they were thrown into confusion by a certain
  new and strange manner of fighting. For suddenly there came upon them a
  number of the enemy that stood upon chariots, and who, advancing against them
  with a great noise both of horses' hoofs and of wheels, affrighted their
  horses. Thus there came a sudden panic upon them in the very hour of their
  victory, and turning their backs they fled headlong. Then the legions also
  were disordered, many that stood in the front rank being cast to the ground
  and crushed, both by their horsemen and by the chariots of the enemy. And
  when the Gauls saw how the Romans gave way they pressed on, giving them no
  breathing space nor time of recovery. Then cried the Consul Decius, "Whither
  do ye fly? what hope have ye in flight?" And he strove to stay them as they
  fled, and call them back into the battle. But when he saw that he could avail
  nothing, so overwhelmed were they with fear, he called aloud on the name of
  Publius Decius, his father, and said, "Why do I delay any longer the fate
  that belongs to my race? This is the privilege of my house, to be victims
  whereby the dangers of the commonwealth may be expiated. Therefore I give
  myself, and together with me the army of the enemy, to Mother Earth, and to
  the Gods of the dead." When he had so spoken, he bade Marcus Livius, the high
  priest (on whom, when he went into the battle, he had laid his commands that
  he should never depart from his side), dictate the words by which he might
  devote himself and the army of the enemy for the army of the Roman people.
  Then he arrayed himself in the same manner and prayed the same words as his
  father had done in the battle by Mount Vesuvius. To this he added these
  words, "Lo! I carry before me terror and flight, slaughter and blood, and the
  wrath of the Gods of heaven and of hell; with the curses of death will I
  smite the standards, weapons, and armor of the enemy, accomplishing in one
  and the same place my own destruction and the destruction of the Gauls and of
  the Samnites." And when he had thus cursed both himself and the enemy he
  spurred his horse into the lines of the Gauls, where he saw them to be
  thickest, and so fell pierced through with many spears.</p>

  <p>After the death of Decius the Romans fought with such strength and courage
  as seemed beyond the nature of men. For the Romans, when their leader was
  dead (a thing that commonly is wont to be the cause of much fear), stayed
  from their flight and took heart to begin the battle afresh. But as for the
  Gauls, and those especially that stood about the dead body of the Consul,
  they cast their javelins at random and to no purpose, as though they were
  beside themselves; and some were so stupefied with fear that they could
  neither fight nor fly. Then Livius the high priest, to whom the Consul Decius
  had given over his lictors, bidding him take upon himself the command, cried
  aloud, "The Romans have conquered, being delivered from peril by the death of
  the Consul. The Gauls and the Samnites are the possession of Mother Earth and
  of the Gods of the dead. Decius is calling and drawing to him the army that
  he devoted to death together with himself; and the whole host of the enemy is
  full of madness and fear." And while he set the battle in order again on this
  side of the field there came up two lieutenants whom Fabius the Consul had
  sent from the rearward to the help of his colleague. And when they heard that
  Decius was dead, and in what manner, they all addressed themselves to the
  battle with fresh courage. So when the Gauls stood in close array, with their
  shields set up before them, and it seemed no easy thing to come to close
  combat with them, the lieutenants commanded that they should gather together
  the javelins which lay on the ground in the space between the two armies, and
  cast them against the shields of the enemy. And when most of these pierced
  their shelter, and some that had the longer points were even driven into
  their bodies, the army was overthrown, not a few falling to the ground,
  though their bodies were unhurt. Such changes of fortune were there in the
  left wing of the Romans.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in the right wing, when Fabius perceived that the enemy shouted
  not as loudly as before, nor cast their javelins with as much strength, he
  commanded the captains of the horsemen to take a compass with their squadrons
  and fall upon the Samnites in the rear when he should give the signal. This
  done he bade the legions advance their standards. And when he saw that the
  enemy were beyond all doubt wearied with fighting, he called to him all the
  reserves that he had kept back for this end, and gave the signal, so that the
  legions fell upon the enemy from before and the horsemen fell upon them from
  behind at one and the same time. Thereupon the Samnites turned their backs
  and fled with all speed to their camp; but the Gauls, locking their shields
  in close array, stood fast. And now there came tidings to Fabius how that his
  colleague was dead; and when he heard them he bade the Companion Knights,
  being a company of about five hundred horsemen, leave the line and fall upon
  the Gauls in the rear; with whom went also a part of the third legion, to
  fall upon the enemy wherever their line should be broken by the horsemen. And
  he himself, having first vowed a temple and all the spoils of victory to
  Jupiter the Conqueror, marched to the camp of the Samnites. Then again was
  there a battle, for the multitude of them that fled was so great that they
  could not enter by the gates, so that they fought perforce. Then Egnatius,
  captain of the host of the Samnites, was slain. And in no great space of time
  the Samnites were driven within the ramparts and the camp also was taken. The
  Gauls also, being surrounded on all sides, could withstand the Romans no
  more. That day there fell five and twenty thousand of the enemy, and eight
  thousand were taken alive. Nor did the Romans escape without damage, for in
  the army of Decius were slain seven thousand and in the army of Fabius one
  thousand seven hundred. Fabius, having first sent men to search for the body
  of his colleague, gathered together in a great heap all the spoils of the
  enemy, and offered them for a burnt offering to Jupiter the Conqueror. On the
  morrow they found the body of Decius, covered with dead bodies of the Gauls,
  and brought it back to the camp amid much weeping of the soldiers. And Fabius
  made for him as great a funeral as he could prepare.</p>

  <h2><a name="chap17"
     id="chap17">THE STORY OF THE PASSES OF CAUDIUM</a></h2>

  <p>IN the four hundred and thirty-third year after the building of the city
  there was war between the Romans and the Samnites. Now there is in the land
  of the Samnites a certain pass which men call the Pass of Caudium. Near to
  this the captain of the host of the Samnites, a man very skillful in war,
  Caius Pontius by name, pitched his camp, hiding it from sight as much as it
  might be. This done he sent twelve soldiers, clad as shepherds, to Calatia,
  in which place he knew the Consuls to be with the army of the Romans. He
  commanded these men that they should feed their flocks not far from the camp
  of the Romans, one in one place and another in another, and that when the
  plunderers should fall upon them and take them they should tell all of them
  the same tale, that the legions of the Samnites were in Apulia, laying siege
  to the town of Luceria with all their might, and were on the point to take
  it. Now this same report had been spread abroad before of set purpose, and
  had come to the ears of the Romans; and now when these prisoners said the
  same words, agreeing all of them one with another, the Romans must needs
  believe it to be true. Now that the Romans would help the men of Luceria was
  manifest, because they were good allies and faithful, and because also, if it
  should be taken, all Apulia would fall away from them from present fear of
  the enemy. But by which way they would go men doubted much; for there were
  two ways, the one broad and easy, along the coast of the Upper Sea; but this
  way, as it was safe, so also was long. The other way, and this the shorter by
  far, lay through the Passes of Caudium. Now the nature of these passes is
  this. There are two deep glens, narrow and grown with woods, having mountains
  on either side of them; and between these there is a plain, of no small
  extent, grassy and well watered, and the road passes through the midst of it.
  But before a man can come to this plain he must needs go through the first
  pass; and when he would leave, if he will not return by the way by which he
  came, he must needs go through the second, and this is yet more narrow and
  difficult than the first. Into this plain, therefore, the Romans marched with
  their whole army through a cleft in the rocks&mdash;that is to say, through
  the first pass; but when they came to the second, they found it shut with the
  trunks of trees and great stones. And now the stratagem of the enemy became
  manifest, and at the same time also there was seen on the mountains above
  them a great army of the Samnites. And when they went back in all haste to
  the pass by which they had entered, they found this also shut by a fence of
  the like sort, kept by armed men. Thereupon they halted, though no man had
  given the word, for they were utterly confounded, neither was there any
  strength left in their limbs; and they stood speechless, looking upon each
  other as men that sought for help. Nevertheless, the tents of the Consuls
  were set up, and the tools for fortifying the camp got ready, though it
  seemed an idle thing for men that were in such plight to fortify a camp; but
  because they would not make their trouble worse by neglect they addressed
  themselves to work, and, without bidding or command from any man, fortified a
  camp; but not the less they knew their labor to be in vain; nor did the enemy
  cease to mock at them. This being done, the lieutenants and the tribunes came
  together without any bidding, for the Consuls called no council, as knowing
  that there was no device or knowledge that could avail them. The soldiers
  also ran together to the Consuls' tent, asking from their leaders such help
  as the gods themselves could scarce have given. And while they doubted what
  might be done darkness came upon them. Some said, "Let us make our way
  through these things that bar the way," and others, "Why should mountains and
  wood hinder us while we have swords in our hands? Suffer us only to come at
  the enemy, whom we have conquered now for thirty years; there is no place
  whereon the Romans cannot prevail over the Samnites, how many soever they may
  be." But others said, "Whither shall we go? and by what way? Shall we move
  these mountains from their place? for while they yet hang over us how can we
  come at our enemies? Truly we are given into their hands bound hand and foot,
  and they will conquer us without so much as moving from their place." Thus
  did they talk one to the other; and that night they thought neither of food
  nor of sleep.</p>

  <p>The Samnites also doubted much what they should best do now that their
  counsels had so greatly prospered. With one consent, therefore, they wrote
  letters to Herennius Pontius, father to Pontius their general, seeking for
  his advice. Now Pontius was a very old man, and had long since withdrawn
  himself not from war only, but also from all affairs of state. Nevertheless,
  though his body was weak, the power of his mind was not abated. When he heard
  that the Roman army had been shut in between the Passes of Caudium, and that
  his son would fain have his counsel, he said, "Let the men go, and harm them
  not." And when, despising this counsel, they sent the messenger again, asking
  the same question, he answered. "Slay them all; spare not one." When they
  heard these two answers, being so different the one from the other, it seemed
  to Pontius that his father's mind had failed him, even as his body had failed
  him. Nevertheless, when all would have it that the old man himself should be
  sent for, he yielded to their desire. And Pontius the elder agreeing was
  carried to the camp, they say, in a wagon; and when he was come they brought
  him into the council. There he spoke, changing indeed nothing of that which
  he had said, but adding his reasons. "My first counsel I yet judge to be the
  best, for thus by a great benefit ye will make peace and friendship for ever
  with a very powerful nation. If ye follow my second counsel ye will put off
  War with Rome for many generations; since, losing two great armies, they will
  not readily recover their strength. But counsel other than these two there is
  none." And when his son and others of the captains asked him whether there
  were not some middle way, so that the prisoners should be sent away unhurt
  but with conditions according to the right of the war, "That," said he, is a
  counsel which will neither get friends for you nor rid you of enemies. For
  think who they are that ye will provoke by such disgrace. The Romans cannot
  endure to sit quiet under defeat, nor will they rest till they have got
  manifold vengeance for that which present necessity shall have compelled them
  to suffer." Then, the Samnites not approving either counsel, Pontius departed
  to his home.</p>

  <p>And now the Romans, having sought many times in vain to break forth, and
  being now destitute of everything, sent ambassadors to the Samnites to seek
  peace, and, if peace were not given, to challenge the enemy to battle. To
  these Pontius made answer, "Since ye will not confess your plight, prisoners
  though ye be, I will send you under the yoke without arms, each having one
  garment only. As to the conditions of peace, they shall be equal and right.
  Ye shall depart from the land of the Samnites, and take away your colonies;
  and hereafter both Romans and Samnites shall live under their own laws. If
  these conditions please the Consuls I will make a treaty with them; if they
  please them not, return not hither again." When this message was brought back
  there arose a general lamentation; for it seemed better to die than to suffer
  such disgrace. And when the Consuls knew not what to say, Lucius Lentulus,
  being first of the lieutenants, both in respect of valor and of the honors
  which he had received, then spake: "Consuls, I have often heard from my
  father that he only gave counsel to the Senate that they should not ransom
  their country for gold, and that he did this because the Gauls had not
  enclosed the capital, and that therefore they might sally forth, not indeed
  without danger, yet without certainty of destruction. I also would give like
  advice this day if we could come near our enemies to fight with them. But
  seeing this may not be, and that if this army be destroyed, Rome is destroyed
  with it (for how can an unarmed multitude defend it?) my counsel is that we
  accept these conditions. So shall we deliver our country, not indeed by our
  death, yet by our disgrace."</p>

  <p>Thereupon the Consuls going to Pontius made with him, not indeed a treaty,
  for such could not be made without the consent of the people and the ministry
  of the heralds, but a covenant, for which the Consuls, lieutenants, quæstors,
  and tribunes were made sureties. And because peace could not be confirmed
  forthwith it was agreed that six hundred horsemen should be given as
  hostages, who should suffer death if the covenant should not be fulfilled.
  But when the Consuls came back to the camp the grief in the camp broke out
  afresh, and the soldiers could scarcely be kept from doing them violence.
  "Your rashness," they cried, "brought us into this place, and through your
  cowardice we come out of it with disgrace. No guide had ye, nor sent scouts
  to explore, but went blindly, even as beasts fall into a pit. As for us, we
  have been overcome and yet have not suffered a wound or struck a blow." While
  they thus murmured the time came when they must endure this great disgrace.
  First they were bidden to come without the rampart, having no arms and one
  garment only for each man. Afterward the hostages were given up and led away
  to prison. Then the lictors were commanded to leave the Consuls; and these
  had their soldiers' cloaks taken from them, so that they who had just cursed
  them, crying out that they should be delivered to the torturers, now pitied
  them, turning their eyes away, and thinking not of their own condition for
  shame that the majesty of so high an office should be brought so low. First
  the Consuls were sent under the yoke, half naked, and after them the other
  officers, according to their rank, and lastly the soldiers according to their
  legions. The enemy stood about, mocking and reviling them; some they
  threatened with their swords, and others that seemed to bear themselves too
  proudly they wounded and even slew.</p>

  <p>Then, going on their way, the Romans came near to Capua, but for shame and
  for fear lest their allies should desert them, entered not the city, but cast
  themselves down upon the road. But the men of Capua had compassion on them,
  and sent to them all that they needed, and entertained them both publicly and
  privately with all hospitality. But the Romans answered not a word, nor so
  much as lifted up their eyes, so overwhelmed were they with shame and grief.
  The next day certain young noblemen of Capua, going with them to the borders
  of their country, made this answer to some that questioned them in the Senate
  concerning the behavior of the Romans: "These men are wholly sunk in grief
  and despair, and have lost not their arms only but also their courage. Verily
  they seem to have yet on their necks the yoke under which they were made to
  pass; and as for the Samnites, they have won a victory to which there will be
  no end. The Gauls took the city of Rome, but these men have taken the very
  courage of the Roman people." Then said a certain Calavius, a man of renown
  and venerable for his age, "This silence, this shame, this refusing of all
  comfort are signs of a wrath that is both great and deep. If I know aught of
  the Roman people from this silence will come loud lamentation to the
  Samnites."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile these ill tidings had been carried to Rome. First they heard
  that the army was besieged; after that there had been made this shameful
  peace. Thereupon the soldiers, whom the magistrates had begun to levy on news
  of the siege, were dismissed, and a public mourning made by common consent.
  The shops were shut round the market-place, and also the courts of the
  judges; and the magistrates laid aside their ornaments and gold rings. At the
  first there was great wrath, not against the generals alone, but also against
  the soldiers, whom they counted unworthy to be admitted into the city; but
  when the army came in pitiable plight wrath was changed to compassion.</p>

  <p>So soon as the Consuls of the next year were appointed they called the
  Senate to consider what should be done concerning the peace of Caudium. And
  first they bade Postumius, that was one of the Consuls, speak his mind. Then
  said Postumius (and as he spake he bare the same look that he had borne under
  the yoke), "I hold that by this peace the Roman people is not bound, seeing
  that it was made without their authority, but only they that made themselves
  surety for it. Let us therefore be delivered up to the Samnites naked and in
  chains by the heralds; so shall we set free the people if they be in any wise
  bound. I hold also that the Consuls should forthwith levy an army and march
  forth therewith, but that they should not cross the border of the enemy till
  all these things be duly finished. And I pray to the Gods of heaven that they
  be satisfied with our disgrace, and that they prosper the arms of Rome even
  as they have prospered them in time past."</p>

  <p>To these words two tribunes of the Commons, having been among the
  sureties, made objection, saying, "Ye cannot set the Roman people free by
  giving up the sureties, but only by restoring all things as they were at
  Caudium. Neither do we deserve punishment because we saved the army; and
  seeing that we are sacred we may not be surrendered to the enemy."</p>

  <p>To this Postumius made answer, "If this be so, men of Rome, give up us
  that are common persons; and as for these sacred tribunes, touch them not
  till their time of office be ended. Only, if ye will listen to me, afterward,
  before ye give them up, beat them with rods in the market-place, and so take
  usury for the delay of payment. That the Roman people are bound by this peace
  I deny. Think ye that they had been bound if we had promised to surrender
  their city their temples, their land, their rivers, so that all that now
  belongs to the Romans should belong to the Samnites? And if ye ask me why I
  made such a peace having no authority, I answer this only. Nothing at Caudium
  was done wisely, but all things foolishly. The Gods smote not us only, but
  also the enemy with madness. We went blindly into the peril, and they cast
  away the victory which they had won. For why did they not send ambassadors to
  Rome, seeing that it was but a three days' journey, that peace might be made
  in due form? Surely neither Fathers nor Commons are bound to that in which
  they had no part. We that were sureties are bound, and we will give ourselves
  up that they may work their will on us."</p>

  <p>Even the tribunes of the Commons were persuaded by these words, so that
  they abdicated their office, and were given to the heralds to be led to
  Caudium together with the consuls and the other sureties. Thereupon the
  heralds, going before, when they came to the gate, commanded that their
  garments should be stripped from them that had been sureties for the peace;
  and that their hands should be bound behind their backs. And when the lictor,
  for reverence' sake, would have tied the cord loosely about the hands of
  Postumius, Postumius said, "Nay, but bind tight the cord that the matter may
  be done rightly." Afterward, when they were come to the judgment-seat of
  Pontius, the herald thus spake: "Forasmuch as these men here present without
  bidding of the Roman people gave themselves as sureties that a treaty should
  be made, and so did great wrong, I now give up these men to you, that the
  Roman people may be set free from guiltiness in this matter." While the
  herald was thus speaking, Postumius with his knee smote him on the thigh with
  all his might, saying, with a loud voice, "I am a citizen of Samnium, and
  thou art an ambassador; I have smitten a herald contrary to the law of
  nations, so that ye will wage war not without good cause."</p>

  <p>Then said Pontius, "I accept not this surrender, neither I nor the
  Samnites. If thou believest, Postumius, that there are gods, why dost thou
  not either undo all that has been done or stand by thy covenant? But I ask
  not this of thee, I ask it of the Roman people. If this peace please them
  not, let them send back the legions to their place. Let all that hath been
  done be undone. They shall have the arms which they gave up. Then, if ye
  will, refuse this peace. Will ye never lack a cause for going back from your
  word? Ye gave hostages to Porsenna and got them back by stealth. Ye ransomed
  your State from the Gauls for gold, and slew them even while ye paid it. Ye
  made peace with us that ye might get back your legions that were taken, and
  now ye would disannul it. Is this the law of nations, thou herald, as thou
  takest it to be? As for these men, I accept them not. They may go back to
  their own country and carry with them the wrath of the Gods whom they have
  despised. Ye will wage war forsooth with us because Postumius hath struck the
  herald with his knee. Ye will persuade the Gods that he is not a Roman but a
  Samnite, and that therefore ye have just cause of war against us. Shame that
  old men that have borne office should not be ashamed to work such mockeries
  in the light of day, excusing themselves for their falsehood by such tricks
  as verily children would count to be unworthy of them. Go, lictor, loosen the
  bonds of the Romans; let no one hinder them from going whither they will." So
  the Romans, having acquitted certainly their own faith, and it may be the
  faith of the State, departed to their own homes.</p>
