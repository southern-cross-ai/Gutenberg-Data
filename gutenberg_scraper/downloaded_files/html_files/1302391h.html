<h2><a name="note" id="note">NOTE</a></h2>

<p class="first">IN this story Abraham Merritt has one of the
protagonists&mdash;the Norwegian Olaf Huldricksson&mdash;use
several words and phrases in his native language. However, with
few exceptions, the expressions which Merritt employs are not
Norwegian but Danish. For the sake of linguistic authenticity, I
have, where appropriate, replaced the Danish terms with their
Norwegian equivalents, located with the help of Heinzelnisse's
<i>Norwegian-German-Norwegian Dictionary</i> and the <i>NO
English-Danish-English Dictionary</i>. I have included
translations and the Danish terms used by Merritt in tool-tip
notes. Huldricksson's dying words, oddly enough, are German.
These I have left unchanged. &mdash;Roy Glashan</p>

<h2><a name="foreword" id="foreword">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE publication of the following narrative of
Dr. Walter T. Goodwin has been authorized by the Executive
Council of the International Association of Science.</p>

<h3>First:</h3>

<p class="first">To end officially what is beginning to be called
the Throckmartin Mystery and to kill the innuendo and scandalous
suspicions which have threatened to stain the reputations of Dr.
David Throckmartin, his youthful wife, and equally youthful
associate Dr. Charles Stanton ever since a tardy despatch from
Melbourne, Australia, reported the disappearance of the first
from a ship sailing to that port, and the subsequent reports of
the disappearance of his wife and associate from the camp of
their expedition in the Caroline Islands.</p>

<h3>Second:</h3>

<p class="first">Because the Executive Council have concluded
that Dr. Goodwin's experiences in his wholly heroic effort to
save the three, and the lessons and warnings within those
experiences, are too important to humanity as a whole to be
hidden away in scientific papers understandable only to the
technically educated; or to be presented through the newspaper
press in the abridged and fragmentary form which the space
limitations of that vehicle make necessary.</p>

<p class="first">For these reasons the Executive Council
commissioned Mr. A. Merritt to transcribe into a form to be
readily understood by the layman the stenographic notes of Dr.
Goodwin's own report to the Council, supplemented by further oral
reminiscences and comments by Dr. Goodwin; this transcription,
edited and censored by the Executive Council of the Association,
forms the contents of this book.</p>

<p class="first">Himself a member of the Council, Dr. Walter T.
Goodwin, Ph.D., F.R.G.S. etc., is without cavil the foremost of
American botanists, an observer of international reputation and
the author of several epochal treaties upon his chosen branch of
science. His story, amazing in the best sense of that word as it
may be, is fully supported by proofs brought forward by him and
accepted by the organization of which I have the honor to be
president. What matter has been elided from this popular
presentation&mdash; because of the excessively menacing
potentialities it contains, which unrestricted dissemination
might develop&mdash;will be dealt with in purely scientific
pamphlets of carefully guarded circulation.</p>

<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1"></a>1. &mdash; THE THING ON THE
MOON PATH</h2>

<p class="first">FOR two months I had been on the d'Entrecasteaux
Islands gathering data for the concluding chapters of my book
upon the flora of the volcanic islands of the South Pacific. The
day before I had reached Port Moresby and had seen my specimens
safely stored on board the Southern Queen. As I sat on the upper
deck I thought, with homesick mind, of the long leagues between
me and Melbourne, and the longer ones between Melbourne and New
York.</p>

<p>It was one of Papua's yellow mornings when she shows herself
in her sombrest, most baleful mood. The sky was smouldering
ocher. Over the island brooded a spirit sullen, alien,
implacable, filled with the threat of latent, malefic forces
waiting to be unleashed. It seemed an emanation out of the
untamed, sinister heart of Papua herself&mdash;sinister even when
she smiles. And now and then, on the wind, came a breath from
virgin jungles, laden with unfamiliar odors, mysterious and
menacing.</p>

<p>It is on such mornings that Papua whispers to you of her
immemorial ancientness and of her power. And, as every white man
must, I fought against her spell. While I struggled I saw a tall
figure striding down the pier; a Kapa-Kapa boy followed swinging
a new valise. There was something familiar about the tall man. As
he reached the gangplank he looked up straight into my eyes,
stared for a moment, then waved his hand.</p>

<p>And now I knew him. It was Dr. David
Throckmartin&mdash;"Throck" he was to me always, one of my oldest
friends and, as well, a mind of the first water whose power and
achievements were for me a constant inspiration as they were, I
know, for scores other.</p>

<p>Coincidentally with my recognition came a shock of surprise,
definitely &mdash;unpleasant. It was Throckmartin&mdash;but about
him was something disturbingly unlike the man I had known long so
well and to whom and to whose little party I had bidden farewell
less than a month before I myself had sailed for these seas. He
had married only a few weeks before, Edith, the daughter of
Professor William Frazier, younger by at least a decade than he
but at one with him in his ideals and as much in love, if it were
possible, as Throckmartin. By virtue of her father's training a
wonderful assistant, by virtue of her own sweet, sound heart
a&mdash;I use the word in its olden sense&mdash;lover. With his
equally youthful associate Dr. Charles Stanton and a Swedish
woman, Thora Halversen, who had been Edith Throckmartin's nurse
from babyhood, they had set forth for the Nan-Matal, that
extraordinary group of island ruins clustered along the eastern
shore of Ponape in the Carolines.</p>

<p>I knew that he had planned to spend at least a year among
these ruins, not only of Ponape but of Lele&mdash;twin centers of
a colossal riddle of humanity, a weird flower of civilization
that blossomed ages before the seeds of Egypt were sown; of whose
arts we know little enough and of whose science nothing. He had
carried with him unusually complete equipment for the work he had
expected to do and which, he hoped, would be his monument.</p>

<p>What then had brought Throckmartin to Port Moresby, and what
was that change I had sensed in him?</p>

<p>Hurrying down to the lower deck I found him with the purser.
As I spoke he turned, thrust out to me an eager hand&mdash;and
then I saw what was that difference that had so moved me. He
knew, of course by my silence and involuntary shrinking the shock
my closer look had given me. His eyes filled; he turned brusquely
from the purser, hesitated&mdash;then hurried off to his
stateroom.</p>

<p>"'E looks rather queer&mdash;eh?" said the purser. "Know 'im
well, sir? Seems to 'ave given you quite a start."</p>

<p>I made some reply and went slowly up to my chair. There I sat,
composed my mind and tried to define what it was that had shaken
me so. Now it came to me. The old Throckmartin was on the eve of
his venture just turned forty, lithe, erect, muscular; his
controlling expression one of enthusiasm, of intellectual
keenness, of&mdash;what shall I say&mdash;expectant search. His
always questioning brain had stamped its vigor upon his face.</p>

<p>But the Throckmartin I had seen below was one who had borne
some scaring shock of mingled rapture and horror; some soul
cataclysm that in its climax had remoulded, deep from within, his
face, setting on it seal of wedded ecstasy and despair; as though
indeed these two had come to him hand in hand, taken possession
of him and departing left behind, ineradicably, their linked
shadows!</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;it was that which appalled. For how could rapture
and horror, Heaven and Hell mix, clasp hands&mdash;kiss?</p>

<p>Yet these were what in closest embrace lay on Throckmartin's
face!</p>

<p>Deep in thought, subconsciously with relief, I watched the
shore line sink behind; welcomed the touch of the wind of the
free seas. I had hoped, and within the hope was an inexplicable
shrinking that I would meet Throckmartin at lunch. He did not
come down, and I was sensible of deliverance within my
disappointment. All that afternoon I lounged about uneasily but
still he kept to his cabin&mdash;and within me was no strength to
summon him. Nor did he appear at dinner.</p>

<p>Dusk and night fell swiftly. I was warm and went back to my
deck-chair. The Southern Queen was rolling to a disquieting swell
and I had the place to myself.</p>

<p>Over the heavens was a canopy of cloud, glowing faintly and
testifying to the moon riding behind it. There was much
phosphorescence. Fitfully before the ship and at her sides arose
those stranger little swirls of mist that swirl up from the
Southern Ocean like breath of sea monsters, whirl for an instant
and disappear.</p>

<p>Suddenly the deck door opened and through it came
Throckmartin. He paused uncertainly, looked up at the sky with a
curiously eager, intent gaze, hesitated, then closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"Throck," I called. "Come! It's Goodwin."</p>

<p>He made his way to me.</p>

<p>"Throck," I said, wasting no time in preliminaries. "What's
wrong? Can I help you?"</p>

<p>I felt his body grow tense.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Melbourne, Goodwin," he answered. "I need a few
things &mdash;need them urgently. And more men&mdash;white
men&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly; rose from his chair, gazed intently
toward the north. I followed his gaze. Far, far away the moon had
broken through the clouds. Almost on the horizon, you could see
the faint luminescence of it upon the smooth sea. The distant
patch of light quivered and shook. The clouds thickened again and
it was gone. The ship raced on southward, swiftly.</p>

<p>Throckmartin dropped into his chair. He lighted a cigarette
with a hand that trembled; then turned to me with abrupt
resolution.</p>

<p>"Goodwin," he said. "I do need help. If ever man needed it, I
do. Goodwin &mdash;can you imagine yourself in another world,
alien, unfamiliar, a world of terror, whose unknown joy is its
greatest terror of all; you all alone there, a stranger! As such
a man would need help, so I need&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused abruptly and arose; the cigarette dropped from his
fingers. The moon had again broken through the clouds, and this
time much nearer. Not a mile away was the patch of light that it
threw upon the waves. Back of it, to the rim of the sea was a
lane of moonlight; a gigantic gleaming serpent racing over the
edge of the world straight and surely toward the ship.</p>

<p>Throckmartin stiffened to it as a pointer does to a hidden
covey. To me from him pulsed a thrill of horror&mdash;but horror
tinged with an unfamiliar, an infernal joy. It came to me and
passed away&mdash;leaving me trembling with its shock of bitter
sweet.</p>

<p>He bent forward, all his soul in his eyes. The moon path swept
closer, closer still. It was now less than half a mile away. From
it the ship fled &mdash;almost as though pursued. Down upon it,
swift and straight, a radiant torrent cleaving the waves, raced
the moon stream.</p>

<p>"Good God!" breathed Throckmartin, and if ever the words were
a prayer and an invocation they were.</p>

<p>And then, for the first time&mdash;I saw&mdash;<i>it</i>!</p>

<p>The moon path stretched to the horizon and was bordered by
darkness. It was as though the clouds above had been parted to
form a lane&mdash;drawn aside like curtains or as the waters of
the Red Sea were held back to let the hosts of Israel through. On
each side of the stream was the black shadow cast by the folds of
the high canopies And straight as a road between the opaque walls
gleamed, shimmered, and danced the shining, racing, rapids of the
moonlight.</p>

<p>Far, it seemed immeasurably far, along this stream of silver
fire I sensed, rather than saw, something coming. It drew first
into sight as a deeper glow within the light. On and on it swept
toward us&mdash;an opalescent mistiness that sped with the
suggestion of some winged creature in arrowed flight. Dimly there
crept into my mind memory of the <a title= "an indigenous people
of Borneo">Dyak</a> legend of the winged messenger of
Buddha&mdash;the Akla bird whose feathers are woven of the
moon-rays, whose heart is a living opal, whose wings in flight
echo the crystal clear music of the white stars&mdash;but whose
beak is of frozen flame and shreds the souls of unbelievers.</p>

<p>Closer it drew and now there came to me sweet, insistent
tinklings&mdash; like pizzicati on violins of glass; crystal
clear; diamonds melting into sounds!</p>

<p>Now the Thing was close to the end of the white path; close up
to the barrier of darkness still between the ship and the
sparkling head of the moon stream. Now it beat up against that
barrier as a bird against the bars of its cage. It whirled with
shimmering plumes, with swirls of lacy light, with spirals of
living vapor. It held within it odd, unfamiliar gleams as of
shifting mother-of-pearl. Coruscations and glittering atoms
drifted through it as though it drew them from the rays that
bathed it.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer it came, borne on the sparkling waves, and
ever thinner shrank the protecting wall of shadow between it and
us. Within the mistiness was a core, a nucleus of intenser
light&mdash;veined, opaline, effulgent, intensely alive. And
above it, tangled in the plumes and spirals that throbbed and
whirled were seven glowing lights.</p>

<p>Through all the incessant but strangely ordered movement of
the&mdash; <i>thing</i>&mdash;these lights held firm and steady.
They were seven &mdash;like seven little moons. One was of a
pearly pink, one of a delicate nacreous blue, one of lambent
saffron, one of the emerald you see in the shallow waters of
tropic isles; a deathly white; a ghostly amethyst; and one of the
silver that is seen only when the flying fish leap beneath the
moon.</p>

<p>The tinkling music was louder still. It pierced the ears with
a shower of tiny lances; it made the heart beat
jubilantly&mdash;and checked it dolorously. It closed the throat
with a throb of rapture and gripped it tight with the hand of
infinite sorrow!</p>

<p>Came to me now a murmuring cry, stilling the crystal notes. It
was articulate&mdash;but as though from something utterly foreign
to this world. The ear took the cry and translated with conscious
labor into the sounds of earth. And even as it compassed, the
brain shrank from it irresistibly, and simultaneously it seemed
reached toward it with irresistible eagerness.</p>

<p>Throckmartin strode toward the front of the deck, straight
toward the vision, now but a few yards away from the stern. His
face had lost all human semblance. Utter agony and utter
ecstasy&mdash;there they were side by side, not resisting each
other; unholy inhuman companions blending into a look that none
of God's creatures should wear&mdash;and deep, deep as his soul!
A devil and a God dwelling harmoniously side by side! So must
Satan, newly fallen, still divine, seeing heaven and
contemplating hell, have appeared.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;swiftly the moon path faded! The clouds swept
over the sky as though a hand had drawn them together. Up from
the south came a roaring squall. As the moon vanished what I had
seen vanished with it&mdash; blotted out as an image on a magic
lantern; the tinkling ceased abruptly &mdash;leaving a silence
like that which follows an abrupt thunder clap. There was nothing
about us but silence and blackness!</p>

<p>Through me passed a trembling as one who has stood on the very
verge of the gulf wherein the men of the Louisades says lurks the
fisher of the souls of men, and has been plucked back by sheerest
chance.</p>

<p>Throckmartin passed an arm around me.</p>

<p>"It is as I thought," he said. In his voice was a new note;
the calm certainty that has swept aside a waiting terror of the
unknown. "Now I know! Come with me to my cabin, old friend. For
now that you too have seen I can tell you"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"what it was you saw," he ended.</p>

<p>As we passed through the door we met the ship's first officer.
Throckmartin composed his face into at least a semblance of
normality.</p>

<p>"Going to have much of a storm?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the mate. "Probably all the way to Melbourne."</p>

<p>Throckmartin straightened as though with a new thought. He
gripped the officer's sleeve eagerly.</p>

<p>"You mean at least cloudy weather&mdash;for"&mdash;he
hesitated &mdash;"for the next three nights, say?"</p>

<p>"And for three more," replied the mate.</p>

<p>"Thank God!" cried Throckmartin, and I think I never heard
such relief and hope as was in his voice.</p>

<p>The sailor stood amazed. "Thank God?" he repeated.
"Thank&mdash;what d'ye mean?"</p>

<p>But Throckmartin was moving onward to his cabin. I started to
follow. The first officer stopped me.</p>

<p>"Your friend," he said, "is he ill?"</p>

<p>"The sea!" I answered hurriedly. "He's not used to it. I am
going to look after him."</p>

<p>Doubt and disbelief were plain in the seaman's eyes but I
hurried on. For I knew now that Throckmartin was ill
indeed&mdash;but with a sickness neither the ship's doctor nor
any other could heal.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2"></a>2. &mdash; "DEAD! ALL
DEAD!"</h2>

<p class="first">HE was sitting, face in hands, on the side of
his berth as I entered. He had taken off his coat.</p>

<p>"Throck," I cried. "What was it? What are you flying from,
man? Where is your wife&mdash;and Stanton?"</p>

<p>"Dead!" he replied monotonously. "Dead! All dead!" Then as I
recoiled from him&mdash;"All dead. Edith, Stanton,
Thora&mdash;dead&mdash;or worse. And Edith in the Moon
Pool&mdash;with them&mdash;drawn by what you saw on the moon
path&mdash;that has put its brand upon me&mdash;and follows
me!"</p>

<p>He ripped open his shirt.</p>

<p>"Look at this," he said. Around his chest, above his heart,
the skin was white as pearl. This whiteness was sharply defined
against the healthy tint of the body. It circled him with an even
cincture about two inches wide.</p>

<p>"Burn it!" he said, and offered me his cigarette. I drew back.
He gestured &mdash;peremptorily. I pressed the glowing end of the
cigarette into the ribbon of white flesh. He did not flinch nor
was there odor of burning nor, as I drew the little cylinder
away, any mark upon the whiteness.</p>

<p>"Feel it!" he commanded again. I placed my fingers upon the
band. It was cold&mdash;like frozen marble.</p>

<p>He drew his shirt around him.</p>

<p>"Two things you have seen," he said. "<i>It</i>&mdash;and its
mark. Seeing, you must believe my story. Goodwin, I tell you
again that my wife is dead&mdash;or worse&mdash;I do not know;
the prey of&mdash;what you saw; so, too, is Stanton; so Thora.
How&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tears rolled down the seared face.</p>

<p>"Why did God let it conquer us? Why did He let it take my
Edith?" he cried in utter bitterness. "Are there things stronger
than God, do you think, Walter?"</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"Are there? Are there?" His wild eyes searched me.</p>

<p>"I do not know just how you define God," I managed at last
through my astonishment to make answer. "If you mean the will to
know, working through science&mdash;"</p>

<p>He waved me aside impatiently.</p>

<p>"Science," he said. "What is our science against&mdash;that?
Or against the science of whatever devils that made it&mdash;or
made the way for it to enter this world of ours?"</p>

<p>With an effort he regained control.</p>

<p>"Goodwin," he said, "do you know at all of the ruins on the
Carolines; the cyclopean, megalithic cities and harbors of Ponape
and Lele, of Kusaie, of Truk and Hogolu, and a score of other
islets there? Particularly, do you know of the Nan-Matal and the
Metalanim?"</p>

<p>"Of the Metalanim I have heard and seen photographs," I said.
"They call it, don't they, the Lost Venice of the Pacific?"</p>

<p>"Look at this map," said Throckmartin. "That," he went on, "is
Christian's chart of Metalanim Harbor and the Nan-Matal. Do you
see the rectangles marked Nan-Tauach?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"There," he said, "under those walls is the Moon Pool and the
seven gleaming lights that raise the Dweller in the Pool, and the
altar and shrine of the Dweller. And there in the Moon Pool with
it lie Edith and Stanton and Thora."</p>

<p>"The Dweller in the Moon Pool?" I repeated
half-incredulously.</p>

<p>"The Thing you saw," said Throckmartin solemnly.</p>

<p>A solid sheet of rain swept the ports, and the Southern Queen
began to roll on the rising swells. Throckmartin drew another
deep breath of relief, and drawing aside a curtain peered out
into the night. Its blackness seemed to reassure him. At any
rate, when he sat again he was entirely calm.</p>

<p>"There are no more wonderful ruins in the world," he began
almost casually. "They take in some fifty islets and cover with
their intersecting canals and lagoons about twelve square miles.
Who built them? None knows. When were they built? Ages before the
memory of present man, that is sure. Ten thousand, twenty
thousand, a hundred thousand years ago&mdash;the last more
likely.</p>

<p>"All these islets, Walter, are squared, and their shores are
frowning seawalls of gigantic basalt blocks hewn and put in place
by the hands of ancient man. Each inner water-front is faced with
a terrace of those basalt blocks which stand out six feet above
the shallow canals that meander between them. On the islets
behind these walls are time-shattered fortresses, palaces,
terraces, pyramids; immense courtyards strewn with
ruins&mdash;and all so old that they seem to wither the eyes of
those who look on them.</p>

<p>"There has been a great subsidence. You can stand out of
Metalanim Harbor for three miles and look down upon the tops of
similar monolithic structures and walls twenty feet below you in
the water.</p>

<p>"And all about, strung on their canals, are the bulwarked
islets with their enigmatic walls peering through the dense
growths of mangroves&mdash; dead, deserted for incalculable ages;
shunned by those who live near.</p>

<p>"You as a botanist are familiar with the evidence that a vast
shadowy continent existed in the Pacific&mdash;a continent that
was not rent asunder by volcanic forces as was that legendary one
of Atlantis in the Eastern Ocean.* My work in Java, in Papua, and
in the Ladrones had set my mind upon this Pacific lost land. Just
as the Azores are believed to be the last high peaks of Atlantis,
so hints came to me steadily that Ponape and Lele and their
basalt bulwarked islets were the last points of the slowly sunken
western land clinging still to the sunlight, and had been the
last refuge and sacred places of the rulers of that race which
had lost their immemorial home under the rising waters of the
Pacific.</p>

<p>"I believed that under these ruins I might find the evidence
that I sought.</p>

<p>"My&mdash;my wife and I had talked before we were married of
making this our great work. After the honeymoon we prepared for
the expedition. Stanton was as enthusiastic as ourselves. We
sailed, as you know, last May for fulfillment of my dreams.</p>

<p>"At Ponape we selected, not without difficulty, workmen to
help us&mdash; diggers. I had to make extraordinary inducements
before I could get together my force. Their beliefs are gloomy,
these Ponapeans. They people their swamps, their forests, their
mountains, and shores, with malignant spirits&mdash;<i>ani</i> they
call them. And they are afraid&mdash;bitterly afraid of the isles
of ruins and what they think the ruins hide. I do not wonder
&mdash;now!</p>

<p>"When they were told where they were to go, and how long we
expected to stay, they murmured. Those who, at last, were tempted
made what I thought then merely a superstitious proviso that they
were to be allowed to go away on the three nights of the full
moon. Would to God we had heeded them and gone too!"</p>

<p>"We passed into Metalanim Harbor. Off to our left&mdash;a mile
away arose a massive quadrangle. Its walls were all of forty feet
high and hundreds of feet on each side. As we drew by, our
natives grew very silent; watched it furtively, fearfully. I knew
it for the ruins that are called Nan-Tauach, the 'place of
frowning walls.' And at the silence of my men I recalled what
Christian had written of this place; of how he had come upon its
'ancient platforms and tetragonal enclosures of stonework; its
wonder of tortuous alleyways and labyrinth of shallow canals;
grim masses of stonework peering out from behind verdant screens;
cyclopean barricades,' and of how, when he had turned 'into its
ghostly shadows, straight away the merriment of guides was hushed
and conversation died down to whispers.'"</p>

<p>He was silent for a little time.</p>

<p>"Of course I wanted to pitch our camp there," he went on again
quietly, "but I soon gave up that idea. The natives were
panic-stricken&mdash; threatened to turn back. 'No,' they said,
'too great <i>ani</i> there. We go to any other place&mdash;but
not there.'</p>

<p>"We finally picked for our base the islet called Uschen-Tau.
It was close to the isle of desire, but far enough away from it
to satisfy our men. There was an excellent camping-place and a
spring of fresh water. We pitched our tents, and in a couple of
days the work was in full swing."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3"></a>3. &mdash; THE MOON ROCK</h2>

<p class="first">"I DO not intend to tell you now," Throckmartin
continued, "the results of the next two weeks, nor of what we
found. Later&mdash;if I am allowed, I will lay all that before
you. It is sufficient to say that at the end of those two weeks I
had found confirmation for many of my theories.</p>

<p>"The place, for all its decay and desolation, had not infected
us with any touch of morbidity&mdash;that is not Edith, Stanton,
or myself. But Thora was very unhappy. She was a Swede, as you
know, and in her blood ran the beliefs and superstitions of the
Northland&mdash;some of them so strangely akin to those of this
far southern land; beliefs of spirits of mountain and forest and
water werewolves and beings malign. From the first she showed a
curious sensitivity to what, I suppose, may be called the
'influences' of the place. She said it 'smelled' of ghosts and
warlocks.</p>

<p>"I laughed at her then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Two weeks slipped by, and at their end the spokesman for our
natives came to us. The next night was the full of the moon, he
said. He reminded me of my promise. They would go back to their
village in the morning; they would return after the third night,
when the moon had begun to wane. They left us sundry charms for
our 'protection,' and solemnly cautioned us to keep as far away
as possible from Nan-Tauach during their absence.
Half-exasperated, half-amused I watched them go.</p>

<p>"No work could be done without them, of course, so we decided
to spend the days of their absence junketing about the southern
islets of the group. We marked down several spots for subsequent
exploration, and on the morning of the third day set forth along
the east face of the breakwater for our camp on Uschen-Tau,
planning to have everything in readiness for the return of our
men the next day.</p>

<p>"We landed just before dusk, tired and ready for our cots. It
was only a little after ten o'clock that Edith awakened me.</p>

<p>"'Listen!' she said. 'Lean over with your ear close to the
ground!'</p>

<p>"I did so, and seemed to hear, far, far below, as though
coming up from great distances, a faint chanting. It gathered
strength, died down, ended; began, gathered volume, faded away
into silence.</p>

<p>"'It's the waves rolling on rocks somewhere,' I said. 'We're
probably over some ledge of rock that carries the sound.'</p>

<p>"'It's the first time I've heard it,' replied my wife
doubtfully. We listened again. Then through the dim rhythms, deep
beneath us, another sound came. It drifted across the lagoon that
lay between us and Nan-Tauach in little tinkling waves. It was
music&mdash;of a sort; I won't describe the strange effect it had
upon me. You've felt it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean on the deck?" I asked. Throckmartin nodded.</p>

<p>"I went to the flap of the tent," he continued, "and peered
out. As I did so Stanton lifted his flap and walked out into the
moonlight, looking over to the other islet and listening. I
called to him.</p>

<p>"'That's the queerest sound!' he said. He listened again.
'Crystalline! Like little notes of translucent glass. Like the
bells of crystal on the sistrums of Isis at Dendarah Temple,' he
added half-dreamily. We gazed intently at the island. Suddenly,
on the sea-wall, moving slowly, rhythmically, we saw a little
group of lights. Stanton laughed.</p>

<p>"'The beggars!' he exclaimed. 'That's why they wanted to get
away, is it? Don't you see, Dave, it's some sort of a
festival&mdash;rites of some kind that they hold during the full
moon! That's why they were so eager to have us <i>keep</i> away,
too.'</p>

<p>"The explanation seemed good. I felt a curious sense of
relief, although I had not been sensible of any oppression.</p>

<p>"'Let's slip over,' suggested Stanton&mdash;but I would
not.</p>

<p>"'They're a difficult lot as it is,' I said. 'If we break into
one of their religious ceremonies they'll probably never forgive
us. Let's keep out of any family party where we haven't been
invited.'</p>

<p>"'That's so,' agreed Stanton.</p>

<p>"The strange tinkling rose and fell, rose and fell&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There's something&mdash;something very unsettling about it,'
said Edith at last soberly. 'I wonder what they make those sounds
with. They frighten me half to death, and, at the same time, they
make me feel as though some enormous rapture were just around the
corner.'</p>

<p>"'It's devilish uncanny!' broke in Stanton.</p>

<p>"And as he spoke the flap of Thora's tent was raised and out
into the moonlight strode the old Swede. She was the great Norse
type&mdash;tall, deep-breasted, moulded on the old Viking lines.
Her sixty years had slipped from her. She looked like some
ancient priestess of Odin.</p>

<p>"She stood there, her eyes wide, brilliant, staring. She
thrust her head forward toward Nan-Tauach, regarding the moving
lights; she listened. Suddenly she raised her arms and made a
curious gesture to the moon. It was &mdash;an
archaic&mdash;movement; she seemed to drag it from remote
antiquity&mdash;yet in it was a strange suggestion of power,
Twice she repeated this gesture and&mdash;the tinklings died
away! She turned to us.</p>

<p>"'Go!' she said, and her voice seemed to come from far
distances. 'Go from here&mdash;and quickly! Go while you may. It
has called&mdash;' She pointed to the islet. 'It knows you are
here. It waits!' she wailed. 'It
beckons&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She fell at Edith's feet, and over the lagoon came again the
tinklings, now with a quicker note of jubilance&mdash;almost of
triumph.</p>

<p>"We watched beside her throughout the night. The sounds from
Nan-Tauach continued until about an hour before moon-set. In the
morning Thora awoke, none the worse, apparently. She had had bad
dreams, she said. She could not remember what they
were&mdash;except that they had warned her of danger. She was
oddly sullen, and throughout the morning her gaze returned again
and again half-fascinatedly, half-wonderingly to the neighboring
isle.</p>

<p>"That afternoon the natives returned. And that night on
Nan-Tauach the silence was unbroken nor were there lights nor
sign of life.</p>

<p>"You will understand, Goodwin, how the occurrences I have
related would excite the scientific curiosity. We rejected
immediately, of course, any explanation admitting the
supernatural.</p>

<p>"Our&mdash;symptoms let me call them&mdash;could all very
easily be accounted for. It is unquestionable that the vibrations
created by certain musical instruments have definite and
sometimes extraordinary effect upon the nervous system. We
accepted this as the explanation of the reactions we had
experienced, hearing the unfamiliar sounds. Thora's nervousness,
her superstitious apprehensions, had wrought her up to a
condition of semi-somnambulistic hysteria. Science could readily
explain her part in the night's scene.</p>

<p>"We came to the conclusion that there must be a passage-way
between Ponape and Nan-Tauach known to the natives&mdash;and used
by them during their rites. We decided that on the next departure
of our laborers we would set forth immediately to Nan-Tauach. We
would investigate during the day, and at evening my wife and
Thora would go back to camp, leaving Stanton and me to spend the
night on the island, observing from some safe hiding-place what
might occur.</p>

<p>"The moon waned; appeared crescent in the west; waxed slowly
toward the full. Before the men left us they literally prayed us
to accompany them. Their importunities only made us more eager to
see what it was that, we were now convinced, they wanted to
conceal from us. At least that was true of Stanton and myself. It
was not true of Edith. She was thoughtful, abstracted
&mdash;reluctant.</p>

<p>"When the men were out of sight around the turn of the harbor,
we took our boat and made straight for Nan-Tauach. Soon its
mighty sea-wall towered above us. We passed through the water-gate
with its gigantic hewn prisms of basalt and landed beside a
half-submerged pier. In front of us stretched a series of giant
steps leading into a vast court strewn with fragments of fallen
pillars. In the center of the court, beyond the shattered
pillars, rose another terrace of basalt blocks, concealing, I
knew, still another enclosure.</p>

<p>"And now, Walter, for the better understanding of what
follows&mdash;and &mdash;and&mdash;" he hesitated. "Should you
decide later to return with me or, if I am taken,
to&mdash;to&mdash;follow us&mdash;listen carefully to my
description of this place: Nan-Tauach is literally three
rectangles. The first rectangle is the sea-wall, built up of
monoliths&mdash;hewn and squared, twenty feet wide at the top. To
get to the gateway in the sea-wall you pass along the canal
marked on the map between Nan-Tauach and the islet named Tau. The
entrance to the canal is hidden by dense thickets of mangroves;
once through these the way is clear. The steps lead up from the
landing of the sea-gate through the entrance to the
courtyard.</p>

<p>"This courtyard is surrounded by another basalt wall,
rectangular, following with mathematical exactness the march of
the outer barricades. The sea-wall is from thirty to forty feet
high&mdash;originally it must have been much higher, but there
has been subsidence in parts. The wall of the first enclosure is
fifteen feet across the top and its height varies from twenty to
fifty feet&mdash;here, too, the gradual sinking of the land has
caused portions of it to fall.</p>

<p>"Within this courtyard is the second enclosure. Its terrace,
of the same basalt as the outer walls, is about twenty feet high.
Entrance is gained to it by many breaches which time has made in
its stonework. This is the inner court, the heart of Nan-Tauach!
There lies the great central vault with which is associated the
one name of living being that has come to us out of the mists of
the past. The natives say it was the treasure-house of
Chau-te-leur, a mighty king who reigned long 'before their
fathers.' As <i>Chau</i> is the ancient Ponapean word both for sun
and king, the name means, without doubt, 'place of the sun king.'
It is a memory of a dynastic name of the race that ruled the
Pacific continent, now vanished&mdash;just as the rulers of
ancient Crete took the name of Minos and the rulers of Egypt the
name of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>"And opposite this place of the sun king is the moon rock that
hides the Moon Pool.</p>

<p>"It was Stanton who discovered the moon rock. We had been
inspecting the inner courtyard; Edith and Thora were getting
together our lunch. I came out of the vault of Chau-te-leur to
find Stanton before a part of the terrace studying it
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"'What do you make of this?' he asked me as I came up. He
pointed to the wall. I followed his finger and saw a slab of
stone about fifteen feet high and ten wide. At first all I
noticed was the exquisite nicety with which its edges joined the
blocks about it. Then I realized that its color was subtly
different&mdash;tinged with grey and of a smooth, peculiar&mdash;
deadness.</p>

<p>"'Looks more like calcite than basalt,' I said. I touched it
and withdrew my hand quickly for at the contact every nerve in my
arm tingled as though a shock of frozen electricity had passed
through it. It was not cold as we know cold. It was a chill
force&mdash;the phrase I have used&mdash;frozen
electricity&mdash;describes it better than anything else. Stanton
looked at me oddly.</p>

<p>"'So you felt it too,' he said. 'I was wondering whether I was
developing hallucinations like Thora. Notice, by the way, that
the blocks beside it are quite warm beneath the sun.'</p>

<p>"We examined the slab eagerly. Its edges were cut as though by
an engraver of jewels. They fitted against the neighboring blocks
in almost a hair-line. Its base was slightly curved, and fitted
as closely as top and sides upon the huge stones on which it
rested. And then we noted that these stones had been hollowed to
follow the line of the grey stone's foot. There was a
semicircular depression running from one side of the slab to the
other. It was as though the grey rock stood in the center of a
shallow cup&mdash; revealing half, covering half. Something about
this hollow attracted me. I reached down and felt it. Goodwin,
although the balance of the stones that formed it, like all the
stones of the courtyard, were rough and age-worn &mdash;this was
as smooth, as even surfaced as though it had just left the hands
of the polisher.</p>

<p>"'It's a door!' exclaimed Stanton. 'It swings around in that
little cup. That's what makes the hollow so smooth.'</p>

<p>"'Maybe you're right,' I replied. 'But how the devil can we
open it?'</p>

<p>"We went over the slab again&mdash;pressing upon its edges,
thrusting against its sides. During one of those efforts I
happened to look up&mdash; and cried out. A foot above and on
each side of the corner of the grey rock's lintel was a slight
convexity, visible only from the angle at which my gaze struck
it.</p>

<p>"We carried with us a small scaling-ladder and up this I went.
The bosses were apparently nothing more than chiseled curvatures
in the stone. I laid my hand on the one I was examining, and drew
it back sharply. In my palm, at the base of my thumb, I had felt
the same shock that I had in touching the slab below. I put my
hand back. The impression came from a spot not more than an inch
wide. I went carefully over the entire convexity, and six times
more the chill ran through my arm. There were seven circles an
inch wide in the curved place, each of which communicated the
precise sensation I have described. The convexity on the opposite
side of the slab gave exactly the same results. But no amount of
touching or of pressing these spots singly or in any combination
gave the slightest promise of motion to the slab itself.</p>

<p>"'And yet&mdash;they're what open it,' said Stanton
positively.</p>

<p>"'Why do you say that?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'I&mdash;don't know,' he answered hesitatingly. 'But
something tells me so. Throck,' he went on half earnestly, half
laughingly, 'the purely scientific part of me is fighting the
purely human part of me. The scientific part is urging me to find
some way to get that slab either down or open. The human part is
just as strongly urging me to do nothing of the sort and get away
while I can!'</p>

<p>"He laughed again&mdash;shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"'Which shall it be?' he asked&mdash;and I thought that in his
tone the human side of him was ascendant.</p>

<p>"'It will probably stay as it is&mdash;unless we blow it to
bits,' I said.</p>

<p>"'I thought of that,' he answered, 'and I wouldn't dare,' he
added soberly enough. And even as I had spoken there came to me
the same feeling that he had expressed. It was as though
something passed out of the grey rock that struck my heart as a
hand strikes an impious lip. We turned away&mdash; uneasily, and
faced Thora coming through a breach on the terrace.</p>

<p>"'Miss Edith wants you quick,' she began&mdash;and stopped.
Her eyes went past me to the grey rock. Her body grew rigid; she
took a few stiff steps forward and then ran straight to it. She
cast herself upon its breast, hands and face pressed against it;
we heard her scream as though her very soul were being drawn from
her&mdash;and watched her fall at its foot. As we picked her up I
saw steal from her face the look I had observed when first we
heard the crystal music of Nan-Tauach&mdash;that unhuman mingling
of opposites!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4"></a>4. &mdash; THE FIRST
VANISHINGS</h2>

<p class="first">"WE carried Thora back, down to where Edith was
waiting. We told her what had happened and what we had found. She
listened gravely, and as we finished Thora sighed and opened her
eyes.</p>

<p>"'I would like to see the stone,' she said. 'Charles, you stay
here with Thora.' We passed through the outer court
silently&mdash;and stood before the rock. She touched it, drew
back her hand as I had; thrust it forward again resolutely and
held it there. She seemed to be listening. Then she turned to
me.</p>

<p>"'David,' said my wife, and the wistfulness in her voice hurt
me&mdash; 'David, would you be very, very disappointed if we went
from here&mdash; without trying to find out any more about
it&mdash;would you?'</p>

<p>"Walter, I never wanted anything so much in my life as I
wanted to learn what that rock concealed. Nevertheless, I tried
to master my desire, and I answered&mdash;'Edith, not a bit if
you want us to do it.'</p>

<p>"She read my struggle in my eyes. She turned back toward the
grey rock. I saw a shiver pass through her. I felt a tinge of
remorse and pity!</p>

<p>"'Edith,' I exclaimed, 'we'll go!'</p>

<p>"She looked at me again. 'Science is a jealous mistress,' she
quoted. 'No, after all it may be just fancy. At any rate, you
can't run away. No! But, Dave, I'm going to stay too!'</p>

<p>"And there was no changing her decision. As we neared the
others she laid a hand on my arm.</p>

<p>"'Dave,' she said, 'if there should be
something&mdash;well&mdash; inexplicable tonight&mdash;something
that seems&mdash;too dangerous &mdash;will you promise to go back
to our own islet tomorrow, if we can &mdash;and wait until the
natives return?'</p>

<p>"I promised eagerly&mdash;the desire to stay and see what came
with the night was like a fire within me.</p>

<p>"We picked a place about five hundred feet away from the steps
leading into the outer court.</p>

<p>"The spot we had selected was well hidden. We could not be
seen, and yet we had a clear view of the stairs and the gateway.
We settled down just before dusk to wait for whatever might come.
I was nearest the giant steps; next me Edith; then Thora, and
last Stanton.</p>

<p>"Night fell. After a time the eastern sky began to lighten,
and we knew that the moon was rising; grew lighter still, and the
orb peeped over the sea; swam into full sight. I glanced at Edith
and then at Thora. My wife was intently listening. Thora sat, as
she had since we had placed ourselves, elbows on knees, her hands
covering her face.</p>

<p>"And then from the moonlight flooding us there dripped down on
me a great drowsiness. Sleep seemed to seep from the rays and
fall upon my eyes, closing them&mdash;closing them inexorably.
Edith's hand in mine relaxed. Stanton's head fell upon his breast
and his body swayed drunkenly. I tried to rise &mdash;to fight
against the profound desire for slumber that pressed on me.</p>

<p>"And as I fought, Thora raised her head as though listening;
and turned toward the gateway. There was infinite despair in her
face&mdash;and expectancy. I tried again to rise&mdash;and a
surge of sleep rushed over me. Dimly, as I sank within it, I
heard a crystalline chiming; raised my lids once more with a
supreme effort.</p>

<p>"Thora, bathed in light, was standing at the top of the
stairs.</p>

<p>"Sleep took me for its very own&mdash;swept me into the heart
of oblivion!</p>

<p>"Dawn was breaking when I wakened. Recollection rushed back; I
thrust a panic-stricken hand out toward Edith; touched her and my
heart gave a great leap of thankfulness. She stirred, sat up,
rubbing dazed eyes. Stanton lay on his side, back toward us, head
in arms.</p>

<p>"Edith looked at me laughingly. 'Heavens! What sleep!' she
said. Memory came to her.</p>

<p>"'What happened?' she whispered. 'What made us sleep like
that?'</p>

<p>"Stanton awoke.</p>

<p>"'What's the matter!' he exclaimed. 'You look as though you've
been seeing ghosts.'</p>

<p>"Edith caught my hands.</p>

<p>"'Where's Thora?' she cried. Before I could answer she had run
out into the open, calling.</p>

<p>"'Thora was taken,' was all I could say to Stanton, 'together
we went to my wife, now standing beside the great stone steps,
looking up fearfully at the gateway into the terraces. There I
told them what I had seen before sleep had drowned me. And
together then we ran up the stairs, through the court and to the
grey rock.</p>

<p>"The slab was closed as it had been the day before, nor was
there trace of its having opened. No trace? Even as I thought
this Edith dropped to her knees before it and reached toward
something lying at its foot. It was a little piece of gay silk. I
knew it for part of the kerchief Thora wore about her hair. She
lifted the fragment. It had been cut from the kerchief as though
by a razor-edge; a few threads ran from it&mdash;down toward the
base of the slab; ran on to the base of the grey rock
and&mdash;under it!</p>

<p>"The grey rock was a door! And it had opened and Thora had
passed through it!</p>

<p>"I think that for the next few minutes we all were a little
insane. We beat upon that portal with our hands, with stones and
sticks. At last reason came back to us.</p>

<p>"Goodwin, during the next two hours we tried every way in our
power to force entrance through the slab. The rock resisted our
drills. We tried explosions at the base with charges covered by
rock. They made not the slightest impression on the surface,
expending their force, of course, upon the slighter resistance of
their coverings.</p>

<p>"Afternoon found us hopeless. Night was coming on and we would
have to decide our course of action. I wanted to go to Ponape for
help. But Edith objected that this would take hours and after we
had reached there it would be impossible to persuade our men to
return with us that night, if at all. What then was left? Clearly
only one of two choices: to go back to our camp, wait for our
men, and on their return try to persuade them to go with us to
Nan-Tauach. But this would mean the abandonment of Thora for at
least two days. We could not do it; it would have been too
cowardly.</p>

<p>"The other choice was to wait where we were for night to come;
to wait for the rock to open as it had the night before, and to
make a sortie through it for Thora before it could close
again.</p>

<p>"Our path lay clear before us. We had to spend that night on
Nan-Tauach!</p>

<p>"We had, of course, discussed the sleep phenomena very fully.
If our theory that lights, sounds, and Thora's disappearance were
linked with secret religious rites of the natives, the logical
inference was that the slumber had been produced by them, perhaps
by vapors&mdash;you know as well as I, what extraordinary
knowledge these Pacific peoples have of such things. Or the sleep
might have been simply a coincidence and produced by emanations
either gaseous or from plants, natural causes which had happened
to coincide in their effects with the other manifestations. We
made some rough and ready but effective respirators.</p>

<p>"As dusk fell we looked over our weapons. Edith was an
excellent shot with both rifle and pistol. We had decided that my
wife was to remain in the hiding-place. Stanton would take up a
station on the far side of the stairway and I would place myself
opposite him on the side near Edith. The place I picked out was
less than two hundred feet from her, and I could reassure myself
now and then as to her safety as it looked down upon the hollow
wherein she crouched. From our respective stations Stanton and I
could command the gateway entrance. His position gave him also a
glimpse of the outer courtyard.</p>

<p>"A faint glow in the sky heralded the moon. Stanton and I took
our places. The moon dawn increased rapidly; the disk swam up,
and in a moment it was shining in full radiance upon ruins and
sea.</p>

<p>"As it rose there came a curious little sighing sound from the
inner terrace. Stanton straightened up and stared intently
through the gateway, rifle ready.</p>

<p>"'Stanton, what do you see?' I called cautiously. He waved a
silencing hand. I turned my head to look at Edith. A shock ran
through me. She lay upon her side. Her face, grotesque with its
nose and mouth covered by the respirator, was turned full toward
the moon. She was again in deepest sleep!</p>

<p>"As I turned again to call to Stanton, my eyes swept the head
of the steps and stopped, fascinated. For the moonlight had
thickened. It seemed to be &mdash;curdled&mdash;there; and
through it ran little gleams and veins of shimmering white fire.
A languor passed through me. It was not the ineffable drowsiness
of the preceding night. It was a sapping of all will to move. I
tried to cry out to Stanton. I had not even the will to move my
lips. Goodwin &mdash;I could not even move my eyes!</p>

<p>"Stanton was in the range of my fixed vision. I watched him
leap up the steps and move toward the gateway. The curdled
radiance seemed to await him. He stepped into it&mdash;and was
lost to my sight.</p>

<p>"For a dozen heart beats there was silence. Then a rain of
tinklings that set the pulses racing with joy and at once checked
them with tiny fingers of ice&mdash;and ringing through them
Stanton's voice from the courtyard &mdash;a great cry&mdash;a
scream&mdash;filled with ecstasy insupportable and horror
unimaginable! And once more there was silence. I strove to burst
the bonds that held me. I could not. Even my eyelids were fixed.
Within them my eyes, dry and aching, burned.</p>

<p>"Then Goodwin&mdash;I first saw the&mdash;inexplicable! The
crystalline music swelled. Where I sat I could take in the
gateway and its basalt portals, rough and broken, rising to the
top of the wall forty feet above, shattered, ruined
portals&mdash;unclimbable. From this gateway an intenser light
began to flow. It grew, it gushed, and out of it walked
Stanton.</p>

<p>"Stanton! But&mdash;God! What a vision!"</p>

<p>A deep tremor shook him. I waited&mdash;waited.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5"></a>5. &mdash; INTO THE MOON
POOL</h2>

<p class="first">"Goodwin," Throckmartin went on at last, "I can
describe him only as a thing of living light. He radiated light;
was filled with light; overflowed with it. A shining cloud
whirled through and around him in radiant swirls, shimmering
tentacles, luminescent, coruscating spirals.</p>

<p>"His face shone with a rapture too great to be borne by living
man, and was shadowed with insuperable misery. It was as though
it had been remoulded by the hand of God and the hand of Satan,
working together and in harmony. You have seen that seal upon my
own. But you have never seen it in the degree that Stanton bore
it. The eyes were wide open and fixed, as though upon some inward
vision of hell and heaven!</p>

<p>"The light that filled and surrounded him had a nucleus, a
core&mdash; something shiftingly human shaped&mdash;that
dissolved and changed, gathered itself, whirled through and
beyond him and back again. And as its shining nucleus passed
through him Stanton's whole body pulsed radiance. As the
luminescence moved, there moved above it, still and serene
always, seven tiny globes of seven colors, like seven little
moons.</p>

<p>"Then swiftly Stanton was lifted&mdash;levitated&mdash;up the
unscalable wall and to its top. The glow faded from the
moonlight, the tinkling music grew fainter. I tried again to
move. The tears were running down now from my rigid lids and they
brought relief to my tortured eyes.</p>

<p>"I have said my gaze was fixed. It was. But from the side,
peripherally, it took in a part of the far wall of the outer
enclosure. Ages seemed to pass and a radiance stole along it.
Soon drifted into sight the figure that was Stanton. Far away he
was&mdash;on the gigantic wall. But still I could see the shining
spirals whirling jubilantly around and through him; felt rather
than saw his tranced face beneath the seven moons. A swirl of
crystal notes, and he had passed. And all the time, as though
from some opened well of light, the courtyard gleamed and sent
out silver fires that dimmed the moon-rays, yet seemed strangely
to be a part of them.</p>

<p>"At last the moon neared the horizon. There came a louder
burst of sound; the second, and last, cry of Stanton, like an
echo of his first! Again the soft sighing from the inner terrace.
Then&mdash;utter silence!</p>

<p>"The light faded; the moon was setting and with a rush life
and power to move returned to me. I made a leap for the steps,
rushed up them, through the gateway and straight to the grey
rock. It was closed&mdash;as I knew it would be. But did I dream
it or did I hear, echoing through it as though from vast
distances a triumphant shouting?</p>

<p>"I ran back to Edith. At my touch she wakened; looked at me
wonderingly; raised herself on a hand.</p>

<p>"'Dave!' she said, 'I slept&mdash;after all.' She saw the
despair on my face and leaped to her feet. 'Dave!' she cried.
'What is it? Where's Charles?'</p>

<p>"I lighted a fire before I spoke. Then I told her. And for the
balance of that night we sat before the flames, arms around each
other&mdash;like two frightened children."</p>

<p>Abruptly Throckmartin held his hands out to me
appealingly.</p>

<p>"Walter, old friend!" he cried. "Don't look at me as though I
were mad. It's truth, absolute truth. Wait&mdash;" I comforted
him as well as I could. After a little time he took up his
story.</p>

<p>"Never," he said, "did man welcome the sun as we did that
morning. A soon as it had risen we went back to the courtyard.
The walls whereon I had seen Stanton were black and silent. The
terraces were as they had been. The grey slab was in its place.
In the shallow hollow at its base was&mdash;nothing.
Nothing&mdash;nothing was there anywhere on the islet of
Stanton&mdash; not a trace.</p>

<p>"What were we to do? Precisely the same arguments that had
kept us there the night before held good now&mdash;and doubly
good. We could not abandon these two; could not go as long as
there was the faintest hope of finding them&mdash;and yet for
love of each other how could we remain? I loved my
wife,&mdash;how much I never knew until that day; and she loved
me as deeply.</p>

<p>"'It takes only one each night,a she pleaded. 'Beloved, let it
take me.'</p>

<p>"I wept, Walter. We both wept.</p>

<p>"'We will meet it together,a she said. And it was thus at last
that we arranged it."</p>

<p>"That took great courage indeed, Throckmartin," I interrupted.
He looked at me eagerly.</p>

<p>"You do believe then?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I believe," I said. He pressed my hand with a grip that
nearly crushed it.</p>

<p>"Now," he told me. "I do not fear. If I&mdash;fail, you will
follow with help?"</p>

<p>I promised.</p>

<p>"We talked it over carefully," he went on, "bringing to bear
all our power of analysis and habit of calm, scientific thought.
We considered minutely the time element in the phenomena.
Although the deep chanting began at the very moment of moonrise,
fully five minutes had passed between its full lifting and the
strange sighing sound from the inner terrace. I went back in
memory over the happenings of the night before. At least ten
minutes had intervened between the first heralding sigh and the
intensification of the moonlight in the courtyard. And this glow
grew for at least ten minutes more before the first burst of the
crystal notes. Indeed, more than half an hour must have elapsed,
I calculated, between the moment the moon showed above the
horizon and the first delicate onslaught of the tinklings.</p>

<p>"'Edith!' I cried. 'I think I have it! The grey rock opens
five minutes after upon the moonrise. But whoever or whatever it
is that comes through it must wait until the moon has risen
higher, or else it must come from a distance. The thing to do is
not to wait for it, but to surprise it before it passes out the
door. We will go into the inner court early. You will take your
rifle and pistol and hide yourself where you can command the
opening &mdash;if the slab does open. The instant it opens I will
enter. It's our best chance, Edith. I think it's our only
one.'</p>

<p>"My wife demurred strongly. She wanted to go with me. But I
convinced her that it was better for her to stand guard without,
prepared to help me if I were forced again into the open by what
lay behind the rock.</p>

<p>"At the half-hour before moonrise we went into the inner
court. I took my place at the side of the grey rock. Edith
crouched behind a broken pillar twenty feet away; slipped her
rifle-barrel over it so that it would cover the opening.</p>

<p>"The minutes crept by. The darkness lessened and through the
breaches of the terrace I watched the far sky softly lighten.
With the first pale flush the silence of the place intensified.
It deepened; became unbearably&mdash; expectant. The moon rose,
showed the quarter, the half, then swam up into full sight like a
great bubble.</p>

<p>"Its rays fell upon the wall before me and suddenly upon the
convexities I have described seven little circles of light sprang
out. They gleamed, glimmered, grew brighter&mdash;shone. The
gigantic slab before me glowed with them, silver wavelets of
phosphorescence pulsed over its surface and then&mdash;it turned
as though on a pivot, sighing softly as it moved!</p>

<p>"With a word to Edith I flung myself through the opening. A
tunnel stretched before me. It glowed with the same faint silvery
radiance. Down it I raced. The passage turned abruptly, passed
parallel to the walls of the outer courtyard and then once more
led downward.</p>

<p>"The passage ended. Before me was a high vaulted arch. It
seemed to open into space; a space filled with lambent,
coruscating, many-colored mist whose brightness grew even as I
watched. I passed through the arch and stopped in sheer awe!</p>

<p>"In front of me was a pool. It was circular, perhaps twenty
feet wide. Around it ran a low, softly curved lip of glimmering
silvery stone. Its water was palest blue. The pool with its
silvery rim was like a great blue eye staring upward.</p>

<p>"Upon it streamed seven shafts of radiance.Upon it streamed seven shafts of radiance. They poured down
upon the blue eye like cylindrical torrents; they were like
shining pillars of light rising from a sapphire floor.</p>

<p class="caption">
"Upon the pool streamed seven shafts of radiance."</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>"One was the tender pink of the pearl; one of the aurora's
green; a third a deathly white; the fourth the blue in
mother-of-pearl; a shimmering column of pale amber; a beam of
amethyst; a shaft of molten silver. Such are the colors of the
seven lights that stream upon the Moon Pool. I drew closer,
awe-stricken. The shafts did not illumine the depths. They played
upon the surface and seemed there to diffuse, to melt into it.
The Pool drank them?</p>

<p>"Through the water tiny gleams of phosphorescence began to
dart, sparkles and coruscations of pale incandescence. And far,
far below I sensed a movement, a shifting glow as of a radiant
body slowly rising.</p>

<p>"I looked upward, following the radiant pillars to their
source. Far above were seven shining globes, and it was from
these that the rays poured. Even as I watched their brightness
grew. They were like seven moons set high in some caverned
heaven. Slowly their splendor increased, and with it the splendor
of the seven beams streaming from them.</p>

<p>"I tore my gaze away and stared at the Pool. It had grown
milky, opalescent. The rays gushing into it seemed to be filling
it; it was alive with sparklings, scintillations, glimmerings.
And the luminescence I had seen rising from its depths was
larger, nearer!</p>

<p>"A swirl of mist floated up from its surface. It drifted
within the embrace of the rosy beam and hung there for a moment.
The beam seemed to embrace it, sending through it little shining
corpuscles, tiny rosy spiralings. The mist absorbed the rays, was
strengthened by them, gained substance. Another swirl sprang into
the amber shaft, clung and fed there, moved swiftly toward the
first and mingled with it. And now other swirls arose, here and
there, too fast to be counted; hung poised in the embrace of the
light streams; flashed and pulsed into each other.</p>

<p>"Thicker and thicker still they arose until over the surface
of the Pool was a pulsating pillar of opalescent mist steadily
growing stronger; drawing within it life from the seven beams
falling upon it; drawing to it from below the darting,
incandescent atoms of the Pool. Into its center was passing the
luminescence rising from the far depths. And the pillar glowed,
throbbed &mdash;began to send out questing swirls and
tendrils&mdash;</p>

<p>"There forming before me was That which had walked with
Stanton, which had taken Thora&mdash;the thing I had come to
find!</p>

<p>"My brain sprang into action. My hand threw up the pistol and
I fired shot after shot into the shining core.</p>

<p>"As I fired, it swayed and shook; gathered again. I slipped a
second clip into the automatic and another idea coming to me took
careful aim at one of the globes in the roof. From thence I knew
came the force that shaped this Dweller in the Pool&mdash;from
the pouring rays came its strength. If I could destroy them I
could check its forming. I fired again and again. If I hit the
globes I did no damage. The little motes in their beams danced
with the motes in the mist, troubled. That was all.</p>

<p>"But up from the Pool like little bells, like tiny bursting
bubbles of glass, swarmed the tinkling sounds&mdash;their pitch
higher, all their sweetness lost, angry.</p>

<p>"And out from the Inexplicable swept a shining spiral.</p>

<p>"It caught me above the heart; wrapped itself around me. There
rushed through me a mingled ecstasy and horror. Every atom of me
quivered with delight and shrank with despair. There was nothing
loathsome in it. But it was as though the icy soul of evil and
the fiery soul of good had stepped together within me. The pistol
dropped from my hand.</p>

<p>"So I stood while the Pool gleamed and sparkled; the streams
of light grew more intense and the radiant Thing that held me
gleamed and strengthened. Its shining core had shape&mdash;but a
shape that my eyes and brain could not define. It was as though a
being of another sphere should assume what it might of human
semblance, but was not able to conceal that what human eyes saw
was but a part of it. It was neither man nor woman; it was
unearthly and androgynous. Even as I found its human semblance it
changed. And still the mingled rapture and terror held me. Only
in a little corner of my brain dwelt something untouched;
something that held itself apart and watched. Was it the soul? I
have never believed&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>

<p>"Over the head of the misty body there sprang suddenly out
seven little lights. Each was the color of the beam beneath which
it rested. I knew now that the Dweller was&mdash;complete!</p>

<p>"I heard a scream. It was Edith's voice. It came to me that
she had heard the shots and followed me. I felt every faculty
concentrate into a mighty effort. I wrenched myself free from the
gripping tentacle and it swept back. I turned to catch Edith, and
as I did so slipped&mdash;fell.</p>

<p>"The radiant shape above the Pool leaped swiftly&mdash;and
straight into it raced Edith, arms outstretched to shield me from
it! God!</p>

<p>"She threw herself squarely within its splendor," he
whispered. "It wrapped its shining self around her. The crystal
tinklings burst forth jubilantly. The light filled her, ran
through and around her as it had with Stanton; and dropped down
upon her face&mdash;the look!</p>

<p>"But her rush had taken her to the very verge of the Moon
Pool. She tottered; she fell&mdash;with the radiance still
holding her, still swirling and winding around and through
her&mdash;into the Moon Pool! She sank, and with her
went&mdash;the Dweller!</p>

<p>"I dragged myself to the brink. Far down was a shining,
many-colored nebulous cloud descending; out of it peered Edith's
face, disappearing; her eyes stared up at me&mdash;and she
vanished!</p>

<p>"'Edith!' I cried again. 'Edith, come back to me!'</p>

<p>"And then a darkness fell upon me. I remember running back
through the shimmering corridors and out into the courtyard.
Reason had left me. When it returned I was far out at sea in our
boat wholly estranged from civilization. A day later I was picked
up by the schooner in which I came to Port Moresby.</p>

<p>"I have formed a plan; you must hear it, Goodwin&mdash;" He
fell upon his berth. I bent over him. Exhaustion and the relief
of telling his story had been too much for him. He slept like the
dead.</p>

<p>All that night I watched over him. When dawn broke I went to
my room to get a little sleep myself. But my slumber was
haunted.</p>

<p>The next day the storm was unabated. Throckmartin came to me
at lunch. He had regained much of his old alertness.</p>

<p>"Come to my cabin," he said. There, he stripped his shirt from
him. "Something is happening," he said. "The mark is smaller." It
was as he said.</p>

<p>"I'm escaping," he whispered jubilantly, "Just let me get to
Melbourne safely, and then we'll see who'll win! For, Walter, I'm
not at all sure that Edith is dead&mdash;as we know
death&mdash;nor that the others are. There is something outside
experience there&mdash;some great mystery."</p>

<p>And all that day he talked to me of his plans.</p>

<p>"There's a natural explanation, of course," he said. "My
theory is that the moon rock is of some composition sensitive to
the action of moon rays; somewhat as the metal selenium is to sun
rays. The little circles over the top are, without doubt, its
operating agency. When the light strikes them they release the
mechanism that opens the slab, just as you can open doors with
sun or electric light by an ingenious arrangement of selenium
cells. Apparently it takes the strength of the full moon both to
do this and to summon the Dweller in the Pool. We will first try
a concentration of the rays of the waning moon upon these circles
to see whether that will open the rock. If it does we will be
able to investigate the Pool without interruption from
&mdash;from&mdash;what emanates.</p>

<p>"Look, here on the chart are their locations. I have made this
in duplicate for you in the event&mdash;of something
happening&mdash;to me. And if I lose&mdash;you'll come after us,
Goodwin, with help&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>And again I promised.</p>

<p>A little later he complained of increasing sleepiness.</p>

<p>"But it's just weariness," he said. "Not at all like that
other drowsiness. It's an hour till moonrise still," he yawned at
last. "Wake me up a good fifteen minutes before."</p>

<p>He lay upon the berth. I sat thinking. I came to myself with a
guilty start. I had completely lost myself in my deep
preoccupation. What time was it? I looked at my watch and jumped
to the port-hole. It was full moonlight; the orb had been up for
fully half an hour. I strode over to Throckmartin and shook him
by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Up, quick, man!" I cried. He rose sleepily. His shirt fell
open at the neck and I looked, in amazement, at the white band
around his chest. Even under the electric light it shone softly,
as though little flecks of light were in it.</p>

<p>Throckmartin seemed only half-awake. He looked down at his
breast, saw the glowing cincture, and smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said drowsily, "it's coming&mdash;to take me back to
Edith! Well, I'm glad."</p>

<p>"Throckmartin!" I cried. "Wake up! Fight!"</p>

<p>"Fight!" he said. "No use; come after us!"</p>

<p>He went to the port and sleepily drew aside the curtain. The
moon traced a broad path of light straight to the ship. Under its
rays the band around his chest gleamed brighter and brighter;
shot forth little rays; seemed to writhe.</p>

<p>The lights went out in the cabin; evidently also throughout
the ship, for I heard shoutings above.</p>

<p>Throckmartin still stood at the open port. Over his shoulder I
saw a gleaming pillar racing along the moon path toward us.
Through the window cascaded a blinding radiance. It gathered
Throckmartin to it, clothed him in a robe of living opalescence.
Light pulsed through and from him. The cabin filled with
murmurings&mdash;</p>

<p>A wave of weakness swept over me, buried me in blackness. When
consciousness came back, the lights were again burning
brightly.</p>

<p>But of Throckmartin there was no trace!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6"></a>6. &mdash; "THE SHINING DEVIL
TOOK THEM!"</h2>

<p class="first">My colleagues of the Association, and you others
who may read this my narrative, for what I did and did not when
full realization returned I must offer here, briefly as I can, an
explanation; a defense&mdash;if you will.</p>

<p>My first act was to spring to the open port. The coma had
lasted hours, for the moon was now low in the west! I ran to the
door to sound the alarm. It resisted under my frantic hands;
would not open. Something fell tinkling to the floor. It was the
key and I remembered then that Throckmartin had turned it before
we began our vigil. With memory a hope died that I had not known
was in me, the hope that he had escaped from the cabin, found
refuge elsewhere on the ship.</p>

<p>And as I stooped, fumbling with shaking fingers for the key, a
thought came to me that drove again the blood from my heart, held
me rigid. I could sound no alarm on the Southern Queen for
Throckmartin!</p>

<p>Conviction of my appalling helplessness was complete. The
ensemble of the vessel from captain to cabin boy was, to put it
conservatively, average. None, I knew, save Throckmartin and
myself had seen the first apparition of the Dweller. Had they
witnessed the second? I did not know, nor could I risk speaking,
not knowing. And not seeing, how could they believe? They would
have thought me insane&mdash;or worse; even, it might be, his
murderer.</p>

<p>I snapped off the electrics; waited and listened; opened the
door with infinite caution and slipped, unseen, into my own
stateroom. The hours until the dawn were eternities of waking
nightmare. Reason, resuming sway at last, steadied me. Even had I
spoken and been believed where in these wastes after all the
hours could we search for Throckmartin? Certainly the captain
would not turn back to Port Moresby. And even if he did, of what
use for me to set forth for the Nan-Matal without the equipment
which Throckmartin himself had decided was necessary if one hoped
to cope with the mystery that lurked there?</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do&mdash;follow his instructions;
get the paraphernalia in Melbourne or Sydney if it were possible;
if not sail to America as swiftly as might be, secure it there
and as swiftly return to Ponape. And this I determined to do.</p>

<p>Calmness came back to me after I had made this decision. And
when I went up on deck I knew that I had been right. They had not
seen the Dweller. They were still discussing the darkening of the
ship, talking of dynamos burned out, wires short circuited, a
half dozen explanations of the extinguishment. Not until noon was
Throckmartin's absence discovered. I told the captain that I had
left him early in the evening; that, indeed, I knew him but
slightly, after all. It occurred to none to doubt me, or to
question me minutely. Why should it have? His strangeness had
been noted, commented upon; all who had met him had thought him
half mad. I did little to discourage the impression. And so it
came naturally that on the log it was entered that he had fallen
or leaped from the vessel some time during the night.</p>

<p>A report to this effect was made when we entered Melbourne. I
slipped quietly ashore and in the press of the war news
Throckmartin's supposed fate won only a few lines in the
newspapers; my own presence on the ship and in the city passed
unnoticed.</p>

<p>I was fortunate in securing at Melbourne everything I needed
except a set of Becquerel ray condensers&mdash;but these were the
very keystone of my equipment. Pursuing my search to Sydney I was
doubly fortunate in finding a firm who were expecting these very
articles in a consignment due them from the States within a
fortnight. I settled down in strictest seclusion to await their
arrival.</p>

<p>And now it will occur to you to ask why I did not cable,
during this period of waiting, to the Association; demand aid
from it. Or why I did not call upon members of the University
staffs of either Melbourne or Sydney for assistance. At the
least, why I did not gather, as Throckmartin had hoped to do, a
little force of strong men to go with me to the Nan-Matal.</p>

<p>To the first two questions I answer frankly&mdash;I did not
dare. And this reluctance, this inhibition, every man jealous of
his scientific reputation will understand. The story of
Throckmartin, the happenings I had myself witnessed, were
incredible, abnormal, outside the facts of all known science. I
shrank from the inevitable disbelief, perhaps ridicule&mdash;
nay, perhaps even the graver suspicion that had caused me to seal
my lips while on the ship. Why I myself could only half believe!
How then could I hope to convince others?</p>

<p>And as for the third question&mdash;I could not take men into
the range of such a peril without first warning them of what they
might encounter; and if I did warn them&mdash;</p>

<p>It was checkmate! If it also was cowardice&mdash;well, I have
atoned for it. But I do not hold it so; my conscience is
clear.</p>

<p>That fortnight and the greater part of another passed before
the ship I awaited steamed into port. By that time, between my
straining anxiety to be after Throckmartin, the despairing
thought that every moment of delay might be vital to him and his,
and my intensely eager desire to know whether that shining,
glorious horror on the moon path did exist or had been
hallucination, I was worn almost to the edge of madness.</p>

<p>At last the condensers were in my hands. It was more than a
week later, however, before I could secure passage back to Port
Moresby and it was another week still before I started north on
the Suwarna, a swift little sloop with a fifty-horsepower
auxiliary, heading straight for Ponape and the Nan-Matal.</p>

<p>We sighted the Brunhilda some five hundred miles south of the
Carolines. The wind had fallen soon after Papua had dropped
astern. The Suwarna's ability to make her twelve knots an hour
without it had made me very fully forgive her for not being as
fragrant as the Javan flower for which she was named. Da Costa,
her captain, was a garrulous Portuguese; his mate was a Canton
man with all the marks of long and able service on some pirate
junk; his engineer was a half-breed China-Malay who had picked up
his knowledge of power plants, Heaven alone knew where, and, I
had reason to believe, had transferred all his religious impulses
to the American built deity of mechanism he so faithfully served.
The crew was made up of six huge, chattering Tonga boys.</p>

<p>The Suwarna had cut through Finschafen Huon Gulf to the
protection of the Bismarcks. She had threaded the maze of the
archipelago tranquilly, and we were then rolling over the
thousand-mile stretch of open ocean with New Hanover far behind
us and our boat's bow pointed straight toward Nukuor of the Monte
Verdes. After we had rounded Nukuor we should, barring accident,
reach Ponape in not more than sixty hours.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon, and on the demure little breeze that
marched behind us came far-flung sighs of spice-trees and nutmeg
flowers. The slow prodigious swells of the Pacific lifted us in
gentle, giant hands and sent us as gently down the long, blue
wave slopes to the next broad, upward slope. There was a spell of
peace over the ocean, stilling even the Portuguese captain who
stood dreamily at the wheel, slowly swaying to the rhythmic lift
and fall of the sloop.</p>

<p>There came a whining hail from the Tonga boy lookout draped
lazily over the bow.</p>

<p>"Sail he b'long port side!"</p>

<p>Da Costa straightened and gazed while I raised my glass. The
vessel was a scant mile away, and must have been visible long
before the sleepy watcher had seen her. She was a sloop about the
size of the Suwarna, without power. All sails set, even to a
spinnaker she carried, she was making the best of the little
breeze. I tried to read her name, but the vessel jibed sharply as
though the hands of the man at the wheel had suddenly dropped the
helm &mdash;and then with equal abruptness swung back to her
course. The stern came in sight, and on it I read Brunhilda.</p>

<p>I shifted my glasses to the man at wheel. He was crouching
down over the spokes in a helpless, huddled sort of way, and even
as I looked the vessel veered again, abruptly as before. I saw
the helmsman straighten up and bring the wheel about with a
vicious jerk.</p>

<p>He stood so for a moment, looking straight ahead, entirely
oblivious of us, and then seemed again to sink down within
himself. It came to me that his was the action of a man striving
vainly against a weariness unutterable. I swept the deck with my
glasses. There was no other sign of life. I turned to find the
Portuguese staring intently and with puzzled air at the sloop,
now separated from us by a scant half mile.</p>

<p>"Something veree wrong I think there, sair," he said in his
curious English. "The man on deck I know. He is captain and owner
of the Br-rwun'ild. His name Olaf Huldricksson, what you
say&mdash;Norwegian. He is eithair veree sick or veree
tired&mdash;but I do not undweerstand where is the crew and the
starb'd boat is gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shouted an order to the engineer and as he did so the faint
breeze failed and the sails of the Brunhilda flapped down inert.
We were now nearly abreast and a scant hundred yards away. The
engine of the Suwarna died and the Tonga boys leaped to one of
the boats.</p>

<p>"You Olaf Huldricksson!" shouted Da Costa. "What's a matter
wit' you?"</p>

<p>The man at the wheel turned toward us. He was a giant; his
shoulders enormous, thick chested, strength in every line of him,
he towered like a viking of old at the rudder bar of his shark
ship.</p>

<p>I raised the glass again; his face sprang into the lens and
never have I seen a visage lined and marked as though by ages of
unsleeping misery as was that of Olaf Huldricksson!</p>

<p>The Tonga boys had the boat alongside and were waiting at the
oars. The little captain was dropping into it.</p>

<p>"Wait!" I cried. I ran into my cabin, grasped my emergency
medical kit and climbed down the rope ladder. The Tonga boys bent
to the oars. We reached the side and Da Costa and I each seized a
lanyard dangling from the stays and swung ourselves on board. Da
Costa approached Huldricksson softly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Olaf?" he began&mdash;and then was silent,
looking down at the wheel. The hands of Huldricksson were lashed
fast to the spokes by thongs of thin, strong cord; they were
swollen and black and the thongs had bitten into the sinewy
wrists till they were hidden in the outraged flesh, cutting so
deeply that blood fell, slow drop by drop, at his feet! We sprang
toward him, reaching out hands to his fetters to loose them. Even
as we touched them, Huldricksson aimed a vicious kick at me and
then another at Da Costa which sent the Portuguese tumbling into
the scuppers.</p>

<p>"Let be!" croaked Huldricksson; his voice was thick and
lifeless as though forced from a dead throat; his lips were
cracked and dry and his parched tongue was black. "Let be! Go!
Let be!"</p>

<p>The Portuguese had picked himself up, whimpering with rage and
knife in hand, but as Huldricksson's voice reached him he
stopped. Amazement crept into his eyes and as he thrust the blade
back into his belt they softened with pity.</p>

<p>"Something veree wrong wit' Olaf," he murmured to me. "I think
he crazee!" And then Olaf Huldricksson began to curse us. He did
not speak&mdash;he howled from that hideously dry mouth his
imprecations. And all the time his red eyes roamed the seas and
his hands, clenched and rigid on the wheel, dropped blood.</p>

<p>"I go below," said Da Costa nervously. "His wife, his
daughter&mdash;" he darted down the companionway and was
gone.</p>

<p>Huldricksson, silent once more, had slumped down over the
wheel.</p>

<p>Da Costa's head appeared at the top of the companion
steps.</p>

<p>"There is nobody, nobody," he
paused&mdash;then&mdash;"nobody&mdash; nowhere!" His hands flew
out in a gesture of hopeless incomprehension. "I do not
understan'."</p>

<p>Then Olaf Huldricksson opened his dry lips and as he spoke a
chill ran through me, checking my heart.</p>

<p>"The sparkling devil took them!" croaked Olaf Huldricksson,
"the sparkling devil took them! Took my Helma and my little
Freda! The sparkling devil came down from the moon and took
them!"</p>

<p>He swayed; tears dripped down his cheeks. Da Costa moved
toward him again and again Huldricksson watched him, alertly,
wickedly, from his bloodshot eyes.</p>

<p>I took a hypodermic from my case and filled it with morphine.
I drew Da Costa to me.</p>

<p>"Get to the side of him," I whispered, "talk to him." He moved
over toward the wheel.</p>

<p>"Where is your Helma and Freda, Olaf?" he said.</p>

<p>Huldricksson turned his head toward him. "The shining devil
took them," he croaked. "The moon devil that spark&mdash;"</p>

<p>A yell broke from him. I had thrust the needle into his arm
just above one swollen wrist and had quickly shot the drug
through. He struggled to release himself and then began to rock
drunkenly. The morphine, taking him in his weakness, worked
quickly. Soon over his face a peace dropped. The pupils of the
staring eyes contracted. Once, twice, he swayed and then, his
bleeding, prisoned hands held high and still gripping the wheel,
he crumpled to the deck.</p>

<p>With utmost difficulty we loosed the thongs, but at last it
was done. We rigged a little swing and the Tonga boys slung the
great inert body over the side into the dory. Soon we had
Huldricksson in my bunk. Da Costa sent half his crew over to the
sloop in charge of the Cantonese. They took in all sail,
stripping Huldricksson's boat to the masts and then with the
Brunhilda nosing quietly along after us at the end of a long
hawser, one of the Tonga boys at her wheel, we resumed the way so
enigmatically interrupted.</p>

<p>I cleansed and bandaged the Norseman's lacerated wrists and
sponged the blackened, parched mouth with warm water and a mild
antiseptic.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was aware of Da Costa's presence and turned. His
unease was manifest and held, it seemed to me, a queer, furtive
anxiety.</p>

<p>"What you think of Olaf, sair?" he asked. I shrugged my
shoulders. "You think he killed his woman and his babee?" He went
on. "You think he crazee and killed all?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Da Costa," I answered. "You saw the boat was gone.
Most probably his crew mutinied and to torture him tied him up
the way you saw. They did the same thing with Hilton of the Coral
Lady; you'll remember."</p>

<p>"No," he said. "No. The crew did not. Nobody there on board
when Olaf was tied."</p>

<p>"What!" I cried, startled. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," he said slowly, "that Olaf tie himself!"</p>

<p>"Wait!" he went on at my incredulous gesture of dissent.
"Wait, I show you." He had been standing with hands behind his
back and now I saw that he held in them the cut thongs that had
bound Huldricksson. They were blood-stained and each ended in a
broad leather tip skillfully spliced into the cord. "Look," he
said, pointing to these leather ends. I looked and saw in them
deep indentations of teeth. I snatched one of the thongs and
opened the mouth of the unconscious man on the bunk. Carefully I
placed the leather within it and gently forced the jaws shut on
it. It was true. Those marks were where Olaf Huldricksson's jaws
had gripped.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Da Costa repeated, "I show you." He took other cords
and rested his hands on the supports of a chair back. Rapidly he
twisted one of the thongs around his left hand, drew a loose
knot, shifted the cord up toward his elbow. This left wrist and
hand still free and with them he twisted the other cord around
the right wrist; drew a similar knot. His hands were now in the
exact position that Huldricksson's had been on the Brunhilda but
with cords and knots hanging loose. Then Da Costa reached down
his head, took a leather end in his teeth and with a jerk drew
the thong that noosed his left hand tight; similarly he drew
tight the second.</p>

<p>He strained at his fetters. There before my eyes he had
pinioned himself so that without aid he could not release
himself. And he was exactly as Huldricksson had been!</p>

<p>"You will have to cut me loose, sair," he said. "I cannot move
them. It is an old trick on these seas. Sometimes it is necessary
that a man stand at the wheel many hours without help, and he
does this so that if he sleep the wheel wake him, yes, sair."</p>

<p>I looked from him to the man on the bed.</p>

<p>"But why, sair," said Da Costa slowly, "did Olaf have to tie
his hands?"</p>

<p>I looked at him, uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I answered. "Do you?"</p>

<p>He fidgeted, avoided my eyes, and then rapidly, almost
surreptitiously crossed himself.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "I know nothing. Some things I have
heard&mdash;but they tell many tales on these seas."</p>

<p>He started for the door. Before he reached it he turned. "But
this I do know," he half whispered, "I am damned glad there is no
full moon tonight." And passed out, leaving me staring after him
in amazement. What did the Portuguese know?</p>

<p>I bent over the sleeper. On his face was no trace of that
unholy mingling of opposites the Dweller stamped upon its
victims.</p>

<p>And yet&mdash;what was it the Norseman had said?</p>

<p>"The sparkling devil took them!" Nay, he had been even more
explicit &mdash;"The sparkling devil that came down from the
moon!"</p>

<p>Could it be that the Dweller had swept upon the Brunhilda,
drawing down the moon path Olaf Huldricksson's wife and babe even
as it had drawn Throckmartin?</p>

<p>As I sat thinking the cabin grew suddenly dark and from above
came a shouting and patter of feet. Down upon us swept one of the
abrupt, violent squalls that are met with in those latitudes. I
lashed Huldricksson fast in the berth and ran up on deck.</p>

<p>The long, peaceful swells had changed into angry, choppy waves
from the tops of which the spindrift streamed in long stinging
lashes.</p>

<p>A half-hour passed; the squall died as quickly as it had
arisen. The sea quieted. Over in the west, from beneath the
tattered, flying edge of the storm, dropped the red globe of the
setting sun; dropped slowly until it touched the sea rim.</p>

<p>I watched it&mdash;and rubbed my eyes and stared again. For
over its flaming portal something huge and black moved, like a
gigantic beckoning finger!</p>

<p>Da Costa had seen it, too, and he turned the Suwarna straight
toward the descending orb and its strange shadow. As we
approached we saw it was a little mass of wreckage and that the
beckoning finger was a wing of canvas, sticking up and swaying
with the motion of the waves. On the highest point of the
wreckage sat a tall figure calmly smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>We brought the Suwarna to, dropped a boat, and with myself as
coxswain pulled toward a wrecked hydroairplane. Its occupant took
a long puff at his cigarette, waved a cheerful hand, shouted a
greeting. And just as he did so a great wave raised itself up
behind him, took the wreckage, tossed it high in a swelter of
foam, and passed on. When we had steadied our boat, where wreck
and man had been was&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>There came a tug at the side&mdash;, two muscular brown hands
gripped it close to my left, and a sleek, black, wet head showed
its top between them. Two bright, blue eyes that held deep within
them a laughing deviltry looked into mine, and a long, lithe body
drew itself gently over the thwart and seated its dripping self
at my feet.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," said this man from the sea. "I knew somebody
was sure to come along when the O'Keefe <a title= "a female
spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing, a
death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a> didn't show up."</p>

<p>"The what?" I asked in amazement.</p>

<p>"The O'Keefe <a title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore
believed to presage, by wailing, a death in a family">
<i>banshee</i></a>&mdash;I'm Larry O'Keefe. It's a far way from
Ireland, but not too far for the O'Keefe <a title= "a female
spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing, a
death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a> to travel if the O'Keefe
was going to click in."</p>

<p>I looked again at my astonishing rescue. He seemed perfectly
serious.</p>

<p>"Have you a cigarette? Mine went out," he said with a grin, as
he reached a moist hand out for the little cylinder, took it,
lighted it.</p>

<p>I saw a lean, intelligent face whose fighting jaw was softened
by the wistfulness of the clean-cut lips and the honesty that lay
side by side with the deviltry in the laughing blue eyes; nose of
a thoroughbred with the suspicion of a tilt; long, well-knit,
slender figure that I knew must have all the strength of fine
steel; the uniform of a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps of
Britain's navy.</p>

<p>He laughed, stretched out a firm hand, and gripped mine.</p>

<p>"Thank you really ever so much, old man," he said.</p>

<p>I liked Larry O'Keefe from the beginning&mdash;but I did not
dream as the Tonga boys pulled us back to the Suwarna how that
liking was to be forged into man's strong love for man by fires
which souls such as his and mine &mdash;and yours who read
this&mdash;could never dream.</p>

<p>Larry! Larry O'Keefe, where are you now with your <a title= "a
race of elves in Irish folklore who can reveal hidden treasure to
those who catch them"> <i>leprechauns</i></a> and <a title=
"female spirits in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by
wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshees</i></a>, your heart of
a child, your laughing blue eyes, and your fearless soul? Shall I
ever see you again, Larry O'Keefe, dear to me as some best
beloved younger brother? Larry!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7"></a>7. &mdash; LARRY O'KEEFE</h2>

<p class="first">Pressing back the questions I longed to ask, I
introduced myself. Oddly enough, I found that he knew me, or
rather my work. He had bought, it appeared, my volume upon the
peculiar vegetation whose habitat is disintegrating lava rock and
volcanic ash, that I had entitled, somewhat loosely, I could now
perceive, <i>Flora Of The Craters</i>. For he explained naively
that he had picked it up, thinking it an entirely different sort
of a book, a novel in fact&mdash;something like Meredith's Diana
of the Crossways, which he liked greatly.</p>

<p>He had hardly finished this explanation when we touched the
side of the Suwarna, and I was forced to curb my curiosity until
we reached the deck.</p>

<p>"That thing you saw me sitting on," he said, after he had
thanked the bowing little skipper for his rescue, "was all that
was left of one of his Majesty's best little hydroairplanes after
that cyclone threw it off as excess baggage. And by the way,
about where are we?"</p>

<p>Da Costa gave him our approximate position from the noon
reckoning.</p>

<p>O'Keefe whistled. "A good three hundred miles from where I
left the H.M.S. Dolphin about four hours ago," he said. "That
squall I rode in on was some whizzer!</p>

<p>"The Dolphin," he went on, calmly divesting himself of his
soaked uniform, "was on her way to Melbourne. I'd been yearning
for a joy ride and went up for an alleged scouting trip. Then
that blow shot out of nowhere, picked me up, and insisted that I
go with it.</p>

<p>"About an hour ago I thought I saw a chance to zoom up and out
of it, I turned, and <i>blink</i> went my right wing, and down I
dropped."</p>

<p>"I don't know how we can notify your ship, Lieutenant
O'Keefe," I said. "We have no wireless."</p>

<p>"Doctair Goodwin," said Da Costa, "we could change our course,
sair &mdash;perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks&mdash;but not a bit of it," broke in O'Keefe. "Lord
alone knows where the Dolphin is now. Fancy she'll be nosing
around looking for me. Anyway, she's just as apt to run into you
as you into her. Maybe we'll strike something with a wireless,
and I'll trouble you to put me aboard." He hesitated. "Where are
you bound, by the way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For Ponape," I answered.</p>

<p>"No wireless there," mused O'Keefe. "Beastly hole. Stopped a
week ago for fruit. Natives seemed scared to death at us&mdash;or
something. What are you going there for?"</p>

<p>Da Costa darted a furtive glance at me. It troubled me.</p>

<p>O'Keefe noted my hesitation.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," he said. "Maybe I oughn't to have
asked that?"</p>

<p>"It's no secret, Lieutenant," I replied. "I'm about to
undertake some exploration work&mdash;a little digging among the
ruins on the Nan-Matal."</p>

<p>I looked at the Portuguese sharply as I named the place. A
pallor crept beneath his skin and again he made swiftly the sign
of the cross, glancing as he did so fearfully to the north. I
made up my mind then to question him when opportunity came. He
turned from his quick scrutiny of the sea and addressed
O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"There's nothing on board to fit you, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Oh, just give me a sheet to throw around me, Captain," said
O'Keefe and followed him. Darkness had fallen, and as the two
disappeared into Da Costa's cabin I softly opened the door of my
own and listened. Huldricksson was breathing deeply and
regularly.</p>

<p>I drew my electric-flash, and shielding its rays from my face,
looked at him. His sleep was changing from the heavy stupor of
the drug into one that was at least on the borderland of the
normal. The tongue had lost its arid blackness and the mouth
secretions had resumed action. Satisfied as to his condition I
returned to deck.</p>

<p>O'Keefe was there, looking like a specter in the cotton sheet
he had wrapped about him. A deck table had been cleated down and
one of the Tonga boys was setting it for our dinner. Soon the
very creditable larder of the Suwarna dressed the board, and
O'Keefe, Da Costa, and I attacked it. The night had grown close
and oppressive. Behind us the forward light of the Brunhilda
glided and the binnacle lamp threw up a faint glow in which her
black helmsman's face stood out mistily. O'Keefe had looked
curiously a number of times at our tow, but had asked no
questions.</p>

<p>"You're not the only passenger we picked up today," I told
him. "We found the captain of that sloop, lashed to his wheel,
nearly dead with exhaustion, and his boat deserted by everyone
except himself."</p>

<p>"What was the matter?" asked O'Keefe in astonishment.</p>

<p>"We don't know," I answered. "He fought us, and I had to drug
him before we could get him loose from his lashings. He's
sleeping down in my berth now. His wife and little girl ought to
have been on board, the captain here says, but&mdash;they
weren't."</p>

<p>"Wife and child gone!" exclaimed O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"From the condition of his mouth he must have been alone at
the wheel and without water at least two days and nights before
we found him," I replied. "And as for looking for anyone on these
waters after such a time&mdash;it's hopeless."</p>

<p>"That's true," said O'Keefe. "But his wife and baby! Poor,
poor devil!"</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, and then, at my solicitation, began
to tell us more of himself. He had been little more than twenty
when he had won his wings and entered the war. He had been
seriously wounded at Ypres during the third year of the struggle,
and when he recovered the war was over. Shortly after that his
mother had died. Lonely and restless, he had re-entered the Air
Service, and had remained in it ever since.</p>

<p>"And though the war's long over, I get homesick for the lark's
land with the German planes playing tunes on their machine guns
and their <a title= "anti-aircraft guns">Archies</a> tickling the
soles of my feet," he sighed. "If you're in love, love to the
limit; and if you hate, why hate like the devil and if it's a
fight you're in, get where it's hottest and fight like
hell&mdash;if you don't life's not worth the living," sighed
he.</p>

<p>I watched him as he talked, feeling my liking for him steadily
increasing. If I could but have a man like this beside me on the
path of unknown peril upon which I had set my feet I thought,
wistfully. We sat and smoked a bit, sipping the strong coffee the
Portuguese made so well.</p>

<p>Da Costa at last relieved the Cantonese at the wheel. O'Keefe
and I drew chairs up to the rail. The brighter stars shone out
dimly through a hazy sky; gleams of phosphorescence tipped the
crests of the waves and sparkled with an almost angry brilliance
as the bow of the Suwarna tossed them aside. O'Keefe pulled
contentedly at a cigarette. The glowing spark lighted the keen,
boyish face and the blue eyes, now black and brooding under the
spell of the tropic night.</p>

<p>"Are you American or Irish, O'Keefe?" I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Why?" he laughed.</p>

<p>"Because," I answered, "from your name and your service I
would suppose you Irish&mdash;but your command of pure
Americanese makes me doubtful."</p>

<p>He grinned amiably.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how that is," he said. "My mother was an
American&mdash;a Grace, of Virginia. My father was the O'Keefe,
of Coleraine. And these two loved each other so well that the
heart they gave me is half Irish and half American. My father
died when I was sixteen. I used to go to the States with my
mother every other year for a month or two. But after my father
died we used to go to Ireland every other year. And there you
are&mdash;I'm as much American as I am Irish.</p>

<p>"When I'm in love, or excited, or dreaming, or mad I have the
brogue. But for the everyday purpose of life I like the United
States talk, and I know Broadway as well as I do Binevenagh Lane,
and the Sound as well as St. Patrick's Channel; educated a bit at
Eton, a bit at Harvard; always too much money to have to make
any; in love lots of times, and never a heartache after that
wasn't a pleasant one, and never a real purpose in life until I
took the king's shilling and earned my wings; something over
thirty&mdash;and that's me&mdash;Larry O'Keefe."</p>

<p>"But it was the Irish O'Keefe who sat out there waiting for
the <a title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to
presage, by wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a>," I
laughed.</p>

<p>"It was that," he said somberly, and I heard the brogue creep
over his voice like velvet and his eyes grew brooding again.
"There's never an O'Keefe for these thousand years that has
passed without his warning. An' twice have I heard the <a title=
"a female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by
wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a>
calling&mdash;once it was when my younger brother died an' once
when my father lay waiting to be carried out on the ebb
tide."</p>

<p>He mused a moment, then went on: "An' once I saw an <a title=
"Gaelic: wood nymph"><i>annir choille</i></a>, a girl of the
green people, flit like a shade of green fire through Carntogher
woods, an' once at Dunchraig I slept where the ashes of the Dun
of Cormac MacConcobar are mixed with those of Cormac an' Eilidh
the Fair, all burned in the nine flames that sprang from the
harping of Cravetheen, an' I heard the echo of his dead
harpings&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused again and then, softly, with that curiously sweet,
high voice that only the Irish seem to have, he sang:</p>

<p class="poem">Woman of the white breasts, Eilidh;<br> Woman of
the gold-brown hair, and lips of the red, red rowan,<br> Where is
the swan that is whiter, with breast more soft,<br> Or the wave
on the sea that moves as thou movest, Eilidh.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8"></a>8. &mdash; OLAF'S STORY</h2>

<p class="first">There was a little silence. I looked upon him
with wonder. Clearly he was in deepest earnest. I know the
psychology of the Gael is a curious one and that deep in all
their hearts their ancient traditions and beliefs have strong and
living roots. And I was both amused and touched.</p>

<p>Here was this soldier, who had faced war and its ugly
realities open-eyed and fearless, picking, indeed, the most
dangerous branch of service for his own, a modern if ever there
was one, appreciative of most unmystical Broadway, and yet
soberly and earnestly attesting to his belief in <a title= "a
female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing,
a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a>, in shadowy people of
the woods, and phantom harpers! I wondered what he would think if
he could see the Dweller and then, with a pang, that perhaps his
superstitions might make him an easy prey.</p>

<p>He shook his head half impatiently and ran a hand over his
eyes; turned to me and grinned:</p>

<p>"Don't think I'm cracked, Professor," he said. "I'm not. But
it takes me that way now and then. It's the Irish in me. And,
believe it or not, I'm telling you the truth."</p>

<p>I looked eastward where the moon, now nearly a week past the
full, was mounting.</p>

<p>"You can't make me see what you've seen, Lieutenant," I
laughed. "But you can make me hear. I've always wondered what
kind of a noise a disembodied spirit could make without any vocal
cords or breath or any other earthly sound-producing mechanism.
How does the <a title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore
believed to presage, by wailing, a death in a family">
<i>banshee</i></a> sound?"</p>

<p>O'Keefe looked at me seriously.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'll show you." From deep down in his
throat came first a low, weird sobbing that mounted steadily into
a keening whose mournfulness made my skin creep. And then his
hand shot out and gripped my shoulder, and I stiffened like stone
in my chair&mdash;for from behind us, like an echo, and then
taking up the cry, swelled a wail that seemed to hold within it a
sublimation of the sorrows of centuries! It gathered itself into
one heartbroken, sobbing note and died away! O'Keefe's grip
loosened, and he rose swiftly to his feet.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Professor," he said. "It's for me. It found
me&mdash; all this way from Ireland."</p>

<p>Again the silence was rent by the cry. But now I had located
it. It came from my room, and it could mean only one
thing&mdash;Huldricksson had wakened.</p>

<p>"Forget your <a title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore
believed to presage, by wailing, a death in a family">
<i>banshee</i></a>!" I gasped, and made a jump for the cabin.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of my eye I noted a look of half-sheepish
relief flit over O'Keefe's face, and then he was beside me. Da
Costa shouted an order from the wheel, the Cantonese ran up and
took it from his hands and the little Portuguese pattered down
toward us. My hand on the door, ready to throw it open, I
stopped. What if the Dweller were within&mdash;what if we had
been wrong and it was not dependent for its power upon that full
flood of moon ray which Throckmartin had thought essential to
draw it from the blue pool!</p>

<p>From within, the sobbing wail began once more to rise. O'Keefe
pushed me aside, threw open the door and crouched low within it.
I saw an automatic flash dully in his hand; saw it cover the
cabin from side to side, following the swift sweep of his eyes
around it. Then he straightened and his face, turned toward the
berth, was filled with wondering pity.</p>

<p>Through the window streamed a shaft of the moonlight. It fell
upon Huldricksson's staring eyes; in them great tears slowly
gathered and rolled down his cheeks; from his opened mouth came
the woe-laden wailing. I ran to the port and drew the curtains.
Da Costa snapped the lights.</p>

<p>The Norseman's dolorous crying stopped as abruptly as though
cut. His gaze rolled toward us. And at one bound he broke through
the leashes I had buckled round him and faced us, his eyes
glaring, his yellow hair almost erect with the force of the rage
visibly surging through him. Da Costa shrunk behind me. O'Keefe,
coolly watchful, took a quick step that brought him in front of
me.</p>

<p>"Where do you take me?" said Huldricksson, and his voice was
like the growl of a beast. "Where is my boat?"</p>

<p>I touched O'Keefe gently and stood before the giant.</p>

<p>"Listen, Olaf Huldricksson," I said. "We take you to where the
sparkling devil took your Helma and your Freda. We follow the
sparkling devil that came down from the moon. Do you hear me?" I
spoke slowly, distinctly, striving to pierce the mists that I
knew swirled around the strained brain. And the words did
pierce.</p>

<p>He thrust out a shaking hand.</p>

<p>"You say you follow?" he asked falteringly. "You know where to
follow? Where it took my Helma and my little Freda?"</p>

<p>"Just that, Olaf Huldricksson," I answered. "Just that! I
pledge you my life that I know."</p>

<p>Da Costa stepped forward. "He speaks true, Olaf. You go faster
on the Suwarna than on the Br-rw-un'ilda, Olaf, yes."</p>

<p>The giant Norseman, still gripping my hand, looked at him. "I
know you, Da Costa," he muttered. "You are all right. <i>Ja</i>!
You are a fair man. Where is the Brunhilda?"</p>

<p>"She follow be'ind on a big rope, Olaf," soothed the
Portuguese. "Soon you see her. But now lie down an' tell us, if
you can, why you tie yourself to your wheel an' what it is that
happen, Olaf."</p>

<p>"If you'll tell us how the sparkling devil came it will help
us all when we get to where it is, Huldricksson," I said.</p>

<p>On O'Keefe's face there was an expression of well-nigh
ludicrous doubt and amazement. He glanced from one to the other.
The giant shifted his own tense look from me to the Irishman. A
gleam of approval lighted in his eyes. He loosed me, and gripped
O'Keefe's arm. <a title= "Norwegian: strong; Merritt uses the
Danish word staerk"><i>"Sterk!"</i></a> he said.
"<i>Ja</i>&mdash;strong, and with a strong heart. A man&mdash;
<i>ja!</i> He comes too&mdash;we shall need
him&mdash;<i>ja!"</i></p>

<p>"I tell," he muttered, and seated himself on the side of the
bunk. "It was four nights ago. My Freda"&mdash;his voice
shook&mdash;"<a title= "Norwegian and Danish: my darling"><i>Mine
yndling!</i></a> She loved the moonlight. I was at the wheel and
my Freda and my Helma they were behind me. The moon was behind us
and the Brunhilda was like a swan-boat sailing down with the
moonlight sending her, <i>ja</i>.</p>

<p>"I heard my Freda say: 'I see a <a title= "Norwegian and
Danish: a mythical creature of Scandinavian folklore, believed to
take care of a farmer's home and barn and protect it from
misfortune, in particular at night, when the housefolk were
asleep"> <i>nisse</i></a> coming down the track of the moon. And
I hear her mother laugh, low, like a mother does when her <a
title= "Norwegian and Danish: darling"><i>yndling</i></a> dreams.
I was happy &mdash;that night&mdash;with my Helma and my Freda,
and the Brunhilda sailing like a swan-boat, <i>ja</i>. I heard
the child say, 'The <i>nisse</i> comes fast! And then I heard a
scream from my Helma, a great scream&mdash; like a mare when her
foal is torn from her. I spun around fast, <i>ja!</i> I dropped
the wheel and spun fast! I saw&mdash;" He covered his eyes with
his hands.</p>

<p>The Portuguese had crept close to me, and I heard him panting
like a frightened dog.</p>

<p>"I saw a white fire spring over the rail," whispered Olaf
Huldricksson. "It whirled round and round, and it shone
like&mdash;like stars in a whirlwind mist. There was a noise in
my ears. It sounded like bells&mdash; little bells, <i>ja</i>!
Like the music you make when you run your finger round goblets.
It made me sick and dizzy&mdash;the hell noise.</p>

<p>"My Helma was&mdash;<a title= "Norwegian: in the middle;
Merritt uses the Danish expression indeholde"><i>på
midten</i></a>&mdash;what you say&mdash;in the middle of the
white fire. She turned her face to me and she turned it on the
child, and my Helma's face burned into my heart. Because it was
full of fear, and it was full of happiness&mdash;of <a title=
"Norwegian: joy, happiness; Merritt uses the Danish word
glaede"><i>glede</i></a>. I tell you that the fear in my Helma's
face made me ice here"&mdash;he beat his breast with clenched
hand&mdash;"but the happiness in it burned on me like fire. And I
could not move&mdash;I could not move.</p>

<p>"I said in here"&mdash;he touched his head&mdash;"I said, 'It
is Loki come out of <a title= "Norwegian: hell; Merritt uses the
Danish word helvede"><i>helvete</i></a>. But he cannot take my
Helma, for Christ lives and Loki has no power to hurt my Helma or
my Freda! Christ lives! Christ lives!' I said. But the sparkling
devil did not let my Helma go. It drew her to the rail; half over
it. I saw her eyes upon the child and a little she broke away and
reached to it. And my Freda jumped into her arms. And the fire
wrapped them both and they were gone! A little I saw them
whirling on the moon track behind the Brunhilda &mdash;and they
were gone!</p>

<p>"The sparkling devil took them! Loki was loosed, and he had
power. I turned the Brunhilda, and I followed where my Helma and
<a title= "Norwegian and Danish: my darling"><i>mine
yndling</i></a> had gone. My boys crept up and asked me to turn
again. But I would not. They dropped a boat and left me. I
steered straight on the path. I lashed my hands to the wheel that
sleep might not loose them. I steered on and on and on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where was the God I prayed when my wife and child were
taken?" cried Olaf Huldricksson&mdash;and it was as though I
heard Throckmartin asking that same bitter question. "I have left
Him as He left me, <i>ja</i>! I pray now to Thor and to Odin, who
can fetter Loki." He sank back, covering again his eyes.</p>

<p>"Olaf," I said, "what you have called the sparkling devil has
taken ones dear to me. I, too, was following it when we found
you. You shall go with me to its home, and there we will try to
take from it your wife and your child and my friends as well. But
now that you may be strong for what is before us, you must sleep
again."</p>

<p>Olaf Huldricksson looked upon me and in his eyes was that
something which souls must see in the eyes of Him the old
Egyptians called the Searcher of Hearts in the Judgment Hall of
Osiris.</p>

<p>"You speak truth!" he said at last slowly. "I will do what you
say!"</p>

<p>He stretched out an arm at my bidding. I gave him a second
injection. He lay back and soon he was sleeping. I turned toward
Da Costa. His face was livid and sweating, and he was trembling
pitiably. O'Keefe stirred.</p>

<p>"You did that mighty well, Dr. Goodwin," he said. "So well
that I almost believed you myself."</p>

<p>"What did you think of his story, Mr. O'Keefe?" I asked.</p>

<p>His answer was almost painfully brief and colloquial.</p>

<p>"Nuts!" he said. I was a little shocked, I admit. "I think
he's crazy, Dr. Goodwin," he corrected himself, quickly. "What
else could I think?"</p>

<p>I turned to the little Portuguese without answering.</p>

<p>"There's no need for any anxiety tonight, Captain," I said.
"Take my word for it. You need some rest yourself. Shall I give
you a sleeping draft?"</p>

<p>"I do wish you would, Dr. Goodwin, sair," he answered
gratefully. "Tomorrow, when I feel bettair&mdash;I would have a
talk with you."</p>

<p>I nodded. He did know something then! I mixed him an opiate of
considerable strength. He took it and went to his own cabin.</p>

<p>I locked the door behind him and then, sitting beside the
sleeping Norseman, I told O'Keefe my story from end to end. He
asked few questions as I spoke. But after I had finished he
cross-examined me rather minutely upon my recollections of the
radiant phases upon each appearance, checking these with
Throckmartin's observations of the same phenomena in the Chamber
of the Moon Pool.</p>

<p>"And now what do you think of it all?" I asked.</p>

<p>He sat silent for a while, looking at Huldricksson.</p>

<p>"Not what you seem to think, Dr. Goodwin," he answered at
last, gravely. "Let me sleep over it. One thing of course is
certain&mdash;you and your friend Throckmartin and this man here
saw&mdash;something. But&mdash;" he was silent again and then
continued with a kindness that I found vaguely
irritating&mdash;"but I've noticed that when a scientist gets
superstitious it&mdash;er&mdash;takes very hard!</p>

<p>"Here's a few things I can tell you now though," he went on
while I struggled to speak&mdash;"I pray in my heart that we'll
meet neither the Dolphin nor anything with wireless on board
going up. Because, Dr. Goodwin, I'd dearly love to take a crack
at your Dweller.</p>

<p>"And another thing," said O'Keefe. "After this&mdash;cut out
the trimmings, Doc, and call me plain Larry, for whether I think
you're crazy or whether I don't, you're there with the nerve,
Professor, and I'm for <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>"Good night!" said Larry and took himself out to the deck
hammock he had insisted upon having slung for him, refusing the
captain's importunities to use his own cabin.</p>

<p>And it was with extremely mixed emotions as to his compliment
that I watched him go. Superstitious. I, whose pride was my
scientific devotion to fact and fact alone!
Superstitious&mdash;and this from a man who believed in <a title=
"female spirits in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by
wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshees</i></a> and ghostly
harpers and Irish wood nymphs and no doubt in <a title= "a race
of elves in Irish folklore who can reveal hidden treasure to
those who catch them"> <i>leprechauns</i></a> and all their
tribe!</p>

<p>Half laughing, half irritated, and wholly happy in even the
part promise of Larry O'Keefe's comradeship on my venture, I
arranged a couple of pillows, stretched myself out on two chairs
and took up my vigil beside Olaf Huldricksson.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9"></a>9. &mdash; A LOST PAGE OF
EARTH</h2>

<p class="first">When I awakened the sun was streaming through
the cabin porthole. Outside a fresh voice lilted. I lay on my two
chairs and listened. The song was one with the wholesome sunshine
and the breeze blowing stiffly and whipping the curtains. It was
Larry O'Keefe at his matins:</p>

<p class="poem">The little red lark is shaking his wings,<br>
Straight from the breast of his love he springs</p>

<p>Larry's voice soared.</p>

<p class="poem">His wings and his feathers are sunrise red,<br>
He hails the sun and his golden head,<br> Good morning, Doc, you
are long abed.</p>

<p>This last was a most irreverent interpolation, I well knew. I
opened my door. O'Keefe stood outside laughing. The Suwarna, her
engines silent, was making fine headway under all sail, the
Brunhilda skipping in her wake cheerfully with half her canvas
up.</p>

<p>The sea was crisping and dimpling under the wind. Blue and
white was the world as far as the eye could reach. Schools of
little silvery green flying fish broke through the water rushing
on each side of us; flashed for an instant and were gone. Behind
us gulls hovered and dipped. The shadow of mystery had retreated
far over the rim of this wide awake and beautiful world and if,
subconsciously, I knew that somewhere it was brooding and
waiting, for a little while at least I was consciously free of
its oppression.</p>

<p>"How's the patient?" asked O'Keefe.</p>

<p>He was answered by Huldricksson himself, who must have risen
just as I left the cabin. The Norseman had slipped on a pair of
pajamas and, giant torso naked under the sun, he strode out upon
us. We all of us looked at him a trifle anxiously. But Olaf's
madness had left him. In his eyes was much sorrow, but the
berserk rage was gone.</p>

<p>He spoke straight to me: "You said last night we follow?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"It is where?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"We go first to Ponape and from there to Metalanim
Harbor&mdash;to the Nan-Matal. You know the place?"</p>

<p>Huldricksson bowed&mdash;a white gleam as of ice showing in
his blue eyes.</p>

<p>"It is there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It is there that we must first search," I answered.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Olaf Huldricksson. "It is good!"</p>

<p>He looked at Da Costa inquiringly and the little Portuguese,
following his thought, answered his unspoken question.</p>

<p>"We should be at Ponape tomorrow morning early, Olaf."</p>

<p>"Good!" repeated the Norseman. He looked away, his eyes
tear-filled.</p>

<p>A restraint fell upon us; the embarrassment all men experience
when they feel a great sympathy and a great pity, to neither of
which they quite know how to give expression. By silent consent
we discussed at breakfast only the most casual topics.</p>

<p>When the meal was over Huldricksson expressed a desire to go
aboard the Brunhilda.</p>

<p>The Suwarna hove to and Da Costa and he dropped into the small
boat. When they reached the Brunhilda's deck I saw Olaf take the
wheel and the two fall into earnest talk. I beckoned to O'Keefe
and we stretched ourselves out on the bow hatch under cover of
the foresail. He lighted a cigarette, took a couple of leisurely
puffs, and looked at me expectantly.</p>

<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," said O'Keefe, "suppose you tell me what you
think&mdash;and then I'll proceed to point out your scientific
errors." His eyes twinkled mischievously.</p>

<p>"Larry," I replied, somewhat severely, "you may not know that
I have a scientific reputation which, putting aside all modesty,
I may say is an enviable one. You used a word last night to which
I must interpose serious objection. You more than hinted that I
hid&mdash;superstitions. Let me inform you, Larry O'Keefe, that I
am solely a seeker, observer, analyst, and synthesist of facts. I
am not"&mdash;and I tried to make my tone as pointed as my
words&mdash;"I am not a believer in phantoms or spooks, <a title=
"a race of elves in Irish folklore who can reveal hidden treasure
to those who catch them"> <i>leprechauns</i></a>, <a title=
"female spirits in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by
wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshees</i></a>s, or ghostly
harpers."</p>

<p>O'Keefe leaned back and shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Goodwin," he gasped. "But if you could have seen
yourself solemnly disclaiming the <a title= "a female spirit in
Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing, a death in a
family"> <i>banshee</i></a>"&mdash;another twinkle showed in his
eyes&mdash;"and then with all this sunshine and this wide-open
world"&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"it's hard to
visualize anything such as you and Huldricksson have
described."</p>

<p>"I know how hard it is, Larry," I answered. "And don't think I
have any idea that the phenomenon is supernatural in the sense
spiritualists and table turners have given that word. I do think
it is supernormal; energized by a force unknown to modern
science&mdash;but that doesn't mean I think it outside the radius
of science."</p>

<p>"Tell me your theory, Goodwin," he said. I hesitated&mdash;for
not yet had I been able to put into form to satisfy myself any
explanation of the Dweller.</p>

<p>"I think," I hazarded finally, "it is possible that some
members of that race peopling the ancient continent which we know
existed here in the Pacific, have survived. We know that many of
these islands are honeycombed with caverns and vast subterranean
spaces, literally underground lands running in some cases far out
beneath the ocean floor. It is possible that for some reason
survivors of this race sought refuge in the abysmal spaces, one
of whose entrances is on the islet where Throckmartin's party met
its end.</p>

<p>"As for their persistence in these caverns&mdash;we know they
possessed a high science. They may have gone far in the mastery
of certain universal forms of energy&mdash;especially that we
call light. They may have developed a civilization and a science
far more advanced than ours. What I call the Dweller may be one
of the results of this science. Larry&mdash;it may well be that
this lost race is planning to emerge again upon earth's
surface!"</p>

<p>"And is sending out your Dweller as a messenger, a scientific
dove from their Ark?" I chose to overlook the banter in his
question.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of the Chamats?" I asked him. He shook his
head.</p>

<p>"In Papua," I explained, "there is a wide-spread and
immeasurably old tradition that 'imprisoned under the hills' is a
race of giants who once ruled this region 'when it stretched from
sun to sun before the moon god drew the waters over it'&mdash;I
quote from the legend. Not only in Papua but throughout Malaysia
you find this story. And, so the tradition runs, these
people&mdash;the Chamats&mdash;will one day break through the
hills and rule the world; 'make over the world' is the literal
translation of the constant phrase in the tale. It was Herbert
Spencer who pointed out that there is a basis of fact in every
myth and legend of man. It is possible that these survivors I am
discussing form Spencer's fact basis for the Malaysian
legend.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ * William Beebe, the famous American
naturalist and ornithologist, recently fighting in France with
America's air force, called attention to this remarkable belief
in an article printed not long ago in the Atlantic Monthly. Still
more significant was it that he noted a persistent rumor that the
breaking out of the buried race was close.&mdash;W.J.B., Pres. I.
A. of S. ]</p>

<p>"This much is sure&mdash;the moon door, which is clearly
operated by the action of moon rays upon some unknown element or
combination and the crystals through which the moon rays pour
down upon the pool their prismatic columns, are humanly made
mechanisms. So long as they are humanly made, and so long as it
<i>is</i> this flood of moonlight from which the Dweller draws
its power of materialization, the Dweller itself, if not the
product of the human mind, is at least dependent upon the product
of the human mind for its appearance."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Goodwin," interrupted O'Keefe. "Do you mean to
say you think that this thing is made of&mdash;well&mdash;of
moonshine?"</p>

<p>"Moonlight," I replied, "is, of course, reflected sunlight.
But the rays which pass back to earth after their impact on the
moon's surface are profoundly changed. The spectroscope shows
that they lose practically all the slower vibrations we call red
and infra-red, while the extremely rapid vibrations we call the
violet and ultra-violet are accelerated and altered. Many
scientists hold that there is an unknown element in the
moon&mdash; perhaps that which makes the gigantic luminous trails
that radiate in all directions from the lunar crater
Tycho&mdash;whose energies are absorbed by and carried on the
moon rays.</p>

<p>"At any rate, whether by the loss of the vibrations of the red
or by the addition of this mysterious force, the light of the
moon becomes something entirely different from mere modified
sunlight&mdash;just as the addition or subtraction of one other
chemical in a compound of several makes the product a substance
with entirely different energies and potentialities.</p>

<p>"Now these rays, Larry, are given perhaps still another
mysterious activity by the globes through which Throckmartin said
they passed in the Chamber of the Moon Pool. The result is the
necessary factor in the formation of the Dweller. There would be
nothing scientifically improbable in such a process. Kubalski,
the great Russian physicist, produced crystalline forms
exhibiting every faculty that we call vital by subjecting certain
combinations of chemicals to the action of highly concentrated
rays of various colors. Something in light and nothing else
produced their pseudo-vitality. We do not begin to know how to
harness the potentialities of that magnetic vibration of the
ether we call light."</p>

<p>"Listen, Doc," said Larry earnestly, "I'll take everything you
say about this lost continent, the people who used to live on it,
and their caverns, for granted. But by the sword of <a title=
"Irish king (1002-1014) who spent most of his life fighting the
Danes and the Norse. He was killed after the final defeat of a
Danish coalition, which ended Norse power in Ireland."> Brian
Boru</a>, you'll never get me to fall for the idea that a bunch
of moonshine can handle a big woman such as you say
Throckmartin's Thora was, nor a two-fisted man such as you say
Throckmartin was, nor Huldricksson's wife&mdash;and I'll bet she
was one of those strapping big northern women too&mdash;you'll
never get me to believe that any bunch of concentrated moonshine
could handle them and take them waltzing off along a moon-beam
back to wherever it goes. No, Doc, not on your life, even
Tennessee moonshine couldn't do that&mdash;nix!"</p>

<p>"All right, O'Keefe," I answered, now very much irritated
indeed. "What's your theory?" And I could not resist adding:
"Fairies?"</p>

<p>"Professor," he grinned, "if that Thing's a fairy it's Irish
and when it sees me it'll be so glad there'll be nothing to it.
'I was lost, strayed, or stolen, Larry <a title="Irish: my son,
my lad, my boy"><i>avick</i></a>, it'll say, 'an' I was so
homesick for the old sod I was desp'rit, it'll say, an' 'take me
back quick before I do any more har-rm! it'll tell me&mdash; an'
that's the truth.</p>

<p>"Now don't get me wrong. I believe you all saw something all
right. But what I think you saw was some kind of gas. All this
region is volcanic and islands and things are constantly poking
up from the sea. It's probably gas; a volcanic emanation;
something new to us and that drives you crazy&mdash; lots of
kinds of gas do that. It hit the Throckmartin party on that
island and they probably were all more or less delirious all the
time; thought they saw things; talked it over
and&mdash;collective hallucination&mdash;just like the Angels of
Mons and other miracles of the war. Somebody sees something that
looks like something else. He points it out to the man next him.
'Do you see it?' asks he. 'Sure I see it, says the other. And
there you are&mdash;collective hallucination.</p>

<p>"When your friends got it bad they most likely jumped
overboard one by one. Huldricksson sails into a place where it is
and it hits his wife. She grabs the child and jumps over. Maybe
the moon rays make it luminous! I've seen gas on the front under
the moon that looked like a thousand whirling dervish devils.
Yes, and you could see the devil's faces in it. And if it got
into your lungs nothing could ever make you think you hadn't seen
real devils."</p>

<p>For a time I was silent.</p>

<p>"Larry," I said at last, "whether you are right or I am right,
I must go to the Nan-Matal. Will you go with me, Larry?"</p>

<p>"Goodwin," he replied, "I surely will. I'm as interested as
you are. If we don't run across the Dolphin I'll stick. I'll
leave word at Ponape, to tell them where I am should they come
along. If they report me dead for a while there's nobody to care.
So that's all right. Only old man, be reasonable. You've thought
over this so long, you're going bug, honestly you are."</p>

<p>And again, the gladness that I might have Larry O'Keefe with
me, was so great that I forgot to be angry.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>10. &mdash; THE MOON
POOL</h2>

<p class="first">Da Costa, who had come aboard unnoticed by
either of us, now tapped me on the arm.</p>

<p>"Doctair Goodwin," he said, "can I see you in my cabin,
sair?"</p>

<p>At last, then, he was going to speak. I followed him.</p>

<p>"Doctair," he said, when we had entered, "this is a veree
strange thing that has happened to Olaf. Veree strange. An' the
natives of Ponape, they have been very much excite' lately.</p>

<p>"Of what they fear I know nothing, nothing!" Again that quick,
furtive crossing of himself. "But this I have to tell you. There
came to me from Ranaloa last month a man, a Russian, a doctair,
like you. His name it was Marakinoff. I take him to Ponape an'
the natives there they will not take him to the Nan-Matal where
he wish to go&mdash;no! So I take him. We leave in a boat, wit'
much instrument carefully tied up. I leave him there wit' the
boat an' the food. He tell me to tell no one an' pay me not to.
But you are a friend an' Olaf he depend much upon you an' so I
tell you, sair."</p>

<p>"You know nothing more than this, Da Costa?" I asked. "Nothing
of another expedition?"</p>

<p>"No," he shook his head vehemently. "Nothing more."</p>

<p>"Hear the name Throckmartin while you were there?" I
persisted.</p>

<p>"No," his eyes were steady as he answered but the pallor had
crept again into his face.</p>

<p>I was not so sure. But if he knew more than he had told me why
was he afraid to speak? My anxiety deepened and later I sought
relief from it by repeating the conversation to O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"A Russian, eh," he said. "Well, they can be damned nice, or
damned &mdash;otherwise. Considering what you did for me, I hope
I can look him over before the Dolphin shows up."</p>

<p>Next morning we raised Ponape, without further incident, and
before noon the Suwarna and the Brunhilda had dropped anchor in
the harbor. Upon the excitement and manifest dread of the
natives, when we sought among them for carriers and workmen to
accompany us, I will not dwell. It is enough to say that no
payment we offered could induce a single one of them to go to the
Nan-Matal. Nor would they say why.</p>

<p>Finally it was agreed that the Brunhilda should be left in
charge of a half-breed Chinaman, whom both Da Costa and
Huldricksson knew and trusted. We piled her long-boat up with my
instruments and food and camping equipment. The Suwarna took us
around to Metalanim Harbor, and there, with the tops of ancient
sea walls deep in the blue water beneath us, and the ruins
looming up out of the mangroves, a scant mile from us, left
us.</p>

<p>Then with Huldricksson manipulating our small sail, and Larry
at the rudder, we rounded the titanic wall that swept down into
the depths, and turned at last into the canal that Throckmartin,
on his map, had marked as that which, running between frowning
Nan-Tauach and its satellite islet, Tau, led straight to the gate
of the place of ancient mysteries.</p>

<p>And as we entered that channel we were enveloped by a silence;
a silence so intense, so&mdash;weighted that it seemed to have
substance; an alien silence that clung and stifled and still
stood aloof from us&mdash;the living. It was a stillness, such as
might follow the long tramping of millions into the grave; it
was&mdash;paradoxical as it may be&mdash; filled with the
withdrawal of life.</p>

<p>Standing down in the chambered depths of the Great Pyramid I
had known something of such silence&mdash;but never such
intensity as this. Larry felt it and I saw him look at me
askance. If Olaf, sitting in the bow, felt it, too, he gave no
sign; his blue eyes, with again the glint of ice within them,
watched the channel before us.</p>

<p>As we passed, there arose upon our left sheer walls of black
basalt blocks, cyclopean, towering fifty feet or more, broken
here and there by the sinking of their deep foundations.</p>

<p>In front of us the mangroves widened out and filled the canal.
On our right the lesser walls of Tau, sombre blocks smoothed and
squared and set with a cold, mathematical nicety that filled me
with vague awe, slipped by. Through breaks I caught glimpses of
dark ruins and of great fallen stones that seemed to crouch and
menace us, as we passed. Somewhere there, hidden, were the seven
globes that poured the moon fire down upon the Moon Pool.</p>

<p>Now we were among the mangroves and, sail down, the three of
us pushed and pulled the boat through their tangled roots and
branches. The noise of our passing split the silence like a
profanation, and from the ancient bastions came
murmurs&mdash;forbidding, strangely sinister. And now we were
through, floating on a little open space of shadow-filled water.
Before us lifted the gateway of Nan-Tauach, gigantic, broken,
incredibly old; shattered portals through which had passed men
and women of earth's dawn; old with a weight of years that
pressed leadenly upon the eyes that looked upon it, and yet was
in some curious indefinable way&mdash;menacingly defiant.</p>

<p>Beyond the gate, back from the portals, stretched a flight of
enormous basalt slabs, a giant's stairway indeed; and from each
side of it marched the high walls that were the Dweller's
pathway. None of us spoke as we grounded the boat and dragged it
upon a half-submerged pier. And when we did speak it was in
whispers.</p>

<p>"What next?" asked Larry.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to take a look around," I replied in the
same low tones. "We'll climb the wall here and take a flash
about. The whole place ought to be plain as day from that
height."</p>

<p>Huldricksson, his blue eyes alert, nodded. With the greatest
difficulty we clambered up the broken blocks.</p>

<p>To the east and south of us, set like children's blocks in the
midst of the sapphire sea, lay dozens of islets, none of them
covering more than two square miles of surface; each of them a
perfect square or oblong within its protecting walls.</p>

<p>On none was there sign of life, save for a few great birds
that hovered here and there, and gulls dipping in the blue waves
beyond.</p>

<p>We turned our gaze down upon the island on which we stood. It
was, I estimated, about three-quarters of a mile square. The sea
wall enclosed it. It was really an enormous basalt-sided open
cube, and within it two other open cubes. The enclosure between
the first and second wall was stone paved, with here and there a
broken pillar and long stone benches. The hibiscus, the aloe
tree, and a number of small shrubs had found place, but seemed
only to intensify its stark loneliness.</p>

<p>"Wonder where the Russian can be?" asked Larry.</p>

<p>I shook my head. There was no sign of life here. Had
Marakinoff gone &mdash;or had the Dweller taken him, too?
Whatever had happened, there was no trace of him below us or on
any of the islets within our range of vision. We scrambled down
the side of the gateway. Olaf looked at me wistfully.</p>

<p>"We start the search now, Olaf," I said. "And first, O'Keefe,
let us see whether the grey stone is really here. After that we
will set up camp, and while I unpack, you and Olaf search the
island. It won't take long."</p>

<p>Larry gave a look at his service automatic and grinned. "Lead
on, Macduff," he said. We made our way up the steps, through the
outer enclosures and into the central square, I confess to a fire
of scientific curiosity and eagerness tinged with a dread that
O'Keefe's analysis might be true. Would we find the moving slab
and, if so, would it be as Throckmartin had described? If so,
then even Larry would have to admit that here was something that
theories of gases and luminous emanations would not explain; and
the first test of the whole amazing story would be passed. But if
not&mdash;And there before us, the faintest tinge of grey setting
it apart from its neighboring blocks of basalt, was the moon
door!</p>

<p>There was no mistaking it. This was, in very deed, the portal
through which Throckmartin had seen pass that gloriously dreadful
apparition he called the Dweller. At its base was the curious,
seemingly polished cup-like depression within which, my lost
friend had told me, the opening door swung.</p>

<p>What was that portal&mdash;more enigmatic than was ever
sphinx? And what lay beyond it? What did that smooth stone, whose
wan deadness whispered of ages-old corridors of time opening out
into alien, unimaginable vistas, hide? It had cost the world of
science Throckmartin's great brain&mdash;as it had cost
Throckmartin those he loved. It had drawn me to it in search of
Throckmartin&mdash;and its shadow had fallen upon the soul of
Olaf the Norseman; and upon what thousands upon thousands more I
wondered, since the brains that had conceived it had vanished
with their secret knowledge?</p>

<p>What lay beyond it?</p>

<p>I stretched out a shaking hand and touched the surface of the
slab. A faint thrill passed through my hand and arm, oddly
unfamiliar and as oddly unpleasant; as of electric contact
holding the very essence of cold. O'Keefe, watching, imitated my
action. As his fingers rested on the stone his face filled with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"It's the door?" he asked. I nodded. There was a low whistle
from him and he pointed up toward the top of the grey stone. I
followed the gesture and saw, above the moon door and on each
side of it, two gently curving bosses of rock, perhaps a foot in
diameter.</p>

<p>"The moon door's keys," I said.</p>

<p>"It begins to look so," answered Larry. "If we can find them,"
he added.</p>

<p>"There's nothing we can do till moonrise," I replied. "And
we've none too much time to prepare as it is. Come!"</p>

<p>A little later we were beside our boat. We lightered it, set
up the tent, and as it was now but a short hour to sundown I bade
them leave me and make their search. They went off together, and
I busied myself with opening some of the paraphernalia I had
brought with me.</p>

<p>First of all I took out the two Becquerel ray-condensers that
I had bought in Sydney. Their lenses would collect and intensify
to the fullest extent any light directed upon them. I had found
them most useful in making spectroscopic analysis of luminous
vapors, and I knew that at Yerkes Observatory splendid results
had been obtained from them in collecting the diffused radiance
of the nebulae for the same purpose.</p>

<p>If my theory of the grey slab's mechanism were correct, it was
practically certain that with the satellite only a few nights
past the full we could concentrate enough light on the bosses to
open the rock. And as the ray streams through the seven globes
described by Throckmartin would be too weak to energize the Pool,
we could enter the chamber free from any fear of encountering its
tenant, make our preliminary observations and go forth before the
moon had dropped so far that the concentration in the condensers
would fall below that necessary to keep the portal from
closing.</p>

<p>I took out also a small spectroscope, and a few other
instruments for the analysis of certain light manifestations and
the testing of metal and liquid. Finally, I put aside my
emergency medical kit.</p>

<p>I had hardly finished examining and adjusting these before
O'Keefe and Huldricksson returned. They reported signs of a camp
at least ten days old beside the northern wall of the outer
court, but beyond that no evidence of others beyond ourselves on
Nan-Tauach.</p>

<p>We prepared supper, ate and talked a little, but for the most
part were silent. Even Larry's high spirits were not in evidence;
half a dozen times I saw him take out his automatic and look it
over. He was more thoughtful than I had ever seen him. Once he
went into the tent, rummaged about a bit and brought out another
revolver which, he said, he had got from Da Costa, and a
half-dozen clips of cartridges. He passed the gun over to Olaf.</p>

<p>At last a glow in the southeast heralded the rising moon. I
picked up my instruments and the medical kit; Larry and Olaf
shouldered each a short ladder that was part of my equipment,
and, with our electric flashes pointing the way, walked up the
great stairs, through the enclosures, and straight to the grey
stone.</p>

<p>By this time the moon had risen and its clipped light shone
full upon the slab. I saw faint gleams pass over it as of
fleeting phosphorescence&mdash; but so faint were they that I
could not be sure of the truth of my observation.</p>

<p>We set the ladders in place. Olaf I assigned to stand before
the door and watch for the first signs of its opening&mdash;if
open it should. The Becquerels were set within three-inch
tripods, whose feet I had equipped with vacuum rings to enable
them to hold fast to the rock.</p>

<p>I scaled one ladder and fastened a condenser over the boss;
descended; sent Larry up to watch it, and, ascending the second
ladder, rapidly fixed the other in its place. Then, with O'Keefe
watchful on his perch, I on mine, and Olaf's eyes fixed upon the
moon door, we began our vigil. Suddenly there was an exclamation
from Larry.</p>

<p>"Seven little lights are beginning to glow on this stone!" he
cried.</p>

<p>But I had already seen those beneath my lens begin to gleam
out with a silvery luster. Swiftly the rays within the condenser
began to thicken and increase, and as they did so the seven small
circles waxed like stars growing out of the dusk, and with a
queer&mdash;curdled is the best word I can find to define
it&mdash;radiance entirely strange to me.</p>

<p>Beneath me I heard a faint, sighing murmur and then the voice
of Huldricksson:</p>

<p>"It opens&mdash;the stone turns&mdash;"</p>

<p>I began to climb down the ladder. Again came Olaf's voice:</p>

<p>"The stone&mdash;it is open&mdash;" And then a shriek, a wail
of blended anguish and pity, of rage and despair&mdash;and the
sound of swift footsteps racing through the wall beneath me!</p>

<p>I dropped to the ground. The moon door was wide open, and
through it I caught a glimpse of a corridor filled with a faint,
pearly vaporous light like earliest misty dawn. But of Olaf I
could see&mdash;nothing! And even as I stood, gaping, from behind
me came the sharp crack of a rifle; the glass of the condenser at
Larry's side flew into fragments; he dropped swiftly to the
ground, the automatic in his hand flashed once, twice, into the
darkness.</p>

<p>And the moon door began to pivot slowly, slowly back into its
place!</p>

<p>I rushed toward the turning stone with the wild idea of
holding it open. As I thrust my hands against it there came at my
back a snarl and an oath and Larry staggered under the impact of
a body that had flung itself straight at his throat. He reeled at
the lip of the shallow cup at the base of the slab, slipped upon
its polished curve, fell and rolled with that which had attacked
him, kicking and writhing, straight through the narrowing portal
into the passage!</p>

<p>Forgetting all else, I sprang to his aid. As I leaped I felt
the closing edge of the moon door graze my side. Then, as Larry
raised a fist, brought it down upon the temple of the man who had
grappled with him and rose from the twitching body unsteadily to
his feet, I heard shuddering past me a mournful whisper; spun
about as though some giant's hand had whirled me&mdash;</p>

<p>The end of the corridor no longer opened out into the moonlit
square of ruined Nan-Tauach. It was barred by a solid mass of
glimmering stone. The moon door had closed!</p>

<p>O'Keefe took a stumbling step toward the barrier behind us.
There was no mark of juncture with the shining walls; the slab
fitted into the sides as closely as a mosaic.</p>

<p>"It's shut all right," said Larry. "But if there's a way in,
there's a way out. Anyway, Doc, we're right in the pew we've been
heading for&mdash;so why worry?" He grinned at me cheerfully. The
man on the floor groaned, and he dropped to his knees beside
him.</p>

<p>"Marakinoff!" he cried.</p>

<p>At my exclamation he moved aside, turning the face so I could
see it. It was clearly Russian, and just as clearly its possessor
was one of unusual force and intellect.</p>

<p>The strong, massive brow with orbital ridge unusually
developed, the dominant, high-bridged nose, the straight lips
with their more than suggestion of latent cruelty, and the strong
lines of the jaw beneath a black, pointed beard all gave evidence
that here was a personality beyond the ordinary.</p>

<p>"Couldn't be anybody else," said Larry, breaking in on my
thoughts. "He must have been watching us over there from
Chau-te-leur's vault all the time."</p>

<p>Swiftly he ran practiced hands over his body; then stood
erect, holding out to me two wicked-looking magazine pistols and
a knife. "He got one of my bullets through his right forearm,
too," he said. "Just a flesh wound, but it made him drop his
rifle. Some arsenal, our little Russian scientist, what?"</p>

<p>I opened my medical kit. The wound was a slight one, and Larry
stood looking on as I bandaged it.</p>

<p>"Got another one of those condensers?" he asked, suddenly.
"And do you suppose Olaf will know enough to use it?"</p>

<p>"Larry," I answered, "Olaf's not outside! He's in here
somewhere!"</p>

<p>His jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"The hell you say!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear him shriek when the stone opened?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I heard him yell, yes," he said. "But I didn't know what was
the matter. And then this wildcat jumped me&mdash;" He paused and
his eyes widened. "Which way did he go?" he asked swiftly. I
pointed down the faintly glowing passage.</p>

<p>"There's only one way," I said.</p>

<p>"Watch that bird close," hissed O'Keefe, pointing to
Marakinoff&mdash; and pistol in hand stretched his long legs and
raced away. I looked down at the Russian. His eyes were open, and
he reached out a hand to me. I lifted him to his feet.</p>

<p>"I have heard," he said. "We follow, quick. If you will take
my arm, please, I am shaken yet, yes&mdash;" I gripped his
shoulder without a word, and the two of us set off down the
corridor after O'Keefe. Marakinoff was gasping, and his weight
pressed upon me heavily, but he moved with all the will and
strength that were in him.</p>

<p>As we ran I took hasty note of the tunnel. Its sides were
smooth and polished, and the light seemed to come not from their
surfaces, but from far within them&mdash;giving to the walls an
illusive aspect of distance and depth; rendering them in a
peculiarly weird way&mdash;spacious. The passage turned, twisted,
ran down, turned again. It came to me that the light that
illumined the tunnel was given out by tiny points deep within the
stone, sprang from the points ripplingly and spread upon their
polished faces.</p>

<p>There was a cry from Larry far ahead.</p>

<p>"Olaf!"</p>

<p>I gripped Marakinoff's arm closer and we sped on. Now we were
coming fast to the end of the passage. Before us was a high arch,
and through it I glimpsed a dim, shifting luminosity as of mist
filled with rainbows. We reached the portal and I looked into a
chamber that might have been transported from that enchanted
palace of the Jinn King that rises beyond the magic mountains of
Kaf.</p>

<p>Before me stood O'Keefe and a dozen feet in front of him,
Huldricksson, with something clasped tightly in his arms. The
Norseman's feet were at the verge of a shining, silvery lip of
stone within whose oval lay a blue pool. And down upon this pool
staring upward like a gigantic eye, fell seven pillars of phantom
light&mdash;one of them amethyst, one of rose, another of white,
a fourth of blue, and three of emerald, of silver, and of amber.
They fell each upon the azure surface, and I knew that these were
the seven streams of radiance, within which the Dweller took
shape&mdash;now but pale ghosts of their brilliancy when the full
energy of the moon stream raced through them.</p>

<p>Huldricksson bent and placed on the shining silver lip of the
Pool that which he held&mdash;and I saw that it was the body of a
child! He set it there so gently, bent over the side and thrust a
hand down into the water. And as he did so he moaned and lurched
against the little body that lay before him. Instantly the form
moved&mdash;and slipped over the verge into the blue.
Huldricksson threw his body over the stone, hands clutching, arms
thrust deep down&mdash;and from his lips issued a long-drawn,
heart-shriveling wail of pain and of anguish that held in it
nothing human!</p>

<br>

<p>Close on its wake came a cry from Marakinoff.</p>

<p>"Catch him!" shouted the Russian. "Drag him back! Quick!"</p>

<p>He leaped forward, but before he could half clear the
distance, O'Keefe had leaped too, had caught the Norseman by the
shoulders and toppled him backward, where he lay whimpering and
sobbing. And as I rushed behind Marakinoff I saw Larry lean over
the lip of the Pool and cover his eyes with a shaking hand; saw
the Russian peer into it with real pity in his cold eyes.</p>

<p>Then I stared down myself into the Moon Pool, and there,
sinking, was a little maid whose dead face and fixed,
terror-filled eyes looked straight into mine; and ever sinking
slowly, slowly&mdash;vanished! And I knew that this was Olaf's
Freda, his beloved <a title= "Norwegian and Danish:
'darling'"><i>yndling!</i></a></p>

<p>But where was the mother, and where had Olaf found his
babe?</p>

<p>The Russian was first to speak.</p>

<p>"You have nitroglycerine there, yes?" he asked, pointing
toward my medical kit that I had gripped unconsciously and
carried with me during the mad rush down the passage. I nodded
and drew it out.</p>

<p>"Hypodermic," he ordered next, curtly; took the syringe,
filled it accurately with its one one-hundredth of a grain
dosage, and leaned over Huldricksson. He rolled up the sailor's
sleeves half-way to the shoulder. The arms were white with
somewhat of that weird semi-translucence that I had seen on
Throckmartin's breast where a tendril of the Dweller had touched
him; and his hands were of the same whiteness&mdash;like a
baroque pearl. Above the line of white, Marakinoff thrust the
needle.</p>

<p>"He will need all his heart can do," he said to me.</p>

<p>Then he reached down into a belt about his waist and drew from
it a small, flat flask of what seemed to be lead. He opened it
and let a few drops of its contents fall on each arm of the
Norwegian. The liquid sparkled and instantly began to spread over
the skin much as oil or gasoline dropped on water does
&mdash;only far more rapidly. And as it spread it drew a
sparkling film over the marbled flesh and little wisps of vapor
rose from it. The Norseman's mighty chest heaved with agony. His
hands clenched. The Russian gave a grunt of satisfaction at this,
dropped a little more of the liquid, and then, watching closely,
grunted again and leaned back. Huldricksson's labored breathing
ceased, his head dropped upon Larry's knee, and from his arms and
hands the whiteness swiftly withdrew.</p>

<p>Marakinoff arose and contemplated us&mdash;almost
benevolently.</p>

<p>"He will all right be in five minutes," he said. "I know. I do
it to pay for that shot of mine, and also because we will need
him. Yes." He turned to Larry. "You have a poonch like a mule
kick, my young friend," he said. "Some time you pay me for that,
too, eh?" He smiled; and the quality of the grimace was not
exactly reassuring. Larry looked him over quizzically.</p>

<p>"You're Marakinoff, of course," he said. The Russian nodded,
betraying no surprise at the recognition.</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant O'Keefe of the Royal Flying Corps," replied Larry,
saluting. "And this gentleman is Dr. Walter T. Goodwin."</p>

<p>Marakinoff's face brightened.</p>

<p>"The American botanist?" he queried. I nodded.</p>

<p>"Ah," cried Marakinoff eagerly, "but this is fortunate. Long I
have desired to meet you. Your work, for an American, is most
excellent; surprising. But you are wrong in your theory of the
development of the <a title= "one of several botanical names for
flowering plants"><i>Angiospermae</i></a> from <i>Cycadeoidea
dacotensis</i>. <i>Da</i>&mdash;all wrong&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was interrupting him with considerable heat, for my
conclusions from the fossil Cycadeoidea I knew to be my greatest
triumph, when Larry broke in upon me rudely.</p>

<p>"Say," he spluttered, "am I crazy or are you? What in
damnation kind of a place and time is this to start an argument
like that?</p>

<p>"<a title= "one of several botanical names for flowering
plants"><i>Angiospermae</i></a>, is it?" exclaimed Larry.
"HELL!"</p>

<p>Marakinoff again regarded him with that irritating air of
benevolence.</p>

<p>"You have not the scientific mind, young friend," he said.
"The poonch, yes! But so has the mule. You must learn that only
the fact is important &mdash;not you, not me, not this"&mdash;he
pointed to Huldricksson&mdash; "or its sorrows. Only the fact,
whatever it is, is real, yes. But"&mdash;he turned to
me&mdash;"another time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Huldricksson interrupted him. The big seaman had risen stiffly
to his feet and stood with Larry's arm supporting him. He
stretched out his hands to me.</p>

<p>"I saw her," he whispered. "I saw mine Freda when the stone
swung. She lay there&mdash;just at my feet. I picked her up and I
saw that mine Freda was dead. But I hoped&mdash;and I thought
maybe mine Helma was somewhere here, too, So I ran with <a
title="Norwegian and Danish: 'my darling'"><i>mine
yndling</i></a>&mdash;here&mdash;" His voice broke. "I thought
maybe she was <i>not</i> dead," he went on. "And I saw
that"&mdash;he pointed to the Moon Pool&mdash;"and I thought I
would bathe her face and she might live again. And when I dipped
my hands within&mdash;the life left them, and cold, deadly cold,
ran up through them into my heart. And <i>mine</i> Freda
&mdash;she fell&mdash;" he covered his eyes, and dropping his
head on O'Keefe's shoulder, stood, racked by sobs that seemed to
tear at his very soul.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>11. &mdash; THE FLAME-TIPPED
SHADOWS</h2>

<p class="first">Marakinoff nodded his head solemnly as Olaf
finished.</p>

<p>"<i>Da</i>!" he said. "That which comes from here took them
both&mdash; the woman and the child. <i>Da</i>! They came clasped
within it and the stone shut upon them. But why it left the child
behind I do not understand."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" I cried in amazement.</p>

<p>"Because I saw it," answered Marakinoff simply. "Not only did
I see it, but hardly had I time to make escape through the
entrance before it passed whirling and murmuring and its bell
sounds all joyous. <i>Da</i>! It was what you call the squeak
close, that."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," I said&mdash;stilling Larry with a gesture.
"Do I understand you to say that you were within this place?"</p>

<p>Marakinoff actually beamed upon me.</p>

<p>"<i>Da</i>, Dr. Goodwin," he said, "I went in when that which
comes from it went out!"</p>

<p>I gaped at him, stricken dumb; into Larry's bellicose attitude
crept a suggestion of grudging respect; Olaf, trembling, watched
silently.</p>

<p>"Dr. Goodwin and my impetuous young friend, you," went on
Marakinoff after a moment's silence and I wondered vaguely why he
did not include Huldricksson in his address&mdash;"it is time
that we have an understanding. I have a proposal to make to you
also. It is this; we are what you call a bad boat, and all of us
are in it. <i>Da</i>! We need all hands, is it not so? Let us put
together our knowledge and our brains and resources&mdash;and
even a poonch of a mule is a resource," he looked wickedly at
O'Keefe, "and pull our boat into quiet waters again. After
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All very well, Marakinoff," interjected Larry, "but I don't
feel very safe in any boat with somebody capable of shooting me
through the back."</p>

<p>Marakinoff waved a deprecatory hand.</p>

<p>"It was natural that," he said, "logical, <i>da</i>! Here is a
very great secret, perhaps many secrets to my country
invaluable&mdash;" He paused, shaken by some overpowering
emotion; the veins in his forehead grew congested, the cold eyes
blazed and the guttural voice harshened.</p>

<p>"I do not apologize and I do not explain," rasped Marakinoff.
"But I will tell you, <i>da</i>! Here is my country sweating
blood in an experiment to liberate the world. And here are the
other nations ringing us like wolves and waiting to spring at our
throats at the least sign of weakness. And here are you,
Lieutenant O'Keefe of the English wolves, and you Dr. Goodwin of
the Yankee pack&mdash;and here in this place may be that will
enable my country to win its war for the worker. What are the
lives of you two and this sailor to that? Less than the flies I
crush with my hand, less than midges in the sunbeam!"</p>

<p>He suddenly gripped himself.</p>

<p>"But that is not now the important thing," he resumed, almost
coldly. "Not that nor my shooting. Let us squarely the situation
face. My proposal is so: that we join interests, and what you
call see it through together; find our way through this place and
those secrets learn of which I have spoken, if we can. And when
that is done we will go our ways, to his own land each, to make
use of them for our lands as each of us may. On my part, I offer
my knowledge &mdash;and it is very valuable, Dr.
Goodwin&mdash;and my training. You and Lieutenant O'Keefe do the
same, and this man Olaf, what he can of his strength, for I do
not think his usefulness lies in his brains, no."</p>

<p>"In effect, Goodwin," broke in Larry as I hesitated, "the
professor's proposition is this: he wants to know what's going on
here but he begins to realize it's no one man's job and besides
we have the drop on him. We're three to his one, and we have all
his hardware and cutlery. But also we can do better with him than
without him&mdash;just as he can do better with us than without
us. It's an even break&mdash;for a while. But once he gets that
information he's looking for, then look out. You and Olaf and I
are the wolves and the flies and the midges again&mdash;and the
strafing will be about due. Nevertheless, with three to one
against him, if he can get away with it he deserves to. I'm for
taking him up, if you are."</p>

<p>There was almost a twinkle in Marakinoff's eyes.</p>

<p>"It is not just as I would have put it, perhaps," he said,
"but in its skeleton he has right. Nor will I turn my hand
against you while we are still in danger here. I pledge you my
honor on this."</p>

<p>Larry laughed.</p>

<p>"All right, Professor," he grinned. "I believe you mean every
word you say. Nevertheless, I'll just keep the guns."</p>

<p>Marakinoff bowed, imperturbably.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, "I will tell you what I know. I found the
secret of the door mechanism even as you did, Dr. Goodwin. But by
carelessness, my condensers were broken. I was forced to wait
while I sent for others&mdash; and the waiting might be for
months. I took certain precautions, and on the first night of
this full moon I hid myself within the vault of Chau-te-leur."</p>

<p>An involuntary thrill of admiration for the man went through
me at the manifest heroism of this leap in the dark. I could see
it reflected in Larry's face.</p>

<p>"I hid in the vault," continued Marakinoff, "and I saw that
which comes from here come out. I waited&mdash;long hours. At
last, when the moon was low, it
returned&mdash;ecstatically&mdash;with a man, a native, in
embrace enfolded. It passed through the door, and soon then the
moon became low and the door closed.</p>

<p>"The next night more confidence was mine, yes. And after that
which comes had gone, I looked through its open door. I said, 'It
will not return for three hours. While it is away, why shall I
not into its home go through the door it has left open?' So I
went&mdash;even to here. I looked at the pillars of light and I
tested the liquid of the Pool on which they fell. That liquid,
Dr. Goodwin, is not water, and it is not any fluid known on
earth." He handed me a small vial, its neck held in a long
thong.</p>

<p>"Take this," he said, "and see."</p>

<p>Wonderingly, I took the bottle; dipped it down into the Pool.
The liquid was extraordinarily light; seemed, in fact, to give
the vial buoyancy. I held it to the light. It was striated,
streaked, as though little living, pulsing veins ran through it.
And its blueness, even in the vial, held an intensity of
luminousness.</p>

<p>"Radioactive," said Marakinoff. "Some liquid that is intensely
radioactive; but what it is I know not at all. Upon the living
skin it acts like radium raised to the nth power and with an
element most mysterious added. The solution with which I treated
him," he pointed to Huldricksson, "I had prepared before I came
here, from certain information I had. It is largely salts of
radium and its base is Loeb's formula for the neutralization of
radium and X-ray burns. Taking this man at once, before the
degeneration had become really active, I could negative it. But
after two hours I could have done nothing."</p>

<p>He paused a moment.</p>

<p>"Next I studied the nature of these luminous walls. I
concluded that whoever had made them, knew the secret of the
Almighty's manufacture of light from the ether itself! Colossal!
<i>Da</i>! But the substance of these blocks confines an
atomic&mdash;how would you say&mdash;atomic manipulation, a
conscious arrangement of electrons, light-emitting and perhaps
indefinitely so. These blocks are lamps in which oil and wick are
electrons drawing light waves from ether itself! A Prometheus,
indeed, this discoverer! I looked at my watch and that little
guardian warned me that it was time to go. I went. That which
comes forth returned&mdash;this time empty-handed.</p>

<p>"And the next night I did the same thing. Engrossed in
research, I let the moments go by to the danger point, and
scarcely was I replaced within the vault when the shining thing
raced over the walls, and in its grip the woman and child.</p>

<p>"Then you came&mdash;and that is all. And now&mdash;what is it
you know?"</p>

<p>Very briefly I went over my story. His eyes gleamed now and
then, but he did not interrupt me.</p>

<p>"A great secret! A colossal secret!" he muttered, when I had
ended. "We cannot leave it hidden."</p>

<p>"The first thing to do is to try the door," said Larry, matter
of fact.</p>

<p>"There is no use, my young friend," assured Marakinoff
mildly.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless we'll try," said Larry. We retraced our way
through the winding tunnel to the end, but soon even O'Keefe saw
that any idea of moving the slab from within was hopeless. We
returned to the Chamber of the Pool. The pillars of light were
fainter, and we knew that the moon was sinking. On the world
outside before long dawn would be breaking. I began to feel
thirst &mdash;and the blue semblance of water within the silvery
rim seemed to glint mockingly as my eyes rested on it.</p>

<p>"<i>Da</i>!" it was Marakinoff, reading my thoughts uncannily.
"<i>Da</i>! We will be thirsty. And it will be very bad for him
of us who loses control and drinks of that, my friend.
<i>Da</i>!"</p>

<p>Larry threw back his shoulders as though shaking a burden from
them.</p>

<p>"This place would give an angel of joy the willies," he said.
"I suggest that we look around and find something that will take
us somewhere. You can bet the people that built it had more ways
of getting in than that once-a-month family entrance. Doc, you
and Olaf take the left wall; the professor and I will take the
right."</p>

<p>He loosened one of his automatics with a suggestive
movement.</p>

<p>"After you, Professor," he bowed, politely, to the Russian. We
parted and set forth.</p>

<p>The chamber widened out from the portal in what seemed to be
the arc of an immense circle. The shining walls held a
perceptible curve, and from this curvature I estimated that the
roof was fully three hundred feet above us.</p>

<p>The floor was of smooth, mosaic-fitted blocks of a faintly
yellow tinge. They were not light-emitting like the blocks that
formed the walls. The radiance from these latter, I noted, had
the peculiar quality of <i>thickening</i> a few yards from its
source, and it was this that produced the effect of misty, veiled
distances. As we walked, the seven columns of rays streaming down
from the crystalline globes high above us waned steadily; the
glow within the chamber lost its prismatic shimmer and became an
even grey tone somewhat like moonlight in a thin cloud.</p>

<p>Now before us, out from the wall, jutted a low terrace. It was
all of a pearly rose-colored stone, slender, graceful pillars of
the same hue. The face of the terrace was about ten feet high,
and all over it ran a bas-relief of what looked like short,
trailing vines, surmounted by five stalks, on the tip of each of
which was a flower.</p>

<p>We passed along the terrace. It turned in an abrupt curve. I
heard a hail, and there, fifty feet away, at the curving end of a
wall identical with that where we stood, were Larry and
Marakinoff. Obviously the left side of the chamber was a
duplicate of that we had explored. We joined. In front of us the
columned barriers ran back a hundred feet, forming an alcove. The
end of this alcove was another wall of the same rose stone, but
upon it the design of vines was much heavier.</p>

<p>We took a step forward&mdash;there was a gasp of awe from the
Norseman, a guttural exclamation from Marakinoff. For on, or
rather within, the wall before us, a great oval began to glow,
waxed almost to a flame and then shone steadily out as though
from behind it a light was streaming through the stone
itself!</p>

<p>And within the roseate oval two flame-tipped shadows appeared,
stood for a moment, and then seemed to float out upon its
surface. The shadows wavered; the tips of flame that nimbused
them with flickering points of vermilion pulsed outward, drew
back, darted forth again, and once more withdrew
themselves&mdash;and as they did so the shadows
thickened&mdash;and suddenly there before us stood two
figures!</p>

<p>One was a girl&mdash;a girl whose great eyes were golden as
the fabled lilies of Kwan-Yung that were born of the kiss of the
sun upon the amber goddess the demons of Lao-Tz'e carved for him;
whose softly curved lips were red as the royal coral, and whose
golden-brown hair reached to her knees!</p>

<p>And the second was a gigantic frog&mdash;A <i>woman</i> frog,
head helmeted with carapace of shell around which a fillet of
brilliant yellow jewels shone; enormous round eyes of blue
circled with a broad iris of green; monstrous body of banded
orange and white girdled with strand upon strand of the flashing
yellow gems; six feet high if an inch, and with one webbed paw of
its short, powerfully muscled forelegs resting upon the white
shoulder of the golden-eyed girl!</p>

<p>Moments must have passed as we stood in stark amazement,
gazing at that incredible apparition. The two figures, although
as real as any of those who stood beside me, unphantomlike as it
is possible to be, had a distinct suggestion
of&mdash;projection.</p>

<p>They were there before us&mdash;golden-eyed girl and grotesque
frog-woman&mdash;complete in every line and curve; and still it
was as though their bodies passed back through distances; as
though, to try to express the well-nigh inexpressible, the two
shapes we were looking upon were the end of an infinite number
stretching in fine linked chain far away, of which the eyes saw
only the nearest, while in the brain some faculty higher than
sight recognized and registered the unseen others.</p>

<p>The gigantic eyes of the frog-woman took us all
in&mdash;unwinkingly. Little glints of phosphorescence shone out
within the metallic green of the outer iris ring. She stood
upright, her great legs bowed; the monstrous slit of a mouth
slightly open, revealing a row of white teeth sharp and pointed
as lancets; the paw resting on the girl's shoulder, half covering
its silken surface, and from its five webbed digits long yellow
claws of polished horn glistened against the delicate texture of
the flesh.</p>

<p>But if the frog-woman regarded us all, not so did the maiden
of the rosy wall. Her eyes were fastened upon Larry, drinking him
in with extraordinary intentness. She was tall, far over the
average of women, almost as tall, indeed, as O'Keefe himself; not
more than twenty years old, if that, I thought. Abruptly she
leaned forward, the golden eyes softened and grew tender; the red
lips moved as though she were speaking.</p>

<p>Larry took a quick step, and his face was that of one who
after countless births comes at last upon the twin soul lost to
him for ages. The frog-woman turned her eyes upon the girl; her
huge lips moved, and I knew that she was talking! The girl held
out a warning hand to O'Keefe, and then raised it, resting each
finger upon one of the five flowers of the carved vine close
beside her. Once, twice, three times, she pressed upon the flower
centers, and I noted that her hand was curiously long and
slender, the digits like those wonderful tapering ones the
painters we call the primitive gave to their Virgins.</p>

<p>Three times she pressed the flowers, and then looked intently
at Larry once more. A slow, sweet smile curved the crimson lips.
She stretched both hands out toward him again eagerly; a burning
blush rose swiftly over white breasts and flowerlike face.</p>

<p>Like the clicking out of a cinematograph, the pulsing oval
faded and golden-eyed girl and frog-woman were gone!</p>

<p>And thus it was that Lakla, the handmaiden of the Silent Ones,
and Larry O'Keefe first looked into each other's hearts!</p>

<p>Larry stood rapt, gazing at the stone.</p>

<p>"Eilidh," I heard him whisper; "Eilidh of the lips like the
red, red rowan and the golden-brown hair!"</p>

<p>"Clearly of the <a title="the frog
family"><i>Ranidae</i>,"</a> said Marakinoff, "a development of
the fossil <a title= "an obsolete term for any member of an
extinct superorder or subclass (Labyrinthodontia) of amphibians,
which constituted some of the dominant animals of Late Paleozoic
and Early Mesozoic times. Wikpedia."> Labyrinthodonts:</a> you
saw her teeth, <i>da</i>?"</p>

<p>"<a title="the frog family"><i>Ranidae</i>,"</a>, yes," I
answered. "But from the <a title= "in former classifications a
division of Amphibia comprising all pre-Jurassic and some later
extinct large salamandriform amphibia"> Stegocephalia;</a> of the
order <a title= "tailless"><i>Ecaudata</i></a>&mdash;"</p>

<p>Never such a complete indignation as was in O'Keefe's voice as
he interrupted.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;fossils and Stego whatever it is?" he
asked. "She was a girl, a wonder girl&mdash;a real girl, and
Irish, or I'm not an O'Keefe!"</p>

<p>"We were talking about the frog-woman, Larry," I said,
conciliatingly.</p>

<p>His eyes were wild as he regarded us.</p>

<p>"Say," he said, "if you two had been in the Garden of Eden
when Eve took the apple, you wouldn't have had time to give her a
look for counting the scales on the snake!"</p>

<p>He strode swiftly over to the wall. We followed. Larry paused,
stretched his hand up to the flowers on which the tapering
fingers of the golden-eyed girl had rested.</p>

<p>"It was here she put up her hand," he murmured. He pressed
caressingly the carved calyxes, once, twice, a third time even as
she had&mdash;and silently and softly the wall began to split; on
each side a great stone pivoted slowly, and before us a portal
stood, opening into a narrow corridor glowing with the same rosy
luster that had gleamed around the flame-tipped shadows!</p>

<p>"Have your gun ready, Olaf!" said Larry. "We follow Golden
Eyes," he said to me.</p>

<p>"Follow?" I echoed stupidly.</p>

<p>"Follow!" he said. "She came to show us the way! Follow? I'd
follow her through a thousand hells!"</p>

<p>And with Olaf at one end, O'Keefe at the other, both of them
with automatics in hand, and Marakinoff and I between them, we
stepped over the threshold.</p>

<p>At our right, a few feet away, the passage ended abruptly in a
square of polished stone, from which came faint rose radiance.
The roof of the place was less than two feet over O'Keefe's
head.</p>

<p>A yard at left of us lifted a four-foot high, gently curved
barricade, stretching from wall to wall&mdash;and beyond it was
blackness; an utter and appalling blackness that seemed to gather
itself from infinite depths. The rose-glow in which we stood was
cut off by the blackness as though it had substance; it shimmered
out to meet it, and was checked as though by a blow; indeed, so
strong was the suggestion of sinister, straining force within the
rayless opacity that I shrank back, and Marakinoff with me. Not
so O'Keefe. Olaf beside him, he strode to the wall and peered
over. He beckoned us.</p>

<p>"Flash your pocket-light down there," he said to me, pointing
into the thick darkness below us. The little electric circle
quivered down as though afraid, and came to rest upon a surface
that resembled nothing so much as clear, black ice. I ran the
light across&mdash;here and there. The floor of the corridor was
of a substance so smooth, so polished, that no man could have
walked upon it; it sloped downward at a slowly increasing
angle.</p>

<p>"We'd have to have non-skid chains and brakes on our feet to
tackle that," mused Larry. Abstractedly be ran his hands over the
edge on which he was leaning. Suddenly they hesitated and then
gripped tightly.</p>

<p>"That's a queer one!" he exclaimed. His right palm was resting
upon a rounded protuberance, on the side of which were three
small circular indentations.</p>

<p>"A queer one&mdash;" he repeated&mdash;and pressed his fingers
upon the circles.</p>

<p>There was a sharp click; the slabs that had opened to let us
through swung swiftly together; a curiously rapid vibration
thrilled through us, a wind arose and passed over our
heads&mdash;a wind that grew and grew until it became a whistling
shriek, then a roar and then a mighty humming, to which every
atom in our bodies pulsed in rhythm painful almost to
disintegration!</p>

<p>The rosy wall dwindled in a flash to a point of light and
disappeared!</p>

<p>Wrapped in the clinging, impenetrable blackness we were
racing, dropping, hurling at a frightful speed&mdash;where?</p>

<p>And ever that awful humming of the rushing wind and the
lightning cleaving of the tangible dark&mdash;so, it came to me
oddly, must the newly released soul race through the sheer
blackness of outer space up to that Throne of Justice, where God
sits high above all suns!</p>

<p>I felt Marakinoff creep close to me; gripped my nerve and
flashed my pocket-light; saw Larry standing, peering, peering
ahead, and Huldricksson, one strong arm around his shoulders,
bracing him. And then the speed began to slacken.</p>

<p>Millions of miles, it seemed, below the sound of the unearthly
hurricane I heard Larry's voice, thin and ghostlike, beneath its
clamor.</p>

<p>"Got it!" shrilled the voice. "Got it! Don't worry!"</p>

<p>The wind died down to the roar, passed back into the whistling
shriek and diminished to a steady whisper. In the comparative
quiet O'Keefe's tones now came in normal volume.</p>

<p>"Some little shoot-the-chutes, what?" he shouted.
"Say&mdash;if they had this at Coney Island or the Crystal
Palace! Press all the way in these holes and she goes top-high.
Diminish pressure&mdash;diminish speed. The curve of
this&mdash;dashboard&mdash;here sends the wind shooting up over
our heads &mdash;like a windshield. What's behind you?"</p>

<p>I flashed the light back. The mechanism on which we were ended
in another wall exactly similar to that over which O'Keefe
crouched.</p>

<p>"Well, we can't fall out, anyway," he laughed. "Wish to hell I
knew where the brakes were! Look out!"</p>

<p>We dropped dizzily down an abrupt, seemingly endless slope;
fell&mdash; fell as into an abyss&mdash;then shot abruptly out of
the blackness into a throbbing green radiance. O'Keefe's fingers
must have pressed down upon the controls, for we leaped forward
almost with the speed of light. I caught a glimpse of luminous
immensities on the verge of which we flew; of depths
inconceivable, and flitting through the incredible
spaces&mdash;gigantic shadows as of the wings of <a title= "the
angel of the trumpet in Islamic eschatology">Israfel</a>, which
are so wide, say the Arabs, the world can cower under them like a
nestling&mdash; and then&mdash;again the living blackness!</p>

<p>"What was that?" This from Larry, with the nearest approach to
awe that he had yet shown.</p>

<p><a title="Norwegian: 'magic'"><i>"Trolldom!"</i></a> croaked
the voice of Olaf.</p>

<p><a title= "Russian: the devil; short form of the expletive
'chort voz'mi!' - the devil take it!"> <i>"Chort!"</i></a> This
from Marakinoff. "What a space!"</p>

<p>"Have you considered, Dr. Goodwin," he went on after a pause,
"a curious thing? We know, or, at least, is it not that nine out
of ten astronomers believe, that the moon was hurled out of this
same region we now call the Pacific when the earth was yet like
molasses; almost molten, I should say. And is it not curious that
that which comes from the Moon Chamber needs the moon-rays to
bring it forth; is it not? And is it not significant again that
the stone depends upon the moon for operating? <i>Da</i>! And
last&mdash; such a space in mother earth as we just glimpsed, how
else could it have been torn but by some gigantic
birth&mdash;like that of the moon? <i>Da</i>! I do not put
forward these as statements of fact&mdash;no! But as
suggestions&mdash;"</p>

<p>I started; there was so much that this might explain&mdash;an
unknown element that responded to the moon-rays in opening the
moon door; the blue Pool with its weird radioactivity, and the
force within it that reacted to the same light stream&mdash;</p>

<p>It was not inconceivable that a film had drawn over the world
wound, a film of earth-flesh which drew itself over that colossal
abyss after our planet had borne its satellite&mdash;that world
womb did not close when her shining child sprang forth&mdash;it
was possible; and all that we know of earth depth is four miles
of her eight thousand.</p>

<p>What is there at the heart of earth? What of that radiant
unknown element upon the moon mount Tycho? What of that element
unknown to us as part of earth which is seen only in the corona
of the sun at eclipse that we callnd to <a title= "a hypothetical
element once thought to exist because certain spectral lines in
the emission spectrum of the solar corona could not be identified
by known elements. These lines were subsequently found tobe
emitted by certain highly ionized metals."> <i>coronium</i>?</a>
Yet the earth is child of the sun as the moon is earth's
daughter. And what of that other unknown element we find glowing
green in the far-flung nebulae&mdash;green as that we had just
passed through&mdash; and that we call <a title= "a hypothetical
element once thought to be present in emission nebulae because of
certain unidentified spectral lines, now known to be forbidden
transitions of oxygen and nitrogen ions."> <i>nebulium</i>?</a>
Yet the sun is child of the nebulae as the earth is child of the
sun and the moon is child of the earth.</p>

<p>And what miracles are there in <a title= "a hypothetical
element once thought to exist because certain spectral lines in
the emission spectrum of the solar corona could not be identified
by known elements. These lines were subsequently found to be
emitted by certain highly ionized metals."> <i>coronium</i></a>
and <a title= "a hypothetical element once thought to be present
in emission nebulae because of certain unidentified spectral
lines, now known to be forbidden transitions of oxygen and
nitrogen ions."> <i>nebulium</i></a> which, as the child of
nebula and sun, we inherit? Yes &mdash;and in Tycho's enigma
which came from earth heart?</p>

<p>We were flashing down to earth heart! And what miracles were
hidden there?</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>12. &mdash; THE END OF THE
JOURNEY</h2>

<p class="first">"Say Doc!" It was Larry's voice flung back at
me. "I was thinking about that frog. I think it was her pet. Damn
me if I see any difference between a frog and a snake, and one of
the nicest women I ever knew had two pet pythons that followed
her around like kittens. Not such a devilish lot of choice
between a frog and a snake&mdash;except on the side of the frog?
What? Anyway, any pet that girl wants is hers, I don't care if
it's a leaping twelve-toed lobster or a whale-bodied scorpion.
Get me?"</p>

<p>By which I knew that our remarks upon the frog woman were
still bothering O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"He thinks of foolish nothings like the foolish sailor!"
grunted Marakinoff, acid contempt in his words. "What are their
women to&mdash; this?" He swept out a hand and as though at a
signal the car poised itself for an instant, then dipped,
literally dipped down into sheer space; skimmed forward in what
was clearly curved flight, rose as upon a sweeping upgrade and
then began swiftly to slacken its fearful speed.</p>

<p>Far ahead a point of light showed; grew steadily; we were
within it &mdash;and softly all movement ceased. How acute had
been the strain of our journey I did not realize until I tried to
stand&mdash;and sank back, leg-muscles too shaky to bear my
weight. The car rested in a slit in the center of a smooth walled
chamber perhaps twenty feet square. The wall facing us was
pierced by a low doorway through which we could see a flight of
steps leading downward.</p>

<p>The light streamed through a small opening, the base of which
was twice a tall man's height from the floor. A curving flight of
broad, low steps led up to it. And now it came to my steadying
brain that there was something puzzling, peculiar, strangely
unfamiliar about this light. It was silvery, shaded faintly with
a delicate blue and flushed lightly with a nacreous rose; but a
rose that differed from that of the terraces of the Pool Chamber
as the rose within the opal differs from that within the pearl.
In it were tiny, gleaming points like the motes in a sunbeam, but
sparkling white like the dust of diamonds, and with a quality of
vibrant vitality; they were as though they were alive. The light
cast no shadows!</p>

<p>A little breeze came through the oval and played about us. It
was laden with what seemed the mingled breath of spice flowers
and pines. It was curiously vivifying, and in it the diamonded
atoms of light shook and danced.</p>

<p>I stepped out of the car, the Russian following, and began to
ascend the curved steps toward the opening, at the top of which
O'Keefe and Olaf already stood. As they looked out I saw both
their faces change&mdash;Olaf's with awe, O'Keefe's with
incredulous amaze. I hurried to their side.</p>

<p>At first all that I could see was space&mdash;a space filled
with the same coruscating effulgence that pulsed about me. I
glanced upward, obeying that instinctive impulse of earth folk
that bids them seek within the sky for sources of light. There
was no sky&mdash;at least no sky such as we know &mdash;all was a
sparkling nebulosity rising into infinite distances as the azure
above the day-world seems to fill all the heavens&mdash;through
it ran pulsing waves and flashing javelin rays that were like
shining shadows of the aurora; echoes, octaves lower, of those
brilliant arpeggios and chords that play about the poles. My eyes
fell beneath its splendor; I stared outward.</p>

<p>Miles away, gigantic luminous cliffs sprang sheer from the
limits of a lake whose waters were of milky opalescence. It was
from these cliffs that the spangled radiance came, shimmering out
from all their lustrous surfaces. To left and to right, as far as
the eye could see, they stretched&mdash;and they vanished in the
auroral nebulosity on high!</p>

<p>"Look at that!" exclaimed Larry. I followed his pointing
finger. On the face of the shining wall, stretched between two
colossal columns, hung an incredible veil; prismatic, gleaming
with all the colors of the spectrum. It was like a web of
rainbows woven by the fingers of the daughters of the Jinn. In
front of it and a little at each side was a semi-circular pier,
or, better, a plaza of what appeared to be glistening, pale-yellow
ivory. At each end of its half-circle clustered a few low-walled,
rose-stone structures, each of them surmounted by a
number of high, slender pinnacles.</p>

<p>We looked at each other, I think, a bit helplessly&mdash;and
back again through the opening. We were standing, as I have said,
at its base. The wall in which it was set was at least ten feet
thick, and so, of course, all that we could see of that which was
without were the distances that revealed themselves above the
outer ledge of the oval.</p>

<p>"Let's take a look at what's under us," said Larry.</p>

<p>He crept out upon the ledge and peered down, the rest of us
following. A hundred yards beneath us stretched gardens that must
have been like those of many-columned Iram, which the ancient
Addite King had built for his pleasure ages before the deluge,
and which Allah, so the Arab legend tells, took and hid from man,
within the Sahara, beyond all hope of finding&mdash;jealous
because they were more beautiful than his in paradise. Within
them flowers and groves of laced, fernlike trees, pillared
pavilions nestled.</p>

<p>The trunks of the trees were of emerald, of vermilion, and of
azure-blue, and the blossoms, whose fragrance was borne to us,
shone like jewels. The graceful pillars were tinted delicately. I
noted that the pavilions were double&mdash;in a way,
two-storied&mdash;and that they were oddly splotched with circles,
with squares, and with oblongs of&mdash;opacity; noted too that
over many this opacity stretched like a roof; yet it did not seem
material; rather was it&mdash;impenetrable shadow!</p>

<p>Down through this city of gardens ran a broad shining green
thoroughfare, glistening like glass and spanned at regular
intervals with graceful, arched bridges. The road flashed to a
wide square, where rose, from a base of that same silvery stone
that formed the lip of the Moon Pool, a titanic structure of
seven terraces; and along it flitted objects that bore a curious
resemblance to the shell of the Nautilus. Within them
were&mdash;human figures! And upon tree-bordered promenades on
each side walked others!</p>

<p>Far to the right we caught the glint of another emerald-paved
road.</p>

<p>And between the two the gardens grew sweetly down to the
hither side of that opalescent water across which were the
radiant cliffs and the curtain of mystery.</p>

<p>Thus it was that we first saw the city of the Dweller; blessed
and accursed as no place on earth, or under or above earth has
ever been&mdash; or, that force willing which some call God, ever
again shall be!</p>

<p><a title= "Russian: the devil; short form of the expletive
'chort voz'mi!' - the devil take it!"> <i>"Chort!"</i></a>
whispered Marakinoff. "Incredible!"</p>

<p>"<a title="Norwegian: 'magic'"><i>"Trolldom!"</i></a>!" gasped
Olaf Huldricksson. "It is <a title="Norwegian:
'magic'"><i>"trolldom!"</i></a></p>

<p>"Listen, Olaf!" said Larry. "Cut out that <a title=
"Norwegian: 'magic'"><i>trolldom</i></a> stuff! There's no <a
title= "Norwegian: 'magic'"><i>trolldom</i></a>, or fairies,
outside Ireland. Get that! And this isn't Ireland. And, buck up,
Professor!" This to Marakinoff. "What you see down there are
people&mdash;<i>just plain people</i>. And wherever there's
people is where I live. Get me?</p>

<p>"There's no way in but in&mdash;and no way out but out," said
O'Keefe. "And there's the stairway. Eggs are eggs no matter how
they're cooked&mdash; and people are just people, fellow
travelers, no matter what dish they are in," he concluded. "Come
on!"</p>

<p>With the three of us close behind him, he marched toward the
entrance.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13"></a>13. &mdash; YOLARA,
PRIESTESS OF THE SHINING ONE</h2>

<p class="first">"You'd better have this handy, Doc." O'Keefe
paused at the head of the stairway and handed me one of the
automatics he had taken from Marakinoff.</p>

<p>"Shall I not have one also?" rather anxiously asked the
latter.</p>

<p>"When you need it you'll get it," answered O'Keefe. "I'll tell
you frankly, though, Professor, that you'll have to show me
before I trust you with a gun. You shoot too straight&mdash;from
cover."</p>

<p>The flash of anger in the Russian's eyes turned to a cold
consideration.</p>

<p>"You say always just what is in your mind, Lieutenant
O'Keefe," he mused. "<i>Da</i>&mdash;that I shall remember!"
Later I was to recall this odd observation&mdash;and Marakinoff
was to remember indeed.</p>

<p>In single file, O'Keefe at the head and Olaf bringing up the
rear, we passed through the portal. Before us dropped a circular
shaft, into which the light from the chamber of the oval streamed
liquidly; set in its sides the steps spiraled, and down them we
went, cautiously. The stairway ended in a circular well;
silent&mdash;with no trace of exit! The rounded stones joined
each other evenly&mdash;hermetically. Carved on one of the slabs
was one of the five flowered vines. I pressed my fingers upon the
calyxes, even as Larry had within the Moon Chamber.</p>

<p>A crack&mdash;horizontal, four feet wide&mdash;appeared on the
wall; widened, and as the sinking slab that made it dropped to
the level of our eyes, we looked through a hundred-feet-long rift
in the living rock! The stone fell steadily&mdash;and we saw that
it was a Cyclopean wedge set within the slit of the passageway.
It reached the level of our feet and stopped. At the far end of
this tunnel, whose floor was the polished rock that had, a moment
before, fitted hermetically into its roof, was a low, narrow
triangular opening through which light streamed.</p>

<p>"Nowhere to go but out!" grinned Larry. "And I'll bet Golden
Eyes is waiting for us with a taxi!" He stepped forward. We
followed, slipping, sliding along the glassy surface; and I, for
one, had a lively apprehension of what our fate would be should
that enormous mass rise before we had emerged! We reached the
end; crept out of the narrow triangle that was its exit.</p>

<p>We stood upon a wide ledge carpeted with a thick yellow moss.
I looked behind&mdash;and clutched O'Keefe's arm. The door
through which we had come had vanished! There was only a
precipice of pale rock, on whose surfaces great patches of the
amber moss hung; around whose base our ledge ran, and whose
summits, if summits it had, were hidden, like the luminous
cliffs, in the radiance above us.</p>

<p>"Nowhere to go but ahead&mdash;and Golden Eyes hasn't kept her
date!" laughed O'Keefe&mdash;but somewhat grimly.</p>

<p>We walked a few yards along the ledge and, rounding a corner,
faced the end of one of the slender bridges. From this vantage
point the oddly shaped vehicles were plain, and we could see they
were, indeed, like the shell of the Nautilus and elfinly
beautiful. Their drivers sat high upon the forward whorl. Their
bodies were piled high with cushions, upon which lay women
half-swathed in gay silken webs. From the pavilioned gardens
smaller channels of glistening green ran into the broad way, much
as automobile runways do on earth; and in and out of them flashed
the fairy shells.</p>

<p>There came a shout from one. Its occupants had glimpsed us.
They pointed; others stopped and stared; one shell turned and
sped up a runway&mdash;and quickly over the other side of the
bridge came a score of men. They were dwarfed&mdash;none of them
more than five feet high, prodigiously broad of shoulder, clearly
enormously powerful.</p>

<p><a title= "Norwegian: 'monsters', 'trolls'; Merritt uses the
Danish word 'trolde'"><i>"Trolle!"</i></a> muttered Olaf,
stepping beside O'Keefe, pistol swinging free in his hand.</p>

<p>But at the middle of the bridge the leader stopped, waved back
his men, and came toward us alone, palms outstretched in the
immemorial, universal gesture of truce. He paused, scanning us
with manifest wonder; we returned the scrutiny with interest. The
dwarf's face was as white as Olaf's&mdash; far whiter than those
of the other three of us; the features clean-cut and noble,
almost classical; the wide set eyes of a curious greenish grey
and the black hair curling over his head like that on some old
Greek statue.</p>

<p>Dwarfed though he was, there was no suggestion of deformity
about him. The gigantic shoulders were covered with a loose green
tunic that looked like fine linen. It was caught in at the waist
by a broad girdle studded with what seemed to be amazonites. In
it was thrust a long curved poniard resembling the Malaysian
kris. His legs were swathed in the same green cloth as the upper
garment. His feet were sandaled.</p>

<p>My gaze returned to his face, and in it I found something
subtly disturbing; an expression of half-malicious gaiety that
underlay the wholly prepossessing features like a vague threat; a
mocking deviltry that hinted at entire callousness to suffering
or sorrow; something of the spirit that was vaguely alien and
disquieting.</p>

<p>He spoke&mdash;and, to my surprise, enough of the words were
familiar to enable me clearly to catch the meaning of the whole.
They were Polynesian, the Polynesian of the Samoans which is its
most ancient form, but in some indefinable way&mdash;archaic.
Later I was to know that the tongue bore the same relation to the
Polynesian of today as does <i>not</i> that of Chaucer, but of
the Venerable Bede, to modern English. Nor was this to be so
astonishing, when with the knowledge came the certainty that it
was from it the language we call Polynesian sprang.</p>

<p>"From whence do you come, strangers&mdash;and how found you
your way here?" said the green dwarf.</p>

<p>I waved my hand toward the cliff behind us. His eyes narrowed
incredulously; he glanced at its drop, upon which even a mountain
goat could not have made its way, and laughed.</p>

<p>"We came through the rock," I answered his thought. "And we
come in peace," I added.</p>

<p>"And may peace walk with you," he said
half-derisively&mdash;"if the Shining One wills it!"</p>

<p>He considered us again.</p>

<p>"Show me, strangers, where you came through the rock," he
commanded. We led the way to where we had emerged from the well
of the stairway.</p>

<p>"It was here," I said, tapping the cliff.</p>

<p>"But I see no opening," he said suavely.</p>

<p>"It closed behind us," I answered; and then, for the first
time, realized how incredible the explanation sounded. The
derisive gleam passed through his eyes again. But he drew his
poniard and gravely sounded the rock.</p>

<p>"You give a strange turn to our speech," he said. "It sounds
strangely, indeed&mdash;as strange as your answers." He looked at
us quizzically. "I wonder where you learned it! Well, all that
you can explain to the Afyo Maie." His head bowed and his arms
swept out in a wide salaam. "Be pleased to come with me!" he
ended abruptly.</p>

<p>"In peace?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In peace," he replied&mdash;then slowly&mdash;"with me at
least."</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Doc!" cried Larry. "As long as we're here let's
see the sights. <a title="French: 'Come on, old
chap!'"><i>Allons, mon vieux!"</i></a> he called gaily to the
green dwarf. The latter, understanding the spirit, if not the
words, looked at O'Keefe with a twinkle of approval; turned then
to the great Norseman and scanned him with admiration; reached
out and squeezed one of the immense biceps.</p>

<p>"Lugur will welcome you, at least," he murmured as though to
himself. He stood aside and waved a hand courteously, inviting us
to pass. We crossed. At the base of the span one of the elfin
shells was waiting.</p>

<p>Beyond, scores had gathered, their occupants evidently
discussing us in much excitement. The green dwarf waved us to the
piles of cushions and then threw himself beside us. The vehicle
started off smoothly, the now silent throng making way, and swept
down the green roadway at a terrific pace and wholly without
vibration, toward the seven-terraced tower.</p>

<p>As we flew along I tried to discover the source of the power,
but I could not&mdash;then. There was no sign of mechanism, but
that the shell responded to some form of energy was
certain&mdash;the driver grasping a small lever which seemed to
control not only our speed, but our direction.</p>

<p>We turned abruptly and swept up a runway through one of the
gardens, and stopped softly before a pillared pavilion. I saw now
that these were much larger than I had thought. The structure to
which we had been carried covered, I estimated, fully an acre.
Oblong, with its slender, varicolored columns spaced regularly,
its walls were like the sliding screens of the
Japanese&mdash;shoji.</p>

<p>The green dwarf hurried us up a flight of broad steps flanked
by great carved serpents, winged and scaled. He stamped twice
upon mosaicked stones between two of the pillars, and a screen
rolled aside, revealing an immense hall scattered about with low
divans on which lolled a dozen or more of the dwarfish men,
dressed identically as he.</p>

<p>They sauntered up to us leisurely; the surprised interest in
their faces tempered by the same inhumanly gay malice that seemed
to be characteristic of all these people we had as yet seen.</p>

<p>"The Afyo Maie awaits them, Rador," said one.</p>

<p>The green dwarf nodded, beckoned us, and led the way through
the great hall and into a smaller chamber whose far side was
covered with the opacity I had noted from the aerie of the cliff.
I examined the&mdash;blackness &mdash;with lively interest.</p>

<p>It had neither substance nor texture; it was not
matter&mdash;and yet it suggested solidity; an entire cessation,
a complete absorption of light; an ebon veil at once immaterial
and palpable. I stretched, involuntarily, my hand out toward it,
and felt it quickly drawn back.</p>

<p>"Do you seek your end so soon?" whispered Rador. "But I
forget&mdash;you do not know," he added. "On your life touch not
the blackness, ever. It&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped, for abruptly in the density a portal appeared;
swinging out of the shadow like a picture thrown by a lantern
upon a screen. Through it was revealed a chamber filled with a
soft rosy glow. Rising from cushioned couches, a woman and a man
regarded us, half leaning over a long, low table of what seemed
polished jet, laden with flowers and unfamiliar fruits.</p>

<p>About the room&mdash;that part of it, at least, that I could
see&mdash; were a few oddly shaped chairs of the same substance.
On high, silvery tripods three immense globes stood, and it was
from them that the rose glow emanated. At the side of the woman
was a smaller globe whose roseate gleam was tempered by quivering
waves of blue.</p>

<p>"Enter Rador with the strangers!" a clear, sweet voice
called.</p>

<p>Rador bowed deeply and stood aside, motioning us to pass. We
entered, the green dwarf behind us, and out of the corner of my
eye I saw the doorway fade as abruptly as it had appeared and
again the dense shadow fill its place.</p>

<p>"Come closer, strangers. Be not afraid!" commanded the
bell-toned voice.</p>

<p>We approached.</p>

<p>The woman, sober scientist that I am, made the breath catch in
my throat. Never had I seen a woman so beautiful as was Yolara of
the Dweller's city &mdash;and none of so perilous a beauty. Her
hair was of the color of the young tassels of the corn and coiled
in a regal crown above her broad, white brows; her wide eyes were
of grey that could change to a cornflower blue and in anger
deepen to purple; grey or blue, they had little laughing devils
within them, but when the storm of anger darkened them&mdash;they
were not laughing, no! The silken webs that half covered, half
revealed her did not hide the ivory whiteness of her flesh nor
the sweet curve of shoulders and breasts. But for all her amazing
beauty, she was&mdash;sinister! There was cruelty about the
curving mouth, and in the music of her voice&mdash;not conscious
cruelty, but the more terrifying, careless cruelty of nature
itself.</p>

<p>The girl of the rose wall had been beautiful, yes! But her
beauty was human, understandable. You could imagine her with a
babe in her arms&mdash; but you could not so imagine this woman.
About her loveliness hovered something unearthly. A sweet
feminine echo of the Dweller was Yolara, the Dweller's
priestess&mdash;and as gloriously, terrifyingly evil!</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a>14. &mdash; THE JUSTICE OF
LORA</h2>

<p class="first">As I looked at her the man arose and made his
way round the table toward us. For the first time my eyes took in
Lugur. A few inches taller than the green dwarf, he was far
broader, more filled with the suggestion of appalling
strength.</p>

<p>The tremendous shoulders were four feet wide if an inch,
tapering down to mighty thewed thighs. The muscles of his chest
stood out beneath his tunic of red. Around his forehead shone a
chaplet of bright-blue stones, sparkling among the thick curls of
his silver-ash hair.</p>

<p>Upon his face pride and ambition were written large&mdash;and
power still larger. All the mockery, the malice, the hint of
callous indifference that I had noted in the other dwarfish men
were there, too&mdash;but intensified, touched with the
satanic.</p>

<p>The woman spoke again.</p>

<p>"Who are you strangers, and how came you here?" She turned to
Rador. "Or is it that they do not understand our tongue?"</p>

<p>"One understands and speaks it&mdash;but very badly, O
Yolara," answered the green dwarf.</p>

<p>"Speak, then, that one of you," she commanded.</p>

<p>But it was Marakinoff who found his voice first, and I
marvelled at the fluency, so much greater than mine, with which
he spoke.</p>

<p>"We came for different purposes. I to seek knowledge of a
kind; he" &mdash;pointing to me "of another. This man"&mdash;he
looked at Olaf &mdash;"to find a wife and child."</p>

<p>The grey-blue eyes had been regarding O'Keefe steadily and
with plainly increasing interest.</p>

<p>"And why did <i>you</i> come?" she asked him. "Nay&mdash;I
would have him speak for himself, if he can," she stilled
Marakinoff peremptorily.</p>

<p>When Larry spoke it was haltingly, in the tongue that was
strange to him, searching for the proper words.</p>

<p>"I came to help these men&mdash;and because something I could
not then understand called me, O lady, whose eyes are like forest
pools at dawn," he answered; and even in the unfamiliar words
there was a touch of the Irish brogue, and little merry lights
danced in the eyes Larry had so apostrophized.</p>

<p>"I could find fault with your speech, but none with its
burden," she said. "What forest pools are I know not, and the
dawn has not shone upon the people of Lora these many <i>sais</i>
of <i>laya</i>.* But I sense what you mean!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Later I was to find that Murian reckoning
rested upon the extraordinary increased luminosity of the cliffs
at the time of full moon on earth&mdash;this action, to my mind,
being linked either with the effect of the light-streaming globes
upon the Moon Pool, whose source was in the shining cliffs, or
else upon some mysterious affinity of their radiant element with
the flood of moonlight on earth&mdash;the latter, most probably,
because even when the moon must have been clouded above, it made
no difference in the phenomenon. Thirteen of these shinings forth
constituted a <i>laya</i>, one of them a <i>lat</i>. Ten was
<i>sa</i>; ten times ten times ten a <i>said</i>, or thousand;
ten times a thousand was a <i>sais</i>. A <i>sais</i> of
<i>laya</i> was then literally ten thousand years. What we would
call an hour was by them called a <i>va</i>. The whole time
system was, of course, a mingling of time as it had been known to
their remote, surface-dwelling ancestors, and the peculiar
determining factors in the vast cavern. Unquestionably there is a
subtle difference between time as we know it and time in this
subterranean land&mdash;its progress there being slower. This,
however, is only in accord with the well-known doctrine of
relativity, which predicates both space and time as necessary
inventions of the human mind to orient itself to the conditions
under which it finds itself. I tried often to measure this
difference, but could never do so to my entire satisfaction. The
closest I can come to it is to say that an hour of our time is
the equivalent of an hour and five-eighths in Muria. For further
information upon this matter of relativity the reader may consult
any of the numerous books upon the subject.&mdash;W.T.G. ]</p>

<p>The eyes deepened to blue as she regarded him. She smiled.</p>

<p>"Are there many like you in the world from which you come?"
she asked softly. "Well, we soon shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lugur interrupted her almost rudely and glowering.</p>

<p>"Best we should know how they came hence," he growled.</p>

<p>She darted a quick look at him, and again the little devils
danced in her wondrous eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," she said. "How came you here?"</p>

<p>Again it was Marakinoff who answered&mdash;slowly, considering
every word.</p>

<p>"In the world above," he said, "there are ruins of cities not
built by any of those who now dwell there. To us these places
called, and we sought for knowledge of the wise ones who made
them. We found a passageway. The way led us downward to a door in
yonder cliff, and through it we came here."</p>

<p>"Then have you found what you sought?" spoke she. "For we are
of those who built the cities. But this gateway in the
rock&mdash;where is it?"</p>

<p>"After we passed, it closed upon us; nor could we after find
trace of it," answered Marakinoff.</p>

<p>The incredulity that had shown upon the face of the green
dwarf fell upon theirs; on Lugur's it was clouded with furious
anger.</p>

<p>He turned to Rador.</p>

<p>"I could find no opening, lord," said the green dwarf
quickly.</p>

<p>And there was so fierce a fire in the eyes of Lugur as he
swung back upon us that O'Keefe's hand slipped stealthily down
toward his pistol.</p>

<p>"Best it is to speak truth to Yolara, priestess of the Shining
One, and to Lugur, the Voice," he cried menacingly.</p>

<p>"It is the truth," I interposed. "We came down the passage. At
its end was a carved vine, a vine of five flowers"&mdash;the fire
died from the red dwarf's eyes, and I could have sworn to a swift
pallor. "I rested a hand upon these flowers, and a door opened.
But when we had gone through it and turned, behind us was nothing
but unbroken cliff. The door had vanished."</p>

<p>I had taken my cue from Marakinoff. If he had eliminated the
episode of car and Moon Pool, he had good reason, I had no doubt;
and I would be as cautious. And deep within me something
cautioned me to say nothing of my quest; to stifle all thought of
Throckmartin&mdash;something that warned, peremptorily, finally,
as though it were a message from Throckmartin himself!</p>

<p>"A vine with five flowers!" exclaimed the red dwarf. "Was it
like this, say?"</p>

<p>He thrust forward a long arm. Upon the thumb of the hand was
an immense ring, set with a dull-blue stone. Graven on the face
of the jewel was the symbol of the rosy walls of the Moon Chamber
that had opened to us their two portals. But cut over the vine
were seven circles, one about each of the flowers and two larger
ones covering, intersecting them.</p>

<p>"This is the same," I said; "but these were not there"&mdash;I
indicated the circles.</p>

<p>The woman drew a deep breath and looked deep into Lugur's
eyes.</p>

<p>"The sign of the Silent Ones!" he half whispered.</p>

<p>It was the woman who first recovered herself.</p>

<p>"The strangers are weary, Lugur," she said. "When they are
rested they shall show where the rocks opened."</p>

<p>I sensed a subtle change in their attitude toward us; a new
intentness; a doubt plainly tinged with apprehension. What was it
they feared? Why had the symbol of the vine wrought the change?
And who or what were the Silent Ones?</p>

<p>Yolara's eyes turned to Olaf, hardened, and grew cold grey.
Subconsciously I had noticed that from the first the Norseman had
been absorbed in his regard of the pair; had, indeed, never taken
his gaze from them; had noticed, too, the priestess dart swift
glances toward him.</p>

<p>He returned her scrutiny fearlessly, a touch of contempt in
the clear eyes &mdash;like a child watching a snake which he did
not dread, but whose danger be well knew.</p>

<p>Under that look Yolara stirred impatiently, sensing, I know,
its meaning.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so?" she cried.</p>

<p>An expression of bewilderment passed over Olaf's face.</p>

<p>"I do not understand," he said in English.</p>

<p>I caught a quickly repressed gleam in O'Keefe's eyes. He knew,
as I knew, that Olaf must have understood. But did
Marakinoff?</p>

<p>Apparently he did not. But why was Olaf feigning
ignorance?</p>

<p>"This man is a sailor from what we call the North," thus Larry
haltingly. "He is crazed, I think. He tells a strange tale of a
something of cold fire that took his wife and babe. We found him
wandering where we were. And because he is strong we brought him
with us. That is all, O lady, whose voice is sweeter than the
honey of the wild bees!"</p>

<p>"A shape of cold fire?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"A shape of cold fire that whirled beneath the moon, with the
sound of little bells," answered Larry, watching her
intently.</p>

<p>She looked at Lugur and laughed.</p>

<p>"Then he, too, is fortunate," she said. "For he has come to
the place of his something of cold fire&mdash;and tell him that
he shall join his wife and child, in time; that I promise
him."</p>

<p>Upon the Norseman's face there was no hint of comprehension,
and at that moment I formed an entirely new opinion of Olaf's
intelligence; for certainly it must have been a prodigious effort
of the will, indeed, that enabled him, understanding, to control
himself.</p>

<p>"What does she say?" he asked.</p>

<p>Larry repeated.</p>

<p>"Good!" said Olaf. "Good!"</p>

<p>He looked at Yolara with well-assumed gratitude. Lugur, who
had been scanning his bulk, drew close. He felt the giant muscles
which Huldricksson accommodatingly flexed for him.</p>

<p>"But he shall meet Valdor and Tahola before he sees those kin
of his," he laughed mockingly. "And if he bests them&mdash;for
reward&mdash;his wife and babe!"</p>

<p>A shudder, quickly repressed, shook the seaman's frame. The
woman bent her supremely beautiful head.</p>

<p>"These two," she said, pointing to the Russian and to me,
"seem to be men of learning. They may be useful. As for this
man,"&mdash;she smiled at Larry&mdash;"I would have him explain
to me some things." She hesitated. "What 'hon-ey of 'e wild
bees-s' is." Larry had spoken the words in English, and she was
trying to repeat them. "As for this man, the sailor, do as you
please with him, Lugur; always remembering that I have given my
word that he shall join that wife and babe of his!" She laughed
sweetly, sinisterly. "And now&mdash;take them, Rador&mdash;give
them food and drink and let them rest till we shall call them
again."</p>

<p>She stretched out a hand toward O'Keefe. The Irishman bowed
low over it, raised it softly to his lips. There was a vicious
hiss from Lugur; but Yolara regarded Larry with eyes now all
tender blue.</p>

<p>"You please me," she whispered.</p>

<p>And the face of Lugur grew darker.</p>

<p>We turned to go. The rosy, azure-shot globe at her side
suddenly dulled. From it came a faint bell sound as of chimes far
away. She bent over it. It vibrated, and then its surface ran
with little waves of dull color; from it came a whispering so low
that I could not distinguish the words&mdash;if words they
were.</p>

<p>She spoke to the red dwarf.</p>

<p>"They have brought the three who blasphemed the Shining One,"
she said slowly. "Now it is in my mind to show these strangers
the justice of Lora. What say you, Lugur?"</p>

<p>The red dwarf nodded, his eyes sparkling with a malicious
anticipation.</p>

<p>The woman spoke again to the globe. "Bring them here!"</p>

<p>And again it ran swiftly with its film of colors, darkened,
and shone rosy once more. From without there came a rustle of
many feet upon the rugs. Yolara pressed a slender hand upon the
base of the pedestal of the globe beside her. Abruptly the light
faded from all, and on the same instant the four walls of
blackness vanished, revealing on two sides the lovely, unfamiliar
garden through the guarding rows of pillars; at our backs soft
draperies hid what lay beyond; before us, flanked by flowered
screens, was the corridor through which we had entered, crowded
now by the green dwarfs of the great hall.</p>

<p>The dwarfs advanced. Each, I now noted, had the same
clustering black hair of Rador. They separated, and from them
stepped three figures&mdash;a youth of not more than twenty,
short, but with the great shoulders of all the males we had seen
of this race; a girl of seventeen, I judged, white-faced, a head
taller than the boy, her long, black hair disheveled; and behind
these two a stunted, gnarled shape whose head was sunk deep
between the enormous shoulders, whose white beard fell like that
of some ancient gnome down to his waist, and whose eyes were a
white flame of hate. The girl cast herself weeping at the feet of
the priestess; the youth regarded her curiously.</p>

<p>"You are Songar of the Lower Waters?" murmured Yolara almost
caressingly. "And this is your daughter and her lover?"</p>

<p>The gnome nodded, the flame in his eyes leaping higher.</p>

<p>"It has come to me that you three have dared blaspheme the
Shining One, its priestess, and its Voice," went on Yolara
smoothly. "Also that you have called out to the three Silent
Ones. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"Your spies have spoken&mdash;and have you not already judged
us?" The voice of the old dwarf was bitter.</p>

<p>A flicker shot through the eyes of Yolara, again cold grey.
The girl reached a trembling hand out to the hem of the
priestess's veils.</p>

<p>"Tell us why you did these things, Songar," she said. "Why you
did them, knowing full well what your&mdash;reward&mdash;would
be."</p>

<p>The dwarf stiffened; he raised his withered arms, and his eyes
blazed.</p>

<p>"Because evil are your thoughts and evil are your deeds," he
cried. "Yours and your lover's, there"&mdash;he levelled a finger
at Lugur. "Because of the Shining One you have made evil, too,
and the greater wickedness you contemplate&mdash;you and he with
the Shining One. But I tell you that your measure of iniquity is
full; the tale of your sin near ended! Yea&mdash;the Silent Ones
have been patient, but soon they will speak." He pointed at us.
"A sign are <i>they</i>&mdash;a warning&mdash;harlot!" He spat
the word.</p>

<p>In Yolara's eyes, grown black, the devils leaped
unrestrained.</p>

<p>"Is it even so, Songar?" her voice caressed. "Now ask the
Silent Ones to help you! They sit afar&mdash;but surely they will
hear you." The sweet voice was mocking. "As for these two, they
shall pray to the Shining One for forgiveness&mdash;and surely
the Shining One will take them to its bosom! As for you&mdash;you
have lived long enough, Songar! Pray to the Silent Ones, Songar,
and pass out into the nothingness&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>She dipped down into her bosom and drew forth something that
resembled a small cone of tarnished silver. She levelled it, a
covering clicked from its base, and out of it darted a slender
ray of intense green light.</p>

<p>It struck the old dwarf squarely over the heart, and spread
swift as light itself, covering him with a gleaming, pale film.
She clenched her hand upon the cone, and the ray disappeared. She
thrust the cone back into her breast and leaned forward
expectantly; so Lugur and so the other dwarfs. From the girl came
a low wail of anguish; the boy dropped upon his knees, covering
his face.</p>

<p>For the moment the white beard stood rigid; then the robe that
had covered him seemed to melt away, revealing all the knotted,
monstrous body. And in that body a vibration began, increasing to
incredible rapidity. It wavered before us like a reflection in a
still pond stirred by a sudden wind. It grew and grew&mdash;to a
rhythm whose rapidity was intolerable to watch and that still
chained the eyes.</p>

<p>The figure grew indistinct, misty. Tiny sparks in infinite
numbers leaped from it&mdash;like, I thought, the radiant shower
of particles hurled out by radium when seen under the microscope.
Mistier still it grew&mdash;there trembled before us for a moment
a faintly luminous shadow which held, here and there, tiny
sparkling atoms like those that pulsed in the light about us! The
glowing shadow vanished, the sparkling atoms were still for a
moment &mdash;and shot away, joining those dancing others.</p>

<p>Where the gnomelike form had been but a few seconds
before&mdash;there was nothing!</p>

<p>O'Keefe drew a long breath, and I was sensible of a prickling
along my scalp.</p>

<p>Yolara leaned toward us.</p>

<p>"You have seen," she said. Her eyes lingered tigerishly upon
Olaf's pallid face. "Heed!" she whispered. She turned to the men
in green, who were laughing softly among themselves.</p>

<p>"Take these two, and go!" she commanded.</p>

<p>"The justice of Lora," said the red dwarf. "The justice of
Lora and the Shining One under Thanaroa!"</p>

<p>Upon the utterance of the last word I saw Marakinoff start
violently. The hand at his side made a swift, surreptitious
gesture, so fleeting that I hardly caught it. The red dwarf
stared at the Russian, and there was amazement upon his face.</p>

<p>Swiftly as Marakinoff, he returned it.</p>

<p>"Yolara," the red dwarf spoke, "it would please me to take
this man of wisdom to my own place for a time. The giant I would
have, too."</p>

<p>The woman awoke from her brooding; nodded.</p>

<p>"As you will, Lugur," she said.</p>

<p>And as, shaken to the core, we passed out into the garden into
the full throbbing of the light, I wondered if all the tiny
sparkling diamond points that shook about us had once been men
like Songar of the Lower Waters&mdash; and felt my very soul grow
sick!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>15. &mdash; THE ANGRY,
WHISPERING GLOBE</h2>

<p class="first">Our way led along a winding path between banked
masses of softly radiant blooms, groups of feathery ferns whose
plumes were starred with fragrant white and blue flowerets,
slender creepers swinging from the branches of the strangely
trunked trees, bearing along their threads orchid-like blossoms
both delicately frail and gorgeously flamboyant.</p>

<p>The path we trod was an exquisite mosaic&mdash;pastel greens
and pinks upon a soft grey base, garlands of nimbused forms like
the flaming rose of the Rosicrucians held in the mouths of the
flying serpents. A smaller pavilion arose before us,
single-storied, front wide open.</p>

<p>Upon its threshold Rador paused, bowed deeply, and motioned us
within. The chamber we entered was large, closed on two sides by
screens of grey; at the back gay, concealing curtains. The low
table of blue stone, dressed with fine white cloths, stretched at
one side flanked by the cushioned divans.</p>

<p>At the left was a high tripod bearing one of the rosy globes
we had seen in the house of Yolara; at the head of the table a
smaller globe similar to the whispering one. Rador pressed upon
its base, and two other screens slid into place across the
entrance, shutting in the room.</p>

<p>He clapped his hands; the curtains parted, and two girls came
through them. Tall and willow lithe, their bluish-black hair
falling in ringlets just below their white shoulders, their clear
eyes of forget-me-not blue, and skins of extraordinary fineness
and purity&mdash;they were singularly attractive. Each was clad
in an extremely scanty bodice of silken blue, girdled above a
kirtle that came barely to their very pretty knees.</p>

<p>"Food and drink," ordered Rador.</p>

<p>They dropped back through the curtains.</p>

<p>"Do you like them?" he asked us.</p>

<p>"Some chickens!" said Larry. "They delight the heart," he
translated for Rador.</p>

<p>The green dwarf's next remark made me gasp.</p>

<p>"They are yours," he said.</p>

<p>Before I could question him further upon this extraordinary
statement the pair re-entered, bearing a great platter on which
were small loaves, strange fruits, and three immense flagons of
rock crystal&mdash;two filled with a slightly sparkling yellow
liquid and the third with a purplish drink. I became acutely
sensible that it had been hours since I had either eaten or
drunk. The yellow flagons were set before Larry and me, the
purple at Rador's hand.</p>

<p>The girls, at his signal, again withdrew. I raised my glass to
my lips and took a deep draft. The taste was unfamiliar but
delightful.</p>

<p>Almost at once my fatigue disappeared. I realized a clarity of
mind, an interesting exhilaration and sense of irresponsibility,
of freedom from care, that were oddly enjoyable. Larry became
immediately his old gay self.</p>

<p>The green dwarf regarded us whimsically, sipping from his
great flagon of rock crystal.</p>

<p>"Much do I desire to know of that world you came from," he
said at last &mdash;"through the rocks," he added, slyly.</p>

<p>"And much do we desire to know of this world of yours, O
Rador," I answered.</p>

<p>Should I ask him of the Dweller; seek from him a clue to
Throckmartin? Again, clearly as a spoken command, came the
warning to forbear, to wait. And once more I obeyed.</p>

<p>"Let us learn, then, from each other." The dwarf was laughing.
"And first &mdash;are all above like you&mdash;drawn
out"&mdash;he made an expressive gesture&mdash;"and are there
many of you?"</p>

<p>"There are&mdash;" I hesitated, and at last spoke the
Polynesian that means tens upon tens multiplied
indefinitely&mdash;"there are as many as the drops of water in
the lake we saw from the ledge where you found us," I continued;
"many as the leaves on the trees without. And they are all like
us &mdash;varyingly."</p>

<p>He considered skeptically, I could see, my remark upon our
numbers.</p>

<p>"In Muria," he said at last, "the men are like me or like
Lugur. Our women are as you see them&mdash;like Yolara or those
two who served you." He hesitated. "And there is a third; but
only one."</p>

<p>Larry leaned forward eagerly.</p>

<p>"Brown-haired with glints of ruddy bronze, golden-eyed, and
lovely as a dream, with long, slender, beautiful hands?" he
cried.</p>

<p>"Where saw you <i>her</i>?" interrupted the dwarf, starting to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Saw her?" Larry recovered himself. "Nay, Rador, perhaps, I
only dreamed that there was such a woman."</p>

<p>"See to it, then, that you tell not your dream to Yolara,"
said the dwarf grimly. "For her I meant and her you have pictured
is Lakla, the hand-maiden to the Silent Ones, and neither Yolara
nor Lugur, nay, nor the Shining One, love her overmuch,
stranger."</p>

<p>"Does she dwell here?" Larry's face was alight.</p>

<p>The dwarf hesitated, glanced about him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Nay," he answered, "ask me no more of her." He was silent for
a space. "And what do you who are as leaves or drops of water do
in that world of yours?" he said, plainly bent on turning the
subject.</p>

<p>"Keep off the golden-eyed girl, Larry," I interjected. "Wait
till we find out why she's tabu."</p>

<p>"Love and battle, strive and accomplish and die; or fail and
die," answered Larry&mdash;to Rador&mdash;giving me a quick nod
of acquiescence to my warning in English.</p>

<p>"In that at least your world and mine differ little," said the
dwarf.</p>

<p>"How great is this world of yours, Rador?" I spoke.</p>

<p>He considered me gravely.</p>

<p>"How great indeed I do not know," he said frankly at last.
"The land where we dwell with the Shining One stretches along the
white waters for&mdash;" He used a phrase of which I could make
nothing. "Beyond this city of the Shining One and on the hither
shores of the white waters dwell the <i>mayia
ladala</i>&mdash;the common ones." He took a deep draft from his
flagon. "There are, first, the fair-haired ones, the children of
the ancient rulers," he continued. "There are, second, we the
soldiers; and last, the <i>mayia ladala</i>, who dig and till and
weave and toil and give our rulers and us their daughters, and
dance with the Shining One!" he added.</p>

<p>"Who rules?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The fair-haired, under the Council of Nine, who are under
Yolara, the Priestess and Lugur, the Voice," he answered, "who
are in turn beneath the Shining One!" There was a ring of bitter
satire in the last.</p>

<p>"And those three who were judged?"&mdash;this from Larry.</p>

<p>"They were of the <i>mayia ladala</i>," he replied, "like
those two I gave you. But they grow restless. They do not like to
dance with the Shining One &mdash;the blasphemers!" He raised his
voice in a sudden great shout of mocking laughter.</p>

<p>In his words I caught a fleeting picture of the race&mdash;an
ancient, luxurious, close-bred oligarchy clustered about some
mysterious deity; a soldier class that supported them; and
underneath all the toiling, oppressed hordes.</p>

<p>"And is that all?" asked Larry.</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "There is the Sea of Crimson
where&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without warning the globe beside us sent out a vicious note,
Rador turned toward it, his face paling. Its surface crawled with
whisperings&mdash; angry, peremptory!</p>

<p>"I hear!" he croaked, gripping the table. "I obey!"</p>

<p>He turned to us a face devoid for once of its malice.</p>

<p>"Ask me no more questions, strangers," he said. "And now, if
you are done, I will show you where you may sleep and bathe."</p>

<p>He arose abruptly. We followed him through the hangings,
passed through a corridor and into another smaller chamber,
roofless, the sides walled with screens of dark grey. Two
cushioned couches were there and a curtained door leading into an
open, outer enclosure in which a fountain played within a wide
pool.</p>

<p>"Your bath," said Rador. He dropped the curtain and came back
into the room. He touched a carved flower at one side. There was
a tiny sighing from overhead and instantly across the top spread
a veil of blackness, impenetrable to light but certainly not to
air, for through it pulsed little breaths of the garden
fragrances. The room filled with a cool twilight, refreshing,
sleep-inducing. The green dwarf pointed to the couches.</p>

<p>"Sleep!" he said. "Sleep and fear nothing. My men are on guard
outside." He came closer to us, the old mocking gaiety sparkling
in his eyes.</p>

<p>"But I spoke too quickly," he whispered. "Whether it is
because the Afyo Maie fears their tongues&mdash;or&mdash;" he
laughed at Larry. "The maids are <i>not</i> yours!" Still
laughing he vanished through the curtains of the room of the
fountain before I could ask him the meaning of his curious gift,
its withdrawal, and his most enigmatic closing remarks.</p>

<p>"Back in the great old days of Ireland," thus Larry breaking
into my thoughts raptly, the brogue thick, "there was Cairill mac
Cairill&mdash; Cairill Swiftspear. An' Cairill wronged Keevan of
Emhain Abhlach, of the blood of Angus of the great people when he
was sleeping in the likeness of a pale reed. Then Keevan put this
penance on Cairill&mdash;that for a year Cairill should wear his
body in Emhain Abhlach, which is the Land of Faery and for that
year Keevan should wear the body of Cairill. And it was done.</p>

<p>"In that year Cairill met Emar of the Birds that are one
white, one red, and one black&mdash;and they loved, and from that
love sprang Ailill their son. And when Ailill was born he took a
reed flute and first he played slumber on Cairill, and then he
played old age so that Cairill grew white and withered; then
Ailill played again and Cairill became a shadow&mdash;then a
shadow of a shadow&mdash;then a breath; and the breath went out
upon the wind!" He shivered. "Like the old gnome," he whispered,
"that they called Songar of the Lower Waters!"</p>

<p>He shook his head as though he cast a dream from him. Then,
all alert&mdash;</p>

<p>"But that was in Iceland ages agone. And there's nothing like
that here, Doc!" He laughed. "It doesn't scare me one little bit,
old boy. The pretty devil lady's got the wrong slant. When you've
had a pal standing beside you one moment&mdash;full of life, and
joy, and power, and potentialities, telling what he's going to do
to make the world hum when he gets through the slaughter, just
running over with zip and pep of life, Doc&mdash;and the next
instant, right in the middle of a laugh&mdash;a piece of damned
shell takes off half his head and with it joy and power and all
the rest of it" &mdash;his face twitched&mdash;"well, old man, in
the face of <i>that</i> mystery a disappearing act such as the
devil lady treated us to doesn't make much of a dent. Not on me.
But by the brogans of <a title= "Irish king (1002-1014) who spent
most of his life fighting the Danes and the Norse. He was killed
after the final defeat of a Danish coalition, which ended Norse
power in Ireland."> Brian Boru</a>&mdash;if we could have had
some of that stuff to turn on during the war&mdash;oh, boy!"</p>

<p>He was silent, evidently contemplating the idea with vast
pleasure. And as for me, at that moment my last doubt of Larry
O'Keefe vanished, I saw that he did believe, really believed, in
his <a title= "female spirits in Gaelic folklore believed to
presage, by wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshees</i></a>,
his <a title= "a race of elves in Irish folklore who can reveal
hidden treasure to those who catch them"> <i>leprechauns</i></a>
and all the old dreams of the Gael&mdash;but only within the
limits of Ireland.</p>

<p>In one drawer of his mind was packed all his superstition, his
mysticism, and what of weakness it might carry. But face him with
any peril or problem and the drawer closed instantaneously
leaving a mind that was utterly fearless, incredulous, and
ingenious; swept clean of all cobwebs by as fine a skeptic broom
as ever brushed a brain.</p>

<p>"Some stuff!" Deepest admiration was in his voice. "If we'd
only had it when the war was on&mdash;imagine half a dozen of us
scooting over the enemy batteries and the gunners underneath all
at once beginning to shake themselves to pieces! Wow!" His tone
was rapturous.</p>

<p>"It's easy enough to explain, Larry," I said. "The effect,
that is&mdash; for what the green ray is made of I don't know, of
course. But what it does, clearly, is stimulate atomic vibration
to such a pitch that the cohesion between the particles of matter
is broken and the body flies to bits&mdash; just as a fly-wheel
does when its speed gets so great that the particles of which
<i>it</i> is made can't hold together."</p>

<p>"Shake themselves to pieces is right, then!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Absolutely right," I nodded. "Everything in Nature vibrates.
And all matter&mdash;whether man or beast or stone or metal or
vegetable&mdash;is made up of vibrating molecules, which are made
up of vibrating atoms which are made up of truly infinitely small
particles of electricity called electrons, and electrons, the
base of all matter, are themselves perhaps only a vibration of
the mysterious ether.</p>

<p>"If a magnifying glass of sufficient size and strength could
be placed over us we could see ourselves as sieves&mdash;our
space lattice, as it is called. And all that is necessary to
break down the lattice, to shake us into nothingness, is some
agent that will set our atoms vibrating at such a rate that at
last they escape the unseen cords and fly off.</p>

<p>"The green ray of Yolara is such an agent. It set up in the
dwarf that incredibly rapid rhythm that you saw and&mdash;shook
him not to atoms &mdash;but to electrons!"</p>

<p>"They had a gun on the West Front&mdash;a seventy-five," said
O'Keefe, "that broke the eardrums of everybody who fired it, no
matter what protection they used. It looked like all the other
seventy-fives&mdash;but there was something about its sound that
did it. They had to recast it."</p>

<p>"It's practically the same thing," I replied. "By some freak
its vibratory qualities had that effect. The deep whistle of the
sunken Lusitania would, for instance, make the Singer Building
shake to its foundations; while the Olympic did not affect the
Singer at all but made the Woolworth shiver all through. In each
case they stimulated the atomic vibration of the particular
building&mdash;"</p>

<p>I paused, aware all at once of an intense drowsiness. O'Keefe,
yawning, reached down to unfasten his puttees.</p>

<p>"Lord, I'm sleepy!" he exclaimed. "Can't understand
it&mdash;what you say&mdash;most&mdash;interesting&mdash;Lord!"
he yawned again; straightened. "What made Reddy take such a shine
to the Russian?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Thanaroa," I answered, fighting to keep my eyes open.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"When Lugur spoke that name I saw Marakinoff signal him.
Thanaroa is, I suspect, the original form of the name of
Tangaroa, the greatest god of the Polynesians. There's a secret
cult to him in the islands. Marakinoff may belong to it&mdash;he
knows it anyway. Lugur recognized the signal and despite his
surprise answered it."</p>

<p>"So he gave him the high sign, eh?" mused Larry. "How could
they both know it?"</p>

<p>"The cult is a very ancient one. Undoubtedly it had its origin
in the dim beginnings before these people migrated here," I
replied. "It's a link &mdash;one&mdash;of the few links between
up there and the lost past&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Trouble then," mumbled Larry. "Hell brewing! I smell
it&mdash;Say, Doc, is this sleepiness natural? Wonder where
my&mdash;gas mask&mdash; is&mdash;" he added, half
incoherently.</p>

<p>But I myself was struggling desperately against the drugged
slumber pressing down upon me.</p>

<p>"Lakla!" I heard O'Keefe murmur. "Lakla of the golden
eyes&mdash;no Eilidh&mdash;the Fair!" He made an immense effort,
half raised himself, grinned faintly.</p>

<p>"Thought this was paradise when I first saw it, Doc," he
sighed. "But I know now, if it is, No-Man's Land was the greatest
place on earth for a honeymoon. They&mdash;they've got us,
Doc&mdash;" He sank back. "Good luck, old boy, wherever you're
going." His hand waved feebly. "Glad&mdash;knew &mdash;you.
Hope&mdash;see&mdash;you&mdash;'gain&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice trailed into silence. Fighting, fighting with every
fiber of brain and nerve against the sleep, I felt myself being
steadily overcome. Yet before oblivion rushed down upon me I
seemed to see upon the grey-screened wall nearest the Irishman an
oval of rosy light begin to glow; watched, as my falling lids
inexorably fell, a flame-tipped shadow waver on it; thicken;
condense&mdash;and there looking down upon Larry, her eyes great
golden stars in which intensest curiosity and shy tenderness
struggled, sweet mouth half smiling, was the girl of the Moon
Pool's Chamber, the girl whom the green dwarf had named
Lakla&mdash;the vision Larry had invoked before that sleep which
I could no longer deny had claimed him&mdash;</p>

<p>Closer she came&mdash;closer&mdash;the eyes were over us.</p>

<p>Then oblivion indeed!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>16. &mdash; YOLARA OF MURIA
VS. THE O'KEEFE</h2>

<p class="first">I awakened with all the familiar, homely
sensation of a shade having been pulled up in a darkened room. I
thrilled with a wonderful sense of deep rest and restored
resiliency. The ebon shadow had vanished from above and down into
the room was pouring the silvery light. From the fountain pool
came a mighty splashing and shouts of laughter. I jumped and drew
the curtain. O'Keefe and Rador were swimming a wild race; the
dwarf like an otter, out-distancing and playing around the
Irishman at will.</p>

<p>Had that overpowering sleep&mdash;and now I confess that my
struggle against it had been largely inspired by fear that it was
the abnormal slumber which Throckmartin had described as having
heralded the approach of the Dweller before it had carried away
Thora and Stanton&mdash;had that sleep been after all nothing but
natural reaction of tired nerves and brains?</p>

<p>And that last vision of the golden-eyed girl bending over
Larry? Had that also been a delusion of an overstressed mind?
Well, it might have been, I could not tell. At any rate, I
decided, I would speak about it to O'Keefe once we were alone
again&mdash;and then giving myself up to the urge of buoyant
well-being I shouted like a boy, stripped and joined the two in
the pool. The water was warm and I felt the unwonted tingling of
life in every vein increase; something from it seemed to pulse
through the skin, carrying a clean vigorous vitality that toned
every fiber. Tiring at last, we swam to the edge and drew
ourselves out. The green dwarf quickly clothed himself and Larry
rather carefully donned his uniform.</p>

<p>"The Afyo Maie has summoned us, Doc," he said. "We're
to&mdash;well &mdash;I suppose you'd call it breakfast with her.
After that, Rador tells me, we're to have a session with the
Council of Nine. I suppose Yolara is as curious as any lady
of&mdash;the upper world, as you might put it&mdash; and just
naturally can't wait," he added.</p>

<p>He gave himself a last shake, patted the automatic hidden
under his left arm, whistled cheerfully,</p>

<p>"After you, my dear Alphonse," he said to Rador, with a low
bow. The dwarf laughed, bent in an absurd imitation of Larry's
mocking courtesy and started ahead of us to the house of the
priestess. When he had gone a little way on the orchid-walled
path I whispered to O'Keefe:</p>

<p>"Larry, when you were falling off to sleep&mdash;did you think
you saw anything?"</p>

<p>"See anything!" he grinned. "Doc, sleep hit me like a Hun
shell. I thought they were pulling the gas on us. I&mdash;I had
some intention of bidding you tender farewells," he continued,
half sheepishly. "I think I did start 'em, didn't I?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"But wait a minute&mdash;" he hesitated. "I had a queer sort
of dream&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'What was it?" I asked eagerly,</p>

<p>"Well," he answered slowly, "I suppose it was because I'd been
thinking of &mdash;Golden Eyes. Anyway, I thought she came
through the wall and leaned over me&mdash;yes, and put one of
those long white hands of hers on my head &mdash;I couldn't raise
my lids&mdash;but in some queer way I could see her. Then it got
real dreamish. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>Rador turned back toward us,</p>

<p>"Later," I answered, "Not now. When we're alone."</p>

<p>But through me went a little glow of reassurance. Whatever the
maze through which we were moving; whatever of menacing evil
lurking there&mdash; the Golden Girl was clearly watching over
us; watching with whatever unknown powers she could muster.</p>

<p>We passed the pillared entrance; went through a long bowered
corridor and stopped before a door that seemed to be sliced from
a monolith of pale jade &mdash;high, narrow, set in a wall of
opal.</p>

<p>Rador stamped twice and the same supernally sweet, silver bell
tones of &mdash;yesterday, I must call it, although in that place
of eternal day the term is meaningless&mdash;bade us enter. The
door slipped aside. The chamber was small, the opal walls
screening it on three sides, the black opacity covering it, the
fourth side opening out into a delicious little walled
garden&mdash;a mass of the fragrant, luminous blooms and
delicately colored fruit. Facing it was a small table of reddish
wood and from the omnipresent cushions heaped around it arose to
greet us&mdash;Yolara.</p>

<p>Larry drew in his breath with an involuntary gasp of
admiration and bowed low. My own admiration was as
frank&mdash;and the priestess was well pleased with our
homage.</p>

<p>She was swathed in the filmy, half-revealing webs, now of
palest blue. The corn-silk hair was caught within a wide-meshed
golden net in which sparkled tiny brilliants, like blended
sapphires and diamonds. Her own azure eyes sparkled as brightly
as they, and I noted again in their clear depths the half-eager
approval as they rested upon O'Keefe's lithe, well-knit figure
and his keen, clean-cut face. The high-arched, slender feet
rested upon soft sandals whose gauzy withes laced the exquisitely
formed leg to just below the dimpled knee.</p>

<p>"Some giddy wonder!" exclaimed Larry, looking at me and
placing a hand over his heart. "Put her on a New York roof and
she'd empty Broadway. Take the cue from me, Doc."</p>

<p>He turned to Yolara, whose face was somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>"I said, O lady whose shining hair is a web for hearts, that
in our world your beauty would dazzle the sight of men as would a
little woman sun!" he said, in the florid imagery to which the
tongue lends itself so well.</p>

<p>A flush stole up through the translucent skin. The blue eyes
softened and she waved us toward the cushions. Black-haired maids
stole in, placing before us the fruits, the little loaves and a
steaming drink somewhat the color and odor of chocolate. I was
conscious of outrageous hunger.</p>

<p>"What are you named, strangers?" she asked.</p>

<p>"This man is named Goodwin," said O'Keefe. "As for me, call me
Larry."</p>

<p>"Nothing like getting acquainted quick," he said to
me&mdash;but kept his eyes upon Yolara as though he were voicing
another honeyed phrase. And so she took it, for: "You must teach
me your tongue," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Then shall I have two words where now I have one to tell you
of your loveliness," he answered.</p>

<p>"And also that'll take time," he spoke to me. "Essential
occupation out of which we can't be drafted to make these
fun-loving folk any Roman holiday. Get me!"</p>

<p>"Larree," mused Yolara. "I like the sound. It is sweet&mdash;"
and indeed it was as she spoke it.</p>

<p>"And what is your land named, Larree?" she continued. "And
Goodwin's?" She caught the sound perfectly.</p>

<p>"My land, O lady of loveliness, is two&mdash;Ireland and
America; his but one&mdash;America."</p>

<p>She repeated the two names&mdash;slowly, over and over. We
seized the opportunity to attack the food; halting half guiltily
as she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you are hungry!" she cried. "Eat then." She leaned
her chin upon her hands and regarded us, whole fountains of
questions brimming up in her eyes.</p>

<p>"How is it, Larree, that you have two countries and Goodwin
but one?" she asked, at last unable to keep silent longer.</p>

<p>"I was born in Ireland; he in America. But I have dwelt long
in his land and my heart loves each," he said.</p>

<p>She nodded, understandingly.</p>

<p>"Are all the men of Ireland like you, Larree? As all the men
here are like Lugur or Rador? I like to look at you," she went
on, with naive frankness. "I am tired of men like Lugur and
Rador. But they are strong," she added, swiftly. "Lugur can hold
up ten in his two arms and raise six with but one hand."</p>

<p>We could not understand her numerals and she raised white
fingers to illustrate.</p>

<p>"That is little, O lady, to the men of Ireland," replied
O'Keefe. "Lo, I have seen one of my race hold up ten times ten of
our&mdash;what call you that swift thing in which Rador brought
us here?"</p>

<p>"<i>Corial</i>," said she.</p>

<p>"Hold up ten times twenty of our <i>corials</i> with but two
fingers &mdash;and these <i>corials</i> of ours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Coria</i>," said she.</p>

<p>"And these <i>coria</i> of ours are each greater in weight
than ten of yours. Yes, and I have seen another with but one blow
of his hand raise hell!</p>

<p>"And so I have," he murmured to me. "And both at Forty-second
and Fifth Avenue, N. Y.&mdash;U. S. A."</p>

<p>Yolara considered all this with manifest doubt.</p>

<p>"Hell?" she inquired at last. "I know not the word."</p>

<p>"Well," answered O'Keefe. "Say Muria then. In many ways they
are, I gather, O heart's delight, one and the same."</p>

<p>Now the doubt in the blue eyes was strong indeed. She shook
her head.</p>

<p>"None of our men can do <i>that</i>!" she answered, at length.
"Nor do I think you could, Larree."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Larry easily. "I never tried to be that strong.
I fly," he added, casually.</p>

<p>The priestess rose to her feet, gazing at him with startled
eyes.</p>

<p>"Fly!" she repeated incredulously. "Like a <i>zitia</i>? A
bird?"</p>

<p>Larry nodded&mdash;and then seeing the dawning command in her
eyes, went on hastily.</p>

<p>"Not with my own wings, Yolara. In a&mdash;a <i>corial</i>
that moves through&mdash;what's the word for air, Doc&mdash;well,
through this&mdash;" He made a wide gesture up toward the
nebulous haze above us. He took a pencil and on a white cloth
made a hasty sketch of an airplane. "In a &mdash;a <i>corial</i>
like this&mdash;" She regarded the sketch gravely, thrust a hand
down into her girdle and brought forth a keen-bladed poniard; cut
Larry's markings out and placed the fragment carefully aside.</p>

<p>"That I can understand," she said.</p>

<p>"Remarkably intelligent young woman," muttered O'Keefe. "Hope
I'm not giving anything away&mdash;but she had me."</p>

<p>"But what are your women like, Larree? Are they like me? And
how many have loved you?" she whispered.</p>

<p>"In all Ireland and America there is none like you, Yolara,"
he answered. "And take that any way you please," he muttered in
English. She took it, it was evident, as it most pleased her.</p>

<p>"Do you have goddesses?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Every woman in Ireland and America, is a goddess;" thus
Larry.</p>

<p>"Now that I do not believe." There was both anger and mockery
in her eyes. "I know women, Larree&mdash;and if that were so
there would be no peace for men."</p>

<p>"There isn't!" replied he. The anger died out and she laughed,
sweetly, understandingly.</p>

<p>"And which goddess do you worship, Larree?"</p>

<p>"You!" said Larry O'Keefe boldly.</p>

<p>"Larry! Larry!" I whispered. "Be careful. It's high
explosive."</p>

<p>But the priestess was laughing&mdash;little trills of sweet
bell notes; and pleasure was in each note.</p>

<p>"You are indeed bold, Larree," she said, "to offer me your
worship. Yet am I pleased by your boldness. Still&mdash;Lugur is
strong; and you are not of those who&mdash;what did you
say&mdash;have tried. And your wings are not
here&mdash;Larree!"</p>

<p>Again her laughter rang out. The Irishman flushed; it was
<i>touché</i> for Yolara!</p>

<p>"Fear not for me with Lugur," he said, grimly. "Rather fear
for him!"</p>

<p>The laughter died; she looked at him searchingly; a little
enigmatic smile about her mouth&mdash;so sweet and so cruel.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we shall see," she murmured. "You say you battle
in your world. With what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, with this and with that," answered Larry, airily. "We
manage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you the <i>Keth</i>&mdash;I mean that with which I sent
Songar into the nothingness?" she asked swiftly.</p>

<p>"See what she's driving at?" O'Keefe spoke to me, swiftly.
"Well I do! But here's where the O'Keefe lands.</p>

<p>"I said," he turned to her, "O voice of silver fire, that your
spirit is high even as your beauty&mdash;and searches out men's
souls as does your loveliness their hearts. And now listen,
Yolara, for what I speak is truth" &mdash;into his eyes came the
far-away gaze; into his voice the Irish softness&mdash;"Lo, in my
land of Ireland, this many of your life's length
agone&mdash;see"&mdash;he raised his ten fingers, clenched and
unclenched them times twenty&mdash;"the mighty men of my race,
the Taitha-da-Dainn, could send men out into the nothingness even
as do you with the <i>Keth</i>. And this they did by their
harpings, and by words spoken&mdash;words of power, O Yolara,
that have their power still&mdash;and by pipings and by slaying
sounds.</p>

<p>"There was Cravetheen who played swift flames from his harp,
flying flames that ate those they were sent against. And there
was Dalua, of <a title= "a phantom island which features in many
Irish myths. It was said to be cloaked in mist, except for one
day each seven years, when it became visible but could still not
be reached."> Hy-Brasil</a>, whose pipes played away from man and
beast and all living things their shadows&mdash;and at last
played them to shadows too, so that wherever Dalua went his
shadows that had been men and beast followed like a storm of
little rustling leaves; yea, and Bel the Harper, who could make
women's hearts run like wax and men's hearts flame to ashes and
whose harpings could shatter strong cliffs and bow great trees to
the sod&mdash;"</p>

<p>His eyes were bright, dream-filled; she shrank a little from
him, faint pallor under the perfect skin.</p>

<p>"I say to you, Yolara, that these things were and are&mdash;in
Ireland." His voice rang strong. "And I have seen men as many as
those that are in your great chamber this many times
over"&mdash;he clenched his hands once more, perhaps a dozen
times&mdash;"blasted into nothingness before your <i>Keth</i>
could even have touched them. Yea&mdash;and rocks as mighty as
those through which we came lifted up and shattered before the
lids could fall over your blue eyes. And this is truth,
Yolara&mdash;all truth! Stay &mdash;have you that little cone of
the <i>Keth</i> with which you destroyed Songar?"</p>

<p>She nodded, gazing at him, fascinated, fear and puzzlement
contending.</p>

<p>"Then use it." He took a vase of crystal from the table,
placed it on the threshold that led into the garden. "Use it on
this&mdash;and I will show you."</p>

<p>"I will use it upon one of the <i>ladala</i>&mdash;" she began
eagerly.</p>

<p>The exaltation dropped from him; there was a touch of horror
in the eyes he turned to her; her own dropped before it.</p>

<p>"It shall be as you say," she said hurriedly. She drew the
shining cone from her breast; levelled it at the vase. The green
ray leaped forth, spread over the crystal, but before its action
could even be begun, a flash of light shot from O'Keefe's hand,
his automatic spat and the trembling vase flew into fragments. As
quickly as he had drawn it, he thrust the pistol back into place
and stood there empty handed, looking at her sternly. From the
anteroom came shouting, a rush of feet.</p>

<p>Yolara's face was white, her eyes strained&mdash;but her voice
was unshaken as she called to the clamoring guards:</p>

<p>"It is nothing&mdash;go to your places!"</p>

<p>But when the sound of their return had ceased she stared
tensely at the Irishman&mdash;then looked again at the shattered
vase.</p>

<p>"It is true!" she cried, "but see, the <i>Keth</i>
is&mdash;alive!"</p>

<p>I followed her pointing finger. Each broken bit of the crystal
was vibrating, shaking its particles out into space. Broken it
the bullet of Larry's had&mdash;but not released it from the grip
of the disintegrating force. The priestess's face was
triumphant.</p>

<p>"But what matters it, O shining urn of beauty&mdash;what
matters it to the vase that is broken what happens to its
fragments?" asked Larry, gravely &mdash;and pointedly.</p>

<p>The triumph died from her face and for a space she was silent;
brooding.</p>

<p>"Next," whispered O'Keefe to me. "Lots of surprises in the
little box; keep your eye on the opening and see what comes
out."</p>

<p>We had not long to wait. There was a sparkle of anger about
Yolara, something too of injured pride. She clapped her hands;
whispered to the maid who answered her summons, and then sat back
regarding us, maliciously.</p>

<p>"You have answered me as to your strength&mdash;but you have
not proved it; but the <i>Keth</i> you have answered. Now answer
this!" she said.</p>

<p>She pointed out into the garden. I saw a flowering branch bend
and snap as though a hand had broken it&mdash;but no hand was
there! Saw then another and another bend and break, a little tree
sway and fall&mdash;and closer and closer to us came the trail of
snapping boughs while down into the garden poured the silvery
light revealing&mdash;nothing! Now a great ewer beside a pillar
rose swiftly in air and hurled itself crashing at my feet.
Cushions close to us swirled about as though in the vortex of a
whirlwind.</p>

<p>And unseen hands held my arms in a mighty clutch fast to my
sides, another gripped my throat and I felt a needle-sharp
poniard point pierce my shirt, touch the skin just over my
heart!</p>

<p>"Larry!" I cried, despairingly. I twisted my head; saw that he
too was caught in this grip of the invisible. But his face was
calm, even amused.</p>

<p>"Keep cool, Doc!" he said. "Remember&mdash;she wants to learn
the language!"</p>

<p>Now from Yolara burst chime upon chime of mocking laughter.
She gave a command&mdash;the hands loosened, the poniard withdrew
from my heart; suddenly as I had been caught I was free&mdash;and
unpleasantly weak and shaky.</p>

<p>"Have you <i>that</i> in Ireland, Larree!" cried the
priestess&mdash;and once more trembled with laughter.</p>

<p>"A good play, Yolara." His voice was as calm as his face. "But
they did that in Ireland even before Dalua piped away his first
man's shadow. And in Goodwin's land they make
ships&mdash;<i>coria</i> that go on water&mdash; so you can pass
by them and see only sea and sky; and those water <i>coria</i>
are each of them many times greater than this whole palace of
yours."</p>

<p>But the priestess laughed on.</p>

<p>"It did get me a little," whispered Larry. "That wasn't quite
up to my mark. But God! If we could find that trick out and take
it back with us!"</p>

<p>"Not so, Larree!" Yolara gasped, through her laughter. "Not
so! Goodwin's cry betrayed you!"</p>

<p>Her good humor had entirely returned; she was like a
mischievous child pleased over some successful trick; and like a
child she cried&mdash;"I'll show you!"&mdash;signalled again;
whispered to the maid who, quickly returning, laid before her a
long metal case. Yolara took from her girdle something that
looked like a small pencil, pressed it and shot a thin stream of
light for all the world like an electric flash, upon its hasp.
The lid flew open. Out of it she drew three flat, oval crystals,
faint rose in hue. She handed one to O'Keefe and one to me.</p>

<p>"Look!" she commanded, placing the third before her own eyes.
I peered through the stone and instantly there leaped into sight,
out of thin air &mdash;six grinning dwarfs! Each was covered from
top of head to soles of feet in a web so tenuous that through it
their bodies were plain. The gauzy stuff seemed to
vibrate&mdash;its strands to run together like quick-silver. I
snatched the crystal from my eyes and&mdash;the chamber was
empty! Put it back&mdash;and there were the grinning six!</p>

<p>Yolara gave another sign and they disappeared, even from the
crystals.</p>

<p>"It is what they wear, Larree," explained Yolara, graciously.
"It is something that came to us from&mdash;the Ancient Ones. But
we have so few" &mdash;she sighed.</p>

<p>"Such treasures must be two-edged swords, Yolara," commented
O'Keefe. "For how know you that one within them creeps not to you
with hand eager to strike?"</p>

<p>"There is no danger," she said indifferently. "I am the keeper
of them."</p>

<p>She mused for a space, then abruptly:</p>

<p>"And now no more. You two are to appear before the Council at
a certain time&mdash;but fear nothing. You, Goodwin, go with
Rador about our city and increase your wisdom. But you, Larree,
await me here in my garden&mdash;" she smiled at him,
provocatively&mdash;maliciously, too. "For shall not one who has
resisted a world of goddesses be given all chance to worship when
at last he finds his own?"</p>

<p>She laughed&mdash;whole-heartedly and was gone. And at that
moment I liked Yolara better than ever I had before
and&mdash;alas&mdash;better than ever I was to in the future.</p>

<p>I noted Rador standing outside the open jade door and started
to go, but O'Keefe caught me by the arm.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he urged. "About Golden Eyes&mdash;you were
going to tell me something&mdash;it's been on my mind all through
that little sparring match."</p>

<p>I told him of the vision that had passed through my closing
lids. He listened gravely and then laughed.</p>

<p>"Hell of a lot of privacy in this place!" he grinned. "Ladies
who can walk through walls and others with regular invisible
cloaks to let 'em flit wherever they please. Oh, well, don't let
it get on your nerves, Doc. Remember&mdash;everything's natural!
That robe stuff is just camouflage of course. But Lord, if we
could only get a piece of it!"</p>

<p>"The material simply admits all light-vibrations, or perhaps
curves them, just as the opacities cut them off," I answered. "A
man under the X-ray is partly invisible; this makes him wholly
so. He doesn't register, as the people of the motion-picture
profession say."</p>

<p>"Camouflage," repeated Larry. "And as for the Shining
One&mdash;Say!" he snorted. "I'd like to set the O'Keefe <a
title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage,
by wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a> up against
it. I'll bet that old resourceful Irish body would give it the
first three bites and a strangle hold and wallop it before it
knew it had 'em. Oh! Wow! Boy Howdy!"</p>

<p>I heard him still chuckling gleefully over this vision as I
passed along the opal wall with the green dwarf.</p>

<p>A shell was awaiting us. I paused before entering it to
examine the polished surface of runway and great road. It was
obsidian&mdash;volcanic glass of pale emerald, unflawed,
translucent, with no sign of block or juncture. I examined the
shell.</p>

<p>"What makes it go?" I asked Rador. At a word from him the
driver touched a concealed spring and an aperture appeared
beneath the control-lever, of which I have spoken in a preceding
chapter. Within was a small cube of black crystal, through whose
sides I saw, dimly, a rapidly revolving, glowing ball, not more
than two inches in diameter. Beneath the cube was a curiously
shaped, slender cylinder winding down into the lower body of the
Nautilus whorl.</p>

<p>"Watch!" said Rador. He motioned me into the vehicle and took
a place beside me. The driver touched the lever; a stream of
coruscations flew from the ball down into the cylinder. The shell
started smoothly, and as the tiny torrent of shining particles
increased it gathered speed.</p>

<p>"The <i>corial</i> does not touch the road," explained Rador.
"It is lifted so far"&mdash;he held his forefinger and thumb less
than a sixteenth of an inch apart&mdash;"above it."</p>

<p>And perhaps here is the best place to explain the activation
of the shells or <i>coria</i>. The force utilized was atomic
energy. Passing from the whirling ball the ions darted through
the cylinder to two bands of a peculiar metal affixed to the base
of the vehicles somewhat like skids of a sled. Impinging upon
these they produced a partial negation of gravity, lifting the
shell slightly, and at the same time creating a powerful
repulsive force or thrust that could be directed backward,
forward, or sidewise at the will of the driver. The creation of
this energy and the mechanism of its utilization were, briefly,
as follows:</p>

<p>[Dr. Goodwin's lucid and exceedingly comprehensive description
of this extraordinary mechanism has been deleted by the Executive
Council of the International Association of Science as too
dangerously suggestive to scientists of the Central European
Powers with which we were so recently at war. It is allowable,
however, to state that his observations are in the possession of
experts in this country, who are, unfortunately, hampered in
their research not only by the scarcity of the radioactive
elements that we know, but also by the lack of the element or
elements unknown to us that entered into the formation of the
fiery ball within the cube of black crystal. Nevertheless, as the
principle is so clear, it is believed that these difficulties
will ultimately be overcome.&mdash;J. B. K., President, I. A. of
S.]</p>

<p>The wide, glistening road was gay with the <i>coria</i>. They
darted in and out of the gardens; within them the fair-haired,
extraordinarily beautiful women on their cushions were like
princesses of Elfland, caught in gorgeous fairy webs, resting
within the hearts of flowers. In some shells were flaxen-haired
dwarfish men of Lugur's type; sometimes black-polled brother
officers of Rador; often raven-tressed girls, plainly hand-maidens
of the women; and now and then beauties of the lower folk
went by with one of the blond dwarfs.</p>

<p>We swept around the turn that made of the jewel-like roadway
an enormous horseshoe and, speedily, upon our right the cliffs
through which we had come in our journey from the Moon Pool began
to march forward beneath their mantles of moss. They formed a
gigantic abutment, a titanic salient. It had been from the very
front of this salient's invading angle that we had emerged; on
each side of it the precipices, faintly glowing, drew back and
vanished into distance.</p>

<p>The slender, graceful bridges under which we skimmed ended at
openings in the upflung, far walls of verdure. Each had its
little garrison of soldiers. Through some of the openings a
rivulet of the green obsidian river passed. These were roadways
to the farther country, to the land of the <i>ladala</i>, Rador
told me; adding that none of the lesser folk could cross into the
pavilioned city unless summoned or with pass.</p>

<p>We turned the bend of the road and flew down that farther
emerald ribbon we had seen from the great oval. Before us rose
the shining cliffs and the lake. A half-mile, perhaps, from these
the last of the bridges flung itself. It was more massive and
about it hovered a spirit of ancientness lacking in the other
spans; also its garrison was larger and at its base the tangent
way was guarded by two massive structures, somewhat like
blockhouses, between which it ran. Something about it aroused in
me an intense curiosity.</p>

<p>"Where does that road lead, Rador?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To the one place above all of which I may not tell you,
Goodwin," he answered. And again I wondered.</p>

<p>We skimmed slowly out upon the great pier. Far to the left was
the prismatic, rainbow curtain between the Cyclopean pillars. On
the white waters graceful shells&mdash;<a title= "'lakeside',
'pertaining to a lake'; more correctly,
'lacustrine'">lacustrian</a> replicas of the Elf
chariots&mdash;swam, but none was near that distant web of
wonder.</p>

<p>"Rador&mdash;what is that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is the Veil of the Shining One!" he answered slowly.</p>

<p>Was the Shining One that which we named the Dweller?</p>

<p>"What is the Shining One?" I cried, eagerly. Again he was
silent. Nor did he speak until we had turned on our homeward
way.</p>

<p>And lively as my interest, my scientific curiosity,
were&mdash;I was conscious suddenly of acute depression.
Beautiful, wondrously beautiful this place was&mdash;and yet in
its wonder dwelt a keen edge of menace, of unease&mdash;of
inexplicable, inhuman woe; as though in a secret garden of God a
soul should sense upon it the gaze of some lurking spirit of evil
which some way, somehow, had crept into the sanctuary and only
bided its time to spring.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>17. &mdash; THE
LEPRECHAUN</h2>

<p class="first">The shell carried us straight back to the house
of Yolara. Larry was awaiting me. We stood again before the
tenebrous wall where first we had faced the priestess and the
Voice. And as we stood, again the portal appeared with all its
disconcerting, magical abruptness.</p>

<p>But now the scene was changed. Around the jet table were
grouped a number of figures&mdash;Lugur, Yolara beside him; seven
others&mdash;all of them fair-haired and all men save one who sat
at the left of the priestess&mdash; an old, old woman, how old I
could not tell, her face bearing traces of beauty that must once
have been as great as Yolara's own, but now ravaged, in some way
awesome; through its ruins the fearful, malicious gaiety shining
out like a spirit of joy held within a corpse!</p>

<p>Began then our examination, for such it was. And as it
progressed I was more and more struck by the change in the
O'Keefe. All flippancy was gone, rarely did his sense of humor
reveal itself in any of his answers. He was like a cautious
swordsman, fencing, guarding, studying his opponent; or rather,
like a chess-player who keeps sensing some far-reaching purpose
in the game: alert, contained, watchful. Always he stressed the
power of our surface races, their multitudes, their
solidarity.</p>

<p>Their questions were myriad. What were our occupations? Our
system of government? How great were the waters? The land?
Intensely interested were they in the World War, querying
minutely into its causes, its effects. In our weapons their
interest was avid. And they were exceedingly minute in their
examination of us as to the ruins which had excited our
curiosity; their position and surroundings&mdash;and if others
than ourselves might be expected to find and pass through their
entrance!</p>

<p>At this I shot a glance at Lugur. He did not seem unduly
interested. I wondered if the Russian had told him as yet of the
girl of the rosy wall of the Moon Pool Chamber and the real
reasons for our search. Then I answered as briefly as
possible&mdash;omitting all reference to these things. The red
dwarf watched me with unmistakable amusement&mdash;and I knew
Marakinoff had told him. But clearly Lugur had kept his
information even from Yolara; and as clearly she had spoken to
none of that episode when O'Keefe's automatic had shattered the
<i>Keth</i>-smitten vase. Again I felt that sense of deep
bewilderment&mdash;of helpless search for clue to all the
tangle.</p>

<p>For two hours we were questioned and then the priestess called
Rador and let us go.</p>

<p>Larry was sombre as we returned. He walked about the room
uneasily.</p>

<p>"Hell's brewing here all right," he said at last, stopping
before me. "I can't make out just the particular
brand&mdash;that's all that bothers me. We're going to have a
stiff fight, that's sure. What I want to do quick is to find the
Golden Girl, Doc. Haven't seen her on the wall lately, have you?"
he queried, hopefully fantastic.</p>

<p>"Laugh if you want to," he went on. "But she's our best bet.
It's going to be a race between her and the O'Keefe <a title= "a
female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing,
a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a>&mdash;but I put my money
on her. I had a queer experience while I was in that garden,
after you'd left." His voice grew solemn. "Did you ever see a <a
title= "an elf in Irish folklore who can reveal hidden treasure
to those who catch them"> <i>leprechaun</i></a>, Doc?" I shook my
head again, as solemnly. "He's a little man in green," said
Larry. "Oh, about as high as your knee. I saw one once&mdash;in
Carntogher Woods. And as I sat there, half asleep, in Yolara's
garden, the living spit of him stepped out from one of those
bushes, twirling a little shillalah.</p>

<p>"'It's a tight box ye're gettin' in, Larry <a title= "Irish:
my son, my lad, my boy"><i>avick</i></a>,' said he, 'but don't ye
be downhearted, lad.'</p>

<p>"'I'm carrying on,' said I, 'but you're a long way from
Ireland,' I said, or thought I did.</p>

<p>"'Ye've a lot o' friends there,' he answered. 'An' where the
heart rests the feet are swift to follow. Not that I'm sayin' I'd
like to live here, Larry,' said he.</p>

<p>"'I know where my heart is now,' I told him. 'It rests on a
girl with golden eyes and the hair and swan-white breast of
Eilidh the Fair&mdash;but me feet don't seem to get me to her,' I
said."</p>

<p>The brogue thickened.</p>

<p>"An' the little man in green nodded his head an' whirled his
shillalah.</p>

<p>"'It's what I came to tell ye,' says he. 'Don't ye fall for
the Bhean-Nimher, the serpent woman wit' the blue eyes; she's a
daughter of Ivor, lad &mdash;an' don't ye do nothin' to make the
brown-haired <a title= "Irish: 'girl', 'lass'"><i>colleen</i></a>
ashamed o' ye, Larry O'Keefe. I knew yer great, great grandfather
an' his before him, <a title= "Irish: 'my dear', 'my sweetheart',
'my loved-one'"><i>aroon</i></a>,' says he, 'an' wan o' the
O'Keefe failin's is to think their hearts big enough to hold all
the wimmen o' the world. A heart's built to hold only wan
permanently, Larry,' he says, 'an' I'm warnin' ye a nice girl
don't like to move into a place all cluttered up wid another's
washin' an' mendin' an' cookin' an' other things pertainin' to
general wife work. Not that I think the blue-eyed wan is keen for
mendin' an' cookin'!' says he.</p>

<p>"'You don't have to be comin' all this way to tell me that,' I
answer.</p>

<p>"'Well, I'm just a tellin' you,' he says. 'Ye've got some
rough knocks comin', Larry. In fact, ye're in for a devil of a
time. But, remember that ye're the O'Keefe,' says he. 'An' while
the bhoys are all wid ye, <a title= "Irish: my son, my lad, my
boy"><i>avick</i></a>, ye've got to be on the job yourself.'</p>

<p>"'I hope,' I tell him, 'that the O'Keefe <a title= "a female
spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing, a
death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a> can find her way here in
time&mdash;that is, if it's necessary, which I hope it won't
be.'</p>

<p>"'Don't ye worry about that,' says he. 'Not that she's keen on
leavin' the ould sod, Larry. The good ould soul's in quite a
state o' mind about ye, <a title= "Irish: 'my dear', 'my
sweetheart', 'my loved-one'"><i>aroon</i></a>. I don't mind
tellin' ye, lad, that she's mobilizing all the clan an' if she
<i>has</i> to come for ye, <a title= "Irish: my son, my lad, my
boy"><i>avick</i></a>, they'll be wid her an' they'll sweep this
joint clean before ye go. What they'll do to it'll make the Big
Wind look like a summer breeze on Lough Lene! An' that's about
all, Larry. We thought a voice from the Green Isle would cheer
ye. Don't fergit that ye're the O'Keefe an' I say it
again&mdash;all the bhoys are wid ye. But we want t' kape bein'
proud o' ye, lad!'</p>

<p>"An' I looked again and there was only a bush waving."</p>

<p>There wasn't a smile in my heart&mdash;or if there was it was
a very tender one.</p>

<p>"I'm going to bed," he said abruptly. "Keep an eye on the
wall, Doc!"</p>

<p>Between the seven sleeps that followed, Larry and I saw but
little of each other. Yolara sought him more and more. Thrice we
were called before the Council; once we were at a great feast,
whose splendors and surprises I can never forget. Largely I was
in the company of Rador. Together we two passed the green
barriers into the dwelling-place of the <i>ladala</i>.</p>

<p>They seemed provided with everything needful for life. But
everywhere was an oppressiveness, a gathering together of hate,
that was spiritual rather than material&mdash;as tangible as the
latter and far, far more menacing!</p>

<p>"They do not like to dance with the Shining One," was Rador's
constant and only reply to my efforts to find the cause.</p>

<p>Once I had concrete evidence of the mood. Glancing behind me,
I saw a white, vengeful face peer from behind a tree-trunk, a
hand lift, a shining dart speed from it straight toward Rador's
back. Instinctively I thrust him aside. He turned upon me
angrily. I pointed to where the little missile lay, still
quivering, on the ground. He gripped my hand.</p>

<p>"That, some day I will repay!" he said. I looked again at the
thing. At its end was a tiny cone covered with a glistening,
gelatinous substance.</p>

<p>Rador pulled from a tree beside us a fruit somewhat like an
apple.</p>

<p>"Look!" he said. He dropped it upon the dart&mdash;and at
once, before my eyes, in less than ten seconds, the fruit had
rotted away!</p>

<p>"That's what would have happened to Rador but for you,
friend!" he said.</p>

<p>Come now between this and the prelude to the latter half of
the drama whose history this narrative is&mdash;only scattering
and necessarily fragmentary observations.</p>

<p>First&mdash;the nature of the ebon opacities, blocking out the
spaces between the pavilion-pillars or covering their tops like
roofs, These were magnetic fields, light absorbers, negativing
the vibrations of radiance; literally screens of electric force
which formed as impervious a barrier to light as would have
screens of steel.</p>

<p>They instantaneously made night appear in a place where no
night was. But they interposed no obstacle to air or to sound.
They were extremely simple in their inception&mdash;no more
miraculous than is glass, which, inversely, admits the vibrations
of light, but shuts out those coarser ones we call air
&mdash;and, partly, those others which produce upon our auditory
nerves the effects we call sound.</p>

<p>Briefly their mechanism was this:</p>

<p class="footnote">[For the same reason that Dr. Goodwin's
exposition of the mechanism of the atomic engines was deleted,
his description of the light-destroying screens has been deleted
by the Executive Council.&mdash;J. B. F., President, I. A. of
S.]</p>

<p>There were two favored classes of the <i>ladala</i>&mdash;the
soldiers and the dream-makers. The dream-makers were the most
astonishing social phenomena, I think, of all. Denied by their
circumscribed environment the wider experiences of us of the
outer world, the Murians had perfected an amazing system of
escape through the imagination.</p>

<p>They were, too, intensely musical. Their favorite instruments
were double flutes; immensely complex pipe-organs; harps, great
and small. They had another remarkable instrument made up of a
double octave of small drums which gave forth percussions
remarkably disturbing to the emotional centers.</p>

<p>It was this love of music that gave rise to one of the few
truly humorous incidents of our caverned life. Larry came to
me&mdash;it was just after our fourth sleep, I remember.</p>

<p>"Come on to a concert," he said.</p>

<p>We skimmed off to one of the bridge garrisons. Rador called
the two-score guards to attention; and then, to my utter
stupefaction, the whole company, O'Keefe leading them, roared out
the anthem, "God Save the King." They sang &mdash;in a closer
approach to the English than might have been expected scores of
miles below England's level. "Send him victorious! Happy and
glorious!" they bellowed.</p>

<p>He quivered with suppressed mirth at my paralysis of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Taught 'em that for Marakinoff's benefit!" he gasped. "Wait
till that Red hears it. He'll blow up.</p>

<p>"Just wait until you hear Yolara lisp a pretty little thing I
taught her," said Larry as we set back for what we now called
home. There was an impish twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>And I did hear. For it was not many minutes later that the
priestess condescended to command me to come to her with
O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"Show Goodwin how much you have learned of our speech, O lady
of the lips of honeyed flame!" murmured Larry.</p>

<p>She hesitated; smiled at him, and then from that perfect
mouth, out of the exquisite throat, in the voice that was like
the chiming of little silver bells, she trilled a melody familiar
to me indeed:</p>

<br>

"She's only a bird in a gilded cage,<br>
A bea-yu-tiful sight to see&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>And so on to the bitter end.</p>

<p>"She thinks it's a love-song," said Larry when we had left.
"It's only part of a repertoire I'm teaching her. Honestly, Doc,
it's the only way I can keep my mind clear when I'm with her," he
went on earnestly. "She's a deviless from hell&mdash;but a
wonder. Whenever I find myself going I get her to sing that, or
"Take Back Your Gold!" or some other ancient lay, and I'm back
again&mdash;pronto&mdash;with the right perspective! POP goes all
the mystery! 'Hell!' I say, 'she's only a woman!'"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a>18. &mdash; THE AMPHITHEATER
OF JET</h2>

<p class="first">For hours the black-haired folk had been
streaming across the bridges, flowing along the promenade by
scores and by hundreds, drifting down toward the gigantic
seven-terraced temple whose interior I had never as yet seen, and
from whose towering exterior, indeed, I had always been kept far
enough away&mdash;unobtrusively, but none the less
decisively&mdash;to prevent any real observation. The structure,
I had estimated, nevertheless, could not reach less than a
thousand feet above its silvery base, and the diameter of its
circular foundation was about the same.</p>

<p>I wondered what was bringing the <i>ladala</i> into Lora, and
where they were vanishing. All of them were flower-crowned with
the luminous, lovely blooms&mdash;old and young, slender,
mocking-eyed girls, dwarfed youths, mothers with their babes,
gnomed oldsters&mdash;on they poured, silent for the most part
and sullen&mdash;a sullenness that held acid bitterness even as
their subtle, half-sinister, half-gay malice seemed tempered into
little keen-edged flames, oddly, menacingly defiant.</p>

<p>There were many of the green-clad soldiers along the way, and
the garrison of the only bridge span I could see had certainly
been doubled.</p>

<p>Wondering still, I turned from my point of observation and
made my way back to our pavilion, hoping that Larry, who had been
with Yolara for the past two hours, had returned. Hardly had I
reached it before Rador came hurrying up, in his manner a curious
exultance mingled with what in anyone else I would have called a
decided nervousness.</p>

<p>"Come!" he commanded before I could speak. "The Council has
made decision &mdash;and <i>Larree</i> is awaiting you."</p>

<p>"What has been decided?" I panted as we sped along the mosaic
path that led to the house of Yolara. "And why is Larry awaiting
me?"</p>

<p>And at his answer I felt my heart pause in its beat and
through me race a wave of mingled panic and eagerness.</p>

<p>"The Shining One dances!" had answered the green dwarf. "And
you are to worship!"</p>

<p>What was this dancing of the Shining One, of which so often he
had spoken?</p>

<p>Whatever my forebodings, Larry evidently had none.</p>

<p>"Great stuff!" he cried, when we had met in the great
antechamber now empty of the dwarfs. "Hope it will be worth
seeing&mdash;have to be something damned good, though, to catch
me, after what I've seen of shows at the front," he added.</p>

<p>And remembering, with a little shock of apprehension, that he
had no knowledge of the Dweller beyond my poor description of
it&mdash;for there are no words actually to describe what that
miracle of interwoven glory and horror was&mdash;I wondered what
Larry O'Keefe would say and do when he did behold it!</p>

<p>Rador began to show impatience.</p>

<p>"Come!" he urged. "There is much to be done&mdash;and the time
grows short!"</p>

<p>He led us to a tiny fountain room in whose miniature pool the
white waters were concentrated, pearl-like and opalescent in
their circling rim.</p>

<p>"Bathe!" he commanded; and set the example by stripping
himself and plunging within. Only a minute or two did the green
dwarf allow us, and he checked us as we were about to don our
clothing.</p>

<p>Then, to my intense embarrassment, without warning, two of the
black-haired girls entered, bearing robes of a peculiar dull-blue
hue. At our manifest discomfort Rador's laughter roared out. He
took the garments from the pair, motioned them to leave us, and,
still laughing, threw one around me. Its texture was soft, but
decidedly metallic&mdash;like some blue metal spun to the
fineness of a spider's thread. The garment buckled tightly at the
throat, was girdled at the waist, and, below this cincture, fell
to the floor, its folds being held together by a half-dozen
looped cords; from the shoulders a hood resembling a monk's
cowl.</p>

<p>Rador cast this over my head; it completely covered my face,
but was of so transparent a texture that I could see, though
somewhat mistily, through it. Finally he handed us both a pair of
long gloves of the same material and high stockings, the feet of
which were gloved&mdash;five-toed.</p>

<p>And again his laughter rang out at our manifest surprise.</p>

<p>"The priestess of the Shining One does not altogether trust
the Shining One's Voice," he said at last. "And these are to
guard against any sudden &mdash;errors. And fear not, Goodwin,"
he went on kindly. "Not for the Shining One itself would Yolara
see harm come to <i>Larree</i> here&mdash; nor, because of him,
to you. But I would not stake much on the great white one. And
for him I am sorry, for him I do like well."</p>

<p>"Is he to be with us?" asked Larry eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is to be where we go," replied the dwarf soberly.</p>

<p>Grimly Larry reached down and drew from his uniform his
automatic. He popped a fresh clip into the pocket fold of his
girdle. The pistol he slung high up beneath his arm-pit.</p>

<p>The green dwarf looked at the weapon curiously. O'Keefe tapped
it.</p>

<p>"This," said Larry, "slays quicker than the
<i>Keth</i>&mdash;I take it so no harm shall come to the blue-eyed
one whose name is Olaf. If I should raise it&mdash;be you
not in its way, Rador!" he added significantly.</p>

<p>The dwarf nodded again, his eyes sparkling. He thrust a hand
out to both of us.</p>

<p>"A change comes," he said. "What it is I know not, nor how it
will fall. But this remember&mdash;Rador is more friend to you
than you yet can know. And now let us go!" he ended abruptly.</p>

<p>He led us, not through the entrance, but into a sloping
passage ending in a blind wall; touched a symbol graven there,
and it opened, precisely as had the rosy barrier of the Moon Pool
Chamber. And, just as there, but far smaller, was a passage end,
a low curved wall facing a shaft not black as had been that abode
of living darkness, but faintly luminescent. Rador leaned over
the wall. The mechanism clicked and started; the door swung shut;
the sides of the car slipped into place, and we swept swiftly
down the passage; overhead the wind whistled. In a few moments
the moving platform began to slow down. It stopped in a closed
chamber no larger than itself.</p>

<p>Rador drew his poniard and struck twice upon the wall with its
hilt. Immediately a panel moved away, revealing a space filled
with faint, misty blue radiance. And at each side of the open
portal stood four of the dwarfish men, grey-headed, old, clad in
flowing garments of white, each pointing toward us a short silver
rod.</p>

<p>Rador drew from his girdle a ring and held it out to the first
dwarf. He examined it, handed it to the one beside him, and not
until each had inspected the ring did they lower their curious
weapons; containers of that terrific energy they called the
<i>Keth</i>, I thought; and later was to know that I had been
right.</p>

<p>We stepped out; the doors closed behind us. The place was
weird enough. Its pave was a greenish-blue stone resembling lapis
lazuli. On each side were high pedestals holding carved figures
of the same material. There were perhaps a score of these, but in
the mistiness I could not make out their outlines. A droning,
rushing roar beat upon our ears; filled the whole cavern.</p>

<p>"I smell the sea," said Larry suddenly.</p>

<p>The roaring became deep-toned, clamorous, and close in front
of us a rift opened. Twenty feet in width, it cut the cavern
floor and vanished into the blue mist on each side. The cleft was
spanned by one solid slab of rock not more than two yards wide.
It had neither railing nor other protection.</p>

<p>The four leading priests marched out upon it one by one, and
we followed. In the middle of the span they knelt. Ten feet
beneath us was a torrent of blue sea-water racing with prodigious
speed between polished walls. It gave the impression of vast
depth. It roared as it sped by, and far to the right was a low
arch through which it disappeared. It was so swift that its
surface shone like polished blue steel, and from it came the
blessed, <i>our-worldly</i>, familiar ocean breath that
strengthened my soul amazingly and made me realize how earth-sick
I was.</p>

<p>Whence came the stream, I marvelled, forgetting for the
moment, as we passed on again, all else. Were we closer to the
surface of earth than I had thought, or was this some mighty
flood falling through an opening in sea floor, Heaven alone knew
how many miles above us, losing itself in deeper abysses beyond
these? How near and how far this was from the truth I was to
learn&mdash;and never did truth come to man in more dreadful
guise!</p>

<p>The roaring fell away, the blue haze lessened. In front of us
stretched a wide flight of steps, huge as those which had led us
into the courtyard of Nan-Tauach through the ruined sea-gate. We
scaled it; it narrowed; from above light poured through a still
narrower opening. Side by side Larry and I passed out of it.</p>

<p>We had emerged upon an enormous platform of what seemed to be
glistening ivory. It stretched before us for a hundred yards or
more and then shelved gently into the white waters.
Opposite&mdash;not a mile away&mdash;was that prodigious web of
woven rainbows Rador had called the Veil of the Shining One.
There it shone in all its unearthly grandeur, on each side of the
Cyclopean pillars, as though a mountain should stretch up arms
raising between them a fairy banner of auroral glories. Beneath
it was the curved, scimitar sweep of the pier with its clustered,
gleaming temples.</p>

<p>Before that brief, fascinated glance was done, there dropped
upon my soul a sensation as of brooding weight intolerable; a
spiritual oppression as though some vastness was falling,
pressing, stifling me, I turned&mdash;and Larry caught me as I
reeled.</p>

<p>"Steady! Steady, old man!" he whispered.</p>

<p>At first all that my staggering consciousness could realize
was an immensity, an immeasurable uprearing that brought with it
the same throat-gripping vertigo as comes from gazing downward
from some great height&mdash; then a blur of white
faces&mdash;intolerable shinings of hundreds upon thousands of
eyes. Huge, incredibly huge, a colossal amphitheater of jet, a
stupendous semi-circle, held within its mighty arc the ivory
platform on which I stood.</p>

<p>It reared itself almost perpendicularly hundreds of feet up
into the sparkling heavens, and thrust down on each side its ebon
bulwarks&mdash; like monstrous paws. Now, the giddiness from its
sheer greatness passing, I saw that it was indeed an amphitheater
sloping slightly backward tier after tier, and that the white
blur of faces against its blackness, the gleaming of countless
eyes were those of myriads of the people who sat silent,
flower-garlanded, their gaze focused upon the rainbow curtain and
sweeping over me like a torrent&mdash;tangible, appalling!</p>

<p>Five hundred feet beyond, the smooth, high retaining wall of
the amphitheater raised itself&mdash;above it the first terrace
of the seats, and above this, dividing the tiers for another half
a thousand feet upward, set within them like a panel, was a
dead-black surface in which shone faintly with a bluish radiance a
gigantic disk; above it and around it a cluster of innumerable
smaller ones.</p>

<p>On each side of me, bordering the platform, were scores of
small pillared alcoves, a low wall stretching across their
fronts; delicate, fretted grills shielding them, save where in
each lattice an opening stared&mdash;it came to me that they were
like those stalls in ancient Gothic cathedrals wherein for
centuries had kneeled paladins and people of my own race on
earth's fair face. And within these alcoves were gathered, score
upon score, the elfin beauties, the dwarfish men of the
fair-haired folk. At my right, a few feet from the opening
through which we had come, a passageway led back between the
fretted stalls. Half-way between us and the massive base of the
amphitheater a dais rose. Up the platform to it a wide ramp
ascended; and on ramp and dais and along the center of the
gleaming platform down to where it kissed the white waters, a
broad ribbon of the radiant flowers lay like a fairy carpet.</p>

<p>On one side of this dais, meshed in a silken web that hid no
line or curve of her sweet body, white flesh gleaming through its
folds, stood Yolara; and opposite her, crowned with a circlet of
flashing blue stones, his mighty body stark bare, was Lugur!</p>

<p>O'Keefe drew a long breath; Rador touched my arm and, still
dazed, I let myself be drawn into the aisle and through a
corridor that ran behind the alcoves. At the back of one of these
the green dwarf paused, opened a door, and motioned us
within.</p>

<p>Entering, I found that we were exactly opposite where the ramp
ran up to the dais&mdash;and that Yolara was not more than fifty
feet away. She glanced at O'Keefe and smiled. Her eyes were
ablaze with little dancing points of light; her body seemed to
palpitate, the rounded delicate muscles beneath the translucent
skin to run with joyful little eager waves!</p>

<p>Larry whistled softly.</p>

<p>"There's Marakinoff!" he said.</p>

<p>I looked where he pointed. Opposite us sat the Russian,
clothed as we were, leaning forward, his eyes eager behind his
glasses; but if he saw us he gave no sign.</p>

<p>"And there's Olaf!" said O'Keefe.</p>

<p>Beneath the carved stall in which sat the Russian was an
aperture and within it was Huldricksson. Unprotected by pillars
or by grills, opening clear upon the platform, near him stretched
the trail of flowers up to the great dais which Lugur and Yolara
the priestess guarded. He sat alone, and my heart went out to
him.</p>

<p>O'Keefe's face softened.</p>

<p>"Bring him here," he said to Rador.</p>

<p>The green dwarf was looking at the Norseman, too, a shade of
pity upon his mocking face. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he said. "You can do nothing now&mdash;and it may be
there will be no need to do anything," he added; but I could feel
that there was little of conviction in his words.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>19. &mdash; THE MADNESS OF
OLAF</h2>

<p class="first">Yolara threw her white arms high. From the
mountainous tiers came a mighty sigh; a rippling ran through
them. And upon the moment, before Yolara's arms fell, there
issued, apparently from the air around us, a peal of sound that
might have been the shouting of some playful god hurling great
suns through the net of stars. It was like the deepest notes of
all the organs in the world combined in one; summoning, majestic,
cosmic!</p>

<p>It held within it the thunder of the spheres rolling through
the infinite, the birth-song of suns made manifest in the womb of
space; echoes of creation's supernal chord! It shook the body
like a pulse from the heart of the
universe&mdash;pulsed&mdash;and died away.</p>

<p>On its death came a blaring as of all the trumpets of
conquering hosts since the first Pharaoh led his
swarms&mdash;triumphal, compelling! Alexander's clamoring hosts,
brazen-throated wolf-horns of Caesar's legions, blare of trumpets
of Genghis Khan and his golden horde, clangor of the locust
levies of Tamerlane, bugles of Napoleon's armies&mdash;war-shout
of all earth's conquerors! And it died!</p>

<p>Fast upon it, a throbbing, muffled tumult of harp sounds,
mellownesses of myriads of wood horns, the subdued sweet
shrilling of multitudes of flutes, Pandean
pipings&mdash;inviting, carrying with them the calling of
waterfalls in the hidden places, rushing brooks and murmuring
forest winds &mdash;calling, calling, languorous, lulling,
dripping into the brain like the very honeyed essence of
sound.</p>

<p>And after them a silence in which the memory of the music
seemed to beat, to beat ever more faintly, through every
quivering nerve.</p>

<p>From me all fear, all apprehension, had fled. In their place
was nothing but joyous anticipation, a supernal freedom from even
the shadow of the shadow of care or sorrow; not now did anything
matter&mdash;Olaf or his haunted, hate-filled eyes; Throckmartin
or his fate&mdash;nothing of pain, nothing of agony, nothing of
striving nor endeavor nor despair in that wide outer world that
had turned suddenly to a troubled dream.</p>

<p>Once more the first great note pealed out! Once more it died
and from the clustered spheres a kaleidoscopic blaze shot as
though drawn from the majestic sound itself. The many-colored
rays darted across the white waters and sought the face of the
irised Veil. As they touched, it sparkled, flamed, wavered, and
shook with fountains of prismatic color.</p>

<p>The light increased&mdash;and in its intensity the silver air
darkened. Faded into shadow that white mosaic of flower-crowned
faces set in the amphitheater of jet, and vast shadows dropped
upon the high-flung tiers and shrouded them. But on the skirts of
the rays the fretted stalls in which we sat with the fair-haired
ones blazed out, iridescent, like jewels.</p>

<p>I was sensible of an acceleration of every pulse; a wild
stimulation of every nerve. I felt myself being lifted above the
world&mdash;close to the threshold of the high gods&mdash;soon
their essence and their power would stream out into me! I glanced
at Larry. His eyes were&mdash;wild&mdash; with life!</p>

<p>I looked at Olaf&mdash;and in his face was none of
this&mdash;only hate, and hate, and hate.</p>

<p>The peacock waves streamed out over the waters, cleaving the
seeming darkness, a rainbow path of glory. And the Veil flashed
as though all the rainbows that had ever shone were burning
within it. Again the mighty sound pealed.</p>

<p>Into the center of the Veil the light drew itself, grew into
an intolerable brightness&mdash;and with a storm of tinklings, a
tempest of crystalline notes, a tumult of tiny chimings, through
it sped&mdash;the Shining One!</p>

<p>Straight down that radiant path, its high-flung plumes of
feathery flame shimmering, its coruscating spirals whirling, its
seven globes of seven colors shining above its glowing core, it
raced toward us. The hurricane of bells of diamond glass were
jubilant, joyous. I felt O'Keefe grip my arm; Yolara threw her
white arms out in a welcoming gesture; I heard from the tier a
sigh of rapture&mdash;and in it a poignant, wailing under-tone of
agony!</p>

<p>Over the waters, down the light stream, to the end of the
ivory pier, flew the Shining One. Through its crystal
<i>pizzicati</i> drifted inarticulate murmurings&mdash;deadly
sweet, stilling the heart and setting it leaping madly.</p>

<p>For a moment it paused, poised itself, and then came whirling
down the flower path to its priestess, slowly, ever more slowly.
It hovered for a moment between the woman and the dwarf, as
though contemplating them; turned to her with its storm of
tinklings softened, its murmurings infinitely caressing. Bent
toward it, Yolara seemed to gather within herself pulsing waves
of power; she was terrifying; gloriously, maddeningly evil; and
as gloriously, maddeningly heavenly! Aphrodite and the Virgin!
Tanith of the Carthaginians and St. Bride of the Isles! A queen
of hell and a princess of heaven&mdash;in one!</p>

<p>Only for a moment did that which we had called the Dweller and
which these named the Shining One, pause. It swept up the ramp to
the dais, rested there, slowly turning, plumes and spirals lacing
and unlacing, throbbing, pulsing. Now its nucleus grew plainer,
stronger&mdash;human in a fashion, and all inhuman; neither man
nor woman; neither god nor devil; subtly partaking of all. Nor
could I doubt that whatever it was, within that shining nucleus
was something sentient; something that had will and energy, and
in some awful, supernormal fashion&mdash;intelligence!</p>

<p>Another trumpeting&mdash;a sound of stones opening&mdash;a
long, low wail of utter anguish&mdash;something moved shadowy in
the river of light, and slowly at first, then ever more rapidly,
shapes swam through it. There were half a score of
them&mdash;girls and youths, women and men. The Shining One
poised itself, regarded them. They drew closer, and in the eyes
of each and in their faces was the bud of that awful
intermingling of emotions, of joy and sorrow, ecstasy and terror,
that I had seen in full blossom on Throckmartin's.</p>

<p>The Thing began again its murmurings&mdash;now infinitely
caressing, coaxing&mdash;like the song of a siren from some
witched star! And the bell-sounds rang out&mdash;compellingly,
calling&mdash;calling&mdash; calling&mdash;</p>

<p>I saw Olaf lean far out of his place; saw, half-consciously,
at Lugur's signal, three of the dwarfs creep in and take places,
unnoticed, behind him.</p>

<p>Now the first of the figures rushed upon the dais&mdash;and
paused. It was the girl who had been brought before Yolara when
the gnome named Songar was driven into the nothingness! With all
the quickness of light a spiral of the Shining One stretched out
and encircled her.</p>

<p>At its touch there was an infinitely dreadful shrinking and,
it seemed, a simultaneous hurling of herself into its radiance.
As it wrapped its swirls around her, permeated her&mdash;the
crystal chorus burst forth&mdash; tumultuously; through and
through her the radiance pulsed. Began then that infinitely
dreadful, but infinitely glorious, rhythm they called the dance
of the Shining One. And as the girl swirled within its sparkling
mists another and another flew into its embrace, until, at last,
the dais was an incredible vision; a mad star's Witches' Sabbath;
an altar of white faces and bodies gleaming through living flame;
transfused with rapture insupportable and horror that was
hellish&mdash;and ever, radiant plumes and spirals expanding, the
core of the Shining One waxed&mdash;growing greater&mdash; as it
consumed, as it drew into and through itself the life-force of
these lost ones!</p>

<p>So they spun, interlaced&mdash;and there began to pulse from
them life, vitality, as though the very essence of nature was
filling us. Dimly I recognized that what I was beholding was
vampirism inconceivable! The banked tiers chanted. The mighty
sounds pealed forth!</p>

<p>It was a Saturnalia of demigods!</p>

<p>Then, whirling, bell-notes storming, the Shining One withdrew
slowly from the dais down the ramp, still embracing, still
interwoven with those who had thrown themselves into its spirals.
They drifted with it as though half-carried in dreadful dance;
white faces sealed&mdash;forever&mdash; into that semblance of
those who held within linked God and devil&mdash;I covered my
eyes!</p>

<p>I heard a gasp from O'Keefe; opened my eyes and sought his;
saw the wildness vanish from them as he strained forward. Olaf
had leaned far out, and as he did so the dwarfs beside him caught
him, and whether by design or through his own swift, involuntary
movement, thrust him half into the Dweller's path. The Dweller
paused in its gyrations&mdash;seemed to watch him. The Norseman's
face was crimson, his eyes blazing. He threw himself back and,
with one defiant shout, gripped one of the dwarfs about the
middle and sent him hurtling through the air, straight at the
radiant Thing! A whirling mass of legs and arms, the dwarf
flew&mdash;then in mid-flight stopped as though some gigantic
invisible hand had caught him, and&mdash;was dashed down upon the
platform not a yard from the Shining One!</p>

<p>Like a broken spider he moved&mdash;feebly&mdash;once, twice.
From the Dweller shot a shimmering tentacle&mdash;touched
him&mdash;recoiled. Its crystal tinklings changed into an angry
chiming. From all about&mdash; jeweled stalls and jet
peak&mdash;came a sigh of incredulous horror.</p>

<p>Lugur leaped forward. On the instant Larry was over the low
barrier between the pillars, rushing to the Norseman's side. And
even as they ran there was another wild shout from Olaf, and he
hurled himself out, straight at the throat of the Dweller!</p>

<p>But before he could touch the Shining One, now
motionless&mdash;and never was the thing more horrible than then,
with the purely human suggestion of surprise plain in its
poise&mdash;Larry had struck him aside.</p>

<p>I tried to follow&mdash;and was held by Rador. He was
trembling&mdash; but not with fear. In his face was incredulous
hope, inexplicable eagerness.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he said. "Wait!"</p>

<p>The Shining One stretched out a slow spiral, and as it did so
I saw the bravest thing man has ever witnessed. Instantly O'Keefe
thrust himself between it and Olaf, pistol out. The tentacle
touched him, and the dull blue of his robe flashed out into
blinding, intense azure light. From the automatic in his gloved
hand came three quick bursts of flame straight into the Thing.
The Dweller drew back; the bell-sounds swelled.</p>

<p>Lugur paused, his hand darted up, and in it was one of the
silver <i>Keth</i> cones. But before he could flash it upon the
Norseman, Larry had unlooped his robe, thrown its fold over Olaf,
and, holding him with one hand away from the Shining One, thrust
with the other his pistol into the dwarf's stomach. His lips
moved, but I could not hear what he said. But Lugur understood,
for his hand dropped.</p>

<p>Now Yolara was there&mdash;all this had taken barely more than
five seconds. She thrust herself between the three men and the
Dweller. She spoke to it&mdash;and the wild buzzing died down;
the gay crystal tinklings burst forth again. The Thing murmured
to her&mdash;began to whirl&mdash;faster, faster&mdash;passed
down the ivory pier, out upon the waters, bearing with it, meshed
in its light, the sacrifices&mdash;swept on ever more swiftly,
triumphantly and turning, turning, with its ghastly crew,
vanished through the Veil!</p>

<p>Abruptly the polychromatic path snapped out. The silver light
poured in upon us. From all the amphitheater arose a clamor, a
shouting. Marakinoff, his eyes staring, was leaning out,
listening. Unrestrained now by Rador, I vaulted the wall and
rushed forward. But not before I had heard the green dwarf
murmur:</p>

<p>"There is something stronger than the Shining One! Two
things&mdash;yea &mdash;a strong heart&mdash;and hate!"</p>

<p>Olaf, panting, eyes glazed, trembling, shrank beneath my
hand.</p>

<p>"The devil that took my Helma!" I heard him whisper. "The
Shining Devil!"</p>

<p>"Both these men," Lugur was raging, "they shall dance with the
Shining one. And this one, too." He pointed at me
malignantly.</p>

<p>"This man is mine," said the priestess, and her voice was
menacing. She rested her hand on Larry's shoulder. "He shall not
dance. No&mdash;nor his friend. I have told you I care not for
this one!" She pointed to Olaf.</p>

<p>"Neither this man, nor this," said Larry, "shall be harmed.
This is my word, Yolara!"</p>

<p>"Even so," she answered quietly, "my lord!"</p>

<p>I saw Marakinoff stare at O'Keefe with a new and curiously
speculative interest. Lugur's eyes grew hellish; he raised his
arms as though to strike her. Larry's pistol prodded him rudely
enough.</p>

<p>"No rough stuff now, kid!" said O'Keefe in English. The red
dwarf quivered, turned&mdash;caught a robe from a priest standing
by, and threw it over himself. The <i>ladala</i>, shouting,
gesticulating, fighting with the soldiers, were jostling down
from the tiers of jet.</p>

<p>"Come!" commanded Yolara&mdash;her eyes rested upon Larry.
"Your heart is great, indeed&mdash;my lord!" she murmured; and
her voice was very sweet. "Come!"</p>

<p>"This man comes with us, Yolara," said O'Keefe pointing to
Olaf.</p>

<p>"Bring him," she said. "Bring him&mdash;only tell him to look
no more upon me as before!" she added fiercely.</p>

<p>Beside her the three of us passed along the stalls, where sat
the fair-haired, now silent, at gaze, as though in the grip of
some great doubt. Silently Olaf strode beside me. Rador had
disappeared. Down the stairway, through the hall of turquoise
mist, over the rushing sea-stream we went and stood beside the
wall through which we had entered. The white-robed ones had
gone.</p>

<p>Yolara pressed; the portal opened. We stepped upon the car;
she took the lever; we raced through the faintly luminous
corridor to the house of the priestess.</p>

<p>And one thing now I knew, sick at heart and soul, the truth
had come to me &mdash;no more need to search for Throckmartin.
Behind that Veil, in the lair of the Dweller, dead-alive like
those we had just seen swim in its shining train was he, and
Edith, Stanton and Thora and Olaf Huldricksson's wife!</p>

<p>The car came to rest; the portal opened; Yolara leaped out
lightly, beckoned and flitted up the corridor. She paused before
an ebon screen. At a touch it vanished, revealing an entrance to
a small blue chamber, glowing as though cut from the heart of
some gigantic sapphire; bare, save that in its center, upon a low
pedestal, stood a great globe fashioned from milky rock-crystal;
upon its surface were faint tracings as of seas and continents,
but, if so, either of some other world or of this world in
immemorial past, for in no way did they resemble the mapped
coastlines of our earth.</p>

<p>Poised upon the globe, rising from it out into space, locked
in each other's arms, lips to lips, were two figures, a woman and
a man, so exquisite, so lifelike, that for the moment I failed to
realize that they, too, were carved of the crystal. And before
this shrine&mdash;for nothing else could it be, I
knew&mdash;three slender cones raised themselves: one of purest
white flame, one of opalescent water, and the third of&mdash;
moonlight! There was no mistaking them, the height of a tall man
each stood &mdash;but how water, flame and light were held so
evenly, so steadily in their spire-shapes, I could not tell.</p>

<p>Yolara bowed lowly&mdash;once, twice, thrice. She turned to
O'Keefe, nor by slightest look or gesture betrayed she knew
others were there than he. The blue eyes wide, searching,
unfathomable, she drew close; put white hands on his shoulders,
looked down into his very soul.</p>

<p>"My lord," she murmured. "Now listen well for I, Yolara, give
you three things&mdash;myself, and the Shining One, and the power
that is the Shining One's&mdash;yea, and still a fourth thing
that is all three&mdash;power over all upon that world from
whence you came! These, my lord, ye shall have. I swear
it"&mdash;she turned toward the altar&mdash;uplifted her arms
&mdash;"by Siya and by Siyana, and by the flame, by the water,
and by the light!"*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *I have no space here even to outline the
eschatology of this people, nor to catalogue their pantheon. Siya
and Siyana typified worldly love. Their ritual was, however,
singularly free from those degrading elements usually found in
love-cults. Priests and priestesses of all cults dwelt in the
immense seven-terraced structure, of which the jet amphitheater
was the water side. The symbol, icon, representation, of Siya and
Siyana &mdash;the globe and the up-striving
figures&mdash;typified earthly love, feet bound to earth, but
eyes among the stars. Hell or heaven I never heard formulated,
nor their equivalents; unless that existence in the Shining One's
domain could serve for either. Over all this was Thanaroa,
remote; unheeding, but still maker and ruler of all&mdash;an
absentee First Cause personified! Thanaroa seemed to be the one
article of belief in the creed of the soldiers &mdash;Rador, with
his reverence for the Ancient Ones, was an exception. Whatever
there was, indeed, of high, truly religious impulse among the
Murians, this far, High God had. I found this exceedingly
interesting, because it had long been my theory&mdash;to put the
matter in the shape of a geometrical formula&mdash;that the real
attractiveness of gods to man increases uniformly according to
the square of their distance&mdash;W. T. G. ]</p>

<p>Her eyes grew purple dark.</p>

<p>"Let none dare to take you from me! Nor ye go from me
unbidden!" she whispered fiercely.</p>

<p>Then swiftly, still ignoring us, she threw her arms about
O'Keefe, pressed her white body to his breast, lips raised, eyes
closed, seeking his. O'Keefe's arms tightened around her, his
head dropped lips seeking, finding hers&mdash;passionately! From
Olaf came a deep indrawn breath that was almost a groan. But not
in my heart could I find blame for the Irishman!</p>

<p>The priestess opened eyes now all misty blue, thrust him back,
stood regarding him. O'Keefe, dead-white, raised a trembling hand
to his face.</p>

<p>"And thus have I sealed my oath, O my lord!" she whispered.
For the first time she seemed to recognize our presence, stared
at us a moment, then through us, and turned to O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"Go, now!" she said. "Soon Rador shall come for you.
Then&mdash;well, after that let happen what will!"</p>

<p>She smiled once more at him&mdash;so sweetly; turned toward
the figures upon the great globe; sank upon her knees before
them. Quietly we crept away; still silent, made our way to the
little pavilion. But as we passed we heard a tumult from the
green roadway; shouts of men, now and then a woman's scream.
Through a rift in the garden I glimpsed a jostling crowd on one
of the bridges: green dwarfs struggling with the
<i>ladala</i>&mdash;and all about droned a humming as of a giant
hive disturbed!</p>

<p>Larry threw himself down upon one of the divans, covered his
face with his hands, dropped them to catch in Olaf's eyes
troubled reproach, looked at me.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> couldn't help it," he said, half
defiantly&mdash;half-miserably. "God, what a woman! I
<i>couldn't</i> help it!"</p>

<p>"Larry," I asked. "Why didn't you tell her you didn't love
her&mdash; then?"</p>

<p>He gazed at me&mdash;the old twinkle back in his eye.</p>

<p>"Spoken like a scientist, Doc!" he exclaimed. "I suppose if a
burning angel struck you out of nowhere and threw itself about
you, you would most dignifiedly tell it you didn't want to be
burned. For God's sake, don't talk nonsense, Goodwin!" he ended,
almost peevishly.</p>

<p>"Evil! Evil!" The Norseman's voice was deep, nearly a chant.
"All here is of evil: <a title="Norwegian:
'magic'"><i>trolldom</i></a> and <a title= "Norwegian: 'hell';
Merritt uses the Danish word 'helvede'"><i>helvete</i></a> it is,
<i>Ja!</i> And that she-<a title= "Norwegian: 'devil'; Merritt
uses the Danish adjective 'djaevelsk', which means 'devilish'">
<i>djevel</i></a> of beauty&mdash;what is she but harlot of that
shining devil they worship. I, Olaf Huldricksson, know what she
meant when she held out to you power over all the world,
<i>Ja!</i>&mdash;as if the world had not devils enough in it
now!"</p>

<p>"What?" The cry came from both O'Keefe and myself at once.</p>

<p>Olaf made a gesture of caution, relapsed into sullen silence.
There were footsteps on the path, and into sight came
Rador&mdash;but a Rador changed. Gone was every vestige of his
mockery; curiously solemn, he saluted O'Keefe and Olaf with that
salute which, before this, I had seen given only to Yolara and to
Lugur. There came a swift quickening of the tumult&mdash;died
away. He shrugged mighty shoulders.</p>

<p>"The <i>ladala</i> are awake!" he said. "So much for what two
brave men can do!" He paused thoughtfully. "Bones and dust jostle
not each other for place against the grave wall!" he added oddly.
"But if bones and dust have revealed to them that they
still&mdash;live&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, eyes seeking the globe that bore and sent
forth speech.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *I find that I have neglected to explain
the working of these interesting mechanisms that were telephonic,
dictaphonic, telegraphic in one. I must assume that my readers
are familiar with the receiving apparatus of wireless telegraphy,
which must be "tuned" by the operator until its own vibratory
quality is in exact harmony with the vibrations&mdash;the
extremely rapid impacts&mdash;of those short electric wavelengths
we call Hertzian, and which carry the wireless messages. I must
assume also that they are familiar with the elementary fact of
physics that the vibrations of light and sound are
interchangeable. The hearing-talking globes utilize both these
principles, and with consummate simplicity. The light with which
they shone was produced by an atomic "motor" within their base,
similar to that which activated the merely illuminating globes.
The composition of the phonic spheres gave their surfaces an
acute sensitivity and resonance. In conjunction with its
energizing power, the metal set up what is called a "field of
force," which linked it with every particle of its kind no matter
how distant. When vibrations of speech impinged upon the resonant
surface its rhythmic light-vibrations were broken, just as a
telephone transmitter breaks an electric current. Simultaneously
these light-vibrations were changed into sound&mdash;on the
surfaces of all spheres tuned to that particular instrument. The
"crawling" colors which showed themselves at these times were
literally the voice of the speaker in its spectrum equivalent.
While usually the sounds produced required considerable
familiarity with the apparatus to be understood quickly, they
could, on occasion, be made startlingly loud and clear&mdash;as I
was soon to realize&mdash;W.T.G. ]</p>

<p>"The <i>Afyo Maie</i> has sent me to watch over you till she
summons you," he announced clearly. "There is to be
a&mdash;feast. You, <i>Larree</i>, you Goodwin, are to come. I
remain here with&mdash;Olaf."</p>

<p>"No harm to him!" broke in O'Keefe sharply. Rador touched his
heart, his eyes.</p>

<p>"By the Ancient Ones, and by my love for you, and by what you
twain did before the Shining One&mdash;I swear it!" he
whispered.</p>

<p>Rador clapped palms; a soldier came round the path, in his
grip a long flat box of polished wood. The green dwarf took it,
dismissed him, threw open the lid.</p>

<p>"Here is your apparel for the feast, <i>Larree</i>," he said,
pointing to the contents.</p>

<p>O'Keefe stared, reached down and drew out a white, shimmering,
softly metallic, long-sleeved tunic, a broad, silvery girdle, leg
swathings of the same argent material, and sandals that seemed to
be cut out from silver. He made a quick gesture of angry
dissent.</p>

<p>"Nay, <i>Larree</i>!" muttered the dwarf. "Wear them&mdash;I
counsel it &mdash;I pray it&mdash;ask me not why," he went on
swiftly, looking again at the globe.</p>

<p>O'Keefe, as I, was impressed by his earnestness. The dwarf
made a curiously expressive pleading gesture. O'Keefe abruptly
took the garments; passed into the room of the fountain.</p>

<p>"The Shining One dances not again?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "No"&mdash;he hesitate&mdash;"it is the usual
feast that follows the sacrament! Lugur&mdash;and Double Tongue,
who came with you, will be there," he added slowly.</p>

<p>"Lugur&mdash;" I gasped in astonishment. "After what
happened&mdash;he will be there?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps because of what happened, Goodwin, my friend," he
answered &mdash;his eyes again full of malice; "and there will be
others&mdash; friends of Yolara&mdash;friends of Lugur&mdash;and
perhaps another" &mdash;his voice was almost inaudible&mdash;"one
whom they have not called&mdash;" He halted, half-fearfully,
glancing at the globe; put finger to lips and spread himself out
upon one of the couches.</p>

<p>"Strike up the band"&mdash;came O'Keefe's voice&mdash;"here
comes the hero!"</p>

<p>He strode into the room. I am bound to say that the admiration
in Rador's eyes was reflected in my own, and even, if
involuntarily, in Olaf's.</p>

<p>"A son of Siyana!" whispered Rador.</p>

<p>He knelt, took from his girdle-pouch a silk-wrapped something,
unwound it &mdash;and, still kneeling, drew out a slender poniard
of gleaming white metal, hilted with the blue stones; he thrust
it into O'Keefe's girdle; then gave him again the rare
salute.</p>

<p>"Come," he ordered and took us to the head of the pathway.</p>

<p>"Now," he said grimly, "let the Silent Ones show their
power&mdash;if they still have it!"</p>

<p>And with this strange benediction, he turned back.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Larry," I urged as we approached the house of
the priestess, "you'll be careful!"</p>

<p>He nodded&mdash;but I saw with a little deadly pang of
apprehension in my heart a puzzled, lurking doubt within his
eyes.</p>

<p>As we ascended the serpent steps Marakinoff appeared. He gave
a signal to our guards&mdash;and I wondered what influence the
Russian had attained, for promptly, without question, they drew
aside. At me he smiled amiably.</p>

<p>"Have you found your friends yet?" he went on&mdash;and now I
sensed something deeply sinister in him. "No! It is too bad!
Well, don't give up hope." He turned to O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, I would like to speak to you&mdash;alone!"</p>

<p>"I've no secrets from Goodwin," answered O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"So?" queried Marakinoff, suavely. He bent, whispered to
Larry.</p>

<p>The Irishman started, eyed him with a certain shocked
incredulity, then turned to me.</p>

<p>"Just a minute, Doc!" he said, and I caught the suspicion of a
wink. They drew aside, out of ear-shot. The Russian talked
rapidly. Larry was all attention. Marakinoff's earnestness became
intense; O'Keefe interrupted &mdash;appeared to question.
Marakinoff glanced at me and as his gaze shifted from O'Keefe, I
saw a flame of rage and horror blaze up in the latter's eyes. At
last the Irishman appeared to consider gravely; nodded as though
he had arrived at some decision, and Marakinoff thrust his hand
to him.</p>

<p>And only I could have noticed Larry's shrinking, his
microscopic hesitation before he took it, and his involuntary
movement, as though to shake off something unclean, when the
clasp had ended.</p>

<p>Marakinoff, without another look at me, turned and went
quickly within. The guards took their places. I looked at Larry
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Don't ask a thing now, Doc!" he said tensely. "Wait till we
get home. But we've got to get damned busy and quick&mdash;I'll
tell you that now&mdash;"</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a>20. &mdash; THE TEMPTING OF
LARRY</h2>

<p class="first">We paused before thick curtains, through which
came the faint murmur of many voices. They parted; out came
two&mdash;ushers, I suppose, they were &mdash;in cuirasses and
kilts that reminded me somewhat of chain-mail &mdash;the first
armour of any kind here that I had seen. They held open the
folds.</p>

<p>The chamber, on whose threshold we stood, was far larger than
either anteroom or hall of audience. Not less than three hundred
feet long and half that in depth, from end to end of it ran two
huge semi-circular tables, paralleling each other, divided by a
wide aisle, and heaped with flowers, with fruits, with viands
unknown to me, and glittering with crystal flagons, beakers,
goblets of as many hues as the blooms. On the gay-cushioned
couches that flanked the tables, lounging luxuriously, were
scores of the fair-haired ruling class and there rose a little
buzz of admiration, oddly mixed with a half-startled amaze, as
their gaze fell upon O'Keefe in all his silvery magnificence.
Everywhere the light-giving globes sent their roseate
radiance.</p>

<p>The cuirassed dwarfs led us through the aisle. Within the arc
of the inner half&mdash;circle was another glittering board, an
oval. But of those seated there, facing us&mdash;I had eyes for
only one&mdash;Yolara! She swayed up to greet O'Keefe&mdash;and
she was like one of those white lily maids, whose beauty
Hoang-Ku, the sage, says made the Gobi first a paradise, and
whose lusts later the burned-out desert that it is. She held out
hands to Larry, and on her face was passion&mdash;unashamed,
unhiding.</p>

<p>She was Circe&mdash;but Circe conquered. Webs of filmiest
white clung to the rose-leaf body. Twisted through the corn-silk
hair a threaded circlet of pale sapphires shone; but they were
pale beside Yolara's eyes. O'Keefe bent, kissed her hands,
something more than mere admiration flaming from him. She
saw&mdash;and, smiling, drew him down beside her.</p>

<p>It came to me that of all, only these two, Yolara and O'Keefe,
were in white&mdash;and I wondered; then with a tightening of
nerves ceased to wonder as there entered&mdash;Lugur! He was all
in scarlet, and as he strode forward a silence fell a tense,
strained silence.</p>

<p>His gaze turned upon Yolara, rested upon O'Keefe, and
instantly his face grew&mdash;dreadful&mdash;there is no other
word than that for it. Marakinoff leaned forward from the center
of the table, near whose end I sat, touched and whispered to him
swiftly. With appalling effort the red dwarf controlled himself;
he saluted the priestess ironically, I thought; took his place at
the further end of the oval. And now I noted that the figures
between were the seven of that Council of which the Shining One's
priestess and Voice were the heads. The tension relaxed, but did
not pass&mdash;as though a storm-cloud should turn away, but
still lurk, threatening.</p>

<p>My gaze ran back. This end of the room was draped with the
exquisitely colored, graceful curtains looped with gorgeous
garlands. Between curtains and table, where sat Larry and the
nine, a circular platform, perhaps ten yards in diameter, raised
itself a few feet above the floor, its gleaming surface
half-covered with the luminous petals, fragrant, delicate.</p>

<p>On each side below it, were low carven stools. The curtains
parted and softly entered girls bearing their flutes, their
harps, the curiously emotion-exciting, octaved drums. They sank
into their places. They touched their instruments; a faint,
languorous measure throbbed through the rosy air.</p>

<p>The stage was set! What was to be the play?</p>

<p>Now about the tables passed other dusky-haired maids, fair
bosoms bare, their scanty kirtles looped high, pouring out the
wines for the feasters.</p>

<p>My eyes sought O'Keefe. Whatever it had been that Marakinoff
had said, clearly it now filled his mind&mdash;even to the
exclusion of the wondrous woman beside him. His eyes were stern,
cold&mdash;and now and then, as he turned them toward the
Russian, filled with a curious speculation. Yolara watched him,
frowned, gave a low order to the Hebe behind her.</p>

<p>The girl disappeared, entered again with a ewer that seemed
cut of amber. The priestess poured from it into Larry's glass a
clear liquid that shook with tiny sparkles of light. She raised
the glass to her lips, handed it to him. Half-smiling,
half-abstractedly, he took it, touched his own lips where hers
had kissed; drained it. A nod from Yolara and the maid refilled
his goblet.</p>

<p>At once there was a swift transformation in the Irishman. His
abstraction vanished; the sternness fled; his eyes sparkled. He
leaned caressingly toward Yolara; whispered. Her blue eyes
flashed triumphantly; her chiming laughter rang. She raised her
own glass&mdash;but within it was not that clear drink that
filled Larry's! And again he drained his own; and, lifting it,
full once more, caught the baleful eyes of Lugur, and held it
toward him mockingly. Yolara swayed close&mdash;alluring,
tempting. He arose, face all reckless gaiety; rollicking
deviltry.</p>

<p>"A toast!" he cried in English, "to the Shining One&mdash;and
may the hell where it belongs soon claim it!"</p>

<p>He had used their own word for their god&mdash;all else had
been in his own tongue, and so, fortunately, they did not
understand. But the contempt in his action they did
recognize&mdash;and a dead, a fearful silence fell upon them all.
Lugur's eyes blazed, little sparks of crimson in their green. The
priestess reached up, caught at O'Keefe. He seized the soft hand;
caressed it; his gaze grew far away, sombre.</p>

<p>"The Shining One." He spoke low. "An' now again I see the
faces of those who dance with it. It is the Fires of
Mora&mdash;come, God alone knows how &mdash;from Erin&mdash;to
this place. The Fires of Mora!" He contemplated the hushed folk
before him; and then from his lips came that weirdest, most
haunting of the lyric legends of Erin&mdash;the Curse of
Mora:</p>

<p class="poem">"The fretted fires of Mora blew o'er him in the
night;<br> He thrills no more to loving, nor weeps for past
delight.<br> For when those flames have bitten, both grief and
joy take flight&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Yolara tried to draw him down beside her; and once more
he gripped her hand. His eyes grew fixed&mdash;he crooned:</p>

<p class="poem">"And through the sleeping silence his feet must
track the tune,<br> When the world is barred and speckled with
silver of the moon&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stood, swaying, for a moment, and then, laughing, let the
priestess have her way; drained again the glass.</p>

<p>And now my heart was cold, indeed&mdash;for what hope was
there left with Larry mad, wild drunk!</p>

<p>The silence was unbroken&mdash;elfin women and dwarfs glancing
furtively at each other. But now Yolara arose, face set, eyes
flashing grey.</p>

<p>"Hear you, the Council, and you, Lugur&mdash;and all who are
here!" she cried. "Now I, the priestess of the Shining One, take,
as is my right, my mate. And this is he!" She pointed down upon
Larry. He glanced up at her.</p>

<p>"Can't quite make out what you say, Yolara," he muttered
thickly. "But say anything&mdash;you like&mdash;I love your
voice!"</p>

<p>I turned sick with dread. Yolara's hand stole softly upon the
Irishman's curls caressingly.</p>

<p>"You know the law, Yolara." Lugur's voice was flat, deadly,
"You may not mate with other than your own kind. And this man is
a stranger&mdash;a barbarian&mdash;food for the Shining One!"
Literally, he spat the phrase.</p>

<p>"No, not of our kind&mdash;Lugur&mdash;higher!" Yolara
answered serenely. "Lo, a son of Siya and of Siyana!"</p>

<p>"A lie!" roared the red dwarf. "A lie!"</p>

<p>"The Shining One revealed it to me!" said Yolara sweetly. "And
if ye believe not, Lugur&mdash;go ask of the Shining One if it be
not truth!"</p>

<p>There was bitter, nameless menace in those last
words&mdash;and whatever their hidden message to Lugur, it was
potent. He stood, choking, face hell-shadowed&mdash;Marakinoff
leaned out again, whispered. The red dwarf bowed, now wholly
ironically; resumed his place and his silence. And again I
wondered, icy-hearted, what was the power the Russian had so to
sway Lugur.</p>

<p>"What says the Council?" Yolara demanded, turning to them.</p>

<p>Only for a moment they consulted among themselves. Then the
woman, whose face was a ravaged shrine of beauty, spoke.</p>

<p>"The will of the priestess is the will of the Council!" she
answered.</p>

<p>Defiance died from Yolara's face; she looked down at Larry
tenderly. He sat swaying, crooning.</p>

<p>"Bid the priests come," she commanded, then turned to the
silent room. "By the rites of Siya and Siyana, Yolara takes their
son for her mate!" And again her hand stole down possessingly,
serpent soft, to the drunken head of the O'Keefe.</p>

<p>The curtains parted widely. Through them filed, two by two,
twelve hooded figures clad in flowing robes of the green one sees
in forest vistas of opening buds of dawning spring. Of each pair
one bore clasped to breast a globe of that milky crystal in the
sapphire shrine-room; the other a harp, small, shaped somewhat
like the ancient <a title= "a small harp with wire strings, used
in the folk and early music of Scotland and Ireland">
<i>clàrsach</i></a> of the Druids.</p>

<p>Two by two they stepped upon the raised platform, placed
gently upon it each their globe; and two by two crouched behind
them. They formed now a star of six points about the petaled
dais, and, simultaneously, they drew from their faces the
covering cowls.</p>

<p>I half-rose&mdash;youths and maidens these of the fair-haired;
and youths and maids more beautiful than any of those I had yet
seen&mdash;for upon their faces was little of that disturbing
mockery to which I have been forced so often, because of the deep
impression it made upon me, to refer. The ashen-gold of the
maiden priestesses' hair was wound about their brows in shining
coronals. The pale locks of the youths were clustered within
circlets of translucent, glimmering gems like moonstones. And
then, crystal globe alternately before and harp alternately held
by youth and maid, they began to sing.</p>

<p>What was that song, I do not know&mdash;nor ever shall.
Archaic, ancient beyond thought, it seemed&mdash;not with the
ancientness of things that for uncounted ages have been but
wind-driven dust. Rather was it the ancientness of the golden youth of
the world, love lilts of earth younglings, with light of new-born
suns drenching them, chorales of young stars mating in space;
murmurings of April gods and goddesses. A languor stole through
me. The rosy lights upon the tripods began to die away, and as
they faded the milky globes gleamed forth brighter, ever
brighter. Yolara rose, stretched a hand to Larry, led him through
the sextuple groups, and stood face to face with him in the
center of their circle.</p>

<p>The rose-light died; all that immense chamber was black, save
for the circle of the glowing spheres. Within this their milky
radiance grew brighter &mdash;brighter. The song whispered away.
A throbbing arpeggio dripped from the harps, and as the notes
pulsed out, up from the globes, as though striving to follow,
pulsed with them tips of moon-fire cones, such as I had seen
before Yolara's altar. Weirdly, caressingly, compellingly the
harp notes throbbed in repeated, re-repeated theme, holding
within itself the same archaic golden quality I had noted in the
singing. And over the moon flame pinnacles rose higher!</p>

<p>Yolara lifted her arms; within her hands were clasped
O'Keefe's. She raised them above their two heads and slowly,
slowly drew him with her into a circling, graceful step,
tendrilings delicate as the slow spiralings of twilight mist upon
some still stream.</p>

<p>As they swayed the rippling arpeggios grew louder, and
suddenly the slender pinnacles of moon fire bent, dipped, flowed
to the floor, crept in a shining ring around those two&mdash;and
began to rise, a gleaming, glimmering, enchanted
barrier&mdash;rising, ever rising&mdash;hiding them!</p>

<p>With one swift movement Yolara unbound her circlet of pale
sapphires, shook loose the waves of her silken hair. It fell, a
rippling, wondrous cascade, veiling both her and O'Keefe to their
girdles&mdash;and now the shining coils of moon fire had crept to
their knees&mdash;was circling higher&mdash;higher.</p>

<p>And ever despair grew deeper in my soul!</p>

<p>What was that! I started to my feet, and all around me in the
darkness I heard startled motion. From without came a blaring of
trumpets, the sound of running men, loud murmurings. The tumult
drew closer. I heard cries of "Lakla! Lakla!" Now it was at the
very threshold and within it, oddly, as
though&mdash;punctuating&mdash;the clamor, a deep-toned, almost
abysmal, booming sound&mdash;thunderously bass and
reverberant.</p>

<p>Abruptly the harpings ceased; the moon fires shuddered, fell,
and began to sweep back into the crystal globes; Yolara's swaying
form grew rigid, every atom of it listening. She threw aside the
veiling cloud of hair, and in the gleam of the last retreating
spirals her face glared out like some old Greek mask of
tragedy.</p>

<p>The sweet lips that even at their sweetest could never lose
their delicate cruelty, had no sweetness now. They were drawn
into a square&mdash;inhuman as that of the Medusa; in her eyes
were the fires of the pit, and her hair seemed to writhe like the
serpent locks of that Gorgon whose mouth she had borrowed; all
her beauty was transformed into a nameless thing&mdash; hideous,
inhuman, blasting! If this was the true soul of Yolara springing
to her face, then, I thought, God help us in very deed!</p>

<p>I wrested my gaze away to O'Keefe. All drunkenness gone,
himself again, he was staring down at her, and in his eyes were
loathing and horror unutterable. So they stood&mdash;and the
light fled.</p>

<p>Only for a moment did the darkness hold. With lightning
swiftness the blackness that was the chamber's other wall
vanished. Through a portal open between grey screens, the silver
sparkling radiance poured.</p>

<p>And through the portal marched, two by two, incredible,
nightmare figures &mdash;frog-men, giants, taller by nearly a
yard than even tall O'Keefe! Their enormous saucer eyes were
irised by wide bands of green-flecked red, in which the
phosphorescence flickered. Their long muzzles, lips half-open in
monstrous grin, held rows of glistening, slender, lancet sharp
fangs. Over the glaring eyes arose a horny helmet, a carapace of
black and orange scales, studded with foot-long lance-headed
horns.</p>

<p>They lined themselves like soldiers on each side of the wide
table aisle, and now I could see that their horny armour covered
shoulders and backs, ran across the chest in a knobbed cuirass,
and at wrists and heels jutted out into curved, murderous spurs.
The webbed hands and feet ended in yellow, spade-shaped
claws.</p>

<p>They carried spears, ten feet, at least, in length, the heads
of which were pointed cones, glistening with that same covering,
from whose touch of swift decay I had so narrowly saved
Rador.</p>

<p>They were grotesque, yes&mdash;more grotesque than anything I
had ever seen or dreamed, and they were&mdash;terrible!</p>

<p>And then, quietly, through their ranks came&mdash;a girl!
Behind her, enormous pouch at his throat swelling in and out
menacingly, in one paw a treelike, spike-studded mace, a
frog-man, huger than any of the others, guarding. But of him I
caught but a fleeting, involuntary impression&mdash; all my gaze
was for her.</p>

<p>For it was she who had pointed out to us the way from the
peril of the Dweller's lair on Nan-Tauach. And as I looked at
her, I marvelled that ever could I have thought the priestess
more beautiful. Into the eyes of O'Keefe rushed joy and an utter
abasement of shame.</p>

<p>And from all about came murmurs&mdash;edged with anger,
half-incredulous, tinged with fear:</p>

<p>"Lakla!"</p>

<p>"Lakla!"</p>

<p>"The handmaiden!"</p>

<p>She halted close beside me. From firm little chin to dainty
buskined feet she was swathed in the soft robes of dull, almost
coppery hue. The left arm was hidden, the right free and gloved.
Wound tight about it was one of the vines of the sculptured wall
and of Lugur's circled signet-ring. Thick, a vivid green, its
five tendrils ran between her fingers, stretching out five
flowered heads that gleamed like blossoms cut from gigantic,
glowing rubies.</p>

<p>So she stood contemplating Yolara. Then drawn perhaps by my
gaze, she dropped her eyes upon me; golden, translucent, with
tiny flecks of amber in their aureate irises, the soul that
looked through them was as far removed from that flaming out of
the priestess as zenith is above nadir.</p>

<p>I noted the low, broad brow, the proud little nose, the tender
mouth, and the soft&mdash;sunlight&mdash;glow that seemed to
transfuse the delicate skin. And suddenly in the eyes dawned a
smile&mdash;sweet, friendly, a touch of roguishness, profoundly
reassuring in its all humanness. I felt my heart expand as though
freed from fetters, a recrudescence of confidence in the
essential reality of things&mdash;as though in nightmare the
struggling consciousness should glimpse some familiar face and
know the terrors with which it strove were but dreams. And
involuntarily I smiled back at her.</p>

<p>She raised her head and looked again at Yolara, contempt and a
certain curiosity in her gaze; at O'Keefe&mdash;and through the
softened eyes drifted swiftly a shadow of sorrow, and on its
fleeting wings deepest interest, and hovering over that a naive
approval as reassuringly human as had been her smile.</p>

<p>She spoke, and her voice, deep-timbred, liquid gold as was
Yolara's all silver, was subtly the synthesis of all the golden
glowing beauty of her.</p>

<p>"The Silent Ones have sent me, O Yolara," she said. "And this
is their command to you&mdash;that you deliver to me to bring
before them three of the four strangers who have found their way
here. For him there who plots with Lugur"&mdash;she pointed at
Marakinoff, and I saw Yolara start&mdash; "they have no need.
Into his heart the Silent Ones have looked; and Lugur and you may
keep him, Yolara!"</p>

<p>There was honeyed venom in the last words.</p>

<p>Yolara was herself now; only the edge of shrillness on her
voice revealed her wrath as she answered.</p>

<p>"And whence have the Silent Ones gained power to command,
<i>choya</i>?"</p>

<p>This last, I knew, was a very vulgar word; I had heard Rador
use it in a moment of anger to one of the serving maids, and it
meant, approximately, "kitchen girl," "scullion." Beneath the
insult and the acid disdain, the blood rushed up under Lakla's
ambered ivory skin.</p>

<p>"Yolara"&mdash;her voice was low&mdash;"of no use is it to
question me. I am but the messenger of the Silent Ones. And one
thing only am I bidden to ask you&mdash;do you deliver to me the
three strangers?"</p>

<p>Lugur was on his feet; eagerness, sardonic delight, sinister
anticipation thrilling from him&mdash;and my same glance showed
Marakinoff, crouched, biting his finger-nails, glaring at the
Golden Girl.</p>

<p>"No!" Yolara spat the word. "No! No! By Thanaroa and by the
Shining One, no!" Her eyes blazed, her nostrils were wide, in her
fair throat a little pulse beat angrily. "You, Lakla&mdash;take
you my message to the Silent Ones. Say to them that I keep this
man"&mdash;she pointed to Larry&mdash; "because he is mine. Say
to them that I keep the yellow-haired one and him" &mdash;she
pointed to me&mdash;"because it pleases me.</p>

<p>"Tell them that upon their mouths I place my foot,
so!"&mdash;she stamped upon the dais viciously&mdash;"and that in
their faces I spit!" &mdash;and her action was hideously
snakelike. "And say last to them, you handmaiden, that if
<i>you</i> they dare send to Yolara again, she will feed
<i>you</i> to the Shining One! Now&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>The handmaiden's face was white.</p>

<p>"Not unforeseen by the three was this, Yolara," she replied.
"And did you speak as you have spoken then was I bidden to say
this to you." Her voice deepened. "Three <i>tal</i> have you to
take counsel, Yolara. And at the end of that time these things
must you have determined&mdash;either to do or not to do: first,
send the strangers to the Silent Ones; second, give up, you and
Lugur and all of you, that dream you have of conquest of the
world without; and, third, forswear the Shining One! And if you
do not one and all these things, then are you done, your cup of
life broken, your wine of life spilled. Yea, Yolara, for you and
the Shining One, Lugur and the Nine and all those here and their
kind shall pass! This say the Silent Ones, 'Surely shall all of
ye pass and be as though never had ye been!'"</p>

<p>Now a gasp of rage and fear arose from all those around
me&mdash;but the priestess threw back her head and laughed loud
and long. Into the silver sweet chiming of her laughter clashed
that of Lugur&mdash;and after a little the nobles took it up,
till the whole chamber echoed with their mirth. O'Keefe, lips
tightening, moved toward the Handmaiden, and almost
imperceptibly, but peremptorily, she waved him back.</p>

<p>"Those <i>are</i> great words&mdash;great words indeed,
<i>choya</i>," shrilled Yolara at last; and again Lakla winced
beneath the word. "Lo, for <i>laya</i> upon <i>laya</i>, the
Shining One has been freed from the Three; and for <i>laya</i>
upon <i>laya</i> they have sat helpless, rotting. Now I ask you
again&mdash;whence comes their power to lay their will upon me,
and whence comes their strength to wrestle with the Shining One
and the beloved of the Shining One?"</p>

<p>And again she laughed&mdash;and again Lugur and all the
fair-haired joined in her laughter.</p>

<p>Into the eyes of Lakla I saw creep a doubt, a wavering; as
though deep within her the foundations of her own belief were
none too firm.</p>

<p>She hesitated, turning upon O'Keefe gaze in which rested more
than suggestion of appeal! And Yolara saw, too, for she flushed
with triumph, stretched a finger toward the handmaiden.</p>

<p>"Look!" she cried. "Look! Why, even <i>she</i> does not
believe!" Her voice grew silk of silver&mdash;merciless, cruel.
"Now am I minded to send another answer to the Silent Ones. Yea!
But not by <i>you</i>, Lakla; by these"&mdash;she pointed to the
frog-men, and, swift as light, her hand darted into her bosom,
bringing forth the little shining cone of death.</p>

<p>But before she could level it the Golden Girl had released
that hidden left arm and thrown over her face a fold of the
metallic swathings. Swifter than Yolara, she raised the arm that
held the vine&mdash;and now I knew this was no inert blossoming
thing.</p>

<p>It was alive!</p>

<br>

Swifter than Yolara, she raised the arm that<br>

inert blossoming thing. It was alive!</p>
</div>
<br>


<p>It writhed down her arm, and its five rubescent flower heads
thrust out toward the priestess&mdash;vibrating, quivering, held
in leash only by the light touch of the handmaiden at its very
end.</p>

<p>From the swelling throat pouch of the monster behind her came
a succession of the reverberant boomings. The frog-men wheeled,
raised their lances, levelled them at the throng. Around the
reaching ruby flowers a faint red mist swiftly grew.</p>

<p>The silver cone dropped from Yolara's rigid fingers; her eyes
grew stark with horror; all her unearthly loveliness fled from
her; she stood pale-lipped. The Handmaiden dropped the protecting
veil&mdash;and now it was she who laughed.</p>

<p>"It would seem, then, Yolara, that there <i>is</i> a thing of
the Silent Ones ye fear!" she said. "Well&mdash;the kiss of the
<i>Yekta</i> I promise you in return for the embrace of your
Shining One."</p>

<p>She looked at Larry, long, searchingly, and suddenly again
with all that effect of sunlight bursting into dark places, her
smile shone upon him. She nodded, half gaily; looked down upon
me, the little merry light dancing in her eyes; waved her hand to
me.</p>

<p>She spoke to the giant frog-man. He wheeled behind her as she
turned, facing the priestess, club upraised, fangs glistening.
His troop moved not a jot, spears held high. Lakla began to pass
slowly&mdash;almost, I thought, tauntingly&mdash;and as she
reached the portal Larry leaped from the dais.</p>

<p>"<a title= "Irish: a term of endearment; 'darling', 'sweet
one'"><i>Alanna!"</i></a> he cried. "You'll not be leavin' me
just when I've found you!"</p>

<p>In his excitement he spoke in his own tongue, the velvet
brogue appealing. Lakla turned, contemplated O'Keefe, hesitant,
unquestionably longingly, irresistibly like a child making up her
mind whether she dared or dared not take a delectable something
offered her.</p>

<p>"I go with you," said O'Keefe, this time in her own speech.
"Come on, Doc!" He reached out a hand to me.</p>

<p>But now Yolara spoke. Life and beauty had flowed back into her
face, and in the purple eyes all her hosts of devils were
gathered.</p>

<p>"Do you forget what I promised you before Siya and Siyana? And
do you think that you can leave me&mdash;me&mdash;as though I
were a <i>choya</i>&mdash;like <i>her</i>." She pointed to Lakla.
Do you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, listen, Yolara," Larry interrupted almost plaintively.
"No promise has passed from me to you&mdash;and why would you
hold me?" He passed unconsciously into English. "Be a good sport,
Yolara," he urged, "You <i>have</i> got a very devil of a temper,
you know, and so have I; and we'd be really awfully uncomfortable
together. And why don't you get rid of that devilish pet of
yours, and be good!"</p>

<p>She looked at him, puzzled, Marakinoff leaned over, translated
to Lugur. The red dwarf smiled maliciously, drew near the
priestess; whispered to her what was without doubt as near as he
could come in the Murian to Larry's own very colloquial
phrases.</p>

<p>Yolara's lips writhed.</p>

<p>"Hear me, Lakla!" she cried. "Now would I not let you take
this man from me were I to dwell ten thousand <i>laya</i> in the
agony of the <i>Yekta's</i> kiss. This I swear to you&mdash;by
Thanaroa, by my heart, and by my strength&mdash;and may my
strength wither, my heart rot in my breast, and Thanaroa forget
me if I do!"</p>

<p>"Listen, Yolara"&mdash;began O'Keefe again.</p>

<p>"Be silent, you!" It was almost a shriek. And her hand again
sought in her breast for the cone of rhythmic death.</p>

<p>Lugur touched her arm, whispered again, The glint of guile
shone in her eyes; she laughed softly, relaxed.</p>

<p>"The Silent Ones, Lakla, bade you say that
they&mdash;allowed&mdash;me three <i>tal</i> to decide," she said
suavely. "Go now in peace, Lakla, and say that Yolara has heard,
and that for the three <i>tal</i> they&mdash; allow&mdash;her she
will take council." The handmaiden hesitated.</p>

<p>"The Silent Ones have said it," she answered at last. "Stay
you here, strangers"&mdash;the long lashes drooped as her eyes
met O'Keefe's and a hint of blush was in her cheeks&mdash;"stay
you here, strangers, till then. But, Yolara, see you on that
heart and strength you have sworn by that they come to no
harm&mdash;else that which you have invoked shall come upon you
swiftly indeed&mdash;and that I promise you," she added.</p>

<p>Their eyes met, clashed, burned into each other&mdash;black
flame from Abaddon and golden flame from Paradise.</p>

<p>"Remember!" said Lakla, and passed through the portal. The
gigantic frog-man boomed a thunderous note of command, his
grotesque guards turned and slowly followed their mistress; and
last of all passed out the monster with the mace.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>21. &mdash; LARRY'S
DEFIANCE</h2>

<p class="first">A clamor arose from all the chambers; stilled in
an instant by a motion of Yolara's hand. She stood silent,
regarding O'Keefe with something other now than blind wrath;
something half regretful, half beseeching. But the Irishman's
control was gone.</p>

<p>"Yolara,"&mdash;his voice shook with rage, and he threw
caution to the wind&mdash;"now hear <i>me</i>. I go where I will
and when I will. Here shall we stay until the time she named is
come. And then we follow her, whether you will or not. And if any
should have thought to stop us&mdash; tell them of that flame
that shattered the vase," he added grimly.</p>

<p>The wistfulness died out of her eyes, leaving them cold. But
no answer made she to him.</p>

<p>"What Lakla has said, the Council must consider, and at once."
The priestess was facing the nobles. "Now, friends of mine, and
friends of Lugur, must all feud, all rancor, between us end." She
glanced swiftly at Lugur. "The <i>ladala</i> are stirring, and
the Silent Ones threaten. Yet fear not &mdash;for are we not
strong under the Shining One? And now&mdash;leave us."</p>

<p>Her hand dropped to the table, and she gave, evidently, a
signal, for in marched a dozen or more of the green dwarfs.</p>

<p>"Take these two to their place," she commanded, pointing to
us.</p>

<p>The green dwarfs clustered about us. Without another look at
the priestess O'Keefe marched beside me, between them, from the
chamber. And it was not until we had reached the pillared
entrance that Larry spoke.</p>

<p>"I hate to talk like that to a woman, Doc," he said, "and a
pretty woman, at that. But first she played me with a marked
deck, and then not only pinched all the chips, but drew a gun on
me. What the hell! she nearly had me
&mdash;<i>married</i>&mdash;to her. I don't know what the stuff
was she gave me; but, take it from me, if I had the recipe for
that brew I could sell it for a thousand dollars a jolt at
Forty-second and Broadway.</p>

<p>"One jigger of it, and you forget there is a trouble in the
world; three of them, and you forget there is a world. No excuse
for it, Doc; and I don't care what you say or what Lakla may
say&mdash;it wasn't my fault, and I don't hold it up against
myself for a damn."</p>

<p>"I must admit that I'm a bit uneasy about her threats," I
said, ignoring all this. He stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"What're you afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Mostly," I answered dryly, "I have no desire to dance with
the Shining One!"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Goodwin," He took up his walk impatiently.
"I've all the love and admiration for you in the world; but this
place has got your nerve. Hereafter one Larry O'Keefe, of Ireland
and the little old U. S. A., leads this party. Nix on the tremolo
stop, nix on the superstition! I'm the works. Get me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I get you!" I exclaimed testily enough. "But to use your
own phrase, kindly can the repeated references to
superstition."</p>

<p>"Why should I?" He was almost wrathful. "You scientific people
build up whole philosophies on the basis of things you never saw,
and you scoff at people who believe in other things that you
think <i>they</i> never saw and that don't come under what you
label scientific. You talk about paradoxes &mdash;why, your
scientist, who thinks he is the most skeptical, the most
materialistic aggregation of atoms ever gathered at the exact
mathematical center of Missouri, has more blind faith than a
dervish, and more credulity, more superstition, than a cross-eyed
smoke beating it past a country graveyard in the dark of the
moon!"</p>

<p>"Larry!" I cried, dazed.</p>

<p>"Olaf's no better," he said. "But I can make allowances for
him. He's a sailor. No, sir. What this expedition needs is a man
without superstition. And remember this. The <a title= "an elf in
Irish folklore who can reveal hidden treasure to those who catch
them"> <i>leprechaun</i></a> promised that I'd have full warning
before anything happened. And if we do have to go out, we'll see
that <a title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to
presage, by wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a>
bunch clean up before we do, and pass in a blaze of glory. And
don't forget it. Hereafter&mdash;I'm&mdash;in&mdash;charge!"</p>

<p>By this time we were before our pavilion; and neither of us in
a very amiable mood I'm afraid. Rador was awaiting us with a
score of his men.</p>

<p>"Let none pass in here without authority&mdash;and let none
pass out unless I accompany them," he ordered bruskly. "Summon
one of the swiftest of the <i>coria</i> and have it wait in
readiness," he added, as though by afterthought.</p>

<p>But when we had entered and the screens were drawn together
his manner changed; all eagerness he questioned us. Briefly we
told him of the happenings at the feast, of Lakla's dramatic
interruption, and of what had followed.</p>

<p>"Three <i>tal</i>," he said musingly; "three <i>tal</i> the
Silent Ones have allowed&mdash;and Yolara agreed." He sank back,
silent and thoughtful.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *A <i>tal</i> in Muria is the equivalent of
thirty hours of earth surface time.&mdash;W.T.G. ]</p>

<p>"<i>Ja!</i>" It was Olaf. "<i>Ja!</i> I told you the Shining
Devil's mistress was all evil. <i>Ja!</i> Now I begin again that
tale I started when he came"&mdash;he glanced toward the
preoccupied Rador. "And tell him not what I say should he ask.
For I trust none here in <i>trolldom</i>, save the
<i>Jomfru</i>&mdash;the White Virgin!</p>

<p>"After the oldster was <i>adsprede</i>"&mdash;Olaf once more
used that expressive Norwegian word for the dissolving of
Songar&mdash;"I knew that it was a time for cunning. I said to
myself, 'If they think I have no ears to hear, they will speak;
and it may be I will find a way to save my Helma and Dr.
Goodwin's friends, too.' <i>Ja</i>, and they did speak.</p>

<p>"The red <i>troll</i> asked the Russian how came it he was a
worshiper of Thanaroa." I could not resist a swift glance of
triumph toward O'Keefe. "And the Russian," rumbled Olaf, "said
that all his people worshipped Thanaroa and had fought against
the other nations that denied him.</p>

<p>"And then we had come to Lugur's palace. They put me in rooms,
and there came to me men who rubbed and oiled me and loosened my
muscles. The next day I wrestled with a great dwarf they called
Valdor. He was a mighty man, and long we struggled, and at last I
broke his back. And Lugur was pleased, so that I sat with him at
feast and with the Russian, too. And again, not knowing that I
understood them, they talked.</p>

<p>"The Russian had gone fast and far. They talked of Lugur as
emperor of all Europe, and Marakinoff under him. They spoke of
the green light that shook life from the oldster; and Lugur said
that the secret of it had been the Ancient Ones' and that the
Council had not too much of it. But the Russian said that among
his race were many wise men who could make more once they had
studied it.</p>

<p>"And the next day I wrestled with a great dwarf named Tahola,
mightier far than Valdor. Him I threw after a long, long time,
and his back also I broke. Again Lugur was pleased. And again we
sat at table, he and the Russian and I. This time they spoke of
something these <i>trolle</i> have which opens up a
<i>svelg</i>&mdash;abysses into which all in its range drops up
into the sky!"</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I know about them," said Larry. "Wait!"</p>

<p>"Lugur had drunk much," went on Olaf. "He was boastful. The
Russian pressed him to show this thing. After a while the red one
went out and came back with a little golden box. He and the
Russian went into the garden. I followed them. There was a
<i>lille haug</i>&mdash;a mound&mdash;of stones in that garden on
which grew flowers and trees.</p>

<p>"Lugur pressed upon the box, and a spark no bigger than a sand
grain leaped out and fell beside the stones. Lugur pressed again,
and a blue light shot from the box and lighted on the spark. The
spark that had been no bigger than a grain of sand grew and grew
as the blue struck it. And then there was a sighing, a wind
blew&mdash;and the stones and the flowers and the trees were not.
They were <i>forsvunnet</i>&mdash;vanished!</p>

<p>"Then Lugur, who had been laughing, grew quickly sober; for he
thrust the Russian back&mdash;far back. And soon down into the
garden came tumbling the stones and the trees, but broken and
shattered, and falling as though from a great height. And Lugur
said that of <i>this</i> something they had much, for its making
was a secret handed down by their own forefathers and not by the
Ancient Ones.</p>

<p>"They feared to use it, he said, for a spark thrice as large
as that he had used would have sent all that garden falling
upward and might have opened a way to the outside before&mdash;he
said just this&mdash;<i>'before we are ready to go out into
it!'</i></p>

<p>"The Russian questioned much, but Lugur sent for more drink
and grew merrier and threatened him, and the Russian was silent
through fear. Thereafter I listened when I could, and little more
I learned, but that little enough. <i>Ja!</i> Lugur is hot for
conquest; so Yolara and so the Council. They tire of it here and
the Silent Ones make their minds not too easy, no, even though
they jeer at them! And this they plan&mdash;to rule our world
with their Shining Devil."</p>

<p>The Norseman was silent for a moment; then voice deep,
trembling&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Trolldom</i> is awake; <i>Helvete</i> crouches at Earth
Gate whining to be loosed into a world already devil ridden! And
we are but three!"</p>

<p>I felt the blood drive out of my heart. But Larry's was the
fighting face of the O'Keefes of a thousand years. Rador glanced
at him, arose, stepped through the curtains; returned swiftly
with the Irishman's uniform.</p>

<p>"Put it on," he said, bruskly; again fell back into his
silence and whatever O'Keefe had been about to say was submerged
in his wild and joyful whoop. He ripped from him glittering tunic
and leg swathings.</p>

<p>"Richard is himself again!" he shouted; and each garment as he
donned it, fanned his old devil-may-care confidence to a higher
flame. The last scrap of it on, he drew himself up before us.</p>

<p>"Bow down, ye divils!" he cried. "Bang your heads on the floor
and do homage to Larry the First, Emperor of Great Britain,
Autocrat of all Ireland, Scotland, England, and Wales, and
adjacent waters and islands! Kneel, ye scuts, kneel."</p>

<p>"Larry," I cried, "are you going crazy?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," he said. "I'm that and more if Comrade
Marakinoff is on the level. Whoop! Bring forth the royal jewels
an' put a whole new bunch of golden strings in Tara's harp an'
down with the Sassenach forever! Whoop!"</p>

<p>He did a wild jig.</p>

<p>"Lord how good the old togs feel," he grinned. "The touch of
'em has gone to my head. But it's straight stuff I'm telling you
about my empire."</p>

<p>He sobered.</p>

<p>"Not that it's not serious enough at that. A lot that Olaf's
told us I've surmised from hints dropped by Yolara. But I got the
full key to it from the Red himself when he stopped me just
before&mdash;before"&mdash;he reddened&mdash;"well, just before I
acquired that brand-new brand of souse.</p>

<p>"Maybe he had a hint&mdash;maybe he just surmised that I knew
a lot more than I did. And he thought Yolara and I were going to
be loving little turtle doves. Also he figured that Yolara had a
lot more influence with the Unholy Fireworks than Lugur. Also
that being a woman she could be more easily handled. All this
being so, what was the logical thing for himself to do? Sure, you
get me, Steve! Throw down Lugur and make an alliance with me! So
<i>he</i> calmly offered to ditch the red dwarf if I would
deliver Yolara. My reward from Russia was to be said emperorship!
Can you beat it? Good Lord!"</p>

<p>He went off into a perfect storm of laughter. But not to me in
the light of what Russia has done and has proved herself capable,
did this thing seem at all absurd; rather in it I sensed the dawn
of catastrophe colossal.</p>

<p>"And yet," he was quiet enough now, "I'm a bit scared. They've
got the <i>Keth</i> ray and those gravity-destroying
bombs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gravity-destroying bombs!" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "The little fairy that sent the trees and
stones kiting up from Lugur's garden. Marakinoff licked his lips
over them. They cut off gravity, just about as the shadow screens
cut off light&mdash;and consequently whatever's in their range
goes shooting just naturally up to the moon&mdash;</p>

<p>"They get my goat, why deny it?" went on Larry. "With them and
the <i>Keth</i> and gentle invisible soldiers walking around
assassinating at will&mdash;well, the worst Bolsheviki are only
puling babes, eh, Doc?</p>

<p>"I don't mind the Shining One," said O'Keefe, "one splash of a
downtown New York high-pressure fire hose would do for it! But
the others&mdash;are the goods! Believe me!"</p>

<p>But for once O'Keefe's confidence found no echo within me. Not
lightly, as he, did I hold that dread mystery, the
Dweller&mdash;and a vision passed before me, a vision of an
Apocalypse undreamed by the Evangelist.</p>

<p>A vision of the Shining One swirling into our world, a
monstrous, glorious flaming pillar of incarnate, eternal
Evil&mdash;of peoples passing through its radiant embrace into
that hideous, unearthly life-in-death which I had seen enfold the
sacrifices&mdash;of armies trembling into dancing atoms of
diamond dust beneath the green ray's rhythmic death&mdash;of
cities rushing out into space upon the wings of that other
demoniac force which Olaf had watched at work&mdash;of a haunted
world through which the assassins of the Dweller's court stole
invisible, carrying with them every passion of hell &mdash;of the
rallying to the Thing of every sinister soul and of the weak and
the unbalanced, mystics and carnivores of humanity alike; for
well I knew that, once loosed, not any nation could hold this
devil-god for long and that swiftly its blight would spread!</p>

<p>And then a world that was all colossal reek of cruelty and
terror; a welter of lusts, of hatreds and of torment; a chaos of
horror in which the Dweller waxing ever stronger, the ghastly
hordes of those it had consumed growing ever greater, wreaked its
inhuman will!</p>

<p>At the last a ruined planet, a cosmic plague, spinning through
the shuddering heavens; its verdant plains, its murmuring
forests, its meadows and its mountains manned only by a countless
crew of soulless, mindless dead-alive, their shells illumined
with the Dweller's infernal glory&mdash; and flaming over this
vampirized earth like a flare from some hell far, infinitely far,
beyond the reach of man's farthest flung imagining&mdash; the
Dweller!</p>

<p>Rador jumped to his feet; walked to the whispering globe. He
bent over its base; did something with its mechanism; beckoned to
us. The globe swam rapidly, faster than ever I had seen it
before. A low humming arose, changed into a murmur, and then from
it I heard Lugur's voice clearly.</p>

<p>"It is to be war then?"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of assent&mdash;from the Council, I
thought.</p>

<p>"I will take the tall one named&mdash;<i>Larree</i>." It was
the priestess's voice. "After the three <i>tal</i>, you may have
him, Lugur, to do with as you will."</p>

<p>"No!" it was Lugur's voice again, but with a rasp of anger.
"All must die."</p>

<p>"He shall die," again Yolara. "But I would that first he see
Lakla pass &mdash;and that she know what is to happen to
him."</p>

<p>"No!" I started&mdash;for this was Marakinoff. "Now is no
time, Yolara, for one's own desires. This is my counsel. At the
end of the three <i>tal</i> Lakla will come for our answer. Your
men will be in ambush and they will slay her and her escort
quickly with the <i>Keth</i>. But not till that is done must the
three be slain&mdash;and then quickly. With Lakla dead we shall
go forth to the Silent Ones&mdash;and I promise you that I will
find the way to destroy them!"</p>

<p>"It is well!" It was Lugur.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> well, Yolara." It was a woman's voice, and I
knew it for that old one of ravaged beauty. "Cast from your mind
whatever is in it for this stranger&mdash;either of love or
hatred. In this the Council is with Lugur and the man of
wisdom."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then came the priestess's voice, sullen
but&mdash; beaten.</p>

<p>"It is well!"</p>

<p>"Let the three be taken now by Rador to the temple and given
to the High Priest Sator"&mdash;thus Lugur&mdash;"until what we
have planned comes to pass."</p>

<p>Rador gripped the base of the globe; abruptly it ceased its
spinning. He turned to us as though to speak and even as he did
so its bell note sounded peremptorily and on it the color films
began to creep at their accustomed pace.</p>

<p>"I hear," the green dwarf whispered. "They shall be taken
there at once." The globe grew silent. He stepped toward us.</p>

<p>"You have heard," he turned to us.</p>

<p>"Not on your life, Rador," said Larry. "Nothing doing!" And
then in the Murian's own tongue. "We follow Lakla, Rador. And
<i>you</i> lead the way." He thrust the pistol close to the green
dwarf's side.</p>

<p>Rador did not move.</p>

<p>"Of what use, <i>Larree</i>?" he said, quietly. "Me you can
slay&mdash; but in the end you will be taken. Life is not held so
dear in Muria that my men out there or those others who can come
quickly will let you by&mdash; even though you slay many. And in
the end they will overpower you."</p>

<p>There was a trace of irresolution in O'Keefe's face.</p>

<p>"And," added Rador, "if I let you go I dance with the Shining
One&mdash; or worse!"</p>

<p>O'Keefe's pistol hand dropped.</p>

<p>"You're a good sport, Rador, and far be it from me to get you
in bad," he said. "Take us to the temple&mdash;when we get
there&mdash;well, your responsibility ends, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>The green dwarf nodded; on his face a curious
expression&mdash;was it relief? Or was it emotion higher than
this?</p>

<p>He turned curtly.</p>

<p>"Follow," he said. We passed out of that gay little pavilion
that had come to be home to us even in this alien place. The
guards stood at attention.</p>

<p>"You, Sattoya, stand by the globe," he ordered one of them.
"Should the <i>Afyo Maie</i> ask, say that I am on my way with
the strangers even as she has commanded."</p>

<p>We passed through the lines to the <i>corial</i> standing like
a great shell at the end of the runway leading into the green
road.</p>

<p>"Wait you here," he said curtly to the driver. The green dwarf
ascended to his seat, sought the lever and we swept on&mdash;on
and out upon the glistening obsidian.</p>

<p>Then Rador faced us and laughed.</p>

<p>"<i>Larree</i>," he cried, "I love you for that spirit of
yours! And did you think that Rador would carry to the temple
prison a man who would take the chances of torment upon his own
shoulders to save him? Or you, Goodwin, who saved him from the
rotting death? For what did I take the <i>corial</i> or lift the
veil of silence that I might hear what threatened you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swept the <i>corial</i> to the left, away from the temple
approach.</p>

<p>"I am done with Lugur and with Yolara and the Shining One!"
cried Rador. "My hand is for you three and for Lakla and those to
whom she is handmaiden!"</p>

<p>The shell leaped forward; seemed to fly.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>22. &mdash; THE CASTING OF
THE SHADOW</h2>

<p class="first">Now we were racing down toward that last span
whose ancientness had set it apart from all the other soaring
arches. The shell's speed slackened; we approached warily.</p>

<p>"We pass there?" asked O'Keefe.</p>

<p>The green dwarf nodded, pointing to the right where the bridge
ended in a broad platform held high upon two gigantic piers,
between which ran a spur from the glistening road. Platform and
bridge were swarming with men-at-arms; they crowded the parapets,
looking down upon us curiously but with no evidence of hostility.
Rador drew a deep breath of relief.</p>

<p>"We don't have to break our way through, then?" There was
disappointment in the Irishman's voice.</p>

<p>"No use, <i>Larree</i>!" Smiling, Rador stopped the
<i>corial</i> just beneath the arch and beside one of the piers.
"Now, listen well. They have had no warning, hence does Yolara
still think us on the way to the temple. This is the gateway of
the Portal&mdash;and the gateway is closed by the Shadow. Once I
commanded here and I know its laws. This must I do&mdash;by craft
persuade Serku, the keeper of the gateway, to lift the Shadow; or
raise it myself. And that will be hard and it may well be that in
the struggle life will be stripped of us all. Yet is it better to
die fighting than to dance with the Shining One!"</p>

<p>He swept the shell around the pier. Opened a wide plaza paved
with the volcanic glass, but black as that down which we had sped
from the chamber of the Moon Pool. It shone like a mirrored
lakelet of jet; on each side of it arose what at first glance
seemed towering bulwarks of the same ebon obsidian; at second,
revealed themselves as structures hewn and set in place by men;
polished faces pierced by dozens of high, narrow windows.</p>

<p>Down each facade a stairway fell, broken by small landings on
which a door opened; they dropped to a broad ledge of grayish
stone edging the lip of this midnight pool and upon it also fell
two wide flights from either side of the bridge platform. Along
all four stairways the guards were ranged; and here and there
against the ledge stood the shells&mdash;in a curiously
comforting resemblance to parked motors in our own world.</p>

<p>The sombre walls bulked high; curved and ended in two
obelisked pillars from which, like a tremendous curtain,
stretched a barrier of that tenebrous gloom which, though
weightless as shadow itself, I now knew to be as impenetrable as
the veil between life and death. In this murk, unlike all others
I had seen, I sensed movement, a quivering, a tremor constant and
rhythmic; not to be seen, yet caught by some subtle sense; as
though through it beat a swift pulse of&mdash;black light.</p>

<p>The green dwarf turned the <i>corial</i> slowly to the edge at
the right; crept cautiously on toward where, not more than a
hundred feet from the barrier, a low, wide entrance opened in the
fort. Guarding its threshold stood two guards, armed with
broadswords, double-handed, terminating in a wide lunette mouthed
with murderous fangs. These they raised in salute and through the
portal strode a dwarf huge as Rador, dressed as he and carrying
only the poniard that was the badge of office of Muria's
captainry.</p>

<p>The green dwarf swept the shell expertly against the ledge;
leaped out.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Serku!" he answered. "I was but looking for the
<i>coria</i> of Lakla."</p>

<p>"Lakla!" exclaimed Serku. "Why, the handmaiden passed with her
<i>Akka</i> nigh a <i>va</i> ago!"</p>

<p>"Passed!" The astonishment of the green dwarf was so real that
half was I myself deceived. "You let her <i>pass?"</i></p>

<p>"Certainly I let her pass&mdash;" But under the green dwarf's
stern gaze the truculence of the guardian faded. "Why should I
not?" he asked, apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Because Yolara commanded otherwise," answered Rador,
coldly.</p>

<p>"There came no command to me." Little beads of sweat stood out
on Serku's forehead.</p>

<p>"Serku," interrupted the green dwarf swiftly, "truly is my
heart wrung for you. This is a matter of Yolara and of Lugur and
the Council; yes, even of the Shining One! And the message was
sent&mdash;and the fate, mayhap, of all Muria rested upon your
obedience and the return of Lakla with these strangers to the
Council. Now truly is my heart wrung, for there are few I would
less like to see dance with the Shining One than you, Serku," he
ended, softly.</p>

<p>Livid now was the gateway's guardian, his great frame
shaking.</p>

<p>"Come with me and speak to Yolara," he pleaded. "There came no
message &mdash;tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Serku!" There was a thrill as of inspiration in Rador's
voice. "This <i>corial</i> is of the swiftest&mdash;Lakla's are
of the slowest. With Lakla scarce a <i>va</i> ahead we can reach
her before she enters the Portal. Lift you the Shadow&mdash;we
will bring her back, and this will I do for you, Serku."</p>

<p>Doubt tempered Serku's panic.</p>

<p>"Why not go alone, Rador, leaving the strangers here with me?"
he asked &mdash;and I thought not unreasonably.</p>

<p>"Nay, then." The green dwarf was brusk. "Lakla will not return
unless I carry to her these men as evidence of our good faith.
Come&mdash;we will speak to Yolara and she shall judge
you&mdash;" He started away&mdash;but Serku caught his arm.</p>

<p>"No, Rador, no!" he whispered, again panic-stricken. "Go
you&mdash;as you will. But bring her back! Speed, Rador!" He
sprang toward the entrance. "I lift the Shadow&mdash;"</p>

<p>Into the green dwarf's poise crept a curious, almost a
listening, alertness. He leaped to Serku's side.</p>

<p>"I go with you," I heard. "Some little I can tell you&mdash;"
They were gone.</p>

<p>"Fine work!" muttered Larry. "Nominated for a citizen of
Ireland when we get out of this, one Rador of&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Shadow trembled&mdash;shuddered into nothingness; the
obelisked outposts that had held it framed a ribbon of roadway,
high banked with verdure, vanishing in green distances.</p>

<p>And then from the portal sped a shriek, a death cry! It cut
through the silence of the ebon pit like a whimpering arrow.
Before it had died, down the stairways came pouring the guards.
Those at the threshold raised their swords and peered within.
Abruptly Rador was between them. One dropped his hilt and gripped
him&mdash;the green dwarf's poniard flashed and was buried in his
throat. Down upon Rador's head swept the second blade. A flame
leaped from O'Keefe's hand and the sword seemed to fling itself
from its wielder's grasp &mdash;another flash and the soldier
crumpled. Rador threw himself into the shell, darted to the high
seat&mdash;and straight between the pillars of the Shadow we
flew!</p>

<p>There came a crackling, a darkness of vast wings flinging down
upon us. The <i>corial's</i> flight was checked as by a giant's
hand. The shell swerved sickeningly; there was an oddly metallic
splintering; it quivered; shot ahead. Dizzily I picked myself up
and looked behind.</p>

<p>The Shadow had fallen&mdash;but too late, a bare instant too
late. And shrinking as we fled from it, still it seemed to strain
like some fettered Afrit from Eblis, throbbing with wrath,
seeking with every malign power it possessed to break its bonds
and pursue. Not until long after were we to know that it had been
the dying hand of Serku, groping out of oblivion, that had cast
it after us as a fowler upon an escaping bird.</p>

<p>"Snappy work, Rador!" It was Larry speaking. "But they cut the
end off your bus all right!"</p>

<p>A full quarter of the hindward whorl was gone, sliced off
cleanly. Rador noted it with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"That is bad," he said, "but not too bad perhaps. All depends
upon how closely Lugur and his men can follow us."</p>

<p>He raised a hand to O'Keefe in salute.</p>

<p>"But to you, <i>Larree</i>, I owe my life&mdash;not even the
<i>Keth</i> could have been as swift to save me as that death
flame of yours&mdash; friend!"</p>

<p>The Irishman waved an airy hand.</p>

<p>"Serku"&mdash;the green dwarf drew from his girdle the
bloodstained poniard&mdash;"Serku I was forced to slay. Even as
he raised the Shadow the globe gave the alarm. Lugur follows with
twice ten times ten of his best&mdash;" He hesitated. "Though we
have escaped the Shadow it has taken toll of our swiftness. May
we reach the Portal before it closes upon Lakla &mdash;but if we
do not&mdash;" He paused again. "Well&mdash;I know a way
&mdash;but it is not one I am gay to follow&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>He snapped open the aperture that held the ball flaming within
the dark crystal; peered at it anxiously. I crept to the torn end
of the <i>corial</i>. The edges were crumbling, disintegrated.
They powdered in my fingers like dust. Mystified still, I crept
back where Larry, sheer happiness pouring from him, was whistling
softly and polishing up his automatic. His gaze fell upon Olaf's
grim, sad face and softened.</p>

<p>"Buck up, Olaf!" he said. "We've got a good fighting chance.
Once we link up with Lakla and her crowd I'm betting that we get
your wife&mdash;never doubt it! The baby&mdash;" he hesitated
awkwardly. The Norseman's eyes filled; he stretched a hand to the
O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"The <a title="Norwegian and Danish: 'darling'">
<i>yndling</i></a>&mdash; she is of the <a
title="Norwegian 'the dead'"><i>de døde</i></a>," he
half-whispered, "of the blessed dead. For her I have no fear and
for her vengeance will be given me. <i>Ja!</i> But my Helma&mdash;she
is of the dead-alive&mdash;like those we saw whirling like leaves
in the light of the Shining Devil&mdash;and I would that she too
were of <i>de døde</i> &mdash;and at rest. I do not know how to
fight the Shining Devil&mdash; no!"</p>

<p>His bitter despair welled up in his voice.</p>

<p>"Olaf," Larry's voice was gentle. "We'll come out on
top&mdash;I know it. Remember one thing. All this stuff that
seems so strange and&mdash;and, well, sort of supernatural, is
just a lot of tricks we're not hep to as yet. Why, Olaf, suppose
you took a Fijian when the war was on and set him suddenly down
in London with autos rushing past, sirens blowing, Archies
popping, a dozen enemy planes dropping bombs, and the
searchlights shooting all over the sky&mdash;wouldn't he think he
was among thirty-third degree devils in some exclusive circle of
hell? Sure he would! And yet everything he saw would be
natural&mdash;just as natural as all this is, once we get the
answer to it. Not that we're Fijians, of course, but the
principle is the same."</p>

<p>The Norseman considered this; nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"<i>Ja!</i>" he answered at last. "And at least we can fight.
That is why I have turned to Thor of the battles, <i>Ja!</i> And
<i>one</i> have I hope in for mine Helma&mdash;the white maiden.
Since I have turned to the old gods it has been made clear to me
that I shall slay Lugur and that the <a title= "Norwegian and
Danish: 'witch'"><i>heks</i></a>, the evil witch Yolara, shall
also die. But I would talk with the white maiden."</p>

<p>"All right," said Larry, "but just don't be afraid of what you
don't understand. There's another thing"&mdash;he hesitated,
nervously&mdash; "there's another thing that may startle you a
bit when we meet up with Lakla
&mdash;her&mdash;er&mdash;frogs!"</p>

<p>"Like the frog-woman we saw on the wall?" asked Olaf.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larry, rapidly. "It's this way&mdash;I figure
that the frogs grow rather large where she lives, and they're a
bit different too. Well, Lakla's got a lot of 'em trained. Carry
spears and clubs and all that junk&mdash;just like trained seals
or monkeys or so on in the circus. Probably a custom of the
place. Nothing queer about that, Olaf. Why people have all kinds
of pets&mdash;armadillos and snakes and rabbits, kangaroos and
elephants and tigers."</p>

<p>Remembering how the frog-woman had stuck in Larry's mind from
the outset, I wondered whether all this was not more to convince
himself than Olaf.</p>

<p>"Why, I remember a nice girl in Paris who had four pet
pythons&mdash;" he went on.</p>

<p>But I listened no more, for now I was sure of my surmise. The
road had begun to thrust itself through high-flung, sharply
pinnacled masses and rounded outcroppings of rock on which clung
patches of the amber moss.</p>

<p>The trees had utterly vanished, and studding the moss-carpeted
plains were only clumps of a willowy shrub from which hung, like
grapes, clusters of white waxen blooms. The light too had
changed; gone were the dancing, sparkling atoms and the silver
had faded to a soft, almost ashen grayness. Ahead of us marched a
rampart of coppery cliffs rising, like all these mountainous
walls we had seen, into the immensities of haze. Something long
drifting in my subconsciousness turned to startled realization.
The speed of the shell was slackening! The aperture containing
the ionizing mechanism was still open; I glanced within, The
whirling ball of fire was not dimmed, but its coruscations,
instead of pouring down through the cylinder, swirled and eddied
and shot back as though trying to re-enter their source. Rador
nodded grimly.</p>

<p>"The Shadow takes its toll," he said.</p>

<p>We topped a rise&mdash;Larry gripped my arm.</p>

<p>"Look!" he cried, and pointed. Far, far behind us, so far that
the road was but a glistening thread, a score of shining points
came speeding.</p>

<p>"Lugur and his men," said Rador.</p>

<p>"Can't you step on her?" asked Larry.</p>

<p>"Step on her?" repeated the green dwarf, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Give her more speed; push her," explained O'Keefe.</p>

<p>Rador looked about him. The coppery ramparts were close, not
more than three or four miles distant; in front of us the plain
lifted in a long rolling swell, and up this the <i>corial</i>
essayed to go&mdash;with a terrifying lessening of speed. Faintly
behind us came shootings, and we knew that Lugur drew close. Nor
anywhere was there sign of Lakla nor her frog-men.</p>

<p>Now we were half-way to the crest; the shell barely crawled
and from beneath it came a faint hissing; it quivered, and I knew
that its base was no longer held above the glassy surface but
rested on it.</p>

<p>"One last chance!" exclaimed Rador. He pressed upon the
control lever and wrenched it from its socket. Instantly the
sparkling ball expanded, whirling with prodigious rapidity and
sending a cascade of coruscations into the cylinder. The shell
rose; leaped through the air; the dark crystal split into
fragments; the fiery ball dulled; died&mdash;but upon the impetus
of that last thrust we reached the crest. Poised there for a
moment, I caught a glimpse of the road dropping down the side of
an enormous moss-covered, bowl-shaped valley whose sharply curved
sides ended abruptly at the base of the towering barrier.</p>

<p>Then down the steep, powerless to guide or to check the shell,
we plunged in a meteor rush straight for the annihilating
adamantine breasts of the cliffs!</p>

<p>Now the quick thinking of Larry's air training came to our
aid. As the rampart reared close he threw himself upon Rador;
hurled him and himself against the side of the flying whorl.
Under the shock the finely balanced machine swerved from its
course. It struck the soft, low bank of the road, shot high in
air, bounded on through the thick carpeting, whirled like a
dervish and fell upon its side. Shot from it, we rolled for
yards, but the moss saved broken bones or serious bruise.</p>

<p>"Quick!" cried the green dwarf. He seized an arm, dragged me
to my feet, began running to the cliff base not a hundred feet
away. Beside us raced O'Keefe and Olaf. At our left was the black
road. It stopped abruptly&mdash; was cut off by a slab of
polished crimson stone a hundred feet high, and as wide, set
within the coppery face of the barrier. On each side of it stood
pillars, cut from the living rock and immense, almost, as those
which held the rainbow veil of the Dweller. Across its face
weaved unnameable carvings &mdash;but I had no time for more than
a glance. The green dwarf gripped my arm again.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he cried again. "The handmaiden has passed!"</p>

<p>At the right of the Portal ran a low wall of shattered rock.
Over this we raced like rabbits. Hidden behind it was a narrow
path. Crouching, Rador in the lead, we sped along it; three
hundred, four hundred yards we raced &mdash;and the path ended in
a <i>cul de sac</i>! To our ears was borne a louder shouting.</p>

<p>The first of the pursuing shells had swept over the lip of the
great bowl, poised for a moment as we had and then began a
cautious descent. Within it, scanning the slopes, I saw
Lugur.</p>

<p>"A little closer and I'll get him!" whispered Larry viciously.
He raised his pistol.</p>

<p>His hand was caught in a mighty grip; Rador, eyes blazing,
stood beside him.</p>

<p>"No!" rasped the green dwarf. He heaved a shoulder against one
of the boulders that formed the pocket. It rocked aside,
revealing a slit.</p>

<p>"In!" ordered he, straining against the weight of the stone.
O'Keefe slipped through. Olaf at his back, I following. With a
lightning leap the dwarf was beside me, the huge rock missing him
by a hair breadth as it swung into place!</p>

<p>We were in Cimmerian darkness. I felt for my pocket-flash and
recalled with distress that I had left it behind with my medicine
kit when we fled from the gardens. But Rador seemed to need no
light.</p>

<p>"Grip hands!" he ordered. We crept, single file, holding to
each other like children, through the black. At last the green
dwarf paused.</p>

<p>"Await me here," he whispered. "Do not move. And for your
lives&mdash;be silent!"</p>

<p>And he was gone.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a>23. &mdash; DRAGON WORM AND
MOSS DEATH</h2>

<p class="first">For a small eternity&mdash;to me at
least&mdash;we waited. Then as silent as ever the green dwarf
returned. "It is well," he said, some of the strain gone from his
voice. "Grip hands again, and follow."</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, Rador," this was Larry. "Does Lugur know this
side entrance? If he does, why not let Olaf and me go back to the
opening and pick them off as they come in? We could hold the
lot&mdash;and in the meantime you and Goodwin could go after
Lakla for help."</p>

<p>"Lugur knows the secret of the Portal&mdash;if he dare use
it," answered the captain, with a curious indirection. "And now
that they have challenged the Silent Ones I think he <i>will</i>
dare. Also, he will find our tracks &mdash;and it may be that he
knows this hidden way."</p>

<p>"Well, for God's sake!" O'Keefe's appalled bewilderment was
almost ludicrous. "If <i>he</i> knows all that, and <i>you</i>
knew all that, why didn't you let me click him when I had the
chance?"</p>

<p>"<i>Larree</i>," the green dwarf was oddly humble. "It seemed
good to me, too&mdash;at first. And then I heard a command, heard
it clearly, to stop you&mdash;that Lugur die not now, lest a
greater vengeance fail!"</p>

<p>"Command? From whom?" The Irishman's voice distilled out of
the blackness the very essence of bewilderment.</p>

<p>"I thought," Rador was whispering&mdash;"I thought it came
from the Silent Ones!"</p>

<p>"Superstition!" groaned O'Keefe in utter exasperation. "Always
superstition! What can you do against it!</p>

<p>"Never mind, Rador." His sense of humor came to his aid. "It's
too late now, anyway. Where do we go from here, old dear?" he
laughed.</p>

<p>"We tread the path of one I am not fain to meet," answered
Rador. "But if meet we must, point the death tubes at the pale
shield he bears upon his throat and send the flame into the
flower of cold fire that is its center &mdash;nor look into his
eyes!"</p>

<p>Again Larry gasped, and I with him.</p>

<p>"It's getting too deep for me, Doc," he muttered dejectedly.
"Can you make head or tail of it?"</p>

<p>"No," I answered, shortly enough, "but Rador fears something
and that's his description of it."</p>

<p>"Sure," he replied, "only it's a code I don't understand." I
could feel his grin. "All right for the flower of cold fire,
Rador, and I won't look into his eyes," he went on cheerfully.
"But hadn't we better be moving?"</p>

<p>"Come!" said the soldier; again hand in hand we went blindly
on.</p>

<p>O'Keefe was muttering to himself.</p>

<p>"Flower of cold fire! Don't look into his eyes! Some joint!
Damned superstition." Then he chuckled and carolled, softly:</p>

<p class="poem">"Oh, mama, pin a cold rose on me;<br> Two young
frog-men are in love with me;<br> Shut my eyes so I can't
see."</p>

<p>"Sh!" Rador was warning; he began whispering. "For half a
<i>va</i> we go along a way of death. From its peril we pass into
another against whose dangers I can guard you. But in part this
is in view of the roadway and it may be that Lugur will see us.
If so, we must fight as best we can. If we pass these two roads
safely, then is the way to the Crimson Sea clear, nor need we
fear Lugur nor any. And there is another thing&mdash;that Lugur
does not know&mdash;when he opens the Portal the Silent Ones will
hear and Lakla and the <i>Akka</i> will be swift to greet its
opener."</p>

<p>"Rador," I asked, "how know <i>you</i> all this?"</p>

<p>"The handmaiden is my own sister's child," he answered
quietly.</p>

<p>O'Keefe drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Uncle," he remarked casually in English, "meet the man who's
going to be your nephew!"</p>

<p>And thereafter he never addressed the green dwarf except by
the avuncular title, which Rador, humorously enough, apparently
conceived to be one of respectful endearment.</p>

<p>For me a light broke. Plain now was the reason for his
foreknowledge of Lakla's appearance at the feast where Larry had
so narrowly escaped Yolara's spells; plain the determining factor
that had cast his lot with ours, and my confidence, despite his
discourse of mysterious perils, experienced a remarkable
quickening.</p>

<p>Speculation as to the marked differences in pigmentation and
appearance of niece and uncle was dissipated by my consciousness
that we were now moving in a dim half-light. We were in a fairly
wide tunnel. Not far ahead the gleam filtered, pale yellow like
sunlight sifting through the leaves of autumn poplars. And as we
drove closer to its source I saw that it did indeed pass through
a leafy screen hanging over the passage end. This Rador drew
aside cautiously, beckoned us and we stepped through.</p>

<p>It appeared to be a tunnel cut through soft green mould. Its
base was a flat strip of pathway a yard wide from which the walls
curved out in perfect cylindrical form, smoothed and evened with
utmost nicety. Thirty feet wide they were at their widest, then
drew toward each other with no break in their symmetry; they did
not close. Above was, roughly, a ten-foot rift, ragged edged,
through which poured light like that in the heart of pale amber,
a buttercup light shot through with curiously evanescent bronze
shadows.</p>

<p>"Quick!" commanded Rador, uneasily, and set off at a sharp
pace.</p>

<p>Now, my eyes accustomed to the strange light, I saw that the
tunnel's walls were of moss. In them I could trace fringe leaf
and curly leaf, pressings of enormous bladder caps
(Physcomitrium), immense splashes of what seemed to be the
scarlet-crested Cladonia, traceries of huge moss veils, crushings
of teeth (peristome) gigantic; spore cases brown and white,
saffron and ivory, hot vermilion and cerulean blues, pressed into
an astounding mosaic by some titanic force.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" It was Rador calling. I had lagged behind.</p>

<p>He quickened the pace to a half-run; we were climbing;
panting. The amber light grew stronger; the rift above us wider.
The tunnel curved; on the left a narrow cleft appeared. The green
dwarf leaped toward it, thrust us within, pushed us ahead of him
up a steep rocky fissure&mdash;well-nigh, indeed, a chimney. Up
and up this we scrambled until my lungs were bursting and I
thought I could climb no more. The crevice ended; we crawled out
and sank, even Rador, upon a little leaf-carpeted clearing
circled by lacy tree ferns.</p>

<p>Gasping, legs aching, we lay prone, relaxed, drawing back
strength and breath. Rador was first to rise. Thrice he bent low
as in homage, then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give thanks to the Silent Ones&mdash;for their power has been
over us!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Dimly I wondered what he meant. Something about the fern leaf
at which I had been staring aroused me. I leaped to my feet and
ran to its base. This was no fern, no! It was fern <i>moss</i>!
The largest of its species I had ever found in tropic jungles had
not been more than two inches high, and this was&mdash;twenty
feet! The scientific fire I had experienced in the tunnel
returned uncontrollable. I parted the fronds, gazed
out&mdash;</p>

<p>My outlook commanded a vista of miles&mdash;and that vista! A
<i>Fata Morgana</i> of plantdom! A land of flowered sorcery!</p>

<p>Forests of tree-high mosses spangled over with blooms of every
conceivable shape and color; cataracts and clusters, avalanches
and nets of blossoms in pastels, in dulled metallics, in gorgeous
flamboyant hues; some of them phosphorescent and shining like
living jewels; some sparkling as though with dust of opals, of
sapphires, of rubies and topazes and emeralds; thickets of
convolvuli like the trumpets of the seven archangels of Mara,
king of illusion, which are shaped from the bows of splendors
arching his highest heaven!</p>

<p>And moss veils like banners of a marching host of Titans;
pennons and bannerets of the sunset; gonfalons of the Jinn; webs
of faery; oriflammes of elfland!</p>

<p>Springing up through that polychromatic flood myriads of
pedicles&mdash; slender and straight as spears, or soaring in
spirals, or curving with undulations gracile as the white
serpents of Tanit in ancient Carthaginian groves&mdash;and all
surmounted by a fantasy of spore cases in shapes of minaret and
turret, domes and spires and cones, caps of Phrygia and bishops'
miters, shapes grotesque and unnameable&mdash;shapes delicate and
lovely!</p>

<p>They hung high poised, nodding and swaying&mdash;like goblins
hovering over Titania's court; cacophony of Cathay accenting the
<i>Flower Maiden</i> music of "Parsifal"; <i>bizarrerie</i> of
the angled, fantastic beings that people the Javan pantheon
watching a bacchanale of houris in Mohammed's paradise!</p>

<p>Down upon it all poured the amber light; dimmed in the
distances by huge, drifting darkenings lurid as the flying
mantles of the hurricane.</p>

<p>And through the light, like showers of jewels, myriads of
birds, darting, dipping, soaring, and still other myriads of
gigantic, shimmering butterflies.</p>

<p>A sound came to us, reaching out like the first faint susurrus
of the incoming tide; sighing, sighing, growing
stronger&mdash;now its mournful whispering quivered all about us,
shook us&mdash;then passing like a Presence, died away in far
distances.</p>

<p>"The Portal!" said Rador. "Lugur has entered!"</p>

<p>He, too, parted the fronds and peered back along our path.
Peering with him we saw the barrier through which we had come
stretching verdure-covered walls for miles three or more away.
Like a mole burrow in a garden stretched the trail of the tunnel;
here and there we could look down within the rift at its top; far
off in it I thought I saw the glint of spears.</p>

<p>"They come!" whispered Rador. "Quick! We must not meet them
here!"</p>

<p>And then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Holy St. Brigid!" gasped Larry.</p>

<p>From the rift in the tunnel's continuation, nigh a mile beyond
the cleft through which we had fled, lifted a crown of
horns&mdash;of tentacles &mdash;erect, alert, of mottled gold and
crimson; lifted higher&mdash;and from a monstrous scarlet head
beneath them blazed two enormous, obloid eyes, their depths wells
of purplish phosphorescence; higher still&mdash; noseless,
earless, chinless; a livid, worm mouth from which a slender
scarlet tongue leaped like playing flames! Slowly it
rose&mdash;its mighty neck cuirassed with gold and scarlet scales
from whose polished surfaces the amber light glinted like flakes
of fire; and under this neck shimmered something like a palely
luminous silvery shield, guarding it. The head of horror
mounted&mdash;and in the shield's center, full ten feet across,
glowing, flickering, shining out&mdash;coldly, was a rose of
white flame, a "flower of cold fire" even as Rador had said.</p>

<p>Now swiftly the Thing upreared, standing like a scaled tower a
hundred feet above the rift, its eyes scanning that movement I
had seen along the course of its lair. There was a hissing; the
crown of horns fell, whipped and writhed like the tentacles of an
octopus; the towering length dropped back.</p>

<p>"Quick!" gasped Rador and through the fern moss, along the
path and down the other side of the steep we raced.</p>

<p>Behind us for an instant there was a rushing as of a torrent;
a far-away, faint, agonized screaming&mdash;silence!</p>

<p>"No fear <i>now</i> from those who followed," whispered the
green dwarf, pausing.</p>

<p>"Sainted St. Patrick!" O'Keefe gazed ruminatively at his
automatic. "An' he expected me to kill <i>that</i> with this.
Well, as Fergus O'Connor said when they sent him out to slaughter
a wild bull with a potato knife: 'Ye'll niver rayilize how I
appreciate the confidence ye show in me!'</p>

<p>"What was it, Doc?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The dragon worm!" Rador said.</p>

<p>"It was <i>helvete-orm</i>&mdash;the hell-worm!" groaned
Olaf.</p>

<p>"There you go again&mdash;" blazed Larry; but the green dwarf
was hurrying down the path and swiftly we followed, Larry
muttering, Olaf mumbling, behind me.</p>

<p>The green dwarf was signalling us for caution. He pointed
through a break in a grove of fifty-foot cedar mosses&mdash;we
were skirting the glassy road! Scanning it we found no trace of
Lugur and wondered whether he too had seen the worm and had fled.
Quickly we passed on; drew away from the <i>coria</i> path. The
mosses began to thin; less and less they grew, giving way to low
clumps that barely offered us shelter. Unexpectedly another
screen of fern moss stretched before us. Slowly Rador made his
way through it and stood hesitating.</p>

<p>The scene in front of us was oddly weird and depressing; in
some indefinable way&mdash;dreadful. Why, I could not tell, but
the impression was plain; I shrank from it. Then, self-analyzing,
I wondered whether it could be the uncanny resemblance the heaps
of curious mossy fungi scattered about had to beast and
bird&mdash;yes, and to man&mdash;that was the cause of it. Our
path ran between a few of them. To the left they were thick. They
were viridescent, almost metallic hued&mdash;verd-antique.
Curiously indeed were they like distorted images of dog and
deerlike forms, of birds &mdash;of <i>dwarfs</i> and here and
there the simulacra of the giant frogs! Spore cases, yellowish
green, as large as miters and much resembling them in shape
protruded from the heaps. My repulsion grew into a distinct
nausea.</p>

<p>Rador turned to us a face whiter far than that with which he
had looked upon the dragon worm.</p>

<p>"Now for your lives," he whispered, "tread softly here as I
do&mdash;and speak not at all!"</p>

<p>He stepped forward on tiptoe, slowly with utmost caution. We
crept after him; passed the heaps beside the path&mdash;and as I
passed my skin crept and I shrank and saw the others shrink too
with that unnameable loathing; nor did the green dwarf pause
until he had reached the brow of a small hillock a hundred yards
beyond. And he was trembling.</p>

<p>"Now what are we up against?" grumbled O'Keefe.</p>

<p>The green dwarf stretched a hand; stiffened; gazed over to the
left of us beyond a lower hillock upon whose broad crest lay a
file of the moss shapes. They fringed it, their miters having a
grotesque appearance of watching what lay below. The glistening
road lay there&mdash;and from it came a shout. A dozen of the
<i>coria</i> clustered, filled with Lugur's men and in one of
them Lugur himself, laughing wickedly!</p>

<p>There was a rush of soldiers and up the low hillock raced a
score of them toward us.</p>

<p>"Run!" shouted Rador.</p>

<p>"Not much!" grunted Larry&mdash;and took swift aim at Lugur.
The automatic spat: Olaf's echoed. Both bullets went wild, for
Lugur, still laughing, threw himself into the protection of the
body of his shell. But following the shots, from the file of moss
heaps on the crest, came a series of muffled explosions. Under
the pistol's concussions the mitered caps had burst and instantly
all about the running soldiers grew a cloud of tiny, glistening
white spores&mdash;like a little cloud of puff-ball dust many
times magnified. Through this cloud I glimpsed their faces,
stricken with agony.</p>

<p>Some turned to fly, but before they could take a second step
stood rigid.</p>

<p>The spore cloud drifted and eddied about them; rained down on
their heads and half bare breasts, covered their
garments&mdash;and swiftly they began to change! Their features
grew indistinct&mdash;merged! The glistening white spores that
covered them turned to a pale yellow, grew greenish, spread and
swelled, darkened. The eyes of one of the soldiers glinted for a
moment &mdash;and then were covered by the swift growth!</p>

<p>Where but a few moments before had been men were only
grotesque heaps, swiftly melting, swiftly rounding into the
semblance of the mounds that lay behind us&mdash;and already
beginning to take on their gleam of ancient viridescence!</p>

<p>The Irishman was gripping my arm fiercely; the pain brought me
back to my senses.</p>

<p>"Olaf's right," he gasped. "This <i>is</i> hell! I'm sick."
And he was, frankly and without restraint. Lugur and his others
awakened from their nightmare; piled into the <i>coria</i>,
wheeled, raced away.</p>

<p>"On!" said Rador thickly. "Two perils have we passed&mdash;the
Silent Ones watch over us!"</p>

<p>Soon we were again among the familiar and so unfamiliar moss
giants. I knew what I had seen and this time Larry could not call
me&mdash; superstitious. In the jungles of Borneo I had examined
that other swiftly developing fungus which wreaks the vengeance
of some of the hill tribes upon those who steal their women;
gripping with its microscopic hooks into the flesh; sending
quick, tiny rootlets through the skin down into the capillaries,
sucking life and thriving and never to be torn away until the
living thing it clings to has been sapped dry. Here was but
another of the species in which the development's rate was
incredibly accelerated. Some of this I tried to explain to
O'Keefe as we sped along, reassuring him.</p>

<p>"But they turned to moss before our eyes!" he said.</p>

<p>Again I explained, patiently. But he seemed to derive no
comfort at all from my assurances that the phenomena were
entirely natural and, aside from their more terrifying aspect, of
peculiar interest to the botanist.</p>

<p>"I know," was all he would say. "But suppose one of those
things had burst while we were going through&mdash;God!"</p>

<p>I was wondering how I could with comparative safety study the
fungus when Rador stopped; in front of us was again the road
ribbon.</p>

<p>"Now is all danger passed," he said. "The way lies open and
Lugur has fled&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a flash from the road. It passed me like a little
lariat of light. It struck Larry squarely between the eyes,
spread over his face and drew itself within!</p>

<p>"Down!" cried Rador, and hurled me to the ground. My head
struck sharply; I felt myself grow faint; Olaf fell beside me; I
saw the green dwarf draw down the O'Keefe; he collapsed limply,
face still, eyes staring. A shout &mdash;and from the roadway
poured a host of Lugur's men; I could hear Lugur bellowing.</p>

<p>There came a rush of little feet; soft, fragrant draperies
brushed my face; dimly I watched Lakla bend over the
Irishman.</p>

<p>She straightened&mdash;her arms swept out and the writhing
vine, with its tendriled heads of ruby bloom, five flames of
misty incandescence, leaped into the faces of the soldiers now
close upon us. It darted at their throats, striking, coiling, and
striking again; coiling and uncoiling with incredible rapidity
and flying from leverage points of throats, of faces, of breasts
like a spring endowed with consciousness, volition and
hatred&mdash;and those it struck stood rigid as stone with faces
masks of inhuman fear and anguish; and those still unstricken
fled.</p>

<p>Another rush of feet&mdash;and down upon Lugur's forces poured
the frog-men, their booming giant leading, thrusting with their
lances, tearing and rending with talons and fangs and spurs.</p>

<p>Against that onslaught the dwarfs could not stand. They raced
for the shells; I heard Lugur shouting, menacingly&mdash;and then
Lakla's voice, pealing like a golden bugle of wrath.</p>

<p>"Go, Lugur!" she cried. "Go&mdash;that you and Yolara and your
Shining One may die together! Death for you, Lugur&mdash;death
for you all! Remember Lugur&mdash;death!"</p>

<p>There was a great noise within my head&mdash;no matter, Lakla
was here &mdash;Lakla here&mdash;but too late&mdash;Lugur had
outplayed us; moss death nor dragon worm had frightened him
away&mdash;he had crept back to trap us&mdash;Lakla had come too
late&mdash;Larry was dead&mdash;Larry! But I had heard no <a
title= "a female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage,
by wailing, a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a>
wailing&mdash;and Larry had said he could not die without that
warning&mdash;no, Larry was not dead. So ran the turbulent
current of my mind.</p>

<p>A horny arm lifted me; two enormous, oddly gentle saucer eyes
were staring into mine; my head rolled; I caught a glimpse of the
Golden Girl kneeling beside the O'Keefe.</p>

<p>The noise in my head grew thunderous&mdash;was carrying me
away on its thunder&mdash;swept me into soft, blind darkness.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a>24. &mdash; THE CRIMSON
SEA</h2>

<p class="first">I was in the heart of a rose pearl, swinging,
swinging; no, I was in a rosy dawn cloud, pendulous in space.
Consciousness flooded me, in reality I was in the arms of one of
the man frogs, carrying me as though I were a babe, and we were
passing through some place suffused with glow enough like heart
of pearl or dawn cloud to justify my awakening vagaries.</p>

<p>Just ahead walked Lakla in earnest talk with Rador, and
content enough was I for a time to watch her. She had thrown off
the metallic robes; her thick braids of golden brown hair with
their flame glints of bronze were twined in a high coronal meshed
in silken net of green; little clustering curls escaped from it,
clinging to the nape of the proud white neck, shyly kissing it.
From her shoulders fell a loose, sleeveless garment of shimmering
green belted with a high golden girdle; skirt folds dropping
barely below the knees.</p>

<p>She had cast aside her buskins, too, and the slender,
high-arched feet were sandaled. Between the buckled edges of her
kirtle I caught gleams of translucent ivory as exquisitely
moulded, as delectably rounded, as those revealed so naively
beneath the hem.</p>

<p>Something was knocking at the doors of my
consciousness&mdash;some tragic thing. What was it? Larry! Where
was Larry? I remembered; raised my head abruptly; saw at my side
another frog-man carrying O'Keefe, and behind him, Olaf, step
instinct with grief, following like some faithful, wistful dog
who has lost a loved master. Upon my movement the monster bearing
me halted, looked down inquiringly, uttered a deep, booming note
that held the quality of interrogation.</p>

<p>Lakla turned; the clear, golden eyes were sorrowful, the sweet
mouth drooping; but her loveliness, her gentleness, that
undefinable synthesis of all her tender self that seemed always
to circle her with an atmosphere of lucid normality, lulled my
panic.</p>

<p>"Drink this," she commanded, holding a small vial to my
lips.</p>

<p>Its contents were aromatic, unfamiliar but astonishingly
effective, for as soon as they passed my lips I felt a surge of
strength; consciousness was restored.</p>

<p>"Larry!" I cried. "Is he dead?"</p>

<p>Lakla shook her head; her eyes were troubled.</p>

<p>"No," she said; "but he is like one dead&mdash;and yet
unlike&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Put me down," I demanded of my bearer.</p>

<p>He tightened his hold; round eyes upon the Golden Girl. She
spoke&mdash; in sonorous, reverberating monosyllables&mdash;and I
was set upon my feet; I leaped to the side of the Irishman. He
lay limp, with a disquieting, abnormal sequacity, as though every
muscle were utterly flaccid; the antithesis of the <i>rigor
mortis</i>, thank God, but terrifyingly toward the other end of
its arc; a syncope I had never known. The flesh was stone cold;
the pulse barely perceptible, long intervaled; the respiration
undiscoverable; the pupils of the eyes were enormously dilated;
it was as though life had been drawn from every nerve.</p>

<p>"A light flashed from the road. It struck his face and seemed
to sink in," I said.</p>

<p>"I saw," answered Rador; "but what it was I know not; and I
thought I knew all the weapons of our rulers." He glanced at me
curiously. "Some talk there has been that the stranger who came
with you, Double Tongue, was making new death tools for Lugur,"
he ended.</p>

<p>Marakinoff! The Russian at work already in this storehouse of
devastating energies, fashioning the weapons for his plots! The
Apocalyptic vision swept back upon me&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is not dead." Lakla's voice was poignant. "He is not dead;
and the Three have wondrous healing. They can restore him if they
will&mdash;and they will, they <i>will</i>!" For a moment she was
silent. "Now their gods help Lugur and Yolara," she whispered;
"for come what may, whether the Silent Ones be strong or weak, if
he dies, surely shall I fall upon them and I will slay those
two&mdash;yea, though I, too perish!"</p>

<p>"Yolara and Lugur shall both die." Olaf's eyes were burning.
"But Lugur is mine to slay."</p>

<p>That pity I had seen before in Lakla's eyes when she looked
upon the Norseman banished the white wrath from them. She turned,
half hurriedly, as though to escape his gaze.</p>

<p>"Walk with us," she said to me, "unless you are still
weak."</p>

<p>I shook my head, gave a last look at O'Keefe; there was
nothing I could do; I stepped beside her. She thrust a white arm
into mine protectingly, the wonderfully moulded hand with its
long, tapering fingers catching about my wrist; my heart glowed
toward her.</p>

<p>"Your medicine is potent, handmaiden," I answered. "And the
touch of your hand would give me strength enough, even had I not
drunk it," I added in Larry's best manner.</p>

<p>Her eyes danced, trouble flying.</p>

<p>"Now, that was well spoken for such a man of wisdom as Rador
tells me you are," she laughed; and a little pang shot through
me. Could not a lover of science present a compliment without it
always seeming to be as unusual as plucking a damask rose from a
cabinet of fossils?</p>

<p>Mustering my philosophy, I smiled back at her. Again I noted
that broad, classic brow, with the little tendrils of shining
bronze caressing it, the tilted, delicate, nut-brown brows that
gave a curious touch of innocent <i>diablerie</i> to the lovely
face&mdash;flowerlike, pure, high-bred, a touch of roguishness,
subtly alluring, sparkling over the maiden Madonnaness that lay
ever like a delicate, luminous suggestion beneath it; the long,
black, curling lashes&mdash;the tender, rounded, bare left breast
&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have always liked you," she murmured naively, "since first
I saw you in that place where the Shining One goes forth into
your world. And I am glad you like my medicine as well as that
you carry in the black box that you left behind," she added
swiftly.</p>

<p>"How know you of that, Lakla?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Oft and oft I came to him there, and to you, while you lay
sleeping. How call you <i>him</i>?" She paused.</p>

<p>"Larry!" I said.</p>

<p>"Larry!" she repeated it excellently. "And you?"</p>

<p>"Goodwin," said Rador.</p>

<p>I bowed quite as though I were being introduced to some
charming young lady met in that old life now seemingly aeons
removed.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;Goodwin." she said. "Oft and oft I came. Sometimes
I thought you saw me. And <i>he</i>&mdash;did he not dream of me
sometime&mdash;?" she asked wistfully.</p>

<p>"He did." I said, "and watched for you." Then amazement grew
vocal. "But how came you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"By a strange road," she whispered, "to see that all was well
with <i>him</i>&mdash;and to look into his heart; for I feared
Yolara and her beauty. But I saw that she was not in his heart."
A blush burned over her, turning even the little bare breast
rosy. "It is a strange road," she went on hurriedly. "Many times
have I followed it and watched the Shining One bear back its prey
to the blue pool; seen the woman <i>he</i> seeks"&mdash;she made
a quick gesture toward Olaf&mdash;"and a babe cast from her arms
in the last pang of her mother love; seen another woman throw
herself into the Shining One's embrace to save a man she loved;
and I could not help!" Her voice grew deep, thrilled. "The
friend, it comes to me, who drew you here, Goodwin!"</p>

<p>She was silent, walking as one who sees visions and listens to
voices unheard by others, Rador made a warning gesture; I crowded
back my questions, glanced about me. We were passing over a
smooth strand, hard packed as some beach of long-thrust-back
ocean. It was like crushed garnets, each grain stained deep red,
faintly sparkling. On each side were distances, the floor
stretching away into them bare of vegetation&mdash;stretching on
and on into infinitudes of rosy mist, even as did the space
above.</p>

<p>Flanking and behind us marched the giant batrachians,
five-score of them at least, black scale and crimson scale
lustrous and gleaming in the rosaceous radiance; saucer eyes
shining circles of phosphorescence green, purple, red; spurs
clicking as they crouched along with a gait at once grotesque and
formidable.</p>

<p>Ahead the mist deepened into a ruddier glow; through it a
long, dark line began to appear&mdash;the mouth I thought of the
caverned space through which we were going; it was just before
us; over us&mdash;we stood bathed in a flood of rubescence!</p>

<p>A sea stretched before us&mdash;a crimson sea, gleaming like
that lost lacquer of royal coral and the Flame Dragon's blood
which Fu S'cze set upon the bower he built for his stolen sun
maiden&mdash;that going toward it she might think it the sun
itself rising over the summer seas. Unmoved by wave or ripple, it
was placid as some deep woodland pool when night rushes up over
the world.</p>

<p>It seemed molten&mdash;or as though some hand great enough to
rock earth had distilled here from conflagrations of autumn
sunsets their flaming essences.</p>

<p>A fish broke through, large as a shark, blunt-headed, flashing
bronze, ridged and mailed as though with serrate plates of
armour. It leaped high, shaking from it a sparkling spray of
rubies; dropped and shot up a geyser of fiery gems.</p>

<p>Across my line of vision, moving stately over the sea, floated
a half-globe, luminous, diaphanous, its iridescence melting into
turquoise, thence to amethyst, to orange, to scarlet shot with
rose, to vermilion, a translucent green, thence back into the
iridescence; behind it four others, and the least of them ten
feet in diameter, and the largest no less than thirty. They
drifted past like bubbles blown from froth of rainbows by pipes
in mouths of Titans' young. Then from the base of one arose a
tangle of shimmering strands, long, slender whiplashes that
played about and sank slowly again beneath the crimson
surface.</p>

<p>I gasped&mdash;for the fish had been a
<i>ganoid</i>&mdash;that ancient, armored form that was perhaps
the most intelligent of all life on our planet during the
Devonian era, but which for age upon age had vanished, save for
its fossils held in the embrace of the stone that once was their
soft bottom beds; and the half-globes were <i>Medusae</i>,
jelly-fish&mdash; but of a size, luminosity, and color unheard
of.</p>

<p>Now Lakla cupped her mouth with pink palms and sent a clarion
note ringing out. The ledge on which we stood continued a few
hundred feet before us, falling abruptly, though from no great
height to the Crimson Sea; at right and left it extended in a
long semicircle. Turning to the right whence she had sent her
call, I saw rising a mile or more away, veiled lightly by the
haze, a rainbow, a gigantic prismatic arch, flattened, I thought,
by some quality of the strange atmosphere. It sprang from the
ruddy strand, leaped the crimson tide, and dropped three miles
away upon a precipitous, jagged upthrust of rock frowning black
from the lacquered depths.</p>

<p>And surmounting a higher ledge beyond this upthrust a huge
dome of dull gold, Cyclopean, striking eyes and mind with
something unhumanly alien, baffling; sending the mind groping, as
though across the deserts of space, from some far-flung star,
should fall upon us linked sounds, coherent certainly, meaningful
surely, vaguely familiar&mdash;yet never to be translated into
any symbol or thought of our own particular planet.</p>

<p>The sea of crimson lacquer, with its floating moons of
luminous color &mdash;this bow of prismed stone leaping to the
weird isle crowned by the anomalous, aureate
excrescence&mdash;the half human batrachians&mdash;the elfland
through which we had passed, with all its hidden wonders and
terrors &mdash;I felt the foundations of my cherished knowledge
shaking. Was this all a dream? Was this body of mine lying
somewhere, fighting a fevered death, and all these but images
floating through the breaking chambers of my brain? My knees
shook; involuntarily I groaned.</p>

<p>Lakla turned, looked at me anxiously, slipped a soft arm
behind me, held me till the vertigo passed.</p>

<p>"Patience," she said. "The bearers come. Soon you shall
rest."</p>

<p>I looked; down toward us from the bow's end were leaping
swiftly another score of the frog-men. Some bore litters, high,
handled, not unlike palanquins&mdash;</p>

<p>"Asgard!" Olaf stood beside me, eyes burning, pointing to the
arch. "Bifröst Bridge, sharp as sword edge, over which souls go
to Valhalla. And <i>she</i>&mdash;she is a
<i>valkyrje</i>&mdash;a sword maiden, <i>Ja!</i>"</p>

<p>I gripped the Norseman's hand. It was hot, and a pang of
remorse shot through me. If this place had so shaken me, how must
it have shaken Olaf? It was with relief that I watched him, at
Lakla's gentle command, drop into one of the litters and lie
back, eyes closed, as two of the monsters raised its yoke to
their scaled shoulders. Nor was it without further relief that I
myself lay back on the soft velvety cushions of another.</p>

<p>The cavalcade began to move. Lakla had ordered O'Keefe placed
beside her, and she sat, knees crossed Orient fashion, leaning
over the pale head on her lap, the white, tapering fingers
straying fondly through his hair.</p>

<p>Presently I saw her reach up, slowly unwind the coronal of her
tresses, shake them loose, and let them fall like a veil over her
and him.</p>

<p>Her head bent low; I heard a soft sobbing&mdash;I turned away
my gaze, lorn enough in my own heart, God knew!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a>25. &mdash; THE THREE SILENT
ONES</h2>

<p class="first">The arch was closer&mdash;and in my awe I forgot
for the moment Larry and aught else. For this was no rainbow, no
thing born of light and mist, no Bifröst Bridge of myth&mdash;no!
It was a flying arch of stone, stained with flares of Tyrian
purples, of royal scarlets, of blues dark as the Gulf Stream's
ribbon, sapphires soft as midday May skies, splashes of chromes
and greens&mdash;a palette of giantry, a bridge of wizardry; a
hundred, nay, a thousand, times greater than that of Utah which
the Navaho call Nonnegozche and worship, as well they may, as a
god, and which is itself a rainbow in eternal rock.</p>

<p>It sprang from the ledge and winged its prodigious length in
one low arc over the sea's crimson breast, as though in some
ancient paroxysm of earth it had been hurled molten,
crystallizing into that stupendous span and still flaming with
the fires that had moulded it.</p>

<p>Closer we came and closer, while I watched spellbound; now we
were at its head, and the litter-bearers swept upon it. All of
five hundred feet wide it was, surface smooth as a city road,
sides low walled, curving inward as though in the jetting-out of
its making the edges of the plastic rock had curled.</p>

<p>On and on we sped; the high thrusting precipices upon which
the bridge's far end rested, frowned close; the enigmatic, dully
shining dome loomed ever greater. Now we had reached that end;
were passing over a smooth plaza whose level floor was enclosed,
save for a rift in front of us, by the fanged tops of the black
cliffs.</p>

<p>From this rift stretched another span, half a mile long,
perhaps, widening at its center into a broad platform, continuing
straight to two massive gates set within the face of the second
cliff wall like panels, and of the same dull gold as the dome
rising high beyond. And this smaller arch leaped a pit, an abyss,
of which the outer precipices were the rim holding back from the
pit the red flood.</p>

<p>We were rapidly approaching; now upon the platform; my bearers
were striding closely along the side; I leaned far out&mdash;a
giddiness seized me! I gazed down into depth upon vertiginous
depth; an abyss indeed&mdash; an abyss dropping to world's base
like that in which the Babylonians believed writhed Talaat, the
serpent mother of Chaos; a pit that struck down into earth's
heart itself,</p>

<p>Now, what was that&mdash;distance upon unfathomable distance
below? A stupendous glowing like the green fire of life itself.
What was it like? I had it! It was like the corona of the sun in
eclipse&mdash;that burgeoning that makes of our luminary when
moon veils it an incredible blossoming of splendors in the black
heavens.</p>

<p>And strangely, strangely, it was like the Dweller's beauty
when with its dazzling spiralings and writhings it raced amid its
storm of crystal bell sounds!</p>

<p>The abyss was behind us; we had paused at the golden portals;
they swung inward. A wide corridor filled with soft light was
before us, and on its threshold stood&mdash;bizarre, yellow gems
gleaming, huge muzzle wide in what was evidently meant for a
smile of welcome&mdash;the woman frog of the Moon Pool wall.</p>

<p>Lakla raised her head; swept back the silken tent of her hair
and gazed at me with eyes misty from weeping. The frog-woman
crept to her side; gazed down upon Larry;
spoke&mdash;<i>spoke</i>&mdash;to the Golden Girl in a swift
stream of the sonorous, reverberant monosyllables; and Lakla
answered her in kind. The webbed digits swept over O'Keefe's
face, felt at his heart; she shook her head and moved ahead of us
up the passage.</p>

<p>Still borne in the litters we went on, winding, ascending
until at last they were set down in a great hall carpeted with
soft fragrant rushes and into which from high narrow slits
streamed the crimson light from without.</p>

<p>I jumped over to Larry, there had been no change in his
condition; still the terrifying limpness, the slow, infrequent
pulsation. Rador and Olaf &mdash;and the fever now seemed to be
gone from him&mdash;came and stood beside me, silent.</p>

<p>"I go to the Three," said Lakla. "Wait you here." She passed
through a curtaining; then as swiftly as she had gone she
returned through the hangings, tresses braided, a swathing of
golden gauze about her.</p>

<p>"Rador," she said, "bear you Larry&mdash;for into your heart
the Silent Ones would look. And fear nothing," she added at the
green dwarf's disconcerted, almost fearful start.</p>

<p>Rador bowed, was thrust aside by Olaf.</p>

<p>"No," said the Norseman; "I will carry him."</p>

<p>He lifted Larry like a child against his broad breast. The
dwarf glanced quickly at Lakla; she nodded.</p>

<p>"Come!" she commanded, and held aside the folds.</p>

<p>Of that journey I have few memories. I only know that we went
through corridor upon corridor; successions of vast halls and
chambers, some carpeted with the rushes, others with rugs into
which the feet sank as into deep, soft meadows; spaces illumined
by the rubrous light, and spaces in which softer lights held
sway.</p>

<p>We paused before a slab of the same crimson stone as that the
green dwarf had called the portal, and upon its polished surface
weaved the same unnameable symbols. The Golden Girl pressed upon
its side; it slipped softly back; a torrent of opalescence gushed
out of the opening&mdash;and as one in a dream I entered.</p>

<p>We were, I knew, just under the dome; but for the moment,
caught in the flood of radiance, I could see nothing. It was like
being held within a fire opal&mdash;so brilliant, so flashing,
was it. I closed my eyes, opened them; the lambency cascaded from
the vast curves of the globular walls; in front of me was a long,
narrow opening in them, through which, far away, I could see the
end of the wizards' bridge and the ledged mouth of the cavern
through which we had come; against the light from within beat the
crimson light from without&mdash;and was checked as though by a
barrier.</p>

<p>I felt Lakla's touch; turned.</p>

<p>A hundred paces away was a dais, its rim raised a yard above
the floor. From the edge of this rim streamed upward a steady,
coruscating mist of the opalescence, veined even as was that of
the Dweller's shining core and shot with milky shadows like
curdled moonlight; up it stretched like a wall.</p>

<p>Over it, from it, down upon me, gazed three faces&mdash;two
clearly male, one a woman's. At the first I thought them statues,
and then the eyes of them gave the lie to me; for the eyes were
alive, terribly, and if I could admit the
word&mdash;<i>supernaturally</i>&mdash;alive.</p>

<p>They were thrice the size of the human eye and triangular, the
apex of the angle upward; black as jet, pupilless, filled with
tiny, leaping red flames.</p>

<p>Over them were foreheads, not as ours&mdash;high and broad and
visored; their sides drawn forward into a vertical ridge, a
prominence, an upright wedge, somewhat like the visored heads of
a few of the great lizards&mdash; and the heads, long, narrowing
at the back, were fully twice the size of mankind's!</p>

<p>Upon the brows were caps&mdash;and with a fearful certainty I
knew that they were <i>not</i> caps&mdash;long, thick strands of
gleaming yellow, feathered scales thin as sequins! Sharp, curving
noses like the beaks of the giant condors; mouths thin, austere;
long, powerful, pointed chins; the &mdash;<i>flesh</i>&mdash;of
the faces white as the whitest marble; and wreathing up to them,
covering all their bodies, the shimmering, curdled, misty fires
of opalescence!</p>

<p>Olaf stood rigid; my own heart leaped wildly. What&mdash;what
were these beings?</p>

<p>I forced myself to look again&mdash;and from their gaze
streamed a current of reassurance, of good will&mdash;nay, of
intense spiritual strength. I saw that they were not fierce, not
ruthless, not inhuman, despite their strangeness; no, they were
kindly; in some unmistakable way, benign and sorrowful&mdash;so
sorrowful! I straightened, gazed back at them fearlessly. Olaf
drew a deep breath, gazed steadily too, the hardness, the despair
wiped from his face.</p>

<p>Now Lakla drew closer to the dais; the three pairs of eyes
searched hers, the woman's with an ineffable tenderness; some
message seemed to pass between the Three and the Golden Girl. She
bowed low, turned to the Norseman.</p>

<p>"Place Larry there," she said softly&mdash;"there at the feet
of the Silent Ones."</p>

<p>She pointed into the radiant mist; Olaf started, hesitated,
stared from Lakla to the Three, searched for a moment their
eyes&mdash;and something like a smile drifted through them. He
stepped forward, lifted O'Keefe, set him squarely within the
covering light. It wavered, rolled upward, swirled about the
body, steadied again&mdash;and within it there was no sign of
Larry!</p>

<p>Again the mist wavered, shook, and seemed to climb higher,
hiding the chins, the beaked noses, the brows of that incredible
Trinity&mdash;but before it ceased to climb, I thought the yellow
feathered heads bent; sensed a movement as though they lifted
something.</p>

<p>The mist fell; the eyes gleamed out again, inscrutable.</p>

<p>And groping out of the radiance, pausing at the verge of the
dais, leaping down from it, came Larry, laughing, filled with
life, blinking as one who draws from darkness into sunshine. He
saw Lakla, sprang to her, gripped her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Lakla!" he cried, <a title="Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>"mavourneen!"</i></a> She slipped from his embrace,
blushing, glancing at the Three shyly, half-fearfully. And again
I saw the tenderness creep into the inky, flame-shot orbs of the
woman being; and a tenderness in the others too &mdash;as though
they regarded some well-beloved child.</p>

<p>"You lay in the arms of Death, Larry," she said. "And the
Silent Ones drew you from him. Do homage to the Silent Ones,
Larry, for they are good and they are mighty!"</p>

<p>She turned his head with one of the long, white
hands&mdash;and he looked into the faces of the Three; looked
long, was shaken even as had been Olaf and myself; was swept by
that same wave of power and of&mdash;of &mdash;what can I call
it?&mdash;<i>holiness</i> that streamed from them.</p>

<p>Then for the first time I saw real awe mount into his face.
Another moment he stared&mdash;and dropped upon one knee and
bowed his head before them as would a worshiper before the shrine
of his saint. And&mdash;I am not ashamed to tell it&mdash;I
joined him; and with us knelt Lakla and Olaf and Rador.</p>

<p>The mist of fiery opal swirled up about the Three; hid
them.</p>

<p>And with a long, deep, joyous sigh Lakla took Larry's hand,
drew him to his feet, and silently we followed them out of that
hall of wonder.</p>

<p>But why, in going, did the thought come to me that from where
the Three sat throned they ever watched the cavern mouth that was
the door into their abode; and looked down ever into the
unfathomable depth in which glowed and pulsed that mystic flower,
colossal, awesome, of green flame that had seemed to me fire of
life itself?</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26"></a>26. &mdash; THE WOOING OF
LAKLA</h2>

<p class="first">I had slept soundly and dreamlessly; I wakened
quietly in the great chamber into which Rador had ushered O'Keefe
and myself after that culminating experience of crowded,
nerve-racking hours&mdash;the facing of the Three.</p>

<p>Now, lying gazing upward at the high-vaulted ceiling, I heard
Larry's voice:</p>

<p>"They look like birds." Evidently he was thinking of the
Three; a silence &mdash;then: "Yes, they look like
<i>birds</i>&mdash;and they look, and it's meaning no disrespect
to them I am at all, they look like <i>lizards</i>"&mdash;and
another silence&mdash;"they look like some sort of gods, and, by
the good sword-arm of <a title= "Irish king (1002-1014) who spent
most of his life fighting the Danes and the Norse. He was killed
after the final defeat of a Danish coalition, which ended Norse
power in Ireland."> Brian Boru</a>, they look human, too! And
it's <i>none</i> of them they are either, so what&mdash;what
the&mdash;what the sainted St. Bridget are they?" Another short
silence, and then in a tone of awed and absolute conviction:
"That's it, sure! That's what they are&mdash;it all hangs in
&mdash;they couldn't be anything else&mdash;"</p>

<p>He gave a whoop; a pillow shot over and caught me across the
head.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" shouted Larry. "Wake up, ye seething cauldron of
fossilized superstitions! Wake up, ye bogy-haunted man of
scientific unwisdom!"</p>

<p>Under pillow and insults I bounced to my feet, filled for a
moment with quite real wrath; he lay back, roaring with laughter,
and my anger was swept away.</p>

<p>"Doc," he said, very seriously, after this, "I know who the
Three are!"</p>

<p>"Yes?" I queried, with studied sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he mimicked. "Yes! Ye&mdash;ye" He paused under the
menace of my look, grinned. "Yes, I know," he continued. "They're
of the Tuatha De, the old ones, the great people of Ireland,
<i>that's</i> who they are!"</p>

<p>I knew, of course, of the Tuatha De Danann, the tribes of the
god Danu, the half-legendary, half-historical clan who found
their home in Erin some four thousand years before the Christian
era, and who have left so deep an impress upon the Celtic mind
and its myths.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Larry again, "the Tuatha De&mdash;the Ancient Ones
who had spells that could compel Mananan, who is the spirit of
all the seas, an' Keithor, who is the god of all green living
things, an' even Hesus, the unseen god, whose pulse is the pulse
of all the firmament; yes, an' Orchil too, who sits within the
earth an' weaves with the shuttle of mystery and her three looms
of birth an' life an' death&mdash;even Orchil would weave as they
commanded!"</p>

<p>He was silent&mdash;then:</p>

<p>"They are of them&mdash;the mighty ones&mdash;why else would I
have bent my knee to them as I would have to the spirit of my
dead mother? Why else would Lakla, whose gold-brown hair is the
hair of Eilidh the Fair, whose mouth is the sweet mouth of
Deirdre, an' whose soul walked with mine ages agone among the
fragrant green myrtle of Erin, serve them?" he whispered, eyes
full of dream.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how they got here?" I asked, not
unreasonably.</p>

<p>"I haven't thought about that," he replied somewhat testily.
"But at once, me excellent man o' wisdom, a number occur to me.
One of them is that this little party of three might have stopped
here on their way to Ireland, an' for good reasons of their own
decided to stay a while; an' another is that they might have come
here afterward, havin' got wind of what those rats out there were
contemplatin', and have stayed on the job till the time was ripe
to save Ireland from 'em; the rest of the world, too, of course,"
he added magnanimously, "but Ireland in particular. And do any of
those reasons appeal to ye?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think?" he asked wearily.</p>

<p>"I think," I said cautiously, "that we face an evolution of
highly intelligent beings from ancestral sources radically
removed from those through which mankind ascended. These
half-human, highly developed batrachians they call the <i>Akka</i>
prove that evolution in these caverned spaces has certainly
pursued one different path than on earth. The Englishman, Wells,
wrote an imaginative and very entertaining book concerning an
invasion of earth by Martians, and he made his Martians
enormously specialized cuttlefish. There was nothing inherently
improbable in Wells' choice. Man is the ruling animal of earth
today solely by reason of a series of accidents; under another
series spiders or ants, or even elephants, could have become the
dominant race.</p>

<p>"I think," I said, even more cautiously, "that the race to
which the Three belong never appeared on earth's surface; that
their development took place here, unhindered through aeons. And
if this be true, the structure of their brains, and therefore all
their reactions, must be different from ours. Hence their
knowledge and command of energies unfamiliar to us&mdash;and
hence also the question whether they may not have an entirely
different sense of values, of justice&mdash;and that is rather
terrifying," I concluded.</p>

<p>Larry shook his head.</p>

<p>"That last sort of knocks your argument, Doc," he said. "They
had sense of justice enough to help <i>me</i> out&mdash;and
certainly they know love &mdash;for I saw the way they looked at
Lakla; and sorrow&mdash;for there was no mistaking that in their
faces.</p>

<p>"No," he went on. "I hold to my own idea. They're of the Old
People. The little <a title= "an elf in Irish folklore who can
reveal hidden treasure to those who catch them">
<i>leprechaun</i></a> knew his way here, an' I'll bet it was they
who sent the word. An' if the O'Keefe <a title= "a female spirit
in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing, a death in a
family"> <i>banshee</i></a> comes here&mdash;which save the
mark!&mdash;I'll bet she'll drop in on the Silent Ones for a
social visit before she an' her clan get busy. Well, it'll make
her feel more at home, the good old body. No, Doc, no," he
concluded, "I'm right; it all fits in too well to be wrong."</p>

<p>I made a last despairing attempt.</p>

<p>"Is there anything anywhere in Ireland that would indicate
that the Tuatha De ever looked like the Three?" I asked&mdash;and
again I had spoken most unfortunately.</p>

<p>"Is there?" he shouted. "Is there? By the kilt of Cormack
MacCormack, I'm glad ye reminded me. It was worryin' me a little
meself. There was Daghda, who could put on the head of a great
boar an' the body of a giant fish and cleave the waves an' tear
to pieces the <i>birlins</i>* of any who came against Erin; an'
there was Rinn&mdash;"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>birlins</i>&mdash;boats. ]</p>

<p>How many more of the metamorphoses of the Old People I might
have heard, I do not know, for the curtains parted and in walked
Rador.</p>

<p>"You have rested well," he smiled, "I can see. The handmaiden
bade me call you. You are to eat with her in her garden."</p>

<p>Down long corridors we trod and out upon a gardened terrace as
beautiful as any of those of Yolara's city; bowered, blossoming,
fragrant, set high upon the cliffs beside the domed castle. A
table, as of milky jade, was spread at one corner, but the Golden
Girl was not there. A little path ran on and up, hemmed in by the
mass of verdure. I looked at it longingly; Rador saw the glance,
interpreted it, and led me up the stepped sharp slope into a rock
embrasure.</p>

<p>Here I was above the foliage, and everywhere the view was
clear. Below me stretched the incredible bridge, with the frog
people hurrying back and forth upon it. A pinnacle at my side hid
the abyss. My eyes followed the cavern ledge. Above it the rock
rose bare, but at the ends of the semicircular strand a luxuriant
vegetation began, stretching from the crimson shores back into
far distances. Of browns and reds and yellows, like an autumn
forest, was the foliage, with here and there patches of
dark-green, as of conifers. Five miles or more, on each side, the
forests swept, and then were lost to sight in the haze.</p>

<p>I turned and faced an immensity of crimson waters, unbroken, a
true sea, if ever there was one. A breeze blew&mdash;the first
real wind I had encountered in the hidden places; under it the
surface, that had been as molten lacquer, rippled and dimpled.
Little waves broke with a spray of rose-pearls and rubies. The
giant Medusae drifted&mdash;stately, luminous kaleidoscopic elfin
moons.</p>

<p>Far down, peeping around a jutting tower of the cliff, I saw
dipping with the motion of the waves a floating garden. The
flowers, too, were luminous &mdash;indeed
sparkling&mdash;gleaming brilliants of scarlet and vermilion
lighter than the flood on which they lay, mauves and odd shades
of reddish-blue. They gleamed and shone like a little lake of
jewels.</p>

<p>Rador broke in upon my musings.</p>

<p>"Lakla comes! Let us go down."</p>

<p>It was a shy Lakla who came slowly around the end of the path
and, blushing furiously, held her hands out to Larry. And the
Irishman took them, placed them over his heart, kissed them with
a tenderness that had been lacking in the half-mocking,
half-fierce caresses he had given the priestess. She blushed
deeper, holding out the tapering fingers&mdash;then pressed them
to her own heart.</p>

<p>"I like the touch of your lips, Larry," she whispered. "They
warm me here" &mdash;she pressed her heart again&mdash;"and they
send little sparkles of light through me." Her brows tilted
perplexedly, accenting the nuance of diablerie, delicate and
fascinating, that they cast upon the flower face.</p>

<p>"Do you?" whispered the O'Keefe fervently. "Do you, Lakla?" He
bent toward her. She caught the amused glance of Rador; drew
herself aside half-haughtily.</p>

<p>"Rador," she said, "is it not time that you and the strong
one, Olaf, were setting forth?"</p>

<p>"Truly it is, handmaiden," he answered respectfully
enough&mdash;yet with a current of laughter under his words. "But
as you know the strong one, Olaf, wished to see his friends here
before we were gone&mdash;and he comes even now," he added,
glancing down the pathway, along which came striding the
Norseman.</p>

<p>As he faced us I saw that a transformation had been wrought in
him. Gone was the pitiful seeking, and gone too the just as
pitiful hope. The set face softened as he looked at the Golden
Girl and bowed low to her. He thrust a hand to O'Keefe and to
me.</p>

<p>"There is to be battle," he said. "I go with Rador to call the
armies of these frog people. As for me&mdash;Lakla has spoken.
There is no hope for &mdash;for <i>mine</i> Helma in life, but
there is hope that we destroy the Shining Devil and give
<i>mine</i> Helma peace. And with that I am well content,
<i>ja!</i> Well content!" He gripped our hands again. "We will
fight!" he muttered. "<i>Ja!</i> And I will have vengeance!" The
sternness returned; and with a salute Rador and he were gone.</p>

<p>Two great tears rolled from the golden eyes of Lakla.</p>

<p>"Not even the Silent Ones can heal those the Shining One has
taken," she said. "He asked me&mdash;and it was better that I
tell him. It is part of the
Three's&mdash;<i>punishment</i>&mdash;but of that you will soon
learn," she went on hurriedly. "Ask me no questions now of the
Silent Ones. I thought it better for Olaf to go with Rador, to
busy himself, to give his mind other than sorrow upon which to
feed."</p>

<p>Up the path came five of the frog-women, bearing platters and
ewers. Their bracelets and anklets of jewels were tinkling; their
middles covered with short kirtles of woven cloth studded with
the sparkling ornaments.</p>

<p>And here let me say that if I have given the impression that
the <i>Akka</i> are simply magnified frogs, I regret it. Frog-like
they are, and hence my phrase for them&mdash;but as unlike
the frog, as we know it, as man is unlike the chimpanzee.
Springing, I hazard, from the stegocephalia, the ancestor of the
frogs, these batrachians followed a different line of evolution
and acquired the upright position just as man did his from the
four-footed folk.</p>

<p>The great staring eyes, the shape of the muzzle were frog-like,
but the highly developed brain had set upon the head and
shape of it vital differences. The forehead, for instance, was
not low, flat, and retreating &mdash;its frontal arch was well
defined. The head was, in a sense, shapely, and with the females
the great horny carapace that stood over it like a fantastic
helmet was much modified, as were the spurs that were so
formidable in the male; coloration was different also. The torso
was upright; the legs a little bent, giving them their crouching
gait&mdash;but I wander from my subject.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *The <i>Akka</i> are viviparous. The female
produces progeny at five-year intervals, never more than two at a
time. They are monogamous, like certain of our own
<i>Ranidae</i>. Pending my monograph upon what little I had time

<p>They set their burdens down. Larry looked at them with
interest.</p>

<p>"You surely have those things well trained, Lakla," he
said.</p>

<p>"Things!" The handmaiden arose, eyes flashing with
indignation. "You call my <i>Akka</i> things!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Larry, a bit taken aback, "what do you call
them?"</p>

<p>"My <i>Akka</i> are a <i>people</i>," she retorted. "As much a
people as your race or mine. They are good and loyal, and they
have speech and arts, and they slay not, save for food or to
protect themselves. And I think them beautiful, Larry,
<i>beautiful</i>!" She stamped her foot. "And you call them
&mdash;<i>things</i>!"</p>

<p>Beautiful! These? Yet, after all, they were, in their
grotesque fashion. And to Lakla, surrounded by them, from
babyhood, they were not strange, at all. Why shouldn't she think
them beautiful? The same thought must have struck O'Keefe, for he
flushed guiltily.</p>

<p>"I think them beautiful, too, Lakla," he said remorsefully.
"It's my not knowing your tongue too well that traps me.
<i>Truly</i>, I think them beautiful&mdash;I'd tell them so, if I
knew their talk."</p>

<p>Lakla dimpled, laughed&mdash;spoke to the attendants in that
strange speech that was unquestionably a language; they bridled,
looked at O'Keefe with fantastic coquetry, cracked and boomed
softly among themselves.</p>

<p>"They say they like <i>you</i> better than the men of Muria,"
laughed Lakla.</p>

<p>"Did I ever think I'd be swapping compliments with lady
frogs!" he murmured to me. "Buck up, Larry&mdash;keep your eyes
on the captive Irish princess!" he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>"Rador goes to meet one of the <i>ladala</i> who is slipping
through with news," said the Golden Girl as we addressed
ourselves to the food. "Then, with Nak, he and Olaf go to muster
the <i>Akka</i>&mdash;for there will be battle, and we must
prepare. Nak," she added, "is he who went before me when you were
dancing with Yolara, Larry." She stole a swift, mischievous
glance at him. "He is headman of all the <i>Akka</i>."</p>

<p>"Just what forces can we muster against them when they come,
darlin'?" said Larry.</p>

<p>"Darlin'?"&mdash;the Golden Girl had caught the caress of the
word &mdash;"what's that?"</p>

<p>"It's a little word that means Lakla," he answered. "It
does&mdash;that is, when I say it; when you say it, then it means
Larry."</p>

<p>"I like that word," mused Lakla.</p>

<p>"You can even say Larry darlin'!" suggested O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"Larry darlin'!" said Lakla. "When they come we shall have
first of all my <i>Akka</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can they fight, <a title="Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>mavourneen?"</i></a> interrupted Larry.</p>

<p>"Can they fight! My <i>Akka</i>!" Again her eyes flashed.
"They will fight to the last of them&mdash;with the spears that
give the swift rotting, covered, as they are, with the jelly of
those <i>Saddu</i> there&mdash;" She pointed through a rift in
the foliage across which, on the surface of the sea, was floating
one of the moon globes&mdash;and now I know why Rador had warned
Larry against a plunge there. "With spears and clubs and with
teeth and nails and spurs&mdash;they are a strong and brave
people, Larry&mdash; darlin', and though they hurl the
<i>Keth</i> at them, it is slow to work upon them, and they slay
even while they are passing into the nothingness!"</p>

<p>"And have we none of the <i>Keth</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No"&mdash;she shook her head&mdash;"none of their weapons
have we here, although it was&mdash;it was the Ancient Ones who
shaped them."</p>

<p>"But the Three are of the Ancient Ones?" I cried. "Surely they
can tell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she said slowly. "No&mdash;there is something you must
know &mdash;and soon; and then the Silent Ones say you will
understand. You, especially, Goodwin, who worship wisdom."</p>

<p>"Then," said Larry, "we have the <i>Akka</i>; and we have the
four men of us, and among us three guns and about a hundred
cartridges&mdash;an' &mdash;an' the power of the Three&mdash;but
what about the Shining One, Fireworks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not know." Again the indecision that had been in her
eyes when Yolara had launched her defiance crept back. "The
Shining One is strong &mdash;and he has his&mdash;slaves!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'd better get busy good and quick!" the O'Keefe's
voice rang. But Lakla, for some reason of her own, would pursue
the matter no further. The trouble fled from her eyes&mdash;they
danced.</p>

<p>"Larry darlin'?" she murmured. "I like the touch of your
lips&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do?" he whispered, all thought flying of anything but the
beautiful, provocative face so close to his. "Then, <a title=
"Irish: sweetheart, darling"><i>acushla</i></a>, you're goin' to
get acquainted with 'em! Turn your head, Doc!" he said.</p>

<p>And I turned it. There was quite a long silence, broken by an
interested, soft outburst of gentle boomings from the serving
frog-maids. I stole a glance behind me. Lakla's head lay on the
Irishman's shoulder, the golden eyes misty sun-pools of love and
adoration; and the O'Keefe, a new look of power and strength upon
his clear-cut features, was gazing down into them with that look
which rises only from the heart touched for the first time with
that true, all-powerful love, which is the pulse of the universe
itself, the real music of the spheres of which Plato dreamed, the
love that is stronger than death itself, immortal as the high
gods and the true soul of all that mystery we call life.</p>

<p>Then Lakla raised her hands, pressed down Larry's head, kissed
him between the eyes, drew herself with a trembling little laugh
from his embrace.</p>

<p>"The future Mrs. Larry O'Keefe, Goodwin," said Larry to me a
little unsteadily.</p>

<p>I took their hands&mdash;and Lakla kissed me!</p>

<p>She turned to the booming&mdash;smiling&mdash;frog-maids; gave
them some command, for they filed away down the path. Suddenly I
felt, well, a little superfluous.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," I said, "I think I'll go up the path
there again and look about."</p>

<p>But they were so engrossed with each other that they did not
even hear me &mdash;so I walked away, up to the embrasure where
Rador had taken me. The movement of the batrachians over the
bridge had ceased. Dimly at the far end I could see the cluster
of the garrison. My thoughts flew back to Lakla and to Larry.</p>

<p>What was to be the end?</p>

<p>If we won, if we were able to pass from this place, could she
live in our world? A product of these caverns with their
atmosphere and light that seemed in some subtle way to be both
food and drink&mdash;how would she react to the unfamiliar foods
and air and light of outer earth? Further, here so far as I was
able to discover, there were no malignant bacilli&mdash;what
immunity could Lakla have then to those microscopic evils
without, which only long ages of sickness and death have bought
for us a modicum of protection? I began to be oppressed. Surely
they had been long enough by themselves. I went down the
path.</p>

<p>I heard Larry.</p>

<p>"It's a green land, <a title="Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>mavourneen</i></a>. And the sea rocks and dimples
around it&mdash;blue as the heavens, green as the isle itself,
and foam horses toss their white manes, and the great clean winds
blow over it, and the sun shines down on it like your eyes, <a
title= "Irish: sweetheart,
darling"><i>acushla</i></a>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And are you a king of Ireland, Larry darlin'?" Thus
Lakla&mdash;</p>

<p>But enough!</p>

<p>At last we turned to go&mdash;and around the corner of the
path I caught another glimpse of what I have called the lake of
jewels. I pointed to it.</p>

<p>"Those are lovely flowers, Lakla," I said. "I have never seen
anything like them in the place from whence we come."</p>

<p>She followed my pointing finger&mdash;laughed.</p>

<p>"Come," she said, "let me show you them."</p>

<p>She ran down an intersecting way, we following; came out of it
upon a little ledge close to the brink, three feet or more I
suppose about it. The Golden Girl's voice rang out in a
high-pitched, tremulous, throbbing call.</p>

<p>The lake of jewels stirred as though a breeze had passed over
it; stirred, shook, and then began to move swiftly, a shimmering
torrent of shining flowers down upon us! She called again, the
movement became more rapid; the gem blooms streamed
closer&mdash;closer, wavering, shifting, winding &mdash;at our
very feet. Above them hovered a little radiant mist. The Golden
Girl leaned over; called softly, and up from the sparkling mass
shot a green vine whose heads were five flowers of flaming
ruby&mdash;shot up, flew into her hand and coiled about the white
arm, its quintette of lambent blossoms&mdash;regarding us!</p>

<p>It was the thing Lakla had called the <i>Yekta</i>; that with
which she had threatened the priestess; the thing that carried
the dreadful death &mdash;and the Golden Girl was handling it
like a rose!</p>

<p>Larry swore&mdash;I looked at the thing more closely. It was a
hydroid, a development of that strange animal-vegetable that,
sometimes almost microscopic, waves in the sea depths like a
cluster of flowers paralyzing its prey with the mysterious force
that dwells in its blossom heads!*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *The <i>Yekta</i> of the Crimson Sea are as
extraordinary developments of hydroid forms as the giant
<i>Medusae</i>, of which, of course, they are not too remote
cousins. The closest resemblances to them in outer water forms
are among the <i>Gymnoblastic Hydroids</i>, notably <i>Clavetella
prolifera</i>, a most interesting ambulatory form of six
tentacles. Almost every bather in Southern waters, Northern too,
knows the pain that contact with certain "jelly fish" produces.
The <i>Yekta's</i> development was prodigious and, to us,
monstrous. It secretes in its five heads an almost incredibly
swiftly acting poison which I suspect, for I had no chance to
verify the theory, destroys the entire nervous system to the
accompaniment of truly infernal agony; carrying at the same time
the illusion that the torment stretches through infinities of
time. Both ether and nitrous oxide gas produce in the majority
this sensation of time extension, without of course the pain
symptom. What Lakla called the <i>Yekta</i> kiss is I imagine
about as close to the orthodox idea of Hell as can be conceived.
The secret of her control over them I had no opportunity of
learning in the rush of events that followed. Knowledge of the
appalling effects of their touch came, she told me, from those
few "who had been kissed so lightly" that they recovered.
Certainly nothing, not even the Shining One, was dreaded by the
Murians as these were&mdash;W.T.G. ]</p>

<p>"Put it down, Lakla," the distress in O'Keefe's voice was
deep. Lakla laughed mischievously, caught the real fear for her
in his eyes; opened her hand, gave another faint call&mdash;and
back it flew to its fellows.</p>

<p>"Why, it wouldn't hurt me, Larry!" she expostulated. "They
know me!"</p>

<p>"Put it down!" he repeated hoarsely.</p>

<p>She sighed, gave another sweet, prolonged call. The lake of
gems&mdash; rubies and amethysts, mauves and scarlet-tinged
blues&mdash;wavered and shook even as it had before&mdash;and
swept swiftly back to that place whence she had drawn them!</p>

<p>Then, with Larry and Lakla walking ahead, white arm about his
brown neck; the O'Keefe still expostulating, the handmaiden
laughing merrily, we passed through her bower to the domed
castle.</p>

<p>Glancing through a cleft I caught sight again of the far end
of the bridge; noted among the clustered figures of its garrison
of the frog-men a movement, a flashing of green fire like
marshlights on spear tips; wondered idly what it was, and then,
other thoughts crowding in, followed along, head bent, behind the
pair who had found in what was Olaf's hell, their true
paradise.</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap27" id="chap27"></a>27. &mdash; THE COMING OF
YOLARA</h2>

<p class="first">"Never was there such a girl!" Thus Larry,
dreamily, leaning head in hand on one of the wide divans of the
chamber where Lakla had left us, pleading service to the Silent
Ones.</p>

<p>"An', by the faith and the honor of the O'Keefes, an' by my
dead mother's soul may God do with me as I do by her!" he
whispered fervently.</p>

<p>He relapsed into open-eyed dreaming.</p>

<p>I walked about the room, examining it&mdash;the first
opportunity I had gained to inspect carefully any of the rooms in
the abode of the Three. It was octagonal, carpeted with the thick
rugs that seemed almost as though woven of soft mineral wool,
faintly shimmering, palest blue. I paced its diagonal; it was
fifty yards; the ceiling was arched, and either of pale rose
metal or metallic covering; it collected the light from the high,
slitted windows, and shed it, diffused, through the room.</p>

<p>Around the octagon ran a low gallery not two feet from the
floor, balustraded with slender pillars, close set; broken at
opposite curtained entrances over which hung thick, dull-gold
curtainings giving the same suggestion of metallic or mineral
substance as the rugs. Set within each of the eight sides, above
the balcony, were colossal slabs of lapis lazuli, inset with
graceful but unplaceable designs in scarlet and sapphire
blue.</p>

<p>There was the great divan on which mused Larry; two smaller
ones, half a dozen low seats and chairs carved apparently of
ivory and of dull soft gold.</p>

<p>Most curious were tripods, strong, pikelike legs of golden
metal four feet high, holding small circles of the lapis with
intaglios of one curious symbol somewhat resembling the
ideographs of the Chinese.</p>

<p>There was no dust&mdash;nowhere in these caverned spaces had I
found this constant companion of ours in the world overhead. My
eyes caught a sparkle from a corner. Pursuing it I found upon one
of the low seats a flat, clear crystal oval, remarkably like a
lens. I took it and stepped up on the balcony. Standing on tiptoe
I found I commanded from the bottom of a window slit a view of
the bridge approach. Scanning it I could see no trace of the
garrison there, nor of the green spear flashes. I placed the
crystal to my eyes&mdash;and with a disconcerting abruptness the
cavern mouth leaped before me, apparently not a hundred feet
away; decidedly the crystal was a very excellent lens&mdash;but
where were the guards?</p>

<p>I peered closely. Nothing! But now against the aperture I saw
a score or more of tiny, dancing sparks. An optical illusion, I
thought, and turned the crystal in another direction. There were
no sparklings there. I turned it back again&mdash;and there they
were. And what were they like? Realization came to me&mdash;they
were like the little, dancing, radiant atoms that had played for
a time about the emptiness where had stood Sorgar of the Lower
Waters before he had been shaken into the nothingness! And that
green light I had noticed&mdash;the <i>Keth</i>!</p>

<p>A cry on my lips, I turned to Larry&mdash;and the cry died as
the heavy curtainings at the entrance on my right undulated,
parted as though a body had slipped through, shook and parted
again and again&mdash;with the dreadful passing of unseen
things!</p>

<p>"Larry!" I cried. "Here! Quick!"</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet, gazed about wildly&mdash;and
disappeared! Yes &mdash;vanished from my sight like the snuffed
flame of a candle or as though something moving with the speed of
light itself had snatched him away!</p>

<p>Then from the divan came the sounds of struggle, the hissing
of straining breaths, the noise of Larry cursing. I leaped over
the balustrade, drawing my own pistol&mdash;was caught in a pair
of mighty arms, my elbows crushed to my sides, drawn down until
my face pressed close to a broad, hairy breast &mdash;and through
that obstacle&mdash;formless, shadowless, transparent as air
itself&mdash;I could still see the battle on the divan!</p>

<p>Now there were two sharp reports; the struggle abruptly
ceased. From a point not a foot over the great couch, as though
oozing from the air itself, blood began to drop, faster and ever
faster, pouring out of nothingness.</p>

<p>And out of that same air, now a dozen feet away, leaped the
face of Larry &mdash;bodyless, poised six feet above the floor,
blazing with rage&mdash; floating weirdly, uncannily to a hideous
degree, in vacancy.</p>

<p>His hands flashed out&mdash;armless; they wavered, appearing,
disappearing&mdash;swiftly tearing something from him. Then
there, feet hidden, stiff on legs that vanished at the ankles,
striking out into vision with all the dizzy abruptness with which
he had been stricken from sight was the O'Keefe, a smoking pistol
in hand.</p>

<p>And ever that red stream trickled out of vacancy and spread
over the couch, dripping to the floor.</p>

<p>I made a mighty movement to escape; was held more
firmly&mdash;and then close to the face of Larry, flashing out
with that terrifying instantaneousness even as had his, was the
head of Yolara, as devilishly mocking as I had ever seen it, the
cruelty shining through it like delicate white flames from
hell&mdash;and beautiful!</p>

<p>"Stir not! Strike not&mdash;until I command!" She flung the
words beyond her, addressed to the invisible ones who had
accompanied her; whose presences I sensed filling the chamber.
The floating, beautiful head, crowned high with corn-silk hair,
darted toward the Irishman. He took a swift step backward. The
eyes of the priestess deepened toward purple; sparkled with
malice.</p>

<p>"So," she said. "So, <i>Larree</i>&mdash;you thought you could
go from me so easily!" She laughed softly. "In my hidden hand I
hold the <i>Keth</i> cone," she murmured. "Before you can raise
the death tube I can smite you &mdash;and will. And consider,
<i>Larree</i>, if the handmaiden, the <i>choya</i>comes, I can
vanish&mdash;so"&mdash;the mocking head disappeared, burst forth
again&mdash;"and slay her with the <i>Keth</i> &mdash;or bid my
people seize her and bear her to the Shining One!"</p>

<p>Tiny beads of sweat stood out on O'Keefe's forehead, and I
knew he was thinking not of himself, but of Lakla.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me, Yolara?" he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Nay," came the mocking voice. "Not Yolara to you,
<i>Larree</i>&mdash; call me by those sweet names you taught
me&mdash;Honey of the Wild Bee-e-s, Net of Hearts&mdash;" Again
her laughter tinkled.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" his voice was strained, the lips
rigid.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are afraid, <i>Larree</i>." There was diabolic
jubilation in the words. "What should I want but that you return
with me? Why else did I creep through the lair of the dragon worm
and pass the path of perils but to ask you that? And the
<i>choya</i> guards you not well." Again she laughed. "We came to
the cavern's end and, there were her <i>Akka</i>. And the
<i>Akka</i> can see us&mdash;as shadows. But it was my desire to
surprise you with my coming, Larree," the voice was silken. "And
I feared that they would hasten to be first to bring you that
message to delight in your joy. And so, <i>Larree</i>, I loosed
the <i>Keth</i> upon them&mdash;and gave them peace and rest
within the nothingness. And the portal below was
open&mdash;almost in welcome!"</p>

<p>Once more the malignant, silver pealing of her laughter.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" There was wrath in his eyes, and
plainly he strove for control.</p>

<p>"Want!" the silver voice hissed, grew calm. "Do not Siya and
Siyana grieve that the rite I pledged them is but half
done&mdash;and do they not desire it finished? And am I not
beautiful? More beautiful than your <i>choya</i>?"</p>

<p>The fiendishness died from the eyes; they grew blue, wondrous;
the veil of invisibility slipped down from the neck, the
shoulders, half revealing the gleaming breasts. And weird, weird
beyond all telling was that exquisite head and bust floating
there in air&mdash;and beautiful, sinisterly beautiful beyond all
telling, too. So even might Lilith, the serpent woman, have shown
herself tempting Adam!</p>

<p>"And perhaps," she said, "perhaps I want you because I hate
you; perhaps because I love you&mdash;or perhaps for Lugur or
perhaps for the Shining One."</p>

<p>"And if I go with you?" He said it quietly.</p>

<p>"Then shall I spare the handmaiden&mdash;and&mdash;who
knows?&mdash; take back my armies that even now gather at the
portal and let the Silent Ones rot in peace in their
abode&mdash;from which they had no power to keep me," she added
venomously.</p>

<p>"You will swear that, Yolara; swear to go without harming the
handmaiden?" he asked eagerly. The little devils danced in her
eyes. I wrenched my face from the smothering contact.</p>

<p>"Don't trust her, Larry!" I cried&mdash;and again the grip
choked me.</p>

<p>"Is that devil in front of you or behind you, old man?" he
asked quietly, eyes never leaving the priestess. "If he's in
front I'll take a chance and wing him&mdash;and then you scoot
and warn Lakla."</p>

<p>But I could not answer; nor, remembering Yolara's threat,
would I, had I been able.</p>

<p>"Decide quickly!" There was cold threat in her voice.</p>

<p>The curtains toward which O'Keefe had slowly, step by step,
drawn close, opened. They framed the handmaiden! The face of
Yolara changed to that gorgon mask that had transformed it once
before at sight of the Golden Girl. In her blind rage she forgot
to cast the occulting veil. Her hand darted like a snake out of
the folds; poising itself with the little silver cone aimed at
Lakla.</p>

<p>But before it was wholly poised, before the priestess could
loose its force, the handmaiden was upon her. Swift as the lithe
white wolf hound she leaped, and one slender hand gripped
Yolara's throat, the other the wrist that lifted the quivering
death; white limbs wrapped about the hidden ones, I saw the
golden head bend, the hand that held the <i>Keth</i> swept up
with a vicious jerk; saw Lakla's teeth sink into the
wrist&mdash;the blood spurt forth and heard the priestess shriek.
The cone fell, bounded toward me; with all my strength I wrenched
free the hand that held my pistol, thrust it against the pressing
breast and fired.</p>

<p>The clasp upon me relaxed; a red rain stained me; at my feet a
little pillar of blood jetted; a hand thrust itself from
nothingness, clawed&mdash; and was still.</p>

<p>Now Yolara was down, Lakla meshed in her writhings and
fighting like some wild mother whose babes are serpent menaced.
Over the two of them, astride, stood the O'Keefe, a pike from one
of the high tripods in his hand&mdash; thrusting, parrying,
beating on every side as with a broadsword against
poniard-clutching hands that thrust themselves out of vacancy
striving to strike him; stepping here and there, always covering,
protecting Lakla with his own body even as a caveman of old who
does battle with his mate for their lives.</p>

<p>The sword-club struck&mdash;and on the floor lay the half body
of a dwarf, writhing with vanishments and reappearings of legs
and arms. Beside him was the shattered tripod from which Larry
had wrenched his weapon. I flung myself upon it, dashed it down
to break loose one of the remaining supports, struck in mid-fall
one of the unseen even as his dagger darted toward me! The seat
splintered, leaving in my clutch a golden bar. I jumped to
Larry's side, guarding his back, whirling it like a staff; felt
it crunch once&mdash;twice&mdash;through unseen bone and
muscle.</p>

<p>At the door was a booming. Into the chamber rushed a dozen of
the frog-men. While some guarded the entrances, others leaped
straight to us, and forming a circle about us began to strike
with talons and spurs at unseen things that screamed and sought
to escape. Now here and there about the blue rugs great stains of
blood appeared; heads of dwarfs, torn arms and gashed bodies,
half occulted, half revealed. And at last the priestess lay
silent, vanquished, white body gleaming with that
uncanny&mdash;fragmentariness &mdash;from her torn robes. Then
O'Keefe reached down, drew Lakla from her. Shakily, Yolara rose
to her feet. The handmaiden, face still blazing with wrath,
stepped before her; with difficulty she steadied her voice.</p>

<p>"Yolara," she said, "you have defied the Silent Ones, you have
desecrated their abode, you came to slay these men who are the
guests of the Silent Ones and me, who am their
handmaiden&mdash;why did you do these things?"</p>

<p>"I came for him!" gasped the priestess; she pointed to
O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lakla.</p>

<p>"Because he is pledged to me," replied Yolara, all the devils
that were hers in her face. "Because he wooed me! Because he is
mine!"</p>

<p>"That is a lie!" The handmaiden's voice shook with rage. "It
is a lie! But here and now he shall choose, Yolara. And if you he
choose, you and he shall go forth from here unmolested&mdash;for
Yolara, it is his happiness that I most desire, and if you are
that happiness&mdash;you shall go together. And now, Larry,
choose!"</p>

<p>Swiftly she stepped beside the priestess; swiftly wrenched the
last shreds of the hiding robes from her.</p>

<p>There they stood&mdash;Yolara with but the filmiest net of
gauze about her wonderful body; gleaming flesh shining through
it; serpent woman&mdash; and wonderful, too, beyond the dreams
even of Phidias&mdash;and hell-fire glowing from the purple
eyes.</p>

<p>And Lakla, like a girl of the Vikings, like one of those
warrior maids who stood and fought for man and babes at the side
of those old heroes of Larry's own green isle; translucent ivory
lambent through the rents of her torn draperies, and in the wide,
golden eyes flaming wrath, indeed&mdash;not the diabolic flames
of the priestess but the righteous wrath of some soul that
looking out of paradise sees vile wrong in the doing.</p>

<p>"Lakla," the O'Keefe's voice was subdued, hurt, "there
<i>is</i> no choice. I love you and only you&mdash;and have from
the moment I saw you. It's not easy&mdash;this. God, Goodwin, I
feel like an utter cad," he flashed at me. "There is no choice,
Lakla," he ended, eyes steady upon hers.</p>

<p>The priestess's face grew deadlier still.</p>

<p>"What will you do with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Keep you," I said, "as hostage."</p>

<p>O'Keefe was silent; the Golden Girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well would I like to," her face grew dreaming; "but the
Silent Ones say &mdash;<i>no</i>; they bid me let you go,
Yolara&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Silent Ones," the priestess laughed. "<i>You</i>, Lakla!
You fear, perhaps, to let me tarry here too close!"</p>

<p>Storm gathered again in the handmaiden's eyes; she forced it
back.</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "the Silent Ones so command&mdash;and for
their own purposes. Yet do I think, Yolara, that you will have
little time to feed your wickedness&mdash;tell that to
Lugur&mdash;and to your Shining One!" she added slowly.</p>

<p>Mockery and disbelief rode high in the priestess's pose. "Am I
to return alone&mdash;like this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Nay, Yolara, nay; you shall be accompanied," said Lakla; "and
by those who will guard&mdash;and <i>watch</i>&mdash;you well.
They are here even now."</p>

<p>The hangings parted, and into the chamber came Olaf and
Rador.</p>

<p>The priestess met the fierce hatred and contempt in the eyes
of the Norseman&mdash;and for the first time lost her
bravado.</p>

<p>"Let not <i>him</i> go with me," she gasped&mdash;her eyes
searched the floor frantically.</p>

<p>"He goes with you," said Lakla, and threw about Yolara a
swathing that covered the exquisite, alluring body. "And you
shall pass through the Portal, not skulk along the path of the
worm!"</p>

<p>She bent to Rador, whispered to him; he nodded; she had told
him, I supposed, the secret of its opening.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, and with the ice-eyed giant behind her,
Yolara, head bent, passed out of those hangings through which,
but a little before, unseen, triumph in her grasp, she had
slipped.</p>

<p>Then Lakla came to the unhappy O'Keefe, rested her hands on
his shoulders, looked deep into his eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> you woo her, even as she said?" she asked.</p>

<p>The Irishman flushed miserably.</p>

<p>"I did not," he said. "I was pleasant to her, of course,
because I thought it would bring me quicker to you, darlin'."</p>

<p>She looked at him doubtfully; then&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think you must have been <i>very</i>&mdash;pleasant!" was
all she said&mdash;and leaning, kissed him forgivingly straight
on the lips. An extremely direct maiden was Lakla, with a truly
sovereign contempt for anything she might consider non-essentials;
and at this moment I decided she was wiser even than
I had thought her.</p>

<p>He stumbled, feet vanishing; reached down and picked up
something that in the grasping turned his hand to air.</p>

<p>"One of the invisible cloaks," he said to me. "There must be
quite a lot of them about&mdash;I guess Yolara brought her full
staff of murderers. They're a bit shopworn, probably&mdash;but
we're considerably better off with 'em in our hands than in hers.
And they may come in handy&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>There was a choking rattle at my feet; half the head of a
dwarf raised out of vacancy; beat twice upon the floor in death
throes; fell back. Lakla shivered; gave a command. The frog-men
moved about; peering here and there; lifting unseen folds
revealing in stark rigidity torn form after form of the
priestess's men.</p>

<p>Lakla had been right&mdash;her <i>Akka</i> were thorough
fighters!</p>

<p>She called, and to her came the frog-woman who was her
attendant. To her the handmaiden spoke, pointing to the
batrachians who stood, paws and forearms melted beneath the robes
they had gathered. She took them and passed out&mdash;more
grotesque than ever, shattering into streaks of vacancies,
reappearing with flickers of shining scale and yellow gems as the
tattered pennants of invisibility fluttered about her.</p>

<p>The frog-men reached down, swung each a dead dwarf in his
arms, and filed, booming triumphantly away.</p>

<p>And then I remembered the cone of the <i>Keth</i> which had
slipped from Yolara's hand; knew it had been that for which her
wild eyes searched. But look as closely as we might, search in
every nook and corner as we did, we could not find it. Had the
dying hand of one of her men clutched it and had it been borne
away with them? With the thought Larry and I raced after the
scaled warriors, searched every body they carried. It was not
there. Perhaps the priestess had found it, retrieved it swiftly
without our seeing.</p>

<p>Whatever was true&mdash;the cone was gone. And what a weapon
that one little holder of the shaking death would have been for
us!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap28" id="chap28"></a>28. &mdash; IN THE LAIR OF
THE DWELLER</h2>

<p class="first">It is with marked hesitation that I begin this
chapter, because in it I must deal with an experience so contrary
to every known law of physics as to seem impossible. Until this
time, barring, of course, the mystery of the Dweller, I had
encountered nothing that was not susceptible of naturalistic
explanation; nothing, in a word, outside the domain of science
itself; nothing that I would have felt hesitancy in reciting to
my colleagues of the International Association of Science.
Amazing, unfamiliar&mdash; <i>advanced</i>&mdash;as many of the
phenomena were, still they lay well within the limits of what we
have mapped as the possible; in regions, it is true, still virgin
to the mind of man, but toward which that mind is steadily
advancing.</p>

<p>But this&mdash;well, I confess that I have a theory that is
naturalistic; but so abstruse, so difficult to make clear within
the short confines of the space I have to give it, so dependent
upon conceptions that even the highest-trained scientific brains
find difficult to grasp, that I despair.</p>

<p>I can only say that the thing occurred; that it took place in
precisely the manner I am about to narrate, and that I
experienced it.</p>

<p>Yet, in justice to myself, I must open up some paths of
preliminary approach toward the heart of the perplexity. And the
first path is the realization that our world <i>whatever</i> it
is, is certainly <i>not</i> the world as we see it! Regarding
this I shall refer to a discourse upon "Gravitation and the
Principle of Relativity," by the distinguished English physicist,
Dr. A. S. Eddington, which I had the pleasure of hearing him
deliver before the Royal Institution.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *Reprinted in full in <i>Nature</i>, in
which those sufficiently interested may peruse it.&mdash;W.T.G.
]</p>

<p>I realize, of course, that it is not true logic to
argue&mdash;"The world is not as we think it is&mdash;therefore
everything we think impossible is possible in it." Even if it
<i>be</i> different, it is governed by <i>law</i>. The truly
impossible is that which is outside law, and as nothing
<i>can</i> be outside law, the impossible <i>cannot</i>
exist.</p>

<p>The crux of the matter then becomes our determination whether
what we think is impossible may or may not be possible under laws
still beyond our knowledge.</p>

<p>I hope that you will pardon me for this somewhat academic
digression, but I felt it was necessary, and it has, at least,
put me more at ease. And now to resume.</p>

<p>We had watched, Larry and I, the frog-men throw the bodies of
Yolara's assassins into the crimson waters. As vultures swoop
down upon the dying, there came sailing swiftly to where the dead
men floated, dozens of the luminous globes. Their slender,
varicolored tentacles whipped out; the giant iridescent bubbles
<i>climbed</i> over the cadavers. And as they touched them there
was the swift dissolution, the melting away into putrescence of
flesh and bone that I had witnessed when the dart touched fruit
that time I had saved Rador&mdash;and upon this the Medusae
gorged; pulsing lambently; their wondrous colors shifting,
changing, glowing stronger; elfin moons now indeed, but
satellites whose glimmering beauty was fed by death; alembics of
enchantment whose glorious hues were sucked from horror.</p>

<p>Sick, I turned away&mdash;O'Keefe as pale as I; passed back
into the corridor that had opened on the ledge from which we had
watched; met Lakla hurrying toward us. Before she could speak
there throbbed faintly about us a vast sighing. It grew into a
murmur, a whispering, shook us&mdash;then passing like a
presence, died away in far distance.</p>

<p>"The Portal has opened," said the handmaiden. A fainter
sighing, like an echo of the other, mourned about us. "Yolara is
gone," she said, "the Portal is closed. Now must we
hasten&mdash;for the Three have commanded that you, Goodwin, and
Larry and I tread that strange road of which I have spoken, and
which Olaf may not take lest his heart break&mdash;and we must
return ere he and Rador cross the bridge."</p>

<p>Her hand sought Larry's.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Lakla, and we walked on; down and down through
hall after hall, flight upon flight of stairways. Deep, deep
indeed, we must be beneath the domed castle&mdash;Lakla paused
before a curved, smooth breast of the crimson stone rounding
gently into the passage. She pressed its side; it revolved; we
entered; it closed behind us.</p>

<p>The room, the&mdash;hollow&mdash;in which we stood was faceted
like a diamond; and like a cut brilliant its sides
glistened&mdash;though dully. Its shape was a deep oval, and our
path dropped down to a circular polished base, roughly two yards
in diameter. Glancing behind me I saw that in the closing of the
entrance there had been left no trace of it save the steps that
led from where that entrance had been&mdash;and as I looked these
steps <i>turned</i>, leaving us isolated upon the circle, only
the faceted walls about us&mdash;and in each of the gleaming
faces the three of us reflected&mdash;dimly. It was as though we
were within a diamond egg whose graven angles had been turned
<i>inward</i>.</p>

<p>But the oval was not perfect; at my right a screen cut
it&mdash;a screen that gleamed with fugitive, fleeting
luminescences&mdash;stretching from the side of our standing
place up to the tip of the chamber; slightly convex and
crisscrossed by millions of fine lines like those upon a
spectroscopic plate, but with this difference&mdash;that within
each line I sensed the presence of multitudes of finer lines,
dwindling into infinitude, ultramicroscopic, traced by some
instrument compared to whose delicacy our finest tool would be as
a crowbar to the needle of a micrometer.</p>

<p>A foot or two from it stood something like the standee of a
compass, bearing, like it a cradled dial under whose crystal ran
concentric rings of prisoned, lambent vapors, faintly blue. From
the edge of the dial jutted a little shelf of crystal, a
keyboard, in which were cut eight small cups.</p>

<p>Within these cups the handmaiden placed her tapering fingers.
She gazed down upon the disk; pressed a digit&mdash;and the
screen behind us slipped noiselessly into another angle.</p>

<p>"Put your arm around my waist, Larry, darlin', and stand
close," she murmured. "You, Goodwin, place your arm over my
shoulder."</p>

<p>Wondering, I did as she bade; she pressed other fingers upon
the shelf's indentations&mdash;three of the rings of vapor spun
into intense light, raced around each other; from the screen
behind us grew a radiance that held within itself all
spectrums&mdash;not only those seen, but those <i>unseen</i> by
man's eyes. It waxed brilliant and ever more brilliant,
all-suffusing, passing through me as day streams through a window
pane!</p>

<p>The enclosing facets burst into a blaze of coruscations, and
in each sparkling panel I saw our images, shaken and torn like
pennants in a whirlwind. I turned to look&mdash;was stopped by
the handmaiden's swift command: "Turn not&mdash;on your
life!"</p>

<p>The radiance behind me grew; was a rushing tempest of light in
which I was but the shadow of a shadow. I heard, but not with my
ears&mdash;nay with <i>mind</i> itself&mdash;a vast roaring; an
<i>ordered</i> tumult of sound that came hurling from the
outposts of space; approaching&mdash;rushing &mdash;hurricane out
of the heart of the cosmos&mdash;closer, closer. It wrapped
itself about us with unearthly mighty arms.</p>

<p>And brilliant, ever more brilliant, streamed the radiance
through us.</p>

<p>The faceted walls dimmed; in front of me they melted,
diaphanously, like a gelatinous wall in a blast of flame; through
their vanishing, under the torrent of driving light, the
unthinkable, impalpable tornado, I began to move,
slowly&mdash;then ever more swiftly!</p>

<p>Still the roaring grew; the radiance streamed&mdash;ever
faster we went. Cutting down through the length, the
<i>extension</i> of me, dropped a wall of rock, foreshortened,
clenched close; I caught a glimpse of the elfin gardens; they
whirled, contracted, into a thin&mdash;slice&mdash;of color that
was a part of me; another wall of rock shrinking into a thin
wedge through which I flew, and that at once took its place
within me like a card slipped beside those others!</p>

<p>Flashing around me, and from Lakla and O'Keefe, were nimbuses
of flickering scarlet flames. And always the steady hurling
forward&mdash; appallingly mechanical.</p>

<p>Another barrier of rock&mdash;a gleam of white waters
incorporating themselves into my&mdash;<i>drawing
out</i>&mdash;even as were the flowered moss-lands, the slicing,
rocky walls&mdash;still another rampart of cliff, dwindling
instantly into the vertical plane of those others. Our flight
checked; we seemed to hover within, then to sway onward&mdash;
slowly, cautiously.</p>

<p>A mist danced ahead of me&mdash;a mist that grew steadily
thinner. We stopped, wavered&mdash;the mist cleared.</p>

<p>I looked out into translucent, green distances; shot with
swift prismatic gleamings; waves and pulsings of luminosity like
midday sun glow through green, tropic waters: dancing,
scintillating veils of sparkling atoms that flew, hither and yon,
through depths of nebulous splendor!</p>

<p>And Lakla and Larry and I were, I saw, like shadow shapes upon
a smooth breast of stone twenty feet or more above the surface of
this place&mdash;a surface spangled with tiny white blossoms
gleaming wanly through creeping veils of phosphorescence like
smoke of moon fire. We were shadows&mdash;and yet we had
substance; we were incorporated with, a part of, the rock&mdash;
and yet we were living flesh and blood; we stretched&mdash;nor
will I qualify this&mdash;we <i>stretched</i> through mile upon
mile of space that weirdly enough gave at one and the same time
an absolute certainty of immense horizontal lengths and a
vertical concentration that contained nothing of length, nothing
of space whatever; we stood <i>there</i> upon the face of the
stone&mdash;and still we were <i>here</i> within the faceted oval
before the screen of radiance!</p>

<p>"Steady!" It was Lakla's voice&mdash;and not beside me
<i>there</i>, but at my ear close before the screen. "Steady,
Goodwin! And&mdash;see!"</p>

<p>The sparkling haze cleared. Enormous reaches stretched before
me. Shimmering up through them, and as though growing in some
medium thicker than air, was mass upon mass of
verdure&mdash;fruiting trees and trees laden with pale blossoms,
arbors and bowers of pallid blooms, like that sea fruit of
oblivion&mdash;grapes of Lethe&mdash;that cling to the tide-swept
walls of the caverns of the Hebrides.</p>

<p>Through them, beyond them, around and about them, drifted and
eddied a horde&mdash;great as that with which Tamerlane swept
down upon Rome, vast as the myriads which Genghis Khan rolled
upon the califs&mdash;men and women and children&mdash;clothed in
tatters, half nude and wholly naked; slant-eyed Chinese, sloe-eyed
Malays, islanders black and brown and yellow, fierce-faced
warriors of the Solomons with grizzled locks fantastically
bedizened; Papuans, feline Javans, Dyaks of hill and shore;
hook-nosed Phoenicians, Romans, straight-browed Greeks, and Vikings
centuries <i>beyond</i> their lives: scores of the black-haired
Murians; white faces of our own Westerners&mdash;men and women
and children&mdash;drifting, eddying&mdash;each stamped with that
mingled horror and rapture, eyes filled with ecstasy and terror
entwined, marked by God and devil in embrace &mdash;the seal of
the Shining One&mdash;the dead-alive; the lost ones!</p>

<p>The loot of the Dweller!</p>

<p>Soul-sick, I gazed. They lifted to us visages of dread; they
swept down toward us, glaring upward&mdash;a bank against which
other and still other waves of faces rolled, were checked,
paused; until as far as I could see, like billows piled upon an
ever-growing barrier, they stretched beneath us
&mdash;staring&mdash;staring!</p>

<p>Now there was a movement&mdash;far, far away; a concentrating
of the lambency; the dead-alive swayed, oscillated,
separated&mdash;forming a long lane against whose outskirts they
crowded with avid, hungry insistence.</p>

<p>First only a luminous cloud, then a whirling pillar of
splendors through the lane came&mdash;the Shining One. As it
passed, the dead-alive swirled in its wake like leaves behind a
whirlwind, eddying, twisting; and as the Dweller raced by them,
brushing them with its spiralings and tentacles, they shone forth
with unearthly, awesome gleamings&mdash;like vessels of alabaster
in which wicks flare suddenly. And when it had passed they closed
behind it, staring up at us once more.</p>

<p>The Dweller paused beneath us.</p>

<p>Out of the drifting ruck swam the body of Throckmartin!
Throckmartin, my friend, to find whom I had gone to the pallid
moon door; my friend whose call I had so laggardly followed. On
his face was the Dweller's dreadful stamp; the lips were
bloodless; the eyes were wide, lucent, something like pale,
phosphorescence gleaming within them&mdash;and soulless.</p>

<p>He stared straight up at me, unwinking, unrecognizing.
Pressing against his side was a woman, young and gentle, and
lovely&mdash;lovely even through the mask that lay upon her face.
And her wide eyes, like Throckmartin's, glowed with the lurking,
unholy fires. She pressed against him closely; though the hordes
kept up the faint churning, these two kept ever together, as
though bound by unseen fetters.</p>

<p>And I knew the girl for Edith, his wife, who in vain effort to
save him had cast herself into the Dweller's embrace!</p>

<p>"Throckmartin!" I cried. "Throckmartin! I'm here!"</p>

<p>Did he hear? I know now, of course, he could not.</p>

<p>But then I waited&mdash;hope striving to break through the
nightmare hands that gripped my heart.</p>

<p>Their wide eyes never left me. There was another movement
about them, others pushed past them; they drifted back, swaying,
eddying&mdash;and still staring were lost in the awful
throng.</p>

<p>Vainly I strained my gaze to find them again, to force some
sign of recognition, some awakening of the clean life we know.
But they were gone. Try as I would I could not see them&mdash;nor
Stanton and the northern woman named Thora who had been the first
of that tragic party to be taken by the Dweller.</p>

<p>"Throckmartin!" I cried again, despairingly. My tears blinded
me.</p>

<p>I felt Lakla's light touch.</p>

<p>"Steady," she commanded, pitifully. "Steady, Goodwin. You
cannot help them &mdash;now! Steady and&mdash;watch!"</p>

<p>Below us the Shining One had paused&mdash;spiraling, swirling,
vibrant with all its transcendent, devilish beauty; had paused
and was contemplating us. Now I could see clearly that nucleus,
that core shot through with flashing veins of radiance, that
ever-shifting shape of glory through the shroudings of
shimmering, misty plumes, throbbing lacy opalescences, vaporous
spiralings of prismatic phantom fires. Steady over it hung the
seven little moons of amethyst, of saffron, of emerald and azure
and silver, of rose of life and moon white. They poised
themselves like a diadem&mdash;calm, serene, immobile&mdash;and
down from them into the Dweller, piercing plumes and swirls and
spirals, ran countless tiny strands, radiations, finer than the
finest spun thread of spider's web, gleaming filaments through
which seemed to run&mdash;<i>power</i>&mdash;from the seven
globes; like &mdash;yes, that was it&mdash;miniatures of the
seven torrents of moon flame that poured through the
septichromatic, high crystals in the Moon Pool's chamber
roof.</p>

<p>Swam out of the coruscating haze the&mdash;face!</p>

<p>Both of man and of woman it was&mdash;like some ancient,
androgynous deity of Etruscan fanes long dust, and yet neither
woman nor man; human and unhuman, seraphic and sinister, benign
and malefic&mdash;and still no more of these four than is flame,
which is beautiful whether it warms or devours, or wind whether
it feathers the trees or shatters them, or the wave which is
wondrous whether it caresses or kills.</p>

<p>Subtly, undefinably it was of our world and of one not ours.
Its lineaments flowed from another sphere, took fleeting familiar
form&mdash; and as swiftly withdrew whence they had come;
something amorphous, unearthly &mdash;as of unknown unheeding,
unseen gods rushing through the depths of star-hung space; and
still of our own earth, with the very soul of earth peering out
from it, caught within it&mdash;and in some&mdash;unholy
&mdash;way debased.</p>

<p>It had eyes&mdash;eyes that were now only shadows darkening
within its luminosity like veils falling, and falling,
<i>opening</i> windows into the unknowable; deepening into softly
glowing blue pools, blue as the Moon Pool itself; then flashing
out, and this only when the&mdash;face&mdash;bore its most human
resemblance, into twin stars large almost as the crown of little
moons; and with that same baffling suggestion of peep-holes into
a world untrodden, alien, perilous to man!</p>

<p>"Steady!" came Lakla's voice, her body leaned against
mine.</p>

<p>I gripped myself, my brain steadied, I looked again. And I saw
that of body, at least body as we know it, the Shining One had
none&mdash;nothing but the throbbing, pulsing core streaked with
lightning veins of rainbows; and around this, never still,
sheathing it, the swirling, glorious veilings of its
hell-and-heaven-born radiance.</p>

<p>So the Dweller stood&mdash;and gazed.</p>

<p>Then up toward us swept a reaching, questing spiral!</p>

<p>Under my hand Lakla's shoulder quivered; dead-alive and their
master vanished&mdash;I danced, flickered, <i>within</i> the
rock; felt a swift sense of shrinking, of withdrawal; slice upon
slice the carded walls of stone, of silvery waters, of elfin
gardens slipped from me as cards are withdrawn from a pack, one
by one&mdash;slipped, wheeled, flattened, and lengthened out as I
passed through them and they passed from me.</p>

<p>Gasping, shaken, weak, I stood within the faceted oval
chamber; arm still about the handmaiden's white shoulder; Larry's
hand still clutching her girdle.</p>

<p>The roaring, impalpable gale from the cosmos was retreating to
the outposts of space&mdash;was still; the intense, streaming,
flooding radiance lessened&mdash;died.</p>

<p>"Now have you beheld," said Lakla, "and well you trod the
road. And now shall you hear, even as the Silent Ones have
commanded, what the Shining One is&mdash;and how it came to
be."</p>

<p>The steps flashed back; the doorway into the chamber
opened.</p>

<p>Larry as silent as I&mdash;we followed her through it.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap29" id="chap29"></a>29. &mdash; THE SHAPING OF
THE SHINING ONE</h2>

<p class="first">We reached what I knew to be Lakla's own
boudoir, if I may so call it. Smaller than any of the other
chambers of the domed castle in which we had been, its intimacy
was revealed not only by its faint fragrance but by its high
mirrors of polished silver and various oddly wrought articles of
the feminine toilet that lay here and there; things I afterward
knew to be the work of the artisans of the <i>Akka</i>&mdash;and
no mean metal workers were they. One of the window slits dropped
almost to the floor, and at its base was a wide, comfortably
cushioned seat commanding a view of the bridge and of the cavern
ledge. To this the handmaiden beckoned us; sank upon it, drew
Larry down beside her and motioned me to sit close to him.</p>

<p>"Now this," she said, "is what the Silent Ones have commanded
me to tell you two: To you Larry, that knowing you may weigh all
things in your mind and answer as your spirit bids you a question
that the Three will ask&mdash;and what that is I know not," she
murmured, "and I, they say, must answer, too &mdash;and
it&mdash;frightens me!"</p>

<p>The great golden eyes widened; darkened with dread; she
sighed, shook her head impatiently.</p>

<p>"Not like us, and never like us," she spoke low, wonderingly,
"the Silent Ones say were they. Nor were those from which they
sprang like those from which we have come. Ancient, ancient
beyond thought are the <i>Taithu</i>, the race of the Silent
Ones. Far, far below this place where now we sit, close to earth
heart itself were they born; and there they dwelt for time upon
time, <i>laya</i> upon <i>laya</i> upon <i>laya</i>&mdash;with
others, not like them, some of which have vanished time upon time
agone, others that still dwell&mdash;below&mdash;in
their&mdash;cradle.</p>

<p>"It is hard"&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;"hard to tell
this&mdash;that slips through my mind&mdash;because I know so
little that even as the Three told it to me it passed from me for
lack of place to stand upon," she went on, quaintly. "Something
there was of time when earth and sun were but cold mists in
the&mdash;the heavens&mdash;something of these mists drawing
together, whirling, whirling, faster and faster&mdash;drawing as
they whirled more and more of the mists&mdash;growing larger,
growing warm &mdash;forming at last into the globes they are,
with others spinning around the sun&mdash;something of regions
within this globe where vast fire was prisoned and bursting forth
tore and rent the young orb&mdash;of one such bursting forth that
sent what you call moon flying out to company us and left behind
those spaces whence we now dwell&mdash;and of&mdash;of life
particles that here and there below grew into the race of the
Silent Ones, and those others&mdash;but not the <i>Akka</i>
which, like you, they say came from above&mdash;and all this I do
not understand&mdash;do you, Goodwin?" she appealed to me.</p>

<p>I nodded&mdash;for what she had related so fragmentarily was
in reality an excellent approach to the Chamberlain-Moulton
theory of a coalescing nebula contracting into the sun and its
planets.</p>

<p>Astonishing was the recognition of this theory. Even more so
was the reference to the life particles, the idea of Arrhenius,
the great Swede, of life starting on earth through the dropping
of minute, life <i>spores</i>, propelled through space by the
driving power of light and, encountering favorable environment
here, developing through the vast ages into man and every other
living thing we know.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[ *Professor Svante August Arrhenius, in his
<i>Worlds in the Making</i>&mdash;the conception that life is
universally diffused, constantly emitted from all habitable
worlds in the form of spores which traverse space for years and
ages, the majority being ultimately destroyed by the heat of some
blazing star, but some few finding a resting-place on globes
which have reached the habitable stage.&mdash;W.T.G. ]</p>

<p>Nor was it incredible that in the ancient nebula that was the
matrix of our solar system similar, or rather <i>dissimilar</i>,
particles in all but the subtle essence we call life, might have
become entangled and, resisting every cataclysm as they had
resisted the absolute zero of outer space, found in these
caverned spaces their proper environment to develop into the race
of the Silent Ones and&mdash;only <i>they</i> could tell what
else!</p>

<p>"They say," the handmaiden's voice was surer, "they say that
in their &mdash;cradle&mdash;near earth's heart they grew; grew
untroubled by the turmoil and disorder which flayed the surface
of this globe. And they say it was a place of light and that
strength came to them from earth heart&mdash; strength greater
than you and those from which you sprang ever derived from
sun.</p>

<p>"At last, ancient, ancient beyond all thought, they say again,
was this time&mdash;they began to know,
to&mdash;to&mdash;realize&mdash; themselves. And wisdom came ever
more swiftly. Up from their cradle, because they did not wish to
dwell longer with those&mdash;others&mdash;they came and found
this place.</p>

<p>"When all the face of earth was covered with waters in which
lived only tiny, hungry things that knew naught save hunger and
its satisfaction, <i>they</i> had attained wisdom that enabled
them to make paths such as we have just traveled and to look out
upon those waters! And <i>laya</i> upon <i>laya</i> thereafter,
time upon time, they went upon the paths and watched the flood
recede; saw great bare flats of steaming ooze appear on which
crawled and splashed larger things which had grown from the tiny
hungry ones; watched the flats rise higher and higher and green
life begin to clothe them; saw mountains uplift and vanish.</p>

<p>"Ever the green life waxed and the things which crept and
crawled grew greater and took ever different forms; until at last
came a time when the steaming mists lightened and the things
which had begun as little more than tiny hungry mouths were huge
and monstrous, so huge that the tallest of my <i>Akka</i> would
not have reached the knee of the smallest of them.</p>

<p>"But in none of these, in <i>none</i>, was
there&mdash;realization &mdash;of themselves, say the Three;
naught but hunger driving, always driving them to still its
crying.</p>

<p>"So for time upon time the race of the Silent Ones took the
paths no more, placing aside the half-thought that they had of
making their way to earth face even as they had made their way
from beside earth heart. They turned wholly to the seeking of
wisdom&mdash;and after other time on time they attained that
which killed even the faintest shadow of the half-thought. For
they crept far within the mysteries of life and death, they
mastered the illusion of space, they lifted the veils of creation
and of its twin destruction, and they stripped the covering from
the flaming jewel of truth &mdash;but when they had crept within
those mysteries they bid me tell <i>you</i>, Goodwin, they found
ever other mysteries veiling the way; and after they had
uncovered the jewel of truth they found it to be a gem of
infinite facets and therefore not wholly to be read before
eternity's unthinkable end!</p>

<p>"And for this they were glad&mdash;because now throughout
eternity might they and theirs pursue knowledge over ways
illimitable.</p>

<p>"They conquered light&mdash;light that sprang at their bidding
from the nothingness that gives birth to all things and in which
lie all things that are, have been and shall be; light that
streamed through their bodies cleansing them of all dross; light
that was food and drink; light that carried their vision afar or
bore to them images out of space opening many windows through
which they gazed down upon life on thousands upon thousands of
the rushing worlds; light that was the flame of life itself and
in which they bathed, ever renewing their own. They set radiant
lamps within the stones, and of black light they wove the
sheltering shadows and the shadows that slay.</p>

<p>"Arose from this people those Three&mdash;the Silent Ones.
They led them all in wisdom so that in the Three
grew&mdash;pride. And the Three built them this place in which we
sit and set the Portal in its place and withdrew from their kind
to go alone into the mysteries and to map alone the facets of
Truth Jewel.</p>

<p>"Then there came the ancestors of the&mdash;<i>Akka</i>; not
as they are now, and glowing but faintly within them the spark
of&mdash;self-realization. And the <i>Taithu</i> seeing this
spark did not slay them. But they took the ancient, long
untrodden paths and looked forth once more upon earth face. Now
on the land were vast forests and a chaos of green life. On the
shores things scaled and fanged, fought and devoured each other,
and in the green life moved bodies great and small that slew and
ran from those that would slay.</p>

<p>"They searched for the passage through which the <i>Akka</i>
had come and closed it. Then the Three took them and brought them
here; and taught them and blew upon the spark until it burned
ever stronger and in time they became much as they are
now&mdash;my <i>Akka</i>.</p>

<p>"The Three took counsel after this and said&mdash;'We have
strengthened life in these until it has become articulate; shall
we not <i>create</i>life?'" Again she hesitated, her eyes rapt,
dreaming. "The Three are speaking," she murmured. "They have my
tongue&mdash;"</p>

<p>And certainly, with an ease and rapidity as though she were
but a voice through which minds far more facile, more powerful
poured their thoughts, she spoke.</p>

<p>"Yea," the golden voice was vibrant. "We said that what we
would create should be of the spirit of life itself, speaking to
us with the tongues of the far-flung stars, of the winds, of the
waters, and of all upon and within these. Upon that universal
matrix of matter, that mother of all things that you name the
ether, we labored. Think not that her wondrous fertility is
limited by what ye see on earth or what has been on earth from
its beginning. Infinite, infinite are the forms the mother bears
and countless are the energies that are part of her.</p>

<p>"By our wisdom we had fashioned many windows out of our abode
and through them we stared into the faces of myriads of worlds,
and upon them all were the children of ether even as the worlds
themselves were her children.</p>

<p>"Watching we learned, and learning we formed that ye term the
Dweller, which those without name&mdash;the Shining One. Within
the Universal Mother we shaped it, to be a voice to tell us her
secrets, a lamp to go before us lighting the mysteries. Out of
the ether we fashioned it, giving it the soul of light that still
ye know not nor perhaps ever may know, and with the essence of
life that ye saw blossoming deep in the abyss and that is the
pulse of earth heart we filled it. And we wrought with pain and
with love, with yearning and with scorching pride and from our
travail came the Shining One&mdash;our child!</p>

<p>"There is an energy beyond and above ether, a purposeful,
sentient force that laps like an ocean the furthest-flung star,
that transfuses all that ether bears, that sees and speaks and
feels in us and in you, that is incorporate in beast and bird and
reptile, in tree and grass and all living things, that sleeps in
rock and stone, that finds sparkling tongue in jewel and star and
in all dwellers within the firmament. And this ye call
consciousness!</p>

<p>"We crowned the Shining One with the seven orbs of light which
are the channels between it and the sentience we sought to make
articulate, the portals through which flow its currents and so
flowing, become choate, vocal, self-realizant within our
child.</p>

<p>"But as we shaped, there passed some of the essence of our
pride; in giving will we had given power, perforce, to exercise
that will for good or for evil, to speak or to be silent, to tell
us what we wished of that which poured into it through the seven
orbs or to withhold that knowledge itself; and in forging it from
the immortal energies we had endowed it with their indifference;
open to all consciousness it held within it the pole of utter joy
and the pole of utter woe with all the arc that lies between; all
the ecstasies of the countless worlds and suns and all their
sorrows; all that ye symbolize as gods and all ye symbolize as
devils&mdash;not negativing each other, for there is no such
thing as negation, but holding them together, balancing them,
encompassing them, pole upon pole!"</p>

<p>So <i>this</i> was the explanation of the entwined emotions of
joy and terror that had changed so appallingly Throckmartin's
face and the faces of all the Dweller's slaves!</p>

<p>The handmaiden's eyes grew bright, alert, again; the brooding
passed from her face; the golden voice that had been so deep
found its own familiar pitch.</p>

<p>"I listened while the Three spoke to you," she said. "Now the
shaping of the Shining One had been a long, long travail and time
had flown over the outer world <i>laya</i> upon <i>laya</i>. For
a space the Shining One was content to dwell here; to be fed with
the foods of light: to open the eyes of the Three to mystery upon
mystery and to read for them facet after facet of the gem of
truth. Yet as the tides of consciousness flowed through it they
left behind shadowings and echoes of their burdens; and the
Shining One grew stronger, always stronger of <i>itself within
itself</i>. Its will strengthened and now not always was it the
will of the Three; and the pride that was woven in the making of
it waxed, while the love for them that its creators had set
within it waned.</p>

<p>"Not ignorant were the <i>Taithu</i> of the work of the Three.
First there were a few, then more and more who coveted the
Shining One and who would have had the Three share with them the
knowledge it drew in for them. But the Silent Ones in their
pride, would not.</p>

<p>"There came a time when its will was now <i>all</i> its own,
and it rebelled, turning its gaze to the wider spaces beyond the
Portal, offering itself to the many there who would serve it;
tiring of the Three, their control and their abode.</p>

<p>"Now the Shining One has its limitations, even as we. Over
water it can pass, through air and through fire; but pass it
cannot, through rock or metal. So it sent a message&mdash;how I
know not&mdash;to the <i>Taithu</i>who desired it, whispering to
them the secret of the Portal. And when the time was ripe they
opened the Portal and the Shining One passed through it to them;
nor would it return to the Three though they commanded, and when
they would have forced it they found that it had hived and hidden
a knowledge that they could not overcome.</p>

<p>"Yet by their arts the Three could have shattered the seven
shining orbs; but they would not because&mdash;they loved,
it!</p>

<p>"Those to whom it had gone built for it that place I have
shown you, and they bowed to it and drew wisdom from it. And ever
they turned more and more from the ways in which the
<i>Taithu</i> had walked&mdash;for it seemed that which came to
the Shining One through the seven orbs had less and less of good
and more and more of the power you call evil. Knowledge it gave
and understanding, yes; but not that which, clear and serene,
lights the paths of right wisdom; rather were they flares
pointing the dark roads that lead to &mdash;to the ultimate
evil!</p>

<p>"Not all of the race of the Three followed the counsel of the
Shining One. There were many, many, who would have none of it nor
of its power. So were the <i>Taithu</i> split; and to this place
where there had been none, came hatred, fear and suspicion. Those
who pursued the ancient ways went to the Three and pleaded with
them to destroy their work&mdash;and they would not, for still
they loved it.</p>

<p>"Stronger grew the Dweller and less and less did it lay before
its worshipers&mdash;for now so they had become&mdash;the fruits
of its knowledge; and it grew&mdash;restless&mdash;turning its
gaze upon earth face even as it had turned it from the Three. It
whispered to the <i>Taithu</i> to take again the paths and look
out upon the world. Lo! above them was a great fertile land on
which dwelt an unfamiliar race, skilled in arts, seeking and
finding wisdom&mdash;mankind! Mighty builders were they; vast
were their cities and huge their temples of stone.</p>

<p>"They called their lands Muria and they worshipped a god
Thanaroa whom they imagined to be the maker of all things,
dwelling far away. They worshipped as closer gods, not
indifferent but to be prayed to and to be propitiated, the moon
and the sun. Two kings they had, each with his council and his
court. One was high priest to the moon and the other high priest
to the sun.</p>

<p>"The mass of this people were black-haired, but the sun king
and his nobles were ruddy with hair like mine; and the moon king
and his followers were like Yolara&mdash;or Lugur. And this, the
Three say, Goodwin, came about because for time upon time the law
had been that whenever a ruddy-haired or ashen-tressed child was
born of the black-haired it became dedicated at once to either
sun god or moon god, later wedding and bearing children only to
their own kind. Until at last from the black-haired came no more
of the light-locked ones, but the ruddy ones, being stronger,
still arose from them."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap30" id="chap30"></a>30. &mdash; THE BUILDING OF
THE MOON POOL</h2>

<p class="first">She paused, running her long fingers through her
own bronze-flecked ringlets. Selective breeding this, with a
vengeance, I thought; an ancient experiment in heredity which of
course would in time result in the stamping out of the tendency
to depart from type that lies in all organisms; resulting,
obviously, at last, in three fixed forms of black-haired,
ruddy-haired, and silver-haired&mdash;but this, with a shock of
realization it came to me, was also an accurate description of
the dark-polled <i>ladala</i>, their fair-haired rulers and of
the golden-brown tressed Lakla!</p>

<p>How&mdash;questions began to stream through my mind; silenced
by the handmaiden's voice.</p>

<p>"Above, far, far above the abode of the Shining One," she
said, "was their greatest temple, holding the shrines both of sun
and moon. All about it were other temples hidden behind mighty
walls, each enclosing its own space and squared and ruled and
standing within a shallow lake; the sacred city, the city of the
gods of this land&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is the Nan-Matal that she is describing," I thought.</p>

<p>"Out upon all this looked the <i>Taithu</i> who were now but
the servants of the Shining One as it had been the messenger of
the Three," she went on. "When they returned the Shining One
spoke to them, promising them dominion over all that they had
seen, yea, <i>under it</i> dominion of all earth itself and later
perhaps of other earths!</p>

<p>"In the Shining One had grown craft, cunning; knowledge to
gain that which it desired. Therefore it told its
<i>Taithu</i>&mdash;and mayhap told them truth&mdash;that not yet
was it time for <i>them</i> to go forth; that slowly must they
pass into that outer world, for they had sprung from heart of
earth and even it lacked power to swirl unaided into and through
the above. Then it counselled them, instructing them what to do.
They hollowed the chamber wherein first I saw you, cutting their
way to it that path down which from it you sped.</p>

<p>"It revealed to them that the force that is within moon flame
is kin to the force that is within it, for the chamber of its
birth was the chamber too of moon birth and into it went the
subtle essence and powers that flow in that earth child: and it
taught them how to make that which fills what you call the Moon
Pool whose opening is close behind its Veil hanging upon the
gleaming cliffs.</p>

<p>"When this was done it taught them how to make and how to
place the seven lights through which moon flame streams into Moon
Pool&mdash;the seven lights that are kin to its own seven orbs
even as its fires are kin to moon fires&mdash;and which would
open for it a path that it could tread. And all this the
<i>Taithu</i> did, working so secretly that neither those of
their race whose faces were set against the Shining One nor the
busy men above know aught of it.</p>

<p>"When it was done they moved up the path, clustering within
the Moon Pool Chamber. Moon flame streamed through the seven
globes, poured down upon the pool; they saw mists arise, embrace,
and become one with the moon flame &mdash;and then up through
Moon Pool, shaping itself within the mists of light, whirling,
radiant&mdash;the Shining One!</p>

<p>"Almost free, almost loosed upon the world it coveted!</p>

<p>"Again it counselled them, and they pierced the passage whose
portal you found first; set the fires within its stones, and
revealing themselves to the moon king and his priests spake to
them even as the Shining One had instructed.</p>

<p>"Now was the moon king filled with fear when he looked upon
the <i>Taithu</i>, shrouded with protecting mists of light in
Moon Pool Chamber, and heard their words. Yet, being crafty, he
thought of the power that would be his if he heeded and how
quickly the strength of the sun king would dwindle. So he and his
made a pact with the Shining One's messengers.</p>

<p>"When next the moon was round and poured its flames down upon
Moon Pool, the <i>Taithu</i> gathered there again, watched the
child of the Three take shape within the pillars, speed
away&mdash;and out! They heard a mighty shouting, a tumult of
terror, of awe and of worship; a silence; a vast
sighing&mdash;and they waited, wrapped in their mists of light,
for they feared to follow nor were they near the paths that would
have enabled them to look without.</p>

<p>"Another tumult&mdash;and back came the Shining One, murmuring
with joy, pulsing, triumphant, and clasped within its vapors a
man and woman, ruddy-haired, golden-eyed, in whose faces rapture
and horror lay side by side &mdash;gloriously, hideously. And
still holding them it danced above the Moon Pool
and&mdash;sank!</p>

<p>"Now must I be brief. <i>Lat</i> after <i>lat</i> the Shining
One went forth, returning with its sacrifices. And stronger after
each it grew&mdash; and gayer and more cruel. Ever when it passed
with its prey toward the pool, the <i>Taithu</i> who watched felt
a swift, strong intoxication, a drunkenness of spirit, streaming
from it to them. And the Shining One forgot what it had promised
them of dominion&mdash;and in this new evil delight they too
forgot.</p>

<p>"The outer land was torn with hatred and open strife. The moon
king and his kind, through the guidance of the evil <i>Taithu</i>
and the favor of the Shining One, had become powerful and the sun
king and his were darkened. And the moon priests preached that
the child of the Three was the moon god itself come to dwell with
them.</p>

<p>"Now vast tides arose and when they withdrew they took with
them great portions of this country. And the land itself began to
sink. Then said the moon king that the moon had called to ocean
to destroy because wroth that another than he was worshipped. The
people believed and there was slaughter. When it was over there
was no more a sun king nor any of the ruddy-haired folk; slain
were they, slain down to the babe at breast.</p>

<p>"But still the tides swept higher; still dwindled the
land!</p>

<p>"As it shrank multitudes of the fleeing people were led
through Moon Pool Chamber and carried here. They were what now
are called the <i>ladala</i>, and they were given place and set
to work; and they thrived. Came many of the fair-haired; and they
were given dwellings. They sat beside the evil <i>Taithu</i>;
they became drunk even as they with the dancing of the Shining
One; they learned&mdash;not all; only a little part but little
enough &mdash;of their arts. And ever the Shining One danced more
gaily out there within the black amphitheater; grew ever
stronger&mdash;and ever the hordes of its slaves behind the Veil
increased.</p>

<p>"Nor did the <i>Taithu</i> who clung to the old ways check
this&mdash; they could not. By the sinking of the land above,
their own spaces were imperiled. All of their strength and all of
their wisdom it took to keep this land from perishing; nor had
they help from those others mad for the poison of the Shining
One; and they had no time to deal with them nor the earth race
with whom they had foregathered.</p>

<p>"At last came a slow, vast flood. It rolled even to the bases
of the walled islets of the city of the gods&mdash;and within
these now were all that were left of my people on earth face.</p>

<p>"I am of those people," she paused, looking at me proudly,
"one of the daughters of the sun king whose seed is still alive
in the <i>ladala</i>!"</p>

<p>As Larry opened his mouth to speak she waved a silencing
hand.</p>

<p>"This tide did not recede," she went on. "And after a time the
remnant, the moon king leading them, joined those who had already
fled below. The rocks became still, the quakings ceased, and now
those Ancient Ones who had been laboring could take breath. And
anger grew within them as they looked upon the work of their evil
kin. Again they sought the Three&mdash;and the Three now knew
what they had done and their pride was humbled. They would not
slay the Shining One themselves, for still they loved it; but
they instructed these others how to undo their work; how also
they might destroy the evil <i>Taithu</i> were it necessary.</p>

<p>"Armed with the wisdom of the Three they went forth&mdash;but
now the Shining One was strong indeed. They could not slay
it!</p>

<p>"Nay, it knew and was prepared; they could not even pass
beyond its Veil nor seal its abode. Ah, strong, strong, mighty of
will, full of craft and cunning had the Shining One become. So
they turned upon their kind who had gone astray and made them
perish, to the last. The Shining One came not to the aid of its
servants&mdash;though they called; for within its will was the
thought that they were of no further use to it; that it would
rest awhile and dance with them&mdash;who had so little of the
power and wisdom of its <i>Taithu</i> and therefore no reins upon
it. And while this was happening black-haired and fair-haired ran
and hid and were but shaking vessels of terror.</p>

<p>"The Ancient Ones took counsel. This was their decision; that
they would go from the gardens before the Silver
Waters&mdash;leaving, since they could not kill it, the Shining
One with its worshipers. They sealed the mouth of the passage
that leads to the Moon Pool Chamber and they changed the face of
the cliff so that none might tell where it had been. But the
passage itself they left open&mdash;having foreknowledge I think,
of a thing that was to come to pass in the far
future&mdash;perhaps it was your journey here, my Larry and
Goodwin&mdash;verily I think so. And they destroyed all the ways
save that which we three trod to the Dweller's abode.</p>

<p>"For the last time they went to the Three&mdash;to pass
sentence upon them. This was the doom&mdash;that here they should
remain, alone, among the <i>Akka</i>, served by them, until that
time dawned when they would have will to destroy the evil they
had created&mdash;and even now&mdash;loved; nor might they seek
death, nor follow their judges until this had come to pass. This
was the doom they put upon the Three for the wickedness that had
sprung from their pride, and they strengthened it with their arts
that it might not be broken.</p>

<p>"Then they passed&mdash;to a far land they had chosen where
the Shining One could not go, beyond the Black Precipices of
Doul, a green land&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ireland!" interrupted Larry, with conviction, "I knew
it."</p>

<p>"Since then time upon time had passed," she went on,
unheeding. "The people called this place Muria after their sunken
land and soon they forgot where had been the passage the
<i>Taithu</i> had sealed. The moon king became the Voice of the
Dweller and always with the Voice is a woman of the moon king's
kin who is its priestess.</p>

<p>"And many have been the journeys upward of the Shining One,
through the Moon Pool&mdash;returning with still others in its
coils.</p>

<p>"And now again has it grown restless, longing for the wider
spaces. It has spoken to Yolara and to Lugur even as it did to
the dead <i>Taithu</i>, promising them dominion. And it has grown
stronger, drawing to itself power to go far on the moon stream
where it will. Thus was it able to seize your friend, Goodwin,
and Olaf's wife and babe&mdash;and many more. Yolara and Lugur
plan to open way to earth face; to depart with their court and
under the Shining One grasp the world!</p>

<p>"And this is the tale the Silent Ones bade me tell
you&mdash;and it is done."</p>

<p>Breathlessly I had listened to the stupendous epic of a
long-lost world. Now I found speech to voice the question ever with
me, the thing that lay as close to my heart as did the welfare of
Larry, indeed the whole object of my quest&mdash;the fate of
Throckmartin and those who had passed with him into the Dweller's
lair; yes, and of Olaf's wife, too.</p>

<p>"Lakla," I said, "the friend who drew me here and those he
loved who went before him&mdash;can we not save them?"</p>

<p>"The Three say no, Goodwin." There was again in her eyes the
pity with which she had looked upon Olaf. "The Shining
One&mdash;<i>feeds</i>&mdash; upon the flame of life itself,
setting in its place its own fires and its own will. Its slaves
are only shells through which it gleams. Death, say the Three, is
the best that can come to them; yet will that be a boon great
indeed."</p>

<p>"But they have souls, <a title= "Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>mavourneen</i></a>," Larry said to her. "And they're
alive still&mdash;in a way. Anyhow, their souls have not gone
from them."</p>

<p>I caught a hope from his words&mdash;sceptic though I
am&mdash;holding that the existence of soul has never been proved
by dependable laboratory methods&mdash;for they recalled to me
that when I had seen Throckmartin, Edith had been close beside
him.</p>

<p>"It was days after his wife was taken, that the Dweller seized
Throckmartin," I cried. "How, if their wills, their life, were
indeed gone, how did they find each other mid all that horde? How
did they come together in the Dweller's lair?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," she answered, slowly. "You say they
loved&mdash;and it is true that love is stronger even than
death!"</p>

<p>"One thing I <i>don't</i> understand"&mdash;this was Larry
again&mdash; "is why a girl like you keeps coming out of the
black-haired crowd; so frequently and one might say, so
regularly, Lakla. Aren't there ever any red-headed boys&mdash;and
if they are what becomes of them?"</p>

<p>"That, Larry, I cannot answer," she said, very frankly. "There
was a pact of some kind; how made or by whom I know not. But for
long the Murians feared the return of the <i>Taithu</i> and
greatly they feared the Three. Even the Shining One feared those
who had created it&mdash;for a time; and not even now is it eager
to face them&mdash;<i>that</i> I know. Nor are Yolara and Lugur
so <i>sure</i>. It may be that the Three commanded it: but how or
why I know not. I only know that it is true&mdash;for here am I
and from where else would I have come?"</p>

<p>"From Ireland," said Larry O'Keefe, promptly. "And that's
where you're going. For 'tis no place for a girl like you to have
been brought up&mdash; Lakla; what with people like frogs, and a
half-god three quarters devil, and red oceans, an' the only Irish
things yourself and the Silent Ones up there, bless their hearts.
It's no place for ye, and by the soul of St. Patrick, it's out of
it soon ye'll be gettin'!"</p>

<p>Larry! Larry! If it had but been true&mdash;and I could see
Lakla and you beside me now!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap31" id="chap31"></a>31. &mdash; LARRY AND THE
FROG-MEN</h2>

<p class="first">Long had been her tale in the telling, and too
long, perhaps, have I been in the repeating&mdash;but not every
day are the mists rolled away to reveal undreamed secrets of
earth-youth. And I have set it down here, adding nothing, taking
nothing from it; translating liberally, it is true, but
constantly striving, while putting it into idea-forms and
phraseology to be readily understood by my readers, to keep
accurately to the spirit. And this, I must repeat, I have done
throughout my narrative, wherever it has been necessary to record
conversation with the Murians.</p>

<p>Rising, I found I was painfully stiff&mdash;as muscle-bound as
though I had actually trudged many miles. Larry, imitating me,
gave an involuntary groan.</p>

<p>"Faith, <a title="Irish: 'my darling'"><i>mavourneen</i></a>,"
he said to Lakla, relapsing unconsciously into English, "your
roads would never wear out shoe-leather, but they've got their
kick, just the same!"</p>

<p>She understood our plight, if not his words; gave a soft
little cry of mingled pity and self-reproach; forced us back upon
the cushions.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm sorry!" mourned Lakla, leaning over us. "I had
forgotten &mdash;for those new to it the way is a weary one,
indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>She ran to the doorway, whistled a clear high note down the
passage. Through the hangings came two of the frog-men. She spoke
to them rapidly. They crouched toward us, what certainly was
meant for an amiable grin wrinkling the grotesque muzzles, baring
the glistening rows of needle-teeth. And while I watched them
with the fascination that they never lost for me, the monsters
calmly swung one arm around our knees, lifted us up like babies
&mdash;and as calmly started to walk away with us!</p>

<p>"Put me down! Put me down, I say!" The O'Keefe's voice was
both outraged and angry; squinting around I saw him struggling
violently to get to his feet. The <i>Akka</i> only held him
tighter, booming comfortingly, peering down into his flushed face
inquiringly.</p>

<p>"But, Larry&mdash;darlin'!"&mdash;Lakla's tones
were&mdash;well, maternally surprised&mdash;"you're stiff and
sore, and Kra can carry you quite easily."</p>

<p>"I <i>won't</i> be carried!" sputtered the O'Keefe. "Damn it,
Goodwin, there are such things as the unities even here, an' for
a lieutenant of the Royal Air Force to be picked up an' carted
around like a&mdash;like a bundle of rags&mdash;it's not
discipline! Put me down, ye <i>omadhaun</i>, or I'll poke ye in
the snout!" he shouted to his bearer&mdash;who only boomed
gently, and stared at the handmaiden, plainly for further
instructions.</p>

<p>"But, Larry&mdash;dear!"&mdash;Lakla was plainly
distressed&mdash; "it will <i>hurt</i> you to walk; and I don't
<i>want</i> you to hurt, Larry &mdash;darlin'!"</p>

<p>"Holy shade of St. Patrick!" moaned Larry; again he made a
mighty effort to tear himself from the frog-man's grip; gave up
with a groan. "Listen, <a title= "Irish: a term of endearment;
'darling', 'sweet one'"><i>alanna!"</i></a> he said plaintively.
"When we get to Ireland, you and I, we won't have anybody to pick
us up and carry us about every time we get a bit tired. And it's
getting me in bad habits you are!"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>yes</i>, we will, Larry!" cried the handmaiden,
"because many, oh, many, of my <i>Akka</i> will go with us!"</p>

<p>"Will you tell this&mdash;BOOB!&mdash;to put me down!" gritted
the now thoroughly aroused O'Keefe. I couldn't help laughing; he
glared at me.</p>

<p>"Bo-oo-ob?" exclaimed Lakla.</p>

<p>"Yes, boo-oo-ob!" said O'Keefe, "an' I have no desire to
explain the word in my present position, light of my soul!"</p>

<p>The handmaiden sighed, plainly dejected. But she spoke again
to the <i>Akka</i>, who gently lowered the O'Keefe to the
floor.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," she said hopelessly, "if you want to
walk, why, of course, you shall, Larry." She turned to me.</p>

<p>"Do you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I do not," I said firmly.</p>

<p>"Well, then," murmured Lakla, "go you, Larry and Goodwin, with
Kra and Gulk, and let them minister to you. After, sleep a
little&mdash;for not soon will Rador and Olaf return. And let me
feel your lips before you go, Larry&mdash;darlin'!" She covered
his eyes caressingly with her soft little palms; pushed him
away.</p>

<p>"Now go," said Lakla, "and rest!"</p>

<p>Unashamed I lay back against the horny chest of Gulk; and with
a smile noticed that Larry, even if he had rebelled at being
carried, did not disdain the support of Kra's shining,
black-scaled arm which, slipping around his waist, half-lifted
him along.</p>

<p>They parted a hanging and dropped us softly down beside a
little pool, sparkling with the clear water that had heretofore
been brought us in the wide basins. Then they began to undress
us. And at this point the O'Keefe gave up.</p>

<p>"Whatever they're going to do we can't stop 'em, Doc!" he
moaned. "Anyway, I feel as though I've been pulled through a
knot-hole, and I don't care &mdash;I don't care&mdash;as the song
says."</p>

<p>When we were stripped we were lowered gently into the water.
But not long did the <i>Akka</i> let us splash about the shallow
basin. They lifted us out, and from jars began deftly to anoint
and rub us with aromatic unguents.</p>

<p>I think that in all the medley of grotesque, of tragic, of
baffling, strange and perilous experiences in that underground
world none was more bizarre than this&mdash;valeting. I began to
laugh, Larry joined me, and then Kra and Gulk joined in our
merriment with deep batrachian cachinnations and gruntings. Then,
having finished appareling us and still chuckling, the two
touched our arms and led us out, into a room whose circular sides
were ringed with soft divans. Still smiling, I sank at once into
sleep.</p>

<p>How long I slumbered I do not know. A low and thunderous
booming coming through the deep window slit, reverberated through
the room and awakened me. Larry yawned; arose briskly.</p>

<p>"Sounds as though the bass drums of every jazz band in New
York were serenading us!" he observed. Simultaneously we sprang
to the window; peered through.</p>

<p>We were a little above the level of the bridge, and its full
length was plain before us. Thousands upon thousands of the
<i>Akka</i> were crowding upon it, and far away other hordes
filled like a glittering thicket both sides of the cavern ledge's
crescent strand. On black scale and orange scale the crimson
light fell, picking them off in little flickering points.</p>

<p>Upon the platform from which sprang the smaller span over the
abyss were Lakla, Olaf, and Rador; the handmaiden clearly acting
as interpreter between them and the giant she had called Nak, the
Frog King.</p>

<p>"Come on!" shouted Larry.</p>

<p>Out of the open portal we ran; over the World Heart
Bridge&mdash;and straight into the group.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Lakla, "I didn't want you to wake up so soon,
Larry&mdash; darlin'!"</p>

<p>"See here, <a title="Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>mavourneen!"</i></a> Indignation thrilled in the
Irishman's voice. "I'm not going to be done up with baby-ribbons
and laid away in a cradle for safe-keeping while a fight is on;
don't think it. Why didn't you call me?"</p>

<p>"You needed rest!" There was indomitable determination in the
handmaiden's tones, the eternal maternal shining defiant from her
eyes. "You were tired and you hurt! You shouldn't have got
up!"</p>

<p>"Needed the rest!" groaned Larry. "Look here, Lakla, what do
you think I am?"</p>

<p>"You're all I have," said that maiden firmly, "and I'm going
to take care of you, Larry&mdash;darlin'! Don't you ever think
anything else."</p>

<p>"Well, pulse of my heart, considering my delicate health and
general fragility, would it hurt me, do you think, to be told
what's going on?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all, Larry!" answered the handmaiden serenely. "Yolara
went through the Portal. She was very, <i>very</i>
angry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She was all the devil's woman that she is!" rumbled Olaf.</p>

<p>"Rador met the messenger," went on the Golden Girl calmly.
"The <i>ladala</i> are ready to rise when Lugur and Yolara lead
their hosts against us. They will strike at those left behind.
And in the meantime we shall have disposed my <i>Akka</i> to meet
Yolara's men. And on that disposal we must all take counsel, you,
Larry, and Rador, Olaf and Goodwin and Nak, the ruler of the
<i>Akka</i>."</p>

<p>"Did the messenger give any idea when Yolara expects to make
her little call?" asked Larry.</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered. "They prepare, and we may expect them
in&mdash;" She gave the equivalent of about thirty-six hours of
our time.</p>

<p>"But, Lakla," I said, the doubt that I had long been holding
finding voice, "should the Shining One come&mdash;with its
slaves&mdash;are the Three strong enough to cope with it?"</p>

<p>There was troubled doubt in her own eyes.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she said at last, frankly. "You have heard
their story. What they promise is that they will help. I do not
know&mdash;any more than do you, Goodwin!"</p>

<p>I looked up at the dome beneath which I knew the dread Trinity
stared forth; even down upon us. And despite the awe, the
assurance, I had felt when I stood before them I, too,
doubted.</p>

<p>"Well," said Larry, "you and I, uncle," he turned to Rador,
"and Olaf here had better decide just what part of the battle
we'll lead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lead!" the handmaiden was appalled. "<i>You</i> lead, Larry?
Why you are to stay with Goodwin and with me&mdash;up there,
there we can watch."</p>

<p>"Heart's beloved," O'Keefe was stern indeed. "A thousand times
I've looked Death straight in the face, peered into his eyes.
Yes, and with ten thousand feet of space under me an' bursting
shells tickling the ribs of the boat I was in. An' d'ye think
I'll sit now on the grandstand an' watch while a game like this
is being pulled? Ye don't know your future husband, soul of my
delight!"</p>

<p>And so we started toward the golden opening, squads of the
frog-men following us soldierly and disappearing about the huge
structure. Nor did we stop until we came to the handmaiden's
boudoir. There we seated ourselves.</p>

<p>"Now," said Larry, "two things I want to know. First&mdash;how
many can Yolara muster against us; second, how many of these
<i>Akka</i> have we to meet them?"</p>

<p>Rador gave our equivalent for eighty thousand men as the force
Yolara could muster without stripping her city. Against this
force, it appeared, we could count, roughly, upon two hundred
thousand of the <i>Akka</i>.</p>

<p>"And they're some fighters!" exclaimed Larry. "Hell, with odds
like that what're you worrying about? It's over before it's
begun."</p>

<p>"But, <i>Larree</i>," objected Rador to this, "you forget that
the nobles will have the <i>Keth</i>&mdash;and other things; also
that the soldiers have fought against the <i>Akka</i> before and
will be shielded very well from their spears and clubs&mdash;and
that their blades and javelins can bite through the scales of
Nak's warriors. They have many things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uncle," interjected O'Keefe, "one thing they have is your
nerve. Why, we're more than two to one. And take it from
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Without warning dropped the tragedy!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap32" id="chap32"></a>32. &mdash; "YOUR LOVE; YOUR
LIVES; YOUR SOULS!"</h2>

<p class="first">Lakla had taken no part in the talk since we had
reached her bower. She had seated herself close to the O'Keefe.
Glancing at her I had seen steal over her face that brooding,
listening look that was hers whenever in that mysterious
communion with the Three. It vanished; swiftly she arose;
interrupted the Irishman without ceremony.</p>

<p>"Larry darlin'," said the handmaiden. "The Silent Ones summon
us!"</p>

<p>"When do we go?" I asked; Larry's face grew bright with
interest.</p>

<p>"The time is now," she said&mdash;and hesitated. "Larry dear,
put your arms about me," she faltered, "for there is something
cold that catches at my heart&mdash;and I am afraid."</p>

<p>At his exclamation she gathered herself together; gave a shaky
little laugh.</p>

<p>"It's because I love you so that fear has power to plague me,"
she told him.</p>

<p>Without another word he bent and kissed her; in silence we
passed on, his arm still about her girdled waist, golden head and
black close together. Soon we stood before the crimson slab that
was the door to the sanctuary of the Silent Ones. She poised
uncertainly before it; then with a defiant arching of the proud
little head that sent all the bronze-flecked curls flying, she
pressed. It slipped aside and once more the opalescence gushed
out, flooding all about us.</p>

<p>Dazzled as before, I followed through the lambent cascades
pouring from the high, carved walls; paused, and my eyes
clearing, looked up&mdash; straight into the faces of the Three.
The angled orbs centered upon the handmaiden; softened as I had
seen them do when first we had faced them. She smiled up; seemed
to listen.</p>

<p>"Come closer," she commanded, "close to the feet of the Silent
Ones."</p>

<p>We moved, pausing at the very base of the dais. The sparkling
mists thinned; the great heads bent slightly over us; through the
veils I caught a glimpse of huge columnar necks, enormous
shoulders covered with draperies as of pale-blue fire.</p>

<p>I came back to attention with a start, for Lakla was answering
a question only heard by her, and, answering it aloud, I
perceived for our benefit; for whatever was the mode of
communication between those whose handmaiden she was, and her, it
was clearly independent of speech.</p>

<p>"He has been told," she said, "even as you commanded."</p>

<p>Did I see a shadow of pain flit across the flickering eyes?
Wondering, I glanced at Lakla's face and there was a dawn of
foreboding and bewilderment. For a little she held her listening
attitude; then the gaze of the Three left her; focused upon the
O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"Thus speak the Silent Ones&mdash;through Lakla, their
handmaiden," the golden voice was like low trumpet notes. "At the
threshold of doom is that world of yours above. Yea, even the
doom, Goodwin, that ye dreamed and the shadow of which, looking
into your mind they see, say the Three. For not upon earth and
never upon earth can man find means to destroy the Shining
One."</p>

<p>She listened again&mdash;and the foreboding deepened to an
amazed fear.</p>

<p>"They say, the Silent Ones," she went on, "that they know not
whether even they have power to destroy. Energies we know nothing
of entered into its shaping and are part of it; and still other
energies it has gathered to itself"&mdash;she paused; a shadow of
puzzlement crept into her voice "and other energies still, forces
that ye <i>do</i> know and symbolize by certain
names&mdash;hatred and pride and lust and many others which are
forces real as that hidden in the <i>Keth</i>; and among
them&mdash;fear, which weakens all those others&mdash;" Again she
paused.</p>

<p>"But within it is nothing of that greatest of all, that which
can make powerless all the evil others, that which we
call&mdash;love," she ended softly.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be the one to put a little more <i>fear</i> in
the beast," whispered Larry to me, grimly in our own English. The
three weird heads bent, ever so slightly&mdash;and I gasped, and
Larry grew a little white as Lakla nodded&mdash;</p>

<p>"They say, Larry," she said, "that there you touch one side of
the heart of the matter&mdash;for it is through the way of fear
the Silent Ones hope to strike at the very life of the Shining
One!"</p>

<p>The visage Larry turned to me was eloquent of wonder; and mine
reflected it&mdash;for what <i>really</i> were this Three to whom
our minds were but open pages, so easily read? Not long could we
conjecture; Lakla broke the little silence.</p>

<p>"This, they say, is what is to happen. First will come upon us
Lugur and Yolara with all their host. Because of fear the Shining
One will lurk behind within its lair; for despite all, the
Dweller <i>does</i> dread the Three, and only them. With this
host the Voice and the priestess will strive to conquer. And if
they do, then will they be strong enough, too, to destroy us all.
For if they take the abode they banish from the Dweller all fear
and sound the end of the Three.</p>

<p>"Then will the Shining One be all free indeed; free to go out
into the world, free to do there as it wills!</p>

<p>"But if they do not conquer&mdash;and the Shining One comes
not to their aid, abandoning them even as it abandoned its own
<i>Taithu</i>&mdash;then will the Three be loosed from a part of
their doom, and they will go through the Portal, seek the Shining
One beyond the Veil, and, piercing it through fear's opening,
destroy it."</p>

<p>"That's quite clear," murmured the O'Keefe in my ear. "Weaken
the morale &mdash;then smash. I've seen it happen a dozen times
in Europe. While they've got their nerve there's not a thing you
can do; get their nerve &mdash;and not a thing can they do. And
yet in both cases they're the same men."</p>

<p>Lakla had been listening again. She turned, thrust out hands
to Larry, a wild hope in her eyes&mdash;and yet a hope half
shamed.</p>

<p>"They say," she cried, "that they give us choice. Remembering
that your world doom hangs in the balance, we have
choice&mdash;choice to stay and help fight Yolara's
armies&mdash;and they say they look not lightly on that help. Or
choice to go&mdash;and if so be you choose the latter, then will
they show another way that leads into your world!"</p>

<p>A flush had crept over the O'Keefe's face as she was speaking.
He took her hands and looked long into the golden eyes; glancing
up I saw the Trinity were watching them
intently&mdash;imperturbably.</p>

<p>"What do you say, <a title="Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>mavourneen?"</i></a> asked Larry gently. The
handmaiden hung her head; trembled.</p>

<p>"Your words shall be mine, O one I love," she whispered. "So
going or staying, I am beside you."</p>

<p>"And you, Goodwin?" he turned to me. I shrugged my
shoulders&mdash;after all I had no one to care.</p>

<p>"It's up to you, Larry," I remarked, deliberately choosing his
own phraseology.</p>

<p>The O'Keefe straightened, squared his shoulders, gazed
straight into the flame-flickering eyes.</p>

<p>"We stick!" he said briefly.</p>

<p>Shamefacedly I recall now that at the time I thought this
colloquialism not only irreverent, but in somewhat bad taste. I
am glad to say I was alone in that bit of weakness. The face that
Lakla turned to Larry was radiant with love, and although the
shamed hope had vanished from the sweet eyes, they were shining
with adoring pride. And the marble visages of the Three softened,
and the little flames died down.</p>

<p>"Wait," said Lakla, "there is one other thing they say we must
answer before they will hold us to that
promise&mdash;wait&mdash;"</p>

<p>She listened, and then her face grew white&mdash;white as
those of the Three themselves; the glorious eyes widened, stark
terror filling them; the whole lithe body of her shook like a
reed in the wind.</p>

<p>"Not that!" she cried out to the Three. "Oh, not that! Not
Larry&mdash; let me go even as you will&mdash;but not him!" She
threw up frantic hands to the woman-being of the Trinity. "Let
<i>me</i> bear it alone," she wailed. "Alone&mdash;mother!
Mother!"</p>

<p>The Three bent their heads toward her, their faces pitiful,
and from the eyes of the woman One rolled&mdash;tears! Larry
leaped to Lakla's side.</p>

<p><a title="Irish: 'my darling'"><i>Mavourneen!"</i></a> he
cried. "Sweetheart, what have they said to you?"</p>

<p>He glared up at the Silent Ones, his hand twitching toward the
high-hung pistol holster.</p>

<p>The handmaiden swung to him; threw white arms around his neck;
held her head upon his heart until her sobbing ceased.</p>

<p>"This they&mdash;say&mdash;the Silent Ones," she gasped and
then all the courage of her came back. "O heart of mine!" she
whispered to Larry, gazing deep into his eyes, his anxious face
cupped between her white palms. "This they say&mdash;that should
the Shining One come to succor Yolara and Lugur, should it
conquer its fear&mdash;and&mdash;do this&mdash;then is there but
one way left to destroy it&mdash;and to save your world."</p>

<p>She swayed; he gripped her tightly.</p>

<p>"But one way&mdash;you and I must go&mdash;together&mdash;into
its embrace! Yea, we must pass within it&mdash;loving each other,
loving the world, realizing to the full all that we sacrifice and
sacrificing all, our love, our lives, perhaps even that you call
soul, O loved one; must give ourselves <i>all</i> to the Shining
One&mdash;gladly, freely, our love for each other flaming high
within us&mdash;that this curse shall pass away! For if we do
this, pledge the Three, then shall that power of love we carry
into it weaken for a time all that evil which the Shining One has
become &mdash;and in that time the Three can strike and
slay!"</p>

<p>The blood rushed from my heart; scientist that I am,
essentially, my reason rejected any such solution as this of the
activities of the Dweller. Was it not, the thought flashed, a
propitiation by the Three out of their own weakness&mdash;and as
it flashed I looked up to see their eyes, full of sorrow, on
mine&mdash;and knew they read the thought. Then into the whirling
vortex of my mind came steadying reflections&mdash;of history
changed by the power of hate, of passion, of ambition, and most
of all, by love. Was there not actual dynamic energy in these
things&mdash;was there not a Son of Man who hung upon a cross on
Calvary?</p>

<p>"Dear love o' mine," said the O'Keefe quietly, "is it in your
heart to say <i>yes</i> to this?"</p>

<p>"Larry," she spoke low, "what is in your heart is in mine; but
I did so want to go with you, to live with you&mdash;to&mdash;to
bear you children, Larry&mdash;and to see the sun."</p>

<p>My eyes were wet; dimly through them I saw his gaze on me.</p>

<p>"If the world <i>is</i> at stake," he whispered, "why of
course there's only one thing to do. God knows I never was afraid
when I was fighting up there&mdash;and many a better man than me
has gone West with shell and bullet for the same idea; but these
things aren't shell and bullet&mdash; but I hadn't Lakla
then&mdash;and it's the damned <i>doubt</i> I have behind it
all."</p>

<p>He turned to the Three&mdash;and did I in their poise sense a
rigidity, an anxiety that sat upon them as alienly as would
divinity upon men?</p>

<p>"Tell me this, Silent Ones," he cried. "If we do this, Lakla
and I, is it <i>sure</i> you are that you can slay
the&mdash;Thing, and save my world? Is it <i>sure</i> you
are?"</p>

<p>For the first and the last time, I heard the voice of the
Silent Ones. It was the man-being at the right who spoke.</p>

<p>"We are sure," the tones rolled out like deepest organ notes,
shaking, vibrating, assailing the ears as strangely as their
appearance struck the eyes. Another moment the O'Keefe stared at
them. Once more he squared his shoulders; lifted Lakla's chin and
smiled into her eyes.</p>

<p>"We stick!" he said again, nodding to the Three.</p>

<p>Over the visages of the Trinity fell benignity that
was&mdash;awesome; the tiny flames in the jet orbs vanished,
leaving them wells in which brimmed serenity, hope&mdash;an
extraordinary joyfulness. The woman sat upright, tender gaze
fixed upon the man and girl. Her great shoulders raised as though
she had lifted her arms and had drawn to her those others. The
three faces pressed together for a fleeting moment; raised again.
The woman bent forward &mdash;and as she did so, Lakla and Larry,
as though drawn by some outer force, were swept upon the
dais.</p>

<p>Out from the sparkling mist stretched two hands, enormously
long, six-fingered, thumbless, a faint tracery of golden scales
upon their white backs, utterly unhuman and still in some strange
way beautiful, radiating power and &mdash;all womanly!</p>

<p>They stretched forth; they touched the bent heads of Lakla and
the O'Keefe; caressed them, drew them together, softly stroked
them&mdash; lovingly, with more than a touch of benediction. And
withdrew!</p>

<p>The sparkling mists rolled up once more, hiding the Silent
Ones. As silently as once before we had gone we passed out of the
place of light, beyond the crimson stone, back to the
handmaiden's chamber.</p>

<p>Only once on our way did Larry speak.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, darlin'," he said to her, "it's a long way yet
before the finish. An' are you thinking that Lugur and Yolara are
going to pull this thing off? Are you?"</p>

<p>The handmaiden only looked at him, eyes love and sorrow
filled.</p>

<p>"They are!" said Larry. "They are! Like HELL they are!"</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap33" id="chap33"></a>33. &mdash; THE MEETING OF
TITANS</h2>

<p class="first">It is not my intention, nor is it possible no
matter how interesting to me, to set down <i>ad seriatim</i> the
happenings of the next twelve hours. But a few will not be denied
recital.</p>

<p>O'Keefe regained cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"After all, Doc," he said to me, "it's a beautiful scrap we're
going to have. At the worst the worst is no more than the <a
title= "an elf in Irish folklore who can reveal hidden treasure
to those who catch them"> <i>leprechaun</i></a> warned about. I
would have told the Taitha De about the <a title= "a female
spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing, a
death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a> raid he promised me; but I
was a bit taken off my feet at the time. The old girl an' all the
clan'll be along, said the little green man, an' I bet the Three
will be damned glad of it, take it from me."</p>

<p>Lakla, shining-eyed and half fearful too:</p>

<p>"I have other tidings that I am afraid will please you little,
Larry &mdash;darlin'. The Silent Ones say that you must not go
into battle yourself. You must stay here with me, and with
Goodwin&mdash;for if&mdash; if&mdash;the Shining One does come,
then must we be here to meet it. And you might not be, you know,
Larry, if you fight," she said, looking shyly up at him from
under the long lashes.</p>

<p>The O'Keefe's jaw dropped.</p>

<p>"That's about the hardest yet," he answered slowly.
"Still&mdash;I see their point; the lamb corralled for the altar
has no right to stray out among the lions," he added grimly.
"Don't worry, sweet," he told her. "As long as I've sat in the
game I'll stick to the rules."</p>

<p>Olaf took fierce joy in the coming fray. "The Norns spin close
to the end of this web," he rumbled. "<i>Ja!</i> And the threads
of Lugur and the <a title="Norwegian and Danish:
'witch'"><i>heks</i></a> woman are between their fingers for the
breaking! Thor will be with me, and I have fashioned me a hammer
in glory of Thor." In his hand was an enormous mace of black
metal, fully five feet long, crowned with a massive head.</p>

<p>I pass to the twelve hours' closing.</p>

<p>At the end of the <i>coria</i> road where the giant fernland
met the edge of the cavern's ruby floor, hundreds of the
<i>Akka</i> were stationed in ambush, armed with their spears
tipped with the rotting death and their nail-studded, metal-headed
clubs. These were to attack when the Murians debauched
from the <i>corials</i>. We had little hope of doing more here
than effect some attrition of Yolara's hosts, for at this place
the captains of the Shining One could wield the <i>Keth</i> and
their other uncanny weapons freely. We had learned, too, that
every forge and artisan had been put to work to make an armour
Marakinoff had devised to withstand the natural battle equipment
of the frog-people&mdash;and both Larry and I had a disquieting
faith in the Russian's ingenuity.</p>

<p>At any rate the numbers against us would be lessened.</p>

<p>Next, under the direction of the frog-king, levies commanded
by subsidiary chieftains had completed rows of rough walls along
the probable route of the Murians through the cavern. These
afforded the <i>Akka</i> a fair protection behind which they
could hurl their darts and spears&mdash;curiously enough they had
never developed the bow as a weapon.</p>

<p>At the opening of the cavern a strong barricade stretched
almost to the two ends of the crescent strand; almost, I say,
because there had not been time to build it entirely across the
mouth.</p>

<p>And from edge to edge of the titanic bridge, from where it
sprang outward at the shore of the Crimson Sea to a hundred feet
away from the golden door of the abode, barrier after barrier was
piled.</p>

<p>Behind the wall defending the mouth of the cavern, waited
other thousands of the <i>Akka</i>. At each end of the unfinished
barricade they were mustered thickly, and at right and left of
the crescent where their forest began, more legions were
assembled to make way up to the ledge as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>Rank upon rank they manned the bridge barriers; they swarmed
over the pinnacles and in the hollows of the island's ragged
outer lip; the domed castle was a hive of them, if I may mix my
metaphors&mdash;and the rocks and gardens that surrounded the
abode glittered with them.</p>

<p>"Now," said the handmaiden, "there's nothing else we can
do&mdash;save wait."</p>

<p>She led us out through her bower and up the little path that
ran to the embrasure.</p>

<p>Through the quiet came a sound, a sighing, a half-mournful
whispering that beat about us and fled away.</p>

<p>"They come!" cried Lakla, the light of battle in her eyes.
Larry drew her to him, raised her in his arms, kissed her.</p>

<p>"A woman!" acclaimed the O'Keefe. "A real woman&mdash;and
mine!"</p>

<p>With the cry of the Portal there was movement among the
<i>Akka</i>, the glint of moving spears, flash of metal-tipped
clubs, rattle of horny spurs, rumblings of battle-cries.</p>

<p>And we waited&mdash;waited it seemed interminably, gaze
fastened upon the low wall across the cavern mouth. Suddenly I
remembered the crystal through which I had peered when the hidden
assassins had crept upon us. Mentioning it to Lakla, she gave a
little cry of vexation, a command to her attendant; and not long
that faithful if unusual lady had returned with a tray of the
glasses. Raising mine, I saw the lines furthest away leap into
sudden activity. Spurred warrior after warrior leaped upon the
barricade and over it. Flashes of intense, green light, mingled
with gleams like lightning strokes of concentrated moon rays,
sprang from behind the wall&mdash;sprang and struck and burned
upon the scales of the batrachians.</p>

<p>"They come!" whispered Lakla.</p>

<p>At the far ends of the crescent a terrific milling had begun.
Here it was plain the <i>Akka</i> were holding. Faintly, for the
distance was great, I could see fresh force upon force rush up
and take the places of those who had fallen.</p>

<p>Over each of these ends, and along the whole line of the
barricade a mist of dancing, diamonded atoms began to rise;
sparking, coruscating points of diamond dust that darted and
danced.</p>

<p>What had once been Lakla's guardians&mdash;dancing now in the
nothingness!</p>

<p>"God, but it's hard to stay here like this!" groaned the
O'Keefe; Olaf's teeth were bared, the lips drawn back in such a
fighting grin as his ancestors berserk on their raven ships must
have borne; Rador was livid with rage; the handmaiden's nostrils
flaring wide, all her wrathful soul in her eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while we looked, the rocky wall which the
<i>Akka</i> had built at the cavern mouth&mdash;was not! It
vanished, as though an unseen, unbelievably gigantic hand had
with the lightning's speed swept it away. And with it vanished,
too, long lines of the great amphibians close behind it.</p>

<p>Then down upon the ledge, dropping into the Crimson Sea,
sending up geysers of ruby spray, dashing on the bridge, crushing
the frog-men, fell a shower of stone, mingled with distorted
shapes and fragments whose scales still flashed meteoric as they
hurled from above.</p>

<p>"That which makes things fall upward," hissed Olaf. "That
which I saw in the garden of Lugur!"</p>

<p>The fiendish agency of destruction which Marakinoff had
revealed to Larry; the force that cut off gravitation and sent
all things within its range racing outward into space!</p>

<p>And now over the debris upon the ledge, striking with long
sword and daggers, here and there a captain flashing the green
ray, moving on in ordered squares, came the soldiers of the
Shining One. Nearer and nearer the verge of the ledge they pushed
Nak's warriors. Leaping upon the dwarfs, smiting them with spear
and club, with teeth and spur, the <i>Akka</i> fought like
devils. Quivering under the ray, they leaped and dragged down and
slew.</p>

<p>Now there was but one long line of the frog-men at the very
edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>And ever the clouds of dancing, diamonded atoms grew thicker
over them all!</p>

<p>That last thin line of the <i>Akka</i> was going; yet they
fought to the last, and none toppled over the lip without at
least one of the armored Murians in his arms.</p>

<p>My gaze dropped to the foot of the cliffs. Stretched along
their length was a wide ribbon of beauty&mdash;a shimmering
multitude of gleaming, pulsing, prismatic moons; glowing, glowing
ever brighter, ever more wondrous &mdash;the gigantic Medusae
globes feasting on dwarf and frog-man alike!</p>

<p>Across the waters, faintly, came a triumphant shouting from
Lugur's and Yolara's men!</p>

<p>Was the ruddy light of the place lessening, growing paler,
changing to a faint rose? There was an exclamation from Larry;
something like hope relaxed the drawn muscles of his face. He
pointed to the aureate dome wherein sat the Three&mdash;and then
I saw!</p>

<p>Out of it, through the long transverse slit through which the
Silent Ones kept their watch on cavern, bridge, and abyss, a
torrent of the opalescent light was pouring. It cascaded like a
waterfall, and as it flowed it spread whirling out, in columns
and eddies, clouds and wisps of misty, curdled coruscations. It
hung like a veil over all the islands, filtering everywhere,
driving back the crimson light as though possessed of
impenetrable substance &mdash;and still it cast not the faintest
shadowing upon our vision.</p>

<p>"Good God!" breathed Larry. "Look!"</p>

<p>The radiance was marching&mdash;<i>marching</i>&mdash;down the
colossal bridge. It moved swiftly, in some unthinkable way
<i>intelligently</i>. It swathed the <i>Akka</i>, and closer,
ever closer it swept toward the approach upon which Yolara's men
had now gained foothold.</p>

<p>From their ranks came flash after flash of the green
ray&mdash;aimed at the abode! But as the light sped and struck
the opalescence it was blotted out! The shimmering mists seemed
to enfold, to dissipate it.</p>

<p>Lakla drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"The Silent Ones forgive me for doubting them," she whispered;
and again hope blossomed on her face even as it did on
Larry's.</p>

<p>The frog-men were gaining. Clothed in the armour of that mist,
they pressed back from the bridge-head the invaders. There was
another prodigious movement at the ends of the crescent, and
racing up, pressing against the dwarfs, came other legions of
Nak's warriors. And re-enforcing those out on the prodigious
arch, the frog-men stationed in the gardens below us poured back
to the castle and out through the open Portal.</p>

<p>"They're licked!" shouted Larry. "They're&mdash;"</p>

<p>So quickly I could not follow the movement his automatic
leaped to his hand&mdash;spoke, once and again and again. Rador
leaped to the head of the little path, sword in hand; Olaf,
shouting and whirling his mace, followed. I strove to get my own
gun quickly.</p>

<p>For up that path were running two-score of Lugur's men, while
from below Lugur's own voice roared.</p>

<p>"Quick! Slay not the handmaiden or her lover! Carry them down.
Quick! But slay the others!"</p>

<p>The handmaiden raced toward Larry, stopped, whistled
shrilly&mdash;again and again. Larry's pistol was empty, but as
the dwarfs rushed upon him I dropped two of them with mine. It
jammed&mdash;I could not use it; I sprang to his side. Rador was
down, struggling in a heap of Lugur's men. Olaf, a Viking of old,
was whirling his great hammer, and striking, striking through
armour, flesh, and bone.</p>

<p>Larry was down, Lakla flew to him. But the Norseman, now
streaming blood from a dozen wounds, caught a glimpse of her
coming, turned, thrust out a mighty hand, sent her reeling back,
and then with his hammer cracked the skulls of those trying to
drag the O'Keefe down the path.</p>

<p>A cry from Lakla&mdash;the dwarfs had seized her, had lifted
her despite her struggles, were carrying her away. One I dropped
with the butt of my useless pistol, and then went down myself
under the rush of another.</p>

<p>Through the clamor I heard a booming of the <i>Akka</i>,
closer, closer; then through it the bellow of Lugur. I made a
mighty effort, swung a hand up, and sunk my fingers in the throat
of the soldier striving to kill me. Writhing over him, my fingers
touched a poniard; I thrust it deep, staggered to my feet.</p>

<p>The O'Keefe, shielding Lakla, was battling with a long sword
against a half dozen of the soldiers. I started toward him, was
struck, and under the impact hurled to the ground. Dizzily I
raised myself&mdash;and leaning upon my elbow, stared and moved
no more. For the dwarfs lay dead, and Larry, holding Lakla
tightly, was staring even as I, and ranged at the head of the
path were the <i>Akka</i>, whose booming advance in obedience to
the handmaiden's call I had heard.</p>

<p>And at what we all stared was Olaf, crimson with his wounds,
and Lugur, in blood-red armour, locked in each other's grip,
struggling, smiting, tearing, kicking, and swaying about the
little space before the embrasure. I crawled over toward the
O'Keefe. He raised his pistol, dropped it.</p>

<p>"Can't hit him without hitting Olaf," he whispered. Lakla
signalled the frog-men; they advanced toward the two&mdash;but
Olaf saw them, broke the red dwarf's hold, sent Lugur reeling a
dozen feet away.</p>

<p>"No!" shouted the Norseman, the ice of his pale-blue eyes
glinting like frozen flames, blood streaming down his face and
dripping from his hands. "No! Lugur is mine! None but me slays
him! Ho, you Lugur&mdash;" and cursed him and Yolara and the
Dweller hideously&mdash;I cannot set those curses down here.</p>

<p>They spurred Lugur. Mad now as the Norseman, the red dwarf
sprang. Olaf struck a blow that would have killed an ordinary
man, but Lugur only grunted, swept in, and seized him about the
waist; one mighty arm began to creep up toward Huldricksson's
throat.</p>

<p>"'Ware, Olaf!" cried O'Keefe; but Olaf did not answer. He
waited until the red dwarf's hand was close to his shoulder; and
then, with an incredibly rapid movement&mdash;once before had I
seen something like it in a wrestling match between
Papuans&mdash;he had twisted Lugur around; twisted him so that
Olaf's right arm lay across the tremendous breast, the left
behind the neck, and Olaf's left leg held the Voice's armored
thighs viselike against his right knee while over that knee lay
the small of the red dwarf's back.</p>

<p>For a second or two the Norseman looked down upon his enemy,
motionless in that paralyzing grip. And
then&mdash;slowly&mdash;he began to break him!</p>

<p>Lakla gave a little cry; made a motion toward the two. But
Larry drew her head down against his breast, hiding her eyes;
then fastened his own upon the pair, white-faced, stern.</p>

<p>Slowly, ever so slowly, proceeded Olaf. Twice Lugur moaned. At
the end he screamed&mdash;horribly. There was a cracking sound,
as of a stout stick snapped.</p>

<p>Huldricksson stooped, silently. He picked up the limp body of
the Voice, not yet dead, for the eyes rolled, the lips strove to
speak; lifted it, walked to the parapet, swung it twice over his
head, and cast it down to the red waters!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a name="chap34" id="chap34"></a>34. &mdash; THE COMING OF
THE SHINING ONE</h2>

<p class="first">The Norseman turned toward us. There was now no
madness in his eyes; only a great weariness. And there was peace
on the once tortured face.</p>

<p>"Helma," he whispered, "I go a little before! Soon you will
come to me &mdash;to me and the <a title= "Norwegian and Danish:
'darling'"><i>yndling</i></a> who will await you &mdash;Helma, <a
title="German: 'my love'"><i>meine Liebe!</i></a>"</p>

<p>Blood gushed from his mouth; he swayed, fell. And thus died
Olaf Huldricksson.</p>

<p>We looked down upon him; nor did Lakla, nor Larry, nor I try
to hide our tears. And as we stood the <i>Akka</i> brought to us
that other mighty fighter, Rador; but in him there was life, and
we attended to him there as best we could.</p>

<p>Then Lakla spoke.</p>

<p>"We will bear him into the castle where we may give him
greater care," she said. "For, lo! the hosts of Yolara have been
beaten back; and on the bridge comes Nak with tidings."</p>

<p>We looked over the parapet. It was even as she had said.
Neither on ledge nor bridge was there trace of living men of
Muria&mdash;only heaps of slain that lay everywhere&mdash;and
thick against the cavern mouth still danced the flashing atoms of
those the green ray had destroyed.</p>

<p>"Over!" exclaimed Larry incredulously. "We live
then&mdash;heart of mine!"</p>

<p>"The Silent Ones recall their veils," she said, pointing to
the dome. Back through the slitted opening the radiance was
streaming; withdrawing from sea and island; marching back over
the bridge with that same ordered, intelligent motion. Behind it
the red light pressed, like skirmishers on the heels of a
retreating army.</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;" faltered the handmaiden as we passed into her
chamber, and doubtful were the eyes she turned upon the
O'Keefe.</p>

<p>"I don't believe," he said, "there's a kick left in
them&mdash;"</p>

<p>What was that sound beating into the chamber faintly, so
faintly? My heart gave a great throb and seemed to stop for an
eternity. What was it&mdash; coming nearer, ever nearer? Now
Lakla and O'Keefe heard it, life ebbing from lips and cheeks.</p>

<p>Nearer, nearer&mdash;a music as of myriads of tiny crystal
bells, tinkling, tinkling&mdash;a storm of pizzicati upon violins
of glass! Nearer, nearer&mdash;not sweetly now, nor luring;
no&mdash;raging, wrathful, sinister beyond words; sweeping on;
nearer&mdash;</p>

<p>The Dweller! The Shining One!</p>

<p>We leaped to the narrow window; peered out, aghast. The bell
notes swept through and about us, a hurricane. The crescent
strand was once more a ferment. Back, back were the <i>Akka</i>
being swept, as though by brooms, tottering on the edge of the
ledge, falling into the waters. Swiftly they were finished; and
where they had fought was an eddying throng clothed in tatters or
naked, swaying, drifting, arms tossing&mdash;like marionettes of
Satan.</p>

<p>The dead-alive! The slaves of the Dweller!</p>

<p>They swayed and tossed, and then, like water racing through an
opened dam, they swept upon the bridge-head. On and on they
pushed, like the bore of a mighty tide. The frog-men strove
against them, clubbing, spearing, tearing them. But even those
worst smitten seemed not to fall. On they pushed, driving
forward, irresistible&mdash;a battering ram of flesh and bone.
They clove the masses of the <i>Akka</i>, pressing them to the
sides of the bridge and over. Through the open gates they forced
them&mdash;for there was no room for the frog-men to stand
against that implacable tide.</p>

<p>Then those of the <i>Akka</i> who were left turned their backs
and ran. We heard the clang of the golden wings of the portal,
and none too soon to keep out the first of the Dweller's dreadful
hordes.</p>

<p>Now upon the cavern ledge and over the whole length of the
bridge there were none but the dead-alive, men and women,
black-polled <i>ladala</i>, sloe-eyed Malays, slant-eyed Chinese,
men of every race that sailed the seas&mdash;milling, turning,
swaying, like leaves caught in a sluggish current.</p>

<p>The bell notes became sharper, more insistent. At the cavern
mouth a radiance began to grow&mdash;a gleaming from which the
atoms of diamond dust seemed to try to flee. As the radiance grew
and the crystal notes rang nearer, every head of that hideous
multitude turned stiffly, slowly toward the right, looking toward
the far bridge end; their eyes fixed and glaring; every face an
inhuman mask of rapture and of horror!</p>

<p>A movement shook them. Those in the center began to stream
back, faster and ever faster, leaving motionless deep ranks on
each side. Back they flowed until from golden doors to cavern
mouth a wide lane stretched, walled on each side by the
dead-alive.</p>

<p>The far radiance became brighter; it gathered itself at the
end of the dreadful lane; it was shot with sparklings and with
pulsings of polychromatic light. The crystal storm was
intolerable, piercing the ears with countless tiny lances;
brighter still the radiance.</p>

<p>From the cavern swirled the Shining One!</p>

<p>The Dweller paused, seemed to scan the island of the Silent
Ones half doubtfully; then slowly, stately, it drifted out upon
the bridge. Closer it drew; behind it glided Yolara at the head
of a company of her dwarfs, and at her side was the hag of the
Council whose face was the withered, shattered echo of her
own.</p>

<p>Slower grew the Dweller's pace as it drew nearer. Did I sense
in it a doubt, an uncertainty? The crystal-tongued, unseen
choristers that accompanied it subtly seemed to reflect the
doubt; their notes were not sure, no longer insistent; rather was
there in them an undertone of hesitancy, of warning! Yet on came
the Shining One until it stood plain beneath us, searching with
those eyes that thrust from and withdrew into unknown spheres,
the golden gateway, the cliff face, the castle's rounded
bulk&mdash;and more intently than any of these, the dome wherein
sat the Three.</p>

<p>Behind it each face of the dead-alive turned toward it, and
those beside it throbbed and gleamed with its luminescence.</p>

<p>Yolara crept close, just beyond the reach of its spirals. She
murmured &mdash;and the Dweller bent toward her, its seven globes
steady in their shining mists, as though listening. It drew erect
once more, resumed its doubtful scrutiny. Yolara's face darkened;
she turned abruptly, spoke to a captain of her guards. A dwarf
raced back between the palisades of dead-alive.</p>

<p>Now the priestess cried out, her voice ringing like a silver
clarion.</p>

<p>"Ye are done, ye Three! The Shining One stands at your door,
demanding entrance. Your beasts are slain and your power is gone.
Who are ye, says the Shining One, to deny it entrance to the
place of its birth?"</p>

<p>"Ye do not answer," she cried again, "yet know we that ye
hear! The Shining One offers these terms: Send forth your
handmaiden and that lying stranger she stole; send them forth to
us&mdash;and perhaps ye may live. But if ye send them not forth,
then shall ye too die&mdash;and soon!"</p>

<p>We waited, silent, even as did Yolara&mdash;and again there
was no answer from the Three.</p>

<p>The priestess laughed; the blue eyes flashed.</p>

<p>"It is ended!" she cried. "If you will not open, needs must we
open for you!"</p>

<p>Over the bridge was marching a long double file of the dwarfs.
They bore a smoothed and handled tree-trunk whose head was
knobbed with a huge ball of metal. Past the priestess, past the
Shining One, they carried it; fifty of them to each side of the
ram; and behind them stepped&mdash;Marakinoff!</p>

<p>Larry awoke to life.</p>

<p>"Now, thank God," he rasped, "I can get that devil,
anyway!"</p>

<p>He drew his pistol, took careful aim. Even as he pressed the
trigger there rang through the abode a tremendous clanging. The
ram was battering at the gates. O'Keefe's bullet went wild. The
Russian must have heard the shot; perhaps the missile was closer
than we knew. He made a swift leap behind the guards; was lost to
sight.</p>

<p>Once more the thunderous clanging rang through the castle.</p>

<p>Lakla drew herself erect; down upon her dropped the listening
aloofness. Gravely she bowed her head.</p>

<p>"It is time, O love of mine." She turned to O'Keefe. "The
Silent Ones say that the way of fear is closed, but the way of
love is open. They call upon us to redeem our promise!"</p>

<p>For a hundred heart-beats they clung to each other, breast to
breast and lip to lip. Below, the clangor was increasing, the
great trunk swinging harder and faster upon the metal gates. Now
Lakla gently loosed the arms of the O'Keefe, and for another
instant those two looked into each other's souls. The handmaiden
smiled tremulously.</p>

<p>"I would it might have been otherwise, Larry darlin'," she
whispered. "But at least&mdash;we pass together, dearest of
mine!"</p>

<p>She leaped to the window.</p>

<p>"Yolara!" the golden voice rang out sweetly. The clanging
ceased. "Draw back your men. We open the Portal and come forth to
you and the Shining One &mdash;Larry and I."</p>

<p>The priestess's silver chimes of laughter rang out, cruel,
mocking.</p>

<p>"Come, then, quickly," she jeered. "For surely both the
Shining One and I yearn for you!" Her malice-laden laughter
chimed high once more. "Keep us not lonely long!" the priestess
mocked.</p>

<p>Larry drew a deep breath, stretched both hands out to me.</p>

<p>"It's good-by, I guess, Doc." His voice was strained. "Good-by
and good luck, old boy. If you get out, and you <i>will</i>, let
the old <i>Dolphin</i> know I'm gone. And carry on, pal&mdash;and
always remember the O'Keefe loved you like a brother."</p>

<p>I squeezed his hands desperately. Then out of my
balance-shaking woe a strange comfort was born.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's not good-by, Larry!" I cried. "The <a title= "a
female spirit in Gaelic folklore believed to presage, by wailing,
a death in a family"> <i>banshee</i></a> has not cried!"</p>

<p>A flash of hope passed over his face; the old reckless grin
shone forth.</p>

<p>"It's so!" he said. "By the Lord, it's so!"</p>

<p>Then Lakla bent toward me, and for the second
time&mdash;kissed me.</p>

<p>"Come!" she said to Larry. Hand in hand they moved away, into
the corridor that led to the door outside of which waited the
Shining One and its priestess.</p>

<p>And unseen by them, wrapped as they were within their love and
sacrifice, I crept softly behind. For I had determined that if
enter the Dweller's embrace they must, they should not go
alone.</p>

<p>They paused before the Golden Portals; the handmaiden pressed
its opening lever; the massive leaves rolled back.</p>

<p>Heads high, proudly, serenely, they passed through and out
upon the hither span. I followed.</p>

<p>On each side of us stood the Dweller's slaves, faces turned
rigidly toward their master. A hundred feet away the Shining One
pulsed and spiraled in its evilly glorious lambency of sparkling
plumes.</p>

<p>Unhesitating, always with that same high serenity, Lakla and
the O'Keefe, hands clasped like little children, drew closer to
that wondrous shape. I could not see their faces, but I saw awe
fall upon those of the watching dwarfs, and into the burning eyes
of Yolara crept a doubt. Closer they drew to the Dweller, and
closer, I following them step by step. The Shining One's whirling
lessened; its tinklings were faint, almost stilled. It seemed to
watch them apprehensively. A silence fell upon us all, a thick
silence, brooding, ominous, palpable. Now the pair were face to
face with the child of the Three&mdash;so near that with one of
its misty tentacles it could have enfolded them.</p>

<p>And the Shining One drew back!</p>

<p>Yes, drew back&mdash;and back with it stepped Yolara, the
doubt in her eyes deepening. Onward paced the handmaiden and the
O'Keefe&mdash;and step by step, as they advanced, the Dweller
withdrew; its bell notes chiming out, puzzled
questioning&mdash;half fearful!</p>

<p>And back it drew, and back until it had reached the very
center of that platform over the abyss in whose depths pulsed the
green fires of earth heart. And there Yolara gripped herself; the
hell that seethed within her soul leaped out of her eyes, a cry,
a shriek of rage, tore from her lips.</p>

<p>As at a signal, the Shining One flamed high; its spirals and
eddying mists swirled madly, the pulsing core of it blazed
radiance. A score of coruscating tentacles swept straight upon
the pair who stood intrepid, unresisting, awaiting its embrace.
And upon me, lurking behind them.</p>

<p>Through me swept a mighty exaltation. It was the end
then&mdash;and I was to meet it with them.</p>

<p>Something drew us back, back with an incredible swiftness, and
yet as gently as a summer breeze sweeps a bit of thistle-down!
Drew us back from those darting misty arms even as they were a
hair-breadth from us! I heard the Dweller's bell notes burst out
ragingly! I heard Yolara scream.</p>

<p>What was that?</p>

<p>Between the three of us and them was a ring of curdled moon
flames, swirling about the Shining One and its priestess,
pressing in upon them, enfolding them!</p>

<p>And within it I glimpsed the faces of the
Three&mdash;implacable, sorrowful, filled with a supernal
power!</p>

<p>Sparks and flashes of white flame darted from the ring,
penetrating the radiant swathings of the Dweller, striking
through its pulsing nucleus, piercing its seven crowning
orbs.</p>

<p>Now the Shining One's radiance began to dim, the seven orbs to
dull; the tiny sparkling filaments that ran from them down into
the Dweller's body snapped, vanished! Through the battling
nebulosities Yolara's face swam forth &mdash;horror-filled,
distorted, inhuman!</p>

<p>The ranks of the dead-alive quivered, moved, writhed, as
though each felt the torment of the Thing that had enslaved them.
The radiance that the Three wielded grew more intense, thicker,
seemed to expand. Within it, suddenly, were scores of flaming
triangles&mdash;scores of eyes like those of the Silent Ones!</p>

<p>And the Shining One's seven little moons of amber, of silver,
of blue and amethyst and green, of rose and white, split,
shattered, were gone! Abruptly the tortured crystal chimings
ceased.</p>

<p>Dulled, all its soul-shaking beauty dead, blotched and
shadowed squalidly, its gleaming plumes tarnished, its dancing
spirals stripped from it, that which had been the Shining One
wrapped itself about Yolara&mdash;wrapped and drew her into
itself; writhed, swayed, and hurled itself over the edge of the
bridge&mdash;down, down into the green fires of the unfathomable
abyss &mdash;with its priestess still enfolded in its coils!</p>

<p>From the dwarfs who had watched that terror came screams of
panic fear. They turned and ran, racing frantically over the
bridge toward the cavern mouth.</p>

<p>The serried ranks of the dead-alive trembled, shook. Then from
their faces tied the horror of wedded ecstasy and anguish. Peace,
utter peace, followed in its wake.</p>

<p>And as fields of wheat are bent and fall beneath the wind,
they fell. No longer dead-alive, now all of the blessed dead,
freed from their dreadful slavery!</p>

<p>Abruptly from the sparkling mists the cloud of eyes was gone.
Faintly revealed in them were only the heads of the Silent Ones.
And they drew before us; were before us! No flames now in their
ebon eyes&mdash;for the flickering fires were quenched in great
tears, streaming down the marble white faces. They bent toward
us, over us; their radiance enfolded us. My eyes darkened. I
could not see. I felt a tender hand upon my head&mdash;and panic
and frozen dread and nightmare web that held me fled.</p>

<p>Then they, too, were gone.</p>

<p>Upon Larry's breast the handmaiden was sobbing&mdash;sobbing
out her heart&mdash;but this time with the joy of one who is
swept up from the very threshold of hell into paradise.</p> <hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap35" id="chap35"></a>35. &mdash;
"LARRY&mdash;FAREWELL!"</h2>

<p class="first">"My heart, Larry&mdash;" It was the handmaiden's
murmur. "My heart feels like a bird that is flying from a nest of
sorrow."</p>

<p>We were pacing down the length of the bridge, guards of the
<i>Akka</i>beside us, others following with those companies of
<i>ladala</i> that had rushed to aid us; in front of us the
bandaged Rador swung gently within a litter; beside him, in
another, lay Nak, the frog-king&mdash;much less of him than there
had been before the battle began, but living.</p>

<p>Hours had passed since the terror I have just related. My
first task had been to search for Throckmartin and his wife among
the fallen multitudes strewn thick as autumn leaves along the
flying arch of stone, over the cavern ledge, and back, back as
far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>At last, Lakla and Larry helping, we found them. They lay
close to the bridge-end, not parted&mdash;locked tight in each
other's arms, pallid face to face, her hair streaming over his
breast! As though when that unearthly life the Dweller had set
within them passed away, their own had come back for one fleeting
instant&mdash;and they had known each other, and clasped before
kindly death had taken them.</p>

<p>"Love is stronger than all things." The handmaiden was weeping
softly. "Love never left them. Love was stronger than the Shining
One. And when its evil fled, love went with them&mdash;wherever
souls go."</p>

<p>Of Stanton and Thora there was no trace; nor, after our
discovery of those other two, did I care to look more. They were
dead&mdash;and they were free.</p>

<p>We buried Throckmartin and Edith beside Olaf in Lakla's bower.
But before the body of my old friend was placed within the grave
I gave it a careful and sorrowful examination. The skin was firm
and smooth, but cold; not the cold of death, but with a chill
that set my touching fingers tingling unpleasantly. The body was
bloodless; the course of veins and arteries marked by faintly
indented white furrows, as though their walls had long collapsed.
Lips, mouth, even the tongue, was paper white. There was no sign
of dissolution as we know it; no shadow or stain upon the marble
surface. Whatever the force that, streaming from the Dweller or
impregnating its lair, had energized the dead-alive, it was
barrier against putrescence of any kind; that at least was
certain.</p>

<p>But it was not barrier against the poison of the Medusae, for,
our sad task done, and looking down upon the waters, I saw the
pale forms of the Dweller's hordes dissolving, vanishing into the
shifting glories of the gigantic moons sailing down upon them
from every quarter of the Sea of Crimson.</p>

<p>While the frog-men, those late levies from the farthest
forests, were clearing bridge and ledge of cavern of the litter
of the dead, we listened to a leader of the <i>ladala</i>. They
had risen, even as the messenger had promised Rador. Fierce had
been the struggle in the gardened city by the silver waters with
those Lugur and Yolara had left behind to garrison it. Deadly had
been the slaughter of the fair-haired, reaping the harvest of
hatred they had been sowing so long. Not without a pang of regret
did I think of the beautiful, gaily malicious elfin women
destroyed&mdash;evil though they may have been.</p>

<p>The ancient city of Lara was a charnel. Of all the rulers not
two-score had escaped, and these into regions of peril which to
describe as sanctuary would be mockery. Nor had the <i>ladala</i>
fared so well. Of all the men and women, for women as well as men
had taken their part in the swift war, not more than a tenth
remained alive.</p>

<p>And the dancing motes of light in the silver air were thick,
thick&mdash; they whispered.</p>

<p>They told us of the Shining One rushing through the Veil,
cometlike, its hosts streaming behind it, raging with it, in
ranks that seemed interminable!</p>

<p>Of the massacre of the priests and priestesses in the
Cyclopean temple; of the flashing forth of the summoning lights
by unseen hands&mdash;followed by the tearing of the rainbow
curtain, by colossal shatterings of the radiant cliffs; the
vanishing behind their debris of all trace of entrance to the
haunted place wherein the hordes of the Shining One had
slaved&mdash;the sealing of the lair!</p>

<p>Then, when the tempest of hate had ended in seething Lara,
how, thrilled with victory, armed with the weapons of those they
had slain, they had lifted the Shadow, passed through the Portal,
met and slaughtered the fleeing remnants of Yolara's
men&mdash;only to find the tempest stilled here, too.</p>

<p>But of Marakinoff they had seen nothing! Had the Russian
escaped, I wondered, or was he lying out there among the
dead?</p>

<p>But now the <i>ladala</i> were calling upon Lakla to come with
them, to govern them.</p>

<p>"I don't want to, Larry darlin'," she told him. "I want to go
out with you to Ireland. But for a time&mdash;I think the Three
would have us remain and set that place in order."</p>

<p>The O'Keefe was bothered about something else than the
government of Muria.</p>

<p>"If they've killed off all the priests, who's to marry us,
heart of mine?" he worried. "None of those Siya and Siyana rites,
no matter what," he added hastily.</p>

<p>"Marry!" cried the handmaiden incredulously. "Marry us? Why,
Larry dear, we <i>are</i> married!"</p>

<p>The O'Keefe's astonishment was complete; his jaw dropped;
collapse seemed imminent.</p>

<p>"We are?" he gasped. "When?" he stammered fatuously.</p>

<p>"Why, when the Mother drew us together before her; when she
put her hands on our heads after we had made the promise! Didn't
you understand that?" asked the handmaiden wonderingly.</p>

<p>He looked at her, into the purity of the clear golden eyes,
into the purity of the soul that gazed out of them; all his own
great love transfiguring his keen face.</p>

<p>"An' is that enough for you, <a title= "Irish: 'my
darling'"><i>mavourneen?"</i></a> he whispered humbly.</p>

<p>"Enough?" The handmaiden's puzzlement was complete, profound.
"Enough? Larry darlin', what <i>more</i> could we ask?"</p>

<p>He drew a deep breath, clasped her close.</p>

<p>"Kiss the bride, Doc!" cried the O'Keefe. And for the third
and, soul's sorrow! the last time, Lakla dimpling and blushing, I
thrilled to the touch of her soft, sweet lips.</p>

<p>Quickly were our preparations for departure made. Rador,
conscious, his immense vitality conquering fast his wounds, was
to be borne ahead of us. And when all was done, Lakla, Larry, and
I made our way up to the scarlet stone that was the doorway to
the chamber of the Three. We knew, of course, that they had gone,
following, no doubt, those whose eyes I had seen in the curdled
mists, and who, coming to the aid of the Three at last from
whatever mysterious place that was their home, had thrown their
strength with them against the Shining One. Nor were we wrong.
When the great slab rolled away, no torrents of opalescence came
rushing out upon us. The vast dome was dim, tenantless; its
curved walls that had cascaded Light shone now but faintly; the
dais was empty; its wall of moon-flame radiance gone.</p>

<p>A little time we stood, heads bent, reverent, our hearts
filled with gratitude and love&mdash;yes, and with pity for that
strange trinity so alien to us and yet so near; children even as
we, though so unlike us, of our same Mother Earth.</p>

<p>And what I wondered had been the secret of that promise they
had wrung from their handmaiden and from Larry. And whence, if
what the Three had said had been all true&mdash;whence had come
their power to avert the sacrifice at the very verge of its
consummation?</p>

<p>"Love is stronger than all things!" had said Lakla.</p>

<p>Was it that they had needed, must have, the force which dwells
within love, within willing sacrifice, to strengthen their own
power and to enable them to destroy the evil, glorious Thing so
long shielded by their own love? Did the thought of sacrifice,
the will toward abnegation, have to be as strong as the eternals,
unshaken by faintest thrill of hope, before the Three could make
of it their key to unlock the Dweller's guard and strike through
at its life?</p>

<p>Here was a mystery&mdash;a mystery indeed! Lakla softly closed
the crimson stone. The mystery of the red dwarf's appearance was
explained when we discovered a half-dozen of the water
<i>coria</i> moored in a small cove not far from where the
<i>Sekta</i> flashed their heads of living bloom. The dwarfs had
borne the shallops with them, and from somewhere beyond the
cavern ledge had launched them unperceived; stealing up to the
farther side of the island and risking all in one bold stroke.
Well, Lugur, no matter what he held of wickedness, held also high
courage.</p>

<p>The cavern was paved with the dead-alive, the <i>Akka</i>
carrying them out by the hundreds, casting them into the waters.
Through the lane down which the Dweller had passed we went as
quickly as we could, coming at last to the space where the
<i>coria</i> waited. And not long after we swung past where the
shadow had hung and hovered over the shining depths of the
Midnight Pool.</p>

<p>Upon Lakla's insistence we passed on to the palace of Lugur,
not to Yolara's&mdash;I do not know why, but go there then she
would not. And within one of its columned rooms, maidens of the
black-haired folks, the wistfulness, the fear, all gone from
their sparkling eyes, served us.</p>

<p>There came to me a huge desire to see the destruction they had
told us of the Dweller's lair; to observe for myself whether it
was not possible to make a way of entrance and to study its
mysteries.</p>

<p>I spoke of this, and to my surprise both the handmaiden and
the O'Keefe showed an almost embarrassed haste to acquiesce in my
hesitant suggestion.</p>

<p>"Sure," cried Larry, "there's lots of time before night!"</p>

<p>He caught himself sheepishly; cast a glance at Lakla.</p>

<p>"I keep forgettin' there's no night here," he mumbled.</p>

<p>"What did you say, Larry?" asked she.</p>

<p>"I said I wish we were sitting in our home in Ireland,
watching the sun go down," he whispered to her. Vaguely I
wondered why she blushed.</p>

<p>But now I must hasten. We went to the temple, and here at
least the ghastly litter of the dead had been cleaned away. We
passed through the blue-caverned space, crossed the narrow arch
that spanned the rushing sea stream, and, ascending, stood again
upon the ivoried pave at the foot of the frowning, towering
amphitheater of jet.</p>

<p>Across the Silver Waters there was sign of neither Web of
Rainbows nor colossal pillars nor the templed lips that I had
seen curving out beneath the Veil when the Shining One had
swirled out to greet its priestess and its voice and to dance
with the sacrifices. There was but a broken and rent mass of the
radiant cliffs against whose base the lake lapped.</p>

<p>Long I looked&mdash;and turned away saddened. Knowing even as
I did what the irised curtain had hidden, still it was as though
some thing of supernal beauty and wonder had been swept away,
never to be replaced; a glamour gone for ever; a work of the high
gods destroyed.</p>

<p>"Let's go back," said Larry abruptly.</p>

<p>I dropped a little behind them to examine a bit of
carving&mdash;and, after all, they did not want me. I watched
them pacing slowly ahead, his arm around her, black hair close to
bronze-gold ringlets. Then I followed. Half were they over the
bridge when through the roar of the imprisoned stream I heard my
name called softly.</p>

<p>"Goodwin! Dr. Goodwin!"</p>

<p>Amazed, I turned. From behind the pedestal of a carved group
slunk&mdash; Marakinoff! My premonition had been right. Some way
he had escaped, slipped through to here. He held his hands high,
came forward cautiously.</p>

<p>"I am finished," he whispered&mdash;"Done! I don't care what
<i>they'll</i> do to me." He nodded toward the handmaiden and
Larry, now at the end of the bridge and passing on, oblivious of
all save each other. He drew closer. His eyes were sunken,
burning, mad; his face etched with deep lines, as though a
graver's tool had cut down through it. I took a step
backward.</p>

<p>A grin, like the grimace of a fiend, blasted the Russian's
visage. He threw himself upon me, his hands clenching at my
throat!</p>

<p>"Larry!" I yelled&mdash;and as I spun around under the shock
of his onslaught, saw the two turn, stand paralyzed, then race
toward me.</p>

<p>"But <i>you'll</i> carry nothing out of here!" shrieked
Marakinoff. "No!"</p>

<p>My foot, darting out behind me, touched vacancy. The roaring
of the racing stream deafened me. I felt its mists about me;
threw myself forward.</p>

<p>I was falling&mdash;falling&mdash;with the Russian's hand
strangling me. I struck water, sank; the hands that gripped my
throat relaxed for a moment their clutch. I strove to writhe
loose; felt that I was being hurled with dreadful speed
on&mdash;full realization came&mdash;on the breast of that racing
torrent dropping from some far ocean cleft and rushing&mdash;
where? A little time, a few breathless instants, I struggled with
the devil who clutched me&mdash;inflexibly, indomitably.</p>

<p>Then a shrieking as of all the pent winds of the universe in
my ears &mdash;blackness!</p>

<p>Consciousness returned slowly, agonizedly.</p>

<p>"Larry!" I groaned. "Lakla!"</p>

<p>A brilliant light was glowing through my closed lids. It hurt.
I opened my eyes, closed them with swords and needles of dazzling
pain shooting through them. Again I opened them cautiously. It
was the sun!</p>

<p>I staggered to my feet. Behind me was a shattered wall of
basalt monoliths, hewn and squared. Before me was the Pacific,
smooth and blue and smiling.</p>

<p>And not far away, cast up on the strand even as I had been,
was&mdash; Marakinoff!</p>

<p>He lay there, broken and dead indeed. Yet all the waters
through which we had passed&mdash;not even the waters of death
themselves&mdash;could wash from his face the grin of triumph.
With the last of my strength I dragged the body from the strand
and pushed it out into the waves. A little billow ran up, coiled
about it, and carried it away, ducking and bending. Another
seized it, and another, playing with it. It floated from my
sight&mdash;that which had been Marakinoff, with all his schemes
to turn our fair world into an undreamed-of-hell.</p>

<p>My strength began to come back to me. I found a thicket and
slept; slept it must have been for many hours, for when I again
awakened the dawn was rosing the east. I will not tell my
sufferings. Suffice it to say that I found a spring and some
fruit, and just before dusk had recovered enough to writhe up to
the top of the wall and discover where I was.</p>

<p>The place was one of the farther islets of the Nan-Matal. To
the north I caught the shadows of the ruins of Nan-Tauach, where
was the moon door, black against the sky. Where was the moon
door&mdash;which, some-way, some-how, I must reach, and
quickly.</p>

<p>At dawn of the next day I got together driftwood and bound it
together in shape of a rough raft with fallen creepers. Then,
with a makeshift paddle, I set forth for Nan-Tauach. Slowly,
painfully, I crept up to it. It was late afternoon before I
grounded my shaky craft on the little beach between the ruined
sea-gates and, creeping up the giant steps, made my way to the
inner enclosure.</p>

<p>And at its opening I stopped, and the tears ran streaming down
my cheeks while I wept aloud with sorrow and with disappointment
and with weariness.</p>

<p>For the great wall in which had been set the pale slab whose
threshold we had crossed to the land of the Shining One lay
shattered and broken. The monoliths were heaped about; the wall
had fallen, and about them shone a film of water, half covering
them.</p>

<p>There was no moon door!</p>

<p>Dazed and weeping, I drew closer, climbed upon their outlying
fragments. I looked out only upon the sea. There had been a great
subsidence, an earth shock, perhaps, tilting downward all that
side&mdash;the echo, little doubt, of that cataclysm which had
blasted the Dweller's lair!</p>

<p>The little squared islet called Tau, in which were hidden the
seven globes, had entirely disappeared. Upon the waters there was
no trace of it.</p>

<p>The moon door was gone; the passage to the Moon Pool was
closed to me &mdash;its chamber covered by the sea!</p>

<p>There was no road to Larry&mdash;nor to Lakla!</p>

<p>And there, for me, the world ended.</p>
