  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">ADAM BLOCKTON, on the day of his curious disappearance,
  passed the time between half-past twelve and ten minutes past one precisely
  as he had passed that particular period of his life on every morning of the
  year except Sundays for a quarter of a century&mdash;seated in a large
  leather easy chair pulled up towards the bay window of the Norchester County
  Club. He sipped champagne from a pint bottle of old Veuve Clicquot, smoked
  with obvious pleasure a shabby blackened pipe, and carried on a mumbling
  conversation which sounded like a monologue but was really addressed to the
  statue a few yards away from the pavement outside&mdash;the statue of an
  elderly man in a long frock coat, whose singularly benevolent appearance was
  sufficient evidence of a life of municipal triumphs and a generously used
  chequebook.</p>

  <p>On that particular morning, however, as several people afterwards
  testified, there was a slight flush upon the leathery cheeks of the elderly
  gentleman in the armchair, an unusual light, too, in his clear blue eyes. He
  beckoned to the only other occupant of the room, Giles Mowbray, his
  solicitor, a man of apparently about the same age as himself, who was
  searching for a newspaper at the round table in the middle of the
  apartment.</p>

  <p>"Come you here, Giles," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray shuffled deferentially across to the speaker. He had been
  solicitor to Sir Adam Blockton since the day he had received his articles and
  entered his father's firm, but he sometimes felt that he knew as little about
  the man and his affairs now as fifty years ago. Sir Adam pointed with his
  pipe to the statue outside.</p>

  <p>"Do you see the old man, Giles?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Seen him most mornings, Adam, for half a century."</p>

  <p>"There is something different about him to-day," Sir Adam persisted. "Look
  at the old hypocrite. There's something in his face&mdash;he's got a smile
  coming. I believe he knows."</p>

  <p>"Knows what?"</p>

  <p>Sir Adam grinned and indulged in a single interjection.</p>

  <p>"Ah!"</p>

  <p>The lawyer had never been a man of imagination and he looked puzzled, as
  indeed he was.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see any change," he confessed.</p>

  <p>Adam Blockton replaced his pipe in his mouth, sucked it slowly and sipped
  his wine. The lawyer, in a moment of retrospect, meditated upon the fact that
  never once, in the twenty or thirty years during which he had carried out his
  present morning's programme, had he offered to share with anyone the contents
  of his carefully frozen bottle.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool, Giles," his old friend declared abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Maybe, Adam," was the indifferent reply.</p>

  <p>"How long have you been my lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"Getting on for fifty years."</p>

  <p>"How much do you know of my affairs?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>Adam Blockton chuckled.</p>

  <p>"You speak the truth, anyway," he observed. "You know nothing of my
  affairs, Giles, nor does my solitary cashier, nor do those two clerks who
  stand behind their mahogany desks and pay out my money or draw it in. Neither
  does he," Sir Adam concluded, pointing with his pipe to the statue
  outside.</p>

  <p>The lawyer was a trifle uneasy as he glanced through the fine, rounded
  window at the cold granite figure upon its pedestal.</p>

  <p>"You are a very rich man, Adam," he mumbled. "That the whole world knows.
  You are almost the last man in the United Kingdom who owns a bank of his own
  and refuses to incorporate for fear of having to issue a balance sheet, they
  say," he added with a wheezy chuckle. "You are one who has kept a tight hold
  on his own moneybags. Some day&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Some day," Adam Blockton interrupted ruthlessly. "How many more years do
  you suppose there are for me? I have been asking that old blitherer outside.
  That's one reason why the grin that you can't see is there on his face. I am
  eighty-seven, Giles."</p>

  <p>"You are as strong as a horse," the other declared. "Why, your
  father&mdash;there he stands still proud and disdainful after all these years
  of Norchester fogs and rains. He was over eighty when they made the drawings
  for that statue."</p>

  <p>Adam Blockton had the air of one who had ceased to listen. The club
  steward, according to custom, came softly into the room a few moments later,
  filled up the glass of its most distinguished member and leaned over his
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes past one, Sir Adam," he announced deferentially. "Your
  cutlets are coming up."</p>

  <p>Adam Blockton gave signs of assent and waved the man away. The lawyer,
  too, shuffled off. He knew his old friend better than to linger. Sir Adam,
  who was alone now in the room, leaned back in his chair, a queer, faraway
  look in his narrow, ferretlike eyes as he gazed out at that stony,
  unresponsive figure. It was a showery day in May and the raindrops from a
  recent downpour were tumbling down the window pane. Nevertheless, the face of
  the statue was still clearly visible. It seemed to the old man seated there
  in his chair, with his pipe growing cold in his fingers, that the fancied
  grin was also still there upon those carved lips.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The steward, in the busy luncheon-room of the club, glanced up at the
  clock and frowned. It was two minutes after the time when the
  multi-millionaire banker was accustomed to take his place and the entrée dish
  with its silver cover had already been reverently placed in front of the
  chosen chair. He turned and left the room, crossed the hall and entered the
  reading lounge.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam," he announced, "your cutlets&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He went no further. The hall across which he had passed had been empty,
  the room in which he stood was empty, the easy chair was unoccupied. Sir Adam
  Blockton had disappeared.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">THE first few hours of this singular disappearance of its
  most notable member from the exclusive club in the heart of a busy city were
  filled with curiosity rather than apprehension. Towards evening, however,
  there was a development of the latter sentiment. An informal meeting was held
  at the club, at which were present Mr. Giles Mowbray, the solicitor, who,
  owing to his somewhat upset condition, was accompanied by his nephew, Mr.
  Martin Mowbray; Captain Elmhurst, the Chief Constable; Mr. Richard Groome,
  the cashier of the bank, and, standing respectfully in the background, Henry
  Lawford, the chief steward and manager of the club.</p>

  <p>Mr. Giles Mowbray, still a trifle incoherent from the shock, presented the
  case.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam came in at exactly his customary time," he told the little
  company. "He occupied his usual chair, was served with his usual drink by
  Lawford here, everything was only a page out of his everyday history. He
  called me over to listen to one of his usual jeers against his father's
  statue. He seemed well enough in health but inclined to wander. I left him
  preparing to finish his glass of wine and I expected to see him in the dining
  room within a few minutes according to his day-by-day custom. That is all I
  have to tell you, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst, a slim, middle-aged man who had preserved his military
  appearance and manner of speech, nodded comprehendingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is simple enough," he said. "Let us go back a little. Tell us
  what you saw of Sir Adam during the morning, Mr. Groome."</p>

  <p>"Scarcely anything, sir," the cashier, a withered-looking little person,
  grey-haired, bespectacled and with a very anxious expression, replied.
  "Nothing unusual happened at the bank. At half-past nine punctually Sir Adam
  arrived. He wished me good morning, he wished the two other gentlemen
  associated with the bank good morning and went into his private room. There
  were very few letters and most of these were advertisements. In about ten
  minutes I received my usual summons to enter. Sir Adam was reading the
  <i>Times</i> and smoking his pipe.</p>

  <p>"'Nothing important for you, Groome,' he said, pushing a little pile
  towards me. 'Four or five enterprising tradesmen who desire to open an
  account with the firm. The rest are advertisements and prospectuses.'"</p>

  <p>"Do you think," Captain Elmhurst asked, "that Sir Adam gave you all the
  letters he received?"</p>

  <p>"With the exception of one which he left unopened upon the table, sir, I
  am sure of it."</p>

  <p>"There were no signs of papers having been destroyed or anything in the
  wastepaper basket?" the Chief Constable continued. "This is an entirely
  informal meeting, you understand, Mr. Groome, and you will not be betraying a
  confidence if you give us an exact idea of the contents of the letters handed
  to you for attention."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;certainly," Groome replied nervously. "There were
  five applications to open accounts with the bank and as is our custom we sent
  a printed slip announcing that the firm was not seeking any further business
  and that we must respectfully decline negotiations."</p>

  <p>"And the remainder of the papers?"</p>

  <p>"Prospectuses of new companies, sir, and enquiries. Not a single letter
  except this one which Sir Adam left upon his desk unopened," he added,
  producing from his breast pocket a coroneted mauve envelope. "This I can tell
  you, knowing the handwriting very well, is from Sir Adam's daughter, Lady
  Pengwill. She married Lord Pengwill when he was the Honourable Charles
  Pengwill, and before he came into the title some twenty-five years ago."</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst handled the letter and laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, Mr. Groome," he said. "Are you sure that no business
  of importance took place this morning likely to upset Sir Adam?"</p>

  <p>"No business ever takes place at the bank, sir," the cashier confided.
  "For the last few years Sir Adam's policy has been to wind up the business
  quietly. We have had wonderful offers from wealthy firms in a first-class
  position but nothing has ever changed Sir Adam's determination. Not a new
  account has been opened in the ledgers for nearly two years."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur of astonishment. Mr. Mowbray, Junior, was unable
  to resist asking the obvious question.</p>

  <p>"Then what on earth do you do with your money and Sir Adam's own huge
  fortune?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The cashier's expression for a moment was the expression of a dreamy
  child. He took off his glasses and wiped them.</p>

  <p>"I have no means of knowing, sir," he answered.</p>

  <p>"And I think, Martin," his uncle put in, "this is not a question we have
  the right to ask just now."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," the young man agreed. "But to think that you have there
  the whole correspondence of a banker of enormous wealth! Not a line about
  investments of any sort, nothing from stock-brokers or anybody else connected
  with the money market! It seems odd. If Sir Adam were not such a frightfully
  wealthy man it would give rise to ridiculous suspicions."</p>

  <p>"The time for this sort of conversation has scarcely arrived," his uncle
  said stiffly. "The question simply is&mdash;what has become of Sir Adam
  Blockton? No one here seems to be able to help in the least and I gather from
  what you told me, Lawford, that there were no replies to our enquiries posted
  in the hall as to whether anyone had seen or spoken to Sir Adam after he was
  left alone in the reading room."</p>

  <p>"That is so, sir," the steward acknowledged. "No member entering or
  leaving the club saw anything of Sir Adam. The usual offices were naturally
  searched at once. Two of the members&mdash;Mr. Williams and Mr.
  Marshall&mdash;happened to meet on the steps and were talking there when I
  left the reading room for the dining room. They were still there when I
  returned and found Sir Adam had disappeared. They are absolutely certain that
  Sir Adam did not leave the club."</p>

  <p>"What about his car?" Captain Elmhurst enquired.</p>

  <p>"It arrived at half-past two, as usual," the steward replied. "It waited
  for half an hour, and finding that Sir Adam was not here returned to the bank
  and then on to the garage. I spoke to the chauffeur on the telephone a few
  minutes ago. He reported that he had heard nothing from his master since he
  had left him here before lunch."</p>

  <p>"What members of the family are within reach?" Captain Elmhurst asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Giles Mowbray leaned forward in his chair.</p>

  <p>"There's Lady Pengwill, from whom he received a letter this morning, but
  she lives in London. His other daughter, Lady Tidswell, lives at Wrotton
  Park, which is quite close."</p>

  <p>"What about Lady Pengwill's daughter, Lady Diana?" young Mowbray enquired.
  "I thought I saw her in the town the other day."</p>

  <p>"I believe that she is somewhere in the neighbourhood," his uncle
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana," Groome announced, "is staying with her aunt, Lady Tidswell,
  at Wrotton Park."</p>

  <p>"She hasn't been into the bank lately, I suppose?" Captain Elmhurst
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No member of the family," Mr. Groome confided, "is allowed to visit the
  bank except by special appointment."</p>

  <p>"Were there any telephone enquiries of any importance this morning?
  Anything at all likely to upset Sir Adam?" Captain Elmhurst suggested.</p>

  <p>"The bank is not connected with the telephone," Groome replied.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" the Chief Constable exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You are comparatively a newcomer," Mr. Mowbray sighed, "and of course the
  conditions you have come up against do sound ridiculous."</p>

  <p>"I understood," Elmhurst continued, "that Sir Adam was one of the richest
  men in England. I have heard stories of his wealth ever since I came
  here."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about his wealth, I think," Giles Mowbray admitted.
  "You may remember how astonished everyone was over his first application for
  War Loan, many years ago, for a million pounds. Lately, however, he has led
  the life of a hermit. Every now and then one hears of some huge sums
  invested, always in very sound concerns. Many of the financial papers have
  openly declared that these have been made by a north country banker and have
  given the name of Sir Adam Blockton, and they have never been contradicted.
  This, however, is only vague talk. The financial affairs of Sir Adam are not
  our immediate concern. What we want to know is what has become of him."</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Captain Elmhurst declared, "the matter is becoming one
  for the police."</p>

  <p>The door of the room in which this informal discussion was taking place
  was suddenly opened. A young woman of most attractive appearance stood upon
  the threshold. She was fair-complexioned, with well-shaped features,
  brown-haired and with eyes neutral in the uncertainty of their colour, but
  intriguing in their brightness and their depth. She looked at the men
  gathered round the table and there was a quiver of indignation in her tone as
  she addressed them.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps somebody would be good enough to tell me what this is all about?"
  she asked, and although her tone was brusque her voice had a smooth and
  pleasant quality. "They tell me below&mdash;and the thing is
  ridiculous&mdash;that my grandfather has disappeared."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mowbray's mumble was confused and inarticulate. Long before it had
  resolved itself into speech his nephew was upon his feet&mdash;a grave young
  man but with an agreeable voice and manner.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana, perhaps you will allow me to explain," he begged. "Your
  grandfather certainly does seem to be&mdash;er&mdash;missing since just
  before luncheon-time. This is a perfectly informal meeting of one or two of
  his friends to discuss the matter."</p>

  <p>The girl came a little further into the room, moving with a graceful sway,
  a perplexed look in her eyes, a dubious smile at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"Missing?" she repeated. "Don't tell me that my grandfather has gone in
  for melodrama!"</p>

  <p>"He has given us all a shock, anyhow," the young man replied, placing a
  chair for the newcomer within the small circle. "This is just what has
  happened."</p>

  <p>He told her concisely and in well-chosen words. When he had finished she
  laughed, not unkindly but somewhat contemptuously. She glanced round the
  circle, evidently not quite sure as to the various identities.</p>

  <p>"But you can't any of you conceive that my grandfather, a man of
  absolutely fixed habits, should, without the least reason, embark upon an
  enterprise of this sort?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Let me point out, young lady," Giles Mowbray said, leaning slightly
  towards her, "it is some twenty or thirty years since your grandfather has
  departed from his usual habit of lunching in the club here at ten minutes
  past one. His cutlets are invariably ready at that hour, his small bottle of
  wine is served to him in the lounge, where he arrives at half-past twelve and
  where he sits and smokes until the moment comes for him to take his seat in
  the dining room. He arrived this morning at his usual time in his own car,
  driven by his own chauffeur. He was finishing his wine when our steward here
  summoned him to luncheon. To anyone who knew your grandfather intimately the
  precision of his movements was&mdash;er&mdash;almost epic. Time passed.
  Everyone was naturally disturbed. There was no sign of your grandfather.
  Three minutes later the steward sought him in the reading room. The place was
  empty. No one had seen him leave the club. He has not returned to the bank,
  as was his invariable custom, and his cashier here will tell you that he has
  neither seen nor heard of him since. His car and chauffeur arrived here at
  two-thirty for him, waited for half-an-hour and are now in the garage.
  Bearing in mind all these circumstances, Lady Diana, I think that you will
  see that we, as day-by-day acquaintances&mdash;I will not say friends,
  because he had no friends&mdash;and my nephew and I, as his legal
  representatives, were justified in holding this informal meeting. Captain
  Elmhurst has attended it on behalf of the police."</p>

  <p>Lady Diana, who was evidently a law unto herself in this world, drew a
  cigarette from a very beautiful gold case and calmly lit it.</p>

  <p>"I am most intrigued," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can help us," Martin Mowbray observed.</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst passed over the unopened letter which lay upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"This is the only communication your grandfather received this morning
  which he did not open," he confided. "Perhaps you would feel yourself
  justified in seeing if the contents in any way explain the affair."</p>

  <p>Lady Diana accepted the letter a little languidly. She glanced at the
  handwriting with a faint grimace.</p>

  <p>"It is from my mother," she announced.</p>

  <p>"So we gathered. We wondered whether, under the circumstances, you would
  feel disposed to open it," Captain Elmhurst suggested.</p>

  <p>"On your life I wouldn't!" she declared. "If there is anything my
  grandfather hates it is to have his letters or newspapers interfered with. I
  should be cut off with a million or two if I touched it. I am running no
  risks of that sort, thank you!"</p>

  <p>"It might become the duty of the police at any moment to open it," Martin
  Mowbray reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Let them do it, then, with pleasure," the young lady said, crossing her
  legs and sending the elderly solicitor's eyes up to the ceiling. "I don't
  suppose my grandfather's left even a million to the police. They have nothing
  to lose by it. No, I am not butting-in on this affair at all. I am not afraid
  of the old gentleman, mind you, but I have a deadly fear of being left out of
  his Will."</p>

  <p>Mr. Giles Mowbray thought it time to assert himself.</p>

  <p>"I am your grandfather's solicitor, as you know, Lady Diana," he said,
  "and I sympathise with your feelings in the matter. I will take charge of the
  letter for the moment."</p>

  <p>He slipped it into his breast coat-pocket. The Chief Constable smiled
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"I have every sympathy with the young lady's discretion," he observed,
  "but as the letter might clear up the mystery and it is scarcely likely that
  Sir Adam has left you a million, Mowbray, I think you might venture to break
  the seal."</p>

  <p>The solicitor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that the necessity will not arise. If it does I shall
  do so in your presence."</p>

  <p>The girl glanced round at the faces of the five men. Every one was on the
  whole expressionless but in each there was a touch of that queer sense of
  apprehension which had been conveyed in Giles Mowbray's few words.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to tell me," the girl asked incredulously, "that you think
  anything really serious has happened to my grandfather?"</p>

  <p>Nobody returned a straightforward answer. The girl laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"A pack of childish nonsense, I call this!" she exclaimed. "As though
  anything could have happened to the old boy!"</p>

  <p>The young man opposite looked at her across the table. There was rebuke in
  his clear grey eyes, a note of rebuke in his tone.</p>

  <p>"The circumstances connected with your grandfather's disappearance, Lady
  Diana, were at first inexplicable. They have now become sinister. Perhaps you
  do not realise that every room in the club has been searched. There is not a
  foot of vacant space which has not been examined. It is a great many years
  since anyone has seen your grandfather walk more than about the length of
  this room. Perhaps you can suggest, yourself, some means by which he is
  eluding us."</p>

  <p>The girl refused to be rebuked. She smiled at the young man, who was
  certainly very good to look at.</p>

  <p>"All right," she agreed, "I will take all that you say for granted. It was
  impossible for him to have left the reading room without being observed.
  Neither he nor his remains could leave the club; <i>ergo</i>&mdash;one of
  your premises must be wrong. My own impression is that my grandfather is
  fooling us all. He has done it before in a small way and has put his tongue
  in his cheek this time with a vengeance. You have done all that reasonable
  men could be expected to do. Let Mr. Mowbray go into his affairs and find out
  if there is any reason for this disappearance."</p>

  <p>"I shall communicate with every member of the family at once," the lawyer
  said, "and I shall act upon their instructions. If in the meantime the police
  interfere, I am powerless."</p>

  <p>"What do the police intend to do, Captain Elmhurst?" Lady Diana asked.</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall confer with the Clerk to the County Magistrates and my own Chief
  Inspector," he said. "I know of no precedent for a case of this description
  but certainly I shall not interfere until the family have had a reasonable
  time to make their own enquiries. In the meantime, have you the keys of the
  bank, Mr. Groome?"</p>

  <p>"They are in my pocket, sir," the cashier replied.</p>

  <p>"I should propose, gentlemen," Captain Elmhurst continued, "that we make
  an unofficial examination of the bank premises."</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray rose from his chair. The hands which were pressed against
  the table in front of him were visibly shaking. His voice was harsh and
  strained. The shock of the day's events was beginning to tell upon him.</p>

  <p>"I take the strongest possible exception to that course, Captain
  Elmhurst," he protested. "The disappearance of my old friend, Sir Adam, has
  not yet become a matter for criminal investigation. I decline to allow my
  client's papers to be tampered with in any way."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Every one of the little party seemed to have
  realised the note of passionate emotion underlying the lawyer's few quavering
  words. Somehow or other the atmosphere had become electrical. The fear of
  this strange thing that had happened was beginning to make itself felt. The
  silence was unexpectedly broken by Mr. Groome.</p>

  <p>"I apologise for any seeming discourtesy to Mr. Mowbray," he said, "but I
  welcome the proposal of Captain Elmhurst. I have long wished for an
  opportunity to speak to one of the family, and suggest that the condition of
  the bank should be looked into. In another year's time I should have reached
  the age when the Blocktons, for the last hundred years, have granted pensions
  to their servants. I have marked off the days one by one but I should never
  have reached the end of the year. I should have gone mad!"</p>

  <p>Groome's measured speech came like a bomb-shell to everyone. For years he
  had been known by sight to most of them&mdash;a silent, suave figure who
  seemed to appear from nowhere and yet who was always there behind his desk at
  the bank ready to answer any question as to Sir Adam's whereabouts. Never
  once had his manner or voice varied. He had become the perfect human
  automaton. It was his first self-disclosure as a human being. The Chief
  Constable turned towards Lady Diana.</p>

  <p>"You might be taken as representing the family here, Lady Diana," he
  pointed out. "Have you any objection to just taking a casual glance at the
  bank premises with Mr. Groome, myself, and naturally Mr. Mowbray and his
  nephew? It seems to me that your presence would regularise the
  proceeding."</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to come," he said. "The action is premature. I protest. Sir Adam
  will never forgive us."</p>

  <p>"What about your nephew then?"</p>

  <p>"At his own risk," the lawyer declared. "It may cost him his place in the
  firm. If there is any trouble with Sir Adam I shall disown him. We shall
  probably have a telephone message from my client at any moment and when he
  finds that his private affairs have become public property there will be
  trouble&mdash;a very great deal of trouble."</p>

  <p>"I regret to differ from my uncle and I am willing to come," Martin
  Mowbray said calmly.</p>

  <p>The girl rose to her feet and buttoned up her coat.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," she declared. "Anything is better than sitting around here
  wondering what we are going to do next. I think, Mr. Mowbray, as you persist
  in taking my grandfather's disappearance so seriously I had better have my
  mother's letter back again."</p>

  <p>The lawyer passed it to her across the table.</p>

  <p>"You understand, Lady Diana," he warned her, "my nephew goes against my
  wishes. If you accompany him it may cost you a fortune. Sir Adam never
  permits any liberties to be taken with his belongings. If he finds that you
  have been prying into his affairs you will be out of his Will as soon as he
  can find a pen to scratch through your name."</p>

  <p>"If you go on talking like this," the girl remarked, "I shall begin to
  think that you have an idea of your own as to Sir Adam's whereabouts."</p>

  <p>The old man began to shake again in his chair. He looked at her
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>"You would be entirely wrong," he muttered. "I have no idea,&mdash;I don't
  suppose anyone else has,&mdash;but I have known Sir Adam longer than any of
  you and this is what I do feel: If anything strange has happened to him he
  will come out of it all right."</p>

  <p>"We all hope so," Captain Elmhurst said kindly. "Nevertheless, as the
  affair stands at present, I think it requires investigation."</p>

  <p>"By whom?" the old man demanded with uneasy belligerence.</p>

  <p>"By his friends&mdash;and by the law."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">A SHOWER of rain was drenching the streets when the little
  party arrived at the premises of Blockton's Bank, which were situated about
  two hundred yards away from the club. Mr. Groome, with unsteady fingers,
  first opened the heavy iron gates and then with a smaller key the massive
  front doors. One by one his companions passed on into the gloomy, vaultlike
  place. The cashier closed the doors after them and turned on the lights.</p>

  <p>"It smells like a church," Lady Diana observed. "Mouldy enough for one,
  too."</p>

  <p>Mr. Groome took no notice of her remark. He had worked himself up into a
  state of desperate calm, but every word he uttered sounded grim and
  portentous.</p>

  <p>"You will allow me to show you the premises my own way," he begged. "Will
  you follow me behind the counters, please?"</p>

  <p>He lifted a flap and they followed him to the far end, where the woodwork
  in front was heightened and there was a spy-hole window.</p>

  <p>"This is my place," he pointed out. "From here I can check any deposits
  and payments and supply my clerks with any money necessary." He touched three
  drawers in front of him. "This one," he went on, "should contain Treasury
  notes, the other silver, the far one notes larger than five pounds."</p>

  <p>He pulled them open. Deep and ample receptacles they were&mdash;but empty.
  Where the notes should have been there were oblong strips of cardboard
  secured by rubber bands but there was nothing between them. Mr. Groome passed
  on.</p>

  <p>"This is where the first clerk would stand," he continued. "I will show
  you his drawers."</p>

  <p>He drew another key from his bunch and opened the three. All of them were
  empty.</p>

  <p>"This is the second clerk's desk," he indicated, moving on a few
  yards.</p>

  <p>Again he opened three drawers, again there was the same grim
  emptiness.</p>

  <p>"Where is all the cash kept at night?" Martin Mowbray asked.</p>

  <p>"It goes into the office. Not one single penny is left in any of these
  receptacles."</p>

  <p>"Supposing Sir Adam should turn up a little late in the morning?" Captain
  Elmhurst enquired.</p>

  <p>"We could not pay," was the prompt reply. "I am bound to add, however,
  that such a thing has never happened. Since Sir Adam took over the control of
  the bank he has never been later than half-past nine in his office. The bank
  opens at ten. At a quarter to ten the two clerks come into the office and
  receive one hundred pounds each from Sir Adam. Years ago it used to be one
  thousand pounds each. I have known the time when it was five thousand. To-day
  the hundred pounds is seldom touched."</p>

  <p>"Blockton's Bank!" Martin Mowbray muttered to himself.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen, you will now allow me to show you the remainder of the
  premises here," the cashier went on.</p>

  <p>"What about the old man's office?" Diana asked. "All my life I have wanted
  to go in there and I have never been allowed to cross the threshold."</p>

  <p>"We will visit that last, if you please," Mr. Groome begged.</p>

  <p>He led them into a further recess of the bank, the nature of which was
  concealed by folding oak screens. These he pushed on one side. Behind them
  was a row of chairs, six empty desks&mdash;nothing else. There were
  disfigurements upon the wall where fittings seemed to have been removed.
  Apart from that there remained not even a cupboard.</p>

  <p>"The screen was first erected," the cashier continued, "to give an
  impression of space beyond. As you see, there is nothing. Now I will show you
  Sir Adam's private office."</p>

  <p>They followed him to the heavy, old-fashioned oak door, the upper panels
  of which were of glass, covered with faded red silk. Groome unlocked and
  threw it open. He turned on the electric light and they all looked round
  curiously. Somehow, the room, although its contents were still in good
  condition, seemed to preserve an air of great antiquity. The two fauteuils
  and the divan of worn leather, the square heavy table, the two high-backed
  chairs which faced one another on either side of it, one obviously for Sir
  Adam himself and the other for a possible client, the mirror on the
  mantelpiece, were all Georgian&mdash;not only undeniably of that period but
  with the air of having brought with them some part of the atmosphere of those
  days. The deep red Turkey carpet covered every inch of the floor. Upon the
  table there stood only a huge inkstand and a black oak case of stationery.
  Over the chimney-piece was an oil painting which seemed to be a picture of
  the statue opposite the club. There was no other attempt at decoration in the
  room. Martin Mowbray looked round him in puzzled fashion.</p>

  <p>"What about the safes, Mr. Groome?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The cashier shook his head.</p>

  <p>"There are none up here of any account," he said solemnly.</p>

  <p>"But where on earth is the money, deeds and all that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"I will show you," the other replied.</p>

  <p>He moved over to a spot near the hearth-rug and raised a flap of the
  carpet. Beneath it in the oak flooring was a brass ring attached to a trap
  door. Groome raised it and, feeling for a moment underneath, turned on an
  electric light. Diana leaned eagerly forward, an action which she was to
  regret for many weeks to come.</p>

  <p>"I want to look at the money chests," she explained.</p>

  <p>She stooped a little lower and peered into the vault. Almost immediately
  her shriek rang out even above the sound of the falling door, the brass ring
  of which had slipped from Groome's nerveless fingers. Diana had staggered
  back against the table, her hands stretched out in front of her, cowering
  back as though seeking to escape from some terrible sight. Groome stood like
  a waxen figure, his face utterly destitute of colour, blank, undiluted panic
  in his hollow eyes. He, too, swayed on his feet and caught at the edge of the
  mantelpiece for support. His groan was thrilling enough but it lacked the
  clear note of dramatic horror which had vibrated in the girl's voice. The
  whole company, for a few seconds, seemed spellbound. Then Martin Mowbray
  pulled himself together. He leaned forward and caught hold of the ring.</p>

  <p>"Don't!" the girl shrieked. "Don't! It's horrible!"</p>

  <p>The young man sank on to his knees and his fingers gripped the ring. He
  glanced at Elmhurst.</p>

  <p>"Look after Lady Diana," he enjoined. "We've got to know what's down
  here."</p>

  <p>He threw back the door. The cellar below might have stood for a chamber of
  horrors, for its walls were lined with a number of black upright boxes shaped
  like coffins, and only comprehensible when one realised that there were names
  painted in white letters upon each. The electric light was insufficient to
  penetrate the distant corners, but if possible the obscurity of the object
  which lay in the middle distance lent it even a deeper horror. It was only
  after a few moments of terrified concentration that the two men on their
  knees realised that they were staring at the figure of a human being all
  crumpled up, as though he had fallen or been thrown from the topmost of the
  short flight of stairs leading from the office to the floor of the cellar, or
  arrived there as the result of one terrific blow. The agony of sudden death
  was lurking at the corners of his mouth and in his staring eyes. By his side,
  where it had dripped from him, lay a pool of blood. The Chief Constable and
  Martin Mowbray were staring at one another. The same thought had blazed its
  way into the consciousness of both of them.</p>

  <p>"It isn't Sir Adam," the young lawyer gasped.</p>

  <p>Elmhurst shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Twice his size," he muttered. "Drop the door."</p>

  <p>Mowbray hesitated but did as he was told. Both men stood up. The Chief
  Constable plunged into direct speech.</p>

  <p>"There has been a tragedy here," he announced. "It looks like a murder.
  But listen, Lady Diana. The victim is not your grandfather."</p>

  <p>"Not Sir Adam?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"No. It is impossible to say who it is but it is not Sir Adam. This has
  become my affair now. The best thing for you to do would be to go away. This
  is a man's job. Young Mowbray can stay with me."</p>

  <p>She sank nervously into one of the high-backed chairs, gripping the arms
  with her fingers. Speech for the moment was quite impossible.</p>

  <p>"Groome, I must rely upon you," the Chief Constable continued. "Will you
  ring up the police station? Say I want an inspector and two men here at once,
  also the police doctor and an ambulance."</p>

  <p>The cashier nodded. His queer little voice seemed more subdued than ever.
  He was moistening his lips and struggling for breath.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't Sir Adam, did you say?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody I ever saw before," Mowbray assured him.</p>

  <p>"A stranger to me, too," Elmhurst declared.</p>

  <p>The cashier tottered to a chair and sat there for a moment, his hands
  covering his face, rocking himself gently and mumbling. Then he rose to his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to go next door. No telephone here," he faltered.</p>

  <p>He disappeared, closing the door behind him. Diana took a little breath
  and rising to her feet laid her hand on Martin Mowbray's arm.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I was such a fool," she said. "It was a nasty sight to look down on
  unexpectedly. You are right, though. It isn't my grandfather. It is no one I
  ever saw before, either. Do you think&mdash;is there anything I could do,
  Captain Elmhurst? I hate it, but I have my certificate for nursing."</p>

  <p>"Not a thing," was the prompt reply. "An affair of this sort needs
  professional attention. All that I beg of you is to get away as quickly as
  possible before the police and the doctor arrive."</p>

  <p>Diana lingered for a moment. There was an ugly thought in her mind.</p>

  <p>"What about the rest of the cellar?" she faltered. "There may have been a
  fight. Sir Adam&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he interrupted, "take my advice and get away from
  here. It is possible, of course, that there may be more discoveries; but I
  promise you, if they are connected with your grandfather, you shall know at
  once. You are staying, I believe, with Lady Tidswell. You shall know all
  there is to be known without a moment's delay."</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray passed his arm through hers and led her towards the exit.
  The door of the bank itself had been left unlocked and the little wave of wet
  air which flowed in as he opened it was like a breath from Paradise. The girl
  threw back her head and drew it in.</p>

  <p>"I am not often an idiot like this," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"Any woman in the world would have been upset," he replied, his tone full
  of sympathy. "Here, get into my car, please. The chauffeur will take you
  anywhere you wish. I will go back to the club as soon as possible and
  telephone you. This hushing-up business is over now. The police have the
  case. Much simpler."</p>

  <p>She gave him a feeble little smile of thanks and took her place in the
  coupé. The young man waited until the car had started, then he called over
  the policeman from the other side of the road.</p>

  <p>"Constable," he explained, "there is a little trouble in the bank. Captain
  Elmhurst, the Chief Constable, is there and has sent for an inspector. Will
  you stay where you are, please, and see that no one else enters?"</p>

  <p>The policeman was an exceedingly curious person and he looked longingly at
  the building.</p>

  <p>"Nothing I could do inside?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," was the curt reply. "Stand out here and wait."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">MARTIN MOWBRAY had played Rugby football for England and
  cricket for his county. He was thirty years old and in as good condition as a
  man can be who spends a portion of each day in an office. Nevertheless, after
  the Inspector had completed his investigations and the body of the dead man
  was lifted and carried up the stairs into Sir Adam's office, he felt the
  perspiration wet upon his forehead and a nasty inclination towards sickness
  as he turned away with a shudder from the hideous spectacle. The police
  surgeon stopped to speak to him after the ambulance men had passed out with
  their burden followed by the Chief Constable.</p>

  <p>"Dead, I suppose?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"Stone dead," was the prompt response.</p>

  <p>"No chance of it being accidental?"</p>

  <p>The surgeon raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"The wound at the back of his head might have been accidental," he
  replied, "but the bullet which passed through his shoulderblade and into his
  heart was murder right enough."</p>

  <p>"Murder! In the vault there?" the young man exclaimed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Looks like it. I'll tell you more about it, Martin, after I have
  completed my examination up at the mortuary. I have lost a quarter of an hour
  already whilst the Inspector was busy. I'll tell you anything you want to
  know later in the evening. So far as I have gone at present," he added a
  little more deliberately, "I should say that he had been shot first and then
  thrown down, but that is all speculative."</p>

  <p>"He didn't look like a burglar&mdash;his clothes, I mean, and that sort of
  thing," Mowbray observed.</p>

  <p>"His clothes are as good as yours or mine," the surgeon answered. "A good
  deal better than most of mine. That is the Inspector's job, of course, but I
  did just turn down the collar&mdash;couldn't see the name, but it was Savile
  Row."</p>

  <p>"A stranger, of course?"</p>

  <p>"A stranger to me, at any rate," the surgeon acquiesced. "Everything up
  till now is speculation. I must get off with the ambulance. I am leaving the
  Inspector and sergeant behind. Gilson is there, too, searching for
  fingerprints. See you later."</p>

  <p>He hurried out. Martin glanced down into the vault where the Inspector was
  standing with folded arms looking curiously up the flight of steps.</p>

  <p>"Want any help, Inspector?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at present, sir. One or two curious things here if you'd like to come
  down."</p>

  <p>"I'll be there in a moment."</p>

  <p>Mowbray turned round and crossed the office to where Groome was sitting,
  his face covered with his hands, moaning slightly to himself.</p>

  <p>"Horrible affair, Groome," Martin remarked.</p>

  <p>The cashier's reply was inaudible. He slowly removed his hands from before
  his face, however, and a little exclamation broke from Mowbray's lips. The
  man seemed to have aged a dozen years. There were black lines under his eyes,
  his lips were twitching and in the eyes themselves horror still lingered.</p>

  <p>"You didn't recognise the poor fellow, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Groome shook his head feebly.</p>

  <p>"They had covered up his face with an ambulance cloth when they crossed
  the room," he confided. "Thank God they had! I had to look. There was nothing
  but white cloth. I have never seen a dead man, Mr. Mowbray."</p>

  <p>"I have&mdash;several," the young lawyer told him, "but I have never seen
  one that has been left like that. You caught a glimpse of the body before the
  police came?"</p>

  <p>Groome covered his face once more with his hands.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember," he groaned. "It was a vision. I have a book at
  home&mdash;a volume of Dante&mdash;Doré's illustrations. There is a face
  there like it."</p>

  <p>"It was not like anyone you have seen in life?" Mowbray persisted.</p>

  <p>"No man's face in life could have looked like that," Groome muttered.</p>

  <p>"It did not remind you of anybody?"</p>

  <p>The man lurched sideways in his chair. Mowbray was just in time to break
  his fall. He laid him on the floor and called down to the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Fanshawe, could you spare your sergeant for a moment? The old man here,
  Groome, has fainted. Send him across the way for Dr. Jonson and let him get
  some brandy."</p>

  <p>"Up you go, Bob," the Inspector ordered. "Come right back, mind."</p>

  <p>The sergeant came running up the stairs, passed across the gloomy bank
  premises and into the street, pushed his way through the little knot of
  curious people who were being kept back by the policeman on duty and crossed
  the road. Mowbray did his best at first aid and opened the window slightly.
  Then he made his way to the top of the stairs leading down to the vault. The
  place was fairly well lit by the various electric lamps, but it presented a
  drear and dismantled appearance. Two sides were occupied entirely by what
  seemed to be a row of black steel lockers, the other two were piled with
  packing cases and reams of paper and in a corner was a rough table, three or
  four balls of string, a bracket lamp, some ink and pens and a chunk of
  sealing wax. Exactly opposite the staircase from the bank parlour was a
  screen.</p>

  <p>"What is behind there, Inspector?" Martin enquired.</p>

  <p>The former crossed the floor and pulled the screen on one side.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that, sir?" he asked, pointing to another flight of
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Mowbray exclaimed. "Where do they lead to?"</p>

  <p>"I have not yet investigated the matter, sir. The Captain will be back in
  a few minutes. I thought it best to wait. I am wondering if they may not lead
  to the premises occupied by Sir Adam Blockton. They say he lived here."</p>

  <p>"Seems queer if they do," Mowbray remarked. "Groome, the cashier, assured
  us only an hour or so ago that he had been over the three rooms occupied by
  Sir Adam and he said nothing about a private entrance from the bank. Did you
  look at the stairs?"</p>

  <p>"I did not, sir," the Inspector replied. "That is to say, I did not
  examine them closely. What with Captain Elmhurst being on his way back and
  the rumour I heard of Sir Adam's disappearance, I thought it better to point
  them out to him personally before I commenced anything on my own
  account."</p>

  <p>"Better send for your fingerprint man again," Mowbray told him, "and don't
  let anyone get playing about with that handle."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded approval.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," he said, "but the fingerprint man was
  disappointed with what he found in Sir Adam's office. That's why he went off
  so quickly."</p>

  <p>"I know where you can get some more recent ones," Mowbray confided. "Over
  at the club. If you stay here I will drop in there myself and tell them not
  to touch the chair Sir Adam sat in. I will telephone, too, to the Town Hall
  for Gilson to come back. First of all I'd better go back and have a look at
  poor old Groome."</p>

  <p>He remounted the staircase and stepped into the bank parlour. The doctor
  had arrived and was bending over the cashier. He glanced round at the sound
  of footsteps.</p>

  <p>"Ordinary faint," he reported. "The fellow's heart is weak. He will be all
  right as soon as we can get him home. I have sent for a taxi They all seem to
  know where he lives."</p>

  <p>"Look after him well," Mowbray begged. "There are several very important
  questions the police will want to ask him."</p>

  <p>"Let him alone for to-night," the doctor advised. "I'm not saying there is
  any particular danger but he might slip off at any time."</p>

  <p>The young man nodded and passed on out of the bank premises. The door was
  standing ajar but with two police constables now guarding it. The little
  crowd outside had partially dispersed or been moved on. Martin crossed the
  street to the club and made his way to the steward's room. Lawford was
  writing out menus for dinner.</p>

  <p>"Any news, sir?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"None at all. I stepped across to ask you not to have any of the furniture
  touched in the reading room, especially the armchair in which Sir Adam was
  seated."</p>

  <p>Lawford rose to his feet, evidently disturbed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," he said. "The room has been put to rights within the
  last half-hour."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Mowbray muttered. "I thought no one ever went in there,
  Lawford."</p>

  <p>"They don't very often, sir," the man admitted. "As a matter of fact," he
  went on, "I'm afraid it is my fault. I happened to go in this afternoon and I
  noticed the chair was out of line with the rest of the furniture and I put it
  back in its place. I hope there was nothing wrong in that, sir."</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong, but it may be unfortunate. Let's have a look."</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray led the way across the hall into the reading room. The
  furniture was all in strict order. He bent over the chair.</p>

  <p>"Looks as though someone had been polishing the mahogany sides here," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"That is very likely, sir," Lawford answered. "I often carry a duster with
  me when I go round in the afternoon. I believe I did give it a rub-up. Sir
  Adam is not as careful as he used to be and he sometimes drops a little of
  his wine about."</p>

  <p>The woodwork and the leather arms of the chair had obviously been
  cleansed. Mowbray looked at them thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he asked, "that glass&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The steward smiled at him reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"The glass has been washed long ago, sir."</p>

  <p>"And the bottle?"</p>

  <p>"If it is anyone else's fingerprints you are thinking about, Mr. Mowbray,"
  Lawford pointed out, "it would be of no use looking upon the bottle for them,
  as I served the wine myself and refilled Sir Adam's glass. Still, the bottle
  is down in the cellar."</p>

  <p>Mowbray tapped a cigarette upon his case and lit it.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam did not read a newspaper, I suppose?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen him look at one or an illustrated paper in my life,"
  the man replied. "If you will come this way, sir, I will show you where the
  bottle is, if you would like to see it."</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray followed the steward into the back premises. The empty
  bottles of the day were all in a partitioned case. The steward indicated a
  half-bottle standing in one of the compartments.</p>

  <p>"That is the one, sir," he pointed out. "I know because it is the only
  pint of champagne we served to-day."</p>

  <p>Mowbray wrapped his handkerchief around his hand and lifted up the bottle
  gingerly by the top of the neck. He turned it round and looked at it from all
  angles for a moment or two. Then he replaced it.</p>

  <p>"I see, Lawford," he muttered. "Well, you can get me a whisky-and-soda. I
  don't think that bottle will be much use to Gilson or any of us."</p>

  <p>The steward seemed a little distressed as they left the place. He brought
  Mowbray his whisky-and-soda a few moments later and the look of concern still
  lingered on his face.</p>

  <p>"If I had had any idea, sir, that there might be a question of
  fingerprints, I should have been careful not to touch anything," he said.
  "You will pardon my suggesting it though, sir. There must be fingerprints in
  Sir Adam's parlour,&mdash;he came directly here as usual this
  morning,&mdash;and perhaps on the car."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Lawford," Mowbray assented. "But can't you understand that it
  isn't Sir Adam's fingerprints alone that we are looking for? I don't suppose
  they would be of the slightest use, anyhow. What the Inspector would like to
  get hold of are the fingerprints of someone who might have come into personal
  contact with Sir Adam in the club here."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid there was no one anywhere near him except your uncle, sir,"
  Lawford reflected. "There would have been no time for anyone to have entered
  the room and got away again without being seen during the two or three
  minutes that I was away."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose there would," Martin agreed. "Yet, on the other hand, if
  we accept that fact we are face to face with another impossibility. If Sir
  Adam was not assisted or hustled or carried out of the room he must have left
  it of his own accord. It is certain that he is not in the club. It is certain
  also that he did not leave the club, as those two men were talking upon the
  steps during the period of time when it might have been possible for him to
  have done so. What about that, Lawford?"</p>

  <p>The steward shook his head.</p>

  <p>"For the moment, sir," he admitted, "I can think of no explanation
  whatsoever. You will excuse my mentioning the fact, though," he went on
  diffidently, "but Sir Adam was not quite himself this morning. I had occasion
  to go into the reading room once and he was sitting looking at the statue and
  talking to himself."</p>

  <p>"Talking to himself, eh? Bad sign."</p>

  <p>"It almost appeared as though something had upset him, sir."</p>

  <p>They had reached the steps of the club. Martin Mowbray lingered there with
  his hands behind his back.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, Mr. Mowbray," the steward ventured. "I noticed that
  the letter you were speaking about with the other gentlemen, as being the
  only one which Sir Adam had not opened, was upon the table whilst you
  gentlemen were talking in the Committee Room. After you had left it had
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Quite a gift that of yours, Lawford," the young man remarked. "Quick at
  observation, aren't you? However, in this case it doesn't seem important. The
  letter was from Lady Diana's mother and she took it away with her. I am going
  over to the bank for a few minutes now. Something pretty terrible seems to
  have happened over there, although I do not see how it could be connected
  with Sir Adam's disappearance. You will know where to find me if you want me.
  I shall probably drop in here again."</p>

  <p>The steward made his little bow.</p>

  <p>"I do hope you will let us know, sir, if there is any news of Sir Adam,"
  he begged. "Somehow or other he was not what you might call popular amongst
  the servants here but we seemed all to have got used to him. At his age, too,
  one cannot help feeling a little anxious."</p>

  <p>"You shall have the news as soon as we have any," Martin promised with a
  farewell nod.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">MARTIN MOWBRAY pushed his way through the remainder of the
  little crowd who were still loitering on the pavement, passed the two
  policemen who stood on guard at the doors and entered the bank. Captain
  Elmhurst was seated on the topmost step of the stairway leading down into the
  vault. He turned his head at Mowbray's approach.</p>

  <p>"Any news at the club?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"None."</p>

  <p>"Not a word about Sir Adam?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. How about things here?"</p>

  <p>"I have sent for the old man who looked after him," Elmhurst confided.
  "Seems Sir Adam wouldn't have a woman near the place except first thing in
  the morning to come and clear up after he had gone to the bank. This old
  fellow&mdash;Dyson, his name is&mdash;used to come at seven, make his tea and
  cook his breakfast and potter around until it was time to open the bank. Then
  he came back again at six-thirty, cooked the dinner, put his master to bed
  and cleared out again. He was messenger here once but now he is simply
  doorkeeper."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find out all this?" Mowbray enquired.</p>

  <p>"From Crawshay, the younger of the two clerks. He has just gone."</p>

  <p>"Did he know anything about those stairs?"</p>

  <p>"He knows about them all right but he is as dumb as a mute. The old man
  did seem to be able to put the fear of God into than all&mdash;Groome
  included."</p>

  <p>One of the policemen knocked at the door of the parlour and made his
  appearance.</p>

  <p>"The man named Dyson whom you sent for, sir," he reported.</p>

  <p>A grizzled-haired, tired-looking man of apparently between fifty-five and
  sixty years of age, with the remains of a military carriage, came forward and
  saluted. His manner was respectful but he was very much on his guard.</p>

  <p>"You have been acting as Sir Adam Blockton's servant, have you not?"
  Elmhurst asked as he pointed to one of the high-backed chairs.</p>

  <p>"For anything I know I still am, sir."</p>

  <p>"Of course. We are in a little trouble, however, and you must help us. Sir
  Adam is not to be found and something has happened down in this vault between
  his apartments and the bank which requires explanation. You understand
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"You know, perhaps, that I am Chief of the Police for Norchester?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then you understand that you must answer my questions."</p>

  <p>"That I am not so sure about, sir," was the dogged reply.</p>

  <p>Elmhurst's eyebrows went up. The man's manner was not ingratiating.</p>

  <p>"Explain what you mean by that," he ordered.</p>

  <p>"When I entered Sir Adam's service," Dyson went on, holding his cap in his
  hand and staring fixedly at it, "he offered me good wages and an easy job. I
  could scarcely believe my senses when I added things up. 'There is just one
  condition, Dyson,' he said, seeing I looked a bit dazed. 'You will never
  answer a single question about me, my habits or my surroundings.' I was not
  making a long job about that, sir. I said straight out that wild horses
  wouldn't draw a word from me. There's a many been curious and asked questions
  about Sir Adam. Not one answer have they ever had from me."</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Dyson," the Chief Constable admitted, "but you see I
  represent the police and when I ask you a question it has to be answered. If
  you persist in your refusals I shall have to send you before a magistrate and
  you will be sent to prison."</p>

  <p>"And to prison I'll go, sir," the man declared, "before I'll break my
  word."</p>

  <p>"I hope," Captain Elmhurst remonstrated, "that you will reconsider that
  when you understand the circumstances. Sir Adam has disappeared."</p>

  <p>"He'll be here at six-thirty to change for dinner, sir&mdash;which reminds
  me that I must be getting up into his room."</p>

  <p>"Supposing he's not there at six-thirty?"</p>

  <p>"For five-and-twenty years, sir, he's been ready on the tick, except for
  the few nights he has happened to be out of Norchester and they didn't amount
  to anything," Dyson told him. "He will be there to-night and if I had been
  answering questions about his doings I couldn't face him."</p>

  <p>"Supposing you leave Sir Adam alone for a time, Elmhurst," the young
  lawyer suggested. "Surely Dyson cannot mind telling us where those stairs
  lead to and by whom they were used."</p>

  <p>Dyson considered the matter.</p>

  <p>"If you have the law on your side, sir, you will find that out in no
  time," he declared. "You don't find out from me, though."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst smiled a little grimly.</p>

  <p>"Why, you're becoming more reticent every moment, Dyson," he observed.</p>

  <p>"You're a policeman and you have a right to ask any questions you choose,
  I imagine, sir," the man replied. "Sir Adam would never mind my telling you
  what time he took his meals, that he always changed for dinner, that he drank
  a half a bottle of wine or a measured whisky-and-soda and that he went to bed
  every night on the tick of ten. I've heard him tell other people those things
  but I have never heard him tell strangers about them stairs. No more shan't
  I."</p>

  <p>"Looks to me," Captain Elmhurst warned him, "as though you want to come
  and pay us a visit at the Borough Gaol."</p>

  <p>"When my turn comes and the law says so I shan't resist," was the stubborn
  reply, "but in Sir Adam's lifetime I am going to keep my word to him."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that Sir Adam is alive?" Martin Mowbray asked
  quickly.</p>

  <p>For a moment the man was taken by surprise. He recovered himself almost at
  once.</p>

  <p>"There ain't anything ever likely to happen to him, sir," he declared.
  "Twenty-five years it is I've waited on him and never a dose of medicine has
  he needed or taken. He's had his wine and his nightcap regular, he's slept
  well through the night, he's drunk his tea in the morning and eaten his
  breakfast afterwards. A man who is in that state of health doesn't go off
  sudden-like."</p>

  <p>"Not of his own accord," Captain Elmhurst commented softly.</p>

  <p>Dyson's face became grimmer.</p>

  <p>"You're not going to tell me, sir, that anyone has done him an injury," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"We know just as much about it as everyone else concerned," the Chief
  Constable continued. "We know that Sir Adam was in the reading room of the
  club at ten minutes past one this afternoon, we know that at thirteen minutes
  past he was not in the room and not a soul has seen him since. We have
  searched the club premises in vain. It was almost impossible for him to leave
  the room without being seen by one of the other members. It was quite
  impossible for him to have left the club and yet he is not there. That is the
  mystery we are trying to solve, Dyson, and you don't seem much inclined to
  help us."</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"I'll help you with a bit of information if you're in earnest, Captain,"
  he said, "and you, Mr. Mowbray&mdash;you being his lawyer. The old gentleman
  is having a bit of fun with you. He's that way inclined. I've known him at it
  more than once. If you will excuse me I'll be getting upstairs. Five minutes
  late is a thing he never would forget or forgive and I'm not taking any
  risks."</p>

  <p>"I shall come with you," Captain Elmhurst announced. "So will Mr. Mowbray.
  We are even more anxious to meet Sir Adam than you."</p>

  <p>"You can do as you like about that, gentlemen," Dyson replied. "It's not
  my place to interfere, if you insist. You can explain to Sir Adam&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;would not that be the nearest way?" Captain Elmhurst suggested,
  leaning over the trap door and waving his hand towards the screen
  opposite.</p>

  <p>Dyson ignored him. He marched out of the bank and along the few yards of
  pavement. He produced a latchkey and opened the heavy front door just beyond
  the iron railings. For the moment he seemed to have forgotten his manners for
  he passed into the hall and mounted the oak stairs opposite without even a
  look over his shoulder. The two men followed him into a plainly furnished
  man's bedroom. It contained very little furniture but every piece was massive
  and Georgian. An open door led into the bathroom. The bedstead was a
  four-poster with beautifully carved pillars. The room was unoccupied but upon
  the counterpane of the bed was set out a soft-fronted shirt and plain dinner
  suit, and a pair of patent shoes stood on the floor. Dyson glanced at them as
  though to feel sure that nothing had been forgotten. Then he looked at the
  clock and without a word disappeared into the bathroom. In a moment or two
  they heard the water running. Captain Elmhurst compared the clock with his
  watch.</p>

  <p>"Five-and-twenty past six," he said. "Well, we shan't have long to
  wait."</p>

  <p>The water began to run into the bath. In a minute or two Dyson reappeared,
  having turned off the faucets. Mowbray was tapping gently against the
  panelled walls.</p>

  <p>"I am not very good at internal architecture," he remarked, "but I should
  think that stairway must lead into this room."</p>

  <p>"You will be able to ask Sir Adam himself in a minute or two, sir," the
  man replied.</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst threw himself into an easy chair. Mowbray remained
  standing and watching the hands of the clock. The moment came. Half-past six
  struck. There was silence in the room&mdash;silence below. Martin Mowbray,
  who was a young man of imagination, found something curiously thrilling in
  the sight of the simple preparations which had been made, the changing
  expression on Dyson's face and the tense silence. No one spoke. Dyson walked
  to the window and looked out. He came back and standing near the door seemed
  to listen. He dragged an old chronometer from his waistcoat pocket and looked
  at it. Then he glanced at the small clock. Neither of the two intruders said
  a word. Five minutes passed&mdash;ten minutes&mdash;the three-quarters of the
  hour struck. Then Elmhurst broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"Dyson," he said, "this is the first proof you have had of your master's
  disappearance, but perhaps this time you will believe us. We wish no harm to
  Sir Adam. We should be the last to induce you to risk a good place by
  breaking orders, but you see,&mdash;here is the confirmation of what we have
  been telling you. Something has happened to Sir Adam. He has been your master
  for a great many years. You must be just as anxious as we are to have the
  matter cleared up."</p>

  <p>The man seemed somehow to have shrunk. He had lost his calm, almost
  dignified air of assurance. He walked once more to the window. He came back
  and moved the position of the black tie laid out upon the bed. When he looked
  up his face was drawn and haggard.</p>

  <p>"All these years," he muttered half to himself, although he had turned
  towards the Chief Constable. "All these years and never a moment late."</p>

  <p>"Something strange has happened without a doubt," Martin said kindly, "but
  it is by no means a certainty, Dyson, that it is anything serious. Your
  master may have decided to play a little trick upon us as you suggested and
  been taken ill or he may have received news which we have not been able to
  trace and been obliged to go away, but it is our duty to find
  him&mdash;Captain Elmhurst on behalf of the police, and myself because I am
  his lawyer. I believe it is yours, as his personal servant, to help us."</p>

  <p>"What sort of questions did you wish to ask, sir?" Dyson enquired and his
  voice had entirely lost its belligerent note. It was the voice of an old and
  weakly man.</p>

  <p>"We want to know about that staircase. We also wish to know whether it was
  possible for Sir Adam to have received a visitor some time this
  morning&mdash;it might even have been before the bank opened&mdash;a young
  man whom no one else saw."</p>

  <p>Dyson moved across the room towards the panel next to the one which
  Mowbray had been tapping. He ran his fingers up and down the bevelled edge
  for a moment, paused and pressed. Then he stooped down and repeated the
  operation at the bottom of the oblong design. There was a little click. The
  panel slid open. Behind it was concealed a door with a Yale keyhole. Dyson
  unlocked it and pushed it open. The two men looked over his shoulder into the
  vault below.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam frequently made use of this means of reaching his office,
  gentlemen," he confided. "Mr. Groome was the only one who knew for certain
  about the entrance. The two young clerks might have guessed, but Sir Adam had
  tied up their tongues as he had done mine until now."</p>

  <p>"And what about that visitor?" Mowbray asked.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about any visitor this morning," was the dogged answer.
  "When Sir Adam had finished his breakfast I laid out his evening clothes,
  cleared away his breakfast in the dining room, did a bit of tidying
  up&mdash;Mrs. Griggs being away&mdash;and took my place as usual in the bank
  until closing time. Sir Adam followed me about a quarter of an hour later. I
  was due to return here at a quarter past six. I arrived this evening at
  precisely that time. I&mdash;forgive me, gentlemen&mdash;I am not feeling
  well," the man faltered. "Twenty-five years! There are his clothes, the
  bath's ready&mdash;towels and soap all in their place&mdash;and Sir Adam is
  not here."</p>

  <p>"We'll find him," Mowbray said kindly. "Sit down for a minute, Dyson. Tell
  us this&mdash;when you arrived this morning you came in by the entrance which
  we have just used?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir. I have the key for the front door."</p>

  <p>"And when you left to go on duty into the bank, what did you do then?"</p>

  <p>"I left by the same way, sir. I had to unlock the iron gates, throw open
  the doors and sit down on the bench."</p>

  <p>"Which way did Sir Adam leave?"</p>

  <p>"He left by the same door, sir. I helped him on with his overcoat&mdash;he
  always insisted upon wearing that although it is only a step or two&mdash;and
  brushed his hat before I went off."</p>

  <p>"You had no indication that any visitor was expected this morning?"</p>

  <p>"None, sir."</p>

  <p>"There were no signs in the dining room or in this bedroom of Sir Adam
  having received any visitor last night?"</p>

  <p>"No signs at all, sir. Only one chair had been occupied, only one
  whisky-and-soda drunk, only the ashes from Sir Adam's pipe in the tray."</p>

  <p>"It seems rather purposeless, but I must ask you one more question,
  Dyson," Captain Elmhurst persisted. "Sir Adam seemed in his usual spirits
  last night, at any rate when you woke him this morning, when you dressed him?
  There were no farewell words or instructions when he left?"</p>

  <p>"There was nothing different about Sir Adam," Dyson said firmly. "He was
  exactly the same as he has been every morning. It was impossible for him to
  have received a visitor without that person coming to the door of the bank
  house in the ordinary way. There was no one else, no one who knows how to
  deal with this other door but Mr. Groome, by guesswork, perhaps, and
  myself."</p>

  <p>They closed up and left the place in silence. Seven o'clock was striking
  as they reached the street.</p>

  <p>"I now suggest," Martin Mowbray said, "that we step across to the club to
  get one of Lawford's special strong Dry Martinis and then I'll come round
  with you to your show and hear what the doctor has decided."</p>

  <p>"And perhaps more important still," Elmhurst put in, "to see if there was
  anything in that young man's effects which will help us to identify him."</p>

  <p>"I'm with you," Mowbray agreed, passing his arm through his companion's,
  "but first of all our little visit to the club."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">THE visit to the club was duly paid with satisfactory
  results. Afterwards the two men drove round to the prison where they were
  received by the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Steward has only just finished in the mortuary, sir," the latter
  announced. "He would like to see you. Afterwards I have some suggestions
  waiting for your approval."</p>

  <p>"We will see the doctor at once," Elmhurst agreed. "Does he want us in the
  mortuary?"</p>

  <p>"I think he would rather come in to you here first."</p>

  <p>The police surgeon presented himself within the next few minutes. He had
  changed his linen overalls and was prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>"Nothing more that I can do, Captain Elmhurst," he reported. "The dead
  man's age would be about thirty-seven, he was fairly healthy and I should
  judge that he had lived in hot countries for part of his life. The direct
  cause of death was without doubt a bullet wound which seems to have actually
  penetrated the heart. He must have died instantaneously. It would appear to
  me&mdash;I have the notes all written down for your perusal
  afterwards&mdash;but it would appear to me that the wound was inflicted from
  some distance by a marksman of accuracy, as the course of the bullet shows
  signs of a trajectory."</p>

  <p>"What about the head injury?"</p>

  <p>"The wound at the back of the head," the surgeon continued, "might have
  been caused by a fall or it might have been the result of a blow with some
  blunt instrument of which so far there is no sign whatever. It is impossible
  to give a final decision about that unless the possible weapon were produced,
  but under the circumstances I don't think we need go further than the bullet
  wound for the cause of death. I see no alternative but to call it murder, as
  from the position of the wound suicide is out of the question. The other
  considerations are not in my line of country, of course, but it is perfectly
  obvious that the young man was in a good position of life. His nails and feet
  were excellently cared-for and the nails must have been manicured within the
  last few days. His clothes have the name of a Savile Row tailor upon the tabs
  and his silk underwear has also the name of a well known firm of Bond Street
  outfitters. That, however, the Inspector will tell you about. As I said, it
  is not my line of country."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment, doctor," Captain Elmhurst begged. "There is one point you
  will certainly be asked about in the Coroner's Court and a little previous
  knowledge might help us. You were there when the body was found. Could you
  reconstruct the crime? Do you think that the man was advancing down those
  stairs and was shot by someone in the bank parlour behind, or was he climbing
  the stairs and shot by someone who might have been hiding in the vault?"</p>

  <p>"From the spread-eagled nature of the fall," the surgeon told them, "it is
  exceedingly difficult to say. Either might have happened. There is no reason
  why the man should not have spun round even in the moment of death and his
  collapse might then have become a matter of gravitation. I will send my notes
  round to you later, before they go into the books if you like. In the
  meantime, I have a case waiting, unless you wish to examine the body. I must
  warn you that it is not a pleasant sight and unless you were well acquainted
  with the young man's appearance identification would be difficult."</p>

  <p>"I have not the slightest desire to examine the body," Martin Mowbray
  declared. "I saw it once almost immediately after Lady Diana and it was quite
  enough for me."</p>

  <p>"One moment," Elmhurst intervened. "You know that the inquest will be
  adjourned, doctor, and it will be necessary for you to apply the usual
  treatment?"</p>

  <p>"I have all that in my mind," the surgeon replied. "Good night,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He hurried off and his place was taken by the Inspector, who produced his
  book.</p>

  <p>"This will be a very difficult case, sir," he began, addressing the Chief
  Constable. "At the present moment there is no evidence of any quarrel or of
  any other person having been in conflict with the murdered man. He may have
  been, of course, making an ordinary burglarious attempt upon that curious
  series of safes; but if so he must have been shot before he commenced his
  work, as there is no sign of any one of them having been tampered with nor in
  the very few possessions contained in the dead man's pockets was there
  anything even faintly resembling a burglarious implement. The only unusual
  article in his possession was a large bunch of quaintly shaped keys. The
  vault has been thoroughly searched, without result. The young man's presence
  in it seems to have been as objectless as the murder itself, unless he was
  there as a thief."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all very well so far, Inspector. What is your idea of
  handling the affair?"</p>

  <p>"Identification must be the first thing to work for," was the prompt
  reply. "Identification may lead to motive. At present we have nothing to go
  on whatever. Identification, however, should not be difficult. We have the
  tailor's name and the date the clothes were supplied. The haberdasher's
  evidence in support can also be easily obtained. I should like, sir, to send
  these clothes up to the tailor by special messenger to-night."</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable nodded.</p>

  <p>"What about his personal belongings?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector unlocked a cupboard, brought out a little canvas bag with a
  label attached and turned it upside down upon the table. The articles
  revealed consisted of a wrist watch of good make, several odd keys which were
  a little tarnished from lack of use and a larger bunch of keys of unusual
  design. There was also a gold chain of the type which is kept attached to a
  trouser button, with a thin gold cigarette case and a lighter. Neither bore
  any initial or crest and the cigarette case was empty. There was a pocketbook
  which contained a page cut out of the A.B.C. and a sum of money amounting to
  about thirteen pounds. There was also a return first-class ticket to London.
  There was a handkerchief of good quality, but again without initials. There
  were no letters or cards.</p>

  <p>"There you are, sir, that's the lot," the Inspector concluded. "None of
  these things disclose any traces of fingerprints but I am not worrying about
  that for I fancy that identification should be easily established. If you
  agree to my sending or taking these things up to London, sir, I have not the
  least doubt that we shall discover the identity of the murdered man. As for
  the murderer, I am afraid that may be a little more difficult, especially
  under the present extraordinary circumstances."</p>

  <p>"On the other hand," Martin Mowbray remarked, "one thing should help the
  other. The extraordinary disappearance of Sir Adam seems as though it must be
  connected in some way with the tragedy which has happened to this young man.
  You don't get a murder and a disappearance like this within a few yards of
  one another without making an effort at any rate to link them up."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst lit a cigarette and considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Martin?" he asked. "I am in favour of letting the
  Inspector take these things up to London to-night. He can get back by
  to-morrow afternoon or he can telephone us immediately he knows the name and
  address of the dead man. We can get to work then at once upon his relatives
  if he has any."</p>

  <p>"I would not presume to interfere," Mowbray declared. "This is purely, it
  seems to me, a routine business. We certainly ought to be able to get to know
  the name and address of this young man from his tailors."</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable was for a moment absorbed.</p>

  <p>"I think, Inspector," he decided after a brief reflection, "that before
  you leave London it would be as well for you to speak to me on the telephone.
  I may decide that it would be advisable for you to call round at Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>The Inspector was clearly disappointed. His Chief patted his arm.</p>

  <p>"I should not think of taking such a course," he explained apologetically,
  "if this were a straightforward case, but there are one or two points about
  it, or rather connected with Sir Adam's disappearance, which suggest to me
  that we might need help. I will keep it to ourselves if I possibly can. At
  the same time&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet in some difficulty as to how to proceed. He was
  placed, he felt, in an unusual position and he realised that whilst this
  strange murder case might be capable of a very obvious explanation, the
  matter of Sir Adam's disappearance contained far more complicated
  possibilities.</p>

  <p>"Anyhow, Inspector," he wound up, "you can get the report from the tailor
  and the hosier and we will see what happens here. I won't send you to
  Scotland Yard unless I feel it to be my bounden duty."</p>

  <p>The door closed upon the man's respectful word of thanks. The Chief
  Constable pushed the cigarettes across the table and collapsed into an easy
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Much doing at the office just now, Martin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Any quantity of conveyancing work," the young man replied. "That is not
  much in my line. I am not busy personally. If this had not turned up, I was
  thinking of going down to Brancaster for a few days' golf."</p>

  <p>"As things are, of course you won't do it," his friend begged. "On the
  face of it this affair is puzzling, but tantalisingly simple. One has the
  feeling that Sir Adam's disappearance might be explained at any moment and
  also this young man's death. But think of this, Martin&mdash;think it out for
  yourself: This man is found dead in the vault. There is no shadow of doubt
  about that. Even if the body were brought there after the murder, the issue
  would remain the same. One of these highly respectable people whom we have
  been cross-questioning must have been telling us point-blank lies."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden light in Mowbray's eyes.</p>

  <p>"I wondered when we should both face that!" he exclaimed. "Now tell
  me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Elmhurst stretched out his hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to tell you anything, Martin," he interrupted, "and I don't
  want you to tell me anything, either. We must think it out separately, step
  by step. Who is telling the lie and why? Don't let us compare notes yet. We
  should only confuse one another. When you have asked yourself that question
  long enough, Martin, I think you will find it quite worth while giving up
  that trip to Brancaster."</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you something, Elmhurst," he confided. "There isn't any golf in
  the world would move me from this spot at the present moment. I'm going to
  have a mouthful of dinner with my uncle, see how the old man is and ask him a
  few questions which he probably won't answer, and then I'm off to Wrotton
  Park."</p>

  <p>"The Tidswells'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I promised I would either telephone or go over for an hour after
  dinner, and I hate telephoning."</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable played thoughtfully for a minute with his upper lip,
  from which his military moustache had long since disappeared.</p>

  <p>"I sent a message over there an hour or so ago," he confided.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;to Sir George?"</p>

  <p>"No, to Lady Diana."</p>

  <p>"The mischief you did! What about?"</p>

  <p>Elmhurst hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Martin," he said, "I don't want to come the official over
  you&mdash;in fact I am going to answer your question&mdash;but I warn you a
  murder is a very much more serious affair than the freakish disappearance of
  an elderly gentleman and involves a good many more grave responsibilities for
  a person in my position. I sent a note over to Lady Diana begging her to
  return by the messenger, a sergeant of police on a motor-bicycle, the letter
  she took away addressed to Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"Stop me when I get impertinent," Martin Mowbray begged. "What made you do
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I think that it is a letter which should at once pass into the keeping of
  the police," Captain Elmhurst pronounced. "It may be of no consequence. On
  the other hand any communication addressed to a person who has disappeared
  and who must be in some way connected with the visit of that poor fellow
  lying in the mortuary is a police matter."</p>

  <p>Martin reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're right," he admitted. "Supposing she has opened it?"</p>

  <p>"We should have no complaint to make," Elmhurst replied. "On the other
  hand I hope that she hasn't."</p>

  <p>"You must remember," Martin persisted, "that Sir Adam had not opened it
  himself. That seems to make it almost impossible that it could explain in any
  way his disappearance."</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Elmhurst agreed, "but, you see, of course, in a case like
  this, one has to think of every possibility&mdash;however unreasonable. Why
  should not that letter contain an intimation to Sir Adam that someone known
  to Lady Pengwill was paying him a visit?"</p>

  <p>"Possible, of course," the other was compelled to acknowledge.</p>

  <p>"It might have been someone," Elmhurst went on, "whom Sir Adam was
  determined not to see. This is all guesswork, naturally, but he might have
  been a blackmailer."</p>

  <p>"How did he get into the vault?" Martin asked bluntly.</p>

  <p>"There you have got me," Elmhurst admitted. "That is stark mystery and
  nothing else to be said about it, unless that bunch of keys answers the
  question. But still the first thing one would look for, bearing in mind the
  fact that a murder has been committed within a dozen yards of the old man's
  chair, is the contents of his morning's letters. Well, we know the rest of
  them. This one was not opened. Therefore I say that the police ought to open
  it at the earliest possible moment. A hundred-to-one chance, if you like, but
  I will admit that half the murders in the world have been discovered through
  one of these clever detective chaps taking a hundred-to-one chance."</p>

  <p>"Sound reasoning," Martin acknowledged, rising to his feet. "I must get
  along. The old boy likes his dinner punctually."</p>

  <p>"You see, it really does not matter very much," Elmhurst concluded, rising
  and walking with his visitor to the door, "if Lady Diana has opened it. She
  would pass on the information to us as a matter of course. The only disaster
  would be if the letter had disappeared in some way, and we were unable to
  satisfy ourselves that we had not missed the hundred-to-one chance."</p>

  <p>"More of the policeman about you than I ever realised," Martin declared
  cheerfully. "Don't worry about the letter. If your sergeant returns without
  it I am perfectly certain Lady Diana won't be obstinate when I have explained
  matters."</p>

  <p>"You see that she's not, young fellow," Elmhurst enjoined with a farewell
  wave of the hand.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE butler at Wrotton Park admitted Martin Mowbray with a
  deferential word of greeting.</p>

  <p>"We are a very small company here just now, sir," he remarked as he took
  Mowbray's hat and coat from him. "Lady Tidswell has not been very well the
  last few days and is keeping to her room. Lady Diana is occupying the green
  suite in the west wing and she left word for you to be shown up there. The
  young gentlemen and Major Morton from the barracks have gone over to the
  cinema at Norchester."</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana is expecting me, I believe," Mowbray observed.</p>

  <p>"I received your telephone message myself," the man replied. "Lady Diana
  has been expecting you for the last hour. She has been a little upset by a
  message from Norchester, and she is anxious to consult you."</p>

  <p>Mowbray remained silent. The man showed him into a very pleasant sitting
  room overlooking the park, and disappeared as soon as he had announced the
  visitor. Diana, who was lounging in an easy chair drawn up towards a log
  fire, greeted him with an air of relief.</p>

  <p>"Hope I haven't kept you waiting?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"So long as you've come that's all right," she answered. "Tell me&mdash;is
  there any news?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever of Sir Adam. I suppose it is Sir Adam you are thinking of,"
  he remarked as he drew up a chair to her side. "The other affair, too,
  remains a mystery and a very serious one."</p>

  <p>"Do you know that I received, an hour or two ago, an official letter from
  the Chief Constable," she told him, "begging me to return to him the letter
  from home which I took possession of this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew that," he admitted. "I was with Elmhurst up till a short time
  ago. He told me that, as the other affair had developed and was naturally
  connected with your uncle's disappearance, the police will have to attach all
  correspondence addressed to Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought if anyone disappeared like my grandfather," the
  girl said, "that his lawyers&mdash;you and your uncle&mdash;would take charge
  of his affairs, together with the relatives. I don't see why the police want
  to interfere at all."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that's all right," Mowbray agreed, "but there's a bigger tragedy
  even than your grandfather's disappearance to be dealt with and that is
  entirely a police matter. This fellow&mdash;whatever his name may
  be&mdash;met with his death on the bank premises within a few yards of Sir
  Adam's private office."</p>

  <p>"Well, I didn't send the letter," she said a little stubbornly.</p>

  <p>"Did you consult Lady Tidswell?" Mowbray asked.</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"We have not dared even to tell Aunt about Sir Adam yet," she confessed.
  "She really is very unwell indeed. She has not been out of her room all
  day."</p>

  <p>"That leaves you, of course, the oldest member of the family on hand,"
  Mowbray reflected. "Have you opened the letter?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I waited until you came."</p>

  <p>"I don't see any possible reason for not opening it," Mowbray declared.
  "It's a hundred-to-one chance, of course, but it might have happened that
  your mother was asking some young friend to call upon Sir Adam. There's
  always a chance that a letter arriving the same day as a tragedy like this
  might be concerned with it. In any case, if they wished to the police could
  take over all Sir Adam's correspondence. They would probably pass over nearly
  the whole of it to us to be dealt with, but they would examine every
  communication to be sure that there was nothing which might help them in
  establishing the identity of the murdered man."</p>

  <p>Diana yawned slightly.</p>

  <p>"You are being terribly legal," she complained.</p>

  <p>He looked at her quickly. There was the same tantalising little smile upon
  her lips which had mocked him once before. Somehow, at that moment, it almost
  irritated him.</p>

  <p>"Look here," she continued, "couldn't you for one second forget that you
  are Mr. Martin Mowbray of the firm of Mowbray and oh! half-a-dozen others? I
  forget their names. Couldn't you forget that you are my lawyer and just tell
  me what you think would be a reasonable thing for a young woman with a
  moderate moral sense, with a moderately just outlook on life, but not
  handicapped by any undue leaning towards principles, to do? I should like to
  read that letter but if I analyse my motives I am afraid they are chiefly
  motives of curiosity. You see, I know my mother pretty well. What would you
  do&mdash;as a man, mind, not a lawyer?"</p>

  <p>The reappearance of the smile this time was effective.</p>

  <p>"Well, honestly," he told her, "as a man I should throw away all those
  high moral scruples which make a lawyer so inhuman a person, I should open
  the letter, satisfy my curiosity, seal it up again and let Captain Elmhurst
  have it. He is only asking for what are his rights, but under the
  circumstances I don't see why you should not read it first, if you want
  to."</p>

  <p>The door was quietly opened and the butler presented himself.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, if you please, milady," he said. "Captain Elmhurst is on the
  telephone and would like to speak to Mr. Mowbray."</p>

  <p>Martin rose at once to his feet. Diana nodded acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"There may be news!" she exclaimed eagerly. "You had better go."</p>

  <p>He followed the butler to a telephone cabinet in the hall. By some means
  the connection had been interfered with and it was five minutes or so before
  he heard Elmhurst's voice.</p>

  <p>"This is Mowbray. What is it, Elmhurst?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Since you left," the latter confided, "my sergeant of police has
  returned. Lady Diana declines to give up the letter for the moment."</p>

  <p>"Well, she's a self-willed young woman, I should say," Mowbray admitted.
  "I have not been here very long but I've gone so far as to tell her that
  whether it is opened or not you have a right to see the letter and I think
  she had better hand it over. Can't do more, can I?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't see that you can," Elmhurst replied, "but the more I think of
  the ugly side of this business the less I like it. You know what time counts
  for in these matters. Clues of every sort which are wide open at the
  beginning have the knack of closing up if there is any delay. I have almost
  made up my mind to send for Scotland Yard to-morrow. That new fellow they
  have there&mdash;Snell&mdash;is just the man for a job of this sort. In any
  case, I want the letter. Will you just hammer that into the young lady,
  please? You don't need to threaten her, but between you and me if she
  hesitates any longer I shall come over myself to-morrow and demand it. If she
  makes any difficulty I shall apply to the Court. Wrap it up as much as you
  like but let her know that."</p>

  <p>"I will. Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"Quite enough for you, young fellow," Elmhurst told him. "I know Lady
  Pengwill is the wife of a coming Lord Chief Justice and that the family
  influence is enough to blow me into the North Sea, but I want that letter. Au
  revoir, Martin. I shall be expecting you some time before midnight&mdash;in
  fact, I shall sit up for you. Good night."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst rang off. Mowbray made his way back again to Diana's sitting
  room. He was not greatly disturbed by the Chief Constable's insistence.
  Diana, he felt, showed every sign of reasonableness. She would, without a
  doubt, hand over the letter even if she insisted on reading it first. As a
  matter of fact, his own curiosity on the subject had begun to work and he was
  not at all displeased at the idea of learning what Lady Pengwill had to say
  to her father. He entered the sitting room. He thought at first that it was
  empty, for Diana had deserted her seat. A young woman dressed in black,
  however, who had evidently been waiting for him, came from a distant
  corner.</p>

  <p>"You are Mr. Mowbray, are you not?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"I am Lady Diana's maid," the girl said. "She asked me to wait here until
  your return and give you this note."</p>

  <p>She handed him a square envelope addressed in large characteristic
  writing. With a curious sense of apprehension he tore open the flap and read
  the few lines.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Mr. Mowbray,</p>

  <p class="letter">I am terribly sorry but I have a sudden violent headache
and I must ask
  you to excuse me. I have taken some aspirin and gone to bed. We can speak
  again of the matter we were talking about some time to-morrow when I shall go
  into Norchester. Please excuse me: I am really feeling very ill.</p>

  <p class="letter">Sincerely yours, Diana Pengwill.</p>
  <br>

  <p>Mowbray hesitated only for a moment. He walked over to the writing table,
  drew out some notepaper and scrawled a few words across a half-sheet of it.
  He wrote in smothered anger but with restraint.</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Lady Diana,</p>

  <p class="letter">I earnestly beg of you not to make so fatal, I even
venture to add so
  undignified a gesture. As your legal adviser and as your friend&mdash;if you
  will permit me to imagine myself as holding that position&mdash;I assure you
  most earnestly that the police have the right to see the letter and under
  those circumstances you can do no possible good by withholding it from them,
  and your continued refusal to do so would involve the use of measures which I
  am sure would be distasteful to Captain Elmhurst and undignified for you.</p>

  <p class="letter">Please come down and speak with me again.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours, M.M.</p>
  <br>

  <p>He folded up the letter and addressed it. The maid was looking
  distressed.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana begged me not to disturb her again under any circumstances,
  sir," she said.</p>

  <p>"You must take her this letter," Mowbray insisted. "It is important."</p>

  <p>The girl left him unwillingly. It was a quarter of an hour before she
  returned. She handed him another large square envelope, this time not even
  addressed. One single line&mdash;no more:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">The letter is destroyed.</p>

  <p>The curtness of those four words, the ugly suggestiveness which lay
  underneath them, kept Mowbray for several moments passionately seeking for
  some other form of protest. Then he realised the impossibility of it all. He
  thrust the note into his pocket and opened the door. The butler was waiting
  in the hall. The lights of his car were already lit. The man leaned forward
  in explanation.</p>

  <p>"I thought I'd better turn your lamps on, sir, as the other car is out
  to-night. You will find the gates on the north side of the park open."</p>

  <p>Mowbray drove off with a mechanically uttered farewell. He was by no means
  an impressionable young man and at that time he was unable fully to
  understand his own peculiar sense of disquietude.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">ABOUT half an hour later Martin Mowbray, who without any
  particular reason had driven back to Norchester at a speed far exceeding his
  usual rate of progress, was seated in a comfortable easy chair in the Chief
  Constable's den. There was a whisky-and-soda by his side, a box of cigarettes
  and a jar of tobacco. Elmhurst, who had been answering an official telephone
  call, looked round to find to his surprise that his guest had not moved since
  his arrival, touched his drink or shown any interest in the tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Hello!" he exclaimed. "What's up? Looks as though you had brought bad
  news."</p>

  <p>Martin made no immediate reply. The Chief Constable lit his own pipe.</p>

  <p>"News of any sort," he continued, "would be a relief. So far it has been
  stalemate after about five minutes to every clue we have tried to follow up.
  Don't tell us you are in the same position, Martin."</p>

  <p>"Worse still," the young man groaned. "I don't know that I have anything
  to tell you at all."</p>

  <p>For a moment Elmhurst felt very official indeed. He looked at his visitor
  sternly. Something about the latter's expression, however, aroused his
  sympathy. The Chief Constable became a human being again.</p>

  <p>"You look as though you have taken a knock, Martin," he said. "Well, we
  all come up against it now and then. I fancied from the first that that young
  lady could have told us a little more than she did."</p>

  <p>"You are probably wrong, then," was the curt reply. "I don't think Lady
  Diana knows a thing about it."</p>

  <p>"What about the letter?" Elmhurst asked point blank.</p>

  <p>"The girl had a right to take the letter away," Mowbray declared slowly,
  with the air of one who is setting out the case for reconsideration. "It was
  written by her mother and was evidently some sort of a private communication
  to Sir Adam. She took the letter away with the consent of all of us."</p>

  <p>"That's quite right, of course," Elmhurst agreed, "but as circumstances
  have turned out the police demand to know the contents of that letter. It was
  the last communication addressed to Sir Adam before he disappeared and he
  left it unopened. If we are ever to get to the bottom of this affair we must
  search for a clue in every possible direction. That letter is blatantly
  important. Are you going to tell me, Martin, that she refuses to part with
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Worse," Mowbray answered. "She has destroyed it."</p>

  <p>"Without telling you the contents?"</p>

  <p>"Without telling me the contents," Mowbray repeated. "You can have the
  whole story. Here it is."</p>

  <p>He told Elmhurst all that had passed between him and Diana. When he had
  finished he took a long drink of the whisky-and-soda by his side.</p>

  <p>"There you are. Now you know the whole story," he went on. "We agreed that
  she should open the letter, read it and hand it to me on your behalf. Your
  telephone message came. I left the room to receive it. When I came back there
  was no Lady Diana. She sent me two notes by her maid, one to say she had
  retired with a headache. When I protested I received a message&mdash;a single
  line. Look at it, if you like," Mowbray concluded, throwing the half-sheet on
  the table.</p>

  <p>The letter is destroyed.</p>

  <p>"Most inspiring," the Chief Constable observed. "Hope for us at last,
  young fellow."</p>

  <p>"I don't see where."</p>

  <p>"Whatever was in that letter," Captain Elmhurst reminded his visitor
  gravely, "the law will demand that Lady Diana reveal it. It is contempt of
  Court if she refuses: it is the chance of prosecution for perjury if she
  tells a fib. You know the law as well as I do, Martin. What do you think
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's hell."</p>

  <p>"I think it's a little glimpse of the other place," Elmhurst disagreed.
  "The two things, of course, are related: the disappearance of Sir Adam and
  the murder of this young man. The girl would never have acted as she has done
  if she had not realised that the solution of both crimes is in that letter.
  She didn't want it known&mdash;well, we won't guess at her reasons. She took
  the feminine view. She destroyed the letter. It won't help her. As a matter
  of fact, it relieves us of some responsibility&mdash;you as a lawyer and me
  as a police official. She will be subpoenaed. The first question she will be
  asked at the inquest will be, 'Is it true that you received a letter from
  your mother to Sir Adam, on the day of his disappearance and of this further
  tragedy, which was entrusted to you, as a relative, by the police, and that
  you destroyed it?' Well, there you are. How is she going to get out of
  that?"</p>

  <p>"There is one more thing to be considered," Martin remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Why shouldn't Lady Pengwill be subpoenaed and asked the contents of the
  letter?"</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst shook his head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"You are not a criminal lawyer, are you, young fellow?" he observed. "Lady
  Pengwill can give any reply she likes. She could deny having written the
  letter, swear that it was not her handwriting. There is no proof against her
  anywhere and the letter is destroyed. The girl destroyed the letter after she
  had seen what was written. That's where her trouble lies. You will excuse me,
  Martin&mdash;we are more or less old friends&mdash;but is Lady Diana anything
  special to you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Martin Mowbray denied vigorously. "I met her to-day
  almost for the first time in my life. The fact that I admire her has nothing
  to do with the case."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't look so unhappy about it," Elmhurst begged, rising and
  refilling his glass. "This is a nasty business but whatever the young lady
  has done she has obviously done for the sake of someone else or for the
  family. She will realise that she has to tell the truth in time and she will
  do it. I congratulate you, Martin, if you are serious," he went on, patting
  the young man's shoulder. "The money does not mean so much to you, I know,
  but she is a very charming and unusual girl. Now, go home to bed. We've had
  enough worry about this for one day. To-morrow the great ball will start
  rolling. The London lawyers will be down. There will have to be some sort of
  inquest arranged for. Then the Public Prosecutor will be stroking his nose.
  On top of it all we shall get half the newspapers in London sending men down
  here. I telephoned to your uncle an hour ago. They are going to open the bank
  as usual. You will probably have to tap some of those money chests in the
  vault."</p>

  <p>"I don't see who there is to attend to things in the banking business
  unless old Groome pulls himself together," Martin reflected.</p>

  <p>"Your uncle, or one of the firm, will have to deal with that. Anything
  might turn up, even to a run on the bank, if the doors are shut. That's not
  our business, though. Not mine, at any rate. I've got all I can do to deal
  with the young man in Savile Row clothes and Bond Street linen and a bullet
  in his heart. Fanshawe has gone up to London to-night so as to be there when
  the shops open. Unless the information he obtains from the tailors is
  absolutely definite I shall tell him to bring a Scotland Yard man down with
  him. He won't like it but it can't be helped."</p>

  <p>"The old man may have turned up by to-morrow," Mowbray remarked as they
  walked down the hall together. "It seems just as incredible to think that he
  should have been able to find a place in which to hide himself at three
  minutes' notice as that he should have been able to plug a bullet into a
  man's heart at something like twenty paces."</p>

  <p>"Take my advice," Elmhurst said. "I'm used to these sudden puzzles and if
  you once begin to ask yourself questions and worry about them it means no
  sleep and a bad headache in the morning. Try and forget it."</p>

  <p>He opened the front door and they stood for a moment upon the step.</p>

  <p>"Good advice, Elmhurst," his young friend admitted. "I'll take it if I
  can."</p>

  <p>He waved his hand, stepped into the car and pressed the starting button.
  His Rolls-Royce glided softly round the avenue and purred its way out on to
  the street. Elmhurst returned to his den and was in the act of mixing himself
  a final drink when his telephone rang. He took down the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Chief Constable speaking. Who is it?"</p>

  <p>A man's very polite voice replied.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry to trouble you so late, Captain Elmhurst. I'm Tomkins, the
  secretary to the hospital. We had a patient brought in here this
  afternoon&mdash;a Mr. Groome, cashier at Blockton's Bank."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"The night nurse was down a short time ago, sir. She says that he is very
  restless and she thinks she ought to send for the doctor again who first
  examined him. He is asking all the time for you or for Inspector
  Fanshawe."</p>

  <p>"Is he dangerously ill?" Captain Elmhurst asked.</p>

  <p>"I would not like to say, sir," the secretary replied, "but I am inclined
  to think that he is. In any case, I thought I ought to tell you."</p>

  <p>"I'll be round in five or ten minutes," Elmhurst promised as he rang
  off.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">NORCHESTER was justly proud of its hospital. The night nurse
  who met the Chief Constable and took him to the private room which Groome was
  occupying was an exceedingly intelligent young person.</p>

  <p>"I have sent for the doctor who brought the patient in, Captain Elmhurst,"
  she confided, "although our house physician here does not consider that he is
  in any immediate danger. He slept for a short time this evening but since he
  woke up he has seemed very anxious to see someone from the police station. I
  thought, under the circumstances, I had better let you know."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Elmhurst agreed.</p>

  <p>The nurse showed him into the room. Groome was sitting up in bed and he
  welcomed his visitor with an eager little gesture. The latter took the chair
  by the bedside which the nurse drew up for him.</p>

  <p>"Thought I would like a word or two with you or the Inspector, sir,"
  Groome explained, "in case I felt another of those nasty attacks coming on.
  Any news of Sir Adam yet?"</p>

  <p>"Not a word. You haven't any fresh ideas yourself, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"And you are still positive that no visitor was passed into Sir Adam's
  room before he left for lunch?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely certain, sir. He left at exactly the same time every morning
  within my memory&mdash;half-past twelve to the tick&mdash;closed his office
  door and locked it with his own key when he went out. He didn't say a word to
  any of us&mdash;he never did&mdash;he passed out to his car and that's the
  last I saw of him or ever expect to again in this world."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't admit that, Groome," was the cheerful rejoinder. "I am
  expecting to hear of him every minute. Odd things do happen sometimes, you
  know, outside these mystery thrillers."</p>

  <p>"Nothing quite so odd as this, sir," the cashier went on. "I sent for you,
  sir, because I thought you ought to know something in case Sir Adam didn't
  return and in case anything happened to me. Maybe I have exceeded my duty,
  maybe I haven't. I did what I thought was right and I should never have
  breathed a word to anyone but for this trouble."</p>

  <p>The man paused and his visitor waited until he had recovered his
  breath.</p>

  <p>"It's about those safe lockers. There's most of them feel as though they
  were full but they're not. If I get over this bout I'll tell you why I
  started&mdash;'prying,' is what he would have called it. Anyway, I've got a
  key to his office and I have been down in the vaults sometimes during his
  luncheon hour. For a year and more something has been going on. When I don't
  know. Why I don't know. By whom I don't know. But all I can tell you is that
  gradually many of those lockers have been tampered with and some of their
  contents taken away."</p>

  <p>"This is a very serious statement," the Chief Constable said gravely.</p>

  <p>"Look at me, sir," Groome went on. "I was a strong man six or seven years
  ago. It is because this is such a grave affair that my nerve has gone&mdash;I
  have left off sleeping. I can't eat, I can do nothing but think. Someone,
  with or without Sir Adam's knowledge, has been helping himself to the
  contents of those safes. Listen, Captain Elmhurst, I have opened one of them.
  It should have contained something like sixty thousand pounds' worth of
  English notes, Bank of England notes and a number of bonds. There is nothing
  in it to-day but a few old ledgers shoved in to give the thing weight. I
  found that out months and months ago and then I stopped searching. I daren't
  go on."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you ought to have confided in someone?" Captain Elmhurst
  asked.</p>

  <p>"In whom, sir? This is not an ordinary bank, Blockton's isn't. There are
  no directors, no partners. Every penny that's there belongs to Sir Adam. To
  whom could I go? No one but Sir Adam himself, and you know what he would have
  said, sir, whether what I had found out was for his good or for his evil. He
  would have pointed to the door. He would not have thanked me if I had saved
  him from being robbed. He would have remembered nothing except that I had
  pried upon him. I am an elderly man and the pensions are entirely at Sir
  Adam's disposal. He would have had no pity on me. Nothing to do but let him
  find it out for himself."</p>

  <p>"Who do you think took away those notes and bonds, Groome?"</p>

  <p>The man was a long time getting his breath but there was no uncertainty
  about his voice&mdash;thin and quavery though it was.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam himself, sir. I have thought and I have thought and I have
  thought and there is no other answer. Sir Adam himself."</p>

  <p>"There is no sense, Groome, in a man robbing himself," Captain Elmhurst
  pointed out.</p>

  <p>Groome swallowed hard and took a few seconds' rest.</p>

  <p>"There is no sense in Sir Adam Blockton's disappearance, Captain Elmhurst.
  There is no sense in my being stricken like this when I might have been of
  some use to all of you and helped you get on the right track with what's been
  going on. It's all improbable and impossible but it's brought me to my grave,
  or very, very near it."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door and the nurse entered quietly. She gave one
  look at her patient's face and leaned quickly over him. She turned to
  Elmhurst and there was a note of urgency in her tone.</p>

  <p>"Not another word, please, sir," she begged. "I am afraid&mdash;it is too
  late, now."</p>

  <p>She pressed a little bell marked Urgent. Elmhurst rose to his feet and
  stole away.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>In the corridor Elmhurst encountered an old friend, a famous surgeon, who
  had been in to pay a night visit to a patient on whom he had operated earlier
  in the day. He raised his eyebrows as he recognised the Chief Constable.</p>

  <p>"This is no place for you, my friend," he said. "What are you doing here
  at this time of the night?"</p>

  <p>"I was sent for by the secretary," Elmhurst confided. "One of the patients
  here had a heart attack to-night and asked for me."</p>

  <p>"You mean Groome, the cashier at Blockton's Bank?"</p>

  <p>"That's the man."</p>

  <p>"Pretty bad he is, I'm afraid," the surgeon observed as they descended the
  stairs side by side. "By the by, is there any truth in these rumours about
  Sir Adam?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it appears that he didn't turn up at the club for lunch," Elmhurst
  replied, "or rather he turned up and then he never went into the luncheon
  room. Since then no one has seen him. It seems rather absurd to call it a
  disappearance, from the police point of view, at any rate, but I don't know
  what else you can say."</p>

  <p>"He's a whimsical old stick," the surgeon remarked. "There really isn't
  anything so wonderful in a man departing from his usual habits and not being
  seen for half a day. His father had a queer vein in him, they say. That old
  fellow that you've been to visit ought to have been able to give you an idea
  what's become of him. He must have been in the bank for forty years, I should
  think."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll just have a word with the secretary," Elmhurst said as he
  wished his companion good night. "He seems to want to speak to either you or
  me."</p>

  <p>The surgeon glanced at the young man who had just issued from his
  office.</p>

  <p>"It is you he wants, I think," he said. "Good night again, Elmhurst."</p>

  <p>The secretary called the latter into his room.</p>

  <p>"The night sister has just telephoned down to ask if you would wait for
  five minutes, Captain Elmhurst," he reported. "I'm afraid poor old Groome is
  very ill. He seems to want to speak to you but the nurse and doctor are both
  with him and for a moment&mdash;" he broke off in his speech. "If you
  wouldn't mind waiting just a moment, sir."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst nodded, accepted a cigarette and took up the evening paper. In a
  minute or two the telephone rang. The young man answered it and presently
  laid down the receiver.</p>

  <p>"That was Mr. Groome's nurse, sir," he announced. "The doctor says he is
  very sorry but he is afraid that there is no intelligible statement which the
  patient could make. Their impression is that he is sinking."</p>

  <p>"Poor old fellow," Elmhurst said. "No use my waiting, then?"</p>

  <p>"None at all, sir. They wouldn't allow you in. Would you like me to
  telephone, if anything should happen?"</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid the poor fellow distressed himself enough as it was," he said.
  "I won't bother him any more to-night. The only thing is, would you mind
  seeing either the nurse or the doctor and begging them, if he should attempt
  to make anything in the nature of a statement, to help him on with it or take
  it down?"</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, sir," the secretary promised.</p>

  <p>"I shall wait for another half-hour," Elmhurst decided, "in case by any
  chance he should ask for me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Upstairs, in the private ward, the nurse was silently preparing for the
  greatest unsolved miracle the world has ever offered to its passing millions.
  The doctor sat apart with folded arms and knitted brow. The nurse presently
  came over to his side. She said nothing but he understood her gesture. He
  walked over to the bedside. The last cashier of Blockton's Bank was passing
  peacefully away. The lines of his face seemed somehow to have disappeared. An
  expression of repose, almost contentment, seemed to have straightened them
  out. The lips were slightly parted in a transient smile. If indeed there had
  been more which he had desired to say, the burden of his secret had passed
  from his consciousness. The doctor, a few minutes later, faced Elmhurst
  without a qualm.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he reported. "It was not any use sending for you. He just slipped
  away looking as though he had never had a care in the world."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "we have to do our duty, doctor, but I am very glad
  indeed you didn't disturb him. I expect we shall blunder through somehow or
  other."</p>

  <p>The doctor paused to light a cigarette. He was a very human person,
  notwithstanding the philosophy engendered by his profession.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how much he told you, Captain Elmhurst," he said, "or how
  much he left untold, but I am sure of one thing&mdash;if there had been
  anything serious left on his mind he would never have died with that smile
  upon his lips."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">INSPECTOR FANSHAWE, with a neatly tied brown-paper parcel
  under his arm, presented himself at ten o'clock the following morning at the
  premises of Messrs. Ludlum, the well-known tailors in Savile Row. He handed
  his card to the reception clerk who came forward to meet him.</p>

  <p>"I am an Inspector," he announced, "attached to the Norchester Police
  Station. I have brought a garment here to see if you are able to identify the
  owner."</p>

  <p>The young man looked at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"You had better see Mr. Ludlum," he decided. "Come this way, please."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ludlum was a precise elderly gentleman none too well pleased at being
  interrupted in the task of opening his morning's letters. An emissary of the
  police, however, had to be treated with respect. The Inspector said as little
  as possible and produced the coat.</p>

  <p>"We are anxious to ascertain," he confided, "whether you can tell us the
  name of the customer for whom this garment was made."</p>

  <p>Mr. Ludlum shook the coat out with a professional air, glanced at the tab
  and nodded.</p>

  <p>"That should be quite easy," he remarked. "Let me see, Jenkins would be
  the cutter for this. Ask Mr. Jenkins to step this way."</p>

  <p>The clerk, who had remained in attendance, hurried off. Mr. Ludlum glanced
  at his visitor curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is this a criminal investigation?" he enquired. "My clients are not as a
  rule concerned in any affairs of that sort."</p>

  <p>"An accident has happened to the wearer," the Inspector replied, "as you
  would probably be able to see, if you examined the garment closely. It is
  important that we establish his identity at once."</p>

  <p>"I should think we ought to be able to help you there. Jenkins," Mr.
  Ludlum went on, turning to the man who had just appeared in his shirt-sleeves
  and with a tape measure around his shoulders. "This is some of your
  handiwork, I think. Can you tell me for whom you made it?"</p>

  <p>The cutter glanced at the number.</p>

  <p>"It's a four-year-old coat, sir," he announced. "We made that for Captain
  Denham."</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me how to get in touch with him?" the Inspector asked.</p>

  <p>The tailor smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nothing easier," he declared. "He has rooms in the Albany&mdash;Number 7,
  I think, from memory&mdash;and a place in Leicestershire. If he's in town now
  you will probably find him in at this hour of the morning."</p>

  <p>"I'll take the coat round to him at once, sir," the Inspector decided.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ludlum stroked his moustache. He was obviously curious.</p>

  <p>"Queer sort of thing to imagine the captain mixed up with the police in
  any way," he remarked. "Comes of a very good family, you know. Plenty of
  money and all that sort of thing. Customers of the firm for over two
  generations."</p>

  <p>The Inspector, who seemed to have become afflicted with sudden deafness,
  took up his parcel, saluted and made his way to number 7, the Albany&mdash;a
  journey which took him a matter of three minutes. The manservant who answered
  the bell was of the Jeeves type and inclined to be a little brusque.</p>

  <p>"Captain Denham is not in the least likely to see anyone at this hour of
  the morning," he declared. "If you will give me your card or tell me your
  business, I shall be taking him his tea in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"I am an Inspector in the Norchester Police Force," Fanshawe announced,
  producing his card. "My business is somewhat urgent."</p>

  <p>The valet stepped aside.</p>

  <p>"Police, eh?" he observed, looking at the caller and believing him.
  "Certainly I will call Captain Denham."</p>

  <p>He closed the door, invited the visitor to take a seat, disappeared for a
  few moments and promptly returned.</p>

  <p>"The Captain will see you if you will come this way."</p>

  <p>The Inspector was shown into a very comfortable sitting room leading out
  of a bedchamber. Captain Denham, a handsome young man, was in his dressing
  gown and smoking a cigarette. He looked with frank curiosity at his
  early-morning caller.</p>

  <p>"Did I understand John to say that you are from the police?" he
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"That is so, sir. I am trying to find the owner of this coat."</p>

  <p>He untied the string and passed the garment over. The other scrutinised it
  gravely through his eye-glass.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, it does look like one of my old suits," he observed.
  "John!"</p>

  <p>The valet who had been in the next room hurried out.</p>

  <p>"Recognise this coat?" his master enquired.</p>

  <p>John glanced at it for a moment and coughed.</p>

  <p>"Why yes, sir," he admitted. "It's an oldish suit but it's certainly your
  coat."</p>

  <p>"How did you get hold of it?" the young man asked.</p>

  <p>"It was being worn by a person who has met with an accident in
  Norchester," the Inspector confided. "We are anxious to establish his
  identity."</p>

  <p>Captain Denham glanced at his valet, who was looking a little
  disconsolate.</p>

  <p>"I say, is this a case that's likely to get into the papers?"</p>

  <p>"I should think it possible," the Inspector answered. "The police are
  anxious to know why the name of the original wearer has been cut out and who
  the wearer was on the night before last."</p>

  <p>Captain Denham shook his head. He looked reproachfully at the valet.</p>

  <p>"John," he said, "I told you this was risky. It's all very well to cut out
  the name; but anyone can go to the tailors, and of course they will tell him
  for whom it was made."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell me, sir, how it left your possession?" the
  Inspector enquired.</p>

  <p>The young man coughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I expect I'll have to," he replied. "It's a thing I have never done
  before, although I don't suppose that matters, but I had a rotten week at
  Newmarket just lately and bookies don't like your being short at the
  commencement of the season. I was still a couple of hundred behind when I had
  raised every penny I could. I talked it over with John here and he reminded
  me that I had about forty suits of clothes, some of which I had scarcely ever
  worn, and suggested a complete clear-out of my wardrobe and a visit to
  Hobbs."</p>

  <p>"Who is Hobbs?" the Inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"Hobbs is the largest dealer in secondhand clothes in the world," Captain
  Denham explained. "Half the clothes you see worn on the stage come from him
  and I shouldn't think there's a day passes but he buys up the entire wardrobe
  of someone or other who has popped off. A ghoul-like business, perhaps, but
  there you are. It is the first time I have ever had dealings with the fellow,
  I can assure you, but I told John to do the best he could and sure enough he
  brought me in three hundred of the best before the banks closed that
  day."</p>

  <p>The Inspector was not altogether successful in concealing his
  disappointment. He folded up the garment and remade the parcel. Captain
  Denham wished him good morning and vanished into his bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Can you give me Hobbs' address?" Fanshawe asked the valet when they
  reached the hall.</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"That's easy enough. Number 17a, Chandler Street. It was quite a good
  parcel of clothes I sold them so no doubt they will remember it. Whether they
  will remember to whom they sold this particular suit or not is another
  matter."</p>

  <p>The Inspector paused for a moment on the threshold of the opened front
  door.</p>

  <p>"Three hundred pounds, I think Captain Denham said," he remarked. "That
  must have meant a great many suits of clothes."</p>

  <p>"Besides the suits," the valet confided, "there were several overcoats and
  there were some underclothes and shirts which the Captain never fancied,
  included. However, there was no secret about the transaction. The Captain
  gave me a note which I handed on to the firm to say that his valet was
  offering the clothing with his consent. I wish you luck, I'm sure,
  Inspector," he added as he stood back to allow the other to pass out. "One of
  the assistants may remember to whom they sold the suit&mdash;a very nice suit
  it was, although the master never had any fancy for stripes. Good day,
  sir."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The Inspector was obliged to take a firm stand at the well-known
  establishment of Messrs. Hobbs. The young man of whom he first made enquiries
  declined to have anything to do with the matter.</p>

  <p>"We buy from and sell secondhand clothes to gentlemen," he admitted, "and
  although we don't see any harm in it they don't like their business talked
  about. I cannot tell you anything about the coat, sir."</p>

  <p>Fanshawe handed him a card.</p>

  <p>"You had better not talk to me like that," he said. "I am a Police
  Inspector and I am here on serious business. Do you mind fetching one of your
  principals?"</p>

  <p>The salesman read the card, stared at the Inspector and bustled off. Soon
  he reappeared with a little gentleman of responsible appearance who was
  rubbing his hands and looking slightly anxious.</p>

  <p>"What's this, what's this?" he asked. "Do I understand that you are from
  the police, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Police Inspector Fanshawe is my name," was the brusque reply. "I have
  brought a coat which I understand was sold to you with a number of other
  suits by a Captain Denham of the Albany."</p>

  <p>The little man pounced upon the coat, shook it and held it up.</p>

  <p>"You don't expect me to be able to say yes or no to that, sir, I am quite
  sure," he protested. "We have been known to buy a thousand suits a day. We
  don't say where they come from, we don't tell anyone&mdash;not even the
  police&mdash;unless we've got to. It's not business. As to telling you who
  bought that coat, even if it was sold from here, you might as well expect us
  to tell you offhand how many pairs of trousers we've got in stock."</p>

  <p>"I must ask you to give me your serious attention, Mr. Hobbs," the
  Inspector said. "This is a police affair and I should advise you to treat it
  as such. You have, I suppose, something like half a dozen salesmen in this
  department&mdash;perhaps more. I expect you to ask them one by one whether
  they recognise this garment and whether it has ever been through their
  hands."</p>

  <p>"Look here," the elderly gentleman observed with a cunning smile. "You
  don't know much about the secondhand clothes business, Mr. Inspector. I'll
  bring the salesmen, if you like, and you shall ask them and I will lay twenty
  to one that nobody remembers ever having seen that coat before. It's their
  job to forget. They sell secondhand clothes. It's what they're paid for.
  They're paid to forget, whereas other people are paid to remember."</p>

  <p>"Send for three or four of your assistants at once," the Inspector
  ordered. "I will question them myself."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hobbs smiled. He waved his hand, called another man by name,
  despatched a messenger for others. They came along, two or three of them,
  with tape measures round their necks.</p>

  <p>"Here are some of my salesmen," he pointed out. "The rest will come as
  soon as they are disengaged. Ask them what you want."</p>

  <p>The Inspector handed over the garment. They all looked at it
  carefully.</p>

  <p>"Did any one of you sell that coat?" he asked.</p>

  <p>They were quite emphatic on the point that they had never seen the coat
  before. Others of the salesmen came along one by one. The memories of all of
  them were complete blanks.</p>

  <p>"It is not a reasonable question, Inspector," Mr. Hobbs, who was standing
  in the background, declared. "Each of my salesmen, when he has a customer,
  would probably have to show five or six suits before he made a sale. If he
  has twenty customers during the day that means a hundred suits that go
  through his hands."</p>

  <p>"I am to take it that not one of you has ever seen this coat before,
  then?" the Inspector persisted drily.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that, sir," one of the seniors protested. "I expect it is
  the same with the others as it is with me&mdash;we just don't remember it.
  You should see where our secondhand clothes are packed. They are not
  catalogued or anything. We just take them out and show them and put them back
  if we don't make a sale. There's no reason why we should remember them. Is it
  sense to take up our time asking?"</p>

  <p>"The police have a right to take up your time at any moment they choose,"
  the Inspector pronounced sternly. "I am going to Scotland Yard when I leave
  here and I shall tell them my impressions&mdash;which are that you have all
  made up your minds beforehand that you are not going to remember anything
  that may help the police in their work. I expect half the clothes you sell go
  to people who want to escape recognition."</p>

  <p>"Ah, no, no, Mr. Inspector," the principal remonstrated as he walked by
  his side towards the door. "But don't you understand this? The people who
  sell their clothes to a secondhand dealer are ashamed of it and the people
  who buy clothes from a secondhand shop are ashamed of it. That's because they
  are all snobs, but it is the truth. That's why I don't think that you will
  ever trace that coat. Good morning, Inspector."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hobbs returned to the middle of his emporium with a smile upon his
  face. He addressed the little group of young men.</p>

  <p>"What business do you think we should do," he asked, "if we told the
  police all they wanted to know? Captain Denham, he may have sold me
  clothes&mdash;I never heard of them. You might have sold that coat, any one
  of you, but you couldn't remember it. We forget our sellers, we forget our
  buyers and that way the business pays. Get to your work, gentlemen. There are
  two or three customers in the place who are not receiving attention."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">SIR THEODORE MARKHAM, Bart., head of the firm of Markham and
  Sons, was a man of great influence and note in the City of London. He was the
  senior partner of perhaps the best known and most respected firm of
  solicitors in the City and amongst his clients were many famous men of the
  day. It was a great tribute to the esteem in which Sir Adam Blockton was held
  that he should have travelled down to Norchester himself on receipt of the
  urgent telephone call from Giles Mowbray. The two men were seated together in
  the reading room of the County Club, and Mowbray, taking a very exceptional
  liberty, had locked the door to ensure a few minutes of complete privacy.</p>

  <p>"You will permit me to say how much I appreciate your coming like this,
  Sir Theodore," he said. "Nothing but a most extraordinary sequence of
  circumstances would have given me the courage to beg for your presence at an
  hour's notice. To tell you the truth, we are almost at our wits' end to know
  what action to take."</p>

  <p>"Everything I have heard is most confusing," Sir Theodore confessed. "Of
  course, old Sir Adam was a crank&mdash;we all know that&mdash;but his is
  still a great name in the City and, apart from the fact that I am one of his
  executors and my firm are your town agents, I felt, from the way you worded
  your message, that if I could be of any assistance I had better come. Lady
  Pengwill rang us up this morning but of course we could say nothing."</p>

  <p>"I am not proposing to bore you with too many details," Mowbray assured
  him. "You are seated in the very chair now that seems to have its part in
  this tragedy. Twenty-four hours ago Sir Adam Blockton was occupying it. He
  was summoned to his lunch. The steward came to fetch him. He had certainly
  been in that chair two minutes before. He had disappeared. Nothing in the way
  of search by all of us here and later by the police has been of the slightest
  avail. Adam Blockton might as well have stepped off the edge of the
  world."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" Sir Theodore exclaimed. "Still, you cannot believe
  that anything serious has happened to him. It's only twenty-four hours ago,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"Other things have happened in those twenty-four hours," the lawyer
  continued. "Yesterday afternoon my nephew was round at the bank discussing
  future arrangements with the cashier. The bank is practically at a
  standstill, so far as business is concerned. The cashier, the only one who
  knew anything about affairs, never recovered from the shock of Sir Adam's
  disappearance and died last night. Before he died he told the Chief Constable
  that the strongboxes in the vault, to which he alone had access and which
  were believed to contain every form of security to a vast amount, are some of
  them empty. As regards the working capital of the bank, the accounts have
  been closed down and down till there's very seldom a cheque presented at all
  or any business done. The two clerks have control of a few hundred pounds
  between them and if a cheque should be presented for a larger
  amount&mdash;well, we don't know where to go for the money. Neither my nephew
  nor myself, although I am one of Sir Adam's executors, feel that we could
  deal with the matter of the strongroom without some member of the family
  being present. The Chief Constable hesitated to give us authority, and a
  formal application to the magistrates would certainly be considered
  premature. In the meantime, as I daresay you have read in the morning papers,
  a young man whom no one in this part of the world has ever seen before has
  been found dead in the vault with a bullet in his heart."</p>

  <p>"It is the most extraordinary story," Sir Theodore admitted. "Should I
  seem to be fantastic if I asked for a sherry-and-bitters at once? I have had
  a rapid drive down here and, as a matter of fact, I only opened my
  <i>Times</i> half an hour ago. The murder, of course, gives a most unpleasant
  flavour to the whole business."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mowbray rang the bell, unlocked the door, gave the order and obtained
  the required refreshment. Sir Theodore drank his glassful at a gulp. Mr.
  Mowbray, who had ordered one for himself, dealt with his more leniently.</p>

  <p>"The Coroner's inquest on the body of the stranger is fixed for
  to-morrow," he recounted. "No one has been able to identify him, but Captain
  Elmhurst, our local Chief Constable, sent an Inspector up to London last
  night with the coat the dead man had been wearing, which was made by a Savile
  Row tailor. The name of the maker was there but the name of the wearer had
  been cut out. The Inspector telephoned an hour ago to say that the coat had
  been made for a gentleman in the Albany but that his valet, with his master's
  permission, disposed of a quantity of his clothes lately to a secondhand
  dealer, and from them, the Inspector reports, he could get no satisfactory
  information. Quite properly he then visited Scotland Yard and is bringing a
  detective down with him to help us."</p>

  <p>"This is indeed a most extraordinary story," Sir Theodore repeated. "But
  frankly I am more interested in our client, Mowbray. The man might have been,
  in fact it seems certain that he was, engaged in some burglarious exploit. It
  doesn't seem to connect up with Sir Adam's disappearance in any way. That is
  what I want to concentrate upon. Where is Sir Adam? Is it true that some of
  his safes have been tampered with? Has he gone out of his mind or anything of
  that sort? His estate must be prodigious, far too large to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forgive my interrupting, Sir Theodore," Mr. Mowbray begged, "but we are
  up against an urgent problem which must be dealt with at once. That is why I
  took the liberty of telephoning to your house so early this morning. There
  are just those two clerks left at the bank, neither of whom has been treated
  with the slightest confidence. One of them came to my house last night to
  know what to do. I suppose I ought to have said 'Don't open the
  doors'&mdash;and then I remembered. Old man Blockton, he was sixty years at
  the bank, his father longer than that, his grandfather sixty years. To put up
  the shutters seemed too awful. I told them to open as usual and I sent a few
  hundred pounds across in case any small cheque should turn up."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore smiled ironically.</p>

  <p>"A few hundred pounds," he murmured, "to Blockton's!"</p>

  <p>"You will go there with me directly after lunch, I hope, Sir Theodore,"
  Mowbray went on. "You will understand then. Since ten o'clock this morning no
  client has entered the bank nor have any local cheques been presented.
  Through the midday exchange, however, there arrived a draft for five thousand
  pounds, brought round by a messenger from another local bank."</p>

  <p>"The devil!" Sir Theodore exclaimed. "Signed by the old man?"</p>

  <p>"Signed by Adam Blockton. I would swear to his signature anywhere, but
  apart from that, Paul Reynolds lives here, the greatest handwriting expert in
  the country, as you know. I sent for him. He had one look at it. Without
  hesitation he pronounced it to be a genuine signature. There is no disputing
  Paul Reynolds' opinion. He has never been wrong in his life. It is payable to
  Walter Ruffin and properly endorsed. It came from the Crédit Lyonnais in
  Paris. It was sent over to Blockton's Bank through the National."</p>

  <p>"What did they do about it, those young men that you say are there?" Sir
  Theodore enquired.</p>

  <p>"Well, according to the local custom here," the solicitor pointed out, "it
  should have been sent in between twelve and one when local cheques are
  exchanged from one bank to the other. The time limit, I think, is the closing
  hour at the bank, that is to say, if the money is provided before four
  o'clock the cheque is honoured. The senior of the two clerks asked for the
  cheque to be presented again just before closing time."</p>

  <p>"What about Sir Adam's chequebook? Has that turned up?"</p>

  <p>"Very little of Sir Adam's personal property has been found," Giles
  Mowbray replied, "but in one of the drawers of his desk we came across a
  perfectly new chequebook on Blockton's Bank, with one cheque missing. That
  cheque is the one which has been presented for five thousand pounds. The
  amount is filled in properly and the name of Ruffin is there on the
  counterfoil."</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble, then?" Sir Theodore asked. "Why not pay it?"</p>

  <p>"Simply this. We don't know where the bank money is. A thousand pounds is
  all that has been seen in the bank for more than a year. Groome, the cashier,
  as I have told you, died last night from shock. Just towards the
  end,&mdash;he may have been raving; I am inclined to think myself that he
  was,&mdash;he told us what I have told you about the steel lockers in the
  vault. Now, I am one of Sir Adam's executors and you are the other. With or
  without a magistrate's order I think that we should be justified in opening
  the lockers and taking out enough money to honour that draft."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore for a moment or two seemed dazed. A thin, precise-looking man
  with aristocratic features and carriage, he had more the appearance of a
  cabinet minister than a solicitor. Giles Mowbray watched him anxiously.</p>

  <p>"You see, the point is," the latter continued, "nothing may have happened
  to Sir Adam, but are we to let a cheque drawn by himself for such a sum as
  five thousand pounds on his own bank be returned dishonoured? What I suggest
  is this, Sir Theodore: that we open the strongroom up this afternoon, produce
  the money, get the draft or have it photographed and pass it on to Scotland
  Yard. It ought to be useful to them. Mr. Walter Ruffin must have a real
  existence, with an account at the Crédit Lyonnais."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, I see," Sir Theodore assented. "I think you are right. It is a
  pity there is not a member of the family here, but after all, it is not of
  much importance. When can we go to the bank?"</p>

  <p>"As soon as we have lunched."</p>

  <p>"Then let that be soon," Sir Theodore begged.</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray led the way into the dining room, followed by Sir Theodore.
  A dozen of the lunchers rose to their feet, anxious to speak to the former,
  but he waved them back again and made his way to a retired corner.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he went on, "the whole town is crazy about this business. We
  have disconnected our telephone at the office and I simply have nothing to
  say to anyone. I have read a great many of these mystery stories, but a
  disappearance like this I have never come across."</p>

  <p>"Our only hope must be," Sir Theodore observed, crumbling up his roll,
  "that Sir Adam's millions have not disappeared, too."</p>

  <p>"That is impossible," Mowbray declared. "For twenty or thirty years Adam
  Blockton has lived the same simple, cheese-paring life in his couple of rooms
  over the bank. In all that time I think he has only been absent for about a
  fortnight. Everyone knew that he was wilfully liquidating the business. He
  has had offers from every bank in the town and a great many London firms to
  take him over and every one has met with a point-blank refusal. The worst of
  it is that he took no one into his confidence. I knew no more what he was
  doing than the man in the moon. Neither did Martin, my nephew, who I think
  was rather more of a favourite with him. The place has been run for the last
  year on the most rigidly economical lines. The man who was Sir Adam's only
  regular domestic servant donned a livery at ten o'clock and became the bank
  doorkeeper. He had a Rolls-Royce and a chauffeur and although it is so close
  he drove up here to lunch every day and in the summer he took a drive in the
  country. Beyond that the chauffeur had nothing to do. The car never left the
  garage."</p>

  <p>"But how could he get out of this place without being seen?" Sir Theodore
  asked, glancing round the room.</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray was as near distraction as any man can be and remain
  polite.</p>

  <p>"Sir Theodore," he said, "I have been asked that question a thousand times
  in twenty-four hours. I have only one answer. I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything to connect the attempted burglary with Sir Adam's
  disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Do you believe the late cashier's story that some of those steel lockers
  are empty?"</p>

  <p>"Why not? There are enough of them, if they were full, to hold securities
  of sufficient value to buy the whole of the City."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore went off at a tangent.</p>

  <p>"Who was the first man to discover Sir Adam's disappearance?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Mowbray beckoned to the steward, who was hovering in the background. He
  came at once to the table and bowed respectfully.</p>

  <p>"This is Sir Theodore Markham, Sir Adam's London solicitor, Lawford,"
  Mowbray said. "He has just asked me who was the first person to discover Sir
  Adam's disappearance."</p>

  <p>"I was, sir," Lawford declared with a deferential bow. "Sir Adam was a man
  of extraordinarily precise habits. His luncheon was placed upon the table
  here every day at ten minutes past one. I went in to him and told him that
  his cutlets were served. He nodded in his usual fashion and I left, expecting
  to see him in his place within two minutes. In three minutes I went out to
  see what had happened. Sir Adam had left his chair. He was nowhere in the
  room. He could not have left the club. He was not in the club. Those are the
  conclusions, sir, that are forced in upon us."</p>

  <p>"Well, they save a lot of idle questions, anyway," Sir Theodore observed
  drily.</p>

  <p>The steward obeyed a summons from his desk and hurried away with a
  murmured word of apology.</p>

  <p>"Been with you long, that fellow?" Sir Theodore enquired.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two years," was the quiet reply. "He was a pageboy here, then
  waiter, afterwards head waiter, now manager. He has a most respectable wife
  but no family. I should not be saying too much if I were to declare that he
  was a man of impeccable character."</p>

  <p>"If I ask any more questions," Sir Theodore remarked, "I shall get to look
  as flummoxed as you do! Excellent joint of lamb, this, Mowbray. I'm going to
  devote myself to my luncheon. Your Bernkasteler, too, is excellent."</p>

  <p>"We have," his host told him, "in Lawford a marvellous steward."</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes," Sir Theodore confided, "I shall finish my luncheon
  with a little of that excellent Cheddar cheese I see upon the sideboard. I
  shall also drink one more glass of this wine. I shall then be at your
  service. Until that time, I pronounce ten minutes' silence on the subject of
  Sir Adam's disappearance. They say that you can never think and digest at the
  same time. Nevertheless, I am going to do my best."</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray accepted the respite with a sigh of relief.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">EVERYTHING appeared to be as usual when, half an hour or so
  later, Giles Mowbray ushered his companion into the bank. Dyson was there in
  his brown livery to open the swing doors, the two clerks were standing in
  their accustomed places and Martin Mowbray came out to them at once from the
  private office. He shook hands with Sir Theodore, who was looking curiously
  around.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "rather a small affair, of course, but there is nothing
  here to hint at tragedies. So this is Blockton's Bank to-day. I remember when
  that extension was opened and there were a dozen clerks at work here."</p>

  <p>"One by one they have gone, as the business declined," Giles Mowbray
  observed, "and mark you, Sir Theodore, it declined simply because Sir Adam
  wished it so. If the Lord Mayor of the City had come in to open an account
  within the last few years, Adam would only have shaken his head sagely and
  said that the bank were not extending their business. He could have had
  Armstrong's huge cotton mills ten years ago when they built their new
  factories, on terms which would have meant a small fortune for any bank, and
  he refused. However, we have told you all that, Sir Theodore. Is there
  anything fresh, Martin?"</p>

  <p>"In a way there is," the young man replied. "Come inside a moment, will
  you?"</p>

  <p>They followed him into the private office. He made his way to the writing
  table, pulled out the second drawer on the left and laid it before them.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam seems to be living up to his reputation for meticulous
  neatness," he remarked, "or else this drawer should be evidence of his
  impending departure. In the first partition here is that private chequebook
  with a counterfoil duly filled in, as I expect my uncle has told you, to a
  man called Walter Ruffin for five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore handled the chequebook and nodded.</p>

  <p>"In the second partition," Martin Mowbray went on, "I found this."</p>

  <p>He produced a rather rust-stained but elaborate key. Attached to it was a
  label: "Master Key of all lockers, to be used only in case of my illness or
  my inability to attend to my own affairs."</p>

  <p>"This becomes interesting," Sir Theodore murmured.</p>

  <p>"Here in the third partition," Martin continued, "is this envelope. You
  see upon it, written in Sir Adam's handwriting&mdash;'A copy of my Will with
  Codicils drawn up and added to at various subsequent dates.'"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," his uncle acquiesced. "The original is at the
  office."</p>

  <p>A sudden interruption arrived. There was an imperative tapping upon the
  door. Martin Mowbray crossed the room hastily and threw it open.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Diana Pengwill swept into the room. Martin closed the door behind her. She
  looked around from one to the other, suddenly recognised Sir Theodore and
  held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Sir Theodore, you remember me, I'm sure," she said. "I am Diana Pengwill.
  Is there any news, please?"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore greeted her impressively.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not, Lady Diana," he replied. "Nothing has been heard of your
  grandfather and the position has become, I think I may call it, acute."</p>

  <p>"Dear me! Something fresh. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Considering what we know of your grandfather's great wealth, Lady Diana,
  I think you will agree with me that the situation is a peculiar one. Legally,
  Mr. Mowbray and I, who are executors, are not entitled to conclude that your
  grandfather, because he has disappeared, has also departed from this life. We
  have no right to interfere with his papers, correspondence or accounts."</p>

  <p>"Then why should you?" the girl asked coolly. "I don't believe in
  grandfather's disappearance at all. He was always a buffoon. This is probably
  one of his tricks."</p>

  <p>"But my dear young lady. .." Sir Theodore protested. "Do let me give you
  this chair. No? Well, I was just going to say that the position is
  this&mdash;a cheque has been presented, drawn upon the funds of the bank, or
  rather upon your grandfather's private account, signed by him for five
  thousand pounds. We cannot quite make up our minds what to do with it."</p>

  <p>"Why, pay it, of course," the girl answered. "So long as you are sure it
  is his signature, why shouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore coughed.</p>

  <p>"So far," he ventured to point out, "we have not been able to discover any
  further assets belonging to the bank than a thousand pounds, which might be
  regarded as petty cash and a portion of which the two clerks used to play
  shuffleboard with each day and hand back intact at night. Even that has
  disappeared now and the few hundred pounds which are in their tills have been
  provided by Mr. Mowbray here."</p>

  <p>Diana threw herself into an easy chair and laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Are you all crazy?" she exclaimed. "Do you mean to say&mdash;you, Mr.
  Giles Mowbray and you, Sir Theodore, my grandfather's executors, who will
  presently have the handling of all his wealth&mdash;do you mean to say that
  you hesitate about paying a paltry sum like five thousand pounds?"</p>

  <p>"That is all very well, Lady Diana," Giles Mowbray rejoined, and his tone
  began to give evidence of his frayed nerves, "but we have not been able to
  find five thousand pounds. We have no right to look, anyway. We have to go
  beyond our powers if we open a single one of those safes. There is no
  evidence that your grandfather is dead. Until the statutory period has
  elapsed we are his executors for the future. We have no right to touch a
  penny for the present."</p>

  <p>"Anyone connected with the bank," Diana protested, "would be justified in
  paying a cheque signed by my grandfather&mdash;whatever the amount was."</p>

  <p>"You go and tell those two young men that," Giles Mowbray suggested. "So
  far as my memory serves me they have two hundred pounds to play with. They
  are all that is left of the bank. Mr. Groome&mdash;perhaps you did not know
  that, Lady Diana&mdash;it is a very sad thing, but he died last night."</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!" the girl exclaimed. "I'm sorry&mdash;although it can't be
  much of a change for him. He looked half-dead standing behind that wire
  thing. I never saw him smile. I never saw him when his eyes were not weary.
  After all, though, I have only been in the bank two or three times. Are those
  the keys of the safes?" she asked, pointing to the little collection upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"This is the master key of all of them, according to the label," Martin
  replied.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to decide almost at once what is to be done about the
  cheque," Sir Theodore intervened. "Supposing we open one of the more
  important-looking safes. In these very peculiar circumstances I am willing to
  take the risk of associating myself with the enterprise. I know the Court we
  shall be up against if anyone should at any time object to our premature
  action, and I am perfectly certain that we run no risk of being censured. I
  propose that we all investigate the safes."</p>

  <p>"I agree," Giles Mowbray declared emphatically. "A little more of this
  business would make lunatics of us all. Lady Diana, I hope you have no
  objections?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she answered. "I am all for it."</p>

  <p>"Then, Martin, open the trap door and we will go down," his uncle
  directed.</p>

  <p>The young man did as he was told. Sir Theodore looked over his shoulder
  into the vault.</p>

  <p>"Is this the place where the murder was committed?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You are going to walk over the exact spot where the body was found," was
  the rather sober reply. "This way, please."</p>

  <p>Martin descended the stairs and turned on the lights. They all followed
  him. Sir Theodore looked around him with interest.</p>

  <p>"Most extraordinary," he said half to himself. "And that door opposite, by
  the side of the screen that is leaning against the wall?"</p>

  <p>"That leads to Sir Adam's apartments. If you choose to stay and attend the
  inquest to-morrow, Sir Theodore, you will find that the evidence seems to
  denote that the man was killed somewhere about the four or fifth step, where
  you are now, and that the bullet was fired from somewhere round the bottom of
  the steps the other side of the vault. There were other wounds, but the
  doctor's evidence indicates that they might have been occasioned by falling
  on the slippery floor after he had been shot."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore continued to look about him with unabated curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Why all that large quantity of brown paper and string on the bench in the
  corner between the two rows of lockers?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have asked Dyson, the man upstairs, about that," Martin replied. "He
  could tell us nothing. He thinks an occasional parcel was sent away because
  the string sometimes has been cut and the sealing wax used, but he imagines
  that nearly all the certificates and bonds which Sir Adam was holding were
  kept by the brokers in London."</p>

  <p>"Very unusual, I should have thought," Sir Theodore murmured.</p>

  <p>"Everything here is unusual," Giles Mowbray rejoined irritably. "It seems
  as though nothing that ever happened in this damned place was ever done as it
  would have been in any other institution. My brain cannot stand much more of
  it. Let's decide which of the safes we shall open."</p>

  <p>"Supposing we leave it to the young lady," Sir Theodore suggested. "Now
  then, Lady Diana, any one of them."</p>

  <p>The girl tapped one with her knuckles.</p>

  <p>"This has had letters painted upon it," she pointed out. "'Thomas
  Stafford&mdash;Lindley Hall.' That's somewhere near Wrotton Park."</p>

  <p>"Thomas Stafford has been dead some time," Martin remarked. "He has a son,
  though. We'll see what's inside."</p>

  <p>He fitted the key into the lock and turned it. They all leaned forward
  eagerly. Sir Theodore only remained in the background, but his superior
  height enabled him to look over the others' shoulders. The door opened
  without any difficulty. There were three shelves, two little cupboards and
  four drawers. The shelves were empty, the drawers were empty; so were the
  cupboards.</p>

  <p>"My God!" Giles Mowbray gasped.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," Martin reflected, "it must be eighteen or twenty
  years since Thomas Stafford died, and I know that his son changed his banking
  account directly afterwards. Let us try another one. There is one here which
  looks as though nothing had ever been painted on it."</p>

  <p>He fitted in the key and once more the door swung open. The interior was
  fitted up in exactly the same manner. He opened the drawers and the
  cupboards. All were empty. His uncle raised his hand to his forehead. It was
  suddenly damp.</p>

  <p>"Go on, Martin," he begged. "Try two or three more. Take 'em straight
  along."</p>

  <p>The young man pointed with his forefinger to the name painted upon the
  next one.</p>

  <p>"'The Right Honourable the Marquis of St. Leonards,'" he whispered. "Lord
  Lieutenant of the County."</p>

  <p>He threw open the door. The cupboards and drawers were empty and the
  shelves bare. After that he proceeded with his task in grim silence. In
  twenty minutes half the lockers in the place had been opened. Every one of
  them was empty.</p>

  <p>"Try the old man's locker, Martin," his uncle suggested in a voice which
  he himself scarcely recognised as being his own. "There's his name in big
  capitals and you've got the key. Try that."</p>

  <p>Martin did as he was bidden, opened the door and pointed to the empty
  cupboards and the bare shelves. There was not a vestige of any sort of
  document or paper in any of the safes except an occasional old ledger of no
  possible significance. Then a sudden quaint sort of fury seemed to fall upon
  his uncle. He snatched the key away from Martin and from locker to locker he
  passed along the whole row, turning the key like a madman, throwing the doors
  open until he came to the last one. Everywhere was the same result. Not a
  deed, not a mortgage, not a certificate, not a coin, not a single banknote.
  It was a drama of emptiness. Giles Mowbray flung the key on to the bare floor
  and staggered towards the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I shall choke if I stay in this damn' place any longer! I'm going up," he
  muttered.</p>

  <p>They all followed him into the bank parlour. They found him there, seated
  in the stately Georgian chair at the desk, his head buried in his hands. Sir
  Theodore, swinging his monocle by its cord, stood a little away from the
  others looking up at the oil painting above the mantelpiece. He seemed to be
  by far the least perturbed, although he had suddenly remembered a bill of
  costs amounting to several thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"This is a strange business," he said at last, "but to my thinking, the
  discovery we have just made does something to clear up the mystery. It is
  perfectly obvious that Sir Adam, for some reason or other, has been getting
  rid of his securities batch by batch. Naturally, it would take him a long
  time, during which the bank has been kept open as a matter of form. As soon
  as he has finished, away goes Sir Adam. That is no longer an inexplicable
  thing. When a man has disposed of several million pounds' worth of his
  belongings he is very apt to dispose of himself in some fashion or another.
  Don't you think so, Mowbray?"</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray raised himself with an effort. There was a livid streak in
  his florid cheeks and he seemed suddenly to have aged.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it, Sir Theodore," he
  admitted. "I can't seem to realise anything yet. All the years I have known
  Sir Adam he has never once asked me to step down into the vaults. I remember
  there was a time when he did hold a good many mortgages of my clients' but
  they have all been paid off years ago. Martin&mdash;what about the rooms
  upstairs?"</p>

  <p>"The police have searched them," his nephew replied. "They had a perfect
  right to, under the circumstances. They do not seem to have found anything of
  the slightest importance&mdash;certainly no documents or bonds."</p>

  <p>"I should have in the two clerks for a moment," Sir Theodore suggested.
  "It may be only a matter of form, but I think it should be done."</p>

  <p>The two young men duly made their appearance. Sir Theodore addressed the
  one who seemed to be the elder.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask you one or two questions, Mr.&mdash;let me see, what is
  your name?"</p>

  <p>"Haskell, sir."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Haskell. If your companion there wishes he, too, can answer. Have
  either of you been down in the vaults?"</p>

  <p>"Never since I came to the bank, sir," Haskell replied.</p>

  <p>"Never," his junior echoed.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of anyone going down&mdash;Mr. Groome, for instance,
  to bring up any bonds, documents, mortgages of any sort, that were wanted by
  clients?"</p>

  <p>"Never, sir."</p>

  <p>"Had you reason to believe that there was a reserve stock of money down
  there?"</p>

  <p>"I always believed that there must be a reserve stock somewhere, sir,"
  Haskell replied, "but I had no idea whether it was in the vaults or whether
  Sir Adam kept it in his apartments. I think I must have believed that it was
  in the vaults."</p>

  <p>"Just so," Sir Theodore murmured. "A very reasonable assumption. Thank
  you, gentlemen. Well, I think there is nothing more to ask you. I should
  like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door. Haskell answered it briefly, then he turned
  round to Giles Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"It is the bank messenger with reference to the draft for five thousand
  pounds," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to wait for a moment," was the somewhat hesitating reply. "You
  can go now, both of you."</p>

  <p>The two clerks left the room. Sir Theodore was the first to break a
  somewhat strained and nervous silence.</p>

  <p>"My brother executor," he said, addressing Giles Mowbray, "what are we
  going to do about this?"</p>

  <p>"God only knows," the old man at the desk muttered.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We must face the situation," he insisted. "I do not mind admitting that a
  half-hour ago, before our astonishing visit to the vaults below, I should not
  have hesitated. I should have asked you to go with me to the manager of the
  bank who had presented the draft and paid it. At the present moment I must
  confess that I am bewildered. Sir Adam's millions may have gone from the
  vaults here, but they cannot have disappeared into thin air; and when one
  thinks of his career, his father's and his grandfather's before him, the idea
  of letting a draft for five thousand pounds be dishonoured seems to be rather
  a ghastly proposition. Whatever you say, Mr. Mowbray, I will stand in with
  you. We must make a decision, though, and make it quickly. Shall we pay this
  draft and debit the amount to the estate&mdash;I suppose there will be an
  estate of some sort&mdash;or shall we let it be dishonoured?"</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray struck the desk in front of him with his clenched fist.</p>

  <p>"We have been left," he declared, "in an unconscionable position. If that
  old devil&mdash;God, it's only a few hours ago I saw him leering up at that
  statue of his father's with just that devilment in his face which seemed as
  though he were up to some game! He wrote the cheque, he cleared out his
  vaults, he has done the disappearance, he must pay the price. Send the draft
  back. Haskell must mark it 'Refer to Drawer.'"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore had been looking at the oil painting and he seemed
  troubled.</p>

  <p>"It is a terrible thing to have to confess," he acknowledged, "but I do
  not see, I really do not see how it is to be avoided."</p>

  <p>Diana sprang suddenly to her feet. She came up to the table. She, too, a
  moment before had been gazing up at the picture.</p>

  <p>"But it must be avoided!" she exclaimed passionately. "I never heard
  anything so dreadful. Adam Blockton's cheque dishonoured just because we
  don't know exactly where he is or what has become of his money! You can't do
  that. That old man," she went on, looking up once more at the picture, "would
  turn in his grave at the thought."</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," Sir Theodore pointed out gravely, "five thousand
  pounds is a great deal of money. Remember, we have no clue as to what has
  become of Sir Adam and those safes below may mean a drama which has been
  going on all these years and of which we have remained in ignorance."</p>

  <p>"Well, you know he can't have spent his money," she argued. "Mr. Mowbray,
  think of the years you have known my grandfather! You cannot let a cheque of
  his be dishonoured just because we do not know exactly where he is. Tell them
  to hold it over. Give us time to do something. I will go to the bank in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>Giles Mowbray smiled grimly. He knew quite accurately the state of the
  Pengwill finances. Sir Theodore, too, shook his head. There was a knock at
  the door. Haskell re-entered.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. Mowbray," he said, "but the bank messenger can wait no
  longer."</p>

  <p>"I'll send him away," Martin Mowbray declared, slipping out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"You are going to let the cheque be dishonoured!" Diana exclaimed. "You
  call yourself his friend&mdash;and you, Mr. Mowbray!"</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Make no mistake, young lady," he begged. "Sir Adam Blockton had no
  friends."</p>

  <p>"You, at least, then?" she cried, turning to Giles Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lady Diana," the latter replied drearily. "I can only echo Sir
  Theodore's words. Your grandfather had no friends. He asked for none, he
  desired none. He lived the most detached life of any man I have ever heard
  of. He spoke to no one if he could help it. He accepted no civilities. He
  never offered any. I do not know what has become of his money, I do not know
  what has become of him, but I tell you this&mdash;if he were to walk in here
  alive to-day, I assure you that he would be astonished if, under all these
  circumstances, any one of us had taken a risk and found those five thousand
  pounds. He would probably sit down and try to think out a way to avoid
  repayment."</p>

  <p>She turned her back upon both of them. Sir Theodore, with a swift
  movement, was first at the door. He detained her for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana," he pleaded, "you are being a little severe upon us. We are
  only behaving as any two men of reasonable intelligence would behave under
  these extraordinary circumstances. If a miracle should happen, and Sir Adam
  makes a normal reappearance into life and this vast fortune of his
  re-materialises, what difference will it have made to him if, in his
  absence&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you will kindly open the door, Sir Theodore," she interrupted. "At
  once, please. You know and I know that whether my grandfather is dead or
  alive it is a sin to dishonour his memory. If you please!"</p>

  <p>She almost wrenched the door handle from his fingers. He stepped back with
  a grave little bow. The two clerks, who were putting on their hats and coats,
  stared at her in amazement. Dyson held open the outside door, his cap in his
  hand. She passed out speechless into the rain-drenched streets.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">CAPTAIN ELMHURST was not greatly impressed by the famous
  Scotland Yard detective whom Fanshawe had brought down with him from
  headquarters and who was now seated in the historical easy chair of the
  reading room of the club. He was a fairly bulky young man with flaxen
  complexion, heavy face and sleepy eyes with thick eyelids. If indeed he
  possessed intelligence it was carefully concealed. His appearance, too, was
  not improved by a somewhat singular taste in clothes. He wore a loosely cut
  suit of a shade between ginger and snuff-colour, and his overlarge collar was
  evidently chosen more for comfort than appearance. His name was Inspector
  Snell and, rather against the Chief Constable's wishes, he had begged to be
  allowed to visit first the club from which Sir Adam Blockton had disappeared.
  He had, too, a habit of repeating to himself, in what seemed almost a
  monologue, information which he had been given.</p>

  <p>"So this is the chair in which the banker was seated three minutes before
  his disappearance," he reflected. "The steward of the club, wasn't it, who
  announced his luncheon, left him sitting here and three minutes later
  returned to find that he had disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"That is the story," Captain Elmhurst remarked. "I see you have got it pat
  already."</p>

  <p>"My friend Fanshawe told me all that I know," Inspector Snell confided.
  "We had a long talk about the whole affair, coming down in the train."</p>

  <p>"I should have thought you would have been more anxious to examine the
  scene of the murder, before you tackled the question of Sir Adam's
  disappearance," Elmhurst remarked. "However, since you are here, I suppose
  you would like to have a word or two with the steward himself?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded but did not seem in any way eager.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would be as well, so long as I am here," he agreed. "He has
  been with you a long time, hasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two years," Elmhurst confided. "He is quite the model steward, I
  can assure you. Had heaps of offers to leave the club, they say, but never
  seemed to want to."</p>

  <p>"Wife and family, I suppose. Settled down and that sort of thing?" Snell
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"Precisely, but no children. His only weakness seems to be cricket. We
  have generally to give him a half day off when there's a county match
  on."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-two years," Snell repeated. "Quite a long time. Who was chairman
  of the committee when he was engaged?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, I don't know," Elmhurst replied. "I wasn't here then. You
  would like to know that?"</p>

  <p>The Inspector was mildly apologetic.</p>

  <p>"I just thought I would like to know where he was before."</p>

  <p>"I can tell you that even though I was not here," Elmhurst answered. "He
  started life as a pageboy here, became a waiter, then head waiter, afterwards
  steward and manager. However, you would probably like a word or two with him
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, just a word, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Martin Mowbray in the club?" he asked the waiter.</p>

  <p>"Not at present, sir."</p>

  <p>"Is the steward about?"</p>

  <p>"He is in his room, sir."</p>

  <p>"Ask him to step this way for a moment," Elmhurst begged.</p>

  <p>With his usual air of deference and looking as neat as though he had
  stepped out of a bandbox, Lawford, without noticeable delay, duly presented
  himself. Inspector Snell sat up and glanced at him listlessly.</p>

  <p>"Just been hearing of your wonderful record here, Lawford," he said. "You
  must have become very much attached to all the members."</p>

  <p>"I have indeed, sir," the man answered respectfully. "The place has grown
  to seem like home to me. I shall be sorry when the time comes for me to
  leave."</p>

  <p>"Not thinking about leaving, are you?" Snell asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at present, sir. Certainly not," was the quick reply. "So long as I
  am able to work and give satisfaction I never want to look for another
  situation."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a great shock to you&mdash;this disappearance of Sir
  Adam's," Snell went on. "He was quite one of your best patrons, I
  understand."</p>

  <p>Lawford's reply, although perfectly respectful, was lacking in
  enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"He was a difficult gentleman, sir," he said. "I always did my best for
  him."</p>

  <p>"I expect everyone has been asking you this sort of question, Lawford,"
  the Inspector went on in his drowsy apologetic tone, "but I've got to go
  through with it, you know. You didn't notice anything peculiar about Sir Adam
  yesterday morning, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that he seemed to be muttering to himself rather often
  and to be particularly interested in the statue just opposite. He made me
  move the blind a little, once, because it obstructed his view. The statue was
  of his father, as I daresay you know, sir."</p>

  <p>"I fancy I have heard that," Snell admitted. "You had no sort of
  conversation with him, I suppose, when you told him that his luncheon was
  served? You didn't stay to help him from his chair, for instance, or anything
  of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"I knew better," was the quiet reply. "He used a stick occasionally in
  walking, a stout ash stick. It was rubber shod, but he was quite capable of
  getting about with it."</p>

  <p>"And he said nothing to you when you announced that luncheon was ready, or
  when you came back," Snell observed.</p>

  <p>"When I came back, sir, Sir Adam was not here," Lawford reminded his
  questioner.</p>

  <p>"Of course not, of course not. Stupid of me. What wine did Sir Adam
  generally drink in the mornings?"</p>

  <p>"Clicquot, sir. We always had to keep a few pints in stock of the oldest
  vintage on the market. The half-bottle he was drinking was '21."</p>

  <p>"Did he manage the whole pint?"</p>

  <p>"Always, sir. There was perhaps a tablespoonful remaining when I announced
  lunch, and I poured it into his glass."</p>

  <p>The Inspector smiled.</p>

  <p>"And had he drunk it when you returned and found his chair empty?"</p>

  <p>"He had, sir. The glass was empty."</p>

  <p>"Good old sportsman," Snell murmured. "Well, it is a queer business. Looks
  to me as though the old gentleman were playing a trick upon you all. Thank
  you very much, Lawford."</p>

  <p>"Nothing else you would like to ask me, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see that there is anything else I can ask at present," the
  Inspector replied placidly. "Somehow, the old gentleman must have got out of
  his chair and into the street during those three minutes. Could be done, I
  suppose, especially if he had a strange car waiting near."</p>

  <p>"You must ask the hall porter about that, sir. I don't think anyone has
  thought of it before."</p>

  <p>"Is Johnson on duty?" Captain Elmhurst asked.</p>

  <p>"I think he is, sir. He was tidying up just outside the lavatory when I
  came in."</p>

  <p>"Send him here a minute, will you?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

  <p>Lawford took his leave. A moment later there was a knock at the door and a
  red-haired young man in a page's uniform which seemed a little too small for
  him made his appearance. Captain Elmhurst called him over.</p>

  <p>"We are still worrying about Sir Adam's disappearance, Johnson," he said,
  "and this gentleman would like to ask you a question."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Sir Adam come into the club yesterday morning?" Snell
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Did you see him go out?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I didn't, sir. I must have been close around, too. I didn't
  leave the hall except for a moment when the lavatory bell rang and Mr. Holden
  wanted clean towels."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what became of his hat," Snell reflected.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea, sir. He never left his hat in the hall. He always took it
  with him into the reading room."</p>

  <p>"Why was that?"</p>

  <p>The youth grinned.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman took his hat by mistake one day, sir, and it was three days
  before it was returned and he never parted with it again. Such a fuss he made
  of it!"</p>

  <p>"He certainly seems to have been an oddity," Snell observed. "Tell me,
  Johnson, if anyone drove up in a car and you were on duty, would you go down
  to open the door for them?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, sir, if I heard it."</p>

  <p>"Anyone drive up in a car that morning besides Sir Adam?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir. Three or four. About one o'clock I was running up and
  down the steps all the time."</p>

  <p>"Were there any strange cars outside?"</p>

  <p>Johnson hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"There was one, sir. A big closed car."</p>

  <p>"Where was it standing?"</p>

  <p>"Halfway between our railings and Donnithorne's Yarn Warehouse next
  door."</p>

  <p>"You don't think any of the club members came in it?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure they didn't, sir," was the prompt reply.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what time it left?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say, sir. It was gone when we all began to search the place for
  Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you tell us before that there was a strange car outside?"
  Captain Elmhurst asked severely.</p>

  <p>"No one asked me, sir," the youth pointed out, "and I didn't think of it
  myself. It wasn't exactly outside our place, either."</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Well, you'd better rub up your memory about that car, Johnson," he said.
  "You will find when there is a formal enquiry you will be asked some
  questions about that. It is a valuable piece of evidence. That will do for
  the present."</p>

  <p>The youth took his leave. Captain Elmhurst looked across at the detective
  dubiously. The latter was rolling a cigarette with some papers and from a
  pouch of tobacco which he had taken from his pocket. His attention seemed to
  have wandered.</p>

  <p>"A handsome building, this club, Captain Elmhurst."</p>

  <p>"Quite a fine place," Elmhurst admitted. "Norchester is a rich city, you
  know, Inspector. The architect didn't have to think about money particularly
  when it was built."</p>

  <p>"How long ago was that?" the Inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"Some thirty-five years ago, I should say. You will have to ask one of the
  older members."</p>

  <p>"Local architects?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so."</p>

  <p>Snell leaned over from the chair in which he was seated and tapped the
  wall by his side.</p>

  <p>"H'm," he observed. "Solid enough, anyhow. Well, if you say the word,
  Captain Elmhurst, I am ready to go over to the bank."</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like to call in next door and ask if they had any visitors
  yesterday morning in such a car as Johnson described, first, would you?"</p>

  <p>Snell shook himself lazily.</p>

  <p>"It might be worth while later on," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Abduction of an elderly baronet," Snell murmured to himself as he took
  the place by Captain Elmhurst's side in the latter's car. "Quite a little
  drama, you know, Captain. Enormously rich, he was, I'm told."</p>

  <p>"Supposed to have been many times a millionaire," Elmhurst replied. "He
  has let the bank run down to nothing now. You will be astonished when you see
  it. Two clerks, a cashier and a doorkeeper have been the entire staff during
  the last few years."</p>

  <p>"Lived over the premises, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable nodded.</p>

  <p>"Had an old woman come in to do for him, and Dyson, the doorporter, to
  valet him. Queer sort of household you'll find it when you begin to make
  enquiries. He has had every meal in the place or over at the club, except on
  the few occasions he has been away, for twenty to twenty-five years; and his
  way from his own premises into the bank, which he used practically every
  morning of his life, was through the vaults. He had a private staircase from
  his rooms leading into the vaults and a staircase on the other side leading
  into the bank parlour."</p>

  <p>"That's where the murder took place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was beginning to wonder, Inspector, when you were going to show a
  little curiosity about that. The murder is an accomplished crime and the
  inquest is to-morrow. I should have thought that would have been more in your
  line than the disappearance of Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," the Inspector murmured.</p>

  <p>"You see, the disappearance took place about&mdash;well, say twenty-seven
  hours ago. That is less than a day and a half, Inspector. You have to let
  things run for a bit. We cannot take anything for granted. We have made
  enquiries, naturally, but there are a good many people who say that we shall
  see Sir Adam in his usual place at the club to-morrow for lunch. The time
  isn't long enough yet to make it a certainty that there is any ugly business
  about."</p>

  <p>"You are certainly right, sir," Snell admitted. "I don't know what keeps
  putting the disappearance first into my mind. However, I have not wasted much
  time yet. I will just check over Fanshawe's evidence, which seems to me very
  carefully taken down, in the vaults there, and we will be ready for the
  inquest to-morrow. In the meantime&mdash;you will forgive me, I know, Captain
  Elmhurst, if I seem a trifle independent-like, but one gets ideas&mdash;yes,
  one gets ideas sometimes, and one cannot work against them," the Inspector
  concluded thoughtfully.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the bank parlour Elmhurst and his companion found a small
  but interested group of the principals in what the morning press were
  alluding to in thick black headlines as Norchester's Double Tragedy. Both
  Giles Mowbray and his nephew were there, Sir Theodore was occupying Sir
  Adam's beautiful Georgian chair and Fanshawe was seated on the staircase
  leading down into the vaults.</p>

  <p>"Sorry if we have kept you waiting," Elmhurst apologised. "I meant to
  bring the Inspector over here at once but I found it rather hard to drag him
  away from the club."</p>

  <p>They all greeted Snell politely, although it was obvious that, as one of
  Scotland Yard's most brilliant detectives, he scarcely came up to their
  expectations.</p>

  <p>"Entirely my fault, gentlemen," he confessed. "Rather an interesting
  place, that reading room with the statue outside and the chair in which the
  old gentleman had been seated. However, here I am, ready to help if there is
  anything I can do."</p>

  <p>"You have heard the story of the position in which we are placed, I
  presume?" Sir Theodore enquired.</p>

  <p>Snell nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"Fanshawe has been through it with me once or twice," he admitted. "An
  interesting case it appears to be, if I may say so."</p>

  <p>"Whereabouts would the Inspector like to start, I wonder?" Martin
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Snell suggested, "I have had a look at the room from which
  Sir Adam disappeared. I should rather like to see the vaults now where the
  murdered man was found."</p>

  <p>"Have you visited the mortuary yet?" Martin enquired.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," was the quiet reply. "Dead men don't run away and I thought I
  should like to have a look round here first."</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore rose to his feet. Fanshawe turned on the lights. They all
  trooped down into the vaults. At the bottom of the stairs Elmhurst
  paused.</p>

  <p>"You see the chalk marks, Inspector?" he pointed out. "That is exactly the
  place in which the dead man was found. Fanshawe traced them out very
  carefully when the body was removed."</p>

  <p>"Very sound work," Snell admitted. "Very sound."</p>

  <p>His examination of the spot, however, was, to say the least of it,
  cursory. From that moment, he sank still further in the estimation of the
  Chief Constable. Nothing but a strict respect for discipline, in fact, kept
  the latter from confiding his opinion to Fanshawe and the remainder of the
  little company. The famous detective from Scotland Yard wandered about in the
  vaults, literally with his mouth open, tapped the sides of the various
  lockers, peered into their emptiness, examined the rolls of brown paper on
  the bench, the string, and the sealing wax&mdash;like a man in a dream. For a
  long time he asked but one question and that seemed utterly without
  significance.</p>

  <p>"What has become of the sum of money which Sir Adam allowed the two clerks
  to play around with?"</p>

  <p>"Disappeared," Mr. Mowbray, Senior, confided. "Absolutely disappeared. In
  fact my firm have supplied the bank with a few hundreds in case of need."</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst found it hard to conceal his impatience.</p>

  <p>"You are not forgetting, are you. Inspector," he remarked, "that you are
  on the spot now where the murder was committed and it is the murder which is
  more particularly your concern."</p>

  <p>The Inspector's left eyelid seemed to have drooped a little lower. There
  was a note of faint weariness in his reply.</p>

  <p>"You are quite right, sir," he admitted, "but at some point or another
  these two unusual happenings probably touch."</p>

  <p>"The Inspector can examine the ledgers, if he knows anything about
  bookkeeping," Mr. Mowbray suggested.</p>

  <p>Snell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am very ignorant of bookkeeping," he confessed. "Any unusual features
  about the position, however, I should be glad to take note of."</p>

  <p>"I should think," the lawyer declared, "that there has never been anything
  more unusual than the conditions under which the firm of Sir Adam Blockton
  has continued in existence."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" Snell queried.</p>

  <p>"Fifty years ago," Mr. Giles Mowbray expounded, "Blockton's Bank had an
  account with practically every one of the principal manufacturers in the town
  and district. One by one these accounts have been closed. One by one the
  great county families have withdrawn their securities until scarcely a family
  except the Tidswells of Wrotton Park appear to have an account open. That
  account, I may add, is overdrawn. There is a doubt about several other
  accounts in the country districts where the entries seem confusing but they
  are trifling and in each case the balance is against the investor. Why the
  bank has remained open all these years seems to be a complete mystery. They
  owe nothing to the public&mdash;the public owes nothing to them. Two or three
  thousand pounds would cover all their possible indebtedness. The same sum, I
  should think, would cover any amounts owing to them, except perhaps the
  Tidswell account. Here we are then arrived at this conclusion: The bank owes
  nothing. It has no debts. It has no assets. It has no liabilities. It has no
  reason for existence. It is the grim shadow of a once great commercial
  undertaking; yet day by day Sir Adam, punctual to the minute, sat in his
  office and waited for business which he knew would never come. Day by day
  those clerks occupied themselves with cross-word puzzles or whatever fancied
  industry their brains could conceive. Day by day the cashier behind his desk
  idled himself into a state of mental collapse."</p>

  <p>"I had an idea," Inspector Snell said thoughtfully, "that a cheque, a
  large cheque, had been presented for payment."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. Uncle and nephew exchanged quick glances.
  Sir Theodore cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you got hold of that piece of information, Inspector,"
  he said, "but you are quite right. I happened to be present here in the
  office when the cheque was presented. It was for five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"A large sum," Snell meditated. "I do not wish to seem
  inquisitive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have a right to be inquisitive," Sir Theodore interrupted. "The
  cheque was referred to drawer."</p>

  <p>"One moment, if you please," Martin intervened. "It is true that the
  messenger took it away but on my own responsibility and at my own risk I took
  what I believe no one, not even the ghost of Sir Adam, will consider a
  liberty. I interviewed the manager of the bank through which it came and I
  paid it. I did so entirely on my own. The responsibility remains with
  me."</p>

  <p>Snell's face was empty of any definite expression yet somehow or other he
  seemed interested. He appeared to be on the point of speech when Sir Theodore
  broke in.</p>

  <p>"You paid it, Martin?" the latter exclaimed. "What on earth made you do
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Can't tell you," the young man confessed. "I just felt like doing it. I
  had the feeling that that old man would pop up again some day and that though
  it would have been his own fault he would have gone off the deep end when he
  knew that a Blockton's cheque had been marked dishonoured. You see,
  Inspector," he went on, turning to Snell, "Blockton's have more than a local
  reputation for wealth and commercial probity. They were a great banking firm
  a hundred years ago and the old man, for all his queer ways, was proud of it.
  I happen to have a private fortune&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," his uncle interrupted sarcastically, "and Lady Diana Pengwill
  happens to be a very beautiful young woman!"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," Sir Theodore said quietly, "that you have not done a very
  decent and Christian thing, young fellow. Of course it was rather forcing a
  decision to have a cheque like that plumped down before you just after we had
  discovered that the whole of the assets of the bank seemed to have
  disappeared; but I don't mind admitting that I should not have slept a wink
  to-night with the knowledge that we had let that cheque be returned
  dishonoured."</p>

  <p>"Martin can do what he likes with his own money, of course," his uncle
  observed. "It's all to the credit of the firm, anyway."</p>

  <p>"Inspector Snell," Sir Theodore went on, "seems to be taking rather a line
  of his own in this matter and I see no reason why we shouldn't take him a
  little further into our confidence. Most of the books have gone round to the
  accountants, but so far as we could gather there are no signs of losses in
  the most intelligently kept ones. The question, therefore, which perplexes us
  is: What has become of the great fortune which is known to have belonged to
  the family through these generations? If anyone were to tell me that Sir Adam
  had gambled it away I should reply frankly that I did not believe it."</p>

  <p>"Never took a chance in his life, the old blighter!" Mr. Mowbray
  muttered.</p>

  <p>"There's an old document here which you may like to examine, little though
  it has to do with the present strange position, but in this document it
  announces that five hundred thousand pounds were paid to Diana Blockton upon
  her marriage to the Earl of Pengwill thirty years ago and five hundred
  thousand pounds were paid to Anna Blockton when she married George Tidswell,
  who at that time was High Sheriff of the County&mdash;Tidswell of Wrotton
  Park. It is perfectly certain that payment of these large sums did not
  disturb Sir Adam's finances in the least. 'The whole of my fortune,' that man
  whose stone statue is outside and who was himself the son of the great
  founder of the House of Blockton, wrote in his Will, 'is to pass into the
  possession of my son Adam Blockton, with my earnest injunction that he avoids
  speculation, conducts the business of the bank in a calm and dignified
  fashion, and keeps the fortune which I have left at his disposal so far as
  possible in the hands of the family, making generous bequests to than as may
  become necessary."</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It seems hard to believe," he admitted, "that the Adam Blockton who
  inherited a great fortune from the man who wrote those words, and who seems
  to have lived here the greater part of his life, has been a secret
  gambler."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you, Inspector," Sir Theodore declared. "I am also not at
  all sure that you have not acted wisely in showing more interest at the
  commencement of your investigations in the disappearance of Sir Adam than in
  the tragedy of that murdered man. We have three problems to be solved by one
  of us or perhaps by all of us acting in concert. The first and the most
  important in my mind is: What has become of Sir Adam Blockton? The second is:
  Who was the murdered man who is lying in the mortuary, whose corpse you have
  presently to inspect, and by whom was he murdered? Thirdly: What has become
  of the great fortune which the whole world believes was at one time, at no
  very distant date, in the possession of Adam Blockton? I consider that these
  three problems en bloc present an extraordinarily fascinating and provocative
  study. The solution of them will require the ingenuity of the highly trained
  detective, the brains of the shrewd lawyer and the knowledge of life of the
  man of the world."</p>

  <p>"An excellent diagnosis," Mr. Giles Mowbray pronounced. "You have put the
  case in a nutshell, Sir Theodore. You agree, I am sure, Mr. Snell?"</p>

  <p>Snell inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he acquiesced. "I have had the pleasure of hearing Sir
  Theodore in Court more than once. He has what is sometimes a little rare
  there&mdash;the gift of lucidity. By the by, Mr. Mowbray, might I ask whether
  Sir Adam's Will has also disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"It is a pertinent question," was the lawyer's reply. "The Will has not
  disappeared. It has been in the possession of my firm for twenty or
  twenty-five years without any alteration that we know of. It is there
  now."</p>

  <p>"It might be very helpful," the Inspector suggested.</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," Sir Theodore assented, "but it cannot be dealt with until
  the Courts give a decision as to whether Sir Adam is dead or alive."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," Snell remarked, "things may happen. We might waste a
  great deal of time in fruitless work."</p>

  <p>"You must remember," Martin intervened, "that the Will was drawn up more
  than twenty years ago. The bank then was in a very different position."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Sir Theodore reflected, "it might be possible to apply to the
  Courts to have the Will privately read."</p>

  <p>"If the Will had been made recently," Mr. Giles Mowbray declared, "I
  should be in favour of adopting such a course. As it was made twenty years
  ago or more, I can see no reason for any premature action in the matter."</p>

  <p>Snell rose lazily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well, gentlemen," he said, "except for any hint we might have been able
  to gather from a study of the Will I don't think I have any more questions to
  ask before I get on with what I call the spade-work."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?" Martin enquired.</p>

  <p>"I should like to be allowed a free hand to wander about on these
  premises," the detective acknowledged. "I should like to see the sleeping
  apartment of Sir Adam, to investigate his clothing, and to have the run of
  any of his personal belongings&mdash;letters or anything of that sort. I have
  already examined the vaults. I have formed a vague theory as to how the
  shooting of the murdered man took place, and later on this evening I should
  like to pay a visit to the mortuary. While we are here, may my friend
  Fanshawe and I spend a short time in Sir Adam's apartments? And I should
  like, too, to ask a few questions of the woman who came daily and the porter
  of the bank who valeted and looked after Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"Quite reasonable," Mr. Mowbray assented. "Inspector Fanshawe, will you
  take your confrère in hand? Dyson is still in the bank and the woman is also
  waiting."</p>

  <p>"The woman, I understood you to say, sir, has not been questioned at all?"
  Snell enquired.</p>

  <p>"She was away for a few days," Martin explained, "burying a cousin at
  Bridport. She arrived here this afternoon and she has been waiting at the
  bank in case we wanted to talk to her."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps just a word or two," Snell murmured.</p>

  <p>The two Inspectors left the room, closing the door behind them. Captain
  Elmhurst permitted himself a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"If this is a typical specimen of the modern sleuth," he observed, "I
  cannot say that I am much impressed."</p>

  <p>"He certainly is not the obvious type," Martin agreed.</p>

  <p>Sir Theodore was polishing his monocle with the corner of his silk
  handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Appearances are sometimes deceitful," he remarked a little tritely. "The
  Chief Commissioner has a certain amount of faith in him, I believe."</p>

  <p>Mr. Giles Mowbray, whose appearance clearly denoted his dissatisfaction,
  rose from his place.</p>

  <p>"What I do not like about the fellow," he grumbled, "is that he doesn't
  seem clear-headed. Of course, what you said about the importance of solving
  the mystery of the old man's disappearance is quite all right in its way, but
  there is another point of view. One of the most mysterious murders is there
  to be dealt with and he does not seem to talk or think of anything else
  except Sir Adam. I should like to see him show a little more interest in that
  poor devil whose body is lying in the mortuary and get after the man who shot
  him."</p>

  <p>"Straightforward methods, eh?" Sir Theodore said, preparing for departure.
  "If you ask me, I think the fellow is not quite such a fool as he seems.
  There is the inquest to-morrow, you know. Every mortal thing he could hear
  about the murder he will hear over again there. I shouldn't say he was a chap
  to waste his time."</p>

  <p>Martin nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't occurred to me, Sir Theodore," he remarked, rising to his feet.
  "Maybe you're right."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">THE two inspectors found only Dyson waiting for them in the
  hall of the bank. He rose to his feet and saluted.</p>

  <p>"This is Inspector Snell from Scotland Yard, Dyson," Fanshawe said. "He
  would like to ask you a few questions. What has become of Mrs. Griggs?"</p>

  <p>"She will be here in ten minutes, sir," Dyson replied. "She went across
  the street to have a few words with her daughter."</p>

  <p>Snell nodded amiably.</p>

  <p>"I understand that you looked after Sir Adam for a great many years?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man assented. "I used to look after him. It was not very
  much he required."</p>

  <p>"Old service man, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Queen's Own, sir. Ten years in India."</p>

  <p>"Full pension?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir&mdash;and earned it."</p>

  <p>Snell seemed for a moment to be studying him with more than his usual
  concentration. Dyson, though he was still erect and carried himself like an
  old soldier, had lost not only the spirit of youth but the spirit of middle
  age. His eyes were sunken, his mouth tired, and their only expression was one
  of fatigue.</p>

  <p>"Rather a shock to you, this business, Dyson," he observed.</p>

  <p>"It has been a great shock, sir. There is no further news, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Fanshawe replied.</p>

  <p>"You must not worry too much," Snell said kindly. "We shall find him all
  right. I shall not require to ask Dyson any questions," he went on, turning
  to his companion. "You have done all that is necessary in that way and there
  is the inquest to-morrow. If we could go up into Sir Adam's apartments we
  need not keep him any longer."</p>

  <p>Fanshawe was a little surprised but he made no remark. Dyson opened the
  door and showed them out on to the pavement. Fanshawe, who was in possession
  of the keys, led the way along the few yards of pavement, unlocked the huge
  oak front door with its shining brass knob, and ushered his companion into
  the narrow adjoining house which had been occupied by Sir Adam. Even the
  electric light which they turned on in the hall, at the bend of the stairs
  and in the dining room, seemed inadequate to banish the cold, uninviting
  aspect of the rooms. The pictures on the walls, some of which, as Snell
  realised afterwards, were old masters, seemed unkindly and morose. The lines
  of beauty were absent from most of the solid Victorian and Georgian
  furniture. The whole atmosphere of the apartment in which Sir Adam seemed to
  have spent so many of his years was sinister and unfriendly. It was hard to
  conceive that less than forty-eight hours ago a man had smoked his pipe and
  drunk his glass of whisky in the easy chair which was drawn up to the edge of
  the hearth-rug.</p>

  <p>"A dreary room," Snell observed.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't be so bad with a big fire going," his confrère replied. "It's
  all fine furniture, mark you, and those pictures glowering at you from the
  walls are not to be sneered at. I have heard fine tales about how much they
  are worth. However, there you are. Now I'll show you the bedroom next door,"
  he added. "There's his wardrobe, there's what they call his 'escritoire,'
  there's everything that belongs to him."</p>

  <p>Snell looked around him.</p>

  <p>"This is the room, I suppose, then," he enquired, "with the secret
  staircase leading down into the vault?"</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind," Snell asked, "opening the panel and showing me how the
  whole thing works?"</p>

  <p>His companion obeyed. Snell stood on the top stair and looked across at
  the dimly seen ladder staircase on the other side of the vault.</p>

  <p>"I rather fancy myself with the right type of revolver," he observed, "but
  it's pretty good shooting to put a bullet through a man's shoulderblade into
  his heart from here. That accounts for the trajectory, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"You will hear all about that at the inquest."</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell seemed a little weary. He leaned against the wall and
  looked around him again.</p>

  <p>"There's one other light, isn't there?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>Fanshawe stooped and turned it on. The place was now dimly but adequately
  illuminated. The Inspector surveyed it for several minutes, still leaning
  against the wall, although his eyes seemed thoroughly awake and the droop of
  that left eyelid just then was certainly less marked.</p>

  <p>"Those individual safes must have cost a pretty penny," he remarked. "They
  look like giant lockers in a golf club-house."</p>

  <p>"They're solid enough," his companion assured him. "Many of them have the
  names of the old county families who kept their securities here painted on
  them."</p>

  <p>Snell descended to the stone floor and walked across to the chalk marks
  where the murdered man had lain. Then he walked back again, carefully pacing
  his steps.</p>

  <p>"How long did you say the doctor thought the man had been dead?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Some little time. We worked it out that the murder itself might have
  happened any time between nine o'clock at night and the time the bank opened
  the next morning."</p>

  <p>"And Sir Adam was seated all the morning in the bank parlour only a few
  yards away. Pretty good nerve, as he must have known that the corpse was
  there the whole of the time."</p>

  <p>"He had nerve enough for anything," Fanshawe asserted. "A dry as dust,
  monkey-faced sort of creature, Sir Adam. I can't imagine him scared of the
  Devil himself."</p>

  <p>"And he went in to lunch," Snell continued, "leaving that nasty mess
  there."</p>

  <p>"Must have."</p>

  <p>The visitor from Scotland Yard nodded and returned to the rooms.</p>

  <p>"I'm beginning to get it into my head," he said. "Of course your stuff
  will come out at the inquest, Fanshawe, and the doctor will be there, so I
  shan't bother you with many more questions. What were the old gentleman's
  habits in the evening?"</p>

  <p>"Changed for dinner every night of his life, ate pretty hearty, drank a
  couple of glasses of light wine, smoked a pipe and took a drop of whisky
  before he got into bed."</p>

  <p>"What about his clothes that he wore the night before last?" Snell
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"They're up at the Town Hall, the whole drawerful of them. They will be on
  view to-morrow at the inquest. Not a stain on them or a fingerprint."</p>

  <p>"And what about the gun?"</p>

  <p>"We've searched every inch of the place. Not a sign of it."</p>

  <p>"Or cartridges?"</p>

  <p>"Or cartridges."</p>

  <p>There was a tap at the door. Fanshawe crossed the room and opened it. An
  elderly grey-haired woman, neatly dressed and of highly respectable
  appearance, presented herself. Fanshawe escorted her to an easy chair.</p>

  <p>"This is Mrs. Griggs," he announced. "You will probably see her at the
  inquest to-morrow, but if there is any question you would like to ask her I
  am sure she would be glad to tell you anything she could."</p>

  <p>"Well, as Mrs. Griggs was away," Snell observed, "I don't suppose there is
  very much she can tell us. When was the last time you saw Sir Adam?"</p>

  <p>"Friday morning, when I came to clear up, sir," she replied. "I had just
  heard the news about my cousin then and I begged for leave to go to the
  funeral and return to-day."</p>

  <p>"Pretty much as usual then, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"He never varied much, the old gentleman didn't."</p>

  <p>"And you have been with him for how long, Mrs. Griggs?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-six years," she answered. "Half a lifetime, so to speak."</p>

  <p>"Twenty-six years," Snell repeated thoughtfully. "Did he strike you as
  being a kind-hearted man?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, he did not," she admitted. "I have never known him go out of his
  way to say a kind thing about anybody or do a kind action, for that matter,
  which is a hard thing to say if anything should have happened to the old
  gentleman. It is the truth, all the same. He gave his Christmas box and his
  holiday money once a year, but he gave it without a smile, and as to his old
  clothes&mdash;I have a son they would just have fitted but I nearly lost my
  place once when I ventured to give him a pair of socks that I had darned six
  times."</p>

  <p>"Bad as that, eh?" Snell murmured.</p>

  <p>"He was not a pleasant gentleman, dead though he may be," Mrs. Griggs
  declared. "At the same time, one is bound to be honest and he was not a man I
  should have put down as likely to do anyone else an injury. He was fair in
  his way, though mean."</p>

  <p>"I am not asking you questions in the name of the law now," Snell said
  quietly, almost casually. "This is just a friendly conversation, Mrs. Griggs.
  I am not a lawyer and I doubt whether I shall be at the inquest to-morrow
  when you are in the box, so you can answer me quite frankly if you want to
  and if you don't I shan't press it. You say that you do not think he was the
  sort of man who would do anyone else an injury? You do not think, then, that
  he was the sort of man who would commit a murder?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Griggs hesitated for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," she acknowledged, "if he believed that that man down in the
  cellar was a burglar he would shoot and he would be as likely to kill him as
  not," she said. "He had courage, had Sir Adam. He was as brave as they made
  them&mdash;hard-fibred, heartless."</p>

  <p>"That's just how it looks to an ordinary person," Snell reflected. "Sir
  Adam, awakened by a noise, opens the door here, disturbs the burglar who had
  just come down the stairs from the bank parlour. Sir Adam calls out to him.
  The man turns round, meaning to escape. Sir Adam shoots and kills him. That's
  all right. But why make a secret of it? A wealthy banker who discovers a
  robber in a cellar full of safes has a perfect right to shoot. Why make a
  secret of it and then disappear is what I cannot understand."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Griggs nodded her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"That's what does seem to want a bit of explaining, sir," she
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"I sometimes think," the Inspector mused, "that criminals and men like Sir
  Adam with a little kink in them, as he must have had, do these things just to
  make it difficult for us poor policemen, whose job it is to find out about
  them. Sat there all the morning in his office, a matter of twenty feet away
  from a man he had either killed himself or knew to be lying there dead. Not a
  word to the clerks or the hall porter or to his cashier. Just as usual, they
  say he was that morning. Off to the club for his lunch, drank his bottle of
  wine and there down in the vault all the time was this dead body. It's
  puzzling, Mrs. Griggs. Now wouldn't you admit that yourself, if you were a
  detective? Puzzling."</p>

  <p>"You're right, sir," Mrs. Griggs agreed. "How you gentlemen find out about
  these things sometimes I can't imagine, but this is a fair knock-out."</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell rose to his feet, walked the length of the room and back
  again. He paused to admire the sideboard&mdash;a beautiful Jacobean piece of
  furniture, although not in the best of condition. Then he turned round as
  though he had suddenly remembered his companion.</p>

  <p>"Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Griggs," he said. "I have nothing more to
  ask you. I daresay you will be tired of questions by this time
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>The woman prepared to take her departure.</p>

  <p>"It won't be the first time as I have been in a Coroner's Court, sir," she
  confided. "It was not exactly a murder case before&mdash;it was an
  accident&mdash;but I'll never forget how those insurance people did try to
  badger me. Good night, sir."</p>

  <p>Fanshawe opened the door and Mrs. Griggs took her leave. Snell made his
  way once more down the staircase into the vault. He hesitated for a moment,
  then he moved over to the bench with its rolls of paper and string and
  sealing wax. From there he glanced at the staircase leading into the bank
  parlour.</p>

  <p>"Queer to think of the old boy down here making parcels of his own
  property to send away somewhere."</p>

  <p>"It's queerer still," Fanshawe pointed out, "to imagine where he was
  sending them to and why he didn't let the clerks do it all. Of course, what's
  bothering the lawyers so much is that he seems to have sent them away without
  making any entry about it."</p>

  <p>"The old fox must have been up to some queer trick! Looks as though he or
  someone had had one of these rolls of brown paper down with the idea of using
  it, I suppose, and then changed his mind and put it back again," he remarked,
  leaning over the bench to examine the roll in question.</p>

  <p>Inspector Fanshawe was not interested. He fidgeted about in the background
  for several minutes whilst his companion was opening and closing one or two
  of the nearest lockers. Suddenly the latter turned round.</p>

  <p>"Do a little job for me, Fanshawe?" he asked. "I don't suppose it's any
  good, but it's an idea."</p>

  <p>"Say the word."</p>

  <p>"Got your watch on?"</p>

  <p>"Surely. If you want to know, it's exactly five and twenty minutes to
  six."</p>

  <p>"I would like you," Snell said, "to go slowly up the stairs into Sir
  Adam's room about the pace he would go, then go down the house stairs into
  the passage, open the door and go as far as the bank. They are closed now, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"I daresay I could get in."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that. Wait outside the gate exactly two minutes, then
  come back here and let me know how long it has taken you."</p>

  <p>"You're kidding!" Fanshawe observed incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Honour bright, I'm not," the other assured him.</p>

  <p>"Righto, I'm off," Fanshawe declared, looking once more at his watch.
  "I'll let you know exactly."</p>

  <p>Snell listened to the retreating footsteps, standing halfway up the
  stairs, and waited until he heard the front door opened and closed. Then he
  stepped swiftly back to the bench, drew from his pocket a pair of
  queer-coloured gloves, put them on with lightning-like speed and leaned over
  the rolls of brown paper. He pushed them this way and that, apparently
  recklessly, until he came to the trestle bench itself. He stooped underneath
  and struck the planks a hard blow with his clenched fist. A large knot in the
  wood was displaced by the shock. He drew it out, thrust his forefinger down
  the cavity, pushed, and a section of the bench slid back. Another and
  somewhat larger cavity was disclosed, from which he drew out a small Smith
  and Wesson revolver of the latest type. He held it gingerly by the barrels
  and with a piece of brown paper which he had already detached wrapped it up
  and slipped it into his hip pocket. Then he replaced the knot and the rolls
  of brown paper upon the bench and hurried across the room. When Fanshawe
  reappeared Snell was lying at the foot of the stairs at the other end of the
  vault, very much in the position in which the dead man had been found.</p>

  <p>"Just four minutes," Fanshawe called down. "What the mischief are you
  doing over there?"</p>

  <p>Snell smiled enigmatically as he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I knew there was a snag in it," he remarked. "I have wasted four minutes
  of your time and my own. I've had enough of this place, Fanshawe, and more
  than enough of this cellar," he added, lumbering up the stars. "I suppose we
  couldn't manage a little drink before we go back?"</p>

  <p>The local man grinned.</p>

  <p>"I'll show you," he said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16"
     name="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">TO those who attended the Coroner's Inquest on the following
  day in the spirit of paying a visit to a cinema film laden with thrills, or a
  prize fight between two world champions, it was without doubt a washout. The
  fact that no suspected criminal had yet been discovered and that no vital
  clues to his or her identity had been even whispered about probably robbed
  the affair of a certain amount of sensation. Sir Theodore, perhaps, summed up
  the general opinion afterwards when he described it as "a puzzling function."
  There was, however, certainly something of a thrill when Lady Diana
  Pengwill's name was called and she stepped into the box. The Coroner swung
  round towards her with a kindly look upon his face. He wasted no time in
  beating about the bush.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana," he said, "it appears from the evidence that there was one
  private letter amongst the correspondence received by Sir Adam on the morning
  of his disappearance which he did not open. You are aware of that fact, I
  believe?"</p>

  <p>"I am aware of it," she assented.</p>

  <p>"That private letter was addressed to Sir Adam in your mother's
  handwriting. Am I right in assuming that?"</p>

  <p>"Quite right."</p>

  <p>"You being the only member of the family on the spot," the Coroner went
  on, "the letter was handed to you."</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"Did you open it?"</p>

  <p>"I did."</p>

  <p>"You have perhaps brought it with you this morning?"</p>

  <p>"I have not."</p>

  <p>The Coroner's eyebrows were gently lifted.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana," he continued, "you will understand that this enquiry is
  being held with a view to clearing up a great tragedy. A man was found
  murdered in the vaults of your grandfather's bank. Any correspondence he
  received that morning is of interest to the law. I must ask you to tell the
  Court what the contents of that letter were."</p>

  <p>"You already know that it was from my mother, Lady Pengwill," the girl
  answered. "Is that not proof that it was a private letter and could have had
  nothing to do with this affair?"</p>

  <p>"We may accept that when we have had an opportunity of reading the
  letter."</p>

  <p>"That is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana, we have every sympathy with you and the anxiety you are
  naturally feeling," the Coroner went on, "but at the same time the Court
  feels that it has a right to see that letter and I am afraid that I must
  insist upon your producing it."</p>

  <p>"That is also impossible, sir," Diana repeated. "I have destroyed the
  letter."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur in Court. Diana seemed very much at her ease but
  on the other hand there was a tenseness about her words which was somewhat
  incomprehensible.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me why you destroyed it?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>Diana hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Because there was something in it," she acknowledged, "which the family
  would not desire to have made public."</p>

  <p>"Again, Lady Diana, I must assure you that the Court has every sympathy
  with you and your family in this unfortunate happening but in the interests
  of the law I must require you to tell me what there was in your mother's
  letter which induced you to destroy it rather than bring it into Court as was
  your duty."</p>

  <p>The girl made no reply. The Coroner waited for a few moments. When he
  spoke again his tone had lost its note of sympathy. He had become simply an
  official.</p>

  <p>"You heard my question?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I heard it."</p>

  <p>"Be so good as to answer it."</p>

  <p>"I cannot," was the firm reply. "It is not my intention to inform anyone
  of the contents of that letter. It consisted of a few private words written
  by my mother to my grandfather. It is nobody else's business what she said.
  If it is any satisfaction to the Court, I must remind you that I am on my
  oath and I assure you that it could have had no connection with this
  tragedy."</p>

  <p>The Coroner leaned over and whispered to the clerk. The clerk whispered
  back again. There was a brief pause during which a great deal of whispering
  went on in the Court. The Coroner's benign expression was gone. He was
  looking very severe indeed.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana Pengwill," he said, "I am addressing you in the name of the
  law. I have to tell you that it is your duty to answer my question. If you
  fail to do so it may be my painful duty to decide that you have been guilty
  of contempt of Court."</p>

  <p>"I have every respect for the Court," the girl said, "but I shall not tell
  you what was in my mother's letter."</p>

  <p>"You are aware," the Coroner confided, "that I can commit you to prison
  and keep you there until you change your mind?"</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray rose suddenly from his place at the solicitors' table.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Coroner," he said, "may I call your attention to the fact that this
  is a Coroner's Inquest and not a Court of Enquiry, and that there is no
  prisoner at the present moment in the dock whose guilt or innocence could be
  influenced by anything that was contained in the letter referred to? That
  being the case, might I in all deference to your decision, sir, suggest that
  you would be within your rights in binding Lady Diana over to give evidence
  at any further enquiry there may be into these unfortunate circumstances. If
  such enquiry should turn out to be a trial for murder, you can then use
  whatever means seem good to you for enforcing a decision."</p>

  <p>The Coroner inclined his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"I see your point, Mr. Mowbray," he admitted. "It is quite true that the
  letter loses some of its significance until someone or other is charged with
  the crime. Under these circumstances," he added, turning to Diana, "you will
  remain in the Court when the case is closed and you will be bound over to
  appear when required either at an adjournment of this inquest or any further
  proceedings. You may stand down."</p>

  <p>Diana retreated and there were some amongst her friends who declared that
  they saw a faint gesture of badinage about the lips and the muscles of her
  face which reminded them of her grandfather in one of his Puck-like moods.
  Nevertheless, she had succeeded in exciting the curiosity of the Court. There
  were a good many who wondered very much what that particular thing was which
  her mother had written to the missing man of so secret a nature that her
  daughter had refused to disclose it. Then a further ripple of sensation
  diverted the public interest. For the first time, the disappearance of Adam
  Blockton was formally admitted. The Chief Constable, in a few words,
  explained that it had been impossible to serve a subpoena upon Sir Adam as
  they were unable to discover his whereabouts. In reply to a second question,
  he made a statement which, told in such a fashion, sounded curiously
  ominous.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam Blockton was last seen on Tuesday morning in the neighbourhood
  of one o'clock at the County Club," he announced. "He had arrived there for
  lunch, as usual. The steward of the club spoke to him at ten minutes past one
  and announced that his luncheon was ready. Sir Adam nodded acquiescence and
  the steward retired. Sir Adam's habits of punctuality were so well known that
  when he had not appeared in a couple of minutes the head steward returned to
  the room. Sir Adam had disappeared."</p>

  <p>"And he has not been heard of since?" the Coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"The club, the bank, his dwelling place have been searched without
  result," was Captain Elmhurst's reply. "The matter passes, as from to-day,
  formally into the hands of the police. Any information we receive will be
  placed at the disposal of the authorities who are engaged in this
  investigation."</p>

  <p>There was a little murmur in Court. Two days. A two days' disappearance in
  the heart of a town where practically every person in the street knew him by
  sight, where his car was known, where he could neither have boarded a train
  nor crept into any hiding place without having been observed. The
  disappearance of a man who fails to turn up at his club after a few days and
  cannot be heard of at home becomes a more serious affair when it passes into
  the hands of the police. There were rumours of a detective from Scotland Yard
  who was present in the Court. Interest in the unknown man grew fainter. Three
  quarters of the people who trooped out of the Court at half-past twelve that
  morning were talking not of the verdict on the body of the unknown
  man&mdash;wilful murder against some person or persons unknown&mdash;but of
  the disappearance of Sir Adam Blockton.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Martin Mowbray, waiting at the side entrance of the Town Hall, suddenly
  heard a familiar voice in his ear.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Martin, can I speak to you for a moment?"</p>

  <p>He swung round. There was enthusiasm in his tone and manner.</p>

  <p>"Can you speak to me?" he repeated. "Isn't it exactly what I have wanted
  more than anything in the world for the last two days&mdash;to have you speak
  to me? Isn't that precisely what I am waiting about here for, because I knew
  that you would probably leave by this door?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd," Diana laughed. "But seriously, I do want to thank you
  for getting up in Court like that and putting dear old Mr. Salisbury in his
  place."</p>

  <p>"Part of my job," he told her smiling. "I am one of the firm who
  represents your interests, you know."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to ask me any questions about that letter, are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he assured her, "was further from my thoughts. Can I take you
  somewhere?" he went on. "I am an excellent chauffeur. I will drive you home,
  I will take you shopping or better still I will give you lunch."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow a cocktail would be wonderful," she murmured. "That horrid old man
  was beginning to get on my nerves."</p>

  <p>"And lunch afterwards," he urged. "Come to the ladies' room at the
  club.</p>

  <p>"I would love to," she agreed. "I have really nothing to do. Mother is
  nearly crazy about this Sir Adam business and she keeps on asking me all the
  time if I cannot get you or your uncle to tell her what is in the Will. I try
  and explain that there is no question of a Will yet and that it is absurd to
  imagine that Grandfather Adam is dead. However, don't let's talk about that.
  I'll come to lunch with you with pleasure."</p>

  <p>They drove off to the club. Martin parked his car and conducted her into
  the small private room.</p>

  <p>"No other ladies," he remarked with a sigh of relief. "I am in luck
  to-day! If anyone rings up, Lawford," he instructed the steward, "tell them
  that the room is engaged."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mr. Mowbray," was the smiling reply.</p>

  <p>"And now," Martin went on, "two of your very best Dry Martini
  cocktails&mdash;well shaken."</p>

  <p>"I'll make them myself, sir," the man promised. "You shan't have to wait a
  minute. You might be looking at the menu while I am gone, if you would be so
  good."</p>

  <p>He placed it on the table and made his usual dignified exit.</p>

  <p>"What a marvellous butler he would make," Diana sighed. "Just the sort of
  man I should love to have at home. But then we never seem to keep good
  servants. I don't think we pay them enough."</p>

  <p>They studied the menu together and on Lawford's reappearance pronounced
  favourably upon their cocktails and ordered lunch.</p>

  <p>"Now that we are friends again," Diana said, as soon as they were once
  more alone, "perhaps you will tell me why you deserted me so shamefully
  yesterday afternoon. I suppose your uncle was right, but still, it did seem
  as though it might have been possible to have got that wretched draft held
  over or something. Poor old Grandfather Adam, supposed to be worth six or
  seven millions all his lifetime&mdash;if he isn't still alive&mdash;and the
  day he disappeared to have a cheque dishonoured! It's enough to make him turn
  in his grave&mdash;or wherever he is."</p>

  <p>"The cheque," Martin told her, looking away for a moment, "was not
  dishonoured, and the reason I disappeared was because I took the messenger
  with me up to the bank he came from."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you persuaded them to hold it over?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I paid it," he confessed. "I hope you won't be angry with me."</p>

  <p>"But your uncle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do with the firm," he interrupted. "My uncle is very
  old-fashioned, you know, Lady Diana. I can assure you I was very glad to do
  it. I have money outside the firm. I had to go back with the man, though,
  because naturally one doesn't keep a balance quite so large as that."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I think it was perfectly sweet of you," she declared; "but you ought not
  to have done it."</p>

  <p>"If you knew how glad I was that I felt I was able to . . ." he said.
  "After all, it was a very small risk to take. The money will come back."</p>

  <p>Then the service of lunch began and he fancied, as she looked quickly
  away, that there were tears at the ends of those beautiful eyelashes. He
  himself felt exceedingly uncomfortable. It was an emotional moment which only
  the presence of Lawford kept duly suppressed.</p>

  <p>"Sorry I'm so silly," Diana apologised as at last the steward left the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Well, you haven't had exactly a pleasant morning, have you?" her host
  remarked. "But do believe me, there was nothing at all unusual in what I did.
  It is always the duty of a lawyer to help his clients."</p>

  <p>"Did you do that just because I was a client?" she asked, suddenly leaning
  over and patting his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I didn't," he confessed. "I have the misfortune to be like
  most of the men in this part of the world and a good many around Mayfair,
  too&mdash;one of your admirers."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"You will find yourself in serious trouble in a moment!" he warned
  her.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it might be the sort of trouble I don't mind," she replied.</p>

  <p>If he looked up he was lost. He knew exactly the sort of light that he
  would find in those beautiful brown eyes. He felt that they were seeking for
  his. Every moment he grew more tense with the struggle.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she said softly.</p>

  <p>He became desperate.</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Diana," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"That is quite reward enough," he assured her smiling. "Diana it shall be.
  I am a perfect idiot, Diana, but I cannot say just what I would like to say
  at this moment and that's all I can tell you about it. I suppose several poor
  devils have been in the same box. Some day I shall be out of it, I hope, and
  then I shall explain."</p>

  <p>"You are not secretly married or anything of that sort?" she asked, with a
  touch of the old badinage in her tone.</p>

  <p>That gave him his chance. He looked her full in the face.</p>

  <p>"There has never been any other girl in my life and never will be," he
  told her. "It is not a matter of that at all."</p>

  <p>"All right," she sighed. "Seems rather a pity, especially as I am off to
  London to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I cannot stand the atmosphere down here," she confided. "My dear aunt has
  made herself really ill, I think, worrying, and I am so ashamed of it all.
  You don't mind if I bore you with my family troubles?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. Do please get on with your lunch, though. I wonder why it
  is that only men can eat and talk at the same time."</p>

  <p>"Talking sometimes is more interesting," she said. "However, I will do as
  I am told. You see," she went on in a moment or two, "my aunt is simply
  frightened out of her life. She is not worrying about Sir Adam's
  disappearance in the least. It is all these rumours about what has become of
  his money that are troubling her."</p>

  <p>"Mercenary old wretch!" Martin exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"That's what I think, but what's the good? I'm sorry for her in a way. My
  uncle, of course, is very extravagant, both the boys are in debt and aunt has
  always been looked upon as a great heiress. They have all the time been
  worrying her to write or go and see Sir Adam or get him out to Wrotton Park,
  and she daren't do it. I can't blame her because my own mother is very nearly
  as bad. In every letter I have had from her she has said: 'Do make some
  opportunity of coming across your grandfather.' I think she would have liked
  me to wait on the steps here and accost him when he came in one morning as
  though I were surprised. . . . Of course, in a day or two's time, if anything
  is heard of it and people begin to take his disappearance more seriously,
  there will be no holding them. You will have two daughters and all the
  grandchildren camping round your offices."</p>

  <p>"A pleasant prospect," he remarked smiling. "The humour of it is that just
  at present neither we&mdash;his local solicitors&mdash;nor Sir Theodore, his
  town lawyer, have the least idea where all his money is."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"So much so," she reminded him, patting his hand again, "that if it had
  not been for you the poor old man would have had his cheque dishonoured. But
  seriously, Martin&mdash;I am going to be mercenary myself&mdash;do you really
  think it possible that he can have been gambling or that he has disposed of,
  or been robbed of, all that money?"</p>

  <p>"My dear," he replied, "I have speculated and wondered about this matter
  so long that I feel perfectly addled. The only conclusion I have come to is
  that he could not have done it. The money must be somewhere in credits or
  bonds or specie, or some of all three."</p>

  <p>"What about giving it away? He could have done that secretly, couldn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"Not to any large extent."</p>

  <p>"He may have had a touch of softening of the brain."</p>

  <p>"Not a chance. I can assure you that only a few days ago I was talking to
  him and his brain was as keen and clever as ever."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you any theory at all about it?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"The only possible conclusion I have arrived at, and that is not a
  conclusion at all," Martin said with a certain amount of hesitation, "is that
  he is having a gigantic joke with us all."</p>

  <p>"I was half inclined to believe that at the beginning," she confessed.
  "I've given up the idea, though. It's impossible."</p>

  <p>"Well, remember this," he continued. "Sir Adam had a most fantastic vein
  of sardonic humour with a streak of downright wickedness in it. I remember
  years ago several queer things which he did; and curiously enough, on the
  morning of his disappearance, sitting in that historical easy chair in the
  reading room, my uncle watched him look up at the statue of his father
  outside and he assured me that his expression was absolutely inhuman, except
  for that little twist of the lips he had when he was amused, generally at
  someone else's expense."</p>

  <p>"Was that on the actual day of his disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"On the actual morning," he assured her. "It was one of his evil days, I
  am sure. That is why I think he will turn up again before long with his
  tongue in his cheek laughing at us all, and why I should advise anyone who
  has an eye to the future to do nothing in the way of pressing for settlement
  of his accounts. Try and impress that upon your mother, if you can, Diana.
  The first one who tries to get in ahead of the rest and appeals to the Courts
  for an examination of his affairs is the one whom I think will never touch a
  penny of the old man's money. There's some sordid advice for you!"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I believe it is good advice. Very nice of you to give it to me, too,
  Martin, because you don't seem to like me much&mdash;do you?"</p>

  <p>"I like you a great deal too much for my own peace of mind," he assured
  her.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it, please. How does it make you feel?"</p>

  <p>It was really a little difficult. She had made the way so easy for him,
  made further resistance so ungracious. There had been times during the last
  two days when he had fancied her a trifle flippant in the face of a crisis.
  It was a weakness which seemed to have disappeared. Subconsciously he had
  been studying her in the odd moments of their conversation. There was a sort
  of frankness of expression and features which he had never before entirely
  appreciated. Her eyes met his pleasantly, truthfully. Once or twice, he was
  almost forced to admit, invitingly. For two or three seasons he had read in
  the society papers paragraphs about her charm, her graceful presence, her
  subtle gifts of personality which made her the most notable figure in circles
  of which he knew nothing. He had looked upon it as idle and rather smug
  gossip. Just now he was realising the truth of it all. He had his chance.
  Perhaps he was a fool to let it go.. .. Whilst they waited for their coffee
  she leaned back in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Martin Mowbray!"</p>

  <p>He was forced to meet her eyes. She was smiling very pleasantly across at
  him but there was a touch of mockery on her lips.</p>

  <p>"I thought that men were always so much more at their ease when they were
  absolutely alone with a woman in whom they were interested than when they had
  to make conversation at a party. When we have met in this stupid crowd down
  here you have always seemed so full of confidence. Why have you lost it all,
  or is this your natural self and your confidence a bluff?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Diana&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Diana, if you please."</p>

  <p>"Diana, then," he went on. "Will you be kind and believe this? I am in a
  horrible mess. I do honestly and really feel tongue-tied and unnatural. There
  you have it," he wound up a little savagely. "I have the usual modicum of
  brain, I suppose, and the usual modicum of decency, and yet I cannot be
  natural with you at the present moment."</p>

  <p>"It won't go on forever, then?" she asked demurely.</p>

  <p>"It certainly won't," he assured her. "Where I can I will be quite candid.
  I will tell you this, for instance. I did not part with that five thousand
  pounds out of any respect for your grandfather or the family name. I risked
  it entirely to give you pleasure."</p>

  <p>"I wanted so much to have you say that," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"It's nothing to what I could say," he told her, suddenly recovering a
  portion of his confidence. "Nothing to what I hope, perhaps, some day I shall
  be able to say. But not just at this moment. Don't misunderstand me. I know
  no more about where your grandfather is than the man in the moon but I do
  know something about him which accounts for my stupidity this morning. Leave
  it at that, please."</p>

  <p>She studied him thoughtfully. He met her eyes without flinching.</p>

  <p>"All right," she sighed. "Scruples of some sort, I suppose. You are
  inclined to be a Quixote, you know. I will respect those scruples, Martin,
  whatever they may be. You have given me a wonderful lunch, I like to be here
  with you and I like feeling that I know a little more about you. Now isn't it
  nice of me not to be peevish?"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't be that," he expostulated. "You are too much of a
  woman."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the time may come when the necessity for this diffidence of
  yours will pass," she ventured.</p>

  <p>"It most certainly will&mdash;and then look out for yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Any idea about when?"</p>

  <p>"When you know something which I guess at now and which I cannot speak
  of."</p>

  <p>"You are making life more mysterious than ever," she complained. "Never
  mind; as I told you, I have loved your luncheon, I quite like your
  cigarettes, and Lawford does understand how to serve good coffee. Perhaps we
  will have another lunch here some day, shall we, as soon as the moment
  comes?"</p>

  <p>"And may it be soon!" he answered fervently. "We will exchange confidences
  then. I will tell you what has made me such a dull companion to-day and you
  shall tell me why you tore up your mother's letter to Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"It is a fair bargain," she agreed, as she picked up her gloves.</p>

  <p>He suddenly found her leaning over his chair. He rose quickly. There was a
  strange little gleam of invitation in her eyes, quite bewildering in its
  way.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me one small kiss, please," she begged, "very
  quietly&mdash;just here?" she went on, tapping the corners of her lips. "You
  see, I should feel so humiliated if, having lunched alone in a private room
  for the first time in my life&mdash;in this most compromising centre of wild
  gaiety, too&mdash;I was not offered even one little fragment of an
  embrace."</p>

  <p>Every one of his scruples went overboard. He drew her into his arms and he
  dealt with the geography of her lips exactly as he pleased.</p>

  <p>"Excellent," she whispered as she drew herself away a few moments later a
  little breathlessly. "As a prelude, really it was wonderful. Come and
  telephone for them to bring my car round here, please; then I must go back
  and listen to more vapourings from my aunt. To-morrow," she added, when he
  had despatched a messenger to the telephone and they walked across the hall
  together, "I may return to London. If anything happens, do send me a telegram
  and I will catch the next train down again."</p>

  <p>"I certainly will," he promised. "You shall be in at the death, if there
  is one."</p>

  <p>"And let me tell you, my dear Martin," she said as they loitered on the
  steps and her fingers rested upon his arm, "as a luncheon companion you are
  enigmatic but in your own fashion charming."</p>

  <p>"And shall I tell you what I think of you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, don't please," she begged quickly, with something which was
  remarkably like that old-fashioned gesture, a blush. "I won't have what you
  think of me put into crude words at all. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>She flitted away. As she reached the pavement she paused for a moment and
  looked up at the statue of the first Sir Adam. With the tips of her fingers
  she threw him a kiss.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17"
     name="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">DIANA, although it was the height of the season, found
  London a little tiresome. After three nights, which had included a dinner
  party, a visit to the opera and three or four supper parties, she began to
  wonder what was the matter with her. She was quite used to sitting up late
  but on the morning of the fourth day she felt equally disinclined to get up
  and join a large party who were picnicking on the river, to watch the tennis
  at Wimbledon or to keep a golf engagement. A pile of square envelopes upon
  her breakfast tray she regarded impatiently. For some reason or other she
  felt that London could do very well without her for the rest of the
  season.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Anna?" she asked her maid, who had just brought up the
  breakfast tray and several armfuls of roses and showed a distinct disposition
  to linger.</p>

  <p>"There is a person downstairs who has asked to see Your Ladyship," the
  girl announced.</p>

  <p>"A person?" Diana yawned.</p>

  <p>The maid presented a card, Diana glanced at it and swung half out of bed.
  There it was, neatly engraved and unmistakable:</p>

  <p>Detective Inspector Snell C.I.D.</p>

  <p><i>Scotland Yard.</i></p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In the waiting room, Your Ladyship. I told him it was very doubtful
  whether you would be able to see him yet but I thought I had better bring up
  the card."</p>

  <p>"Turn on my bath," Diana ordered briskly. "Put me out some morning
  clothes&mdash;anything will do. First of all you had better go down and tell
  the Inspector that I shall be ready to see him in quarter of an hour and make
  him as comfortable as you can."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Your Ladyship."</p>

  <p>Diana had been a trifle optimistic but in less than half an hour she
  entered her own small sitting room to find Mr. Snell comfortably ensconced in
  an easy chair reading the <i>Times</i>. She welcomed him almost warmly.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>The Inspector was somewhat disappointing. He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"None for the moment. I took the liberty of calling because I wondered
  whether Your Ladyship would be good enough to help me."</p>

  <p>"Help! Don't you know that there is nothing I would rather do?" she
  assured him. "Tell me what it is at once, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Well, Lady Diana, in thinking this case over," he said, "I have felt
  myself rather drawn back towards the necessity of establishing the identity
  of the murdered man in Sir Adam's vault."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Fanshawe did everything possible at the time," Snell continued, "but I
  think that one could perhaps go a little further. Captain Denham, the master
  of the valet who sold his wardrobe, belongs, I believe, to the Ambassadors'
  Club."</p>

  <p>Diana shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I never heard of him."</p>

  <p>"Well, his name is on the list of members," Snell went on, "and I gather
  that he is frequently there. I saw, too, in one of the pictorial papers this
  morning, that you were dancing there the night before last."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes go in after a show with a party," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"I want to make my enquiries, so far as possible," Snell explained,
  speaking in his usual low and soothing voice, "indirectly. Sir Theodore is a
  member of the Ambassadors' Club. I wonder whether you could not obtain an
  introduction to Captain Denham and ask him a question or two."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you want me to ask him," she begged. "I am sure Sir Theodore
  would go in to supper there with me any night that he was disengaged."</p>

  <p>"I want to know the name of that valet without disturbing him too much,"
  Snell confided. "These sort of people, you know," he went on, "get nervous
  when they hear the police have been asking things and before you know where
  you are they have disappeared. That's why I do not wish to make any enquiries
  in the neighbourhood of the Albany."</p>

  <p>Diana thought for a moment rapidly.</p>

  <p>"I am going to a theatre party to-night with Sir Theodore Markham. I am
  sure he would go on to the Ambassadors' afterwards if I asked him. I could
  not very well pick the young man up, though, could I&mdash;even if he were
  there. I don't even know him by sight."</p>

  <p>"I have made a few enquiries," the Inspector admitted. "Captain Denham
  seems to be very fond of going to the Ambassadors' to supper. He has been
  there for the last three nights and as a matter of fact they have become
  quite particular lately for a Night Club and they insist nowadays, I am told,
  upon a proposer and a seconder. Sir Theodore seconded this young man."</p>

  <p>Lady Diana was very much interested.</p>

  <p>"The thing is becoming ridiculously easy," she declared. "I will ring up
  Sir Theodore at once. Would you like to wait?"</p>

  <p>"It would be better," Snell agreed.</p>

  <p>Lady Diana was only absent from the room for a few minutes, during which
  time the Inspector resumed his study of the <i>Times</i>. She reappeared
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"It is all beautifully arranged," she announced. "Not only is Sir Theodore
  willing to ask the young man to the Ambassadors' for supper to-night but he
  has a vacant place for the theatre and he is coming there, too. Tell me
  please exactly what it is I am to find out."</p>

  <p>"Just the name of the valet. Nothing more," Inspector Snell replied.
  "Maybe I am making a mistake but directly I know the name, without making any
  Public House enquiries or that sort of thing, I shall go through the records
  and I think we may be able to move forward a step or two. It will be very
  kind of you, Lady Diana."</p>

  <p>He wrote down a telephone number and passed it to her.</p>

  <p>"Any time between midnight and eight o'clock in the morning that number
  will find me," he said. "Don't mind waking me up, please, Lady Diana. I'm
  used to being disturbed and I shall be asleep again in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"Lucky man!" she smiled.</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell took his leave. Diana felt a new interest in her crowded
  day.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Diana showed that she had at least learned the rudiments of the great game
  played by Inspector Snell and hundreds of his fellow workers. She indulged in
  light and entirely impersonal conversation with her neighbour at the theatre,
  she made herself an agreeable but somewhat indifferent companion at
  suppertime and though she danced readily with him as soon as she was asked,
  it was not until they were sitting out in a little lounge opening from the
  supper room that she betrayed even the slightest interest or curiosity in her
  new acquaintance.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she asked, "is Sir Theodore a very old friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>The young man smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, we belong to rather different generations," he reminded her. "Sir
  Theodore was at Harrow with my father and I seem to have known him all my
  life. He seconded me for this place, or proposed me, I'm not sure which, a
  week or so ago. Best place in London for a dance after the theatre and never
  overcrowded."</p>

  <p>Diana agreed. She asked a few more indifferent questions about his career
  in the army, then she repeated his name.</p>

  <p>"Lionel Denham. Odd&mdash;it seems to me that I have heard that name
  recently. Why should your name seem so familiar to me? Have we met anywhere
  before?"</p>

  <p>He made the obvious reply about the impossibility of his having forgotten
  a meeting. Suddenly she sat up with a little exclamation.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, I remember! You know who I am, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," he laughed. "Lady Diana Pengwill. I don't suppose there
  is anyone in the room doesn't know that."</p>

  <p>"No; but do you know that I am the grandchild of that dear old gentleman
  who has disappeared? You must have read about it in the newspapers."</p>

  <p>"You mean Sir Adam Blockton? Of course I have. I did not connect him with
  you in any way, though."</p>

  <p>"He is my grandfather."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" Denham exclaimed. "What&mdash;the millionaire banker chap who
  lived like a hermit and disappeared from Norchester?"</p>

  <p>"The same," Diana admitted.</p>

  <p>"And a man was found murdered in the bank vaults the same day!"</p>

  <p>"Wearing a suit of your old clothes," Diana said calmly.</p>

  <p>Denham stared at her blankly.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about, Lady Diana?"</p>

  <p>"Can't you guess?" she replied. "The police came to see you about it,
  didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul, of course they did!" Denham exclaimed. "Some of the
  clothes my valet had sold to Hobbs. I say, it's a small world, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Ridiculously," Diana assented.</p>

  <p>"Actually wearing a suit of those clothes, was he, when he was committing
  the burglary?"</p>

  <p>Diana nodded.</p>

  <p>"Thoughtful of him to cut the tab out, wasn't it?" she remarked. "You
  might have been in the police court."</p>

  <p>"I should have had an alibi," he grinned. "Besides, John would have been
  for it before me."</p>

  <p>"Who is John?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My valet."</p>

  <p>"Tell me his other name?" she enquired casually.</p>

  <p>He gazed at his questioner, obviously perplexed.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth do you want to know that?"</p>

  <p>Diana toyed with her fan for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is a little complicated," she confided. "However, it is such a
  simple matter I thought you might have told me."</p>

  <p>"I never call him anything but John. Come to think of it, I've forgotten
  his surname."</p>

  <p>"Really? I suppose he has one."</p>

  <p>"I should imagine so."</p>

  <p>The conversation seemed temporarily to flag. The young man, who was
  desperately anxious to make a favourable impression upon his companion, was
  ill at ease.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, Lady Diana," he explained, "John is a remarkably
  good servant and very useful to me but he was in trouble once and if there is
  anything he is afraid of it is getting mixed up with the police in any way.
  He nearly went off the deep end the other morning when they came asking him
  questions. He gets like that sometimes&mdash;a regular bundle of nerves."</p>

  <p>Diana sighed. She looked into the restaurant.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we had better go back," she suggested. "I promised to dance with
  Colonel Hodges."</p>

  <p>"Don't hurry," he begged. "I wish I could help you in this matter, Lady
  Diana. Is there anything else I could tell you?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to have forgotten the only thing I should like to know," she
  rejoined a little coldly. "Fortunately it is perfectly easy to find out the
  truth by enquiring in another direction."</p>

  <p>She half-rose to her feet but he detained her.</p>

  <p>"One moment, please," he pleaded. "I'll tell you the fellow's name, if you
  really want to know it."</p>

  <p>She smiled upon him in dazzling fashion.</p>

  <p>"That's very nice of you," she said. "You know, the Inspector came to see
  me only the other day. I was able to tell him several small things about
  Norchester. It is all so interesting, you know, and I love to feel that I am
  helping."</p>

  <p>"You don't think John is likely to get into any trouble?" Denham
  asked.</p>

  <p>"How could he?" she expostulated.</p>

  <p>"I should hate to lose him," the young man admitted. "He goes by the name
  of John Hawkes and he is the only man I have ever had who can tie a white tie
  properly. His real name is Grainger."</p>

  <p>"You shan't be robbed of your treasure," Diana assured him. "If you'd like
  to give me a champagne cocktail I'll stay another five minutes. I don't
  really want to dance with that tiresome Colonel Hodges."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18"
     name="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was barely ten o'clock next morning when John, seldom to
  be seen in such dishabille, answered the front doorbell of his master's
  apartments in a striped linen coat and with some slight vagueness about his
  collar and tie arrangements. He stared disparagingly at the man who stood on
  the doorstep. Mr. Snell had been suffering from indigestion for several days
  and his complexion was not at its best. The sleepy droop of his eyelid over
  his left eye was more than ever noticeable. He was wearing, notwithstanding
  the fact that he was paying a call in the sacred purlieus of Piccadilly, the
  same snuff-coloured suit, and he carried a brown paper parcel and a badly
  rolled umbrella.</p>

  <p>"What do you want?" the valet asked curtly.</p>

  <p>The Inspector looked him over with mild criticism in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"A word with you," he replied. "Hawkes is the name, I believe, under which
  you are passing at the present moment&mdash;John Hawkes, once known as John
  Grainger."</p>

  <p>"And what might that word be?" the valet asked without moving.</p>

  <p>There was nothing aggressive about Mr. Snell's action but it carried force
  with it. In plain words, without seeming to be in the least offensive, he
  pushed his way across the threshold into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Close the door," he instructed.</p>

  <p>"And who might you be?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I come from Scotland Yard, but I have not come about your police
  permit or anything of that sort," the Inspector answered. "Nothing to do with
  that Masters affair at all. That's all finished and done with, I hope. I have
  come here on another matter. It would be in your interests that we did not
  discuss it in the hall."</p>

  <p>A slow but complete metamorphosis took place in the man's appearance. He
  was no longer inclined to be abusive, neither had his better manners become
  re-established. It seemed as though he had been turned into an icicle. He
  opened the door of a sitting room, motioned his visitor to enter, and he
  himself followed, having carefully closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>"They say you never leave a man alone once you have laid your hands upon
  him," he said bitterly. "Well, what do you want of me? There was a man from
  Norchester here a day or two ago. Are you on the same job?"</p>

  <p>"I am," Inspector Snell assented.</p>

  <p>"I can only tell you what I told him. I sold the coat to Hobbs on behalf
  of my master with a lot of other clothes. It was not my fault that they could
  not identify it or describe the man who bought the suit."</p>

  <p>"They were not very clever, Grainger. I don't think it is their business
  to be clever on occasions like that."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will tell me," the valet sneered, "how to make them remember
  what they choose to forget."</p>

  <p>"We have our methods," Snell said softly as he pulled a chair out and sat
  down. "You see, I don't come from the provinces, Grainger. We are rather a
  rougher lot up here, I am afraid, than down in Norchester! We have certain
  advantages, of course. We know more."</p>

  <p>"Where do you come from, then?" the valet asked.</p>

  <p>"I am a Chief Inspector from Scotland Yard," Snell confided, blinking a
  little. "You would find 'C.I.D.' upon my card. No offence to our friend from
  Norchester, but we do see more of these cases, you know. Now I honestly want
  to find out the identity of the man who purchased that suit. We have another
  important piece of business that we want to get on with which cannot be dealt
  with until this one is settled."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure that you sold the suit of clothes, the coat of which the man
  from Norchester showed you, to Hobbs?" Snell asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"How could I be sure?" was the impatient reply. "My master is the most
  extravagant man with clothes I ever worked for. He orders a dozen suits at a
  time. God knows how many he had when I commenced to lift a few of them for
  him now and then."</p>

  <p>"If you didn't sell it to Hobbs, to whom should you have sold it?"</p>

  <p>"A man in the Fulham Road, and if not to him, another in the Caledonian
  Market. How can you expect me to remember?"</p>

  <p>Snell unfastened the string of the brown paper parcel which he had been
  carrying and laid the contents upon the table.</p>

  <p>"There's the coat, Grainger," he said. "Come on&mdash;out with it."</p>

  <p>The valet glanced at the garment contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"Well, it isn't much good to anyone now, since you have had the packing of
  it," he observed. "That is one of the suits I sold to Hobbs."</p>

  <p>"Do you know which of the salesmen were present when you made your
  sale?"</p>

  <p>"I do."</p>

  <p>"Will you identify him if I take you down there?"</p>

  <p>"Not willingly," was the sullen reply. "Not willingly&mdash;you must
  understand that&mdash;but I will point him out to you, if necessary. He was
  one of the ugliest little men I have ever seen&mdash;present company
  excepted."</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps you would be kind enough to go and ask your master for an
  hour's leave."</p>

  <p>Grainger shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not necessary," he growled. "My master came in this morning in such a
  state that he won't turn in his bed until luncheon-time. I'll come. Better
  get the thing over."</p>

  <p>"Admirably said," his visitor declared.</p>

  <p>Grainger disappeared for a few moments, during which he made a brief but
  improving toilet. The two men travelled eastwards in a taxi. They were
  unfortunate in that they did not find many subjects of conversation of mutual
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Sure you are going to remember the little man who took your business in
  hand?" Snell asked once.</p>

  <p>His companion looked at him contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"I shall remember him for the reason I have told you," he replied. "You
  wait."</p>

  <p>They entered the emporium. Grainger led the way to the further end of the
  place. A small man in a shiny morning suit came forward to greet them. He was
  not only ill-dressed but he was of shabby appearance.</p>

  <p>"Well," he asked, "what is it?"</p>

  <p>"I sold you a suit of clothes with twenty or thirty others about a month
  ago," Grainger announced. "Here's the coat of it."</p>

  <p>He produced the coat, which he had taken from his companion coming down.
  He laid it upon the counter and even as he did so he found himself smoothing
  out the creases and making a more respectable-looking garment of it.</p>

  <p>"Now then," he continued. "You may have to rack your brains, young fellow,
  but you'd just as well do it now as later. You've got to remember the person
  to whom you sold it."</p>

  <p>"I've got to, have I?" the man scoffed. "That's no way for a servant to
  talk."</p>

  <p>"It isn't the servant's questions you will have to answer," Grainger
  snapped. "It's this gentleman's."</p>

  <p>"And who might you be, sir?" the salesman asked, turning to Snell.</p>

  <p>The latter fumbled in his pocket and produced a card.</p>

  <p>"Scotland Yard," he whispered confidentially. "Don't you forget that, my
  friend. Now look at that coat."</p>

  <p>"I see it."</p>

  <p>"Try and remember to whom you sold it."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. Snell leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"It's Scotland Yard you are answering," he reminded him. "There are many
  times when we can make it hard or easy for you. You know that quite well. To
  whom did you sell that coat?"</p>

  <p>"He gave no name," the salesman replied. "They never do give names when
  they buy clothes here. He changed the suit in the office there and walked
  away with this one."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with the suit he left here?"</p>

  <p>"We've got it in stock."</p>

  <p>The young man turned away and pushed back the doors of a sliding cupboard.
  He drew out two or three garments and replaced them, then he laid one on the
  counter before them.</p>

  <p>"Brown imitation homespun," he remarked. "Not bad material. Very warm. Bad
  cut."</p>

  <p>Snell took hold of the coat and looked inside. He also looked inside the
  coat pocket.</p>

  <p>"You fellows don't make it too easy for us, do you?" he remarked as he
  examined the place where the name had been cut out.</p>

  <p>The salesman grinned. He had unpleasant-looking teeth and he had no
  scruples in showing them.</p>

  <p>"Of course we don't make it too easy," he agreed, "but still, there it is.
  It is part of our job to cut out the name or initials from any suit of
  clothes we purchase."</p>

  <p>Snell's left eyelid seemed to become raised. He was looking straight into
  the salesman's eyes and it was the sort of look of investigation which it was
  hard to face.</p>

  <p>"How much do you remember of the man who was wearing that suit of
  clothes?" he asked slowly. "Take your time. How much?"</p>

  <p>"That suit fitted him like a glove. That ought to tell you all there is to
  be told about his figure. He was tallish and slim, walked with his shoulders
  back and his head in the air. Might have been a soldier to look at him; but
  my, he was tired! He was a young man gone grey early&mdash;in the face, I
  mean&mdash;not the hair. Ordinary-coloured hair, clean linen, but a shabby
  tie. He carried a cane. Now, Mr. Inspector, if I were talking for my life I
  couldn't tell you more than that."</p>

  <p>"Was he fair or dark?"</p>

  <p>"Inclined to be fair. His cheeks had sunken a bit and he needed a shave.
  When he left here smoking a cigarette he was quite the toff."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," the Inspector said. "What about his linen?"</p>

  <p>"He bought some odd things we had&mdash;all the best. I'll tell you what
  he asked for&mdash;he asked for a Zingari tie. What does that mean&mdash;a
  sort of cricket club, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Snell nodded his approbation.</p>

  <p>"You are improving immensely, young man. I am beginning to take quite a
  fancy to you. You go on like this and you'll be all right. You interest me.
  Rack your mind now. Is there anything else you can tell me likely to help me
  to get at that fellow's name and business in life?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," the salesman decided after a moment's reflection. "He spoke
  like a gent. And yes&mdash;there is one more thing. He said, as he paid up:
  'Now I'm going to have my hair cut and a shave before I take a little
  journey.' He asked me where to go and I told him. I said: 'Well, you are only
  just across the street from the Milan. They will do you proper and it will be
  just opening time for a cocktail at the bar when you have finished.'"</p>

  <p>"You think he went there?" Snell asked.</p>

  <p>"I am sure he did," was the confident reply. "He turned down the street
  and hurried towards the Strand. There's no one else on the way. That's where
  he went all right."</p>

  <p>Snell parted from his companion outside the door.</p>

  <p>"Don't know how you manage it," Grainger muttered. "You seemed to get all
  you wanted out of him."</p>

  <p>"Except the name," Snell sighed. "I did want the name, Grainger. Very
  badly. You are not likely to remember it, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard it."</p>

  <p>The Inspector sighed again. He hung his umbrella over his arm and turned
  away.</p>

  <p>"If ever you should hear it, Grainger," he confided, "it might be worth a
  little notice taken off that card of yours and it might&mdash;yes, I am sure
  it would be worth a twenty-pound note."</p>

  <p>Grainger shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"He never told me the name, sir, and there's no way that I know that I'm
  likely to hear it, but if a miracle should happen that word on my paper would
  not come amiss. I hope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have done yourself no harm, Grainger," Snell interrupted, "but you
  might have been a shade more civil at the commencement of our little
  conversation."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>The Inspector was not disposed to hurry himself at the Milan. He indulged
  in a shave, he had his hair trimmed and shampooed, he bought a bottle of hair
  lotion and exchanged a few remarks with the manager. When he had paid his
  bill he drew the latter on one side.</p>

  <p>"I know I am asking you a difficult question," he said, "but do you
  remember, just before midday it would be and probably on Monday of last week,
  a young man coming in here having a shave and haircut who was not one of your
  regular clients? He was wearing a dark blue suit&mdash;one of those new
  patterns with a little stripe in it&mdash;it was a Savile Row suit and very
  well cut but it was not quite new. He wore a blue linen shirt and he might
  have been wearing a Zingari tie."</p>

  <p>The manager shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Monday week, sir," he expostulated. "That's a good time ago in a busy
  place like this!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Snell, who since his haircut and shave was much improved in
  appearance, drew his companion a little farther away from the door.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Myers," he said, "let me tell you this. My name is Snell,&mdash;Chief
  Inspector Snell of Scotland Yard,&mdash;and it is always good policy to keep
  in with the police. The young man I have just been trying to describe to you
  came to a bad end and we are investigating the matter. What I would like you
  to do is to describe him to your assistants one by one and if there is one of
  them can tell me his name or any of his remarks as to what he was going to do
  with himself for the rest of the day, it would be extraordinarily valuable
  information for me."</p>

  <p>The manager looked behind.</p>

  <p>"They are getting pretty slack just now, sir," he said. "We shan't have
  many in until half-past twelve. I'll just question all of them except the two
  who were not here that day. If there is any news where shall I find you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll go into the bar&mdash;no, not in the bar, the little lounge just at
  the top of the stairs&mdash;and wait," the Inspector announced. "If you have
  any news at all come up and find me. If it is one of your young men who won't
  object to the compliment it would be worth a sovereign or so to him if he can
  help us."</p>

  <p>"I will do the best I can, Inspector."</p>

  <p>Snell took his place in a corner and waited. He ordered a glass of sherry
  and smoked a cigarette thoughtfully. In about a quarter of an hour the
  manager reappeared. He was followed by one of the assistants, whom he brought
  over at once.</p>

  <p>"This young man believes that he served the person you were speaking
  about, sir," he confided. "I will leave him to answer any questions you
  desire. You will excuse me now, I'm sure. I have one of my old clients
  waiting for me."</p>

  <p>The Inspector found an even more retired corner.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about this man whom you waited on," he said. "It was Monday of
  last week, I believe, when he came in."</p>

  <p>"The governor gave me his description, sir," the assistant said. "I feel
  sure I waited on the gentleman you described. He was wearing a very well cut
  suit&mdash;blue with a stripe. He laughed at something I said and told me
  frankly that he had just bought his suit ready-made from a tailor close to. I
  felt certain he meant Hobbs. Looking at him, sir, and even listening to his
  talk, I couldn't help coming to the conclusion that he was like a great many
  other young gentlemen we get here&mdash;whom we shave and whose hair we cut,
  and they seem all the time half-dumb and yet find it wonderful. You can guess
  what I mean, sir. It's men who have just been let out of prison and gone and
  bought clothes ready-made and then come in and want a thorough course of
  treatment here. Then they feel they can start life again. Well, this one gave
  me that idea, sir."</p>

  <p>"He didn't by any chance tell you his name or his plans?" the Inspector
  asked.</p>

  <p>The assistant smiled. He produced his tablet from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"There you are, sir," he pointed out. "He bought a bottle of hairwash. We
  sent it over for him to St. Pancras Station."</p>

  <p>The Inspector read the name without moving a muscle.</p>

  <p>Mr. George Bradstone.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19"
     name="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">INSPECTOR SNELL rose at once to his feet as the door of the
  morning room of Belgrave House was suddenly opened and a very
  attractive-looking lady, dressed for walking in a beautifully cut plain dark
  coat and skirt and with a Pekinese dog under each arm, swept into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Snell, isn't it?" she greeted him graciously. "You will forgive
  my shaking hands. You see these little dogs are so eager for their walk that
  it is all I can do to hold them. I am Lady Pengwill. You are waiting, I hear,
  to see my daughter."</p>

  <p>"If she can spare me a few minutes," the Inspector murmured.</p>

  <p>"Of course she can," was the emphatic reply. "We would spare every minute
  of our time if we could help in any way towards solving this extraordinary
  mystery. You cannot realize how upset we all are. I hope you have brought us
  some good news."</p>

  <p>The Inspector, who had remained standing, shook his head regretfully.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that we are making very slow progress, Lady Pengwill," he
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"What distresses us so much, as you can imagine," she went on, "is where
  all this enormous sum of money has gone to. Millions and millions, you know,
  and for the moment, at any rate, everything seems to have disappeared. People
  cannot make away with money like that, can they, Mr. Snell?"</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible," the Inspector assured her hopefully. "The money must
  be somewhere, Lady Pengwill, and I have no doubt that before long we shall
  find it for you."</p>

  <p>"Do hurry up, please," she begged. "Really, my husband and I are getting
  quite distressed. I suppose the police know everything so I don't mind
  telling you that my father makes my sister, Lady Tidswell, and me, a quite
  considerable allowance payable only once a year and I did venture to write to
  the bank not very long ago reminding him that this was a terribly extravagant
  season and asking if it was not possible for us to have our allowance a
  little sooner. But I daresay you know all about this. It was the one letter
  which was not opened, I believe, on the morning
  he&mdash;er&mdash;disappeared."</p>

  <p>"I have heard there was a letter," the Inspector murmured.</p>

  <p>"And nobody seems to know anything about the money at all," Lady Pengwill
  went on eagerly. "That is what is so queer. I write to the solicitors in
  Norchester and ask them whether I can rely upon having the money for December
  the first and they can tell me nothing. I ask the same question of Sir
  Theodore, whom I know is my father's executor and whose firm are his London
  solicitors, and he knows nothing. It is a terrible state of suspense to be
  left in, Mr. Snell. I am sure you can understand that."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," the Inspector acquiesced drily, "and of course the fact of
  your father's disappearance must of itself be a great source of anxiety to
  you."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Lady Pengwill agreed. "Well, I won't ask you questions. I'll
  leave you to Lady Diana. She has more brains than I have. But my dear Mr.
  Snell, you will do your best, won't you, to clear this matter up quickly.
  There is the murdered man, too, they found down in the cellar. I had
  forgotten about him for the moment. Most unpleasant."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is the murdered man," he assented with subtle but quite
  imperceptible irony. "But of course the money is the chief thing."</p>

  <p>"How quick you are to grasp things!" Lady Pengwill murmured, smiling
  appreciatively. "It is some time before December the first but if Sir Adam is
  not found before then or the money does not come, I cannot really tell you,
  Mr. Snell, what will become of us."</p>

  <p>Her Ladyship's expressive little face was wrinkled with apprehension. Her
  eyes were moist with tears.</p>

  <p>"I must hurry away now," she went on with a final sigh. "These dear dogs
  do get so restless if they cannot get out by eleven o'clock. If you would
  like to see my husband for anything he is in the library, Mr. Snell. He has
  to make a speech to-night in the Lords but he is really too upset to work
  properly."</p>

  <p>"I will not trouble His Lordship," the Inspector said. "Your daughter can
  tell me all I want to know. Lady Diana has been very helpful already."</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to hear it," her mother declared. "Good morning, Mr.
  Snell," she concluded, waving her hand as she turned towards the door. "Bring
  me some good news soon. I cannot tell you how grateful I shall be."</p>

  <p>The Inspector, who was a little clumsy at getting there but who was just
  in time to open the door, bowed as Her Ladyship passed out with a dazzling
  smile. He heard a brief greeting between mother and daughter in the hall and
  in a moment or two Lady Diana appeared.</p>

  <p>"So you have been talking to Mother," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"For a few minutes," the Inspector acquiesced. "She seems very upset."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, is there any more news?"</p>

  <p>"We are moving on," the Inspector admitted cautiously, "and I must admit,
  Lady Diana, that the trifling success I have met with just lately is entirely
  owing to your efforts. With the man's full name I was able to look up some
  records and I found out&mdash;well, something which put me in a quite
  independent position with regard to him. I paid a visit to the Albany, and a
  very satisfactory one, too. Grainger himself took me to the man who bought
  the various suits and I was able to discover the identity of the murdered
  man."</p>

  <p>"But this is marvellous!" Diana cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is movement," the Inspector agreed. "I discovered that he had
  been in prison for twelve months. I found out where he had been employed and
  that, Lady Diana, I can assure you was most interesting."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she begged.</p>

  <p>"He was employed by the firm who put in those wonderful locker safes in
  the bank, the Averil and Benz Company of Providence, Rhode Island."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please."</p>

  <p>"He was a travelling representative of the firm's. He was sent over by the
  company with a view to opening up a connection on this side somewhere about a
  year ago. On the steamer he seems to have lost his head completely. He got in
  with a gang of card sharpers who were detected at the end of a long session
  of cards in flagrant cheating. At Southampton he was met by the police and
  handed over by the purser to them. He was tried in the ordinary way and
  sentenced to a year's imprisonment."</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary story!" Diana gasped.</p>

  <p>"He was discharged," Snell continued, "just about ten days ago. The day
  after he came out he bought this secondhand suit at Hobbs', he went to the
  Milan and had his hair cut and all that sort of thing, bought a bottle of
  hairwash which was sent to St. Pancras Station addressed to George Bradstone.
  He travelled down to Norchester and what happened to him there we already
  know. According to the instructions he received from his firm before he left
  the States, he was to have paid a visit to Blockton's Bank in Norchester
  immediately upon his arrival in this country. There had been some complaint
  to the firm with regard to the safes which he was to investigate. That was
  why he had been supplied with a master key and some information about the
  safes which he probably committed to memory and destroyed. I should say that
  there was no doubt whatever that instead of presenting himself to Sir Adam as
  an envoy from the firm of Averil and Benz he decided to commit a burglary on
  his own account."</p>

  <p>"So that really, instead of being a victim of murder," Diana observed, "he
  was shot by someone who found him in the vaults and realised that he was
  there for purposes of robbery."</p>

  <p>"So far as we can go without any evidence from Sir Adam," Snell agreed,
  "it does look as though that were the case. I telephoned last evening to
  Providence and they told me that Mr. Averil, the head of the firm, was on his
  way over here. I sent a wireless to him on his steamer. He is arriving in
  Southampton almost immediately and we may expect him any time in Norchester
  to identify the person whose body lies in the mortuary."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's part of the mystery solved," Diana exclaimed. "Inspector,
  you're wonderful!"</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he protested, "that has been all very ordinary
  straightforward work, but remember we may have disappointments to come.
  Anyhow, as you say, a third of the mystery is solved. Mr. Averil will be in
  Norchester very shortly now and I still have certain ideas connected with his
  visit. That is why I propose to return, so as to be there when he arrives.
  What we have discovered is interesting, Lady Diana, but you must remember
  that the main problem remains just as far from solution as ever."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean the disappearance of your grandfather. I am going to devote my
  whole attention to that now because any mystery there is with regard to that
  murder will solve itself. I shall leave for Norchester at noon."</p>

  <p>"I am so thankful to hear that," Diana declared.</p>

  <p>"I thought I should like to be on the spot for several reasons," the
  Inspector went on. "I understand that Sir Theodore has made application to
  the Courts here and although there is no question of Sir Adam's decease being
  presumed at present, they might consent to his Will being read in the
  presence of representatives of the family. This is simply with the idea, as
  Sir Theodore has always urged, that the Will of a very eccentric man like Sir
  Adam might contain some hint as to what has become of him."</p>

  <p>"That sounds very reasonable," Diana agreed.</p>

  <p>"The authorities are always rather slow in taking action in such matters,"
  Snell continued, "but Sir Theodore is doing his best and he hopes that in a
  very short time he, in conjunction with the firm of Mowbray in Norchester,
  will have permission to summon a meeting of the relatives. I expect he has
  told you about this."</p>

  <p>"We have discussed it," Diana admitted.</p>

  <p>"In that case I understand that the reading of the Will is to take place
  in Norchester. I imagine that some representatives of your family will be
  present."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mother will be there all right," the girl declared drily. "Father,
  too, I should think. You will see them all, as soon as the lawyers are ready
  to talk about the money. But that is not quite the point, is it? I feel as I
  think you do, Inspector. I want to know what has become of that old man. He
  was not so bad, really. I know it is absurd of me in these days but I cannot
  get away from the feeling that something terrible has happened to him."</p>

  <p>"The disappearance of the money&mdash;the temporary disappearance, I
  mean," Snell corrected himself hastily, "rather points that way. On the other
  hand, if he has come to any harm such as having been abducted or murdered and
  robbed, who is there likely to have been on the spot in Norchester capable of
  carrying out the scheme and keeping the whole thing so marvellously secret?
  The detection of crime, nowadays, you know, Lady Diana, has become rather
  copybook-like. In an ordinary way, whenever a big coup has been brought off
  we know exactly where to look for the probable criminals, for their probable
  hiding-place and for their probable means of getting rid of the booty. In
  this case we are growing more helpless every day. I had a long conversation
  with the Chief Commissioner this morning, and we agreed upon one thing. There
  is no criminal organisation working in England at this moment, to our
  knowledge, capable of spiriting a man away from a place like the Norchester
  County Club, acquiring the whole of his fortune and keeping him hidden. I
  hope I am not boring you?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least. How could you be? Go on, please."</p>

  <p>"What I wanted to point out was," Snell went on, the lid closing down a
  little farther over his left eye, "that I think if we are to come across any
  solution of this business we shall come across it in Norchester. I told the
  Chief so. I showed him exactly how far I had gone with my local enquiries,
  and he agreed with me. I am going back there to-day and I am rather sorry
  that you will not be on hand."</p>

  <p>"Don't be too sure about that," she laughed. "There is one person there
  who can help you, Mr. Snell, as I expect you know. That is Martin Mowbray. He
  has brains, and though his uncle is the head of the firm he is beginning to
  leave nearly everything to Martin."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," the Inspector admitted. "I look upon Mr. Martin
  Mowbray as being a most intelligent and even brilliant young man. I shall
  telephone to him the moment I arrive. Captain Elmhurst, too, the Chief
  Constable, seems to have a good grip of the case. I shall have a talk with
  him this afternoon. All the same, I am disappointed that you will not be
  there."</p>

  <p>He glanced at the clock and rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am catching the midday express," he explained.</p>

  <p>"And don't be surprised to see me at any moment," she warned him. "I shall
  be down with the rest of the crowd, anyhow, if Sir Theodore succeeds with his
  motion. I wish I knew what lines you were going to work on."</p>

  <p>"And I wish I could tell you, Lady Diana," he rejoined. "But do you know,
  this is such a simple and yet such an extraordinary case that I imagine if I
  began to talk about the possibilities that have passed through my mind you
  would think I was a lunatic."</p>

  <p>"They could not be as far-fetched as my dreams," she grimaced. "I dreamt
  only the other night that the statue of his father at which Sir Adam was
  always jeering turned on him at last, marched into the club through the
  window and crushed everyone to death who was in the room!"</p>

  <p>"Well, my imagination has not gone quite so far as that," he admitted, as
  they walked together towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Where will you stay in Norchester, Inspector?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Write me if you have anything to say care of Captain Elmhurst at the Town
  Hall," he begged. "Mr. Martin Mowbray was good enough to tell me that I might
  go out and stay with him next time I came, but I have funny ideas when I am
  on a case. I like, for some part of the day, and certainly at night, to be in
  a sense living with it."</p>

  <p>"I can quite understand that," she agreed as she led him down the hall
  towards the entrance. "Martin Mowbray's bachelor house is a perfect gem of a
  place, though&mdash;real Queen Anne&mdash;with beautiful gardens, tennis
  court and a swimming pool. All the same, it is quite ten miles from
  Norchester and that might not suit you."</p>

  <p>He smiled as the taxi which the butler had summoned drove up to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Not quite," he admitted.</p>

  <p>She watched him enter the vehicle and waved her hand. Her mother, coming
  in from her walk, found her there still looking after the taxi.</p>

  <p>"Your friend the detective seems to have given you something to think
  about, Diana," she remarked hopefully.</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, I believe I am just beginning to appreciate
  him," Diana confessed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20"
     name="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

  <p class="first">SNELL drove straight to the Town Hall on his arrival in
  Norchester and was fortunate enough to catch Captain Elmhurst, who was on the
  point of packing up for an afternoon's tennis.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you back again, Snell," the latter declared. "Anything
  doing in town?"</p>

  <p>"I have made a little progress in one direction," Snell acknowledged, "but
  I am afraid it is not likely to yield quite the results I had hoped for."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst took him by the arm and led him into his office.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and tell me about it," he insisted. "I don't mind confessing
  that this blasted affair is getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems as though we shall be able to clear up a portion of it
  before long," Snell confided. "I know the name of the murdered man and I
  think it is pretty clear why he was discovered in the bank cellar."</p>

  <p>"Capital!"</p>

  <p>"His name or the name he was passing under was Bradstone, and he came down
  here the day after he was released from prison."</p>

  <p>"What charge?"</p>

  <p>"Cheating at cards on an American liner. He was a representative of the
  firm of Averil and Benz, the manufacturers of those locker safes, and he was
  on his way to England to visit the customers and attend to some complaints
  which had been received from Blockton's Bank."</p>

  <p>"You have been finding out things, Snell," the Chief Constable remarked.
  "Good work! Tell me some more."</p>

  <p>"I have talked with the firm by telephone and I have cabled to Mr. Averil,
  who is on the way over here. It is pretty clear what this fellow Bradstone
  had been planning out whilst he was in gaol. He had the master key of the
  safes and he was down there for burglary. He got into the bank all right, but
  in the very act of descending the stairs into the vault he was shot."</p>

  <p>"Very glib, Mr. Inspector," Elmhurst commented with a smile, "but by whom
  and where's the weapon?"</p>

  <p>"I have the revolver," Snell replied. "I found it in a very ingenious
  hiding-place while I was poking about that carpenter's bench where Sir Adam
  used to tie up his parcels. It is a beautiful weapon, cleaned recently but
  with traces still there of the first barrel's having been fired."</p>

  <p>"Good work," Elmhurst acknowledged. "But we are still up against the
  central difficulty&mdash;who shot Bradstone?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think," Snell said, his left eyelid drooping a little, "that
  there will be any difficulty about answering that question very shortly.
  There are distinct finger-marks upon the butt of the revolver. I have
  compared them with some very poor impressions I was able to get of Sir
  Adam's, and it is an absolute certainty that they are not his. The person
  whom I really suspect is a little difficult to deal with but the opportunity
  to get his fingerprints will come. I shall have them, Captain, in the course
  of a few days; and then I shall be able to answer your question. Will you do
  me a favour, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will."</p>

  <p>"I am rather ashamed of myself, in a way," Snell went on, "but what I did
  I did in the cause of justice. I have nothing to say against Fanshawe. He is
  an excellent man in any ordinary case he might have to deal with but he is at
  times&mdash;just a little loquacious."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you're right," Elmhurst agreed. "He is in the case, though, and I
  don't see how he is to be got rid of altogether."</p>

  <p>"Don't try," Snell begged eagerly. "We will work together all right and he
  shall have his full share of the credit that is due to him when we clear
  things up. But I have a small confession to make. I came to the conclusion
  that it was better to keep what I knew about the revolver to myself until I
  had got the other fingerprints, and I played a trick upon him the other
  evening. I wanted to be left alone in the vault and I sent him away on a
  fool's errand to see how long it took to get to the bank door from the vault
  through Sir Adam's quarters. As soon as he had gone I discovered the little
  hiding-place in the bench, found the revolver and tucked it away before he
  came back."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst fingered his upper lip for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that I can blame you, Inspector," he acknowledged. "You,
  after all, are the superior officer and we are looking to you to clear the
  case up. You must use your own methods. I promise that I won't say a word to
  Fanshawe. As you know, he has had to leave the case for a few days. The
  matter he is dealing with is a purely local one, but it is of some
  importance; and I think it could be easily arranged, without hurting his
  feelings or his prestige, that he drops out of this business altogether, if
  you consider it best."</p>

  <p>"We might leave that, sir," Snell suggested, "until we see how long he is
  away. My chief concern is that even when we get the formal identification of
  the murdered man it will not help us in the least towards finding Sir Adam or
  the money. Nothing fresh down here, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"What can there be fresh?" the Chief Constable exclaimed a little
  irritably. "Fanshawe had some wild idea that we ought to find out what
  Haskell&mdash;one of the two clerks, you know&mdash;is up to. We heard he had
  gone off to Scotland on a golfing holiday, which sounded a bit opulent.
  Anyhow, we are making enquiries but I don't think there's anything in it. His
  fortnight's holiday was due and he just took it."</p>

  <p>"Is the other young man still here?"</p>

  <p>"He turns up every morning but there's nothing for him to do. If I were
  the Mowbrays I would close the bank but they won't listen to it. Martin comes
  down for an hour in the morning and sits in the office and the clerk outside
  works on football pools and cross-word puzzles. There hasn't been even a
  whisper about the old man nor a sign of the money."</p>

  <p>"You remind me of Lady Pengwill," the detective observed with a grim
  little smile.</p>

  <p>"Never met the lady."</p>

  <p>"Nor did I until this morning. She was very voluble about the terrible
  state of distress they were all in but I found out that they were not
  thinking about the old man at all. They were wondering whether their December
  the first cheque for their allowance would materialise!"</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, her sister is very much the same way," he confided. "Lady Tidswell
  is crazy about the money. She rings us up every day and it is always with the
  hope of hearing if news has come from some foreign bank that the old man may
  have had dealings with. They had half a million each when they were married,
  too."</p>

  <p>"From Sir Adam?"</p>

  <p>"From Sir Adam, of course."</p>

  <p>"It's a lot of money to get rid of."</p>

  <p>"Extravagance and bad investments will soon play the devil with even half
  a million," Elmhurst declared. "Anyhow, now that you are here, Snell, give us
  an idea of what the next step is to be."</p>

  <p>Snell's eyelid had drooped lower than ever. His tone was deprecating,
  almost apologetic.</p>

  <p>"You may feel inclined to smile at me, sir," he confessed, "but whenever I
  have a case like this or anything like it I have a fancy to spend a short
  time on the exact spot. I am feeling like that about this affair. Sir Adam
  disappeared from the Norchester County Club just across the way, didn't
  he?"</p>

  <p>"That is so."</p>

  <p>"It seems outrageously impossible," Snell went on, "but I cannot get away
  from the idea that some one of the people who are still there must have an
  idea what has become of the old man. I cannot help feeling that if we just
  sit down and wait, keep our eyes open and listen, some day or other we shall
  get an inkling as to what has become of him."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I won't argue with you," he remarked. "It all seems terribly open
  country, though. Not a suspicious character or a suspicious circumstance
  about the place. Martin Mowbray and I have talked it threadbare. Everything
  goes on exactly as it did before. Everyone seems just as anxious as we are
  ourselves to find out what has become of that old gentleman. I can't help
  wondering what you are likely to get by hanging round here, really, but I
  have not the slightest desire to stand in your way."</p>

  <p>"In your position I should feel exactly as you do," Snell confessed, "but
  you must remember the old saying: 'Familiarity breeds contempt.' You are
  utterly and entirely familiar with the place. You cannot therefore believe in
  anything unusual happening there beyond that one gruesome incident. If I am
  asking too much, now, please say so. There are, I understand, bedrooms at the
  club."</p>

  <p>"Of a sort&mdash;yes, there are," Elmhurst admitted. "I slept there once
  when the family were all away and it was not so bad."</p>

  <p>"I should like," Snell confided, and at that moment his left eyelid
  absolutely covered his eye, "I should like, if it were possible, to be made a
  temporary member and to have a bedroom there."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;to stay right in the club?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," the Chief Constable agreed, after a moment's
  reflection.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Snell went on diffidently, "the members might feel that they
  did not care about having a detective officer accepted as a guest of the club
  staying there, and if there is any feeling of that sort you must tell
  me."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, how could there be? Yours is an honourable profession.
  Besides, there is scarcely a member who, if he thought you were doing any
  good by being on the spot and concentrating your thoughts, as it were, upon
  your job&mdash;why, there is no one who would not be glad to have you around.
  I'm a little late for my appointment but I'll take you over at once, if you
  like, and arrange it."</p>

  <p>"That would suit me excellently," Snell assented. "My taxi is still at the
  door with my bag."</p>

  <p>The two men made their way to the club, which, as usual, was deserted at
  that hour. Captain Elmhurst ordered tea and asked for the Visitors' Book. He
  entered Snell's name and sent for Lawford, who came in immediately. The
  latter bowed to Elmhurst and recognised Snell with a respectful smile.</p>

  <p>"Lawford," the Chief Constable explained, "Mr. Snell is staying down in
  Norchester for a week or ten days. Can you find him a room here?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir, with pleasure," was the unhesitating reply. "It is
  fortunate that Mr. Harwood went away yesterday. The best room is vacant. It
  has a bath and is of quite a reasonable size."</p>

  <p>"Well, there we are, then," Elmhurst declared, signing a chit for the tea
  and lighting a cigarette. "If I hurry away, Snell, I am sure you will forgive
  me. I will tell Martin Mowbray you are here and I daresay he will look in and
  see you later in the evening."</p>

  <p>"We will try and make the gentleman comfortable," Lawford promised. "I
  will have your bag sent up at once, sir," he went on, turning to Snell. "We
  have a small house dinner from half-past seven&mdash;or if you would like to
  order something special&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Inspector waved his hand.</p>

  <p>"I am sure the house dinner will do excellently for me, steward," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Johnson will look after you, the boy who is usually about in the hall,"
  Lawford suggested. "He will unpack your things and I hope if there is
  anything you would like in the room or anything we can do to make you more
  comfortable, you will say so."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you indeed," Snell murmured.</p>

  <p>Elmhurst hurried off and the Inspector settled down to make himself at
  home. He finished his tea, filled his pipe very deliberately and seated
  himself in the now famous chair with a pile of illustrated papers on the
  table within his reach. For a time, however, he smoked without reading. His
  eyes were fixed upon the statue outside. It occurred to him dreamily that
  from where he sat the eyes of the statue, which seemed to be looking straight
  through the window, must, if only they had been gifted with a moment of human
  vision, have seen all that had happened on that Tuesday morning. They must
  have seen Lawford announcing luncheon and taking his leave. They must have
  seen whoever else might have entered that room within the next few minutes.
  They must have seen the old man in the chair disappear. It gave Snell, who
  was a man of many emotions, a distinct thrill to sit there and reflect upon
  those things. For the first time, he experienced a feeling of confidence. He
  was there. He was going to stay there. Even if it was with the supernatural
  he had to deal, and Inspector Snell did not believe in the supernatural, he
  was going to find out how that little old gentleman had been decoyed from the
  room and in what part of the world he lay hidden.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21"
     name="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was one of Inspector Snell's peculiarities that he liked
  so far as possible to live in the atmosphere of his surroundings. On a
  previous visit to the club in the evening he had noticed several men in
  dinner coats. When he had packed his bag before leaving London he had been
  careful to include a similar article of attire. He sat now, at about
  half-past seven, in a comfortable easy chair watching Johnson, the red-haired
  hall porter, fitting studs into his shirt.</p>

  <p>"Anything much doing in the club after dinner?" he asked the young
  man.</p>

  <p>"Very little, sir," the latter replied. "There's a few of them comes in
  for a game of billiards or snooker sometimes and they did start a bridge
  evening. It's never gone very well, though, especially at this time of the
  year. Most of the members live in the country and they like to be out in
  their gardens when they get home."</p>

  <p>"I'm like that," Snell confided. "I have only a strip of garden and I look
  after it myself. Get a lot of fun out of it, too. You sleep in the club, I
  suppose, Johnson?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Downstairs?"</p>

  <p>"In the basement, sir."</p>

  <p>"Rather a large basement, isn't it?" Snell asked.</p>

  <p>"It was, sir. They blocked up some of it last time they had the workmen
  here."</p>

  <p>"I like more fresh air, myself," the Inspector confessed.</p>

  <p>Johnson continued his task in silence. Snell watched him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I have rather a bad memory for faces, Johnson," he observed. "Was it you
  who were on duty in the hall the day when Sir Adam disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir."</p>

  <p>"I remember you now, of course. I asked you a few questions, didn't I,
  about the car that was standing outside."</p>

  <p>"You did seem curious about it, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll tell you why," Snell explained. "My idea was that Sir Adam
  might have left the club in a car and it was the only one hanging about at
  the time."</p>

  <p>The young man smiled. He looked at the shirt, now complete with studs and
  links, then he fetched some braces from a drawer and shook out the
  Inspector's trousers.</p>

  <p>"I can't ever make out, sir," he said, "why no one else took any notice of
  that car. If I had been Captain Elmhurst I would have shown a lot more
  interest about it."</p>

  <p>"Tell me why, Johnson?" Snell asked encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, for one thing, sir," he confided, as he attached the braces to the
  garment he was carrying, "it was a very high-powered motor. I never heard a
  sound when it drew up. And for another, the lettering on it was all strange.
  To this day there is no one in the yarn warehouse next door who seems to have
  seen it."</p>

  <p>"That seems queer," Snell remarked.</p>

  <p>"It is queer, sir. Mr. Donnithorne himself, who is the yarn agent, he
  doesn't own an auto," Johnson continued, "no more does his partner. They're
  both positive that no one called upon them in a car of that description
  during the morning. Then what I says is&mdash;what was it doing outside?
  There was a foreign-looking chauffeur to it and all."</p>

  <p>"I will make enquiries about it," Snell promised.</p>

  <p>"And this is worth remembering, too, sir," the young man went on as he
  gave Snell's shoes a final rub and looked round for the shoehorn. "The moment
  all that hullabaloo started I thought about the car and I looked outside
  where it had been standing. It was gone. Of course it may have been waiting
  there for a gentleman in one of the offices down the Welford Road but it
  doesn't seem likely."</p>

  <p>"You didn't notice that strange lettering, I suppose?" Snell enquired.</p>

  <p>Johnson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I didn't take any interest in the car, sir, except that I remembered it
  being there. Is there anything more I can do, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Not a thing, thanks. You had better hurry along down. They will be
  wanting you to serve dinner.</p>

  <p>"I will come up again if you ring, sir."</p>

  <p>Snell completed his toilet and descended to the billiard room. He ordered
  a cocktail and the evening paper. They were brought him by the billiard
  marker. Afterwards he strolled across to the window and looked down into the
  street below.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing, Charles," he asked, "when all that fuss occurred
  last week?"</p>

  <p>"About Sir Adam, sir?"</p>

  <p>"About Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"Well, I was up here brushing the table and didn't know anything about it
  at the time."</p>

  <p>"Did you notice the car outside that Johnson has been telling me
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Can't say that I did, sir," the youth admitted. "I may have glanced out
  of the window once or twice casually but I didn't notice a car. I saw Sir
  Adam drive up at the usual time but his Rolls-Royce went off at once."</p>

  <p>Snell took down a cue and made a few shots with the touch of an expert.
  The youth watched him admiringly.</p>

  <p>"Would you like a game, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Snell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm going down to dinner directly. We may have a game afterwards,
  perhaps. I really looked in," he added, as he put his cue back in the rack,
  "because Johnson was talking to me about that automobile and I wanted to see
  whether it would have been visible from here."</p>

  <p>"I could not have helped but see it if I had looked down," the marker
  admitted, "but I can't remember even going to the window."</p>

  <p>"Obstinate young man, Johnson, I should think," Snell observed.</p>

  <p>"Very likely, sir."</p>

  <p>A pageboy knocked at the door and looked in.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Martin Mowbray is downstairs, sir," he announced. "He wants to know
  if he should come up or if you are ready for dinner."</p>

  <p>"Tell him I'm on my way down," Snell replied.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>There were very few diners at the club that evening and Snell and Martin
  Mowbray were completely isolated in the corner which the former had chosen.
  Notwithstanding the emptiness of the place, Lawford, as immaculate as ever,
  stood at his desk or now and then slowly promenaded the room, glancing at the
  plates and exchanging a word or two with his three or four clients.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you are able to keep a man like that down here," Snell
  observed.</p>

  <p>"Too good for his job, you mean?"</p>

  <p>The detective assented.</p>

  <p>"I should say he was quite up to West End form," he remarked. "Seems a
  singular lack of ambition to stay here all the time. Have any of the members
  taken any special interest in him?"</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray grinned.</p>

  <p>"The worst of you sleuths," he said, "is that you never can put the cards
  upon the table."</p>

  <p>"No need, is there?" his companion asked a little wearily, his eyes
  half-closed and fixed upon his plate. "I have asked to be allowed to stay
  here just to study the place and its inmates, Lawford included, at close
  quarters. I expect Captain Elmhurst guessed that when I made my proposition.
  I am quite sure you did when you heard that I was here. You must have guessed
  it when I asked for the plans of the club."</p>

  <p>"Did you get them all right?"</p>

  <p>"I got them all right, thank you. They are very poor plans but there are
  points of interest about them. Have you ever been all over the place, Mr.
  Mowbray&mdash;cellars, basement, everywhere?"</p>

  <p>"A dozen times," the young man replied. "I am on the kitchen
  committee."</p>

  <p>"Clean, well found and that sort of thing? No locked up dungeons or
  anything of that kind?"</p>

  <p>"Not a trace of anything mediæval," Martin assured him. "You were asking
  just now whether any member had shown any particular interest in
  Lawford."</p>

  <p>"Yes, have they?"</p>

  <p>"Never Sir Adam," Martin declared. "We have a Christmas Club list which my
  uncle always heads with a fiver. I give the same. So do half-a-dozen others
  in the club. Sir Adam just puts his initials there, hasn't the face to write
  his name out, and gives one pound. I don't honestly believe that he has ever
  given Lawford a tip in his life, and I shouldn't think that there was a
  member here who gave more trouble."</p>

  <p>Lawford, passing near by in one of his promenades, paused to fill their
  glasses with wine.</p>

  <p>"A good bottle, I hope, Mr. Mowbray?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Excellent. Been down to the cricket grounds yet?"</p>

  <p>Lawford's face lost its air of calm indifference.</p>

  <p>"I was there yesterday evening, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Anything hopeful?"</p>

  <p>"A young bowler, sir. Comes from Twyford right out in the country. He is a
  little erratic, but Field is interested in him and thinks he's going to shape
  marvellously. I&mdash;You will excuse me, Mr. Mowbray," the steward went on.
  "It is scarcely my affair, of course, but I did think of suggesting to one or
  two gentlemen that they help with the fund to keep him on the ground and give
  him a trial with the Colts and perhaps for one of the minor matches. He is
  quite young and if he were only sure of making a living at it he would be
  much more enthusiastic. He has his mother to support and he is a
  conscientious young fellow."</p>

  <p>"What is his position?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>"He is working as a carpenter. Gets about thirty-five shillings a week.
  The club would give him a pound a week to go on the ground staff and more, of
  course, if he turned out all right, but he would have to give up Twyford and
  live in Norchester. I thought if one or two of you gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can put me down for a fiver," Martin interrupted. "I will go down and
  see him one afternoon with you, Lawford. If he's really got it in him I will
  see that he gets a rise early in the season. It's no good taking too much
  notice of these Colts matches. The lads are always over-eager."</p>

  <p>Lawford seemed genuinely grateful.</p>

  <p>"It is exceedingly kind of you, sir," he said. "The young man's name is
  Morris. I put on the pads myself with him for quarter of an hour the other
  night and I can assure you, although the wicket was nothing to help him, he
  was turning them half a foot easy. He put in a fast one without giving me the
  slightest warning or changing his action and bowled my middle stump out of
  the ground."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting."</p>

  <p>Lawford passed on with a little bow.</p>

  <p>"Quite a human touch," Snell observed. "Ever been thoroughly over our shop
  up at the Yard, Mr. Mowbray?"</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"We have a collection of odd things representing the hobbies of famous
  criminals," Snell told him. "You perhaps do not know, sir, that Peace was
  quite a cricketer, and that young fellow who had such an extraordinary escape
  from the gallows&mdash;Forsetter&mdash;he is still almost scratch at golf. He
  is allowed to play over the Governor's private links every now and then.. ..
  He's saved a little money, I suppose, Lawford?"</p>

  <p>"I should think so," Martin replied. "And I must warn you of this, Snell.
  There will be an insurrection amongst the members if you tap him on the
  shoulder one day, for some of them would rather be murdered in their sleep, I
  think, than lose Lawford."</p>

  <p>"I don't think they have any need to worry," Snell observed. "He seems to
  me the model steward and citizen."</p>

  <p>"He is a model husband, too. Has a very good-looking wife. No children,
  though."</p>

  <p>"Is his wife the cook?"</p>

  <p>His companion nodded.</p>

  <p>"She's the cook, all right," he admitted, "but there's nothing of the
  <i>intriguante</i> about Mrs. Lawford. Cinema once a week, cold supper that
  night instead of dinner, a fortnight at Blackpool in the summer and a trip to
  London twice a year when the sales are on. The Christian Science hall here
  twice a day on Sundays."</p>

  <p>"Christian Scientist, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, you're getting to know all about the family, aren't you? You must
  not take that too seriously, though. I talked to the dear lady one day and
  she is not by any means a fanatic."</p>

  <p>The Inspector sighed.</p>

  <p>"I should love to have supper in the kitchen one day with those two."</p>

  <p>"That you never will have. They have their supper in their own sitting
  room and the kitchen maid waits on them. Snug little place it is, too. Now
  and then they have a party, always giving notice first to a member of the
  committee. They entertain one or two of the principal
  tradespeople&mdash;generally bridge afterwards, I believe."</p>

  <p>"What about the red-headed youth who waits on me&mdash;Johnson, I think
  his name is?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he's been here since he was a pageboy, at least ten years, I should
  think. He's a trifle dull sometimes but he's perfectly steady and a good
  worker."</p>

  <p>"He is the young man," Snell reflected, "who spoke about a large car
  outside the warehouse next door on the day of Sir Adam's disappearance."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Mowbray assented. "I know Elmhurst got Fanshawe to ask a
  few more questions about it. The yarn people themselves knew nothing of any
  visitor that morning and certainly had no callers at that time."</p>

  <p>"I have been talking with Johnson about it," Snell confided. "He sticks to
  his story&mdash;a large car, powerful, with foreign lettering, there when Sir
  Adam came into the club and gone as soon as the alarm of his disappearance
  was started."</p>

  <p>Martin remained indifferent.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you won't make anything out of that car, Snell," he said. "For
  one thing, no one else, not even the people in the yarn warehouse, seem to
  have seen it, and then you have to bear in mind that Johnson is not the
  brightest of young men. If Sir Adam made his escape in that he would have had
  to pass through the hall, down the steps and on to the pavement. Well, there
  were members dribbling in all the time. Someone would have seen him for
  certain."</p>

  <p>"I expect you're right," Snell admitted. "I was not taking Johnson's
  statement too seriously, I can assure you. By the by, where is the back
  entrance to the club? I can't see it marked on the plan."</p>

  <p>"It used to be the principal one," Martin told him. "It is just round the
  corner in Pemberton's Walk. That little bit of the old house that's left,
  fronting this way, with the oak door."</p>

  <p>They ordered their coffee in the reading room. Snell, who seemed sleepy
  and languid, strolled about glancing at the pictures, here and there
  furtively tapping the very solid wall.</p>

  <p>"Have a <i>fine</i>?" the young lawyer invited.</p>

  <p>"I'm too sleepy already," Snell confessed. "Mr. Mowbray," he went on,
  relapsing into an easy chair, "may I ask a question which is just a little
  outside the orbit of my interests for the moment, only indirectly connected
  with them, anyhow?"</p>

  <p>"Dash it all, man," Martin expostulated, "you are a Chief Inspector of
  Scotland Yard. That's good enough for anyone. Ask any questions you like and
  drop that inferiority complex, for heaven's sake."</p>

  <p>"How about the finances&mdash;Sir Adam's estate? Have there been any
  developments there whilst I was away?"</p>

  <p>"Very few," the other answered. "If you are thinking of that cheque for
  five thousand pounds, our agents in Paris are making enquiries and I expect
  that will come out all right. The man to whom it was payable, Walter Ruffin,
  is a perfectly respectable dealer in bonds, and he has offered to show me his
  books and prove the debt at any time I choose. Incidentally, we have heard
  that there have been rumours of a well-known English banker transacting
  business through an agent on the stock exchange in Bucharest. Then it really
  does seem as though we were on the track of some dealings in New York but
  they were all for bearer bonds and we have no definite information yet."</p>

  <p>"And about that little matter of opening the Will?"</p>

  <p>"Sir Theodore has made his application to the Lords of the Treasury, or
  whatever these Johnnies call themselves. He has applied for permission to
  have the Will read to the family in case it gives us any indication as to the
  whereabouts of the estate. The Will itself was drawn up a great many years
  ago by a member of our firm who is now dead. The document which was found in
  Sir Adam's desk labelled 'Copy of Will' will also be opened if the
  application is granted."</p>

  <p>"It should be granted," Snell reflected, "but of course it might interfere
  with investigations conducted upon other lines."</p>

  <p>"Exactly what do you mean by that?" Martin Mowbray asked.</p>

  <p>"Rather stupid to-night, I'm afraid I am," the Inspector apologised. "What
  I meant was this. Supposing Sir Adam is being held by&mdash;well,
  kidnappers&mdash;the announcement of the Will having been read might lead to
  Sir Adam's release but it would certainly lead to the disappearance of the
  estate. Then again, if Sir Adam has been murdered, as seems the most likely
  thesis at present, the estate would be dumped on the market and I should
  think probably dissipated. There would be a panic sale of all bonds and the
  securities generally."</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray was thoughtful for a minute or two.</p>

  <p>"You are not altogether in favour, then, of this step which Sir Theodore
  proposes to take?"</p>

  <p>"It is a little out of my line," Snell confessed. "I only see things,
  perhaps, with the vision of a detective. It seems like a frontal attack when
  a rear or a flank attack is still being pressed."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about being pressed. How far have we got, up till now?"</p>

  <p>Once more Snell counted on the fingers of his hand.</p>

  <p>"It is only eight days," he said, "since Sir Adam disappeared. It is not a
  long time."</p>

  <p>"It seems a long time to those hungry relatives," Martin observed.</p>

  <p>His companion smiled slowly. His rather thick lips seemed to find
  difficulty in parting but it was distinctly a smile.</p>

  <p>"I have only met one of them, apart from Lady Diana," he said. "The
  Countess of Pengwill. She was not very interested in the murdered man. She
  did not seem to care very much where her father was or what had become of
  him, but she was full of shivering anxiety as to the whereabouts of those
  millions."</p>

  <p>Martin chuckled.</p>

  <p>"That's the Countess down to the ground," he declared. "She and her sister
  had half a million each from the old man when they were married&mdash;the one
  to Pengwill and the other to Tidswell. My uncle believes that it is entirely
  through the Tidswells that Sir Adam went so cranky and refused permission to
  any member of the family to enter the bank. Tidswell swaggered in there one
  day&mdash;it was the year he was Lord Lieutenant&mdash;and asked the old man
  point blank for an overdraft of a hundred thousand. Sir Adam showed him the
  account where he was already three thousand overdrawn and said if he wrote
  another cheque upon the bank even for five pounds it would be dishonoured.
  Then he called in Dyson and out went the Lord Lieutenant."</p>

  <p>"Humorous old dog, Sir Adam," Snell meditated.</p>

  <p>Martin glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he said, "I must be off. I promised to look in and see my uncle
  if I was in town to-night and he goes to bed early. You know where to find
  me, Snell&mdash;or Elmhurst, or my uncle at any time. We shan't interfere
  with you. The only thing is&mdash;go easy with Fanshawe when he comes back.
  He's a decent chap, although he is not up to this type of case."</p>

  <p>"I have already written to Inspector Fanshawe," Snell confided. "I told
  him that I had come down here to have a further consultation with him, and
  Captain Elmhurst, and begged him to call in and see me on his return."</p>

  <p>"Very thoughtful of you. He will appreciate that. Well, good night,
  Snell," he added, rising to his feet. "I hope you will sleep well. Anyhow, I
  am sure you will be more comfortable here than in any of the hotels."</p>

  <p>Snell strolled to the front doorsteps and watched his companion drive off
  in his coupé. He stood there for a moment enjoying the air. In the
  semidarkness the statue opposite seemed to be looming unreasonably large
  against the shadowy background. Lawford, who had followed the two men out,
  spoke to him respectfully from behind.</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wonder, sir, whether that old gentleman up there had any
  strange adventures in his life."</p>

  <p>The Inspector nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Lawford," he confided, "something of the same idea came to
  me just now. For a graven image of marble or granite or whatever it may be
  made of, I never saw a statue which seemed to me to change as that does.
  Once, in the daytime, I fancied that I caught him smiling at me. Now to-night
  he seems to be twice the size&mdash;gazing at us and at the club in
  positively amazing fashion. One could almost imagine that the
  late&mdash;mayor, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir."</p>

  <p>"Had a sort of grudge against his position."</p>

  <p>"It's one of the finest situations in the town, sir. By all accounts he
  deserved it, too. My father used to say that the old gentleman saved the
  place millions in rates and that he had the brains of a Chancellor of the
  Exchequer."</p>

  <p>Snell reclimbed the steps.</p>

  <p>"It seems a pity," he sighed, "that he had an eccentric descendant like
  Sir Adam to give us so much trouble."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Detective Inspector Snell indulged in a final whisky-and-soda in the
  reading room. He sat there for almost an hour with a magazine upon his knee.
  Then he mounted to his bedroom and slowly removed the greater part of his
  clothing. He fetched the small alarm clock, which had been placed upon the
  dressing case, to the side of his bed. For several minutes he hesitated, then
  he set it for three o'clock, locked his door, lay down upon the bed and
  covered himself with an eiderdown.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22"
     name="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

  <p class="first">LAWFORD himself, neat and as carefully dressed as ever,
  served Snell with his bacon and eggs and coffee in the morning. He produced
  also a roll of the morning papers and pointed to one paragraph with a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"I notice that the public are beginning to blame the police already for
  not having found Sir Adam," he observed. "After all, it is only a matter of
  nine days since the poor old gentleman disappeared."</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell glanced round the empty room and Lawford, accepting the
  hint, leaned a few inches closer over the table.</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned, Lawford," he said, "you must remember that the
  police have far greater responsibilities with regard to a definite crime than
  the, I hope, temporary disappearance of an elderly gentleman of eccentric
  habits. Our efforts at the moment are directed towards solving the mystery of
  the murder of that unknown man in the bank. When we have finished with that
  we can deal a little more confidently with the other matter."</p>

  <p>"That seems quite reasonable, sir, when one looks at it in the proper
  way," Lawford admitted, and one might have fancied there was an undernote of
  relief in his tone. "The murder of that man in the vaults of the bank and him
  never being identified&mdash;that's what I call a mystery indeed. It will
  take some brains, sir, to solve that."</p>

  <p>"It's got to be done," the Inspector declared. "I sometimes think that
  criminals don't pause long enough to reflect upon how seldom they are able to
  bring off a crime of any sort without being detected. In Scotland Yard we
  have a manuscript written by a very brilliant young scholar who is in
  Dartmoor for the rest of his life but who is allowed the use of the library.
  He calls it <i>Does Crime Pay?</i> and he's been able to show pretty clearly
  that it doesn't. He has petitioned the Home Secretary to let him have it
  printed and distributed amongst the prisoners."</p>

  <p>"An excellent idea, sir," Lawford agreed. "Shall you be in to lunch
  to-day, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Snell replied. "I am going over to have another look at the
  bank premises this morning. Do you know anything of the man Dyson who is
  still door porter there, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"A very respectable person, sir. Otherwise I don't know much about him.
  They say that he has been a little queer in his head, though, since this
  affair."</p>

  <p>The Inspector smiled meditatively as he filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"Looks as though we should all have a headache or two before we clear up
  the trouble," he observed, as he left the room.</p>

  <p>Snell found the iron gate of the bank unfastened and Dyson was waiting on
  the other side of the mahogany door to answer his greeting. The Inspector
  glanced at him casually as he entered. His voice and expression were still
  those of a tired man.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Martin Mowbray is in the bank parlour, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>Martin was seated in Sir Adam's chair, his elbows upon the table, his head
  supported by his two hands, studying a typewritten letter spread out before
  him. He greeted the Inspector in somewhat absent fashion.</p>

  <p>"Got hold of something?" the latter asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," Martin replied. "I have just come across this letter from
  New York. It is from the firm who fixed up those locker safes&mdash;Averil
  and Benz Company they call themselves, of Providence, Rhode Island. It is
  addressed to Sir Adam. It is quite an ordinary communication&mdash;simply a
  request to be allowed to supply another client with a set of locker safes as
  fitted to this bank twenty years ago. You will see the firm go on to say that
  they recognise that Sir Adam bought the patent but as it expires next year
  they don't suppose he would make any objection. Evidently the old man didn't
  have his correspondence copied, for here's a note of his reply, in his own
  handwriting: 'Wrote and told these people I'd see them damned first.' Then
  there's a cable from this same company, which was delivered here half an hour
  ago," Martin went on, "saying that a member of the board of the Averil and
  Benz Company is on his way over and will call upon Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"That," Inspector Snell announced, "is without a doubt in reply to the
  telephone conversation I had with the firm."</p>

  <p>Martin looked across at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean&mdash;telephone conversation you had with the firm?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>The Inspector blinked for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Just an idea of my own, Mr. Mowbray," he confided. "Part of my job was to
  discover what had become of the money which should have been stored in those
  safes. Another part was to discover the reason for the murder in the
  vault."</p>

  <p>"Well, I get that," Martin admitted. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"As regards the murder in the vault we are making progress," the Inspector
  continued slowly. "We shall soon be in a position to assume that the murdered
  man had special knowledge concerning those safes and the day after he was
  released from prison he came down to Norchester with the idea of turning that
  knowledge to practical use. His murder destroyed the chance of our finding
  out any information he might have had which we hadn't. That's why I
  telephoned to the makers of the safes in Rhode Island and afterwards
  wirelessed to the representative who is on board the <i>Homeric</i> and
  that's why we may expect a visit from him at any moment now."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" Martin exclaimed. "And I was beginning to wonder,
  Snell, whether you were not just a little bit of a fraud."</p>

  <p>Snell enjoyed the joke in his own peculiar way. He laughed very softly and
  very quietly.</p>

  <p>"I'm ready to talk, Mr. Mowbray, as soon as I know anything, but it's a
  weakness of mine to keep my mouth closed until I have something to say. Do
  you mind opening up the vault?"</p>

  <p>Martin threw back the carpet and the Inspector turned on the light. The
  two men stood side by side looking down at the row of locker safes, the doors
  of which had been duly closed. They certainly presented a very solid, not to
  say impregnable appearance.</p>

  <p>"What is the special patent about those safes? I wonder," Snell reflected.
  "Over ten thousand pounds the old man paid for the patent alone, apart from
  their fitting."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's rather a wonderful lock," Martin reminded him, "and they're
  supposed to resist every form of damage&mdash;fire, bombs and all the rest of
  it. I can't see what advantage it was to the old man, though, to buy the
  patent."</p>

  <p>"Said anything about this to Dyson yet?" Snell asked.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. I only came across the letter a few minutes ago. Directly I
  opened the cable I took down an old file and found it at once."</p>

  <p>"If you haven't mentioned it, I shouldn't," Snell suggested.</p>

  <p>"You are not by way of mistrusting poor old Dyson, I hope?" Martin
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Not the least bit in the world," was the careful reply. "It is not the
  man himself I would mistrust. It is his capacity for silence, if you know
  what I mean. He doesn't look well to me. He looks just in that nervous state
  when he might talk at any moment to anybody."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't much to talk about, has he?"</p>

  <p>"No, but we are opening up a new line of investigation which might lead to
  discoveries at any moment."</p>

  <p>"The lockers?"</p>

  <p>"The patent."</p>

  <p>Martin's smile was a little incredulous.</p>

  <p>"Let's go and open one of them," Snell suggested. "Say Number Three."</p>

  <p>Martin mounted the stairs, unlocked a drawer of the desk and produced the
  long key. He brought it down to the cellar. Snell took it into his hand and
  examined it carefully.</p>

  <p>"The idea of having one key to deal with all these lockers in the way it
  does," he remarked, looking at it closely, "would justify the patent, I
  suppose, without anything further. Still, let's have a try."</p>

  <p>They moved aside the metal covering to the lock, pushed the key into its
  place and turned. The door opened quite easily. Snell went down on his hands
  and knees and examined the sides, the shelves, the floor and the rest of the
  interior. Then he got up, shook the dust off his clothes and relocked the
  safe.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely solid," he admitted. "Not a give or a joint anywhere. Never
  mind. We can afford not to hurry about this part of the business."</p>

  <p>"You are very mysterious this morning," Martin protested. "Why can
  we?"</p>

  <p>"What I mean is this," Snell explained, letting the tap in the small basin
  run on his hands for a minute and drying them on a towel. "This part of the
  investigation deals entirely with the murder and Sir Adam's lost fortune. I
  don't mind confessing, Mr. Mowbray, that I think success in any one of the
  three problems we are tackling will practically solve the other two. That is
  why it seems to me a matter of the greatest urgency that we should devote all
  our efforts towards finding out what has become of Sir Adam. The other
  problems have to do with dead facts. There is just a chance that Sir Adam may
  be still alive."</p>

  <p>"Considering the poor start we made," Martin remarked, "I should say we
  were quite justified in working backwards. That is to say, hunting for the
  fortune and the story of the murder first, in the hope that it will lead us
  to Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>"That is the reply of a man with sound detective instincts," Snell
  admitted. "We may be driven to working entirely upon those lines. In fact,
  for the moment that is exactly what we are doing. Do you mind passing over
  that letter from Averil and Benz again?"</p>

  <p>Martin passed it over. The detective read it through carefully. Slowly
  that left eyelid was uplifted. His lips were pursed as though he wore about
  to whistle.</p>

  <p>"Notice the date?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Martin glanced at it and gave a little exclamation.</p>

  <p>"A year ago!"</p>

  <p>"Precisely."</p>

  <p>"What has happened to this man that he didn't present himself?"</p>

  <p>Snell glanced at the letter again.</p>

  <p>"This affair may be of no importance at all," he said, "or it may be a
  very great help. I would suggest that we ask Dyson whether he has any
  recollection of the man calling within the last year."</p>

  <p>Martin rang the bell and the porter made melancholy appearance.</p>

  <p>"Dyson," Martin said, "a year ago the people who made those safes down in
  the vaults wrote and said they were sending a man over to see Sir Adam, with
  a view apparently to his releasing his claim on the patent under which they
  were made. The name of the firm is Averil and Benz of Rhode Island. Now, do
  you remember an American gentleman calling?"</p>

  <p>Dyson was silent for a moment. The news seemed somehow or other to make
  him vaguely uneasy.</p>

  <p>"No American gentleman has called here in banking hours for the last
  twelve months, sir," he said firmly. "I'm quite sure of that."</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam has not shown the safes to any caller?"</p>

  <p>"He has never done such a thing in his life, sir."</p>

  <p>Martin waved the man away.</p>

  <p>"Now this, I should think, is the moment for us to send a cable," he
  proposed. "I see that the people have a cable address&mdash;Abenz New York.
  We'll start with that."</p>

  <p>"If we are to send another cable at all," Snell suggested, "I should let
  them know that the bank is not at present functioning but ask them what has
  become of their representative and say that we should be glad to discuss the
  matter referred to in their previous letter; and if you don't mind, I should
  particularly like Dyson to take that cable."</p>

  <p>The cable was written out. From his place in front of the window Snell
  watched Dyson with the cable in his satchel walking down the street.</p>

  <p>"Queer thing," he meditated half to himself, "but the people who saw most
  of Sir Adam all seem to have had a sneaking liking for him. There's Groome,
  who died from the shock; there's Dyson, who looks as though he had lost a
  stone in weight already and seems perfectly miserable; and there's the
  steward over at the club, Lawford, who speaks of the old gentleman as though
  he had been one of the most amiable people in the world."</p>

  <p>"Dyson is the man I cannot understand," Martin confided. "I never heard
  Sir Adam address a kindly word to him. He ordered him about as though he were
  a dog, yet the fellow behaves as though he had lost his greatest friend and
  benefactor."</p>

  <p>"He may be worrying about the difficulty of getting another post," Snell
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"It can't be that," Martin replied. "I have already given him a hint that
  he doesn't need to worry, that there will be something coming for him in the
  way of a pension from the estate."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there will be an estate?" Snell reflected.</p>

  <p>"Some of the money will turn up," Martin declared. "Then there are these
  bank premises, you know, and the furniture&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And those safes," Snell observed. "They must be worth something. Didn't I
  understand that you found some money to pay a cheque?"</p>

  <p>"The premises are worth more than I advanced," Martin replied quickly. "I
  only found a matter of five thousand pounds and property in Norchester to-day
  is fetching&mdash;well, very high prices indeed. While I think of it, Snell,
  here are the additional plans of the alterations to the club you asked for.
  Shall I have Dyson take them over to your rooms for you?"</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind I would rather keep them here, Mr. Mowbray."</p>

  <p>"That is to say you don't want to take them into the club?" the young man
  asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't want to hold them out in front of me and go from room to
  room," Snell admitted. "They would think I was off my head and they don't
  think much of me as it is. Lawford's attitude is almost sympathetic."</p>

  <p>"If the plans can suggest to you anything about Sir Adam's disappearance,"
  Martin said, "I should have thought you would have wanted to study them on
  the spot."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the other agreed. "Quite so. Yes. But I think I will be able to
  manage. If you have no objections, Mr. Mowbray, I should like you to order
  Dyson to come every morning at nine o'clock and have this place opened up for
  me. He can lock the doors afterwards. I should like to spend a little time
  here. If there is anything in the plans which suggests an idea to me I can
  make a rough draft in my pocketbook and pry about the club. Lawford is a very
  good fellow, civil all the time and that sort of thing, but I believe he
  feels at the back of his head that Sir Adam's disappearance is a reflection
  on the club. He seems to have developed a certain amount of curiosity, too,
  about my movements. It is odd how often I find him just at my elbow. If I
  were to take plans in and ask him to inspect the whole building from cellar
  to roof I don't think that he would like it. I really don't think, Mr.
  Mowbray, that he would like it."</p>

  <p>"You haven't got any ideas about Lawford, have you?" Martin asked.</p>

  <p>Snell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No ideas whatsoever," he declared. "The only thing is that when you are
  face to face with a blank wall of impossibilities you've got to go over that
  wall with your fingertips as though you were looking for a chip in the
  mortar. You have to use your imagination and it's one of the drawbacks of our
  profession, Mr. Mowbray, that it is rather cramping to the imagination. I am
  going to stay here now, if I may, for an hour or so and look over these
  plans."</p>

  <p>Martin glanced at his watch.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to be off directly," he announced. "Perhaps you wouldn't
  mind staying till Dyson comes back."</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"Does Lawford ever have a holiday?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He goes away for a fortnight in the summer and he can always have some
  time off if he wants it."</p>

  <p>"Fine-looking chap," Snell meditated.</p>

  <p>"A great cricketer," Martin assented, "if he had gone in for it seriously.
  He was quite up to County form. We played him twice, the season I was captain
  three years ago, and long before that he could have worked himself into a
  regular place in the eleven if he had tried. He was always afraid it would
  interfere with his work here, though. Sir Adam was one of those who was most
  down upon it."</p>

  <p>"I don't think Sir Adam was very keen upon people enjoying themselves. See
  you at luncheon-time, then, Mr. Mowbray."</p>

  <p>Martin took his leave. The detective moved into his place and rolled out
  the plans before him. To all appearance he was completely absorbed when the
  first knock at the door came. On the second occasion he looked up.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" he invited.</p>

  <p>Dyson presented himself cap in hand. He glanced round the room as though
  in search of Martin Mowbray.</p>

  <p>"Are there any instructions, do you know, sir," he asked Snell, "about
  keeping the bank open?"</p>

  <p>Snell pushed the plans a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"Sent the cable, Dyson?" he enquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the man replied.</p>

  <p>"How much was it?"</p>

  <p>Dyson stood quite still for a moment and there was a queer expression on
  his scared face.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't quite remember, sir."</p>

  <p>"Think," Snell enjoined. "You must have some idea."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir. Yes&mdash;it was somewhere around a sovereign."</p>

  <p>"Do you keep your petty cash like that?" Snell asked. "Somewhere about a
  sovereign! You don't know how much it was because you never sent it."</p>

  <p>The man was speechless.</p>

  <p>"Open your satchel. Give me the cable."</p>

  <p>Dyson obeyed with shaking fingers. He undid the strap and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I sent the cable, sir," he insisted. "It's my memory that's funny."</p>

  <p>"Give me your satchel. If you don't, I shall come and take it. Be careful,
  Dyson!"</p>

  <p>The latter seemed on the point of either collapse or some act of violence.
  He produced the cable and laid it on the blotting pad. He edged a step nearer
  and leaned forward just at the time that Snell's right hand shot across the
  table. Dyson stared at the short-nosed stubby weapon, his eyes lit with real
  terror.</p>

  <p>"You haven't a chance at that sort of game," the Inspector warned him
  quietly. "You see, I am an old hand. You would be a dead man before you got
  near any sort of weapon you may have. Besides," he went on, and his voice
  seemed to get softer and more persuasive, "can you tell me any reason why I
  should not march you round to the police station and have you charged for the
  murder of that person who was shot here the other night?"</p>

  <p>"You couldn't do that, sir," Dyson faltered. "I didn't shoot him."</p>

  <p>"Who did then?"</p>

  <p>The man was silent.</p>

  <p>"If you didn't shoot him who did?" Snell repeated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

  <p>Snell laid his gun on the table within easy reach. His eyes never left the
  straight, menacing figure in front of him.</p>

  <p>"Dyson," he continued, "would you like to tell me the truth? It might be
  better for you. I don't like to hear of innocent men being hanged, but it has
  happened before now. It may happen again. You don't seem to me like a killer.
  You may be one of a small conspiracy. I cannot tell. I am not one of those
  detectives," Snell went on, speaking very slowly, "who when they start out to
  discover who killed a man, and to bring him to the gallows, don't mind so
  much so long as someone swings for it. I am not like that, Dyson. I want to
  be sure that it is the right man who suffers. I am not so sure as I should
  like to be about you. That is why I am giving you this chance to tell me the
  truth."</p>

  <p>Dyson seemed to be struggling for words. There were drops of sweat upon
  his forehead. He stumbled towards the desk and leaned against it. Suddenly,
  as though by some prodigious effort, he sprang forward. He seemed to have
  become a wild creature. His right hand struck out madly at Snell, reached his
  collar, burst it asunder and tried to close upon his throat. His breath was
  coming fast, his face was the face of a maniac. Snell's fist worked like a
  piston-rod. He leaned over the table and struck his antagonist on the point
  of the chin. The man's collapse was almost instantaneous. His other hand
  struck the table. The stationery rack went in one direction and Snell's
  revolver and the architect's plans in another. Dyson himself fell backwards
  with a deep groan. Snell moved swiftly round the desk and looked down at him.
  Then he picked up his revolver, slipped it into his pocket, collected the
  plans and replaced the stationery rack upon the table. He loosened Dyson's
  collar, felt his pulse and heart and stood once more upright. Afterwards he
  glanced in the mirror, rearranged his own collar and torn tie, had one more
  look at the unconscious man and picked up the telephone, a temporary
  installation of which had been put in that morning.</p>

  <p>"Chief Constable's office at the Town Hall. As quickly as possible, if you
  please."</p>

  <p>In less than a minute Captain Elmhurst's voice came over the line.</p>

  <p>"Hello! Who's that?"</p>

  <p>"It's Snell," was the calm reply. "Can you hear me, Captain Elmhurst?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I hear."</p>

  <p>"Listen. Is there anyone in your room with you?"</p>

  <p>"Only my clerk."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm Snell and I'm in the bank parlour. This place is becoming
  rather like a frowzy chamber of horrors. I have had a little disagreement
  with a man here&mdash;Dyson, the bank porter."</p>

  <p>"The devil!"</p>

  <p>"I want you to send down the police surgeon. I don't think the fellow's
  badly hurt but I want to be sure. Perhaps you might come along, too, sir, if
  you will and I'll explain."</p>

  <p>"I'll do just as you say," was the quick reply. "Steward is on the
  premises now."</p>

  <p>"I shall expect to hear from you, then, in about quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"You will see us before then," Elmhurst promised.</p>

  <p>Snell hung up the receiver. He looked back at the disordered room and
  shook his head slowly. Then he set to work with meticulous care to restore
  the place to its former appearance. He picked up the cable which was lying on
  the desk and thrust it into his pocket. Then, after another glance at the
  unconscious man, he mopped up a few spots of ink that had been spilt and laid
  the plans upon a clean sheet of blotting paper in front of his chair. As soon
  as everything was in order, he sprinkled a little water upon the unconscious
  man's face, felt his pulse, strolled out into the hall, unlocked the door and
  pushed the gates a little wider open. He was back in his place studying the
  plans when the automobile stopped outside.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23"
     name="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

  <p class="first">CAPTAIN ELMHURST, followed by Dr. Steward carrying a
  professional black bag, hurried into the bank parlour. Snell rose to his feet
  and pointed to the figure upon the floor.</p>

  <p>"There has been a little trouble here, I am sorry to say," he explained in
  his usual sleepy tone. "Dyson is knocked out, I'm afraid. He will come to,
  with a little attention. His pulse is stronger now than it was."</p>

  <p>The doctor sank on his knee and leaned over his prospective patient.
  Captain Elmhurst, too, regarded him for a moment in astonishment. Then he
  turned to the Inspector.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me that Dyson is mixed up in this business?" he
  exclaimed. "Why, I always thought he was the only person old Sir Adam really
  trusted."</p>

  <p>"He's in it, up to a certain extent," Snell confided. "I tested him
  somewhat prematurely, perhaps, and he went for me. We were alone here and I
  had to knock him out."</p>

  <p>"Dyson!" Elmhurst repeated wonderingly. "Well, that's a queer business. He
  served his full time in the Army, has a row of medals, and he is one of the
  leading fights in the British Legion here. No possibility of any mistake,
  eh?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," Snell replied "Mr. Martin Mowbray and I arrived at a
  certain conclusion this morning in the course of our conversation and as soon
  as that happened we wrote out a cable and gave it to Dyson to take to the
  Post Office and despatch. He had been rather silent and awkward all the
  morning. When he came back I asked him a question as regards the cost of the
  cable and he was completely floored. He told me something ridiculous and I
  found that I had stumbled upon the truth. He had kept the cable back."</p>

  <p>The surgeon rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"An ordinary knock-out," he pronounced, "but the fellow isn't in the best
  of shape. He ought to lay up for a day or two. I should send for an ambulance
  and have him taken to the infirmary, if I were you."</p>

  <p>Snell made no immediate comment but he was obviously perturbed.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with that?" Elmhurst asked. "The poor fellow doesn't
  look as though he'd be good for anything for a day or so."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing the matter with it at all," was the thoughtful reply.
  "It is exactly what I should wish, under certain conditions."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Elmhurst interrupted a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>"I believe," Snell explained, "that this place is being watched at the
  present moment. The removal of Dyson on a stretcher in a police car would be
  a catastrophe. I should like it to remain for the present absolutely a secret
  that he is down and out. If it were possible I should like him sent in a
  non-official vehicle to the police hospital and kept strictly guarded there.
  Could the doctor help us, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>The doctor, who had no interest in crimes or mysteries of any sort and was
  utterly devoid of curiosity, opened his black bag and peered into its
  contents.</p>

  <p>"I can give him a stimulant," he proposed, "which will enable him to walk
  with a little assistance within the course of an hour. There are plenty of
  beds vacant in the police hospital and you can telephone from here to have
  one prepared. He had better have a nurse to sit with him for the rest of the
  day. He's had a shock and I take it that you don't want him to become in any
  way mentally deranged."</p>

  <p>"That," the detective admitted, "is the last thing we want&mdash;not until
  we have him in the frame of mind to answer one or two questions, anyway."</p>

  <p>The doctor prepared his draught, raised the man's head a little, held it
  in the crook of his arm and forced the mixture between his teeth. Then he
  placed a cushion under his head and stood up.</p>

  <p>"Best I can do," he announced. "You will remember, Captain Elmhurst," he
  went on, turning to the Chief Constable, "that I am wanted down at Wharf
  Street as soon in I can be spared. You don't want me to send a special nurse
  down, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you can avoid it, please," Snell begged.</p>

  <p>"There is no real necessity," the doctor declared. "No fear of his passing
  out or anything of that sort. His trouble, when he gets any, will be mental.
  By the by, are you sending word to his people?"</p>

  <p>"Leave that to me, please," the Inspector insisted. "It's a case for
  isolation, this. I don't want the man to come to any harm, of course, but I
  just want to put him where no one can get at him for a matter of forty-eight
  hours. I think by that time we may be seeing a gleam or two of daylight."</p>

  <p>"Don't frighten him, if you can help it," the doctor said indifferently.
  "You know something of the scientific side of it, I am sure," he added, with
  a glance at Snell's not too powerful-looking arm, "and you understand the
  psychology of a knock-out punch on the exact spot."</p>

  <p>"I've heard something about it in my gymnasium days," Snell admitted with
  a grin.</p>

  <p>The doctor took his leave. The two men looked down at Dyson. He was
  breathing regularly now and there was a healthier colour in his cheeks.
  Captain Elmhurst lit a cigarette, and following his example Snell began
  slowly to fill his pipe.</p>

  <p>"When you've been thinking hard about a difficult case, sir," the
  detective said, "the slightest gleam of light seems like a wide-open window.
  I can't tell you that my job is in any way finished, however, because, I'm
  sorry to say, the whereabouts of Sir Adam remains as great a mystery as ever.
  Leave it at that, will you, Captain Elmhurst? I look upon you in exactly the
  same way as I do upon my Chief at Scotland Yard and when I report progress to
  him to-night I'll send you a copy."</p>

  <p>"That's quite all right, Inspector," the other replied. "What can I do for
  you now? You'd like me to order a car, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to do a little more than that, if you will be so kind,"
  Snell begged. "It may seem foolish but it's just an idea. You know there's a
  back way out from the bank?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is. I have never seen it though."</p>

  <p>"It's there all right: just two high stone walls and a passage. Well, I
  want you, say in a quarter of an hour, to send two cars round here&mdash;an
  ordinary police car to wait outside the bank door and a taxicab to pull up at
  that stationer's shop a few doors down. The taxicab driver must be told to
  keep his flag down and wait for two gentlemen. The police car is to stop
  outside the bank and there should be five minutes' difference between the
  times of their arrival."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott, Inspector!" Captain Elmhurst exclaimed. "Are you trying to
  make a detective of me?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's quite simple, sir, isn't it?" Snell replied with a smile.
  "Later in the day I'll tell you if we have any luck."</p>

  <p>"I should think, after all," Elmhurst remarked as he put on his hat and
  took his leave, "there must be odd moments of interest about this profession
  of yours when you get fairly going."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Inspector Snell was a man of method. He believed also in making the best
  use of every second in times of crisis. With Dyson still unconscious and
  breathing stertorously within a few feet of him, he opened the door of Sir
  Adam's private lavatory and, spreading out a small leather case which he had
  drawn from his pocket, he smeared over a square of plate glass with some ink
  shaken from a small bottle, completing in a few moments some simple
  preparations for an enterprise which he had been contemplating for several
  days. Crossing the floor of the parlour once more, he went down on his knees
  by the unconscious man's side, raised his right hand and pressed the fingers
  carefully upon the ink-smeared plate. Afterwards he substituted a block of
  plain white paper for the glass, pressed the fingers once more firmly upon it
  and finally rose to his feet. He returned to the lavatory, placed the result
  of his labours in a drawer, reached for his hat, and, with a glance at Dyson,
  who was still either asleep or unconscious, he opened the door of the bank
  parlour, let himself out into the street, and crossing the pavement spoke to
  the uniformed driver of the police car which was waiting there.</p>

  <p>"Listen carefully," he enjoined. "Get away from here now as quickly as you
  can. Take the first turn to your right and the first to your right again.
  That will bring you to the back entrance of the bank. Wait there for a
  quarter of an hour. Then go back to where you came from. You will have
  finished your job. If anyone asks you any questions look at them carefully so
  that you can identify them afterwards, but make no reply. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, sir."</p>

  <p>"Good. The first turn to the right," Snell repeated, stretching out his
  arm, "round to the right again and wait for quarter of an hour."</p>

  <p>"Precisely, sir."</p>

  <p>The Inspector stepped back into the bank, closing the gate and the door
  behind him but not locking them, although he went through the pantomime of
  doing so. Then he returned to the bank parlour and stood a few feet in the
  background gazing intently out of the window. He watched the police car start
  up, crawl for a few yards and take its turn to the right. He leaned a little
  forward, his eyes sweeping the road and the pavement on the other side of the
  street. Suddenly a faint smile transformed his face. Exactly what he had
  hoped for was taking place. He turned around and approached Dyson, leaned
  down and shook his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Wake up, man!" he enjoined. "Here, let me give you a hand."</p>

  <p>Dyson opened his eyes, stared at the Inspector for a moment, and then with
  very little assistance staggered to his feet. Snell handed him his cap.</p>

  <p>"Pull yourself together," the latter continued firmly. "I'm going to take
  you home."</p>

  <p>"I can walk, sir," Dyson muttered a little thickly.</p>

  <p>"That's right," Snell declared encouragingly. "Now, come this way."</p>

  <p>They passed through the bank. On the doorstep Snell placed the key in his
  companion's hand.</p>

  <p>"Lock up," he ordered. "You can leave the gates."</p>

  <p>Dyson did as he was told&mdash;an absolutely mechanical turn of the wrist
  was all that was needed. On the pavement Snell waved his hand to the taxicab
  man, who promptly drove up. He pushed Dyson in and took the place by his
  side.</p>

  <p>"Turn round to the left at once," he directed. "Drive on until you come to
  High Street, then make your way from there to the police hospital. You
  understand? Get going."</p>

  <p>All the time, Dyson sat dazed and dumbly acquiescent. Snell relit his
  pipe. Presently they drove into the yard of the small infirmary. Two
  orderlies were waiting.</p>

  <p>"Take this patient up to the room that Captain Elmhurst has reserved," the
  Inspector instructed. "Tell the nurse he's to be taken care of and to
  rest."</p>

  <p>"Orders all given, sir," one of the men replied.</p>

  <p>Dyson alighted readily enough but as though he were still in a dream.
  Snell watched him disappear with his arms round the shoulders of the two
  orderlies. Then he permitted himself a faint chuckle of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Lunchtime," he soliloquised, glancing up at the clock. "County Club,
  chauffeur."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24"
     name="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

  <p class="first">ALMOST immediately after he had climbed the broad steps and
  passed through the swing doors into the vestibule of the club, Inspector
  Snell knew that something out of the ordinary was happening. There were twice
  as many hats as usual upon the pegs, and amongst the Homburgs and bowlers
  affected by most of the members were several silk hats of incredible
  glossiness. Martin Mowbray, in place of his habitual tweeds, was wearing a
  dark suit and a sombre tie. His uncle, with whom he was talking, was attired
  in the frock coat and stock of the Victorian epoch. Sir Theodore, too, was
  wearing clothes of a severer cut than is generally to be found in a county
  club. Martin broke off in his conversation with his uncle and hastened
  towards Snell.</p>

  <p>"No wonder you're looking a little bewildered, Snell," he remarked. "This
  is just what has happened: Sir Theodore had an interview with a very
  distinguished judge last night, and was given the decision of the board with
  regard to his application for having the Will read. The board naturally
  refused to presume Sir Adam's death, but under the circumstances they were
  willing to advise Sir Theodore to get the legatees together and read them the
  Will which is in our possession. There are a few legal stipulations and
  conditions which are really quite unimportant, but the reading of the Will is
  to take place at three o'clock this afternoon. The Earl and Countess of
  Pengwill are here; Lord and Lady Tidswell; Jack Tidswell, the elder grandson;
  Lady Diana&mdash;and I think that's all, except the two executors, myself and
  one of Sir Theodore's partners."</p>

  <p>"Well, I hope it may set their minds at rest, even if it doesn't help us,"
  Snell said thoughtfully. "I should like to see you afterwards sometime during
  the day, Mr. Mowbray."</p>

  <p>"I'll telephone as soon as this show is over," Martin promised. "That's
  Pengwill talking to my uncle," he pointed out. "He's all nerves. Terrified
  for fear the old man has either got an awful confession to make in his Will
  or has indulged in some ghastly gesture. Tidswell is almost as bad. Six or
  seven millions. It's a hell of a lot of money, of course, if it really
  exists."</p>

  <p>"If it really exists," Snell repeated.</p>

  <p>"My God, don't let any of them hear you suggest that it doesn't!" the
  young man implored. "I don't believe there's one of them would turn a hair if
  the poor old chap were discovered dead, but the very mention of the money
  being missing would send any one of the two families off into an ague. I
  don't know which are the worse&mdash;the Tidswells or the Pengwills. The only
  person who preserves her dignity through it all is Lady Diana. We all had a
  little talk at the office and she seemed to stagger everybody when she
  remarked quite calmly that she would rather know what had become of old Sir
  Adam than what had become of his millions.. .. I must be off now. We are
  going into the private room and I can see Uncle making a move."</p>

  <p>Snell watched the little crowd disappear, then he took his place in the
  luncheon room at the most retired table. There was a buzz of conversation
  everywhere. Once more, interest in this local tragedy seemed to have revived.
  There were a great many curious glances in his direction. The Chief Constable
  came in a little late and made at once for his table. He looked round the
  room before he took the place next to Snell and asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"All serene?" he ventured.</p>

  <p>"Everything went according to plan," Snell assured him. "We've made a
  move, sir. I can't quite tell where it's going to lead us but somewhere in
  the right direction, I hope."</p>

  <p>"You know they're all in the private room? Come down to gloat over the old
  man's millions."</p>

  <p>Snell nodded.</p>

  <p>"I saw Mr. Martin Mowbray in the hall as I was coming in. Seems a pity
  they couldn't have waited a little longer."</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst thoughtfully sipped the glass of sherry which had just
  been brought to him.</p>

  <p>"I'm not so sure," he reflected. "If I were one of them and heard about
  that row of empty lockers and the lawyers had to tell me that they didn't
  know where the stuff was, I should certainly vote for the Will being opened.
  There may be a list of his securities in there. In the old days, before the
  fashion for short Wills came in, that was always the case."</p>

  <p>Lawford, quite unruffled, looking in fact as though he rather enjoyed the
  extra bout of work, approached the table.</p>

  <p>"I hope that they are not keeping you waiting, Captain Elmhurst?" he asked
  anxiously. "And you, Mr. Snell? We have a large party in the private room
  to-day&mdash;very distinguished people. They are not lunching exactly, but
  they are ordering in refreshments of various sorts and they do not wish for
  anyone in the room except myself. Henry's a good lad, but he is a little
  slow, and I'm a waiter short, too. I sent my best man out on an errand and he
  hasn't returned yet. Have you given your order, Mr. Snell?"</p>

  <p>"Grilled sole," the detective confided. "I knew it would take a little
  extra time. Don't bother about me, Lawford. I'm in no hurry."</p>

  <p>"I have ordered the lamb and here it comes," his companion remarked.
  "Don't worry about me either, Lawford. We're doing very well."</p>

  <p>The steward took his leave with a little bow. Elmhurst watched him
  disappear with a glance of admiration.</p>

  <p>"I believe that man would sooner die than ask a question," he
  observed.</p>

  <p>Snell acquiesced thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He is a perfectly trained servant," he admitted. "I know of two things
  that he must have felt a little curious about. This meeting of Sir Adam's
  relatives, for one."</p>

  <p>"And the other?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I believe he would rather like to know what's become of the waiter
  he sent out on an errand."</p>

  <p>"The significance of the missing waiter eludes me," Elmhurst confessed,
  without any particular show of interest, "but I don't suppose there is a soul
  in this room who isn't curious about that Will they are reading. You're a
  stranger here, Snell, and you can't quite realise what the name of Blockton
  means in these parts."</p>

  <p>"It isn't my job," the detective observed, "to go in for too much
  speculation about things. Still, the disappearance of a well-known man who
  chooses to take his fortune away with him is always certain to provoke
  curiosity."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst smiled a little cynically.</p>

  <p>"I believe what those people are afraid of," he remarked, "is that he got
  rid of the fortune before he disappeared. If so I don't suppose they are
  likely to learn much from the Will. You got Dyson away from the bank, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks to you, sir," Snell replied. "I knew that the place was being
  watched but I wanted to prove it. When the police car drew tip outside the
  bank I went out and gave the driver careful orders and pointed to the turn
  which leads to the back entrance in Holles Street. He understood and off he
  went. The watcher strolled across the road and followed him. As soon as the
  coast was clear I got Dyson out, put him in the taxi and drove straight to
  the police infirmary where your people are taking charge of him."</p>

  <p>"And the watcher?" Elmhurst asked.</p>

  <p>"Johnson, the hall porter and waiter from here. The same young man,
  incidentally, who thought he saw a big car waiting outside the warehouse next
  door the morning Sir Adam disappeared. I made a few enquiries about that car
  myself and not a soul in the yarn agents' saw a sign of it."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst shook his head seriously.</p>

  <p>"You will never get anyone to believe, Snell," he said, "that any member
  of the club staff is mixed up in this. I don't believe it myself."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, sir," Snell replied. "In a case like this I just have to
  plod along and take note of the things I see. When we have strung them all
  together they may produce surprises."</p>

  <p>"You won't find Lawford figuring amongst them," the Chief Constable
  declared confidently.</p>

  <p>Snell sighed. The light flowing into the room through the tall windows
  scarcely reached him in his dark corner, yet he blinked for a moment and
  there was a distinct fall of his left eyelid. It was certainly hard to
  believe at such moments, his companion meditated, that he was a man of
  intelligence.</p>

  <p>"Well, I daresay not," he admitted thoughtfully. "Certainly he has not the
  appearance of a man likely to interfere in a dangerous business. A more
  contented-looking person I never saw."</p>

  <p>"He's a good fellow," Elmhurst agreed. "Might have been a fine cricketer,
  too, if he had stuck to it. Ever seen his wife?"</p>

  <p>Snell shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not once," he confessed. "I don't think she comes into the club."</p>

  <p>"She was in the old man's household when Lady Blockton was alive and they
  had to run some sort of an establishment. Parlourmaid, I think. She's damned
  good-looking, still."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful cook," his companion murmured. "If it was not for this
  indigestion which always troubles me so, I should like to order a little
  dinner for Fanshawe and myself when he returns. I have to have everything
  grilled, though," he reflected sadly.</p>

  <p>"Celebration dinner?" Elmhurst enquired.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, in a way," Snell acquiesced. "I don't think that this case
  will last very much longer. I feel, you know, I don't know why, I feel that
  we are getting near the end of it even though that end is hazy as yet, to say
  the least of it."</p>

  <p>"What's the low-down on this fellow Dyson?" the Chief Constable asked.</p>

  <p>"I hate setting out an unfinished job," Snell confided. "I have scarcely
  anything but circumstantial evidence about Dyson at present, I must admit,
  but I have succeeded in getting his fingerprints this morning and I am rather
  hoping for something from them."</p>

  <p>"You know how much that class of evidence is being mistrusted nowadays?"
  the Chief Constable reminded his companion.</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," Snell assented. "I would never take a case into Court upon
  circumstantial evidence alone. I value it chiefly because it is sometimes the
  finger-post to evidence of an altogether different character. I am not taking
  it for granted, for instance, that Lawford knows anything about what is going
  on because he sent one of his waiters out to watch the bank this morning. At
  the same time it helps me to look for something more definite."</p>

  <p>"Apart from the fact that to suspect Lawford of complicity in the affair
  is ridiculous," Elmhurst remarked, "there is no proof that the waiter didn't
  go out on his own or stay out after he had done an errand for Lawford."</p>

  <p>"You are probably quite right," Snell admitted gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I see he's back again on duty. You wouldn't like to ask him a question, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>Snell glanced at his companion reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"I have sometimes admitted to myself&mdash;pretty often, in fact," he
  confessed, "that I am a dud detective, but I do not think it would ever have
  occurred to me to ask that young man just now where he had spent the morning.
  I was once told," he went on, "by an angry client, that I should do better as
  a scarecrow in a turnip-field than at Scotland Yard. But a scarecrow, at any
  rate, even though it had a mangel-wurzel for a head, could never be accused
  of imbecility like that."</p>

  <p>"A bit touchy this morning, aren't you, my friend?" the Chief Constable
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have the feeling," Snell confided, "of a man who has slightly overshot
  his mark. I am waiting for three things this afternoon&mdash;a message from
  Mr. Martin Mowbray, a telegram from Southampton, and a summons from Dyson. If
  they should arrive, as I am inclined to expect them, and if they should
  contain the information, which is possible, then the disappearance of Adam
  Blockton and the murder of an unknown man in the bank vaults will no longer
  be mysteries."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst, who was still not sure that he believed in his companion, leaned
  back in his chair and lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Sounds as though you had been travelling," he remarked.</p>

  <p>A pageboy from the hall entered the room, looked around for a moment and
  made his way to Snell.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted on the telephone, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?"</p>

  <p>"I think he said he was a doctor, sir, speaking from some infirmary. I was
  to say that it was important."</p>

  <p>"I'm coming straight away," Snell replied.</p>

  <p>He followed the boy to the telephone box and took up the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Snell speaking."</p>

  <p>"Inspector, you know who I am&mdash;the doctor down at the prison
  infirmary."</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with your patient, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," the doctor replied, "he seems to have pulled himself
  together marvellously. The nurses left him for a few minutes and when they
  returned he was sitting completely dressed and waiting patiently. He asked
  for me. Fortunately I was down below and went to him at once."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," Snell murmured. "I don't suppose my hand is quite so
  heavy as it used to be."</p>

  <p>"The fellow's perfectly all right now, at any rate," the doctor reported.
  "I have examined him again and I cannot honestly say that there is the
  slightest thing wrong. He begs to be allowed to go back to the bank and
  resume his duties. He promises that if at the end of the day you are not
  satisfied he will be at your disposition but he would like to be there on
  duty at two o'clock as usual."</p>

  <p>Snell reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"What do you say, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest reason why he shouldn't return, so far as
  regards his condition," was the prompt reply. "He is quite able to carry on
  with his work. Of course, so far as regards his mentality, I should have to
  keep him under observation for days before I could say anything definite
  about that, but at present there are no signs whatever of anything wrong with
  the fellow."</p>

  <p>"Pack him off then," Snell decided.</p>

  <p>"That's understood, is it?" the doctor persisted. "I am to let him return
  to the bank?"</p>

  <p>"Understood."</p>

  <p>Snell resumed his seat and his luncheon.</p>

  <p>"It was the doctor about Dyson," he said. "He seems to have made a
  complete recovery. Got up and dressed himself and wants to go back on
  duty."</p>

  <p>"What did you decide?" Elmhurst asked.</p>

  <p>"To let him return if he wants to. He can't do any harm and there's just
  one thing more I want to say to him."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst nodded.</p>

  <p>"No good keeping him shut up if he's fit to be about," he remarked
  indifferently.</p>

  <p>Lawford, with his usual swift yet seemingly unhurried walk, approached the
  table. He leaned towards Snell.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Martin Mowbray would like to speak to you in the hall, sir," he
  announced. "He won't keep you a moment. He has just received a telephone
  message which he thinks you ought to know about. I told him you were lunching
  with Captain Elmhurst and he begged that the Captain should come out with
  you."</p>

  <p>Snell laid down his napkin and followed Elmhurst from the room.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Martin Mowbray was standing just outside the door of the private room. He
  came forward to meet them at once.</p>

  <p>"The message is really more for you, Elmhurst&mdash;the official part of
  it at any rate," he confided. "Someone from London has just
  arrived&mdash;came down in a plane, I think. He asked to be allowed to view
  the body in the mortuary. He announced himself as able to identify it."</p>

  <p>"Is he waiting there?" the Chief Constable asked.</p>

  <p>"He asked to see the Inspector of Police who was concerned with the case.
  I thought that you two would have about finished lunch&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lunch be hanged!" Elmhurst exclaimed. "I will take you in my car, Snell.
  You look pretty peaky, Martin. How are things going?"</p>

  <p>"You would look peaky if you had that crowd to deal with," the young man
  grunted.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to ask any improper questions but is there anything helpful
  to pass on? These millions&mdash;are they a myth?"</p>

  <p>"God knows!"</p>

  <p>The sound of an upraised voice from the room reached them&mdash;an angry,
  disappointed voice.</p>

  <p>"They are crucifying the old man," Martin confided. "I must go back to the
  rescue."</p>

  <p>He disappeared. Elmhurst led the way out to his car.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25"
     name="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

  <p class="first">A MIDDLE-AGED MAN who was seated in the armchair of Captain
  Elmhurst's private room in the Town Hall rose to his feet as the two men
  entered. He held out his card.</p>

  <p>"Averil is my name&mdash;Frederick J. Averil," he announced. "Firm of
  Averil and Benz. We are manufacturers of office safes under a patent of our
  own. We have a plant down at Providence, Rhode Island, and offices in New
  York. Office furniture we started with: now we have a number of side-lines. I
  got your wireless on the steamer and I have come down right away as you
  asked."</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst waved him back to his chair.</p>

  <p>"I am the Chief Constable here," he said. "This gentleman is Inspector
  Snell of Scotland Yard. It is he who is responsible for the communication you
  received. We understand that you are able to identify the man who is lying in
  the mortuary."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I can identify him all right although he has changed some," was the
  confident reply. "He was continental representative of our firm until about a
  year ago. We started him off for London last May to see some firms who were
  interested in our safes and from that day to this we have never heard a word
  from him although we wrote to the hotel he was to have stayed at, wrote to
  the firm whom we thought of making our agents, and even advertised in the
  papers. It is only just lately that we found out what became of him."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," Snell murmured.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you will think so when you have heard the whole story," Mr.
  Frederick J. Averil declared. "Say, I don't want to be a nuisance in any way,
  but I am one of those men who talk best if they are smoking something or
  other if it is only dry. D'ye mind?"</p>

  <p>He held out a cigar case.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Elmhurst acquiesced, shaking his head. "Sorry I have
  nothing of the sort to offer you here in the office."</p>

  <p>"That don't matter a couple of shakes," the visitor replied, biting off
  the end of a cigar which he had drawn from the case and lighting it. "Well
  now, about this fellow, Bradstone," he went on, blowing out a cloud of smoke.
  "It would be a long story to tell you, how we came to know all that we do
  know now. I'll just tell you the result and you can find out anything else
  you want to know through your own headquarters here. We always knew that this
  young man Bradstone was a sporty sort of chap, played poker when he was
  travelling and kept tabs on the ponies, but we guessed he was honest because
  we never found him anything else. We booked his passage on the
  <i>Homeric</i>that left New York May the twentieth last year, and as I told
  you before, from the date we saw him off and handed him our new catalogue and
  posted him up about things generally, we never heard a word from him and I
  never set eyes on him until they showed me the body out in your mortuary
  there. Gee, it was not a pleasant sight!"</p>

  <p>He smoked thoughtfully for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>"Well, a week or so ago we found out at last what had become of the chap,"
  he went on. "He fell in with a bad lot on board that ship, got gambling, owed
  more than he could pay, cheated in a poker game and stole a couple of
  thousand dollars from the Purser's office one night. He was handed over to
  the police at Southampton, charged, sentenced and judged without our hearing
  a word of it. He must have walked out of prison, Captain, about the day
  before he paid you chaps a visit down here."</p>

  <p>"And with what object, do you suppose," Snell asked quietly, "did he come
  straight down here?"</p>

  <p>"Why, they had given him a letter at the works from Blockton's Bank,
  asking for a representative to call, as the old gentleman who owned the bank
  was finding a little trouble with the safes. He came down right away but now
  I hear how he was found I can figure out what he was up to all right. He was
  the only man in this country except the old banker, Blockton, who could open
  those safes, and I reckon he was for making a haul. You evidently had a night
  watchman or someone whom he did not expect to come across and he got what was
  coming to him. And there's what I can piece together and probably the true
  story of George Bradstone, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Snell speculated, "whether he did rob the vaults?"</p>

  <p>"Well, if that's what he was after it's a sure thing that he didn't get
  away with it," the safe manufacturer pointed out. "I saw the oddments that
  were found on his person&mdash;a bunch of skeleton keys and a key which would
  have opened your safes same as the one you have got, I reckon."</p>

  <p>"This identification," Snell confided softly, "is most interesting to us,
  Mr. Averil. We very much appreciate your coming down on this matter. Now,
  since you are here, can you spare us just a little more of your time?"</p>

  <p>"The rest of the day, if you like," Mr. Averil agreed. "No more. I must be
  back in London at nine o'clock to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the office door. A constable entered and conferred
  with his Chief for a moment. Elmhurst rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me for a moment," the latter said, turning to the transatlantic
  visitor. "Snell, tell our friend exactly what the position is. We have
  nothing to hide. He may have a suggestion to make. I shall be back in two or
  three minutes," he added as he left the room.</p>

  <p>"Jumpy sort of person, your local Chief," Averil remarked. "What's
  happened to him now?"</p>

  <p>"I should think, from what I overheard," Snell replied, "that he is
  telephoning to the lawyers. You see, we are all passing through rather a
  critical time down here."</p>

  <p>Mr. Averil grinned.</p>

  <p>"I was reading in one of the papers coming along that there had been queer
  happenings."</p>

  <p>"That's why I am here, of course," Snell explained. "Not only has Sir Adam
  Blockton, who was the head of the bank, suddenly disappeared and been missing
  now for over a week, but every one of those strange-looking safes which your
  firm appears to have put in for him, and which were supposed to contain the
  whole funds of the bank and Sir Adam's fortune&mdash;well, now we have opened
  them they are empty! We have had to call a meeting of all the
  relatives&mdash;the meeting is still going on, I believe&mdash;and you can
  imagine there is plenty of trouble about."</p>

  <p>Mr. Averil was a person of direct speech.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm damned!" he exclaimed incredulously. "Empty, are they, those
  safes? Well, I should wonder!"</p>

  <p>"They're absolutely empty," Snell repeated. "On the other hand there are
  evidences in the vaults of a number of parcels having been made during the
  last few months in which, presumably, bonds and the paper assets of the bank
  have been taken away. We discovered this after we found that the locker safes
  were every one of them stripped bare. Now, in rummaging about amongst the
  papers, and I have had a free hand for some time, I came across the receipt
  for the cheque for fitting these lockers. The cheque came to something like
  sixteen thousand, five hundred pounds. Isn't that an enormous sum, Mr.
  Averil?"</p>

  <p>The latter's eyes twinkled. He held his cigar between his fingers, his
  mouth was slightly opened, his expression was one of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say you don't know all about those safes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We none of us know anything about them except that they were a special
  principle of locker safes&mdash;burglar-proof, fire-proof, made on a patent
  of which there is no explanation."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you the explanation all right," Mr. Averil promised. "Take me
  along to the bank with you."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do that for the moment," Snell objected. "You see, Scotland Yard
  is not so far interested in the disappearance or theft of those bonds. It is
  the murder of that young man and the disappearance of Sir Adam we are
  concerned in. The disappearance of the money might be a personal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Personal nix!" Mr. Averil scoffed. "You wait till I show you
  something."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but we must have the lawyers there, too," Snell said patiently.
  "That side of the matter belongs to them. Captain Elmhurst is telephoning
  them now, I know. Then we shall only be too glad to take you to the bank and
  have you show us anything there is to be shown."</p>

  <p>Captain Elmhurst made his reappearance. He entered the room with a smile
  upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"The meeting at the club, Snell," he announced, "seems to be in disorder.
  Martin Mowbray is on his way round. He will be here directly."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Averil here," Snell said, "thinks he may be able to point out to
  us something connected with the safes which will be helpful."</p>

  <p>"My car is waiting," Elmhurst declared, taking down his hat from the peg.
  "We will meet Mowbray outside and get along."</p>

  <p>The three men had barely reached the pavement before Martin drove up.</p>

  <p>"This is Mr. Averil from Providence, Rhode Island," Elmhurst introduced,
  as Martin descended. "He is the manufacturer of the safes. We are all going
  round to the bank to have a look at them."</p>

  <p>It was still within office hours when they drew up outside the
  deserted-looking building. Dyson, back again on duty, tall and unbending as
  usual, opened the swing doors as the three men arrived and saluted
  respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Recovered, Dyson?" Snell asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite, sir," the man replied. "I must offer my apologies for what
  happened before luncheon."</p>

  <p>"That's all right."</p>

  <p>They all passed through into the hall. The young man behind the counter
  looked up from his imaginary task with a flicker of interest. Elmhurst led
  the way through into the bank parlour, which Dyson opened for them.</p>

  <p>"Unbolt the trap door, too, Dyson," the Chief Constable ordered. "We are
  going into the vaults."</p>

  <p>Dyson stood motionless. He had the air for a moment of one who is either
  stricken with sudden deafness or who is about to refuse. He looked from
  Elmhurst to Snell. They were both regarding him fixedly. He hesitated no
  longer and did as he was bidden. Elmhurst felt for the switch and pressed it
  down. The place was illuminated with a thin, ghostly light. Martin, with the
  master key, unlocked four or five of the safes and swung the doors open. They
  were empty. Averil stood with his hands in his pockets whistling softly to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"That will do," he said at last. "You say they are all empty. I'll take
  your word for it. Close the doors again, please."</p>

  <p>Martin did as he was requested. He was feeling a little irritated. The
  American, who was watching all the time, had developed a curious expression
  which even Elmhurst, a man of more equable disposition, felt to be annoying.
  Snell, in the background, looked on and said nothing.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Martin remarked, "even your marvellous patent, Mr. Averil,
  does not stop a man from robbing himself if he wants to."</p>

  <p>"Not a hope," Averil admitted, lighting a fresh cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's what it seems to us has happened," Martin continued, "and
  although we are able to show you the safes I don't see how you or anyone else
  can help. I have gone into the practical side of it and it would be perfectly
  easy to stow away six or eight or even twenty millions' worth of securities
  in those lockers. It is also equally easy to wrap them up in parcels and move
  them somewhere else when you have a secret entrance here from the bank
  parlour and a secret exit up into Sir Adam's house. What is this wonderful
  patent connected with your safes, Mr. Averil? Have they learnt the trick of
  returning stolen goods to their rightful possessors?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite that," Averil replied. "Look here, gentlemen, both of
  you&mdash;Inspector Snell there in the corner, too. You are all facing
  something that seems pretty tragic to you. With me it is a matter of pounds,
  shillings and pence. You saw the receipt. You know what was paid to me for
  installing those safes."</p>

  <p>"We do," Martin assented.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it as a charge&mdash;best steel, fine mechanism, all
  that sort of thing, a marvellous key system, but not so very many of the
  safes&mdash;sixteen thousand, five hundred pounds?"</p>

  <p>Martin was sufficiently irritated to find pleasure in his reply.</p>

  <p>"I think it is damned robbery!"</p>

  <p>"So it would be," Mr. Averil acknowledged unruffled; "but then, you see,
  over ten thousand of that was what we charged for the patent."</p>

  <p>"Show us what patent there is about those things beyond their very
  ingenious lock," Martin challenged.</p>

  <p>"I guess not," was the cool reply. "I have not made the little bit of
  money I have made in life going around giving my secrets away to other
  people. I'll tell you what I'll do. If you and Captain Elmhurst and that
  other gentleman in the corner will go upstairs into the bank parlour and if
  you will let down the trap door and give me your word not to appear again
  until I summon you, I will let you see exactly what my patent is."</p>

  <p>Elmhurst was suddenly interested.</p>

  <p>"We agree, Mr. Averil," he said. "How long are you going to keep us?"</p>

  <p>"Ten minutes, if all goes well. Ten minutes, anyway. I'll holler for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Come and knock at the bottom of the trap door," Martin Mowbray
  suggested.</p>

  <p>Inspector Snell coughed wearily. The atmosphere of the place was certainly
  a little heavy.</p>

  <p>"Would there be any objection," he asked, "if one of us mounted that other
  little flight of stairs you see and sat in the room to which it leads?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Averil grinned.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Buckett!" he jeered. "I congratulate you, sir. A marvellous eye
  for the obvious. Get up there at once. I will knock at both trap doors. I'm
  ready. Hurry up, please. I want to begin my little job."</p>

  <p>They were delayed for a few minutes whilst Martin produced the keys of the
  door opening into Sir Adam's apartment from the ordinary Milner safe which
  stood in the office and handed them over to Snell. Mr. Averil, standing with
  his hands behind him, watched the detective climb the stairs and disappear.
  He watched the departure of the other two into the bank parlour. Then,
  satisfied that he was alone and unobserved, he approached the row of
  safes.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>"What's this chap up to?" Martin asked his companion as the trap door fell
  into its place behind them.</p>

  <p>"God knows!" Elmhurst replied, filling his pipe with thin nervous fingers.
  "I hate those damned cellars more than any place I have ever been into on
  earth," he went on savagely. "I'm not an imaginative person but I always feel
  that they are haunted by some devil or other."</p>

  <p>Martin lit a cigarette, pushed his hand further back in to the recesses of
  the safe and drew out a small revolver. He looked into the breech and slipped
  it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You've got a touch of nerves, Elmhurst," he remarked. "So have I. Worse
  than you, I think. For the last hour or so I have heard nothing but five or
  six greedy people jabbering and cursing about these lost millions in at the
  club. Down there, in that filthy place below, there is that row of empty
  lockers&mdash;the lost millions again. The place stinks like hell, too. It is
  enough, really, to send a man of ordinary mental balance a little off his
  head. Even Snell looks half-doped. There's a missing man, six millions gone
  astray, and a dead man,&mdash;all connected somehow or other with that
  cellar,&mdash;and it seems to me that since we have started looking for the
  first two and trying to understand the third, we ourselves have all gone a
  trifle groggy."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Martin," his friend grunted. "You and I are like that,
  anyway. I'm not so sure about Snell, though. I think the fellow is a clever
  actor. He always looks most bored when he believes he is on the point of
  finding something out."</p>

  <p>"What the devil has he found out up till now?" Martin demanded.</p>

  <p>"I believe," Elmhurst confided, knocking the ash from his pipe, "that
  Snell has something up his sleeve at the present moment. Haven't you noticed
  that pudgy eyelid of his has crept upwards? He was looking almost intelligent
  a few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"What's this American chap going to show us, do you think?" Martin
  groaned. "Old Sir Adam's corpse, I shouldn't wonder, standing up like a mummy
  in one of those tin canisters. Oh, damn it all, let's talk common sense!" he
  broke off.</p>

  <p>Elmhurst rose suddenly to his feet. He held his pipe away from his mouth
  and leaned forward listening.</p>

  <p>"What in God's name is that row?"</p>

  <p>They leaned over the trap door. From down below came the sound of a slow,
  thunderous knocking, something that seemed like the beat of a machine or the
  ticking of an enormous clock. A moment later came a rap at the trap door.
  Martin was the first to throw it open and descend, Elmhurst close behind him.
  Averil was on his way to the other side of the vault. He climbed up the
  flight of stairs leading to the bank house and knocked. A second or two later
  Snell appeared and paused, rooted on the third step, watching the opposite
  wall. Calm and triumphant, Mr. Averil stood with his hands in his pockets and
  his cigar at an acute angle between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Fifty thousand bucks my old dad got for this patent," he declared, "and
  it was worth it. Do you see what's happening, you guys?"</p>

  <p>They all gazed at the grey coffin-shaped receptacles, which were slowly
  revolving inch by inch in the spaces where the apparently solid safes had
  been. All the time that steady beating of machinery was sounding from
  somewhere close at hand, a level methodical beating of metal against metal
  driven by some unseen force.</p>

  <p>"They built the first of these," Mr. Averil confided with a wave of the
  hand towards what was happening, "in a great hangar on a deserted flying
  ground out West. I was a boy and I went to see it. It worked, then, all
  right, but I never believed anyone could make any practical use of it. You
  see what's happening. We are three-quarters through with it now. There's a
  gigantic spring I wound up in a spot you would never guess at and every one
  of those safes is revolving. In less than three minutes you will hear a click
  and they will be back in their places again, only it will be the other side
  of them you will see. They are double-fronted, of course. There will be a
  keyhole for you to try in a minute, Mr. Mowbray. The same key. Take my
  advice, start at the other end this time. Open one of those safes as soon as
  you hear the click and they are in order. For the love of Mike don't put your
  hand in the space until you hear the click!"</p>

  <p>Snell was watching, still in the background&mdash;a dumb, absorbed figure.
  Elmhurst was seated on a wooden case holding his head between his hands but
  furiously intent.</p>

  <p>"You will hear the click in a few seconds now," the manufacturer told
  them. "Gosh, that's wonderful! They're all coming into alignment as level as
  a die. Watch! Watch, I tell you. Say, this is some miracle!"</p>

  <p>The beating of the hidden machinery, without the slightest warning,
  ceased. Simultaneously there was a queer metallic click like the fusing into
  their places of steel joints. Then silence. There were seventeen fronts to
  seventeen safes all looking exactly as they had done half an hour before,
  except that the metal round the keyholes, which were now exposed, was
  tarnished.</p>

  <p>"Now, open one of them," Averil challenged.</p>

  <p>Martin Mowbray's fingers were obviously trembling as he inserted the key
  into the lock of the safe opposite to him, the one farthest from the bank
  parlour. The door opened as smoothly as though its hinges had just been
  bathed in oil. Martin's head and hands disappeared for a moment in the safe.
  A few seconds later he turned round with a great bundle in his hands. There
  was an electric light shining just above his head and he held them out.</p>

  <p>"Thousand-pound notes!" he cried hysterically. "More than I could carry
  away!"</p>

  <p>There was a sound like the sharp report of a rifle. Notwithstanding the
  tension of the moment, they all turned their heads. The trap door of the bank
  parlour had been raised and let fall. They watched the descending figure,
  watched with amazement that held them all for a second or two spellbound. It
  was Dyson who was standing there in the circle of light made by one of the
  overhead lamps&mdash;Dyson in his long brown coat and official hat, with a
  row of medals from one side of his chest to the other. In the centre of that
  little pool of illumination he stood drawn to his full height, a crestfallen,
  haggard creature no longer, a vigorous, alert man for those few moments. His
  voice had its old military bark.</p>

  <p>"Drop those notes!" he shouted. "Up with your hands! I'm going to shoot
  the lot of you! Thieves! That's what you are&mdash;thieves!
  Burglars&mdash;prying robbers! Out you go!"</p>

  <p>No one moved. Very slowly they saw Dyson's arm creep upwards. Very slowly,
  too, they saw Snell's figure from the dark recesses of the vault creeping
  along by the side of the wall. The threatening hand was raised almost to the
  horizontal. Martin felt a curious inability to move even a limb. He still
  hugged the bank notes. He still stared. All the time he was thinking of two
  things&mdash;Dyson was mad and Dyson was the finest revolver shot amongst
  non-commissioned officers in the British Army. In a few seconds&mdash;damn
  it, why couldn't he move? . . . And Snell, what was Snell up to? He was
  creeping nearer and nearer. If Dyson saw him he was a dead man. . . .</p>

  <p>The cry of a human being in agony rang through the place. Snell had timed
  his leap to an inch. His knees were in Dyson's back, his fingers were round
  his throat. Dyson showed signs of collapse but Snell's grip never
  slackened.</p>

  <p>"Come and help me tie him up!" he called out. "This man has fooled us once
  to-day. He has the strength of the devil. If he once gets away&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Dyson never got away.</p>

  <p class="first">MARTIN MOWBRAY, a little wild, more than a little
  dishevelled, staggered rather than walked into the hotel sitting room to
  which Diana's menage had summoned him later that evening. She looked at him
  in amazement.</p>

  <p>"Whatever has been happening to you?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"What nearly happened," he replied as she led him to a chair, "was sudden
  death. I used to think that life in a country town was inclined to be dull. I
  have changed my mind forever."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she insisted. "Quick! Or do you want a drink first? I
  have been amusing myself mixing these things while I waited for you."</p>

  <p>She shook him a cocktail and poured it out. He drank it greedily.</p>

  <p>"No man," he admitted with a faint smile, "should feel all knocked to
  pieces through having escaped sudden death but I confess that when I received
  your message not so long ago I was shivering all over."</p>

  <p>"Have another?" she invited. "And what on earth do you mean by sudden
  death?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not for the moment, thanks. I am a different man already. But honestly,
  Diana, I have just escaped death by the merest fluke, thanks to that crawling
  little bounder in the ginger suit&mdash;Snell. He saved my life. He saved the
  lives of all of us. The man's nerve was magnificent."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Mowbray&mdash;Martin!" she exclaimed. "What are you talking
  about?"</p>

  <p>"It is the truth," he assured her. "The long and short of it is that Dyson
  went stark, raving mad with a loaded revolver in his hand, just as we had
  solved one of these ghastly mysteries. Even after Snell had half-throttled
  him it took five of us to hold him and get him away to the asylum."</p>

  <p>"Where were you?" she cried. "What brought it on?"</p>

  <p>"We were in the bank cellars," he told her, "and what brought it on was
  just this: He got the idea that we were there to rob Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>She laughed a little hardly.</p>

  <p>"Rob Sir Adam! Of what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, some five or six or seven millions&mdash;whatever it may be."</p>

  <p>"But is there going to be any money?" she asked gloomily. "You know I
  really am beginning to wonder whether those are not phantom millions."</p>

  <p>"Not on your life," was the confident reply. "I have been wondering that
  myself at odd times&mdash;not now. I have seen some of it. The money is all
  right. We have found it. Some of it passed through my hands only an hour or
  so ago."</p>

  <p>"Martin!" she cried. "You don't mean it?"</p>

  <p>"But I do," he assured her. "We have carted a few sacks of it up to the
  offices already. I was busy stowing away thousand-pound Bank of England notes
  when your telephone message came. Jove, I shall never forget it! Dyson,
  although he was still bound hands and feet, was yelling like a madman and my
  fingers were trembling so that I could scarcely grip the receiver."</p>

  <p>She stared at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"You're not serious, Martin! It can't be true!"</p>

  <p>"It is absolutely true," he insisted. "Of course, it sounds like a fairy
  tale, but it isn't. We have had Averil, the manufacturer of those locker
  safes, down at the bank. He is not giving the patent away, of course, but
  when we showed him those empty lockers and talked about the disappearance of
  Sir Adam's huge fortune, he nearly had a fit. He made us go up into the bank
  parlour and stayed by himself down in the vaults. Presently we heard a
  rumbling down below which seems to have come from some enormous piece of
  clockwork machinery. All those lockers were double-fronted, and when he wound
  up the machinery with a key they turned completely round! When the machinery
  had stopped and they were all in place and we opened one of the lockers on
  the reverse side, we found it chock full of bonds and notes! We have ten
  policemen guarding the vaults at the present moment. We have not finished
  going through the new line of safes yet but I myself have counted two million
  pounds' worth of War Loan and there is another heap of it, so if the old man
  has sent some away there is still plenty left. Then there are huge rolls of
  thousand-pound notes and there are bearer bonds with cumulative interest from
  nearly every country in the world. The long and short of it is, Diana, the
  money is found!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you a marvellous person, Mr. Martin Mowbray?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to do with me," he answered. "It was the little man in the ginger
  suit who got on the track of the safe maker and brought him down."</p>

  <p>"And Sir Adam?" she asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Not a sign of him," Martin confessed. "The murder mystery is pretty well
  solved. The money is found. Of Sir Adam we have no single trace."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," she murmured. "Now, tell me about Dyson, please."</p>

  <p>Martin drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"That is the real tragedy of the whole show, so far," he acknowledged.
  "Dyson came down into the vault just after we had found the money and he went
  clean off his nut. He had put on his official coat, which is always hanging
  up in the bank, with all his medals, and he strode down into the place
  looking like a fiend. Clean off his nut&mdash;a tearing, raging madman! He
  had a gun in his hand and I thought we were all done for. I don't suppose you
  have ever heard it, but Dyson was supposed to be the finest revolver shot
  amongst non-commissioned officers in the Army. It is my belief that Snell
  saved the lives of every one of us."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she begged. "Go on, please."</p>

  <p>"There's not much more to tell. We were all in a little group in the vault
  staring at the safes, when Dyson came down the stairs, except Snell, who had
  only just descended the flight from Sir Adam's apartment. He tumbled to it
  like a flash as soon as he saw Dyson. He crept along the wall in the shadows
  and got behind him. Then, just as that gun was going up&mdash;and I tell you
  Dyson's arm was like a ramrod of steel&mdash;not a quiver&mdash;Snell crept
  up behind and played a Chinese garrotter's trick on him. He literally sprang
  onto his back, got his knees forward and his arms around his throat. The
  fellow was utterly helpless. He struggled, of course, and for a few seconds
  he seemed to have the strength of a dozen men. It wasn't any good. Snell's
  fingers never budged from his throat. He dropped the revolver and of course
  we all came into it then."</p>

  <p>"Horrible!" Diana murmured shivering. "Somehow or other&mdash;I suppose it
  has all been pretty terrible, but this seems to be the first moment that
  anything like real tragedy has blazed up, the first moment since I looked
  down into the vault and saw that dead man."</p>

  <p>"That's pretty well accounted for now," Martin explained. "Averil
  identified him on the spot. He had been with the firm and they sent him over
  to England to see Sir Adam&mdash;something about buying back the patent, or
  else Sir Adam had written complaining about the mechanism of the safes.
  Anyway, as we both know, he got into trouble on the steamer, was sent to
  prison, Snell traced him out, sent a wireless to Averil, who was on his way
  over, and the whole thing is pretty clear now. He came down here to rob the
  safes. He had the master key and he knew how to set the machinery working.
  Someone must have heard him down in the vault. The only question is&mdash;who
  shot him?"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and a pageboy from the hotel entered.</p>

  <p>"You are wanted on the telephone, Mr. Mowbray," he announced. "I have put
  you through onto the landing outside."</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me?" Martin asked, rising to his feet.</p>

  <p>She nodded assent.</p>

  <p>"Hurry."</p>

  <p>Martin spent a few minutes outside. Diana smoothed her hair before the
  glass. Presently he returned.</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is anything more than matters of detail," he reported,
  "but they want me back again before they close up. I think I had better hurry
  away, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"How long shall you be?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Less than an hour," he promised. "I'll just see what they want, have a
  few words with Snell, go to the office and change and be back here at eight
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"And I," she said, "will be really domestic. I will order dinner for
  you."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27"
     name="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

  <p class="first">MARTIN was rather better than his word. In three quarters of
  an hour he was back in the hotel sitting room. Diana led him to the sofa.</p>

  <p>"Nothing fresh," he reported. "I want you to tell me now what happened
  after I was obliged to leave the meeting."</p>

  <p>"Heaps," she assured him. "I have had a few thrills on my own account. I
  can scarcely describe that half-hour after your uncle had read the Will."</p>

  <p>"Nothing very pleasant, I gather," he remarked with a smile. "My dear old
  uncle began to tell me but he was simply dithering. I couldn't make head or
  tail of it all."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"I seem to spend half my life waiting on you already," she smiled. "Now
  you can go and shake the cocktails, bring over that box of cigarettes and I
  will do some talking."</p>

  <p>He obeyed readily. Diana leaned back in her place, sipped her cocktail and
  began.</p>

  <p>"Well, to begin with," she said, "I never saw such venom on the faces of
  ordinary human beings in all my life. My aunt, who had been calling me her
  pet and her favourite niece earlier in the day, really looked as though she
  were going to drag out one of those hideous pins from her drooping Victorian
  hat and stab me! As for my uncle, who kisses my hand like a courtier every
  night before he allows me to go to bed, he slammed the table right in front
  of my face and declared that the whole affair was damnable!"</p>

  <p>"Nasty-tempered fellow, Tidswell can be," Martin observed.</p>

  <p>"When your uncle, a few minutes later," Diana continued, "read out the
  clause that if anyone disputed the Will on any grounds whatsoever their share
  of their inheritance should be forfeited, I really thought that my father was
  going to have a fit. I was simply chased out of the place, you know, Martin.
  I couldn't go home. I couldn't dream of going to Wrotton Park. I came here,
  took a suite of rooms for the night and telephoned to you to come and protect
  me."</p>

  <p>"You couldn't have done a saner or more wonderful thing," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Well, you are my solicitor, you know," she reminded him. "You stood up in
  Court and defended me only the other day."</p>

  <p>"I have a strong feeling," he assured her, "that Providence meant me to
  be&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Your guardian."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"Remember," he warned her, "you made me drink this second cocktail! If I
  say anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" she insisted. "If you are going to say nice things to me and then
  try to get out of them afterwards because you were doped with alcohol I will
  not listen to another word. You must sit up and listen to my troubles. Of
  course, I suppose it's hard on all of them," she went on, as he refilled her
  glass, "but it has nothing to do with me. You know the contents of the Will,
  I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know them," he acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"Three millions for me," Diana continued. "Poor little Diana! The rest of
  the estate your uncle seems to think will work out at about three million
  pounds. That is to be divided into twelve shares. Aunt Anna gets five of
  them&mdash;surely that isn't so bad?&mdash;and Mother is to get five. The
  rest is to pay death duties and a few legacies, but you know all about
  them."</p>

  <p>Martin nodded.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Dyson was to get a thousand," he remarked, "and all the club
  servants are remembered&mdash;especially Lawford. He gets five thousand, I
  think."</p>

  <p>"Well, never mind about that just now," Diana insisted. "Listen, I want to
  ask you something."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead."</p>

  <p>"The day I lunched with you, when you wouldn't kiss me&mdash;did you know
  that I had been left all this money?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew," he told her.</p>

  <p>"Is that why you wouldn't kiss me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it was," he answered. "Very good reason, too, I should think.
  Now I will ask you a question, young lady. Did you know of that clause in the
  Will in which Sir Adam decreed that if it could be proved that any one of his
  relatives at any time had approached him for a loan or an advance on their
  allowance, any sum of money bequeathed to them was to be withdrawn and go
  back to the estate?"</p>

  <p>"Wasn't I a cat?" she murmured penitently. "I did know it, Martin."</p>

  <p>"How?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Grandfather himself told me," she confided.</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ages ago. It was before he gave up Lowesby Hall and we were all over
  there one day."</p>

  <p>"How did it come about?"</p>

  <p>"I wanted something, it was only a trifle, something to do with a tennis
  set, I think. I didn't want to play any longer with one of my cousins because
  he was teasing me, but I began by saying: 'I want to ask you a favour,
  Grandad.' He stopped me right away and curiously enough I have never
  forgotten his words. 'Diana,' he said, 'don't go on. I hate to be asked a
  favour. I shall put it in my Will that if anyone ever asks a favour of me and
  it becomes known that they have done so&mdash;either of money or anything
  else&mdash;then they are not to receive a single penny.'"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that like the old boy?" Martin muttered.</p>

  <p>"Well, I shall never forget it," she went on. "He wrinkled up his little
  face and looked at me like a monkey. Then I told him it had nothing to do
  with money and he was all right again."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't quite see&mdash;" Martin began.</p>

  <p>"It's simple enough," she explained. "I opened that letter of Mother's to
  him&mdash;you all agreed that I might do that&mdash;and I found out that she
  was asking him to advance her allowance and lend Father five thousand pounds.
  I promptly tore it up. Seems to me I saved the family about a million. Was it
  a crime, Martin?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"You did what any sensible girl in the world would have done," he assured
  her. "All the same, I'm jolly glad to know the truth about that letter,
  Diana. It has worried me more than once."</p>

  <p>"And now, to come back to ourselves," she said. "Are you never going to
  kiss me as long as you live because I possess or may possess three million
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>He came a little nearer to her. She decided that he had the most
  attractive smile and the most delightfully honest grey eyes she had ever
  seen.</p>

  <p>"Diana," he said, "those things have to count, you know. Your three
  millions are going to make you one of the richest young women in England. I
  ought to consider myself lucky, I suppose, because I am able to make six or
  seven thousand a year&mdash;and I did kiss you, after all, you remember."</p>

  <p>"But you won't go on kissing me?" she asked, moving a little closer to
  him.</p>

  <p>He leaned down.</p>

  <p>"There's just one way out of it, Diana," he whispered. "You could kiss
  me."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Some time later, when Diana had rearranged her hair before the mirror of
  the hotel sitting room and they were once more seated side by side upon the
  sofa, they became reasonable again.</p>

  <p>"So you are really in the position of the young woman who ran away from
  home," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear Martin," she said, "what would you have done? Everyone in
  that wretched room at the club was loathing me, except, of course, your uncle
  and Sir Theodore. Aunt Tidswell was shockingly rude to me, Mother wasn't
  speaking to me and at last I could not stand it any longer. Dear old Theodore
  stays here and he brought me down with him just while I made up my mind what
  to do. He will be in himself, presently, I expect."</p>

  <p>"If we were only living in that super-civilized country, America!" he
  sighed. "I might ring up a Justice of the Peace, marry you while they are
  getting dinner ready, and drag you away from those unsympathetic and
  exceedingly ill-tempered relatives."</p>

  <p>"We can have dinner, at any rate," she laughed. "I shall telephone to
  Wrotton Park&mdash;my maid is there&mdash;and have her bring my clothes. I
  won't go back again. I won't go near the house. As for Mother and Father,
  they can do what they like. I expect they will decide that in view of those
  three millions I had better be forgiven!"</p>

  <p>"I am all for your staying here," he declared enthusiastically. "And look
  here, Diana, don't you go counting on those three millions too soon. You may
  find that you will have to start life with a poor country solicitor, after
  all. I don't feel at all certain in my mind that Sir Adam is dead."</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you something?" she asked, taking his hand in hers.</p>

  <p>"Tell me anything you like."</p>

  <p>"I don't really very much care. I have always wondered what these little
  efforts of love-making would be like and they are much more delightful than I
  ever dreamed or imagined. Three million pounds don't seem anything like so
  important. I would like not to be a burden on you, Martin, otherwise I don't
  mind if I ever see that money or not. I used to think I was a little
  different from other women. I have come to the conclusion that I'm not. I
  think we are all the same&mdash;when the right man comes along."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p>Diana returned from the looking-glass a few minutes later but this time
  she did not resume her seat. Two of the waiters were in the room laying the
  cloth and dinner was presently served. During the meal they talked a little
  disjointedly about the events of the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mummy was not so bad really," Diana reflected. "I must see her
  if she calls before she goes back&mdash;or Dad. I expect they are on their
  way back to town, though, before now. They are getting on in life, you see,
  Martin, and it's rather trying for elderly people to be always short of
  money."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget," he reminded her, "that if Sir Adam really has disappeared
  for good they will get another million or so."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she murmured. "I hadn't forgotten that. Aunt Anna will have
  quite a great deal, too. The trouble of it is that they can think of nothing
  but my three millions. Directly they get that out of their minds they will
  feel better. I don't want to do anything rashly, Martin&mdash;we will talk it
  over later&mdash;but I daresay we might do something for the boys."</p>

  <p>"I think you ought to," Martin agreed. "I cannot see that that old man had
  the right to single you out in this fashion except that you are far the
  nicest of the lot."</p>

  <p>"Flatterer!" she smiled across at him.</p>

  <p>"It is almost too obviously the truth," he rejoined. "Sir Adam always had
  good taste. When he used to buy pictures he never bought a wrong 'un."</p>

  <p>"I love his Corots," she said, "and I think nearly all those odd pictures
  he bought in his younger days in Italy, copies of old masters, most of them,
  I think that they are beautiful."</p>

  <p>"Incidentally," Martin remarked, "I met a great collector who came down to
  look at them years ago. He dined with my uncle and me afterwards and he told
  us that there was not a single one of those that was not worth three times as
  much as Sir Adam paid for it. What I liked about the old boy, too, was that
  he never mentioned money in connection with a single picture he ever bought.
  It seemed as though in his mind they belonged to another world."</p>

  <p>"How interesting!" she exclaimed. "I daresay there was a great deal about
  him that we didn't really understand. I shouldn't have thought that he had a
  single ideal in his life."</p>

  <p>"There is one thing," Martin said gravely, "that we must guard
  against&mdash;you, especially, Diana. We only got this permission to look at
  his Will in case it might help us to find where the money was. We have found
  that now, all right, but the Courts won't accept Sir Adam's disappearance as
  being proof of his decease for a long time to come. The old gentleman might
  turn up again at any moment."</p>

  <p>"I only hope he will," Diana agreed. "It made me sick this afternoon to
  hear how everyone took his death for granted. What do you think yourself,
  really?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"I don't allow myself to think," he acknowledged. "I am a lawyer, you see,
  and the last thing a lawyer ought to harbour in his mind is a presentiment.
  Anyhow, we will talk about it later."</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table and patted him on the cheek.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we will," she whispered.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28"
     name="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">IN a very comfortable but ornate sitting room somewhere in
  the lower regions of the County Club three people were seated at a round
  table playing cards. In a high-backed chair, dressed in a dinner suit which
  was the facsimile of one which still reposed in his rooms at the bank house,
  sat Sir Adam. Opposite to him was a woman of pleasant appearance wearing a
  well-cut black gown&mdash;a woman possibly forty years old, who had preserved
  without difficulty or the aid of cosmetics a very agreeable exterior. By her
  side, still wearing the clothes in which he had served dinner to one or two
  loiterers, was Lawford. His whole attention was apparently concentrated upon
  the cards he was holding. Sir Adam's bright eyes were fixed upon him. There
  was a trace of that sardonic smile at the corner of his lips.</p>

  <p>"Now, come on, Lawford," he exclaimed in his rather shrill falsetto voice.
  "Your wife has made it two shillings. What about you?"</p>

  <p>"I shall raise it another sixpence, sir," Lawford declared at last.
  "Half-a-crown."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam's smile faded. He became thoughtful. He drew out his underlip and
  studied his cards once more.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Lawford," he said finally, "I hate to be ungallant but I am forced
  by circumstances to raise you the limit, that is, another shilling. Three and
  sixpence to 'see' me, if you please. Three shillings and sixpence, Mrs.
  Lawford. What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"I have never once caught you bluffing, Sir Adam," she observed
  respectfully, "and a one-card draw is a serious affair. I think, though," she
  added, looking at her small heap of counters and drawing out two, "that I
  shall 'see' you, Sir Adam."</p>

  <p>Lawford threw in his cards. Sir Adam sat upright in his chair, a gleam of
  anticipatory triumph in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What a pity that red-haired chump of yours is not here, Lawford," he
  grumbled. "There <i>would</i> be only three of us! Mrs. Lawford, I am very
  sorry to take your money but what do you think of this?"</p>

  <p>He laid down four fours. Mrs. Lawford indulged in a slight grimace.</p>

  <p>"Well, what I think is that I have lost my money, and there's the shilling
  fine," she said, throwing down her cards. "I was not bluffing, either. I had
  a small full house."</p>

  <p>"Not good enough," Sir Adam declared, rubbing his hands together. "Not
  good enough, Mrs. Lawford. That will be three and sixpence, your stake; and a
  shilling fine for fours is four and sixpence. I shall want that half-crown of
  yours, Lawford, and a shilling fine, if you please."</p>

  <p>They passed the money. Sir Adam gathered it in. He looked at his little
  pile with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry Johnson is not here, sir," Lawford remarked, shuffling the
  cards.</p>

  <p>"So am I," Sir Adam grunted. "That would have meant another shilling."</p>

  <p>"I simply could not take him off duty," the steward continued. "Sir
  Theodore was still in the club when I came down."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam chuckled. Lawford commenced to deal and the former picked up his
  cards one by one.</p>

  <p>"There are so many pleasures denied to us in life," he grumbled. "Why
  could I not have been there whilst they discussed my Will? I have an idea,
  Mrs. Lawford," he went on, "that they said very rude things about
  me&mdash;all except Diana. That girl is worth the whole lot of my wife's or
  my own relations put together. I have not lived in the world much for the
  last twenty years, Lawford, but I know what men and women are like. She's a
  good girl, Diana. Those others are a set of money-grabbers."</p>

  <p>Lawford placed the cards between his wife and Sir Adam. Sir Adam cut,
  Lawford thrust out an ante of threepence and Sir Adam, after some
  consideration, straddled.</p>

  <p>"I have had a good win," he said, "so I will give you all a chance. A
  shilling to play.. .. Were there any remarks in the club, Lawford?"</p>

  <p>"No one knew exactly what was going on, Sir Adam, and of course not a soul
  was in the room at any time. We could hear their voices sometimes, sir. I
  heard Lady Pengwill's, for instance, more than once and Lady Tidswell seemed
  very much upset."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam chuckled, but tapped upon the table.</p>

  <p>"Don't take my mind off the game," he begged. "The time has come with me,
  Lawford, when I can think of only one thing at a time. I straddled. It is the
  dealer's bet. Mrs. Lawford, what about it&mdash;you're dealing?"</p>

  <p>She looked at her husband.</p>

  <p>"One card, please."</p>

  <p>She gave it him and turned to Sir Adam. Sir Adam was very thoughtful
  indeed. Twice he seemed to change his mind, then at last he discarded
  two.</p>

  <p>"I will take two."</p>

  <p>He picked them up one by one and placed them in his hand without
  remark.</p>

  <p>"The dealer," Mrs. Lawford observed, "takes one."</p>

  <p>"And," Sir Adam reminded her, "the dealer bets."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lawford hesitated. She added threepence to the shilling in front of
  her.</p>

  <p>"Two shillings," Lawford announced. "I'm raising you ninepence, my dear.
  What about you, Sir Adam?" he added respectfully.</p>

  <p>Sir Adam threw in his cards with a disagreeable little grunt.</p>

  <p>"I wish that fellow Johnson would hurry up," he said. "Three makes a poor
  game of poker."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lawford "saw" her husband, and having the better two-pairs drew the
  money. Sir Adam pushed across his shilling grudgingly.</p>

  <p>"I wonder&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>He stopped short. There was a very quiet but distinctly audible tapping
  upon a small section of the mural panelling. Sir Adam held his head on one
  side and listened in astonishment. Lawford rose slowly to his feet. He was
  evidently petrified. Mrs. Lawford watched her husband in some concern.</p>

  <p>"Is it my fancy," Sir Adam whispered, "or is that knocking at the private
  door, Lawford?"</p>

  <p>"It is the private door, Sir Adam," Lawford admitted, and the little
  colour which he possessed had faded from his cheeks. "I don't understand it.
  Save myself, no one has used that passage&mdash;no one has a key to the
  concealed entrance."</p>

  <p>The knocking was repeated, this time a little louder.</p>

  <p>"Shall I open the door, Sir Adam?" Lawford asked. "I am afraid if anyone
  has got as far as that, the existence of the room must be known to him."</p>

  <p>"Most annoying," was the muttered reply. "Well, open it if you must,
  Lawford. I am in your hands."</p>

  <p>The steward still hesitated.</p>

  <p>"If the person who is there has found his way so far," he repeated, "he
  must know of the existence of the room. Tell me, Sir Adam&mdash;what are your
  wishes with regard to an intruder?"</p>

  <p>Sir Adam seemed to have relapsed into a motionless and inanimate figure.
  His eyes were half-closed. For a moment or two he seemed to be indulging in
  deep reflection. Then he opened his eyes.</p>

  <p>"What is there to be done, Lawford?" he demanded mildly. "Nothing in the
  way of melodrama. You would not suggest that, I am sure. The person who has
  found his way to that door must be admitted."</p>

  <p>For the third time the summons came. Lawford was half way across the room
  when they heard a click from the invisible keyhole. Slowly a panel was pushed
  from the other side. A man stood upon the threshold and took a step into the
  room, closing the door behind him. He looked around apologetically. There was
  a rather dazed look on his face and his left eyelid had drooped so that his
  eye was almost concealed.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," he said, "but this had to come. Will you introduce me to the
  lady and to Sir Adam, Lawford?"</p>

  <p>Lawford was not the man to lose his head. He obeyed at once.</p>

  <p>"The lady is my wife, who assists me in the management of the club, Mr.
  Snell," he said. "Sir Adam, this is Inspector Snell of Scotland Yard. He has
  been down here now for eight or nine days investigating the matter of
  the&mdash;er&mdash;accident in the vault, the&mdash;er&mdash;temporary
  disappearance of papers from the bank safes and your own&mdash;you will
  pardon me, Sir Adam&mdash;your own disappearance."</p>

  <p>Mr. Snell bowed to the lady, he bowed also to Sir Adam and approached a
  little nearer to the table. The latter looked at him in frank wonder. Mr.
  Snell's ginger-brown suit was a little out of shape and his hair was very
  unkempt indeed. He conformed to no one's preconceived idea of a Scotland Yard
  sleuth.</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" Sir Adam exclaimed. "And you are the man who has
  found me, are you?"</p>

  <p>"It was not difficult, Sir Adam," Snell told him; and the pleasantness of
  his voice did something to redeem his exterior. "As soon as I had the plans
  of the original building and compared them with the plans of the renovations,
  I began to see how easily a secret passageway might be arranged."</p>

  <p>"But tell me," Sir Adam asked, "what gave you the idea that I might be in
  the club all the time? Why didn't you believe like the others that I had
  disappeared in that motor car Lawford had waiting outside the warehouse next
  door?"</p>

  <p>Snell smiled.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth, sir," he explained, "I made a few enquiries myself
  about that motor car and I didn't find the information I received from the
  warehousemen or the clerks of the adjoining establishment exactly convincing.
  I never had very much faith in that motor car. Almost from the first, the
  probability of your being still in the club suggested itself to me. It was
  what you might call the detective instinct."</p>

  <p>"Did you know," Sir Adam enquired, "that Lawford had this passage arranged
  for me seven years ago?"</p>

  <p>"I was not sure about the date, sir," Snell replied, "but I thought it
  might have been done somewhere about the time that the renovation and
  rebuilding of the club took place. Directly I had the plans it became simply
  a question of cubic measurement and a reasonable amount of architectural
  prescience."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam's grimace was the gesture of an under-bred schoolboy.</p>

  <p>"I cannot think why they put a man like you on to such a job," he said
  peevishly. "Tell me, was any reward offered for my discovery?"</p>

  <p>"I fear not, Sir Adam," Snell replied. "If you would like to offer one
  yourself, sir, I shall be very glad to claim it."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam grinned.</p>

  <p>"Not one penny," he rejoined in a tone of disgust.</p>

  <p>"A reward has been suggested, sir," the Inspector told him, "in fact, Mr.
  Martin Mowbray was very keen about it."</p>

  <p>"At what amount did my relatives value my body dead or alive?" Sir Adam
  enquired.</p>

  <p>"I think the amount was to have been a thousand pounds," Snell
  confided.</p>

  <p>"For a thousand pounds cash I should have disclosed myself at any time
  within the last twenty-four hours," Sir Adam sighed fretfully. "However, what
  are you going to do about me now, Inspector? Can we not come to some
  arrangement? I am exceedingly comfortable where I am."</p>

  <p>"There is only one course open to me," Snell replied. "I am an employee of
  Scotland Yard and it is part of my duty to return you to your relatives and
  to your normal position in life."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam reflected. He leaned back in his chair, produced his pipe from
  his pocket and began slowly to fill it.</p>

  <p>Snell coughed apologetically.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam&mdash;" he ventured.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"I have answered all your questions. Would you permit me to ask you a
  few?"</p>

  <p>Sir Adam lit his pipe.</p>

  <p>"No harm in asking."</p>

  <p>"Why did you disappear?"</p>

  <p>There was a peculiar smile on Sir Adam's thin lips. He jerked his thumb
  upwards.</p>

  <p>"Ask the old gentleman outside."</p>

  <p>"The statue?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>Snell stroked his chin.</p>

  <p>"I don't think he would tell me."</p>

  <p>"Neither shall I."</p>

  <p>"People think you were afraid of something," Snell suggested
  cunningly.</p>

  <p>"More fools they!"</p>

  <p>"Why did you prepare this hiding-place?"</p>

  <p>"Always meant to come here some day. Best spot on earth. I hate my
  relations&mdash;I hate the bank. I say, Mr. Inspector&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Here I am and I admit that you have discovered me. You say that there was
  to have been a reward of a thousand pounds paid out of my estate. What if I
  handed you two thousand pounds in brand-new thousand-pound notes? I've got
  heaps of them here and over at the bank if you knew where to find them. What
  if I paid you that for failing to discover me and you pulled a long face and
  went back to Scotland Yard and looked for some other elderly gentleman who
  was missing?"</p>

  <p>Very slowly that left eyelid slipped up a little higher. One saw then that
  a smile was a very transforming thing to Inspector Snell. His eyes twinkled.
  Sir Adam's eyes also twinkled in response.</p>

  <p>"Is it a deal?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not, sir," the Inspector regretted, shaking his head. "No, Sir
  Adam, that cannot be done. But I will promise you this&mdash;I will see you
  through this little affair in any way agreeable to yourself if you will
  answer a few more questions."</p>

  <p>"Let's hear the questions," Sir Adam suggested.</p>

  <p>"Where is all the stuff you brought away from the bank&mdash;the notes and
  bonds and securities which you and Dyson used to spend your evenings making
  into brown-paper parcels?"</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose it is?" was the contemptuous reply. "In my bedroom
  here. The whole lot would have been here by now if that burglar hadn't
  blundered in."</p>

  <p>"I mustn't forget about that burglar. Who shot him?"</p>

  <p>"Dyson. Who do you suppose did? I told him to."</p>

  <p>"When?"</p>

  <p>"Pretty inquisitive, aren't you, eh? Never mind. It was about ten o'clock
  the night before I disappeared. Dyson was just leaving when we heard the trap
  door fall in the parlour. We opened up my end and there he was coming down
  the steps with a bunch of keys in his hand. Dyson had brought his gun. The
  man's hand went into his pocket as though he had one of his own. 'Shoot him!'
  I said. And Dyson did. Killed him dead," Sir Adam chuckled. "Served him
  right, too."</p>

  <p>"And you moved in here the next day?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't fancy it over there any more," Sir Adam grunted.</p>

  <p>"You left a lot of stuff behind," Snell reminded him.</p>

  <p>"Quite safe," Sir Adam grinned. "I'm the only one who knows the patent of
  the safes and we had just about cleared out all that was visible. Shan't
  answer any more questions."</p>

  <p>"I shall endeavour to show my gratitude," Snell announced. "I will hold my
  tongue for the immediate present, concerning my discovery. I will allow you
  to make your re-entry into the world in your own way. You can do so as though
  it were an entirely voluntary action."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam was silent for a moment or two but there was a happy twinkle in
  his eyes. He reflected more deeply. The twinkle grew brighter. His features
  relaxed.</p>

  <p>"That is a serious proposition?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am a man of my word," the Inspector assured him.</p>

  <p>Sir Adam glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Lawford," he said, "the hour has arrived for my evening drink. Give me my
  whisky-and-soda. Perhaps the Inspector would join me."</p>

  <p>"I should be delighted," was the prompt response.</p>

  <p>The Inspector accepted a generous whisky-and-soda and a cigar. He bowed to
  Sir Adam and Sir Adam bowed to him. Lawford, at a gesture from Sir Adam,
  opened a pint bottle of champagne&mdash;Veuve Clicquot '21&mdash;which was
  standing upon the sideboard. Mrs. Lawford's glass was also filled. They all
  three bowed to one another.</p>

  <p>"I have an idea!" Sir Adam exclaimed suddenly. "Inspector, your arrival
  was opportune. Do you happen to be acquainted with this little game we are
  playing&mdash;poker?"</p>

  <p>"I have wasted more time than I should like to admit playing poker," Snell
  confessed.</p>

  <p>"Join us," Sir Adam begged with enthusiasm. "Three is a ridiculous number.
  Lawford, place a chair for the Inspector. Count out some chips. Three-penny
  ante, one straddle, half-a-crown limit. Does that suit you, Mr. Snell?"</p>

  <p>"A most interesting game," the latter replied, drawing his chair closer to
  the table and producing the money for his chips.</p>

  <p>"My deal, I think," Sir Adam announced. "Your ante, Mrs. Lawford. Your
  straddle, Inspector&mdash;that is if you feel like it."</p>

  <p>Snell felt like it and obliged. The game proceeded. It proceeded until
  midnight. Then Lawford rose unwillingly to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam," he said, "you will excuse me, sir, but your room is ready. We
  have never played after midnight."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam sighed regretfully.</p>

  <p>"Your husband is right, Mr. Lawford," he agreed. "You will excuse an early
  party, Inspector. You played the game well, sir. Your presence, although
  unexpected, has given us great pleasure. I think that you owe the bank four
  shillings."</p>

  <p>"Four shillings it is," Snell admitted, passing the money over.</p>

  <p>"If you don't mind," Lawford suggested, "I should like to take you back
  into the club by the normal route."</p>

  <p>"As you please," Snell acquiesced. "To tell you the truth, notwithstanding
  all the help I had from the plans, it took me a long time to puzzle them out.
  Of course the one-two-three cross-and-slide panel we have known about at the
  Yard for several years now. That was easy. But there were other points about
  the work which were distinctly good, Lawford. I pray that you will always
  remain on the list of the lawkeepers."</p>

  <p>"You need have no fears on that score, Inspector," the steward assured
  him. "I have too much respect for the law ever to transgress. I must
  acknowledge, though, that ever since you asked to have a room allotted to you
  in the club I have been uneasy in my mind. I did my best to conceal my
  apprehensions&mdash;I didn't even mention them to Sir Adam&mdash;but I have
  been worried, Inspector. At three o'clock this morning, when you came down to
  the reading room, I was listening. I very nearly showed myself then but it
  didn't seem worth while. If you were on the right track we were done for,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Just a word before you go," Sir Adam begged. "Come over here, please. Let
  me tell you this, Mr. Snell. You are a decent fellow and with practice you
  would soon make a very fair poker player."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much, sir."</p>

  <p>"Look here," Sir Adam continued, "you made me a sporting offer when you
  disturbed our little game here. You said that since I was discovered and
  since you would have to announce the fact if I did not make a voluntary
  reappearance, you would allow me to do so in my own way?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the Inspector agreed. "Provided you do not unduly delay the
  matter."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Quite agreeable to me."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam held out his small thin hand.</p>

  <p>"When my Will is properly read out under the usual conditions, Inspector,"
  he confided amiably, "you may find a slight token of my regard. Good night,
  Inspector. Give me your arm, Lawford. Good night, Mrs. Lawford. Sorry to have
  robbed you all. Four and sixpence I won, I think. Sixpence your wife owes me,
  Lawford, on that last hand."</p>

  <p>"I will place the amount upon your dressing case, sir," the steward
  promised.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch29"
     name="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was Mr. Walter Clumberleyes, a highly respectable
  insurance agent and stock broker of Norchester, who, on the following
  morning, started the reign of terror which for a brief period of time
  completely broke down the sedate and tranquil atmosphere of the County Club.
  He approached the door of the reading room at about five minutes to one,
  having the pleased air of a man who has accomplished a good morning's work
  and is looking forward to a few minutes' contemplation of the daily paper
  before he deals with his cut from the joint with vegetables, cheese and
  whisky-and-soda. He reappeared from the room within thirty seconds with a
  demoniacal howl upon his lips which rang through the whole place and up to
  the roof&mdash;the cry of a man in mortal terror. His rubicund complexion had
  paled, his air of assurance vanished, his rather important walk become a
  staggering travesty of progress. He reeled into an umbrella stand, caught his
  foot against the edge of a mat and fell over on his side. A member who was
  hanging up his hat when the violent impetus of Clumberleyes' backward
  progress nearly sent him flying turned angrily round.</p>

  <p>"What the devil&mdash;" he began and then stopped.</p>

  <p>The small pageboy, who was halfway up the broad staircase in terrified
  flight, hung onto the banisters and looked down.</p>

  <p>"He's got a fit," he called out at the top of his voice. "That's what he's
  got. It's Mr. Clumberleyes. He's got a fit. Hear him!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Clumberleyes staggered to his feet, neglecting to gather together the
  remnants of his smashed pince-nez. He was still breathing hard. Two members
  hurried out from the lavatory still drying their hands on towels. They rushed
  over towards their breathless friend.</p>

  <p>"What on earth is the matter, Clumberleyes?" someone asked. "Are you
  ill?"</p>

  <p>Clumberleyes pointed to the door of the room from which he had just made
  so dramatic an exit. It was absolutely apparent that for the moment he had
  lost his power of speech. One of the two men, with a towel still in his hand,
  strode bravely across the hall and opened the door of the reading room. He
  stood there peering in. Five seconds later he had slammed the door and was
  zigzagging across the hall in bewildered fashion.</p>

  <p>"My God, did you see that?" he cried out to no one in particular.</p>

  <p>"Did we see what?" his companion demanded. "What's wrong with you,
  Mason?"</p>

  <p>Mason could only point dumbly at the reading room. His friend pushed past
  him. He, too, opened the door gingerly and looked in. A carefully dressed,
  shrunken-looking old gentleman was seated in the easy chair which had become
  notorious during the last ten days, with a pint of champagne by his side, a
  glass in his hand and a wicked smile upon his lips as he turned his head.
  Once more the door slammed. They all crowded round the last man who had
  staggered out, but he seemed to have retained more possession of his senses
  than his predecessors.</p>

  <p>"Is everybody mad here?" Frank Hewitt, a prosperous boot manufacturer
  demanded. "What's happened to the room?"</p>

  <p>"Go and see," the last person who had ventured in gasped.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hewitt was a big man and he knew no fear. He pushed past them and
  opened the door. He looked at the little figure in the chair and his jaw
  fell. The grin had become almost diabolical. A quivering hand held up the
  glass of champagne. Mr. Hewitt was a man who never hesitated. He half-fell,
  half-sprang back. Once more the little group was broken up. Mr. Clumberleyes,
  who had had the most time to get over the shock, made a great effort to pull
  himself together.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in ghosts," he cried, "and I have broken my pince-nez.
  That's either the Devil sitting in old Sir Adam's easy chair, or it's Sir
  Adam himself."</p>

  <p>Everyone made a movement as though towards the door. Everyone paused. They
  all looked hopefully towards Martin Mowbray, who had just run lightly up the
  steps and was gazing at them in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What's wrong?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"It's the old man come back&mdash;or the Devil."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;Sir Adam?" Martin exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Go and see," someone suggested.</p>

  <p>Martin hung up his hat, opened the door of the reading room and closed it
  again behind him. The shock was almost as great to him as to the others, for
  there was no doubt at all about Sir Adam's presence or that there was
  something portentously sinister about the contortion of those lips.
  Nevertheless, he disregarded every suggestion of the supernatural and walked
  on towards the chair.</p>

  <p>"Sir Adam!" he exclaimed, studying to control his voice. "Glad to see you
  back again."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam seemed a little disappointed.</p>

  <p>"So I can't frighten you like the others," he remarked. "You are the first
  man who has not had one glance at me and bolted out of the room squealing.
  Yes, I am back, Martin. Doesn't it look like it?"</p>

  <p>He imbibed a sip of his wine and set down the glass.</p>

  <p>"Martin," he went on, and for a moment there was something almost pitiful
  in the fading of that smile, "I have come back. It is not quite the fun I
  hoped. Listen, pass me that pen and ink and a sheet of paper."</p>

  <p>Martin did as he was bidden swiftly. Someone opened the door an inch or
  two and then closed it again.</p>

  <p>"Come right up to me," the old man begged. "Hurry! Take this
  down:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">
  I&mdash;Adam Blockton&mdash;of sound mind, hereby add as a codicil to my
  Will a legacy of One Thousand Pounds to Inspector Snell of Scotland Yard who
  had the wit to discover me and the good sense to grant my simple request.</p>

  <p>Sign it as witness, Martin."</p>

  <p>"You sign first," Martin enjoined, thrusting the pen between the shaking
  fingers.</p>

  <p>Sir Adam did as he was told. Martin signed as witness.</p>

  <p>"Is that legal&mdash;all right&mdash;binding?" Sir Adam asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Of course it is," Martin told him. "I'll guarantee that, Sir Adam. We
  ought to have another witness, but no one would ever dispute it. Why are you
  in such a hurry?"</p>

  <p>Sir Adam looked out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Nasty look in the old man's eye this morning," he whispered. "I don't
  think he's glad to see me back."</p>

  <p>"He's all right," Martin reassured him. "Here, let me fill up your glass.
  You haven't half drunk your wine. It'll do you good."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam's fingers were trembling.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I don't think I'll drink any more, Martin. Tell me, was
  there much of a row when your uncle told them about my Will?"</p>

  <p>"A hell of a row," Martin acknowledged.</p>

  <p>"And Diana&mdash;was she glad?"</p>

  <p>"She's only human. She was disgusted with the others. She couldn't help
  being pleased for herself. She's not a hypocrite, you know, sir."</p>

  <p>"She's about the only human being I really respect, except my friends
  downstairs," Sir Adam muttered slowly. "You can tell her that from me,
  Martin. Do you know what is going to happen to me?"</p>

  <p>"You're going to finish that wine and come and have lunch with us all,
  sir," Martin declared. "We're not going to bother you about your
  disappearance. We're only glad to get you back again."</p>

  <p>Sir Adam slipped a little farther down in his chair. Martin always fancied
  that the thin fingers grasped his faintly.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to die, Martin," he groaned. "That's all. See that the funny
  little man with the crumpled brown suit gets his thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"I'll see to it," Martin promised. "But look here, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke he knew that it was hopeless. Sir Adam had completed his
  disappearance.</p>
