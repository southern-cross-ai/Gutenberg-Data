  <h2><a id="pref"
     name="pref">PREFACE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MANY years have elapsed since the author was constrained
  (not by <i>a priori</i> considerations but by historical and critical
  evidence) to disbelieve in the miraculous element of the Bible. Yet he
  retained the belief of his childhood and youth&mdash;rooted more firmly than
  before&mdash;in the eternal unity of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit,
  in the supernatural but non-miraculous incarnation of the Son as Jesus
  Christ, and in Christ's supernatural but non-miraculous resurrection after He
  had offered Himself up as a sacrifice for the sins of the world.</p>

  <p>The belief is commonly supposed to be rendered impossible by the
  disbelief. This book is written to show that there is no such
  impossibility.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of the worshippers of Christ base their worship to a
  very large extent&mdash;as the author did in his early youth, under the cloud
  of Paley's <i>Evidences</i>&mdash;on their acceptance of His miracles as
  historical facts. In the author's opinion this basis is already demonstrably
  unsafe, and may be at any moment, by some new demonstration, absolutely
  destroyed.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless such worshippers, if their worship is really genuine&mdash;
  that is to say, if it includes love, trust, and awe, carried to their highest
  limits, and not merely that kind of awe which is inspired by "mighty
  works"&mdash;will do well to avoid this book. If doubt has not attacked them,
  why should they go to meet it? In pulling up falsehood by the roots there is
  always a danger of uprooting or loosening a truth that grows beside it.
  Historical error, if honest, is better (and less misleading) than spiritual
  darkness. For example, it is much better (and less misleading) to remain in
  the old-fashioned belief that a good and wise God created the world in six
  days than to adopt a new belief that a bad or unwise or careless God&mdash;or
  a chance, or a force, or a power&mdash;evolved it in sixty times six
  sextillions of centuries.</p>

  <p>To such genuine worshippers of Christ, then, as long as they feel safe and
  sincere in their convictions, this book is not addressed. They are (in the
  author's view) substantially right, and had better remain as they are.</p>

  <p>But there may be some, calling themselves worshippers of Christ, who
  cannot honestly say that they love Him. They trust His power, they bow before
  Him as divine; but they have no affection at all for Him, as man, or as God.
  What St Paul described as the "constraining" love of Christ has never touched
  them. And yet they fancy they worship! To them this book may be of use in
  suggesting the divinity and loveableness of Christ's human nature; and any
  harm the book might do them can hardly be conceived as equal to the harm of
  remaining in their present position. One may learn Christ by rote, as one may
  learn Euclid by rote, so as to be almost ruined for really knowing either.
  For such learners the best course may be to go back and begin again.</p>

  <p>It is, however, to a third class of readers that the author mainly
  addresses himself. Having in view the experiences of his own early manhood,
  he regards with a strong fellow feeling those who desire to worship Christ
  and to be loyal and faithful to Him, if only they can at the same time be
  loyal and faithful to truth, and who doubt the compatibility of the double
  allegiance.</p>

  <p>These, many of them, cannot even conceive how they can worship Christ at
  the right hand of God, or the Son in the bosom of the Father in heaven,
  unless they first believe in Him as miraculously manifested on earth. Not
  being able to accept Him as miraculous, they reject Him as a Saviour. To them
  this book specially appeals, endeavouring to show, in a general and popular
  way&mdash;on psychological, historical, and critical grounds&mdash;how the
  rejection of the claim made by most Christians that their Lord is miraculous,
  may be compatible with a frank and full acceptance of the conclusion that He
  is, in the highest sense, divine.</p>

  <p>Detailed proofs this volume does not offer. These will be given in a
  separate volume of "Notes," shortly to be published. This will be of a
  technical nature, forming Part VII of the series called Diatessarica. The
  present work merely aims at suggesting such conceptions of history,
  literature, worship, human nature, and divine Being, as point to a fore
  ordained conformation of man to God, to be fulfilled in the Lord Jesus
  Christ, of which the fulfilment may be traced in the Christian writings and
  the Christian churches of the first and second centuries.</p>

  <p>It also attempts, in a manner not perhaps very usual, to meet many
  objections brought against Christianity by those who assert that its records
  are inadequate, inaccurate, and contradictory.. Instead of denying these
  defects, the author admits and emphasizes them as being inseparable from
  earthen vessels containing a spiritual treasure, and as (in some cases)
  indirectly testifying to the divinity of the Person whom the best efforts of
  the best and most inspired of the evangelists inadequately, though honestly,
  portray. Specimens of these defects are freely given, showing the
  modifications, amplifications, and (in some case) misinterpretations or
  corruptions, to which Christian tradition was inevitably exposed in passing
  from the east to the west during a period of about one hundred and thirty
  years, dating from the Crucifixion.</p>

  <p>These objects the author has endeavoured to attain by sketching an
  autobiography of an imaginary character, by name Quintus Junius Silanus, who
  in the second year of Hadrian (A.D. 118) becomes a hearer of Epictetus and a
  Christian convert, and commits his experiences to paper forty-five years
  afterwards in the second year of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Verus
  (A.D. 163).</p>

  <h3 style="break-before: always"><a id="summ"
     name="summ">SUMMARY</a></h3>

  <p><i>Quintus Junius Silanus born 90 A.D., goes from Rome at the suggestion
  of his old friend Marcus Aemilius Scaurus to attend the lectures of Epictetus
  in Nicopolis about 118 A.D.</i></p>

  <p><i>Scaurus {like Silanus an imaginary character) born about 50 A.D., is a
  disabled soldiery and has been for many years a student of miscellaneous
  Greek literature including Christian writings. In reply to a letter from
  Scaurus extolling his new teacher, Scaurus expresses his belief that
  Epictetus has passed through a stage of infection with "the Christian
  superstition" from which he has borrowed some parts of the superstructure
  while rejecting its foundation.</i></p>

  <p><i>Silanus in order to defend his teacher Epictetus from what he considers
  an unjust imputation, procures the epistles of Paul, His interest in these
  leads him to the "scriptures" from which Paul quotes. Thence he is led on to
  speculate about the nature of the "gospel" preached by Paul, and about the
  character and utterances of the "Christ" from whom that "gospel" originated.
  The epistles convey to him a sense of spiritual strength and "constraining
  love," He determines to procure the Christian gospels.</i></p>

  <p><i>During all this time he is occasionally corresponding with Scaurus and
  attending the lectures of Epictetus, which satisfy him less and less.
  Contrasted with the spiritual strength in the epistles of Paul the lectures
  seem to contain only spirited effervescence. And there is an utter absence of
  "constraining love."</i></p>

  <p><i>When the three Synoptic gospels reach Silanus from Rome, he receives at
  the same time a destructive criticism on them from Scaurus, Much of this
  criticism he is enabled to meet with the aid of the Pauline epistles. But
  enough remains to shake his faith in their historical accuracy. Nor does he
  find in them the same presence that he found in the epistles, of
  "constraining love," The result is, that he is thrown back from
  Christ.</i></p>

  <p><i>At this crisis he meets Clemens, an Athenian, who lends him a gospel
  that has recently appeared, the gospel of John, Clemens frankly admits his
  doubts about its authorship, and about its complete accuracy, but commends it
  as conveying the infinite spiritual revelation inherent in Christ less
  inadequately than it is conveyed by the Synoptists.</i></p>

  <p><i>A somewhat similar view is expressed by Scaurus though with a large
  admixture of hostile criticism. He has recently received the fourth gospel,
  and it forms the subject of his last letter. While rejecting much of it as
  unhistorical, he expresses great admiration for it, and for what he deems its
  fundamental principle, namely, that Jesus cannot he understood save through a
  "disciple whom Jesus loved."</i></p>

  <p><i>While speculating on what might have happened if he himself had come
  under the influence of a "disciple whom Jesus loved" Scaurus is struck down
  by paralysis. Silanus sets sail for Italy in the hope of finding his friend
  still living. At the moment when he is losing sight of the hills above
  Nicopolis where Clemens is praying for him, Silanus receives an apprehension
  of Christ's "constraining love" and becomes a Christian.</i></p>
  <hr style="width:40%">

  <p>No attempt has been made to give the impression of an archaic or Latin
  style. Hence "Christus" and "Paulus" are mostly avoided except in a few
  instances where they are mentioned for the first time by persons speaking
  from a non-Christian point of view. Similar apparent inconsistencies will be
  found in the use of "He" and "he," denoting Christ. The use varies, partly
  according to the speaker, partly according to the speaker's mood. It varies
  also in quotations from scripture according to the extent to which the
  Revised Version is followed.</p>

  <p>The utterances assigned to Epictetus are taken from the records of his
  sayings by Arrian or others. Some of these have been freely translated,
  paraphrased, and transposed; but none of them are imaginary. When Silanus
  says that his friend Arrian "never heard Epictetus say" this or that, the
  meaning is that the expression does not occur in Epictetus's extant works, so
  far as can be judged from Schenkl's admirable Index.</p>

  <p>The words assigned to Arrian, Silanus' s friend, when speaking in his own
  person, are entirely imaginary; but the statements made about Arrian's
  birth-place and official career are based on history.</p>

  <p>Any words assigned by Scaurus to his "friend" Pliny, Plutarch, or
  Josephus, or by Silanus to "the young Irenaeius," or Justin, may be taken to
  be historical. The references will be given in the volume of Notes.</p>

  <p>Scaurus and Silanus occasionally describe themselves as "finding marginal
  notes" indicating variations in their mss. of the gospels. In all such cases
  the imaginary "marginal notes" are based on actual various readings or
  interpolations which will be given in the volume of Notes. Most of these are
  of an early date, and may be based on much earlier originals; and care has
  been taken to exclude any that are of late origin. But the reader must bear
  in mind that we have no mss. of the gospels, and therefore no "marginal
  notes," of so early a date as 118 A.D.</p><br>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">I. &mdash; THE FIRST LECTURE</a></h2>

  <p><i>"I forbid you to go into the senate-house!" "As long as I am a senator,
  go I must."</i></p>

  <p class="first">TWO voices were speaking from one person&mdash;the first,
  pompous, coarse, despotic; the second, refined, dry, austere.</p>

  <p>There was nothing that approached stage-acting&mdash;only the suggestion
  of one man swelling out with authority, and of another straightening up his
  back in resistance. These were the first words I hear from Epictetus, as I
  crept late into the lecture-room, tired with a long journey overnight into
  Nicopolis.</p>

  <p>I need not have feared to attract attention. All eyes were fixed on the
  lecturer as I stole into a place near the door, next to my friend Arrian, who
  was absorbed in his notes. What was it all about? In answer to my look of
  inquiry Arrian pushed me his last sheet with the names "Vespasian" and
  "Helvidius Priscus" scrawled large upon it. Then I knew what it meant. It was
  a story now forty years old&mdash;which I had often heard from my father's
  old friend, Aemilius Scaurus&mdash;illustrating the duty of obeying the voice
  of the conscience rather than the voice of a king. Epictetus, after his
  manner, was throwing it into the form of a dialogue:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"<i>Vespasian.</i> I forbid you to go into the senate-house.</p>

  <p>"<i>Priscus.</i> As long as I am a senator, go I must.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vespasian.</i> Go, then, but be silent.</p>

  <p>"<i>Priscus.</i> Do not ask my opinion, and I will be silent.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vespasian.</i> But I am bound to ask it.</p>

  <p>"<i>Priscus.</i> And I am bound to answer, and to answer what I think
  right.</p>

  <p>"<i>Vespasian.</i> Then I shall kill you.</p>

  <p>"<i>Priscus.</i> Did I ever say that I could not be killed? It is yours to
  kill; mine, to die fearless."</p>

  <p>I give his words almost as fully as Arrian took them down. But his tone
  and spirit are past man's power to put on paper. He flashed from Emperor to
  Senator like the zig-zag of lightning with a straight down flash at the end.
  This was always his way. He would play a thousand parts, seeming,
  superficially, a very Proteus; but they were all types of two characters, the
  philosopher and the worldling, the follower of the Logos and the follower of
  the flesh. Moreover, he was always in earnest, in hot earnest. On the surface
  he would jest like Menander or jibe like Aristophanes; but at bottom he was a
  tragedian. At one moment he would point to his halting leg and flout himself
  as a lame old grey-beard with a body of clay. In the next, he was "a son of
  Zeus," or "God's own son," or "carrying about God." Never at rest, he might
  deceive a stranger into supposing that he was occasionally rippling and
  sparkling with real mirth like a sea in sunlight. But it was never so. It was
  a sea of molten metal and there was always a Vesuvius down below.</p>

  <p>I suspect that he never knew mirth or genial laughter even as a child. He
  was born a slave, his master being Epaphroditus, a freedman of Nero's and his
  favourite, afterwards killed by Domitian. I have heard&mdash;but not from
  Arrian&mdash;that this master caused his lameness. He was twisting his leg
  one day to see how much he could bear. The boy&mdash;for he was no
  more&mdash;said with a smile, "If you go on, you will break it," and then,
  "Did not I tell you, you would break it?" True or false, this story gives the
  boy as I knew the man. You might break his leg but never his will. I do not
  know whether Epaphroditus, out of remorse, had him taught philosophy; but
  taught he was, under one of the best men of the day, and he acquired such
  fame that he was banished from Rome under Domitian, with other philosophers
  of note&mdash;whether at or before the time when Domitian put Epaphroditus to
  death I cannot say. In one of his lectures he described how he was summoned
  before the Prefect of the City with the other philosophers: "Come," said the
  Prefect, "come, Epictetus, shave off your beard." "If I am a philosopher," he
  replied, "I am not going to shave it off." "Then I shall take your head off."
  "If it is for your advantage, take it off."</p>

  <p>But now to return to my first lecture. Among our audience were several men
  of position and one at least of senatorial rank. Some of them seemed a little
  scandalized at the Teacher's dialogue. It was not likely that the Emperor
  would take offence, for in the second year of Hadrian we were not in a
  Neronian or Domitian atmosphere; moreover, our Teacher was known to be on
  good terms with the new Emperor. But perhaps their official sense of
  propriety was shocked; and, in the first sentence of what follows, Epictetus
  may have been expressing their thoughts: "<i>'So you, philosophers teach
  people to despise the throne!'</i> Heaven forbid! Which of us teaches anyone
  to lay claim to anything over which kings have authority? Take my body, take
  my goods, take my reputation! Take my friends and relations! 'Yes,' says the
  ruler, 'but I must also be ruler over your convictions.' Indeed, and who gave
  you this authority?"</p>

  <p>Epictetus went on to say that if indeed his pupils were of the true
  philosophic stamp, holding themselves detached from the things of the body
  and with their minds fixed on the freedom of the soul, he would have no need
  to spur them to boldness, but rather to draw them back from over-hasty
  rushing to the grave; for, said he, they would come flocking about him,
  begging and praying to be allowed to teach the tyrant that they were free, by
  finding freedom at once in self-inflicted death: "Here on earth. Master,
  these robbers and thieves, these courts of justice and kings, have the upper
  hand. These creatures fancy that they have some sort of authority over us,
  simply because they have a hold on our paltry flesh and its possessions!
  Suffer us. Master, to show them that they have authority over nothing!" If,
  said he, a pupil of this high spirit were brought before the tribunal of one
  of the rulers of the earth, he would come back scoffing at such "authority"
  as a mere scarecrow: "Why all these preparations, to meet no enemy at all?
  The pomp of his authority, his solemn anteroom, his gentlemen of the chamber,
  his yeomen of the guard&mdash;did they all come to no more than this! These
  things were nothing, and I was preparing to meet something great!"</p>

  <p>On the scholar of the unpractical and cowardly type, anxiously preparing
  "what to say" in his defence before the magistrate's tribunal, he poured hot
  scorn. Had not the fellow, he asked, been practising "what to say"&mdash;all
  his life through? "What else," said he, "have you been practising? Syllogisms
  and convertible propositions!" Then came the reply, in a whine, "Yes, but he
  has authority to kill me!" To which the Teacher answered, "Then speak the
  truth, you pitiful creature. Cease your imposture and give up all claim to be
  a philosopher. In the lords of the earth recognise your own lords and
  masters. As long as you give them this grip on you, through your flesh, so
  long must you be at the beck and call of every one that is stronger than you
  are. Socrates and Diogenes had practised 'what to say' by the practice of
  their lives. But as for you&mdash;get you back to your own proper business,
  and never again budge from it! Back to your own snug comer, and sit there at
  your leisure, spinning your syllogisms:</p>

  <p class="quote">'In thee is not the stuff that makes a man<br>
  A people's leader.'"</p>

  <p>Thence he passed to the objection that a judicial condemnation might bring
  disgrace on a man's good name. "The authorities, you say, have condemned you
  as guilty of impiety and profanity. What harm is there in that for you? This
  creature, with authority to condemn you&mdash;does he himself know even the
  meaning of piety or impiety? If a man in authority calls day night or bass
  treble, do men that know take notice of him? Unless the judge knows what the
  truth is, his 'authority to judge' is no authority. No man has authority over
  our convictions, our inmost thoughts, our will. Hence when Zeno the
  philosopher went into the presence of Antigonus the king, it was the king
  that was anxious, not the philosopher. The king wished to gain the
  philosopher's good opinion, but the philosopher cared for nothing that the
  king could give. When, therefore, you go to the palace of a great ruler,
  remember that you are in effect going to the shop of a shoemaker or a
  grocer&mdash;on a great scale of course, but still a grocer. He cannot sell
  you anything real or lasting, though he may sell his groceries at a great
  price."</p>

  <p>At the bottom of all this doctrine about true and false authority, there
  was, as I afterwards understood, a belief that God had bestowed on all men,
  if they would but accept and use it, authority over their own wills, so that
  we might conform our wills to His, as children do with a Father, and might
  find pleasure, and indeed our only pleasure, in doing this&mdash;accepting
  all bodily pain and evil as not evil but good because it comes from His will,
  which must be also our will and must be honoured and obeyed. "When," said he,
  "the ruler says to anyone, 'I will fetter your leg,' the man that is in the
  habit of honouring his leg cries, 'Don't, for pity's sake!' But the man that
  honours his will says, 'If it appears advisable to you, fetter it'."</p>

  <p>"<i>Tyrant</i>. Won't you bend?</p>

  <p>"<i>Cynic</i>. I will not bend.</p>

  <p>"<i>Tyrant</i>. I will show you that I am lord.</p>

  <p>"<i>Cynic</i>. You! impossible! I have been freed by Zeus. Do you really
  imagine that He would allow His own son to be made a slave? But of my corpse
  you <i>are</i> lord. Take it."</p>

  <p>In this particular lecture Epictetus also gave us a glimpse of a wider and
  more divine authority imparted by God to a few special natures, akin to
  Himself, whereby, as God is supreme King over men His children, so a chosen
  few may become subordinate kings over men their brethren. Like Plato, he
  seemed to look forward to a time when rulers would become philosophers, or
  else philosophers kings. Nero and Sardanapalus, Agamemnon and Alexander, all
  came under his lash&mdash;all kings and rulers of the old regime. Not that he
  denied Agamemnon a superiority to Nero, or the right to call himself
  "shepherd of the people" if he pleased. "Sheep, indeed," he exclaimed, "to
  submit to be ruled over by you!" and "Shepherd, indeed, for you weep like the
  shepherds, when a wolf has snatched away a sheep!"</p>

  <p>From these old-fashioned rulers he passed to a new and nobler ideal of
  kingship: "Those kings and tyrants received from their armed guards the power
  of rebuking and punishing wrongdoing, though they might be rascals
  themselves. But on the Cynic"&mdash;that was the term he used&mdash;"this
  power is bestowed by the conscience." Then he explained to us what he meant
  by "conscience"&mdash;the consciousness of a life of wise, watchful, and
  unwearied toil for man, with the cooperation of God. "And how," he asked,
  "could such a man fail to be bold and speak the truth with boldness,
  speaking, as he does, to his own brethren, to his own children and kinsfolk?
  So inspired, he is no meddler or busybody. Supervising and inspecting the
  affairs of mankind, he is not busying himself with other men's matters, but
  with his own. Else, call a general, too, a busybody, when he is busy
  inspecting his own soldiers!"</p>

  <p>This was, to me, quite a new view of the character of a Cynic But
  Epictetus insisted on it with reiteration. The Cynic, he said, was Warrior
  and Physician in one. As a warrior, he was like Hercules, wandering over the
  world with his club and destroying noxious beasts and monsters. As a
  physician, he was like Socrates or Diogenes, going about and doing good to
  those afflicted with sickness of mind, diagnosing each disease, prescribing
  diet, cautery, or other remedy. In both these capacities, the Cynic received
  from God authority over men, and men recognised it in him, because they
  perceived him to be their benefactor and deliverer.</p>

  <p>There are, said Epictetus, in each man two characters&mdash;the character
  of the Beast and the character of the Man. By Beast he meant wild or savage
  beast, as distinct from tame beast, which he preferred to call "sheep."
  "Sheep" meant the cowardly, passive-greedy passions within us. "The Beast"
  meant the savage, aggressive-greedy nature, not only stirring us up to
  external war against our neighbours, but also waging war to the death against
  our inward better nature, against the "Man." The mark or stamp of the Beast
  he connected with Nero. "Cast it away," he said. The opposite mark or stamp
  he connected with the recently deceased Emperor, Trajan. If we acted like a
  beast, he warned us that we should become like a beast, and then, according
  to his customary phrase, "<i>You will have lost the Man.</i>" And was this,
  asked he, nothing to lose? Over and over again he repeated it: "<i>You have
  thrown away the Man.</i>" It was in this light&mdash;as a type of the
  Man&mdash;that he regarded Hercules, the first of the Cynics, the Son of God,
  going on the errands of the Father to destroy the Beast in its various
  shapes, typifying an armed Missionary, but armed for spiritual not for
  fleshly warfare, destroying the Beast that would fain dominate the world. But
  it was for Diogenes that he reserved his chief admiration, placing him (I
  think) even above Socrates, or at all events praising him more
  warmly&mdash;partly, perhaps, out of fellow-feeling, because Diogenes, too,
  like himself, had known what it was to be a slave. Never shall I forget the
  passage in this lecture in which he described Alexander surprising the great
  Cynic asleep, and waking him up with a line of Homer:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"To sleep all night suits not a Councillor,"</p>

  <p>&mdash;to which Diogenes replied at once in the following line, claiming
  for himself the heavy burden (entrusted to him by Zeus) of caring like a king
  for all the nations of the earth:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">"Who holds, in trust, the world's vast orb of cares."</p>

  <p>Diogenes, according to our Teacher, was much more than an Aesculapius of
  souls; he was a sovereign with "the sceptre and the kingdom of the Cynic."
  Some have represented Epictetus as claiming this authority for himself. But
  in the lecture that I heard, it was not so. Though what he said might have
  been mistaken as a claim for himself, it was really a claim for "the Cynic,"
  as follows. First he put the question, "How is it possible for one destitute,
  naked, homeless, hearthless, squalid, with not one slave to attend him, or a
  country to call his own, to lead a life of equable happiness?" To which he
  replied, "Behold, God hath sent unto you the man to demonstrate in act this
  possibility. <i>'Look on me, and see that I am without country, home
  possessions, slaves; no bed but the ground, no wife, no children&mdash;no
  palace to make a king or governor out of me&mdash;only the earth, and the
  sky, and one threadbare cloak! And yet what do I want? Am I not fearless? Am
  I not free? When saw ye me failing to find any good thing that I desired, or
  failing into any evil that I would fain have avoided? What fault found I ever
  with God or man? When did I ever accuse anyone? Did anyone ever see me with a
  gloomy face? How do I confront the great persons before whom you, worldlings,
  bow abashed and dismayed? Do not I treat them as cringing slaves? Who, that
  sees me, does not feel that he sees in me his natural Lord and
  Master?'</i>"</p>

  <p>I confess that up to this point I had myself supposed that he was speaking
  of himself, standing erect as ruler of the world. But in the next instant he
  had dropped, as it were, from the pillar upon which he had been setting up
  the King, and now, like a man at the pedestal pointing up to the statue on
  the top, he exclaimed, "Behold, these are the genuine Cynic's utterances:
  this is his stamp and image: this is his aim!"</p>

  <p>He passed on to answer the question. What if the Cynic missed his aim, or,
  at least, missed it so far as exerting the royal authority over others? What
  if death cut his purpose short? In that case, he said, the will, the purpose,
  the one essential good, had at all events remained in its purity; and how
  could man die better than in such actions? "If, while I am thus employed,
  death should overtake me, it will suffIce me if I can lift up my hands to God
  and say, 'The helps that I received from thee, to the intent that I might
  understand and follow thy ordering of the universe, these I have not
  neglected. I have not disgraced thee, so far as in me lay. See how I have
  used these faculties which thou hast given me! Have I ever found fault with
  thee? ever been ill-pleased with anything that has happened or ever wished it
  to happen otherwise? Thou didst beget me, and I thank thee for all thou
  gavest me. I have used to the full the gifts that were of thy giving and I am
  satisfied. Receive them back again and dispose them in such region as may
  please thee. Thine were they all, and thou hast given them unto me.'" Then,
  turning to us, he said, "Are you not content to take your exit after this
  fashion? Than such a life, what can be better, or more full of grace and
  beauty? Than such an end, what can be more full of blessing?"</p>

  <p>There was much more, which I cannot recall. I was no longer in a mood to
  note and remember exact words and phrases,, and I despair of making my
  readers understand why. Able philosophers and lecturers I had heard before,
  but none like this man. Some of those had moved me to esteem and gained my
  favourable judgement. But this man did more than "move" me. He whirled me
  away into an upper region of spiritual possibility, at once glad and
  sad&mdash;sad at what I was, glad at what I might be. Alcibiades says in the
  Symposium of Plato that whereas the orator Pericles had only moved his outer
  self to admiration, the teaching of Socrates caught hold of his very soul,
  "whirling it away into a Corybantic dance." I quoted these words to Arrian as
  we left the lecture-room together, and he replied that they were just to the
  point. "Epictetus," he said," is by birth a Phrygian. And, like the Phrygian
  priests of Cybele, with their cymbals and their dances, he has just this
  power of whirling away his hearers into any region he pleases and making them
  feel at any moment what he wishes them to feel. But," added he thoughtfully,
  "it did not last with Alcibiades. Will it last with us?"</p>

  <p>I argued&mdash;or perhaps I should say protested&mdash;at considerable
  length, that it would last. Arrian walked on for a while without answering.
  Presently he said, "This is your first lecture. It is not so with me. I, as
  you know, have heard Epictetus for several months, and I admire him as much
  as you do, perhaps more. I am sure he is doing me good. But I do not aim at
  being his ideal Cynic. <i>'In me is not the stuff'</i>&mdash;I admit his
  censure&mdash;that makes a man into a King, bearing all the cares of all
  mankind upon his shoulders. My ambition is, some day, to become (as you are
  by birth) a Roman citizen"&mdash;he was not one then, nor was he Flavius
  Arrianus, but I have called him by the name by which he became known in the
  world&mdash;" and to do good work in the service of the Empire, as an officer
  of the State and yet an honest man. For that purpose I want to keep myself in
  order&mdash;at all events to some reasonable extent. Epictetus is helping me
  to do this, by making me ashamed of the foul life of the Beast, and by making
  me aspire to what he calls 'the Man.' That I feel day by day, and for that I
  am thankful.</p>

  <p>"But if you ask me about the reality of this 'authority,' which our
  Teacher claims for his Cynic, then, in all honesty, I must confess to doubts.
  Socrates, certainly, has moved the minds of civilised mankind. But then he
  had, as you know, a 'daemonic something' in him, a divine voice of some kind.
  And he believed in the immortality of the soul&mdash;a point on which you
  have not yet heard what Epictetus has to say. As to Diogenes, though I have
  always faithfully recorded in my notes what our Teacher says about him, yet I
  do not feel that the philosopher of the tub had the same heaven-sent
  authority as Socrates, or as Epictetus himself. And, indeed, did you not
  yourself hear to-day that God gives us authority over nothing but our own
  hearts and wills? How, then, can the Cynic claim this authority over others,
  except as an accident? But I forget. Perhaps Epictetus did not mention to-day
  his usual doctrine about 'good' and 'evil,' about 'peace of mind' and about
  the 'rule' of our neighbours as being 'no evil' to us. It reappears in almost
  every lecture. Wait till you have heard this.</p>

  <p>"Again, as to the origin of this authority, the Teacher tells us that it
  is given by God&mdash;or by Gods, for he uses both expressions. But by what
  God or Gods? Is not this a matter of great importance? Wait till you have
  heard him on this point. Now I must hasten back to my rooms to commit my
  notes to writing while fresh in my memory. We meet in the lecture-room
  to-morrow. Meantime, believe me, I most heartily sympathize with you in your
  admiration of one whom I account the best of all living philosophers. I have
  all your conviction of his sincerity. Assuredly, whencesoever he derives it,
  he has in him a marvellous power for good. The Gods grant that it may
  last!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap02"
     name="chap02">II. &mdash; EPICTETUS ON THE GODS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ARRIAN was right in thinking that the next lecture would be
  on the Gods. I had come to Nicopolis at the end of one of the
  lecture-courses, and had heard its conclusion&mdash;the perfecting of the
  Cynic. The new course began by describing the purpose of God in making
  man.</p>

  <p>But at the outset the subject was, not God, but the Logos&mdash;that word
  so untranslatable into our Latin, including as it does suggestions of our
  Word, Discourse, Reason, Logic, Understanding, Purpose, Proportion, and
  Harmony. Starting from this, Epictetus first said that the only faculty that
  could, as it were, behold itself, and theorize about itself, was the faculty
  of the Logos, which is also the faculty with which we regard, and, so to
  speak, mentally handle, all phenomena. From the Logos, or Word, he passed to
  God, as the Giver of this faculty: "It was therefore right and meet that this
  highest and best of all gifts should be the only one that the Gods have
  placed at our disposal. All the rest they have not placed at our disposal.
  Can it be that the Gods did not wish to place them in our power? For my part,
  I think that, if they had been able, they would have entrusted us also with
  the rest. But they were absolutely unable. For, being on earth, and bound up
  with such a body as this"&mdash;and here he made his usual gesture of
  self-contempt, mocking at his own lame figure&mdash;"how was it possible that
  we should not be prevented by these external fetters from receiving those
  other gifts? But what says Zeus?"&mdash;with that, the halting mortal,
  turning suddenly round, had become the Olympian Father addressing a child six
  years old: <i>"Epictetus, if it had been practicable, I would have made your
  dear little body quite free, and your pretty little possessions quite free
  too, and quite at your disposal. But as it is, don't shut your eyes to the
  truth. This little body is not your very own. It is only a neat arrangement
  in clay."</i></p>

  <p>After a pause, the Epictetian Zeus continued as follows, falling from "I"
  to "we." Some of our fellow-scholars declared to Arrian after lecture that
  Epictetus could not have meant this change, and they slightly altered the
  words in their notes. I prefer to give the diffIcult words of Zeus as Arrian
  took them down and as I heard them: <i>"But, since I was not able to do
  this,</i> WE <i>gave you a portion of</i> OURSELVES, <i>this
  power"</i>&mdash;and here Epictetus made believe to put a little box into the
  child's hand, adding that it contained a power of pursuing or avoiding, of
  liking or disliking&mdash;<i>"Take care of this, and put in it all that
  belongs to you. As long as you do this, you wilt never be hindered or
  hampered, never cry, never scold, and never flatter."</i></p>

  <p>The change from I to WE was certainly curious; and some said that "we
  gave," <i>edôkamen</i>, ought to be regarded as two words, <i>edôka men</i>,
  "I gave on the one hand." But "on the one hand" made no sense. Nor could they
  themselves deny that Epictetus made Zeus say, first, "I was not able," and
  then, "a part of ourselves." I think the explanation may be this. Epictetus
  had many ways of looking at the Divine Nature. Sometimes he regarded it as
  One, sometimes as Many. When he thought of God as supporting and controlling
  the harmonious Cosmos, or Universe, then God was One&mdash;the Monarch or
  General to whom we all owed loyal obedience. Often, however, "Gods" were
  spoken of, as in the expression "Father of Gods and men," and elsewhere. Once
  he reproached himself (a lower or imaginary self) for repining against the
  Cosmos because he was lame, almost as if the Cosmos itself were Providence or
  God: "Wretched creature! For the sake of one paltry leg, to impeach the
  Cosmos!" But he went on to call the Cosmos "the Whole of Things." And then he
  called on each man to sacrifice some part of himself (a lame man, for
  example, sacrificing his lame leg to the Universe: "What! Will you not make a
  present of it {<i>i.e.</i> the leg) to the Whole of Things? Let go this leg
  of yours! Yield it up gladly to Him that gave it! What! Will you sulk and
  fret against the ordinances of Zeus, which He&mdash;in concert with the Fates
  present at your birth and spinning the thread for you&mdash;decreed and
  ordained?"</p>

  <p>I remember, too, how once, while professing to represent the doctrines of
  the philosophers in two sections, he spoke, in the first section, of "Him,"
  but in the second, of "Them," thus: "The philosophers say that we must in the
  first place learn this, the existence of <i>God</i>, and that <i>He</i>
  provides for the Universe, and that nothing&mdash;whether deed or purpose or
  thought&mdash;can lie hidden from <i>Him</i>, In the next place [we must
  learn] of what nature <i>They</i> (i.e. the Gods) are. For, of whatever
  nature <i>They</i> may be found to be, he that would fain please Them and
  obey [Them] must needs endeavour (to the best of his ability) to be made like
  unto <i>Them</i>"</p>

  <p>What did he mean by "THEM"? And why did he use THEM directly after HIM? I
  believe he did it deliberately. For in the very next sentence he expressed
  God in a neuter adjective, "If THE DIVINE [BEING] is trustworthy, man also
  must needs be trustworthy." He seemed to me to pass from masculine singular
  to masculine plural and from that to neuter singular, as much as to say,
  "Take notice. I use HIM, THEM, and IT in three consecutive sentences, and all
  about God, to show you that God is not any one of these, but all."</p>

  <p>Similarly, after condemning the attempt of philosophers to please the
  rulers of the earth, he said, "I know whom I must needs please, and submit
  to, and obey&mdash;God <i>and those next to Him.</i>" But then he continued
  in the singular ("<i>He</i> made me at one with myself" and so on). And I
  think I may safely say that I never heard him allow his ideal philosopher or
  Cynic to address God in the plural with "ye" or "you." It was always " thou,"
  as in the utterance I quoted above&mdash;" Thine were they all and thou
  gavest them to me."</p>

  <p>Well, then, whom did he mean by "those next to" God? I think he referred
  to certain guardian angels&mdash;"daemons" he called them, and so will I,
  spelling it thus, so as to distinguish it from "demon" meaning
  "devil"&mdash;one of whom (he said) was allotted by God to each human being.
  This, according to Epictetus, did not exclude the general inspection of
  mankind by God Himself: "To each He has assigned a Guardian, the Daemon of
  each mortal, to be his guard and keeper, sleepless and undeceivable.
  Therefore, whenever you shut your doors and make darkness in the house,
  remember never to say that you are alone. For you are not alone. God is in
  the house, and your Daemon is in the house. And what need have these of light
  to see what you are doing?"</p>

  <p>This guardian Daemon, or daemonic Guardian, was said by some of our
  fellow-scholars to be the portion of the divine Logos within us, in virtue of
  which our Teacher distinguished men from beasts. Notably did he once make
  this distinction&mdash;in answer to some imaginary questioner, who was
  supposed to class man with irrational animals because he is subject to animal
  necessities. "Cattle," replied Epictetus, "are works of God, but not
  preeminent, and certainly not parts of God; but thou"&mdash;turning to the
  supposed opponent&mdash;"art a fragment broken off from God; thou hast in
  thyself a part of Him. Why then ignore thy noble birth? Why dost thou not
  recognise whence thou hast come? Wilt thou not remember, in the moment of
  eating, what a Being thou art&mdash;thou that eatest&mdash;what a Being it is
  that thou feedest? Wilt thou not recognise what it is that employs thy senses
  and thy faculties? Knowest thou not that thou art feeding God, yea, taking
  God with thee to the gymnasium? God, God dost thou carry about, thou
  miserable creature, and thou knowest it not!"</p>

  <p>We were rather startled at this. In what sense could a miserable creature
  "carry about God"? Epictetus proceeded, "Dost thou fancy that I am speaking
  of a god of gold or silver, an outside thing? It is within thyself that thou
  carriest Him. And thou perceivest not that thou art defiling Him with impure
  purposes and filthy actions! Before the face of a mere statue of the God thou
  wouldst not dare to do any of the deeds thou art daily doing. Yet in the
  presence of the God Himself, within thee, looking at all thy acts, listening
  to all thy words and thoughts, thou art not ashamed to continue thinking the
  same bad thoughts and doing the same bad deeds&mdash;blind to thine own
  nature and banned by God's wrath!"</p>

  <p>From this it appeared that the Daemon in each man was good and veritably
  God, and turned men towards God and goodness; but that some did not perceive
  the presence and were deaf to the voice. These were "miserable wretches" and
  "banned by God's wrath." Thus in some sense, the same God seemed to be the
  cause of virtue in some but of vice in others. This accorded with a saying of
  Epictetus on another occasion that God "ordained that there should be summer
  and winter, fruitfulness and fruitlessness, <i>virtue and vice</i>." Then the
  question arose, To how many did the Logos of God bring virtue and to how many
  did it result in vice? And again, Did it bring virtue to as many as the Logos
  of God, or God, desired? Or was He unable to fulfil His desire, as in the
  case of that imaginary opponent, for example, so that the Supreme would have
  to say to him, as to Epictetus, "If I could have, I would have. But now, make
  no mistake. I could not bring virtue unto thee." I was disposed to think that
  Epictetus would have laid the blame on the opponent, who, he would have said,
  might have obeyed the Logos in himself, if he had chosen to do so. According
  to our Teacher's doctrine, God would say to this man nothing more cruel, or
  less just, than He says to all, "I could not force virtue on thee, nor on any
  man. If I forced virtue on thee, virtue would cease to be virtue and God
  would cease to be God." But still the uneasy feeling came to me&mdash;not
  indeed at the time of this lecture (or at least not to any great extent) but
  afterwards&mdash;that the God of Epictetus was hampered by what Epictetus
  called "the clay," which He "would have liked" to make immortal, if He "had
  been able." What if each man's "clay" was different? Who made the clay? What
  if God controlled nothing more than the shaping of the clay, and this, too,
  only in conjunction with the Fates? What if the Fates alone were responsible
  for the making of the clay? In that case, must not the Fates be regarded as
  higher Beings, even above the Maker of the Cosmos&mdash;higher in some sense,
  but bad Beings or weak Beings, spoiling the Maker's work by supplying Him
  with bad material so that He could not do what He would have liked to have
  done?</p>

  <p>Epictetus, I subsequently found, would never see difficulties of this
  kind. He represented the Supreme as a great stage manager, allotting to all
  their appropriate parts: "Thou art the sun; go on thy rounds, minister to all
  things. Thou art a heifer; when the lion appears, play thy part, or suffer
  for it. Thou art a bull; fight as champion of the herd. Thou canst lead the
  host against Ilium; be thou Agamemnon. Thou canst cope with Hector; be thou
  Achilles." He did not add, "Thou canst spit venom and slander against the
  good and great; be thou Thersites." But I did not think of that at the
  time.</p>

  <p>For the moment, I was carried away by the fervour of the speaker. "He," I
  said, "has been a slave, the slave of Nero's freedman; he has seen things at
  their worst; and yet he believes that virtue, freedom, and peace, are placed
  by God in the power of all that will obey the Logos, His gift, within their
  hearts!" So I believed it, or persuaded myself that I believed it. Epictetus
  insisted, in the strongest terms, that the divine Providence extends to all.
  "God," he said, "does not neglect a single one, even of the least of His
  creatures." Stimulating us to <i>be</i> good instead of <i>talking</i> about
  being good, he exclaimed, "How grand it is for each of you to be able to say,
  <i>The very thing that people are solemnly arguing about in the schools as an
  impossible ideal, that very thing I am accomplishing. They are, in effect,
  expatiating on my virtues, investigating me, and singing my praises. Zeus has
  been pleased that I should receive from my own self a demonstration of the
  truth of this ideal, while He Himself tests and tries me to see whether I am
  a worthy soldier of His army, and a worthy citizen of His city. At the same
  time it has been His pleasure to bring me forward that I may testify
  concerning the things that lie outside the will, and that I may cry aloud to
  the world, 'Behold, men, that your fears are idle! Vain, all vain, are your
  greedy and covetous desires. Seek not the Good in the outside world! Seek it
  in yourselves! Else, ye will not find it.' Engaging me for such a mission,
  and for such a testimony as this, God now leads me hither, now sends me
  thither; exhibits me to mankind in poverty, in disease&mdash;ruler in fact
  but no ruler in the eyes of men&mdash;banishes me to the rocks of Gyara, or
  drags me into prison or into bonds! And all this, not hating me. No, God
  forbid! Who can hate his own best and most faithful servant? No, nor
  neglecting me. How could He? For He does not neglect the meanest of His
  creatures. No, He is training and practising me. He is employing me as His
  witness to the rest of mankind. And I, being set down by Him for such high
  service as this&mdash;can I possibly find time to entertain anxieties about
  where I am, or with whom I am living, or what men say about me? How can I
  fail to be, with my whole might and my whole being, intent on God, and on His
  commandments and ordinances?</i>"</p>

  <p>I noted with pleasure here the words, "He does not neglect the meanest of
  His creatures." To the same effect elsewhere, speaking of Zeus, he said, "In
  very truth, the universal frame of things is badly managed unless Zeus takes
  care of all His own citizens, in order that they may be blessed like unto
  Himself" A little before this, he said about Hercules, "He left his children
  behind him without a groan or regret&mdash;not as though he were leaving them
  orphans, for he knew that no man is an orphan," because Zeus is "Father of
  men."</p>

  <p>In all these passages describing the fatherhood of God and the sonship of
  man, Epictetus spoke of virtue as being, by itself, a sufficient reward, in
  respect of the ineffable peace that it brings through the consciousness of
  being united to God. But how long this union lasted, and whether its
  durability was proof against death&mdash;as Socrates taught&mdash;about this
  he had hitherto said nothing. The Cynic, he again and again insisted, was
  God's son; but he did not insist that the son was as immortal as the Father.
  Sometimes indeed he described the man of temperance and self-control as
  "banqueting at the table of the Gods." Still more, the man that had passed
  beyond temperance into contempt of earthly things&mdash;a rank to which
  Arrian and I did not aspire&mdash;such a Cynic as this he extolled as being
  not only fellow-guest with the Gods but also fellow-ruler. These expressions
  reminded me of what we used to learn by heart in Rome concerning the man
  described by Horace as "just and firm of purpose." The poet likened him to
  Hercules transported aloft to the fiery citadel of heaven, and to the Emperor
  Augustus drinking nectar at the table of the Gods. But this was said about
  Augustus while he was still alive; and the poem did not seem to me to prove
  that Horace believed in the immortality of the soul. However, what Epictetus
  said about that will appear hereafter. For the present, I must explain why
  the teaching of Epictetus concerning the Gods, although it carried me away
  for a time, caused me bewilderment in the end, and made me feel the need of
  something beyond.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">III. &mdash; ARRIAN ON THE OATH OF THE CHRISTIANS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">UP to the time of my coming to Nicopolis, my faith in the
  Gods had been like that of most official and educated Romans. First I had a
  literary belief not only in Zeus but also in Apollo, Athene, Demeter, and the
  rest of the Gods and Goddesses of Homer, tempered by a philosophic feeling
  that some of the Homeric and other myths about them, and about the less
  beautiful divinities, were not true, or were true only as allegories. In the
  next place I had a Roman or official belief in the destiny of the empire, and
  a recognition that its unity was best maintained by tolerating the worships
  of any number of national Gods and Goddesses; provided they did not tend to
  sedition and conspiracy, nor to such vices as were in contravention of the
  laws. Lastly, I recognised as the belief of many philosophers&mdash;and was
  myself half inclined to believe&mdash;that One God, or Zeus, so controlled
  the whole of things that it would hardly be atheistic if I sometimes regarded
  even Apollo, and Athene, and others, as personifying God's attributes rather
  than as being Gods and Goddesses in themselves&mdash;although I myself,
  without scruple and in all willingness, should have offEred them both worship
  and sacrifice. Personally, apart (I think) from the influences of childhood,
  I always shrank from definitely believing that the One God ever had been, or
  ever could be, "alone."</p>

  <p>It was with these confused opinions or feelings that I became a pupil of
  Epictetus. And at first, whatever he asserted about God, or the Gods, he made
  me believe it&mdash;as long as he was speaking. When he said "God," or
  "Zeus," or "Father," or "HIM," or "THEM," or "Providence," or "The Divine
  Being," or "The Nature of All Things," or whatever else, he dragged me as it
  were to the new Name, and made me follow as a captive and do it homage. But
  afterwards there came a reaction. The limbs of my mind, so to speak, became
  tired of being dragged. I longed for rest and found none. My homage, too, was
  dissipated by distraction. When he repeated as he often did&mdash;addressing
  each one of us individually, and therefore (I assumed) me among the
  rest&mdash;"Thou earnest about God," he seemed to say to me, "Look within
  thyself for Him whom thou must worship." That was not helpful, it was the
  reverse of helpful&mdash;at least, to me. I felt vaguely then (and now as a
  Christian I know) that men have need not only to look within, but also (and
  much more) to look up&mdash;up to the Father in heaven with the aid of His
  Spirit on earth. It was due to Epictetus that at this time I&mdash;however
  faintly&mdash;began to feel this need.</p>

  <p>Epictetus seemed to have no consistent view either of the unity of God or
  of the possibility of plural Gods. In Rome, we have three altars to the
  Goddess Febris, or Fever. Epictetus once referred to Febris in the reply of a
  philosopher to a tyrant. The latter says, "I have power to cut off your
  head"; the former replies, "You are in the right. I quite forgot that I must
  pay you homage as people do to Fever and Cholera, and erect an altar to you,
  <i>as indeed in Rome there is an altar to Fever</i>." It was hardly possible
  to mistake the Master's mockery of this worship. On the other hand, he was
  bitterly sarcastic against those who denied the existence of Demeter, the
  Koré her daughter, and Pluto the husband of the Koré. These deities our
  Master regarded as representing bread. "O, the gratitude," he exclaimed,
  "0,the reverence of these creatures! Day by day they eat bread; and yet they
  have the face to say 'We do not know whether there is any such a being as
  Demeter, or the Koré, or Pluto!' "It never seemed to occur to him that the
  worshippers of Febris might retort on him, "Day by day scores of people in
  Rome have the fever, and yet you have the face to say to us Romans, 'I do not
  know whether there is any such a being as Febris or Cholera!'"</p>

  <p>I think he never spoke of Poseidon, Ares, or Aphrodite, and hardly ever of
  Apollo. Even Athene he mentioned only thrice in Arrian's hearing (so he told
  me), twice speaking of her statue by Phidias, and once representing Zeus as
  bemoaning His solitude (according to some notion, which he ridiculed) after a
  universal conflagration of gods and men and things, "Miserable me! I have
  neither Hera, nor Athene, nor Apollo!" It was for Zeus alone, as God, that
  our Teacher reserved his devotion. And for Him he displayed a passionate
  enthusiasm, the absolute sincerity of which it never entered into my mind to
  question; nor do I question it now. Under this God he served as a soldier, or
  lived as a citizen. To this God he testified as a witness that others might
  believe and worship. In this view of human life&mdash;as being a testimony to
  God&mdash;his teaching was most convincing to me, even when I felt, as I
  always did, that something was wanting in any conception of God that regarded
  Him as ever being "alone."</p>

  <p>Now I pass to another matter, not of great interest to me at the time, but
  of great importance to me in its results, because it led to my first
  knowledge&mdash;that could be called knowledge&mdash;of the followers of the
  Lord Jesus Christ. It arose from a passage in the lecture I described in my
  last chapter. Epictetus was speaking about "the whole frame of things" as
  being a kind of fluid, in which the thrill of one portion affects all the
  rest, and about God and the Guardian Daemon as feeling our every motion and
  thought. He concluded by calling on us to take an oath&mdash;a military oath,
  or <i>sacramentum</i>, as we call it in Latin&mdash;such as soldiers take to
  the Emperor. "They," he said, " taking on themselves the life of service for
  pay, swear to prefer above all things the safety of Caesar. You, who have
  been counted worthy of such vast gifts, will you not likewise swear, and,
  after taking your oath, abide by it? And what shall the oath be? Never to
  disobey, never to accuse, never to find fault with any of the gifts that have
  been given by Him; never to do reluctantly, never to suffer reluctantly,
  anything that may be necessary. This oath is like theirs&mdash;after a
  fashion. The soldiers of Caesar swear not to prefer another to him; God's
  soldiers swear to prefer themselves to everything."</p>

  <p>On me this came somewhat as bathos. But it was a frequent paradox with
  him; and of course, in one sense, it was not a paradox but common sense. What
  he meant by bidding us "prefer <i>ourselves</i>" was "prefer <i>virtue</i>"
  which he always described as each man's true "profit." Everyone, he said,
  must prefer his own "profit" to everything else, even to father, brothers,
  children, wife. Zeus Himself&mdash;so he taught&mdash;prefers His own "profit
  "&mdash;which consists in being Father of all. Take away this thin veil of
  apparent egotism, and the oath might be described as an oath to live and die
  for righteousness, for the Logos, or Word of God within us, and, thus, for
  God Himself. But why, I thought, disguise loyalty under the mask of
  self-seeking? This notion of a military oath taken to God, and at the same
  time to oneself&mdash;and an oath, so to speak, of negative allegiance, not
  to do this or that&mdash;did not inspire me with the same enthusiasm as the
  more positive doctrine and the picture of the wandering Cynic going about the
  world and actively doing good and destroying evil.</p>

  <p>Arrian, however, was taking down this passage about the military oath with
  even more than his usual earnestness and rapidity. "Did that impress you?"
  said I, as we left the lecture-room together. "On me it fell a little flat."
  He did not answer at once. Presently, as if rousing himself from a reverie,
  "Forgive me," he said, "I was thinking of something that occurred in our
  neighbourhood about fifteen years ago. You know I was born in Bithynia. Well,
  about that time,, there was a great outbreak of that Jewish superstition of
  which you must often have heard in Rome, practised by the followers of
  Christus. They are suspected of all sorts of horrible crimes and
  abominations, as you know, I dare say, better than I do, being familiar with
  what the common people say about them in Rome. Moreover the new work just
  published by your Tacitus&mdash;a lover of truth if any man is&mdash;severely
  condemns them. I am bound to say our Governor did not think so badly of them
  as Tacitus does. Perhaps in Rome and in Nero's time they were more savage and
  vicious than among us in Bithynia recently. However, that matters little. The
  question was not about their private vices or virtues. Our Governor believed
  them guilty of treasonable conspiracy. So he determined to stop it.</p>

  <p>"Stop it he did; or, at all events, to a very great extent. But the point
  of interest for me is, that when these fellows were had up before our
  Governor&mdash;it was Caius Plinius Caecilius Secundus, an intimate friend of
  the Emperor Trajan&mdash;he found there was really no mischief at all to be
  apprehended from them. Secundus had heard something about a sacramentum, or
  military oath&mdash;and this is my point&mdash;which these people were in the
  habit of taking at their secret meetings. Naturally this convinced him at
  first that there must be something wrong. But, when he came to look into it,
  the whole thing came to no more than what I will now tell you. I am sure of
  my facts for I heard them from his secretary, who had a copy of his letter to
  the Emperor. It was to this effect, <i>'They affirm that the sum total of
  their crime or error is, that they were wont, on an appointed day, to meet
  together before daybreak and to sing an alternate chant to Christus, as to a
  God, and to bind themselves by an oath&mdash;not, as conspirators do, to
  commit some crime in common, but to avoid committing theft, robbery,
  adultery, fraud, breach of faith. This done, they break up. It is true they
  return to take food in common, but it is a mere harmless repast.'</i> After
  the Governor had gone carefully into the matter, putting a few women to the
  torture to get at the truth, he came to the conclusion that this so-called
  military oath, or sacramentum, had no harm whatever in it. The thing was
  merely a perverted superstition run wild. He very sensibly adopted the mild
  course of giving the poor deluded people a chance of denying their faith as
  they called it. The Emperor sanctioned his mildness. Most of them recanted.
  Things settled down, and promised to be very much as they were before. At
  least so the Governor thought. We, outside the palace, were not quite so
  sanguine. But anyhow, what struck me to-day was the similarity between the
  military oath of these Christians and the military oath prescribed by our
  great Teacher to his Cynics."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "does it not seem to you that our military oath ought to be
  a positive one, namely, that we Cynics will go anywhere and do anything that
  the General may command&mdash;and not a negative one, that we will abstain
  from grumbling against His orders?" Arrian replied, "As to that, I think our
  Master follows Socrates, who expressly says that he had indeed a daemon, or
  at all events a daemonic voice; but that it told him only what to avoid, not
  what to do." "Surely," replied I, "what Socrates said on his trial was, 'How
  could I be fairly described as introducing new daemons when saying that <i>a
  voice of God manifestly points out to me what I ought to do?</i>'" "I do not
  remember that," said my friend, "but we are near my rooms. Come in and let us
  look into Plato's Apologia."</p>

  <p>So we went in, and Arrian took out of his book-case Plato's account of the
  Speech of Socrates before the jury that condemned him to death. "There,
  Silanus," said he, "you see I was right," And he pointed to these words,
  "There comes to me, as you have often heard me say, a divine and daemonic
  something, which indeed my prosecutor Meletus mentioned and burlesqued in his
  written indictment. This thing, in its commencement, dates back (I believe)
  from my boyhood, a kind of Voice that comes to me from time to time, and,
  whenever it comes, it always"&mdash;"Mark this," said Arrian&mdash;<i>"turns
  me back from doing that (whatever it may be) which I am purposing to do, but
  never moves me forward."</i></p>

  <p>I seemed fairly and fully confuted. But suddenly it occurred to me to ask
  my friend to let me see Xenophon's version of the same speech. He brought it
  out. I was not long before I disinterred the very words that I have quoted
  above&mdash;<i>"a Voice of God that manifestly points out to me what I ought
  to do."</i> And the context, too, indicated that the Voice&mdash;which he
  calls <i>daemonic</i>, or a <i>daemonion</i>&mdash;gave positive directions,
  recognised as such by his friends.</p>

  <p>This very important difference between Plato and Xenophon in regard to the
  daemon of Socrates, as described by Socrates, himself, interested Arrian not
  a little. "Come back," he said, "in the evening, when I shall have finished
  reducing my notes, to writing, and let us put the two versions side by side
  and see how many passages we can find agreeing." So I came back after sunset,
  and we sat down and went carefully through them.</p>

  <p>And, as far as I remember, we could not find these two great biographers
  of this great man agreeing in so much as a dozen consecutive words in their
  several records of his Apologia, his only public speech.
  Presently&mdash;Arrian having Xenophon in his hand and I Plato&mdash;I read
  out the well-known words of Socrates about Anytus and Meletus, his accusers,
  and about their power to kill him but not to hurt him. "What," said I, "is
  Xenophon's version of this?" "He omits it altogether," replied Arrian; "but I
  see, reading on, that he puts into the mouth of Socrates an entirely
  different saying about Anytus, after the condemnation. Let me see the Plato."
  Taking it from my hand, he observed, "Our Master, Epictetus, who is
  continually quoting these words of Plato's, never quotes them exactly.
  'Anytus and Meletus may kill me but they cannot hurt me'&mdash;that is always
  his condensed version. But you see it is not Plato's, Plato's is much
  longer."</p>

  <p>So the conversation strayed away in a literary direction. We talked a
  great deal&mdash;without much knowledge, at least on my part&mdash;about oral
  tradition. I remarked on the possibilities in it of astonishing divergences
  and distortions of doctrine&mdash;" unless," said I, as I rose up to go, "it
  happens by good fortune, to be taken down at the time by an honest fellow
  like you, who loves his teacher, but loves the truth more, so that he just
  sets down what he hears, as he hears it." "I do my best," said Arrian; "but
  if it were not nearly midnight, I could show you that even my best is not
  always good enough. I suspect that such sayings of our Master as become most
  current will be very variously reported a hundred years hence."</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said I, and was opening the door to depart, when it flashed
  upon me that all this time, although we had been discussing Socrates, and
  assuming a resemblance between him and our Master, we had said nothing about
  that great doctrine in the profession of which Socrates breathed his
  last&mdash;prescribing a sacrifice to Aesculapius as though death were the
  beginning of a higher life&mdash;I mean the immortality of the soul. "I will
  not stay now," said I, "but we have not said a word about Epictetus's
  doctrine concerning the immortality of the soul; could you lend me some of
  your notes about it?" "He seldom speaks of it," replied my friend; "when he
  does, it is not always easy to distinguish between metaphor and not-metaphor.
  My notes, so far, do not quite satisfy me that I have done him justice. He is
  likely to touch on it in the next lecture or soon after. I should prefer you
  to hear for yourself what he says."</p>

  <p>"One more question," said I. "Did our Master ever, in your hearing, refer
  to that last strange saying of Socrates, 'We owe a cock to Aesculapius'?
  Sometimes it seems to me the finest epigram in all Greek literature."
  "Never," replied Arrian. "He has never mentioned it either in my hearing, or
  in the hearing of those whom I have asked about it. And I have asked
  many."</p>

  <p>Departing home I found myself almost at once forgetting our long literary
  discussion about oral tradition, in the larger and deeper question touched on
  in the last few minutes. Why should not Arrian have been able to "do justice"
  to Epictetus in this particular subject? Was it that our Teacher did not
  quite "do justice" to himself? Then I began to ask what Epictetus had meant
  precisely by such expressions as that men may become "fellow-banqueters" and
  even "fellow-rulers" with "the Gods." "If God Himself is immortal, how," said
  I, "can 'God's own son' fail to be immortal also?"</p>

  <p>All through that night, even till near dawn, I was harassed with wild and
  wearying dreams. I travelled, wandering through wilderness after wilderness
  in quest of Socrates and nowhere finding him. Wherever I went I seemed to
  hear a strange monotonous cry that followed close behind me. Presently I
  heard a flapping of wings, and I knew that the sound was the crowing of the
  cock that was to be offered for Socrates to Aesculapius. Then it became a
  mocking, inarticulate, human voice striving to utter articulate speech. At
  last I heard distinctly, "If Zeus could have, he would have. If he could
  have, he would have. But he could not."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">IV. &mdash; SCAURUS ON EPICTETUS AND PAUL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE cock was still crowing when I started out of my dream.
  It was not yet dawn but sleep was impossible. When Arrian called to accompany
  me to lecture, he found me in a fever and sent in a physician, by whose
  advice I stayed indoors for two or three days. During this enforced inaction,
  I resolved to write to my old friend Scaurus. Marcus Aemilius
  Scaurus&mdash;for that was his name in full&mdash;had been a friend of my
  father's, years before I was born; and his advice had been largely the cause
  of my coming to Nicopolis. Scaurus had seen service; but for many years past
  he had devoted himself wholly to literature, not as a rhetorician, nor as a
  lover of the poets, but as "a practical historian," so he called it. By this
  he meant to distinguish himself from what he called "ornamental historians."
  "History," he used to say, "contains truth in a well; and I like trying to
  draw it out."</p>

  <p>For a man of nearly seventy, Scaurus was remarkably vigorous in mind and
  thought, with large stores of observation and learning, of a sort not common
  among Romans of good birth. His favourite motto was, "Quick to perceive, slow
  to believe." I used to think he erred on the side of believing too little,
  and his friends used to call him Miso-mythus or "Myth-hater." But over and
  over again, when I had ventured to discuss with him a matter of documentary
  evidence, I had found that his incredulity was justified; so that I had come
  to admit that there was some force in his protest, that he ought to be
  called, not "Myth-hater," but "Truth-lover."</p>

  <p>In the year after my father's death, when I was wasting my time in Rome,
  and in danger of doing worse, Scaurus took me to task as befitted my father's
  dearest friend&mdash;a cousin also of my mother, who had died while I was
  still an infant. He had long desired me to enter the army, and I should have
  done so but for illness. Now that my health was almost restored, he returned
  to his previous advice, but suggested that, for the present, I might spend a
  month or two with advantage in attending the lectures of Epictetus, of whom
  he knew something while he was in Rome, and about whom he had heard a good
  deal since. When I demurred, and told him that I had heard a good many
  philosophers and did not care for them, he replied, "Epictetus you will not
  find a common philosopher." He pressed me and I yielded.</p>

  <p>Since my coming to Nicopolis, I had written once to tell him of my
  arrival, and to thank him for advising me to come to so admirable a teacher.
  But I had been too much absorbed in the teaching to enter into detail. Now,
  having leisure, and knowing his great interest in such subjects, I wrote to
  him even more fully than I have done for my readers above, sending him all my
  lecture notes; and I asked him what he judged to be the secret of Epictetus,
  which made him so different from other philosophers. Nor did I omit to tell
  him of my talk with Arrian about the Christians and their sacramentum.</p>

  <p>Many days elapsed, and I had been attending lectures again for a long
  time, before his letter in reply reached Nicopolis; but I will set it down
  here, as also a second letter from him on the same subject. In the first,
  Scaurus expressed his satisfaction at my meeting with Arrian (whom he knew
  and described as an extremely sensible and promising young man, likely to get
  on). He added a hope that I would take precisely Arrian's view of the
  advantage to be derived from philosophy. But a large part of his
  letter&mdash;much more than I could have wished&mdash;was occupied with our
  "wonderful discovery" (as he called it) that Plato and Xenophon disagreed in
  their versions of the Apologia of Socrates. On this he rallied us as mere
  babes in criticism, but, said he, not much more babyish than many professed
  critics, who cannot be made to understand that&mdash;outside poetry, and
  traditions learned by rote, and a few "aculeate sayings" (so he called them)
  of philosophers and great men&mdash;no two historians ever agree
  independently&mdash;he laid stress on <i>"independently"</i>&mdash;for twenty
  consecutive words, in recording a speech or dialogue. "I will not lay you a
  wager," said he, "for it would be cheating you. But I will make you an offer.
  If you and Arrian, between you, can find twenty identical consecutive words
  of Socrates in the whole of Xenophon's Memorabilia and Plato's Dialogues, I
  will give you five hundred sesterces apiece.* Your failure (for fail you
  will) ought to strike you as all the more remarkable because both Plato and
  Xenophon tell us that Socrates used to describe himself as <i>'always saying
  the same things about the same subjects.'</i> That one similar saying they
  have preserved. For the rest, these two great biographers, writing page upon
  page of Socratic talk, cannot agree exactly about <i>'the same things'</i>
  for a score of consecutive words!"</p>

  <p class="footnote">[ *In "Notes on Silanus," 2809a, the author repeats this
  offer. ]</p>

  <p>He added more, not of great interest to me, about the credulity of those
  who persuaded themselves that Xenophon's version must be spurious just
  because it differed from Plato's, whereas, said he, this very difference went
  to show that it was genuine, and that Xenophon was tacitly correcting Plato.
  But concerning the secret of Epictetus he said very little&mdash;and that,
  merely in reference to the <i>sacramentum</i> of the Christians which I
  mentioned in my first letter. On this he remarked that Pliny, with whom he
  had been well acquainted, had never mentioned the matter to him. "But that,"
  he said, "is not surprising. His measures to suppress the Christian
  superstition did not prove so successful as he had hoped. Moreover he
  disliked the whole business&mdash;having to deal with mendacious informers on
  one side, and fanatical fools or hysterical women on the other. And I, who
  knew a good deal more about the Christians than Pliny did, disliked the
  subject still more. My conviction is, however, that your excellent
  Epictetus&mdash;rationalist though he is now, and even less prone to belief
  than Socrates&mdash;'has not been always unscathed by that same Christian
  infection (for that is the right name for it).</p>

  <p>"Partly, he sympathizes with the Christian hatred or contempt for 'the
  powers of this world' (to use their phrase) and partly with their allegiance
  to one God, whom he and they regard as casting down kings and setting up
  philosophers. But there is this gulf between them. The Christians think of
  their champion, Christus, as having devoted himself to death for their sake,
  and then as having been miraculously raised from the dead, and as, even now,
  present among them whenever they choose to meet together and 'sing hymns to
  him as to a God.' Epictetus absolutely disbelieves this. Hence, he is at a
  great disadvantage&mdash;I mean, of course, as a preacher, not as a
  philosopher. The Christians have their God, standing in the midst of their
  daily assemblies, before whom they can 'corybantize'&mdash;to repeat your
  expression&mdash;to their hearts' content. Your teacher has
  nothing&mdash;nay, worse than nothing, for he has a blank and feels it to be
  a blank.</p>

  <p>"What does he do then? He fills the blank with a Hercules or a Diogenes or
  a Socrates, and he corybantizes before that. But it is a make-believe, though
  an honest one. I have said more than I intended. You know how I ramble on
  paper. And the habit is growing on me. Let no casual word of mine make you
  doubt that Epictetus is thoroughly honest. But honest men may be deceived. Be
  'quick in perceiving, slow in believing.' Keep to Arrian's view of a useful
  and practical life in the world, the world as it is, not as it might be in
  Plato's Republic&mdash;which, by the way, would be a very dull place.
  Farewell."</p>

  <p>This letter did not satisfy me at all. "Honest men," I repeated, "may be
  deceived." True, and Scaurus, though honest as the day, is no exception. To
  think that Epictetus, our Epictetus&mdash;for so Arrian and I used to call
  him&mdash;had been even for a time under the spell of such a superstition as
  this! I had always assumed&mdash;and my conversation with Arrian about what
  seemed exceptional experiences in Bithynia had done little to shake my
  assumption&mdash;that the Christians were a vile Jewish sect, morose,
  debased, given up to monstrous secret vices, hostile to the Empire, and
  hateful to Gods and men. What was the ground for connecting Epictetus with
  them? Contempt for rulers? That was no new thing in philosophers. Many of
  them had despised kings, or affected to despise them, without any intention
  of rebelling against them. What though Epictetus suggested, in a hyperbolical
  or metaphorical way, a religious <i>sacramentum</i> for philosophers? This
  was quite different from that of the Christians as mentioned by Arrian. I
  could not help feeling that, for once, my old friend had "perceived" little
  and "believed" much.</p>

  <p>Perhaps my reply showed traces of this feeling. At all events, Scaurus
  wrote back, asking whether I had observed in him "a habit of basing
  conclusions on slight grounds." Then he continued "I told you that I knew a
  good deal about the Christians. I also know a great deal more about Epictetus
  than you suppose. When I was a young man, I attended the lectures of that
  most admirable of philosophers, Musonius Rufus. About the time when I left,
  Epictetus, then a slave, was brought to the classes by his master,
  Epaphroditus; and Rufus, whom I shall always regard with respect and
  affection, spoke to me about his new pupil in the highest terms. Afterwards
  he often told me how he tried to arm the poor boy with philosophy against
  what he would have to endure from such a master. Many a time have I thought
  that the young philosopher must have needed all his Stoic armour, going home
  from the lecture-room of Rufus to the palace of Nero's freedman.</p>

  <p>"But I also remember seeing him long before that, when he came one morning
  as a mere child not twelve years old, along with Epaphroditus, to Nero's
  Palace. I was then about fourteen or fifteen. After we had left the
  Palace&mdash;my father and I&mdash;we came upon him again on that same
  evening, staring at some Christians, smeared with pitch and burning away like
  so many flaring torches, to light the Imperial Gardens&mdash;one of Nero's
  insane or bestial freaks! I have never been able to forget the sight, and I
  have often thought that he could never forget it. Somewhere about that time,
  one of the Christian ringleaders, Paulus by name, was put to death. As
  happens in such cases, his people began to collect every scrap of his
  writings that could be found A little volume of them came into my hands some
  twenty years ago. But long before that date, all through the period when
  Epictetus was in Rufus's classes, the Christian slaves in Rome had in their
  hands the letters of this Paulus or Paul. One of them, the longest, written
  to the Christians in Rome (a few years before Paul was brought to the City as
  a prisoner) goes back as far as sixty years ago. Some are still earlier. I
  saw the volume more than once in Caesar's Palace in the days of Vespasian.
  This Paul was one of the most practical of men, and his letters are steeped
  in practical experience. Epictetus, besides being a great devourer of
  literature in general, devoured in particular everything that bore on
  practical life. The odds are great that he would have come across the book
  somewhere among his slave or freedman friends.</p>

  <p>"But I do not trust to such mere antecedent probabilities. You must know
  that, ever since Epictetus set up as a philosopher, I have followed his
  career with interest. Recluse though I am, I have many friends and
  correspondents. These, from time to time, have furnished me with notes of his
  lectures. Well, when I came to read Paul's letters, I was prepared to find in
  them certain general similarities to Stoic doctrine; for Paul was a man of
  Tarsus and might have picked up these things at the University there. But I
  found a great deal more. I found particularities, just of the sort that you
  find in your lectures. Paul's actual experiences had been exactly those of a
  vagrant Aesculapius or Hercules. Your friend idealizes the wanderings of
  Hercules; Paul enacted them. Paul journeyed from city to city, from continent
  to continent, everywhere turning the world upside down&mdash;Jerusalem,
  Damascus, Antioch, Ephesus, Colossae, Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth,
  Jerusalem again&mdash;last of all, Rome. Everywhere the slaves, the poor, the
  women, went after him. Everywhere he came into collision with the rulers of
  the earth. If he did not proclaim a war between them and his God, he at all
  events implied war.</p>

  <p>"Now this is just what Epictetus would have liked to do. Only he could not
  often get people to take him in the same serious way, because he had not the
  same serious business in hand. I verily believe he was not altogether
  displeased when the Prefect of the City banished him with other philosophers
  of note under Domitian. I know certain philosophers who actually made money
  by being thus banished. It was an advertisement for their lectures. Don't
  imagine that your philosopher made, or wished to make, money. No. But he made
  influence&mdash;which he valued above money.</p>

  <p>"However, the Emperors and Prefects after Domitian were not such fools.
  They knew the difference between a real revolution and a revolution on paper.
  A mere theoretical exaltation of the mind above the body, a mere scholastic
  laudation of kingship over the minds of men as superior to kingship over
  their bodies&mdash;these things kings tolerate; for they mean nothing but
  words. But a revolution in the name of a <i>person</i>&mdash;a person, too,
  supposed by fanatics to be living and present in all their secret
  meetings,'wherever two or three are gathered together,' for that is their
  phrase&mdash;this may mean a great deal. A person, regarded in this way, may
  take hold of men's spirits. Missionaries pretending&mdash;or, still worse,
  believing&mdash;that they are speaking in the name of such a person, may lead
  crowds of silly folk into all sorts of sedition. They may refuse, for
  example, to adore the Emperor's image and to offer sacrifice to the Gods of
  the State; or they might even attempt to subvert the foundations of society
  by withholding taxes, or by encouraging or inculcating some wholesale
  manumission of slaves. This sort of thing means war, and Paul, fifty years
  ago, was actually waging this war. Epictetus longs to be waging it now. As he
  cannot, he takes pleasure in urging his pupils to it, painting an imaginary
  battle array in which he sees imaginary soldiers waging, or destined to wage,
  imaginary conflicts with imaginary enemies,</p>

  <p>"Hence that picturesque contrast (in the lecture you transcribed for me)
  between the unmarried and the married Cynic&mdash;which, besides the
  similarity of thought, contains some curious similarities to the actual words
  of Paul It ran thus, 'The condition of the times being such as it is,
  opposing forces, as it were, being drawn up in line of battle'&mdash;that was
  his expression. Well, what followed from this non-existent, hypothetical,
  imminent conflict? The Philosopher, it seems, must be a soldier,
  <i>'undistracted</i>, wholly devoted to the ministry of God, able to go about
  and visit men, not bound fast to private personal duties, not
  <i>entangled</i> in conditions of life that he cannot honourably transgress.'
  And then he describes at great length a married Cynic dragged down from his
  royal throne by the claims and encumbrances of a nursery. Now this same
  'undistractedness' (using the very word) of unmarried life Paul himself has
  mentioned in a letter to the Corinthians, where he says that 'owing to the
  pressing necessity' of the times, it was good for a man to be unmarried, and
  that he wished them to be 'free from anxiety.' He concludes 'But I speak this
  for your own profit, not that I may cast a noose round you but that you may
  with all seemliness attend on the Lord <i>undistractedly</i>.' Again, he
  writes to one of his assistants or subalterns, 'Endure hardship with me as a
  good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one engaged in a campaign is
  <i>entangled</i>'&mdash;your friend's word again&mdash;'in the affairs of
  civil life.'</p>

  <p>"I lay little stress on the similarity of word, but a great deal on the
  similarity of thought. There is no such conflict as Epictetus describes.
  There is no such line of battle '&mdash;not at least for us, Romans, or for
  you, Cynics. <i>But there is for the Christians</i>&mdash;arrayed as they are
  against the authorities of the Empire. And that reminds me of your Epictetian
  antithesis between 'the Beast' and 'the Man.' It is a little like a Christian
  tradition about 'the Beast.' By 'the Beast' they mean Nero. They have never
  forgotten his treatment of them after the fire. For a long time after his
  death they had a notion&mdash;I believe some of them have it still&mdash;that
  the Beast may rise from the dead and persecute them again. They also
  expect&mdash;I cannot do more than allude to their fantastic dreams&mdash;a
  sort of 'Son of Man' to appear on the clouds taking vengeance on the armies
  of the Beast. So, you see, they, too, recognise an opposition between the Man
  and the Beast. Only, with the Christians it is of a date much earlier than
  Epictetus. It goes back to a Jewish tradition, which represents a sort of
  opposition between the empires of Beasts and the empire of the Son of Man, in
  a prophet named Daniel, some centuries ago.</p>

  <p>"Epictetus, of course, does not believe in all this. But still he
  persuades himself that there is such a line of battle' in the air, and that
  he and his followers can take part in this aerial conflict by 'going about
  the world' as spiritually armed warriors, making themselves substantially
  miserable&mdash;or what the world would call such&mdash;while championing the
  cause of unsubstantial good against evil. All that you wrote to me about the
  missionary life and its hardships&mdash;its destitution, homelessness,
  nakedness, yes, even the extraordinary phrase you added from Arrian's notes
  about the cudgelled Cynic, how he 'must be cudgelled like a donkey, and, in
  the act of being cudgelled, must love his cudgellers as being the father of
  all and brother of all'&mdash;all this I could match, in a compressed form,
  from a passage in my little Pauline volume. Here it is: '<i>For I think that
  God has made a show of us Missionaries</i>'&mdash;Missionaries, or Apostles,
  that is their name for their wandering Aesculapii&mdash;'<i>like condemned
  criminals in the arena. We have been made a theatre-show to the universe, to
  angels and men...&mdash;up to this very moment, hungering, thirsting, naked,
  buffeted, driven from place to place, toiling and labouring with our own
  hands. Reviled, we bless; persecuted, we endure. Men imprecate evil on us, we
  exhort them to their good. We have been made as the refuse of the universe,
  the offscouring of all, up to this very moment</i>.'</p>

  <p>"Again, elsewhere, Paul brings in that same Epictetian contrast between
  the external misery and the internal joy of the Missionary: '<i>Never
  needlessly offending to anyone in anything, lest the Service</i>&mdash;which
  your philosopher calls 'the service of God'&mdash;<i>be reproached, but in
  everything commending ourselves as the Servants of God, in much endurance, in
  tribulations, in necessities, in hardships, in scourgings, in prisons, in
  tumults, in toils, in watchings, in fastings.</i>' Now comes the contrast,
  indicating that all these things are superficial trifles, the petty
  pin-pricks inflicted by the spite of the contemptible world, but underneath
  lie the solid realities:&mdash;'<i>in parity, in knowledge, in longsuffering,
  in kindness and goodness, in the holy spirit, in love unfeigned, in the word
  of truth, in the power of God.</i>'</p>

  <p>"This leads Paul to the thought of the armour of God, and the friends and
  enemies of God, the good and the evil, which this wandering Christian
  Hercules has to deal with: '<i>By the arms of righteousness, on the right
  hand and on the left; by glory and dishonour; by ill report and good
  report</i>&mdash; he means, I think, 'glory in the sight of God, dishonour in
  the sight of men,' and again, 'ill report on earth, good report in heaven.'
  And so he continues, '<i>as knaves and true...</i>'&mdash;that is, 'knaves in
  appearance, in the world's false judgment, but true men in the sight of Him
  who judges truly.' It is a marvel of compression. And it is kept up in what
  follows:&mdash;'<i>misunderstood</i> [<i>i.e.</i> by men] <i>and well
  understood</i> [<i>i.e.</i> by God); dying, and behold we live; under the
  headsman's scourge, yet not beheaded; grieving, but always rejoicing;
  beggars, but making many rich; having nothing, yet having all things for
  ever!'</p>

  <p>"You will be tired of this. But your zeal for your new teacher brought it
  on you. You admire his 'fervour.' Then what do you think of this man's
  fervour? He could give points to Epictetus both for fervour and for
  compression. I admit that Paul has not your master's dramatic flash, irony,
  and epigrammatic twist. But, as for 'fervour,' here, I contend, is the
  original Falernian, which your friend Epictetus has watered down. Not that I
  blame him, either as regards style or in respect of morality. His humorous
  description of the nursery troubles of the married Stoic was very
  good&mdash;for his purpose, and for a lecture. But it would not have suited
  Paul. A lecturer must not be too brief. If Epictetus were to pack stuff in
  his lectures as Paul packs it in his epistles, your lesson would sometimes
  not last five minutes.</p>

  <p>"But I am straying from the question, which is, whether Epictetus
  borrowed. Let me give you another instance. The Christians are permeated with
  two notions, the first is, that they have received an 'invitation,' 'summons'
  or 'calling' (<i>Klesis</i> they call it) to a heavenly Feast in a Kingdom of
  Heaven. The second is, that, if they are to attain to this Feast, they must
  pass through suffering and persecution, by 'witnessing' or 'testifying' to
  Christ, as being their King, in opposition to the Gods of the Romans. This
  'witness' or <i>martyria</i>, is so closely associated in their minds with
  the notion of persecution that 'martyrdom,' with them, has come to imply,
  almost always, death. Now, as far as I know, the Greeks do not anywhere use
  the word 'calling' in this sense. But look at what Epictetus says about a
  sham philosopher, who, having been 'called' by God to be a beggar, 'disgraces
  his <i>calling</i>': 'How then dost thou mount the stage now? It is in the
  character of a witness <i>called</i> by God, who says "Come thou, and bear
  witness to me."' Then the sham philosopher whines out, 'I am in a terrible
  strait, O Lord, and most unfortunate. None take thought for me; none give to
  me. All blame me. All speak evil of me.' To which Epictetus replies, 'Is this
  the witness thou wouldst bear, <i>bringing shame on the calling wherewith He
  hath called thee</i>, in that He honoured thee with so great an honour, and
  counted thee <i>worthy</i> to be promoted to the high task of such a
  witnessing?' Now this phrase, 'worthy of the calling,' is Pauline in thought,
  and Pauline in word. Here is an instance, from a letter to the Thessalonians,
  'That our God would <i>count you worthy of the calling.</i>' And Paul writes
  to the Ephesians, 'That ye walk <i>worthily of the calling wherewith ye were
  called.</i>'</p>

  <p>"Again, you yourself remarked to me on the strangeness and originality of
  Epictetus's expression about 'eating,' namely, that, in the very act of
  eating, or going to the gymnasium, or whatever else, the philosopher was to
  remember that he was 'feeding on God' and 'carrying about God,' and that he
  must not 'defile' the image of the God within him. Well, I admit it is
  strange, but I do not admit that it is original. I can match it in the first
  place with another passage from Epictetus himself, where he bids some of his
  uppish pupils, who wished to reform the world, first to reform themselves.
  'In this way,' he said, 'when eating, help those who eat with you; when
  drinking, those who drink with you.' In the next place, I can match both out
  of the letter to the Corinthians, which says, 'Ye are <i>God's temple</i>'
  and 'If anyone destroys <i>Gods temple</i>, him will God destroy,' and
  again,'<i>Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit</i>, which ye have from
  God.' It adds that people cause shame to others and injury to themselves by
  greediness at the sacred meals they take in common; and lastly, says Paul,
  '<i>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
  glory of God</i>.' There are things like this, of course, in Seneca, but
  none, as far as I know, that come so near as Epictetus does to the language
  of Paul.</p>

  <p>"I could quote more from Paul, and also from other sacred books of the
  Christians, to show that Epictetus is indebted to them. But I have been
  already led on by the fascination&mdash;to me it is a fascination&mdash;of a
  merely literary discussion, to say more than enough, and a great deal more
  than I intended. Let me conclude with an extract from a letter I lately
  rummaged up from my dear old friend Pliny, whom I greatly miss. He was the
  former Governor of Bithynia about whom you wrote. It refers to a very fine
  fellow, Artemidorus by name, a military tribune, son-in-law of the excellent
  Musonius (Epictetus's teacher, whom I mentioned above).'Among the whole
  multitude of those who in these days call themselves philosophers, you will
  hardly find one so sincere, genuine, and true, as Artemidorus. I say nothing
  about his bodily endurance of heat and cold and the most arduous toil, of his
  indifference to the pleasures of the table, of the strict control with which
  he keeps his eyes and his passions in order. These are great virtues, but
  only great in others. In him they are but trifles compared with his other
  merits.'</p>

  <p>"So wrote Pliny. Well, for me at all events,'to keep eyes and passions in
  order' is not 'a trifle.' Perhaps it is not 'a trifle' for you. I fully
  believe that Musonius's successor&mdash;for as such I regard
  Epictetus&mdash;in spite of some opinions in which I cannot quite follow him,
  will help you to attain this object. Give yourself wholly to that. I knew
  Artemidorus. So did your father. We both thought him the model of a soldier
  and a gentleman. Believe me, my dear Quintus, it would be one of the greatest
  comforts in my last moments if I could feel assured that&mdash;to some slight
  extent in consequence of advice from me&mdash;the son of my old friend
  Decimus Junius Silanus was following in the footsteps of one whom he so
  esteemed and admired. Farewell."</p>

  <p>This was the end of the letter. But out of it dropped a paper containing a
  sealed note. On the paper were these words: "To convince you that I had not
  judged your philosopher unfairly, I transcribed a few passages from other
  Christian documents, containing words assigned by Christians to Christ
  himself, which seem to me to have influenced Epictetus. On second thoughts, I
  have come to think it was waste of my time. That it might not waste yours
  too, I was on the point of throwing the thing into the fire. But I decided to
  send it rather than let you suppose me to be a crotchety, suspicious,
  prejudiced old man, ungenerous towards one whom both you and I respect with
  all our hearts. I grant that I am slow to believe in new <i>facts</i>; but I
  need hardly assure you, my dearest Quintus, that I am not slow to believe in
  good <i>motives</i>&mdash;the motives of good men, tried, tested, and proved,
  by such severe trials as have befallen your admirable Master. Rather than
  suspect me thus, break the seal and read it at once. But I hope you will not
  want to read it. Discussions of this sort must not be allowed to distract
  your energies as they might do. Better bum it. Or keep it&mdash;till you are
  military tribune."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">V. &mdash; EPICTETUS ALLUDES TO JEWS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I DID not open the sealed note, though I was not convinced
  that Epictetus had been a borrower. Paulus the Christian had begun to
  interest me, because of Scaurus's quotations and remarks on his style. Indeed
  he interested me so much that I determined at once to procure a copy of his
  letters. But Christus himself&mdash;whom I call Christus here to distinguish
  the meaning with which I used the name then from that with which I began to
  use the name of "Christ" soon afterwards&mdash;Christus, I say, at that
  moment, did not interest me at all.</p>

  <p>Moreover I was impressed by what Scaurus said about a military career.
  Though too young to remember much about the shameful days of Domitian, yet I
  had heard my father describe the anguish he used to feel, when letters from
  the Emperor to the Senate came announcing a glorious victory (duly honoured
  with a triumph) after which would come a private letter from Scaurus
  informing him that the victory was a disgraceful defeat. And even later on,
  even after the successes of Trajan, my father, in conversations with Scaurus,
  had often expressed, in my hearing, still lingering apprehensions of a time
  when the barbarians might break in like a flood upon the northern borders of
  the empire&mdash;if ever the imperial throne were cursed with a second
  Domitian. Patriotism would be even more needed then, he said, than when
  Marius beat back the Cimbri. All this gave additional weight to Scaurus's
  remarks. "Artemidorus," I said, "shall be my model. I will try to be a good
  soldier and a good Stoic in one." So I locked up the note, still sealed.</p>

  <p>Here I may say that afterwards, when I did open it, it did not greatly
  influence the course of my thoughts. By that time, I had come to think that
  Scaurus was right, and that Epictetus had really borrowed from the
  Christians. I opened it, therefore, not because I distrusted the fairness and
  soundness of his judgment, but because I trusted it and looked to him for
  information. As a fact, it rather confirmed his hypothesis of borrowing, but
  did not demonstrate anything. The real influence of that little note in my
  cabinet amounted, I think, to little more than this. In the period I am now
  about to describe, while daily studying the works of Paulus the Christian, I
  was beginning to ask myself "If Paulus the follower of Christus was so great
  a teacher, must not Christus have been greater?" In those days, when taking
  out Paul's epistles from my bookcase, I used often to see that packet lying
  there, with WORDS OF CHRISTUS on it, and the seal unbroken. Then I used to
  say "If only I could make up my mind to open you, you might tell me wonderful
  things." This stimulated my curiosity. It was one of many things&mdash;some
  little, some great&mdash;that led me toward my goal.</p>

  <p>The reader may perhaps think that I, a Roman of equestrian rank, must have
  been already more prone to the Christian religion than I have admitted, if I
  attempted to procure a copy of Paul's epistles from a bookseller in Nicopolis
  frequented by my fellow-students. But I made no such attempt. Possibly our
  bookseller there would not have had a copy. Probably he would not have
  confessed it if he had. In any case, I did not ask him. It happened that I
  needed at this time certain philosophic treatises (of Chrysippus and others).
  So I wrote to a freedman of my father's in Rome, an enterprising bookseller,
  who catered for various tastes, giving him the titles of these works and
  telling him how to prepare and ornament them. Then I added that Aemilius
  Scaurus had sent me some remarkable extracts from the works of one Paulus, a
  Christian, and that the volume seemed likely to be interesting as a literary
  curiosity. This was perhaps a little understating the case. But not much.
  With Flaccus, my Roman bookseller, I felt quite safe. Rather than buy Paul's
  epistles from Sosia in Nicopolis, I am sure I should not have bought them at
  all. Such are the trifles in our lives on which sometimes our course may
  depend&mdash;or may seem to have depended.</p>

  <p>Meantime I had been attending lectures regularly and had become familiar
  with many of Epictetus's frequently recurring expressions of doctrine. They
  were still almost always interesting, and generally impressive. But his
  success in forcing me to "feel, for the moment, precisely what he felt
  "&mdash;how often did I recognise the exact truth of this phrase of
  Arrian's!&mdash;made me begin to distrust myself. And from distrust of myself
  sprang distrust of his teaching, too, when I found the feeling fade away
  (time after time) upon leaving the lecturer's presence. When I sat down in my
  rooms to write out my notes, asking myself, "Can I honestly say I hope to be
  ever able to do this or that?" how often was I obliged to answer, "No!"</p>

  <p>I could not trust his judgment about what we should be able to do, because
  I could not trust his insight into what we were. Two causes seemed to keep
  him out of sympathy with us. One was his own singular power of bearing
  physical pain&mdash;almost as though he were a stone and not flesh and blood.
  He thought that we had the same, or ought to have it. Another cause was his
  absorption in something that was not human, in a conception of God, whom (on
  some evidence clear to him but not made clear by him to us, or at all events
  not to me) he <i>knew</i> (not trusted or believed, but <i>knew</i>) to have
  bestowed on him, Epictetus, the power of being at once&mdash;not in the
  future, but at once, here on earth, at all times, and in all
  circumstances&mdash;perfectly blessed. Having his eyes fixed on this Supreme
  Giver of Peace, our Master often seemed to me hardly able to bring himself to
  look down to us, except when he was chiding our weakness.</p>

  <p>Passing over several of the lectures that left me in the condition I have
  endeavoured to describe, I will now come to the one in which Epictetus
  alluded to Christians. "Jews" he called them. But he defined them in such a
  way as to convince Arrian that he meant Christians. Even if he did not, the
  impression produced on me was the same as if he had actually mentioned them
  by name. The lecture began with the subject of "steadfastness." "A practical
  subject, this," I said to myself, "for one in training to be a second
  Artemidorus." But the "steadfastness" was not of the sort demanded in camps
  and battlefields. The essence of good, said the lecturer, is right choice,
  and that of evil a wrong choice. External things are not in our power,
  internal things are: "This Law God has laid down. <i>If thou wilt have good,
  take it from thyself!</i>' Then followed one of the now familiar dialogues,
  of which I was beginning to be a little tired, between a tyrant threatening a
  philosopher, who points out that he cannot possibly be threatened. The tyrant
  stares and says, "I will put you in chains." The wise man replies, "It is my
  hands and feet that you threaten." "I will cut off your head," shouts the
  tyrant. "It is my head that you threaten," replies the philosopher. After a
  good deal more of this, a pupil is supposed to ask, "Does not the tyrant
  threaten you then?" To this the lecturer replies, "Yes, if I fear these
  things. But if I have a feeling and conviction that these things are nothing
  to me, then I am not threatened." Then he appealed to us, "Of whom do I stand
  in fear? What things must he be master of to make me afraid? Do you say, 'The
  master of things that are in your power'? I reply, 'There is no such master.'
  As for things not in my power, what are they to me?"</p>

  <p>Epictetus had a sort of rule or canon for us beginners, by which we were
  to take the measure of the so-called evils of life: "Make a habit of saying
  at once to every harsh-looking apparition of this sort, 'You are an
  apparition and not at all the thing you appear to be. Are you of the number
  of the things in my power, or are you not? If not, you are nothing to me.'"
  Applying this to a concrete instance, our Master now dramatized a dialogue
  between himself and Agamemnon, who is supposed to be passing a sleepless
  night in anxiety for the Greeks, lest the Trojans should destroy them on the
  morrow.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. What! Tearing your hair! And you say your heart leaps in
  terror! And all for what? What is amiss with you? Money-matters?</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. No.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. Health?</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. No.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. No indeed! You have gold and silver to spare. What then is
  amiss with you? That part of you has been neglected and utterly corrupted,
  wherewith we desire etc.. etc."</p>

  <p>Here Epictetus&mdash;after some customary technicalities&mdash;turned to
  us like a showman, to explain the royal puppet's condition: "'How
  <i>neglected</i>?' you ask. He does not know the essence of the Good for
  which he has been created by nature, nor the essence of evil. He cries out,
  'Woe is me, the Greeks are in peril' because he has not learned to
  distinguish what is really his own etc. etc." After this apostrophe, which I
  have condensed, he resumed the dialogue:</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. They are all dead men. The Trojans will exterminate them.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i> And if the Trojans do not kill them, they are never, never
  to die, I suppose!!</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>, 0, yes, they'll die. But not at one blow, not to a man, like
  this.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. What difference does it make? If dying is an evil, then,
  surely, whether they die all together or one by one, it is equally an evil.
  And do you really think that dying will be anything more than the separating
  of the paltry body from the soul?</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. Nothing more.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. And you, when the Greeks are in the act of perishing, is
  the door of escape shut for you? Is it not open to you to die?</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. It is.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. Why then bewail? Bah! You, a king! And with the sceptre of
  Zeus, too! A king is never unfortunate, any more than God is unfortunate.
  What then are you? A shepherd in truth! For you weep, like the
  shepherds&mdash;when a wolf carries off one of their sheep. And these Greeks
  are fine sheep to submit to being ruled over by you. Why did you ever begin
  this Trojan business? Was your desire imperilled, etc. etc.?" [Here I omit
  more technicalities.]</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. No, but my brother's darling wife was carried away.</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. And was not that a great blessing, to be deprived of a
  'darling wife' who was an adulteress?</p>

  <p>"<i>Ag</i>. Were we then to submit to be trampled on by the Trojans?</p>

  <p>"<i>Epict</i>. Trojans? What are the Trojans? Wise or foolish? If wise,
  why make war against them? If foolish, why care for them?"</p>

  <p>I doubt whether Epictetus quite carried his class with him on this
  occasion. He certainly did not carry me, though he went on consistently
  pouring out various statements of his theory. For the first time in my
  experience of his lectures, I began to feel that his reiterations were really
  tedious. My thoughts strayed. I found myself questioning whether my model
  soldier and philosopher, Artemidorus, could possibly accept this teaching.
  Would Trajan, I asked, have been so sure of beating Decebalus, if he had
  considered the disgrace of Rome a matter "independent of choice," and
  therefore "nothing to him," "neither good nor evil"?</p>

  <p>From this reverie I was roused by a sudden transition&mdash;to a picture
  of a well-trained youth going forth to a conflict worthy of his mettle. And
  now, I thought, we shall have something more like the ideal of my first
  lecture, a Hercules or Diogenes, going about to help and heal. But perhaps
  Epictetus drew a distinction between a Diogenes and mere well-trained youths,
  mere beginners in philosophy. At all events, what followed was only a kind of
  catechism to prepare us against adversity, and especially against official
  oppression. "Whenever," said he, "you are in the act of going into the
  judgment hall of one in authority, remember that there is also Another from
  above, taking note of what is going on, and that you must please Him rather
  than the authority on earth." This catechism he threw into the form of a
  dialogue between the youth and God&mdash;whom he called "Another."</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Exile, prison, bonds, death, and disgrace&mdash;what used
  you to call these things in the Schools?</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. I? Things indifferent.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Well, then, what do you call them now? Can it be that
  <i>they</i> have changed?</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. They have not.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. You, then&mdash;have you changed?</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. I have not.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Say, then, what are 'things indifferent?'</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. The things outside choice.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Say also the next words.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. Things indifferent are nothing to me.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Say also about things good. What things used you to think
  good?</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. Right choice, right use of phenomena.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. And what the end and object?</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. To follow thee.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Do you say the same things still?</p>

  <p>"<i>Pupil</i>. I say the same things still.</p>

  <p>"<i>Another</i>. Go your way, then, and be of good cheer, and remember
  these things, and you will see how a young and well-trained champion towers
  above the untrained."</p>

  <p>I wanted to hear him explain why he spoke of "<i>Another</i>" instead of
  Zeus, or God. It struck me that he meant to suggest to us that in this
  visible world, whenever we say "<i>this</i>" we must also say, in our minds,
  "<i>another</i>" to remind ourselves of the invisible counterpart.
  "Especially must we say '<i>Another</i>'"&mdash;this, I thought, was his
  meaning&mdash;"when we speak about rulers. Visible rulers are mostly bad. We
  must prevent them from encroaching on the place that should be filled in our
  hearts by the Other, the invisible Ruler."</p>

  <p>Instead of this explanation, however, he concluded his lecture by warning
  us against insincerity, or "speaking from the lips," and against trying to be
  on both sides, when we ought to choose between two contending sides. This he
  called "trimming." And here it was&mdash;while addressing an imaginary
  "trimmer"&mdash;that he used the word "Jew."</p>

  <p>"Why," said he&mdash;addressing the sham philosopher&mdash;"why do you try
  to impose on the multitude? Why pretend to be a Jew, being really a Greek?
  Whenever we see a man trimming, we are accustomed to say,'This fellow is no
  Jew, he is shamming.' But when a man has taken into himself <i>the feeling of
  the dipped and chosen</i>"&mdash;these were his exact words, uttered with a
  gesture and tone of contempt&mdash;"then he is, both in name and in very
  truth, a Jew. Even so it is with us, having merely a sham baptism; Jews in
  theory, but something else in fact; far away from any real feeling of our
  theory, and far away from any intention of putting into practice the
  professions on which we plume ourselves&mdash;as though we knew what they
  really meant!" I could not quite make out this allusion to Jews. But there
  was no mistaking his next sentence, and it was the last in the lecture, "So,
  I repeat, it is with us. We are not equal to the fulfilment of the
  responsibilities of common humanity, not even up to the standard of Man. Yet
  we would fain take on ourselves in addition the burden of a philosopher. And
  what a burden! It is as though a weakling, without power to carry a ten-pound
  weight, were to aspire to heave the stone of Ajax!"</p>

  <p>Thus he dismissed us. I went out, feeling like the "weakling" indeed, but
  without the slightest "aspiration to heave the stone of Ajax." Perhaps Arrian
  wished to encourage me. For after we had walked on awhile in silence, he
  said, "The Master was rather cutting to-day. I remember his once saying that
  we ought to come away from him, not as from a theatre but as from a surgery.
  To-day the surgeon used the knife, and we don't like it."</p>

  <p>"But what good has the knife done us?" I exclaimed. "If only I could feel
  that the surgeon had cut out the mischief, a touch of the knife should not
  make me wince. But the mischief within me seems more mischievous, and my
  strength for good less strong, for some things that I have heard to-day. Is a
  Roman to say, when fighting against barbarians for the name and fame of Rome,
  'These things are nothing to me'? Is Diogenes, healing mankind, his brethren,
  to say, 'Your diseases are nothing to me'? And that fine phrase in the
  Catechism, 'follow thee'&mdash;is it not really a disguised form of 'follow
  myself'? Does it not mean, 'follow the <i>logos</i> within me, my own reason,
  or my own reasonable will,' or 'follow my own peace of mind, on which my mind
  is bent, to the neglect of everything else'?"</p>

  <p>"It does not mean that, for Epictetus himself, I am convinced," said
  Arrian. "I believe not, for him," said I; "but it has that meaning for me.
  His teaching does not teach&mdash;not me, at least, however it may be with
  others&mdash;the art of being steadfast. And what about others? Did not he
  himself just now admit that his <i>logos</i> was less powerful than the
  <i>pathos</i> of the Jews to produce steadfastness? What, by the way, is this
  <i>pathos</i>? Does it mean passionate and unreasonable conviction? And who
  on earth are these Jews that are 'dipped and chosen'?"</p>

  <p>My friend's face brightened. Perhaps it was a relief to him to pass from
  theology to matter of literary fact. "I think," he replied, "that he must
  mean the Jewish followers of Christus&mdash;the Christians, about whom we
  were lately talking." "Then why," said I, "does not he call them Christians?"
  "I do not know," replied Arrian, "He has never mentioned either Christians or
  Christus in my hearing; but he has, in one lecture at all events, used the
  term 'Galilaeans' to mean the Christians. And I feel sure that he means them
  here, because the other Jews do not practise baptism, except for proselytes,
  whereas the Christians are all baptized." "But," said I, "he does not call
  them 'baptized.' He calls them 'dipped.'" "That is his brief allusive way,"
  said Arrian. "You know that we provincials, and sometimes even Athenians too,
  speak of <i>dipping</i> the hair, or, if I may invent the word,
  <i>bapting</i> it, where the literary people speak of <i>blacking</i> or
  <i>dyeing</i> it. That is just what our Master means. These Christians are
  not merely <i>baptized</i>; they are <i>bapted</i>. That is to say, they are
  permanently and unalterably stained, or dyed in grain. They are. We are not.
  That is his meaning. Afterwards, as you noticed, he dropped into the regular
  word '<i>baptism</i>,' and spoke of us as <i>sham-baptists</i>."</p>

  <p>"But he also called them chosen" said I, "&mdash;that is to say, if he
  meant <i>chosen</i>, and not <i>caught</i> or <i>convicted</i>." Arrian
  smiled. "You have hit the mark without knowing it," said he. "I noticed the
  word and took it down. It is another of his jibes! These Christians actually
  call themselves '<i>elect</i>' or '<i>chosen.</i>' I heard all about it in
  Bithynia. They profess to have been 'called' by Christus. Then, if they obey
  this 'calling,' and remain steadfast, following Christus, they are said to be
  '<i>chosen</i>' or '<i>elect</i>' But our Master believes this
  '<i>calling</i>' and '<i>choosing</i>' to be moonshine, and these Christian
  Jews to be the victims of a mere delusion, caught by error. So he uses a word
  that might mean '<i>chosen</i>' but might mean also '<i>caught</i>.' They
  think themselves the former. He thinks them the latter."</p>

  <p>I hardly know why I refrained from telling my friend what Scaurus had told
  me about the probability that Epictetus had borrowed from the Christians.
  Partly it was, I think, because it was too long a story to begin just then;
  and I thought I might shock Arrian and not do Scaurus justice. Partly, I was
  curious to question Arrian further. So after a short silence, during which my
  friend seemed lost in thought, I said to him, "You know more about the
  Christians than I do. Do you think Epictetus knows much about them? And what
  precisely does he mean by '<i>feeling</i>' when he speaks of 'taking up the
  <i>feeling</i> of the dipped'?"</p>

  <p>"As for your first question," said Arrian, "I am inclined to think that he
  knows a great deal about them. How could it be otherwise with a young slave
  in Rome under Nero, when all the world knew how the Christians were used to
  light the Emperor's gardens? Moreover his contrast between the Jew and the
  Greek seemed to me to come forth as though it had been some time in his mind,
  though it had not broken out till to-day. He spoke with the bitterness of a
  conviction of long standing. If&mdash;contrary to his own rules&mdash;he
  could be 'troubled,' I should say our Master felt a real 'trouble' in being
  forced to confess that the Jew is above the Greek in steadfastness and
  constancy. As to your second question, I think he means that, whereas Greeks
  attain to wisdom through the reason (or <i>logos</i>) these Jews follow their
  God, or Christus, through what we Greeks call emotion or affection (i.e.
  <i>pathos</i>). And I am half disposed to think that this word <i>pathos</i>
  was used by him on the other occasion when he spoke of the Christian Jews as
  Galilaeans." "Could you quote it?" said I. "No, not accurately," said Arrian,
  "it is rather long, and has difficulties. I should prefer you to have it
  exactly. Come into my rooms. I am going out on business, so that we cannot
  talk about it at present. But you shall copy it down."</p>

  <p>So I went in to copy it down. Arrian left me after finding the place for
  me in his notes. "You will see," he said, "that the Galilaeans are there
  described as being made intrepid '<i>by habit.</i>' Well, that is certainly
  how I took the words down. But I am inclined to think it might have been 'by
  <i>feeling</i>'&mdash;which seems to me to make better sense. But read the
  whole context and judge for yourself. The two phrases are easily confused.
  Now I leave you to your copying. <i>Prosit!</i> More about this,
  to-morrow."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">VI. &mdash; PAUL ON THE LOVE OF CHRIST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE lecture from which I was transcribing was on
  "fearlessness." What, it asked, makes a tyrant terrible? The answer was, "his
  armed guards." A child, or madman, not knowing what guards and weapons mean,
  would not fear him. Men fear because they love life, and a tyrant can take
  life. Men also love wealth, wife, children. These things, too, a tyrant can
  take; so men fear him. But a madman, caring for none of these things, and
  ready to throw them away as a child might throw a handful of sand&mdash;a
  madman does not fear. Now came the words about "custom" and "Galilaeans" to
  which Arrian had called my attention: "Well, then, is not this astonishing?
  Madness can now and then make a man thus fearless! <i>Custom can make the
  Galilaeans fearless!</i> Yet&mdash;strange to say&mdash;reason and
  demonstration cannot make anyone understand that God has made all that is in
  the world, and has made the world itself, in its entirety, absolutely
  complete in itself and unimpeded in its motions, and has also made its
  separate parts individually for the use of all the parts collectively!"</p>

  <p>The context made me see the force of Arrian's remark. Epictetus appeared
  to be mentioning three influences under which men might resist the threats
  and tortures of a tyrant. In the first place was the "madness " of a lunatic.
  In the third place was the "logic," or demonstration, of philosophy. In the
  second place, it would make good sense to suppose that Epictetus meant
  "feeling," or "passionate enthusiasm." This passage would then accord with
  the one mentioned above. Both passages would then afl&amp;nn that the
  Christian Jews or Galilaeans can do under the influence of "feeling" what the
  Greek Philosophers, or "lovers of wisdom," cannot do with all the aid of
  reason (or "<i>logos</i>"). "Custom" would not make good sense unless the
  "Galilleans," or Christians, had made a "custom" of hardening their bodies by
  severe asceticism. This (I had gathered from Arrian) was not the fact. In any
  case, it seemed clear that Epictetus was here again contrasting some kind of
  Jew with the Greek to the disadvantage of the latter.</p>

  <p>Curiosity led me to read on a little further. The text dealt with Man's
  place in the Cosmos, or Universe, as follows: "All the other parts of the
  Cosmos except man are far removed from the power of intelligently following
  its administration. But the living being that is endowed with logoSy or
  reason, has therein a kind of ladder by which he may reason the way up to all
  these things. Thus he, and he alone, can understand that he is a part, and
  what kind of part, and that it is right and fit that the parts should yield
  to the whole." This reminded me of the saying I have quoted above, "Will you
  not make a contribution of your leg to the Universe?" I think he meant "Will
  you not offer up your lameness, as a decreed part of the whole system of
  things, and as a sacrifice from you to the Supreme?"</p>

  <p>This reasonable part of the Cosmos, this "living being that is endowed
  with <i>logos</i>" Epictetus declared to be "<i>by nature</i> noble,
  magnanimous, and free." Consequently, said he, it discerns that, of the
  things around it, some are at its disposal, while others are not; and that,
  if it will learn to find its profit and its good in the former class, it will
  be perfectly free and happy, "being thankful always for all things to
  God."</p>

  <p>This puzzled me not a little. I could not understand how Epictetus
  explained the means by which these "noble, magnanimous, and free" creatures,
  created so "<i>by nature</i>," had degenerated into the weaklings, fools,
  profligates, and oppressors, upon whom he was constantly pouring scorn. Was
  not each man a "part" of the Cosmos? Was not the Cosmos " perfect and exempt
  from all disorder or impediment in any of its motions"? Did not each "part"
  in it&mdash;and consequently man&mdash;partake in this perfection and
  exemption, being "made for the service of the whole"? What cause did
  Epictetus find for the folly, vice, and injustice that he so often satirised
  and condemned as "subject to the wrath of God"? Man was a compound of "clay"
  and "<i>logos</i>." The fault could not lie in the "<i>logos</i>." Was it,
  after all, the mere "clay" that caused all this mischief? And then, lost in
  thought, turning over the loose sheets of Arrian's notes, one after the
  other, I came again on the passage I have quoted above from Epictetus, "If I
  could have, I would have "&mdash;laying the fault, as it seemed, upon the
  "clay." I could not help asking, "If God 'could' not remedy it, how much less
  'could' I, being 'clay,' remedy myself, 'clay'?"</p>

  <p>Musing on these things I returned to my rooms, and was sitting down to
  write to Scaurus, when my servant entered with a parcel, from Rome, he said,
  forwarded by Sosia our bookseller. It contained the books I had ordered from
  Flaccus, with a letter from him, describing in detail the pains he had taken
  in having some of the rolls of Chrysippus and Cleanthes transcribed and
  ornamented, and saying that in addition to the "curious little volume
  containing the epistles of Paulus," which, as I no doubt anticipated, were
  "not in the choicest Greek," he had forwarded an epistle to the Hebrews.
  "This," he said, "does not include in the commencement the usual mention of
  Paulus's name, and it is not in his style. But I understand that it
  originated from the school of Paulus."</p>

  <p>There was more to the same effect, for Flaccus and I were on very friendly
  terms; and he was a good deal more than a mere seller of books. But I passed
  over it, for I was in haste to open the parcel. At the top were the copies of
  Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and others, in Flaccus's best style. At the bottom of
  all were two rolls of flimsy papyrus. The larger and shabbier of the two fell
  to the ground open, and as I took it up, my eye lit on the following
  passage:&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or
  suffering or persecution or himger or nakedness or peril or the sword? As it
  is written:</i></p>

  <p class="verse">'For thy sake are we done to death all the day long:<br>
  We were accounted as sheep of the shambles.'</p>

  <p><i>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him that
  loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
  sovereignties, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor
  height, nor depth, nor anything in all creation, will be able to separate us
  from that love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord!</i>"</p>

  <p>"This, at all events," said I, "Scaurus cannot say that Epictetus has
  borrowed from Paul. Never have I heard Epictetus mention the word ' love ';
  and here, in this one short passage. Paul uses it twice!"</p>

  <p>My next thought was that Scaurus was quite right in his estimate of Paul's
  style. It was indeed terse, intense, fervid, strangely stimulating and
  constraining.</p>

  <p>"There is no lack of <i>pathos</i>," I said, "Let us now test the
  <i>logos</i>!" So I sat down to study the passage, trying to puzzle out the
  meaning of the separate words and phrases.</p>

  <p>"<i>The love of Christ!</i>" Well, Christus was their leader. The
  Christians still loved him, and clung to his memory. That was intelligible.
  But "that love of God which was in Christ" perplexed me. I read the whole
  passage over again. Gradually I began to see that the passage implied the
  Epictetian ideal&mdash;according to Scaurus, not Epictetian but Pauline or
  Christian&mdash; of a Son of God standing fearless and erect in the face of
  enemies, tyrants, oppression, death. But it also suggested invisible
  enemies&mdash;"angels and sovereignties"&mdash;that seemed to be against the
  sons of God. And still I could not make out the expression, "that love of God
  which is in Christ Jesus."</p>

  <p>So I turned back to the words at the bottom of the preceding
  column:&mdash; "<i>If God is for us, who is against us? He that spared not
  His own Son but delivered him up for us all, how shall He not also, with him,
  freely give us all things? It is God that maketh and calleth us righteous:
  who is he that shall condemn? It is Christ Jesus that died&mdash;or rather
  that was raised from the dead, who is on the right hand of God, who also
  "maketh intercession for us.</i>" And so, coming to the end of the column, I
  looked on again to the words with which I had begun: "<i>Who shall separate
  us from the love of Christ?</i>" Now I could understand. "This," said I, "is
  a great battle. There are sovereignties of evil against the good. The Son of
  the good God is supposed to devote himself to death, fighting against the
  hosts of evil. Or rather the Father sends him into the battle and he goes
  willingly. This Christus of the Galiteans is regarded by them as we Romans
  might think of one of the Decii plunging into the ranks of the enemy and
  devoting himself to death for the salvation of Rome. Philosophers might ask
  inconvenient questions about the nature of the God to whom the brave man
  devotes himself&mdash;whether it is Pluto, or Zeus, or Nemesis, or Fate. No
  philosopher, perhaps, would approve of this theory. But, in practice, the
  bravery stirs the spirits of those who believe it. Even if the sacrifice is
  discreditable to the Gods accepting it, it is creditable to the man making
  it."</p>

  <p>Turning back still further, I found that Paul imagined the Cosmos&mdash;
  or "creation" as he called it&mdash;to have gone wrong. He did not explain
  how. Nor did he prove it. He assumed it, looking forward, however, to a time
  when the wrong would be made right, and even more right than if it had never
  gone wrong:&mdash; "<i>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present
  season are not fit to be spoken of in comparison of the glory that is
  destined to be revealed and to extend to us. For the earnest expectation of
  the creation waiteth intently for the revealing of the sons of God, For the
  creation was made subject to change, decay, corruption&mdash;not willingly
  but for the sake of Him that wade it thus subject&mdash;in hope, and for
  hope: because even this very creation, now corrupt, shall be made free from
  the slavery of corruption and brought into the freedom of the glory of the
  children of God. For we know that the whole of creation groaneth together and
  travaileth together&mdash;up to this present time.</i>"</p>

  <p>This struck me as a very different message from that of Epictetus about
  Zeus. Both Paul and Epictetus seemed to agree as regards the past, that
  certain things had happened that were not pleasing to God, taken by
  themselves. But whereas the Greek said about God, "He would have, if He could
  have; but He could not," the Jew seemed to say, "He can, and He will. Only
  wait and see. It will turn out to have been for the best."</p>

  <p>Reading on, I found something corresponding to Epictetus's doctrine of the
  indwelling Logos, namely, that each of us has in himself a fragment of the
  Logos of God,&mdash;but Paul called it Spirit&mdash;in virtue of which we may
  claim kinship with Him, being indeed God's children. Epictetus, however,
  never said that we were to pray to our Father for help. He seemed to think
  that each must derive his help from such portion of the Logos as each
  possessed. "Keep," he said, "that which is your own," "Take from yourselves
  your help," "Within each man is ruin and help," "Seek and ye shall find
  within you," or words to that effect. Paul's doctrine was different, teaching
  that we do not at present possess salvation and help to their full extent,
  but that we must look forward in hope: <i>"And not only so, but we ourselves
  also, though possessing the firstfruits of the Spirit&mdash;we ourselves
  also, I say, groan within ourselves, waiting earnestly for the adoptimi,
  namely, the ransoming and deliverance of our body"</i>&mdash;as though a time
  would come when that very same clay, which (according to Epictetus) the
  Creator would have wished to make immortal but could not, would be transmuted
  and transported in some way out of the region of flesh into the region of the
  spirit.</p>

  <p>Moreover, besides looking onward in hope, we must also (Paul said) look
  upward for help. Epictetus, too, as I have said above, sometimes spoke of
  looking "upward," and of the Cynic stretching up his hands to God. That,
  however, was not in prayer but in praise.</p>

  <p>Epictetus never used the word "prayer" in my hearing except of foolish,
  idle, or selfish prayers. But Paul represented the Logos, or rather the
  Spirit, within us, as an emotional, not a merely reasonable power. "It
  searcheth all things, yea, even the deep things of God," he said to the
  Corinthians; and by it (so he told the Romans in the passage I was just now
  quoting) the children express to the Father, and the Father receives from the
  children, their wants and aspirations:&mdash; <i>"For by hope were we saved.
  But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopeth for that which he seeth?
  But if we hope for that which we fail to see, then in patient endurance we
  earnestly wait for it And in the same way tlve Spirit also taketh part with
  our weakness. For as to what we should pray for, according to our needs, we
  do not know. But the Spirit itself maJceth represento/tion in our behalf in
  sighings beyond speech. Now He that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
  mind and temper of the Spirit, because, being in union and accord with God,
  it Tnaketh representation in behalf of the saints."</i></p>

  <p>This passage I only vaguely understood. For I started with the
  preconception that the spirit or breath or wind, must be only another
  metaphor&mdash;like "word "&mdash;to describe a "fragment" of God (as
  Epictetus called the Logos in man). I did not as yet understand that this
  Spirit might be regarded as, at one and the same moment, in heaven with God
  and on earth with men, representing the love and will of God to man below,
  and the love and prayers of man to God above. Still I perceived that in some
  way it was connected with the Christian Christ; and that the Father and the
  Spirit and Christ were in some permanent relation to each other and to man,
  by which relation man and God were drawn together. And this led me back again
  to the words, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" and "We are
  more than conquerors through Him that loved us."</p>

  <p>Comparing this "love" with the friendship felt by the Epictetian Diogenes
  for the whole human race, I found the latter thin and poor. The Greek
  philosopher, being a "friend" of the Father of Gods and men, seemed to me to
  be friendly to men in the region (so to speak) of the Logos, "because
  "&mdash;I was disposed to add&mdash;" the Logos within him, in a ' logical'
  way, commanded him to be friendly to them, for consistency's sake, as
  being'logically' akin to him." Perhaps some reaction against the constant
  inculcation of loyalty to the Logos during'the last few weeks led me to be a
  little unfeir to the Epictetian ideal. But, fair or unfair, these were my
  thoughts at the moment while I was turning over the letters addressed by this
  wandering Jewish Diogenes to some of the principal cities of Greece and Asia,
  coming every now and then on such sentences as these: <i>"I have strength for
  all things in Him that giveth me inward power"</i>; <i>"Being made powerful
  with all power, in accordance with the might of His glory, so that we rejoice
  in endurance and longsuffering, being thankful to the Father"</i>; <i>"Be ye
  made powerful in the Lord and in the might of His strength."</i> Here I noted
  that he did not say (as Epictetus did) "take power from yourselves." Moreover
  Paul added <i>"Put on the panoply of God."</i> Then I turned back again to
  the Roman and Corinthian letters; and still the same thoughts and phrases met
  me, about<i>"power"</i> in various contexts, such as <i>"demonstration of
  Spirit and power,"</i> and <i>"abounding in hope through the power of the
  Holy Spirit."</i> <i>"Love,"</i> too, was represented as an irresistible
  power. <i>"The love of Christ constraineth us,"</i> he said. And then he
  added, <i>"One died for all"</i> and <i>"He died for all, that the living
  should be living no longer to themselves, but to Him that for their sake died
  and was raised up from death."</i> There was a great deal in this Roman
  letter that was almost total darkness to me at first. The references to
  Abraham&mdash;and, still more, those to Adam, coming abruptly in the phrases,
  "death reigned from Adam," and "the transgression of Adam"&mdash;perplexed me
  a great deal till I perceived that the Jews fixed their hopes on God's
  promise to their forefather Abraham, just as Romans&mdash;if they believed
  Virgil&mdash;might fix theirs on the forefather of the Julian race. As Aeneas
  was the divine son of Anchises, so Isaac, by promise, was the divinely given
  son of Abraham. Paul, I thought, might draw a parallel between our Aeneas and
  his Isaac, as though both were receivers of divine promises of empire
  extending over all the nations of the earth. At this Jewish fancy (so I
  called it) I remember smiling at the time, and quoting Virgil from a Jew's
  point of view:</p>

  <p class="quote">"Tantae molis erat <i>Judaeam</i> condere gentem."</p>

  <p>But I soon perceived, not only that Paul was in serious earnest, quite as
  much as Virgil, but also that his scheme, or dream, of universal empire for
  the seed of Abraham was compatible with the fact of universal empire for the
  seed of Anchises. Rome, the new Troy, claimed dominion over nothing but men's
  bodies. The new Jerusalem claimed it over men's souls.</p>

  <p>I did not fully take all this into my mind till I had read the story of
  Abraham and Isaac in the scriptures, as I shall describe later on. But, with
  Virgil's help, and Roman traditions, I partially understood it even now; and
  I remember asking myself, "If Virgil were now alive, would he be as sanguine
  as this Jew? Is not Rome on the wane? Ever since the Emperor cried to
  Varus,'Give me back my legions!' have we not had qualms of fear lest we
  should be beaten back by the barbarians? Do not even the wisest of our rulers
  say, 'Let us draw the line here. Let us conquer no more'? But this Jew sets
  no limits to his conquests. His projects may be mad. But at least he has some
  basis of fact for them. If he has conquered so far, why not further?"</p>

  <p>As to "the transgression of Adam," I remained longer in the dark. But I
  perceived from other passages in the epistles (and from the Jewish scriptures
  soon afterwards) that the story of Adam and Eve resembled some versions that
  I had read of the story of Epimetheus and Pandora, who caused sins and pains
  to come into the world, but "hope" came with them. Adam and Eve did the same.
  But Paul believed that the "hope" sprang from a promise of a higher and
  nobler life than would have been possible if Adam and Eve had never gone
  wrong. I took this for a mere legend, but a legend that might represent the
  will of Zeus&mdash;namely, that man should not stand still, but that he
  should go on growing, from age to age, in righteousness, which, as Plato
  says, is the attribute of man that makes him most like God.</p>

  <p>Thus I was led on to higher and higher inferences about Paul's "power."
  First, it was real power, attested by facts&mdash;fitcts visible in great
  cities of Europe and Asia. In the next place, this power was based on faith
  and hope. Lastly, this faith and this hope&mdash;although they extended to
  everything in heaven and earth (since everything was to be bettered,
  purified, drawn onward or upward to what Plato might call its idea in God,
  that is, its perfection)&mdash;were themselves based on Christ, as having
  once died, but now being alive for ever in heaven.</p>

  <p>But not only in heaven. For Paul seemed to think of Christ as also still
  perpetually present with, and in, his disciples on earth. Socrates in the
  Phsedo says "As soon as I have drunk this poison I shall be no longer
  remaining among you, but shall be off at once to the isles of the blessed."
  But Paul spoke of Christ's love, and spirit, and of Christ himself, as still
  remaining amongst his followers. I knew that the common people think of
  Hercules as descending from heaven now and then to do a man a good turn; and
  at this I had always been disposed to laugh. But Paul's view of Christ as
  being always in heaven, and yet also always on earth, among, or in the hearts
  of, those who loved him&mdash;this seemed to me more noble and more credible;
  though I did not believe it.</p>

  <p>Now I was to be led a step further. For while I was repeating Paul's words
  "one died for all," and again, "one died," it occurred to me "Yes, but he
  does not say <i>how</i> he died. Is he ashamed to speak of the shamefulness
  of the death, the slave's death, death upon the cross?" So I looked through
  the Roman letter, right to the end, and I could find no mention of the
  "cross" or of "crucifying." But in the very next column, where the first
  Corinthian letter began, I found this passage:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>"Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the Gospel, not in wisdom
  of 'logos' (i.e. word), lest the cross of Christ should he emptied of its
  power. For as to the 'logos' of the cross, to those indeed who are going the
  way of destruction, it is folly: but to us, who are going the way of
  salvation, it is the power of God. For it is written:</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise<br>
  And the subtlety of the subtle will I bring to naught.'</i></p>

  <p><i>"Where is the 'wise?' Where is the learned writer? Where is the
  'subtle' discusser and disputer of this present age?"</i></p>

  <p>Then followed some very difficult words: <i>"Hath not God made foolish the
  wisdom of the Cosmos? For since, in the wisdom of God, the Cosmos, through
  that wisdom, recognised not God, God decreed through the foolishness of the
  proclamation of the gospel to save them that go the way of belief: for indeed
  Jews ask for signs and Greeks seek after wisdom, but we proclaim Christ
  crucified; to the Jews, a stumbling block; to the other nations, a folly;
  but, to the called and summoned&mdash;Christ the power of God and the wisdom
  of God."</i></p>

  <p>I have translated this literally so as to leave it as obscure to the
  reader as it was to me when I first read it. Even when I had read it over two
  or three times, there was a great deal that I could not understand. But it
  appeared to me to be ironical. It suggested that the "logos" of God may be
  different from the "logos" of men, or at all events, the "logos" of Greek
  philosophers. I had for some time been drawing near to a belief that "logos"
  might include feeling as well as reason. But this strange contrast between
  the unwise "wisdom of logos" and the wise "logos of the cross" came upon me
  as (possibly) a new revelation. As for the saying "the Greeks seek wisdom,"
  it reminded me how Epictetus used to deride the man of mere logic, words
  without deeds, the futile spinner of syllogisms. "Epictetus," I said to
  myself, "would agree with this accusation." But then I reflected that Paul
  would perhaps class Epictetus himself among these futile Greeks; and had not
  my Master himself confessed that the Jew, by mere force of "pathos,"
  outclassed the Greek in resolution and steadfastness, although the latter was
  backed by "logos"? The conclusion fell upon me, like a blow, "Here is Paul
  boasting as a conqueror what my Master confesses as a man conquered! Both
  agree that the 'feeling' of the Jew is more powerful in producing courage
  than the 'reasonableness' of the Greek!"</p>

  <p>I did not like this turn of things. But I was intensely interested in it;
  and it quite decided me to continue the investigation. The question turned on
  "logos" and I quoted to myself Plato's precept, "Follow the <i>logos</i>."
  Epictetus made much of "<i>logos</i>." Well, I would "follow the
  '<i>logos</i>,'" in its fullest sense, and would try to find out whether it
  did, or did not, indicate that "feeling," as well as "reason," may help us
  towards the knowledge of God. Dawn was appearing when I rolled up the little
  volume and placed it in my cabinet by the side of Scaurus's sealed note with
  "WORDS OF CHRISTUS" on it. That reminded me of my old friend. What would he
  think of all this?</p>

  <p>I sat down at once and wrote to him that I had not opened his note. If I
  ever did, it would be, I said, because I accepted his verdict. Epictetus
  really did seem to have borrowed from Paul. The subject was very interesting
  to me from a historical as well as a literary point of view ; and I hoped he
  would not think it waste of time if I investigated it a little further. At
  the same time, I sent a note to Flaccus. Aemilius Scaurus, I said, had sent
  me some "words of Christus" extracted from Christian books, and I desired to
  receive the books themselves. As for the "scriptures" from which Paul so
  frequently quoted in their Greek form, I knew that I should have no
  difficulty in procuring copies of all or most of them from Sosia. This I
  resolved to do on the morrow, or rather in the day that was now dawning. It
  was not a lecture-day. Even if it had been, in the mood in which I then was,
  I should have thought a lecture or two might be profitably missed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">VII. &mdash; DAVID AND MOSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE Greek translation of the Scriptures shown me by Sosia
  was in several volumes of various sizes and in various conditions. Unrolling
  the one that showed most signs of use, I found that, although it was in
  prose, it was a translation of Hebrew poems, mostly very short, and of a
  lyrical character. One of them had in its title the name of "David," which I
  had met with in Paul's letter to the Romans. Sosia told me that he was the
  greatest of the ancient kings of the Jews. Ordering the other volumes to be
  sent to my rooms, I took this back with me, and began to read it immediately,
  beginning with the poem on which I had chanced in the shop.</p>

  <p>It was a prayer for purification from sin: "Pity me, God, according to thy
  great pity, and according to the multitude of thy compassions blot out my
  transgression. Cleanse me still more from my crime, and purify me from my
  sin." So far, the poem was intelligible to me. I was familiar with the
  religious rites of cleansing fix)m blood-guiltiness&mdash;mentioned in
  connexion with Orestes and many others by the Greek poets and recognised in
  various forms all over the world. So I said, "This king has committed
  homicide. He has been purified with lustral rites and sacrifices. But he
  needs some further rites: 'Cleanse me still more,' he says. The poem will
  tell me, I suppose, what more he needs."</p>

  <p>After adding some words to the effect that the transgression was against
  God, against God alone, the king continued, "For behold, in transgressions
  was I created at birth, and in sins did my mother conceive me. For behold,
  thou hast ever loved truth; thou hast shown unto me the hidden secrets of thy
  wisdom. Thou wilt sprinkle me with hyssop and I shall be purified; thou wilt
  wash me and I shall be whiter than snow." Here I was at a stand. It seemed to
  me a great and sudden descent to a depth of superstition, to suppose that
  this particular additional rite of "cleansing with hyssop" could satisfy the
  king's conscience. Moreover I thought that "wisdom" must mean the wisdom of
  the Greeks. It was not till afterwards that I discovered how great a gulf
  separates our syllogistic or rhetorical or logical "wisdom" from that of the
  Jews&mdash;which means "knowledge of the righteousness of the Creator based
  upon reverence." Thence comes their saying, "Reverence for God is the
  beginning of <i>wisdom</i>."</p>

  <p>These two misunderstandings almost led me to put down the book in disgust.
  But the passionateness of the king's prayer made me read its opening words
  once again. Then I felt sure I must have done him injustice. So I read on.
  Presently I came to the words, "Create in me a clean heart, God, and renew a
  right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy countenance, and take not
  thy holy spirit from me." These made me ashamed of having taken "hyssop"
  literally.</p>

  <p>1 saw now that it was just as much metaphorical as "whiter than snow," and
  that it meant a deep and inward purification&mdash;of the heart, not of the
  body. Still more was I ashamed when I came to the words, " If thou hadst
  delight in sacrifice I would have given it to thee, but thou wilt take no
  pleasure in whole burnt-offerings. The sacrifice for God is a broken spirit.
  A broken and contrite heart God will not despise."</p>

  <p>This was all new and strange doctrine to me. The gracefiil lines of Horace
  about the eflBcacy of the simplest sacrifice&mdash;of meal and
  salt&mdash;from the hand of an innocent country girl, and about its
  superiority to the proffered bribe of a hecatomb from a man of guilt, these I
  knew by heart; but they did not touch the present question, which was as to
  how the man of guilt could receive purification, without a hecatomb, without
  the blood of bulls and goats. And the question went even beyond that. For the
  king said that he had been "in sins" even from the beginning, even before
  birth. Did he speak of himself alone, or of himself as the tjrpe of erring
  mankind? I thought the latter. He seemed to me to say, "Man is from the first
  an animal, born to follow appetite. In part (no doubt) he is a divine being,
  born to follow the divine will; but in part he is an animal, born to follow
  animal propensity." So far this agreed with Epictetus's doctrine about the
  Beast. The Beast, at the beginning, tyrannizes over the divine Man, so that
  the human being may be said to be in sin&mdash;and indeed is in sin, as soon
  as he becomes conscious of the tyranny within him. "No lustral rites, no
  blood of bulls and goats," the king seemed to say, "can purify this human
  heart of mine now that it has been tainted and corrupted by submitting to the
  Beast within me. A moment ago, my prayer was 'Purge me with hyssop,' but now
  it is 'Destroy me and create me anew,' 'Take away my old heart and give me a
  new heart.'"</p>

  <p>These last words were quite contrary to the doctrine of Epictetus, who
  taught us that we are to receive strength and righteousness from that which
  is within our own hearts. And, thought I, is not the king's prayer
  superstitious? The witches in Rome suppose they can draw down the moon by
  incantations. This king David in Judaea supposes he can draw down "a clean
  heart" and "a right spirit" by passionate invocation to the God of the Jews!
  Are not the two superstitions parallel? Would not Epictetus say so? Would not
  all the Cynics say so? I thought they would: and, as I was rolling up the
  little book, I said, "It is a fine and passionate poem, but the prayer is not
  one for a philosopher." Then, however, it occurred to me that there was a
  true and a deep philosophy&mdash;though I knew not of what school&mdash;in
  the doctrine that the true and purifying sacrifice for guilt is a penitent
  heart. That set me pondering the whole matter again and reflecting on some of
  the things in my own life of which I was most ashamed, things that I would
  have given much to forget, and a great deal more to undo. In the end, I found
  myself thinking&mdash;not saying, but thinking of it as a possible
  prayer&mdash;"In me, in me, too, create a clean heart, O thou God of
  forgiveness!" It might not be a prayer for philosophers, but I could not help
  feeling that it might be a good prayer for me.</p>

  <p>While I was placing my new volume by the side of Paul's epistles it
  occurred to me that the words I had just been reading might throw some light
  on a passage in the epistle to the Romans at which I had glanced last night.
  Then I could make nothing of it. Now I read it again: "I know that in me,
  that is, in my flesh, there dwelleth no good thing. To will [that which is
  good] is present with me, but to do is not present. I will to do good and I
  do it not. I will not to do evil, and I do it." This now seemed to me a truer
  description of the state of things (within me at all events) than the view
  mostly presented to us in our lecture-room. Epictetus often talked as though
  we had merely to will, and then what we willed&mdash;at least so far as
  concerns the mind and the things in the mind's province&mdash;would at once
  come to pass. True, he did not always say this. Sometimes he insisted on the
  need of training or practice, and then he likened the Cynic to an athlete
  preparing for the Olympian games. But it seemed to me that he habitually
  underrated the difficulty of conforming the human to the divine will: and he
  never&mdash;never even once, as far as I know&mdash;recognised the need or
  efficacy of repentant sorrow.</p>

  <p>My immediate conclusion was that, although it was not for me to decide
  between the "feeling" of the Jews and the "reason" of the Greeks in general,
  yet one thing was certain&mdash;I had a good deal to learn from the former.
  So I welcomed the arrival of Sosia's servant bringing the rest of my new
  books. A good many of them I unrolled and cursorily inspected at once. Both
  from their number, and from the variety of their subjects, it was clear that
  I should only be able to study a few. I resolved to confine myself to such
  parts as bore on Paurs epistles, and to dispense with lectures for a day or
  two. Then it occurred to me that Arrian, who had proposed to resume to-day
  our conversation on the Jews and Galilaeans, might come in at any moment. I
  put away the Jewish books and went to his lodging, thinking that I could
  perhaps tell my friend of my new studies in order to explain to him my
  non-attendance at lecture. Instead of Arrian, however, I found a note
  informing me that he had been obliged to go suddenly to Corinth (in connexion
  with some business of his father's) but hoped to return before long.</p>

  <p>This saved explanation; and I spent several days (during his prolonged
  absence) in studying my new volumes. They led me into a maze&mdash;or rather,
  maze after maze&mdash;of bewildering novelties. Sosia had told me that my
  first volume, containing five books, was called by the Jews "the Law." But it
  included pedigrees, poems, prophecies, histories of nations, and stories of
  private persons. The legal portion of it was largely devoted to details about
  feasts and purificatory sacrifices&mdash;the very things that David appeared
  to call needless. However, when I came to look into the Law more closely, I
  found that its fundamental enactments were humane and gentle&mdash;so much so
  as to give me the impression of being unpractical. It enjoined on the Jews
  kindness to strangers as well as to citizens. While retaining capital
  punishment, it prohibited torture. At least I took that to be a fair
  inference from the fact that it even forbade the infliction of more than
  forty blows with the scourge, on the ground that a "brother "&mdash;that was
  the w6rd&mdash;must not be so hx degraded as to become "vile" in the eyes of
  his fellow-citizens. It also placed some limitations on the right of masters
  to punish slaves, even when the latter were foreigners.</p>

  <p>Having been accustomed to regard the Jews as unique for their moroseness
  and unneighbourliness I was all the more astonished at these things. It
  occurred to me then, as it does sometimes now, that the Law was almost too
  humane to have been ever fully obeyed by the greater part of the people. For
  example, even the slaves, even the beasts of burden, were to have one day in
  seven as a holiday, on which all labour was forbidden. Periodic remission of
  debts was enacted by law! This surprised me most of all. To think that the
  revolutionary measure&mdash;so our Roman historians called it&mdash;for which
  our tribunes of the people had contended in vain under the Republic, should
  here be found legalised by the Law of Moses&mdash;and this, too, not as an
  exceptional and isolated condonation, but as a regular remission after a
  fixed number of years!</p>

  <p>"How," I asked, "could the Lawgiver expect people to lend money to
  borrowers if the creditor knew that in the course of a few months the
  obligation to pay the debt would cease?" Was he blind to the most manifest
  tendencies of human nature? No, I found he was not blind to them. He simply
  said that they must be resisted: "Beware," said he, "that there be not a base
  thought in thine heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at
  hand."</p>

  <p>This notion of forbidding an action, or abstinence from action, in a code
  of laws as being "base"&mdash;not as being "subject to a penalty of such a
  kind," or "a fine of so much," was quite new to me. I had given some time to
  the study of Boman law, and had always assumed that when the law says "Do
  this," it adds a punishment in some form or other, "Do this, or you shall
  suffer this or that." But here, embedded in the Law of Moses, was a law, or
  rather a recommendation, without penalty. And presently I found that the last
  of their Ten Greater Laws&mdash;if I may so call them&mdash;was of the same
  kind. It could not possibly be enforced&mdash;for it forbade "coveting"! Only
  a few days ago, before I had bought these books from Sosia, I had read in
  Paul's epistle to the Eomans "I should not have known covetousness if the law
  had not said. <i>Thou shalt not covet</i>"; and these words had puzzled me a
  good deal. I had thought that they must refer to some "law" of a spiritual
  kind, such as we might call "the law of the conscience" or "the law of our
  higher nature," or the like. Yet I felt that this interpretation did not
  quite agree with the context. Now I found, to my utter astonishment, that
  this was the very letter of the first clause of the tenth of the Greater
  Laws, "Thou shalt not covet."</p>

  <p>To crown all, I found that elsewhere the whole of the code was based by
  the Lawgiver on two fundamental precepts. The first was, "Thou shalt love the
  Lord thy God," and this love was to call forth all the powers of mind and
  soul and body. The second was, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
  How was either of these to be enforced? "Love," say all the poets, "is free."
  The Law neither prescribed nor suggested any means of enforcing these two
  Great Commandments of "loving." And how could "love" be at once "free," as
  poetry protests, and yet a part of the Law, as Moses testified? There seemed
  no answer to this question, unless some God could make us willing and eager
  to enforce the two commandments on ourselves, constraining us (so to speak)
  by love to love both Him and one another. "Truly," said I, "this Law of Moses
  is very ambitious." It seemed to aim at more than Law could accomplish. It
  reminded me of a sentence I had found in one of my new volumes, entitled
  "Proverbs," "The light of the Lord is as the breath of men; He searcheth the
  storehouses of the soul."</p>

  <p>Somewhat similar was a saying imputed to Epictetus&mdash;which I had not
  heard from Arrian but from a fellow-student&mdash;reproving one of his
  disciples in these words, "Man, where are you putting it? See whether the
  basin is dirty!" The disciple, though an industrious scholar, was of impure
  life; and Epictetus meant that, if the vessel of his soul was foul, all the
  knowledge put into that vessel would also become foul. The moral was, "First
  cleanse the vessel!" So the Jewish Proverb seemed to say, "The light of the
  Lord must first search the storehouse of the soul: then the food taken out
  from the storehouse will be pure and wholesome." This brought me back to the
  words of David, who seemed to think that the searching and cleansing must
  come from God and not from man alone, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and
  renew a right spirit within me!"</p>

  <p>Comparing these two fundamental or Greatest Laws of Moses with the
  fundamental law of Epictetus, "Keep the things that are thine own," I thought
  at first that the Jew and the Greek were entirely opposed. On second
  thoughts, however, I perceived that in "the things that are thine own"
  Epictetus would include justice and kindness, and all social so-called
  virtues so far as they did not interfere with one's own peace of
  mind&mdash;for he would perhaps exclude pity, and certainly sympathy in the
  full sense of the term. But Epictetus thought that people could be
  sufficiently kind and just and virtuous without other aid than that of the
  "logos" <i>within</i> them. David did not, in his own case, unless that which
  was within him had been cleansed or renewed by a Power regarded as
  <i>outside</i> him, to whom he prayed as God. There seemed to me, in this
  difiference of "within" and "outside," more than a mere difference of
  metaphor. But I had no time to think over the matter. For, just as I was
  regretting that Arrian was not with me to talk over some of these subjects,
  Glaucus, coming in to borrow a book, informed me that he had met my friend
  late in the previous night coming from the quay. I had intended to stay at
  home that morning. But now, finding that Glaucus was on his way to the
  lecture, I resolved to accompany him, expecting to meet Arrian there.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; EPICTETUS ON SIN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN we reached the lecture-room, a little late, we found it
  unusually crowded. My place was taken, and I could not see Arrian in his
  customary seat. Epictetus was in one of his discursive moods. He began with
  the assertion&mdash;by this time familiar to me, but somewhat distasteful
  now, fresh as I was from the atmosphere of the Jewish writings&mdash;that
  Gods and men alike seek nothing but "their own profit." As in most of his
  epigrams, he meant just the opposite of what he seemed to assert. He hated
  high-flown language as much as he loved high thought and action. Even when he
  mentioned "the beautiful"&mdash;on which most Greeks go off into
  rhapsodies&mdash;he almost always subordinated it to the "logos" or told us
  that we must look for it in ourselves. So here again. Man, he declared, must
  give up all things&mdash;property, reputation, children, wife, country, if
  they are incompatible with his true "profit." Then, of course, he showed that
  man's "profit" is virtue, so that we need not give up these blessings unless
  their possession is incompatible with virtue.</p>

  <p>What he said next was new to me. A father, losing a child in death, must
  not say "I have lost my child," but "I have given it back." When I say "new,"
  I mean new in his teaching. But I had recently met something like it in my
  books of Hebrew poems, "The Lord hath given, the Lord hath taken away.
  Blessed be the name of the Lord." Later on, I heard Epictetus repeat this
  almost in the same form. This seemed to me not only beautiful and devout but
  also consistent with reasonable faith.</p>

  <p>But I could not follow him when, in reply to the objection, "He that took
  away this thing from me is a villain," he said, "What does it matter to you
  by whom the Giver asked back the gifb?" It seemed to me that a recoil from
  villainy, as well as delight in virtue, ought to find a place even in the
  calmest of mankind. No philosopher, he said, can have an "enemy," because no
  one can do him any harm or touch anything that really belongs to him. This
  was true&mdash;in a sense. Its reasonableness contrasted with the passionate
  poetry of the Jews, which I had found full, too full, of talk about enemies.
  And yet, the more I meditated on the contrast, the more this "What does it
  matter to you?" seemed to become a cold-blooded, unnatural and immoral
  question. Surely it ought to "matter" to us a great deal whether we suffered
  loss from some neighbour's forgetfulness or from some enemy's premeditated
  and malignant treachery. He went on in the same chilling style. "Desire,"
  said he, "about that which is happening, that it shall happen. Then you will
  have a stream of constant peace." I seemed to see Priam "desiring that which
  was happening" when he saw Troy burned and the women ravished! His son,
  Polites, was being butchered by Pyrrhus before his eyes, and the old king was
  standing by, placidly enjoying "a stream of constant peace"!</p>

  <p>Then Epictetus said, "An uneducated man blames others for his own evils. A
  beginner blames himself. An educated man blames neither others nor himself."
  After this, he introduced what he called the law laid down by God. "Right
  convictions make the will and purpose good. Crooked and perverse convictions
  make the will bad. This law," he said, "God has laid down, and He says to
  each of us, 'If you will have anything that is good, take it from yourself.'"
  Then came another mention of the law&mdash;"the divine law" he now called it.
  It was connected with "right convictions," as to which he asked "What are
  these?" His reply was, "They are such as a man ought to meditate on all the
  day long. We must have such a conviction as will prevent us from attaching
  our feelings to anything that is other than our own&mdash;whether companion,
  or place, or bodily exercise, or even the body itself. We must remember the
  law and have it always before our eyes."</p>

  <p>This phrase, "meditate all the day long," reminded me of some words of
  David, which I had been reading the day before, "Oh how I love thy law! It is
  my meditation all the day." Other Hebrew expressions also came into my mind
  concerning the sweetness and fragrance of the Lord's commandment, how the
  poet "opened his mouth and drew in his breath" to taste its delight. These I
  could understand, when they applied to a law of love, a law of the emotions,
  a "feeling." But I wondered what Epictetus could produce for us of a nature
  to kindle such enthusiasm. He continued, "And what is the divine law? It is
  this. First, Keep the things that are your own. Secondly, Do not claim things
  not your own; use them, if given; do not desire them, if not given. Thirdly,
  When anything is being taken from you, give it up at once in a detached
  spirit, and with gratitude for the time during which one has used it."</p>

  <p>"Keep the things that are your own!"&mdash;This he placed first, and on
  this he laid most emphasis, dwelling on each syllable. I fencied that he knew
  he was disappointing us and almost took pleasure in it as though he were
  administering to us a wholesome but bitter medicine. "You find this sour," he
  seemed to say: "Sour or not, it is the truth, the only solid and safe truth.
  It is not the dream of a poet, or the scheme of a student. It is the plan of
  a man of business, practicable for all&mdash;for slaves as well as free men,
  for individuals in a desert as well as for communities in a city. 'Love your
  neighbour'&mdash;that is expecting too much. 'Do not covet what is your
  neighbour's'&mdash;that is expecting too little. 'Keep that which belongs to
  you!' There you have a rule that makes you independent of all neighbours." I
  was miserably disappointed; yet I could not help respecting and admiring our
  Master's unflinching frankness, his determination to force us to face the
  austere truth, and his contempt for anything that seemed incapable of being
  put into practice at all times and in all circumstances.</p>

  <p>He spoke next of "sin" or "error." Some of his language strangely
  resembled Paul's, but with great differences. He made mention of a
  "conflict," but he seemed mostly to mean "a conflicting state of things,"
  "logical contradiction," or inconsistency. It might be called self-
  contradiction, taken as including actions, and not words alone. He also used
  the very same phrase as Paul's "that which he willeth he doeth not," but not
  in the same way, as may be seen from the following extract which I took down
  exactly: "Every error includes self-contradiction. For since the person
  erring does not wish to err but to go straight, it is clear that what he
  wills to do he does not do... Now every soul endowed with 'logos' by nature
  is disposed to dislike self-contradiction. As long as a man has not followed
  up the facts and perceived that he is in a state of self-contradiction, he is
  in no way prevented from doing things that are self-contradictory; but, when
  he has followed them up, he must necessarily revolt from the
  self-contradiction... Here then comes in the need of the teacher skilled in
  'logos'...but the teacher needs also power to refute what is wrong and to
  stimulate the pupil to what is right. This teacher will give the erring man a
  glimpse into the self-contradiction in which he errs, and will make it clear
  to him that he is not doing that which he mills to do and <i>that he is doing
  that which he wills not to do</i>. As soon as this is made clear to the
  person in error, he will, of himself and of his own accord, depart from his
  error."</p>

  <p>Then he supposed a case where a man had relapsed from philosophy into a
  profligate and shameless life. And first he tried to show the offender how
  much he had lost in losing modesty and decency and true manliness. "There was
  a time," he said, "when you counted this as the only loss worth mentioning."
  Next, he showed each of us how to regain what we had lost. "It is you
  yourself," he exclaimed, "you yourself, no other whom you have to blame.
  Fight against yourself! Tear yourself away to seemliness, decency, and
  freedom."</p>

  <p>Lastly, he appealed&mdash;as I had never heard him do before&mdash;to the
  feelings of loyalty and affiection that we might entertain for himself. I
  thought he must be recalling his old days in Rome, when he, a boy and a
  slave, in the house of Epaphroditus, might be exposed to the temptations and
  coercions to which such slaves were subject; and he asked his pupils to
  imagine their feelings if someone came to them reporting that their Master,
  Epictetus, had been forced to succumb.</p>

  <p>"If," said he, very slowly and deliberately, with emphasis on each
  syllable, "if someone were to come and tell you that a certain man was
  compelling <i>me</i>"&mdash;here he hurried onward&mdash;"to lead the sort of
  life that you are now leading, to wear the sort of dress that you wear, to
  perfume mjrself as you perfume yourself, would you not go off straightway and
  lay violent hands on the man that was thus abusing me? Rescue yourself, then,
  as you would have rescued me. You need not kill anyone, strike anyone, go
  anjrwhere. Talk to yourself! Persuade (who else should do it
  better?)&mdash;persuade yourself!"</p>

  <p>Never, in my experience, had Epictetus more nearly fulfilled the promise
  made in his behalf by Arrian&mdash;that he would alwajrs make his hearers
  feel, for the moment, precisely what he wished them to feel. There were two
  or three in the class notorious for their profligacy; but the appeal went
  home to others as well, conscious of minor derelictions. "Persuade yourself!"
  There was no need of it. We were all, to a man, already persuaded. Infants
  and babies though we were, we could all stand up and walk&mdash;for the
  moment. He proceeded in the same spirit-stirring tone, as though&mdash;now
  that we had all resolved to go on this arduous journey with him as a
  guide&mdash;he would go first and show us how to push our way through the
  forest.</p>

  <p>"First of all," said he, "give sentence against the present state of
  things." He did not say <i>"against yourselves."</i> That would have been too
  discouraging. We were to condemn <i>"the present state of things"</i>; that
  is, our present self. "In the next place," he continued, "do not give up hope
  of yoursel£ Do not behave like the poor-spirited creatures who, because of
  one defeat, give themselves up altogether and let themselves be carried
  downward by the stream. Take a lesson from the wrestling-ring. That young
  fellow yonder has had a fall. 'Get up,' says the trainer, 'Wrestle again, and
  go on till you get your full strength.' Act you in the same spirit. For, mark
  you, there is nothing more pliable than the human soul. You must will. Then
  the thing is done, and the crooked is made straight. On the other hand, go to
  sleep; and then all is ruined. From your own heart comes either your
  destruction or your help."</p>

  <p>He concluded with a word of warning. Perhaps some of us might appeal to
  his own <i>dictum</i> about seeking our own "profit" as being the only right
  and wise course. He met it as follows: "After this, do you say 'What good
  shall I get by it?' What greater 'good' do you look for than this? Whereas
  you once were shameless, you will now have received again the faculty of an
  honourable shame. From the orgies of vice you will have passed into the ranks
  of virtue. Formerly faithless and licentious, you will now be faithful and
  temperate. If you seek any other objects better than these, go on doing still
  the things you are doing now. Not even a God can any longer save you."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. &mdash; ARRIAN'S DEPARTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN we came out from the crowded room, as Arrian was
  nowhere to be seen, I went at once to his lodging. To my surprise, he was
  busy packing, amid books and papers, and a student's other belongings.
  "Thanks, many thanks," he said, "for this timely visit. This is my last day
  in Nicopolis. I was just coming round to wish you good-bye. You know I had to
  go to Corinth. Well, when I got there, I found a letter from my &amp;ther
  bidding me wait a few days for further news from him; and on the fourth day
  came a message that I was to conclude my studies at once and return to
  Bith}aiia, as his health had quite given way and his affairs required all my
  attention. I had intended to start to-day at the fifth hour; but I have just
  learned that the vessel will not sail till the eighth. So sit down. Epictetus
  there is not time to call upon. When I write to you I shall ask you to
  deliver him a letter from me. Sit down, and begin by telling me about the
  lecture I have just missed, while it is fresh in your memory."</p>

  <p>When I had finished, he said, turning over the papers he was sorting, "I
  remember another of his lectures in which he warned us against a licentious
  and effeminate life. Here it is, and these are his exact words: 'Do not, in
  the name of the Gods, do not you, young man, fall back again! Nay, rather go
  back to your home and say, now that you have once heard this warning. <i>It
  is not Epictetus that has said this. How should he? It is some God wishing
  well to me and speaking through him. It would never have corns into the mind
  of Epictetus to say this, for it is never his custom to make personal
  appeals. Come, then, let its obey the voice of God, lest we fall under God's
  wrath!</i>' I have never forgotten these words, and I trust I never shall. I
  think a God speaks through Epictetus. Do you not agree with me?"</p>

  <p>"I do indeed," said I, "but I am not convinced that God speaks all that
  Epictetus says, and that there is not more to be spoken. For example, he
  says, 'You have but to will and it is done.' Is that a common experience? Is
  it yours? He says, 'Take from yourself the help you need.' Do you find in
  yourself all the help you need? When you fall, he says, 'Get up,' as though
  we were boys in the wrestling-ring. But what if we have been'stunned? What if
  one's ankle is sprained or a leg broken? Do you remember what you said to me
  at the end of my first lecture,'Will itlast?' You also said that Epictetus
  could make us feel just what he wished us to feel&mdash;as long as he was
  speaking. Well, while I was sitting on the bench in the lecture-room, I felt
  that getting up from vice was as easy as sitting on that bench. When I walked
  out, it began to seem less easy. Now that I am quite away from the enchanter,
  talking the matter quietly over with you, the feeling has almost vanished;
  and I am obliged to repeat your question about this, and about much more of
  our Master's doctrine, VWill it last?'"</p>

  <p>"Some of it will last," said Arrian, "We must not expect impossibilities.
  I have heard him admit that it is impossible to be sinless already, but he
  bade us remember that it is possible to be always intent on not sinning."</p>

  <p>"Did he mean," asked I, "by 'already,' that we could not be sinless in
  this life, but that we might be sinless at what he calls the feast of the
  Gods, after death?"</p>

  <p>Arrian did not at once reply. Presently he said, "I do not think so. I
  believe he meant that we must not expect to be sinless as soon as we have
  reached the intermediate stage of what he calls 'the half-educated man.' We
  must wait till we have reached the further stage, that of complete education,
  where, as you said just now, a man never blames himself, because he does not
  find in himself any fault that he could blame."</p>

  <p>Here Arrian made a still longer pause. Then he continued, in his usual
  slow, deliberate way, but with a touch of hesitation that was not usual with
  him, "I have here a few duplicates of my notes. Among them are some on the
  subject on which your remarks bear, and about which (I gather) you would like
  to question me&mdash;the immortality of the soul. In my hearing, he has
  seldom used that precise phrase. And, when he has used the epithet
  'immortal,' it has generally applied to life like that of Tithonus&mdash;I
  mean, a deathless life in this present world. To desire such a life,
  deathless and free from disease, he thinks unreasonable. But I remember his
  saying once, that he was prepared for death, <i>'whether it were the death of
  the whole or of a certain part'</i>&mdash;that was his expression. And I
  think he may possibly believe that the Logos within us is reabsorbed, after
  death, into some kind of quintessential or divine fire from which it sprang.
  But I cannot say that this satisfies me."</p>

  <p>Neither did it satisfy me. But I said nothing. Arrian, too, was silent,
  turning over some of his papers and marking passages for my perusal. But
  presently, rousing himself, "Did you agree with me," he said, "about the
  passage you transcribed, when we last met, concerning that sect of the Jews
  which he called the Galilaeans?" I could see that Arrian wished to divert the
  conversation to "the Galilaeans," as being a subject of a less serious
  character than the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. But the subject
  of the Galilaeans or Jews had become much more serious for me now than it had
  been when we last conversed together. How much more, I shrank from telling
  him, in the few minutes at our disposal. He was good, just, a truthful
  scholar, a gentleman, and a kind friend. Given a few days more&mdash;even a
  few hours&mdash;in one another's company, and I should not have kept my
  secret from him. But how could I hope, in so brief an interval, and amid so
  many preoccupations, to make him understand what a vast continent of new
  history, religion, literature&mdash;and, above all, "feeling" as opposed to
  "logic"&mdash;had emerged before my mind's eye, during my recent voyages of
  exploration in the scriptures and in Paul's epistles? So I replied briefly
  that I agreed with his view.</p>

  <p>"Epictetus," I said, "seemed to me to be speaking, not of the [...]
  'feeling' (?) as also in the case of the Jews. "And, indeed, I added, "the
  force of this 'feeling'(?)[...] appears to me most remarkable."</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "I feel we shall hardly meet again in Nicopolis. But I
  shall always cherish the recollection of the hours we have spent together
  here, and of our common respect of our common Master whom you already love,
  and whom, if you were to know him as I do&mdash;in his home, and in his
  kindness to those who need kindness&mdash;you will (I trust) love still
  more." "I do love him," said I, "But tell me, do you Iove a11 his teaching
  about indifference to what is happening? You know how our Master scoffs as
  the agony of Priam looking on the ruin of Troy. Well, suppose you were a
  Roman citizen, as I am sure you will be before long. Or, rather, suppose you
  were our new Emperor Hadrian, and saw the northern barbarians not only at our
  gates but inside our walls, and the City in flame, and the Dacians doing in
  Rome what the Greeks did in Troy to the Trojan men and women, would you, our
  Elmperor Hadrian, feel it right to say, 'All this is nothing to me'?" "By the
  immortal Gods," exclaimed Arrian, "I should not." "And if Epictetus were in
  Hadrian's place, or Priam's place, do you think he could say it?"</p>

  <p>I had to wait for an answer. "What I am going to say," he replied at last.
  "may seem to you monstrous. But I really cannot reply No. I cannot tell what
  he would say. I am not able to judge him as I should judge others." Then he
  proceeded, with an animation quite imusual in him, "Of any other Hadrian or
  Priam I should say that such an utterance stamped him as either liar, or
  beast, or stone. But Epictetus&mdash;absorbed in Zeus, devoted to His will,
  resolved to believe that His will is good, and seeing no way out of the
  belief that all things happen in accordance with His will&mdash;might not
  Epictetus conceivably feel, in moments of ecstasy, that all these fires and
  furies, massacres and outrages, cannot prevent him from believing in Zeus and
  being one with Zeus, so that he himself, Epictetus, might be, nay, must be,
  in the bosom of Zeus (so to speak) at the very moment when not only Rome, but
  all the cities, villages, and hamlets of the world&mdash;nay, when the
  universe itself was being cast into destruction? Well, I am out of my depth.
  I confess it. But will you not agree with me thus far, that <i>if</i>
  Epictetus said that he felt thus, he would really feel thus?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied I, "I am sure that he would not say it unless he felt it.
  But I am not sure that he might not feel it merely because he had forced
  himself to feel it. However, let us say no more now on such subtle matters.
  It is no small help to have been lifted up by such a teacher above the mere
  life of the flesh. We part, do we not, in fiill agreement that Epictetus has
  been, for both of us, a guide to that which is good? " And thus we did part.
  I accompanied him to the quay. "May we meet again," were my last words. "May
  it be soon," were his. But we never met. The death of his father plunged him
  almost immediately into domestic cares and matters of business. When the
  pressure of private affairs relaxed, it was soon followed by affairs of
  state. This was due in part perhaps to his having been a pupil of Epictetus.
  The new emperor, long before he became emperor, had always admired our
  Master; whose recommendation (I am inclined to think) had something to do
  with Arrian s subsequent promotions. At all events, when I was on service in
  the north, I heard without any surprise, and with a great deal of pleasure,
  that my former fellow-student&mdash;known now to literary circles as
  Flavianus, a Roman citizen, and author of the Memoirs of Epictetus&mdash;had
  been appointed governor of Cappadocia.</p>

  <p>From time to time we corresponded. But it was not upon the topics that
  used to engross us in old days. He took a great interest in geography.
  Military service, at one time in the north and then in the east, gave me some
  knowledge of this subject, which I was glad to place at his disposal. He also
  studied military affairs with a view to writing on Alexander. Here again I
  was of use to him. But we never resumed in our letters that subject about
  which he had once said to me, "More of this to-morrow." Our paths had
  branched off, leading us far away from each other in everything except mutual
  good will and respect. He had become a Roman magistrate. Subsequently he was
  a priest of Demeter. I had become a Roman soldier, but&mdash;a Christian.
  Many of my fiiends knew this and I have little doubt that Arrian guessed it.
  Privately I feel sure he always loved me. OflScially he must have been forced
  to disapprove. Hadrian, it is true, discouraged informations against the
  Christians, and I had been hitherto connived at: but could I condemn my old
  friend if he shrank from opening up old speculations that might lead him into
  unofficial, suspected, and dangerous results? Much more might I myself rather
  feel condemned for keeping silence. Sometimes I have felt thus. But not
  often. More often I feel that it was better for him not to know what I know,
  than to know it, in a sense, and to reject it. Presented in mere writing, I
  felt sure that it would have been rejected. Writings and books brought me on
  the way to Christ, but something more was needed to make me receive
  Christ.</p>

  <p>Arrian, I think, avoided such opportunities as presented themselves for
  meeting. I am sure I did. If we had met, surely I should have been
  constrained to open my mind to him. Once, at least, I touched (in a letter)
  on our old conversation about "logos" and "pathos." He replied that, in his
  new career, both "logos" and "pathos" had to give place to pragmata,
  "business," which, he thought, was likely to take up all his energies during
  the rest of his life.</p>

  <p>Even if I had opened my mind, I cannot help thinking that his would have
  remained unchanged. One thing, however, I do not think about, but
  know&mdash;namely, that, if we had met, Arrian and I would still have had
  common ground, as of old, in our love of truth and justice, and that we
  should still have esteemed, respected, and loved each other. For myself, love
  him I always shall, not for his own sake alone, but also because he helped me
  directly and immediately to understand Epictetus, and indirectly and
  ultimately to perceive the existence of something beyond any truth that
  Epictetus could teach.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">X. &mdash; EPICTETUS ON DEATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RETURNING to my rooms, I sat down to think out my problems
  alone. Presently, on taking up the lecture-notes Arrian had given me, I found
  that the title of the first was, "What is meant by being in desolation or
  deserted? And who can call himself deserted?" The subject suited my mood, and
  I began to read it, as follows; "Desolation is the condition of a man
  unhelped. To be alone is not necessarily to be deserted. To be in the midst
  of a multitude is not always to be undeserted. A man may be in the centre of
  a crowd of his own slaves. But still, if he has just lost a brother, he may
  be deserted. We may travel alone, yet never feel deserted till we fall into
  the midst of a band of robbers. It is not the face of a man that delivers us
  from desolation; it is the presence of someone faithful and trustworthy,
  thoughtful and kind, good and helpful."</p>

  <p>I liked this. But afterwards the lecture strayed into what seemed to me
  controversial theology or metaphysics, "If being alone suffices to make you
  deserted, then say that Zeus Himself is deserted when the final fire comes
  round in its cycle, consuming the universe. Say that He bewails His
  loneliness exclaiming 'Alas, me miserable! I have no Hera now! No Athene! No
  Apollo! Not a single brother, son, or relation! 'Some people actually do
  assert that Zeus behaves like this in the final fire!" I gathered that he was
  attacking some philosophic tenet. But it did not interest me any more than
  his subsequent assertion&mdash;or rather assumption&mdash;that "Zeus
  associates with Himself, reposes on Himself, and contemplates the nature of
  His own administration." I have never felt drawn towards the conception of a
  self-admiring, or a solitary God.</p>

  <p>Arrian's next note bore on the peace of the universe, a peace proclaimed
  by the Logos, a peace resembling, but far surpassing, the peace proclaimed by
  the Emperor, such a peace that every man can say, even when he is alone,
  "Henceforth no evil can befall me. For me, robbers and earthquakes have no
  existence. All things are full of peace, full of tranquillity. Whether I am
  travelling on the high road, or living in the city, whether in public
  assemblies or among private friends and neighbours, nothing can harm me.
  There is Another, not myself, who makes it His care to supply me with food.
  He it is that clothes me. He, not myself, gave me the perceptions of my body.
  He, not myself, bestowed on me the conceptions of my mind."</p>

  <p>Then followed a passage about death, which Arrian, during our last
  conversation, had marked for my special attention: <i>"But if at any moment
  He ceases to supply you with the things needful for your existence, then take
  heed! In that moment He is sounding the bugle for you to cease the conflict.
  He is saying to you: 'Come!' And whither? Into no land of terrors. Simply
  into that same region from which you entered into being. Into the company of
  such eadstences as are friendly and akin to you. Into the elements. Such part
  as was fire in you will depart into fire; such part of earth as was in you,
  into earth; such part of air or wind as was in you, into air or wind; of
  water, into water. No Hades! No Acheron! No Cocytus! No Pyriphlegethon! All
  things are full of Gods and daemons!"</i> By this I think he meant "good Gods
  and guardian angels." He concluded thus, <i>"Having such thoughts as these in
  his heart, looking up to the sun, the moon, and the stars, and enjoying the
  earth and the sea, man has no more right to call himself deserted than to
  call himself unhelped."</i></p>

  <p>It was not clear to me how I could continue to call myself "helped" when I
  was on the point of being dissolved into the four elements. If I were a
  criminal, successful in escaping punishment on earth, I might deem it "help"
  (after a fashion) to know that I should be equally successful after quitting
  the earth, because I need not fear Hades and its three rivers as enemies. But
  where were the "friends"? The four elements promised but cold friendship!
  Arrian's comment rose to my mind, and a second time I assented to it, "I
  cannot say that this satisfies me." Epictetus was so averse from anything
  like cant or insincerity of expression that I was amazed&mdash;as I still am
  &mdash;that he could use, in such a context, the words "friendly and akin."
  Surely Sappho's cry was truer, when she wandered alone through the woods
  where she had once been loved by Phaon&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"This place is now dead dust. He was its life."</p>

  <p>What would it profit that my "fiery part" should return to fire? It might
  as well go astray into water, or earth, or into extinction, as far as I
  cared. To be still loved would have been to be still in some kind of home.
  But who would love my four elements? I should be "not I," but only four
  severed portions of what had once been "I," fragments incapable even of
  mourning, wandering among "dead dust," no better than "dead dust "
  themselves! How infinitely should I have preferred that Epictetus&mdash;if he
  could not honestly accept the confident hope of Socrates concerning a life
  after death,&mdash;should have said simply this, "As to what Zeus does with
  our souls after death, others think they know much. I know nothing, except
  that He does what is best."</p>

  <p>Reviewing passages in which Epictetus had mentioned the "soul," I was more
  perplexed than ever. For in those he distinctly recognised the <i>"soul"</i>
  as <i>"better than the flesh"</i> or <i>"better than the body"</i> and as
  using the body as its instrument. When, therefore, he spoke of God as saying
  to man, "Come!" he ought to have supposed God to be addressing <i>the whole
  man, soul as well as body, or perhaps the soul alone</i>, (using the body, or
  the flesh, as its instrument). But if God said to the human soul "Come!" how
  could He go on to say "Such part as was fire in you" and so on, just as
  though we knew, without proof, that the soui was composed of nothing but
  fire, earth, air and water? We knew no such thing. On the contrary, Epictetus
  continually assumed that we have within ourselves "mind" and "<i>logos</i>."
  He also said that "The being of God" is "mind, knowledge, right
  <i>logos</i>." Now he could hardly suppose that "mind" and "logos" were
  composed of fire, earth, air, and water. For my part, I did not feel that I
  knew anything certain about the distinctions between "mind," "soul," "logos"
  and "I." But those who made distinctions appeared to me under an obligation
  to say what they meant by them.</p>

  <p>It appeared to me that our Master had been inconsistent. As a rule, he
  dealt with each of us as having a soul that was our real self, and a body
  that was the tool of the soul. "Tyrants," he would say, "can hurt your
  <i>body</i> but they cannot hurt <i>you</i>!" Might not a pupil of his go on
  consistently to say: "Death can kill your body but it cannot kill you"? This,
  at all events, was what Socrates meant, when he said, "As for me, Meletus
  could not hurt me... He might kill, or banish, or degrade," for he certainly
  meant "kill" the <i>body</i>, not "kill" the <i>soul</i>.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, when I came to read the Christian gospels,, I found two of
  them making this distinction in the words, "Be not afraid of them that kill
  the body." One of them added: "but cannot kill the soul," the other added
  "but cannot do anything more." Then I understood more clearly why Epictetua
  said nothing about what became of the soul after death. For these two
  Christian writers spoke of a possibility that the soul might be "destroyed in
  hell" or "cast into hell." Now this was. just what Epictetus did not himself
  believe, and wished to make others disbelieve. He preferred to give up the
  belief of Socrates that the good "go to the islands of the blessed" after
  death,, rather than believe also that the bad go to a place of the accursed.
  Hence he dropped all thought of the essential part, or parts, of man, namely,
  the soul, mind, and <i>logos</i>, as soon as he came to speak of man's
  death.</p>

  <p>The consequence was that Epictetus confused us by an ambiguous use of
  "<i>you</i>." As long as we were alive he said to us, "<i>You</i> must regard
  your body as a mere tool," where by "you" he meant the incorporeal part of
  man. As soon as we were on the point of death, he said to us, "Do not be
  alarmed. <i>You</i> are going into the four elements," where by "you" he
  apparently meant our corporeal part. I felt sure then (as I do now) that he
  did not intend to confuse us. He seemed to me to have been confused by his
  own intense desire to persuade himself that men must do good without hope of
  any reward at all except the consciousness of doing good in this present
  life. I had not at that time read the Christian gospels; but several passages
  in Paul's epistles occurred to me as contrary to this doctrine of Epictetus,
  and I thought that our Master might have been biassed in part by Paul (as
  Scaurus had suggested)&mdash;only not, in this instance, imitating Paul, but
  contradicting him. So I took up the epistle to the Romans intending to read
  what Paul said there about Christ's death and resurrection.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; ISAIAH ON DEATH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I TOOK up the epistle to the Romans, but I did not read it
  long. Another subject stepped in to claim immediate attention in the first
  words on which I lighted. They were these, "Isaiah cries aloud on behalf of
  Israel, <i>Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea,
  the remnant [alone] shall be saved,</i>" and then, "Even as Isaiah has
  foretold, <i>If the Lord of Sabaoth had not left seed to us, we should have
  become as Sodom and should have been made like unto Gomorrah.</i>" Previously
  when I had read these words I could neither understand them nor see the way
  to understand them, not knowing the meaning of "Sodom" and "Gomorrah," nor
  even "Isaiah." But now, knowing that Isaiah was one of the principal Hebrew
  prophets, I began to see that many obscure passages of Paul might become
  clearer to me if I first studied this prophet. This view was confirmed when I
  found Paul, later on, quoting him again, "But Isaiah is very bold and says,
  <i>I was found by them that sought me not, I became manifest to them that
  consulted me not</i>; but with reference to Israel he says, <i>All the day
  long, I stretched out my hands to a people disobedient and gainsaying</i>."
  The name also occurred toward the close of the epistle thus, "Isaiah says:
  <i>There shall be the root of Jesse, and he that is raised up to rule over
  the nations; on him shall the nations set their hope</i>." These last words
  reminded me of the doctrine of Epictetus about Diogenes "to whom are
  entrusted the peoples of the earth and countless cares in their behalf."</p>

  <p>But I did not know what "root of Jesse" meant. The name, "Jesse," I
  faintly remembered reading in the poems of David; but where it was I could
  not recall. Hence the phrase was obscure. I determined to put off the further
  study of Paul for the present, and to glance through the book of Isaiah in
  the hope of meeting this and other passages quoted above. Accordingly I
  unrolled the prophecy and began to read it from the beginning.</p>

  <p>At first, the language was clear&mdash;though the Greek was as bad as in
  the poems of David. The "children" of God, said the prophet (meaning the
  ancient Jews or Hebrews, whom he often spoke of as "Israel") had rebelled
  against their Father and were being punished with fire and sword by hostile
  nations executing God's vengeance on their impiety. Then came the sentence I
  quoted above, from Paul, about the "remnant." After this, the prophet
  introduced "the Lord"&mdash;that is the God of the Jews&mdash;as saying that
  He cared no longer for their incense or their offerings because they came
  from hands stained with blood. This was somewhat like the saying of Horace
  about Phidyle mentioned above. But what followed was not like anything in
  Horace: "Wash you, make you clean ; cease to do evil, learn to do good; seek
  judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fetherless, plead for the widow."
  If they would act thus, then, said God, "though your sins be red as scarlet,
  they shall be as white as snow." As though the nation were molten metal in a
  crucible, and He Himself were refining them with fire, the Lord said to the
  whole people of Israel, "I will purge away thy dross... afterwards thou shalt
  be called the city of righteousness."</p>

  <p>I had begun to hope that I should be able to understand this author as
  easily as Euripides and much more easily than iEschylus. But now came
  obscurities. First I read of a golden age. People were to "beat their swords
  into ploughshares," and not to "learn war any more." Then I found a mention
  of general destruction as by a universal earthquake. Then came, without any
  chronological or other order apparent to me, the following pictures, or
  predictions:&mdash;a land without a ruler governed by children and women; a
  picture of luxurious ladies of rank, a list of their dresses, ornaments,
  jewels and cosmetics; a "branch of the Lord, beautiful and glorious"; a
  purifying with a "spirit of burning"; "a song of my beloved touching his
  vineyard"&mdash;all confused together (so it seemed to me at the time like
  the prophecies of the Sibyl.</p>

  <p>As far as I could see, most of these prophecies dealt with the internal
  corruption of the nation. The "vineyard" of the Lord was the people of
  Israel. When He visited the vineyard, looking for fruit, said the prophet,
  "He looked for judgment but behold oppression." After this, came a vision of
  the Lord's glory, and then predictions of external calamities, and invasions
  of foreign nations. But yet there was a promise of the birth of a Deliverer,
  a Prince of Peace, to sit "upon the throne of David." Following this, at some
  interval, were the words for which I was searching, about "the root of
  Jesse." And now I could understand them, for they were preceded by this
  prediction, "There shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a
  branch out of his roots shall bear fruit." Just before that, 'there had been
  a description of an invading army, coming as the instrument of the Lord's
  wrath and "lopping the boughs with terror" and hewing down "the high ones of
  stature."</p>

  <p>Then all was clear to me. I perceived the connexion between the "child"
  that was to sit on "the throne of David," and the "shoot out of the stock of
  Jesse." The two together brought back to my mind that passage which I could
  not before recall from the Psalms, "The prayers of David the son of Jesse are
  ended." The words of Isaiah were like those of Sophocles where he is speaking
  of the destruction of the royal house of Laius. Sophocles calls the surviving
  child the "root," and laments because the axe of Fate was destroying it just
  when a branch was on the point of "shooting up" from the "stock" so as to
  produce fruit. So now, but in an opposite mood of hope and joy, Isaiah said
  that the royal house of David the son of Jesse would not be exterminated,
  though many of its scions would be cut off. A "branch" would "shoot up" and
  the succession to the kingdom would be maintained.</p>

  <p>In the same way, I perceived, the great Julius, or the Emperor Augustus,
  being descended from lulus, the son of Aeneas, might be called "the shoot out
  of the stock of Anchises," transported from Asia to Europe so as to "shoot
  up" into a new kingdom more glorious than the old. This, too, explained the
  word "remnant" used by Paul. As the Trojan followers of Aeneas were a
  "remnant," so too must be the Jewish followers of this " child," a remnant
  left from defeat, disaster, and captivity, after a great "lopping of the
  boughs with terror." Virgil sang about the empire of the house of lulus not
  as a prophet, but as a poet, prophesying, so to speak, after the event.
  Isaiah appeared merely to predict empire as a prophet, and a false prophet,
  prophesying what had not been, and never would be, an "event." The tree of
  the empire of Rome was erect for all the world to look on. The tree of the
  kingdom of Jesse appeared to me as extinct as the house of Laius. So I
  thought then.</p>

  <p>Yet I knew that Paul looked at the matter differently and regarded these
  prophecies as having been, or as about to be, fulfilled. And when I looked
  more closely into the sayings of Isaiah about the future kingdom, I saw that
  many of them were capable of two meanings. Sometimes the prophet appeared to
  be contemplating a kingdom established in the ordinary way by force of
  arms&mdash;a conquest achieved, or at all events preceded, by fire, sword,
  and desolation. But, for the most part, it seemed to be an empire of peace to
  be brought about by some kind of persuasion, or feeling. A sudden conviction
  was to take hold of all the nations of the earth, so that they were to
  exclaim, with one consent, as at the sound of a trumpet, "Come ye and let us
  go up to the mountain of the Lord," meaning the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>In this kingdom, however brought about, the Lord was to be King, and there
  was to be a "covenant" between Him and all the citizens or subjects, a
  covenant of righteousness. The subjects were to obey the King and the King
  would give them a righteous spirit. In some respects the covenant of
  obedience was to resemble that philosophic oath which Epictetus had enjoined
  on us, namely, to consult our own interests, to be true to ourselves
  (meaning, to the spirit of righteousness within us).</p>

  <p>But the prophet regarded righteousness as loyalty, or truth, not to
  ourselves, but to our King.</p>

  <p>That seemed to me one great difference between the Greeks and the Hebrews
  in their notions of worship. The Greeks, when they lifted their thoughts
  above themselves, looked, in the first place, each man to his several city,
  and in the next place, to the Gods. They did not think in the first place of
  the Gods. For the Gods were many, while the City was one. But the ancient
  Jews, the men of Israel, or at least their prophets, looked to their Lord God
  as their King&mdash;the Father, or sometimes the Husband, of Israel. Although
  they were many tribes, they had but one God, the Lord God, who had delivered
  them from the land of Egypt. This Lord God was a God of justice and truth,
  hating oppression, a defender of the widow and the fiitherless. To be loyal
  to Him was righteousness.</p>

  <p>And herein&mdash;as I soon began to perceive&mdash;was the great
  difference between the view of righteousness or justice taken by Isaiah and
  that taken by our Roman lawyers, or any lawyers bound to a written law. The
  lawyer's righteousness was legality; the prophet's was loyalty. Epictetus and
  Isaiah agreed together in aiming at loyalty, not legality. Both disliked
  obedience paid to mere rules and commandments of men. But the former for the
  most part inculcated loyalty that seemed like loyalty to oneself; the latter,
  loyalty to God. This precept of Isaiah agreed with the fundamental law
  prescribed in the code of Moses that the men of Israel were to "love" the
  Lord their God.</p>

  <p>After searching carefully to see what the prophet said concerning the
  immortality of the soul (about which Moses seemed to be silent) I could find
  little of a definite kind. In one passage I read "The dead shall arise and
  they that are in the tombs shall be roused up." But the preceding lines said
  "The dead shall assuredly not see life"; so that it was not clear whether the
  words meant that one nation should be destroyed for ever and another nation
  should be raised up from destruction to life. The prophet appeared to be
  thinking of the nation collectively, more often than of separate citizens.
  The metaphor of the Vine of Israel seemed to be almost always in his
  thoughts. And his hope seemed to be, not concerning separate branches, that
  every branch should remain; but that, in spite of being cruelly pruned and
  cut down almost to the ground, the tree, as a whole, would yet grow up and
  bear fruit. I noticed also that a certain king ccdled Hezekiah, when praying
  to be delivered from a disease likely to prove ioXaX, spoke as though there
  were no life after death.</p>

  <p>But there was one passage, of very mysterious import, which seemed to
  point to a different conclusion. It spoke about a "servant of God," of mean
  aspect but destined to be a great Deliverer&mdash;such as Epictetus had
  described&mdash;"bearing upon him the cares" of multitudes. He was to grow up
  "as a root in the thirsty ground," which suggested that he was to be "the
  root of Jesse" above mentioned. But he was not to be like Aeneas, "the root"
  of Anchises. For Aeneas divided the spoils in Italy as the prize of his
  sword. But this Deliverer&mdash;so the prophet declared&mdash;was "despised
  and reckoned as naught." He was "delivered over" to the enemies of his nation
  as a ransom to save his fellow-countrymen, and it was by their wickedness
  that "he was led to death." Yet in the end, said the prophet, "He will
  inherit many men, and will divide the spoils of the strong, because his soul
  was delivered over to death, and he was reckoned among criminals, and he
  carried the sins of many and he was delivered over on account of their
  crimes."</p>

  <p>This was altogether beyond my comprehension at the time. But I saw that I
  should have to return to this prophecy hereafter; for I recognised its last
  words as having been quoted by Paul in writing to the Romans. I found
  afterwards that the passage in Paul spoke about "believing in Him that raised
  up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who <i>was delivered over for the sake of
  our transgressions</i>, and was raised up for the sake of our being made
  righteous." For the present, however, the passage in Isaiah about the
  "servant" of God seemed to me important, for this reason mainly, because it
  indicated a belief in a life after death. And so did another difficult
  passage&mdash;if Paul had interpreted it rightly. My copy of the prophecy
  said, "Death by its strength hath swallowed up"; but the margin said: "Death
  is swallowed up in victory," and these latter words, too, I recognised as
  being quoted by Paul; and this, or some similar, sense appeared to be
  required by the context.</p>

  <p>It was growing late and I was obliged to break oflF. But I resolved to
  return to the book next morning before lecture. So far as I had read, it
  appeared to me that the prophet did not formally recognise the immortality of
  the soul in general. But in the case of the Suffering Servant he did seem to
  recognise it. Having the Servant in my mind, I unrolled the book of Isaiah to
  other passages using the same word, such as, "for my <i>servant</i> David's
  sake," "But thou, Israel, art my <i>servant</i>." "My <i>servant</i> whom I
  have chosen." At last I came to "the seed of Abraham my <i>friend</i>." In
  all these passages, God was supposed to be speaking. Then it occurred to me,
  "Did the prophet make an exception for the Suffering Servant only? Did he not
  also believe that Abraham's soul was immortal?" It seemed to me impossible
  that if the God of the Jews were asked, "Where is Abraham thy friend?" He
  would reply&mdash;or that the prophet would regard Him as
  replying&mdash;"Resolved into the four elements." On the whole, I was led to
  the conclusion that Isaiah implied, though he did not express, some kind of
  doctrine of human immortality dependent on the relation between man and
  God.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">XII. &mdash; ISAIAH ON PROVIDENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVEN when I was in the act of rolling up the book of Isaiah,
  very late at night, it occurred to me that the question "Is there a life
  after death?" might be connected with another, "Is there to be hereafter a
  reign of righteousness?" I tried to give my mind rest by thinking of other
  things; but this second question came back to me again and again both before
  and after I retired to rest. Epictetus spoke about "the sceptre and throne of
  Diogenes ": but I knew he would not assert that the philosopher's "sceptre"
  implied any present kingdom except over his own mind and the minds of a small
  band of Cynics&mdash;small in comparison with Stoics and Epicureans, and
  nothing at all in comparison with the non-philosophic myriads. As for a
  kingdom of righteousness after death in another world, I was now certain that
  Epictetus did not expect it; and I began to doubt whether he expected such a
  kingdom at any time in this world. If to believe in Providence means to
  believe in a God who foresees and prepares that which is best&mdash;I could
  not understand where Epictetus could find a basis for such a belief</p>

  <p>With the Jews, it was otherwise. They, I could see, had received a special
  training, which made them, more than any other nation known to me, begin by
  expecting a reign of righteousness on earth. Beginning thus, and being
  largely disappointed, they might be led on to expect a reign of righteousness
  in heaven. Their history was like a collection of stories for children,
  teeming with what a child might call surprises, but a prophet
  judgments&mdash;evil, uppermost, suddenly cast down; humble patient goodness,
  chastened by pains and trials, lifted up to lordship over its past
  oppressors. Examples occurred to me before I slept, and many more during the
  night, in my waking moments. I had not noticed them so clearly when reading
  the Law consecutively. Now, grouped together, they came almost as a new
  revelation&mdash;if not of history, at all events of legend, and of a
  nation's thoughts, and of the training through which the Jew Paul must have
  passed in his childhood and youth.</p>

  <p>First, there was Abraham&mdash;Abraham the homeless, going out from
  unbelievers to worship the one God, and receiving a promise that he should be
  the father of blessing, for multitudes in all the nations of the earth;
  Abraham the childless, rewarded with the child of promise; Abraham the kind
  and yielding, who gave way to his kinsman Lot, so that the older patriarch
  was content with the inferior pastures while the younger chose the fertile
  lands of Sodom and Gomorrah; Abraham the father of the one child that
  embodied the truth of the one God, offering up that child on the altar, and
  receiving him back as if from Hades; Abraham the landless, without a foot of
  ground in the land promised to him, bujdng with money a cave to bury his
  family. "Surely," I said, "the story of Abraham, in itself, is a compendium
  of national history not indeed for Rome, but for a nation of peace (if only
  the nation could live up to it!) most fit for training a child to become a
  citizen in the City of Righteousness!"</p>

  <p>If the life of Abraham was full of surprises or paradoxes, so too were the
  lives of the other patriarchs and leaders of the nation. Isaac, "laughter,"
  laid himself down to die in appearance, but to "laugh" at death in reality.
  Esau was the "elder," yet he was to "serve the younger." Jacob was promised
  lordship over his brother in the future, but he bowed down before him in the
  present. The same patriarch, a poor man, with nothing but his "staff," became
  rich and prosperous. Yet, because he had deceived his father, he in turn was
  deceived by his children and sorely tried by their contentions. Through
  Samuel, the little child, God rebuked Eli the high priest; and the little one
  became the prophet and judge of Israel. David, the despised and youngest of
  many brethren, became the greatest of IsraeFs kings.</p>

  <p>Such was the history of the great men of the ancient Jews&mdash;tried, but
  triumphing over trial. On the other hand, the history of the mass of the
  common people, from the time when they were a family of twelve sons, showed
  them as going astray, lying, quarrelling and rebelling. For this they were
  punished by plagues and enemies; then, delivered by judges or prophets; but
  only, as it seemed, again to fall away, and to be delivered again; so that
  the reader of the histories, apart from the prophecies, might well suppose
  that these ebbs and flows were to go on for ever; that Israel was to be
  always imperfect, always liable to rebellion; and that the promise to Abraham
  was never to be fulfilled. More especially might a reader of the histories
  anticipate this when he saw the great empires of the east, Assyria and
  Babylon, leading the tribes away into captivity and destroying Jerusalem and
  the Temple.</p>

  <p>Such were my thoughts by night concerning the Law and the Histories of
  Israel. Resuming the study of the prophecy early next morning, I perceived
  that in the sins and backslidings of the people there was yet another and far
  deeper illustration of what might be called "the law of paradoxes." Not only
  came prosperity out of adversity but also righteousness out of sin, and out
  of punishment promise. Some of Isaiah's most comforting prophecies arose from
  the invasion of Israel by Assyria. In this connexion there came a promise
  about a "child" that was to be "born," of whom it was said "the government
  shall be upon his shoulder." These things reminded me of passages in the
  poems, where the poet&mdash;musing on the chastisements and deliverances that
  followed the sins of Israel&mdash;exclaims "His mercy endureth for ever," or
  "I remember the days of old, I meditate on all thy doings." In the history of
  Greece and Rome I could find comparatively few stories of such "doings." How
  indeed could I reasonably expect them? Romans and Greeks worship many Gods,
  but only one Father of Gods and men. Athens might claim Athene, and other
  cities might have their special patrons among the Gods. But how could it be
  supposed that the Father of Gods and men would make any one nation His
  peculiar care? Virgil says that Venus was on the side of the future Rome, and
  that Jupiter favoured Venus; but Juno intervenes for Carthage. Then Jupiter
  has to compromise between Juno and Venus, or to conciliate Juno by lajdng the
  blame on fate! "How dififerent," I exclaimed, "all this is from the Hebrew
  egotism that represents the one God as continually saying to Israel 'Thee
  have I chosen'!"</p>

  <p>Yet I had hardly uttered the word "egotism" before I felt inclined to
  qualify it, adding, "But it is not 'egotism' from Paul's point of view." For
  indeed Paul seemed to think that God chose Abraham, not for Abraham's own
  sake&mdash;or at all events not merely for Abraham's own sake&mdash;but for
  the sake of "all the nations of the earth," to bring light and truth to them.
  Epictetus spoke of Diogenes as "bearing on himself the orb of the world's
  vast cares." Somewhat similarly&mdash;when I took up the Law of the Jews to
  revise the thoughts that had come to me in the night&mdash;I found the Law
  describing the life of Abraham the friend of God. For I did not find Abraham
  blessed or happy&mdash;as the world would use the terms "blessing" and
  "happiness."</p>

  <p>Abraham begins as a homeless wanderer, going forth from his kindred at the
  bidding of the one true God; and a homeless wanderer he remains to the end.
  He is a father of kings but no king himself, not even a landowner ! He has to
  buy with money land enough to bury his dead! His life is one of intercession
  as well as concession. Abraham intercedes for the dwellers in Sodom and
  Gomorrah, feeling it a painful thing that even a few righteous should suffer
  with the many. Once indeed Abraham becomes a soldier. But it is not for
  himself. It is for his kinsman and for the rescue of captives. Abraham makes
  himself a servant, waiting at table upon his guests. Abraham offers to God
  the life of his only son. If Paul was right, and if the children of Abraham
  mean the men that do such things as these in such a spirit as this, and if
  "the seed of Abraham" is the man that incarnates this spirit, then, I
  thought, there was perhaps no egotism when the prophet of Israel represented
  God as saying to the descendant of Abraham, "Thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob
  whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend." For it may mean "I have
  not chosen the rich, I have not chosen the great and strong. I have chosen
  the good and kind and truthful and courageous; him only have I chosen." And
  soon afterwards God says, "I have chosen thee in the furnace of affiction,"
  that is to say, "I have not chosen thee to make thee selfishly happy and
  prosperous, but to make thee my servant, like Abraham, for the service of all
  the world."</p>

  <p>The same truth appeared to apply to Moses, who, next to Abraham, might be
  called the greatest of the "servants of the Lord." Even from the cradle he
  was in peril of death. He delivered his countrymen, as it were, against their
  will. The burden of their rebellions pressed on him through his life, and
  caused him to be cut oflF fix)m the land of promise in the moment of his
  death. He saw it from afar off but was not allowed to enter it. He was
  prohibited because of his sin; and his sin fell upon him because his people
  sinned. "The Lord was wroth with me," said Moses, "for your sakes." That was
  the greatest burden of all. With the lives of Abraham and Moses before me, it
  seemed that the greatest servants were also the greatest sufferers.</p>

  <p>Having this fresh light, I turned again to the description of the
  Suffering Servant in Isaiah. Did the prophet mean some particular prince of
  the house of David who was actually "chosen in the furnace of affliction" in
  order to deliver Israel? Or did he mean Israel itself, scattered through the
  world and aiSSicted in order that it might deliver the world? Plato modelled
  his Republic in the form of a man: had Isaiah any such double meaning? Did he
  predict a second David delivering sinful Israel, and also a purified Israel
  delivering a sinful world? Was he carried, so to speak, by the past into the
  future? That is to say, had he in mind some prince actually tortured and
  imprisoned, and as good as dead, for the sake of the people, and did the
  prophet regard this prince as destined to be raised up from the darkness of
  the prison house and to reign on earth? Or else was the prince, though
  actually killed, destined to be raised up and to reign after death in his own
  person, or to reign in the person of his descendants?</p>

  <p>About all these questions I felt that it was not for me to judge. I did
  not know enough about the history of the people and the language of their
  poets and prophets. But there remained with me this general truth, as being
  not only at the bottom of this prophecy, but also pervading the history of
  Israel, namely, that in order to make a great nation, great men must die for
  its sake. And I began to conceive a possibility that the greatest of all men,
  some real "son of Abraham "&mdash;I mean some spiritual son of Abraham, not
  necessarily a Jew&mdash;might arise in the history of the world, who might be
  willing to die not for one nation alone but for all the nations of the
  empire. But how? And against what enemies? As soon as I asked myself these
  questions, the conception faded away. I thought of Nero enthroned in Rome,
  and of the Beast enthroned in the heart of man. Against either of these foes
  I did not understand how the death of any "son of Abraham," or "servant of
  God," could avail. How could such a Servant "divide the spoils of the strong,
  because his soul was delivered over to death"? This was beyond me.</p>

  <p>For the rest, Isaiah appeared to me to carry on throughout the book of his
  prophecies that thread of unexpectedness about which I spoke above&mdash;I
  mean, that what prophets (foreseeing them) call judgments, men of the world
  (not foreseeing) call surprises. Yes, and even prophets and righteous
  men&mdash;not foreseeing enough&mdash;often lift up their hands in amazement,
  exclaiming, "This hath God wrought!" or "The stone that the builders rejected
  hath become the headstone of the comer!" But there was a dark as well as a
  bright side in these surprises. The disappointments were often most strange.
  For example, Isaiah saw a vision of the Lord "high and lifted up." But with
  what result? The prophet himself was straightway cast down with the thought
  of being "unclean." Even afterwards, when his lips had been cleansed with the
  coal from off the altar so that he might deliver God's message, the message
  was, "Hear ye, indeed, but understand not!"&mdash;because his warning was to
  be rejected. And so it was throughout, paradox on paradox! Israel was
  "chosen" in one sentence, "backsliding" in the next. The "despised and
  rejected" servant was to be "lifted up." The transgressions of the world were
  to be taken away by a deliverer, who was to be "reckoned among
  transgressors." Sometimes, as if despairing of the noble and learned among
  his own people, the prophet seemed to appeal to the poor and simple,
  according to the words of David, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
  hast thou ordained strength!" Sometimes he even seemed to turn away from
  Israel itself&mdash;at all events from the majority of the nation&mdash;to
  the remnant, and to the pious among other nations, as though they, yes, even
  foreigners, might receive the fulfilment of the promise made to the seed of
  Abraham!</p>

  <p>Amid all these (to me) perplexing paradoxes, one thing was clear&mdash;
  constituting a great diflference between Isaiah and Epictetus. The former saw
  God in history. The latter did not. Epictetus said (as I have shown in a
  previous chapter) that, up to the time of death, man can always find peace by
  following the "logos" within himself during life; after death he ceases to
  exist. "Bearing these things in mind," said he, "and seeing the sun and moon
  and stars, and enjojdng the earth and sea, man is not deserted any more than
  unhelped." These words now returned to my mind, and I perceived the force of
  what they did not say. They said that God was to be seen in the sun and moon
  and stars; but they did not say that He was to be seen where Isaiah saw Him,
  in the nations of the earth controlled by the Supreme. It is true that
  Isaiah, too&mdash;like Epictetus&mdash;bade his readers look up to the stars
  as witnesses to God. But Isaiah seemed to me to reckon men superior to
  stars.</p>

  <p>David certainly did so. David had "considered" all the glories of the
  visible heaven. Yet he counted them inferior to "man," who was "made but
  little lower than God," and inferior to the "son of man," who had received
  "dominion" over God's works. In the same spirit, Isaiah, as it seemed to me,
  spoke of the Maker of the heavenly bodies as being adorable, not because He
  had made them multitudinous and bright, but because He led them like a
  flock&mdash;as though even a star might wander but for the kindness of the
  divine Shepherd. Moreover God seemed to him to be controlling the mighty
  powers of the heaven for the service of man, <i>"Behold, the Lord, the Lord,
  He Cometh with strength, and His arm with lordship. Behold, His reward is
  with Him, and His work before Him, As a shepherd shall He shepherd His sheep,
  and with His arm He shall gather the lambs, and encourage those that are with
  young. Who measured out the water with His hand, and the heaven with a span,
  and all the earth with His fingers? Who established the mountains by measure
  and the valleys with a scale f Who hath known the mind of the Lord and who
  hath become His fellow counsellor so as to instruct Him?"</i></p>

  <p>Thus, according to the prophet, there was to be a great advent in which
  God was to "come" with "reward." He predicted a future "shepherding" of the
  "sheep" and "gathering" of the "lambs," corresponding to the past "measuring"
  of the "heaven." According to the philosopher there was to be na such future.
  All things were to go round and round. Instead of "sheep" or "lambs," bubbles
  in an eddy seemed a more appropriate metaphor to describe the results of
  human life in accordance with the general tendency of Epictetian
  doctrine.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">XIII. &mdash; EPICTETUS ON PROVIDENCE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was now almost the third hour and I was on the point of
  rolling up the volume, when a fellow-student suddenly entered to borrow some
  writing materials. Thrusting the book in my garment I supplied him with what
  he needed, and we hastened together to the lecture-room.</p>

  <p>We conversed, about trivial subjects, but my mind was not in them. It was
  with Isaiah. I could not help marvelling that a native of so small and weak a
  country should take so wide and imperial a view of the movements of the
  nations. In a Roman, I could have understood it better ; or in a Greek of the
  days of Alexander. But that a Jew&mdash;whose people was as it were the
  shuttlecock between the great empires surrounding it&mdash;that a Jewish
  prophet should think such thoughts filled me with astonishment. Then I
  wondered what Epictetus would say on the administration of the world if he
  ever dealt with it fiilly. "He," I said, "was a Phrygian and a slave. Is it
  possible that he, too, like Isaiah, could speak in this imperial fashion?"
  Arriving somewhat late, we found the room almost filled; but my seat was
  vacant, and I was glad to find Glaucus next to me, in the place vacated by
  Arrian's departure.</p>

  <p>Epictetus was just beginning his first sentence. I will give it as Glaucus
  took it down, exactly: "Be not surprised if other animals, all except
  ourselves, have ready at hand the things needful for their bodily wants
  provided for them, not only food and drink but also bedding, and no need of
  sandals or blankets or clothes&mdash;while we have need of all these
  additional things." He proceeded to say that the beasts were our servants,
  and that it would be extremely inconvenient for us if we had " to clothe,
  shoe, and feed sheep and asses! As if," said he, "a colonel had to shoe and
  clothe his regiment before they could do the service required of them! And
  yet men complain, instead of being thankful!" Any single created thing, he
  said, would suffice to demonstrate Providence to a grateful mind. Then he
  instanced the production of milk from grass and of cheese from milk. Thence
  he passed from the "works" of Nature to "by-works," such as the beard,
  distinguishing man from woman. This (I think) was one of his customary
  digressions against the fashion of smooth-skinned effeminacy: "How much more
  beautiful than the comb of cocks 1 How much more noble than the mane of
  lions! Therefore it was our duty to preserve God's appointed tokens of
  manhood: it was our duty not to give them up, not to confuse (so far as lay
  in us) the classes, male and female, distinguished by Him."</p>

  <p>"Are these," he continued, "the only works of Providence in our behalf?
  What praise can be proportionate to our benefits? Had we understanding, we
  should be ever hymning the graces He has bestowed on us. Whether digging, or
  ploughing, or eating, ought we not to sing the appropriate hymn to God,
  saying 'Great is God, because He hath given us tools wherewith to till the
  ground,' 'Great is God, who hath given us hands, and the power of swallowing,
  and a stomach, and a faculty of growing in stature painlessly and insensibly,
  and of breathing even when we sleep'? Hymns and praises such as these we
  ought to sing on each occasion. But the greatest and most divine hymn of all
  should be sung in thanks for that power"&mdash;he meant the
  Logos&mdash;"which intelligently recognises all these blessings, and which
  duly and methodically employs them. But you are silent. What then? Since you,
  like the common herd, are blind to God's glory, it was but fit that there
  should be some one herald, though it be but one&gt; to fill the place left
  empty by your default, and to chant the hymn that goes up to God in behalf of
  all. What else am I fit to do, a halting old man like me, except to sing the
  praises of God?"</p>

  <p>And so he drew toward the conclusion of the first part of his lecture.
  Were he a nightingale or a swan, he said, he would do as a nightingale or a
  swan&mdash;that is to say, utter mere sounds, songs without words, songs void
  of reasonable thoughts, without Logos&mdash;"But as it is, I am endowed with
  Logos. Accordingly I must sing hymns to God. This is my special work. This I
  do. Never will I abandon this post of duty, as long as it is given to me. And
  I invite and urge you also to the same task of song." From this he proceeded
  to speak of "the things of the Logos," or "the logical things," as being
  "necessary"; and he spoke of the Logos as that which "articulates"&mdash;by
  which he meant, distinguishes the joints and connexions of all other
  things&mdash;and also as being that which accomplishes all other things. He
  appeared to mean that this Logos was reason; and he assumed that it is
  "impossible that anything should be better than reason." But he refused to
  enter into the question. If the Logos within us goes wrong, what shall set it
  right? His language at this point was very obscure. The impression left upon
  me was that Logos, with him, meant two different things and that he did not
  distinguish them. When he sang hymns to God in accord with the Logos, I
  thought he must intend to include something more than reason; but when he
  passed on to say that "the things of the Logos" (or "the logical things") are
  necessary, he seemed to mean "reason" alone.</p>

  <p>Later on, he returned to his first subject: "When you are in the act of
  blaming Providence for anything, reflect, and you will recognise that it has
  happened in accordance with Logos." Then, taking the case of some man
  supposed to have been defrauded of a large sum of money, he placed in his
  mouth the objection that, if the fraud is "in accordance with Logos," it
  would seem that injustice is "in accordance with Logos." For, said the
  objector, "the unjust man has the advantage." "In what respect?" asked
  Epictetus. "In money," says the objector. To which Epictetus replied, "True,
  for he is better than you are for this purpose "&mdash;he meant, for making
  money&mdash;"because he flatters, he casts away shame, he is always
  unweariedly working for money. But consider. Does he get the better of you in
  respect of faithfulness and honour?" Then he rebuked us, would-be
  philosophers, for being angry with God for bestowing on us His best gifts,
  namely virtues, and for allowing bad men to take away from us what was not
  good in itself, namely, our worldly possessions.</p>

  <p>This view of Providence and of wealth seemed to differ from the one
  assumed in Isaiah and often stated by Moses and David. For they had taught me
  that righteousness, and truth, and obedience to parents, and neighbourly
  kindness, tend to "length of days" and to peace and prosperity on the
  earth&mdash;for the righteous man himself as well as for the community; and
  they also distinguished honest wealth, acquired by labour, from dishonest
  wealth acquired by greediness and injustice. But Epictetus here made no such
  distinction.</p>

  <p>The Jewish poems recognised it as being, at all events on the surface, a
  strange thing that a righteous man should be subjected to exceptional,
  crushing, and continuous calamities by the visitations of God. Epictetus
  appeared to teach us that God had ordained some men to be restless, pushing,
  shameless, and greedy, that they may take away the wealth acquired honestly
  by the good and honest and just. God had made these rascals "better" than the
  virtuous&mdash;in rascality! Then he called on us to admire or accept this
  ordinance or law: "Why fret, then, fellow? You have the better gift.
  Remember, therefore, all of you always, and have it by heart and on the lips,
  <i>This is a Law of Nature that the better should have&mdash;in the province
  in which he is better&mdash;the advantage of the inferior.</i> Then none of
  you will fret any more."</p>

  <p>In his general theory, Epictetus was careful to separate himself from
  those who maintain that the Gods do not interfere with the affairs of men, or
  never interfere except on great and public occasions, and he approved of the
  words of Ulysses to the AUseeing, quoted by Socrates, " Thou seest my every
  motion." If man, he said, can embrace the world in his thought, and if the
  air and sun can include all things in their influence, why cannot God? But
  this seemed to lead to the conclusion that the influence of God is being
  perpetually and ubiquitously exerted on men in order to produce knaves,
  slaves, tyrants, and fools: for such our Master appeared to deem the majority
  of mankind.</p>

  <p>In practice, Epictetus avoided such a blasphemy against God, by drawing no
  inference as to Providence from any of the laws or institutions of men, for
  he appeared to regard human institutions as radically bad. At all events he
  allowed his pupils&mdash;as I have shown above&mdash;to say that the rulers
  of the world are "thieves and robbers" and that the courts of justice are
  "courts of injustice." His belief in Providence was&mdash;I seemed to see
  clearly&mdash;based on nothing but the consciousness of the Logos within
  himself. The Logos in the vast majority of mankind appeared to him to have
  done them no good: so he could not argue from that.</p>

  <p>When someone mentioned the fate of the Emperor Galba as disproving a
  belief in Providence, Epictetus implied a scornful disavowal of any intention
  to base belief on any such historical event. Nor did he ever refer to God as
  controlling the movements of nations. In answer therefore to my silent
  question, "Does our Master see God in the history of individuals or nations?"
  his teaching seemed to reply "No, I see it in nothing except Socrates,
  Diogenes, and a few other philosophers, and also in myself. Beyond this
  little group of souls, though I feel myself able to infer God in everything,
  I cannot really infer Him in anything mental or spiritual. Hence I am driven
  to such physical instances as butter, cheese, stomachs, and beards!"</p>

  <p>On leaving the lecture-room I chatted with Glaucus and tried hard to be
  cheerful. But how I missed Arrian! I felt inclined to turn Epicurean. The
  "careless" gods of Epicurus seemed at least less unloveable than the
  Providence of Epictetus. Too much depressed for any kind of study, I did not
  return to my lodging but walked out into the country by unfrequented paths,
  resting after mid-day in a little village inn. Coming out, toward the close
  of the afternoon, I found an acquaintance of mine, Apronius Rufus, standing
  in the porch and amusing himself by throwing figs and nuts to a crowd of boys
  just emerging from the doors of a neighbouring school. From scrambling and
  scuffling the boys had come to fighting&mdash;all but two or three, who held
  aloof with an air of sulky superiority; and one, I think, saw the
  schoolmaster in the distance. My acquaintance was attending the Epicurean
  classes in Nicopolis. We Cynics called the followers of Epicurus "swine," and
  I could not resist the temptation of saying, "Rufus, you are making converts.
  When they grow up, these little pigs will do you credit." He laughed
  good-humouredly: "Not all of them, Silanus! A few, as you see yonder, remain
  of your persuasion, true Cynics, that is to say, puppies or prigs. But we do
  pretty well. Nature is for us, though you and the schoolmaster are allied
  against us. By the way, I think I see your ally coming round the comer. I
  will be off. Two against Hercules are one too many. Farewell!"</p>

  <p>"Farewell!" said I, "Your wit is as much stronger than mine as your
  philosophy is weaker."</p>

  <p>"But <i>is</i> it weaker?" thought I, as he strode back to Nicopolis, and
  I in the opposite direction. Was not Apronius right in saying that Nature was
  on his side? Does not Providence, like Circe, throw down figs and nuts for us
  human creatures to make us swine? Is she not always saying to us, "Push, and
  be greedy! Then you will get what you want"? And did not Epictetus acquiesce
  in this, in effect, saying to the two or three non-pushers, "Be content. The
  others, the masses of men, are 'better' than you are for pushing and for
  kicking and for fighting like greedy swine"? But who made them "better"? Was
  it not Nature? And how could I feel sure that this same Nature or Providence
  that made "grass" (as Epictetus said) to produce" milk and butter and
  cheese," did not make man to produce scrambling and scuffling and
  fighting&mdash;a spectacle for some amused God, who watches from the windows
  of heaven, like Apronius Rufus from the inn-door on earth?</p>

  <p>After a long circuit, returning to Nicopolis, I sat down to rest in a
  copse when the sun was drawing towards the west. Tired out by my walk, I fell
  asleep. When I awoke, the sun had set and the evening star was shining. As I
  sat in silence gazing upon it, better thoughts were brought to me. "Five
  minutes," I said, "with Hesper teach more about Providence than an hour with
  Epictetus." Then it occurred to me," But, were I Priam, and were this the
  evening before Troy was taken, would not Hesper shine as brightly before me?
  What does Hesper prove?" Presently, the lesser stars began to appear, growing
  each moment in number. Then I remembered how Moses represents the Lord God
  appearing to Abraham (when he was as yet childless) and sapng to him," Look
  up to the heaven and number the stars, if thou art able to number them all.
  So shall thy seed be." And what had come of it all? A nation that was no
  nation, a race of captives, known to us in Rome chiefly as hating pork and
  strangers no less than they loved their sabbaths. Then I thought, "Had Hesper
  any more favour for Abraham than for Priam? Perhaps the stars promised peace
  and prosperity to both and broke their promise! What Troy is, that Jerusalem
  is. Nay, worse. Troy has produced a New Troy. Where is the New Jerusalem? And
  where is the great nation promised to Abraham? A flock (or flocks) of exiles,
  fanatics, and slaves!"</p>

  <p>Just then came into my mind the memory of some words about the stars in
  Isaiah. I had taken the book with me to lecture. So I unrolled it till I came
  to them: <i>"Lift up your eyes on high and see. Who hath appointed all these?
  He that leadeth forth His host in a numbered array. He will call them all by
  name. Because of thy great glory, and in the might of thy strength, not one
  escapeth from thine eye."</i> Then the prophet declared that, even as the
  stars of heaven are made visible in the darkness, so the seed of Abraham was
  not hidden by any darkness from God's eye: <i>"Say not, Jacob {ah, why didst
  thou dare to say it, Israel?) 'My way is hidden from God, and my God hath
  taken away judgment and hath departed from me.' Hast thou not even now found
  out the truth? Hast thou not clearly heard it? The God eternal, the God that
  framed and fashioned the earth, even to its furthest corners. He will not
  faint for hunger, nor is there any fathoming of His wisdom. To them that
  hunger He giveth strength&mdash;but sorrow to them that have no grief. For
  hunger shall fall on the youths, and weariness on the young men, and the
  chosen warriors shall utterly lose strength; but they that wait patiently for
  God shall renew their strength; they shall put forth wings like eagles; they
  shall run and not be weary; they shall walk erect and shall not faint for
  hunger."</i></p>

  <p>I could not believe all this. But neither could I disbelieve it. One voice
  said to me, "The poet is casting on the God of the stars the mantle that he
  has borrowed from the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." But another voice
  kept saying to me, "Wait patiently for God: He shall renew thy strength." In
  the afternoon, when I had thrown myself down to rest, I had thought that I
  would give up the search after truth, get rid of all my books, leave
  Nicopolis, and go at once into the army. Now I was more hopeful. But I could
  not give any logical reason for my hope. Isaiah had not convinced me. Far
  from it! The promise to Abraham seemed still to me to have resulted in
  failure. I had broken off my study of Paul, almost at its commencement, in
  order to study Isaiah. And Isaiah, without Paul, presented many difficulties
  that might perplex wiser minds than mine. "Grant," said I, "that David the
  son of Jesse was a great poet. Grant that Isaiah was a great prophet. Yet
  what were their poems and prophecies except so many pillars of vapour, or, if
  of substance, then substantial failures; pillars with the capital gone and
  the shaft broken, no longer sustaining anything? Their temple is burned a
  second time, never to be rebuilt; the rod of Jesse, cut off from the very
  root, with no life left in it, 'despised indeed and rejected' but with no
  compensation of being 'exalted' or of 'dividing the spoils of the
  strong'!"</p>

  <p>All these things I said over and over again to myself. But still another
  voice, deeper than my own, seemed to be repeating "Wait patiently on God and
  He will renew thy strength! Wait patiently! Wait!" Up to the moment of
  retiring to rest that night my mind was in a state of oscillation. On the one
  hand, Scaurus might be right, and my best course might be to give up the
  study of philosophy, and to prepare myself for a military career. On the
  other hand, there appeared nothing in these poems or prophecies of Isaiah
  that would make a man less fit to be a soldier. My last thought was, "I
  should like to see how the modem Jew, Paul, takes up the teaching of the
  ancient Jew, Isaiah. I have but glanced at his quotations as yet." So I
  decided to examine this point on the following day.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; PAUL'S CONVERSION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HITHERTO my study of Christian or Jewish literature had
  never followed my intentions. I had intended to read Paul continuously. But
  first Isaiah, then David, then Moses, and then Isaiah again, had intervened.
  I was going forward all the while, but by a winding course, like a stream
  among hills and rocks. Now again I have to describe how&mdash;although I sat
  down with a determination to digress no more but to read through the epistles
  from the beginning to the end&mdash;I was led oflf to another
  investigation.</p>

  <p>The first phrase in the volume did not long occupy me. True, I had greatly
  disliked it when I first glanced at it, a few days ago&mdash;"Paul a
  <i>slave</i> of Jesus Christ." "Slave" was always used by Epictetus in a bad
  sense, and I had then thought it savoured of servility. But now I knew that
  the translation of Isaiah often used it to denote a devoted servant of God;
  and it seemed to me that Paul had perhaps no other word that could so well
  express how he felt bound to service by Christ's "constraining love."</p>

  <p>Nor did the next words now cause me much difficulty:&mdash;"<i>Called</i>
  to be an <i>apostle, set apart</i> to preach the <i>good tidings</i> of God,
  which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the holy scriptures."
  Scaurus had told me how Epictetus had borrowed from the Christians this
  notion of being "called" to bear testimony to God. Whether he was right or
  wrong, he had prepared me to find "called" in such a passage as this. It was
  connected here with an "apostle," that is, someone <i>"sent"</i> by God.
  This, too, seemed. natural. Though Epictetus did not use the noun, he often
  used the verb to describe his ideal Cynic&mdash;and especially
  Diogenes&mdash;as being <i>"sent"</i> to proclaim the divine law. "Set apart"
  I understood to mean "set apart" by special endowments of body and mind such
  as Epictetus frequently attributed to Socrates and Diogenes.</p>

  <p>As to the "good tidings," I knew that Epictetus would have considered it
  to be a message from God to this effect, "Children, I have placed your true
  happiness in your own control. Take it from yourselves, each of you, from
  that which is within you." But what was PauFs" good tidings"? Isaiah had
  described God's messengers as "proclaiming good tidings," namely, that God
  was coming to the aid of men: "As a shepherd will He shepherd His jflock and
  with His arm will He gather the lambs." Epictetus, as I have shown above,
  scoffed at this metaphor of "shepherd." But I could not help liking it. Homer
  used it about kings, Isaiah about God. I thought Paul meant, in part, that
  God would manifest Himself as the righteous King.</p>

  <p>But I knew that Paul must also mean more, and that he would not have
  claimed the attention of the Romans for a mere repetition of an ancient
  written prophecy. Any child able to read could have repeated that. Paul must
  have more good news&mdash;either about the Shepherd, or about the time, or
  about the certainty of His coming. At this point, it occurred to me, "Why
  wait for the gospels that Flaccus is to send me? Why not search through the
  epistles to find out what Paul's gospel is?" But I checked myself, saying,
  "No more digressions." The next words were these: "Concerning His Son, who
  came into being from the seed of David according to the flesh; who was
  defined Son of God, in power, according to the spirit of holiness, from the
  resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord." These words I have
  translated literally and obscurely so as to indicate to the reader how
  exceedingly obscure they seemed to me. "I must pass on," I said, "I can make
  nothing of this. What follows may make things clearer."</p>

  <p>I began to read on, but soon desisted. The words that followed took no
  hold of my mind. I tried, and tried again, but was irresistibly dragged back
  to "resurrection of the dead," and "power," and "spirit of holiness," and
  "defined"&mdash;especially to "resurrection." What kind of " resurrection"?
  During my childhood I had heard my father tell a story or legend how, just
  before the battle of Philippi, the spirit of the great Julius appeared to
  Brutus, saying "Thou shalt see me at Philippi." There Brutus slew himself.
  And Scaurus had remarked that a similar fate had overtaken others of the
  conspirators; so that some might declare that Julius had power to rise from
  the grave and turn the swords of his assassins against themselves. That, if
  true, was an instance of the power of a man, or a man-god, rising from the
  dead in a spirit of vengeance. But Paul spoke of "resurrection of the dead,"
  and "power," in connexion with a "spirit of holiness." Paul (I knew that
  already from the epistles) had been an enemy of Christ, as Brutus had been of
  Caesar. Comparing the two conquests, I asked whether more "power" might not
  be claimed for Christ's "spirit of holiness" than for Caesar's spirit of
  vengeance. For Paul, instead of being killed by Christ, had been made a
  willing and profitable "slave." Brutus had been forced to turn his sword
  against himself; Paul had been constrained by love to turn his new sword,
  "the sword of the spirit," against the enemies of his new Master. What light
  did this passage throw on the causes of PauFs conversion? I read it over
  again. Christ, he said, "came into being," or was born, "of the seed of David
  according to the flesh." Well, that might be one cause. A Jew would be more
  likely to accept as king a descendant of the house of David. And besides,
  Jews might think that such a birth fulfilled the prophecy above mentioned
  about "the root of Jesse." But there might be many born "of the seed of David
  according to the flesh." That which "defined" Christ to be "the Son of God"
  was "the resurrection of the dead"; and the "defining " was "in power" and
  "according to the spirit of holiness." By these last words, Paul seemed to
  separate Christ's resurrection from any such apparition as that of Julius, or
  other ghosts and phantasms; which may appear to this man or to that, and then
  vanish, either caused by evil magic, and doing an evil and magical work, or
  doing no work at all; whereas the rising again of Christ was caused by a holy
  power and resulted in a work of abiding power and "holiness."</p>

  <p>This it was that led me into a new digression. Recalling how the spirit of
  Caesar was said to have appeared and spoken to Brutus, I desired to know what
  words the spirit of Christ said to Paul, and when and how Christ appeared to
  him. I wished also to inquire about the nature of Paul himself, before and
  after his conversion; and whether he showed signs of restlessness, and of
  ambition to become a leader in a new sect. Perhaps I should have spared
  myself this searching if I had known that, along with the gospels, Flaccus
  was sending me Luke's Acts of the Apostles. But the results of the search
  were helpful to me. So I will set them down in case they may be helpful to
  others.</p>

  <p>First, then, I found that, before his conversion, Paul had been a Jew of
  the strictest kind. "Ye have heard," he said to the Galatians, "how that
  beyond measure I used to persecute the church of God and laid it waste, and I
  advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of mine own age among my
  countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers."
  That expression "ye have heard" clearly showed that it was a matter of
  notoriety. The writer meant (I thought) not only "ye have heard from me," but
  also "from others," perhaps meaning his enemies, the Judaizers (often
  mentioned in this epistle), who pointed at him the finger of scorn, saying,
  "This is the man that changed his mind. This man thought once as we do." To
  the Philippians also Paul said that he had every claim to be confident "in
  the flesh," being "A Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to
  zeal, persecuting the church; as to the righteousness that is in the law,
  blameless." So also he said to one of his assistants, Timothy, that he&gt;
  Paul, had been "the chief of sinners" because he had persecuted the
  church.</p>

  <p>Elsewhere I found him writing to the Romans that his heart sorrowed for
  his countrymen and that he could almost have prayed to be "accursed from
  Christ" for their sake, for they, he said, had the Patriarchs, and to them
  were made the promises; and he expressed a fervid hope that in the end the
  nation yould receive the promises, though for a time they were shut out. What
  he said to the Romans convinced me, in an indirect way, almost as strongly as
  what he said to the Galatians and Philippians, that Paul had been a genuine
  patriot, observing the traditions, as well as the written law, of the Jews,
  and persecuting the Christians with all his might because he thought (as we
  also were wont to think in Rome) that they were a pestilential sect,
  destructive of law, order, and morality. So much for what Paul was before his
  conversion.</p>

  <p>Next, as to what happened to him at the moment of his conversion. First I
  turned to the Corinthian letter describing the appearances of Christ after
  death, to see whether anything had escaped me in the context&mdash;any words
  uttered by Christ to Paul, for example, at the time. But there was nothing
  except the bald statements, by this time familiar to me, " He is recorded to
  have been raised on the third day according to the scriptures; and he
  appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; afterwards he appeared to above five
  hundred brethen, of whom the greater part remain till now, but some are
  fallen asleep; then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; and last
  of all, as unto one born out of due time, he appeared to me also. For I am
  the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle because I
  persecuted the church of God." All this Paul had previously delivered to the
  Corinthians&mdash;so says the letter&mdash;as a "tradition," and as a part of
  his "gospel."</p>

  <p>This gave me no help. All that I could infer from it was that Christ
  probably "appeared" to his enemy Paul in the same way in which he had
  "appeared" to his friends and followers, and that the "appearing" must have
  been of a cogent kind, since it convinced an enemy. Nor did I gain much more
  from the Galatian account, which was as follows: "But when it was the good
  pleasure of God&mdash;who set me apart for this service even from my mother's
  womb, and called me by His grace&mdash;to reveal His Son in me that I might
  make it my life's woric to preach the good tidings about him among the
  nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood, neither did I go
  up to Jerusalem to those that had been apostles before me, but I went away
  into Arabia, and turned back again to Damascus."</p>

  <p>Here I was in doubt whether "reveal His Son <i>in me</i>" meant "reveal
  <i>by my means</i>" or "reveal <i>in my heart</i>,' that is, "unveil in my
  soul the image of the Son, which up to that time I had smothered with
  self-will and obstinacy"&mdash;as though "the Son" had been all the while in
  Paul's heart, but he had been refusing to acknowledge him. This latter
  interpretation I preferred. But still there was no mention of any words
  uttered by Christ to Paul at the moment of his conversion. Only, as Paul
  implies elsewhere that he had not seen Jesus in the flesh, that is, in
  person, I presumed that there must have been some such utterance as "I am
  Jesus," or "I am the crucified":&mdash;else, how would Paul have recognised
  the appearance?</p>

  <p>As to the place of conversion, however, some light was afforded by the
  words "I turned back to Damascus," showing that he had been near Damascus
  when it happened. And the epistle to the Corinthians said that he had been
  let down in a basket from Damascus so as to escape the Jews. It appeared that
  he was persecuting the Christians up to the time of his conversion; that he
  was doing this in or near Damascus when he was converted; and that the Jews
  living in that city turned against him after his conversion, so that he had
  to escape from them.</p>

  <p>Hereupon I tried to imagine Paul the persecutor, in his course of
  "persecuting the church," suddenly stopped by an apparition of Christ. In
  respect of his acts, Paul&mdash;though he could not possibly have been so
  cruel&mdash;might be compared to Nero, who also persecuted the Christians.
  But in respect of righteousness and truth and fervour, Paul was like
  Epictetus. Then I recalled the story recently told me by Scaurus, how he and
  his father had come suddenly upon the young Epictetus, in the Neronian
  gardens, staring upon the Christians in their torments, and how Scaurus had
  remarked upon the ineffaceableness of the impression produced on his own mind
  and (as he believed) on that of my future Teacher. That I could well
  understand. But Scaurus and Epictetus were merely passive spectators. Paul
  was a perpetrator. "How much deeper," I said, "and all the more deep and
  terrible in proportion to his sense of justice and truth, must have been the
  impression on Paul's mind, when he suddenly woke up to the fact that he had
  been persecuting the followers of Truth, the disciples of the Sufifering
  Servant of God, predicted by the prophets!"</p>

  <p>Then it appeared to me that perhaps the precise <i>words</i> uttered by
  Christ in that moment of Paul's shock and agony were not of so much
  importance as the <i>feeling</i> of shock and agony itself, followed by a
  great wrenching away of prejudices and misconceptions, and by a sudden influx
  of a dazzling light on eyes habituated to darkness. Looking again at the
  Philippian letter, I perceived how much Paul had to give up, how lightly he
  regarded the sacrifice of all his prospects of prosperity and promotion among
  his own people: <i>"But whatever things were once gains to me, these I have
  counted as loss for Christ's sake. Nay, more, I count all things as loss for
  the sake of the preeminence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for
  whose sake I suffered the loss of all that I had, and I count it all as
  refuse, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in Him&mdash;not having
  as my own righteousness that which is of the law, but that which is through
  faith in Christ, the righteousness that is from God based on that
  faith&mdash;that I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection and
  fellowship with His sufferings, being conformed with His death; if by any
  means I may attain to the resurrection of the dead! Not that I have already
  received, or am already perfected. But I pursue the chase, if by any means I
  may seize as a prize that for which I was also seized as a captive by Christ
  Jesus!"</i></p>

  <p>These last words made me understand how Paul might have regarded Christ as
  manifested in him rather than to him. Isaiah saw God uplifted on high outside
  him. But Paul felt the Son of God enthroned as sovereign within him. I
  remembered reading in some drama how the wife of a dethroned and submissive
  sovereign goads him to rebel against his successor, saying&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">"Hath he deposed<br>
  Thine intellect? Hath he been <i>in thy heart</i>?"</p>

  <p>This was just what Paul experienced and exulted in avowing. Christ had
  "deposed" Paul's former self, and substituted a new self of his own as
  viceroy, to rule Paul, "in his heart." A soldier might say that Christ, in
  the moment of taking Paul prisoner, had (so to speak) given him back his
  sword, saying "Use it on my side among all the nations of the earth, that
  they also may receive the good tidings of the forgiveness of sins." But in
  fact (according to Paul's view) Christ had done much more than this. He had
  given Paul a new sword, "the sword of the spirit." He had also made his whole
  nature anew, according to Paul's own saying, "If any man be in Christ, he is
  a new creature, behold all things are made new."</p>

  <p>Not that I was as yet convinced that Christ had actually risen from the
  dead. For I did not yet feel sure that Paul might not have been deceived by
  himself and by the Christians. But I did now feel sure that Paul was honest
  and did not knowingly deceive his readers. And it was becoming more and more
  difficult to believe that self-deception or Christian deception could have
  produced effects on multitudes of men so great and permanent as those which
  were plainly discernible in the epistles.</p>

  <p>I remember at this time trying to prevent my growing admiration for Paul's
  work from blinding me to his defects. Such phrases as "let him be anathema,"
  and "dogs," and "whose belly is their glory," and "I would that those who are
  thus desolating you would even emasculate themselves"&mdash; these and others
  I marked with red in my volume. I knew Epictetua would have condemned them.
  But I soon perceived that these fiery flashes of wrath were reserved for
  those whom Paul j-egarded as proud and greedy ensnarers and oppressors of
  helpless souls; proud of knowledge that was no knowledge; greedy of money and
  influence to which they had no right; shutting their eyes against the light,
  and dragging back poor pilgrims just as they were on the point of entering
  into the City of Truth. Towards others, even if they might have appeared as
  rivals, he seemed to me to feel no rivalry, merging all such feeling in
  allegiance to Christ. Some, he said to the Philippians, preached Christ
  "thinking to add affliction " to his bonds, out of jealousy and spite. "What
  then?" he says. "Whatever may be the motive, Christ is preached, and I
  rejoice. Yea, and I will rejoice." In the same spirit he wrote to the church
  of Corinth concerning those among them who said, "I am of ApoUos," "I am of
  Cephas," "I am of Paul "&mdash;condemning all partisanship, although he
  gently reminds them of his singular relation to them, "Even though ye have
  ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet ye have not many fathers: for in Christ
  Jesus through the Goiipel I begot you."</p>

  <p>Another detail interested me. Paul (I found) differed greatly from
  Epictetus in physical constitution. Epictetus used to teach us that a C}mic
  had no business to be "infirm" of body. At all events, he said, no such
  person can do the work of a Cjniic Missionary. When he extolled "the sceptre
  of Diogenes," he used to tell a story of the way in which that philosopher,
  lying by the roadside, sick of a fever, called on the wayfarers to admire
  him. It was the road to Olympia, and people were on the way to the games:
  "Villains!" he shouted to them, "Stay! Are you going all that way to Olympia
  to see athletes fight or perish, and will you not stay to behold a contest
  between a man and a fever?" But this contest, I think, ended in Diogenes's
  death. As a rule, both he and Socrates had been perfectly and robustly
  healthy: and Epictetus seemed somewhat to despise those who were
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>Paul, on the other hand, frequently spoke of his "weakness," meaning
  physical infirmity or sickness. It was "owing to weakness" he told the
  Galatians, that he preached the gospel for the first time among them; and he
  called it a "temptation (or, trial) in the flesh." This I took to mean that
  he had been delayed in Galatia by some sickness, and had founded the Church
  there while in that condition. So to the Corinthians he said, "In
  <i>weakness</i> and in fear and in trembling did I come addressing myself to
  you." But that letter went on to say, "And my word and my preaching were not
  in the persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and
  <i>power</i>"&mdash;so that "power" went hand in hand with "weakness." Once
  at least I found Paul praying to be delivered from "weakness." "I will not
  boast about myself"&mdash;so he writes to the Corinthians&mdash;"except in my
  weaknesses." And then he went on to explain the "boasting" as being quite
  different from that of Diogenes. For the Cynic cried, in effect, "Come and
  see how strong I am!" But Paul meant that he would "boast" because, when he
  felt weakest, then his Master came to his aid and made him strong. This he
  expressed in a way that perplexed me at first: <i>"There was given to me a
  thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me, that I might not be
  lifted up above measure. About this, I besought the Lord thrice that it might
  depart from me. And He said unto me, My grace sufficeth for thee, for in
  weakness is Power made perfect."</i></p>

  <p>For some time I could not understand this phrase, "<i>an angel of
  Satan</i>." But afterwards I found Paul writing to his Thessalonian converts
  that, when he wished to come to help them, "Satan <i>hindered</i> him," so
  that Satan appeared to be a <i>hinderer</i> of the gospel. Then it seemed to
  me that among the Jews and Christians certain diseases might be regarded as
  demons, or the work of demons&mdash;just as, in Rome, "Fever" is worshipped
  as a divine and has temples. This fact I had heard Epictetus mention; and he
  also condemned those who pray to be delivered from fever. The right course
  was, he said, "to have the fever rightly." Paul seemed to say, "first pray to
  be delivered from fever, if it seems to hinder you from doing the work of the
  Lord. Then, if it be revealed to you as the will of the Lord that you should
  bear the fever, be sure that He will make your bodily weakness spiritually
  strong. Thus the temptation from Satan, the Hinderer and Adversary, shall be
  turned into a strengthening trial from God, your Helper and Friend."</p>

  <p>Summing up the marvellous changes that seemed to have come about for Paul
  in consequence of Christ's "appearing" to him, I was more than ever disposed
  to believe that it was of divine origin and a great deal more than a mere
  "appearing." I thought it must have been an "appearing" to the inner eye, the
  spirit, as well as to the outer eye.</p>

  <p>When we Romans and Greeks use the word "spirit," we mostly think of a
  shadowy unreal appearance of the dead. We should not call Jupiter, or Zeus, a
  "spirit." But I perceived that, with Paul, "spirit" was more real&mdash;and,
  if I may so say, more eternally solid&mdash;than "body." It was the real
  "person." The word "person" in Greek, as also in Latin, means a "mask" or
  "character" There is, with us, no one word to express "real person." Common
  people think the body real, but the spirit unreal. Paul used the name
  "spiritual body" to describe a "real person," raised from the dead in Christ.
  Well, then, it seemed to me that the power of Christ on Paul might be
  described, not only as an "appearing" but also as the grasp of a "real
  person," "taking hold of" Paul's spirit with a spiritual hand so as to
  strengthen and direct him. What else was it that made him so strong?</p>

  <p>The strength of Epictetus in bearing trials and sufferings had long
  excited my admiration. But now the strength of Paul seemed greater. Epictetus
  bore&mdash;or at least professed to bear&mdash;only his own burdens. As for
  those of others, he said, "These are nothing to me." Paul was like a gentle
  nurse or tender mother with the weaklings among his converts. "Who," he
  asked, "is made to stumble, and I bum not? Who is weak, and I am not weak?"
  And yet, in his weakness, he was a very Hercules or Atlas, strong enough to
  bear "the care of all the churches"! This "weak" man was always fighting,
  always craving to fight, and always conquering&mdash;up to the time of his
  impending departure, when he exclaimed that he had "fought the good fight "!
  And through what an extent of the civilised world! "From Jerusalem to
  Illyricum"&mdash;so he wrote to the Bomans! In that same letter he announced
  his intention of carrying the eagles of the New Empire into Rome itself, and
  of passing onward from Rome to the invasion of Spain! No wonder that he felt
  able to say, "I take pleasure in weaknesses, in outrages, in straits and
  necessities, in persecutions and hardships, in Christ's behalf; for in the
  moment when I am weak, in that moment I am strong."</p>

  <p>"I am strong "! Yes. Rolling up the volume as I retired to rest that
  night, I was constrained to agree with that, at all events. "About some
  things," said I, "or perhaps about many things in your letters I am doubtful;
  but assuredly you are strong. I myself am also certain that you are honest.
  But that you are strong&mdash;and that, too, with a strength that comes from
  faith in the resurrection of your Master&mdash;this not even an atheist or
  Epicurean could deny."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">XV. &mdash; EPICTETUS'S GOSPEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I WENT somewhat unwillingly to the next day's lecture. It
  would probably be interesting, I thought; but I could no longer deny that I
  was beginning to feel doubtful about that. And certainly I was more
  interested in PauVs letters. Soon after I was seated, Glaucus came in. He
  looked worn and haggard, but there was no time to ask him questions. The
  subject of the lecture was. How are we to struggle with adversity? The answer
  was, By bearing in mind that death is no evil; that defamation is nothing but
  the noise of madmen; and that only the rich, the lords and rulers of the
  earth, are the subjects of tragedies. But the main point was that "the door"
  is always open: "Do not be more cowardly than children. The moment they are
  tired, they say, 'I won't play any more.' Say you the same, 'I won't play any
  more.' And be off. But if you stay, don't keep on complaining." This topic
  had become familiar. What followed, though not quite novel, interested me
  more, because it seemed to bear on the Jewish Law.</p>

  <p>First came a general descant on the advantages of being absolutely free
  from fear. Why should a man fear? Had he not power over everything that might
  cause him fear? Then a pupil was supposed to ask for more rules of life,
  saying, "But give me commandments." The reply was, "Why am I to give you
  commandments? Has not Zeus given you commandments? Has He not given and
  appointed for you what is your own, unhindered and unshackled; but what is
  not your own, hindered and shackled? Well, then, what is the commandment? Of
  what nature is the strict injunction with which you have come into the world
  from Zeus? It is this, 'Keep in all ways the things that are yours, desire
  not the things that are for others'... Having such suggestions and commands
  from Zeus, what further commands can you crave from me?" He finished this
  section of his discourse thus, "Bring these commandments, bring your
  preconceptions, bring the demonstrations of the philosophers, bring the words
  you have often heard and have often yourself spoken, read, and pondered."</p>

  <p>I could not feel sure whether "bring" meant "bring to bear on each point,"
  or "bring to your aid"; but, in either case, this conclusion, to me at least,
  was disappointing. "It is all very true," I thought, "and strictly according
  to reason. We are sure we have 'preconceptions.' We are not sure that we
  receive strength, in this or that emergency, from any being except ourselves.
  And yet how tame&mdash;and, in emergencies, how flat and unhelpful&mdash;such
  an utterance as this appears in comparison with the oracle that the Christian
  believed he had heard from his Lord, 'My grace is sufficient for thee. For
  Power is made perfect in weakness'!"</p>

  <p>The rest of the lecture was more lively and expressed with more novelty,
  but old in substance&mdash;addressed to those who wanted to enjoy the best
  seats in the theatre of life but not to be squeezed by the crowd. His
  prescription was, "Don't go to see it at all, man, and then you will not be
  squeezed. Or, if you like, go into the best seats, when the theatre is empty,
  and enjoy the sun there." Then he added something that made my companion
  Glaucus shrug his shoulders and cease taking notes, "Remember always, <i>We
  squeeze ourselves, we pinch ourselves.</i> For example, we will suppose you
  are being reviled. What is the harm in that? Why pinch yourself on that
  account? Go and revile a stone. What harm will you do the stone? Well then,
  when you are reviled, listen like a stone. And then what harm does the
  reviler do you?"</p>

  <p>We went out together, Glaucus and I. I think I have said before that
  Glaucus had some troubles at that time in his home at Corinth, but of what
  kind I did not exactly know. "Silanus," he said presently to me, with a
  bitter smile, "I am pinching myself with my shoe." "Then take it off," said
  I.</p>

  <p>"By the immortal Gods," he exclaimed, "I wish I could! But what if my shoe
  is the universe? What if it is..." He stopped.</p>

  <p>I replied at once, like a faithful disciple of Epictetus, "Not the
  universe, Glaucus, but your opinions about the universe." "Well then," said
  he, "my 'opinions about the universe.' What if my 'opinions about the
  universe' include 'opinions about' certain persons and things&mdash;home,
  father, mother, sister, and other such indifferent trifles? To put an
  imaginary case, could I by 'taking off' my 'opinion about' my father, take my
  father out of prison, or save him from death, or others from disgrace worse
  than death? No, Silanus, I am beginning to be a little tired of hearing
  'Remember always. <i>You pinch yourselves!</i>' Often it is so. But not
  always. What say you?"</p>

  <p>What ought I to have said? I knew exactly what was the correct thing to
  say." In such cases, give up the game. The door is open. Do you say the
  universe pinches you? Then take off your shoe by going out of the universe."
  This would have been the orthodox consistent answer. But I was inconsistent,
  not indeed in words, but in a heretical glance of sympathy, which
  Glaucus&mdash;I could see&mdash;interpreted rightly. We parted. As I walked
  slowly back to my rooms, I had leisure to reflect that the gospel of
  Epictetus had no power to strengthen Glaucus, and&mdash;I began to
  fear&mdash;no power to strengthen me, except to bear comparative trifles. It
  was not strong enough&mdash;at least in me&mdash;to stand up against the
  great and tragic calamities of human life.</p>

  <p>With these thoughts, I sat down once more to study Paul's epistles from
  the beginning. Once more (but now for the last time) I was led into a
  digression. It was the word "gospel" that thus dragged me away, coming upon
  me (in Paul's first sentence) just when I had been deploring the failure of
  the "gospel" of Epictetus. Reading on, I found that Paul's "gospel" had been
  "promised beforehand, through God's prophets, in the holy scriptures
  concerning His son." A little later, the writer said, "I am not ashamed of
  the gospel. For it is God's power tending to salvation for every one that
  hath faith, Jew first, and then Greek. For God's righteousness is therein
  revealed, from faith tending to faith, even as it is written, 'Now the
  righteous shall live by faith'."</p>

  <p>The next words surprised me by mentioning "God's wrath" as a part of the
  gospel: "For there is revealed therein <i>God's wrath</i> from heaven against
  all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in
  unrighteousness." But I immediately perceived that it might be regarded as
  "gospel" or "good tidings" to be informed that God does really feel "wrath"
  at unrighteousness, or injustice, and that He will sooner or later judge and
  punish it. Accordingly I was not surprised to find Paul, soon afterwards,
  connecting "gospel" and "judging" thus: "In the day when God shall judge the
  secrets of men according to my gospel, through Jesus Christ."</p>

  <p>From this I perceived that Paul's gospel promised a righteous judgment as
  well as immortality. But how could it be proved that there would be this
  righteous judgment? Paul said that it was "revealed <i>from faith to
  faith</i>." He added, "<i>as it is written</i>"; and a note in the margin of
  my MS. showed me that he was referring to a certain prophet named Habakkuk. I
  unrolled the passage. It seemed that this Habakkuk was living in times when
  his nation was grievously oppressed. The oppressors were like fishermen
  catching the oppressed at their pleasure. The prophet, standing on a tower,
  said to the people, "Wait and have faith. The righteous shall live by faith."
  Paul meant that if we would begin by having some faith in a righteous God, in
  spite of appearances on the surface of things, we should be helped to rise
  "from faith to more faith," and consequently that we should "live"&mdash;that
  is have <i>real</i> life. Faith seemed to Paul needful for life. Life without
  faith seemed to him no real life but a living death.</p>

  <p>As I read on, I saw that this kind of "faith" was regarded by Paul as the
  foundation of all righteousness. He quoted scripture thus, "Abraham had faith
  in God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness." Then I remembered
  that he had quoted the same passage in writing to the Galatians, in order to
  prove to them that the seed of Abraham did not obtain righteousness by doing
  the works prescribed in the code of Moses, but by following in the faith of
  their forefather. Now this faith, in the case of Abraham, had seemed to me at
  first of a narrow and selfish nature:&mdash;"God will keep His promise to me.
  God will give me a child in my old age." But Paul showed that the promise
  concerned "all the nations of the earth," and that Abraham was not selfish in
  his faith&mdash;any more than in his pleading with God for such righteous
  people as might be in Sodom and Gomorrah when he said, "Shall not the judge
  of all the earth do right?" This faith in God's truth and righteous judgments
  was at the bottom of Paul's gospel, and Paul taught that it was at the bottom
  of all righteousness both of Jews and Gentiles.</p>

  <p>But here came a great difficulty and obstacle in the way of faith,
  because, when men departed from God's righteousness, God Himself (so Paul
  taught) departed frm them for a time, allowing them to do the unrighteousness
  that was in their hearts and to judge unjustly. For this cause (according to
  Paul) God introduced Law into the world, and especially the Law of Moses. The
  Law was brought in to represent His righteousness in a poor rough fashion,
  until the time should come when He would send into the world the real
  righteousness or justice, the real judge or spirit of judgment. Such a judge
  (according to Paul's gospel) was Jesus Christ, judging the world already to
  some extent, but destined to judge it in complete righteousness, "in the day
  when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel," said Paul,
  "through Jesus Christ."</p>

  <p>At this point came the doctrine of the immortality of the soul, enabling
  Paul to say, "Wait, and you will see justice done"; whereas Epictetus was
  forced to say, in effect, "Justice will never be done,"&mdash;not at least
  what a plain man would call justice&mdash;"since the justice of this life
  was, is, and will be, oppression, and no second life is ever to exist."</p>

  <p>The only passage in which Epictetus (as far as I could recollect)
  described a good judge, was one in which the philosopher was supposed to hold
  a dialogue with the Censor, or Judge, of Nicopolis. The man was an Epicurean;
  and Epictetus, after representing him as boasting that he was " a judge of
  the Greeks," and that he could order imprisonment or flogging at his
  discretion, replied that this was coercing, not judging. "Show us," said he,
  "the things that are unprofitable for us and we shall avoid them. Make us
  passionate imitators of yourself, as Socrates made men of himself. He was
  really a ruler of men. For he, above all others, so framed men that they
  subordinated to him their inclinations, aversions, and impulses."</p>

  <p>This seemed to me, at first, a fine ideal of a spiritual judge. I
  contrasted it with Pauls picture of the Lord as Judge taking vengeance in
  fire upon His enemies; and Epictetus seemed to have the advantage. But on
  consideration it appeared that Epictetus was confusing his hearers by passing
  suddenly from a judge to a ruler. According to his own account elsewhere,
  Socrates did not persuade a thousandth part of those to whom he addressed
  himself. On the other hand Paul distinguished two aspects of Christ. In one,
  He appeared as constraining His subjects to love Him and to become
  "passionate imitators" of Him. In the other, He appeared as a judge, making
  the guilty shrink from their own guilt, and feel pain at their own sin, when
  the light of judgment reveals them to themselves. Paul spoke of "fire"
  according to the metaphors of the scriptures. He appeared to be describing
  the Supreme Judge as destroying the evil while purifying the good&mdash;as
  fire may destroy some things but purify others.</p>

  <p>This was not the only occasion when the gospel of Epictetus seemed to
  me&mdash;not at first, but upon full consideration&mdash;inferior to the
  gospel of Paul in recognising facts fairly and fully. For example, Paul, in
  the epistle I was now reading, adopted the ancient Jewish tradition that
  death came into the world as a result of the sin of the first man Adam.
  According to this view, death was a "curse." Now Epictetus appeared to be
  directly attacking this doctrine when he spoke as follows, "If I knew that
  disease had been destined to come upon me at this very moment, I would rush
  towards it&mdash;just as my foot, if it had sense, would rush to defile
  itself in the mire. Why are ears of com created? Is it not that they may be
  parched and ripened? And are they to be parched and ripened, and yet not
  reaped? Surely, then, if they had sense, the ears of wheat ought not to pray
  never to be reaped Nay, this is nothing short of a curse upon
  wheat&mdash;never to be reaped! So you ought to know that <i>it is nothing
  short of a curse upon men, not to die.</i> It is all the same as not being
  ripened&mdash;not to be reaped."</p>

  <p>How much finer, thought I at first, is this doctrine of Epictetus than the
  doctrine of Paul! And how superstitious is that Hebrew story about a serpent,
  causing death to fall upon man as a curse from God! But coming back to the
  matter again after I read some way in the epistle, and thinking over what
  "death" meant to Epictetus and what it meant to Paul, I began to waver. For
  Epictetus thought that "death" meant being dissolved into the four elements.
  And how was this like "being ripened and reaped"? When com is reaped, men get
  good from it. But when I am "reaped," that is to say, distributed into my
  four elements, who will get any good from that? So, once more, the gospel of
  Epictetus, as compared with the gospel of Paul, seemed to be deficient not
  only in power but also in directness and clearness of statement.</p>

  <p>It reminded me of the saying of Paul when he said that God sent him to
  preach the gospel "<i>not in wisdom of word</i> lest the cross of Christ
  should be made of no effect." "Wisdom of word" appeared to mean "calling old
  facts by new names without revealing any new truth." So far as I could
  understand the gospel of Epictetus, his language about my being "ripened and
  reaped" was like that other earlier promise that I should find "friends" in
  the four elements when I passed into them in the dissolution of death. It was
  all "wisdom of word."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">XVI. &mdash; PAUL'S GOSPEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN contrasting Epictetus with Paul to the disadvantage of
  the former, I was far from imagining that the latter had unloosed the knot of
  the origin of sin. But at all events he recognised the existence of the knot.
  Epictetus ignored it, or failed to recognise it. He spoke in the same breath
  of God's ordaining "vice and virtue, winter and summer," as though God's
  appointing that some men shall be bad caused him no more difficulty than His
  appointing that some days shall be cold.</p>

  <p>Paul, on the other hand, treated death as though it were a curse in the
  intention of Satan, but a blessing (or step towards blessing) through the
  controlling will of God. He also spoke of a spiritual body rising out of the
  dead earthly body, as flower and fruit rise out of the decaying seed. I did
  not at first feel sure what he meant by this. Flower and fruit resemble seed
  in that they can be touched. Did Paul mean that the spiritual body resembled
  the earthly body in being tangible, besides being more beautiful? I thought
  not. It seemed to me possible that a person in the flesh, dying, might become
  a person in the spirit, living for ever. A man's actions and sufferings, sown
  in the transient flesh, might after death become part of the flower of the
  imperishable spirit, the real man, the spiritual body. That, I thought, was
  what Paul meant. This belief I found also stimulative to well-doing,
  according to the saying of Paul himself, "I press on, if by any means I may
  attain to the resurrection of the dead." Moreover I remembered the "angel of
  Satan" appointed for Paul to keep him from pride, and how he prayed against
  it, and received a revelation "My grace is sufficient for thee." If prayer
  and strength were brought about for Paul by an "adversary" of prayer, might
  not righteousness be brought about for the human race by the "adversary" of
  righteousness? I did not myself at that time believe in the existence of such
  an "adversary;" but Paul's belief seemed to me not unreasonable.</p>

  <p>This turned me to other passages in the epistles concerning "Satan," or
  the "angels of Satan," or "principalities and powers." And I contrasted them
  with what Epictetus had said, "All things are full of Gods and daemons,"
  meaning good daemons. Once more, the words of Epictetus seemed the nobler.
  But were they true? What did they amount to in fact? Nothing except "wisdom
  of word," calling the four elements "friends"! Thus in the end&mdash;though
  very slowly and reluctantly&mdash;I was brought, first, to understand, and
  then to favour, Paul's opinion, namely, that so far as we can see the truth
  in the "enigma" of the "mirror" of this world, there is being waged a battle
  of good against evil, order against disorder, light against darkness, life
  against death.</p>

  <p>What Isaiah said concerning the stars and God's "leading them forth" gave
  me some help, just when I was thinking about the "conflict between light and
  darkness." For how, I thought, does God bring forth the stars except through
  the hand of His angel of darkness? Yet we, men, mostly speak of "darkness" as
  an enemy. And so, in a sense, it often is. Yet it is revealed in the aspect
  of a servant of God when besides bringing us the blessing of rest and sleep
  it leads forth the hosts of glories that (except for darkness) would never
  have been perceived. So, darkness brings God's greatness to light. Paul
  certainly predicted that the same truth would hereafter be recognised about
  death and about the apparent disorder of Nature, and her "groanings and
  travailings"; and it seemed to me that he extended the same doctrine even to
  sin.</p>

  <p>The result was that I found myself content to accept&mdash;in a manner,
  and provisionally&mdash;what Paul said about "Satan" and about
  "principalities" and at the same time what he said to the effect that all
  things are from God and through God and to God, and, "For them that believe,
  all things work together for good." In my judgment, it was better&mdash;yes,
  and more reasonable, in Paul's sense of the word "reason"&mdash;to feel that
  I was in the Universe fighting a real fight against evil but looking up to
  God as my Helper, than to feel that there was no evil or enemy for me
  anywhere except in myself, and no friend either. So in the end I said,
  "Better to have been under the curse of death with Paul, if the curse may
  lead to a supreme blessing of life eternal in the presence of the Father,
  than to pass out of life with Epictetus, without any experience of curse at
  all, as so much earth, air, fire and water, into the nominal friendship of
  Gods and daemons!"</p>

  <p>In allowing myself thus to be led away by my new Jewish teacher I was not
  influenced by his letters alone, but by legends and traditions&mdash;to some
  of which he referred&mdash;in the Hebrew histories, visions, and prophecies.
  Some of these taught, predicted, prefigured, or suggested that, while man and
  the brute forces of man and nature blindly imagine that they are moving the
  wheel of the universe, God alone is really moving it, and is using them to
  move it, towards His own decreed and foreordained purpose.</p>

  <p>To the most beautiful of all such visions I was drawn by these words of
  Paul, "Know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah?" Here a marginal note
  in my MS. referred me to the whole story, how Elijah, having slain with the
  sword the adversaries of God, was himself forced to flee from the sword of
  King Ahab, to Mount Horeb or Sinai, where the Law had once been given to
  Israel amid lightnings and thunders. And here the prophet was taught that God
  is not in the principalities of Nature, not in the tempest or fire or
  earthquake, but in "the still small voice." This agreed with a passage in
  Isaiah concerning the Deliverer, "He shall not cry aloud." In comparison with
  these and other similar poems and prophecies, the best things that the Greeks
  have written began to appear to me like mere "wisdom of word."</p>

  <p>As regards the time when Paul's "good news" or "gospel" of "the righteous
  judgment" of God was to be fulfilled, I gathered that the judgments of God
  had been revealed to the apostle as having been working from the beginning of
  the world&mdash;seen, as it were, through openings in a veil&mdash;in the
  deluge, in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the punishment of the
  Egyptians for persecuting Israel, in the punishments of Israel during and
  after the Exodus, and especially in their captivity and the destruction of
  their temple. But he seemed to believe that he had received also some special
  revelation about a judgment to fall upon the Jews, or upon all mankind, as
  soon as the gospel had been proclaimed to the world, but not before.</p>

  <p>His language, however, varied. To the Philippians he spoke as though he
  were in doubt whether to desire to depart and to be with Christ, or to
  "remain in the flesh" for the sake of his converts. This showed that he
  contemplated the possibility of his dying before the Lord's coming. And this
  was made still clearer in some of his sayings to Timothy, such as "I have
  fought the good fight," if taken with their contexts. But to the
  Thessalonians he wrote somewhat differently. It appeared that certain of them
  were grievously disappointed because some of their brethren had died before
  the Lord's coming. Paul wrote to console them, saying that they,
  too&mdash;that is the dead brethren&mdash;would be raised up. "We that are
  alive," he said, "shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep
  "&mdash;as though he anticipated that, on the day of the Coming, the greater
  number of the brethren, and he among them, would be still "alive."</p>

  <p>From several of these passages, and from similar words in the prophets, I
  gathered that, had he lived long enough to witness it, Paul would have
  considered the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus to have been a "day of the
  Lord" or "day of judgment." But he was assured that the greatest day of all
  would not arrive till the sins of mankind had come to a head. Also it
  appeared to me that Paul did not profess to know when the last "judgment"
  would come to pass, and that he, like other Christians, at first expected it
  to come soon, and afterwards changed his mind.</p>

  <p>Summing up the results of my study, I found that Paul's gospel appeared to
  be good news in a double aspect, first outside us, then inside us. First, it
  said that man was made by a perfectly good God to be, in the end, perfectly
  good, but was allowed by the Maker to fall into imperfection, through Satan,
  as a step towards perfection. This could be seen in the history of God's
  judgments from the beginning, but most of all in the fact that the Son of
  God, having been sent into the world as a son of David, for the salvation of
  all the nations of the earth, and having been killed by the Jews, had been
  raised from the dead to save and judge mankind in righteousness. Secondly, it
  jsaid that there was in every human being a faculty of faith in the goodness
  and love and righteous judgments of God, and that this faith, when fixed on
  the Saviour, enabled men to receive His spirit of righteousness and His love,
  to await His judgments, and to lead a life of righteousness on earth followed
  by an immortality of blessedness in heaven.</p>

  <p>Comparing this with the gospel of Epictetus I could not but feel that
  Paul's was far more helpful, but also more diflBcult to believe. Yet it was
  not incredible. Epictetus himself recognised in Socrates some traces of a
  power to frame men to his own will. If Socrates the Athenian, and Diogenes
  the Sinopian, and others, whom God called "His own sons," had this power in
  some degree, in proportion to their possession of a share of the divine
  Logos, why might not Jesus the Jew be regarded as possessing this power to
  the fullest extent, having the fulness of the Logos so that he could succeed
  where Socrates and Diogenes and Epictetus failed?</p>

  <p>I write here "Jesus the Jew," to show that, at that time, I did not know
  that Jesus was called the Nazarene, nor had I any notion that he was born
  otherwise than naturally "of the seed of David." But I clearly perceived that
  Paul placed Jesus far above all patriarchs and prophets. Also I think (but am
  not quite sure) that I already understood Paul to believe that the Son of God
  was Son from the beginning of the world, before taking flesh as "the seed of
  David "&mdash;but not in any miraculous way. About this point I did not
  employ my thoughts. The question for me was, Had this Jesus the power
  attributed to him by Paul's gospel&mdash;to conform men to himself? I was
  obliged to answer, "Yes, with some men." For the epistles had long ago
  compelled me to give up the notion that the Christians were a vicious,
  immoral, and rebellious sect. It was clear to me that they were above the
  average in morality. And as for Paul himself, I felt sure that Jesus had
  exerted this, power over him, and, through him, over vast multitudes ia
  various nations.</p>

  <p>Now, too, having a clearer conception of Paul's gospel, I began to
  understand better something that had perplexed me a good deal on the first
  reading&mdash;I mean Paul's description ta the Galatians of the course he
  took immediately after his conversion. I had expected that he would have said
  something to this effect, "You Galatians are revolting from ray gospel. But
  it is the true gospel. I have told you the truth about all Christ's words and
  deeds. It is true that I did not know Him&mdash;or hear Him, or even see
  Him&mdash;in the flesh. But after I was converted, I took great pains to
  ascertain as soon as. possible, from those who had known Him in the flesh,
  all that He did and said. I wrote down these traditions at once, and read
  them again and again till I knew them by heart. These are the traditions I
  gave you." This is what I had expected Paul to say. But what I found him
  actually saying to the Galatians was this: <i>"I make known unto you
  brethren, as to the gospel preached by me, that it is not on any human
  footing, nor did I receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it as
  teaching, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ."</i></p>

  <p>What he meant by "gospel" was&mdash;I now perceived&mdash;<i>not Christ's
  teaching before the resurrection, but His teaching after the
  resurrection.</i> And this included an unfolding of the will of God as
  revealed in the scriptures and in all the history of Israel. This appeared in
  what followed. The Galatians all knew (he said) how bitterly he had
  persecuted the Christians. For he had been a most bigoted and bitter zealot
  of strict Judaism. But, said he, <i>"When it pleased God to reveal His Son in
  me that I might preach His good tidings among the nations, straightway I
  conferred not with flesh and blood, nor went I up to Jerusalem to those that
  were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia."</i> Afterwards (but not
  in this context) he spoke of "Mount Sinai in Arabia." Sinai being the place
  where Moses received the revelation of the old Law, and where Elijah, too,
  received the revelation of the "still small voice," I had assumed (at the
  time of reading the epistle) that Paul went to Mount Sinai in Arabia that he
  also might receive his revelation of the new Law of Christ. Perhaps, however,
  it merely meant that he wished to be alone. If so, I was wrong. But it does
  not seem to me, even now, wrong to infer that, all through that sojourn in
  Arabia, Paul was in communion with that same Jesus Christ, who had recently
  appeared to him, and who had converted him from an enemy into a friend.</p>

  <p>The same Galatian letter described Paul as not going up to Jerusalem till
  "three years" had elapsed. Even then he remained only "fifteen days" in
  Jerusalem, and saw (as I gathered) only one or two of the apostles, and did
  not go up again till "after the space of fourteen years." All these details
  about time he appeared to add, not out of any jealousy of the older apostles,
  but to show that he did not attach importance to the things that Christ had
  said "in the flesh," before death, in comparison with the things that He had
  said after death, "being raised up according to the spirit of holiness." And
  who could be surprised at this? The things that Christ said after death, when
  He had been "defined as Son of God from the resurrection of the dead "&mdash;
  how should not these be more deeply impressed upon the mind of the hearers,
  and also be most deep and spiritual in themselves, being reserved till the
  disciples were spiritually prepared to receive them?</p>

  <p>So the gospel of Paul resolved itself into this, that God, having decreed
  from the beginning that men should love Him as Father and one another as
  brethren, had sent His Son into the world to enable them to do this, by dying
  for them, and by imparting to them His Spirit. The Son dictated no code of
  laws to obey. All that He asked was faith in Himself as the Son of God, dying
  for men, and victorious over sin and death. This seemed simple, but its
  simplicity did not deceive me into imagining that I believed it. "That is all
  that is needed," said I, as I closed the volume of the epistles; "but it is
  more than I possess, or can possess. Paul's gospel is not a message but a
  person. It is, as he says somewhere, 'Christ, dwelling in the heart through
  faith.' I feel no such indwelling. In the gospel of Epictetus I am neither
  able nor willing to believe, I might perhaps be willing, but I am not able,
  to believe in the gospel of Paul."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">XVII. &mdash; EPICTETUS CONFESSES FAILURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM such thoughts about my own desires and inabilities it
  was a relief to turn to some definite matter of fact. I had been spending
  several hours in attempting to find out what Paul's gospel was. But what was
  Christ's gospel, so far as it could be gathered from the epistles? This I had
  made no attempt to discover. "Epictetus," I reflected, "though he does not
  profess to teach a gospel of Socrates or Diogenes, yet frequently quotes from
  them. Might I not expect to find at least a few words of Christ&mdash;whether
  uttered before or after the resurrection&mdash;quoted here and there in some
  at least of these numerous letters?" Hitherto I had met with none. But now,
  on rapidly unrolling the volume and searching onwards from the end of the
  epistle to the Romans, I came to a quotation that had escaped me. It was in
  the first of the Corinthian letters, following immediately after some details
  (not of great interest) about women's head-covering. I had just time to note
  that the passage contained the words "the Lord Jesus said," and "on the night
  on which he was delivered over," when my servant announced that Glaucus
  wished to see me, and I put the book aside.</p>

  <p>Ostensibly Glaucus had come to compare some of his lecture notes with
  mine. But I soon found that his real object was to forget his troubles in the
  society of a friend. To forget them, not to reveal them. He avoided anything
  that might lead to personal questions, and I respected his reticence. When,
  however, he rose to go, he made some remark on the diflBculty of retaining
  the imperturbability on which Epictetus was always insisting, "under the
  sword of Damocles." Knowing vaguely that his alarm was not for himself but
  for others, I suggested that he might return at once to Corinth. "I would do
  so," he said, "but my father expressly bids me remain at Nicopolis." He said
  this uneasily, and with a wistful look, as though he suspected that something
  was amiss and longed for advice. "If action of any kind is possible," said I,
  "take it. If not..." Then I stopped. "Well," said he, "'if not'&mdash;." He
  waited for me to complete my sentence. I would gladly have left it
  uncompleted. For the truth was that I had begun the sentence in one mood and
  was being called on to complete it in another. When I said, "If not," I had a
  flash of faith coming with a sudden memory of Isaiah's message about God as
  the Shepherd of the stars and his exhortation to "wait patiently on the
  Lord."</p>

  <p>But it had vanished and left me in the dark. "'If not'," repeated Glaucus
  for the second time. I ought to have replied, "Then at least keep yourself
  ready for action." What I did say, or stammer out, was, something about
  "waiting and trusting."</p>

  <p>Glaucus looked hard at me. "'<i>Wait and trust!</i>' That is to say,
  '<i>Wait and believe</i>.' That is not like you, Silanus. You don't mean it,
  I see. It is not like you to say what you don't mean. I would sooner have
  heard you repeat your old friend Scaurus's advice, which was more like
  '<i>Wake and disbelieve</i>.' 'Wait,' say you, 'and trust.' Trust whom? Wait
  for what? Wait for the river of time to run dry? I have kept you up too late.
  Sleep well, and may sleep bring you better counsel for me!" So saying, he
  departed, but turned at the door to fling a final jibe at me, "Silanus, you
  are a Roman and I am only a Greek. But you must not think we Greeks are quite
  ignorant of your Horace. And what says he about waiting? <i>Rusticus
  expectat</i>: 'Hodge sits by the river.' Farewell, and sleep well."</p>

  <p>This was bitter medicine; but I had deserved it, and it did me good. My
  cheeks burned with shame as I recalled his words "It is not like you to say
  what you don't mean." Had I come to this? Was this the result of my study of
  these Jewish writings? And yet, did I not "mean" it? Was not the fact rather
  this, that in my own mind I did to some extent mean and believe it? But it
  was a dormant belief. And I had no power to communicate it to others. Then I
  perceived the reason. I had said "Wait and trust." But Isaiah said "Wait thou
  <i>upon the Lord</i>." In preaching my gospel to Glaucus I had left out
  <i>"the Lord"</i>&mdash;the life and soul of the precept! If "the Lord" had
  been in me, as He was in Isaiah and in Paul, I could not have left Him out.
  But I left Him out because He was not in me. The truth was that I had no true
  gospel to preach.</p>

  <p>In great dejection I was on the point of retiring to rest when it occurred
  to me that I had left unfinished, and indeed hardly begun, the study of
  Christ's words in the Corinthian epistle. Too weary to resume it now, I
  extinguished the light and flung myself down to forget in sleep all thought
  of study. But I could not forget. All through the dreams of a restless and
  troubled night ran threads of tangled imaginations about what those words
  would prove to be, intertwined with other imaginations about the words of
  Christ to Paul at his conversion. Along with these came shadows or shapes,
  with voices or voice-like sounds:&mdash;Epictetus gazing on the burning
  Christians in Rome, Paul listening to the voice of Christ near Damascus,
  Elijah on Horeb amid the roar of the tempest. Last of all, I myself, Silanus,
  stood at the door of a chamber in Jerusalem where Christ (I knew) was present
  with His disciples, and from this chamber there began to steal forth a still
  small voice, breathing and spreading everjrwhere an unspeakable
  peace&mdash;when a whirlwind scattered everything and hurried me away to the
  Neronian gardens in Rome.</p>

  <p>There, someone, masked, took me by the hand and forced me to look at the
  Christian martyr whom he was causing to be tortured. I thought it was Nero.
  But the mask fell off and it was Paul. The martyrs looked down on us and
  blessed us. Paul trembled but held me fast. I felt that I had become one with
  him, a persecutor and a murderer. They all looked up to heaven as though they
  saw something there. At that, Paul vanished, Avith a loud cry, leaving me
  alone. Fear fell upon me lest, if I looked up, I should see that which the
  martyrs saw. So I kept my eyes fixed on the ground. But the blessings of
  those whom I had persecuted seemed to enter into me taking me captive and
  forcing me to do as they did. Then I too looked up and I saw&mdash;that which
  they saw, Jesus the crucified. I tried to cry out "I see nothing, I see
  nothing," but my voice would not speak. I struggled to regain control over my
  tongue, and in the struggle I awoke.</p>

  <p>I had dreamed long past my usual hour for rising; and the lecture was
  already beginning when I took my seat next Glaucus. It was a relief to me to
  find him there; for his late outbreak of bitterness had made me fear that he
  might prove a deserter. Epictetus was describing man as being the work of a
  divine Artist, a wonderful sculpture, he said, superior to the Athene of
  Phidias. Appealing to us individually, "God," he said, "has not only created
  you, but has also trusted you to yourself alone, and committed the
  guardianship of you to yourself, saying 'I had no one more trustworthy than
  yourself to take charge of yourself. Preserve this person for me, such as he
  is by nature, modest, faithful, magnanimous'"&mdash;and he added many other
  eulogistic epithets. Here Glaucus passed me his notes with a bitter smile,
  pointing to the words "preserve me this person such as he is by nature." He
  had marked them with a query. Nor could I help querying them in my mind. I
  felt that at all events they were liable to be interpreted in a ridiculous
  way. My thought was, "Paul bids us trust in God or in the Son of God.
  Epictetus never does this. But here he says that God trusts us to ourselves.
  Does He then trust babies to preserve themselves? And if not, when does He
  begin to trust us&mdash;whether as boys or as youths or as men&mdash;to
  preserve ourselves as we are by nature?" And here I may say that, as regards
  belief, or trust, or faith, Epictetus diflfered altogether from Paul. The
  former inveighed against babblers, who "trust" their secrets to strangers,
  and against the Academic philosopher for saying "<i>Believe</i> me it is
  impossible to find anything to be <i>believed</i> in." But he never insisted
  (as Paul does) on the marvellous power possessed by a well-based belief or
  faith to influence men's lives for good. For the most part Epictetus used the
  word "belief," like the words "pity" and "prayer," in a bad sense.</p>

  <p>But to return to the lecture. In order to illustrate his favourite topic
  of the necessity of seeking happiness in oneself, Epictetus, as it were,
  called up Medea on the stage, expostulating with her for her want of
  self-control: "Do not desire your husband, then none of your desires will
  feil to be realised." She complained that she was to be banished from
  Corinth. "Well," said he, "Do not desire to remain in Corinth." He concluded
  by advising her to desire that which God desires. "And then," said he, "who
  will hinder or constrain you any more than Zeus is constrained?" To me, even
  as a dramatic illustration, such advice seemed grotesque. Nor was it a good
  preparation for what followed, in which he bade us give up desires and
  passions relating, not only to honour and oflBce, but also to country,
  friends, children: "Give them all up freely to Zeus and to the other Gods.
  Make a complete surrender to the Gods. Let the Gods be your pilots. Let your
  desires be with them. Then how can your voyage be unprosperous? But if you
  envy, if you pity, if you are jealous, if you are timid, how do you dare to
  call yourself a philosopher?"</p>

  <p>I could perceive that Glaucus was ill pleased at this, and especially at
  the connexion of "pity" with "envy"&mdash;though it was not the first time,
  nor the last, that I heard Epictetus speak of "pity" in this contemptuous
  way. Perhaps others were in the same mood as Glaucus, and perhaps our Teacher
  felt it. If he did, he at all events made no effort to smooth away what he
  had said. Far from it, he seemed to harden himself in order to reproach us
  for our slackness and for being philosophers only in name. "Observe and test
  yourselves," he exclaimed, "and find out what your philosophy really is. You
  are Epicureans&mdash;barring perhaps a few weak-kneed Peripatetics. Stoic
  reasonings, of course, you have in plenty. But show me a Stoic man! Show me
  only one! By the Gods, I long, I long to see one Stoic man. But perhaps you
  have one&mdash;only not as yet quite completed? Show him, then, uncompleted!
  Show him to me a little way towards completion! I am an old man now. Do me
  this one last kindness! Do not grudge me this boon&mdash;a sight that up to
  this day my eyes have never enjoyed!"</p>

  <p>We were all very quiet at this outburst, so unusual in our Teacher. Two or
  three youths near my seat seemed stimulated rather than depressed. But to me
  it seemed a sad confession of failure, amounting, in effect, to this, "I have
  taught from the days of Vespasian to the second year of Hadrian. My business
  has been to produce Stoics. Up to this day, a real Stoic is"&mdash;these were
  his words&mdash;<i>"a sight that up to this day my eyes have never
  enjoyed."</i> What a contrast, thought I, between my Teacher (for "mine" I
  still called him) and that other, the Jew, Paul, (whom I refused to call
  "mine") who numbered his pupils by cities, and whose campaigns from Jerusalem
  to Rome, through Asia and Greece, had been a succession of victories, leading
  trains of prisoners captive under the banner of the Crucified!</p>

  <p>What followed amazed me, forcing me to the conclusion that Epictetus was
  profoundly ignorant of human nature, at all events of our nature, and perhaps
  of his own. For instead of saying, "We have been on the wrong road," or "You
  have not the power to walk, and I have not the power to make you walk," he
  found fault with himself and us, without attempting to show what the fault
  was. At first it seemed our lack of noble ambition. "Not one of you," he
  exclaimed, "desires, from being man, to pass into becoming God. Not one of
  you is planning how he may pass through the dungeon of this paltry body to
  fellowship with Zeus!" But then he shifted his ground, saying, in effect, "I
  am your teacher. You are my pupils. My aim is so to perfect your characters
  that each of you may live unrestrained, uncoerced, unhindered, unshackled,
  free, prosperous, blessed, looking to God alone in every matter great or
  small. You, on your side, come here to learn and to practise these things.
  Why, then, do you fail to do the work in hand, if you on your side have the
  right aim, object, and purpose, and <i>I on my side&mdash;in addition to
  right aim, object, and purpose&mdash;have the right preparation?</i> What is
  deficient?"</p>

  <p>Here was our Master assuming as absolutely certain that he had <i>"the
  right preparation"</i>! But that was just the point on which I had long felt
  doubtful, and was now beginning to feel absolutely certain in a negative
  sense. However, he continued with the same perfect confidence in himself and
  in the practicability of his theory, "I am the carpenter, you the material.
  If the work is practicable, and yet is not completed, the fault must rest
  with you or with me. Then he concluded with the following personal appeal;
  these were his exact words, "Is not this matter "&mdash;he meant the art of
  living as a son of Zeus, free, and in perfect peace&mdash;"capable of being
  taught? It is. Is it not in our own hands? Nay, it is the only thing that is
  in our own hands. Wealth is not in our own hands, health is not, reputation
  is not. Nothing is&mdash;except the right use of our imaginations. This is
  the only thing that is by nature ours, unpreventable, unhinderable. Why do
  you not perform it then? Tell me the reason. Your non-performance is either
  my fault, or your fault, or the natural and inherent fault of our business.
  Now our business, in itself, is practicable, and is indeed the only business
  that is always practicable. It remains, then, that the fault rests either
  with me, or with you, or, which is nearer the truth, with both of us. What is
  to be done, then? Are you willing that we should begin together, at last
  though late, to bring this purpose into effect? Let bygones be bygones. Only
  let us begin. Believe me, and you will see."</p>

  <p>With that, he dismissed us. I was curious to know what Glaucus thought of
  it, so I waited for him to speak. To my surprise, he said, "It is not often
  that the Master speaks in this way or suggests that he himself may be in
  fault. Who knows? He may have something new in store. I felt so angry with
  him at the beginning of the lecture that I was within an ace of going
  straight out. But now, as he says, 'Let bygones be bygones.' I shall go on
  with him a little longer. What say you? For the most part he is too cold for
  me, always talking about the Logos within us, and the God within us, as
  though I, Glaucus the son of Adeimantus, who need the help of all the Gods
  that are, were myself all the God that I needed! He chills me with his Logos.
  But when he appealed to us in that personal way 'Believe me,' he gave me
  quite a new sensation. Did it not stir you? I don't think I ever heard him
  say that before."</p>

  <p>"It did stir me," said I, "and I am sure I never heard him say it before.
  Plato represents Socrates as always persuading his hearers to 'follow the
  Logos,' not to follow Socrates; and Epictetus, for the most part, uses
  similar language. For the rest, I am not sure that our Master will do me all
  the good I had hoped. But I shall do as you do. We shall still sit, I hope,
  together." So we parted.</p>

  <p>I had not said more than the truth. Epictetus had stirred me, but not in
  the way in which he had stirred Glaucus. "Let bygones be bygones"&mdash;the
  "bygones" of nearly forty years! Why were they to be "bygones"? Had they no
  lesson to teach? Did they not suggest that for forty years Epictetus had been
  on the road to failure and that he had consequently failed? Could I believe
  that during all that time Epictetus himself had been deficient in "purpose"?
  Not for a day! Not for a moment!</p>

  <p>As I sat down to revise the notes of my lecture, it occurred to me that
  Glaucus&mdash;who was of a much less settled temperament than Arrian&mdash;
  must have heard better news from home, and that this helped him to take a
  brighter view of things in general and of philosophy in particular. "If my
  old friend were here," said I, "would he not regard Glaucus's change of mood
  as one more instance of Epictetus's power to 'make his hearers feel precisely
  what he desired them to feel'? But what if I went on to say that this 'power'
  was mere rhetoric, not indeed 'wisdom of word' in the sense of hair-splitting
  logic, but 'wisdom of speech,' the knowledge of the language and imagery best
  fitted to stir the emotions? What would Arrian say to that?"</p>

  <p>I mentally constructed a dialogue between us. "There is something more,
  Silanus." "But what more?" "That I do not know. Only I know there is
  something more behind." Then Scaurus's explanation recurred to me of that
  "something more behind." For Scaurus had asserted that Epictetus had been
  touched by what he called the Christian superstition, which, although he had
  shaken it off, had left in his mind a blank, a vacant niche, which he vainly
  tried to fill with the image of a Hercules or a Diogenes. That brought back
  to my thoughts Scaurus's first mention of "Christus"; and then it came upon
  me as a shock that I had spent half-an-hour in my rooms, musing over
  Epictetus and Glaucus and Arrian, and there, on the table before me, was
  Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians containing his only quotation of the
  words of the Lord, and I had taken no notice of it. So I put my notes aside
  and unrolled the epistle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; PAUL'S ONLY RECORD OF WORDS OF
     CHRIST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE first words of the sentence were, "For <i>I</i> received

  myself"</i> or "Whatever others may have received, <i>I</i> received so and

  the night on which he was to be delivered over... Here I paused and looked
  back, to see what "for" meant (in "<i>for</i> I received") and why Paul was
  introducing this saying of the Lord. I found that the apostle had been
  warning the Corinthians thus, "Ye meet together, not for the better, but for
  the worse." In the first place, he said, there were dissensions among them,
  and in the next place, "When ye come together it is not possible to eat the
  Lord's Supper, for each one taketh his own supper, and one is hungry while
  another is drunken." Then I understood that the Lord's Supper meant that same
  Christian feast of which Arrian had spoken. This interested me because in
  Rome, as a boy, I had heard it said that the Christians partook of "a
  Thyestean meal," that is, they killed children and served up the flesh to the
  parents. This I do not think I had myself believed, except perhaps in the
  nursery; but it was commonly taken as truth among the lower classes in
  Rome.</p>

  <p>Now I perceived that the meal was to have been a joint one&mdash;like that
  of the Spartan public meals or syssitia, where all fed alike. But in that
  luxurious city of Corinth many of the Christians had introduced Corinthian
  luxury and turned the public meal into a group of private meals, so that some
  had too little and others too much. Paul tried to bring them back to better
  things by telling them what Christ said to his disciples on the night of his
  last meal, "the night on which he was to be delivered over." He implied that
  their meal ought to have been like Christ's last meal; and now the question
  for me was, what that, the Lord's Supper, was like.</p>

  <p>But first I had to ask myself the meaning of Christ's being "delivered
  over." About this I had no doubt that it referred to the prophecy in Isaiah
  concerning the Suffering Servant, who "was <i>delivered over</i> on account
  of our sins." These words Paul had quoted in the epistle to the Romans, and
  he elsewhere spoke of God, or the Father, as "giving," or <i>"delivering
  over"</i> the Son for the salvation of mankind. Now both Isaiah and Paul had
  made it quite clear that the Servant, or Son, thus "delivered over" by the
  Father, goes voluntarily to death, and this I assumed to be the case here.
  But I did not know by what agency God was said to have "delivered him over."
  I thought it might be by a warning or daemonic voice, as in the case of
  Socrates, bidding him surrender himself to the laws of his country. Or
  Christ's own people, the citizens of Jerusalem, might have delivered him up
  to Pilate, to procure their own exemption from punishment on account of some
  rebellion or sedition. Or he might be said to have been delivered over by a
  decree of Fate, to which he voluntarily submitted.</p>

  <p>So much was I in the dark that for a moment I thought of Christ as
  fighting at the head of an army of his countrymen and giving himself up for
  their sakes, like Protesilaus or the Decii; and I tried to picture Christ
  doing this, or something like this. But I failed. Still I was being guided
  rightly so far as this, that I began faintly to recognise that this
  "delivering over" might be not a mere propitiation of Nemesis, occurring now
  and then in battles, but part of the laws of the Cosmopolis, occurring often
  when a deliverance is to be wrought for any community of men. Of such a
  propitiation Protesilaus was the symbol, concerning whom Homer says,</p>

  <p class="verse">"First of the Achaeans leaped he on Troy's shore<br>
  Long before all the rest..."</p>

  <p>He leaped first, in order to fall first. But his country rose by his fall.
  His wife sorrowed, "desolate in Thessaly," and his house was left "half
  built." But in the minds of men he abides among the firstfruits of the noble
  dead, who have counted it life to lay down life for others. This legend I now
  began to apply to spiritual things. I was being prepared to believe that the
  sons of God in all places and times must needs be in various ways and
  circumstances "delivering themselves over" as sacrifices to the will of God,
  in proportion to their goodness, wisdom, and strength&mdash;the good spending
  their life-blood for the evil, the wise for the foolish, the strong for the
  weak.</p>

  <p>After this, came a sentence that perplexed me greatly, "This is my body,
  which is in your behalf Do this to my remembering or reminding." Not being
  able to make any sense at all of this, I read on, in hope of light: "In the
  same way also the cup, after supper, sajdng. This cup is the new covenant in
  my blood." The word "covenant" helped me a little, because I had found Paul
  speaking elsewhere to the Corinthians in his own person about a "new
  covenant" and an "old covenant." Also to the Galatians he mentioned "two
  covenants," one of which, he said, "corresponds to Mount Sinai." So I turned
  to the scripture that described how God made a "covenant" with Israel that
  they should obey the Law given to them from Mount Sinai. It had these words:
  "And Moses, having taken the blood "&mdash;that is, the blood from a
  <i>"sacrifice of salvation"</i> consisting of bullocks&mdash;"sprinkled it on
  the people and said, 'Behold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has
  covenanted with you concerning all these words'." The blood of the old
  covenant (I perceived) was blood of "sprinkling," purifying the body. David
  prayed for something more than that, when he said, "Create in me a clean
  heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." So it occurred to me that
  the "new covenant" was to purify, not the body but the heart and the spirit,
  entering into man and becoming part of him so as to cleanse him from
  within.</p>

  <p>This seemed to agree with Paul's opinion, and with what I had read in
  Isaiah, that the sacrifices of bulls and goats cannot make the heart clean.
  Now, therefore, going back again to the first words "This is my body, which
  is in your behalf," I inferred that Christ was speaking about Himself as
  being the <i>"sacrifice of salvation"</i> above mentioned, and that He used
  these words, purposing to devote Himself to death for the people, in order to
  redeem them from sin by purifying their hearts.</p>

  <p>I am writing now in old age. Forty-five years have passed since the night
  when I first read, "This is my body, which is in your behalf." During that
  interval I have done my best to ascertain the exact words spoken by the
  Saviour in His own tongue. And now it is much more clear to me than it was
  then that the Lord Jesus was herein giving Himself, His very self, both as a
  legacy to the disciples and also as a ransom for their souls. But even then I
  perceived that some such meaning must be attached to the words, and that they
  could not have been invented by any disciple; and they made me marvel more
  than anything else that I had met with in the Jewish scriptures or Paul's
  epistles. Such a confidence did they show in the power of His own love, as
  being stronger than death! I do not say that I believed that the words had
  been fulfilled. But I felt sure that Christ had uttered them in the belief of
  their being fulfilled; and, just for a few moments, the notion that He should
  have been deceived seemed to me so contrary to the fitness of things, and to
  the existence of any kind of Providence, that I almost believed that they
  must have had some kind of fulfilment. I did not stay to ask, "How
  fulfilled?" I merely said, "This is divine, this is like the 'still small
  voice.' This is past man's invention. This must be from God."</p>

  <p>Then I checked myself, doubt rising up within me. "Paul," I said, "was not
  present on the night of the Last Supper. He says concerning these words, 'I
  received of the Lord that which I also delivered unto you.' Is it not strange
  that the oracles or revelations supposed by Paul to have been delivered to
  him by Jesus after the resurrection should have included matters of
  historical fact, and historical utterances, which could have been ascertained
  from the disciples that heard them? I must wait till I receive the Christian
  gospels from Flaccus."</p>

  <p>Then this also occurred to me. "Socrates, too, like Christ, was unjustly
  condemned. Socrates might have escaped from death, but he refused. The
  daemonic voice that told him what to do and not to do, bade him remain and
  die, and he obeyed. In effect, then, this voice from heaven <i>'delivered
  over'</i> Socrates to death. Or he may be said to have <i>'delivered himself
  over.'</i> Now what were the last words of Socrates? Did he leave any such
  legacy to his disciples? Might I not find some help here? For assuredly
  Socrates, like Christ, endeavoured to make men better and wiser." I
  remembered hearing Epictetus say&mdash;and I recognised the truth of the
  saying&mdash;"Even now, when Socrates is dead, the memory of the words and
  deeds of his life is no less profitable to men, perhaps it is more so, than
  when he lived." So I turned over Arrian's notes and found several remarks of
  our Master about Socrates and his contempt for death; and with what a
  humorous appearance of sympathy he accepted the jailer's tears, though he
  himself felt they were altogether misplaced. At last I came to a passage
  where Epictetus compared Socrates, on his trial, and in his last moments, to
  a man playing at ball: "And what was the ball in that case? Life, chains,
  exile, a draught of poison, to be parted from a wife,, to leave one's
  children orphans. These were his playthings, but none the less he kept on
  playing and throwing the ball with grace and dexterity."</p>

  <p>This was enough, and more than enough. It was hopeless,. I perceived, to
  search in Epictetus for what I sought&mdash;some last legacy of Socrates to
  his disciples, implying that he longed to help them after death. Epictetus
  would have rebuked me, saying, "How could he help them when he was dissolved
  into the four elements? What could Socrates bequeath to them beyond the
  memory of his words and deeds?"</p>

  <p>Failing Epictetus, I took out from my bookcase such works of Plato and
  Xenophon as might contain the last thoughts of Socrates. Both of these
  writers believed in the immortality of the soul. Yet I could not find either
  of them asserting, or suggesting, that Socrates felt any trouble or anxiety
  for his friends and for their faith, nor any token of a hope that his soul
  might help theirs after his death&mdash;or rather, to use his phrase,, after
  he had "transferred his habitation." When I tried to fiind such a hope, I
  could not feel sure that I was interpreting the words honestly. It seemed to
  me that I was importing something of the Jewish <i>pathos</i>, or feeling,
  into an utterance of the Greek <i>logos</i>. I still retained the conviction
  that Socrates, in his last moments, had his disciples at heart, and that, in
  enjoining that last sacrifice to Aesculapius, he wished to stimulate them to
  something more spiritual and more permanent than that single literal act. But
  I longed for something more. I thought of Christ s "constraining love," and
  how a man might be "constrained" in a natural way by the love of the
  dead&mdash;the love of a wife, father, mother, or child. Such a love I said,
  might be no less powerful, for help and comfort, than the hate of
  Clytemnestra following Orestes for evil. Aeneas {I remembered) used the word
  <i>"image,"</i> speaking to the spirit of Anchises, "Thy <i>image</i>, O my
  father, constrained me to come hither." But Anchises replies that he himself
  had been all the while following his son in his perilous wanderings, so that
  it was not a mere <i>"image,"</i> It was a <i>presence</i>. "Is it possible,"
  I asked, "that Christ, not in poetry but in fact, thought of bequeathing to
  His disciples such a presence, to follow and help them after His death?"</p>

  <p>Yes. It seemed quite possible, nay, almost certain&mdash;that Christ
  thought this. But who, except a Christian, would believe that the thought was
  more than a dream?" Scaurus," I said, "who often jests at me as a dreamer,
  would now jest more than ever. Here am I, pondering poetry, when I ought to
  be studying history! Yet how can I study history in Paul, when Paul himself
  tells me that he received these words from one that had died&mdash;presumably
  therefore in a vision? The right course will be to wait till Flaccus sends me
  the gospels. These may chance to be historical biographies&mdash;not records
  of things seen, or words heard, in visions." And then Scaurus's saying
  recurred to me, that no two writers agree independently in recording a speech
  or conversation for twenty consecutive words that are exactly the same. "And
  this," said I, "I hope to test before many days are over, with regard to
  these mysterious words of Christ."</p>

  <p>But before rolling up the book it came into my mind that Paul said
  somewhere to the Romans "I beseech you therefore by the compassionate mercies
  of God to present your bodies a <i>living sacrifice</i>, holy, acceptable to
  God." Having found these words and read them carefully over, I thought that
  the writer must have had in view some allusion to the sacrifice of Isaac. For
  that was the only "living sacrifice" that I could find (and indeed it is the
  only one) mentioned in scripture. Then I turned to the first book of the Law
  and there I found that God's promise of Isaac to Abraham had been called a
  covenant, and this, said Paul to the Galatians, was, so to speak, the real
  <i>thought</i> of God. The covenant of Sinai was only an afterthought. The
  sign of Abraham's covenant by promise was in the blood of circumcision
  stamped permanently on man's body. The sign of the covenant of Sinai was in
  the blood of bullocks merely sprinkled on the body. Also there was yet
  another covenant between God and man, earlier than both of these. This, the
  earliest covenant of all, was with Noah. Now the sign of this was not on man
  at all, but on the sky, being the rainbow. And in the covenant with Noah
  there was no mention of blood (either of man or beast) except this&mdash;that
  man was not to taste the blood of beasts when he ate their flesh, and that he
  was not to pour out the blood of men, much less to taste of it.</p>

  <p>Then it seemed to me that the words and thoughts of Christ, being a Jew,
  must be studied in the light of the words and thoughts of his countrymen the
  ancient Jews. The first covenant, that of Noah, said, "The blood is the life,
  therefore ye shall not taste of blood; and whosoever shall taste of blood,
  whether of man or beast, shall die; and whosoever shall pour out the blood of
  man, his blood shall be poured out and he shall die." This was confirmed by
  the Covenant of Moses the Lawgiver. Then came a second covenant, that of the
  Son, saying, "I have changed all that. I am the New Covenant. The New
  Covenant is in my blood, that is, in my life. My blood is truly my life. Ye
  shall taste of my blood. It shall be poured out for all, as a living
  sacrifice. Whosoever shall taste of my blood shall not die but shall live for
  ever, even as I Hve."</p>

  <p>Looking back now to that moment, I seem to perceive that I was being led
  on by the Spirit of God, far beyond my own natural powers of thought and
  reason, in order that I might have some foretaste of the revelation of the
  Lord's sacrifice, so as to be strengthened and prepared for the trial that
  was shortly to fall upon me, when I was to be dragged away from the shore
  that I had just touched, back again into the tumultuous deep. For a long time
  I continued musing on this mystery, and turning over passage after passage in
  Paul's epistles describing how believers are all one "in Christ," and "Christ
  in them," and how they are made righteous, or brought near to God, "in the
  blood of Christ."</p>

  <p>So passed the greater part of the day, up till the ninth hour. Then came a
  reaction. The thought of Scaurus returned, and of his criticisms. " He is
  right," I said, "I am a dreamer. I will go out into the fields." So I went
  out, taking my Virgil as company. When I came into the woods I sat down in
  the warmth of the westering sun. There, for a time, listening to the songs of
  the thrushes and the cooing of the doves, I felt at peace, and opened my
  Virgil, intending to read about the bees and the fields. But I had brought
  the Aeneid by mistake, and the first words I met were these:</p>

  <p class="verse">"Si nunc se nobis ille aureus arbore ramus<br>
  Ostendat nemore in tanto!"</p>

  <p>Then back again came suggestions of doubt. For I recognised it as a kind
  of oracle from the Gods, that I must still be seeking for the light of the
  truth in the dark forest of error, and that I could not find it without
  divine help. "But," said I, as I started up to return home, "it shall be such
  help as a Roman may accept without shame. The faith of Junius Silanus shall
  never be constrained by spells, or incantations, or by anything except
  reasonable conviction and the force of facts."</p>

  <p>Returning home as the sun was sinking I found letters awaiting me. Among
  these, one was from Flaccus, saying that he had sent me three little
  Christian books called "gospels," in accordance with my order. After his
  usual fitshion, addressing me as the son of his old master, but also as a
  companion in the fellowship of book-lovers, he added some remarks on the
  contents of the parcel. "The third of these books," he said, "is written by a
  man of some education, named Lucas, a companion of Paulus (whose works I
  recently sent you); and he has published a supplementary volume, which I have
  ventured to add although you did not order it. The supplement is entitled
  'The Acts of the Apostles,' that is, of the missionaries sent out by
  Christus. The 'gospel,' as you probably know, is a record of the acts and
  words of Christus himself. Also, as you are interested in this sect, I have
  sent you a book called the Revelation of John. It is written in most
  extraordinary Greek, without pretensions to grammar, much less to style. But
  it has some poetic touches in it. Of the eastern style, of course. But that
  you will understand. This John was himself&mdash;(I am told)&mdash;one of
  their 'apostles,' and a man of note among the Christians. He is said to have
  written it soon after the reign of Domitian."</p>

  <p>There was also a letter from Scaurus, or rather a packet of letters. Out
  of it fell a separate note of the nature of a postscript, and I read that
  first, as follows: "Two things I forgot to say. First, if you decide to open
  my sealed note about the similarities of Paul and Epictetus, I shall not now
  feel hurt. For the reasons I have given in my letter, I hope you will not
  open it, because I trust you will turn your mind to other matters. But I do
  not now regard that note as important. By this time, you probably have the
  books of the Christians. You also know more than you did about Epictetus, so
  you have been able to judge for yourself whether I have not spoken the truth.
  But now&mdash;I repeat&mdash;my advice is to put the whole investigation
  aside. Go to lUyria and see whether you cannot fimd an opening there for a
  military philosopher."</p>

  <p>As to the sealed note, I have explained above that, when I opened it, I
  found it was, as Scaurus said, of very little importance to me&mdash;knowing
  what I then knew. Such effect as it had on me was produced before I had
  opened it, because it provoked my curiosity and stimulated me to study the
  books of the Christians.</p>

  <p>The postscript continued as follows. "The second thing, much more
  important, concerns a fundamental matter in this Christian superstition. You
  know, I am sure, from Paul's letters, that the ancient Jews&mdash;better
  called Israelites&mdash;have always claimed that God has honoured them above
  all nations by making a special 'treaty' or 'covenant' with them. Well, Paul
  admits this for Jews, but claims for Christians that they have a still better
  'treaty' or 'covenant,' which he calls 'new,' as distinct from that of the
  Jews, which he calls 'old.' He represents his leader, Christ, as making or
  ratifying this 'new covenant' with his blood, on the night on which he was
  betrayed. Not only this, but he gives the exact words uttered by
  Christ&mdash;and, mark you, <i>this is the only occasion on which he quotes
  any words of Christ at all.</i> Not only this, but he says that he received
  them from his leader; 'I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
  over to you.' Now, Silanus, look for yourself. Do not believe me. Look in
  Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, some way after the middle, and see
  whether he does not quote these words, 'This cup is the new covenant in my
  blood. Do this as often as ye are drinking, to my remembering.' What the
  words mean I do not precisely know. But there they are. Next look in the
  three gospels."</p>

  <p>"Now," said I, "I shall get light." I put down the letter and took up the
  three gospels&mdash;the packet from Flaccus. But a glance showed that it
  would be a long and diflScult business to find the passage in them, and to
  compare their three versions with the one in Paul's epistle. So I turned to
  the postscript again, "Next look in the three gospels and prepare to be
  surprised. You will find the following four facts. First, none of them
  contain the words 'Do this to my remembering.' Secondly, the latest gospel
  (that of Lucas) makes no mention of a 'covenant.' Thirdly, the two earliest
  gospels do not call the covenant 'new.' Fourthly, the Greek word may mean not
  'covenant' at all, but 'testament'; and the meaning may be that their leader
  bequeaths them his blood&mdash;whatever that may mean&mdash;by his last will
  and testament.</p>

  <p>"Now I put it to you, Silanus, as a reasonable man, whether it is worth
  while investigating a superstition as to which the earliest documents
  disagree concerning such a fundamental fact (or rather allegation). These
  Christians&mdash;for I am informed they mostly take Paul's view&mdash;assert
  that their Founder made a <i>'new covenant'</i> between them and God on a
  special night. Three of them give accounts&mdash;detailed accounts&mdash;of
  all manner of things that happened on that night. A fourth, Paul, professes
  to give the very words of the Founder of the Covenant, as he received them
  from the Founder himself, not alive of course but dead! And he, Paul,
  <i>alone of the four, mentions the phrase 'new covenant.'</i> What do you
  think of this?"</p>

  <p>Indeed I did not know what to think of it. And Scaurus's next words almost
  decided me to take his view of the whole matter, to put away all my Jewish
  and Christian books and to have done with every kind of philosophy. "Spare
  me," so the postscript proceeded, "for the sake of the immortal Gods, my
  dearest Quintus, spare me the pain&mdash;during the few years or months of
  life that may still remain for me&mdash;of seeing the son of my dearest
  friend ensnared in the net of a beguiling superstition that must lead you
  away from your duty to your country. Be kind to me and to your father."</p>

  <p>Not having read the preceding part of his letter, I was amazed at this
  outburst of alarm in my behalf But I perceived that, with his usual
  sympathetic insight, he had read some of my thoughts almost before I was
  conscious of them myself, and I was grateful to him. If he had stopped there,
  I sometimes think things might have happened differently. But he continued,
  "<i>Truth</i>, as Sophocles says, <i>is always right.</i> Be true to the
  truth. Be true to yourself Amid all the shifting fancies and falsehoods
  around you, esteem the knowledge of yourself the only knowledge that is
  certain and unchangeable. In that respect the old philosophers were right.
  'Know thyself' is the only divine precept. On self-knowledge alone is based
  the only covenant&mdash;if indeed it is fit to imagine any
  covenant&mdash;between God and man."</p>

  <p>From these last words I found myself in absolute revolt. During the past
  few days I had come to think that perhaps the only certain and unchangeable
  truth was that self-knowledge without other knowledge is impossible, or, if
  possible, most harmful. Dissenting from these last words I went back to
  dissent further, or rather to draw a different inference. "Truth is always
  right." Then could it be right for me to give up the search for truth, lest I
  should pain myself or Scaurus? From my father, one of the most just and
  honourable of men, how often had I heard the maxim, <i>Audi alteram
  partem!</i> Why should I not "hear the other side" since that very day had
  placed at my disposal (thanks to Flaccus) the means of doing this? Scaurus
  had indirectly challenged me to do it. My father had, in a sense, commanded
  it. Before I retired to rest that night, I resolved to devote the whole of
  the next day, and as much time as I could spare afterwards, to the
  examination of the Christian gospels.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">XIX. &mdash; HOW SCAURUS STUDIED THE THREE GOSPELS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BEGINNING with the passages that described the Lord's
  Supper, I soon found that Scaurus was correct in saying that the words of the
  Lord quoted by Paul were not in any of the gospels. But my copy of
  Luke&mdash;an old one, having been transcribed in the reign of the emperor
  Nerva as the scribe stated&mdash;contained a note in the margin, not in the
  scribe's handwriting, "After <i>'my body'</i> some later copies have these
  words, <i>'which is being given in your behalf. Do this to my remembering;
  and the cup likewise, after supping, saying, This cup is the new testament in
  my blood which is being shed for you'</i>." Now these words were very similar
  to Paul's quotation, and Flaccus had told me that Luke was a companion of
  Paul. So I reflected that Luke must often have partaken of the Christian
  Supper with Paul, and must have heard these words from Paul. Why therefore
  were the words omitted in Luke, except in "some later copies"? Mark, Matthew,
  and Paul agreed in inserting some mention of "covenant." Why did Luke, Paul's
  companion, alone omit it?</p>

  <p>Looking into the matter more closely, I found that Luke, though he omitted
  the phrase about "covenant," <i>inserted in his context some mention of
  "covenanting," or "making covenant,"</i> as follows: "I <i>covenant</i> unto
  you as my Father <i>covenanted</i> unto me." The "covenant" was "a kingdom,
  that ye may eat and drink at my table." Also, in the same context, Jesus
  said, "The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who play the
  despot over them are called"&mdash;I think he meant, "called" by their
  flatterers&mdash;"benefactors. But you, not so."</p>

  <p>And Jesus went on to say, "He that ruleth must be as he that serveth,"
  and, "I am among you as he that serveth." The words "my Father covenanted
  unto me" appeared to mean a covenant of sacrifice, namely, that the Son was
  to sacrifice Himself for the sins of the world, and to pass, through that
  sacrifice, into the Kingdom at the right hand of the Father. And the other
  words meant that Jesus "covenanted" with the disciples that they should
  sacrifice themselves in like manner, taking Him as it were into themselves,
  by drinking the blood of the sacrifice (that is, His blood) and eating its
  flesh or body (that is, His body). And thus they, too, being made one with
  Him, were to pass into the Kingdom.</p>

  <p>Such a "covenant" as this, would, I perceived, be so "new" that it might
  be described as turning the world upside down&mdash;all the kings serving
  their subjects, all the masters waiting on their servants. This was indeed
  strange. But it was not peculiar to Luke. Mark and Matthew (I found) had a
  similar doctrine, though not in this passage; only, instead of "I am among
  you as he that serveth," they had, "to give his soul as a ransom for many."
  This accorded with what was said above, namely, that the "covenant," or
  condition, on which the Son came into the world, was, that He should be the
  "servant," or "sacrifice," or "ransom," for mankind. All three names
  expressed aspects of one and the same thing. David had said, "The sacrifice
  of the Lord is a contrite spirit." That meant, contrite for one's own sins.
  Jesus seemed to go outside a man's self, and to say, "The sacrifice of the
  Lord is a spirit of service to others" Romans, I reflected, would call this
  doctrine either an impracticable dream, or&mdash;if practicable, and if
  attempted&mdash;a pestilent revolution. But once more the thought recurred
  that the Jew would say to us, as the Egyptian said to Solon, "You Romans are
  but children," and that, although Rome had the power (as Virgil said) of
  "subjecting the proud oppressors in war," it might not have what Epictetus
  described as the power of the true Ruler (which this Jewish Ruler seemed to
  claim), namely, to draw the subjects towards the ruler with the chain of
  "passionate affection."</p>

  <p>Scaurus next asserted that some disagreements here between the evangelists
  arose from translating Hebrew into Greek. Where Mark has "and they drank,"
  Matthew has "drink ye." Scaurus said that the same Hebrew might produce these
  two Greek translations. "Also," said he, "supposing Jesus to have said in his
  native tongue, <i>This is my body for you</i>, some might take 'for you' to
  mean 'given <i>to you</i> as a gift,' but others 'given <i>for you</i> as a
  sacrifice'." Hence he inferred that it was hardly possible to discover what
  Jesus actually said, because, besides differences of memory in the witnesses,
  there might be differences of translation in those who remembered the same
  words. But on the other side, if Scaurus was right, the facts showed the
  independence of the witnesses, as well as their honesty and accuracy. If
  Jesus used one Jewish phrase that might imply two meanings, it seemed natural
  that his disciples should try to express both meanings in Greek. The nearness
  of the Passover (at the time when the words were uttered), and the connexion
  in scripture between "covenant" and "sacrifice," and many things that I had
  read in Paul's epistles, made me believe that "sacrifice" was implied. Why
  should not the disciples suppose that their Saviour bequeathed a legacy to
  them that was also a sacrifice for them? This seemed to me a beautiful and
  intelligible belief.</p>

  <p>The result was that I resolved not to give up the study of these books.
  Repeating my father's maxim, <i>Audi alteram partem</i>, "Scaurus," I said,
  "shall be on one side, and the three gospels"&mdash;which I spread out on the
  table&mdash;"shall be on the other." I soon found, however, that my task was
  not so simple. There was not merely "the other side," there were often three
  "sides"&mdash;so strangely did the gospels vary. Scaurus made a fourth, or,
  rather, a commentary on the three. From my youth up (thanks largely to
  Scaurus) I had some skill in comparing histories. It was necessary first (I
  perceived) to have the three gospels side by side. For this purpose, the
  penknife and the pen&mdash;the former for transposing, the latter for
  transcribing&mdash;had to be freely used. Mark's gospel I preserved intact.
  Extracts from Matthew and Luke&mdash;copying or cutting them out&mdash;I
  placed parallel to the corresponding passages in Mark. I also made use of
  marginal notes in my MS. referring me to parallel passages in the other
  gospels or in the scriptures. Some days were spent in this labour. After
  that, I determined to attend lectures regularly, but to devote all my leisure
  to a close examination of the gospels with the help of Scaurus's comments.
  Now I must speak of his letter.</p>

  <p>It began, as his postscript had ended, with a personal appeal, warning me
  against a tendency to dreaming, "which," said he, "I think you must have
  inherited from my Etrurian grandmother, whose blood runs in your
  veins&mdash;through your dear mother&mdash;as well as in mine. I myself, at
  times, have to fight against it." Then he cautioned me against the Jews.
  "They are all of them," he said, "dangerous people, though in dififerent
  ways. There are two sorts, plotters and dreamers; the plotters, all for
  themselves; the dreamers, all for someone else, or something else (the Gods
  know what!) outside themselves. Now a dreamer in the west, mostly a Greek
  (for a Roman dreamer is a rare bird) is a harmless creature&mdash;dreaming
  passively. But the Jewish dreamer dreams actively. He is, to use the Greek
  adjective, <i>hypnotic</i>. If I might invent a Greek verb, I would say that
  he <i>'hypnotizes'</i> people. He makes others dream what he dreams. And his
  dreams are not the dreams of Morpheus, 'golden slumbers' on 'heaped Elysian
  flowers.' No, they are often dreams like those of Hercules
  Furens&mdash;destroying himself and his friends while he thinks he is
  destroying 'powers of evil'! I have known several Jews, some very good, more
  very bad; only one, perhaps, half-and-half. That was Flavins Josephus, whose
  histories you have read. He could be all things to all men in a very clever
  way, mostly for his people, sometimes for himself</p>

  <p>"Paul was all things to all men in a very different way, and always the
  same way. Paul, as you know, frankly warns his readers, 'I am become all
  things to all men that I may by all means save some,' and 'I became to the
  Jews a Jew that I might gain the Jews'&mdash;not for himself, of course, but
  for his Master, the King of the Jews. I have never told you, before,
  something that I will tell you now&mdash;to warn you against these Jews,
  especially the Christian Jews. I once saw this Paul, only once. I was but a
  boy. He was standing, chained, in a corridor in the palace, waiting to be
  heard. One of the Praetorian guard was talking to him and Paul was replying,
  while my father and I were passing by; and my father, having something to say
  to the guardsman, made some courteous remark to Paul about interrupting their
  talk. Paul stood up. He was rather short, and bent down besides with the
  weight of his chains; and the guardsman (quite against regulations) had put a
  stool for him to rest on. He reached up his face to my father's as though he
  could not see very distinctly: but it was not exactly the eyes, but the look
  in them, the unearthly look, that I shall never forget. No doubt, he was
  thankful for the few syllables of kindness. It seemed to me as if he wished
  to return the kindness in kind. He said something. What it was I don't know.
  Probably bad Greek or worse Latin. Thanks of some sort, no doubt. But it was
  the look&mdash;the look and the tone, that struck me. Struck! No, rather,
  bewitched. For days and nights afterwards I saw that man's face, and heard
  his voice in my dreams. I did not like the dreams. But he made me dream. He
  was a retiarius. If he had had me alone for a day or two, I feel even now
  that he would have caught me in his Christian net. I don't want you to be
  caught."</p>

  <p>Then Scaurus went on to speak of himself at some length. I will set down
  his exact words for two reasons. First, they show what pains he had taken to
  prepare himself for the work of a critic. Secondly, his letter seemed to me
  to explain in part why he was so set against what he c&gt;alled the soporific
  or hypnotic art of Paul. He and I approached the apostle in dififerent
  circumstances. I came to Paul before coming to the gospels. He read the
  gospels first, and found it impossible to believe them. Then, with a mind
  settled and fixed against belief, approaching Paul, he found&mdash;this I
  believe to be the fact&mdash;that Paul was drawing him towards Christ. He
  resisted the constraint, thinking that he was resisting a sort of witchcraft.
  Yes, and even to the end of his life, he fought against the truth, seeing it
  masked as falsehood. Yet assuredly he loved the truth and spared no pains to
  reach it. Let my old friend speak for himself in what I will
  call&mdash;</p><br>

  <h3>SCAURUS'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY</h3>

  <p>"While I am in the mood for telling secrets I may say that, for me, too,
  this Christian superstition has not been without attractions; and, had there
  been anything solid in it, I think I should have ascertained it. You must
  know that in the last year or two of Domitian this sect was brought into
  notice in Rome among the highest circles by rather painful
  circumstances&mdash;painful, I mean, to me. I had retired from the army. As
  soon as I had recovered from my wounds, enough to be able to limp about, I
  looked round me for something to do. I was not in favour with the Emperor. He
  had lost reputation in the Dacian war; and he was supposed to dislike those
  officers&mdash;there were only a few&mdash;who had done creditably in that
  most discreditable business. I was supposed to be one of the few. At all
  events, in the 'regrettable incident' of Fuscus, I brought off most of my men
  safe, and we did not run away. Well, I thought I had better lead a retired
  life. So under the plea of disablement&mdash;which was unfortunately only too
  true, as I was lamed for life&mdash;I kept at home in Tusculum all through
  the reign of Domitian, giving myself up to literature.</p>

  <p>"Even as a boy, I was very fond of Greek, and I liked learning it in my
  own way and not according to the ways of my masters. My way was to commit to
  memory&mdash;and to keep in memory by constant repetition, a very diflferent
  thing from mere 'committing'&mdash;great masses of such literature as I liked
  best. Many and many a time have I met and passed a friend or schoolfellow in
  the Via Sacra, and heard his voice behind me, 'Are you going to cut me,
  Scaurus?' But I had not been 'Scaurus' when I passed him. I had been Medea
  frantic, or Demosthenes haranguing the Athenians, or Plato describing Thales
  on the well's brink, or&mdash;for I was an eclectic&mdash;Thucydides
  recording his personal experiences of the plague. I kept this up, even in the
  army. Many a long night in Dacia has been shortened in the company of my
  friends, the great Greek authors. The result of all this was, that when I
  reached consular age, and, instead of going in for consulships, went in for
  lameness and literature, I was well provided, so far as eoneemed the Greek
  raw material, for critical studies.</p>

  <p>"Well, as time went on, extending the course of my reading, I happened to
  pick up in Flaccus's shop a Greek translation of the Hebrew book of Job. It
  was a chaos, with occasional lucidities&mdash;some of them magnificent. On my
  showing it to a learned Jew (whom Josephus had recommended to me) he
  explained to me that the Greek translators had often been misled by
  similarities of Hebrew words. Hebrew is a queer language. It has vowels but
  does not write them. I saw at once what an abundant source of error this
  might be. Even in Latin, where vowels are written, I have known Greeks go
  wrong by rendering <i>amnis</i> as though it were <i>omnis</i>. How much
  more, if there were no vowels! My rabbi&mdash;that is their name for
  'teacher'&mdash;informed me that even the Greek-speaking Jews were now
  beginning to be dissatisfied with the Seventy (that is the name they give to
  their authorised version). Several new translations of some of the books were
  floating about, he said, and a good and faithful translation of the whole
  would probably be produced before long. This interested me. Under his
  guidance I studied the parallelisms in the two books of Esdras and other
  books of theirs. I learned just enough Hebrew to understand how it would be
  possible for an expert to go back to a lost Hebrew original from two extant
  parallel Greek translations. You see what I mean. A very little knowledge of
  Latin might enable anyone to see, that, in two Greek documents, <i>'oaks'</i>
  and <i>'flintstones,'</i> being parallel, point to a Latin <i>'ilices'</i> or
  <i>'silices'</i>&mdash;the reading being doubtful&mdash;from which two Greeks
  have been translating.</p>

  <p>"Now I must pass to the last year or last but one of Domitian. You have
  heard your father speak of Flavius Clemens (not exactly a strong man, but a
  good one) who was put to death by his uncle, the Emperor, for 'Judaism' (so
  it was called) and his poor wife exiled. 'Judaism,' with our people, was only
  a more respectable name for 'Christianism,' though the two superstitions are
  poles asunder. Poor Domitilla was a downright Christian. Her husband Clemens
  was at all events Christian enough for Domitian's purposes. He was put to
  death and his eflfects confiscated. I bought a few of his books as memorials
  of my old friend, and among these were certain Christian publications called
  'gospels/</p>

  <p>"Every Christian missionary is supposed to 'preach the gospel'; so, of
  course, there might be, theoretically, as many gospels as missionaries, and
  'a gospel according to' each missionary, if each chose to write down what he
  preached. Accordingly I gather from Flaccus that there have been a great
  number of these 'gospels '; but only three are now in large demand among
  Christians in Rome&mdash;the three he sent you. The earliest of these is 'The
  Gospel according to Mark.' That it is the earliest you can see thus. Put them
  (that is, of course, the parallel parts of them) in three columns, Mark in
  the middle. Then imagine three schoolboys seated together&mdash;Sinister,
  Medius, and Dexter&mdash;writing a translation of Homer. Suppose Sinister and
  Dexter to be cribbing from Medius, who sits between them. The experienced
  schoolmaster will speedily discover that, whenever Sinister and Dexter
  closely agree, it is because they cribbed from Medius. Similarly Matthew and
  Luke largely copied&mdash;not 'cribbed,' for they did it honestly enough, no
  doubt&mdash;from Mark. Consequently (subject to certain exceptions, which I
  will state later on) Matthew and Luke <i>never agree together&mdash;in those
  parts of the gospel where there are three parallel narratives&mdash;without
  also agreeing with Mark.</i> Don't trust me for this. Try it yourself."</p>

  <p>I did try it. And I found that&mdash;subject to the exceptions defined by
  Scaurus in another letter&mdash;his statement was correct. His letter
  continued, "So I began with Mark. Do not suppose that I began with any
  prejudice against him. On the contrary, your old friend, whom you are so fond
  of calling Misomythus, must plead guilty, I fear, to a latent desire of the
  philomythian kind&mdash;that Mark might contain truth and not myth. But
  hereby hangs another tale, and I must begin another confession.</p>

  <p>"Among Domitilla's slaves was one especially dear to her, her librarian,
  whom she would (no doubt) have manumitted if she had anticipated the blow
  that was soon to fall on her husband and his household. He was an old man, of
  Alexandrian extraction, and of some education, simple-minded as a child,
  perfectly honest, giving an impression of firmness, gentleness, and dignity,
  quite unusual in a slave. I liked old Hermas&mdash;that was his name, you
  must have seen him, I think, in your childhood&mdash;for his own sake, as
  well as for his love of literature. When I bought the books I bought him at
  the same time. He was nearly seventy and ailing. The calamities of his
  mistress helped him to his grave, and he died a few days after he had come to
  my household. We had very little talk together, and least of all at our last
  meeting; but what we had then, I never forgot. It happened thus. One
  afternoon, when he came into the library a little later than
  usual&mdash;slowly, and painfully, and leaning on his staff&mdash;I happened
  to have Domitilla's three gospels rolled out on the table before me. There
  were some notes in the margin of Matthew. These were in his neat small
  handwriting and I was looking at them. 'Not Domitilla's hand, I think,' said
  I, with a smile. He shook his head, opened his lips as if to speak, looked
  long and wistfully at me, as if he would greatly have liked to talk about
  something more than mere librarian's business. But all he said was, 'Will my
  lord give his instructions for the day's work?' I gave them. They were that
  he should go to bed and keep there till he was fit for business. He bowed,
  moved slowly toward the door, turned and looked at me a second time with that
  same expression, only more intense; then left the room without a word. I felt
  strangely drawn towards the old man, and had almost called him back. But I
  did not. 'To-morrow,' I said, 'to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>"Unexpected business took me from Tusculum late in that afternoon and kept
  me away for three days. On my return I was told that Hermas was no more. He
  had earnestly desired to see me, they said; and when he found that I had left
  Tusculum, and that my return might be delayed, and that his voice was
  failing, and death perhaps imminent, he had spent his last strength in
  writing a letter, which, by his request, was to be left by his side until he
  was carried to the funeral pyre&mdash;in case I might come to take it. I went
  at once to his bedside and read it there. I keep it still. But I will not
  transcribe it for anyone, not even for you, Silanus. It is a confidence
  between me and old Hermas, a private confession of a dream of his. A dream
  fulfilled and to be fulfilled, he says. All a dream, I say. Who shall decide?
  Though I will not give you the words, you shall have the substance of his
  letter.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, if I might believe this letter, he, old Hermas, lying dead on
  the couch before my eyes, was not really dead, but only on the way to a
  beautiful city of justice and truth, to which all the just, honourable, and
  truthful might attain, Roman, Greek, Jew, Scythian, rich and poor, bond and
  free, high-born and low-born. No franchise was needed except a patient and
  laborious pursuit of virtue. In this city no one citizen was greater than
  another. If anyone could be called greatest, it was the one that made of
  least account his own pleasures, his own wealth, fame, and reputation,
  serving the state and his fellow-citizens in all things. Yet it was not a
  republic, for it had a king. But this king was not a despot like the kings of
  the east, abhorred by Greeks and Romans. The kingdom was a family at unity
  with itself, the citizens being closely bound by affection to their king as
  father and to their fellow-citizens as brethren. 'And if,' said Hermas, 'you
  desire to be drawn towards that king and to become one with all the
  fellow-citizens of the City of Truth, I beseech you, my dear lord and
  benefactor&mdash;being, as you are, a lover of truth&mdash;to study with all
  patience those books of my dearest mistress Domitilla, which I saw before you
  on that day on which you spoke to me your words&mdash;your last words to me,
  so God wills it&mdash;words of kindness following deeds of kindness, for
  which may the Father in heaven be kind to you for ever and ever.'</p>

  <p>"A postscript added a further request, that I would search for other
  papyri, which contained the epistles of Paul, and which, he said, belonged to
  Domitilla's library, though he had been unable to find them. 'These,' he
  said, 'give a clue to the meaning of many things that are obscure in the
  gospels; for in the gospels traditions derived from different documents or
  witnesses, are sometimes set down without uniform arrangement, and without
  proportion; so that, in Mark, a whole column of forty lines might be given,
  for example, to the exorcism of some evil spirit, and only three or four
  lines to some principal and fundamental saying of Christ. But Paul, though he
  was neither an eye-witness nor an ear-witness, understood spiritual things,
  according to his saying, <i>We have the mind of Christ'</i>.</p>

  <p>"This was written on the day before his death. Another postscript, added
  on the following day, contained nothing but a hope or prayer that he might
  meet me in the City of Truth. I should add that I searched at the time in
  vain for Domitilla's copy of Paul's letters. It was not till three years
  afterwards that I read them, having procured a copy from another source.
  Sometimes I regret this and ask myself whether Hermas might have been right
  in thinking that Paul would have led me to understand the gospels better. But
  I cannot think that the Gods have decreed that those alone shall find the way
  to the City of Truth who may happen to have studied four Christian papyri in
  a particular order. Now I must pass from all this prattle about regrets,
  hopes, prayers, and preconceptions, to describe my exploration of the gospels
  and my search for historical fact."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">XX. &mdash; SCAURUS ON FORGIVENESS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AT this point Scaurus had drawn two lines, thus:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1401411h-images/Silanus-Lines.gif">
  </div><br>
  <br>

  <p>Then the letter continued, "These two lines, my dear Silanus, represent
  two portions of Mark's <i>'gospel'</i>&mdash;which word you know, I presume,
  that the Christians use, as the Greeks do, to mean <i>'good news,'</i> Well,
  the short thin line represents the portion given by Mark to the moral
  precepts or sayings of Christ. The long thick line represents the portion
  given to framework&mdash;for example, to describing a certain John, called
  the Baptist, who, so to speak, introduces Christ to the people; to casting
  out devils; to healing specified diseases, fever, leprosy, paralysis,
  blindness, deafness, dumbness, lameness; to the raising up of a child
  apparently dead; to the destruction of a herd of swine by suffering devils to
  enter into them; to walking on water; to calming a tempest; to a feeding (or
  rather two feedings) of thousands of men with a few loaves and fishes; to
  blasting a fig-tree (but that comes later on); to the character of Herod the
  tetrarch, and his birth-day feasting, ending in the beheading of the
  above-mentioned John; to the finding of an ass by the disciples in exact
  accordance with Christ's predictions and precepts; lastly, to very minute
  details of Christ's trial and crucifixion. There are also a few fables,
  called parables, likening the good news, or gospel, to seed, which will not
  grow if sown in wrong places but will grow without man's interference if sown
  rightly.</p>

  <p>But, all this while, about the good news itself, and about its nature, and
  about the persons to whom the good news is to be brought, and about the good
  that it will do people&mdash;hardly one word! Do not take my word for this.
  Take your own copy of Mark and look at the first words of Jesus, 'Repent and
  believe the gospel.' But what gospel? Jesus has not mentioned the word
  before. This is a specimen of the whole work. It is not a gospel at all. It
  leaves out essential things. It is only the frame of a gospel."</p>

  <p>I did not see at first how to answer this. But on looking into the matter
  it seemed to me that Scaurus had not noticed Mark's first words, "The
  beginning of the <i>gospel of Jesus Christ as it is written in Isaiah the
  prophet.</i>" Moreover Christ's first words were not "Repent," but <i>"The
  time is fulfilled,</i> and the kingdom of God hath drawn near. Repent and
  believe in the gospel." Now the first mention of "preaching the gospel" in
  Isaiah is in a passage that begins thus: "Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people,
  saith God...because <i>her humiliation is fulfilled, her sin is loosed...The
  voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
  Lord</i>...and the glory of the Lord shall appear and all flesh shall see
  <i>the salvation of God</i>..."; and soon afterwards come the words, "Unto a
  high mountain get thee up, O thou <i>that preachest the gospel</i> to Sion."
  A marginal note in my Isaiah said that&mdash;instead of <i>"her humiliation
  is fulfilled"</i>&mdash;the right translation was <i>"her time of service is
  fulfilled,"</i> which resembled Mark, <i>"The time is
  fulfilled"</i>&mdash;words omitted by Matthew and Luke.</p>

  <p>Reviewing Mark and Isaiah together, I came to the conclusion that Mark
  took for granted that his readers would refer to the passage in Isaiah, and
  that he meant, in effect, this: "<i>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus
  Christ was the fulfilment of Isaiah's gospel</i> (namely, 'Comfort ye my
  people because <i>the time is fulfilled and her sin is loosed</i>')." John
  the Baptist, according to Mark, fulfilled <i>Isaiah's prophecy</i>. He was
  the voice crying in the wilderness, "Prepare the way," namely, for this
  gospel of the salvation of God. Then came Jesus saying, in the words <i>of
  Isaiah</i>, "'The time is fulfilled' that is, <i>for the gospel of the
  'loosing of sins'</i>; believe in this gospel." Looked at in this way, Mark,
  though brief and obscure, did not seem to me to have <i>"left out"</i> what
  was (as Scaurus said) "essential," but to have referred his readers to Isaiah
  for what was essential, if they were not already familiar with the passage,
  so that they might understand the meaning to be, "<i>Believe in the gospel of
  the loosing</i>, or <i>forgiveness, of sins, predicted by Isaiah, and
  fulfilled now.</i>"</p>

  <p>Scaurus's next objection was this: "Soon after telling us that Jesus
  called four men away fix)m being fishers of fish to be 'fishers of men'
  &mdash;without explaining the nature or object of this 'fishing,' Mark says,
  'Men were amazed at his teaching. For his way of teaching was that of one
  having authority and not as the way of the scribes.' But what kind of
  '<i>authority</i>'? Listen to the rabble, how they define it (a few lines
  lower down). 'What is this? A novel teaching! With <i>authority</i> does he
  dictate even to the unclean spirits and they obey him.' Now Flavius Josephus
  has told me that he himself has known a conjurer or exorcist cast out an
  unclean spirit or demon&mdash;in the presence of Vespasian and his
  offIcers&mdash;and make it knock over a bucket of water in its exit: but he
  never told me&mdash;and you may be sure he would never have
  supposed&mdash;that the conjurer, on the strength of his exorcisms, would
  claim to preach a gospel!"</p>

  <p>This struck me at first as a very forcible objection. And I was not
  surprised that Matthew omitted the whole of this narrative; for it is liable
  to be misunderstood. But I found on examination that Jesus did not (as
  Scaurus said) "claim to preach a gospel" on the strength of such exorcisms.
  On the contrary, Mark and Luke say soon afterwards, that Jesus "would not
  allow the demons to speak because they knew him." Moreover I found that the
  man from whom the demon was said to have been expelled cried out that Jesus
  was "the Holy One of God." So it appeared possible that Jesus&mdash;if he
  possessed, like Apollo or Aesculapius, some divine power of
  healing&mdash;might heal lunatics or possessed persons among others, and yet
  might not claim, on the strength of such exorcisms alone, to preach a gospel.
  From what I had read in Paul's epistles, and also from my recent reading of
  Isaiah's prediction of the "gospel," it seemed to me more likely that Jesus
  would connect his gospel&mdash;though what the connexion would be I did not
  yet see&mdash;with the forgiveness of sins.</p>

  <p>And this indeed I found to be the subject of Scaurus's next objection;
  "Then Jesus says that he will cure a man of paralysis in order that the
  spectators 'may know that the Son of man hath authority on earth to forgive
  sins.' Now this is the first mention of 'the Son of man.' Who, or of what
  nature, is this Son of man? There is no answer."</p>

  <p>Scaurus spoke thus, perhaps, because he had in his mind some passages in
  the Jewish scriptures where a "son of man" is described as coming on the
  clouds to judge mankind, and others where a "son of man " means "son of a
  mere mortal." He may have thought that Mark ought to have explained which of
  the two was meant.</p>

  <p>But Paul's epistles had shown me that, when he regarded Christ as having
  authority over all things, he, Paul, was in the habit of quoting one of the
  most beautiful of David's Psalms, which said, "What is man that thou art
  mindful of him, and the son of man that thou visitest him? For thou hast made
  him but little lower than the angels." Now here my MS. said, in the margin of
  the Psalm&mdash;as I quoted it above&mdash;<i>"but little lower than
  God."</i> Then David continued, "Thou hast <i>subjected all things under his
  feet.</i>" These words "subjecting all things" are frequently applied by Paul
  to the reign or lordship of Christ over mankind. And "to subject" was
  precisely the word used by Epictetus concerning the ideal ruler, when he
  taught us that Socrates had the power "so to frame his hearers" that they
  would "subject" their wills to his. It seemed to me, then, that if Scaurus
  had said to Mark "Why did you not explain which son of man Jesus meant?" Mark
  might have replied, "<i>Because the Lord Jesus did not recognise two 'sons of
  men.'</i> He taught us that the son of man on earth is intended by God to be
  the son of man in heaven, and that the son of man, even on earth, is superior
  to the moon and the stars, having 'authority over all things'."</p>

  <p>Afterwards I found that Jesus (in Matthew) quotes elsewhere part of
  another passage in this same psalm of David, namely, "Out of the mouth of
  babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, because of thine
  adversaries, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger." Paul taught
  that the "adversaries" of the Lord are the angels of Satan, and the "enemy"
  is the devil, and these are like wild beasts seeking to devour the soul of
  man. David, therefore, might be interpreted spiritually as meaning that God
  has given "authority" to the Son of man, not only over the visible "beasts of
  the field" but also over the invisible "beasts" that attack the heart of man.
  "Over these "&mdash;Paul might say&mdash;"hath the Son of man received
  authority that he may still the enemy and avenger," that is to say, that he
  may put Satan to silence by delivering man from the bondage of sin. Some
  thought of this kind occurred to me at the time. And I was confirmed in it
  afterwards when I found in the gospels elsewhere mention of "authority" to
  "trample on, or rule over," wild "beasts" of various kinds. The facts seemed
  to show that Jesus often meditated on this beautiful poem of David and on the
  power given by God to "the Son of man" and to "babes and sucklings"&mdash;to
  whom Jesus appears often to refer under the title of "the little ones."</p>

  <p>These considerations to some extent met Scaurus's next objection: "Now as
  to <i>authority to forgive sins</i>&mdash;what is meant by this? I can
  forgive you a <i>debt</i> of a thousand sesterces. But I cannot forgive you a
  <i>theft</i> of a thousand sesterces&mdash;except in the language of the
  people. Whether you stole them from me or from somebody else, that makes no
  difference. You remain a thief&mdash;a past thief of course&mdash;till the
  end of your days. Jupiter himself, as Horace in effect declares, cannot
  unthieve you."</p>

  <p>This caused me a great deal of thought. It was logical, yet I felt it was
  not true. It seemed to me, for example, that if two sons had stolen money
  from two several fathers, one father might so deal with the child that he
  might feel himself forgiven, even though he had to pay the money back again;
  while another father, though not exacting the money, might make the boy feel
  that he was not forgiven, and that he would be a thief all his life long.
  Even Epictetus, I remembered, said about Diogenes, "He goes about like a
  physician feeling the pulses of his patients, and saying, 'You have a fever;
  you, a headache; you, the gout. You must fast; you must eat; you must not
  bathe; you must have the knife; you must have cautery.'" He was talking of
  mental or spiritual diseases. Well, to be slavishly afraid of God&mdash;was
  not this a disease? And to one thus diseased, might not a healing Son of God
  come with a message from the Father, "He loves you, though He may punish. He
  will punish as a Father that loves. Steal no more; He will not treat you as a
  thief. Sin no more; He will not treat you as a sinner."</p>

  <p>Epictetus once declared that Diogenes had been sent before us as a
  reconnoitrer into the regions of death and had brought back his report,
  "There is nothing terrible there." I never could quite understand on what
  grounds our Teacher based this assertion, unless it was because the Cynic
  himself had absolutely no fear of death. It was more easy for me to under-
  stand&mdash;I do not say, to prove, but to understand&mdash;that a great
  prophet might bring a similar report from the Father of men, "I come from the
  House of God to tell you that there is nothing terrible there&mdash;except
  for the cruel and base. There is nothing but kindness and justice and true
  fatherhood." About the alleged "report" of Diogenes, I had felt that&mdash;if
  I believed it&mdash;it would deliver me from bondage to the fear of death.
  Similarly I felt, about the message or gospel of this Jewish prophet,
  that&mdash;if I believed it&mdash;it might raise me above fears into a region
  of love and trust and loyalty to the righteous Father. This was only theory.
  I did not believe it. But I felt the possibility of believing and of being
  strengthened by the belief</p>

  <p>Scaurus next objected to the words, "I came not to call the righteous but
  sinners." This was in Mark and Matthew. "Luke," he said, "adds 'to
  repentance'; and that of course is meant. Now it is quite right that
  'sinners' should be 'called' to 'repentance.' But is that 'good news'? Is
  that 'gospel'? And, if it is, what about 'the righteous'? They, it seems, are
  not 'called.' There is no 'gospel' for them!"</p>

  <p>Here Scaurus seemed on strong ground. And I felt that he might urge
  against Mark what Epictetus says about Diogenes, namely, that the ideal
  physician inspects others, besides those who are manifestly diseased, in
  order to see who are healthy and who are not. But then I asked myself, "Who
  are 'the righteous '?" And the answer Paul put into my mouth was, "None are
  righteous except through faith in God's Son." That is to say, " None are
  righteous save through the Spirit of Sonship. None are righteous through the
  Law." Moreover, on examining the context, I found that the words "I came not
  to call the righteous" were uttered to unrighteous, envious people, the
  Pharisees, who grudged forgiveness of sins to the sinners. Elsewhere Luke
  described the Pharisees as "counting themselves to be righteous and despising
  others." That is, they were "righteous" in their own estimation. In reality,
  then, Jesus regarded all men as in need of health, that is to say, in need of
  righteousness. Also, what Jesus called "repenting" was what the prophets call
  "turning to Jehovah." So the message of the gospel was, "Turn ye to the Lord
  and He will forgive you and will grant health to your souls." This was
  addressed to all that needed better health, that is, to all the nation. But
  some made themselves blind to their own sinful acts and deaf to the sinful
  utterances of their own hearts. These could not hear the gospel. The "call"
  of the gospel did not come into their ears. But it was not the gospels fault
  but theirs.</p>

  <p>The more I thought over Scaurus's trenchant criticism, the stronger grew
  my suspicion that Romans and Greeks might be inferior to the best of the Jews
  in the knowledge of the depths of human nature. I knew from Paul's epistles
  that the apostle recognised a certain mysterious power of forgiving sins and
  infirmities by bearing them. This Paul called "the law of Christ," saying,
  "Bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfil the law of Christ," and again,
  "If anyone be overtaken in a fault, do ye, who are spiritual, restore such a
  one in a spirit of meekness." This word, "restore," came into my mind when
  Scaurus said, "Once a thief, always a thief." It seemed to me truer to say
  that a father might "restore" his child, after the theft, so that he might be
  honest for the rest of his life. This power of "restoring" was (as indeed it
  still is) a great mystery to me. But it is a mysterious fact, not a mere
  imagination.</p>

  <p>Also Scaurus himself said, "It is very likely that many of the poorer Jews
  were called 'sinners' by the Pharisees for breaking small and perhaps
  disputed rules about purification or about the exact observance of the
  sabbath. This my rabbi admitted, although he did not care to say much about
  it. I can understand that Christ might deal epigrammatically (so to speak)
  with poor creatures of this kind by pronouncing them 'forgiven' or
  'righteous.' But they would be just as 'righteous' as before; neither more
  righteous nor less righteous; his 'pronouncing' would make no difference. The
  Jews closely connect 'pronouncing righteous' and 'making righteous,' as
  though the sentence of the judge is anything more than the expression of the
  judge's opinion! But it is a pure delusion."</p>

  <p>I did not think Scaurus was right. It did not seem to me that the voice of
  the true Son of man, saying, "I pronounce you righteous in the name of the
  Father of men," would be of the same kind or efficacy as the voice of a
  lawyer, saying, "Having in view sect. 3 of chap. 4 of such and such a Code, I
  pronounce you not guilty." I had come to feel that the Son of man represented
  the "authority" of humanity&mdash;divine humanity, such humanity as commends
  itself (without support from statute law) to the consciences of mankind. The
  Pharisees (I thought) might have <i>made</i> some of these poor men really
  <i>unrighteous</i> by making them frightened of God&mdash;as though He were
  an austere lawgiver or hard taskmaster. The Son, delivering them from this
  servile terror, and raising them into a wholesome fear, that is to say, into
  a free and loving reverence for a righteous God, might bring the Spirit of
  the Father into their hearts, thus <i>making</i> them <i>righteous</i>. If
  so, Christ's voice, saying "I forgive you," would not be a mere judge's
  "sentence," or expression of "opinion." It would be a power, causing the
  guilty to feel, and to be, forgiven.</p>

  <p>Scaurus then said, "Now pass on, and you will find nothing worth
  mentioning except a wilderness of wonders and portents until the twelve
  apostles are sent out to 'preach the gospel.' And now, say you, Jesus must
  surely tell his missionaries what this 'gospel' is. But no. Not a word about
  it. Mark himself says, 'They preached that men should repent.' Wholesome
  tidings, no doubt, but hardly <i>good</i> tidings!" Here, as before, Scaurus
  (as it seems to me) had failed to see that Jews would understand Mark's
  meaning to be "They preached that men should turn to God and receive
  forgiveness "&mdash;which would be "good tidings." Moreover he had omitted
  Christ's doctrine that "the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath," to which
  Mark alone (I found) prefixed "The sabbath was made for man and not man for
  the sabbath." According to this doctrine God seemed to say to men, "Priests,
  temples, sacrifices, fasts, sabbaths, rites and ceremonies, psalms, hymns,
  and prayers&mdash;all these I have given you for your own sake, to draw you
  nearer to me." This, in a way, was like the doctrine of Epictetus, that each
  man must take an oath to himself to think of his own interest. But in another
  way it was different. For Matthew added, "I desire kindness, not sacrifice."
  That went to the root of the difference between Epictetus and Christ. The
  former said, "Think of your own virtue"; the latter, "Think how your
  neighbour needs your kindness." According to the gospel, the rule of God was,
  "Draw near to me." Then, in answer to men's question, "How draw near?" the
  reply was, "Draw near to one another. That is the best way. Drawing near to
  me by sabbaths or sacrifices is a second best way. The second best must not
  interfere with the first best."</p>

  <p>It appeared to me that Scaurus dealt with Mark more severely than he would
  have dealt with Plato. Plato regards "justice," not as obedience to the
  written laws, but as "doing that which is best for all." If therefore
  retribution of good and evil comes on the well-doer and on the evildoer,
  severally, as being "the best thing" for each and for all, this is "justice."
  But Scaurus quoted Mark, "In the moment when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye
  have any charge against anyone, that your Father also in heaven may forgive
  you your trespasses," and then said, "This is not just. If I forgive my slave
  for robbing me or for cruelly maiming one of his fellow-slaves, does it
  follow that Jupiter should forgive me for theft or murder? Not in the least.
  He ought to punish me twice over, first, for unjustly forgiving crime, and
  then for being a criminal myself." Here Scaurus was thinking of remitting
  penalty, whereas Mark meant bearing the burden of sin. And, although the
  matter was not then as clear to me as it is now, I could see how a man
  wronged, and prosecuting the wrong-doer, not as offending against society and
  justice but as offending against himself&mdash;a man that does not wish to
  "do the best thing" for offenders and for the community&mdash;creates for
  himself an image of a God bad and selfish and unforgiving like himself; so
  that either he trembles before his bad God and is a slave; or else he regards
  himself as the favourite of a bad God, and becomes confirmed in his own
  badness.</p>

  <p>On the whole, though I was forced to admit the justice of many charges
  that Scaurus brought against Mark&mdash;and especially the charge of
  disproportion, and of neglecting great doctrines while emphasizing small
  details of narrative&mdash;still I was satisfied that Mark did contain a
  gospel, namely, the good tidings of the forgiveness of sins. Scaurus called
  Mark's gospel a mere frame. It seemed to me that it would have been less
  untrue to call it a picture in which the principal figure was not clearly
  seen because of intervening objects and inferior figures. Or it might be
  called a drama in which the leading character is too often absent from the
  stage; or, when present, he speaks too little, while minor characters are
  allowed to speak too much.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">XXI. &mdash; SCAURUS ON THE CROSS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SCAURUS continued, "I pass over a good many columns in Mark
  before I come to anything of the nature of a precept. Then I find the
  following, 'There is nothing outside the man, entering into him, that can
  defile him.' Now you might suppose that this would have been good news,
  addressed as it is, to the needy multitude. For it would have enabled them
  (you may say) to eat pork like their Greek neighbours and would have saved
  them trouble and expense in preparing food.</p>

  <p>"But look at the context. Jesus is upholding the written law of Moses
  against the teachers of unwritten traditions. These teachers told people that
  if a particle of this or that came off their hands into their mouths while
  they were eating, they were defiled. These traditions also prescribed minute
  regulations about preparing meat, and about avoiding meat sold in the markets
  of Greek cities. Look at Paul's Corinthian letters about this. These
  regulations must have been very inconvenient for the poor Jews in the Greek
  cities of Galilee. Jesus stood up for the poor, and for the written law,
  which said nothing about such details. Long after the crucifixion, Peter was
  told by 'the Lord' in a vision (you will find it in the Acts) that he might
  eat anything he liked, pork included. But Jesus said nothing of the kind
  before his death. Turn to the Acts and you will find it as I have said."</p>

  <p>I turned, and found, as usual, that Scaurus was right, though there was no
  special mention of pork in the Acts, but only of "beasts and creeping
  things," which Peter calls "unclean." Scaurus continued, "Now look carefully
  at what follows in Mark and Matthew. Mark represents the disciples&mdash;but
  Matthew represents Peter&mdash;as questioning Christ privately about this
  startling saying. The questioners are said to have called it a 'parable.'
  There was no 'parable' about it at all. But the fact was that, <i>after the
  resurrection, it was revealed to Peter, or to the disciples</i>, that the
  meaning of the saying 'Nothing outside defileth' went far beyond its original
  scope; so that it swept away the whole of the Levitical ordinances about
  things 'unclean.' If you examine Mark's words carefully you will see that he
  inserts a comment of his own (which Matthew omits) namely that Jesus uttered
  these words <i>'purifying all kinds of food.'</i> If by 'purifying,' Mark
  meant 'purifying <i>in effect</i>,' or 'purifying, <i>as the disciples
  subsequently understood</i>,' then he was right. If he meant 'purifying <i>at
  once</i>,' or '<i>purifying in such a way as to abrogate immediately the
  Levitical prohibitions</i>,' then he was wrong; for that was not the
  meaning.</p>

  <p>"What indeed do you suppose would have happened, if Jesus and his
  disciples had sat down to a dinner of pork on that same day? They would have
  been stoned by the multitude. The meaning was limited as I have said above.
  Mark has probably mixed together what occurred before, and what occurred
  after, the crucifixion. It was very natural. How many of the 'dark sayings'
  or 'parables' of Jesus might remain 'dark' to the disciples, till they
  reflected on them after his death! Moreover the evangelists believed that
  Jesus, after his death, rose again and appeared on several occasions to the
  disciples, apart from the rest of the world&mdash;that is, 'in private
  '&mdash;and that he explained to them after death what had been dark sayings
  during his life. How inevitable for biographers&mdash;writing thirty, forty,
  or fifty years after the events they narrated&mdash;sometimes to confuse
  explanations, or other words of Christ, uttered 'in private' after death,
  with those uttered before death, whether in private or not! I shall have to
  mention other instances of such confusion. It is not surprising that Luke
  omits the narrative."</p>

  <p>I could not deny the force of this. But, though it derogated from Mark as
  a witness, it did not seem to me to derogate from Christ as a prophet. I felt
  that no wise teacher could have desired, thus by a side-blow, to sweep away
  the whole of the national code of purifications. So I was ready to accept
  Scaurus's view, at all events provisionally.</p>

  <p>"I pass over," said Scaurus, "the precept, 'Beware of leaven,' which was
  certainly metaphorical; and two narratives of feeding multitudes with
  'loaves,' which in my opinion are metaphorical; and a mention of 'crumbs,'
  which my reason leads me to interpret in one way, while my desire suggests
  another. About this I shall say something later on, as also about predictions
  of being killed and rising again. Now I reach these words, 'If anyone wishes
  to come after me, let him disown himself, and <i>take up his cross and follow
  me</i>. For whosoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever
  will lose his life for the sake of me and the gospel shall save it.' Note
  that these words are preceded by a prediction that the Son of man must be
  'killed.' Also remember that the 'cross' is a punishment sanctioned by Roman
  but not by Jewish law. Bearing these facts in mind, imagine yourself in the
  crowd, and tell me what you would think Christ meant, if he turned round to
  you and said, 'You must take up your cross.' Do not read on to see what I
  think; for I doubt whether Christ used these words. But, if he did use them,
  tell me what you think he meant by them."</p>

  <p>I was taken aback by this. For I perceived that the sense required a
  metaphorical rendering, and, at the same time, that such a metaphor was
  almost impossible among any Jews, <i>before Christ's crucifixion</i>. At
  first I tried to justify it from Paul's epistles, which declared that, in
  Christ's death, <i>"all died"</i>&mdash;meaning that all, by sympathy, died
  to sin and rose again to righteousness. Paul said also "I have been crucified
  with Christ," and "our old man"&mdash;meaning "our old human nature"&mdash;
  "has been crucified with Him," and "the world has been crucified to me and I
  to the world." But these expressions were all based on the Christian belief
  that the "cross" was the way to "resurrection." They were quite intelligible
  after the resurrection, but not before it.</p>

  <p>Then I tried to imagine myself in the circle of disciples surrounding
  Socrates in prison, and the Master, with the bowl of poison in his hands,
  preparing to drink it, and looking up to us and saying, "If you intend to be
  disciples worthy of me, you too must be prepared to take up the hemlock
  bowl." What, I asked, should I have understood by this? It seemed to me that
  the words could only mean "You, too, must be prepared to be put to death by
  your countrymen."</p>

  <p>Now as the hemlock bowl was the regular penalty among the Athenians, so
  the cross (as Scaurus had said) was the regular penalty among the Romans
  <i>but not among the Jews</i>. So, when I tried honestly to respond to
  Scaurus's appeal, and to imagine myself in the crowd following Jesus, and the
  Master turning round to us, and saying, "Take up your cross," I was obliged
  to admit, "I should have taken the Master to mean, 'If you are to be worthy
  followers of mine, you must be prepared <i>to be put to death as rebels by
  the Romans</i>'."</p>

  <p>Scaurus took the same view. "Well," he continued, "I will anticipate your
  answer, for it seems to me you can only come to one conclusion. You, in the
  crowd, would take the words to mean that you must follow your Master to the
  death against the Romans. But all intelligent readers of the Christian books
  ought to know that he could not have said that. He was a visionary, and
  utterly averse to violence, so averse that he was on one occasion reproached
  for his inaction by John the Baptist&mdash;who once said to him, in effect,
  'Why do you leave me in prison? Why do you not stir a hand to release me?
  'Moreover, if Jesus had said this, what would the chief priests have needed
  more than this, to get Pilate to put him to death: 'This man said to the
  rabble. If you are intending to follow me, you must go with the cross on your
  shoulders'? 'Can you prove this? ' would have been Pilate's reply. They would
  have proved it. Then sentence would have followed at once as a matter of
  course. And who can deny that it would have been just?"</p>

  <p>I certainly could not deny it. Then Scaurus pointed out to me how Luke
  avoided this dangerous interpretation, by inserting "daily," so as to give
  the words a metaphorical twist, "Let him take up his cross <i>daily.</i>" But
  this, he said, was manifestly an addition of Luke's. If Jesus had inserted
  "daily" why should Mark and Matthew have omitted it? "Daily" would make no
  sense till a generation had passed away, so that "to be crucified with
  Christ" had become a metaphorical expression for mortifying the flesh. On
  this point, at all events, Scaurus seemed to me to be right.</p>

  <p>He continued as follows, "I am disposed to think that Mark has
  misunderstood a Jewish phrase as referring to the cross when it really
  referred to something else. You know that, in Rome, a rascally slave,
  regarded as being on the way to crucifixion, is called '<i>yoke-bearer</i>,'
  which means practically '<i>cross-bearer</i>,' Mark, who has a good many
  Latinisms, might regard <i>'take the yoke' as meaning 'take the
  cross'&mdash;if the former expression could be proved to have been used by
  Jesus.</i> Still more easily might <i>'take the yoke'</i> be regarded as
  equivalent to <i>'take the cross' if it could be proved that the Jews
  themselves connected 'taking the yoke' with martyrdom.</i></p>

  <p>"Both these facts can be proved. In the first place, Christ actually said
  to the disciples, '<i>Take my yoke</i> upon you.' It is true that this saying
  is preserved by Matthew alone; but its omission by others is easily
  explained, as I will presently show. In my judgment, it is certain that
  Christ did give this precept, and that it had nothing to do with crucifixion.
  The context in Matthew declares that the kingdom of heaven is revealed only
  to 'babes'&mdash;whom Christ elsewhere calls 'little ones' or those who make
  themselves 'least' in the kingdom of God&mdash;and soon afterwards come the
  words, '<i>Take my yoke upon you</i> and learn from me, for I am meek and
  lowly in heart.' This is the fundamental truth of Christ's teaching, that
  those who make themselves the humblest of servants to one another are
  greatest in his 'kingdom.' In order to reign, one must serve, or <i>'take the
  yoke.'</i></p>

  <p>"The next fact is that Jews of the present day&mdash;so I am credibly
  informed&mdash;would say of a Jewish martyr that he 'took the yoke upon
  himself,' when he made a formal profession of obedience to the Law just
  before death. This I must ask you to take for granted. It would be too long
  to prove and explain." I suppose Scaurus heard this from the teacher he
  called "his rabbi." It was confirmed, to my own knowledge, by something that
  happened nearly thirty years ago when one of the most famous Jewish teachers,
  Akiba by name, was put to death under Hadrian. I heard it said by a credible
  eye-witness that "they combed his flesh with combs of iron," and another
  added "Yes, and Akiba, all the while, kept <i>taking upon himself the yoke of
  the Kingdom of Heaven</i>," by which he meant repeating the profession of
  faith.</p>

  <p>"A third fact," said Scaurus, "is that the Christians, from a very early
  period, used the word <i>'yoke'</i> in a depreciatory sense to mean the
  'bondage'&mdash;as they called it&mdash;of the Law of Moses. Paul calls the
  latter <i>'the yoke of bondage.'</i> The Christians, at their first public
  council, speak of it as <i>'a yoke'</i>; and a Christian writer named
  Barnabas says that 'the new law' is <i>'without the yoke of necessity.'</i> I
  suspect that among the Greeks and Romans the servile associations of 'yoke'
  have also tended to the disuse of the term among the Christians of the west.
  You may object that the associations of 'cross' are still more disgraceful
  than those of 'yoke.' But I do not think they would be so for Christians, who
  regarded the disgrace of the cross as a step upward to what they call 'the
  crown of life.' Indeed I am rather surprised that Matthew's tradition 'Take
  my yoke upon you' has been retained at all, even by a single evangelist."</p>

  <p>Most of this was new to me. But, even if it was true&mdash;as seemed to me
  not unlikely&mdash;the same conclusion followed as above. The mistake
  derogated from Mark, not from Christ. Indeed Scaurus's interpretation seemed
  to me to exalt Christ. For might not some people, of austere and fanatical
  minds, find it easier to <i>"take up the cross,"</i> that is, to lacerate and
  torture themselves, than to <i>"take up the yoke,"</i> that is, to make their
  lives subservient to the community in a spirit of willing self-sacrifice?
  Indeed Scaurus himself said, "If I am right, the Christians have lost by this
  misunderstanding. When I say 'lost,' I mean 'lost in respect of morality.'
  For some may <i>'take up the cross'</i> like the priests of Cybele, finding a
  pleasure in gashing themselves&mdash;such is human nature. But it is not so
  exciting a thing to <i>'take up the yoke'</i> if it implies making oneself a
  drudge for life to commonplace people."</p>

  <p>This seemed very true. And afterwards I was not surprised to find that the
  fourth gospel contains no precept to "take up the cross." But it commands
  Christians to "love one another"&mdash;a precept that nowhere occurs in Mark.
  Also what Scaurus said about "making oneself a drudge " was, in effect,
  inculcated by the fourth gospel where it commands the disciples to "wash one
  another's feet." Sometimes I have asked why this gospel did not restore the
  old tradition about "yoke." Perhaps the writer avoided it as he avoids
  "faith," and "repentance," and other technical terms that might come between
  Christians and Christ. Scaurus himself said, "There seems to me more morality
  in the old rule of Moses, 'Love thy neighbour as thyself than in either 'Take
  up the cross' or 'Take up the yoke.' If ever this Christian superstition were
  to overrun the world, I could conceive of a time when half the Christians
  might fight with the war-cry of 'the yoke,' and the other half with the
  war-cry of 'the cross,' cutting one another's throats for these emblems. But
  I could not so easily conceive of a time when men would ever cut one
  another's throats with the war-cry, 'We love one another'."</p>

  <p>These words of Scaurus seemed to me at the time to be quite true. Now,
  forty-five years afterwards, they seem to me true as to fact, but not quite
  true as to interpretation. For, since what Scaurus called "the old rule of
  Moses" included "Love God," as well as "Love thy neighbour," it followed that
  the Lord Jesus, in saying "Take my yoke," meant "Serve God," as well as
  "Serve man." And, in order to serve God, must not one be prepared to suffer,
  as God also is called "longsuffering"? And of such "suffering" can there be
  any better emblem than Christ's cross?</p>

  <p>I cannot honestly deny the force of the evidence adduced by Scaurus to
  prove that the Saviour did not really utter the precept of "taking up the
  cross," and that He did utter the precept of "taking up the yoke." But I can
  honestly accept the former as an interpretation of the latter, an
  interpretation fit for Greeks and Romans when the gospel was first preached,
  and likely to be fit for all the races of the world till the time of the
  coming of the Lord. If Scaurus is right, only the precept of the yoke was
  inculcated by Christ in word. But all agree that the precept of the cross was
  inculcated by Christ in act. Both metaphors seem needed, and many more, to
  help the disciples of the Lord to apprehend the nature of His Kingdom, or
  Family.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">XXII. &mdash; SCAURUS ON MARK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SCAURUS continued as follows: "I now come to a passage where
  Mark represents Christ as saying, 'Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my
  words, the Son of man also shall be ashamed of him.' This suggests to me for
  the first time (re-perusing these strange books after an interval of more
  than twenty years) that I may have been blaming Mark for not doing what, as a
  fact, he had no intention of doing&mdash;I mean, for not giving a collection
  of Christ's utterances in connexion with the 'good news.' If we were to
  question Mark about the expression 'me and my words,' and to say, 'What words
  do you refer to?' perhaps he might reply, 'I do not profess to give Christ's
  words, but only their tenor.' Perhaps Mark has in view a person, or
  character, rather than any gospel of 'words.' And I think I ought to have
  explained that, at the very outset of his work, Mark described a divine Voice
  (a thing frequently mentioned in Jewish traditions of the present day about
  their rabbis) calling from heaven to Christ, 'Thou art my beloved Son.' It is
  this perhaps that Mark may consider a 'gospel,' namely, that God, instead of
  sending prophets to the Jews, as in old days, now sends a Son."</p>

  <p>This did not seem to me a complete statement of the fact. "Gospel," as I
  have said above, seemed to me to have meant, in Mark, the gospel of
  forgiveness of sins promised by Isaiah. And Scaurus himself was justly
  dissatisfied with his own explanation, for he proceeded, "Still, this is not
  satisfactory. For ought not the Son to have a message, as a prophet has?</p>

  <p>Nay, ought not the Son to have a much better message? The Voice from
  heaven is repeated at the stage of the gospel at which we have now arrived.
  But both before and now, it is apparently heard by no unbelievers. Nor does
  Christ himself ever repeat it to unbelievers. He never says, 'I am <i>the Son
  of God</i>,' nor even, 'I am <i>a Son of God</i>.' He simply goes about,
  curing diseases, and saying 'The sabbath is made for man,' and, on one
  occasion, 'Thy sins are forgiven thee,' and, 'The son of man hath authority
  on earth to forgive sins,' and a few more things of this sort. What is there
  in all this that would induce Christ to use such an expression as, 'Whosoever
  shall be ashamed of me and of <i>my words</i>'? I could understand his saying
  'of me,' but not 'of <i>my words</i>,' Surely it would have been better to
  say, 'Whosoever shall be unjust, or an adulterer, or a murderer, I will be
  ashamed of him'."</p>

  <p>Here it seemed to me that Scaurus had not quite succeeded in his attempt
  to do justice to Mark by reconsidering his gospel in the light of the words
  "Thou art my beloved Son." For suppose a Son of God to have come into the
  world, like an Apollo or Aesculapius of souls. Suppose Him to have had a
  power, beyond that of Moses and the prophets, of instilling into their hearts
  a new kind of love of God and a new kind of love of neighbour. Lastly,
  suppose this Son of God to feel quite contented, and indeed best pleased, to
  call Himself Son of man, because He regarded man as the image of God, and
  because He felt, within Himself, God and man made one. Would not such a Son
  of God say, just as Epictetus might say, " Preserve the Man," "Give up
  everything for the Man," "Save the Man within you, destroy the Beast"? Only,
  being a Jew, He would not say "Man," but "Son of man," exhorting His
  disciples to be loyal to "the Son of man" and never to disown or deny "the
  Son of man."</p>

  <p>I was confirmed in this view by a mention (in this part of Mark) of
  "angels" with "the Son of man," thus: "The Son of man also shall be ashamed
  of him when he shall come in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
  This seemed to say that the Son of man although, as David said according to
  one interpretation of the Psalm, <i>"below the angels"</i> on earth, will be
  manifested in the glory of the Father <i>with the attendant angels</i> in
  heaven&mdash;thus reconciling the two aspects of the Son of man described by
  David and Daniel.</p>

  <p>I noticed, however, that Matthew, in this passage, does not say (as Mark
  and Luke do) "the Son of man will be ashamed"; and it occurred to me that,
  where Christ used the phrase "Son of man," and spoke about "the coming of the
  Son of man," different evangelists might render these phrases differently so
  as to make the meaning brief and clear for Greeks. Indeed Scaurus himself
  suggested something of this kind, saying that some might use "I" or "me" for
  "Son of man" (in Christ's words). He also added that "the Son of man" might
  sometimes be paraphrased as "the Rule, or Law, of Humanity"; and, said he,
  "Matthew has a very instructive parable, in which the Son of man in his glory
  and with his angels is introduced as seated on his throne, judging the
  Gentiles at the end of the world. Then those who have been kind and helpful
  and humane are rewarded because&mdash;so says the Son of man&mdash;'Ye have
  been kind to <i>me</i>.' 'When have we been kind to <i>thee</i>?' they reply.
  The Son answers, '<i>Ye have been kind to the least and humblest of my
  brethren.</i> Therefore ye have been kind to me.' This goes to the root of
  Christ's doctrine. The Son of man is humanity and divinity, one with man and
  one with God, humanity divine."</p>

  <p>Scaurus went on to say that Mark's sayings about the Son of man would have
  been, much clearer if some parable or statement of this kind had been
  inserted making it clear that Christ as it were identified himself with the
  empire of the Son of man mentioned by the prophet Daniel, against the empire
  of the Beasts. "There is always a tendency," said Scaurus, "among men of the
  world, and perhaps among statesmen quite as much as among soldiers&mdash;yes,
  and it exists among some philosophers, too, spite of their creeds&mdash;to
  deify force. I own I admire Christ for deifying humanity. But his
  biographers&mdash;Mark, in particular&mdash;do not make the deification
  clear. If I were to lend my copy of Mark to a fairly educated Roman
  gentleman, I really should not be surprised if he were to come to me, after
  reading it right through from beginning to end, and ask me, 'Who <i>is</i>
  this Son of man?'" These words impressed me at the time; but much more
  afterwards when I actually met this very question in the fourth gospel, asked
  by the multitude at the end of Christ's preaching, "Who <i>is</i> this Son of
  man?"</p>

  <p>"After this," said Scaurus (not speaking quite accurately, for he omitted,
  as I will presently show, one short but important saying of Christ) "comes a
  statement that a certain kind of lunacy cannot be cured by the disciples
  unless they fast as well as pray. But here, I am convinced, Mark has made
  some mistake through not understanding 'faith as a grain of mustard-seed,'
  which the parallel Matthew has. That is a very interesting phrase, which I
  must go into another time.</p>

  <p>"Close on this, occurs a prediction, with part of which I will deal later
  on. But about part of it I will say at once that I find it quite
  unintelligible. It is, 'The Son of man is on the point of being betrayed into
  the hands <i>of men</i>,' Why <i>'of men'</i>? Surely he could not be
  betrayed into the hands of anyone else! I observe that Mark and Luke say,
  'They were ignorant of this saying,' and I am not surprised. I presume it is
  simply a repetition of Christ's prediction of his violent death, introduced
  in order to emphasize his foreknowledge of the treachery of one of his own
  disciples. But I do not understand 'of men'."</p>

  <p>As to this, I have shown above that the word rendered by Scaurus
  "betrayed," occurs in Isaiah's description of the Suffering Servant, "He was
  <i>delivered over</i> for our transgressions," and that it is quoted from
  Isaiah by Paul. I had always rendered it "delivered over." And now, too, it
  appeared to me much more likely that the Lord Jesus used the word in that
  sense. If so, it would have no reference to treachery, but would mean
  "delivered over by the Father." This would explain <i>"of men"</i> because it
  would mean that the Father in <i>heaven</i> delivers over His Son "into the
  hands <i>of men</i>" <i>on earth</i>, I have heard that one of the brethren,
  a learned man, explains "of men" as being opposed to "of Satan," but "men"
  seems to me more likely to be in antithesis to "God." I found afterwards that
  in the gospels the word "deliver over" is regularly used about Judas Iscariot
  " delivering over "Jesus to the Jews. So Scaurus may be right. But Paul's
  rendering seems to me to make better sense in Christ's predictions.</p>

  <p>I had been prepared by Paul and by Isaiah to recognise that Christ might
  have had in view the thought that the Son was to be "delivered over" to death
  by the Father for the salvation of men. Scaurus had not been thus prepared.
  Otherwise I think he would have been more patient with obscurities in Mark.
  Mark seemed to me to assume that his readers would know the general drift of
  "the gospel" as Isaiah predicted it, as Christ fulfilled it, and as the
  apostles preached it. Hence he was not so careful as the later evangelists to
  make his meaning clear to those who had no such knowledge. Take, for example,
  the words "If any one desires to be first he shall be last." "This," said
  Scaurus, "might mean 'He shall be degraded so as to be last'." Scaurus also
  attacked the saying that whosoever receives a child in Christ's name receives
  Christ, and, "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little
  child shall surely not enter therein." "I suppose," said he, "this means we
  are to put aside the vices of youth and manhood and to start afresh. But that
  is more easily said than done. And there is nothing in Mark to show how it
  can be done."</p>

  <p>Here Scaurus seemed to me not to have quite done justice to Mark, because
  he had not given weight to the precept at the very beginning of his book. It
  was very short, and might easily have escaped me but for Paul's guidance.
  Paul, I knew, taught that Abraham was "made righteous " by "having faith" in
  God's good tidings. Hence I had noted, what Scaurus had not noted, that
  <i>Mark, alone of the evangelists, placed the precept "Have faith" in the
  first sentence uttered by Christ, saying "Have faith in the gospel."</i>
  This, then, I perceived&mdash;this "faith in the gospel" was supposed by Mark
  to have power to "make men righteous."</p>

  <p>This seemed, from a Christian point of view, to answer Scaurus's
  objection, "'Start afresh' is more easily said than done." The answer was
  &mdash;not my answer, but such an answer as I thought a Christian might
  make&mdash; "Yes, it is much more easily said than done. But the Son of God
  has authority both to say it and to give power to do it. He says, in effect,
  <i>'Be thou able to start afresh'</i> and the man is <i>'able to start
  afresh'</i>."</p>

  <p>Then, if Scaurus replied, "Prove this," Paul came forward saying, "I at
  all events have received power to 'start afresh.' Even my enemies will attest
  what I have been, a persecutor of the Christians. Now I have been 'forgiven'
  by Him that has authority to forgive. The old things are passed away. Behold,
  they are become new." And if Scaurus had said, "But have others been enabled
  to 'start afresh'?" Paul would have answered, "Yes, multitudes, from the
  Euphrates to the Tiber. Do not trust me. Take a little journey from Tusculum
  into the poorest alleys of Rome, and judge for yourself." Here I felt Paul
  would have been on such strong ground that Scaurus would have given way.
  "Paul"&mdash;he might have said&mdash;"is superstitious, and under
  hallucinations, but I must frankly confess he has the power to help people to
  'start afresh'." That is just what I, too, felt. It was quite different from
  the feeling inspired in me by my own Teacher. When Epictetus said "Let
  bygones be bygones," "Let us start afresh," "Only begin and we shall see," I
  felt, almost at once, that he was imagining impossibilities. When Paul said
  "There is a new creation," I felt that he was describing not only a
  possibility but also a fact&mdash;a fact for himself and for multitudes of
  others; not indeed a fact for me, but, even for me, a possibility.</p>

  <p>To return to Scaurus. "At last," said he, "I came upon a definite precept
  to show how perfection could be obtained. A rich young man asks Jesus how he
  can inherit eternal life. Jesus replies, 'One thing is lacking to thee. Go,
  sell thy substance, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in
  heaven, and come, follow me.' Definite enough! But is it consistent with
  morality? Is it not entirely against Paul's protest, 'Though I give all my
  goods to the poor and have not love, I am nothing'?" Here Scaurus did not
  seem to me so fair as usual. For, knowing the gospels as well as he did, he
  was aware that Jesus did not enjoin this rule on all, for example, on
  Zacchaeus. He laid down no rules. One man He bade go home, another He bade
  follow Him. Moreover, Scaurus, who accused Epictetus of borrowing from
  Christ, knew that Epictetus inculcated poverty and unmarried life, not on all
  his disciples, but on any Cynic wishing to go as a missionary; and therefore
  he ought not to have inferred that Jesus inculcated poverty on all His
  disciples because He gave it as a precept in answer to the question, "What
  lack I yet?" For my part, although I was not at that time a Christian, yet
  when I read Mark's words, "Jesus, looking upon him, loved (or embraced) him
  and said. <i>One thing is lacking to thee</i>"&mdash;I could understand that,
  for this particular man, the "one thing lacking" really might be that he
  should "sell all that he had," and that Jesus, knowing this, gave the precept
  out of His great love. Scaurus called this "a definite precept to show how
  perfection could be obtained." But I found only Matthew saying "If thou
  wouldest be perfect." Mark and Luke did not here use the word "perfect."</p>

  <p>Scaurus proceeded thus: "Little remains to be added in the way of
  precepts. There is a repetition of 'whosoever desires to be great, he shall
  be your servant.' And this is supported by the saying that 'the Son of man
  came not to be ministered unto but to minister.' Then comes a most startling
  statement, 'All things that ye pray and ask, believe that ye received them
  and they shall be unto you,' and, 'In the moment when ye stand praying' but I
  have spoken of that above. I really do not think that I have omitted anything
  of importance. Does not this amaze you?"</p>

  <p>About the "startling statement" I will speak later on. But here I may say
  that Scaurus had omitted one short precept: "Have salt in yourselves." And
  this, to some extent, answered one or two of his objections. For, as I
  understood it, "Have salt in yourselves" corresponded to a saying of
  Epictetus, who bade us seek help from "the Logos within us." On one occasion
  (noted above) Epictetus, rebuking one of our students for saying, "Give me
  some precepts to guide me," replied, "Have you not the Logos to guide you?"
  Mark appeared to me to represent Christ as saying, "Take into your hearts the
  spirit of the Son, which the Son gives you. It will be the salt of life, life
  for you and life passing from you to others, purifying all your words and
  actions by imbuing your heart." Elsewhere, also, Mark represented Christ as
  condemning the Pharisees (in the words of Isaiah) because, though they
  honoured God with their lips, their heart was far from Him and they "taught
  as doctrines the commandments of men." Mark seemed to say "Obey the
  commandments of the Logos," not "of men." Still, I could not but admit that
  this brief metaphor, overlooked by Scaurus, might easily be overlooked or
  underrated by hundreds of other readers less careful and candid; and I was
  forced to sympathize&mdash;though not wholly to agree&mdash;with the outburst
  of disappointment which concluded his letter. "O that my old friend Plutarch
  had had the writing of the life of this Jewish prophet! Or that at least he
  had been at Mark's elbow, to check him when he began descanting on extraneous
  matters and to remind him that his readers wanted to hear what he had to say
  about Christ, not about John the Baptist or Herod Antipas! Many of my friends
  think but poorly of Plutarch; but he would have been at all events infinitely
  superior to Mark. I do not wish to be hard upon the latter. The chariot of
  the gospel, so to speak, was already moving before he was harnessed to it,
  and he (not being a disciple of special insight or information) had to go the
  chariot's way. Although his book hardly ever quotes prophecy it is based on
  prophecy and continually alludes to prophecy. It does not deal with Christ's
  life as the ancient Jews dealt with the lives of Moses, Samuel, and David.
  Though it plunges into the midst of things like a book of the
  prophets&mdash;Jeremiah, for example, or Ezekiel&mdash;it does not give the
  words of the prophet in full, but runs off into all sorts of minor
  matters.</p>

  <p>"You remember what Plutarch says about the importance of expression in
  biography. Mark occasionally attempts to represent a sort of expression
  &mdash;mostly by means of such phrases as 'being moved with compassion,'
  'being grieved,' 'looking steadfastly at him,' 'turning round,' and so on.
  But the deeper sort of 'expression,' the prophet's attitude towards God and
  man, towards the past and the future, towards the kingdom of God and the
  kingdoms of men&mdash;this he does not represent. Not at least consciously.
  Perhaps he does, sometimes, unconsciously, when he preserves Christ's darker
  sayings where the later writers alter or omit them. For this, he deserves
  thanks. But, in spite of this, Mark's gospel remains, me judice&mdash;regard
  being had to the greatness of the prophet whose life he is writing&mdash;the
  most inadequate of all the biographies I know."</p>

  <p>So far Scaurus. But his admission that Mark "sometimes preserves Christ's
  darker sayings where the later writers alter or omit them" suggested to me
  that, in summing up, he felt that he might have passed over some of Mark's
  unique traditions. And, as a fact, he had omitted "every one shall be salted
  with fire," and three passages declaring that <i>"all things are
  possible."</i> He also omitted the precept "Be at peace with one another."
  Matthew and Luke omit all these, except that Matthew once has <i>"all things
  are possible."</i></p>

  <p>This last tradition presents manifest difficulty. I have heard unbelievers
  scoff at it and ask whether "evil things" are "possible" for God. Moreover
  Scaurus himself urged on one occasion that not even God can undo the past.
  Later on, when I studied the gospels with more leisure, it seemed to me that,
  in saying "all things," the Lord Jesus had constantly in view "the things of
  the invisible world" or "the things pertaining to the redemption of man." So
  I found "all things" used in Paul's epistle to the Philippians, declaring
  that the Lord Jesus Christ was to "fashion anew the body of our humiliation
  that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working
  whereby <i>he is able even to subject all things unto himself.</i>"</p>

  <p>When I came to read the fourth gospel (called John's), finding how often
  it supports Mark against Luke, I looked about for this word "possible" or
  "able" (for one and the same Greek adjective represents the two meanings).
  But John nowhere uses it. So I thought, "This then is an exception." But I
  soon found that John expressed Mark's saying, though in a different way. It
  is in a paradox, saying that the Son is <i>"able to do nothing from
  himself."</i> This looks like a confession of <i>not "being able."</i> But
  the sentence proceeds, <i>"unless he sees the Father doing something"</i>;
  and, after this, "The Father loveth the Son and showeth him all things that
  He Himself is doing." So the meaning really was, <i>"The Son can do all that
  the Father is doing and wills the Son to do."</i> John did not therefore deny
  the power of the Son. He asserted it. But he disliked speaking of "power." He
  avoided all words that mean "able," "strong," "powerful"&mdash;meaning
  "might" as distinct from "right." He prefers "authority," as when he says
  that the Son has "<i>authority</i> to lay down his life and to take it
  again."</p>

  <p>My conclusion was that Mark had recorded the actual words of Jesus, "all
  things are possible," assuming that his readers, being instructed in the
  teaching of the apostles, would understand that the words had a spiritual
  meaning, "All things are put by the Father under the feet of the Son of man."
  But sometimes, as in the Healing of the Lunatic, the meaning might be
  ambiguous, or the context might not be so given as to make the words clear.
  Hence Luke always omitted or altered them, as being obscure and likely to be
  misunderstood. John paraphrased and explained them. If these facts were
  correct, it followed that a great debt was due to Mark for preserving the
  difficult truth when there must have been a great temptation to omit it or to
  alter it into what was easy but not true. Scaurus gave some weight, but
  hardly weight enough (I thought) to this merit in Mark.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; SCAURUS ON SOME OF THE MIRACLES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"AND now," continued Scaurus, "I will tell you how the
  vision of the City of Truth and Justice, conjured up for me by that dear old
  dreamer Hermas, vanished into thin air. I intended to have spoken first about
  some of the miracles; but I will come back to them afterwards. For the
  present, turn over your Mark till you come nearly to the middle, and you will
  find a story about an act of healing at a distance. I have heard a Greek
  doctor tell stories of a man's being influenced by the death of a twin
  brother at a distance. He invented the word <i>telepatheia</i> to express it.
  Well, I will invent an analogous word for healing at a
  distance&mdash;<i>teliatreia</i>. However, it is not from the miraculous
  point of view that I wish to discuss the story, but simply as a question of
  morality.</p>

  <p>"It contains these words, 'It is not fit to take the children's bread and
  to cast it unto the dogs.' Who says this? Jesus. To whom? To a poor woman,
  called 'Greek, Syrophoenician by extraction.' What is her offence? She has
  been asking Jesus to cast an evil spirit out of her daughter. Now what do you
  think of that? The Greeks, of old, affected to call all non-Greeks
  barbarians. But would their philosophers, would Socrates, or gruff Diogenes,
  or any respectable Greek philosopher, say such a thing to any non-Greek
  woman? I admit that Jesus ultimately granted this poor creature's request.
  But that was only because she answered with the tact and patience of a
  Penelope, acquiescing in the epithet 'dogs' and replying, 'Yea, Lord, yet
  even the dogs beneath the table eat of the crumbs of the children.' Had it
  not been for her almost superhuman gentleness, she would have retired
  rejected, gaining from her petition nothing but the reproach of 'dog.' I
  write bitterly. I confess I felt bitter when I saw so noble and sublime a
  character as that of this Jewish prophet apparently degraded and polluted by
  an indelible taint of national uncharitableness/'</p>

  <p>I was beginning to investigate the passage, when my eyes fell on a note
  that Scaurus had appended at the bottom of the column. "Since writing this, I
  have looked into the passage again, to see whether I could have been misled.
  And I notice that Luke omits the whole narrative. Also, while Mark represents
  the <i>woman</i> as coming to Jesus and 'asking him' to heal the child,
  Matthew represents the <i>disciples</i> as coming to Jesus and 'asking him'
  to send her away. I should like to be able to believe that the woman was
  really a Jewess turned Gentile, that the disciples tried to drive the woman
  away, calling themselves 'the children' and her 'the dog,' that Jesus
  replied, as in Matthew, 'It was precisely these lost degraded ones that I was
  sent to restore.' In order to obtain this meaning, the changes of the text
  would not be very great. But I fear this cannot be maintained."</p>

  <p>I caught at Scaurus's explanation, and was sorry that he himself did not
  hold to it. For I was more troubled by this objection of his than by anything
  else that he had said; and I thought long over it. Finally, I came to the
  conclusion that Scaurus was nearly right; that this woman, though called "a
  Syrophoenician by extraction," was a Jewess (as Barnabas the Jew is called "a
  Cyprian by extraction") and that she had fallen away into Greek idolatry and
  an evil life, so that Jesus&mdash;being, like Paul, all things to all men and
  women&mdash;was on this one occasion cruel in word in order to be kind in
  deed, stimulating her to better things. This agreed with Paul's use of the
  word "dogs," which assuredly he would not have applied except to
  "evil-doers." If, however, it should be demonstrated that the woman was not a
  Jewess, and not leading an impure life, and that Jesus (not the disciples)
  used these words to her, then I should still believe in the kindness of
  Jesus, although these words were apparently unkind. No one would suspect
  cruelty, in a man habitually kind, except on very strong evidence. Here the
  evidence was not strong. The witnesses were two, not three; and the two
  narratives disagreed in important details. This was the conclusion to which I
  then came.</p>

  <p>If Scaurus had read the epistles before the gospels, approaching the
  latter with some feeling of Christ's constraining "love," he could hardly
  have stumbled (so I thought and so I think still) at this single narrative.
  Jesus did not call the centurion a "dog." Jesus had also supported the law of
  kindness against the law of the sabbath. He had said that "that which goes
  into the mouth" does not defile a man. He had eaten and drunk with publicans
  and sinners. How was it possible that a prophet of such broad and lofty views
  as these could call a poor afflicted woman a "dog" simply because she was not
  a Jewess? I longed to be near my old friend and to appeal to his common sense
  and justice, and I felt sure that I should have convinced him. Even if Jesus
  bade the missionaries at first go only to "the lost sheep of the house of
  Israel," that seemed to me quite consistent with a purpose that in the end
  the gospel should be proclaimed to all nations.</p>

  <p>In another narrative, which had caused me difficulty of the same kind,
  Scaurus gave me help. It is not in Mark. But I will set it down here because
  it bears on kindness. Matthew and Luke represented a disciple as asking to be
  allowed, before following Christ, to "bury" his father, and as not being
  allowed. "As to this," said Scaurus, "I have no doubt that the man meant,
  'Suffer me to wait at home till I have seen my aged father into the grave and
  have duly buried him.' Similarly Esau says, in effect, 'My father will die
  before long. I will wait till I have mourned for him before killing Jacob.'
  So, in Latin, we say 'I have buried them all,' meaning 'I have survived and
  buried all my relations.' My rabbi confirms me in this view. Christ always
  defends nature and natural affection against man's conventions, so that it
  seems to me absurd to suppose that he would enjoin anything really
  inhuman."</p>

  <p>Scaurus next proceeded to attack the miraculous part of Mark's narrative.
  Mark, he said, considering the smallness of his gospel, describes many more
  miracles, relatively, than Matthew and Luke. "As to miracles," said he, "I am
  ready to believe in anything, miraculous or non-miraculous, on sufficient
  evidence. But the evidence about Mark s miracles leads me to two conclusions.
  Some of them occurred but were not miraculous. The rest, although they were
  honestly supposed to have occurred, did not occur.</p>

  <p>"Let us take the first class first. Mark calls them 'powers,' i.e. works
  of power. That is a good name for them. But Mark seems to think that, if a
  man has 'power' to cast out demons and perform cures without medical means,
  such a one must be a great prophet or even a Son of God. To that I demur. I
  remember, when I was in Dacia, one of my men was down with fever, and bad
  fever, too. But when the bugles sounded out one night, and the enemy came on,
  beating in our outposts and pouring into our camp on the backs of some of our
  cowardly rascals, this brave fellow was up and doing, without helmet or
  armour, in the front with the best of them. Next morning, he was none the
  worse. Nor was there any relapse. He was quite cured. I think I have told you
  how Josephus described to me the casting out of a demon in the presence of
  Vespasian. And I might remind you of Tacitus's story about the cure of a
  blind man by the same emperor. I suspect, however, that the former was a mere
  conjuring trick and that the latter was got up by the priests
  of&mdash;Serapis, I think it was. So I lay no stress on either. But I have
  spoken to many sensible physicians, who tell me that paralysis and some kinds
  of fever can be cured by what they call an emotional shock. Often the cure
  does not last. Some of these physicians go a little further and ascribe to
  certain persons a peculiar power of quieting restless patients and pacifying
  or even healing the insane. But I entirely refuse to believe that, if a man
  has such a power, he can consequently claim to be a Son of God."</p>

  <p>About the objection thus raised by Scaurus I have said enough already. It
  seemed to me that the power of permanently healing the paralysed, and
  permanently pacifying and healing the insane, was quite different from that
  of startling a paralysed man into a temporary activity. The former appeared
  to me allied with moral power and with steadfastness of mind, and likely to
  be an attribute of the Son of God. Still I was sorry that Mark devoted so
  much space to it. Here I agreed, in part, with Scaurus.</p>

  <p>He then passed to the second class of miracles, "those that were honestly
  supposed to have occurred, but did not occur." "If," said he, "I assert that
  Mark turned metaphorical traditions into literal prose, you must not suppose
  that I accuse him of dishonesty. All the ancient Jews did it. Look at the
  story of Joshua, describing how he stopped the sun. Perhaps also you have
  read how God caused a stream to spring up from the Ass's Jawbone (originally
  a hill of that name, like the headland or peninsula called <i>Ass's
  Jawbone</i> in Laconia, which you and I passed together some five or six
  years ago). The second (the jawbone miracle) is somewhat different in origin
  from the first (the sun miracle). There are many shades of verbal
  misunderstanding capable of converting non-fact into alleged fact. There was
  all the more excuse for this error in Christian Jews (such as Mark and
  others) because of two reasons. In the first place, the prophets had
  predicted that all manner of disease (blindness, deafness, lameness) would be
  cured in the days of the Messiah (using even such expressions as 'thy dead
  men shall awake'). In the second place, Christ did actually&mdash;as I have
  admitted&mdash;cure some diseases, such as insanity, fever, and paralysis.
  How, then, could it be other than a difficult task, in such circumstances, to
  distinguish the literal from the metaphorical traditions about the cures
  effected by Christ?"</p>

  <p>I could all the less deny the force of these remarks because I had been
  studying the words, "Whatsoever things ye ask, praying, believe that ye have
  received them and they shall be unto you." These words, if applied
  literally&mdash;to bread, for example, or money&mdash;were manifestly not
  true. Indeed they were absurd. How could a man honestly believe that he had
  received a thousand sesterces in the act of praying for them? But if applied
  spiritually, as in Paul's prayer concerning the thorn in the flesh, they
  might (I felt) be true for one endowed with great faith. Paul prayed that the
  "thorn" might "depart" from him. In one sense it did not depart. But in
  another sense, it did depart because God so increased his strength that the
  "thorn" became as nothing.</p>

  <p>Now in this same passage of Mark I found the following: "Whosoever shall
  say to this mountain, 'Be lifted and thrown into the sea,' and shall not
  doubt in his heart but believes in that very moment that what he says is
  happening, it shall be unto him." Luke also elsewhere had, "If ye have faith
  as a grain of mustard-seed, ye would say to this sycamine-tree, 'Be uprooted
  and be planted in the sea,' and it would have obeyed you." I took for granted
  that "mountain," "mustard-seed," and "sycamine-tree," must all have been
  metaphorically used.</p>

  <p>Scaurus confirmed this view, saying that the Jews were in the habit of
  calling a learned interpreter of the Law an uprooter of mountains,
  <i>i.e.</i> of spiritual obstacles blocking the path of the students of the
  law. But then he added something that amazed me, "Matthew has, 'If ye have
  faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do the deed of the fig-tree, but even
  if ye say to this mountain, Be lifted and thrown into the sea, it shall come
  to pass.' Now, 'mountain' being metaphorical, you might naturally anticipate
  that Matthew intended 'fig-tree' to be metaphorical. But if you look back a
  little, you will find that <i>Matthew actually imagines that there was a
  literal fig-tree in question</i>. So does Mark. He and Matthew turn the
  metaphor into a literal miracle, as follows.</p>

  <p>"In the first place, Jesus comes to a literal fig-tree, seeking literal
  fruit. He finds none. Consequently, say Mark and Matthew, a curse of
  barrenness was pronounced on it by Jesus. What followed? The tree was at once
  'dried up,' or (according to Mark) 'dried up from the roots.' Now first note
  that the Hebrew word that means 'barren' means also <i>'root up'</i>, <i>'cut
  off</i>,' or <i>'cut down.'</i> Then pass to Luke. He omits the whole of this
  <i>miracle</i> about a fig-tree. But he has a <i>parable</i> about a
  fig-tree. The Lord of a vineyard comes to a barren fig-tree, and gives orders
  that it shall be <i>'cut down.'</i> The vine-dresser intercedes for it that
  it may be spared for one year more in case it may bear fruit."</p>

  <p>I looked and found that the story in Mark and Matthew was as Scaurus had
  described it. But another detail astonished me. It was a phrase that followed
  the words, "While they were passing by early in the
  morning"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the morning after the curse had been
  pronounced&mdash;"they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots." Instead of
  writing that they were all amazed at the speed with which the curse had been
  fulfilled, Mark wrote, "And <i>Peter, remembering it,</i> says to him,
  'Rabbi, behold, the fig-tree that thou cursedst is withered up'." Trying to
  put myself in the place of Peter, I asked, "What should I have done when I
  approached the spot? How could I fail to be on the alert to note the tree
  that my Master cursed yesterday? How could any of my companions fail? How was
  it possible that any of us could forget? How could I possibly talk about
  <i>'remembering'</i> it? How, therefore, could a historian suppose it needful
  to insert that I, or any of us, <i>'remembered'</i>?"</p>

  <p>Turning to Matthew, I found that he got rid of "remembering," and of
  "Peter" too, by making the miracle occur instantaneously, thus, "He said unto
  it [<i>i.e.</i> to the tree], 'Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward
  for ever.' And immediately the fig-tree withered away. And when the disciples
  saw it, they marvelled, saying, 'How did the fig-tree immediately wither away
  '?"</p>

  <p>Scaurus explained the whole matter as follows: "Look at Ezekiel's saying,
  'I the Lord <i>have dried up the green tree</i>' and its context. You will
  find that <i>'the green tree'</i> is Tyre. Elsewhere Luke has a proverb about
  'the green tree and the dry,' where 'the dry' refers to the destruction of
  Jerusalem by the Romans. So here, the fig-tree, green but barren, is
  Jerusalem. Luke has given the parable correctly. The Lord of the vineyard, he
  says, comes to a fig-tree, i.e. Jerusalem, in the vineyard, that is, in
  Judah. He does not say that it is green, but we may imagine that. However, it
  has no fruit.</p>

  <p>'Let it be <i>cut down</i>' says the Lord. Well, I have shown you that
  'Let it be cut down' might mean, in Hebrew, 'Let it be <i>barren</i> so that
  none may eat fruit from it,' or 'Let it be <i>dried up</i>,' As a historical
  fact, the fig-tree was <i>cut down</i>, or <i>dried up</i>, when Jerusalem
  was destroyed by Titus. But that was not immediate. It was long after the
  resurrection. <i>When Jerusalem was destroyed,</i> the disciples
  <i>remembered</i>"&mdash;this explained my difficulty above
  mentioned&mdash;"that the Lord had pronounced this curse on Jerusalem. I
  could show you, if space allowed,, that the name 'Peter' (which would be in
  Hebrew 'Simon') might be confused (in Hebrew) with our Latin phrase 'qui cum
  eo erant' meaning 'those that were with him,' <i>i.e.</i> Christ's,
  disciples, and also that Mark's phrase 'passing by <i>early</i>' may be an
  error for 'passing along to <i>inspect</i>, <i>visit</i>, or <i>seek</i>
  fruit.' Having regard to the fact that Peter died a year or two before the
  city was destroyed, I am inclined to think that it was 'the disciples,' not
  'Peter,' that 'remembered.' But there is no space for details. It must
  suffice to have shown you how a <i>parable</i> of Jesus, about <i>cutting
  down</i> a fig-tree, <i>'remembered'</i> by his disciples long afterwards as
  referring to Jerusalem, has been converted by Mark and Matthew into a
  portentous miracle about <i>withering</i> a fig-tree instantaneously
  (according to Matthew) or by the following morning (according to Mark)."</p>

  <p>This explanation of <i>"remembering"</i> seemed exactly to meet my
  difficulty. I accepted it at once. Subsequently I found that the fourth
  gospel twice represents the disciples as "remembering" after Christ's
  resurrection, things that He had said or done before the resurrection, which
  things, at the time, they had not fully understood. Moreover that gospel
  declared that, up to the evening before Christ's crucifixion. His words had
  been "dark sayings" to them, but that the Spirit would "call them back to
  their minds," or "remind them" of their meaning. This confirmed me in the
  conclusion that the Withering of the Fig-Tree was a parable, not a history,
  and that the disciples <i>"remembered"</i> it, and were reminded of its
  meaning by the Holy Spirit, after the Lord had risen from the dead.</p>

  <p>Scaurus added a reference to a lecture of Epictetus, which, he said, I
  must have heard, and which bore on the story of the fig-tree. I had heard it
  and remembered it well. The subject was, in effect, "The Precocious
  Philosopher." Epictetus likened him to a precocious fruit-tree. "You have
  flowered too soon," he said; "The winter will scorch you up, or rather you
  are already frostbitten. Let me alone! Why do you wish me, before my
  season"&mdash;he meant, blooming before the seasonable preparation&mdash;"to
  be withered away as you are withered yourself?" This, Scaurus said, was
  perhaps borrowed from Mark. I examined the text of the lecture, and it seemed
  to me that his conjecture was by no means improbable.</p>

  <p>Scaurus proceeded, "I could go through Mark's other miracles in the same
  way&mdash;those I mean that are not acts of healing&mdash;and show you that
  they are all metaphors misunderstood. But I have given too much space to
  these unimportant matters. At least I consider them unimportant except so far
  as they show Mark to be historically untrustworthy. Now I must pass to more
  important things, merely adding&mdash;as an instance of this man's curious
  want of all sense of proportion&mdash;that while giving&mdash;how often must
  I repeat this!&mdash;a whole column to Herod Antipas's birthday and its
  consequences, he does not give one line, or one word, to Christ's
  resurrection&mdash;except in predictions made by Christ himself or in
  statements made by angels. I am not a Christian, nor a half-way Christian.
  But I have an immense admiration for Christ and an immense curiosity to know
  the exact facts about his life, death, and subsequent influence on his
  disciples. To me therefore, simply as a historian&mdash;or as a mere man
  interested in the affairs of men&mdash;this absolute silence about that which
  should have been most fully stated and supported by the evidence of
  eyewitnesses, is nothing short of provoking. Will you not agree with me,
  after this, that Mark is the most inadequate of biographers?"</p>

  <p>I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read this. "Scaurus," I said,
  "must for once have made a mistake, or his copy of Mark must have been
  defective." But my copy confirmed his. It ended with the words, "For they
  were afraid." This was too much for me. Perhaps I was overwrought with long
  and close study and with the strain of attempting to grapple with Scaurus's
  criticisms. I remember to this day&mdash;and not with entire self-
  condemnation, for it was Mark, not Mark's subject, that disappointed
  me&mdash;that in a sudden storm of passion I threw the gospel down and vowed
  I would never look at it again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; SCAURUS ON CHRIST'S BIRTH</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the following morning my indignation against Mark began
  to seem certainly hasty and possibly unjust. True, his book was apparently
  without beginning or end, disfigured by superfluities and omissions, and
  extraordinarily disproportioned. But what if he had no time to revise it?
  What if it was a collection of notes about Christ's mighty works and short
  sayings, which he was intending to combine with a collection of Christ's
  doctrine when he died&mdash;died perhaps suddenly, perhaps was put to death?
  I tried to find excuses for his work. Still, I could not deny that, if
  Scaurus was right as to the story of the fig-tree, the earliest of the
  evangelists showed a deplorable inability to distinguish the things that
  preceded Christ's resurrection from the things that followed it. I resolved,
  however, that this should not deter me from continuing my study of the other
  gospels. My disappointment with Mark increased my admiration&mdash;it was not
  then more than admiration&mdash;for Christ, whom he seemed to me to have
  failed to represent. "Perhaps," said I, "Matthew and Luke will do more
  justice to the subject." So I took up their gospels. The resurrection was
  what I most wanted to read about. But I decided to begin at the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>"In style, proportion, arrangement, and subject-matter," said Scaurus,
  "Matthew and Luke are much more satisfactory than Mark, although Mark often
  preserves the earliest and purest form of Christ's short sayings. When I say
  'Matthew,' you must understand that I do not know who he is. I am convinced
  that Matthew the publican, one of Christ's twelve apostles, is not
  responsible for the work called by his name. Flaccus&mdash;whom I more than
  suspect of Christian proclivities&mdash;knows a good deal about these
  matters. Well, according to Flaccus, 'Matthew' wrote in Hebrew. 'Everyone
  agrees about it,' he says. An early Hebrew gospel would naturally be
  attributed to Matthew. He, being a 'publican,' or tax-collector, would
  necessarily be able to write. Peter and John are said to have been ignorant
  of letters. There are more styles than one in Matthew&mdash;a fact that
  suggests compilation. Luke, an educated man, and perhaps identical with a
  'beloved physician 'mentioned in one of Paul's epistles, certainly compiled
  his books from various sources; 'Matthew' almost certainly did the same.
  Later on, I will speak of their versions of Christ's discourses. Now I must
  confine myself to their accounts of a very important subject&mdash;Christ's
  supernatural birth."</p>

  <p>Up to this point I had been reading with little interest, doubting whether
  it would not be better to pass on to the accounts of the resurrection. As I
  have explained above, my study of Paul's epistles had not led me to believe
  that there would be anything miraculous about the birth of Christ. The phrase
  "supernatural birth," therefore, came on me quite unexpectedly. What
  followed, riveted my attention: "Mark, as you know, says nothing about
  Christ's parentage. First he gives, as title, 'The beginning of the gospel of
  Jesus Christ'&mdash;where, by the way, old Hermas has written, in my margin,
  'some add, <i>Son of God</i>! Then there is a Voice from heaven, at the
  moment of Christ's baptism, heard (apparently) only by John the Baptist and
  Jesus, 'Thou art my beloved Son.' A similar Voice occurs later on. Mark
  represents a blind man as calling Jesus 'son of David,' and his
  fellow-townsmen say, 'Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary? 'This might
  indicate merely that Joseph the carpenter was dead. But 'Son of Mary' might
  be used in two other ways. The enemies of Jesus might use it to suggest that
  he was a bastard. The worshippers of Jesus might use it (later on) to show
  that he was a Son of God, not born of any human father. Matthew has, 'Is not
  this the carpenter's son?' This, however, Matthew might write not as his own
  belief, but as that of Christ's fellow-townsmen. Luke, who has 'Is not this
  Joseph's son? ', gives the whole of the narrative quite differently. I should
  add that the first Voice from heaven is differently given in some copies of
  Luke." I examined this at once. My copy had a marginal note, "Some have,
  <i>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</i>"</p>

  <p>"You see," said Scaurus, "in these early divergences, traces of early
  differences as to the time and manner in which Jesus became the Son of God.
  Paul appears to me to have believed that the sonship pre-existed in heaven.
  'God,' he says, 'in the fullness of time, sent forth His son, born of a
  woman, born under the law, that he might redeem those that were under the
  law.' In Job, 'born of a woman' implies imperfection, or mortality. In Paul,
  born of a woman' and 'born under the law' imply two self-humiliations
  undergone by the Son of God. Paul's view is that the Redeemer must needs make
  himself one with those whom he redeems. Since the Jews were not only 'born of
  a woman' but also 'born under the law,' the Son of God came down from heaven
  and placed himself under both these humiliations. Paul, therefore, seems to
  have regarded the divine birth as taking place in heaven from the beginning,
  but the human birth as a self-humbling on earth, wherein the Son of God
  becomes incarnate in the form of the son of Joseph, of the seed of David,
  after the flesh."</p>

  <p>This had been my inference from Paul's epistles, as I have said above. But
  what followed was quite new to me: "You are aware from Paul's epistles that
  Christ is regarded by him as preeminently the Seed of Promise, Isaac being
  merely the type. Well, listen to what Philo, a Jew, somewhat earlier than
  Paul, declares about the birth of Isaac. Philo says, ' The Lord begot Isaac'
  Philo describes Sarah as 'becoming pregnant when alone and visited by God.'
  It was God also, he says, who 'opened the womb of Leah.' Moses, too, 'having
  received Zipporah, finds her pregnant by no mortal.' All this is, of course,
  quite distinct from our popular stories of the love affairs of Jupiter. You
  may see this from Philo's context: 'It is fitting that God should converse,
  in an opposite manner to that of men, with a nature undefiled, unpolluted,
  and pure, the genuine Virgin. For whereas the cohabitation of men makes
  virgins wives (lit. women), on the other hand when God begins to associate
  with a soul, what was wife before He now makes Virgin again.' I could quote
  other instances, but these will suffice. Now I ask you to reflect how such
  language as this would be interpreted in the west, not only by slaves, but
  even by people of education, unaccustomed to the language of the east, but
  familiar with our western stories of the births of Hercules, Castor and
  Pollux, Bacchus and others."</p>

  <p>I saw at once that the language would be liable to be taken literally. But
  on the other hand it seemed to me that no disciple of Paul could accept
  anything like our western stories. Scaurus had anticipated an objection of
  this kind in his next words: "You must not suppose, however, that Hebrew
  literature contains, or that Jewish or Christian thought would tolerate, such
  stories as those in Ovid. Nor will you find anything of this kind in Matthew
  and Luke, to whose narratives we will now pass. Matthew says, rather
  abruptly, that Joseph, finding Mary, his betrothed but not yet his wife, to
  be with child, and intending to put her away secretly, received a vision of
  an angel and a voice bidding him not to fear to take to himself Mary his
  wife, for she was with child from the Holy Spirit, and 'she will bring forth
  a child and thou shalt call his name Jesus.' Luke, after a much longer
  introduction (about which I shall speak presently), says that a vision and a
  voice came to Mary&mdash;he does not mention one to Joseph&mdash;bidding her
  not to fear, and saying 'Thou shalt conceive and bring forth a child, and
  shalt call his name Jesus.' In theory, it is of course possible that two
  similar visions might come, one to Mary and another to Joseph, bidding both
  'not to fear.' But Matthew adds something that points to an entirely
  different explanation: 'Now all this hath come to pass that it might be
  fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, <i>Behold
  the virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall
  call his name Emmanuel</i>'."</p>

  <p>These words I had myself read in Isaiah and had taken as referring to a
  promise made in the context, namely, that in a short time&mdash;two or three
  years, just time enough for a child to be conceived and to be born and to
  grow up to the age when it could say "father" and "mother"&mdash;the kings of
  Syria and Samaria would be destroyed. Accordingly Isaiah says that he himself
  married a wife immediately afterwards and that the prophecy was fulfilled.
  Having recently read these words more than once, I was prepared to find that
  Scaurus interpreted them in the same way. He added that the most learned of
  the Jews themselves did the same, and that the Hebrew does not mention
  "virgin," but "young woman." "This," said he, "I heard from a learned rabbi,
  who added, 'The LXX is full of blunders, but we are hoping for a more
  faithful rendering, from a very learned scholar named Aquila, which will
  probably appear soon'." Here I may say that this translation has actually
  appeared&mdash;it came out about ten years ago&mdash;in quite unreadable
  Greek, but very faithful to the Hebrew; and it renders the word, not
  "virgin," but "young woman," as Scaurus had said.</p>

  <p>It was this very rendering that caused a coolness between me and Justin of
  Samaria. It happened, I am sorry to say, shortly before he suffered for the
  sake of the Saviour, in this present year in which I am writing. I chanced to
  meet him coming out of the school of Diodorus, in his philosopher's cloak as
  usual, but hot and flustered, not looking at all like a philosopher. Some
  people&mdash;Jews, to judge by their faces&mdash;were jeering and pointing
  after him in mockery. Justin&mdash;furious with them, but also (as I thought)
  worried and uncomfortable in himself&mdash;appealed to me: "I have been
  contending for the Lord," said he, "against these dogs. They flout and mock
  me for demonstrating how fraudulently and profanely they have mutilated the
  Holy Scriptures, cancelling some parts and altering others, when translating
  them into Greek." Then he instanced this very passage, in which he said the
  Jews had vilely corrupted the rendering of the Hebrew from "virgin" to "young
  woman." I would have kept silence; but, as he pressed me to say whether I did
  not agree with him, I was obliged to reply that I did not; and I added that
  not only Aquila rendered it thus, but other good scholars, many of them
  Christians. Upon this, he flung away from me in disgust, without one word of
  salutation, and I never saw him again.</p>

  <p>The fact was, he had committed himself in writing, about ten years before,
  to this false charge against the Jews, and to many other baseless
  accusations. There was no way out of it now, but either to retract or to face
  it out. He was a brave man and knew how to face death. But he was not brave
  enough to allow himself to be conquered by facts. Samaritan by birth, he had
  something of the Samaritan&mdash;but not of the Good Samaritan&mdash;in his
  hatred of the Jews. Had he loved the truth as much as he hated those whom he
  called truth's enemies, he would perhaps have gone on to cease from his hate,
  and would have become no less faithful as a Christian than as a martyr.</p>

  <p>Now I must return to Scaurus. "Luke," said he, "was an educated man, and
  saw at once that this prophecy about 'the virgin' did not apply. So he
  omitted it. This he had a right to do. It was only an evangelist's opinion,
  not a statement of anything that had actually occurred. But there remained
  the tradition of fact, namely, that an angel had appeared and had announced
  the future birth of a child begotten from the Holy Spirit. Luke regarded this
  announcement as made to the mother, like the announcements&mdash;not the same
  of course, but similar&mdash;made to Sarah, Rebecca, and the mothers of
  Samson and Samuel. Moreover in Matthew's account&mdash;as I judge from
  Hermas's marginal notes&mdash;there are many variations, some of which leave
  it open to believe that the utterance to Joseph (like that to Abraham before
  Isaac's birth) referred merely to God's spiritual generating, so that Jesus,
  though the Son of God according to the spirit, was yet, according to the
  flesh, the son of David by descent from Joseph, Luke expresses his
  disagreement from this view by giving various utterances of Mary and the
  angel at such length that they may be called hymns or poems. And
  indeed&mdash;if judged liberally and not by the pedantical rules of Atticists
  or over-strict grammarians&mdash;they are poems, by no means without
  beauty.</p>

  <p>"Luke adds another narrative in which he makes the birth of John the
  Baptist serve as a foil (so to speak) to the birth of Christ. John, like
  Christ, was born as a child of promise, after a vision of an angel. But there
  the likeness ceases. The vision is to the father, not to the mother. The
  father disbelieves and is punished by dumbness. Elizabeth, the mother, was
  not a virgin. She, like the wife of Abraham, was barren up to old age. There
  is no vision to Elizabeth, and no mention of divine generation. If a Jew,
  Philo for example, were to say to Luke, 'Your Messiah may have been a son of
  God and yet son of Joseph (as Isaac was son of Abraham)' Luke might reply,
  'Read my book, and you will see that it was not so. John the Baptist might be
  called son of God after this fashion, but Jesus was born in quite a different
  manner.'"</p>

  <p>After this, Scaurus went on to treat of Christ's pedigrees, as given by
  Matthew and Luke, showing Christ's descent, the former from Abraham, the
  latter from Adam. These details I shall not give in full. Scaurus had
  something of the mind of a lawyer and something of the eagerness of a hound
  hunting by scent, and, as he said himself, when once on a trail he could not
  stop. "Matthew," said he, "omits three consecutive kings of Judah in one
  place and a fourth in another. I pointed this out to my old rabbi
  above-mentioned, and he laughed and said, 'My own people do that sort of
  thing. History is not our strong point. We like facts to fit nicely, and this
  writer of yours has made them fit. Does he not himself almost tell you that
  he is squaring matters, when he says that there are fourteen generations from
  Abraham to David, and fourteen from David to the captivity, and fourteen from
  the captivity to Christ? This is symmetrical, but it is not what your model
  Thucydides would call history.' My rabbi went on to say, 'A more serious
  blunder, from our point of view, is that this Christian has included in the
  ancestry of his Christ a king called Jeconiah about whom one of our prophets,
  Jeremiah, says, "Write ye this man childless, for no man of his seed shall
  prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah ".'
  Then, seeing the two papyri lying side by side on the table before me, he
  added, 'I see you have another pedigree there, does that make the same
  blunder?' 'No,' said I, 'the author was named Luke, a physician, an educated
  man and a great compiler of documents. He gives quite a different pedigree.'
  'I am not surprised,' said my rabbi. 'If he was a sensible man, he could
  hardly do otherwise.'"</p>

  <p>So far Scaurus. He did not anticipate what I have lived to experience.
  Quite recently I heard some Christians use this very mention of Jeconiah in
  an opposite direction, namely, as a proof that Matthew believed Jesus to have
  descended from God, but not from Joseph after the flesh. In particular, I
  have heard a young but rising teacher, Irenaeus by name, argue as follows,
  "If indeed He had been the son of Joseph, He could not, according to
  Jeremiah, be either king or heir, for Joseph is shown to be the son of
  Joachim and Jeconiah as also Matthew sets forth in his pedigree." Then he
  went on to quote Jeremiah's prophecy that Jeconiah should be childless and
  have no successor on the throne of David. And his argument was to this
  effect, "Christ is the royal son of David. Therefore He could not have
  descended from Jeconiah, Joseph's ancestor. Matthew knew this. Therefore
  Matthew, though giving Joseph's pedigree, did not mean to imply that Jesus
  was the son of Joseph." And this seemed to convince those who heard him! I
  also heard this same Irenaeus, in the same lecture, say, "If He were the son
  of Joseph, how could He be greater than Solomon.... or greater than David,
  when He was generated from the same seed, and was a descendant of these
  men?"</p>

  <p>After we had gone out from Irenaeus's lecture, I asked the friend sitting
  next to me to explain this argument to me; for it seemed to me to prove that
  a man could not be greater than his ancestors.</p>

  <p>"Ah, but you forget," he replied, "<i>what</i> ancestors. They were
  <i>royal</i> ancestors. How could the son of a mere carpenter be greater than
  David or Solomon?" It seemed to me that the sinless son of "a mere carpenter"
  might be greater in the eyes of God than a whole world of such royal sinners.
  But I found it hard to convince him that I was even speaking seriously!</p>

  <p>To return to Scaurus. He dealt next with the pedigree in Luke. " You might
  have supposed in these circumstances," said he, "that Luke would drop the
  pedigree of Joseph altogether, and give only that of Mary. Well, he has not
  done this. Another course would have been to state clearly that Jesus was not
  really, but only putatively, the son of Joseph (being really the son of God)
  and to add that he gave the pedigree of Joseph, as Matthew gives it, because
  Joseph was the putative father. Well, he has not quite done this either; but
  he has done half of it. He has written 'being the son, as was supposed, of
  Joseph.' But he has also given a pedigree of Joseph differing from that of
  Matthew in that portion which extends from Joseph to David. What do you think
  of this?"</p>

  <p>I thought that the whole thing was a cobweb and wished Scaurus would pass
  to something more interesting. But he continued, "My rabbi suggested that
  Luke had invented a new genealogy. But when I dissented&mdash;for I am
  convinced that neither Luke nor Matthew invented, and that these early
  writers generally were very simple honest souls&mdash;he asked me whether I
  knew of any instance in the gospels where the name spelt in Greek <i>Eli</i>
  or <i>Heli</i> was misunderstood. I replied that there was one instance where
  Jesus used it to mean <i>my God</i>, but the bystanders took it to mean
  <i>Elias</i>, 'Well then,' said the rabbi, 'I should not be surprised if your
  honest compiler Luke, a learned man perhaps in Greek, but innocent of Hebrew,
  had got hold of some tradition saying, <i>Jesus was supposed to be the son of
  Joseph, being the son of God,</i> Though in Hebrew there is a difference
  between the spelling of <i>El</i>, God, and the name <i>Eli</i>, there is not
  much difference in Greek. And Luke, having once started on the scent of a new
  pedigree supposed to connect Jesus with <i>Heli</i>, ransacked various Jewish
  genealogies till he found one containing the name, and adopted it as a
  substitute for Matthew's.' This was what my rabbi suggested. All I can say is
  that it seems to me more probable than that Luke invented the genealogy."</p>

  <p>Scaurus entered into further details to vindicate Luke's honesty,
  concluding as follows, "My own belief is that the parents of John and of
  Jesus were good, pure, simple, noble-minded people, liable to dreams and to
  the seeing of visions and to the hearing of voices. As to 'dreams,' by the
  way, look at the earliest account of the Lord's appearing to Solomon 'In
  Gibeon, the Lord appeared to Solomon <i>in a dream... Solomon awoke, and
  behold it was a dream.</i>' Then look at the later account in Chronicles,
  <i>'In that night did God appear unto Solomon.'</i> No 'dream' and no
  'awaking'! <i>Verbum sapienti!</i> The facts above alleged&mdash;to which I
  could add&mdash;when combined with the influence of prophecy&mdash;seem to me
  to explain everything in Matthew's and Luke's Introductions as being at once
  morally truthful and historically untrue."</p>

  <p>Later on, Scaurus said, "Luke himself in his story of Christ's childhood,
  does not seem to me to be so consistent as an educated writer would have been
  if he had been dishonestly inventing. For he represents Mary as saying to her
  son, 'Behold, thy father and I seek thee sorrowing.' By 'thy father' she
  means Joseph. But could she have used this language, or felt this sorrow, if
  she had realised indeed that her son was not one of the many children of the
  Father of Gods and men, but that he was unique, God incarnate? This and many
  other points convince me that Luke (in his account of the birth) is not
  composing fiction, but only compiling, harmonizing, adapting, and moulding
  into a historical shape, what should have been preserved as poetic
  legend."</p>

  <p>Scaurus then gave one more detail from Mark, "who," said he, "meagre
  though he is, often records actual history where later accounts disguise it.
  Mark says that, when Jesus was preaching the gospel, his own family
  (literally <i>'those from him'</i> that is, <i>'those of his household'</i>)
  'came to lay hands on him; for they said, <i>He is beside himself,</i>'
  Matthew and Luke omit this. But Matthew and Luke agree with Mark when the
  latter goes on to describe how the mother of Jesus and his brethren come to
  the place where he is preaching. Not being able to reach him through the
  crowd, they send word that they desire to speak to him. Jesus does not go out
  nor stop his preaching. Those who obeyed the gospel, he said, were his mother
  and his brethren. I have said that Matthew and Luke omit the attempt of
  Christ's family to stop him from preaching as being out of his mind. Probably
  variations in the text enabled them honestly to omit it, believing it to be
  erroneous. And indeed how could they believe otherwise? How could Matthew and
  Luke believe that Mary would accompany the brethren of Jesus in an attempt to
  'lay hands' on him after recording what they have previously recorded about
  the supernatural birth? Lay hands on her divine Son, the Son of God, engaged
  in proclaiming the will of his Father in heaven! The story might well seem to
  them incredible. But it bears the plain stamp of genuine truth."</p>

  <p>Scaurus then pointed out the divergence between Matthew and Luke as to the
  manner in which Jesus came to be born in Bethlehem. This I omit. But in the
  course of it he showed me how Matthew has been influenced by prophecies
  applied by the Christian Jews to Christ, as being their Deliverer from
  Captivity, and their Comforter in time of trouble. "For example," said he,
  "since <i>'Egypt'</i> in Hebrew poetry is often synonymous with
  <i>'bondage'</i> the Christian Jews might naturally praise God in their songs
  and hymns for fulfilling, through Christ, the prophecy, 'Out of Egypt have I
  called my son,' <i>i.e.</i> Israel, meaning that God had called them, the new
  Israel, out of <i>'bondage'</i> (as Paul often says) into the liberty of the
  children of God. But Matthew takes this as meaning that, when Christ was a
  little child, he was literally <i>'called out of Egypt.'</i> Hence he is
  driven to infer that he must have been taken to Egypt. For such a journey he
  finds a reason by supposing that it was to escape from the sword of Herod. He
  fits in this story with another prophecy representing Rachel as weeping for
  her children, and as being consoled by the Lord. Hence Matthew infers a
  massacre of children by Herod in Bethlehem, corresponding, on a small scale,
  to the wholesale destruction from which the infant Moses escaped. But such a
  massacre is not mentioned by any evangelist, or by Josephus, or by any other
  historian or writer known to me."</p>

  <p>I was depressed by this, and eager to pass on to something more
  satisfactory. So was Scaurus. "I have no desire," he said, "to dwell on these
  points. I am interested in the biographies of all great teachers,
  philosophers, and law-givers, as well as conquerors&mdash;<i>so far as they
  are true.</i> Untruth gives me no pleasure, but disappointment&mdash;unmixed
  except for the slight pleasure one may find in tracking an error to its hole
  and killing it.</p>

  <p>"With much greater pleasure shall I turn to Matthew's and Luke's accounts
  of the words and deeds of Christ. Only I will add that, were I a Christian, I
  should long for a new gospel that would go back to facts, rejecting these
  additions of Matthew and Luke. Not that I would go back to Mark. By
  <i>'facts,'</i> I do not mean such facts as John the Baptist's diet of
  locusts and clothing of camel's hair. But surely a genuine worshipper of
  Christ&mdash;I can conceive such a thing; for after all, what is more worthy
  of worship on earth, next to God Himself, than 'the man that is as righteous
  as possible,' concerning whom Socrates says that there is 'nothing more like
  God'?&mdash;I say a genuine Christian, if he were also a philosopher, might
  surely find it possible to state in a few simple words his conviction that,
  whereas John the son of Zachariah was sent by the Logos, and contained only a
  portion of the Logos, Jesus the son of Joseph was actually the Logos
  incarnate. I wholly reject such a notion myself, partly because I am not sure
  that I believe that there is any divine Logos at all&mdash;having, in fact,
  given up speculating on these matters. But if I were as sure on that point as
  your Epictetus is, and if I were a Christian to boot, I am not sure that I
  should have any great difficulty in believing that some one man might
  exist&mdash;might be 'sent into the world,' I suppose, a Christian would
  say&mdash;as different from ordinary possessors of the Logos as steam is from
  water&mdash;after all, steam is water&mdash;superior to Numa the Roman,
  superior to Lycurgus the Spartan, to Solon the Athenian, yes, superior to
  Moses the Hebrew.</p>

  <p>"You will be disposed to smile at my 'Moses,' as an anticlimax. But let me
  tell you that this Moses was a very great man. He was a genuine maker of a
  republic. I don't mention your friend's ideal, Diogenes, for I don't regard
  him as a maker of anything. I do not even mention my own favourite Socrates.
  He is not for the man in the street. He is a maker of thinkers. I am speaking
  of makers of men, and contemplating the possibility of a unique Maker, a
  Creator of an altogether new social condition. Well, then, suppose I believed
  in the Logos in heaven and the Logos on earth. Your philosophers would tell
  me to regard it as a divine flame lighting many human torches without self-
  diminution. Granted. Then I should believe that every man had his share of
  the Logos; some, a great share; others, a very great one. Why should I not
  contemplate the possibility of a unique and complete man, not 'sharing' but
  containing or being&mdash;a man that might be or contain the totality, or, as
  Paul says, the fullness, of the Logos? I see weak points in this
  torch-analogy except as an illustration of the belief; yet the belief itself
  does not appear to me against reason. But enough of this rambling! I have
  discerned of late many signs that I am growing old, and none more patent than
  this tendency to expatiate on my cast-off Christian explorations begun in the
  years when I was vigorous. I pass, and with great relief, to some things that
  are real possessions&mdash;I mean some portions of Matthew's and Luke's
  versions of Christ's discourses."</p>

  <p>For my part, it was not with unmixed "relief" that I turned to the next
  portion of Scaurus's letter. His conclusions about Christ's birth had merely
  accorded with my inferences from Paul's epistles; but he had shaken my faith
  in Matthew and Luke as trustworthy historians; and I looked forward with
  misgivings to his further criticism, which, I feared, might prove
  destructive. In this depression, I endeavoured to recall the words of Paul to
  the Corinthians about having a "treasure in earthen vessels." Mark certainly
  was an "earthen vessel." Matthew appeared likely to be no better, so far as I
  could judge from his story of Christ's birth and childhood. Luke, trying to
  reduce these legends to historic shape, did not seem to me to have succeeded,
  in spite of all his pains and sincerity. While I was unrolling the Corinthian
  epistle to refresh my memory, the thought occurred to me, "Is it possible
  that any God should choose such writers to set forth the life and character
  of Hip Son! How could the All-wise be guilty of such foolishness?" I had
  hardly uttered the word <i>"foolishness"</i> when my eyes fell on the words,
  "The <i>foolishness</i> of God is wiser than the wisdom of men." Then I
  became more modest. "God's ways," I said, "are not our ways. Perhaps He
  desires to force us to think and to feel for ourselves." I felt grateful even
  to Mark because he alone had preserved some of Christ's deep and difficult
  sayings. And in the end I recurred to the thought that had been of late
  growing stronger and stronger within me concerning the possible inferiority
  of Romans and Greeks to Jews in things of the spirit. "Thucydides," I said,
  "would have surpassed Isaiah in describing exactly the campaign of
  Sennacherib against Hezekiah. But in describing visions and judgments of the
  Lord, Isaiah is, perhaps, the man, and Thucydides the babe. I will continue
  my exploration, with Scaurus as a guide."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">XXV. &mdash; SCAURUS ON CHRIST'S DISCOURSES</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"MATTHEW and Luke," said Scaurus, "go even beyond Mark in
  the inculcation of a doctrine, beautiful after a fashion, but unjust, and
  impracticable. Mark says, 'Love thy neighbour as thyself.' Surely, that is as
  far as reason can let us go. I should say it is farther. But Matthew and Luke
  say, 'Love your enemies.' Now I can recall one passage where Epictetus says
  that the Cynic must love the men that thrash him, but I am sure that his
  general view is this, 'The man that treats me thus behaves like a beast, or
  like a mere scourge in the hand of Zeus, whose pleasure it is thus to try me.
  How can I hate a beast? Or how can I hate a scourge?'"</p>

  <p>Then, after reminding me how he had declared that Epictetus borrowed from
  the Christians, he said, "This, I think, is an instance. The Christian really
  loves the beast-like man because he believes the man to be made in the image
  of God and degraded by Satan. The Christian really pities him; he is troubled
  for the man's sake. Christ says 'Pray for him'; and the Christian honestly
  prays, 'This man is behaving like a beast. God help him!' The Epictetian does
  not recognise prayer or pity; he recognises his own peace of mind as God's
  supreme gift. 'This man,' he says, 'is behaving like a beast. But it is no
  evil to me. I must see that it does not interfere with my peace of mind. I
  must beware of pitying him.' Elsewhere Epictetus says that when you are
  reviled you are to make yourself a 'stone,' whereas Christ says, 'Bless them
  that curse you.' This exceptional sentence, then, in which Epictetus speaks
  about 'loving one's cudgellers' appears to me a case where our friend, while
  cutting away the Christian foundation, has tried to keep the Christian
  superstructure. Perhaps the view of Epictetus (at all events in word and in
  appearance) is somewhat selfish. But certainly the Christian precept is
  contrary to justice and common sense. One ought no more to love the wicked
  than to admire the ugly."</p>

  <p>This seemed at first convincing, or, at all events, overpowering. But he
  went on to connect it with the doctrine of forgiveness, which Matthew and
  Luke included in the Lord's Prayer. "This doctrine," said Scaurus, "I have
  mentioned above, as being in Mark, although he does not give the Lord's
  Prayer. It is, in fact, intended by Christ to be the very basis of his
  community. Now of course, Silanus, you and I and all reasonable people are
  agreed that we ought to be patient, and equable, and to condone faults to our
  equals, and not to lose our temper with our inferiors, if (as Epictetus says)
  a slave 'brings us vinegar instead of oil.' And a magnanimous man will put up
  with much greater offences than these, sometimes with injustice or fraud,
  sometimes even with insults, if he feels that his honour is not touched by
  them, or that society does not require a prosecution of the offence. But
  there is all the world of difference between this&mdash;which any gentleman
  would do, philosopher or no philosopher&mdash;and the extraordinary
  dishonesty&mdash;for I can call it by no other name&mdash;reduced to a system
  by the Christians, of 'letting people off' in the hope that God may 'let you
  off.' I do not want to be 'let off' by God. I should prefer to say (as
  Epictetus says to the tyrant) 'If it seem advisable, punish me.'"</p>

  <p>As soon as Scaurus used this argument, I perceived that he confused the
  remission of penalty with the forgiveness of sin, that power of "bearing the
  burdens" of others, and of "restoring" others, which, as I have shown above,
  Paul recognised as a fact and which Paul made me recognise as a fact, though
  a very mysterious fact. Hence, reasoning backward, I saw that this faculty of
  discerning the image of God in the most sinful of sinners, and of pitying the
  sinner, yes, and even of loving him, might belong to God Himself, and to men
  in so far as they are like God. If so, the existence of this power of loving
  one's enemies was a reality, just as the power of forgiving was a reality.
  "Scaurus himself," I said, "has and uses this power. He often sees good in
  people where most men would fail to see it. He likes those in whom others see
  nothing to like. I can conceive that a Son of God might not only possess but
  impart a power of this kind, increased to such a degree that it might be
  justly called a new power."</p>

  <p>"The curious thing," said Scaurus, "about this doctrine of loving and
  forgiving is this. Although it appears unpractical and paradoxical, yet the
  'kingdom' (to use the Christian word) based on this doctrine is, I must
  confess, not unpractical at all, but on the contrary a very solid and
  inconvenient fact in a great number of our largest cities and among the
  poorest and most squalid of the populace. Note the difference between the
  kingdom of the Christian and that of the Stoic. The Christian missionary
  cries aloud like a herald, 'Repent ye; the kingdom of God is at hand,' the
  Cynic says 'I am a king I or&mdash;to quote Epictetus exactly&mdash;'Which of
  you, having seen me, does not recognise in me his natural king and master?'
  The former prays, and teaches his proselytes to pray, looking up to a God in
  heaven, 'Thy kingdom come'; the latter neither prays nor enjoins prayer of
  any kind.</p>

  <p>"I suppose no Greek or Roman philosopher would apply the title of king to
  God quite as freely and naturally as Hebrew and Jewish writers do; for when
  we Romans say 'king,' we think of 'tyrant.' But apart from that (which is
  only a superficial difference of word) our philosophers have little or none
  of that expectation which underlies the words 'Thy kingdom come.' The
  Christians assert (supported by Matthew and Luke) that Christ himself taught
  them to pray thus. They anticipate a new kingdom&mdash;new family, if you
  prefer the term&mdash;where all the world will be brothers and sisters doing
  the will of the Father. When they pray 'Thy kingdom come,' they mean 'Thy
  will be done.' Indeed Matthew has inserted 'Thy will be done' in his version
  of the Lord's Prayer. Perhaps it was a paraphrase, which Luke has rejected
  because it was not a part of the original. But in any case, 'Thy will be
  done' is well adapted to make the meaning of 'kingdom' clear in the churches
  of the west. If a Christian philosopher were to write a gospel, I should not
  wonder if he were to go still further and drop the word 'kingdom' altogether,
  because it is calculated to give a false impression to all that are
  unacquainted with the Hebrew or Jewish method of speech." Scaurus was nearly
  right here. When I came to study the fourth gospel, I found that Jesus is
  represented as never using the word except in explanations to Nicodemus and
  Pilate.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Scaurus, "I do not deny that there are advantages in this
  scheme of a kingdom over the whole world, where the king is not a despot but
  a beneficent ruler to whom all may feel heartily and permanently loyal. <i>As
  compared with Christ</i>, such Epictetian 'kings' as Socrates, Diogenes, and
  Zeno, pass before us like solitary champions, fighting, so to speak, each for
  his own hand. Or we may liken them to torch-bearers, lighting up the darkness
  for a time but not succeeding in transmitting the torch to a successor. They
  depart. There is a momentary wake of light. It disappears. Then we have to
  wait for a new torch bearer, or a new champion; and the fighting, or the
  torch-waving, has to begin all over again. Take notice of my
  qualification&mdash;'as compared with Christ.' Even thus qualified, perhaps
  my remarks about Socrates are too strong. For assuredly his light has not
  gone out. But to tell the truth, resuming my study of these half-forgotten
  gospels in the light of Paul's epistles, I find myself sometimes admiring
  rather to excess that visionary letter-writer and practical church-builder.
  Our philosophers do not consolidate a kingdom. The Christians do. I am
  impressed by what Paul calls somewhere their 'solid phalanx.' There is
  something about it that I cannot quite fathom."</p>

  <p>I too was impressed by Scaurus's confession that he had somewhat changed
  his mind about the gospels in consequence of Paul's epistles. It seemed to me
  to explain some inconsistencies in his letters. Also I noted that Paul's
  phrase was "the solid phalanx <i>of your faith</i>" and that perhaps
  <i>"faith"</i> explained <i>"phalanx".</i> Scaurus now passed to the doctrine
  of New Birth. "I call it thus," said he, "for brevity. Mark expresses it
  ambiguously, saying that no man can enter into the kingdom unless he receives
  it 'as a little child.' Now this might mean 'as he receives a little child.'
  And this interpretation is rather favoured by the fact that, somewhat
  earlier, Mark has a doctrine about 'receiving one of such little children.' I
  suspect some mystical doctrine is concealed in Mark. But Matthew has, 'unless
  ye turn and become as little children.' There is no mistaking that. Now I
  say, in the first place, this is impossible; in the second place, it is
  wrong. First, it is impossible. The Father of heaven, says Horace, may send
  fair weather to-day and foul tomorrow. But not even He&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">&mdash;diffinget infectumque reddet<br>
  Quod fugiens simul hora vexit.'</p>

  <p>You must agree with me. Jupiter cannot cause what has been done to have
  been not done. In the next place, it is wrong. A full-grown man has no right
  to divest himself of full-grown faculties. How much better is the doctrine of
  Epictetus, 'My friend, you have fallen down. Get up. Try again.' This is
  possible. This is encouraging. But tell the same man, ' Become a little
  child,' 'Be born again' I He will think you are playing the fool with
  him."</p>

  <p>I wondered why Scaurus did not see that here again he was inconsistent. He
  had forgotten the admissions he had made in view of Paul's epistles. In the
  cities of Asia and Greece, some of the vilest among the vile had been told by
  Paul, "You must become new creatures in Christ," "You must die to sin and
  rise again to righteousness." They did not "think he was playing the fool."
  They had (as Scaurus confessed) been morally "born again." Moreover Paul had
  met his objection as to "full-grown faculties" by saying, "Be ye babes in
  respect of malice, but in understanding be full-grown men." Still I was sorry
  that the gospels had expressed this obscurely. Neither of us had as yet read
  the fourth gospel. That makes the doctrine quite clear by showing that what
  is needed is not to be "born over again"&mdash;for one might be "born over
  again" ten times worse than one was before&mdash;but to be "born <i>from
  above.</i>" This was quite different from "causing what has been done to have
  been not done." It meant "created anew," or "reshaped" so that the Spirit of
  Christ, within the Christian, dominated the flesh. Both here and elsewhere,
  Scaurus's criticisms would have been very different, if he had known the
  fourth gospel.</p>

  <p>"The next point to be considered," said Scaurus, "is the laws for the new
  kingdom. Matthew has grouped together a collection of precepts as a code.
  Some of these contrast what 'has been said,' or 'has been said to men of
  old,' with what Christ now says. Apparently Matthew intended this code of
  laws (uttered, he says, on a 'mountain') to correspond to the code
  promulgated on Mount Sinai. But Luke (who by the way omits the 'mountain' and
  makes the scene 'a place on the plain') while giving many of these precepts,
  scatters them about his gospel specifying various occasions on which several
  of them were uttered; and he never inserts the contrasting clause
  above-mentioned. The conclusion I draw is, that Christ promulgated no law at
  all. Law deals almost exclusively with actions. Christ dealt almost
  exclusively with motives, as the last of the Ten Commandments does. When
  Christ inculcates actions, they are often metaphorical or hyperbolical, as
  when he says, 'If you are struck on one cheek, turn the other to the
  striker,' 'Let not your right hand know what your left hand does,' 'If a man
  takes your cloak, give him your coat too,' and, 'If anyone wants to make you
  go a mile with him, go two miles,'&mdash;to which last precept, by the way,
  Epictetus would say. No."</p>

  <p>I think Scaurus was referring to a passage where Epictetus said,
  "Diogenes, if you seized any possession of his, would sooner give it up to
  you than follow you on account of it." Scaurus went on to say, "Matthew's
  habit of grouping sentences makes it difficult to distinguish sayings uttered
  before the resurrection from those uttered after it. For example, he speaks
  of a power of 'binding and loosing' given to Peter, in connexion with a
  mention of the 'church.' On another occasion, a similar power is given to the
  other disciples, again in connexion with the 'church.' Now this 'binding and
  loosing' is not mentioned by any other evangelist. What does it mean? And
  when was this saying uttered?</p>

  <p>"My rabbi tells me that 'binding and loosing' is regularly used by the
  Jews to indicate that a rabbi 'forbids' or 'sanctions' a certain
  action&mdash;for example, the eating of a particular food. Thus in the Acts
  of the Apostles, the Lord would be said by the Jews to 'loose' the eating of
  food that was before unclean, saying to Peter, 'Arise, kill and eat.' And I
  can conceive that a gospel might describe Jesus as saying to Peter, 'I give
  thee this power of loosing unclean food, that thou and the rest of my
  disciples may henceforth eat with the Gentiles, and in their houses, asking
  no questions concerning the food.' But I do not myself believe that Christ
  used the phrase 'bind and loose 'in this sense. I think he connected it with
  that strange doctrine of forgiveness of sins on which he laid so much stress,
  and that it was uttered after the resurrection, when the term 'church' might
  be more naturally used." Scaurus was so far right in this that I afterwards
  found in the fourth gospel a doctrine, not indeed about "binding and
  loosing," but about "imprisoning and loosing" or "arresting and loosing"; and
  this was connected with "sins," and Christ gave this power to the disciples
  after the resurrection.</p>

  <p>Scaurus continued, "Look at Matthew's words in one of these passages, 'But
  if he refuse to hear the church, let him be unto thee as the heathen and the
  publican,' and then, at some interval, 'Where two or three are gathered
  together in my name, I am there in the midst of them.' Then look at the last
  words of Matthew's gospel, uttered after the resurrection, 'Behold I am with
  you always.' Does not the saying, 'I am there in the midst of you when you
  are gathered together,' come more appropriately from Christ, appearing after
  the resurrection, than from Christ before the resurrection? I think so. The
  context indicates a tradition of some utterance made after the resurrection,
  conveyed through some apostle in a Jewish form, promising Christ's presence
  to the disciples. Paul assumes such a presence, writing to the Corinthians
  'When ye are gathered together, and my spirit, together with the power of the
  Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver over such a one to Satan.' These last words
  about 'Satan' I do not profess to comprehend fully but they seem to me to
  imply the opposite of 'loosing'&mdash;some kind of 'binding' or 'remanding to
  prison.' And it is to take place in the presence of Christ, with Paul's
  spirit, when the church of Corinth is 'gathered together'."</p>

  <p>I thought Scaurus was probably right as to the date of this promise. But I
  was much more impressed by what he said concerning the tradition, in Luke,
  <i>"Eat those things that are served up to you."</i> This, in Luke, was
  almost meaningless to me, but it had been full of meaning in Paul's epistle
  to the Corinthians, where the apostle spoke about meat sold in Gentile
  markets: "If an unbeliever invites you, and ye desire to accept, <i>eat
  everything that is served up to you, asking no questions</i>"</p>

  <p>Scaurus said, "This tradition about <i>'eating what is served up'</i>
  occurs nowhere in the gospels except in Luke's account of the sending of the
  Seventy, beginning, 'After these things the Lord appointed other seventy.'
  Now this word <i>'appoint'</i> does not in the least necessitate the
  conclusion that Christ appointed the. Seventy before the resurrection. Look
  at the <i>'appointment'</i> of the thirteenth apostle in the place of Judas.
  The Acts says 'Lord, appoint him whom thou hast chosen.' Then Matthias is
  <i>'appointed,'</i> The Lord is supposed to <i>'appoint'</i> him in answer to
  the prayer. Concerning this, Luke might say, <i>'After these things the Lord
  appointed Matthias.'</i> If these words had been inserted in the gospel, they
  would have given the false impression that Jesus, while living, had appointed
  Matthias. Well, that is just the impression&mdash;a false one&mdash;that Luke
  gives as to the <i>'appointment'</i> of the Seventy. The fact is that the
  Seventy (a number often used by the Jews to denote all the nations or
  languages of the world) represent the missionaries <i>'appointed' after the
  Lord's death to go to the cities of the Gentiles to prepare them for the
  Coming of the Lord from heaven.</i> These were to go into the houses of
  Gentiles. Though Jews, they were to eat of Gentile food&mdash;<i>'everything
  that is served up.'</i> Without this explanation, the tradition has no
  meaning&mdash;or, if any, an unworthy one, 'Do not be fastidious. If you
  cannot have pleasant food, eat unpleasant food.' This seems to me absurd. But
  with this explanation, the precept becomes intelligible and necessary."</p>

  <p>This convinced me. Moreover Luke's use of "the Lord," for "Jesus
  "&mdash;since "the Lord" would be more likely to be used than "Jesus" after
  the resurrection&mdash;seemed slightly to favour Scaurus's conclusion. He
  passed next to a tradition of Matthew's about abstinence from marriage "for
  the sake of the kingdom of heaven." On this he said, " Looking at Paul's
  advice to the Corinthians about celibacy and marriage, and at the distinction
  he draws between 'advice,' and 'allowance' and 'command,' and 'not I but the
  Lord,' I am convinced that Paul spoke on his own responsibility, except as to
  Christ's insistence on the old tradition in Genesis, 'The two shall be one
  flesh.' I mean that Christ upheld monogamy against polygamy and against that
  modified form of polygamy which -arose from the husband's unrestricted, or
  scarcely restricted, right of divorce. Soon after the resurrection, in the
  midst of persecutions, when the Christians expected that Christ might
  speedily return and carry them up to heaven, it was natural that the
  Corinthians should apply for advice to Paul, and other churches to other
  apostles.</p>

  <p>"My belief is that Christ's words extended to only the first half of
  Matthew's tradition. The disciples complain, in effect, 'If a man cannot
  divorce his wife when he dislikes her, it is best not to marry.' To this
  Christ replies, as I interpret him, 'Not all grasp the mystery of the true
  marriage contemplated from the beginning (namely, "the two shall become one")
  but only those to whom it is given.' This seems to me to have been explained
  in a wrong sense in the words that follow about 'eunuchs.' At all events,
  Paul twice quotes the words quoted by Christ (about the 'two' becoming 'one')
  as though they were the basis of his doctrine about marriage and also a type
  of the mysterious wedlock between Christ and the church. I do not think,
  however, that any confident conclusion is deducible. Christ elsewhere
  indicates&mdash;when dealing with an imaginary case where a woman has married
  seven brothers consecutively&mdash;that the marriage tie does not extend to
  the next life. By the Jews, marriage is, and was, regarded as honourable, and
  almost as a duty. But a Jewish sect called the Essenes, or some of them,
  practised celibacy; and you know how Epictetus inculcates celibacy on his
  Cynics of the first class. These facts, and the pressure of hard times, and
  Paul's example, may not only have favoured abstinence from marriage among
  Christians but also have favoured some tampering with tradition in order to
  enjoin celibacy. A letter to Timothy speaks of certain heretics as
  'forbidding to marry.' Perhaps the only safe conclusion about Matthew's
  tradition is that no conclusion can be deduced from it."</p>

  <p>Scaurus next discussed the question whether Christ inculcated poverty on
  his disciples. He denied it. Not that he denied Luke to be more correct
  verbally in saying "Blessed are <i>the poor</i>" than Matthew in "Blessed are
  the <i>poor in spirit.</i>" But he asserted that Christ meant <i>"poor in
  spirit."</i> Similarly (said Scaurus) Christ meant "hungering <i>after
  righteousness</i>," as Matthew says, though Luke was right verbally in
  omitting "after righteousness." For, according to Scaurus, "Christ hardly
  ever used such words as 'bread,' 'leaven,' 'water,' 'hunger,' 'thirst,' '
  fire,' 'salt,' 'treasure,' and so on, except metaphorically." Then he quoted
  the following instance out of Mark's version of Christ's instructions to the
  twelve apostles, where, he said, Mark's metaphors had been misunderstood
  literally&mdash;and consequently altered&mdash;by Matthew and Luke.</p>

  <p>"Mark," said he, "has, 'that they should take nothing for the journey,
  <i>save a staff only</i>, no bread, no wallet, no money for the purse.'
  Matthew and Luke have <i>'no staff.'</i> Now turn to Genesis, where Jacob
  thanks God for helping him on his journey, 'I passed over Jordan with <i>my
  staff</i>,' He <i>means</i>, 'with <i>my staff only</i>.' Philo explains this
  <i>'staff'</i> metaphorically, as 'training,' <i>i.e.</i> the instruction or
  guidance given by God. David says to God, 'Thy rod and thy staff are my
  help,' or words to that effect&mdash;manifest metaphor. My rabbi showed me a
  Jewish paraphrase of Jacob's words, 'I had neither gold, nor silver, nor
  herds, <i>but simply my staff</i>.' He also told me that this 'staff' was
  supposed by the Jews to have been given by God to Adam from whom it descended
  to the patriarchs in succession. This shows that Jews might find no
  difficulty in Christ's metaphor, 'Go forth with nothing but a staff!
  <i>i.e.</i> the staff of Jacob, the rod and staff of God. But Greeks and
  Romans would naturally take the word literally as meaning 'walking-stick.'
  Then they would find a difficulty, asking, 'Why should Jesus say, <i>No
  bread, no wallet&mdash; only a walking-stick</i>?' Hence many, writing
  largely for Gentiles, might alter it into <i>'no walking-stick.'</i> This is
  what Matthew and Luke have done. Similarly they altered Mark's metaphor
  <i>'but shod with sandals,' i.e.</i> with light shoes fit for the 'beautiful
  feet' of the preachers of the gospel, into <i>'no boots'</i> or words to that
  effect. The error is the same. Jewish metaphor has been in each case taken
  literally by Matthew and Luke."</p>

  <p>Scaurus added a few remarks on Christ as a historical character, "dimly
  traceable," he said, "in the combined testimony of Mark, Matthew, and
  Luke"&mdash;where I thought he might have added, "and in the epistles of
  Paul." His main thought was that, in spite of all the defects of these three
  writers, it was possible to discern in Christ a successor of Moses and
  Isaiah. "This man," said Scaurus, "may be regarded in two aspects. As a
  lawgiver, he took as the basis of his republic a re-enactment, in a stronger
  form, of the two ancient laws that enjoined love of the Father and love of
  the brethren. As a prophet, he saw a time when all mankind&mdash;recognising
  in one another (man in man and nation in nation) some glimpse of the divine
  image, and of the beauty of divine holiness&mdash;would beat their swords
  into ploughshares, and go up to the City of peace, righteousness, and truth,
  to worship the Father of the spirits of all flesh. Isaiah had foreseen this.
  But this prophet was also possessed with a belief, beyond Isaiah's, in the
  unity of God and man. He was persuaded that the true Son of man was the Son
  of God, higher than the heavens. I think also that he trusted&mdash;but on
  what grounds I do not know, unless it was an ingrained prophetic belief,
  found in all the great prophets, carried to its highest point in this
  prophet&mdash;that, as light follows on darkness, so does joy on sorrow,
  righteousness on sin, and life on death. A Stoic would say that these things
  alternate and that all things go round. But this Jewish prophet believed that
  all things in the end would go up&mdash;up to heaven. That is how I read his
  expectation. Feeling himself to be one with God, he placed no limits, except
  God's will, to the mighty works that God might do for him in his attempt to
  fulfil God's purpose of exalting men from darkness to light and from death to
  life.</p>

  <p>"It is in some of these mysterious aspirations," said Scaurus, "that I
  cannot follow this prophet of the Jews. At times he seems to me to act and
  speak (certainly Paul speaks thus) as though God had caused mankind to take
  (if I may say so) one disease in order to get rid of another. I am speaking
  of moral disease. God seems to Paul to have allowed man to contract the
  disease of sin in order to rise to a health of righteousness, higher than
  would have been possible if he had not sinned. On these and other mystical
  notions this Jewish prophet may perhaps base views of forgiveness, and of
  love, and of the effIcacy of his own death for his disciples, all of which
  perplex me. Sometimes I reject them entirely. Sometimes I am in doubt." These
  last words of Scaurus seemed to me to explain many inconsistencies in his
  letters. But how could I be surprised? Was I consistent myself? Was not my
  own mind at that instant fluctuating like a very Euripus? I could understand
  his doubts only too well.</p>

  <p>He concluded by contrasting Christ with John the Baptist. "The one point,"
  said Scaurus, "in which these two prophets or reformers agreed, was that the
  Lord God would intervene for the people, if only the people would return to
  Him. But in other respects they appear to me to have altogether differed.
  John the Baptist seems to have desired to bring about a remission of debts in
  accordance with the Law of Moses, as insisted on by previous prophets. He
  also desired an equalisation of property. That is what I gather from the
  gospels themselves, interpreted in the light of the ancient Law of the Jews.
  Moreover Josephus told me that Herod the tetrarch put John to death on
  political grounds, because he seemed likely to stir up the people to
  sedition, nor did he ever mention the influence of Herodias as contributing
  to the prophet's execution. Of course the story about the dancing and the
  oath may be true, and yet the oath may have been a mere excuse for getting
  rid of an inconvenient person. John was not unwilling (as I gather) to resort
  to the sword of Gideon or the fire of Elijah if the word of the gospel did
  not suffice to establish the new kingdom.</p>

  <p>"Jesus, on the other hand, was absolutely averse to violence. Jesus was
  penetrated with the belief in the power of 'little ones' and 'babes' and
  'sucklings.' How far he anticipated the future in store for himself I cannot
  say. Sometimes I am inclined to believe that he thought God would intervene
  at the last moment and deliver him from the jaws of death. Sometimes he seems
  to have deliberately faced death with the conviction that he would be
  swallowed up by it for a short time, emerging from it to victory.</p>

  <p>"The Baptist certainly expected to be delivered by Jesus from the prison
  in which he was being kept by Antipas, and to have been disappointed by his
  friend's inaction. It must have been a very bitter moment for the latter when
  John sent to reproach him, as good as saying, 'Are you, too, a false Messiah?
  Will you leave me to perish in prison? Are you really our Deliverer, or must
  we, the whole nation, turn from you as a laggard, and wait for another?' In
  my opinion, this was the very greatest temptation to which Jesus was exposed.
  In that moment&mdash;as I judge when I try to guess the eastern metaphor
  corresponding to western fact&mdash;Jews would say that Satan said to Christ
  'Worship me, and I will give you the empire of the world,' or 'Take the risk!
  Throw yourself down from the pinnacle! See whether God will save you!' In
  plain words, the temptation was, 'Appeal to the God of battles I Rouse the
  people to arms, first against Antipas, and then against the Romans!' For a
  perfectly unselfish and noble nature, believing in divine interventions, this
  must indeed have been a great, a very great temptation."</p>

  <p>Scaurus finished this part of his letter by quoting a passage that I had
  long had in mind, but I had forgotten its context, "Do you remember, Silanus,
  how the old Egyptian priest says in the Timaeus, 'Solon, Solon, you Greeks
  are always boys'? Then comes the reason, <i>'You have not in your souls any
  ancient belief based on tradition from the days of old.'</i> Well, we Romans
  are in the same position as the poor Greeks. So are the Egyptians for the
  matter of that. For it is not antiquity alone, but <i>divine</i> antiquity,
  that counts. None of us have this divine antiquity of 'tradition from the
  days of old' going back to such characters as Abraham, Moses, and the
  prophets. I think we must put up with our inferiority. These things we had
  better leave to others. We have, as Virgil says, 'arts' of our own, the arts
  of war and empire. There, we are men, full-grown men. But as compared with
  Moses, Isaiah, and above all with this Jesus, or Christ, I must frankly
  confess I sometimes feel myself a 'boy,' and never so much as now. My
  conclusion is, <i>I will keep to the things in which I am not a 'boy.'</i> Do
  you the same."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">XXVI. &mdash; SCAURUS ON CHRIST'S RESURRECTION (I)</a></h2>

  <p class="first">PASSING next to the subject of Christ's resurrection, "To
  deal first," said Scaurus, "with Christ's alleged predictions that he would
  'rise again,' what strikes me as the strangest point in them is his frequent
  mention of being <i>'betrayed.'</i> For the rest, if Jesus believed himself
  to be the Messiah or Christ&mdash;as I think he did, if not at first, yet
  soon&mdash;or even if he did not believe himself to be the Christ, but
  thought that he was to reform the nation, I can well understand that he
  adopted the language of one of their prophets, Hosea by name, who says, 'Come
  and let us return unto the Lord... he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
  After two days will he revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and
  we shall live in his sight.' Using such language as this, a later Jewish
  prophet, such as Christ, might lead his followers up to Jerusalem at the
  Passover, not knowing whether he should live or die, but convinced that the
  Lord would work some deliverance for Israel. And the predictions of
  'scourging,' and 'smiting,' and 'spitting,' I could also understand, as
  coming from the prophets. But 'betrayal' is not mentioned by the prophets,
  and I cannot understand its insertion here."</p>

  <p>With this I have dealt above, and with the double sense of the word
  meaning "deliver over" and "betray." I now found that the evangelists
  sometimes apply the word to the act of Judas the betrayer (because by his
  betrayal Christ was "delivered over" to the Jews); and Scaurus regarded it as
  meaning "betray" here. I could not however believe that Jesus, when
  predicting His death, used the word in the sense <i>"betray."</i></p>

  <p>It seemed to me that He predicted that His end would be like that of the
  Suffering Servant in Isaiah, namely, that He would be <i>"delivered over"</i>
  as a ransom for the sins of the people by the will of His Father. Long
  afterwards, I found that, whereas the Greek in Isaiah has <i>"delivered over
  for"</i> the Hebrew has <i>"make intercession for."</i> Then I saw, even more
  clearly than before, the reason why Christ may have often repeated this
  prediction, if He foresaw that His death would "make intercession" for the
  people. The evangelists rendered this so that it might be mistaken for "would
  be betrayed." But Paul made the matter clear.</p>

  <p>Scaurus added that the rising again was predicted as about to occur,
  sometimes "on the third day," as in Hosea, but sometimes "after three days,"
  corresponding to a period of three days and three nights spent by Jonah
  (according to a strange Hebrew legend) in a whale's belly. And he also said,
  "Mark and Matthew represent Jesus as saying, concerning what he would do
  after death, 'I will go before you to <i>Galilee</i>' But Luke omits these
  words. Later on, after the resurrection, Mark and Matthew again mention this
  prediction; but there Luke has 'remember that which he said to you <i>while
  yet in Galilee,</i>' My rabbi tells me that the words 'to Galilee' might
  easily be confused with other expressions having quite a different meaning.
  This seems to me probable, but into these details I cannot now enter. I take
  it, however, that Luke knew Mark's tradition <i>'to Galilee'</i> and rejected
  it as erroneous. Matthew also says that certain women, meeting Jesus after
  death, 'took hold of his feet,' and Jesus sent word by them to the disciples
  to 'depart <i>into Galilee</i>.' Here you see <i>'Galilee'</i> again. But
  this tradition is not in any other gospel. Luke makes no mention of any
  appearance in <i>Galilee</i>."</p>

  <p>These discrepancies about "Galilee" might have interested me at any other
  time; but <i>"took hold of his feet"</i>&mdash;this was the assertion that
  amazed me and carried away my thoughts from everything else. I had approached
  the subject of the Resurrection through Paul, who mentions Christ merely as
  having "appeared" to several of the apostles and last of all to himself. I
  had all along assumed that the "appearances" of the Lord to the other
  apostles had been of the same kind as the appearance to Paul, that is to say,
  supernatural, but not material nor tangible. Having read what Paul said about
  the spiritual body and the earthly body, I had supposed that Christ's earthly
  body remained in the tomb but that His spiritual body rose from the dead,
  passed out of the tomb&mdash;as a spirit might pass, not being confinable by
  walls or gates or by the cavernous sides of a tomb&mdash;and "appeared" to
  the disciples, now in this place, now in that. That the "spiritual body"
  meant the <i>real spiritual "person"</i>&mdash;and not a mere "shade" or
  breath-like "spirit" of the departed&mdash;this (as I have explained above) I
  had more or less understood. But I had never supposed that the "body" could
  be touched. And now, quite unexpectedly, Scaurus thrust before me, so to
  speak, a tradition that some women <i>"took hold of Christ's feet"</i> after
  He had risen from the dead.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Scaurus, "most critics would say at once that the women
  lied. But in the first place, even if they did lie, that would not explain
  why Mark and Luke omitted it. For you may be quite sure the evangelists would
  not believe that the women told a lie; and, if they believed that the women
  told the truth, why should they not report it? For the fact, if a fact, is a
  strong proof of resurrection. In the next place, I am convinced that the
  Christian belief in Christ's resurrection is far too strong to have been
  originated by lies. I believe it was originated by visions, and that the
  stories about these visions were exaggerated in various ways, but never
  dishonest ways. In this particular case, the explanation probably is, that
  the women saw a vision of Christ in the air and '<i>would have held</i> it
  fast by the feet,' that is, <i>desired to do so, but could not.</i> I could
  give several instances from the LXX where <i>'would have'</i> is thus dropped
  in translation. The belief of the Christians was, that Christ ascended to
  heaven. The women are perhaps regarded as <i>desiring to grasp his feet while
  he was ascending</i>, but Christ prevents them, sending them away to carry
  word to his <i>'brethren'</i>&mdash;for so he calls them&mdash;of his
  resurrection." I had not, at the time, knowledge enough to judge of Scaurus's
  explanation; but I afterwards found that <i>"would have"</i> might be thus
  dropped, and that the fourth gospel represents a woman as attempting, or
  desiring, to "touch" Jesus, but as being prevented (by the words "touch me
  not") because He had <i>"not yet ascended"</i>; and Jesus says to her
  "<i>Carry word to my brethren."</i> Scaurus's explanation was confirmed by
  these facts.</p>

  <p>Scaurus continued as follows, "Mark, the earliest of the evangelists,
  contains no account of the resurrection, except as an announcement made by
  angels. He says that the women "were afraid" when they heard this
  announcement; and there he ends. But in my copy of Mark there is an appendix
  (not in the handwriting of the same scribe that wrote the gospel) which
  begins, 'Now having arisen on the first day of the week he became visible at
  first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven devils.' Then it says
  that Jesus 'was manifested in a different form' to two of his previous
  companions, when walking in the country. Then it mentions a third and last
  manifestation to 'the eleven' seated at a meal." I turned at once to my copy
  of Mark, but there was no such appendix. It ended with the words "for they
  were afraid."</p>

  <p>Scaurus proceeded, "This appendix is not at all in Mark's style, but it is
  probably very ancient. Luke mentions no appearance of Christ to women. But he
  describes an appearance to two disciples walking toward a village near
  Jerusalem; or rather, not to them while walking, for Jesus did not appear to
  them at first so as to be recognised; he first walked and talked with them
  and 'opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.' Then, in the village,
  during the breaking of bread, he was recognised by them, and vanished. As
  regards 'walking,' I may mention that the ancient Jews describe God as
  <i>'walking with Israel,'</i> and I have read in a Christian letter, <i>'The
  Lord journeyed with me,'</i> meaning 'enlightened me.' So the word may be
  used metaphorically. These two disciples expressly mention a 'vision of
  angels' spoken of by the women, who told them that angels had announced that
  Christ had risen from the dead; but, according to Luke, the two disciples and
  their companions disbelieved the women's tale. And not a word is said by
  Luke, then or afterwards, about any appearance of Christ himself to
  women.</p>

  <p>"You can see for yourself, Silanus, under what a disadvantage this
  Mark-Appendix placed these poor, simple, ignorant, honest Christians, when it
  called as their first witness to the resurrection a woman that had been
  formerly a lunatic. I believe they have been already attacked by their Jewish
  enemies on this ground. If they have not been, I am sure they will be. Luke,
  a physician and an educated man, chooses his ground much more sensibly.
  First, he omits all direct mention, in his own narrative, of manifestations
  to women. Secondly, he says, in effect&mdash;not in narrative but in
  dialogue&mdash;'The women <i>did</i> see an apparition, but it was only of
  angels.' Thirdly, 'the <i>men</i>, (and men are not liable to the hysterical
  delusions of women)&mdash;the <i>men</i>,' he says, 'treated the women's
  vision as a mere delusion. The men saw Jesus himself.' Possibly Luke was
  influenced by Paul, who in his list of the witnesses of manifestations makes
  no mention of women. The Law of Moses does not expressly exclude women's
  testimony. But Josephus once told me that his countrymen allowed neither
  women nor slaves to give public testimony. So it is clear that Jewish
  tradition has interpreted the Law as excluding women, and that Paul, when
  controverting Jews, would not appeal to the evidence of women, because Jews
  would not accept it. Perhaps Luke followed in the same path.</p>

  <p>"Luke also makes the following attempt to meet the objections of those who
  might urge that Christ's apparition was not a rising of the actual body from
  the grave. He represents Christ as saying to the disciples, 'Handle me
  '&mdash;as a proof that he was not a disembodied spirit. Now I do not believe
  that Luke invented this, although he, the latest of the three evangelists, is
  alone in recording it. Curiously enough, I have only recently been reading a
  letter&mdash;very wild and extravagant but manifestly genuine&mdash;written
  some four or five years ago by a Christian named Ignatius, which throws light
  on these very words in Luke. A few months after writing it, the man suffered
  as a Christian here in Rome, and his letters naturally had a vogue. Flaccus
  sent me a copy as a curiosity. Well, this letter says that when Christ came
  to his disciples&mdash;Ignatius says <i>'to those around Peter'</i> but the
  meaning is 'to Peter and his companions' that is, 'to Christ's disciples.' as
  I have explained above&mdash;in the flesh, after his resurrection, he said to
  them, 'Take, handle me, and see that I am not a bodiless daemon.' Then
  Ignatius adds&mdash;and these are the words I want you to
  mark&mdash;'Straightway they <i>touched</i> him and believed, having been
  <i>mixed with his flesh and blood.</i>'</p>

  <p>"Do you remember my laughing at you as a boy because you translated
  Diodorus Siculus literally, 'They <i>touched</i> one another because of
  extreme need,' when it ought to have been, 'They <i>fed</i> on one another'?
  I quoted to you, at the time, the saying of Pythagoras, 'Do not <i>touch</i>
  a white cock,' <i>i.e.</i> 'do not <i>feed on</i> it.' There are many
  instances of this meaning. Well, the Christians believed that they <i>fed
  on</i> Christ. His <i>'flesh and blood was mixed' with theirs</i>&mdash;or
  they were <i>'mixed'</i> with his&mdash;when they fed on him in their sacred
  meal. If there were some Greek traditions saying 'they touched him,' meaning
  'they <i>fed</i> on him,' there would naturally be other traditions about
  <i>'touching'</i> Jesus meaning that they <i>'handled'</i> him. The latter
  would suggest that they touched the wounds in his body inflicted during the
  crucifixion."</p>

  <p>I remembered my boyish mistake, and I saw clearly that Christians would
  have had much more excuse for making a similar one. Scaurus added, "This also
  explains Ignatius's curious use of 'take' (as in Mark and Matthew)." At first
  I could not understand what Scaurus meant; but on looking at Ignatius's
  Greek, which Scaurus gave me, I perceived that the words were not <i>"Take
  hold of me, handle me,"</i> but <i>"Take"</i>, <i>i.e. "Take me,"</i> or
  "<i>Take</i> my body (as a whole)." Now <i>"take"</i> is similarly used by
  Mark and Matthew in the sentence "<i>Take</i>, eat, this is my body," where
  Mark omits "eat."</p>

  <p>"Moreover," continued Scaurus, "Luke goes on to relate that Jesus said to
  the disciples, 'Have ye anything to eat?' and that they <i>gave him</i> some
  broiled fish, and that he ate in their presence. Christians in Rome have been
  in the habit&mdash;it would take too long to explain why&mdash;of using FISH
  as the emblem of Christ. The sense requires <i>'he gave,'</i> not <i>'they
  gave.'</i> I think Luke has confused <i>'he gave'</i> with <i>'they gave'</i>
  The confusion, in Greek, might arise from one erroneous letter."</p>

  <p>After giving me several instances of such confusion, he said, "I should
  not be surprised if some later gospel stated the fact more correctly, namely,
  that <i>Christ gave</i> the disciples 'fish'." This I afterwards found to be
  the case in the fourth gospel.</p>

  <p>Scaurus then proceeded, "I think, however, that Luke's error may have
  arisen in part from another tradition, which he has preserved in the
  Acts&mdash;somewhat like that of the Christian Ignatius which I have quoted
  above. Ignatius spoke of <i>'mixing;'</i> Luke, in the Acts, speaks of
  <i>'incorporating'</i>&mdash;I can think of no better word to give the
  meaning &mdash;saying that Jesus, <i>'in the act of being incorporated
  with'</i> the disciples, bade them not to depart from Jerusalem till they had
  received the Holy Spirit. Now this word <i>'incorporate'</i>&mdash;which is
  used of men brought into a city, hounds into a pack, soldiers into a
  squadron, and so on&mdash;is adapted to represent that close union which is a
  mark of almost all the Christians, who say with Paul that they are 'one body
  in Christ' and 'members one of another.' But this compact union of Christians
  is also represented by their Eucharist, so that Paul says to the Corinthians,
  in effect, not only, 'Ye are one body,' but also 'Ye are one loaf.' And I
  rather think that some Christians at the present time, in their Eucharists,
  pray that, as the grains of wheat scattered in the field are made into one,
  so the scattered children of God may be gathered into one. I think you must
  see how easily errors might spring up from metaphors of this kind used in the
  various churches of the empire, among people varying in language, customs,
  and traditions, and for the most part illiterate.</p>

  <p>"Even in the letter of Ignatius above-mentioned, a scribe has altered the
  word 'mixed' into 'constrained' in the margin; and I am not surprised. I do
  not by any means accuse Luke of dishonesty, nor of carelessness. He did his
  best. But he was probably a physician&mdash;a man of science
  therefore&mdash;and liked to have things definitely and scientifically
  stated. This word above-mentioned, 'being made into one compact body with
  them,' might easily be supposed to mean 'partaking of salt with them,' that
  is, 'sharing a meal with them.' That rendering had the advantage of
  constituting a definite proof of Christ's resurrection with a body that might
  be called in some sense material, since it (i.e. the body) was capable of
  eating. Then, of course, Luke would adapt his other accounts of the
  resurrection to this tradition, which he would naturally regard as one of
  central importance. But, though honest and pains-taking, Luke appears to me
  to have altered and corrupted what was perhaps, in some sense, a
  real&mdash;yes, I will admit, in some sense, a real&mdash;manifestation (if
  indeed any visions are real) into a mere non- existent physical sign or
  proof.</p>

  <p>"Luke represents Jesus as feeding on his own body in order to satisfy his
  unbelieving disciples that he is really among them. I can easily imagine how
  very different may have been the feelings of those simple enthusiasts, the
  early Galilaean disciples, when they used these words&mdash;never dreaming
  that they would be reduced to dry, evidential prose&mdash;in psalms and hymns
  and spiritual songs, praising the Lord for allowing them to 'sit at His
  table,' and to 'eat and drink with Him,' or for making them 'sharers in the
  sacred food of His body' and 'partners of His board.' It was only, after a
  generation or more had passed away, outside the atmosphere of
  Galilee&mdash;it was only to a compiler laboriously tracing back the truth
  through documents&mdash;that all these phrases would suggest the thought of
  Jesus proving his reality by partaking of food that his disciples give to
  him.</p>

  <p>"It may be said, as though it were to Luke's discredit, 'He represents
  Peter as positively testifying to this eating.' Of course he does. You know
  how speeches are written, even in the most accurate histories. No historian,
  as a rule, professes to record a speech of any length exactly. If Luke first
  inferred that Christ ate with the apostles after his death, he would also
  naturally go on to infer that Peter, in attesting Christ's resurrection, must
  necessarily have included some mention of this fact. I cannot blame him. I
  think he was perfectly honest, though in error." I agreed. But it seemed to
  me an error much to be regretted.</p>

  <p>On one point, however, Scaurus seemed to me to be not quite accurate, when
  he said of Luke, "He represents Peter as positively testifying to this
  eating." For Peter's speech was to this effect, "God raised him up on the
  third day and granted that he should be manifested&mdash;not to all the
  people but to witnesses previously appointed by God, namely us, who ate with
  him and drank with him&mdash;after he had risen from the dead." Scaurus
  regarded this as meaning that "the eating and drinking" of Christ's disciples
  took place "after his death." Even if that had been so, it might be that
  Jesus was merely present (not eating and drinking) when the disciples ate and
  drank: and something of this kind I afterwards found in the fourth gospel.
  But I punctuated the words differently, and interpreted them differently, as
  meaning that the <i>"manifestation"</i> (not the "eating") took place
  <i>after the resurrection</i>) and that the manifestation was limited to
  those who had been Christ's intimate companions, or as the Greeks say,
  <i>"sharers of his table," during his life.</i></p>

  <p>I remembered also an old remark of Scaurus's about our modem Roman use of
  "convivo," meaning "I <i>live with</i>" and how easily it might be taken to
  mean the ordinary "convivor," meaning "I <i>feast with</i>." Since that, I
  have found that, in other ways, <i>"living with"</i> and <i>"eating with"</i>
  may be easily confused. For these reasons I concluded that the supposition
  that Jesus ate with the disciples after His resurrection was not
  justified.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27">XXVII. &mdash; SCAURUS ON CHRIST'S RESURRECTION
     (II)</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I NOW come," said Scaurus, "to one of the most interesting
  of all the traditions of the resurrection&mdash;the 'rolling away of the
  stone' from the tomb. As to the alleged facts, all the evangelists agree. But
  Mark alone has preserved traces of what I take to be the historical fact,
  namely, that the narrative, as it now stands, has sprung from Christian songs
  and hymns based on Hebrew scriptures and Jewish traditions. I showed you
  above how the precept, 'Go forth with the staff alone,' did not mean 'with a
  walking-stick' but 'with the staff of God,' a metaphor from the story of
  Jacob in Genesis. Curiously enough, the same story will help us to explain
  the rolling away of the stone.</p>

  <p>"There Jacob rolls away the stone from the well for Rachel in order that
  her flocks may obtain water. The Jews have many symbolical explanations of
  this 'rolling of the stone.' One is, that the stone is the evil nature in
  man. When worshippers go into the synagogue, the stone (they say) is rolled
  away. When they come out, it is rolled back again. Philo comments fully on
  the somewhat similar action of Moses helping the daughters of Jethro, taking
  it in a mystical sense. The scriptures may be regarded as the 'water of life'
  or 'living water.' The 'stone' prevents the 'water' from issuing to those
  that thirst for it. You may perhaps remember that Paul says something of the
  same kind, but using a different metaphor. To this day, he says, a 'veil'
  lies on the hearts of the Jews when the scriptures are read.</p>

  <p>So Luke says&mdash;concerning one of Christ's predictions about his
  resurrection&mdash;' it was veiled from them.' Luke also relates that Christ,
  after the resurrection, conversed with two disciples, but did not make
  himself visible to them till he had 'interpreted the scriptures' to them.
  Then, when he broke bread, 'their eyes were opened and they recognised him.'
  This 'interpreting,' the two disciples call 'opening the scriptures.' The
  <i>'opening of the scriptures'</i> might be called <i>'taking the veil from
  the heart,'</i> or <i>'rolling away the stone,'</i> But the last phrase might
  still better be used for <i>'rolling away the burden of unbelief.'</i>"</p>

  <p>All this seemed fanciful to me. But as I knew very little about Jewish
  tradition I waited to see what traces of this poetic language Scaurus could
  show in the Greek text of Mark. Before passing to that, however, Scaurus
  showed me, from Isaiah, that "the stone" might be used in two senses, a good
  and a bad; a good, for believers, as being "the stone that had become the
  head of the comer"; but a bad, for unbelievers, as "the stone of stumbling
  and rock of offence." And he said that the stone rolled away by Jacob was
  called by some Jews the Shechinah or glory of God. According to Matthew, the
  "stone" at the door of the tomb was "sealed" by the chief priests, the
  enemies of Christ. There it stood, as an enemy, saying to the disciples,
  "Your faith is vain. He will come out no more. He is dead." This was <i>"a
  stone of stumbling,"</i> On the other hand Scaurus said he had read an
  epistle written by Peter, which bids the disciples come to Christ as <i>"a
  living stone."</i></p>

  <p>"Now," said Scaurus, "taking the accounts literally, we must find it
  impossible to explain how the women, at about six o'clock in the morning,
  could expect to find men at the tomb ready and willing to roll the stone away
  for them; or, if guards were on the spot, how the guards could be induced to
  allow it. And there are also other difficulties, too many to enumerate, in
  the differences between the evangelists as to the object of the women's
  visit. But taking the account as originally a poem, we are able to recognise
  (I think) two or three historic facts found in Mark alone.</p>

  <p>"First, take the statement that the women 'said,' or 'said to themselves.'
  'Who <i>will roll</i> away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?' I am
  not surprised that someone has altered this into, 'Who <i>has rolled</i> away
  the stone for us?' Improbable though the latter is, it is at all events
  conceivable. But it is inconceivable that women, going to the guarded door of
  a prison, should ask, as a literal question, 'Who will open the door for us?'
  Taken literally, Mark's text implies something almost as absurd as this. But
  now take it as a prayer to heaven. Then you may illustrate it by the language
  of the Psalmist, 'Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will
  stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?'&mdash;followed by 'Unless
  the Lord had been my help my soul had soon dwelt in silence.' So the Psalmist
  says, 'Who will bring me into the fenced city?' and then adds, 'Hast not thou
  cast us off, O God?' You see in all these cases the question is really a
  prayer, a passionate and almost desperate prayer, implying 'What man will do
  this for us? No man. No one but God.' So it is in the Law, 'Who will go up to
  heaven? Who will go down into the deep?' These last words Paul quotes as the
  utterance of something approaching to despair. So I take the women's words as
  having been originally a cry to God, 'Who, if not God, will roll away the
  stone!'</p>

  <p>"Secondly, note that Mark says nothing about any guards at the tomb.
  According to him, no obstacle was to be anticipated by the women, in their
  attempt to enter the tomb, except the weight of the stone, which was '
  exceeding great.' No other evangelist says this. But I have seen traditions
  describing the stone as so heavy that twenty men could scarcely roll it, or
  that it required the efforts of the elders and scribes aided by the centurion
  and his soldiers. In my opinion the omission of the 'greatness' by Matthew
  and Luke, and the literalising of it by later traditions, arise from a
  misunderstanding of its poetical and spiritual character. The 'stone' was
  'exceeding great' in this sense, that it could not be moved except by the
  help of God.</p>

  <p>"Thirdly, 'the women <i>looked up</i> and saw it (<i>i.e.</i> the stone)
  <i>rolled upward</i>,' that is, as I take it, to heaven, in a vision.</p>

  <p>The word here used for 'look up' may mean 'regain sight,' as though the
  women were blind to the fact till they had uttered their aspiration (' who
  will roll it away? ') and then their eyes were opened. Anyhow, it is more
  than 'looked.' I think it means 'saw in a vision'." I was certainly
  astonished at this use of "look up," but much more at the <i>"rolling up"</i>
  of the stone.</p>

  <p>"As to Mark's <i>'rolling up'</i>," said Scaurus, "I have looked
  everywhere, trying to find his word used by others in the sense of 'roll
  away,' or 'roll back.' But in vain. Its use here is all the more remarkable
  because, when Jacob rolls away the stone for Rachel, the word <i>'roll
  away'</i> is used. You may say, 'This shows that the term is not borrowed
  from Jacob's story.' I cannot agree with that. The Christian hymn might
  contrast Jacob, the type of Christ, rolling the stone merely on one side,
  with Christ, the fulfilment, rolling it right up to heaven. I should add that
  a marginal note in Mark inserts an ascension of angels with Jesus at this
  point."</p>

  <p>In attempting to do justice to this narrative and to Scaurus's criticisms
  of it, I felt at a great disadvantage owing to my ignorance of Jewish
  literature and thought; and at first I was much more disposed to put by the
  whole story as an inexplicable legend than to accept Scaurus's explanation.
  But afterwards, looking at Matthew's narrative, I found that Matthew
  described an "angel" as "rolling away the stone," and as sa)ring to the
  women, "Fear not." This seemed decidedly to confirm the conclusion that the
  women saw "a vision of angels" (a phrase used by Luke) in which vision the
  stone was seen rolled away&mdash;or (as Mark says) "rolled upward"&mdash;when
  the angels went up to heaven. But all this&mdash;though it confused and
  wearied me&mdash;did not prevent me from believing that the spirit, or
  spiritual body, of Christ had really risen from the dead, since I had all
  along supposed that this alone was what was meant by Christ's resurrection,
  in accordance, as it appeared to me, with Paul's statements. Nothing that
  Scaurus had said, so far, seemed to me to shake Paul's testimony to the
  resurrection.</p>

  <p>But Scaurus's next remarks dealt with this matter, and greatly shook my
  faith. "I had almost forgotten," he said, "to speak of Christ's appearance to
  Paul. It was clearly a mere image of Paul's thought, called up by his
  conscience&mdash;nothing more. I need write no further about it. Flaccus has
  sent you Luke's Acts of the Apostles. If you are curious, look there, and you
  will find enough and more than enough. My belief is, that, if Stephen had not
  seen Christ, Paul would not have seen Christ. That puts the matter
  epigrammatically, and therefore (to some extent) falsely; for all epigrams
  are partly false. But it is mainly true. There may have been other Stephens
  whom Paul persecuted. But Stephen, I think, summed up the effect of all. Read
  what Paul says to the Romans about the persecuted and their conquest of
  persecutors:&mdash;'Bless them that persecute you'; that is, instead of
  resorting to the fire of vengeance against one's enemy, use, he says, the
  refiner's fire of kindness, 'for in doing this thou shalt heap coals of fire
  on his head'; finally, 'Be not conquered by evil, but conquer evil with
  good.' Read this. Then reflect that Paul 'persecuted.' Then read the Acts and
  see how he persecuted Stephen, and how Stephen interceded for his enemies. I
  take it that Paul is writing from experience&mdash;that the intercession of
  Stephen 'overcame' Paul (<i>he</i> would say 'overcame,' <i>I</i> should say
  'hypnotized' him) and compelled Paul to see what Stephen saw, namely, Jesus
  raised from the dead and glorified. Read the Acts and see if I am not
  right."</p>

  <p>It had not occurred to me before, while I was reading what Flaccus's
  letter said incidentally about the inclusion of the Acts of the Apostles in
  my parcel, that this book would probably give me Luke's account of the
  conversion of the apostle Paul, which had been so much in my thoughts, in my
  conjectures, and even in my dreams. Now, therefore, although barely a dozen
  lines of Scaurus's letter remained to read, I immediately put them aside and
  took up the Acts. Here I found that I had been wrong in most of my wild
  anticipations about the circumstances of Paul's conversion; but I had been
  right in supposing that the conversion took place near Damascus, and that the
  utterance of Christ would contain the words, "I am Jesus." Moreover the
  words, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?" accorded (not indeed exactly
  but as to their general sense) with my dream about the Christian
  martyrs&mdash;how they looked at me, as though saying, Why didst thou rack
  me? Why didst thou torture me?; and how they blessed me, and looked up to
  heaven; and how they made me fear lest I, too, should be compelled to look up
  and see what they saw.</p>

  <p>Now therefore once more I was seized with a kind of fellow-feeling for
  Paul as he journeyed to Damascus. I began again to imagine his efforts to
  prevent himself from thinking of Stephen, and from seeing Stephen's face
  looking up to heaven, and from hearing Stephen's blessing. It seemed to me
  that I, too, should have rebelled as Paul rebelled at first, striving against
  my conscience, like the bullock that kicks against the goad. Then I asked,
  "Should I have done what Paul did afterwards? Should I, too, have been
  'overcome' as Paul was, being brought under the yoke?" I thought I might have
  been.</p>

  <p>But was it seemly or right that a free man should be brought under a "
  yoke"? That was the question I had now to answer. I seemed to have come to
  the branching of the paths. All depended on the nature of the "yoke." What
  was it? On the one hand, Paul said it was "the constraining love of Christ."
  He had made me feel that there was nothing base in it, nothing to be ashamed
  of. Nay, under Paul's influence, this "yoke" had begun to seem an ensign of
  the noblest warfare, a sign of royalty, the emblem of service undertaken by
  God Himself, the yoke of the risen Saviour, the Son of God, enthroned by the
  Father's side in heaven, and in the hearts of men on earth. But on the other
  side stood Scaurus, maintaining that all these Jewish stories were
  dreams&mdash;not falsehoods, but self-deceits more dangerous than falsehoods.
  He had also convinced me that the gospels contained an unexpected multitude
  of errors and exaggerations and disproportions. This I could not honestly
  deny. Thus the gospels flung me back&mdash;or at least, as interpreted by
  Scaurus, seemed to fling me back&mdash;from the faith to which I was just on
  the point of attaining through the epistles. In my bewilderment I was no
  longer able to say clearly and firmly as before, "Nevertheless the moral
  power of the gospel is attested by facts that Scaurus and Arrian both admit,
  facts that Epictetus would be only too glad to allege for himself&mdash;by
  myriads of souls converted from vice to virtue. Does not this moral power
  rest on reality?"</p>

  <p>The Christians themselves seemed to attach so much importance to "Christ
  in the flesh" that I began to attach importance too. The evangelists appeared
  to say, in effect, "If we cannot prove that Christ in the flesh arose from
  the dead, then we admit that He has not arisen." So they&mdash;or rather my
  impression about them&mdash;led me away to say the same thing. A few days
  ago, I had neither desired nor expected that Christ should be demonstrated to
  have risen in the flesh. Now I said, "I fear it cannot be proved that Christ
  in the flesh, that Christ's tangible body, rose from the dead. Nay, more, I
  feel that the belief in what might be called a tangible resurrection arose
  from some such causes as Scaurus has specified. So I must give up all
  belief."</p>

  <p>I ought to have waited. I ought to have asked, "All belief in
  <i>what</i>?" "Belief in <i>what kind</i> of resurrection?" Scaurus himself
  had casually admitted that visions, though not presenting things tangible,
  might present things real. If so, then the visions of Israel might be real,
  the visions to Abraham and the patriarchs, to Moses, to the prophets. These
  might be a series of lessons given to the teachers in the east to be passed
  on to the learners in the west. Among the latest of these was a vision of
  "one like unto a Son of man." He was represented as "coming " with the clouds
  of heaven. That was a noble vision. Yet how much better and nobler would be a
  vision of the Son of man "coming" into the hearts of men, taking possession
  of them, reigning in them, establishing a kingdom of God in them! Such a Son
  of man had been revealed to Paul, "defined" as "the Son of God ", "from the
  resurrection of the dead." Being both God and man He brought (so Paul said)
  God and man into one, imparting to all men the sense of divine sonship, the
  light of righteousness and spiritual life, triumphant over spiritual darkness
  and death. This is what I ought to have thought of, but did not.</p>

  <p>Such an all-present power of divine sonship Paul seemed also to have in
  view when he likened belief in the risen Saviour to the faith described by
  Moses in Deuteronomy. The true believer, said Paul, is not the slave of
  place, saying, "Who shall go up to heaven?" that is, to bring Christ down to
  us from the right hand of God. Nor does he say, "Who shall go down to the
  abyss?" that is, to bring Christ up to us from the dead. The word of faith is
  "very near." It is "in the heart." It says, "Believe <i>with the heart</i>
  that God raised Christ from the dead." Such belief is not from the "eyes" nor
  from the "understanding"&mdash;as if one saw with one's own eyes the door of
  the grave burst open by an angel, or heard the facts attested in a law court
  by a number of honest and competent eye-witnesses incapable of being deceived
  and of deceiving. To say, "I believe it because Marcus or Gaius believed it,"
  is to avow a belief in Marcus or Gaius, not in Christ, unless the avower can
  go on to say "and because I have felt the risen Saviour within me."</p>

  <p>He alone really and truly believes in the resurrection of Christ whose
  belief is based on personal experience. If he has that, he can contemplate
  without alarm the divergences of the gospels in their narratives of this
  spiritual reality. He will understand the meaning of Paul's words, "It
  pleased God to <i>reveal His Son in me</i>"&mdash;not "to me," but "<i>in
  me.</i>" For indeed it is a revelation&mdash;not a demonstration from the
  intellect and senses alone&mdash;derived from all our faculties when
  enlightened by God. God draws back the veil from our fearful and faithless
  hearts and gives us a convincing sense of Christ at His right hand and in
  ourselves. This "conviction" is derived from no source but the convincing
  Spirit of the Saviour, coming to us in various ways, and through many
  instruments, but mostly through disciples whom the Saviour loves, and who
  have received not only His Spirit but also the power of imparting it to
  others.</p>

  <p>All these things I knew afterwards, but not at the time I am now
  describing. I had indeed already some faint conjecture of the truth, but not
  such as I could put into definite words. I was defeated. In the bitterness of
  defeat I exclaimed, "There is more beyond, but I cannot reach it. I cannot
  even suggest it. These evangelists give me no help. They take part with
  Scaurus against me. I am beaten and must surrender." Yet I felt vaguely that
  I was not fairly beaten. I was like a baffled suitor retiring from a court of
  justice, crushed by a hostile verdict, victorious in truth and equity, but
  beaten and mulcted of all his estate on some point of technical law.</p>

  <p>In this mood, sullen and sick at heart, weary of evidence and evidential
  "proofs" that were no proofs, and irritated rather with the evangelists than
  with Scaurus&mdash;who, after all, was doing no more than his duty in
  pointing out what appeared to him historical errors&mdash;I was greatly moved
  by an appeal to my love of truth with which my old friend concluded his
  letter. It was to this effect.</p>

  <p>"Well, Silanus, now I have really done. I cannot quite understand what
  induced me to take up so much of my time, paper, and ink&mdash;and your time,
  too, which is worse&mdash;and all to kill a dead illusion. Why do I say
  'dead' if it was never alive? Perhaps it was once nearly alive even in my
  sceptical soul. I think I have mentioned before that I, even I, have had
  moments when the dream of that phantom City of Truth and Justice had
  attractions for me. Perhaps I fancied it might be possible to receive this
  Jewish prophet as a great teacher and philosopher&mdash;helpful for the
  morals of private life at all events, even though useless for politics and
  imperial affairs&mdash;apart from the extravagant claims now raised for him
  by his disciples. But it is gone&mdash;this illusion&mdash;if it ever
  existed. The East and the West cannot mix. If they did, their offspring would
  be a portent. This Christian superstition is a mere creature of feeling, not
  of reason. I do not say it has done me harm to study it. Else I would not
  have sent you this letter. It is perhaps a bracing and healthful exercise to
  remind ourselves now and then that things are not as we could wish them to
  be, and that we must not 'feign things like unto our prayers.' A truthful man
  must see things as they are in truth. The City of Dreams has closed its gates
  against me, and I am shut out. It is warm in there. I am occasionally cold.
  So be it! Theirs is the fervour of the fancy, the comfortable warmth of the
  not-true. I must wrap myself in the cloak of truth&mdash;a poor uncomfortable
  thing, perhaps, but (as Epictetus would say) 'my own.' Truth, my dear
  Silanus, is your own, too&mdash;that is to say, truth to your own reason,
  truth to your own conscience. Never let wishes or aspirations wrest that from
  you. '<i>Keep what is your own!</i>'"</p>

  <p>For the time, this appeal was too strong for me. I wrote to Scaurus
  briefly confessing that the City of Dreams had had attractions for me, as
  well as for him, but that I had resolved to put the thought away, though I
  might, perhaps, continue a little longer the study of the Christian books,
  which I, too, had found very interesting. When I grew calmer, I added a
  postscript, asking whether it was not possible that "feeling," as well as
  "reason," might play a certain lawful part in the search after truths about
  God. My last words were an assurance that, whereas I had been somewhat
  irregular of late in my attendance at Epictetus's lectures, I should be quite
  regular in future. This indeed was my intention. As things turned out,
  however, the next lecture was my last.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28">XXVIII. &mdash; THE LAST LECTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AWAKING early next morning, two or three hours before
  lecture, I spent the time in examining the gospels, and in particular the
  accounts of Christ's last words. So few they were in Mark and Matthew that I
  could not anticipate that Luke would omit a single one of them or fail to
  give them exactly. They were uttered in public and in a loud voice. According
  to Mark and Matthew, they were a quotation from a Psalm, of which the Jewish
  words were given similarly by the two evangelists. They added a Greek
  interpretation. Luke, to my amazement, omitted both the Jewish words and the
  Greek interpretation. Afterwards, Mark and Matthew said that Jesus, in the
  moment of expiring, cried out again in a loud voice. On this occasion they
  gave no words. But there Luke mentioned words. Luke's words, too, were from a
  Psalm, but quite different in meaning from the words previously given by Mark
  and Matthew.</p>

  <p>Still more astonished was I to find what kind of words the two earliest
  evangelists wrote down as the last utterance of Christ&mdash;" My God, my
  God, why hast thou forsaken me?" That Christ said this I could hardly
  believe. Reading further, I found that some of the men on guard exclaimed
  "This man calls for Elias"&mdash;because the Jewish word "Heli" or "Eli," "my
  God," resembles the Jewish "Elias." I wished that these men might prove true
  interpreters. Then I found that, although Luke mentions neither "Eli" nor
  "Elias," he nevertheless mentions "Elios" or "Helios," which in Greek means
  "sun." This occurred in the passage parallel to Eli or Heli. What Luke said
  was that there was an "eclipse" or "failing," of "the sun." I thought then
  (and I think still) that Luke was glad&mdash;as a Christian historian might
  well be without being at all dishonest&mdash;to find that Mark's "Eli" had
  been taken, at all events by some, not to mean "my God." Perhaps some version
  gave "Elios," or "Helios," "sun." This Luke might gladly accept. Indeed, in
  the genitive, which is the form used by Luke, the word "Heliou" may mean
  either "of the sun" or "of Elias."</p>

  <p>But, on reflection, I could not find much comfort from Luke's version. For
  the difl5cult version seemed more likely to be true. And how could there be
  an "eclipse" of the sun during Passover, when the moon was at the full? Then
  I looked at the Psalm from which the words were taken, and I noted that
  although it began with "Why hast thou forsaken me?" it went on to say that
  God "hath not hid his face from him, but when he cried unto him he heard
  him." Also the Psalm ended in a strain of triumph, as though this cry "Why
  hast thou forsaken me?" would end in comfort and strength for all the meek,
  so that "all the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the Lord."
  Nevertheless this did not satisfy me. And even the help that I afterwards
  received from Clemens (about whom I shall speak later on) left me, and still
  to this day leaves me, with a sense that there is a mystery in this utterance
  beyond my power to fathom, though not beyond my power to believe.</p>

  <p>I was still engaged in these meditations when my servant brought me a
  letter. It was from Arrian, informing me of the death of his father, which
  would prevent him from returning to Nicopolis. He also requested me to convey
  various messages to friends to whom he had not been able to bid farewell
  owing to his sudden departure. In particular he enclosed a note, which he
  asked me to give to Epictetus. "Add what you like," he said, "you can hardly
  add too much, about my gratitude to him. I owe him morally more than I can
  express. Moreover in the official world, where everybody knows that our
  Master stands well with the Emperor, it is sometimes a sort of recommendation
  to have attended his lectures. And perhaps it has helped me. At all events I
  have recently been placed in a position of responsibility and authority by
  the Governor of Bithynia. I like the work and hope to do it fairly well. Even
  the mere negative virtue of not taking bribes goes for something, and that at
  least I can claim. I am not able, and never shall be able, to be a Diogenes,
  going about the province and healing the souls of men. But I try to do my
  duty, and I feel an interest in getting at the truth, and judging justly
  among the poor, so far as my limited time, energy and intelligence
  permit.</p>

  <p>"In the towns, among the artisans and slaves, I have been surprised to
  find so many of the Christians. You may remember how we talked about this
  sect more than once. You thought worse of them than I did. But I don't think
  you had much more basis than the impressions of your childhood, derived from
  what you heard among your servants and the common people in Rome. I have seen
  a great deal of them lately and have been impressed by the high average of
  their morality, industry, and charity to one another.</p>

  <p>"You never see a Christian begging. What is more, they set their faces
  against the exposing of children. I have often thought that our law is very
  defective in this respect. We will not let a father strangle his infant son,
  but we let him kill it by cold, starvation, or wild beasts. Every such death
  is the loss of a possible soldier to the state. It is a great mistake
  politically, and I am not sure whether it is right morally. When I first came
  to Nicopolis I used to hear it said that our Epictetus&mdash;one of the
  kindest of men I verily believe&mdash;once adopted a baby that was on the
  point of being exposed by one of his friends, got a nurse for it, and put
  himself to a lot of trouble. I sometimes wonder why he did not first give his
  friend the money to find a nurse and food for the baby, and then give him a
  good sharp reprimand for his inhumanity. For I call it inhuman. But I never
  heard Epictetus say a word against this practice. The Jews as well as the
  Christians condemn it. Perhaps the latter, in this point, merely followed the
  former; but in most points the Christians seem to me superior to the
  Jews.</p>

  <p>"I am proud to call myself a philosopher, and perhaps I should be prouder
  than Epictetus would like if I could call myself a Roman citizen ; but I am
  free to confess that there are points in which philosophers and Romans could
  learn something from these despised followers of Christus. <i>Fas est et a
  Christiano doceri</i>. I have been more impressed than I can easily explain
  to you on paper by the behaviour of this strangely superstitious sect. There
  is a strenuous fervour in their goodness&mdash;I mean in the Christians, I am
  not now speaking of the Jews&mdash;which I don't find in my own attempts at
  goodness. I am, at best, only a second-class Cynic, devoid of fervour.</p>

  <p>"You may say, like an orthodox scholar of Epictetus, 'Let them keep their
  fervour and leave me calmness.' But these men have both. They can be
  seasonably fervid and seasonably calm. I have heard many true stories of
  their behaviour in the last persecution. Go into one of their synagogues and
  you may hear their priest&mdash;or rather prophet, for priests they have
  none&mdash;thundering and lightening as though he held the thunderbolts of
  Zeus. Order the fellow off for scourging or execution, and he straightway
  becomes serenity itself. Not Epictetus could be more serene. Indeed, where an
  Epictetian would 'make himself a stone' under stripes and say, 'They are
  nothing to me,' a Christian would rejoice to bear them 'for the sake of
  Christus.' And even Epictetus, I think, could not reach the warmth, the glow,
  of their affection for each other. I am devoutly thankful that I did not
  occupy my present offIce under Pliny. It has never been my fate to scourge,
  rack, torture, or kill, one of these honest, simple, excellent creatures,
  whose only fault is what Epictetus would call their <i>'dogma'</i> or
  conviction&mdash;surely such a 'dogma' as an emperor might almost think it
  well to encourage among the uneducated classes, in view of its excellent
  results. Farewell, and be ever my friend."</p>

  <p>The third hour had almost arrived and I had to hasten to the lecture-room
  taking with me the note addressed to Epictetus. All the way, I could think of
  nothing but the contrast between what Arrian had said about the Christians,
  and what Mark and Matthew had said about Christ's last words&mdash;the
  servants tranquil, steadfast, rejoicing in persecution; their Master crying
  "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" It perplexed me beyond
  measure.</p>

  <p>In this bewilderment, I took my accustomed place beside Glaucus, who
  greeted me with even more than his usual warmth. He seemed strangely altered.
  It was no new thing for him to look worn and haggard. But to-day there was a
  strange wildness in his eyes. Absorbed though I was in my own thoughts, I
  could not help noticing this as I sat down, just before Epictetus began.</p>

  <p>The lecture was of a discursive kind but might be roughly divided into two
  parts, one adapted for the first class of Cynics, those who aspired to teach;
  the other for the second class, those who were content to practise. The first
  class Epictetus cautioned against expecting too much. No man, he said, not
  even the best of Cynic teachers, could control the will of another. Socrates
  himself could not persuade his own son. It was rather with the view of
  satisfying his own nature, than of moving other men's nature, that Socrates
  taught. Apollo himself, he said, uttered oracles in the same way. I believe
  he also repeated&mdash;what I have recorded before&mdash;that Socrates "did
  not persuade one in a thousand " of those whom he tried to persuade.</p>

  <p>I remembered a similar avowal in Isaiah when the prophet declares that his
  message is "Hear ye indeed, but understand not"; and this, or something like
  it, was repeated by Jesus and Paul. But Isaiah says, "Lord, how long?" And
  the reply is that the failure will not be for ever. In the Jewish utterances,
  there was more pain but also more hope. I preferred them. Nor could I help
  recalling Paul's reiterated assertions that everywhere the message of the
  gospel was a "power,"&mdash;sometimes indeed for evil, to those that hardened
  themselves against it, but more often for good&mdash;constraining, taking
  captive, leading in triumph, and destined in the end to make all things
  subject to the Son of God. Compared with this, our Master's doctrine seemed
  very cold.</p>

  <p>In the next place, Epictetus addressed himself to the larger and lower
  class of Cynics, those who were beginning, or who aspired only to the passive
  life. These he exhorted to set their thoughts on what was their own, on their
  own advantage or profit&mdash;of course interpreting profit in a philosophic
  sense as being virtue, which is its own reward and is the most profitable
  thing for every man. It was all, in a sense, very true, but again I felt that
  it was chilling. It seemed to send me down into myself, groping in the
  cellars of my own nature, instead of helping me to look up to the sun. Most
  of it was more or less familiar; and there was one saying that I have quoted
  above, to the effect that the universe is "badly managed if Zeus does not
  take care of each one of His own citizens in order that they like Him may be
  divinely happy." Now I knew that Epictetus did not use the word
  <i>eudaemon</i>, or divinely happy, referring to the next life, for he did
  not believe that a "citizen of Zeus" would continue to exist, except as parts
  of the four elements, in a future life. He meant "in this life." And if
  anyone in this life felt unhappy&mdash;more particularly, if he
  "wept"&mdash;that was a sign, according to Epictetus, that he was not a
  "citizen of Zeus." For he declared that Ulysses, if he wept and bewailed his
  separation from his home and wife&mdash;as Homer says he did&mdash;"was not
  good." So it came to this, that no man must weep or lament in earnest for any
  cause, either for the sins or sorrows of others, or for his own, on pain of
  forfeiting his franchise in the City of Zeus. I had read in the Hebrew
  scriptures how Noah, and Lot, and others of the "citizens of God," lived
  alone amongst multitudes of sinners; but they, and the prophets too, seemed
  to be afflicted by the sins around them. Also Jesus said in the gospels, "O
  sinful and perverse generation! How long shall I be with you and bear you!"
  as though it were a burden to him. And I had come to feel that every good man
  must in some sense bear the sins and carry the iniquities of his
  neighbours&mdash;especially those of his own household, and his own flesh and
  blood. So I flinched from these expressions of Epictetus, although I knew
  that they were quite consistent with his philosophy.</p>

  <p>Glaucus, I could clearly see, resented them even more than I did. He was
  very liable to sudden emotions, and very quick to show them. Just now he
  seemed unusually agitated. He was writing at a great pace, but not (I
  thought) notes of the lecture. When Epictetus proceeded to warn us that we
  must not expect to attain at once this perfection of happiness and peace, but
  that we must practise our precepts and wait, Glaucus stopped his writing for
  a moment to scrawl something on a piece of paper. He pushed it toward me, and
  I read "<i>Rusticus expectat</i>." I remembered that he had replied to me in
  this phrase when I had given him some advice about "waiting patiently,"
  saying that all would "come right," or words to that effect. I did not now
  feel that I could say, "All will come right." Perhaps my glance in answer to
  Glaucus expressed this. But he said nothing, merely continuing his writing,
  still in great excitement.</p>

  <p>Epictetus proceeded to repeat that "pity" must be rejected as a fault. The
  philosopher may of course love people, but he must love them as Diogenes did.
  This ideal did not attract me, though he called Diogenes "mild." The Cynic,
  he said, is not really to weep for the dead, or with those sorrowing for the
  dead. That is to say, he is not to weep "<i>from within</i>." This was his
  phrase. Perhaps he meant that, although in the ante-chamber and even in some
  inner chambers of the soul there may be tearful grief, and sorrow, and
  bitterness of heart, yet in the inmost chamber of all there must be peace and
  trust. But he did not say this. He said just what I have set down above. At
  the words "<i>not from within</i>" Glaucus got up and began to collect his
  papers, as though intending to leave the room. The next moment, however, he
  sat down and went on writing.</p>

  <p>The lecture now turned to the subject of "distress"&mdash;which interested
  me all the more because I had noticed in the morning that Luke had described
  Christ as being "in distress" when he prayed fervently in the night before
  the crucifixion. But it seemed to me that Luke and Epictetus were using the
  same word for two distinct things. Epictetus meant "distress" about things
  not in our power, and among these things he included the sins of our friends
  and neighbours. But Luke seemed to mean "distress" about things in Christ's
  power, because (according to Luke's belief) Christ had a power of bearing the
  sins of others. If so, Luke did not mean what Epictetus meant, namely,
  nervous, faithless, and timid worry or terror, but rather an <i>agon</i>, or
  conflict, of the mind, corresponding to the <i>agon</i>, or conflict, of the
  body when one is wrestling with an enemy, as Jacob was said by the Hebrews to
  have wrestled with a spirit in Penuel.</p>

  <p>At this point, after repeating what I had heard him say before, concerning
  the grace and dexterity with which Socrates "played at ball" in his last
  moments&mdash;the ball being his life and his family&mdash;Epictetus passed
  on to emphasize the duty of the philosopher to preserve his peace of mind
  even at the cost of detaching himself from those nearest and dearest to him.
  Suppose, for example, you are alarmed by portents of evil, you must say to
  yourself "These portents threaten my body, or my goods, or my reputation, or
  my children, or my wife; but they do not threaten me" Then he insisted on the
  necessity of placing "the supreme good" above all ties of kindred. "I have
  nothing to do," he exclaimed, " with my father, but only with the supreme
  good." Scarcely waiting for him to finish his sentence, Glaucus rose from his
  seat, pressed some folded papers into my hand, and left the room.</p>

  <p>I think Epictetus saw him go. At all events, he immediately put himself,
  as it were, in Glaucus's place, as though uttering just such a remonstrance
  as Glaucus would have liked to utter, "Are you so hard hearted?" To this
  Epictetus replied in his own person, "Nay, I have been framed by Nature thus.
  God has given me this coinage." What our Master really meant was, that God
  has ordained that men should part with everything at the price of duty and
  virtue. "Duty" or "virtue" is to be the "<i>coin</i>" in exchange for which
  we must be ready to sell everything, even at the risk of disobeying a father.
  A father may bid his son betray his country that he, the father, may gain ten
  thousand sesterces. In such a case the son ought to reply&mdash;as Epictetus
  said&mdash;"Am I to neglect my supreme good that you may have it [<i>i.e.</i>
  what you consider your supreme good]? Am I to make way for you? What for?" "I
  am your father," says the father. "Yes, but you are not my supreme good.". "I
  am your brother," says the brother. "Yes, but you are not my supreme
  good."</p>

  <p>All this (I thought) was very moral in intention, but might it not have
  been put differently&mdash;"Father, I must needs disobey you for your sake as
  well as mine," "Brother, you are going the way to dishonour yourself as well
  as me"? Glaucus could not have taken offence at that. However, this
  occasional austerity was characteristic of our Teacher. Perhaps it was an
  ingredient in his honesty. He liked to put things sometimes in their very
  hardest shape, as though to let his pupils see how very cold, reasonable,
  definite, and solid his philosophy was, how self-interested, how calculating,
  always looking at profit! Yet, in reality, he had no thought for what the
  world calls profit. His eyes were fixed on the glory of God. This alone was
  <i>his</i> profit and <i>his</i> gain. But unless we were as God-absorbed as
  he was&mdash;and which of us could boast that?&mdash;it was almost certain
  that we should to some degree misunderstand him. Just now, he was in one of
  these detached&mdash;one might almost call them "non-human"&mdash;moods.</p>

  <p>A few moments ago, I had been sorry that Glaucus went out. But I ceased to
  regret it when I heard what followed. It was in a contrast between Socrates
  and the heroes of tragedy, or rather the victims of calamity. We must learn,
  he said, to exterminate from life the tragic phrases, "Alas!" "Woe is me!"
  "Me miserable!" We must learn to say with Socrates, on the point of drinking
  the hemlock, "My dear Crito, if this way is God's will, this way let it be!"
  and not, "Miserable me! Aged as I am, to what wretchedness have I brought my
  grey hairs!" Then he asked, "Who says this? Do you suppose it is someone in a
  mean or ignoble station? Is it not Priam? Is it not Oedipus? Is it not the
  whole class of kings? What else is tragedy except the passionate words and
  acts and sufferings of human beings given up to a stupid and adoring wonder
  at external things&mdash;sufferings set forth in metre!"</p>

  <p>This seemed to me gratuitously cruel. If ever human being deserved pity,
  was it not the poor babe Oedipus, predestined even before birth to evil, cast
  out to die on Mount Cithaeron, but rescued by the cruel kindness of a
  stranger&mdash;to kill his own father, to marry his own mother, to beget
  children that were his brothers and sisters, and to die, an exile, in
  self-inflicted blindness, bequeathing his evil fate to guilty sons and a
  guiltless daughter! But Epictetus would not let Oedipus alone: " It is among
  the rich, the kings, and the despots, that tragedies find place. No poor man
  fills a tragic part except as one of the chorus. But the kings begin with
  prosperity, commanding their subjects (like Oedipus) to fix garlands on their
  houses in joy and thankfulness to the Gods. Then, about the third or fourth
  act, comes 'Alas, Cithaeron, why didst thou receive and shelter me?' Poor,
  servile wretch, where are your crowns now? Where is your royal diadem? Cannot
  your guards assist you?"</p>

  <p>All this was in stage-play, the agony of the king and the scoffing of the
  philosopher so life-like as to be quite painful&mdash;at least to me. Then
  Epictetus turned to us in his own person: "Well, then, in the act of
  approaching one of these great people, remember this, that you are going to a
  tragedian. By '<i>tragedian</i>' I do not mean an <i>actor</i>, but a
  <i>tragic person</i>, Oedipus himself But perhaps you say to me 'Yes, but
  such and such a lord or ruler may be called blessed. For he walks with a
  multitude ' "&mdash;of slaves, he meant&mdash;" 'around him.' See, then! I
  too go and place myself in company with that multitude. Do not I also 'walk
  with a multitude'? But to sum up. Remember that the door is always open. Do
  not be more cowardly than the children. When they cease to take pleasure in
  their game, they cry at once 'I will not play any more.' So you, too, as soon
  as things appear to you to point to that conclusion, say, 'I will not play
  any more.' And be off. Or, if you stay, don't keep complaining."</p>

  <p>This was the end of the lecture, and I felt gladder than ever that Glaucus
  had gone; for he seemed to me to have been just in the mood to take to heart
  that last suggestion, "The door is always open." I hastened to his rooms, but
  he was not there. I found however that he was expected back soon, for he was
  making preparations for a journey. Leaving word that I should call again in
  an hour, I determined to use the interval to leave Arrian's note with
  Epictetus.</p>

  <p>The Master was disengaged and gave me a most kindly welcome, asking with
  manifest interest about Arrian and his prospects, and giving me to understand
  that he had heard of me, too, from Arrian and others. His countenance always
  expressed vigour, but on this occasion it had even more than its usual glow.
  Perhaps he was a little flushed with the exertion of his lecture. Perhaps he
  was glad to hear that at least one pupil, likely to do good work in the
  world, was remembering him gratefully in Bithynia. Possibly he thought
  another such pupil stood before him. I had never seen him close, face to
  face. Now I felt strongly drawn towards him, but not quite as pupil to
  master. From the moment of leaving the lecture-room that day, I had been
  repeating, "Alas, Cithaeron, why didst thou receive and preserve me?" Poor
  Oedipus! He seemed to sum up the cry of myriads of mortals predestined to
  misery. And what gospel had my Master for them? Nothing but mockery, "Poor,
  servile wretches!"</p>

  <p>Yet I had felt almost sure, even from the first utterance of the cruel
  words, that he had not intended to be cruel. Now, as 1 stood looking down
  into his face and he up at mine, some kind of subtle fellowship seemed to
  spring up between us. At least I felt it in myself and thought I saw it in
  him. And it grew stronger as we conversed. I rapidly recalled the reproach he
  had just now addressed to himself in his lecture, as coming from one of his
  pupils, "Are you so hard hearted?" At the moment I had asked "Could it
  possibly be true?" Now I knew it was not true. Certainly he had been absorbed
  in God. His God was not the God of Christ. It was a Being of Goodness of some
  sort, but impersonal, an Alone, not a real Father. Such as it was, however,
  Epictetus had been absorbed in it. He motioned to me to be seated, and began
  to question me about friends of his in Rome.</p>

  <p>I was on the point of replying, when the door burst open and Glaucus
  suddenly rushed in, beside himself with fury. Striding straight up to
  Epictetus, he began pouring forth a tale of wrongs, treacheries, outrages and
  malignities, perpetrated on his family in Corinth. He took no notice of my
  presence, and I doubt whether he was even aware of it, as he burst out into
  passionate reproaches on our Master for teaching that a son must witness such
  sufferings in a father or mother, brother or sister, and say, " These evils
  are no evils to me."</p>

  <p>It would serve no useful purpose, nor should I be able, to set down
  exactly what Glaucus said. Let it suffice that he had only too much reason
  for burning indignation against certain miscreants in Corinth. He had only
  that morning received news&mdash;which had been kept back from him by
  treachery&mdash;that cruel and powerful enemies had brought ruin, desolation,
  and disgrace upon his family. His father had been suddenly imprisoned on
  false charges, his sister had been shamefully humiliated, and his mother had
  died of a broken heart. "Epictetus," he cried, "do you hear this? Or do you
  make yourself a stone to me, as you bid us make ourselves stones when men
  smite us and revile us? Do you still assert that there are no evils except to
  the evil-minded? By Zeus in heaven, if there is a Zeus and if there is a
  heaven, I would sooner torture myself like a Sabazian, or be crucified like a
  Christian, or writhe with Ixion in hell, that I might at least cry out in the
  hearing of Gods and men, 'These things are evil, they are, they are' than be
  transported to the side of the throne above with you, looking down on the
  things that have befallen my father, mother, and sister, and repeating my
  Epictetian catechism, <i>I am in perfect bliss and blessedness; these things
  are no evils to me!</i> O man, man, are you a hypocrite, or are you indeed a
  stone?" So saying, without waiting for a word of reply, he rushed from the
  room.</p>

  <p>I went with him. I was not sure&mdash;nor am I now&mdash;whether Epictetus
  wished me to stay or to go. But I thought Glaucus needed me most. My heart
  went out to him when I heard for the first time how shamefully he had been
  deceived and how cruelly his family had been outraged, and I did not know
  what he might do in his despair. Besides, if I had stayed, could Epictetus
  have helped me to help my friend? What would his helping have been? It could
  have been nothing more&mdash;if he had been consistent&mdash;than to repeat
  for the thousandth time that Glaucus's "trouble," and my "trouble" for
  Glaucus's sake, were mere <i>dogmas</i>, or "convictions," and that our
  "convictions" were wrong and must be given up. Would he have been consistent?
  Would he have said these things?</p>

  <p>To this day I cannot tell. As I followed Glaucus out of the room, while in
  the act of turning round to close the door, I had my Master at a
  disadvantage. I saw him, but he did not see me. His head was drooping. The
  light was gone from his face; the eyes were lacking their usual lustre ; the
  forehead was drawn as if in pain. It was no longer Epictetus the God-
  absorbed, but Epictetus the God-abandoned. If I had turned to him with a
  reproach, "Epictetus, you are breaking your own rule. You are sorrowing,
  sorrowing in earnest," would he have replied, "No, only in appearance, not
  <i>from within</i>"? I do not think he would. He was too honest. To this day
  I verily believe that for once, at least for that once, our Master broke his
  own rule and felt real "<i>trouble</i>." And I love him the better for it.
  That indeed is how I always like to remember his face&mdash;as I saw it for
  the last time, not knowing that it was the last, through the closing
  door&mdash;clouded with real grief, while I was leaving him for ever without
  farewell, never trusting so little in his teaching, never loving the teacher
  so much.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29">XXIX. &mdash; SILANUS MEETS CLEMENS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WE walked on together, both of us silent, till we came to
  Glaucus's rooms. "Farewell," said he. I replied that I would come in to see
  whether I could help him to make arrangements for his journey. He said
  nothing, but suffered me to enter. For some time I busied myself with
  practical matters. So did Glaucus. But every now and then he stopped, and sat
  down as though dazed. I questioned him about his journey and time of
  starting. Finding that only two or three hours remained, I urged him to rouse
  himself. "It will be of no use," he said, "but you are right." Then he
  exclaimed bitterly, "Am I not obeying Epictetus? Am I not making myself a
  stone?" "Not quite," said I, "for a stone feels nothing. You are worse than a
  stone. For you feel much, yet do nothing to help those for whom you feel."
  "Thank you for that," said he. Then he roused himself. He did injustice to
  Epictetus, yet I perceived, as never before, how harmful this
  "stone-doctrine"&mdash;if I may so call it&mdash;might prove to many
  people.</p>

  <p>I have no space, nor have I the right, to describe more fally Glaucus's
  private affairs, the courage, affection, and steadfastness with which he bore
  the burdens of his family and saved his father and sister from their worst
  extremity. His course was different from Arrian's. Arrian remained outside
  the fold. Glaucus found peace as I did. And I know that many a suffering soul
  in Corinth suffered the less because Glaucus, having experienced such a
  weight of sorrow himself, had learned the secret of lightening it for others.
  He died young, thirty years ago, but he lived long enough to "fight the good
  fight."</p>

  <p>Our last words together, as he was in the act of departing, I remember
  well: "What was that you said to me, Silanus, about waiting and having one's
  strength renewed?" It was from Isaiah. I repeated it. Then I added, "But I
  spoke the words, I fear, because I had once felt them to be true. I did not
  quite feel them to be true at the moment when I repeated them to you. Perhaps
  I was not quite honest, or at least not quite frank." "Then you don't hold to
  them now?" said he. "God knows," said I. "Sometimes I do, sometimes I do not.
  For the most part I think I do. I believe that there is good beneath all the
  evil, if only we could see it, or at least good in the end, good far off."
  "Then" replied he, "you believe, perhaps, in a good God?" "I hope I may
  hereafter believe," said I, "nay, I am almost certain I believe in a good God
  now. But, if I do, it is in a God that is fighting against evil, a God that
  may perhaps share in our afflictions and in our troubles." "What?" said he,
  "you, a pupil of Epictetus, believe that God Himself can be troubled! Then of
  course you believe that a good man may be troubled?" "Indeed I do," said I.
  "At least I half believe it about God, and wholly about man." "Then you think
  I have a right to be troubled. You are a heretic." "We are heretics
  together," said I. "You have a right to be troubled, and I to be troubled
  with you." "Thank you, and thank the Gods, for that at least!" said he. "Do
  you know," said I, "that I am certain that Epictetus felt troubled too, for
  your sake? I saw him when he did not see me, as I was leaving the room; and I
  could not be mistaken." "Ah!" said Glaucus, drawing in his breath. Then
  suddenly, as we were clasping hands in our last farewell, he added "Do not
  think too much about those scrawls!" And before I had time to ask his
  meaning, he had ridden away.</p>

  <p>Returning to my rooms, I put away my lecture-notes and took out the
  gospels. But I could not read, and longed to be in the fresh air. As I rose
  from my seat to go out, my first thought was, "I will take no books with me."
  But Mark happened to be in my hand, the smallest of the gospels, "This," I
  said, "will be no weight." But it weighed a great deal in the rest of my
  life, as the reader will soon see.</p>

  <p>Before long, unconsciously seeking familiar solitudes, I found myself on
  the way to the little coppice where some days ago I had seen Hesperus above
  the departed sun, and Isaiah had shed on me the influence of his promise of
  peace. "Now," said I sadly to myself, "I have with me a book that calls
  itself the fulfilment of that promise. But it fulfils nothing for me." As I
  spoke, and drew the book from the folds of my garment, several pieces of
  paper fell on the ground. When I picked them up, I found&mdash;what I had
  completely forgotten&mdash;Glaucus's "scrawls." I thought they would contain
  some requests to perform commissions for him in Nicopolis, or to convey
  messages to friends, and that he might have written these in the lecture-room
  when he expected to hear news that might call him suddenly away. But they
  were something quite different. The first that I opened was entitled "A
  Postscript," written in verse, rallying me upon my advice about "waiting." It
  showed me how Glaucus, too, had been affected, not only by the lecture that
  drove him from the room, but also by that saying of Epictetus concerning Zeus
  ("He would have if he could have") which had disturbed me so much. It was
  wildly written as Glaucus himself confessed: but I will give it here,
  because&mdash;besides being a rebuke to me, and to all teachers that preach a
  gospel they do not feel&mdash;it shows how Epictetus himself, the perfection
  of honesty, stirred up in an honest and truthful pupil questionings and
  doubts that he could not satisfy or silence:</p>

  <p class="poem">POSTSCRIPT.<br>
  <br>
  If you, my Silanus<br>
  (Who think hopelessness heinous,<br>
  And lectured me lately<br>
  So sweetly, sedately,<br>
  Discussing, dilating,<br>
  I will not say "prating,"<br>
  On the great use of waiting.<br>
  You, whom I respected<br>
  But never suspected,<br>
  Never, no never,<br>

  Would but do your endeavour<br>
  To find more rhymes for "ever,"<br>
  Then cease would I never<br>
  But rhyme on forever,<br>
  Like that horrible lecture,<br>
  Our Master's conjecture,<br>
  About Zeus, a kind creature,<br>
  Whose principal feature<br>
  Was his frankly regretting<br>
  That the Fates keep upsetting,<br>
  By their cruel preventions,<br>
  His noble intentions;<br>
  'Tis not that I would not,<br>
  But I could not, I could not,<br>
  So said Zeus in a lecture<br>
  Our Master's conjecture,<br>
  <br>
  P.S. Mad, isn't it? But isn't the lecture madder?<br>
  P.P.S. I do hope and trust the Master is mad. I must go out.</p>

  <p>The larger "scrawl" touched me more nearly because it condemned those who
  indulge in "self-deceiving" and "call it believing "&mdash;a thing that
  Scaurus dreaded, and taught me to dread; and I was in special dread of it at
  that time. I have been in doubt whether to give this in full. But I am sure
  Glaucus, now in peace, would not take it amiss that his wild words of trouble
  should be recorded if they may help others who have lost peace for a time. So
  I give it to the reader just as Glaucus gave it to me. Outside was written,
  in large letters, "RUSTICUS EXPECTAT." Before the verses came a letter in
  prose as follows:</p>

  <p class="letter">Rusticus sends greeting to Silas,</p>

  <p class="letter">I am scrawling you a little poem, Silanus, to distract
  myself from this accursed lecture, lest Epictetus should make me absolutely
  sick with his nauseating stuff about the duty of sons not to be troubled by
  the troubles of their parents. Some days ago you gave me some edifying
  advice. Here is the answer to it&mdash;a little drama.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dramatis personae only two:&mdash;(1) Rusticus, for
  shortness called Hodge, <i>i.e.</i> Glaucus the Rustic, or perhaps Glaucus
  persuaded by Silanus, so that Glauco-Silanus is the true Rustic, unless you
  like to take the rôle entirely for yourself. Anyhow Hodge is a great fool;
  (2) The River, <i>i.e.</i> Destiny, alias Fate, alias Zeus, alias the God of
  Epictetus, alias the Whirlpool of the All, alias Nothing in Particular,</p>

  <p class="letter">The metre is appropriate to the subject matter, <i>i.e.</i>
  whirlpooly, eddyish, chaotic. There is no villain. The River would he if it
  could. But it can't&mdash;not being able to help being what it is&mdash;like
  Zeus, you know, who said in our lecture-room recently, "I would if I could
  but I couldn't." Hodge starves or drowns. This should make a tragedy. But he
  is such a fool that he turns it into a comedy&mdash;for the amusement of the
  Gods. They are intensely amused&mdash;which perhaps should turn the thing
  back again into a tragedy. Comedy or tragedy? Or tragi-comedy? Or burlesque?
  I give it up. The one thing certain is&mdash;Chaos!</p>

  <p class="poem">RUSTICUS EXPECTAT<br>
  <br>
  Hodge sits by the river<br>
  Awaiting, awaiting.<br>
  Across he is going<br>
  If it will but stop flowing.<br>
  But when? There is no knowing.<br>
  He dare not try swimming<br>
  In those waves full and brimming.<br>
  On foot there's no going.<br>
  And there's no chance of rowing.<br>
  So there he sits blinking<br>
  And calling it "thinking"!<br>
  God nor man can deliver<br>
  His soul from that river.<br>
  But Hodge won't believe it,<br>
  His soul can't receive it!<br>
  Himself he's deceiving.<br>
  But he styles it "believing"!<br>
  So this simpleton artless<br>
  To a THING that is heartless<br>
  Prays!&mdash;yes, takes to praying<br>
  In the hope of its staying<br>
  His soul to deliver:<br>
  "Good river, kind river,<br>
  Across I'd be going<br>
  If you would but stop flowing<br>
  Stay! pity my moping!<br>
  I'm hoping, I'm hoping .<br>
  That you won't flow for ever.<br>
  Oh, say, will you never<br>
  Cease flowing, cease flowing?<br>
  Across I'd be going.<br>
  Rest! Flow not for ever!"<br>
  Says the river, deep river:<br>
  "I care not a stiver<br>
  For all your long waiting<br>
  And praying and prating<br>
  And whining and pining<br>
  And hoping and moping.<br>
  Wait, if you like waiting,<br>
  Prate, if you like prating,<br>
  Pray, if you like praying.<br>
  But think not I'm staying.<br>
  Dream not I'm delaying<br>
  For a man and his praying.<br>
  For his smiling or frowning.<br>
  His swimming or drowning.<br>
  Hope, if you're for hoping.<br>
  Mope, if you're for moping,<br>
  I'm not made for consoling<br>
  But for rolling and rolling<br>
  For ever. Time's stream none can sever.<br>
  Then cease your endeavour<br>
  Your soul to deliver<br>
  By coaxing the river.<br>
  Cease shall I never<br>
  But flow on for ever<br>
  FOR EVER,"</p>

  <p>I was walking slowly onward, with the paper in my hand, my eyes bent on
  the ground. Suddenly a shadow, and a courteous salutation, made me aware that
  a stranger had met me and was passing by. Surprised and startled, I recovered
  myself after a moment and turned round to answer his greeting. He, too,
  turned, a man past threescore as I guessed, but vigorous, erect, with a
  dignity of carriage that appeared at the first glance. He bowed and passed
  on. The face reminded me of someone, but I could not think who it was. I
  turned again to Glaucus's paper. "Don't think too much of those scrawls" had
  been his last words. But how could I help thinking of them? How many myriads
  were in the same case! The myriads did not say what Glaucus said. But how
  many of them felt it! They had not suffered perhaps as he had, but they had
  suffered enough&mdash;crushed, maimed, forsaken!</p>

  <p>Yes, FORSAKEN! As I uttered the word aloud, there came back to me both the
  face of the stranger and the face like his, the face that I had not been able
  to recall. I had been thinking of old Hermas, whom I had seen as a child of
  five or six and had never forgotten. Scaurus's letters had recently brought
  him back to my memory again and again, depicting him just as I remembered
  him, and suggesting to me all sorts of new questions as to the mystery that
  lay behind those quiet eyes and that strong gentle look, which even in my
  childhood had left on me an indelible impression. I had been asking myself.
  What was the secret of it? Now I knew. Hermas was not "<i>forsaken</i>," And
  this man, the man I had just met, he too looked not "<i>forsaken</i>," "Yet I
  wonder," said I, "what that stranger would think if Hermas were to invite him
  to worship a Son of God whose last words to the Father were, 'Why hast thou
  forsaken me?' Epictetus, I know, would declare that the words expressed an
  absolute collapse of faith. How would old Hermas explain them? And what would
  Scaurus say if I confessed that I found no God anywhere in heaven or earth to
  whom my heart was so drawn as this 'forsaken' Christ? What would the Psalmist
  say if I used his words thus, 'Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is
  none on earth that I should desire in comparison with thee, 0, thou FORSAKEN
  SON OF GOD!'"</p>

  <p>By this time I had reached the wood. Pacing up and down, full of
  distracting thoughts, I came on the place where I had had my first vision of
  peace. There, tired out in body and mind, I threw myself down to rest.
  Presently, feeling in the folds of my garment for the gospel of Mark, I could
  not find it. Yet I had felt it when I first drew out Glaucus's paper. There
  was nothing for it but to retrace my steps as exactly as possible in the hope
  of hitting on the place where I must have dropped it. But I had not gone a
  hundred paces before I heard a rustling in the bushes, and the tall stranger
  reappeared and a second time saluted me.</p>

  <p>I returned his salutation. Then we were both silent.</p>

  <p>Nothing was in his hand, yet I felt sure that he had found my book, and I
  waited for him to speak. But a moment's reflection showed me his diffIculty.
  Was he, a stranger, to ask a Roman knight whether he had dropped one of the
  religious books of a proscribed superstition? It was for me, if for either,
  to begin. I liked the stranger's look even better than before and felt that
  he could be trusted; so I told him of my loss. He at once placed the volume
  in my hands saying that he had come back to restore it, believing me to be
  the owner. I thanked him heartily. He replied that I was welcome, then waited
  a moment or two, as though to allow me to say more if I pleased. I stood
  silent, wanting to speak, but as it were tongue-bound&mdash;not so much
  afraid as ashamed. At last, I stammered out something about the wood and its
  distance from Nicopolis. He smiled as though he understood my embarrassment.
  Then he repeated that I was welcome and moved away.</p>

  <p>I had suffered him to go a dozen paces when a voice said within me, " Why
  do you let him go? Scaurus let Hermas go and repented it. You said that this
  man did not look 'forsaken.' Why do you let him 'forsake' you? Why do you
  make yourself 'forsaken'? Perhaps he can help you." I called him back. "Sir,"
  said I, "pardon me one question. Doubtless you looked at this roll to find
  some clue to its owner?" "I did," he replied. "I am interested," said I, "in
  this little book". Then I paused. I had grown into the habit of adding&mdash;
  in writing to Flaccus, to Scaurus, and in speaking to myself too&mdash;"from
  a literary point of view," "as a historical investigation," and so on. But
  now I could not say such things. In the first place, they would not be true.
  In the second place, I knew instinctively that the man would know that they
  were not true. Moreover I had a presentiment that he was to be to me what
  Hermas had almost been to Scaurus. On the other hand, had I the right to ask
  a perfect stranger whether he had studied a Christian gospel? He read my
  thoughts. "You desire," he said, "to ask me something more. Am I acquainted
  with this book? That, I think, is your question? If so, I say, 'Yes'." "There
  are," said I, very slowly, and almost as if the words were drawn out of me by
  force, "some few things that I greatly admire and many things that greatly
  perplex me, in this little book. I think I might understand some of the
  latter, had I some guidance." "I am but a poor guide," he replied.
  "Nevertheless, if it is your will, I am quite willing. I have an hour's
  leisure. Then I must go on my business. Shall we sit down here?"</p>

  <p>So we sat down, and I began to question him about Mark and the other
  gospels. But before I describe our conversation, I must remind my readers
  that at that time, forty-five years ago, in the second year of Hadrian, the
  gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, were not regarded as on the same level as
  scripture, nor as entirely different from other writings composed by pious
  Christians such as, for example, the epistle of Clemens Romanus to the
  Corinthians. No doubt, some Christians, even at that date, were disposed to
  rank the three gospels by themselves as superior to all others past or
  future; and some of them may have asserted that the number three was, as it
  were, predicted in the Law. For Moses said, "Out of the mouth of two
  witnesses" (that might be Mark and Matthew) "or three witnesses" (that would
  include Luke) "shall every word be established." But if they spoke thus, I do
  not know of it.</p>

  <p>On the contrary, I have heard, that about the very time of our
  conversation, that is in the second year of Hadrian, there were traditions
  about Mark (current in the neighbourhood of Ephesus) placing him on a very
  much lower level than the Hebrew prophets. Some used to accuse him (as I have
  confessed above that I was perhaps too prone to do) of being disproportioned
  and lengthy in unimportant detail. An Elder near Ephesus defended Mark. He
  laid the blame on the necessities of the case, saying that Mark recorded what
  he had heard from Peter, and that Peter adapted his teachings to the needs of
  the moment, so that "Mark committed no error" in writing some things as he
  did. Whether this Elder was right or wrong, his words showed that neither he,
  defending Mark, nor his opponents, attacking Mark, regarded the evangelist as
  perfect. Indeed his gospel was generally underrated, being placed far below
  that of Matthew and Luke, because people did not perceive that Mark often
  contained the account that was the truest&mdash;although expressed obscurely
  or in such a way as to cause some to stumble.</p>

  <p>At that time it would have been thought profane to put Mark or Luke on the
  same level with Moses, Samuel, David, Solomon, Isaiah and the prophets, to
  whom "the word of the Lord" is said to have "come." Luke never says, "The
  word of the Lord came to me," but, in effect, this: "I have traced things
  back carefully and accurately, and have thought it well to set them forth in
  chronological order." Matthew, as being an apostle, might have been placed on
  a different footing. But as he wrote in Hebrew, and his gospel was circulated
  in Greek, it was not thought that we had the very words of the apostle.
  Moreover Matthew's words often differed in such a way from Luke's, that 6ven
  a child could perceive that two writers were describing the same words of the
  Lord in two different versions, so that both could not be exactly correct.
  And, very often, Luke's version appeared better than Matthew's.</p>

  <p>Yet even in the reign of Trajan there had perhaps been springing up among
  a few people the belief that the three gospels above-mentioned were not only
  superior to others then extant but also to others that might hereafter be
  written. These men thought that Luke had said the last word on the things
  that were to be believed, correcting what was obscure in Mark and adding what
  was wanting. Perhaps it was natural that those who thus favoured Luke's
  gospel should be for a time averse to a fourth gospel. I believe that my
  friend Justin of Samaria, who suffered as a martyr in this very year in which
  I am now writing, always retained a prejudice of this kind, favouring the
  three gospels, and especially Luke. Even though he could not sometimes avoid
  using some of the traditions that had found a place in the fourth gospel, he
  disliked to quote it as a gospel, and, as far as I know, never did quote it
  verbally in his writings.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, some of the younger brethren now go into the opposite
  extreme, and maintain, not only that the fourth gospel is to be accepted, but
  also that the number four was, as it were, predestined. This seems to me as
  unreasonable as it would have been to maintain, in Trajan's time, that the
  gospels must be three because of the "three witnesses" prescribed by Moses on
  earth, and the three in 'heaven (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit)
  and the three angels that visited Abraham, and so on. Yet I have actually
  heard the teacher Irenaeus&mdash;the young man about whom I spoke
  above&mdash;asserting that the gospels must needs be four to correspond with
  the four quarters of the globe, the four elements, the four living creatures
  in Ezekiel, and other quadruplicities.</p>

  <p>However, I thank God that, when I was a young man, no such stumbling-
  block as this lay between me and my Saviour. Nor was any such belief in the
  necessity of four gospels entertained by my new friend Clemens&mdash;for that
  was his name, though he was not a Roman but an Athenian. He had long accepted
  the three gospels as containing the truth about Christ and about His
  constraining love. Recently, he had accepted the fourth gospel as also
  containing the same truth. But he neither believed nor expected me to believe
  that every word in these four writings was so inspired as to convey the
  unmixed truth. It was in these circumstances and with these
  preconceptions&mdash;or perhaps I should rather say freedom from
  preconceptions&mdash;that Clemens and I began our conversation.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30">XXX. &mdash; SILANUS CONVERSES WITH CLEMENS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">I EXPLAINED to Clemens that I had been attending the
  lectures of Epictetus. He had taught us, I said, to neglect external things,
  and to value virtue, as being placed by God in our own power and a possession
  open to all. "This," said I, "has strengthened me&mdash;this and the
  influence of his character&mdash;in the determination to lead a life above
  the mere pleasures of the flesh. But, on the other hand, Epictetus teaches us
  that we are never to be troubled, not even by the troubles or misdoings of
  those nearest and dearest to us. We are to say, 'These things are nothing to
  us'." I then explained to Clemens how this doctrine had repelled me, and how
  I had been led by an accident to study the letters of Paul, in which I found
  a very different doctrine.</p>

  <p>"Paul," said I, "counts many external things as evil, and especially the
  errors and transgressions of his converts. These he feels as evils and pains
  to himself. Yet he always seems hopeful and helpful, full of strength both
  for himself and for others. I have felt drawn towards him, and, through him,
  to the prophet Jesus, or Christ, whom he calls Son of God. Paul speaks of
  himself as led towards this Jesus by a 'constraining love' filling the heart
  with joy and peace. I have felt something of this, or at least have felt the
  possibility of it. In my childhood, 'Christus ' was called one of the vilest
  of the vile, and I believed it. Now I have come to regard him as&mdash;I know
  not what. Just now I said 'prophet.' But Epictetus calls Diogenes God's 'own
  son.' Christ, in my judgment, stands far above Diogenes and perhaps even
  above Socrates. When I say 'above Socrates' I do not mean in reason, but in
  feeling, and in the power to draw men towards kindness and steadfast
  welldoing. I think I had come almost to the point of calling this Jesus
  'God's own son' in a very real sense, as being above all other men, yes, and
  more&mdash;more than I could understand. And then ."</p>

  <p>"And then?" said Clemens. I had paused. He waited an instant longer,
  questioning, or rather interpreting me, with his eyes. "And then," said he,
  "something threw you back?" "Yes," said I, "something threw me back. And what
  do you think it was? Paul drew me on. But the author of this little book, he,
  and Matthew, and Luke&mdash;these threw me back. It happened in many ways. I
  must tell you the last first. A friend, a fellow-student, has just now left
  me for Corinth, crushed to the earth by the most shameful outrages on his
  family. I wished to give him some comfort, to point him towards some hope, to
  give him what you Christians&mdash;for surely you are a Christian?" He
  assented. "Well, what you Christians call 'good tidings' or 'gospel.'</p>

  <p>"Now if I could believe Paul, I should have a 'gospel' For then the spirit
  of Jesus, having risen from the dead, would be travelling about the world
  everywhere at hand to strengthen His disciples, and to comfort their hearts,
  and to assure them that all will be well in the end. 'I have prevailed over
  death'&mdash;so His Spirit would say to us&mdash;'I will always help the poor
  and oppressed. I will never forsake them till I have made them sharers in my
  eternal kingdom.' This it would say to each one of us, 'You, Gaius, or you,
  Marcus, I will be with you always. I will never forsake you.' But how can I
  believe these beautiful assurances, when I find Mark declaring (and Matthew
  agreeing with him) that Christ's last articulate utterance was, 'My God, my
  God, why hast thou forsaken me?' How can I assure my friend that God never
  forsakes the oppressed, if He forsook His own Son? And how can I deny that
  'forsaking,' when the Son Himself says, <i>Why hast thou forsaken?</i>?
  Epictetus forbade us to admit that we are ever alone. 'God,' said he, 'is
  always within you.' Is not that the better and nobler doctrine? If the better
  and nobler doctrine is not true, does it not follow that the truth is bad and
  ignoble, and that, in real truth, there is no good and noble power
  controlling the world? Which of the two is right, Epictetus or Christ?"</p>

  <p>"Both, I think," said Clemens. He had been listening with attention and
  manifest sympathy, but without any change in that steadfast look of peace and
  trust which his face habitually wore. I seemed to read in his countenance at
  once pain and faith, pain for my burden, faith that he could help me to bear
  it or to cast it away. Presently he added, "Do not suppose that by answering
  so briefly and quickly I wished to cut short your objection or to deny the
  difficulty. Far from it. You have asked, I think, one of the hardest
  questions, perhaps the very hardest, that could be put to a worshipper of
  Christ. Often have I thought of it, and I should not like to answer it
  hastily. You know perhaps that Luke omits these words, and that he mentions,
  instead, something about the 'sun'?" "Yes," said I, "but that seemed to me
  only to show that Luke was willing to accept a version that removed the
  difficulty in the original." "I agree with you," said Clemens, "and, if so,
  that indicates that the difficulty was recognised before Luke compiled his
  gospel. Certainly, certainly, those wonderful words were really uttered."</p>

  <p>Then he said, "First let me give you an explanation that is not
  unreasonable and may have some truth in it. You know, I dare say, that the
  words are from the Psalms?" "Yes," I replied, "but the Psalmist changes his
  mood. He goes on to say, 'He hath not hid his face from him, but, when he
  cried unto him, he heard him,' and afterwards, 'All the ends of the earth
  shall remember and turn unto the Lord '." "You have mentioned," said Clemens,
  "the very words that seem to some of our brethren to answer your question;
  for they say that the Lord had in mind the whole of the Psalm when He quoted
  the first words, and that He meant this, 'I cry unto thee, Father, in the
  words of scripture <i>Why hast thou forsaken me?</i> knowing that thou hast
  not indeed hidden thy face from me, but thou art hearing me: and all the ends
  of the earth shall remember my crying and thy hearing and shall turn unto
  thee'."</p>

  <p>"And are not you content with this explanation?" said I. "Not quite," said
  Clemens. "For, though this may be true, more may be true. I have read in
  another gospel, later than these three, that the Son did no work on earth and
  uttered no word, without looking up to the Father in heaven and listening to
  the Father's voice, which told Him from time to time what to do and to say.
  And I have heard one of the brethren, a man full of spiritual understanding,
  and well read in the scriptures, interpret the question as though it were a
  real question, not an exclamation&mdash;the Son questioning the Father as to
  His will. If that were so, the Son might be conceived as saying, 'For what
  reason, O Father, hast thou forsaken me for a while and hidden the light of
  thy countenance from me? Teach me, O Father, in order that I also may be
  willing to be forsaken, and may desire to be deprived of the light of thy
  countenance.' And then the Father replies, 'I forsake thee, O my Son, because
  thou must needs die, and in my presence is the fullness of life. The time
  hath come for thee to give up thy life, that is, to lose my presence for a
  brief space, that all men may gain for ever by thy brief loss and be saved
  from death by thy sacrifice of life.' And after this, said the brother, the
  Lord cried out a second time. What He said then, Mark and Matthew have not
  recorded; but they write that He then expired or sent forth His Spirit. The
  brother I am speaking of believed that the Son, by crying aloud 'Why hast
  thou forsaken?' prepared Himself to be willingly forsaken, and to be under
  the darkness of this momentary forsaking just before He gave up His life as a
  sacrifice for men."</p>

  <p>"But you say," said I, "that Epictetus, too, is right." "Certainly,"
  replied Clemens. "Epictetus says that men, God's children, are never 'alone.'
  And that is true. Indeed I can show you presently a new Christian
  gospel&mdash;the one I mentioned just now&mdash;which represents Christ as
  saying this very thing, 'Ye shall leave me alone&mdash;and yet I am not
  alone, because the Father is with me.' Look at the matter thus. Do we not
  know that God may be regarded as being in all places at once, so that to
  speak of Him as 'here and not there,' is no less a metaphor than to speak of
  His 'hiding His countenance' or 'bearing us in His arms'? God therefore is,
  as Epictetus often affirms, 'within us.' But is He not also (as I think
  Epictetus seldom or never affirms) 'outside us '? Is not the Psalmist's
  metaphor right when he says that God, being outside us, hides His face
  sometimes from His children? Sometimes He does this because they have sinned,
  in order that they may seek His face and cease to sin. But does He not also
  do this when men have not sinned, in order that the righteous may become more
  righteous and the pure more pure, by longing more than ever for the sight of
  His countenance and by thirsting anew for His presence?</p>

  <p>"I do not quite like to explain the dealings of God with men by anything
  that frail human creatures do in sport. And yet there is something so sacred
  (at least I think so) in the relations between parents and young children,
  that I have been sometimes led to liken God hiding His face from His children
  to a mother hiding her face from the babe in her arms. She hides it, but only
  for a moment, only that the child may be the more joyful afterwards. And the
  arms never let go their embrace." Then, after a pause, he added, "But perhaps
  you say, 'Do not you Christians believe that Christ was already perfectly
  righteous, and perfectly pure, and that He already rejoiced to the utmost in
  the Father's love? Why then should God forsake such a Son? Why should He hide
  His face from the Holy One, even for a time? 'That, I think, is the question
  you would like to ask?"</p>

  <p>Reading assent in my face, he proceeded, "Some might reply that this
  question has been answered by the brother above-mentioned, who says, in
  effect, 'The Son was forsaken by the Father, not that the Son might be made
  purer, or freed from sin, but that He might know the Father's will and might
  prepare Himself for His imminent self-sacrifice.' But is that&mdash;I will
  not say a complete answer, for who will venture to say that he knows
  completely all the purpose of the Father in causing the Son to feel
  forsaken?&mdash;is it even an answer that ought rightly to satisfy us? Will
  you be patient with me, my friend&mdash;for friends we are already (are we
  not?) in our joint search after truth" "We are indeed," said I, "and I would
  gladly hear your fullest thoughts on this matter." " Permit me then," said
  he, "to put another thought before your mind, namely, that the Son of God,
  being Son of man, may have been forsaken by the Father in order to learn, as
  a man, the heights and depths of human nature, and to what an abyss of
  darkness the purest and most faithful saint may sometimes sink; and how even
  in that abyss, the saint may feel, through faith, that there are still
  beneath him the arms of God, not indeed supporting him but ready to support
  him; and that he is&mdash;as the prophets say about Israel&mdash;' forsaken'
  yet 'not forsaken.' No height in saintliness is higher than such a faith as
  this.</p>

  <p>"The scriptures tell us," he continued, "that man is to love God with all
  his heart and with all his soul and with all his power, and with all his
  understanding. You know this?" I nodded assent. "Consider then how you and I
  will feel in the moments or hours before our departure, if God has decreed
  that we shall pass away by a slow and tedious passage, with a gradual
  weakening of our mental and spiritual powers, a chill of the heart, a
  deadening of the understanding, and a fading away of the fire of the soul; so
  that it is no longer possible for us, no longer permitted to us by God
  Himself, to love Him with all our human powers, because our powers themselves
  are becoming powerless. May we not then perhaps feel our grasp on the hand of
  the heavenly Father loosening, and our souls slipping back from the
  supporting strength of His presence, downward, and still downward, into the
  darkness of the infinite abyss? Should that hour of trial come upon us, would
  it not be a very present help in our trouble to know that the Lord, the
  Saviour, the Eternal Son of God, in the form of man, was troubled
  likewise?"</p>

  <p>Indeed I thought it would&mdash;<i>if</i> only I "knew" it. I suppose my
  face must have shown this, for Clemens, without waiting for an answer,
  continued with a kindling countenance, "And now, dearest brother, be still
  more patient with me while I put one more thought before you. You have been
  talking to me about 'trouble' and about your friend's 'trouble ': and you
  said that it made you, as well as your friend, feel 'forsaken'." I assented.
  "And you were not ashamed," he continued, "of feeling his 'trouble' to some
  extent as yours, nor was your friend ashamed of feeling the 'trouble' of his
  family? Well, then, believe me, the Lord Jesus Christ felt the troubles of
  all His disciples, friends, followers, yes, all the troubles of all the
  sinful children of men, as though they were His own troubles. And in feeling
  'troubled' along with others I venture to think that He also felt 'forsaken'
  along with others.</p>

  <p>"This is sacred ground. I fear even to kneel, much less to tread upon it.
  But I think the Lord Jesus meant this also, amidst a multitude of meanings,
  '0 Father, why hast thou forsaken me, making me feel one with the sinners
  whom thou forsakest? Is it that thou art breaking for a time the sensible
  bond between me and thee in order to bind me to them? Is it that I may be
  made one with them, so as to make them one with me? Wouldst thou make me to
  be sin that the world may be made to be righteousness? ' "</p>

  <p>I remembered the words of Paul, " Him that knew not sin God made sin in
  our behalf": but I had never understood them before. Nor did I now, but I
  thought I caught a glimpse of their meaning. It was only a glimpse, and I sat
  silent, afraid as it were to move lest I should lose it. I seemed in a new
  world, or rather, in a mixed world, in which the old and the new were
  contending. I could neither see clearly nor move freely as yet. I felt that
  light and freedom were around and very near, forcing their way towards me, if
  I would but reach out my hand to them. But I could not do it.</p>

  <p>"I feel," said I, "as though, in time, these hard words might become
  intelligible, or rather, I should say, beautiful and full of comfort to me.
  But how different they are from the last words of Socrates!" "Most
  different," replied Clemens. "Often have I pondered on the difference. I was
  born in Athens, and I admire the literature and language of my native city.
  But my mother was of Jewish extraction; and when I worship, and pray, and
  feel sorrow, and seek consolation, it is in the thought and phrase (though
  not in the language) of my mother's people. And again and again have I
  reflected on the strange contrast between the two 'last words,' the Jewish
  and the Greek. These 'last words' represent last thoughts.</p>

  <p>Socrates felt righteous, and happy, and not 'forsaken,' and not at all
  anxious about his friends nor about his doctrine. The Lord Jesus felt
  forsaken&mdash;doubly forsaken. First He sorrowed for His disciples because
  He knew that they would forsake Him; and He prayed for them that they might
  not utterly fail. Afterwards He Himself felt forsaken by the Father.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, so far, Socrates may seem to have the advantage. But what has
  followed? Socrates is enshrined in books, a companion and dear friend of
  students for ever, but in books. He is not for the crowd in the street, nor
  for the ploughman in the field, nor for the poor, the simple, and the
  unlettered. And though he may fortify some of us against the fear of death,
  he does not bring the deepest consolation to those who are suffering under a
  perpetual burden of pains or sorrows. But the Spirit of the Lord Jesus moves
  among all sorts and conditions of life in all the races of mankind, bringing
  joy to them that rejoice righteously, and wholesome sorrow to those that sin,
  and strength to the heavy laden, and comfort to all that mourn, and freedom
  from all servile fear. Yes, He brings freedom, even to those enemies against
  whom He makes war, turning their consciences against themselves and making
  them His willing captives to lead others captive in turn. For indeed this
  captivity is no captivity but an embracing with the arms of a Father revealed
  in the Son according to the words of Hosea 'I taught Ephraim to walk. I took
  him in my arms. He knew not that I healed him. I drew him with cords, with
  bands of love.' Dear friend, it is my firm conviction that those only can
  relieve pain of the heart who have felt pain of the heart. Those only can
  save the forsaken who have felt forsaken. It was in fact because Christ had
  been forsaken that He was enabled to draw Paul towards Him with the cords of
  His constraining love."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "if love was the foundation of Christ's doctrine, how is it
  that Mark hardly ever mentions it? Should I be wrong in saying that Mark
  never mentions 'love' at all except in one place where Jesus, being asked
  what is the greatest commandment, quotes from the scripture the ancient
  commandment to love God and one's neighbour?" "Alas," replied Clemens, "you
  would be only too right! Yet believe me, Christ's doctrine of doctrines was
  'love'&mdash;and that, too, not the old commandment, but a new commandment,
  because Christ introduced into the world a new kind of love, a more powerful
  love, a constraining love. This He imparted through His blood to His
  disciples, as is made clear in this new gospel "&mdash;and here he took a
  roll out of his garment&mdash;" about which I spoke to you lately, and in a
  letter, by the same author, which is an appendix to the gospel." And then he
  read to me, from John's gospel, the words, "A new commandment give I unto you
  that ye love one another," and " By this shall all men know that ye are my
  disciples if ye have love one to another"; and he pointed out the newness and
  greatness of the love, reading the words, "Greater love hath no man than this
  that a man lay down his life for his friends." Lastly, he added, from the
  epistle, "God is love."</p>

  <p>All this astonished me not a little, and I replied, "Here at last, it
  seems to me, we have the only true gospel, Paul's gospel, the gospel of the
  constraining love of Christ. But how came it to pass that, whereas this was
  the true gospel, such a gospel as Mark's, full of marvels, and portents, and
  exorcisms, should be the first published to the world&mdash;so I have been
  told on good authority&mdash;a gospel that gives a whole column to the
  dancing of the daughter of Herodias and not one line to 'love one
  another'?"</p>

  <p>"Often and often," replied Clemens, "have I asked myself the same
  question. I think, though I am not sure, that the reason is this. After the
  resurrection of the Lord, the apostles went forth to the world to attest the
  resurrection, and to preach the gospel, saying, in effect, what we find Peter
  and Paul actually saying in their epistles. But perhaps you have not read
  Peter's epistle?" I had not. "If you had, you would have found that Peter,
  like Paul, teaches this commandment of love. Doubtless all the apostles did
  the same. Consequently, before any gospels were written, all the churches
  were familiar with this doctrine of love, and with the doctrine of the
  resurrection. These were the important things. These had been handed down by
  the apostles to the elders, and by the first generation of the elders to the
  second. These, therefore, the churches knew. But the unimportant things, as
  Paul deemed them, the things that concerned Christ in the flesh, and His
  works of healing and of casting out spirits, and His sayings in the flesh to
  the disciples, and His discussions and controversies with the Pharisees, and
  how He was delivered over to Pilate, and how He suffered this and that
  particular humiliation (such as 'spitting' and 'smiting ') in exact
  accordance with the scriptures&mdash;these things the churches had not
  committed to memory in any kind of detail. These therefore the earliest
  evangelist wrote down. Hence it came to pass that he recorded, in large
  measure, not the most important but the least important things."</p>

  <p>"I understand now," said I, "but is it not to be regretted?" "For all
  reasons but one," replied Clemens, "I think it is to be regretted. I am often
  sorry that Mark does not give us the Lord's Prayer. I suppose he omitted it,
  as being known to everybody. But, as it is, we have two versions, and
  Matthew's is very different from Luke's. A version by Mark might have taught
  us whether the two versions are from one original, or whether the Lord gave
  His disciples two prayers at two different times&mdash;perhaps one before the
  resurrection, one after it. Again, Mark does not give us any account of the
  Lord's resurrection. Some think that a page of the manuscript of his gospel
  was lost. I, too, once thought so; but now I am disposed to think that he
  stopped short here, saying, 'Here begins the testimony of the apostles. It is
  their part to testify to the Lord's resurrection.' In any case it is to be
  regretted."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "your expression, just now, was, 'to be regretted <i>for
  all reasons but one.</i>' What did you mean by that?" "I meant," said
  Clemens, "that if all the evangelists had agreed exactly in their reports of
  all Christ's words, there might have been, amidst many advantages, this one
  disadvantage, the danger that the letter of the words of the Lord might have
  become a second law, like the law of Moses, to be interpreted by lawyers. In
  that case, what the Lord said about divorce, and marriage, and about the
  manner of life of the evangelists, and their sustenance, and about giving up
  or retaining one's possessions&mdash;all these things might have been
  collected into a small code. On this code might have been written a large
  commentary; on that, perhaps, another commentary, still larger. Thus the
  Church of Christ might have drifted into the legalities of men far away from
  the one true law of Christ, as it is defined in Paul's epistles 'Bear ye one
  another's burdens,' and (in the new gospel that I showed you just now) 'Love
  one another with the love with which I have loved you '."</p>

  <p>"Tell me more about that new gospel," said I. "I would gladly do so," said
  Clemens, "if time permitted. But the shadows are lengthening and the hour we
  were to spend together is past. Most willingly would I stay with you, but my
  work calls me away. Tomorrow, however, if you would like to come to my
  lodging in the house of Justus, at the comer of the market-place, soon after
  sunset, I shall have returned to Nicopolis, and you shall have a sight of the
  new gospel and such aid as I can give you in explaining it." So we parted for
  the time, after I had eagerly accepted his invitation.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31">XXXI. &mdash; CLEMENS ON THE FOURTH GOSPEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"HOW many things I should have asked him if he could only
  have stayed!" was my first thought, as Clemens disappeared behind the bushes.
  My next thought was, "How many new things I already have to think about!"
  Mechanically I turned homewards and took a few steps on the way to the city.
  Then I sat down to reflect.</p>

  <p>Not many minutes had elapsed before I heard footsteps behind me.
  Presently, a little on my left, Clemens, without noticing me, passed striding
  hastily onwards in the direction of Nicopolis. I called to him. He turned and
  came up to me with an exclamation of joy, "I am thankful to have found you so
  soon. It has been on my mind that I ought to have at least explained to you
  why I did not offer to lend you this new gospel." " I would not have lent it
  to anyone had I been in your place," said I. "Yes," said Clemens, "you would
  have. Trust me, dear friend, if you believed this gospel, as I do, you would
  long to lend it to those who did not as yet believe it. But the truth is, I
  did not wish to lend it to you without a few words of introduction, for which
  I feared there would be no time. I forgot that the moonlight would suffIce to
  guide me to the end of my journey. Have you leisure and desire for a little
  more conversation? Without it, I fear this little book might make you
  stumble, might even repel you. It is entirely different from the other three
  gospels both in its style and in its language. Whether reporting Christ's
  sayings or relating His actions, it almost always differs from the earlier
  accounts. It is also largely different in the facts related. What say
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I say 'Thanks' with all my heart," replied I; then, as we sat down
  together, "May I ask first, who wrote it?" "You not only may, but ought," he
  replied. "It is just the question I expected from you, and, alas! just one of
  the questions that I cannot answer in the usual way by saying 'A the son of
  B.' It seems to hint the authorship in dark expressions. At the end of the
  book it says, 'This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things and
  he that wrote these things'; but the texts vary and it is not quite clear
  whether the 'writer' and the 'bearer of witness' are one and the same. Nor
  does it give any name to the witness or the writer, nor any means of
  ascertaining the name or names, except that it describes him, a little
  before, as being 'the disciple whom Jesus loved, who also leaned on His
  breast,' <i>i.e.</i> at the last supper. Also, going back further, I find it
  written concerning a certain flow of blood and water from the side of the
  Saviour on the cross, 'He that hath seen hath borne witness and his witness
  is true, and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye may believe.' Going back
  further still, and comparing the beginning with the end of the gospel, the
  reader is led indirectly to the conclusion that the disciple that 'hath borne
  witness' is John the son of Zebedee.</p>

  <p>"This John is often referred to as one of the chief apostles, in the three
  gospels; but his name is not so much as once mentioned in the fourth.
  Whenever 'John' occurs in this gospel, it is always John the Baptist, even
  though 'Baptist' is not added. Not till the last chapter does it become clear
  that the author is one of the 'sons of Zebedee.'" "But might it not be
  James?" said I. "It might," replied Clemens, "but for the following fact. The
  gospel goes on to say, in effect, that, whereas Peter was to be crucified
  hereafter, this disciple was to live so long that a report sprang up in the
  church that he would never die. Now this could not apply to James, as he was
  beheaded quite early in the history of the church. It follows therefore that
  the author was John, who, though he became a martyr, or witness, for the
  Saviour, survived his martyrdom and lived to a great age."</p>

  <p>This seemed to me an unsatisfactory way of writing history, and not quite
  fair to readers. For ought they not to be partly guided, in their judgment of
  the historian's statements, by their knowledge of his character, and of his
  opportunities for obtaining information?" How much more satisfactory," said
  I, "is the honest straightforwardness of the Greek writer, 'This is the third
  year of the history that Thucydides compiled.'" "You are right," replied
  Clemens, "I cannot deny it. It would have been more satisfactory&mdash;if it
  could have been written with truth&mdash;that we should read at the end of
  this little roll, 'I John, the son of Zebedee, wrote this work.' But what if
  he did not write it yet had a great part in originating it? What if there was
  some kind of joint production, revision, or correction, of the work, so that
  it would not have been true to say, 'I John wrote it'?"</p>

  <p>"Is there any evidence of this?" I asked. "A little," he replied. "It is
  the only one of the four gospels that contains 'we' in its conclusion, thus,
  'We know that his testimony is true.' I have also heard a tradition that it
  was revealed to Andrew that John was to write the gospel and that his
  fellow-disciples and bishops should revise it. But the following is more
  important evidence: John the son of Zebedee wrote a book called the
  Apocalypse&mdash;have you seen it?" I said that I had glanced at it. "It was
  written when he was a very old man, after he had been sent to the mines in
  Patmos by Domitian, and it is written in, I will not say bad Greek, but a
  dialect of Greek entirely different from that of any of the gospels or
  epistles. Now the fourth gospel is written in very fair Greek and in a style
  as different as possible from that of the Apocalypse. It is quite impossible
  that John, after writing the Apocalypse when he was eighty or ninety, should
  then write a gospel in a style so absolutely different."</p>

  <p>"Then why," said I, "should the gospel be called by his name?" "I explain
  it thus," said Clemens. "When John returned from Patmos a very old man, saved
  from the fiery trial of the sufferings he had undergone&mdash;both before his
  condemnation and also afterwards in the mines&mdash;it was natural that every
  word uttered by him should be treasured up. I have heard it said that he
  could hardly be carried into the church, and that, when there, he repeated
  nothing but 'Little children, love one another.' In time, the brethren grew
  weary of this and remonstrated with him. This seems to have gone on for a
  long while. For (as I have said above) a report was current about him that he
  would 'never die' but would wait for the Lord's coming. There is no record
  (known to me) of any time, place, or manner, of his departure. I infer that,
  during the period of his decrepitude, the brethren at Ephesus would collect
  traditions from him and preach his gospel for him as far as they could.
  Afterwards, when it was clear that he would die, the gospel would be reduced
  to writing." "But this," said I, "greatly lowers the value of the gospel as
  history." "It does," said he, "and its historical value may also be lowered
  by the fact that, even before the gospel was written, the apostle was a great
  seer of visions. A seer is not the best kind of historian. He is liable to
  mix vision with fact. Especially might this be done by a seer that had seen
  Christ both before and after Christ's death. But still I greatly value this
  gospel because, like the epistles of Paul, it seems to me to go to the root
  of the matter. I told you just now that the old man, when he could say
  nothing else, repeated over and over again the words 'Little children, love
  one another.' When they asked him to say something else, he said 'that was
  enough.' And the old man was right. It is 'enough '&mdash;if we can receive
  strength to do it."</p>

  <p>"This greatly attracts me," said I. "But, if your explanation is true, a
  great deal depends upon the apostle's friend, or friends, who wrote down the
  substance of his traditions and arranged them as a gospel." "A great deal, as
  you say," replied Clemens. "I have been informed that there was a great
  teacher near Ephesus, who was called preeminently '<i>the Elder</i>'&mdash;a
  name given, I believe, by students to their teacher, even in some of the
  schools of the Stoics. Has that ever fallen within your experience?"
  "Something of the kind," I replied. "I remember that Epictetus lately spoke
  of himself as '<i>the Elder.</i>' It seemed to me a modest way of saying 'I
  whom you call your Teacher, or your Master, but I merely call myself your
  Elder.' He said we ought to be so superior to the fear of death that his
  great business ought to be to keep us from dying too soon, not to make us
  fearless of death. 'This,' he said, 'ought to engage the attention of <i>the
  Elder</i> sitting in this chair.' And then he added, 'This ought to be the
  great struggle of <i>your Teacher</i> and <i>Trainer</i>, if indeed you had
  such a one'&mdash;as though Elder and Teacher were much the same thing."</p>

  <p>"That," said Clemens, "is exactly to the point. Well then, you must know
  that John the son of Zebedee is commonly supposed to have written not only a
  gospel but also an epistle, or perhaps three epistles. The first epistle is
  quite in the style of the gospel, but it mentions not 'John,' nor even 'I,'
  at the beginning, but 'we,' 'That which we have heard.' The two other
  letters, which are very short, begin, '<i>The Elder</i> to so-and-so.' These
  two letters are in style similar to that of the first, but some doubt exists
  as to their authorship, and I have seen it written, in connexion with them,
  that the Wisdom of Solomon was not written by Solomon but 'by his friends to
  do him honour.' Whoever wrote that, seems to have believed that '<i>the
  Elder</i>' mentioned in the two epistles was not John the son of Zebedee but
  one of his 'friends'."</p>

  <p>"What was the Elder's name?" said I. "The two epistles do not mention it,"
  replied Clemens. "But the Elder near Ephesus of whom I spoke above, was
  called by the same name as the son of Zebedee, 'John'; and the tradition that
  mentions him (along with another teacher named Aristion) appears to
  distinguish the two Johns, mentioning both in the same sentence. I ought to
  add that I mentioned this same Elder above as defending Mark on the ground
  that he was the mere interpreter of Peter. 'Mark,' said the Elder, 'made it
  his single object to leave out nothing of the things that he heard and to say
  nothing that was false therein.' Now you will find&mdash;I think I have
  already mentioned the fact&mdash;that this new gospel frequently intervenes,
  where Luke omits, or alters, anything that is in Mark, so as to explain
  Mark's obscurity or set forth Mark's tradition in different language. This
  points to the conclusion that the writer of the fourth gospel agreed with the
  Elder called John in his verdict on Mark, which is, in effect, 'Not erroneous
  in fact though imperfect in expression.' My own belief is that this tradition
  about two persons of the same name is accurate; and that, besides John the
  Apostle, there was also the Elder John, residing in or near Ephesus about the
  same time."</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "might not 'John the elder' naturally be taken to mean
  'older in age' as opposed to 'John the younger'? And is it not strange that,
  in view of the great age of John the Apostle, such a distinctive appellation
  should be given to his namesake?" "Perhaps it would be," replied Clemens.
  "But it is not given. Have you not noticed that I did not speak of '<i>John
  the Elder</i>' but of '<i>the Elder, John</i>'? The two are quite different.
  The former (at least among Christians) would simply mean 'John the Presbyter
  or Elder' as distinct from 'John the Deacon,' 'John the Bishop,' and so on.
  But 'the Elder, John'&mdash;a phrase twice repeated in my tradition&mdash;may
  imply that the teacher was known during his life among his pupils as '<i>the
  Elder</i>,' and that, after his death, 'John' was added for the sake of
  clearness. I believe it was the custom to describe the elders near Ephesus in
  this indefinite way."</p>

  <p>The view here taken by Clemens has been somewhat confirmed of late years
  by a practice that I have noticed&mdash;a bad practice, I think&mdash;in the
  young Irenaeus. In the course of his lectures, when referring to his
  authority&mdash;instead of mentioning an elder by name, Polycarp, Aristion,
  Papias, John, as the case may be&mdash;he used such expressions as "He that
  is greater than we are," "The divine old man and herald of the truth," "He
  that is superior to us," and all these, as far as I could gather, about
  elders in the province of Ephesus. Concerning this indefiniteness I am in the
  same mind now as I was when I replied to Clemens, "It is very
  unfortunate."</p>

  <p>"It is," said he, "but I believe it is fact. Well then, according to my
  view, one particular elder of these Johannine elders&mdash;I mean the elders
  in the region of Ephesus collected round the aged apostle, John the son of
  Zebedee&mdash;was so much superior to the rest that he was called
  preeminently '<i>the</i> Elder.' If 'the Elder' preached and wrote for John
  the Apostle, and if the Elder's name was John, there would be an additional
  reason why the writer of the gospel would avoid the name John (except in
  connexion with John the Baptist) throughout the gospel.</p>

  <p>"But my conviction is that the aged apostle, besides preferring oral
  tradition to books (as you will see from the last lines of his work), shrank
  from putting himself forward as the author by the name of 'John,' and
  insisted that, if he was to be mentioned at all, it was to be only by the
  title, 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.' John the Elder may have accepted this
  condition because he felt it to express a deep truth&mdash;namely, that the
  Lord Jesus is best known through some one whom He has loved.</p>

  <p>"You know how carefully the Greeks distinguish 'voice' or 'sound' from
  'word.' Well, this new gospel introduces John the Baptist as testifying to
  Christ and saying that he was a mere voice, 'I am the <i>voice</i> of one
  crying in the wilderness. <i>Make straight the way of the Lord!'</i> To the
  inferior and preparatory witness is given a distinctive name 'John' The
  superior and perfected witness was also called 'John' after the flesh ; but
  the writer of the gospel preferred that the name after the flesh should be
  dropped, yes, and even his distinctive personality merged, as it were, in the
  title, 'the disciple whom Jesus loved.'"</p>

  <p>"But you spoke, above, about 'brethren' as perhaps preaching John's gospel
  for him during his decrepitude. Now you seem to incline to think that only
  one man wrote it?" "Yes," replied Clemens, "I used ' brethren 'first, to
  leave the question open. Then I endeavoured to give reasons for thinking it
  was one brother; and this conclusion is supported by the style. There are
  some slight differences in this gospel between the words of the Lord and the
  words of the evangelist, in respect of style. That is natural; indeed, one
  would expect many more. But, taken as a whole, the gospel does not show many
  styles, as Luke's does, but only one style&mdash;extending to the words of
  all characters introduced in the book, so that it is sometimes hard to say
  where a speaker ceases to speak and the evangelist begins to comment."</p>

  <p>"But this is surely astonishing," said I, "that the author should have so
  little regard for the words of the Lord as not to make it absolutely and
  always clear where they end, and where his own comments, or the words of
  someone else, begin."</p>

  <p>"It is astonishing," said Clemens, "but I am disposed to think that John
  the Apostle himself may in some cases have left his friends in doubt; and the
  Elder&mdash;or whoever it was that wrote the gospel&mdash;may have thought it
  best to leave the ambiguity as he found it. I pointed out to you above how
  the differences between the three gospels had this advantage that they forced
  the reader to think of the spirit rather than the letter of the words of the
  Lord. But they also had a danger, namely, that men might be puzzling their
  brains as to the differences of scribes and reporters instead of refreshing
  their hearts with the Spirit of Christ. Now if the Elder had, so to speak,
  simply added a fourth parallel column to the three existing parallel columns
  of the sayings of the Lord, the result might have been to increase that
  danger.</p>

  <p>"You may say that if the Elder felt sure that he had received the exactly
  correct form of the Lord s words from John the Apostle, he ought to have set
  them down thus, whatever might be the consequences. But I do not believe that
  he did feel sure. More probably he knew that it was impossible, from the old
  man's reminiscences, to restore the words exactly, as uttered by Jesus, and
  that it was best not to attempt a restoration, but to prefer paraphrase,
  giving their spiritual essence. Or else, in cases where the three evangelists
  differed seriously among themselves, the Elder might think it best to
  substitute an entirely new tradition on the same subject."</p>

  <p>"Is it not possible," said I, "that some part of the gospel may have been
  written at an earlier date? Are there for example any expressions that show
  the Temple to have been still standing at the time of writing?" "I have
  looked through the volume, searching for such evidence," replied Clemens,
  "and can find absolutely nothing except a phrase in a rather obscure and
  corrupt passage about the existence of a pool, an intermittent pool, near
  Jerusalem. Now of course a pool is not destroyed even when a neighbouring
  city is utterly destroyed; and parts of Jerusalem continued to be inhabited,
  after its capture by Titus, although the walls, and a large part of the city,
  were razed to the ground. The gospel says, 'There is in Jerusalem a pool...
  having five porches.' I have not ascertained whether this pool is still used
  (as the narrative says it was then) for medicinal purposes, and whether the
  'porches' still exist. I must also confess my belief that this is one of
  several narratives in which perhaps allegory may have modified history. But
  in any case the phrase 'there is a pool' seems to me to afford no basis,
  worth calling such, for a hypothesis of date. It seems to me of little more
  importance than if a writer said 'There <i>is</i> a mountain called the Mount
  of Olives' or 'There <i>is</i> a brook called Kedron.' I could, if you liked,
  discuss the passage with you more fully."</p>

  <p>"Let me rather ask you," said I, "about a matter that greatly interests
  me. The words of Christ at the last supper&mdash;does John give them as Mark
  and Matthew do, or as Luke, or as Paul?" "That is a case," said Clemens,
  "where John does not correct but substitutes. He does not give these words at
  all. But he inserts a narrative about Christ's washing the feet of the
  disciples, and a precept that the disciples are to do the same. The 'washing
  of feet,' as I could show you if time allowed, is connected with sacrifice,
  in Leviticus. As to the partaking of the bread and wine, he says expressly
  that the Saviour gave some of it to Judas&mdash;meaning (I think) to show
  that there was no efficacy for good in the food, apart from faith and
  love."</p>

  <p>"And what," I asked, "as to the words about 'forsaking' uttered on the
  cross, where Luke again differs from Mark and Matthew?" "Here," replied
  Clemens, "I do not feel sure whether John introduces a new saying altogether,
  or gives the substance of the old saying in Mark. Certainly he does not agree
  with Luke. And let me add that I have examined a great number of passages
  where words of Mark, being obscure or difficult, are altered or omitted by
  Luke, and I find that in almost every case John intervenes to support
  Mark&mdash;only expressing Mark's meaning more clearly and spiritually.</p>

  <p>"Concerning the 'forsaking,' I suggested to you before that it is a
  metaphor. If so, the reality may be expressed by other metaphors in the
  scriptures, such as 'I have lost the light of thy countenance,' 'I am cast
  away from the joy of thy presence,' 'My soul is deprived of the fountain of
  thy light.' The Psalms say, 'God, my God... my soul is athirst for thee,' and
  again, 'My soul thirsteth for God... when shall I come and appear before
  God?' The 'thirst' implies absence from God. It will be satisfied by 'coming'
  to God. Well, John represents Jesus as saying, 'I thirst,' in accomplishment
  of 'the scriptures.' Then (as I take it) the soldiers misunderstand this
  thirst as meaning simply literal thirst. They offer Christ vinegar. Christ
  'took it,' says the gospel. Then He said, 'It is finished' and 'rested His
  head'&mdash;that is to say, on the bosom of the Father, and 'delivered over
  His spirit '."</p>

  <p>"'Rested His head' is a strange expression," said I. "It is," said
  Clemens, "but it occurs in Matthew and Luke as follows, 'The Son of man hath
  not where to rest His head,' meaning 'He hath no home, no resting-place, on
  earth, but only with the Father above.' One of the ablest Greek scholars
  among the brethren assures me that John also uses the phrase to mean this;
  and I believe it is not used in Greek in any other sense. So, too, 'delivered
  over His spirit' signifies that in the supreme moment the 'delivering over'
  of the Suffering Servant was not passive but active. He delivered Himself
  over. But I ought to add that, in Aramaic, the same verb means (in different
  forms) 'finish,' 'deliver over,' and&mdash;the word used here by Mark and
  Luke&mdash;' expire '."</p>

  <p>Scaurus had said something of this kind concerning the three gospels, and
  had argued that it increased the difficulty of ascertaining what Christ
  actually said. But I had supposed that it would not extend to a gospel
  written in a Greek city like Ephesus and so long after the other gospels,
  when Greek traditions might be expected to predominate. I was depressed by
  this frank avowal on the part of Clemens, and remained in silence for a
  moment or two weighing its consequences.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32">XXXII. &mdash; CLEMENS LENDS SILANUS THE FOURTH
     GOSPEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CLEMENS waited patiently for me to resume our conversation.
  Soon it occurred to me that I had been unreasonable in my expectations if the
  circumstances were as he had described them. Suppose this new gospel to have
  originated from the reminiscences of John the son of Zebedee, a fisherman of
  Galilee, and the aged author of such a book as the Apocalypse. How could such
  traditions, if set down exactly as they came from the old man's lips, fail to
  abound in Jewish phrases and thoughts such as I had met with in the
  apocalyptic work? But these would have made the gospel very unsuitable for
  Greeks and Romans and indeed for almost all except Jews. It was therefore
  natural, and indeed almost necessary, that the old man's recollections, after
  being imparted to his friends, who would probably be the elders of Ephesus,
  should be freely interpreted, or perhaps paraphrased, in a form fit for all
  readers. Such interpreters, or such an interpreter, might not always be
  perfectly successful.</p>

  <p>It was foolish of me not to have foreseen this. But still I was
  disappointed. "This," said I, "adds a new element of uncertainty, if John has
  sometimes preserved traditions of Christ's words translated from the Jewish
  tongue." "It does," said Clemens, "and so does another fact that applies both
  to Greek and to Hebrew or Aramaic. You know that, in Greek, 'he <i>said</i>'
  or '<i>used to say</i>' or 'it <i>says</i>,' often signifies 'he
  <i>meant</i>' or 'it <i>means</i>.' The same is true in Hebrew. Hence if an
  evangelist or scribe, after giving Christ's actual words, for example, '<i>Do
  righteousness,</i>' were to add 'But he meant, <i>Do alms</i>'&mdash;because,
  in Hebrew, 'righteousness' often means 'alms'&mdash;it would be possible to
  misinterpret the addition as meaning 'But he [also] <i>said</i> (or, <i>used
  to say</i>) <i>Do alms</i>,' thus erroneously creating a second precept. For
  these and other reasons I cannot feel sure that the saying 'I thirst,' about
  which we were just now conversing, may not be a paraphrase of the Lord's
  words about being ' forsaken.' John the son of Zebedee may have known that
  the latter words were misunderstood from the first by the soldiers, and also
  that they were misinterpreted by some Christians. Hence I think the aged
  apostle may have prayed for a revelation as to the true meaning of the words,
  and it may have been revealed to him, 'The Lord said&mdash;that is. He really
  said. His real meaning was&mdash;that He "<i>thirsted</i>". This indeed would
  be a surprise or paradox compared with what the gospel says elsewhere. But
  the scriptures are full of such paradoxes."</p>

  <p>"But how 'elsewhere'?" said I. "Do you mean that here Christ feels thirst
  whereas 'elsewhere' He quenches thirst? I do not remember that." "I forgot,"
  replied Clemens, "that you had not read the new gospel. That gospel
  represents Christ as saying to a sinful woman, 'Give me to drink,' and
  afterwards, to the same woman, 'He that believeth on me shall never thirst,'
  and, after that, to the Jews, 'If any one be athirst, let him come unto me
  and drink.' This same gospel says that the 'food' of the Son is to do the
  will of the Father. This, then, may be described as His meat and drink. If,
  therefore, He 'thirsts,' He is athirst to do the Father's will, so that He
  hungers and thirsts for righteousness in the souls of sinful men and women,
  thirsting to free them from thirst by giving them the water of life. All
  through His life He has not thirsted because the living water has been
  passing freely from the Father to Him and from Him to others. But now, on the
  point of death, the Giver of the water of life is Himself caused to thirst
  for it! The Father, in His infinite love, causes the Son Himself to thirst
  for that love! Instead of helping others, the Son is constrained to ask as it
  were to be helped&mdash;in order that He may help others better. This is
  perhaps the deepest and most wonderful of all the Lord's deep
  sayings&mdash;</p>

  <p>'I thirst for the righteousness and love of God, that I and mine may be in
  the Father, and that the Father may be in me and mine.' In the end, this will
  be one of the Lord's words that will never pass away. But what was its effect
  at the time? When Socrates uttered his last wishes, Crito was at hand to say,
  'This shall be done' But when Christ cried 'I thirst,' no friend was at hand
  to satisfy that thirst, and the cry was taken by the soldiers as meaning, 'I
  thirst for a little of your sour wine'!"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," said I, "that you regard this gospel, not exactly as
  history, but as history mingled with poetry or with vision?" "Not quite so,"
  said Clemens. "I should prefer to say, 'as history <i>interpreted</i> through
  spiritual insight or poetic vision.' I take the historical fact to be that
  there came into the world, as man, a divine Being, endowed with a power of
  drawing man and God into one, by drawing the hearts of men towards Himself,
  and, through Himself, to the Father. Making men one with Himself, He also
  made them one with each other in Himself. This is the great historical fact,
  the fact of facts, foreordained before the foundation of the world. This,
  then, is the fact that needs to be brought out clearly in the history of
  Christ&mdash;not the facts (though they are facts) that the Pharisees often
  washed their hands and that the daughter of Herodias danced before John the
  Baptist was beheaded. Well, then, put yourself in the position
  of&mdash;whoever it was that wrote this fourth gospel, say, 'the Elder.'
  Imagine him returning fresh from an interview with the old man John, the son
  of Zebedee, who will not allow himself to be called a 'son of
  thunder'&mdash;."</p>

  <p>"But why," said I, "should he not have allowed himself to be called John
  the son of Zebedee? And why should he object to be called one of the sons of
  thunder, if Jesus called him so?" "As to the latter name," replied Clemens,
  "I very much doubt whether Mark has translated the term correctly; I will
  tell you why, another time: but assuredly he was not a noisy 'son of thunder'
  as we should understand the phrase in the west.</p>

  <p>"As to the former name, you will find in this gospel that 'Simon son of
  John' is thrice mentioned as Peter's name, in a passage where Peter is
  rebuked for having denied his Master. It is, so to speak, his name after the
  flesh, his unregenerate name. 'Peter,' or 'stone,' is his regenerate name.
  So, '<i>John son of Zebedee</i>' would be this disciple's unregenerate name.
  The fourth gospel never uses that name except once, in the phrase 'the sons
  of Zebedee,' on the same occasion on which Peter is rebuked as '<i>Simon son
  of John</i>,' For the most part John the son of Zebedee is described (in this
  gospel) as 'the other disciple'&mdash;that is, the one as yet unheard, the
  one whose testimony is still to be given. Or else, the name is connected with
  Christ's love&mdash;' the disciple that Jesus loved.' He feels that he owes
  all that he has, his very being, to the fact that Jesus loved him, that Jesus
  made him what he now is. Moreover Jesus gave him, by perpetual visions after
  His death, an insight into the meanings of His words uttered before death.
  Hence he might feel that Christ's words, once dark sayings, have now become
  clear. From being old, they have become quite new, so as to require an
  altogether new record."</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," said I, "that I understand your meaning. Do you hold that
  the fourth gospel differs from the three because of the special character of
  John the son of Zebedee, or because of the special interpretation of 'the
  Elder'?" "Because of both," said Clemens. " Then," said I, "you think that
  John the son of Zebedee, far from being a 'son of thunder' in the sense in
  which Pericles might be so called by Aristophanes, was a man of a retiring
  and vision-seeing nature, who merged himself in Christ; and that his
  namesake, the Elder, believed that the aged apostle was as it were a mirror,
  in whom, and in whose traditions, it was possible to discern more of Christ's
  real expression than in the ancient document of Mark."</p>

  <p>"That comes near the truth, I think," replied Clemens. "And yet I should
  be very far from denying that Mark, and the other early gospels, are right in
  several features apparently omitted by John&mdash;for example, Christ's love
  of 'the little ones,' and His anxiety lest they should be caused to stumble,
  and His insistence on the necessity of receiving the Kingdom of God as little
  children. But it seems to me that some of these precepts about 'little ones'
  may have been misunderstood so that the brethren needed Paul's warning, 'Be
  <i>not little children</i> in your minds,' and again, 'In malice be babes,
  but <i>in understanding be men</i>,' The root of all these precepts was the
  divine feeling of 'littleness,' or 'childhood,' or 'sonship.' This is
  realised in the Son of God doing the will of the Father. In order to do that
  will on earth. He must be always keeping His eyes on the Father in heaven.
  The earlier gospels represent Christ with His eyes fixed on the 'little ones'
  on earth, the sick, the sorrowful, the ignorant, the sinful. That also is
  true. The new gospel appears to me to attempt to show how the two truths are
  combined."</p>

  <p>"But you surely do not mean to say," I exclaimed, "that Jesus, in the new
  gospel, never makes mention of the 'little ones' or the 'little children,' so
  frequently mentioned by the earlier evangelists!" "I do indeed," replied
  Clemens. "He does not make mention of either term once, except that, after
  the resurrection, seeing the disciples engaged in labour that has lasted
  through the night and effected nothing, He calls to them and says 'Little
  children!' But yet, although He does not elsewhere use the word 'children,'
  He has the thought constantly before Him. At the beginning of the gospel. He
  teaches that men must be '<i>born from above</i>' that is, become little
  children in the eyes of God. Towards the end, He uses a mother's word to them
  ('<i>teknia</i>' 'darlings'). He also says, 'I will not leave you
  <i>orphans</i>' and declares that His disciples are to be in Himself, the
  Son. Now to be in the Son, means to be made 'a little child' in the perfect
  sense of Christ's meaning."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said I, "this explains why Paul seldom mentions the word
  'little children'." "'Seldom'," said Clemens, "is not the right word. Paul
  <i>never</i> mentions it, except in the warning I mentioned above. Moreover
  John, in his epistle, says, 'I have written unto you little children,
  <i>because ye have known the Father</i>,' That word 'known' goes to the root
  of the matter. The essence of 'little childhood,' in Christ's sense, is
  <i>not ignorance but knowledge</i>&mdash;'knowing the Father.' And 'knowing
  the Father' implies loving the Father, or desiring the Father.</p>

  <p>There are cases where 'desire' may perhaps be well substituted for 'love'
  so as to indicate that kind of love which leads one onwards to the object
  desired. This gospel seems to me to attempt to express&mdash;if I may so
  speak in accordance with the prophets of Israel&mdash;a desire of God for
  man, producing a desire of man for God. The work of the Son of God is to
  unite these two desires. This is a great mystery, a mystery past mere logic,
  that God, the Creator, should 'desire.' Yet I accept it&mdash;as it has been
  expressed by a certain holy woman of Athens, whom I verily believe to have
  been inspired by God, 'The Son of God chose to be lifted up upon the tree of
  the Cross that we might receive the food of angels. And what is this food of
  angels? It is the desire of God, which draws to itself the desire that is in
  the depths of the soul and they make one thing together'."</p>

  <p>This saying was beyond me at the time. But I felt that it contained truth,
  and that I should grow into some apprehension of it. And what Clemens had
  said, though very strange at first, had been gradually growing to seem
  possible and even reasonable, if one may use the word concerning that which
  accords with the spiritual Logos&mdash;namely, that the Son of God, being
  human, was caused to feel forsaken by God, and to desire God, and to ask why
  this strange feeling of forsakenness, this unwonted, unsatisfied desire, was
  brought upon Him by the Father. Then, according to the saying of this holy
  woman of Athens, the answer of the Father was, "In receiving this
  forsakenness and this desire for my presence, thou art receiving from me my
  desire, which draws up to me thy desire, and they two make one together."</p>

  <p>But to return to Clemens, whom I began to trust all the more because I
  felt that he was keeping back nothing from me. "What I am attempting," said
  he, "to express, but expressing very feebly, is this. I am trying to put
  myself in the position of the Elder, preaching the gospel for John the son of
  Zebedee in Ephesus, some time after the aged apostle returned from his
  martyrdom in Patmos, when he was quite decrepit and no longer able to be
  carried into the midst of the congregation, to utter even a few words. If I
  came into that old man's presence and heard from him traditions about the
  Master, whom he loved and who loved him, I might say, 'Here indeed is a
  revelation of Christ. Here I feel Christ Himself' Nevertheless, on going out,
  I might find it very hard to make a chronological and consecutive history out
  of his utterances. Sometimes he might be describing past fact; sometimes he
  might be prophesying the future; sometimes he might speak of the past as if
  still present&mdash;as though he were even now with his Master in Cana or
  Jerusalem; sometimes he might be rapt in a present ecstasy; sometimes he
  might be describing ecstatic visions of the past; sometimes he might speak in
  poetic metaphor, sometimes in literal prose; but always he would be
  penetrated and imbued with the love of Christ. The result&mdash;for me, I
  confess it&mdash;would be that I should go out, thinking, 'This is not
  history in the common sense of the term. But it is something, I will not say
  better, but more needed by the church, than a mere history of facts such as a
  writer like Mark could have given with fuller information. It gives glimpses
  into a divine and human personality that includes in itself a real
  history&mdash;a history of a great invisible war of good against evil, a
  great invisible redemption, God coming down to earth to lift man up to heaven
  '."</p>

  <p>"But," said I, "do not Matthew and Luke give these glimpses in their
  description of the incarnation?" "I should rather have said," replied
  Clemens, "that, instead of giving glimpses, they attempt to describe a
  spiritual fact in the language of material history. John, you will find, does
  not make this attempt. He simply says that 'the Logos became flesh.' Then he
  introduces disciples believing in their Master as Messiah, undeterred by
  their supposition that He is 'the son of Joseph' and 'from Nazareth.' John
  assumes all through his gospel that Jesus came down from heaven and is to go
  up thither again. He refuses to recognise that this coming down and this
  going up are impossible for the Son of God incarnate as the son of Joseph.
  All this appears to me true. And in many respects I admire this little book
  more than I can find time or words to express. Yet I must deal frankly with
  you and confess that this new gospel, like the rest, appears to me
  inadequate. What gospel would be othenvise? All the written records of
  Christ's words and acts seem to me to have, as their main use, the awakening
  in us of a want of something more, a sense of something insufficient and
  imperfect and unjust to the reality, so that we cry vehemently to God for the
  reality, the living truth, the spiritual light&mdash;such light as no words
  or books can give us. The Spirit alone can bestow it, crying within us Abba,
  Father. Some interpreters, however, seem in a special degree to have 'the
  mind of Christ.' Among the foremost of these seems to me to stand 'the
  disciple whom Jesus loved'."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said I, "at least I think I do, a little. You mean that
  the written biographies must first make the reader feel that they are dead in
  comparison with the living person. Then the reader is to feel drawn towards
  his ideal of the living person, and more and more drawn, so that in the end
  ." "In the end," said Clemens, "assuredly the living Person will come to him,
  or draw him to Himself, if he will but be patient in waiting, walking
  according to the light he already has." On this he rose to depart. "One word
  more," said I. "You told me that John gives nearly a quarter of his gospel to
  the doctrine of the Lord on the night on which He was delivered over. Does he
  give much space to the period after the resurrection? And what does he say
  about that? Does he agree with Matthew and Luke?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Clemens, "he differs greatly, and, as it appears to me,
  deliberately, intending to correct them. For example, Matthew represents
  certain women as taking hold of Christ's feet, before He sends them to carry
  word to His 'brethren.' John says that Jesus said to Mary Magdalene, 'Touch
  me not for I am not yet ascended to my Father,' and then sends her to His
  'brethren.' Luke says that Christ said to all the disciples, 'Handle me,' to
  show that He was not a bodiless spirit. John says that an offer of this
  nature was made to Thomas, but mentions no such offer to any other disciple.
  Luke says that the disciples gave Jesus food and He ate. John says that Jesus
  gave food to the disciples. In all these points John appears to me to be
  nearer than Matthew and Luke to the truth. And sometimes I think that the
  touching of Christ's body by the disciples in the Eucharist, that is to say,
  the touching of the bread and tasting of the wine in our sacred meal, has
  been taken by Luke (if not by Matthew) in a literal sense "&mdash;here
  Clemens agreed with Scaurus&mdash;" whereas John understood the meaning
  correctly. But at the same time I think that the Saviour may have been
  visibly present at the Eucharist, showing the wounds in His body, though it
  was not a body that could be touched."</p>

  <p>"Does it not seem to you," I asked, "that this agrees better with Paul's
  descriptions of the manifestations of Jesus after death?" "Yes," said
  Clemens, "and in other respects John seems to me to be nearer the truth. For
  he apparently represents Christ as having ascended to the Father before He
  could be 'touched,' that is to say, before His spiritual body and blood could
  be imparted to the disciples. Moreover, whereas Matthew places before the
  Resurrection a tradition relating how Christ imparts to the disciples
  authority to bind and to loose <i>i.e.</i> to forgive sins, John places it
  afterwards. And John also describes Peter as plunging into the water and
  coming to Jesus after the Resurrection,&mdash;which seems to me a symbol of
  Peter passing through the waters of temptation to the Saviour whom he had
  denied. But Matthew places it before the Resurrection and takes it literally,
  as though Peter tried to walk on literal water and was nearly drowned, but
  for the Lord's help."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, after a long pause&mdash;for I was not prepared to find
  Clemens so far in agreement with Scaurus, an unbeliever, concerning the facts
  of the Christian histories&mdash;"you are very far indeed from saying, 'I
  believe in every word of the gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke, as being
  historically accurate.' Nay, I can hardly think you would say that, even
  about the gospel of John?" "Assuredly," he replied, "I would not say that
  about any of the gospels. Indeed, dear friend, do you yourself think you
  would venture to say as much as that, even about the history of your
  favourite Thucydides? And does it not seem to you that, in any book that
  describes the life of a man, the greater the man, and the more living the
  life, the greater must be the failure of the book, and the deadness of the
  book, as compared with the inexpressible spirit, not to be expressed in any
  book, no, not in a universe of books?"</p>

  <p>Then, rising, and pointing seaward, "Look!" he said, "the moon is up
  already! Now indeed I must stay with you no longer. I have done my best to
  deal fairly with you, even to the point perhaps of being not quite fair to
  this little book, which I now hold in my hand, and am about to place in
  yours, if you desire it. But are you sure that you do still desire it? If you
  do indeed, I shall most gladly lend it, and you can return it to me, this
  time to-morrow, at the house of Justus. But be honest with me as I have tried
  to be with you. Do not take it as yet if you are not prepared to read it as a
  book that comes from the east through a western medium; a book that mingles,
  so as not always to be clearly distinguished, words of the Lord with words of
  the evangelist, facts and visions, histories and prophecies, metaphors that
  may be misunderstood, and poems that may be taken as literal prose. It will
  make you feel perhaps irritated, certainly unsatisfied. Perhaps you may end
  in saying, 'I want much more, I want to see the person to whom this book
  points, but whom no book can make me feel.' Then it will have done you good.
  But perhaps you will put it aside and say, 'I want no more'."</p>

  <p>He paused, and looked anxiously at me. "In that case," continued he, "I
  shall have done you harm. But what say you? After this warning, do
  you&mdash;a Roman with Greek training, a reader of Homer and
  Thucydides&mdash;do you still desire to see this little volume that is
  neither a true poem nor a true history, a biography that hardly professes to
  draw the life of Jesus as He was, but only to make us feel that it must be
  felt, if at all, through 'a disciple whom Jesus loved'?" I assured him that I
  greatly desired to read it and thanked him with all my heart for the loan,
  and for the frankness of his warning. "Farewell," said he, placing the book
  in my hand, "my friend, my brother&mdash;brother in the search after truth,
  farewell!" "Your help," said I, as he turned away from me, "has been more
  like that of a father." He stopped and looked round at me for a moment.
  "Would indeed," said he, "that it might prove so! Farewell!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33">XXXIII. &mdash; SCAURUS ON THE FOURTH GOSPEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE sun had set, and the moon was well above the sea, when,
  after parting from Clemens, I turned towards Nicopolis, with the new gospel
  in my hand. Unrolling it, I found twilight enough to read the first few lines
  while I walked slowly for some two or three hundred paces. Then I stood still
  to read better in the fading light. When it had quite faded, I sat down
  repeating what I had read.</p>

  <p>"In the beginning was the Logos." Never shall I forget the unexpectedness
  of those words. I had supposed that the Christians altogether rejected the
  Logos except as meaning "utterance" or "doctrine." "In the beginning" was, in
  some senses, familiar. I had read in Mark, "The <i>beginning</i> of the
  gospel of Jesus Christ." Luke, too, had spoken of "those who were from the
  <i>beginning</i> eyewitnesses and ministers of the Logos." But how different
  was Luke's "logos" and Luke's "beginning" from this!</p>

  <p>I read on: "In the beginning was the Logos and the Logos was with God."
  What did "with" mean? Was the Logos "at home with God"? Or "conversing with
  God"? Or "in union with God"? Or did "with" include all these meanings? And
  what was this Logos? The next words gave the answer: "The Logos was God."</p>

  <p>These words alone, contrasted with Luke's preface, sufficed to indicate a
  difference between Luke and John, just such as Clemens had suggested. Luke
  began with a reference to many inadequate "attempts" to draw up a relation
  about what he called "the <i>facts</i>"&mdash;meaning "<i>facts</i>" as
  distinct from <i>fancies</i>&mdash;"consummated among us." Then, like a
  careful compiler, he distinguished his authorities, giving the first place to
  "<i>eye-witnesses</i>" the second to accessories, or "<i>ministers</i>."
  These were eyewitnesses, he said, "from the beginning"; and he declared that
  he had followed and traced their evidence from the fountain head. John, like
  a prophet, went back to a "beginning" of which there could be no
  "eyewitnesses." He did not say, as Luke did, "<i>it seemed good to me</i>" to
  write. He said&mdash;as though he had himself been with Him who was from the
  beginning&mdash;" The Logos was God"</p>

  <p>Glancing down the column before folding up the scroll, I could barely read
  in the fast expiring twilight the words, "And the Logos became flesh and
  tabernacled among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten
  from the Father." Clemens had prepared me for such words. As I understood
  them, the "glory" did not mean any splendour of material light or fire, such
  as is mentioned sometimes in the theophanies of Greek, Roman, and Hebrew
  writers, but the glory of God's constraining love. But I greatly desired to
  study the words in their context. Repeating them over and over again, as I
  rolled up the book, I hurried homeward. Star after star came out in the
  darkness; and with each new star a new suggestion of invisible "glory" shone
  on me more clearly. "This gospel," I said, "will grow on me like these
  visible glories. Night by night, and day by day, its words will become less
  strange and more wonderful."</p>

  <p>On my arrival, I lit my lamp, and sat down at once, preparing to continue
  my reading, when my servant entered with a letter. Not recognising the
  superscription, I put it on one side. The boy waited about in the room, doing
  nothing that needed doing. I was on the point of dismissing him, when he
  said, "Sir, I think it is from Tusculum; but the superscription is not in my
  lord's handwriting." Looking again, I saw that it was in the handwriting of
  Marullus, Scaurus's secretary. Scaurus usually superscribed his letters to me
  with his own hand. In alarm about his health, I tore the letter open, and
  throwing the cover hastily aside, glanced at the beginning. This reassured
  me. It was from Scaurus, and in his handwriting.</p>

  <p>My apprehensions were soon banished. He had been ill, he said, but had now
  recovered after a somewhat severe attack. Then the old war-horse passed on to
  his favourite battle-field&mdash;criticism of Christian gospels. I was in the
  act of putting the letter down&mdash;for I had had enough, for the present,
  of criticizing the old gospels, and was longing to study the new
  one&mdash;when I caught sight of the words "fourth gospel," and discovered
  that he had recently procured the very book I was beginning to read, and that
  his letter contained a discussion of it. This was not quite
  welcome&mdash;not, at least, at the moment. I wished to read the gospel
  first, for myself, before looking at Scaurus s criticism, which (I felt sure)
  would be destructive. "Yet," thought I, "I have heard Clemens on the one
  side; ought I not to hear Scaurus on the other? If Scaurus goes wrong, ought
  I not to be able to find it out?" Scaurus was always fair and honest, and had
  helped me hitherto, even when I had not agreed with him. These considerations
  made me finally decide to read the letter and the gospel together, comparing
  each criticism with the passage or subject criticized, as I went on.</p>

  <p>"Let me begin," wrote Scaurus, "with the point that will most interest
  you. I have accused Epictetus of borrowing from the Christians. I now assert
  that this writer&mdash;Flaccus tells me that the Christians say it was John
  the son of Zebedee y I am sure they are wrong, but for convenience I will
  call him John&mdash;this man John deliberately contradicts Epictetus, using
  our friend's language but in a different or opposite sense, or with opposite
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>"For example, Epictetus mocks at Agamemnon for calling himself a shepherd
  of the people. He dislikes the Homeric language and says 'Shepherd you are in
  truth; for you weep, <i>as the shepherds do, when a wolf snatches away one of
  their sheep.</i>' John makes Christ distinguish between the good shepherd and
  the hireling. It is only the hireling that <i>flees and lets the wolf snatch
  away the sheep</i>. In John, Christ says: 'I am the good shepherd,' and
  '<i>The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</i>'</p>

  <p>"Again, Epictetus declares that a good man never weeps. He blames Ulysses
  in particular for weeping at his separation from Penelope. John represents
  Christ as shedding tears in sympathy with a woman weeping for her dead
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Epictetus constantly says that self-knowledge is everything&mdash; herein
  (I must admit) going with other philosophers. John represents Christ as
  saying, 'This is eternal life, to know thee, the only true God and Jesus
  Christ whom thou hast sent.' It is impossible that Christ could have uttered
  the last part of this sentence exactly as it stands. But that does not weaken
  my argument, which is, that John (alone of the evangelists) insists on
  other-knowledge, not on self-knowledge, as being the essential thing. And
  this he does throughout his. gospel."</p>

  <p>Then Scaurus came to that cardinal doctrine of Epictetus which had caused
  Glaucus and me so many searchings of heart. "You know," he said, "that
  Epictetus teaches that no good man is ever troubled. It is not John's custom
  to contradict what he deems errors in a formal and direct way. But if he had
  resorted for once to direct methods, he could hardly have contradicted this
  Epictetian doctrine more effectively than he does in his indirect dramatic
  fashion. He represents Christ as thrice 'troubled.' First&mdash;on the same
  occasion on which he lets fall tears in sympathy with the woman above
  mentioned&mdash;he is said to have 'troubled himself.' Secondly, on an
  occasion when he is (as I take it) preparing for some act of self-sacrifice,
  he says, 'Now is my soul troubled.' On a third occasion, when announcing that
  he is to be betrayed by one of the Twelve, he is said to have been 'troubled
  in spirit.' I cannot doubt that this description of threefold 'trouble' is
  intended to attack the Stoic doctrine that the wise and good man is to shrink
  from 'trouble'." This convinced me, and it convinces me still.</p>

  <p>Scaurus proceeded to say, "Some innocent readers of this gospel might say,
  'Well at all events John agrees with Epictetus in his .use of the term
  Logos.' And (no doubt) the first three lines of the gospel might suggest
  this. But read on, and you will find the two are in absolute opposition. The
  Logos, in John, instead of being the philosophic Logos or reason, is really
  an unreasonable and hyperbolical sort of love, regarded by him as born from
  God, and as part of God's personality, and as constituting unity in God's
  nature. This Logos he regards as incarnate as a man for the purpose of
  uniting mankind to God! This doctrine Epictetus would absolutely reject.</p>

  <p>"Later on, in this gospel, you will find Christ saying to the disciples,
  'Ye are clean on account of the Logos that I have spoken to you.' Now
  Epictetus also connects cleanness with the Logos. 'It is impossible,' he
  says, 'that man's nature should be altogether clean, but the Logos being
  received into it, as far as possible attempts to make it cleanly.' Verbally,
  there is an appearance of agreement. Read the two contexts, however, and you
  will find that, whereas Epictetus makes 'cleanness' consist in right
  convictions, John makes it consist in a mystical doctrine of sacrifice, or
  service, typified by the Master's washing the feet of the disciples.</p>

  <p>"I could give you other instances of the way in which John uses other
  language of philosophers in a non-philosophic sense. But his use of Logos
  suffices for my purpose. It gives the clue to the whole gospel. This writer
  adds one more to my list of Christian <i>retiarii</i>. The innocent reader,
  unrolling the book and reading its first words, prepares himself for a
  Platonic treatise in which he is to 'follow the Logos' in accordance with
  Socratic precept. Then, step by step, he is lured on into regions of
  non-logic and sentiment, till the net suddenly descends on him, and he finds
  himself repeating, 'the Logos became flesh'."</p>

  <p>What Scaurus said interested me but did not convince me as to John's
  motive. Nor did Scaurus himself adhere to it. He did not always use the
  epithet "retiarian" in a bad sense. As I have said above, I had come to
  believe that right "feeling," rather than right "reason," may be regarded as
  revealing the nature of God. So I did not feel that John was beguiling his
  readers. But Scaurus's criticism helped me to recognise the extreme skill and
  tact&mdash;as well as the terseness, beauty, and solemnity&mdash;with which
  the evangelist introduces the doctrine of the incarnation. And I could not
  help agreeing with my friend's next remark, "The man that wrote the
  Apocalypse&mdash;though he, too, was a prophet and a poet in his line&mdash;
  could no more have written this prologue than Ennius could have written the
  Aeneid,"</p>

  <p>After some more observations on the difference of style in the Apocalypse
  and the Gospel, he returned to the criticism of the latter. "Compare," he
  said, "the prologue and the conclusion with the rest of this book, and you
  will see that there is some mystery about its authorship. Under one style it
  conveys two currents of thought. Sometimes it repeats itself like an old man.
  Sometimes it is as brief and dark as an oracle. Moreover, some
  events&mdash;such as the expulsion of the tradespeople from the
  temple&mdash;which ought to come at the end&mdash;this writer places at the
  beginning. It has occurred to me that he must have started with the intention
  of describing nothing but Christ's acts in Judaea and then changed his mind.
  Or is it possible that documents arranged Hebrew-fashion&mdash;last,
  first&mdash;have been interpreted Greek- fashion and consequently reversed?
  Allegory is most strangely mixed with fact. There is a wedding in which water
  is changed into wine. This is allegory. The Bride is the Church. The water of
  the law is changed into the wine of the gospel. After that, comes a statement
  that Christ spoke about destroying the temple and building it in three days.
  This is, according to Mark and Matthew, history. Luke took it as not history
  and left it out. John took it as history and allegory and put it in. But how
  differently from Mark and Matthew! Look at the passages. John often does
  this. I mean, that where Luke differs from Mark, John (who prefers Mark)
  intervenes to support the latter."</p>

  <p>This general remark (about John's "preferring Mark") agreed with what
  Clemens had said. As for the particular instance, I found that Scaurus was
  right. Mark and Matthew had mentioned a project to "destroy the temple" as
  having been imputed to Christ by false witnesses. Luke omitted it. John
  declared that Christ said to the Jews, "Destroy this temple!" and that Christ
  "spoke about the temple of his body."</p>

  <p>"If I could believe," continued Scaurus, "that John the son of Zebedee,
  the author of the Apocalypse, had any part in the production of this gospel,
  I should be disposed to say that he must have contributed to it, not as a
  scribe, but as a prophet or seer. Take, for example, the description,
  recorded in this gospel alone, of a flow of blood and water from the side of
  Christ on the cross. I do not believe for a moment that this was invented,
  any more than Luke's description of the sweat of blood on the night before
  the crucifixion. But I should explain the two as resulting from two quite
  different causes, differing as the authors differ. Luke was not a seer, but a
  man of literature, a student of documents. He found some narrative based on
  the expression that it was 'a night of watching and sweat'&mdash;which you
  know very well means in Greek 'watching and anxious toil.' The narrator took
  this literally. This literal interpretation commended itself to Luke, who
  desired to connect the death of Christ with the Jewish sacrificial 'blood of
  sprinkling'." I had not noticed in Luke any tradition about "sweat." But on
  referring to my copy I found that, though not in the text, words of this kind
  were written in the margin.</p>

  <p>Scaurus went on to show in detail that John's tradition was quite
  different in origin. It was supported by an asseveration, "He that hath seen
  hath borne witness, and his witness is true; and he <i>knoweth</i> that he
  saith true that ye also may believe." As to this, Scaurus said, "Only a
  little child, a baby Gaius, would use such an asseveration as '<i>Gaius
  knows</i> that Gaius is telling the truth.' 'He knoweth' means 'HE knoweth,'
  <i>i.e.</i> 'The Lord knoweth.' HE is often thus used in the epistle that
  forms a sort of epilogue to this gospel. The prophet, or seer, is appealing
  to his Lord about the truth of the vision of blood and water, which the Lord
  has revealed to him. In the Bible 'he that seeth' is a common phrase for &lt;
  the seer,' a man habitually seeing visions. When John came back from Patmos
  and wrote the Apocalypse, he might naturally be called by preeminence, 'he
  that hath seen.' Or the phrase might apply to this special vision: 'The seer
  (he that hath seen) hath borne witness to the vision of the stream of blood
  and water, and HE (<i>i.e.</i> the Lord) knoweth that his witness is
  true.'</p>

  <p>"I do not deny that the vision is a fulfilment of a prophecy&mdash;which
  you may have read in the book of Zechariah&mdash;concerning a certain
  'fountain to cleanse sin and defilement.' But still I say that it is an
  honest, genuine, vision, not an invention. That it is not a fact could be
  proved, if needful. According to the other evangelists, some women were
  present near the cross, but no men are mentioned. It is extremely doubtful
  whether two streams of water and blood could issue from the side. If they had
  issued, and if John had been present, the soldiers would not have let him
  stand near enough to distinguish them. My copy of Matthew, in a marginal
  note, has a similar tradition, but <i>before the death</i>, and without any
  order from Pilate to kill the crucified criminals&mdash;as if a soldier would
  dare to do this at his own pleasure! A book called Acts of John (only
  recently circulated, Flaccus tells me) contains other visions of John, and,
  among them, some revealed during the crucifixion. The Acts is not written by
  the author of this new gospel, and it is very wild and fanciful; but it
  suggests that visions may have been falsely ascribed to John because he was
  known to have really seen visions (like laws falsely assigned to Numa because
  he was supposed to have really made laws). I take it that John the son of
  Zebedee may have had a vision of this kind about a 'fountain' of blood and
  water. This may have been current among the Christians for some time. My
  annotator in Matthew seems to have found it in a wildly improbable form. The
  new gospel gives it less improbably."</p>

  <p>Scaurus then commented on the contrast between what he called the
  "soaring" thought of the book and its occasionally "pedestrian" or vernacular
  language, as when John preserves the old traditional "crib" for "bed"&mdash;a
  word abominated by Atticists and avoided by Luke. He also commented on his
  ambiguities, his subtle plays on words, his variations in the forms of words,
  and his veiled allusions&mdash;utterly unlike anything that might be expected
  from a fisherman of Galilee&mdash;declaring that the writer must have been
  conversant with the works of Philo as well as with the teaching of the
  Cynics.</p>

  <p>Then he pointed out how Christ in this gospel never uses the word "cross"
  but always speaks of being "lifted up"&mdash;a phrase, he said, current among
  Jews as well as Roman slaves, to mean "hanged" or "crucified": and he gave it
  as an instance of the writer's irony&mdash;and of his recognition that things
  low in man's eyes are high in God's eyes&mdash;that a criminal's death is
  called by this writer "being exalted," or "being glorified." "Have you
  not"&mdash;he said&mdash;" heard your servants ever say that Geta has been
  'lifted up,' or that Syrus has been a rich man and has 'fed
  multitudes'&mdash;meaning that the poor wretch has been crucified and has fed
  multitudes of crows with his flesh on the cross?" I had often heard it; and I
  was astonished that such a phrase could be used in this gospel. Scaurus
  continued, "He uses this vernacular talk, this unfeeling slavish jest, to
  represent the very highest truth of Christian doctrine, that the Redeemer is
  to be 'exalted' by suffering on the cross so as to give his flesh and blood
  to be the food of all the world!"</p>

  <p>According to Scaurus, although the style was very different indeed from
  that of Philo, and although the writer knew (what Philo did not) that the
  Septuagint was often erroneous, yet there was a great likeness between John
  and Philo in respect of their symbolism. Of this he gave a great number of
  instances. And he also quoted allusions to Jewish proverbs or sayings, one of
  which I will set down here, because it has given rise to an error among some
  of the brethren at the present day.</p>

  <p>John represents the Jews as saying to Jesus, "Thou art not yet fifty years
  old." Now, according to Scaurus, this referred to an enactment in the Law
  that the Levites must serve with laborious service "up to fifty years of
  age," after which they are exempt, so that the saying, "Thou art not yet
  fifty "meant, "Thou art but a junior Levite," used as a term of reproach.
  "This enactment," said Scaurus, "was applied by Philo to inferior spiritual
  attainment, and, I have no doubt, was used allusively by John. But it might
  easily give the impression that Christ was about fifty years old and that the
  Jews meant the saying literally."</p>

  <p>I mention this because I have myself heard the young Irenaeus maintain
  that Christ was actually about fifty years of age. And he not only quoted
  John in support of this assertion but declared that it was also the opinion
  of the elders conversant with John. When I heard him, I remembered what
  Scaurus had said. I have never had any doubt that Scaurus was right. At the
  same time it seems to me that a Jewish allusion of this kind was extremely
  liable to be misunderstood, and that the writer of this gospel would not
  perhaps have set it down if he had not received it from the originator, John
  the son of Zebedee. This, however, is only my conjecture. The error of
  Irenaeus is a fact. And I could mention another of the brethren, who wrote a
  commentary on John, and actually altered "fifty" to "forty"&mdash;I suppose,
  to make sense! Both these errors arose from not understanding John's
  allusion.</p>

  <p>Then Scaurus passed to the structure of the work which, he said, under
  appearance of great simplicity, and of an iteration that might sometimes seem
  almost garrulous or senile, conformed to certain Jewish rules of twofold and
  threefold attestation. He showed how the book&mdash;describing a new creation
  of the world&mdash;begins and ends with six days. He also showed how the
  author takes pleasure in refrains of words, and cycles or repetitions of
  events. For example, he describes Christ as being baptized at the beginning
  in one Bethany and anointed at the end in another Bethany. "I could give
  you," he said, "other instances of this sort of thing. The book is a poem,
  not a history."</p>

  <p>About this I was not yet able to judge; but I felt that by "poem " he did
  not mean "mere fiction." For he had already admitted that the book contained
  historical as well as spiritual truth. And knowing his deep love of goodness,
  I was not altogether surprised at what came next: "O my dear Quintus, while
  reading this extraordinary book I have been more than once tempted to say,
  'Along with a great deal that I do not want, this man almost gives me what I
  do want&mdash;what I have been long desiring.' I have told you how, years
  ago, I craved for a city of truth and justice. Well, I knew the Jews were a
  narrow, bigoted, and uncharitable race. No Jewish philosopher or prophet was
  likely to be my guide to such a city. But Isaiah was an exception. And
  somehow I fancied that this Jesus might be a developed Isaiah, and that his
  new city would have over its gates, 'Entrance free. Not even Roman patricians
  excluded.' But what did I find in some of the earliest gospels? In effect,
  this, 'None but the lost sheep of the House of Israel admitted here!'</p>

  <p>"Now comes this latest of all the evangelists and says, 'We have changed
  all that. The old inscription is taken down. See the new inscription, ROOM
  FOR ALL! We welcome the universe. Read me, and see what I say about <i>other
  sheep</i>, and <i>about one flock, one shepherd</i>.' To all which I reply,
  'Alas, my unknown but well-intentioned friend, I see, too clearly, that your
  friendliness exceeds your judgment. You honestly think that your gospel is so
  good that it must be true. You are not, I feel sure, decoying me&mdash;not
  consciously at least. You are the decoy bird. You have been decoyed yourself
  to decoy others. But Scaurus is too old a bird to be caught in such a
  manifest net. Whence this new doctrine? Why was it not in the earliest
  gospels?' I think John would find it hard to answer that question! If I had
  come to Jesus the Nazarene and said to him, 'What shall I do to inherit
  eternal life? 'I doubt not that he would have replied to me, 'Marcus Aemilius
  Scaurus, you doubtless think yourself a great person, as much superior to the
  low born Pontius Pilate as Pilate thinks himself superior to me. Understand,
  then, that I have no message for you. You know what name I gave to the
  Syrophoenician woman. I give the same to you'."</p>

  <p>This passage was written in very large irregular characters, especially
  towards the close, quite unlike my old friend's usual hand. Then followed
  these words, in his own neat regular writing&mdash;as though he had been
  interrupted and resumed his pen in a cooler mood&mdash;"Let me try to be
  honest. I may have said rather more than I meant. I meant this fifteen years
  ago. Perhaps I mean it still. But after reading this new gospel, I feel
  somewhat less certain. Still, I fear that the truth may be as I have
  said."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34">XXXIV. &mdash; THE LAST WORDS OF SCAURUS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HAD I read to the end of Scaurus's letter I should not have
  been so startled by this sudden outburst. As it was, I had but a feint
  perception of the cause. I did not give weight enough to the
  indications&mdash;slight to others but they ought to have been clear to
  me&mdash;that the old man was writing under a great mental strain. Striving
  to be fair to the evangelists, he desired also to do justice to himself, half
  repenting that he had rejected the Saviour, half vindicating the rejection on
  the ground that truth constrained it. The whole tone of his letter&mdash;the
  handwriting itself, if I had only noted it more closely&mdash;should have
  made me perceive that he was passing rapidly through many transient phases,
  and that this outburst of passionate indignation&mdash;not with Christ but
  with what he supposed to be Mark's Christ&mdash;was but one of them. I did
  not notice these things. I was too much wrapped up in my own thoughts, and in
  imaginations of what I could have said, and how I could have pleaded with him
  for Christ.</p>

  <p>It was now late, and I could read no more. I retired to rest&mdash;but not
  at first to peaceful rest. Thoughts and dreams, fancies and phantoms, passed
  indistinguishably before me: Scaurus and Clemens opposing one another, Hermas
  mediating, while Epictetus looked on; Troy, Rome, Jerusalem, and the City of
  Truth and Justice coming down from heaven ; sunset and sunrise ushered by
  Hesper and Phosphor&mdash;with snatches of familiar utterances about
  "perceiving," "believing," and "deceiving," and mocking repetitions of
  "logos," "logos"&mdash;a confused, shifting, and multitudinous medley that
  resolved itself at last into one vast and dizzying whirlpool, in which all
  existence seemed endlessly revolving round a central abyss, when suddenly I
  heard "In the beginning was the Logos." Then the whirlpool was drawn up to
  the sky as though it had been a painted curtain; and we were standing below,
  Scaurus and I, and Clemens, and Epictetus, and Hermas&mdash;all of us gazing
  upwards to an unspeakable glory ascending and descending between heaven and
  earth. Then I fell into a peaceful sleep.</p>

  <p>Next morning I continued reading the letter. "About the marvels or
  miracles in this gospel," said Scaurus, "it is worth noting that the author
  mentions only seven, that is to say, seven before the resurrection. This, I
  believe, is the number assigned to Elijah, whereas Elisha has
  fourteen&mdash;having 'a double portion' of Elijah's spirit. This selection
  of seven is one among many indications that the work uses Jewish symbolism. I
  have shown above that the Jewish genealogies are sometimes adapted in that
  way, as with Matthew's 'fourteen generations.' A more important fact is that
  this writer calls the miracles 'signs '&mdash;not 'mighty works,' which is
  the term in the three gospels. This is very interesting and I like him for
  it. He hates the words 'strong,' and 'mighty,' and 'mighty work.' For the
  matter of that, so does Epictetus. Both would agree that it is only slaves
  that obey 'the stronger.'}</p>

  <p>"He also dislikes arithmetical 'greatness' and discussions about 'who is
  the greatest?' He prefers to lay stress on unity. Christians, he thinks, are
  'one with the Son,' or they are 'in' the Son, or the Son is 'in' them. They
  are also to be 'one,' as the Father and the Son are 'one.' When men are
  regarded in this way, arithmetical standards of greatness&mdash;based on
  one's income, or on the amount of one's alms, or the amount of one's prayers,
  or one's sufferings, or one's converts&mdash;become ridiculous. He is quite
  right.</p>

  <p>"He makes no mention of 'repentance.' That, I think, is because he prefers
  such expressions as 'coming to God' or 'coming to the light,' rather than
  mere 'change of mind.' He never uses the noun 'faith' or 'belief.' Probably
  he found it in use as a technical term among some foolish Christians&mdash;
  speaking of 'faith that moves mountains'&mdash;who forgot to ask 'faith in
  <i>what</i>?' For the same reason, no doubt, he preferred the word 'signs' to
  'mighty works,' because the former&mdash;at all events while it was a novel
  term&mdash;might make men ask 'signs of what?' The phrase 'mighty work' makes
  us ask nothing. Nor does a 'mighty' work prove anything, except that the doer
  is 'mighty '&mdash;perhaps a giant, perhaps a magician, perhaps a God. Who is
  to decide? Epictetus says that Ceres and Pluto are proved to be Gods because
  they produce 'bread.' So this John represents Christ as producing bread and
  wine and healing disease and raising the dead; and these are 'signs' that he
  is a Giver of divine gifts and a Healer, like Apollo.</p>

  <p>"In the case of one miracle, omitted by Luke, John intervenes and gives
  the sign a different aspect&mdash;I mean the one in which Mark and Matthew
  represent Christ as walking over the water to the disciples in a storm and as
  coming into their boat. John represents Christ as standing on the edge of the
  sea and as drawing the disciples safely to himself as soon as they cry out to
  him. I have no doubt that the story is an allegory. But John seems to me to
  give it in the nobler, and perhaps the earlier, form.</p>

  <p>"There were probably multitudes of exorcisms performed by Jesus, as I have
  said to you before. But John does not mention a single instance. Perhaps he
  thought that more than enough had been said about these things by the earlier
  evangelists. On the other hand, he describes the healing of a man born blind,
  and the raising of a man named Lazarus from the dead, after he had lain in
  the tomb three days.</p>

  <p>"The nearest approach to this is a story in Luke about raising from the
  coffin a young man, the son of a widow. I was long ago inclined to think
  Luke's story allegorical, and a curious book, which recently came into my
  hands, confirms this view. It is assigned to Ezra, but was really written, at
  least in its present form, about five and twenty years ago. I think it mixes
  Jewish and Christian thought. Ezra sees a vision of a woman sorrowing for her
  only child. She has had no son till after 'thirty years ' of wedlock. The son
  grew up and was to be married. When he 'entered into his wedding chamber, he
  fell down and died.' Presently it is explained, 'The woman is Sion.' For
  'thirty years' there was 'no offering.' After 'thirty years,' Solomon
  'builded the city and offered offerings.' Then Jerusalem was destroyed. But
  Ezra sees a new city builded, 'a large place.' It is a strange mixture.
  David, -says the scripture, was a 'son of thirty years' when he began to
  reign, and he may be supposed to have died about the time when the Temple
  began to be built. On the other hand Christ also was a 'son of thirty years'
  when he began to preach the gospel, and Christ might be said to have died at
  the time when he entered the Temple to purify it (that is, as Jews might say,
  'entered the wedding chamber').</p>

  <p>"I don't profess to explain all this Ezra-allegory. The only point worth
  noting is that it describes events that befell <i>the City and the Temple</i>
  of the Jews as though they befell <i>persons</i>&mdash;a 'woman' and a
  deceased 'son.' Luke omits the charge brought against Christ that he
  threatened to destroy '<i>the temple</i>' and build another. But there can be
  no doubt that there was some basis of fact for the charge. John gives that
  basis, by saying that Christ had in view a <i>'body</i>,' meaning himself.
  This indicates that Luke was misled through not understanding Jewish
  metaphor. So here Luke may have been misled again. He found a tradition
  describing the 'raising up' of the 'widow's son,' and he took it literally."
  The explanation thus suggested by Scaurus seemed to me probable. It explained
  why Luke omitted "the raising up of the temple." It also explained why Mark
  and Matthew omitted "the raising up of the widow's son."</p>

  <p>Scaurus proceeded to the account of the raising of Lazarus. "This
  narrative," he said, "is extremely beautiful and may perhaps have had some
  basis of historical fact. Luke speaks of a Lazarus, who dies, and is carried
  after death into Abraham's bosom. Some Christians might take this Lazarus for
  a historical character. But I do not think any confusion arising from that
  story can have had very much to do with the story in John. The latter seems
  to me to have been thrown into allegorical form, so that Lazarus may
  represent humanity, first, corrupt, mere '<i>flesh and blood</i>'; secondly,
  raised up by '<i>the help of God</i>.' 'My God helps' is the meaning of
  Eliezer or Lazarus. Philo sees in the name these two associations. Also a
  Christian writer named Barnabas has some curious traditions that may bear on
  this name; and so have the Jews. Possibly John may mean&mdash;over and above
  the man Lazarus&mdash;the human race, raised up to life by the Messiah at the
  intercession of two sisters, representing the Jewish and the Gentile Churches
  of the Christians. Similarly I am told that Christians describe the two
  sisters Leah and Rachel as representing the Synagogue and the Church.</p>

  <p>"For my part, having spoken to many physicians, and having investigated
  some instances of revivification, I have come to the conclusion that Jesus
  possessed a remarkable power of healing the sick and even perhaps of
  restoring life to those from whom (to all appearance) life had recently
  departed. Nay, I am dreamer enough to go beyond anything that physicians
  would allow, and to suppose that Christ may have had a certain power of what
  I called above <i>teliatreia</i>, 'healing at a distance,' producing a
  corresponding <i>telepatheia</i>, or 'being healed at a distance.' But there
  is against this particular narrative the objection&mdash;not to be overcome
  except by very strong evidence indeed&mdash;that the other evangelists say
  nothing about this stupendous miracle. Having in view Christ's precept to the
  disciples, 'Raise the dead,' I see how easily honest Christians might be led
  to take metaphor for fact. It is much more easy to explain how the narratives
  of the widow's son and of Lazarus may have arisen from misunderstanding in
  the two latest gospels, than to explain how, though true, they were omitted
  in the two earliest."</p>

  <p>Upon this, I read the story of the raising of Lazarus two or three times
  over. It appeared to me certain that the writer of the gospel must have taken
  the story as literally true. But I saw how easy it was to mistake metaphor
  for literal meaning in stories of this kind. I was also impressed by what
  Scaurus said concerning the precept, "Raise the dead," which is recorded by
  Matthew. No other writer mentions this; and I had assumed, at the time of
  which I am now speaking, that it was meant spiritually, and that Luke omitted
  it because he thought that it might be misunderstood as having a literal
  meaning. And here I may say, writing forty-five years afterwards, that I have
  lately spoken to several of the brethren about this precept. Some leave it
  out of their text of Matthew. Some refuse to say anything about it. But I
  have not as yet found a single brother ready to admit that Jesus must have
  used it, or even probably used it, metaphorically.</p>

  <p>All this I did not know at the time when I was reading Scaurus's letter;
  but I recognised the force of his arguments and was constrained to sympathize
  with his disappointment when he proceeded as follows: "O, my dearest Quintus,
  what earthen vessels, what mere potsherds, these gospel writers are, even the
  best of them, in comparison with the man whom they fail to set before us!
  Yes, even this John, whom I regard as by far the greatest of them all, even
  he is a failure&mdash;but in his case, perhaps, from want of knowledge, not
  from want of insight. As for the others, why do they not trust to the
  greatness of their subject, the man Jesus Christ? Why can they not believe
  that the Logos might become incarnate as a man, that is to say, a real
  man&mdash;what Jesus himself calls 'son of man '? Why do they lay so much
  stress on mere 'mighty works,' some of which, even if they could be proved to
  have happened, would give us little insight into the real greatness of their
  Master, whom they wish us to worship?</p>

  <p>"For my part, I take such stories as those of the destruction of the swine
  and the withering of the fig-tree, to be allegories misinterpreted as facts.
  But even if I were shown to be wrong, they would not prove to me that I was
  right in worshipping the doer of such wonders. If I can judge myself aright,
  I, Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, am quite prone enough already to worship the God
  of the Thunderbolts and the God of War, These Jews might have taught me
  better. They have, to some extent&mdash;especially this fourth writer. But
  how much more from the first might have been effected if, from the first,
  they had recognised the truth taught in the legend of Elijah&mdash;that the
  Lord is 'not in the earthquake' but 'in the still small voice' I..."</p>

  <p>At this point, Scaurus's handwriting became irregular and sometimes not
  easy to read. "I have been interrupted again," he said. "This time, it was
  Flaccus. Now I take up my pen positively for the last time, wondering why I
  take it up, and why I ramble on in this maundering fashion. I think it is
  because I feel as though you and I were dreaming together, and I am loth to
  leave off. There is no one else in the world with whom I can thus dream in
  partnership. This shall really be my last dreaming.</p>

  <p>"Do not be vexed with me, Quintus, for charging Flaccus not to send you a
  copy of this little book. He told me that for some time past you had been
  interested in these subjects, and that, if he could find another copy, he
  intended to forward it to you. The rascal added something about 'mere
  literary interest.' I suspect him of Christian tendencies. Your recent
  letters have reassured me. But I cannot help feeling that there have been
  moments with you, as with me, when the 'interest' was more than 'merely
  literary.' I had half thought of sending you my copy. But I shall not. The
  subject is too fascinating&mdash;like chess; and, like chess, it leads to
  nothing. I was glad to hear&mdash;in your last letter, I think&mdash;that you
  were now giving your mind to practical affairs. If you decide on the army at
  once, there is likely to be work soon in Illyria.</p>

  <p>"Things also look cloudy, not black yet but cloudy, in Syria. In spite of
  the thrashing they got from the late Emperor, these Jews have not yet learned
  their lesson. They are as stubborn and obstinate as Hannibal made us out to
  be:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="peom">'Gens quae cremato fortis ab Ilio<br>
  Jactata Tuscis aequoribus sacra<br>
  Natosque maturosque patres<br>
  Pertulit Ausonias ad urbes,<br>
  Duris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus<br>
  Nigrae feraci frondis in Algido<br>
  Per damna, per caedes, ab ipso<br>
  Ducit opes animumque ferro.'</p>

  <p>"How every word of this would suit the Jews! I mean in their past history.
  According to my news (from a friend of Rufus the new Governor) it may suit
  their future, too; and we may have to take Jerusalem again. Then&mdash;to
  quote Isaiah and Horace in one&mdash;there will be another 'lopping of the
  boughs' in the future. But I mean their past. I wonder whether you understand
  what I am dreaming of Probably not, and it is not worth explaining. Nor
  indeed am I well enough to explain clearly and briefly. I have been going in
  too much for books of late, and feel at this moment (to quote an old friend)
  'dead from the waist down.' However&mdash;as I am not going to write about
  these Jews again&mdash;I will scribble my last thoughts to the end.</p>

  <p>"How strange it would have been, then, my dearest Quintus, if these
  Jews&mdash;I mean the Jewish Jews not the Christian Jews&mdash;how strange, I
  say, it would have been, looked at as a poem, if these fellows had fulfilled
  Hannibal's prophecy. They went some way towards it. Though their Ilium has
  been twice burned they are still alive, numerous, and active. Their 'ilex'
  has had 'pruning' enough, heaven knows, from the Roman axe of late, and from
  the Assyrian and Babylonian axes in days gone by. But they want pruning
  still. Witness a score of eastern cities, where they have lately been
  massacring myriads of Greeks&mdash;not, I own, without having seen myriads of
  their countrymen massacred first.</p>

  <p>"Their disadvantage has been that they have never made a new start as
  Aeneas did, so as to turn old Troy into new Rome. Aeneas could take his gods
  with him. The Jews could not. The only place where they have done anything of
  the kind is Alexandria. There they have an imitation temple&mdash;not a rival
  temple of course, but an imitation&mdash;and there they are at their best.
  But elsewhere the stubborn creatures&mdash;from Gaul to
  Euphrates&mdash;recognise no home or sacred ground except in a little comer
  of Syria. Providence has done its best to detach them from this servitude by
  using Titus to destroy their temple a second time, and by leaving their
  sacred utensils no existence except upon Titus's arch. But still they are
  servants of the <i>genius loci</i>, so to speak. As they cannot serve the
  temple, they serve the ground on which it stands and the traditions that have
  collected round it.</p>

  <p>"The Christian Jews have immense advantages. They are like the Trojan
  Romans. The Christians have left their Troy (that is to say, carnal
  Jerusalem) in order to dwell in Rome (that is to say, heavenly Jerusalem) the
  city of truth, the city of justice, the city of freedom and universal
  brotherhood. Their sacred fire is the Holy Spirit. Their sacred vessels are
  human beings. Every great city in Asia contains their 'holy things.' To
  celebrate their feast on the body and blood of their Saviour, a table of pine
  wood, a platter, and a mug, supply them with all they need! A little bread,
  and wine mingled with water, have taken the place of Solomon's hecatombs!
  Surely this is the very perfection of religious simplicity&mdash;an
  ambassador in a plain Roman toga amid the courtiers of a Ptolemy!</p>

  <p>"Again, when we Romans call on Jupiter, offering our costliest white oxen,
  who supposes that Jupiter descends? But when these Christians meet, without a
  denarius in their pockets, three in a room, they tell you that Christ is with
  them. What is more, many of them believe it! What is most, some of them act
  as though they believed it! I have called their city a city of dreams, and I
  repeat it. But, mark you, a city of dreams has one great advantage over a
  city of bricks or stone. You can smash the latter. But neither Nero, nor
  Trajan, has been able to smash the former; and I begin to doubt whether it
  could be smashed by Hadrian, if he tried. At the present rate, I should not
  be surprised if, in the next hundred years, the empire from the Euphrates to
  Britain were dotted with colonies of Christ.</p>

  <p>"'Let arms of war. give place to the gown of peace!' So sang the lawyer of
  Arpinum when he tried his hand at poetry. He was better advised, in his
  lawyer's gown, when he confessed 'Laws are silent among arms.' But there is a
  third power more powerful than either laws or arms. You won't believe me when
  I tell you its name. It is 'dreams.' Yes, 'Among dreams,' says
  Scaurus&mdash;and he knows, having been himself a dreamer, in his day,
  besides being a bit of a soldier and a good deal of a looker on&mdash;'Among
  dreams, arms are <i>vain</i>.' I don't say they are '<i>silent</i>.' That is
  their contemptible feature&mdash;they are <i>not</i> 'silent.' But they are
  impotent. Mars against dreams may make what fuss and bustle he pleases,
  clash, clang, thunder, like the brazen wheels of Salmoneus. But his
  thundering will effect nothing. Nor will his steel. '<i>Frustra diverberet
  umbras.</i>'</p>

  <p>"When I say 'dreams,' do not take me to mean that the personality of a
  great prophet is a 'dream.' But the notion that an empire can be spun out of
  it, or built on it, seems to me a dream. Yet there is something attractive in
  it&mdash;I mean in the conception of a soul like a vast magnet, attracting
  and magnetizing a group of souls, of which each in turn becomes a new magnet,
  magnetizing a group of its own, and so on, and so on, till the whole empire
  (or family) of souls is bound together by this magnetic law. Yes, 'law' one
  may call it, not a magical incantation, but a natural law, the law of the
  spiritual magnet. It is all very strange. Yet, given the personality, it is
  possible.</p>

  <p>"For it all comes to this, a personality&mdash;nothing more. There is
  nothing new in what the Christians call their Testament or
  Covenant&mdash;nothing new at all, from the Jewish point of view, except that
  the new Jews have cast aside a great deal of the Covenant of the old Jews. I
  sometimes think the Christian leader was really what Socrates calls himself,
  a 'cosmian' or 'cosmopolite,' going back, behind the law of Moses, to a
  beginning of things before unclean food was Levitically forbidden and before
  free divorce was Levitically sanctioned. His two fundamental rules are the
  same, both for Jews and for Christians, 'Love God,' 'Love man.'</p>

  <p>"The difference is, that to the Christians (so they assert) Christ has
  introduced a new kind of love, a new power of love. He has not only breathed
  it into his disciples but also given them (they say) the power of breathing
  it into others. The question is. Have they this power? I am obliged to
  admit&mdash;from what I hear&mdash;that a good many of them appear to me to
  have it. This is the real miracle. This, if true, is sunlight. All the
  so-called miracles of their books, even if true, are the merest, palest
  moonlight compared with this.</p>

  <p>"This dreamer seems to me to have planned an imperial peace throughout his
  cosmopolis, to be brought about, not by threats based on the power of
  inflicting death, not by edicts on stone backed by punishments with steel,
  but by means of a spirit that is to creep into our hearts, dethrone our
  intellects, drag us in triumph behind his chariot wheels, making us
  fanatically happy when we are in love with him&mdash;and with all the weak,
  the foolish, the suffering, and the oppressed&mdash;and making us
  unreasonably unhappy, foolishly sad and sick at heart, when we resist a blind
  affection for others and when we consult our own interests and our own
  pleasures, following the path of prudent wisdom.</p>

  <p>"In one respect, this work of John's has proved me a false prophet. I
  prophesied that East and West could not unite in one religion. They
  <i>have</i> united&mdash;on paper, and in theory&mdash;in this little book.
  But I also said that, if they did unite, their offspring would be a portent.
  To that I adhere. If John's form of the Christian superstition were to
  overspread the world, do you seriously suppose that it would remain in his
  form? No, it is impossible but that the spiritual will be despiritualised.
  The superstition of pure spirit will probably become a superstition of
  unmixed matter. The life will be narrowed to the Body and the Blood. The Body
  and the Blood will be narrowed down still further to the Bread and the Wine.
  Then their hyperbolical self-sacrifice will give way to hyperbolical
  malignity. How these Christians will, in due time, hate one another! How they
  will wall in, and imprison, the Spirit that bloweth whither it listeth! How
  they will war against one another for their Prince of Peace! How they will
  philosophize and hair-split about the Father and the Son, tearing one another
  in pieces for the unity of the one God! And yet, and yet, even if all my
  prophecies of the worst come to pass, might not a Christian philosopher of
  those far-off days say that the 'worst is often the corruption of the best,'
  and that his Prophet had discovered a 'best,' buried for a time beneath all
  this rubbish and litter, but destined to emerge and grow into the tree of a
  great spiritual empire? It may be so. I do not deny that there may be such a
  'best.' But it is not for me.</p>

  <p>"I give it up. The problem of the Sphinx is too hard for my brains.
  Perhaps Destiny knows its own mind, and it may be a good mind&mdash;not my
  mind, but perhaps an infinitely better and wiser. Perhaps this Christian
  superstition is intended to found an empire after the Spirit, an empire of
  'the Son of man,' like, but unlike, the empires of Egypt, Babylon, Greece,
  Rome. Daniel dreamed this for Jewish Jews. It may come true for Christian
  Jews. If it should come, what a tyranny it will be&mdash;for those, at least,
  who are tyrants at heart! The yoke of the Imperium Romanum will be nothing to
  the yoke of the Imperium Romanochristianum. We Romans despotize over bodies:
  the Roman Christians will despotize over souls. 'Debellare superbos' is only
  one of our arts. 'Pacis imponere mores' is a second. 'Parcere subjectis' is a
  third. These Roman Christians will know how to crush, but not how to spare.
  What saints it will create&mdash;for the spiritual! What devils&mdash;for the
  carnal! And which will win in the end, saint or devil? I incline, with
  oscillation, to the saint. But I am sick and tired of inclinations and
  oscillations; I want to <i>know</i>, I <i>know</i> that the sun shines. I
  want to <i>know</i>&mdash;just at this moment I feel very near knowing,
  nearer than I ever have been in my whole life&mdash;that the world has been
  made all of a piece, and is being shaped by the Maker to one end, and that,
  the best.</p>

  <p>"O, my dear Silanus, I am weary of these books. I must go out into the
  fresh air and see the sun. Books, books, books! I agree with Epictetus, who
  thinks that Chrysippus wrote some two hundred too many. I agree with John,
  too, who says, in effect, that not all the pens and paper in the world could
  draw the portrait of his master&mdash;or rather his friend, for 'friend,' not
  'servant,' is the title at the end of the book. That reminds me, by the way,
  of a beautiful thought in this gospel&mdash;I mean that the author is 'the
  disciple whom Jesus loved'! As much as to say, 'Do you want to know Jesus?
  Then get a <i>friend</i> of his&mdash;some one <i>whom Jesus
  loved</i>&mdash;to introduce you. There is no other way. Not an impartial
  biographer&mdash;he is of no use&mdash;but a <i>friend</i>! And I think he
  means to hint, at the close of his little book, that there always will be,
  'tarrying,' till Jesus comes again, a 'disciple whom Jesus loved,' to
  represent him to the world.</p>

  <p>"That is most true. That is real insight, the insight of an artist and a
  prophet in. one. I can forgive John almost all his faults&mdash;ambiguities,
  artificialities, statements of non-fact as fact, I can condone them all as
  orientalisms or Alexandrian Judaisms&mdash;for the sake of this one truth,
  that we cannot know the greatest of the departed great, save through a human
  being that has loved him and has been loved by him. This is the thought with
  which John ends and with which I will end. I wish to part friends with him.
  Indeed at this moment, for his sake, I could almost call myself an amateur
  Christian. But then I pull myself together and recognise that it only proves
  what I have said to you a score of times, and now repeat for the last time,
  that whereas we Romans are only coarse, clumsy, brutal Samnites, these
  Christians are the wiliest, kindest, and gentlest of retiarii.</p>

  <p>"And that makes me think of old Hermas. You remember I told you of our
  last interview. It comes back to me while I am finishing this last dream. I
  always felt there was more in his face than I could understand. Now, after
  reading this gospel, I seem, just at this moment, to understand his face for
  the first time, quite well. The old man had in him the love of 'the disciple
  whom Jesus loved.' It had been breathed into his being. This it was that half
  fascinated me, shining out of his eyes as he silently left the room on that
  afternoon&mdash;to me unforgettable&mdash;when I dismissed him. What if I had
  not dismissed him? What if ."</p>

  <p>These words were the last of a column. They were the last that Scaurus was
  ever to write. The next column was blank. At first I thought he had been
  again interrupted and had forgotten to finish the letter. But then I
  recollected with alarm that, quite contrary to custom, the cover had not been
  directed in his handwriting. I had thrown it hastily aside on the previous
  evening. Now I searched for it and my alarm was speedily justified. Inside
  was a short and hurried note from Marullus saying that my dear old friend had
  been struck suddenly with paralysis in the act of writing to me. A messenger
  (said Marullus) who happened to be at that moment waiting to carry Scaurus's
  letter, would carry at the same time Marullus's note. On the following day,
  whatever might happen, he would send a second letter by a special
  messenger.</p>

  <p>It was now drawing towards evening. I hastened out to ascertain how soon a
  vessel, available for my purpose, would be leaving Nicopolis. Finding that I
  could start on the following day at noon, I determined not to wait for
  Marullus's second letter but to make preparations for an immediate
  return.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35">XXXV. &mdash; CLEMENS ON THE SACRIFICE OF CHRIST</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SCAURUS, and not the fourth gospel, nor any other book,
  person, or thing, was uppermost in my mind, when, late in the evening, I
  hurried to the house of Justus to keep my engagement with Clemens. Two or
  three hours ago, I had been longing for this interview. Now I would willingly
  have avoided it. I seemed to see my old friend speechless on his bed in
  Tusculum, saying to me with his eyes, "Do not desert me. Do not go over to
  the enemy." Not till later did I feel that Scaurus could not have called
  Clemens "enemy."</p>

  <p>"I am tired of books"&mdash;so Scaurus had written. So was I, quite tired.
  I wanted to think, not talk; or, if to talk, to talk about Scaurus, not about
  gospels or books of any sort. "How glad should I be to exchange this
  interview for five minutes' chat with old Marullus!"&mdash;that was my
  thought when I found myself, more than an hour after sunset, sitting face to
  face with Clemens.</p>

  <p>I returned him the book&mdash;so precious to me yesterday&mdash;with some
  words of formal thanks. What should I say next? About the one subject that
  filled all my thoughts I felt no desire to talk to a stranger&mdash;"yes" (I
  said to myself) "a stranger to Scaurus, though a friend, a real friend, to
  me." Yet something had to be said. I began by excusing myself, at an absurd
  length, for being late. Clemens acknowledged the excuse with a slight
  inclination of the head. His face was questioning me, and his eyes were
  reading me. But he left it to me to speak, and to open our interview if I
  desired one.</p>

  <p>Then I blundered out some absurd stuff&mdash;in the way of humour
  !&mdash;about the possibility that he might suppose me to have forgotten my
  engagement.</p>

  <p>Clemens did not seem in the least ruffled or even surprised. After a
  pause, in which the questioning look gave place to one of sympathy, he said,
  very slowly and gently, "No, my dear friend, I could not suppose that. Nor
  could you think that I could suppose that. Some trouble, I perceive, has
  befallen you. You felt bound to keep your engagement with me, and you have
  done so. You did right. But you will not do right if you stay longer, put of
  courtesy to me, when your conscience tells you that it would be better for
  you to be alone."</p>

  <p>When I entered the room, I had distinctly preferred to be alone. Even now,
  I so far desired solitude that I murmured some words of thanks for his
  consideration, and rose to go. But something kept me standing irresolute. I
  do not know what it was at first. Certainly it was not any thought about the
  new gospel. Perhaps it was my new friend's directness, truthfulness and
  insight, in discerning and brushing aside my pretence, and his kind and
  courteous way of forgiving it, that made me suddenly feel, "This is a man
  that Scaurus would have liked to know. This is a man that Scaurus would like
  me to know. He tells me to go if I feel that it will be 'better' for me to be
  alone. But will it be 'better '?"</p>

  <p>It may have been this that checked my going. I do not know for certain.
  But I do know what decided me to stay. I suddenly saw Scaurus. He was in the
  library at Tusculum, with his back to me, at his writing-table, but not
  writing, half risen from his seat, and looking towards the door, which was
  slowly closing. As it closed, he turned and looked round at me, with such a
  sadness as I had never seen on his face except once or twice, when I had gone
  wrong and he was striving to lead me right. I knew what he meant, as well as
  if he had said the words aloud, "Hermas is gone, and I shall repent it
  through my life. Do not let your Hermas go!" I resumed my seat and tried to
  collect my thoughts.</p>

  <p>It seemed to me now only right and natural that I should tell Clemens of
  Scaurus's illness and of my intention to leave Nicopolis on the morrow. He
  took my departure as a matter of course. Could he be of service, he asked, in
  making arrangements for my sailing? I assured him that everything had been
  done that was needful for that day. Then I told him how Scaurus had urged me
  to join Epictetus's classes, and that he wished me afterwards to join the
  army. Finding him interested and sympathetic, I gave him an account of my old
  friend's life, his affection for me, his love of research, his literary
  pursuits, and his study of Jewish as well as Greek literature, not omitting
  his early reading of the gospels, nor forgetting to tell him about old Hermas
  the Christian, his librarian. He listened with more and more attention. "I am
  not surprised," he said, "that you love so good a friend and so honest a
  man."</p>

  <p>Presently I said, "I wonder whether it would be still possible and right
  for me to join the army, if" and there I stopped. "Dear friend," said he, "if
  that unmentioned thing were to come to pass, trust me that nothing would be
  possible or right for you against which your conscience cried out, and
  nothing wrong that your conscience permitted. Some might condemn your
  decision&mdash;whether to join the army or not to join. But you would not be
  bound by their condemnation. Your conscience would receive guidance. Those
  who follow on that unmentioned path do not follow with an 'if' Should that
  path be taken, it would be, not on conditions, but because of a friendly
  constraint. Let us not speak of that now. Tell me more about your friend." "
  I have his letter here," said I, "and would read it if you cared to hear it.
  But it deals freely, very freely, with the gospels. Once, at least, I think
  my old friend is unfair to them. It would perhaps pain you." "It would not
  pain but please me," said he. "I always like to hear honest, able, and
  educated men speak their minds freely about our Christian writings. The pity
  of it is, that we have hitherto had few such critics. If we had had them when
  the gospels were first written, perhaps they would have contained fewer
  things that may in after times cause some of the faithful to stumble."</p>

  <p>So I began to read Scaurus's letter to him. At first I omitted portions
  here and there, either because they were personal, or because they might hurt
  the feelings of a Christian. Presently, halting in the middle of a bitter
  saying, I finished the sentence in my own way&mdash;somewhat awkwardly.
  Clemens smiled. "Pardon me," said he, "for interrupting you. I am not a
  master of styles. Yet, if I mistake not, those last words did not come from
  Aemilius Scaurus. If I am wrong, forgive me. But if I am right in thinking
  that you altered something to spare my feelings, then let me assure you again
  that it would trouble me that you should do this, even though the criticism
  came from the bitterest enemy of the Christians. As it is, I have learned
  already to esteem your friend as a genuine lover of truth, and one from whom
  I have even now learned some things and hope to learn more. The more you will
  allow me to learn (without giving pain to yourself) the better shall I be
  pleased." "Well then," said I, "we will talk about the letter afterwards. For
  the present, I will read on steadily without omitting a single word, unless
  you stop me." And so I did. Clemens listened intently, without stopping me,
  only he now and then, especially towards the end, expressed assent or
  interest, or sympathy, by a slight movement or inarticulate murmur; till we
  came to the last words, the uncompleted sentence, suggesting what might have
  happened on one memorable afternoon, if he had not dismissed a "disciple whom
  Jesus loved." This I did not read, but I placed the letter before him.
  "These," said I, "were his last words, the very last."</p>

  <p>He read them, and turned away his face. I thought, and rightly, that he
  was feeling with me. But I am sure now that he was also praying for me, and
  for Scaurus too. For a time we sat in silence. I was the first to break it,
  expressing my sorrow that the story of the Syrophoenician woman should have
  led Scaurus to form what seemed to me a wrong conception of Christ. "But you
  see," replied Clemens, "he revolted from that wrong conception, or was ready
  to revolt from it, at the last moment of all. And I agree with you that, if
  he had approached that story with the preparation that Paul gave you, he
  would have regarded it as you did. I am sure Christ was never cruel to
  anyone. If He really uttered those seemingly cruel words to that sorrowful
  woman, He was cruel in word, only that He might be the more kind and the more
  helpful in deed. He intended this gospel to be preached to all the world,
  though He waited for the Father to teach Him the time and the manner of the
  preaching to the Gentiles."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything in John's gospel," said I, "that resembles this story?"
  "There is a dialogue," he replied, "between Christ and a Samaritan woman, who
  is described as living in sin, just as you have suggested concerning the
  Syrophoenician. And Christ chides her, but with great gentleness, and finally
  reveals Himself to her as Messiah. It has occurred to me that this is one of
  the many instances where John steps in to remove a misunderstanding liable to
  be caused by some passage in Mark, which Luke omits."</p>

  <p>Then he added, "I will talk with you, if you please, about the letter or
  the gospel or anything else, if you really desire it. But if you would wish
  to be alone with your own thoughts (as you well might wish), do not, I
  beseech you, stay longer. You have laid me under a debt by introducing me to
  a genuine lover of truth on whom the Light of the World has dawned, even
  though it may not be given to him to see the full day. May he find
  peace!"</p>

  <p>I was quite willing to stay now. "Do you agree with Scaurus," said I,
  "that John alludes in parts of his gospel to the teaching of Epictetus?" "I
  feel sure," replied Clemens, "that John alludes to the doctrine of the Stoics
  and Cynics. Now Epictetus has been, for some years past, most widely known
  among all classes, rich, poor&mdash;yes, and slaves, too&mdash;as the
  representative of the Cynic doctrine. So that your friend seems to me likely
  to be right." "Scaurus," said I, "mentions self-knowledge and God-knowledge
  as if the former were inculcated by Epictetus, the latter by John, in
  opposition. Is that so, in your opinion?" "Not quite," said he, "but nearly
  so. All the Stoics lay stress, as you know, on self-knowledge. Epictetus,
  perhaps more than most, teaches men to look for God within themselves. Luke
  also&mdash;alone of the evangelists&mdash;has one tradition of this kind,
  'The kingdom of God is within you.' John, feeling that many were prevented
  thereby from looking for God out of themselves, laid stress on the latter.
  That is to say, John paraphrased Christ's teaching about 'the Father in
  heaven' in such a form that it should be more familiar to the Greeks, urging
  them to 'know God.' So Paul is said by Luke to have taken as his text on the
  Areopagus an inscription TO THE UNKNOWN GOD; and he tried to teach the
  philosophers that God could be 'known.' But neither Paul nor John would deny
  that self-knowledge, and the consciousness of our own sins, and the sense of
  our own burdens, are necessary if we are to have our burdens lightened, our
  sins forgiven, and our souls brought into the light of the glory of the
  knowledge of God."</p>

  <p>" And as to the 'troubling' of Christ'," said I, "mentioned thrice in the
  fourth gospel, do you agree with Scaurus that there, too, the author is
  alluding to Epictetus?" "I do indeed," said he. "I did so from the first
  moment when I read the new gospel. Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly
  upward. We are born to be lifted up to heaven by troubles. But trouble of
  soul does not mean confusion or turbidness of soul. Trouble is on the
  surface, peace is beneath, peace that is deeper than the deepest of depths.
  In the world, says the Saviour, we shall have tribulation, and tribulation
  brings trouble with it. But He bids us be of good cheer amidst and beneath
  all our trouble, because He has overcome the world. Perhaps, however, John
  emphasizes this doctrine of 'trouble,' not out of hostility to the Cynic
  philosophy, but rather out of a friendly feeling to it, as much as to say,
  'This notion of yours, that you must avoid "trouble," is the weak point in
  your teaching. It tends to lower you to the level of the Epicureans. And it
  gives you a false and unworthy notion of God, who is our Father, and who
  bears the troubles of His children'."</p>

  <p>From that we passed to other matters, most of which I shall omit&mdash;
  details about the fourth gospel, about its authorship and about Scaurus's
  view, that it blended history with allegory. On some of these he thought that
  Scaurus might be correct. But he was doubtful as to the possibility of
  explaining, as Scaurus had suggested, the different order in which the
  evangelists place the purification of the Temple. "For," said he, "it seems
  to me scarcely possible that, within the time from Tiberius to Trajan, an
  evangelist should be led to change the order of such an event simply because
  of its order in some one book&mdash;because it was placed at what Gentiles
  might take to be the beginning (being really the end) of a Hebrew gospel." At
  the same time Clemens admitted that there was an astonishing difference of
  opinion among Christians as to the period of Christ's preaching, "and," said
  he, "instead of quoting statements or referring to historical facts, they
  often quote prophecies, or argue from the fitness of things. It is all very
  unsatisfactory."</p>

  <p>Of this I afterwards had experience. For, after I had become a Christian,
  I found that some, even though they received the gospel of John, argued that
  Christ could only have preached for one year&mdash;because Isaiah contains
  the words, "to preach the acceptable year of the Lord "! On the other hand,
  the young Irenaeus, bitterly attacking this view, maintained that Christ must
  have preached till His fortieth or fiftieth year! As I have said above, I
  have actually heard him supporting this extraordinary supposition by
  appealing to the authority of the elders that had seen John!</p>

  <p>Clemens therefore admitted that he could not feel certain as to the order
  of events in John's gospel. It might be, he said, that two events, mentioned
  in different parts of the gospel as taking place at, or before, a feast, and
  apparently at, or before, different feasts, might really have taken place at,
  or before, the same feast. Among several details in which he agreed with
  Scaurus, one was the narrative of the Walking on the Water. Concerning this
  he said that, according to John, the walking was not really on the water, any
  more than a city is really "<i>on</i> a sea" when it is said to lie
  "<i>on</i> the Aegean" or "<i>on</i> the Hadriatic." He also agreed with
  Scaurus as to the story about Peter plunging into the water to come to
  Christ, which might (he thought) explain Matthew's story, according to which
  Christ first walked on the water, and then Peter attempted to walk on it
  towards the Lord, but failed. Both these, he thought, might be
  metaphorical.</p>

  <p>As regards what Scaurus had said concerning the ambiguity of many words
  and phrases in the fourth gospel, Clemens admitted it. "But," said he, "my
  conviction is that the writer did not use them thus for the mere purpose of
  being ambiguous, like the oracle 'Aio te, Aeacida.' I do not deny that he
  plays upon words, but so does Isaiah. He also repeats and varies phrases, but
  so do all the prophecies and the Psalms. Similarly he is often dark and
  obscure. But are there not obscurities also in Aeschylus, and Pindar, and in
  the deepest thoughts of Plato? And whence do these arise? Not surely from a
  desire to be ambiguous, but from the lawful feeling of a great poet, prompted
  to use strange language, and sometimes dark language, that is put into his
  mind to express strange and dark thoughts. So it is with John, at least in my
  judgment. And as to other parts, which seem artificial&mdash;as, for example,
  when he repeats things twice or thrice in a kind of refrain&mdash;I should
  plead in the same way that a poet, even when most inspired, follows rules.
  Aeschylus and Pindar do not break the laws of Greek metre. Well, Jewish
  tradition also has rules of its own, quite different from ours, and I believe
  John observes them."</p>

  <p>Then he referred to Johns use of the word "<i>logos</i>." Scaurus had
  described John as leading on his readers from <i>logos</i> to <i>pathos</i>.
  Clemens admitted that this was true if <i>pathos</i> meant the affections and
  included that one affection in particular which we call "love." And he
  justified John's course. "For," said he, "if the Logos is related to God as
  word is to thought, must we not say that 'word' should include every
  expression of thought, and that the perfect Logos must be the expression of
  the perfect thought? And what thought can be more perfect than that which
  Scaurus himself suggests, in his similitude of a magnet attracting all things
  to itself and causing each attracted object to attract others, so that the
  multitudinous world is made one harmony? And in the region of the affections,
  what is this but the highest kind of love, as your friend himself testifies,
  binding men together in families, cities, nations, and destined, in the end,
  to unite all as citizens of the city of the universe, or children in the
  family of God?"</p>

  <p>Then Clemens added, without any questioning from me, that he entirely
  concurred with Scaurus in his feeling that the miracles or signs of Christ,
  however far they might be literally true, would not be so convincing a proof
  of His greatness as the power of His Spirit to infuse peace and power, yes,
  and wisdom, and harmony of thought, into the minds of those who received Him.
  "I do not mean to assert," said he, "that all who receive Christ remain
  steadfast in Him. Many have fallen away through subtle temptations of the
  world and the flesh; some few, under persecution and the open cruelty of the
  devil. But as to these last I have noted this. Strong men have fallen while
  boasting 'We can endure every torture.' Weak women have stood fast confessing
  'We can do nothing. Our strength is in the Lord. Our Saviour will stand fast
  for us.' Yes, that has been the great miracle, to see slaves changed to
  nobles, peasants and clowns to orators, fools become wise, and human beasts,
  not worthy to be called men&mdash;ape-like and wolf-like
  creatures&mdash;transmuted into citizens of the kingdom of God.</p>

  <p>"And that reminds me of what I specially admired in your friend&mdash; the
  sagacity with which he penetrated to the root of the matter, declaring that
  our religion is, in reality, no religion at all (not at least what augurs or
  priests would call a religion) but only union with a personality, a Lord and
  Saviour and Friend, who is in us and in whom we are, 'a very present help in
  trouble.' We have no system of sacrifices. For He is our sacrifice offered up
  once visibly on the cross, and offering Himself up invisibly and continually
  in the hearts of His faithful disciples. We have no code of laws. For He is
  our law, uttered by Himself once to the ears of the disciples in the two
  commandments 'Love God' and 'Love thy neighbour,' when He showed them how to
  make all men 'neighbours'; and now He utters the same law to our hearts,
  every moment of our lives, giving us a strong desire to do that which is best
  for our 'neighbours,' and helping us to see what is best, and, seeing it, to
  do it."</p>

  <p>When Clemens said, "He is our sacrifice," I thought of Paul's words,
  "Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us," and of "the blood of sprinkling"
  about which Scaurus had written.</p>

  <p>And this led me to ask concerning that other tradition which (Scaurus had
  told me) was written in the fourth gospel alone, about blood and water
  issuing from Christ's side.</p>

  <p>"That," said Clemens, "was the only passage in your friend's letter where
  I was strongly moved to ask you to stop reading that we might talk of it at
  once. His view was new to me. Yet I confess I had always found it difficult
  to explain how the writer could call on himself to testify to what he himself
  had asserted. If Aemilius Scaurus should prove right, that difficulty of mine
  would be removed. Moreover I cannot but admit that John, or any other
  disciple, would probably have been prevented by the soldiers from approaching
  to the cross close enough to distinguish the water from the blood flowing
  from His side. Yet it came on me as a shock to believe that this particular
  narrative&mdash;to which I attach great importance&mdash;was based on a
  vision. Now the shock is somewhat softened. I have been thinking over your
  friend's arguments. He is quite right in saying that in John's epistle, which
  may be called an epilogue to his gospel, the words 'He knoweth,' as expressed
  in this particular emphatic phrase, would mean 'Jesus knoweth.' The meaning
  may be the same here. Nevertheless, even if it is so, and even if the
  narrative describes a vision, I should still feel as certain as ever that
  this vision expressed the real eternal truth."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean," I said, "by eternal truth?" "I mean this," replied
  Clemens, "that the sacrifice of Christ on the cross appears to me
  foreordained from eternity and destined to last to eternity, as the symbol of
  the fundamental law of the universe, what Scaurus calls the Law of the
  Magnet. Call it a dream, if you please. Then such is my dream. But I act on
  it, or try to act on it, as a reality. The Father gives His life to men in
  giving His Son to them. The life, says the scripture, is the blood. Some of
  our brethren would not scruple to say 'God gives His blood to men.' I would
  rather say God has been giving of His life to men from the time when man was
  first created&mdash;not only as a Father and a Mother, but also as a Servant,
  serving His servants, nursing His children, 'washing their feet' (so to
  speak) as a nurse does, and as Christ did. There are two spiritual realities,
  or, if you like, two metaphors, to express this spiritual reality. One is,
  that life or blood is to be infused, like new blood, into our veins. The
  other is, that in this life, or life-blood, we are also to bathe ourselves,
  that we may be born again. I know that this will seem to you and to many
  others an exaggerated, or (as I have heard it called) an 'unsavoury and
  distasteful similitude.' But these protests are outweighed, in my mind, by
  the faith and feeling of multitudes of simple devout Christians of the
  deepest and purest insight. One of these, a woman&mdash;the most inspired of
  all women known to me with holy wisdom&mdash;continually speaks of bathing
  herself in the blood of Christ crucified; and so do some of our most inspired
  poets. You have spoken to me of 'the constraining love of Christ.' One of our
  poets&mdash;a man experienced in troubles and knowing only too well what it
  is to feel forsaken of God&mdash;describes it thus in the person of
  Christ:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">'Mine is an unchanging love:<br>
  Higher than the heights above,<br>
  Deeper than the depths beneath,<br>
  Free and faithful, strong as death,'</p>

  <p>Do not these words seem to you to come from the heart? Are they not
  heart-realities? Yet they are metaphors. Well, this same poet speaks of
  'seeing by faith' the 'stream' supplied by Christ's flowing wounds.' Are such
  visions, or metaphors, or heart-realities, lightly to be discarded? Speaking
  for myself, I cannot give up this heart-fact&mdash;if I may so call
  it&mdash;for fact it is to me, whether seen by the material or by the
  spiritual eye. Some may think it to be spiritually false. For them it must be
  (in efficacy) false, even if it were historically true. For me it is
  true."</p>

  <p>He checked himself, and then continued, "Do not suppose, dear brother and
  fellow-seeker after truth, that I expect all others to see the truth in the
  same form in which I see it. Only I should hope to induce them to see the
  same truth in <i>some</i> form. See here these words"&mdash;and he took up a
  scroll and showed them to me&mdash;"'Every wise man is a ransom for the bad.'
  Do they remind you of anything?" "Yes," said I, "they are like the saying in
  Mark and Matthew, 'The Son of man came to give his soul a ransom for many.'
  Luke omits those words." "He does," said Clemens. "Luke has 'I am among you
  as one that serveth.' John combines the two views. For first he represents
  Jesus as girt with a napkin like a servant pouring forth water in a basin and
  washing the feet of the disciples; and then he represents Him as pouring
  forth His blood and water for their souls."</p>

  <p>Then Clemens told me that the words "Every wise man is a ransom for the
  bad" were written by Philo of Alexandria, who, though a Jew, was also a
  philosopher, and he showed me a similar passage in the same writer, to the
  effect that the good and worthy and wise are both the physicians and the
  ransoms of every community in which they exist. Then he took up Ezekiel and
  read to me the vision of the dry bones in the valley, and how they come
  together into living bodies, being quickened by the breath of the Lord. Next
  he turned to Greek literature, touching on the old allegory of Amphion,.
  whose music was so sweet that the very stones were constrained by it to come
  together in unity building up the walls of a great city.</p>

  <p>"Should we be wrong," said Clemens, "in saying that all these metaphors
  (to which others might be added) from various nations and
  literatures&mdash;about 'harmony,' and 'service,' and 'ransom,' and 'blood,'
  and 'breath'&mdash;point to one deep truth, not exaggerated by Philo, that
  the less are purified by the greater, and that the greater are intended to
  sacrifice their independence and to come together with the less, in order to
  create cities and nations, which are the larger families that lead men
  towards the Fatherhood of God? No doubt, the greater are also purified by the
  less. Every community is built up and bound together by the self-sacrifice of
  all. And this binding together implies a purification of all, a cutting away
  of excessive protuberances, a purging away of selfish, isolating,
  schism-making qualities, so that each soul may take its place in the wall of
  the City of Concord. But still, as a rule, the less are purified by the
  greater; the most selfish by the least selfish; families by the father and
  the mother; peoples by their true princes, priests, and prophets. Prince,
  priest, prophet, each according to his several gift, washes the feet of his
  inferiors, and spends his life to increase and ennoble theirs. Looking back
  to our childhood, do we not recognise this, as a matter of our own
  experience? How then can we call God Father, and yet refuse to believe that
  He may be as loving as a human father, and that God's children may be
  purified by God Himself, giving His own blood in the blood of His Son as a
  ransom for the sinful souls of men?"</p>

  <p>As he said these words, he stood up, extending his hand; "I have allowed
  myself," he said, "to keep you too long, when you have many things to do.
  Once or twice, intending to check myself, I have broken loose again. I will
  not a third time. Only this word, this one additional word. Believe me,
  Aemilius Scaurus was right, in saying 'The religion of the Christians is a
  person.' But your friend went on to say '<i>and nothing more</i>,' I should
  prefer to say the same thing differently. 'Our religion is a
  person&mdash;<i>and nothing less</i>'."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36">XXXVI. &mdash; SILANUS BECOMES A CHRISTIAN</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was very late, but I was unwilling to say farewell.
  During the last two or three hours, Clemens had in some strange way so
  associated himself with my thoughts of Scaurus that I now began to feel as
  though, in parting from my new friend, I should be parting from the old
  one&mdash;whose living self I should perhaps not see again in Tusculum and
  whose likeness I was leaving in Nicopolis. But Clemens would not resume his
  seat. Quoting Scaurus's words with a kindly smile, "It takes a great deal,"
  he said, "to make you 'tired of books '." "Perhaps my old friend would not
  have been tired," I replied, "if he had had you as his interpreter. I wish he
  could have been present with us to-night." "I shall always think of him as a
  friend," said Clemens, "for your sake, for his own sake, and for truth's
  sake."</p>

  <p>Then he asked me at what hour I was to set sail, to-morrow, "or rather,"
  said he, "to-day, for it is long past midnight." "About noon," I replied.
  "Long before noon," said he, "I must be at some distance from Nicopolis on a
  visit to some sick folk. But I expect to be returning, by way of the wood
  where we first conversed together, just in time to catch sight of your vessel
  before it disappears round the cape. So you must think of me then as wishing
  you over again from a distance the good things that I now wish you face to
  face." "When we last parted," said I, as we clasped hands at the open door,
  "you wished me peace. Wish it me again." "May peace," he said, "be multiplied
  to you!" Then, drawing me gently towards himself, after standing for a moment
  as though unable to speak, "that peace," he said, "which passes
  understanding!"</p>

  <p>When I returned to my lodging I found a messenger awaiting me with a note
  from Marullus. Scaurus was still living, though unconscious. The doctors
  thought it possible, though not probable, that be might recover for a short
  time. "I fear," said Marullus, "that, by the time you receive these lines, my
  dear patron will be no more. If you wish to come, in the slight hope of
  seeing him, you will do well to come at once." I was prepared for this, so
  that it made no difference in my arrangements. These were nearly completed
  except for writing letters of farewell to friends in Nicopolis.</p>

  <p>The sun was well above the horizon before I began the letter that I had
  reserved for the last&mdash;my farewell to Epictetus. To several
  acquaintances I had been scribbling away, fluently enough. Nor had I been at
  a loss for what to say to the one or two more intimate friends to whose
  kindness I was indebted. But, all the time, there had been in my mind an
  undercurrent of anxious questioning as to what I should say to the man to
  whom I owed most. Should I explain? Should I confess? Should I distinguish
  between what I had received from him for which I was his debtor, and what I
  had not been able to receive so that I could not call myself indebted? To
  what end? Whatever might happen in the future, I could never cease to be
  grateful to him for having raised me to a higher sense of a life above the
  level of the Beast, and for stimulating me to follow and revere the Man. What
  though a new ideal of the Man had been presented to me? Did that make me less
  Epictetus's debtor? Nay, did it not possibly increase my debt, because, but
  for him, I might not have taken&mdash;if ever I should be proved to have
  taken&mdash;the path that led towards a, higher and nobler goal?</p>

  <p>I wrote, tore up, re-wrote, corrected, re-corrected, and again rewrote.
  There was a want of directness in all my attempts, and they all ended in
  tearing up. At last I said, "I will try to write as my Master himself would
  have written." That made my letter of the briefest. After explaining my
  sudden departure, and thanking him for his teaching, "I am your debtor," I
  wrote, "and always shall be." I was on the point of adding, "If ever I
  possess myself, I shall owe myself to you." But the words struck me as
  familiar. Then I remembered something like them in the Epistle to Philemon:
  "I say not unto thee how that thou owest to me even thine own self." "Could I
  say with strict Epictetian truth that I owed to Epictetus as much as Philemon
  owed to Paul? I re-wrote it thus: "If ever I possess myself I shall in large
  measure owe myself to you." That had the disadvantage of being a little
  longer, but the advantage of being quite true. Sealing the letter that I
  might not be tempted to alter it again, I threw myself down for two or three
  hours of rest.</p>

  <p>A little before noon my servant roused me. All was ready,, and we went
  down at once to the quay. Besides the usual bustle&mdash;sailors, fishermen,
  merchants, passengers mostly in a hurry&mdash;there was some dispute (I know
  not what, but I think it was among the fishermen). This added to the
  confusion. Not many blows were interchanged, but there was no lack of
  threats, imprecations, scurrilous jests, and obscene abuse. As I was making
  my way through the crowd, some one touched me on the shoulder. It was my
  Epicurean friend, Apronius Rufus, whom I had last seen in the little village
  of Lycus, scattering nuts and figs to make the schoolboys scramble. I had
  caught sight of him, a minute or two before, lounging in a comer and looking
  on at the quarrelsome crowd; but being in no mood for his jests I had turned
  aside in the vain hope that he would not see me. As soon as he overtook me,
  he began in his usual fashion, "What brings you here at this hour, most
  serious Cynic? A truant humour, I fear. For it is lecture time, or at all
  events not much past: and Epictetus gives long lessons. Yet no. You are no
  truant. Truants don't look so serious. You have come here as a philosopher,
  to see life as it is, and to set up as a heretic. You come from books to
  things; from ideals to facts. Good! Now begin to learn! Look at these bipeds!
  Look, and listen! Up above, in your schoolroom, they were 'sons of God,' were
  they not! Look, then, at that son of God hitting his brother son of God in
  the eye! Listen to those two daughters of God and their harmonious
  antiphon!"</p>

  <p>I was vexed, but let him talk on, as being the best means of getting
  myself free from him without explanation; and he, following close behind me,
  kept pouring his jests into my ear, till, I suppose, he got a clearer view of
  my face. For he suddenly checked himself, saying, "But, my dear Silanus,
  pardon me if something is really wrong. You would not, I am sure, let my idle
  talk pain you. Your servant is here with baggage. I fear some bad news is
  taking you from Nicopolis." Then I briefly explained.</p>

  <p>He had some slight acquaintance with Scaurus and was instantly and
  sincerely apologetic. "I was a fool," said he, "not to have noticed that
  something was amiss. Really I am grieved. And Scaurus, too! That fine old
  soldier! Often have I heard my father speak of his splendid service in
  Moesia. Well, Silanus, there are humanities as well as philosophies. Believe
  me, I feel with you. Farewell! Forgive me as sincerely as I condemn myself"
  He pressed my hand, and I his. He was a good fellow at heart and died in
  Syria, a soldier's death&mdash;such as Scaurus would have approved and no
  Cynic could have censured.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes, we were outside the port, seeing from a distance
  (without hearing) the bustle on the quay. It was not an unpleasing scene
  &mdash;now. A few minutes more, and the whole of the city stood out as a
  bright picture in a framework of fields. Presently Nicopolis was receding and
  lessening. Hills rose up behind. The frame was becoming the picture and
  Nicopolis a small part in it. I paced the deck, this way and that, turning in
  my mind all that had befallen me since I had gazed on these same scenes in
  reversed order, arriving from Italy. How few days ago in time! How many ages
  ago in thought and experience!" What strange things," I exclaimed, "what
  marvellous things have happened to me! Am I not a changed man?" Then a sense
  of unreality began to creep over me. "Am I not, after all, the same Silanus,
  recovering from a dream? Have these 'strange things' been real things? Have
  they not been mere pictures&mdash;pictures of the mind, phantasms, dreams,
  from which I, the old Silanus, am now awaking to find myself just what I was
  in old days when I was wasting my time in Rome?"</p>

  <p>I looked back on Nicopolis and it was now little more than a hamlet, and
  the quay was a dot. But it still loomed large on my mind. I had spoken of
  "phantasms" and "dreams." But I could not think of the human scene in the
  harbour as a "dream." Only too life-like were those bipeds&mdash;noisy,
  scurrilous, vile, obscene! How unworthy of the bright and glorious sunlight
  in which all things were bathed at that moment of full noon&mdash;all things
  in heaven and earth! How glorious was everything except man! Yes, everything
  except man! Rufus spoke in jest, but did he not speak the truth? What were
  those "sons of God" on the quay? Surely, surely, they were "sons of clay,"
  mere puppets to play with and break! To this day I cannot tell why just at
  this moment so strong a temptation should have so suddenly seized me. But
  seize me it did. I write it as it happened, that others may take heart if the
  same thing should happen to them. It was God's way of dealing with me,
  suffering me to be almost cast down by evil that He might lift me up for
  good.</p>

  <p>Feeling the evil coming, I tried at first to strengthen myself with the
  sayings of my Master, Epictetus, "See then that thou do nothing as a beast.
  Else thou hast lost the Man. Thou hast not fulfilled the promise of the Man,"
  and again, "Man is a being that has nothing more sovereign than his will. He
  has all other things in subjection to this." Then I thought of Man as the
  Psalmist describes him, saying to God, "Thou hast put all things under his
  feet... yea, and the beasts of the field," and how the Christians regarded
  this as meaning that Man was to triumph over sin.</p>

  <p>But, against these hopeful thoughts, there rose up, first, the confessions
  of Epictetus that he had never succeeded in producing a Man of this kind, nor
  anything approaching to it; and then the words of the other Psalm, "Man being
  in honour hath no understanding, but is like unto the beasts that perish." I
  longed to believe the good Voices, but truth seemed to compel me to believe
  the bad Voices. Worst and strongest of all, there rose up recollections of my
  own evil deeds, words, and thoughts, from childhood upwards, and they
  strengthened the Voices of evil. I could not at that moment recall the
  brighter and better side of my own life. I could not remind myself how
  different a man in a crowd may be for a moment from the same man in his home
  and at his work during his daily life. It seemed to me that I ought to be on
  my guard against hoping contrary to facts. Was not Glaucus right in taunting
  me with "self-deceiving," which I called "believing"? Was it not the plain
  and manifest fact that the Beast was Lord over the Man?</p>

  <p>Again and again this question put itself before me, as though from the
  mouth of the Beast, saying, "Am I not your Lord? Can you honestly deny it?"
  And at that instant I could not deny it. Never had I felt so weak, so
  forsaken&mdash;abandoned by all the hopes that had been lately gathering
  round me, more hopeless than if I had never entertained them.</p>

  <p>But just when I seemed to be touching the bottom of the lowest depth, I
  received a sense of the nearness of 'help. If I could not trust in the Good,
  at least I could rebel against the Evil. What though the Beast be Lord of
  mankind? "At least," I exclaimed, "there are those who will not be his
  slaves&mdash;Epictetus, Scaurus, my father, others known to me, multitudes
  unknown. Rather than submit to the Beast, it is better to be on the conquered
  side&mdash;along with the good, and worthy and noble. It is better, yes much
  better, to be on the side of the Man crushed down, trampled on, destroyed!"
  Then a great longing fell on me that the Man thus crushed down and destroyed
  by the Beast might prove to be not destroyed in the end, for such a Man, if
  only He existed, seemed the only fit object of worship for mankind. Yes,
  victorious or defeated, He alone was to be worshipped. "Whom have I in heaven
  but thee? And there is none upon earth that I desire in comparison with thee,
  thou FORSAKEN SON OF GOD!"</p>

  <p>As I uttered these words I remembered where I had first uttered
  them&mdash;on the hills yonder, while I was thinking of Glaucus's troubles
  just before I met my new friend Clemens. That made me think of him and of his
  promise to wait on the hill, and look on my vessel as it vanished, and "wish
  me well." I glanced back over the stern just in time to see our little
  coppice disappearing. "Clemens," I said, "is there. Clemens is praying for
  me." With that, there came back to me all he had said about the power of the
  FORSAKEN to help those who felt "forsaken"; and about the "cross," as the
  real throne whereon the Son of man reigns as the real king and subjects all
  things to Himself. In that moment I understood how both the Psalms were true
  : "Man being in honour&mdash;<i>as the world counts honour</i>&mdash;is like
  unto the beasts that perish." But "man being in honour&mdash;<i>as God counts
  honour</i>&mdash;is uplifted on the throne of suffering and reigns over those
  for whom He suffers and whom He redeems." A sudden conviction fell upon me
  that here at last I had the light that makes all things clear, and I cried
  from the deepest depth of my being, "Whom have I in heaven but thee, O thou
  forsaken one that art NOT FORSAKEN? And there is none upon earth that I
  desire in comparison with thee. Make no long tarrying, O my Helper and my
  Redeemer!"</p>

  <p>All this, which takes time to describe, passed in the twinkling of an eye,
  and then something befell me that I cannot exactly describe. Only I know that
  it was no act of reason. Nor was it vision. It was more like feeling. The arm
  of the Lord seemed to lift me up and carry me to something that I felt to be
  the Cross. Then the thought of the Cross sent down upon me the thought of an
  overwhelming flood of the mighty love and pity of God, the Father of the
  fatherless and Servant of the meanest of His servants, descending on my soul
  from the side of the Saviour and bathing me in His purifying blood, creating
  me anew in the eternal Son. And thus, at last, after so many delays,
  refusals, and resistances, willingly led captive out of the dominion of
  darkness and fear and sin, I was carried as a little child into the joy of
  the family of God.</p>

  <p>When I reached Tusculum, Scaurus was in his grave. He had died on the day
  when I left Nicopolis, and about noon. I could not discover among his papers
  any last instructions, or indications of any wishes connected with the
  subject of his last letter. Only I found a paper with "For Hermas's tomb" on
  it. Below was written in large characters IN PEACE. I asked Marullus whether
  he understood this. He said that on the morning of the last day of his active
  and conscious life the old man had gone (with Marullus's aid, for he was very
  feeble) to see the tomb he had erected for Hermas in years gone by. After
  standing for some time silent he repeated aloud the last words of the
  inscription, "For memory's sake." "That," said he, "is not enough." Then, as
  they walked home, he said, "Hermas would have liked IN PEACE. There is room.
  See that those words are added." I saw that they were added. I also placed
  them on Scaurus's own tomb.</p>

  <p>For the rest, in the years that followed&mdash;forty-five in
  number&mdash;nothing has befallen me that would greatly interest my readers.
  I became a soldier. Many of the brethren condemned me for it. But when the
  war broke out in Illyria I felt that, although a Christian, I had no right to
  cease to become a Roman, or to spare my blood, if need arose, in defence of
  the peace of the Empire. In doing this, I was glad to think that I had
  fulfilled Scaurus's last wish. Clemens also supported me.</p>

  <p>From him I received several letters before I went to Illyria. Soon
  afterwards, he passed away in Corinth, but not before he had done for Glaucus
  the same service that he did for me. His first letter told me that he had
  seen my vessel at noontide from the hills above Nicopolis, and that he had
  kept his promise of "wishing me well." He always called me brother ; and no
  brother could have been more brotherly. But assuredly he was more than that.
  Paul sowed the seed of the gospel in my heart, but it was the spirit of
  Clemens that helped to quicken and to foster it. He was my father in the
  faith.</p>

  <p>Yet Scaurus, too, was a helper&mdash;helper in deed even when opposing in
  word&mdash;guiding me indirectly towards the City of Truth. I have read
  Apologies for the Christian faith written by worthy men&mdash;Justin for
  example and others. But they have not helped me towards Christ as Scaurus
  did. They have been special pleaders for their religion, and sometimes great
  manipulators of words and arguments. But what Scaurus said, even in dispraise
  of the gospels, was often so qualified by praise, admiration, yes, and love,
  of the character of the Saviour, that it had much more effect with me than
  the arguments of Justin afterwards had, when I came to know them. Moreover
  Scaurus was such a lover of truth, and so quick and keen to detect an
  untruth, that in meeting his attacks upon the gospels I felt I had met the
  worst. I doubt not that he has found peace in one of the "many mansions." If
  I may not call him my father in the faith, yet certainly he was the kindest
  of stepfathers, helping me to the living Truth by causing me to love all
  truth, and indirectly strengthening my feet in the path towards the Saviour
  by not suffering me to walk too soon.</p>

  <p>And you, too, good Epictetus, truth-loving, keen Epictetus&mdash;I will
  not say "kind Epictetus," not at least always kind in word, though always
  good at heart even when most bitter in word&mdash;always fervid against
  falsehood, always zealous with a fiery zeal for that strange cold aspect of a
  "Father of all" in which you placed your trust and strove to make us place
  ours : what shall I say of you and how thank you for the help you gave me !
  How often in Rome and Tusculum, how often on night watches in Illyria,
  Moesia, and the East, have I seen your face, dear Master, as I saw it for the
  last time in Nicopolis, leaving you without bidding you farewell, spying on
  you unfairly through the open door, and detecting you in the act of breaking
  the rules of your own philosophy by feeling trouble, real trouble, for a
  sorely troubled disciple ! Epictetus in trouble, yes, Epictetus in trouble,
  that is how I shall remember you to my dying day, as seen in the moment when
  I trusted your teaching least and loved you most, when you dropped the veil
  of your philosophy to show me your real human heart&mdash;my "tutor" to bring
  me to Christ.</p>
