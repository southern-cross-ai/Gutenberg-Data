<h3>ABOUT THIS BOOK</h3>

<p class="first"> MISS BOWEN'S new novel has an Elizabethan
setting. The character of the Queen figures in the earlier stages
of the story at the Mortlake home of Dr. John Dee, her court
astrologer. John Dee and Sir Edward Kelly, his extraordinary
assistant, a man so remarkable that it is not yet known if he
were charlatan or genius, are two of the main characters. They
set out from Mortlake in quest of strange adventures and finally
arrive at Prague, the home of the alchemists, and secure the
attention of the mad Emperor Rudolph&mdash;himself an "adept."
Edward Kelly gains complete domination over Dee and finally
succeeds in winning from him his young and beautiful wife. The
story is not a fantasy, but combines with the quest for the
unattainable the sternest and most gorgeous realities of life.
Miss Bowen makes splendid use of her material and has written a
wonderfully effective novel of an heroic and gallant, if
fantastic and wild adventure, against the lurid and magnificent
background of the Renaissance.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. &mdash; I DWELT IN HIGH
PLACES</h2>

<p class="first">JANE DEE pretended to herself that she had not
heard the bell of the great door ring; it seemed, after all, but
a tinkle in the sweet rushing and sighing of the March winds that
filled the house by the river with the rumour of tumult. She was
very tired after many weeks of anxiety and work, the coming and
going of strangers, the illness of Arthur, her eldest child, the
trouble with a dishonest maid and that strange frightening affair
with Barnabas Saul, her husband's assistant.</p>

<p>It was so soothing to sit alone in the large parlour and to
know that there would be nothing to do till supper-time when
Ellen Cole would bring the two children home from Petersham,
where they had gone to see Nurse Garrett, when her husband would
come down from his laboratory and there would probably be
visitors who would sit in the lamplight and talk of matters which
she, Jane Dee, did not understand.</p>

<p>The wind blew down the wide chimney shaft and stirred the
flames from the sea-coal fire beside which the exhausted woman
sat sunk in the deep tapestry chair with arms, her hands
interlocked behind her head and her long limbs outstretched. She
could see, through the long, diamond-paned window, the grey river
hastening by and, on the further bank, the bare willows, dragged
sideways by the winds, the perished weeds and grasses of last
year, beaten and broken above the soggy earth.</p>

<p>Trailing, loose clouds, one close above another, flew
seawards. Jane Dee, watching this movement of river, clouds and
willows, all swift, grey and flowing in the same direction, away
from Mortlake, away from London, from England, out to the ocean,
felt a sensation of release and freedom, as if her soul were
loosened from her body and escaping down the river.</p>

<p>The bell tinkled again.</p>

<p>Jane Dee did not move. She hoped that whoever was without
would go away believing the house to be empty. So many people
came to see her husband on selfish errands, many of them
consuming food that she, the anxious housewife, could ill afford,
or staying for days in the spare room above the hall and
demanding service that she could ill provide.</p>

<p>And so long a pause passed that Jane Dee believed that she had
indeed deceived the person without and that he had departed. Her
body, beautifully formed, relaxed in her shabby, heavy gown, and
the pure outline of her face and throat sank against the faded
cushions, while her large, dark eyes gazed drowsily at the
passage of the clouds and water, the bend of weed and willow
without the long window.</p>

<p>She was twenty-five years old, highly born, finely bred. An
expression of proud resignation on her delicate face masked
restless discontents. Nervous outbursts of violent temper had
already marred her small features with fine lines of passion and
regret, but her brow was noble, her movements full of grace, and
there was about her all the dignity of a woman faithfully devoted
to tedious duties, who never thought of her own pleasure or
convenience.</p>

<p>Even now, as she sank into a half sleep, little worrying
questions shot through her tired mind. Would Ellen Cole be able
to get something for the baby's cough from Nurse Garrett? Could
she be trusted to see that Arthur did not slip into the river on
the way home? Would the new maids really arrive
to-morrow?&mdash;and be of any use? Would that horrible affair
with Barnabas Saul damage her husband? How would she contrive if
some money did not come in soon?</p>

<p>They would have to sell something more&mdash;one of the
standing cups with covers, perhaps. How she disliked seeing the
good pieces of plate go out of the house!</p>

<p>The bell rang again, the sharp sound of it penetrated her
drowsy worries. She sat up quickly, then rose with a sigh.
Perhaps, after all, she had better go; it might be a messenger
from someone important&mdash;even, perhaps, from the Queen.</p>

<p>As she moved towards the great outer door she frowned with
vexation. Why must her husband choose to-day to send the two
menservants, Benjamin and George, on some crazy errand in Robin
Jacke's boat up the river, and why could not Roger Cook or one of
the other assistants sometimes hear the bell?</p>

<p>It was all very well for them to shut themselves up in a
distant part of the rambling old house and refuse to disturb
themselves for anything; no one cared for her peace and
quiet.</p>

<p>She opened the door in a temper, a vast rush of soft wind blew
over her, and she found herself face to face with a stranger.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">"My husband can see no one," said Jane Dee
coldly, but she was conscious of a sudden exhilaration. The wind
blew her clothes away from her body, her hair away from her face
and she knew, for a second, the sensation of being disembodied,
of mounting the wind and flying away from Jane Dee and all her
cares and labours.</p>

<p>The stranger stood silent a second, holding his wide-leaved
hat; his thin cloak blew about him and his head was slightly bent
against the wind.</p>

<p>Jane Dee observed, curiously, the graceful shape of his
person, and the intent stare of his pale, grey eyes. There was
something remarkable in the silent persistency of his
attitude.</p>

<p>"My husband will see no one," she repeated with less
confidence. The wind rushed past her into the house and she put
up her hand to catch at her flying locks.</p>

<p>"May I come in and tell you my business?"</p>

<p>"That would be no use, I know nothing of my husband's
affairs."</p>

<p>But Jane Dee was slightly flattered, because no one had ever
before treated her as anything but a housewife.</p>

<p>"You must know something of this, it has to do with Barnabas
Saul."</p>

<p>She frowned, for this was an unpleasant subject.</p>

<p>"Come inside, then, sir, for I can hardly hear for the
wind."</p>

<p>He was instantly across the threshold and she closed the heavy
door. She frowned again, for her peaceful afternoon's rest was
spoiled. She wished that she had gone to her own room where she
would not have heard the bell, instead of yielding to fatigue and
the fascination of the gray river view from the long window of
the panelled parlour.</p>

<p>Yet she sighed as well as frowned; perhaps it was fortunate
that she, instead of her husband, should deal with the vexatious
matter of Barnabas Saul.</p>

<p>She sank into the tapestried chair beside the windblown fire
and asked the stranger to tell her quickly what his errand was.
She was unconscious that she was a beautiful object at which to
gaze, for her worn dress was a pleasing grey-green, like the
river without, and her black hair, slightly dishevelled, fell in
lines of natural grace around her pale, serious face, while her
attitude, weary and dignified, was unconsciously lovely. It was
years since she had thought of herself at all.</p>

<p>"Have you come from Barnabas Saul? My husband will not take
him back. He may have been acquitted," she added defiantly, "but
I never believed him to be anything but a poor trickster."</p>

<p>"I daresay he was only that. No&mdash;I do not come from him.
But to take his place."</p>

<p>"No!" exclaimed Jane Dee violently. "No!"</p>

<p>The stranger smiled and cast full on her his pale, sad glance.
She rose, anxious to get him out of the house.</p>

<p>"My husband will have nothing more to do with that. He was
cruelly deceived by Barnabas Saul. You must go at once."</p>

<p>"Is not Dr. Dee searching for a skryer, one who can see the
spirits?"</p>

<p>"No. He will not meddle any more, I tell you. He is not
interested in any magic."</p>

<p>"Surely you mistake, or else you are afraid of me, Mrs. Dee?"
The stranger smiled gently. "My name is Edward Talbot; I can skry
very well. I have a number of spirits at my command. I feel sure
that Dr. Dee would wish to try my powers."</p>

<p>Jane replied vigorously.</p>

<p>"It is a mischievous folly. My husband, who has so much
learning and wisdom, has been tempted to experiment; but it has
already been worse than useless. A costly waste of time. I am
sure that he will never try anyone else. He and his assistants
are now much occupied in other studies."</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Talbot made no effort to move, though the lady
stood impatiently, half-turned towards the door; and his very
immobility caused her, against her own wish, to give him a keen
consideration.</p>

<p>He was about her own age, very finely and strongly built,
dressed elegantly in grey; his features were small, the nostrils
flaring widely, the mouth beautifully shaped and pale; his eyes,
very large and set wide apart, were extraordinary, light as
silver, with a metallic gleam, so that he sometimes appeared
blind, yet full of a brilliant life, of tenderness, humour and
passion, and delicately set under straight, thin brows. The whole
face was resigned in expression and of a peculiar, tragic beauty.
He wore, what Jane Dee had only seen on much older men, a close
cap of black silk, so tight fitting and drawn so low over brow
and neck that none of his hair was visible. She disliked him
intensely; he filled her with a shuddering apprehension of
unnameable disaster.</p>

<p>He smiled as if he saw her fear and her weakening.</p>

<p>"I will remain here until Dr. Dee comes down from his
laboratories. I am sure that he will give me a trial."</p>

<p>Jane Dee had not told the truth when she had said that her
husband was not searching for a slayer. Despite the many failures
that he had had, and the trouble with the rogue Barnabas Saul,
who had been arrested for sorcery, despite the fearful dangers
attending a study that might any moment contravene the laws and
provoke the most frightful punishments, John Dee was still
searching for someone who would help in the occult experiments
that he could not resist.</p>

<p>Jane Dee felt uneasy. If this strange young man whom she
disliked so much did wait for her husband and tell him that she
had tried to 'turn him away, Dr. Dee would be very vexed and
chide her for an ignorant, wilful woman. It would be better to
face the danger boldly and to appeal to her husband to have done
with this most perilous matter.</p>

<p>"Stay here, then," she said quietly. "I will go to Dr. Dee
myself. Does he know your name or have you any friend of ours to
answer for you?"</p>

<p>"None," replied Edward Talbot. He spread his hands to warm
before the flaring fire, and she noticed how beautifully shaped
they were and that on one index finger was a ring of polished
jet.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">John Dee was working in his laboratory with his
assistants. This room, with adjacent workshops, occupied a large
portion of the upper storey of the ancient house which he had
inherited recently from his mother. He had added various
buildings to the original structure and incorporated with it
several cottages where his assistants and many of the strange
guests whom he entertained were lodged.</p>

<p>These annexes were approached by a stairway from the
laboratory, and had their own yard, so that Dr. Dee was shut away
when at work from the original house and garden where his family
resided, with Ellen Cole, the children's nurse, George and
Benjamin, the two menservants, and two maids who were constantly
being changed.</p>

<p>Jane Dee very seldom came to the laboratories; she was not
interested in them, and she had a great deal to do in her own
apartments. As she went down the long lobby which led from the
house to the workshops she caught glimpses of the river from the
low-set windows. The wind still blew strongly and the tide was
racing to the sea.</p>

<p>The floor of the passage was very uneven, there were cobwebs
and dust in the window frames and the plaster was flaking from
the walls. Jane Dee sighed. This part of the house was beyond her
province. She often complained of the inconvenience of the
arrangements of the old building, but sometimes she was glad that
she lived in this ancient house, which had been standing when her
grandfather was young. She liked the garden, sloping to the
river, the landing stage and the ancient arch, she even liked the
low, rambling rooms, with the long windows, the rich, deep-cut
panelling and the carved, painted roses on the ceiling. Often,
too, when she was most vexed and weary she liked to think of the
ghosts of all the other women who had toiled there and that some
day she, too, would join them&mdash;a shadow among shadows.</p>

<p>She had to pass through the long library before she came to
the laboratory. This was a place she could not see without great
respect and awe, for she knew it to contain one of the most
valuable collections of books and manuscripts in the world, said
to be worth a very large sum of money, perhaps as much as two
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>In this long, low room, which had been built in the old days
for music and dancing, were several valuable scientific
instruments which Jane Dee always regarded with exasperated
admiration, so marvellous were they to her, and so incapable did
she feel of even remotely understanding their purposes.</p>

<p>There was the quadrant made by Richard Chancellor, the
explorer, who had perished years ago in the distant, dreadful
White Seas; there was, swinging in a frame, a <i>radius
astronomicus</i> or telescope, and two globes made specially for
John Dee by Gerard Mercator, together with several compasses and
theories, and many great chests full of boxes containing deeds,
records, seals and coats of arms, all of great value to heralds
and antiquaries, but depressing Jane Dee with a sense of dusty
futility.</p>

<p>She would rather have seen great stores of household linen,
shelves filled with jars of conserves and balm, bottles of
medicine and wine, fine stores of soap and candles, good bales of
woollen cloth and barrels of dried fish for Lent, all of which
commodities the house at Mortlake was very deficient in.</p>

<p>Jane Dee knocked at the door of the first laboratory, then
entered nervously without waiting for an answer.</p>

<p>There were three laboratories as well as rambling workshops
beyond, and garrets filled with all manner of objects for
chemical and mathematical research. All this portion of the house
smelt of the fumes of strange compounds which were constantly
being dissolved into vapours.</p>

<p>Jane Dee hesitated on the threshold. The room looked towards
the river and was full of grey light that flowed through the
northward windows. Roger Cook, the eldest of the assistants, sat
at a long table covered with glass retorts and limbecks that
shone like bubbles; he was mixing a red paste on a little square
of alabaster and his demeanour was, as usual, melancholy and
sullen. He pretended not to see Jane Dee, but hunched himself
more closely over his work.</p>

<p>John Dee was standing at a sink in the corner, showing Mr.
John Lewis, the doctor's son, how to draw essential oils. This
youth was the last and youngest of the assistants, and Jane Dee
disliked him because her husband had promised him a hundred
pounds if he would help him in some discovery on which he was
engaged, and Jane Dee could not endure to think of so much money
being paid away for nothing when they were in debt with so little
coming in.</p>

<p>She sympathised with Roger Cook, who was bitterly jealous of
this diligent, quick young man who had become at once such a
favourite with his master.</p>

<p>"Sir, Dr. Dee," she said, for she was always very formal with
him. "There is someone to see you whom I cannot be rid of."
Vexation made her voice shrill. "Yet he has brought no word from
any friend and seems to me a rogue."</p>

<p>"Why, Jane! You should not have come yourself&mdash;taken the
trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are no maids," she reminded him quietly. "Ellen Cole
has taken the children to Petersham and you sent the men up the
river, I don't know why, so I had to go to the great door
myself."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I am sorry, Jane," he looked at her remorsefully. He
was always very kind and gentle with her even when she was sullen
or angry, but often, for hours together, he would forget about
her and her troubles and burdens; she believed that he had no
idea of her anxieties and fatigues. She had never loved him, but
she felt a great respect for his wisdom and learning, and an
irritated compassion for his lack of all practical qualities, and
even, at times, an affection for his candid, childlike goodness.
He was thirty years older than Jane. They had been married three
years and she was entirely devoted to his interests.</p>

<p>He wiped some drops of oil from his hands and set her a chair,
while he questioned her about the persistent stranger.</p>

<p>Jane Dee watched the scudding clouds driven by the flying east
winds and answered reluctantly. She was annoyed at the quick
interest that her husband showed when he heard that the man
claimed to be a seer of spirits.</p>

<p>"I should have thought that you would have had a lesson with
Barnabas Saul," she said sharply. "This is such another&mdash;an
evil creature, I'm certain."</p>

<p>Roger Cook gave her a dark glance of sympathy. He had been
unable to see any spirits himself and loathed those who claimed
that they could do so.</p>

<p>"I might try him, Jane. You know how long I have searched for
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why? It is dangerous, forbidden by law&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only dealings with evil spirits or the souls of the dead are
forbidden, Jane. I have told you so often," he added gently,
"that I do not propose any matter that touches secrecy or
magic."</p>

<p>"People think that you do; all manner of slanders and rumours
go up and down."</p>

<p>"The vulgar always look askance at wisdom and learning, Jane.
I am protected by the Queen, who is herself greatly interested in
the possibilities of these experiments."</p>

<p>"If you are obstinate in this, Dr. Dee, you will ruin us all."
The tired woman spoke with great earnestness, nervously clasping
her hands. "You neglect the work that brings you just fame and
the money that we so much need, for idle, perilous speculations.
You lay yourself open to the tricks of rogues and cozeners, you
expose yourself to the derision of serious men."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Dee speaks very wisely," said Roger Cook with a scowl.
"I shall go and speak to this impostor, and if he be saucy, hand
him over to the law. Perhaps he will not be as lucky as Barnabas
Saul."</p>

<p>"Ah, Roger Cook, for a long while you have been picking and
devising a quarrel with me. I have had much to endure from your
melancholy, jealous humours."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee spoke regretfully; he was fond of Roger Cook, who had
worked faithfully under him for fourteen years, and who only of
late had revealed himself as morose and lacking in understanding
and sympathy. John Lewis, although pretending to occupy himself
with the phials of oil, was listening eagerly to the
conversation; though he had no psychic powers himself, he was
intensely interested in the subject.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee questioned his wife gently about the appearance of
this stranger and she replied shortly, affecting forgetfulness,
though the figure of the young man with the small features, large
grey eyes and close black cap was as vivid before her as if he
and not her husband stood before her outlined against the windy
grey beyond the window.</p>

<p>John Dee was a tall, spare man, alert and vigorous, who,
though fifty-five years of age, seemed only in the prime of life;
his features were precise and clear cut, his deepset eyes,
heavily lined and shadowed from excessive use, sparkled from a
continual enthusiasm; a close-cut, thin beard shaded his jaw and
chin; his dress was severe and neglected. As he took off his work
apron his wife addressed him with asperity.</p>

<p>"Where have you sent George and Benjamin? I have no one in the
house to-day at all."</p>

<p>"They have gone to Henley to fetch the Arabic book I lent to
Mr. Dalton."</p>

<p>"Was there need for two of them to go?"</p>

<p>"The book is very precious, Jane."</p>

<p>"And of more concern than my comfort, I suppose!"</p>

<p>To distract her he took a morsel of feathers from the window
sill and showed it to her on the palm of his fine hand.</p>

<p>"Why, Dr. Dee, what is that but a dead sparrow?"</p>

<p>"The cat caught it&mdash;you will notice, Jane, that it never
has had but one wing&mdash;that is all Nature gave it."</p>

<p>Roger Cook exclaimed rudely:</p>

<p>"There are many like that, who fly lop-sided and drop to the
ground and are devoured in the end."</p>

<p>"And there are those who are not winged at all, but must
always crawl, Roger Cook," replied John Dee mildly, as he slipped
into his furred gown and left the laboratory.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">When John Dee entered the large panelled parlour
the stranger was standing by the fire, which now burnt clearly,
for the wind had abated. The clouds were torn apart in the west,
and a dull red stain began to flush the tossed heavens. Mr.
Edward Talbot was looking at this prospect which was clearly
visible from the long, low window, when Dr. Dee spoke to him:</p>

<p>"Sir, why have you sought me out?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Dee, you are the wisest man in England. You possess all
the worldly learning of which man is capable. In history, logic,
geography, languages, chemistry, mathematics, in curious, rare
knowledge, in the wonder of experiments with optics you have no
equal."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee accepted these words, which were spoken without
flattery, without embarrassment; his reputation was perfectly
established in Europe.</p>

<p>"Worldly learning," repeated Mr. Edward Talbot, with his air
of quiet self-confidence emphasised. "And now I hear that you,
replete with this knowledge of earthly matters, would study the
world of spirits."</p>

<p>"Only if this may be done with reverence and piety. Far be it
from me to dabble in magic or any form of sorcery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet you, yourself, Dr. Dee, were once arraigned for the
practice of witchcraft?"</p>

<p>"I thought that most men had forgotten that; it must have
happened before you were born&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet I have heard of it. Before the Star Chamber and Bishop
Bonner in '53, was it not? A man named George Ferrys accused you
of, by spells, blinding one of his children and killing
another?"</p>

<p>"That is so," replied Dr. Dee with some anger. "But I was
cleared of all suspicion. The charge was the invention of
malicious ignorance. At the time I was writing two books for the
Duchess of Northumberland, one of which, <i>Ebbs and Floods</i>,
was much commended."</p>

<p>"That, too, I know. Yet I believe that you have been much
vexed by spiteful rumours that you deal in black magic? Even your
late medium, Barnabas Saul, was accused of sorcery."</p>

<p>"But acquitted. Yet now he says he can see no more
spirits."</p>

<p>"Did he ever see them?" asked Edward Talbot sharply.</p>

<p>"I do not know. For myself, I can see nothing. I have to thank
my God for many talents, for much industry of mind, but that gift
has been denied me." John Dee spoke sadly and, stroking his thin
beard, looked away across the room, to the river without.</p>

<p>The deepening red light of the sky was reflected on his face,
at once noble and simple, that Edward Talbot was subjecting to a
passionate scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Barnabas Saul had some such power, as I believe. He had a
spiritual visitor when he lodged over the hall, here, in this
house. And I myself had strange dreams when he was here. He saw
figures in the <i>cristallo</i>. And one directed me to go to
Oundle in Northampton, to look for some books buried there."</p>

<p>"You search always for buried treasure? For books and
manuscripts, eh, Dr. Dee?"</p>

<p>"I have always tried to preserve the treasures of the
monasteries which have been, all over the country, dispersed and
destroyed. I petitioned the late Queen, in '56, to allow me to
found a national library. I have saved much by my own
endeavours."</p>

<p>"Were the books discovered at Oundle?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Talbot laughed softly and the sound caused Dr. Dee
to come sharply to a sense of the impropriety of this
conversation wherein he was being questioned by an utter
stranger, as equal to equal. Jane Dee had often, harshly enough,
chidden him for his easiness and self-absorption which allowed
all manner of people to take advantage of him. He glanced
apprehensively at the young man, as if to discover his charm, for
some fascination he undoubtedly exercised.</p>

<p>"And now, sir, you must explain yourself. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Edward Talbot." The green-grey eyes were full of
fire and candour. "My history is curious and not easy to be
believed. It would be tedious to tell it now. I have studied at
Oxford. I have wandered much, particularly in Wales, the land of
the mystics. I have some knowledge which you may, on examination,
test." John Dee was greatly attracted by the eager, wild face,
the quick ardent words, and by the mention of Wales, for he much
cherished his own Welsh descent, but, simple-minded as he was, he
reminded himself: "The last man cozened me."</p>

<p>"Have you anyone to speak for you, Edward Talbot? Not only am
I loath to waste time, but to practice these matters with a cheat
is, in a certain sort, blasphemy."</p>

<p>"I have kept myself hidden from all. I have something precious
to conceal." The soft, caressing voice that was touched by an
accent strange to John Dee, sank to a whisper. "Something that I
can show only to you&mdash;a manuscript."</p>

<p>John Dee's face was sharp with interest.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"In the most sacred spot in Britain&mdash;Glastonbury, and
with it were two phials of red and white powder."</p>

<p>"What are these?"</p>

<p>"Though I have studied alchemy, I do not know. Nor can I
decipher the manuscript. But I can guess what precious secret I
have stumbled on."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee controlled his excitement.</p>

<p>"The elixir? So many have been deceived. But in Glastonbury!
What is it like? Have you tried any experiments with it?" He
checked himself. "But it was as a seer of spirits that you came
to me?"</p>

<p>"That is part of the same mystery. The spirits do visit me.
But I have not the globes, the tables nor even the peace of mind
necessary." He clutched the arm of the elder man. "Look yonder!
See, the clouds have fled, and what glory stains the sky!"</p>

<p>Infected by this enthusiasm, which amounted to exaltation,
John Dee gazed from the window. An <i>aurora borealis</i> of
crimson, scarlet, gold and violet brightened the eastern and
northern heavens, and was reflected in brilliant flakes on the
river, still agitated from the rage of the lately hushed winds.
The reflection of this almost intolerable blaze was in the
panelled parlour and dimmed the glow of the sinking fire.</p>

<p>"You see," cried Mr. Edward Talbot wildly, "the very heavens
send an omen to mark my coming to you."</p>

<p>He stood with his face turned to the window, and the fiery
glow stained his features red and gave a look of flame to his
strange eyes, over which the straight brows frowned.</p>

<p>John Dee was much moved by this face, which had at that moment
an unearthly beauty, tragic, wistful and almost terrible.</p>

<p>"Fetch your manuscript, Mr. Talbot, and bring that and the
powders to me."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee also watched the extraordinary sunset
which cast such furious colours into the east and north. The
willows on the opposite bank were now dark and insignificant, the
mud and dead weeds on the river bank were transformed into lines
and droplets of light, where the blaze caught the rain drippings.
Jane thought of the marvellous Elixir of Life and Philosopher's
Stone of which she had heard so much, and which was capable of
turning all that it touched into gold. Her husband had often
spoken to her of this but he had not yet tampered with hermetic
experiments, or so she believed. Yet, with what reverence would
he speak of Roger Bacon, Saint Dunstan, Raymond Lull, Albertus
Magnus and Paracelsus, who had always striven to achieve
illimitable knowledge, to set free the spiritual elements in all
chemical substances and metals, and to attain god-like powers of
wisdom, of healing and to learn secrets hitherto unguessed at by
man!</p>

<p>How often had not her husband spoken to her of the vapours
rising from his retorts, the souls of the various substances
being compounded, and of the strange shapes, some menacing, some
gentle, with which these spirits escaped into the air.</p>

<p>Gold! Jane Dee leaned further from the window and watched the
transient glitter on river and puddle, the vapours which seemed
to burn in the harsh blue heavens; the metal weather vane on
Mortlake Church appeared to be on fire. She knew that the
discovery of the transmutation of metals, the knowledge of how to
make gold would be as nothing to her husband compared to that
other wisdom he hoped to attain, but, for herself, she would very
gladly have had a little of the precious metal, even if it were
only to the value of a hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Though her husband was so famous, so sought after, so learned,
though he held the envied post of Astrologer to the Queen, the
only sure income that he could count on was eighty pounds a year
which came from the Midland rectories which he held as sinecure
through special dispensation of Archbishop Parker; the rest of
his revenue had to be made up from odd, erratic gifts from the
Queen and other patrons, like the Walsinghams or the Burleighs,
by fees from pupils and presents from visitors who came to see
the famous library or to have their horoscopes cast, from the
Mortlake property John Dee had lately inherited from his mother,
and, too frequently, by loans or the sale of some valued object
given to the astrologer by a wealthy client.</p>

<p>Jane Dee frowned; mentally, she accused the Queen of being
fickle and forgetful&mdash;how often had she not promised her
faithful servant whom she valued so highly some benefice or
lucrative post? More than once she had named him Provost of Eton
and then, at the last moment, the coveted place had been given to
another.</p>

<p>Thinking of these things, Jane Dee forgot the sunset and went
sadly downstairs. She and Ellen Cole would have to set out the
supper, probably there would be visitors, and Roger Cook would be
asked in, and her husband would forget that they had no cook and
ask why there was no hot dish, but only cold pies, pressed beef
and cakes.</p>

<p>Ellen Cole had returned with the two children; she was taking
off their cloaks in the panelled parlour; her arms, she said,
were aching from carrying the heavy baby, Katherine. And what a
sunset! Petersham fields had seemed alight.</p>

<p>"What did Nurse Garrett say of Kate, Ellen Cole?"</p>

<p>"She gave me some drops for her. She said that she was
thriving finely."</p>

<p>Jane Dee took the baby greedily; when she had a child held to
her breast she felt at peace, whatever her troubles. She much
disliked sending her children out to nurse and having to go long
walks to see them for a brief space when she longed to have them
about her always in the house. She was unhappily conscious that
perhaps little Kate had been weaned too soon because she had been
impatient to fetch her from her foster-mother at Petersham.</p>

<p>Jane Dee leaned back in the shabby chair, clasping the heavy,
drowsy child close under her chin, while she watched Arthur, half
asleep from the walk and the wind, nodding on the stool at her
feet. His perfect little face was stained by gingerbread crumbs,
his bright hair stood up in little curling feathers on his head,
he stared into the fire that Ellen Cole was replenishing; he was
half asleep. Only in her children did Jane Dee feel a complete
satisfaction; she hoped that she would have a large family, but
she was torn by worrying fears as to how many children could be
supported and educated. And this conflict between maternal desire
and worldly prudence angered her and her anger turned on her
husband, who had so little concern in practical matters and could
not understand her great need of comfort and protection.</p>

<p>So when John Dee came in from the garden with mud on his
habit, her private musings caused her to give him cold looks.</p>

<p>But he did not observe these, being occupied by the marvel of
the light in the heavens, and the strange visit of Mr. Edward
Talbot.</p>

<p>"He is a rogue if ever there was one," said Jane Dee, scornful
above the sleeping child on her bosom. "I hope that you turned
him away. Who is there to supper tonight?"</p>

<p>"Sir George Peckham, who comes to consult me about charts and
rudders&mdash;he goes exploring in North America and brings his
sea master, Mr. Clement. He has promised us some fish for Lent,
Jane," added John Dee, seeing her weary, sullen look.</p>

<p>"Ay, promises!" She rose and gave the child to Ellen Cole; her
hour of peace was again disturbed; she knew how these seamen ate
and drank and talked.</p>

<p>"And, Jane, Sir Harry Lee brings his brother who has been in
Muscovy. Did you note the sky, Jane? It was a portent, surely,
like the meteor last August&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused at the door, her keys in her hand.</p>

<p>"A portent of what?" she asked suspiciously. "You have sent
away that Edward Talbot?"</p>

<p>"He has gone," evaded Dr. Dee. "He lodges at Petersham."</p>

<p>"Do not allow him here again. Though I cannot see the spirits
I know that that man will bring misfortune."</p>

<p>She went out into the great kitchen; the two menservants had
returned and were getting up the fire. Their appearance was a new
vexation; they would want beer, bread and meat, and would be in
her way while she was preparing the supper.</p>

<p>As she unlocked the case that contained the scanty store of
nutmegs, cloves, ginger and pepper, she questioned them as to the
success of their journey.</p>

<p>This had proved fruitless; Mr. Dalton was away from home and
had taken the precious manuscript with him and then the servants
had hired horses to return because by river it took so long. So
good shillings that Jane Dee could have well spent herself had
been wasted as well as the time of the servants, who were well
paid and ate a great deal.</p>

<p>Jane Dee turned aside sharply to hide the vexation on her
face. The colour had faded from water and land, all was dull and
grey; the pale sky had the appearance of being bitterly cold.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">John Dee's guests came late that night and
talked much of the voyages they had made and the voyages they
hoped to make, and the newly discovered lands and seas of which
the astronomer had made maps and charts. They told many marvels
to the learned doctor, whose soul dwelt half in a world of
phantasy and speculation, and such talk was sufficient to
dissolve the walls of the old house at Mortlake and send him
voyaging on vast and desolate oceans or through untracked
forests.</p>

<p>He rejoiced that he lived in these modern times, when, as it
seemed, most unexpectedly, and surely through the wish and
guidance of Divine Providence, all the world was opened up to
eager adventurers, and every day brought some marvellous
discovery, either in the realms of Nature, or in those of
science, or in the finding of strange countries and peoples.</p>

<p>He had travelled much, but he would have liked to have been
off again with these bold, eager men, searching for the strange,
the unknown and the beautiful. They lacked money; although such
enterprises as theirs were generally profitable, it was often
difficult to raise sufficient shares in the companies that
financed these voyages of discovery, and Mr. Clements, the sea
master, asked Dr. Dee with a laugh if it were not possible for
him to discover the Philosopher's Stone and give them a few
scrapings of gold with which to fit out their ships?</p>

<p>This brought back his visitor of that afternoon to the
astronomer's mind and he felt a glow of pleasure and excitement
at the thought of Edward Talbot and his queer grey eyes, his
self-confident, excitable manner and his talk of the great book
found in the ruins of Glastonbury, perhaps on the very spot where
Saint Dunstan had practised his magic, and of the red and white
powder which might hold some long-sought and tremendous secret of
transmutation.</p>

<p>He said nothing of this, but told his guests that he was in a
like state to their own&mdash;always on the verge of some
discovery, and always lacking the means to proceed further in his
studies, hampered by the need for pence. His experiments, he
reminded them, were near as costly as their voyages; they would
be surprised, he was sure, if they were to see his account at the
glass-works at Chailey, or what he owed John Fern the potter, who
lived by the ferry, for making him all his vessels and building
his brick furnaces, while as to what he spent in chemicals, in
books, in costly instruments, it was not to be mentioned.</p>

<p>Jane Dee listened with antagonism to all this talk. It sounded
to her like boasting; though she did not doubt the wisdom of her
husband, nor the courage of the other men, she felt that all of
them would have done better to set their minds to simpler things.
She thought of all the women she knew who were married to plain
men who went about their business and kept out of debt and could
afford silk dresses and chains and horses for their wives.</p>

<p>She sighed in vexation as she ncticed the amount of food and
drink consumed, the number of candles that were burnt down to the
sockets, and all for the sake of talk about wild, barbaric lands
like Cathay and Muscovy, and frozen seas where there were nothing
but bears and ice floes, where the bodies of adventurous men
bleached.</p>

<p>She left them at last, leaving them to their charts and
designs, their talk of compasses and winds and waves, and they
did not notice her going. She went upstairs thinking anxiously of
the morrow and of the money that must soon be found somehow to
pay the servants, and for food and interest on loans; the old
house was mortgaged and her own marriage portion had long since
been spent, and all they could obtain from the Queen and their
other patrons were words and vague promises.</p>

<p>Jane Dee looked at her children who slept in little beds
either side Ellen Cole in the large room over the parlour.</p>

<p>The river was still and sparkled with reflected stars. She
paused by the window to look out over this dark but peaceful
prospect. The red lantern of a barge passed slowly by; there were
other lights, warm and kindly, glimmering in the windows of farm
houses on the north bank, across the obscure fields.</p>

<p>Jane Dee felt comforted. She was not like her husband, versed
in astronomy and astrology; the stars were to her but so many
lights, far away and mysterious, and yet the sight of them gave a
sense of protection. She stood for a while with the curtain in
her hand, looking from the prospect of the river, the dark
fields, the garden and the stars, to the two sleeping children.
Then she went softly to her own large bedroom with the sloping
floor and the worsted hangings worked in pale green wool, the
labour of herself and her mother in the days before she was
married.</p>

<p>She undressed in the dark to save the candle, putting her
clothes carefully, one by one, on the large, old chair that had
belonged to her husband's mother.</p>

<p>The starlight, which glowed through the low, latticed window,
was sufficient to show her the large bed with the handsome
curtains of twill lined with silk. She thought that they might
perhaps sell these and replace them with something cheaper. The
night seemed very still after the sudden dropping of the wind
which had sighed round the old house for so many days. In this
soft darkness she found it difficult to believe in the brilliant
colours of the marvellous sunset. Like an evil vision, too, in
the remembrance, like a phantasy wrought from her fatigues and
fears was the figure of Edward Talbot; she hoped that she would
never see him again.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was nearly dawn before the two gentlemen
adventurers at last rolled up their maps and charts and put away
their note-books, called up their servants, and rode away from
Dr. Dee's house at Mortlake.</p>

<p>The astronomer had no thought of sleep. He took the last
candle which remained from his wife's cherished store and went
through the quiet darkened house to his laboratory.</p>

<p>Edward Talbot had been in his mind all the evening, and he
went directly to the small attic above his workshop in which he
kept his shewstones. He had two of these; one had been left by a
friend who was also an alchemist, and one he had purchased
himself some years before. This was of opsidian, a ball of
volcanic lava from Ethiopia, polished till it shone like glass;
the other was a globe of pure crystal. It was in this that
Barnabas Saul had seen his few visions. John Dee had tried
several mediums with both the shewstones, but the results had
been disappointing. This, however, had not in any way shaken the
astronomer's faith. His entire being moved in a world very far
from everyday matters and there was nothing to him strange or
terrifying in the thought that he might get into direct touch
with the Angels of God.</p>

<p>He had had, himself, strange experiences, deep dreams and
tumultuous visions, and voices singing in his ears. But the power
of seeing the angelic beings whom he knew surrounded him had been
denied him, for that he must be dependent on another person, and
though he had been several times deceived and cheated, his faith
in the possibility of finding this person was by no means
shaken.</p>

<p>He handled the two globes, both of which gleamed and glittered
in the light of his one candle, and, with increasing excitement,
he thought of Edward Talbot. His desires were all sincere and
unselfish; he had no worldly ambition and felt no hankering after
any of the lures which usually serve as baits for mankind. Money,
in itself, was nothing to him, nor were honours nor titles, nor
the favours of princes, yet he was always in need of money for he
spent lavishly on his books, his instruments, his studies, and he
was often, too, deeply galled to think of poor Jane, so careful,
so anxious, so uncomplaining, so often put to great straits from
which he could not relieve her. Almost he wished he had not
burdened himself with a wife and children. When he had taken Jane
Fromont for his second wife, he had believed that the Queen's
deceptive promises would, at last, resolve themselves into some
definite benefit for himself. But this has not been so, and he
was at present in severe pecuniary difficulties, owing at least
three hundred pounds, with nothing certain coming in beyond the
eighty pounds from his two Midland rectories, and a few odd
golden angels which might be expected from the casting of
horoscopes or the drawing of charts and maps.</p>

<p>He put his little candle on the plain table before him and sat
down between the two globes, each of which was in a specially
constructed wooden frame.</p>

<p>He was fifty-five years of age, healthy, and full of vigour.
He had never known an unworthy thought and what he had ever
experienced of base and ugly in his dealings with his fellows he
had soon forgotten. He had travelled much, read much,
experimented much, and his mind had journeyed to the furthest
limits of human knowledge, to those infinite spaces where the
finite mind reeled, the senses dazzled, and human calculation
seemed but a straw borne along the wind of eternity.</p>

<p>He had for himself seen so many marvels that he was ready to
believe anything; he thought that only the ignorant and the
stupid were incredulous. The study of chemistry, of optics and of
mathematics had taught him that many things which might appear
miracles or magical to the vulgar, were, in reality, but the
result of the sequence of natural laws. He was warmly conscious
of living in an age of transition, when many old beliefs and
superstitions were cast aside like worn-out garments, and the
blinding light of truth was let in to what had been dark
places.</p>

<p>He had seen, for instance, the astronomical system of Claudius
Ptolemeus of Alexandria overthrown. These beliefs, the result of
centuries of study and observation, had held the obedient
reverence of mankind for nearly fifteen hundred years. Who had
ever dared to dispute that the earth was the stationary centre of
the universe, round which moved eight transparent crystal
spheres, each of them containing a heavenly body&mdash;the Moon,
Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed
stars, with a ninth sphere named Crimum Mobile or sometimes the
"Motion" which gave the motion to all the others? These spheres,
revolving round each other, produced each a several note of music
named the "Music of the Spheres."</p>

<p>This Ptolemaic system, as set forth in the Almagest, as the
Arabians named this syntax of astronomy, had been spread
throughout the world and was universally regarded as
unchallengeable, until Nicholas Kopernicus, a professor of
Mathematics at Rome, evolved, from his own studies, an entirely
new theory. He taught that the Moon revolved round the Earth, and
that the Earth was merely one of a number of planets revolving
round the Sun; that the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies
from East to West was caused by the actual motion of the Earth
upon its axis.</p>

<p>Nicholas Kopernicus had had the prudence to keep his
discoveries known only to the few until he was on his death-bed,
but John Dee owned a copy of his work on the Solar System and had
been one of the first Englishmen to study the new theory.</p>

<p>He thought of it now with excitement and elation&mdash;if it
were possible for the wisdom of the ages to be thus scrolled up
like a badly-written page of manuscript cast into the fire and
regarded no more, if the mind of this one man, Nicholas
Kopernicus, could re-cast the celestial system, if ordinary men
like Mr. Clements, who had sat below an hour or so before, with
his drink and his food and his charts, could go out and discover
new seas, new lands; if man could be inspired to mix from the
minerals of the earth compounds that could heal or blast; if, by
Divine grace, it were to be permitted for the first time that the
great sciences of optics and mathematics and chemistry should be
laid bare to the human intelligence, why should it not also be
permitted in this great, adventurous epoch that man should
converse directly with the spirits of God?</p>

<p>John Dee was almost tired of intellectual knowledge. He could
not remember when he had not been a diligent scholar in every
branch of learning, all had come to him so easily. He had been a
fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge, at the age of fifteen.
As a young man he had discussed mathematics as an equal with the
learned men of the Dutch universities, Gerard Mercator, Gemma
Frisius, and Antonius Gogava.</p>

<p>How long ago it seemed since he had been a student at the
University of Louvain, even then famous for its learning,
graduating as a doctor before he was twenty years old. Famous men
of all nations had come from the brilliant court of Charles V. at
Brussels to see and discourse with the famous young Englishman.
And afterwards he had lectured in mathematics at the College of
Rheims, in Paris. The audience had been older than himself, and
so large that the school would not hold it. In those years he had
come into close touch with every man of note in all branches of
learning; he had had correspondents in the Universities of
Orleans, Cologne, Heidelberg, Strasburg, and the great
universities of Italy. All that seemed very long ago, and, in a
way, useless now.</p>

<p>He had read and written on almost every subject open to the
play of the intellect of man. He was a personal friend of all the
great men of England, flattered by them, consulted by them, often
spending his time and energy in the service of their whims and
fancies. He was Astrologer to the Queen; she regarded him with a
strong affection and undertook little without seeking his advice.
He had to live at Mortlake to be near the Queen's palaces of
Richmond, Sion House, Hampton Court, Nonesuch and Greenwich, and
yet the Queen would not give him some substantial salary or place
which would keep him from worldly want and anxiety as to the
future.</p>

<p>And as he sat between his two globes, the dark sphere and the
light sphere, in the glimmer of his one candle, looking at the
stars which gleamed between the folds of the drugget curtain at
the narrow window of the garret, the old man wondered if he had
placed too much dependence on an earthly sovereign, considered
too much worldly wisdom and the acquiring of worldly
knowledge.</p>

<p>Every subject that man had ever studied, every school of
thought, every speculation of ancient and modern wisdom, was
debated in the valuable volumes which formed his precious
library. He himself had written much, rapidly and carefully.
There was, surely, something beyond all this, a Divine wisdom,
which the humble in spirit and the pure in heart might reach
without the intervention of books or writings or experiments with
limbecks, retorts and furnaces.</p>

<p>He knew himself to be a sincere and pious Christian and such
was his exalted state of mind that he felt no presumption in
daring to hope that God would give him a direct guidance by means
of his angels in order that he might achieve that high and pure
wisdom which would bless the world with a flood of enlightenment
and healing, as grateful to the corrupt and sluggish ignorance of
mankind as a flow of crystal water in a parched, neglected
desert.</p>

<p>Surely, he thought, sitting sunk in his chair and looking at
the strip of stars between the drugget curtains, this man, Edward
Talbot, might have been directly sent to him, at this, the hour
in which he had come to the limits, as it were, of his present
knowledge, exactly when his insatiable desire for intercourse
with the angels of God had become almost intolerable, when his
longing to lay himself and all he knew at the Divine service, had
become almost insupportable.</p>

<p>He was, at least, sure that Edward Talbot was no ordinary man.
The manner of his coming had been strange; how peculiar was his
person, at once beautiful and wild, and his address, ardent and
full of self-confidence, how gentle and appealing! If it had not
been for poor Jane Dee he would have had the man up at once into
his laboratory and let him sit before the crystal and search in
its depth for the figure of an angel.</p>

<p>The old man rose and went to the window and pulled aside the
worn, dusty curtain. The colourless light of dawn was over the
flat landscape, the wet fields, the huddled farms and among the
leafless trees. The stars were fading behind the pale vapour, the
river was flowing steadily eastwards.</p>

<p>John Dee, though weary, felt exalted and indulged in
phantasies. He saw himself wandering away from Mortlake and his
daily burdens, cares, worries and interruptions, going away with
Edward Talbot&mdash;yes, he surely would be his chosen
companion&mdash;they would travel together through the mystic
valleys of Wales&mdash;they would climb those veiled hills, they
would search through the mysterious fields of the Isle of Avalon!
Had not Edward Talbot said that he had discovered a marvellous
book which he could not decipher among the ruins of Glastonbury,
the cradle of Christianity in England, where St. Joseph of
Arimathea had planted one of the thorns from the crown of Christ,
which might be seen even now, blossoming fairly at
Christmastide.</p>

<p>This was the manner of hidden treasure that attracted John
Dee. He did not care much for gold, greatly as he needed it, and
sorely as he was often pricked by the lack of it. But these
books, manuscripts and precious secrets of the wise men of the
past had always lured him. When he was a young man he had gone
abroad searching in Holland and Germany for such volumes, many of
which he had found. He remembered copying out such a one&mdash;a
treatise upon shorthand and cipher by the Abbot Trithemius of
Wurzburg. He had done it in ten days with the help of a Hungarian
nobleman and when he had brought his copy back he had taken it to
the Queen and she had read it with him in her little private
walled garden at Richmond Palace. And afterwards, in a princely
and heroical fashion, she had comforted and encouraged him in his
philosophic and mathematical studies.</p>

<p>But all this was over now and seemed, indeed, very long
ago.</p>

<p>John Dee closed the curtains. He was touched by a sudden panic
fear&mdash;supposing that Edward Talbot did not return, or
supposing that he came back and refused a glimpse of his precious
manuscripts and mysterious powders?</p>

<p>John Dee took an olive wood rosary from his girdle and went
into the neighbouring room, which was fitted up as a small
oratory, and there prayed, very earnestly, that it might be
permitted to his simplicity, purity of intention and singleness
of purpose, that the Angels of God would commune with him.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">At twelve o'clock of the next day Edward Talbot
returned to Dr. Dee's house at Mortlake.</p>

<p>The astronomer had sent Mr. Lewis to watch for him so that
Jane might not be disturbed by the sight of the man to whom she
had taken such an unfortunate and unaccountable dislike.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dee was occupied with her new maids and it was not
difficult for the astronomer's assistant to look out for Mr.
Talbot and bring him quietly and quickly to the laboratories.</p>

<p>As he entered the first room where John Dee awaited him, the
astronomer scarcely dared glance at him, so afraid was he that
the impression he had received yesterday would not be confirmed,
and that the personality which had appeared to him so magnificent
and peculiar, might now be faded and commonplace. But one glance
at the person of Edward Talbot reassured him. Here was no
ordinary person, but one full of a strange fire and
vitality&mdash;a very Mercury himself.</p>

<p>"Have you brought the book, Mr. Talbot?" asked the astronomer
anxiously.</p>

<p>The young man shook his head. He was very pale and still wore
the close black cap. His hat he carried under his arm.</p>

<p>"No, I have hidden it carefully. I do not wish to carry either
that or the powder abroad in daylight."</p>

<p>"It would have been safe enough," replied John Dee with gentle
dignity. "I and my menservants often go abroad with such
treasures, and we are not molested. This is a peaceful place.
But," he added, with an eagerness he scarcely tried to disguise,
"come with me and see if any vision is allowed you in the
shewstones." And he took the young man by his short grey cloak
and led him up the wooden stairs to the garret where he had the
two globes of opsidian and crystal.</p>

<p>John Lewis was very desirous to follow, but his master told
him to stay below and beguile Roger Cook, who was not by any
means to know that spiritual experiments were taking place.</p>

<p>When they had reached the little attic where he had spent a
portion of the night between the two globes, John Dee was
trembling with excitement. He saw that Edward Talbot was looking
at him very curiously.</p>

<p>To turn the subject a little and give himself a certain pause
in which to collect his strength, he asked the young man which,
among his studies, was his favourite delight?</p>

<p>Edward Talbot shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have not gone very deeply into any matter save this of
magic," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then you have missed much," replied the astronomer. "Have you
not studied music and harmony?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot appeared to be giving very little heed to the
questions, but was looking quickly and easily about the room,
taking in, it seemed, the details of all the objects therein.</p>

<p>"My favoured study, and this after many years delving into all
the sciences, is mathematics," said John Dee.</p>

<p>He put his thin white hand lovingly on the opsidian globe.</p>

<p>"I know very little of that," replied Edward Talbot.</p>

<p>He was staring at the black globe, his broad lids drooped over
his pale eyes, his mouth was rather grimly set.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, Mr. Talbot, for mathematics, next to
theology, is most divine, most pure, ample, profound, subtle,
commodious and necessary."</p>

<p>"I have done very well without it, Dr. Dee."</p>

<p>"But you will find, if you wish to progress in your studies,
it is most necessary. Do you not remember what Plato said:
'Mathematics lifts the heart above the heavens by invisible
lines, and by its immortal beam, melts the reflection of light
incomprehensible and so procures joy and perfection
unspeakable.'"</p>

<p>The young man shook his black-covered head impatiently.</p>

<p>"I hear very little of such matters from the angels. I believe
when I get into divine company mathematics is of little
account."</p>

<p>There seemed a touch of flippancy in this remark, which caused
Dr. Dee an unpleasant shock. Was it possible that he had again
met with a cheat and cozener like Barnabas Saul?</p>

<p>He put courteously a chair for the young man, who took it with
a certain restless impatience as if he would be done with talk
and would be on with some action. But Dr. Dee, with a last
lingering of worldly prudence, made some effort to question this
new disciple, assistant, whatever he might prove to be, as to his
ability and knowledge.</p>

<p>He asked him something about optics and if he had ever heard
of the convex mirror which he, Dr. Dee, possessed, and on the
young man shaking his head and impatiently professing ignorance,
he passed on to other matters such as mechanics, and asked him if
he had heard of the water mills at Prague, where long deal boards
were sawn without any man being near; if he had ever heard of the
diving chamber supplied with air, or of the brazen head made by
Albertus Magnus, which spoke; of images, which, by means of
perspective glass, could be thrown into the air; or the sphere of
Archimedes, and of that famous German workman who was able to
make an insect of iron which buzzed about the guests' table and
then returned to his master's hand again as though it were
weary?</p>

<p>"Do you speak of magic?" asked Edward Talbot. The smile on his
pale, beautifully-shaped lips had something of a sneer.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee became angry.</p>

<p>"All these things are easily achieved by skill, will, industry
and ability duly applied. If any student or a modest Christian
philosopher did these and such like things, mathematically and
mechanically, would you count him to be a conjurer?"</p>

<p>"I believe he would be so named by the vulgar, Dr. Dee."</p>

<p>"Have you not the knowledge, Mr. Talbot, to see that such
accusations are but the folly of idiots, and the malice of the
scornful, who seek to injure one like myself who seeks no worldly
gain nor glory, but only asks of God the treasure of heavenly
wisdom and knowledge?"</p>

<p>"There are many stories told of you, Dr. Dee, and have been
for years, which incline the ignorant to believe that you are a
conjurer and sorcerer."</p>

<p>John Dee's anger flared away. He replied with a wistful
mournfulness:</p>

<p>"It is an age of wonders, and I cannot understand the
incredulity of mankind. If I wish to find more cause to glorify
the eternal and almighty Creator, shall I be condemned as a
companion of hellhounds, and a caller of wicked, damned spirits?
How great is the blindness of the multitude as to things above
their capacity!"</p>

<p>"Do you know too much to be deceived?" asked Mr. Talbot with a
keen eagerness.</p>

<p>"I have had many years of study and I have fished with a large
and costly net and been a great while a-drawing of it in with the
help of Lady Philosophy and Queen Theology and shall I at length,
catch nothing but a frog, nay, a devil?"</p>

<p>"Then, sir, if you are so sure of yourself, you will be able
to know if these spirits which I, by chance, may raise, are of
God or the Devil."</p>

<p>At this the astronomer was dismayed. A certain fear, that he
might not thus be able to distinguish among the spiritual
creatures that might appear to him, did trouble him.</p>

<p>"God knows," he said simply, "my intentions are pure."</p>

<p>Edward Talbot was looking at the crystal shewstone.</p>

<p>"What have you, or any of your slayers, seen in this?"</p>

<p>Dr. Dee recounted quietly that an angel named Annael had
appeared in that stone to Barnabas Saul, and to some others.</p>

<p>"Have you yourself seen this angel, Dr. Dee?"</p>

<p>"No, I think I told you that I myself cannot see."</p>

<p>Edward Talbot went up to the opsidian stone and stared into
it.</p>

<p>"Iwill try what I can do," he said, "though this is not set as
it should be on a table with the seals on the feet and the
figures on the underside. But," he added with emphasis, "if my
coining here is to be blessed and you and I are to work together,
Sir, to the glory of God, surely there will be some sign given
us."</p>

<p>John Dee bowed his head, trembling with hope and
expectation.</p>

<p>"I will go into the oratory and pray," he said, but Mr. Talbot
did not answer. He went on his knees before the small frame in
which was set the crystal and he begged the astronomer to draw
the drugget curtains closely across the windows and so to shut
out the view of grey river, grey sky and windbitten banks.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee eagerly did this and brought a small cushion for the
skryer to kneel on, which was refused.</p>

<p>Edward Talbot crossed his hands on his breast, closed his eyes
and fell to mumbling prayers and entreaties. His voice was low
and seemed shaken by a great passion, both of appeal and
complaint, as if he struggled with one whom he both desired and
loathed.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee thought that he had become at once unconscious and was
in a trance, such as Barnabas Saul used to fall into before he
saw his visions or the angels spoke through his lips. The figure
of the young man, shadowy in his grey clothes and black cap among
the shadows affected the astronomer with a certain sense of
pathos. He felt immensely attracted towards this mysterious
stranger, who had not yet told him anything of himself nor
satisfied him as to his history or the extent of his
knowledge.</p>

<p>He tried to keep his mind from such worldly matters, for he
felt the moment to be holy and set apart from common things. He
took his beads tightly in his hands and passed into the oratory,
casting himself before the altar and endeavouring to shut from
his mind all emotions save his intense desire to communicate with
the angels of God.</p>

<p>He succeeded, as he often could succeed, in snatching away his
spirit from his surroundings, so that he did, indeed, seem
wrapped up in a cloudiness which was not without its shoots of
glory. He scarcely knew where he was till he heard a faint cry
which brought him to his feet and sent him hurrying into the
outer room. And there he saw Edward Talbot stretched between the
two shewstones, calling out like one muttering in his sleep.</p>

<p>John Dee knelt beside him and half lifted him up.</p>

<p>The skryer at once opened his pale eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>He had seen, he said, Uriel, the spirit of light, who had told
him that these experiments were to be blessed, and that if
implicit obedience were given to the spirits, great benefits and
glories might result.</p>

<p>Tears of joy came into the astronomer's tired eyes. Before he
took any heed of the skryer who had proved so overwhelmingly
successful, he clasped his hands and gave thanks to God for thus
acceding to his humble and earnest petition for light and
wisdom.</p>

<p>Edward Talbot sat up and asked for a glass of water. He seemed
much overcome by giddiness and faintness and his features were of
an almost mortal pallor. The astronomer was about to comfort him
with kind and grateful words, but the young man sprang up with a
sound like a sob, and with a movement as if he were in a violent
temper, hastened from the house.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">During the whole of April Edward Talbot came
secretly to Dr. Dee's house and conducted experiments in the
little room above the workshop which was next to the oratory.</p>

<p>Every time he knelt before the shewstones the angels appeared
and gave minute directions as to what was to be done to secure
the revelations they would finally make.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee got down from his shelves the Liber Mysteriorum (Book
of Mysteries) in which he had begun to note the results of the
sittings with Barnabas Saul and some others. He still knew
nothing of Edward Talbot, nor did he trouble to ask, for he was
confident that the angels would not have chosen an unworthy
medium.</p>

<p>But there were others in the establishment at Mortlake who
were not so easily satisfied. Private as the sittings were kept,
Roger Cook had jealously pried them out.</p>

<p>After a passionate protest to his master, which was met by a
quiet rebuke, Roger Cook went to Jane Dee and asked her,
brusquely, if she knew that the stranger, Edward Talbot, to whom
she had taken such a dislike, was frequently and secretly
visiting her husband?</p>

<p>"He comes up through the cottages and tenements, very often
when it is twilight or very early in the morning before any one
is astir, and the new assistant, Lewis, the doctor's son, lets
him in, or else it is your husband himself who does not disdain
this office."</p>

<p>"Are you certain of what you say?" asked Jane Dee, with an
accent and look of great alarm.</p>

<p>"I have seen it with my own eyes. They try to call up spirits
in the room beside the oratory, where Barnabas Saul used to
practise. It is nothing better than black magic&mdash;necromancy,
and the man is a rogue. What account has he given of himself? Who
knows, what he is or where he has come from?" Roger Cook hurried
along violently in his anger. "Here I have worked and toiled for
fourteen years, to be entrusted with no secrets, and this
stranger must come along and be taken into his confidence within
a few hours!"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he has seen any spirits?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Dee says that he has&mdash;Uriel, the Spirit of Light,
and the Archangel Michael have appeared to him. One of them gave
him a ring with a seal, which Dr. Dee showed me. Either," added
Roger Cook furiously, "he lies and cheats or he is raising
devils."</p>

<p>"This has been concealed from me," said Jane Dee. "Indeed, I
know not what to do. I feared as much when that man first came
here, I had a keen apprehension, even at the very look of
him."</p>

<p>She glanced up at the blunt features of the man who had lived
in this house so much longer than she had and who she both liked
and trusted.</p>

<p>"You know, Roger Cook, how little power I have in this. Am I
likely to be listened to? If this fellow be a rogue or an angel I
shall not be able to dislodge him."</p>

<p>"He is no angel. I think he has an evil look. I would I had
leave to find out something of his history&mdash;I would swear
his name is not Talbot."</p>

<p>"But would my husband with his great learning be so easily
deceived?"</p>

<p>"On the question of these psychic matters he is like a child,"
replied the astronomer's assistant bitterly. "He believes what he
wishes to believe and sees what he wishes to see. And I will not
deny," he added grudgingly, "this wretch has a strange power
about him. I myself have felt it, even when I have passed him in
the passage of an evening, or seen him in an early morning
mounting the little wooden stairs to the garret."</p>

<p>At this Jane Dee felt a great and almost overwhelming
uneasiness. Perhaps the man was a devil or an emissary from Hell
sent to trap the soul of her husband in revenge for his daring
adventures into occult knowledge.</p>

<p>"Oh, Roger Cook, I know not what to do. I am overburdened. You
know our position&mdash;it is very bitter. We are much in debt
and I can get no more credit. If Sir Francis Walsingham and Lady
Warwick had not sent a few nobles yesterday, I do not know how I
should have bought the food we must have nor paid the servants.
We have sold almost all that we can sell."</p>

<p>"This fellow will prove costly," said Roger Cook, absorbed in
the one grievance. "He says that the angels have ordered a table
on which to set the globes. It is to be of sweet wood and have
special seals. That will cost some money. And who knows what
other wild expenditure he will not lead your husband into? Have
you not noticed, Mrs. Dee," he added eagerly, "how, lately, he
has refused to see almost everyone, even his oldest friends, what
long hours he spends apart from you&mdash;how distracted he is
when he is in your company, how little heed he gives to your
complaints and demands? He will become completely absorbed in
these dreadful studies and blast himself, you, and his
family."</p>

<p>Jane Dee rose up with nervous haste.</p>

<p>"I thank you for what you have told me, Roger Cook. I will try
to find out from my husband how far he is besotted with this
fellow." And, being quick tempered and stung by a sense of
injustice and her own grievances, Jane Dee ran at once to the
laboratory, almost stumbling in her haste as she traversed the
dusty passages, and panting and a little dishevelled in her
shabby gown, confronted her husband with her angry grievance.</p>

<p>"Roger Cook tells me that this stranger&mdash;this Edward
Talbot, comes frequently and secretly to the house, that that is
where you are occupied all these hours when I am left alone, that
is where our substance has been going. Why was all this concealed
from me?" added the angry woman, on the verge of tears. "It was
not because you are ashamed of what you do?"</p>

<p>The astronomer answered mildly. He was never affected by
outbursts of feminine passion, and used to the moods and humours
of his Jane, who he regarded with tenderness, reverence and
loyalty.</p>

<p>"I kept my dealings with Mr. Edward Talbot secret so as not to
disturb you, Jane. Because I thought if he were a cheat you need
hear no more of it. But he has proved himself not to be, and I
meant this very day to tell you of his comings here&mdash;to
acquaint you with the progress of our studies."</p>

<p>Jane Dee heard these words with despair. She leant in the
window place and began to weep violently, her husband, the while,
comforting her with much affection and many gentle caresses.</p>

<p>But she was not appeased and soon launched out in a furious
attack not only upon Mr. Edward Talbot, but on her husband
himself, on the folly and wickedness of his experiments, on their
present desperate straits, on their desperate lack of money and
the whole galling situation, which fretted her to the bone. But
her rage was like a sea spending itself on a rock. His patience
was immovable, and at the end of her storm, he informed her that
Mr. Edward Talbot would soon be taking up his residence in the
room above the hall, where Barnabas Saul had lately lodged.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The table commanded by the angels was duly set
up by the end of the month. It was called the Table of Practice
and made of sweet wood and was about a yard high with four
legs.</p>

<p>Talbot said the angels would reveal certain characters which
were to be written with sacred sweet oil, such as was used in
churches, on the sides. Each leg was to be set on a seal of wax,
and a seal of the same pattern was to be set in the centre of the
table (all to be made with clean, purified wax), nine inches
across and an inch and a quarter thick, with a mystical figure
below, which Dr. Dee found, something to his disappointment, to
be no more than an ancient charm which had been in use for some
years during the Middle Ages, which contained, within a cross,
the initials of the Hebrew words, "Thou art great for ever, O
Lord."</p>

<p>But Edward Talbot assured him that this had been especially
commanded by the angels.</p>

<p>On the upper side of the seal was a table of forty-nine
squares, built up with the seven names of God. Each name was to
bring forth seven angels, and each letter of the angels' names
was to bring forth seven daughters, and each daughter was to
bring forth her daughter, and every daughter a son and every son
his son.</p>

<p>Edward Talbot insisted that this seal was not to be looked
upon without great reverence and devotion.</p>

<p>The Table of Practice was set upon a square of red changeable
silk, and a red silk cover with tassels at the four corners to
hang below the table was prepared to be laid over the seal.</p>

<p>Mr. Talbot then placed the crystal globe in its frame in the
centre of the cover, resting on the seal beneath the silk. For
his own use he ordered a green chair which was to be placed
before the Table, while Dee, with the Book of Mysteries, had a
desk moved into a corner of the room where he might sit and note
what the spirits said.</p>

<p>Usually the spirits remained in the globe, but sometimes they
stepped down into a dazzling beam of light and moved about the
room. Sometimes they were not seen at all but only a voice was
heard. The sittings usually began by a gold curtain appearing in
the globe and ended by a black cloth being drawn across the
crystal.</p>

<p>John Dee did not himself see the spirits, but only listened to
the relation of their appearances and actions in words given him
by Edward Talbot.</p>

<p>The sittings had been going on for a month and these elaborate
and costly preparations had been carefully made and still the
spirits had done nothing but promise that when all was complete
they would make astounding revelations.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Dr. Dee decided that Edward Talbot
should reside in the house at Mortlake. The young man had still
not revealed anything about himself, either of his life in the
past or his hopes in the future. He was sullen when the
conversation turned on any topic save that of his spiritual
visitors, but the night that he was to take up his residence in
the house at Mortlake he admitted that his name was not Talbot
but Kelley, and that he would prefer in the future to be known as
Edward Kelley.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was a lovely evening in April when Edward
Kelley arrived to take up openly his residence with Dr. Dee. He
had no baggage nor furniture of any kind with him. He still wore
his grey suit and cloak, his tight, black cap and broad-leaved
hat in which he had first appeared more than six weeks ago in the
panelled parlour on the night of the Aurora Borealis.</p>

<p>Jane Dee had not seen him since but she forced herself to meet
him when he arrived and in a voice full of apprehension and fear
she frankly told him her mind.</p>

<p>"Mr. Talbot, or Kelley, or whatever your name may be, I do
here protest against your entry into my husband's house. I
neither like your person nor your business and you shall get
little comfort or fellowship from me."</p>

<p>The young man looked at her without resentment. His expression
was rather one of wistful longing.</p>

<p>"These are vain words, Mrs. Dee, for the spirits have said I
am to be tied in long companionship with your husband and it is
very needful that we keep together, and it is most likely that we
shall embark on many long and strange adventures. I therefore
pray you, be patient."</p>

<p>He flashed his light look round the room and then added:</p>

<p>"As for worldly means, be not troubled, for a rich patron is
even now on his way to relieve us of all anxiety. The spirits
have told me so."</p>

<p>Jane Dee felt sick at heart and broken in body, as she always
did after her violent outbursts of temper. She knew that she had
lost both dignity and grace and entirely failed to achieve her
purpose.</p>

<p>Her husband had been concerned and most kind, but it was quite
clear that Edward Kelley, who she regarded as a base adventurer
and a low impostor, was firmly established in her household.</p>

<p>She was further disturbed by fears that she had been wrong in
her estimation of this strange young man; her conviction that he
was a cheat began to waver wretchedly and she was tormented by
doubts that she had misjudged him and perhaps offended the
angels, his guardians. But the greatest of all her troubles was
the fact that she herself had felt his peculiar influence.
Although at first he had violently repelled her, she now was
conscious of his magnetic fascination and when in his presence
she could not altogether disbelieve in him. The glance in his
pale eyes, the sound of his low voice with the peculiar accent
that was unknown to her, stirred in her, most disturbingly,
echoes of old dreams that she had believed were dead with
childhood.</p>

<p>So she fell into a sullen acquiescence in the new order of
things while Edward Kelley was closeted daily in the chamber
fitted up for shying next the oratory. But still the angels dealt
in nothing but promises, vague as those the Queen had offered
throughout twenty years to her patient astrologer and
mathematician.</p>

<p>The stranger came and went lightly in the house at Mortlake,
causing little trouble in the establishment. He was enclosed in a
deep reserve and full of self-confidence, and Jane Dee contrived
to run her household on odd monies borrowed from friends or sent
as gifts by compassionate patrons. All the assistants save Roger
Cook had been dismissed. There was no need for their services
since John Dee was now never in the laboratories.</p>

<p>This was a saving of expense, yet it filled Jane Dee with a
certain dismay, for it was a sign that the natural order of their
lives was being interrupted.</p>

<p>Roger Cook was sufficiently skilled in chemistry to continue
work on his own, and he remained enclosed in the laboratories,
coming out seldom, and then only to scowl or pace up and down the
windy riverside gardens in a melancholy mood.</p>

<p>Then he went away suddenly, and was gone a week and more, and
when he came back he seemed in a boisterous good humour and told
Jane Dee that he had some fine news for her and what it was she
should soon know. Then he asked that Dr. Dee and Edward Kelley
might come down to supper that evening to celebrate his
return.</p>

<p>It had recently been their custom to long overpass the meal
hours and remain shut in the attic chamber until all the
household were abed, even for the whole night, as far as Jane Dee
knew, for she often did not see her husband for days
together.</p>

<p>John Dee, however, accepted the suggestion of Roger Cook with
his ancient kindness. He had always been very anxious to effect a
reconciliation between Kelley and Cook; he hoped that the three
of them might work together in the pursuit of enlightenment and
wisdom.</p>

<p>The lovely spring evening was flushed with light warmth and
colour; the windows of the panelled parlour were open on the
sloping garden; the silver-grey river flowed steadily beneath the
long boughs of the willows, which were yellow in the first tender
leaves.</p>

<p>Jane Dee, graceful and quiet in her faded shabby gown, was
soothed by the peace of the scene. She was in a mood to remember
her blessings, the cares of that day, and many other days past,
dropped from her. She thought of her children, in good health,
and serenely asleep upstairs. She felt happy in the protection of
the old house which she loved, and the future, which only a short
time ago had seemed vague and dreadful, she was content, in that
hour of repose, to leave in the hands of God. Then she could not
fail to observe with gratitude how strong and vigorous her
husband seemed, how full of joy and exultation was his
manner.</p>

<p>At Edward Kelley she looked very little, for she tried to
forget his presence. He had changed in nothing since she had
first seen him a few weeks ago; he seemed to have no other
garments but the grey suit, nor ever to take from his head the
black cap which he kept tied under his chin.</p>

<p>She set her pies, her boxes of spice, her flagons of wine, and
her glasses and plates on the boards, for the new maids were by
no means to be trusted, and left alone, would place all awry, and
she wondered at the demeanour of Roger Cook, for he who so long
had been sullen, gloomy and melancholy, seemed now in the highest
of good spirits.</p>

<p>This beautiful evening, thought the tired woman, this sweet
air and the feeling of promise that comes with the spring, surely
lightens the burdens of us all.</p>

<p>And in her heart she thanked God that this was so, and prayed
that some small amount of worldly luck might come their way to
ease them of those earthly anxieties which were their only
care.</p>

<p>During supper Roger Cook asked, in tones that sounded
respectful, about the angels&mdash;how many had appeared, what
they had said, and what the final purpose of their communications
might be?</p>

<p>Dr. Dee answered:</p>

<p>"We have trouble with the spirits, because of the disbelief of
Edward Kelley. There are many of them and they appear daily, but
his want of faith provokes them."</p>

<p>At that Roger Cook looked at Edward Kelley and laughed
boisterously, but Dr. Dee took no heed of this rudeness and went
on with much gravity and reverence to describe the angels who had
appeared in the shewstones and spoken to him through the lips of
Edward Kelley. He declared that he was carefully putting down all
these conversations in his Book of Mysteries in which he had
already detailed the sittings of Barnabas Saul and, looking
earnestly at the man who had been with him for fourteen years and
whom he liked and trusted, and of whose good opinion he was
desirous, Dr. Dee said:</p>

<p>"You must understand the attitude of mind with which I
approach these communications from holy spirits. From my youth
upwards I have prayed for pure wisdom, such as might be to God's
honour and glory&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are sought very easily," interrupted Roger Cook, "by
legitimate means."</p>

<p>"Is it not legitimate," asked Dr. Dee mildly, "to invoke the
aid of God? Do we not read in His books and records how Enoch
enjoyed His favour and conversation? How He was familiar with
Moses, and how that to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and sundry
others, good angels were sent to instruct them? Even to satisfy
their desires, doubts, questionings of Divine secrets? Was there
not a shewstone which the high priests used by the ordering of
God Almighty Himself?"</p>

<p>"These are the mysteries of God," replied Roger Cook sourly,
"and are not for our inquiry."</p>

<p>"You have no faith, Roger Cook. Have you forgotten that God
did not refuse to instruct the prophets, nor to give answers to
ordinary people on common needs as Samuel for Saul, seeking for
his father's asses being gone astray?"</p>

<p>Edward Kelley put in his word.</p>

<p>"Surely our lack of wisdom is to us of more importance than
the value of an ass or two could be to the father of Saul?"</p>

<p>"Juggling and conjuring," sneered Roger Cook, with a dark look
at the last speaker, "and a blasphemous and dangerous use of the
names of things holy and spiritual."</p>

<p>"You think that I am very ready to be cozened by the Devil.
You know me, Roger Cook, you have laboured with me for many
years. Why should you suspect me of the filthy abuse of such
powers as I may have in myself or may find in others? Do you
think that I wittingly would invocate and consult spiritual
creatures of the damned regions, Angels of Darkness, forgers and
phantoms of lies and untruths?"</p>

<p>"I do know you," replied the apprentice sombrely. "I know you
very well, John Dee. I think you are a man who might easily be
cozened, not only by damned spirits and angels of darkness, but
by a common rogue&mdash;" he looked full at Edward Kelley who
ignored the insult and continued to eat and drink daintily.</p>

<p>Jane Dee had forgotten her food and sat with her elbows on the
table and her head propped in her hands and listened eagerly.
First her mind was on the side of Roger Cook, then her heart was
on the side of her husband and Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>She reminded herself perpetually of her own great ignorance
and feminine foolishness, and that she was unfitted for anything
save the simple ordering of affairs and the care of children. It
might be that angels came daily to the old house; surely her
husband was too wise a man to be utterly fooled!</p>

<p>She ventured to look furtively at Edward Kelley, where he sat
so quietly, allowing the other two men all the discourse.</p>

<p>The lovely last light of day, conflicting with that of the
candles which stood on the board, was full on his face, and at
the sight of the beauty of it her heart shook a little and the
colour came into her cheeks. She felt a poignant kinship with
him, the kinship of youth.</p>

<p>He must be, she thought, about my own age.</p>

<p>Roger Cook took a great drink of wine and his eyes sparkled
with triumph. Seldom had he been in a more lively mood.</p>

<p>"Listen, Dr. Dee," he said. "We will have no more talk of
angels or magic or figures in the shewstones, nor of Uriel nor of
Michael, but we will come to plain talk of a common scoundrel,"
and again he looked at Edward Kelley. Then, leaning forward
towards where Dr. Dee sat, he demanded: "What do you know of this
man?"</p>

<p>"And what right have you, Roger Cook," replied the astronomer
with dignity, "to make such a question&mdash;and before Mr.
Kelley's face?"</p>

<p>"Before any man's face," replied Roger Cook, scornfully. "I
have been, as you know, away a week, and I have not misused my
time. I have been looking at the records of this rogue who sits
so boldly at your board."</p>

<p>At that the stranger did look round, but he was unmoved.</p>

<p>"That is impossible, Roger Cook," he remarked. "You do not
know who I am, from where I come, nor what my actions have
been."</p>

<p>"Do I not?" replied the other violently. "I have taken some
pains to find out. Your poor wife was able to tell me
something!"</p>

<p>"Wife!" repeated Jane Dee under her breath, then bit her lips,
and looking down, pulled to pieces a morsel of bread on the table
cover.</p>

<p>"I did not say I had not a wife," replied Kelley coolly.
"There is nothing dishonourable in that matter. She lives quietly
with her parents at Chipping Norton. The spirits," he added,
"bade me take her and bade me leave her." And, fixing his eyes on
Dr. Dee, he added, "It was in my mind, even to-day, to ask that
she might be brought to Mortlake."</p>

<p>"I do well believe," cried Roger Cook bitterly, "that you have
sufficient impudence to make such a demand, and that John Dee has
sufficient simplicity to grant it." And then, suddenly springing
to his feet, he exclaimed, pointing a finger at the young man in
the black cap: "Were you not at Oxford under the name of Talbot,
and did you not leave there suddenly in disgrace? Did you not
stand in the pillory at Leicester for coining base money and did
you not suffer another punishment for forging ancient title
deeds? Have you not been accused more than once of practising
black magic? Ay, I have heard the story of what happened in
Walton-le-Dale churchyard when you dug up a corpse for the
purposes of your vile practices. And took money from a noble
young gentleman for consulting the dead as to his future?"</p>

<p>"Roger Cook," replied Edward Kelley firmly, "these are lies
invented by your malice."</p>

<p>And with a noble calm he continued to eat and to drink.</p>

<p>"His demeanour," said Dr. Dee, "answers your charge, Roger
Cook, which proceeds, as I fear, from a deep and unworthy
jealousy."</p>

<p>At this the apprentice fell into a violent rage, striking the
table with his fist till the boards shook.</p>

<p>"Wait, then," he shouted, "until this felon is arrested in
your presence and brings on you disgrace and ignominy!" And he
added on a harsh sob: "Either he or I must leave this house!"</p>

<p>Dr. Dee rose.</p>

<p>"Then it must be you, Roger Cook. This man, though in an
earthly fashion a stranger to me, has been chosen by the Divine
guides to be my constant companion and helper. We are to stay
together; we are to follow the same adventures and face the same
truths. I say," added the old man on a note of exaltation, "this
Edward Talbot has been appointed to stay by me! Through him I am
to learn the wisdom for which I have sought so long. Through his
lips the angels speak."</p>

<p>"And from mine," said Roger Cook, "come only the words of
common sense. I take my leave, leaving you in the power of this
rogue and cozener."</p>

<p>"Truly," remarked Edward Kelley, sipping his wine "we were
better without the company of one so wilful and so violent."</p>

<p>"I go," sighed Roger Cook, turning towards the door, "and I go
never to return."</p>

<p>At that the generous heart of John Dee was touched. He turned
after the angry man and caught him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"No, Roger Cook, do not leave me like this after fourteen
years of close work together and the sharing of many secrets and
all the understanding and goodwill that has been between us! You
have been like a son to me, Roger Cook."</p>

<p>"Were I indeed your son," replied the other, much moved, "I
should kick from the house that wretch who steals your
confidence."</p>

<p>And with that he pulled his sleeve away from the astronomer's
trembling fingers, opened the great door and went out.</p>

<p>The three of them remained silent and looked from the window.
They saw Roger Cook go down the garden path and out by the
landing step and walk away along the river, where his figure was
soon lost in the twilight behind the budding boughs of the
willows.</p>

<p>John Dee returned to the table; he was shaken and troubled. He
felt that he had lost one who, despite his moods and tempers, had
been a faithful servant, a loving friend. The old house would
seem desolate without Roger Cook.</p>

<p>Jane Dee had also risen and turned to the hearth where a small
fire burned; the evening was yet chilly. She looked over her
shoulder at the young man in grey at the table and said:</p>

<p>"Is none of this charge true, Mr. Kelley? Do you declare to us
that it is all the invention of poor Roger Cook's jealousy?"</p>

<p>The young man looked up and turned full on her his remarkable
pale eyes, which she could never endure without flinching; she
turned her head aside.</p>

<p>"When the time comes I shall reveal myself&mdash;what I am,
what I have been, what I have done," he replied. "Dr. Dee is
satisfied as to my learning and as to my usefulness. Surely that,
for the moment, is sufficient."</p>

<p>Jane Dee shuddered.</p>

<p>"One whose ears have been nailed to the pillory might wear a
black cap tied beneath his chin," she said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>At this, Edward Kelley sprang up in a fury to which the rage
of Roger Cook was as nothing. His features became distorted into
a hideous expression; his whole body trembled as he leaped up and
dashed down the glass that he held.</p>

<p>"If I am to be doubted, if I am to be questioned," he shouted,
"my power will go! Evil spirits will take possession of me! I see
them coming up through the floor even now, the whole black crew
of them! I thought I had found a harbourage, and to! I have
fallen into a trap! Seek the spirits for yourself, John Dee!" he
shouted at the top of his voice. "And you, woman, be prepared to
take the consequences of driving me hence!"</p>

<p>He tore at the neck of his grey coat as if he were choking.
The sudden transformation from his placid, scornful demeanour to
this outrageous fury held both John Dee and his wife immobile.
The woman, indeed, cowered away against the chimney corner, for
it seemed to her as if she really saw an evil spirit let loose in
the old panelled parlour, for Edward Kelley's body seemed to lash
about as if it were in the control of something stronger than
himself, and it was with a movement as if he were swept away by
an invisible power that he flung himself across the room, pulled
open the door and disappeared.</p>

<p>John Dee went to the window. The figure of the young man was
already lost in the gloom.</p>

<p>"We are well rid of a terrible creature," sobbed Jane Dee, but
her husband did not reply. He felt utterly forlorn.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The next day the Queen came riding over the
fields from Richmond Palace and stopped at the wall of Dr. Dee's
house at Mortlake. He saw her from the window and hastened down
to the great door where he stood, bowing his welcome and his
obedience.</p>

<p>The sight of the Queen had caused a spark of hope to revive in
his tired heart. She had not, after all, forgotten him. Perhaps
she had words of comfort for him in his trouble and distress.
Perhaps some of her long promises would bear fruition at last,
and he would have some good news to take in to Jane&mdash;a
benefice, perhaps, or the Provostship of Eton.</p>

<p>This was the first time that he had felt any pleasure since
the violent departure of Edward Kelley. He had locked up the room
with the shewstones next the oratory and closed his Book of
Mysteries. As he had no assistants the laboratories were empty
also; the ancient house seemed desolate.</p>

<p>The black curtain had been drawn between John Dee and the
angels and he felt like one shut out from Paradise.</p>

<p>The Queen, easily riding her white horse, saw him where he
stood in the great door, and made a light movement with her hand
for him to approach. She had only three gentlemen with her and
she was plainly attired in a green habit which blended with the
landscape.</p>

<p>She seemed to him, as indeed she seemed to many, to be
something more than a mere woman. Something more, perhaps, than
mere humanity.</p>

<p>She took her mask off and held it in her hand while she looked
at him kindly. She had visited him twice before&mdash;once on the
day when his young first wife had been carried to church in her
coffin, and once on the day of his mother's funeral. She reminded
him of this, smiling, and said she hoped that this, her third
visit, had not fallen out on the occasion of any melancholy
event.</p>

<p>"Madam," replied the astronomer, "we are all very well in
health, though something troubled in mind and spirit, and my Jane
is a little sunk with household cares."</p>

<p>"That I can understand," replied the Queen. "But should not I
also be a little sunk, John Dee, who have a larger household than
hers to attend to?"</p>

<p>Her manner was very kind. There was a soft grace and an
elegant courtesy in all that she said and did which did not fail
to enchant any to whom she spoke or on whom she looked. John Dee
gazed up at the woman who to him was England, and took a great
comfort from her serenity; her long pale face, so finely shaped,
held a dignity more potent than any beauty, her dark eyes
expressed an unflinching courage and the small head crowned by
the close-curling red-gold hair was held as high and proudly as
if it were always crowned.</p>

<p>She drew off her right, heavily fringed gauntlet, and gave her
beautiful hand to John Dee to kiss. While he did so he glanced at
her companions&mdash;Leicester, Walsingham and Sidney&mdash;all
his good friends.</p>

<p>"What have you read in the skies for us of late?" asked the
Queen.</p>

<p>John Dee did not reply immediately. He was half-tempted to
tell the Queen of his experiments with Edward Kelley. He had
always found her intensely sympathetic in such matters. But the
abrupt and angry departure of the medium gave the whole affair a
taint and he was silent.</p>

<p>The Queen sighed with a certain restless impatience. She put
on her glove and her bright glance wandered away along the river.
John Dee's hopes fell, there was no good news, then, nothing for
him&mdash;as usual!</p>

<p>"There is one just come to England who is inquiring about you,
Dr. Dee," said the Queen. "He is a Polonian Count, of great
wealth and influence, they say, and, as I hear, a favourite of
King Stephen. We entertained him at Greenwich, and he spoke of
your collections and wished to see them."</p>

<p>"My house is always open, madam," replied John Dee, rather
sadly. He had so many visits from curious foreigners, and they
usually resulted in so little benefit to himself.</p>

<p>The Queen smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, if he wants anything of you, John Dee, make him pay. We
hear that he has great wealth. Yet there is some doubt whether he
be not something of an adventurer, who has partly fallen into
disfavour with King Stephen. We are making inquiries."</p>

<p>She turned her horse's head. John Dee, making a last snatch at
a disappearing chance, said desperately:</p>

<p>"My lord Leicester knows that my estate will not allow of my
entertaining of foreign princes." And, as the Queen looked over
her shoulder, he added: "Your Majesty sees that I am, as ever, a
beggar."</p>

<p>"Then we, as ever, must send you a gift," replied the Queen
graciously.</p>

<p>So the Queen had come and gone, and this time not left behind
her as much as a promise. John Dee had to return to the house
with no good news for Jane. He entered the panelled parlour
reluctantly, partly because he feared the violence of his wife's
distress when she should learn that there was nothing to be hoped
for from the Queen, save, perhaps, at the utmost, a few angels to
pay for the entertaining of this foreigner, and partly because he
dreaded that peculiar emptiness with which the old house
oppressed him since the departure of Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>But Jane Dee's generosity was equal to her quick temper, and
in this case overcame it. She saw, by her husband's look and
movement as he entered that he had been disappointed. She went up
to him warmly and flung an arm round his neck.</p>

<p>"Never mind if the Queen gives nothing, sweetheart, we ought
to be happy&mdash;you and I and the children. Yes, we ought to be
happy," she repeated, with an accent of defiance.</p>

<p>"I am happy enough, Jane," he replied, much touched, "and
doubly blessed in you. Your great pains and loyalty have brought
peace and quietness into my household, but I am troubled because
I feel I have not been careful enough of your concerns and those
of the children, and now, I am nearly an old man, and so placed
that it would seem that soon I shall not know where to look for
bread."</p>

<p>At these words a pang of dreadful fear smote Jane Dee's
anxious heart. She thought that the case must be desperate indeed
thus to affect her husband, who was so slow to take alarm at
worldly mishaps. But she clung to him the tighter and tried to
speak what comfort she could.</p>

<p>"We have so many friends," she urged, "surely they will do
something for you? Will Lord Leicester or Sir Francis Walsingham
see all your labours thus go miserably unrewarded?"</p>

<p>"I have never relied on earthly friends," replied the
mathematician, "yet many of them have been very good and gracious
to me."</p>

<p>"I know what you would say," interrupted Jane Dee quickly.
"You are putting your trust in the spirits. You are sorry that
Edward Kelley has gone!" On a frantic accent she added: "Since it
grieves you, I am sorry, too, but I did not send him away; it was
Roger Cook's fault. You <i>know</i> that I did not send him away,
though I did not like him nor believe in him. I put up with
everything rather than grieve you."</p>

<p>"You were very patient, Jane, and it was Roger Cook's fault.
He is a morose, melancholy fellow, and has long been seeking an
excuse to break with me, yet I am sorry he has gone."</p>

<p>"I, too, miss him very greatly," said Jane Dee.</p>

<p>She withdrew herself from her husband's arms; the glow of her
generous impulse, her kind sympathy towards her husband was over.
The future looked grey, and worries began to encroach upon her
peace of mind&mdash;debts and lack of money, an uncertain future,
all the assistants, too, gone now and one maid dismissed
yesterday because there was not money to keep two.</p>

<p>The house was too large for their cramped means, the children,
every month, were costing more, and, almost the worst of all
these pains and discomforts, was the queer ache she felt at the
void left by the departure of Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>"There is this Polonian Count&mdash;one Adelbert Laski, who
would see my collections and library, and be entertained, Jane. I
think Lord Leicester will send us some money, and we must do what
we can."</p>

<p>"Will this prince help us at all?"</p>

<p>"He might buy some of my books if I am prepared to part with
them."</p>

<p>"You must come to parting with your books, it seems to me,"
sighed Jane, "for, indeed, we shall soon have nothing else left
to sell."</p>

<p>And she bit her lip in vexation at herself, for she had nearly
been reminding him that she had already sacrificed all her
buckles, chains and rings, and she knew that the mention of this
was very grievous to her husband.</p>

<p>To keep her mind off the subject she asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"Did you think to make any inquiries as to whether Roger
Cook's accusations about Edward Kelley were true?"</p>

<p>The mathematician shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>"What would be the use of that, Jane. I have no talent for
such a search, no clue as to where the man came from, and as to
who he is. Besides, what does it matter?" he added with simple
dignity. "If he were sent from the angels, then I must accept
whatever instrument they have chosen. And if he be but a common
thief, it is not worth our pains to make inquiries after
him."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">John Dee went heavily to his empty laboratory.
He had no heart for experiments. There were several horoscopes to
be cast, but he was in no mood for elaborate drawings, charts and
designs, the reading and interpretation of the conjunction of the
stars.</p>

<p>He was, instead, irresistibly attracted to the little upper
chamber where stood the crystal globe on the beautiful table of
sweet wood&mdash;the little garret room, which seemed to him
still haunted by the presence of the angels, and he mounted the
wooden stairway to the secret place where he and Edward Kelley
had so often sat, Kelley kneeling before the crystal and he at
his desk in the corner, writing down the angelic conversation in
the Book of Mysteries.</p>

<p>He was puzzled to find this door open, because he thought he
had left it locked. He pushed it wide with a certain eagerness,
and at once saw Edward Kelley in his grey suit and black cap,
kneeling before the crystal, his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward Kelley!" he exclaimed joyfully. It seemed to him
the young man had been brought back by a miracle. John Dee had
forgotten that his assistant had taken the keys of the house away
with him and might easily have entered through the tenements and
cottages where the workpeople used to live.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley said, without looking up:</p>

<p>"Evil spirits have left me and the good angels have brought me
back." And then, as Dr. Dee advanced and laid a hand on his
shoulder, he asked in a trembling voice: "Am I accepted? Will you
have patience with me after my late wicked behaviour?"</p>

<p>"Had I not patience," replied the mathematician with sincere
humility, "I had not been fit to learn spiritual mysteries."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been sent to you to try this same patience,"
said Kelley, and, in contrast to the penitence of his last words,
there was a sly humour in his tone as he glanced at Dr. Dee. He
looked ill. There was no longer any beauty in his changeable
face, which was drawn and yellow, as if from an ague, and, as he
rose, John Dee observed that he held in his hand a crystal, the
size of an egg and very bright and clear.</p>

<p>"This," he added, "was given to me by Michael, who appeared
with his fiery sword and placed it in my hand and said: 'Go
forward, take it up, and let no mortal hand touch it but thine
own.' He told me, too, that you and I, John Dee, must be united
in this holy work, as if we were one man. You are to be master
and I am to be minister." And he placed the small crystal in
front of the larger globe on the table of sweet wood with the
interchangeable red silk coverlet.</p>

<p>"You have seen the spirits again, then, already? asked the
mathematician, and his whole being glowed in a flame of
thankfulness and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen them."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley went again to his knees, put his hand before his
eyes and said:</p>

<p>"These are the words the spirits spoke to me early this
morning, when I came here secretly and knelt before the
shewstone. Do you take them down."</p>

<p>Then as John Dee went to his desk in the corner and unclasped
the large Book of Mysteries and began to write, Edward Kelley
recited these words in a high, clear and unnatural voice, and, as
he wrote them down, the mathematician forgot his troubles, the
disappointment caused by the Queen's visit, and even all his
doubts concerning the man who knelt before the shewstone.</p>

<p>"Your voices are but the shadows of the voices that understand
all things. The things you look on because you see them not,
indeed you also name amiss. We are fully understanding; we open
the eyes through the sun at morning and the sun at night.
Distance is nothing with us, unless it be the distance which
separates the wicked from His mercy. Secrets there are none but
what are buried in the shadows of man's soul. Iniquity shall not
range where the fire of His piercing judgment lights."</p>

<p>After delivering this message the medium seemed much
exhausted; he fell forward on his knees. John Dee hastened to
raise him up and asked him if he had anything more to say
concerning the spirits, and, still as if he were in a trance,
Kelley muttered that a pretty girl angel of seven or nine years
had appeared.</p>

<p>Her name was Madimi. She was attired in a gown of changeable
green and red with a train, her hair was rolled up before and
hanging down very long behind.</p>

<p>"Do you not see her?" cried Kelley, gazing before him with his
pale eyes. "She is playing by herself, in and out behind the
books&mdash;they seem to give way, one pile after another while
she passes between them."</p>

<p>"What does she say?" demanded the mathematician. He turned his
eager tired gaze on the rows of books that lined the shelves in
the garret, and he thought that he could see them fall one on the
other and the leaves flutter as the light spirit moved.</p>

<p>"She says," muttered the skryer, who seemed half-unconscious,
"that we are not to think of ourselves, that we are to stay
together and obey the angels in all things. She says that my
trouble is caused by the evil angel, Belmagel, the firebrand who
has followed my soul from the beginning. She says I am a young
man but an old sinner. Ah! The crystal is shooting fire into my
eyes!" he gave a scream of pain, "and I can see no more!"</p>

<p>But after a little while, leaning forward and sobbing, with
his hands to his eyes, Edward Kelley declared that he could see
the spirits again, not now in the crystal, but moving about the
room on beams of light, and that they gave messages of hope.
There was to be a journey and quests, and much treasure to be
found. A rich noble patron was coming, and it was not the
Queen.</p>

<p>After saying so much, Kelley fell down in an exhausted state.
John Dee brought a cushion for his head, disposed him comfortably
and left him.</p>

<p>That evening John Dee was summoned to Greenwich where, in the
Earl of Leicester's apartment, he was presented to Graf Adelbert
Laski, who received him very favourably, and told him, when they
were alone together, that he wished to see him, not so much in
order that he might enjoy his collections, famous as these were,
but that they might study magic together, in which he, the
Polonian prince, had already made some progress. He arranged to
come to Mortlake in two days' time.</p>

<p>When Dr. Dee returned and told this exciting news to Kelley,
the medium showed no interest.</p>

<p>He had forgotten, he declared, what the supposed angels had
said, and he was no longer inclined to believe them. He thought
that they were evil spirits, and that it would be better to give
up gazing into the globe, and he took himself off for a day's
angling in the Thames.</p>

<p>Jane Dee saw him go with both terror and relief. She was glad
to be rid of him, and yet she felt desperate at the thought that
he might not return. She tried to still her tumultuous heart by
making active preparations for the reception of Graf Laski,
towards which the Earl of Leicester had sent twenty angels.
Without this money they could not have entertained the foreigner,
and even with it there was a pinch to prepare the state that such
a great personage would demand.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The Lord Adelbert Laski came, by water rowed
down the Thames from Oxford, where he had been honourably used
and entertained. He was in the Queen's barge, covered by the
Queen's cloth and rowed by the Queen's men. The Regal trumpeters
attended him.</p>

<p>"See," said Edward Kelley, when all this pomp and parade drew
up with a flourish of trumpets at the water stairs of the ancient
house at Mortlake, "is not this the wealthy patron who the
spirits have promised?"</p>

<p>"I thought," said Jane Dee, "the spirits no longer were
visible, because of your idleness."</p>

<p>She spoke in tones that were half defiant, half frightened,
and Edward Kelley answered her with a smile, that the spirits had
reappeared, St. Michael with his head bound in a mourning scarf,
because of the medium's misdeeds, and had assured him that all
were to hope for the best of fortune, which might be found
through the means of this Adelbert Laski.</p>

<p>The Polonian prince proved to be a very imposing personage, of
tall stature and gracious presence. As he had come from Oxford
with almost royal honours, the Queen's mathematician received him
with the deepest respect, but Jane Dec found time for a word with
Mr. Camfield, an Englishman in his suite, and learnt from him
that it was by no means certain whether Laski was a great prince
or a mere adventurer.</p>

<p>The Queen had sent to Poland for advices as to whether he
still enjoyed his great estates or whether he had fallen into
disgrace with King Stephen Bathory. In brief, information was
sought as to whether this nobleman, who took such state on
himself, was in truth in favour with the King of Poland, or had
merely fled to England, as to an asylum.</p>

<p>Jane Dee cherished this knowledge in her heart while she
waited at her anxiously plenished board seeing to the comfort of
the illustrious guest, using all her arts and graces to gloss
over deficiencies in the service, the plate and in the food.</p>

<p>She did not like Adelbert Laski, who fell at once into a great
familiarity with her husband. He was plainly a learned man and
obviously a handsome one, but there was, the apprehensive woman
thought, something sinister in his long, smooth face and slanting
eyes, his full lips, curiously puckered at the corners, and
rounded chin.</p>

<p>He soon turned the talk to magic and conducted a learned
conversation in which Edward Kelley joined, eagerly, and half the
dishes that Jane Dee had so painfully prepared were left
untouched, for the three of them went up early to the chamber
beside the oratory where the angels appeared.</p>

<p>Jane Dee went out into the garden, where the children, in
charge of Ellen Cole, were playing about the water steps. The
coming of this sumptuous foreigner much troubled her, and yet
excited her, too. It had certainly fallen very pat on the angels'
prediction of a rich patron, and her wishes coloured her hopes.
She allowed her fancies to run into a possible future where this
great nobleman would pay her husband a fixed and certain sum, say
two hundred pounds a year, so that he could continue his studies,
and they might all be comfortable. But with these tremulous hopes
still ran a doubt as to Edward Kelley and the truth of his
visions, for Jane Dee, with the direct simplicity of one whose
native intelligence is not confused by learning, thought
shrewdly:</p>

<p>"How is it that my husband never sees the angels, and only
Edward Kelley, and all the messages come through his lips? Does
not this make it very possible for him to cozen and cheat?"</p>

<p>And she thought that she would like to go to the little room
where the shewstones were set out and herself see if the spirits
would commune with her.</p>

<p>"Surely if they are of God they would, for He must know my
anxious heart and my pure motives."</p>

<p>It was six of the clock before the Polonian prince left the
old house at Mortlake, the marigolds in the garden were beginning
to close, and Jane Dee had sent Ellen Cole upstairs with the
children. The oarsmen and the Queen's servants, wearing the Tudor
livery, were making the great State barge ready, but still her
husband and Adelbert Laski lingered on the steps, talking
together eagerly.</p>

<p>She had no mind to interrupt them; they certainly had
forgotten her, a mere women suitable for nothing but to look
after her house and the children. Curiosity stirred her as to
Edward Kelley; she wondered if the angels had appeared at the
sitting with Laski; if he had convinced the Polonian prince of
his sincerity and truth?</p>

<p>She entered the low, ancient house which was flushed by the
first glimmer of the setting sun which brightened all the west.
The windows were open and a gentle breeze fluttered the shabby
curtains and stirred the old, threadbare, dark hangings on the
wall. The house was silent, the servants were all in their own
quarters eating and clearing away the remains of the feast which
had been of such unusual magnificence.</p>

<p>Jane Dee turned down the long passage which led to the
laboratories. As she entered the first one she thought of Roger
Cook and felt a pang of regret, almost of remorse, as if she had
been responsible for the violent departure of this faithful
servant and friend.</p>

<p>She looked about for a while with a sense of repulsion at the
curious retorts and vessels, maps, charts and instruments, and at
the warm sunlight falling on the cold furnaces, which had not
been lit since Roger Cook and John Lewis had left.</p>

<p>Realising that she had come for Edward Kelley and that he was
not there, she said to herself:</p>

<p>"What have I to do with him?"</p>

<p>But curiosity and some unconfessed emotion stronger than
curiosity urged her on. She picked up her long skirts and lightly
mounted the open wooden stairway which led to the garret where
she knew the experiments took place.</p>

<p>There was no answer to her rapping on the door. She tried-the
lock, it was open. She entered, and there was Edward Kelley
seated in the window place with his head on his breast and a look
on his face as if the life had left him. She went up to him
quickly, not conscious of her own actions; she saw through the
window the small figures of her husband and the Polonian prince
still talking on the river steps and they seemed like something
out of another world, or a dream.</p>

<p>"Edward Kelley," she said, "are you ill?"</p>

<p>At that he looked up at her; the lids were drooping over his
wide, pale eyes. She took his hands and found them cold.</p>

<p>"Your blood is chilled," she said, "come downstairs, there is
still a fire and I will put warm cloths to your feet and give you
something hot to drink."</p>

<p>But he shook his head. She was awed by his look and his
silence, and went on her knees beside him in the window place and
asked in a hushed voice:</p>

<p>"Did the spirits appear?"</p>

<p>"You think I am an impostor, Jane Dee. You think I am very
base and unworthy. No doubt you believe the slanders of Roger
Cook, but I say I am a high creature and in touch with the
angels. Yes, they came, and the Polander was convinced."</p>

<p>The woman felt a thrill of relief, of pleasure and she knew,
for she was quick and shrewd in judging herself, that this was
not so much because of the possible good fortune which might come
to them all from securing the patronage of Adelbert Laski, but
because it proved that Edward Kelley was not a rogue.</p>

<p>"If I could see the angels!" she said wistfully.</p>

<p>"You do not believe in me even now!"</p>

<p>He sprang up and stood over her and smiled as if he were
pleased to see her kneeling there, almost as if she crouched at
his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, I tell you that they are there. Has not your husband,"
and he pointed to the desk in the corner, "written of them in his
book&mdash;all our conversations?"</p>

<p>"Do you see them only in the crystal?" she asked, still
regarding him fearfully.</p>

<p>"No! Sometimes they come on beams and walk about the
room."</p>

<p>"And does my husband never see them?"</p>

<p>"He hears their voices, Mrs. Dee. Often they speak to him
directly."</p>

<p>"If only they could speak to me, Edward Kelley!"</p>

<p>"You are a foolish woman," he replied scornfully, and she was
silent, knowing that the accusation was just. He added, as if he
were on the verge of one of his mounting tempers: "I will not be
interfered with nor spied upon. Why did you creep up here just
now? What the angels say we must do. My fate is bound up with
that of your husband's, and you cannot separate us."</p>

<p>"If these matters be of God, I do not wish to; but though I am
only a woman and not in any way learned, I cannot but remember
that my husband has been cozened before."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley's mood suddenly changed. He was, for this, the
strangest creature that she had ever met&mdash;one moment
volatile, and the next melancholy&mdash;sullen and gay within a
half minute.</p>

<p>He laughed now agreeably and said:</p>

<p>"Maybe you have the gift of seeing. Come and look in the
crystal&mdash;one of my angels, Madimi, is a woman. Perhaps you
can see her."</p>

<p>Jane Dee rose from her knees, and, forcing her courage,
approached the crystal to which Edward Kelley pointed. Pale to
the cold lips she gazed within, gazed long, and with a sincere
and passionate prayer in her heart. But she could see nothing,
only different degrees of gleaming light in the crystalline
depths of the globe.</p>

<p>Out of these she could make no shapes whatever, nor did any
voice sound in her ear.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley caught her hand and drew her impatiently to the
ball of opsidian, which stood on another frame in the further
corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Gaze into that, Jane Dee, and see if sight is given you."</p>

<p>The nervous woman, so desperate in her desire to have some
confirmation of this man's spiritual errand, saw nothing in the
black globe but a smooth, polished surface on which the window
cast a star.</p>

<p>"I see nothing," she panted, turning and facing him. "Nobody
sees anything but you. You have some power&mdash;that is
certain&mdash;and I am doubtful where this power comes from."</p>

<p>"Do I disturb you, Jane Dee?" he asked in a tone strangely
joyful. He took both her hands in his cold palms.</p>

<p>"Only because you disturb my household," she answered
bravely.</p>

<p>He seized upon the confession in this half-admission.</p>

<p>"In what other way should I disturb you, Jane Dee?" And he
answered himself. "In the way that a man disturbs a woman!" He
flung away her hands. "You are married to one much too old for
you."</p>

<p>"Will you leave us!" she cried, her tone touched by panic.
"Will you leave us! We were happy until you came."</p>

<p>He smiled, lips, nostrils, eyes, raised in merriment.</p>

<p>"I shall go at my own good time, Jane Dee, and not
before."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">That evening John Dee was full of the visit of
the Polonian prince, from which he predicted great good fortune.
Laski, it appeared, had interested the spirits at once; they had
appeared in the crystal and given him much advice, which he had
taken eagerly. Michael had even deigned to give the foreigner
hints on how he was regarded at the English Court, warning him of
Burleigh and Walsingham, and hinting to him of the Queen's
dubious attitude and the inquiries that were being made about him
in his native country.</p>

<p>Laski had been considerably impressed and had promised to come
again in a day or two to consult again with these wonderful
angels who spoke by the lips of Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>"What has that to do with us?" demanded Jane Dee nervously and
impatiently.</p>

<p>Her husband, who was greatly excited by the events of the
afternoon, replied:</p>

<p>"It seems that all our fortunes are bound up together, and
some adventure or quest is near at hand in which we shall be
concerned with this Polonian prince." He smiled tenderly and
added: "Be not so anxious, my faithful Jane, for he is a rich
man&mdash;the Palatine of Siradia&mdash;and has promised me that
I shall not be concerned as to worldly anxieties while I work for
him. This is an earnest of his promises." And the mathematician,
with the simple air of one who gives a bauble to a child, put a
red silk knitted purse full of gold angels into his wife's
lap.</p>

<p>The sight of the money threw Edward Kelley into one of his
wild moods. He at once demanded three pieces to buy boots, hose
and to hire a horse; late as it was, he wished, he said, to go to
London, or at least to Brentford. He had friends who he wished to
meet and he might be out all night.</p>

<p>The mathematician found these requests unreasonable, and said
so with some show of authority.</p>

<p>"Remember, Edward Kelley, that I still but try you. I am by no
means certain of your honesty and zeal. The other day you would
be for hours fishing, now you would go merrymaking or carousing
with friends, and at this time, too, when we are straitened in
means and anxiously awaiting events."</p>

<p>But Jane Dee said scornfully:</p>

<p>"Let him take his share of the money. That is what he means, I
think. He has earned it."</p>

<p>She opened the red purse and put half of the contents, five
angels, on the table. Kelley snatched them up, saying
sullenly:</p>

<p>"I do not think to continue in this traffic. There is Mr.
Harry Lee of Islington, who makes like experiments with yours,
John Dee, and he has offered me forty pounds a year to see the
spirits with him. What are these spirits that come to us here?
What do they tell us that we do not know already? What authority
have we for supposing this Laski to be a great man in his
country? Those ten angels may be all we shall ever see of his
money. As for me, I think to take ship at Newcastle and go to the
Baltic Seas&mdash;yes, and that within eight days."</p>

<p>This burst of rebellion and rude ill-humour on the part of his
skryer, just when matters seemed at such a favourable
conjuncture, utterly confounded John Dee.</p>

<p>"If it is the forty pounds that moves you," he said, "I and
the Polonian prince between us could surely promise you
fifty."</p>

<p>"If he be worth as much," put in Jane Dee, with an angry look.
She took pleasure in wounding Edward Kelley and, through him,
wounding herself.</p>

<p>The young man laughed in their faces.</p>

<p>"I waste my time here. How many hours have I given to this
study? Had I applied them to an exact science I might by now have
been a learned man."</p>

<p>He flung out of the house.</p>

<p>"Now he has the money," said Jane Dee sharply, "he will not
return and we are well rid of a rogue."</p>

<p>But her husband, who had the truly philosophic mind, refused
to be thus downcast. He bade one of his menservants, Benjamin,
follow Edward Kelley and bring reports of his actions.</p>

<p>Before dark the man had returned to say that Mr. Kelley had
gone to a tavern at Brentford and there met some low fellows,
seemingly by appointment. They were gambling and carousing in the
inn parlour, and Mr. Kelley looked likely to stay all night and
to become very drunk; it was market day and there was plenty of
money in the town.'</p>

<p>John Dee received this bad news in silence. But his wife
exclaimed passionately:</p>

<p>"I think we have got a very devil among us."</p>

<p>Jane Dee lay awake that night listening, against her will, for
the return of Edward Kelley. She envied her husband his peaceful
slumbers. More than once she rose out of her bed and lit a taper
and went to the latticed window and looked out on to the garden,
which was full of roses and marigolds, and the full-leaved
willows and the river beyond, all sweet and rich and still
beneath a high, mounting moon.</p>

<p>With the first shiver of the dawn she heard the great door
open and close gently. Her heart bounding, sent the colour into
her cheeks. She rebuked herself bitterly: "For what is this, but
a misfortune come back?"</p>

<p>She put on her dress, slowly, carefully, with cold fingers.
She snuffed her taper and went downstairs, walking gently for
fear of a creaking board.</p>

<p>He was there&mdash;asleep on the old settle by the dead fire.
A pile of cushions was pulled under his head. The slack lines of
his body were graceful in his drunken sleep. His breath came in
ugly snores and his face was slightly distorted.</p>

<p>The pale woman shaded her light with a shivering hand and
looked at him long and intently, as if she would surprise his
secrets from him.</p>

<p>He wore the grey suit in which he had first come to Mortlake.
It was stained and worn and the hose rolled down and one of the
latchets of his shoes broken. His coat and shirt were open at the
neck and the strings of the black bonnet that he always wore were
unfastened.</p>

<p>Jane Dee's labouring breath nearly blew out her taper. She
stood quiet, struggling for control, and through her disturbed
mind darted all this strange, wild creature's words to her, the
sudden manner of his coming and Roger Cook's accusations, given
in this very room, with flushed face and pounding fists.</p>

<p>The dawn, very pale and slow, was creeping through the low
window. Some dark roses tapped against the panes; the river was a
distant light, paler than silver.</p>

<p>Jane Dee felt cut off from both day and night in some world of
her own.</p>

<p>She set the taper on the old tapestry chair where she had so
often sat with her children, and with the lightness of a woman
used to dealing with sleeping infants she bent over the drunken
man and further loosened the strings of his black cap, and turned
back the flaps of it. Damp bright hair fell out in rings of
chestnut gold.</p>

<p>Jane Dee flushed. The falling of those tight-pressed locks
about his face altered his aspect, making him at once more
youthful and more terrible. Her excited fancy depicted him, as he
lay there, as a fallen angel, thrown before a celestial sphere.
Gently, as if she dealt with a sleeping child, she moved the
locks of hair aside. He lay on his back, with his chin upwards,
so that she could see when she had put aside his hair that both
his ears were mangled, the lobes torn away and shrivelled.</p>

<p>What had Roger Cook said: "Nailed to the pillory for forgery,
for coining, for blasphemous rites with the dead!"</p>

<p>She pushed back the sweat-damped curls, drew down the black
cap, blew out her taper, and in the dark stumbled up to her
bed-chamber.</p>

<p>John Dee was awakened by the passionate weeping of his wife.
He was distressed but not alarmed for he was used to these moods
of hers, in which she would weep with a force that seemed to
dissolve her very soul.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort her, but she remained sunk in the pillows,
refusing his caresses. So consistent was her grief that he
believed at length that she had something dreadful to tell him,
yet, when she had a little commanded herself, all she had to say
was:</p>

<p>"It is nothing. I had a fearful dream."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The next day found Edward Kelley in a very
reasonable, penitent mood. He expressed himself most dutifully to
John Dee, declaring his sorrow for the outburst of the night
before. He declared that the crew of evil spirits had again
tempted him to defy his employer and the good angels and to spend
the night in debaucheries at Brentford on Graf Laski's fee. He
was now miserably repentant and declared that these attacks,
under the influence of Michael and Madimi, would become less and
less frequent, and he implored the mathematician, in view of the
importance of the affair before them, to forgive his
shortcomings.</p>

<p>The sittings were resumed at once and Michael appeared and
administered to the medium a sharply-pointed reproof, telling him
that he had better fish after truth than spend so much time
angling in the Thames and that debaucheries like those of the
night before at Brentford were like to ruin all.</p>

<p>But Edward Kelley, making a second, and this time almost
hysterical profession of amendment, the angels became reconciled,
gave a number of messages for Laski, and hinted again at the
great importance of the adventure or quest which was soon to be
undertaken.</p>

<p>Upon this, Dr. Dee asked Madimi, the gentle child angel, if
the Polish prince were their friend, if he had any money, and if
he were like to do much for them.</p>

<p>The answer was in the nature of a rebuke.</p>

<p>"You have no faith. He is greatly your friend, and intends to
do much for you. He is prepared to do you good, and you must be
prepared to do him service. Those who are not faithful shall die
a most miserable death and shall drink of sleep everlasting."</p>

<p>With this the angel disappeared, like a strong spark of fire,
Kelley said, as he shook himself with a sigh out of his trance.
The mathematician thought this was a favourable moment to ask him
to bring the book and the powders which he had spoken of on his
first coming to Mortlake, but which he had not yet produced.</p>

<p>Still maintaining his meek mood the medium replied that he
would fetch them that very evening from where he had them safely
hidden.</p>

<p>"I am longing to see," said John Dee, with a throb in his
heart and in his voice, "if I may by any means decipher them and
if any of my experiments will produce any results with the
powders."</p>

<p>He held out his hand with a touching gesture of friendship,
and again made promise of the offer of fifty pounds a year.</p>

<p>"If you have the means," said Kelly rudely.</p>

<p>John Dee, with the mildness that he now opposed to all the
moods of this strange creature, replied simply that the angels
had said that Laski was their friend and that he had money.</p>

<p>Kelley then changed the subject and complained moodily of the
language the spirits used. They were, he declared, much too
learned for him, speaking Greek and Arabic, of which he knew
nothing&mdash;not even the alphabet.</p>

<p>"Unless they speak some language which I understand I shall
express no more of this gibberish," he said impatiently.</p>

<p>John Dee looked sadly at his medium.</p>

<p>"I think you strive to find some excuse to be gone from
me."</p>

<p>He took down a large Geneva Bible which he always kept besides
the Book of Mysteries in which he inscribed the angelic
conversations.</p>

<p>"Come hither, Edward Kelley, place your hands on this and
swear to be faithful to me, or else at once leave my service, for
of these constant fits and caprices and uncertainties, I will
have no more. If you must, leave me; if you will stay, swear
fidelity to me and let me hear no more talk of your being gone to
Islington, or taking ship at Newcastle."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley came over at once to the Bible on which he laid
his long and singularly beautiful right hand.</p>

<p>"Trust and fidelity," he cried wildly, "must go in both
directions! You shall swear to me, John Dee, to be my faithful
friend!"</p>

<p>"I will take the same oath. I should never ask what I would
not give," replied the mathematician gravely. "Have I not trusted
you, Edward Kelley, even sometimes against all reason, and, as it
seemed, common sense and prudence? Did I listen to Roger Cook's
slanders?"</p>

<p>At this Edward Kelley replied curiously:</p>

<p>"I think your wife did."</p>

<p>John Dee did not reply to this. He clasped the other's hand as
it lay on the Bible and so the two plighted their faith, one to
another, to preserve brotherly and friendly fidelity during their
lives. And after the oath the mathematician, much moved, besought
God to turn this covenant to His honour, glory and service.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Graf Laski soon returned to Mortlake, this time
spending the night and straining to the utmost the resources of
the twenty angels which the Queen had sent to John Dee for the
distinguished foreigner's entertainment.</p>

<p>John Dee could not obtain from his friends at Court, such as
Raleigh, Leicester, or Sidney, any sure news as to this Adelbert
Laski, who was, undoubtedly, a great nobleman, almost a prince,
in his own country, but who might be out of favour with the King,
Stephan Bathory, and bankrupt. But the mathematician did not
greatly trouble himself about these intelligences, for he relied
on what the angels told him of his new and magnificent patron,
and which was more favourable.</p>

<p>Kelley had brought the book. The powder he still retained,
pretending that he had misplaced it. John Dee believed this to be
a lie, but with none the less eagerness, applied himself to an
attempt to decipher the manuscript.</p>

<p>He had by now in a strange way used himself to the character
of the man who was so closely and so curiously allied to him. He
was prepared to accept Edward Kelley's moods and tempers, furies
and tempests, for the sake of his extraordinary powers, and to
believe the strange creature's tales about the crew of devils,
headed by the evil angel, Belmagel, who plagued and tormented
him. Great was the mathematician's faith and very pure his
simplicity of mind.</p>

<p>He found that he could not decipher the manuscript, which was
not in any language, but consisted of ciphers, designs and
devices and figures, very neatly drawn and exquisitely and
accurately disposed on pages of thick parchment. Kelley could be
no help for his mathematical knowledge was as slight as was his
learning in ancient languages. His tale of how he had found the
manuscript in Glastonbury was also confused.</p>

<p>Adelbert Laski, Palatine of Siradia, now in the confidence of
the two, could make nothing of the manuscript either, nor would
the spirits help.</p>

<p>At this juncture, it being the end of July, the Queen, who was
then at Greenwich, proceeded with her Court, with music and
singing and flags and trumpeters, from Greenwich to Sion House,
passing Dee's door and stopping there to speak to him. But though
she so royally offered this mark of favour she gave nothing else
besides gracious words, not even promises, and more than ever did
the mathematician's mind turn away from his hopes of the English
Court towards the strange and peculiar adventure that seemed
offered him.</p>

<p>It was Jane Dee who brought his mind from these curious issues
to a practical affair.</p>

<p>"This man Kelley has a wife. What has he done with her? Why
does she not ever come here? Did he not say he thought of asking
for a lodging for her with us? I greatly pity her, poor
soul."</p>

<p>John Dee replied that Kelley had told him that he had parted
from his wife, whose people did not favour him. He himself could
not abide her, so she was still residing at Chipping Norton.</p>

<p>The skryer, who walked very softly and often came in unawares
upon others, entered at this point of the conversation and
declared, with a peculiar grimace, that if Mrs. Dee wanted his
wife, she could have her. And the next evening, at sunset, with
one hair trunk carried by a hired porter, Joan Kelley arrived at
Mortlake.</p>

<p>She was about nineteen years of age, and very pale and silent.
Jane Dee was eagerly kind to her and passionately cross-examined
her as to what she knew of her husband and how she had come to
make such an ill match, and if there were any great affection
between them and if it were really her preference to come to
Mortlake, or had she wished to stay with her parents?</p>

<p>Joan Kelley had very little to say for herself; she seemed at
once apprehensive and resigned. She would not relate anything of
how she had met her husband, nor of his wooing and winning of her
modest person.</p>

<p>"I'll swear it was all strange enough," said Jane Dee, with a
certain bitter scorn that caused the girl to wince away.</p>

<p>"Yes, and strange my coming here, Mrs. Dee. I should have a
house of my own, or at least a room, but here I am neither guest
nor servant." And with dignity the poor creature added: "I do not
even know if I am welcome to my husband. The last time he saw me
he said that he disliked me."</p>

<p>"You must be sorry," replied Jane Dee compassionately, "that
ever he came to be a concern of yours. Surely he is a miserable
husband for any woman. And yet, perhaps," she added swiftly,
"you, loved him?"</p>

<p>The girl did not reply to this. She said:</p>

<p>"I would do my duty as a wife, but I would not stay here to
put any one at odds."</p>

<p>Jane Dee contended with herself a little space in silence, and
then she said frankly:</p>

<p>"It is true that my household has lately been much disturbed,
but I must consider, above all, my husband's interests. He has
engaged Mr. Kelley to work for him at fifty pounds a year, and it
is not fitting that you should be separated from your husband.
Stay here, then, and share his room and take your place at our
board. If idleness oppress you, you may help Ellen Cole with the
children, or myself sometimes with the servants."</p>

<p>So Joan Kelley became part of the household at Mortlake. She
was of a humble submissive disposition, reserved and neither gay
nor sad. Her husband gave her but a harsh greeting. He insisted
that she should be lodged far from him, in the closet next to
Ellen Cole's chamber, so that her position, save for the kindness
of Jane Dee, would have been little better than that of a
servant.</p>

<p>The while Graf Adelbert Laski came to and from Greenwich and
sat with John Dee and his slayer in the little room next to the
oratory and communed thus daily with the angels, the two women
went about their quiet duties, mended and baked, darned and
sewed, helped Ellen Cole with the children, and directed all the
little tedious duties of the day.</p>

<p>They did not, for all their courtesy towards one another,
learn to know each other in the least, though Jane Dee often
thought as she glanced up curiously at the pale, passive face of
Joan Kelley: "There is one secret between us&mdash;that of the
mangled ears." And on this would always follow the wild and
bitter question that she was ashamed to answer: "Why do I not
reveal him as an impostor?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The Polonian prince had taken a deep fancy to
Edward Kelley. He declared frankly to the mathematician that he
delighted in the company of the turbulent young man, and this
apart from his powers as a medium with the spirits. This prince
had been so far as lavish with his money as with his promises.
Several purses of angels had found their way from John Dee's
indifferent fingers to his wife's business-like clasp.</p>

<p>The household ran smoothly under the favours of this new
patron. There was a perceptible easing of care and anxiety. It
was not yet clear quite on what errand Adelbert Laski had come to
England, nor yet quite what was his position in his own country,
to which he spoke of soon returning, and even suggested taking
Edward Kelley with him.</p>

<p>He had frankly admitted that he was not so much interested in
intercourse with spirits as in the discovery of the Philosopher's
Stone and the Elixir of Life. He had, himself, some pretensions
to the Polish crown, which had lately been lost by the Austrian
Emperor, whose side he had taken, to Stephan Bathory, and, as
John Dee already well knew, money would be the great need in such
an enterprise.</p>

<p>But the mathematician had never made any serious search for
the discovery of the Philosopher's Stone. Hermetic Wisdom was his
goal, and that divine enlightenment besides which the purest of
earthly metals would be but dross.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">John Dee was now completely under the influence
of Kelley and did not question in the least the reality of the
visions which he daily carefully entered in the Book of
Mysteries, and, since he had taken the oath on the Geneva Bible
to be faithful to his master, Kelley had shown himself agreeable
and submissive.</p>

<p>It was, then, the more disappointing to the mathematician,
that one day, returning from a visit to Walsingham at Ranelagh,
he should discover Kelley and his wife in a high altercation,
Jane Dee was abroad, and the two were quarrelling loudly in the
empty house, he storming in a tempest of fury and rage, she,
weeping and protesting, her sobbing and tearful replies being
quite overborne by his spate of injurious words.</p>

<p>John Dee soon learnt the cause of this terrible scene. Kelley
had heard from his brother, Thomas, that there was a warrant out
to apprehend him as a felon for coining money, and his wife's
mother, Mrs. Cooper of Chipping Norton, having heard of the
affair, had sent for her daughter home again, and Kelley had
forbidden her to go. Not that he cared for her company, poor,
miserable wretch that she was, but he would not have this stain
on his dignity and honour that her leaving of him might mean.</p>

<p>The fiery young man flung this explanation at John Dee with so
many hot oaths, curses, and bitter, revengeful language that the
mathematician was touched with a great pang of compassion that
any Christian should use such speech and be of so revenging a
mind. He was also distressed, as he took occasion to say, that
his own credit should be endangered for embracing the company of
a disorderly person:</p>

<p>"Especially, Edward Kelley, if you be arrested at Mortlake,
which will be no small grief and disgrace."</p>

<p>"Do you not, then, believe in me, and will you not stand by
me, even after the oath which we both took upon the Bible? This
is the work of my enemies, and I shall surely be revenged upon
them."</p>

<p>John Dee turned to the trembling, weeping girl who was leaning
in an exhausted fashion on the back of Jane Dee's worn chair. He
asked her gently to tell him what she knew of the affair, and she
said: "Nothing&mdash;only that she had had this letter from her
mother, summoning her home, saying that she was married to a
cheat.</p>

<p>"I would I had not married you," stormed Edward Kelley. "It
was the work of my evil spirits!&mdash;it is the cursed Belmagel,
who inspired me to take such a piteous burden on to me. See!" he
mocked. "She has no courage, no spirit! Every slander she hears
she believes. And as for you," he cried in a towering fury, "you
do not believe in me, either! I will be away; I will go to
Islington or to Brentford! God be thanked that I did not bring
you my powders. As for my book, I will have it back again, others
may decipher it if you cannot. An angel came to me this morning,"
he said with increasing wildness, "yes, stood on my very pillow
and told me to go swiftly away, for if I stayed I should surely
be hanged."</p>

<p>"I believed in you and in your dealings with the angels,"
replied Dee, with grave dignity, "but as for these doings and
sayings of yours now, they are not meet and fitting. I have said
that I will protect you; I will listen to no slanders about you.
Edward Kelley, I believe in you."</p>

<p>The young man was very pale, his voice had sunk to a whisper;
he held on to the curtains at the window as if too exhausted to
hold himself upright and breathed heavily.</p>

<p>"You do not! You do not even mean to keep your promise.
Therefore if I might have a thousand pounds to tarry, yea, a
kingdom, I cannot. I release you from your promise of fifty
pounds yearly to me. I cannot stay, I will not stay! And, again,
I cannot abide my wife, I love her not&mdash;nay, I abhor her.
And here in this house I am misliked because I favour her no
more."</p>

<p>"I have not spoken of you and about your dealings with your
wife," said John Dee, amazed, for indeed, he had been too
absorbed in the spiritual communings to concern himself about the
unhappiness of Joan Kelley, who was to him but a shadow, another
woman in a household of women.</p>

<p>This seemed to lash Kelley into a further outburst of fury
that overcame his physical fatigue.</p>

<p>"Not you, perhaps," he shouted with an accent of furious
scorn, "but Jane, your wife I She has spoken to me; she has
pretended that she would have me take my wife into favour; she
has put her upon me, and would make me share bed and board with
her as if she did not know how things were with me, as if she did
not understand it all. She keeps up a pretence with me, I say,
and I will not stay."</p>

<p>He opened the window with desperate haste, vaulted the sill,
and was gone through the gardens. They saw him running, red and
white roses making a pattern on his fugitive figure.</p>

<p>John Dee turned to the young woman, who was sobbing
quietly.</p>

<p>"What have you to say, Joan Kelley? Do you believe in this man
or no? Will you go with him or return to your parents? You anger
him by your silence. You should have defended him and shown
yourself his friend."</p>

<p>The girl shook her head, more in bewilderment, it seemed, that
in denial.</p>

<p>"I shall return to Chipping Norton," she replied, and went out
of the room heavily.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley went to the stables, mounted the mare that he
had hired with some of the money that he had left on his first
visit, and cantered away towards Brent-ford.</p>

<p>Such was the commotion that Jane Dee came in hastily to ask of
her husband what had happened.</p>

<p>It was about seven o'cicck in the evening, the old house
stilled by twilight.</p>

<p>"Jane, this man is marvellously out of quiet against his wife,
for her friends have made bitter reports against him behind his
back and she has been silent. Jane," added the mathematician,
much moved. "I beseech the Almighty God to guide him and defend
him from danger and shame."</p>

<p>"Why should you make such a prayer? How often has this man
disturbed us with his sudden goings and his sudden returnings,
and how often have we not heard him named cozener and cheat and
still we will take no heed of it?"</p>

<p>"Jane, there is talk now of a warrant out to apprehend him.
They call him coiner and forger. It might be, for all that, true
that he is the instrument of the angels. The Polonian prince
loves him, Jane, and comes here chiefly for his sake."</p>

<p>"He will return," said she, "as he has done after other of his
wild moods."</p>

<p>John Dee replied gravely:</p>

<p>"I doubt not that God will be merciful to him and bring him at
length to such order that he shall be a faithful servant unto the
Lord."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">At ten o'clock that night John Dee was sitting
in the little room next the oratory, entering the last
conversation with the spirits, that he held very clearly in his
mind, into the great Book of Mysteries. A single candle was
alight and though it was past eleven o'clock it was midsummer and
scarcely dark.</p>

<p>Up the wooden stairs came softly Edward Kelley, unbooted. He
had come in a boat from Brentford. John Dee, with the greatest
gladness, saw him enter, but continued writing in his book, and
seeming to take all calmly and to allow events to have their own
course.</p>

<p>Kelley remained for a space inside the door.</p>

<p>"I have lent my mare," he said, "and so have returned."</p>

<p>"Well done," replied Dr. Dee quietly.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley tiptoed across the room and sat down in his
usual chair by the shew-table. He at once took up some books
which Laski had sent that day from Greenwich. They were Dutch and
German volumes on magic.</p>

<p>"The angel Madimi is here," he said. "Cannot you hear her pat
the books?"</p>

<p>And John Dee, in the twilight, heard the light strokes as the
angel struck the parchment covers of the heavy tomes.</p>

<p>"She is here," whispered Kelley drowsily. "She is speaking to
me. Take down her conversation; ask her questions."</p>

<p>John Dee took his pen and paper and said:</p>

<p>"Mistress Madimi, you are welcome in God, for good, as I hope.
What is the cause of your coming?"</p>

<p>"To see how you do," replied the little angel.</p>

<p>"I know you see me often," answered Dr. Dee, "but I see you
only by faith and imagination." And with emotion he added: "Shall
I have any more of these grievous pangs?"</p>

<p>The angelic reply to this was:</p>

<p>"Curst wives and great devils are sore companions." Dr. Dee
then asked:</p>

<p>"With respect to the Lord Treasurer, Mr. Secretary, and Mr.
Raleigh, I pray you, what worldly comfort is there to be looked
for? However, I do principally put my trust in God."</p>

<p>With a light laugh the angel replied:</p>

<p>"Madder will stain, wicked men will offend and are easy to be
offended."</p>

<p>"And being offended," cried the mathematician, "will do
wickedness&mdash;the persecution of them that mean simply."</p>

<p>"Or else," said Madimi, "they were not to be called
wicked."</p>

<p>At this Kelley impatiently interrupted and said:</p>

<p>"Will you, Madimi, lend me a hundred pounds for a
fortnight?"</p>

<p>The angel's reply was scornful.</p>

<p>"I have swept all my money out-of-doors."</p>

<p>And Dr. Dee put in:</p>

<p>"As for money, we shall have that which is necessary when God
sees fit."</p>

<p>Kelley drooped forward in his chair, a huddled outline in the
increasing dark, which was only fitfully dispersed by the one
candle burning on Dr. Dee's desk. And through his lips came the
faint voice of the angel.</p>

<p>"What dost thou hunt after? Speak, man, what dost thou hunt
after? Thou lovest not God. Lo! behold, thy bragging words are
confounded. Dost thou love gold and silver?&mdash;the one is a
thief and the other a murderer. Wilt thou seek honour?&mdash;so
did Cain. It is a just God that loveth me, all just and virtuous
men much delight in me; therefore, be thou virtuous."</p>

<p>"These reproofs are addressed to me," cried Kelley, wildly, in
his natural voice. "See! She is summoning my evil angel and his
fourteen wicked companions. It is even they who have possession
of me. She is ordering them to return to the spirit of darkness.
The hand of the Lord is heavy to smite evil! The light of His
eyes shall dispel darkness."</p>

<p>Kelley sprang to his feet. He said he could see the whole
black hideous crew of grinning, squealing shapes sink down
through the oak floor of the chamber. A movement like the rush of
a wind came and plucked them by the feet away.</p>

<p>With a great cry he added joyfully:</p>

<p>"I am lighter than I was, and I seem to be empty and returned
from a great amazing, for this fortnight I do not well remember
what I have said or done."</p>

<p>John Dee gave a cry of thankfulness. The thin voice of the
angel murmured through the dusk:</p>

<p>"You are eased of a great burden. Love God. Love thy friends.
Love thy wife."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">After the wild scene of the casting out of the
evil spirits, Edward Kelley sent for his wife from Chipping
Norton, and she came, meek and obedient as always, and took her
place in the household. She did not complain at all, though she
was little better than an unpaid servant, and her husband,
despite what he called "his lively repentance and reconciliation
with the angels," took little notice of her. The only person who
showed her any friendship was Jane Dee, who, at this juncture of
affairs, felt not only a pity for the lonely creature, but for
herself an intense need of a friend.</p>

<p>She was clear headed, and, for a woman, not ignorant.</p>

<p>She saw that affairs, both spiritual and temporal, were
becoming entangled in a gross disorder. They were still without
any prospects whatever of money save that which was given them,
liberally, but casually and uncertainly by Graf Laski, and the
long burden of uncertainty and anxiety was beginning to prove too
heavy, even for the loyal fortitude of the mathematician's
wife.</p>

<p>She felt, too, what she had not known since her marriage, a
great unrest and desire to be away from Mortlake, even from
England, and to join in those adventures which were taking place
all over the world&mdash;the discovery of new worlds, the pursuit
of new thoughts. She longed to be on a quest, even if it were but
a quest of clouds. She often sat in the evenings, now honey-sweet
with summer enchantment, by the old steps at the water gate, and
watched Arthur playing among the tall rushes with Ellen Cole, and
sailing little boats of paper on the verges of the swift
river.</p>

<p>But mostly she did not watch the child, but the clouds which
paused high above the flat, opposite banks, the willows and the
blossoming fields, and the low orchards, where the fruit was
beginning to glow among the curling leaves. In these clouds she
saw celestial palaces and angels' shapes and white-winged horses
springing forward into the eternal blue.</p>

<p>She did not disguise from herself that it was the coming of
Edward Kelley which had thus altered her disposition.</p>

<p>"I do not know if I believe in his angels, but at least he has
made me discontented with the commonplace of every day."</p>

<p>She tried to take Joan Kelley into her confidence, and,
drawing her away from those tasks in which she seemed to delight
to absorb herself, took her one evening to walk along the path
towards Richmond; the river was one side of them hastening
impatiently towards the sea, the fields, full of faded flowers
and grasses seeding to the haysel, lay on the other hand, and
above were the clouds, so high, so brilliant, formed of the most
transient vapour, and yet eternal.</p>

<p>Both the women were shabbily dressed. Their hands were a
little coarsened from housework and their faces showed fatigue,
but they moved with a tender grace and their dull clothes blended
with the soft colours of the landscape.</p>

<p>"Joan," said Jane Dee, "tell me something of your husband.
Last time I asked you evaded me, but now there is this trouble
and you have been back to your parents. You have met his brother,
too, Thomas, I think?"</p>

<p>She checked these hurried questions, and, with a smile which
she hoped would reassure the younger woman, added:</p>

<p>"I wish to know for his own good, Joan. He is, in a way, under
my husband's protection, and we have heard that there is a
warrant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have heard no more than that, either," replied Joan. "What
do I know of his past? He came to Chipping Norton," she turned
her cool, clear eyes, which were very sad for one so young, on
her companion and said simply: "You will understand the rest of
it. I know nothing about him."</p>

<p>Jane Dee believed that she did understand the rest-of it. The
man had a curious fascination; he had, in a manner, bewitched
this girl, taken her away from her parents and married her. But
for what purpose? His aversion from her he could scarcely
conceal.</p>

<p>"It is important, Joan, that we should know if he is in danger
from the law or not. Why cannot he say what he has done and who
he really is?"</p>

<p>The girl did not reply. The tips of her fine fingers touched
the spikes of the tall, flowering rushes which grew along the
edge of the river. Two white swans passed them and Jane Dee
sighed:</p>

<p>"How happy those birds are and how pure they keep their
plumage!" Then, on an impulse of affectionate tenderness she
added: "Joan, it seems that we are to be much together; cannot we
be friends and in each other's confidence?"</p>

<p>"But I have no confidence to give," replied Joan Kelley. "I am
married to this man, but I have neither home nor future that I
can see."</p>

<p>"But he and his angels promise great things. My husband has
him under his protection. He has engaged him at a wage to work
for him."</p>

<p>Joan smiled and replied:</p>

<p>"But with Edward nothing is certain."</p>

<p>Jane Dee felt this to be bitterly true. The man might go as he
had come, and she was profoundly disturbed at the knowledge that
this thought stung.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she exclaimed hurriedly, "this prince Laski will do
something for us."</p>

<p>She paused in her walk and took the small, slightly roughened
hands of Joan Kelley.</p>

<p>"He must have loved you once," she said earnestly. "For your
own sake and his, make him love you again. Make him love you,
Joan."</p>

<p>She stopped, for she heard the note of panic that was creeping
into her own voice. She knew that it was for her own protection
that she made this demand on the forlorn young wife.</p>

<p>When the two women returned to the house they found Edward
Kelley in a rare mood of excitement and exaltation. He had been
to London by water and had purchased a fine green suit of
clothes. He had also seen the Lord Laski and dined with him at a
tavern in the Strand. He smiled agreeably at the two women, but
Jane Dee averted her eyes from his cold, brilliant glance.</p>

<p>"How did you get the money for it, Mr. Kelley?" she asked.
"Surely my husband has nothing to give you?"</p>

<p>She spoke with bitter irony; she had not herself sufficient
with which to pay the household expenses for another week.</p>

<p>Edward Kelly replied with gay candour that Graf Laski had
given him some money and made a proposition which was exactly in
line with the advices and warnings given by the angels.</p>

<p>"We are all to go to Poland with this lord. He is to be our
protector. Through his means we are to bring to pass many
wonders. We shall go to the Court of the King of Poland and to
that of the Emperor at Prague. Graf Laski, the Palatine of
Siradia, will give us lodgings&mdash;noble lodgings, in his
castle at Lask. Very likely he will become king and we shall be
the foremost of all his Court."</p>

<p>Joan Kelley turned aside as if she were used to such
enthusiastic promises and went into the kitchen to help Ellen
Cole to set the supper and to make the most of the depleted store
of provisions, which Jane Dee's thrift had so patiently
husbanded. Edward Kelley did not seem to notice the going of his
wife, but continued to speak to Jane, directly and
personally.</p>

<p>She moved aside into the window place and looked out into the
thickening twilight through which the marigolds, folded on
themselves, burnt ruddy gold.</p>

<p>"Would you not delight to leave Mortlake, Mrs. Dee? Are you
not tired of this monotonous round? Think of all the things there
are in the world and we have never seen any of them. You have
never left England, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I suppose that it would be very convenient for you to leave
England now?"</p>

<p>"You think of that slanderous talk with which they trapped my
wife away from me," he replied without anger. "You cannot inflame
me by that, now."</p>

<p>"The fact that you might be wanted by the law for forging has
nothing, I suppose," said Jane, "to do with the fact that you are
eager to combine some plan with this foreigner to leave
England?"</p>

<p>He answered nothing and laughed, jingling some coins he had in
his purse.</p>

<p>"I can do much better for myself than I do here. What is forty
pounds a year, ay, or fifty, compared to what I might make!"</p>

<p>"Remember," said Jane Dee, and she was speaking more to
herself than to him, "that we know nothing of this Polonian
prince, nor if he be wealthy or bankrupt. Nor if he be in favour
with the King of Poland or no, or what his influence be with the
emperor. And would you be so lunatic as to suggest that we all
travel so far on so slender a hope?"</p>

<p>"Better a slender hope than none," replied Edward Kelley with
sudden gravity. "It seems to me that your husband gets little
encouragement from the Queen. What is an odd purse of angels, or
a present of plate, or a glittering promise, compared to what is
due to one of his talents, industry, and great insight?"</p>

<p>Jane did not answer, for this was very true. She knew,
besides, that she wanted to set out on this wide, fantastic
Journey, this quest, for what? She turned round, a sudden gaiety
of youth eclipsing her fatigue.</p>

<p>"What are we really going for, Edward Kelley? Why does Graf
Laski want to take us?"</p>

<p>"He believes in the angels," said Edward Kelley, and he smiled
at her intensely and strangely. "Do not you, Jane Dee, do not you
believe in them&mdash;in my angels who bid us all leave
Mortlake?"</p>

<p>She answered shrewdly, yet with a laugh:</p>

<p>"I take this Polonian prince to be but a worldly man. I think
you have offered him certain other inducements besides the
command of the angels."</p>

<p>"I have told him of my book and my powders."</p>

<p>"You think you can make gold? Is that the bait you have had in
mind?"</p>

<p>"Why should I not make gold? It has been done before and may
be done again. It is but to come upon the secret, either through
long siege or chance luck."</p>

<p>"My husband has made no pretences as to that!" said Jane.</p>

<p>She was suddenly troubled.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley, who was extremely quick and sensitive in his
observation, saw her clouding and said:</p>

<p>"You are a woman. Leave it all to us, to your husband and to
me. Make ready as soon as you can."</p>

<p>She shook her graceful head, although a wild exultation caused
her heart to beat quickly.</p>

<p>"You will never persuade my husband, at his age, and after his
long habits to undertake this journey." And as she spoke she felt
like a creature in prison, for she knew that she greatly longed
to be away from Mortlake, following Edward Kelley wherever he
might go, and she was bitterly ashamed of herself for this, and
also for not betraying him to her husband for the rogue he
undoubtedly was.</p>

<p>"How easily he fools everyone," she thought scornfully. "Were
I but to ask him to remove his cap before my husband and this
Polonian prince, where would his pretences be? Yet I shall never
betray him, for that would be to betray myself and to lose all
the sparkle there is in life."</p>

<p>She looked at him straightly and in silence, but, like a cry,
was the thought in her heart:</p>

<p>"What should I do if he went away?"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Dr. Dee made no opposition to the suggestion
that came simultaneously from the angels and Graf Adelbert Laski
that they should all leave Mortlake for that nobleman's estate in
Poland.</p>

<p>The mathematician had, in his youth, seen much of the world
and the prospect of travel did not, in itself, excite him, but it
seemed to excite violently Edward Kelley, who had never left his
native land. Nor did the promised meeting with nobles, princes
and kings deeply affect one who already knew how much the
promises of royal patrons might be trusted. Dr. Dee agreed to the
proposed journey because it was the direct command of the spirits
and these seemed to fit miraculously into this desperate junction
of material affairs. Michael, Uriel and Madimi all promised him
the attainment of perfect wisdom if he would put himself under
the protection of this strange new patron. Nor did the astrologer
ask any credentials of the Polonian prince; his grave, austere
simplicity and honesty of purpose accepted, with complete trust,
the patron who was vouched for by archangels.</p>

<p>Although John Dee was sometimes very practical and careful
about small details, even noting the expenditure of a few pence
in his diary and concerning himself anxiously with little matters
about the servants, the health of the children and the food that
his wife put on the table, yet he would for months together
forget all these things and in all large affairs he understood
nothing of worldly matters and had no regard for material thrift
or practical economy.</p>

<p>It was therefore the gorgeous Polish prince and the restive,
impetuous Kelley who arranged between them this journey which was
to bring them all the attainments of their hopes&mdash;wisdom,
gold, ease, comfort, power; for Adelbert Laski the Crown of
Poland, for John Dee a supreme and superhuman gift of healing and
enlightenment, for Edward Kelley all that he required of the
lures of this world.</p>

<p>These two both appeared to have great reason for hurry.
Laski's mission, whatever it was, in England had not been
successful, it seemed, and he was most desirous of returning to
his own country and looking after his affairs there, which he had
left, he confessed, in a state of tumult. Whatever Edward
Kelley's reason might have been for wishing to leave the country,
he was as urgent about his departure as if indeed there had been
a warrant out against him.</p>

<p>Jane Dee and the meek, slighted Joan were both infected by
this excitement and swept away by a certain splendour in this
sudden resolve which was to change so violently all their
lives.</p>

<p>Graf Laski bade them to be secret about the journey and by no
means to mention it at Court. It was very certain that the Queen
would not care to lose her mathematician and astrologer. However
ill she paid him, however often she deceived him by false
promises, she liked to keep him always near her, but John Dee
agreed that it would be no straining of his loyalty if he were to
depart quietly without Her Majesty's permission.</p>

<p>Laski, also, had his doubts both of Sir Francis Walsingham and
Lord Burleigh, who suspected him, he said, of plotting against
the present King of Poland.</p>

<p>It was therefore arranged that the departure from Mortlake
should be sudden and private, and for these reasons it was
somewhat hurried, for Laski and Kelley both began to be nervous
of it being blown abroad that they had come to a sudden resolve
of leaving the country. Therefore John Dee was not able to
provide better for his house and all the valuable books and
instruments that it contained, than by leaving it to his
brother-in-law, Nicholas Fromond, who promised to come and reside
in it with his family and to look after the property until the
owner's return; his absence would not be more, they all thought,
than something over a year and a half.</p>

<p>Jane Dee reminded her husband that they should appoint someone
to receive the rent of his two livings which were their sole
income, and this he promised to do, but it soon went out of his
memory.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon of Saturday, September 21st,
the party left the riverside house in wherries. It was a
beautiful day; the blue sky flushed with gold, and golden all the
willows on the river banks.</p>

<p>As Jane Dee stepped into the boat and looked back at the house
where her children had been born, she felt a sudden wrench of
homesickness and a panic longing to return and take up the old
life, however monotonous and dreary it might be, and continue to
the end, in the home to which she had first come as a bride, for
it was a home, the old, rambling house at the riverside, with the
sloping garden and the water arch, where little Arthur liked to
play, the familiar fields beyond, the little farms of neighbours,
and the familiar church where they went on Sundays.</p>

<p>Where she was going, she thought, she was like to be homeless,
for a while at least, and set among strangers.</p>

<p>But she controlled her fears, her doubts and her hesitancies,
and tried to put out of her mind what she knew of Edward Kelley.
She sat down beside his wife and the nurse and the three
children&mdash;Arthur, Katherine and Rowland, born since the
skryer had come to Mertlake.</p>

<p>The three women, their occupations being gone while they
travelled, were little regarded by the men and each felt herself
to be but a hindrance. They sat with outward patience and inward
trouble while the boat was pushed off and rowed down the
river.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley was in the best of high spirits and talked much
with Adelbert Laski, who had put a dark cloak over his fine
clothes. John Dee, a grave austere figure, sat apart and his wife
wondered, with a passionate intensity, what his thoughts might
be.</p>

<p>She could not understand one at once so wise and so simple, so
learned and so credulous. She clasped her youngest child,
Rowland, just brought back from nurse, to her heart and sat with
a brooding face.</p>

<p>They reached Westminster and went ashore until it was dark,
the men walking in the orchards near the Abbey church; the women
seated on a low wall. Edward Kelley was still strongly insistent
that they should take every precaution for secrecy. That night
they went by other wherries from Westminster stairs to Greenwich,
and stopped at the riverside house of a potter who had worked for
John Dee. There was a little space for rest and refreshment. A
great tylt boat rowed up to the quayside house and took the party
out to two vessels which Dr. Dee had hired, and which were lying
seven or eight miles downstream. Jane Dee, a little, huddled
figure on the wide dark water, felt lost in the chill darkness;
the children slept heavily.</p>

<p>The Polonian prince, the mathematician, and Edward Kelley,
with their wives and these children embarked at sunrise on Sunday
morning on a Danish double fly boat. A boyer which accompanied
them had on board Laski's servants, two men hired by Dee and two
horses.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing from the north-west and filled the pretty
sails against the golden sky.</p>

<p>Jane Dee gave the children into the charge of Ellen Cole and
Joan Kelley, and stood on the deck with a strange and
intoxicating sense of freedom. She wondered that she, who had
lived placidly so long, should have in her this wild desire for
change and adventure. The moment was transient, poignant and
beautiful.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley came and stood beside her. He had taken off the
black cap and his long, bright hair was falling on to his
shoulders, and over this he had tied a broad-leaved hat. She
smiled faintly at this instance of his carelessness. He was,
then, so sure of them all. Probably he would soon think nothing
of allowing John Dee, and even Laski, to see his mangled ears.
Doubtless he had a good story to account for them, yet her smile
was not all of contempt. She was glad to see him there; she was
glad to stand beside him on board the strong ship, with the water
below and the sky above.</p>

<p>They sailed immediately, but the wind was against them and
they anchored on the spits. And there, the wind changing to the
north-east, they were nearly driven aground during a night of
tossing anxiety, which Jane passed without sleep and without
fear. By dawn, however, the two ships had made Queenborough Head,
where the travellers were landed in small fishing boats which
brought them to Queenborough Town up the crooked creek.</p>

<p>Jane Dee and her husband and Edward Kelley were in one boat
which was nearly upset in the attempt to ride the waves at the
landing place. An oar was lost, and the water came in, wetting
the woman's skirts almost to her knees. Edward Kelley was sitting
beside her, and without a word he stooped down and bailed the
water out with his large, stiff leather gauntlets.</p>

<p>She watched him with extraordinary pleasure; at that moment
everything about him was beautiful&mdash;his face, his figure,
his actions. She felt neither the wet nor the cold and the warm
colour came into her face, making her also beautiful.</p>

<p>John Dee expressed great gratitude for this assistance.</p>

<p>"Edward Kelley," he declared, "you have saved our lives."
Then, cheerfully, as they were borne on fishermen's backs through
the ooze and mud, "God be praised for ever that all that danger
is ended with so little grief or hurt."</p>

<p>But while Dr. Dee was trying to shake something of the wet
slime from his robe, exclaiming that he was "foul arrayed,"
Edward Kelley had given Jane Dee his hand and brought her
skilfully from the boat to dry ground. She did not take her cold
fingers immediately away from his, which were wet from the ocean.
They stood together for a second, hand in hand, the little
crooked town behind them, the sea before, and in front, rising
out of the misty horizon, an enormous white cloud which surged
upwards with a triumphant movement into the very height of the
heavens.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The little party stayed for three days in
Queenborough. The women, during this time, were wholly occupied
in washing and mending clothes which had been torn or fouled
during the journey from Mortlake, and in making small purchases,
such as their limited means allowed, of necessities and comforts
which they feared they would not be able to buy abroad.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley took no notice whatever of Joan, his wife, but
the girl's spirits seemed to rise. She, too, felt the influence
of the adventure and enjoyed the prospect of strange things to
come. She laughed with the children, the colour came more
frequently into her face, and she showed herself sensible, useful
and sweet-tempered. But, just before they were about to start at
dawn on the 27th of September and sail out into the grey-green
Channel, Ellen Cole discovered a strange panic homesickness and
nothing would do but she must return to Mortlake. The two women,
then, took the children alone.</p>

<p>After forty-eight hours' sail, they landed at Brill, and found
themselves all in good health and cheerful, having had no losses
nor unexpected expenses nor sicknesses so far on the journey.</p>

<p>At the inn where they stayed here Edward Kelley set up the
table of sweet wood with its seals and the red cloth which he had
brought most carefully from Mortlake, and placed on it the
crystal. In this appeared Laski's guardian angel, Jubanladec, who
told them that their quest would prosper and gave them his
blessing.</p>

<p>At the end of two days they hastened on as fast as they were
able along the Dutch canals on the slow, heavy barges. At
Rotterdam they changed their vessels for an Amsterdam hoy and
passed through Tergowd and Haarlem to Amsterdam. Here the heavy
goods were sent round by sea to Dantzig and they proceeded to
Enkhuisen and sailed up the Zuyder Zee to Harlingen.</p>

<p>The canals now became much narrower and they had to leave
their large boats for the small scuts, which brought them,
crowded and uncomfortable, to the majestic capital of Friesland,
dark Leewarden, and there they went always slowly by water to
Dokkum in West Friesland.</p>

<p>There the travellers paused.</p>

<p>They had come so quickly and through so much that was strange
to most of them&mdash;even John Dee had never been to Holland
before, and Adelbert Laski had only passed through it once
hastily&mdash;that they scarcely realised how far they were from
home, nor how strange everything was about them in this remote,
grey tranquil north.</p>

<p>Jane Dee, silent with fatigue, sat in the low, shining clean
room of the inn at Dokkum.</p>

<p>The unreality of the strange journey made dream-like to her
that swift passage through the flat country where the horizon was
so low and the sky so immense, where everything man made was so
clean and bright and shining against the misty cold colour of
nature, where life seemed to pass with a perfect tranquillity and
a deep peace, which at once pleased and frightened her disturbed
heart.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would think, seeing the placid waters flow by
the little farm and cottages on the banks of the canals, the tall
trees and the tall spires rising so hopefully heavenwards, and
the clean women and children going to and fro: "Oh, that I might
live here for ever, lulled and enchanted!" And then, again, with
a spasm that was like terror, she would think: "Oh, that I might
get away to some country where there is noise and movement and
tumult!"</p>

<p>In this inn at Dokkum Edward Kelley again set up his crystal.
It was a Sunday evening and a gale of autumn wind sounded without
while the three men sat in Edward Kelley's bed-chamber and
watched him, kneeling before the table and the globe.</p>

<p>Gabriel instantly appeared, impatiently flinging aside the
gold curtain.</p>

<p>He approved of their journey and their conduct so far, but his
mood was relentless and austere. He gave them high and difficult
rules for their manner of living. Above all, they were to stay
together, and in brotherly charity.</p>

<p>"Bear your own infirmities and so the infirmities of others
with quiet and hidden minds. Bridle the flesh. Riotousness is the
sleep of death and the slumber of destruction. Feed the soul but
bridle the flesh, for it is insolent. Look to your servants. Make
them clean. Let your friendship be for the service of God. All
friendship else is vain and of no account. Persevere to the end.
Many men begin, but few end. He that leaveth off is a damned
soul."</p>

<p>The travellers were satisfied and stimulated by these austere
exhortations. John Dee was happier than he had ever been in his
life before. When the next day they put out into the grey sea
again and sailed beyond the island towards Embden, he felt truly
lifted from the ground, and so near to the ultimate wisdom which
he desired that it seemed to him he had but to put out his hand
and take the scroll on which all was written.</p>

<p>Jane Dee watched Edward Kelley, with whom she had not spoken
since they had stood, their fingers touching, in the ooze and
slime by Queenborough Quay. She brooded over her knowledge of his
torn ears. And over her own conviction, which was deeper than the
knowledge that he was a rogue who misled them all, that in some
strange way, she, too, was happy because this strange man was
continually in her company. She had much leisure in which to
dream at this interval.</p>

<p>It was the deep purple of the last dusk when the travellers
arrived at Embcien. The city gates were shut and they slept that
night on shipboard. It was now past the middle of October, but,
save for an occasional gale of wind, it was still warm and
pleasant weather.</p>

<p>In the morning, when the city gates were opened, the Polonian
prince went ashore and took rooms at "The White Swan," on the
quay. He declared that he would have to wait on the Landgraf and
obtain money, for they had come to an end of that which they had
brought with them from England.</p>

<p>He put the English travellers in charge of two of his servants
and said he would rejoin them at Hamburg. John Dee received this
news with grave serenity, but Edward Kelley seemed a little
disturbed and excited at thus being forced to part from his
patron, and began to murmur that it was ill-providing to start
the journey without sufficient money to conclude it. And he
ex-expressed more than one impatient hope that the Landgraf would
soon bestow on them the necessary means. The spirits, he added,
would be bitterly offended at any delay.</p>

<p>While they were at Embden they lay at "The Three Golden Keys,"
by the English or Consul's House, and then, still under the
guidance of Laski's Polish servants, they took a small boat and
sailed up the Ems to Leer, and thence to Stickhuysen and Apen,
and thence to Oldenberg. After a stay there and a night in
another small, simple village, they came to Bremen where they
lodged at an old widow's house, "The Sign of the Crown."</p>

<p>Here, Edward Kelley, who was still restless and impatient,
declared, whether Dee wished it or not, that he would again
consult the spirits, and he set up the table and shewstones and
demanded advice from his celestial guides.</p>

<p>Neither Uriel nor Michael nor the pleasant little female angel
appeared this time, but Ill, the merry angel who was clothed,
like a Vice in a morality play, in a ragged white coat.</p>

<p>This spirit's words jarred upon their mood for they were light
and mocks g.</p>

<p>"Room for a player," he exclaimed, "who would have thought I
should have met you here?"</p>

<p>In a tone of rebuke Dr. Dee replied:</p>

<p>"It is by the mercy of God that we are here. By your will and
propriety and the power of God you are here."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley also reproached the spirit for his light speech,
and added:</p>

<p>"I do not understand your words, I do only repeat your
sayings."</p>

<p>The spirit then turned from Kelley to Dee.</p>

<p>"Sir, here is money, but I have it very hardly. Bear with me,
for I can help thee no more. Come on, Andras, where are you,
Andras?"</p>

<p>Andras the other spirit, in a bare and shabby gown like a
London apprentice, appeared, but empty handed. He remarked
scornfully:</p>

<p>"Here is one of those who forgets his business as soon is it
is told him."</p>

<p>Upon which Andras replied:</p>

<p>"Sir, I went half-way."</p>

<p>And the other spirit cried:</p>

<p>"And how, then? Speak on."</p>

<p>Andras excused himself thus:</p>

<p>"Being somewhat weary, I stayed; the rather because I met my
friends."</p>

<p>And Ill retorted:</p>

<p>"Then you are a cockscomb. Well, thus it is. I placed thee
above my servants and did what I could to promote thee. And I am
rewarded with disloyalty and having brought up an idle person. Go
thy way. The officer shall deliver thee to prison and there thou
shalt be rewarded."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee interrupted the quarrel between the two spirits to ask
about Graf Laski, on whose fortunes they all hung, and whether he
had yet received the loan from the Landgraf, and whether they
should all arrive safely at Cracow or Prague, or the place
appointed for them, and if they had not all faithfully obeyed the
injunctions given them at Mortlake?</p>

<p>Both the spirits evaded these direct questions, and replied by
giving Edward Kelley a vision of Vincent Seve, Laski's
brother-in-law, who was still in England.</p>

<p>Staring into the crystal, Edward Kelley saw this Graf Vincent
in a black satin doublet, cut with cross-cuts and a ruff, and a
long cloak edged with blue lace. As Ill, the merry, gibing
spirit, was pointing out this vision, he suddenly fell all in
pieces, as small as ashes. The vision, however, continued. Kelley
saw the Graf Vincent again, walking down by Charing Cross. With
him was a tall man with a cut beard, a sword and sky-coloured
cloak. They went on towards Westminster and overtook a gentleman
on horseback, with five followers in short capes, with long
moustaches.</p>

<p>This cavalier was a thin-faced man, with a stiff cloak to his
waist and a gilt rapier. His horse wore a fine velvet foot-cloth.
They were very merry; Vincent was laughing, showing two broad
front teeth. His fingers were crooked and he carried a little
stick. Upon his left hand a scar was very plainly to be seen. He
had very high, straight, close boots. They arrived at Westminster
church, where many people were coming out. A number of boats were
in the river, in the gardens at Whitehall a man was grafting
fruit trees. The thincheeked man and Graf Vincent went up the
steps of Westminster Hall.</p>

<p>"And then," said Edward Kelley with a sigh, "all the show
vanishes away."</p>

<p>John Dee sighed also. Very little satisfaction had come from
this interview with the spirits, and in the practical matter of
money which was likely to be so soon and so sorely needed, the
angels had proved no help whatever. The astrologer wondered why
there should be this long vision of Graf Vincent, who was of no
interest to any of them.</p>

<p>For several hours the two men sat patiently in the small,
closet-like bedchamber, Kelley kneeling in front of the crystal
until he was much exhausted. But he was rewarded with nothing
further save a glimpse of a man coming out of Denmark with a bag
of amber. Dr. Dee felt that their patience was being much
tried.</p>

<p>The next day the travellers left Bremen, crossed the River
Elbe and went, by carriage and wagon, tediously to Hamburg, where
Graf Laski joined them. He gave them a little money, but seemed
gloomy and said nothing of the success of his mission to the
Landgraf. He told them to go on to Lubeck, where he would follow
them. He showed impatience at the recital of the last vision of
the spirits and soon left them.</p>

<p>In this town the spirits again appeared and made the most
extravagant promises. The crystal became bright golden as if on
fire; Kelley said this extraordinary light came from the wings of
Michael.</p>

<p>The archangel said that John Dee should have almost immediate
ease from his tedious labours and journeyings, and offered him
glorious visions of princes in rich glossy sables, kings seated
on thrones set with goodly stones, who should soon all become
suppliants to the English alchemist for the riches of his wisdom.
And other things besides wisdom were promised; the Philosopher's
Stone, the Elixir of Life, the transmutation of metals, were all
indicated by the spirits as achievements that John Dee might
consider would soon be within his grasp. The book and powders of
Edward Kelley were again mentioned. The mathematician was much
distressed by the spirits' urge for him to make another attempt
to decipher the mysterious manuscript discovered at
Glastonbury.</p>

<p>John Dee, for all his noble faith and candid credulity, was
not as dazzled by these promises as he would have been two years
ago at Mortlake. He had been travelling for two months, risking
his life in a foreign land; he had no more prospects than when he
had started. He knew no more of Graf Adelbert Laski than when he
had left Greenwich with him in the wherry loaded with all he
loved.</p>

<p>Falling on his knees beside Edward Kelley, who was gazing
fixedly into the crystal, he demanded leave to ask questions.</p>

<p>"Am I to stay here and not go on with Count Laski? Where am I
and my family to spend the winter?" The spirits were, as usual,
evasive.</p>

<p>"Spend the winter where you will. Are you so unwise as to go
with Laski now? Let him go before and provide for himself and the
better for you. In the summer, when it is more fair, you can
follow. The weather now will be hard and the travel unfit for
children. Heap not up thy wife's sorrow."</p>

<p>To this, which sounded like a rebuke, Dee replied humbly:</p>

<p>"I desire to live in peace that my spirit may the better
attend to the service of God."</p>

<p>"Well," demanded the spirit impatiently, "are you
contented?"</p>

<p>The philosopher murmured:</p>

<p>"God knows I am half-confounded."</p>

<p>And he then made an anguished appeal for information of
affairs. at home, for, since he had left Queenborough, he had
heard nothing of England. The spirit was ready with ill news.</p>

<p>"Your brother is clapped up in prison, how like you that? You
housekeeper, I mean."</p>

<p>"He talks of Nicholas Fromond, whom I left in charge of the
house at Mortlake," explained John Dee, and the angel
continued:</p>

<p>"They examined him. They say that thou hast hid divers secret
things. As for thy books, thou mayst go look for them at leisure.
It may be that thy house may be burnt for a remembrance of thee,
too. Well, if they do it, so it is. I have given thee my counsel,
and desired to do thee good. The choice is thine."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">That evening, Jane Dee spoke to her husband, and
with an impatient passion demanded of him how near they were to
the end of their journey?&mdash;if affairs went well with
him?&mdash;what solid hopes he had from Adelbert Laski, and if he
still had complete trust in Edward Kelley?</p>

<p>"Do you not trust him, Jane?" he asked.</p>

<p>They were together in their bed-chamber, the yellow light of
the rush fell over the mean bed with the coarse linen sheets.
There was a wood fire on the hearth that scarcely stirred the
chill in the air. It was very cold, both the man and the woman,
strangers in this northern country, shivered before the invisible
menace of the coming winter.</p>

<p>Jane Dee unlaced her dark, worn bodice; she was much fatigued.
She stood by the fire and let the light, if not the warmth, play
over her cold body.</p>

<p>"Trust him? I do not know." Her voice was low and wild. "We
broke up our lives at his bidding, and what has come of it? What
have you but promises?"</p>

<p>"It is true, Jane&mdash;I have nothing else. Sometimes I
mistrust the fellow."</p>

<p>"Have not we left all we had&mdash;little enough&mdash;" said
the woman bitterly, "but still, all we had, at the bidding of a
rogue? Maybe he was but a rascal who fled to keep himself from
the pillory and the prison! You made no inquiries as to whether
there really was a warrant out against him or no."</p>

<p>"I did not like to interfere, Jane. I left all in the hands of
the spirits."</p>

<p>"If the spirits be but illusion?"</p>

<p>The woman held out her cold hands to the faint blaze.</p>

<p>"If this Polonian prince has but brought us here because he
hopes that you have the secret of making gold?"</p>

<p>John Dee looked startled. He turned his sunken, tired eyes on
his wife.</p>

<p>"I have never made any pretence to that."</p>

<p>"No," she replied passionately, "but perhaps Edward Kelley
has."</p>

<p>"Then he, this Polonian prince, has been deceived. I have not
even experimented much in that direction."</p>

<p>"I know," sighed Jane Dee, in a sunken, tired voice, "but
Edward Kelley has some powder. How is it that he has been able to
deceive us all?" she demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"Jane, I am not sure that he has deceived us. I cannot
disbelieve in his angels."</p>

<p>"Yet it is always he and not you who sees them, hears
them!"</p>

<p>"You know," replied the astrologer reproachfully, "that I have
never had this power."</p>

<p>"Perhaps no one has it," she murmured; "perhaps it is all an
illusion."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee took his wife's hands.</p>

<p>"Pray with me, Jane."</p>

<p>They went down, by common impulse, on their knees on the alien
hearthstone, the old man and his young wife, who looked more like
his daughter, as she knelt beside him, unconscious of her beauty,
her gleaming hair fell thickly over her bare shoulders and open
bosom. So absorbed was she in his prayer, which she echoed in her
heart, that she completely forgot herself.</p>

<p>John Dee prayed to God, to the Author of all truth and the
guide of such as put their trust in Him.</p>

<p>"I most humbly beseech Thee, consider these promises thus to
me propounded. If they be true and from Thee, confirm them. If
they be illusions and not from Thee, disprove them, for hardly in
my judgment they do or can agree with our former precepts and
orders taken by Thee."</p>

<p>"Amen," came Jane Dee's voice behind the tightly clasped hands
pressed to her lips. "Amen."</p>

<p>The rushlight flickered and went out in an icy draught. In the
dark, so faintly stained by the firelight, John Dee raised his
hands above his head in an agony of supplication:</p>

<p>"O Lord, I doubt these promises of ease, wealth and honour. I
suspect the whole apparition of the angels to be an illusion. O
confirm my judgment, or disprove it."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">On the morrow, Jane Dee was up early for her
husband was ill with the ague. She had piled many blankets upon
him and had blown up the fire in the room and had come down to
stir the sluggish servants to get her a hot posset.</p>

<p>She found Edward Kelley already abroad, for he was seated in
the chimney corner, drawing in his great book of designs and
symbols which he carried about with him. These, he said, were the
angelic charts. He put them down at the direction of the angels,
and afterwards strove to interpret them.</p>

<p>He wore the green suit that he had bought with the first money
given him by Graf Laski, which was now something soiled and
tattered and he had put over it a heavy coat, for the winter had
begun to be very bitter, and the cold was felt even in the house.
He was without cap or hat and only his bright tangled hair hid
his ears.</p>

<p>Jane crept up to the fire with her copper pot in her hand and
began to heat water, not looking at him. The rosy flush of the
flame was over her pure profile and the long line of her
throat.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley closed his book and leant towards her.</p>

<p>"Do you repent leaving Mortlake, Jane Dee?" he asked.</p>

<p>Without turning her head, she replied:</p>

<p>"It is useless for me to repent anything, all has been done
without my will."</p>

<p>"All is for the best," he assured her. His voice was warm, low
and slightly hoarse.</p>

<p>She shivered in all her limbs as if she also had an ague.</p>

<p>"My husband and I prayed last night, Edward Kelley. We begged
God to enlighten us if we be here under an illusion or no."</p>

<p>"And what was the answer?" he asked, very soft.</p>

<p>"There was no answer, except my husband had one in his
heart."</p>

<p>He snapped his great sheepskin-covered book together and rose
to his full, graceful height, stretching his arms above his head,
as if he were stiff.</p>

<p>"Do you not perceive these doubts be the temptations of a very
foolish devil?"</p>

<p>He suddenly bent down where she knelt, close over the fire,
holding her pot by a long, wooden handle.</p>

<p>"Are you not glad to be here, Jane Dee?"</p>

<p>At that she did turn quickly and looked full at him. She was
too sincere and moved to be alarmed or shy.</p>

<p>"Why should I be glad, Edward Kelley?"</p>

<p>The beauty of his face was exceedingly painful to her, for it
was ruined&mdash;the blasted beauty of a fallen angel already
corrupting in hideousness. Disaster was in his eyes and pain
unimaginable upon his lips.</p>

<p>"You will persuade your husband to believe in me and my
angels."</p>

<p>Without moving, she answered:</p>

<p>"Where is your wife, Edward Kelley? You slight her very
cruelly."</p>

<p>"You know I have an aversion from her. You know some other
matters also, Jane Dee. But you are a coward and will not admit
anything. Never mind, I know how to wait."</p>

<p>She rose from her knees and moved away. She pulled the bell
and told the stupid and sullen servant to go in and finish
heating the water and bring it up to her husband's room.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">John Dee soon recovered of his ague and was very
impatient to be on, and though it was then the full depth of a
rigorous winter, the party again set out and travelled more than
two hundred miles, southward, through the dark, marshy district
between the Oder and the Warthe, where the frozen pools reflected
a sky like a grey goose's breast. Here they had to employ
five-and-twenty men to cut the ice for their coaches for a
distance as long as two English miles, and a strange Christmas,
brief and golden as a vision dreamt while the candle burns down,
passed them on the way. It was slow travelling by day, through
cold and across frozen lands, and strange sleeping at night in
alien houses, among foreigners.</p>

<p>The second month of the New Year they reached Lask, the Graf's
property, where they were given the provost's fair house by the
church. The little town was silent and snowbound; the travellers
were faint with homesickness. But John Dee was ill again with
ague and the two women were much occupied in nursing him, which
helped to still their own secret pain.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley set up the shew-table and another angel,
Nalvage, who in appearance was like the late King Edward, showed
in the crystal, and, after revealing many cabalistic signs, bade
them, despite the severity of the weather, move on to Cracow.</p>

<p>Outside the narrow window the snow heaped up softly against
the narrow windows, and a great depth of cold clouds hid the
stars.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee found Edward Kelley's wife crying in a
lonely corner of the dark old house by the church at Lask. Not
only was the girl bitterly homesick, but she was suffering from
some especial unkindness from her husband, but what it was she
would not disclose.</p>

<p>Chipping Norton, the kindly faces of her own folk, and her
pleasant English girlhood seemed very far away from the tired,
exhausted creature. To Jane Dee, also, the adventure had lost
something of its high exaltation.</p>

<p>They found themselves in the depth of a winter more rigorous
than they imagined winter could be, many hundreds of miles away
from home, in a place where ever news took two or three months to
reach them and depen dent upon a patron who, so far, had no more
redeemed his promises than had the Queen.</p>

<p>They were lodged in one of his houses, certainly, and he had
maintained them partly at his expense, but Jane Dee could discern
no sign of those glories, splendours and luxuries which the
angels had so frequently promised in Mortlake.</p>

<p>She took Joan by the shoulders and drew her closely to her
bosom with the tenderness of an elder sister. She liked this
docile creature who bore a hard fate so uncomplainingly.</p>

<p>"What has happened now, Joan? You must keep up your spirits,
though I confess myself that my heart is heavy."</p>

<p>"We have all been bewitched," said Joan Kelley. With a sigh of
fatigued relief she put her arms round the other woman's neck.
"If it had not been for your kindness&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jane Dee interrupted warmly:</p>

<p>"How could I have contrived, without you, Joan, with the
children, and only these strange, foreign servants, whose
language I do not understand?"</p>

<p>Then, with a return of the fortitude and cheerfulness that was
natural to her:</p>

<p>"Perhaps we complain too soon; perhaps we are cowardly, and
our trust is not sufficient. I and my husband went on our knees
to God, but He made no sign either way. But it may be," she
added, with an eager passion, "that what the angels said is
true."</p>

<p>Joan Kelley lifted cheerful eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in my husband?"</p>

<p>"I try to. I must!"</p>

<p>Jane Dee thought of the pierced ears and nearly spoke of them,
but the words would not pass her lips, for it seemed to her that
to mention this would be to confess her own treachery and
duplicity. It was many months since she had taken the cap from
Edward Kelley's head in the panelled parlour at Mortlake. To
speak now would be to raise a question as to the reason for her
long silence.</p>

<p>"Your husband believes," said Joan Kelley with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes. Though he is afflicted with an ague, he sits closeted
with Edward Kelley and asks the angels all manner of questions as
to when we are to move and when they order that we must go to
Cracow. And then he asked for a cure for his ague, and if some
treasure may be sent to us." The woman's hands rose and then fell
in a gesture of despair. "And all this comes to nothing."</p>

<p>"Jane," suggested the tired girl faintly, "would you not speak
to this strange prince, this Adelbert Laski, and ask him yourself
what he intends for us and under what expectations he has brought
us here?"</p>

<p>"You guess what that is?" asked Jane Dee fearfully. "I am
afraid to say."</p>

<p>"Then I will speak. I believe that this Polonian prince has
brought us here because he thinks that our husbands know the
secret of making gold. Only yesterday they were asking the
spirits about the red and white powder found at Glastonbury, and
the book that my husband cannot decipher. Do you think, Joan,
that your husband has any such secret?"</p>

<p>Edward Kelley's wife shook her frail head.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of this man at all. You have seen the aversion
he has from me, and how he leaves me alone, day after day, night
after night. But I know," she added reluctantly, "that he lived
in great poverty and secrecy when he was in England, and I do not
think if he had known how to make gold that would have been his
way of life."</p>

<p>This was the common explanation of the matter, and Jane Dee
sighed to hear it. She remembered when Edward Kelley had gone to
Brentford to get drunk on the first money he had received from
Graf Laski, and his eager ride into town to buy hose and riding
boots and hire a horse. All these were the actions of a man avid
for money. She remembered, too, how quickly he had snatched at
the salary of 40 a year, offered him by the man at Islington,
using this as a means to force her husband to pay him yet
more.</p>

<p>"He has no such secret," she said sadly, as she kissed the
girl's tear-stained face and put her from her.</p>

<p>"I will see Graf Laski," she added resolutely. "I shall have a
chance when my husband is in bed with his ague. I shall tell him
quite clearly that he has been deceived, and entreat him, if he
brought us for nothing but that, to let us return to
England."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee was not long in finding her
opportunity. On the following day her husband could not leave his
bed, not even to go into the next room and watch while Kelley
gazed into the shewstone. Shivering with his ague, though still
cheerful and confident, he lay in the high, dark bedroom in the
old house by the church, which his wife so detested.</p>

<p>This continued illness of the mathematician had put Kelley
into one of his wild, tempestuous moods. He would not remain in
the house, he declared, but must go out into the town of Lask to
look for a metal smith, who might make three iron hasps and
padlocks to keep the table for the shewstones secure and private,
also a pedestal for the crystal to rest on the table, for what he
had was too low.</p>

<p>He had seen, he added, the angels even that morning and they
had repeated their advice that everyone was to go to Cracow.</p>

<p>Jane Dee stood at the door of her husband's room and refused
Edward Kelley permission to pass in with this message.</p>

<p>"We will none of us go to Cracow in the dead of winter," she
said, frowning.</p>

<p>"If you disobey the spirits," he answered her rudely, "you
cannot expect any favours."</p>

<p>"And no favours have they given me," said Jane Dee.</p>

<p>She suspected that he would endeavour to force past her into
her husband's presence, but he turned away and went slowly down
the stairs.</p>

<p>Jane Dee followed him, and in her bitterness and distress she
was almost forced to say: "I have been led and deceived by a
rogue." But she was silent, because she did not want utterly to
lose his confidence, and also because of that strange, unbidden
tenderness and rising passion that she felt for this man.</p>

<p>He looked at her and opened his lips as if about to speak, but
no words came. The house was intolerably dark because of the high
wall all round the garden outside, and the snow falling heavily
from a sky that looked like ashes.</p>

<p>Jane thought that the very worst of the days in England, when
the future seemed most uncertain and the present most vexatious,
had been fair and sweet compared to this. They had at least been
surrounded by friends, with the Queen near at hand, the men like
Walsingham and Burghley, Sidney and Rayleigh, to send them
pleasant words with a purse of angels or a cup with a standing
cover which could be pledged for good money.</p>

<p>At this Edward Kelley spoke.</p>

<p>"I see it is to you, Jane Dee, and not to these others that I
must kneel."</p>

<p>"No doubt," said she, "in the end, you and I will deal one
with another."</p>

<p>She turned away into a little room she kept to herself, and
affected to busy herself by taking their few clothes out of the
press and turning them over and mending them. They had had to buy
furs and cloaks of serge against the long travelling in the
winter. It was difficult to keep the children warm. Arthur often
cried and asked why they could not go home. She had to thank God
that they were all yet in health.</p>

<p>As soon as Edward Kelley had left the house Jane Dee dropped
her pretence of a task, put on her coarse hood, lined with
wolfskin, and without calling up one of the foreign servants,
whom she so disliked, she set off for the Castle.</p>

<p>She knew that Adelbert Laski, the Palatine of Siradia, was
there, and this was a lucky chance for her, since more often than
not he was abroad, either in Cracow or Prague or in his other
property at Kesmark, where his wife was, a woman who the angels
said was no friend of the English adventurers.</p>

<p>As Jane Dee went on her way, holding her cloak before her
face, for the snow was thick and stinging, she puzzled her mind
as to some conclusion about this man&mdash;why he had brought
them there and who he might really be, what plot or intrigue it
was in which he was concerned? She walked as quickly as she was
able to; the weather impeded her, at the corners of the narrow
streets the wind blew the snow in gusts into the hollow of her
hood.</p>

<p>The Castle was like a shadow against the flying flakes, grey
turrets and grey walls. She had a fair excuse for her visit. She
told the porter she had come to say that it was useless for his
master to attend the conferences with the spirits that day, for
her husband's ague had increased in the night. She added that she
had some message for the Palatine's ears alone.</p>

<p>She was instantly admitted into a small apartment, to her
mind, very rudely furnished. It had nothing of the luxury she was
accustomed to in great English houses; the furniture was old, the
walls bare and dirty. Through the high, pointed window fell the
bitter grey light of the snow-filled sky.</p>

<p>Graf Laski, the Palatine, was standing by the hearth, on which
the great scarlet and golden flames struggled up the shaft, down
which the melted snow fell now and then, hissing on the glowing
logs. Jane Dee looked at this man more shrewdly than she had ever
looked at him before. He seemed very different from the light,
volatile, impressive creature who had been rowed down the Thames
in the Queen's barge with trumpeters and music. His aspect was
grey, and the anxious woman thought, slightly sinister; his coat
was unbuttoned on a shirt of cut-work, and his long hair fell
forward from his face, so that the firelight, gleaming through
it, made it like a network of red gold beside his long, strange
profile.</p>

<p>He received her very courteously, and, she quickly perceived,
with no interest whatever in her, as a woman or a personality. He
had probably scarcely noticed her in his visits; she had been, to
him, only like a nurse or a servant in the background.</p>

<p>"My husband is ill."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, so much I heard from your message. And I am not to
come to-day. But what of Mr. Kelley? Cannot he and I converse
with the spirits without the aid of your husband?"</p>

<p>Jane Dee sat down in the chair which he offered her and
loosened her cloak and shook the melting snow from the hem. It
was an old, high-backed chair covered with worn tapestry and
reminded her of that in which she had so often sat in the
panelled parlour at Mortlake with the children asleep on her
knee, or playing at her feet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edward Kelley does not come into this argument," she
said. "And I know nothing of him. It is of myself and my husband
and my family that I would speak."</p>

<p>He looked at her impatiently, yet with a certain realisation
for the first time of her personality. Jane Dee sighed, as if
very tired, for this interview was a considerable nervous
effort.</p>

<p>"I want to know, Graf Laski, why you brought us here, so many
hundreds of miles into this strange land of yours? We have
already cost you much money and are likely to cost you much
more."</p>

<p>"Your husband knows why you came, Mrs. Dee&mdash;your husband
and Edward Kelley. We followed, all three, in the direction of
the spirits."</p>

<p>"The spirits may be an illusion, Graf Laski. Even my husband
himself sometimes says so, and in his rages Edward Kelley will
swear that he does not believe in them, or that, if they do
exist, they are but phantoms and damned souls. Surely a man like
you has some other warrant than the commands of spirits?"</p>

<p>Adelbert Laski put his fine hand to his bare throat. He had
seated himself on a low stool by the fire and the amber red light
was full over him. Jane Dee, looking a him very keenly, thought
that he appeared ill, haggard and anxious, even as she was
herself.</p>

<p>"Do you not know my hope, Mrs. Dee?" Then he added abruptly,
without waiting for her to answer his question: "I believe that
your husband and Edward Kelley know how to make gold. They have a
red and white powder and a mysterious book."</p>

<p>She raised her hand and let it fall wearily.</p>

<p>"Do not put your trust in that. My husband knows nothing of
these things. He has not even experimented in that direction. His
quest is for wisdom, for the eternal peace that heavenly wisdom
brings. His desire is to please God and to be the interpreter of
God's wishes to mankind."</p>

<p>Jane Dee spoke these words with great dignity. Graf Laski
laughed a little, but replied:</p>

<p>"My desire does not rise so high. I want to discover how to
make gold. I want the crown of Poland."</p>

<p>"And do you think," asked Jane Dee, "that you will achieve
these ends with the help of a man like Edward Kelley?"</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply and demanded:</p>

<p>"What is Edward Kelley to you?"</p>

<p>With the energy of one, who in a passion of self-scorn turns a
sharp weapon on himself, Jane Dee replied:</p>

<p>"I think he is a rogue and an impostor. He has a young wife
whom he married in some caprice, and whom he treats very ill. She
knows nothing of him and if she did she would not speak for it is
a brave, loyal creature. But this she could not disguise: that
this man was in poverty when she met him and his poverty has
continued. Why, did you not see yourself, Lord Laski, how he
grasped the few nobles you gave him and went to Brentford to
spend it on a riot?"</p>

<p>"That may be," replied the Polonian prince, smiling. "It might
even be that the fellow is a rogue, yet he might still have this
secret. They experiment, they confer constantly. Any day they
might discover the transmutation of metals, the Philosopher's
Stone, and then I should be the most powerful man in the
world."</p>

<p>"I think you are deluded," replied Jane. "I take this man to
be a scoundrel, and I believe he contrived and urged this journey
that he might be away from the officers in England who wanted him
for forgery."</p>

<p>"What have you against this man, Mrs. Dee?"</p>

<p>She smiled ironically as she thought how startled her
questioner would be if she gave him the truthful reply to that
demand.</p>

<p>"We have all been deceived," she said heavily, "we have been
taken from our homes and our country, brought here to this
fearful place in this dreadful weather for the sake of a
prison-bird."</p>

<p>"Do you think that Edward Kelley has your husband deluded?"
asked Adelbert Laski with a touch of anxiety.</p>

<p>She was sorry when she saw his ravaged face, for she believed
that he must have much upon this enterprise to be so
concerned.</p>

<p>"I do so believe," she replied firmly. "Do you not mark how
the angels evade and hesitate? What did they not say, even
yesterday?: 'Wise as I am, I know not yet what to advise.' And
when they are asked for anything practical, be it but a handful
of money, they have some excuse not to give it. And observe, Lord
Laski, that none save Edward Kelley see these angels? Is not that
so? Though you have been present when he has been gazing into the
shewstones, have you seen anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Yet Kelley looked like a man inspired. I swear he is
no ordinary mortal. Never before has anyone held me so
fascinated, and I do not believe that a common cheat could thus
dupe me."</p>

<p>"So I also thought," said Jane Dee, "and yet this happened."
She added quickly, covering up these words of which Graf Laski
took no heed: "You deal with me frankly. If these two have not
the secret of making gold, what use are they to you? Are you the
wealthy man we thought you in England?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing. I do not know, even, if I could raise the
money to take us all to Cracow. My estates are most heavily
mortgaged, and on the Kesmark property I have raised a loan which
by the end of next April I must pay. Without the help of the
Angels or the Emperor I know not how it can be met."</p>

<p>A shock of keen disappointment fell like a cloak of lead on
Jane Dee's spirit. She scarcely knew how to support this
revelation as she forced her courage and said bravely:</p>

<p>"My husband is a great man and famous all over Europe. Surely
there is someone who would do something for us, apart from the
spirits and the hope of gold?"</p>

<p>"I want us all to go to the capital," said the Palatine.
"Perhaps the King, Stephan Bathory, would do something for us."
And then he added sharply: "And what do you know, Mrs. Dee, of
either the gold or the spirits? I believe in both." And he struck
his chest with emphasis, rising to his full height. "Yes, I
believe in both. It is your woman's timidity which refuses to
allow you to credit Edward Kelley. You dislike him because he has
upset your life, taken you away from your home. One day you will
know him for the great man that he is."</p>

<p>Jane Dee rose and leaned against the high-backed chair.</p>

<p>"Have you seen him," she whispered, "without his black cap?
His ears are torn where he has been twice nailed to the
pillory."</p>

<p>"That is a vulgar interpretation, Mrs. Dee," Graf Laski said
hastily. "I <i>have</i> seen Edward Kelley without his cap and he
has given me the explanation of the wounds in his ears. It was
when he was struggling with a crew of evil spirits who sometimes
possess him. They grasped him by the ears to drag him away and
left their mark on him."</p>

<p>Jane Dee picked up her clumsy, fur-lined cloak. As she put it
over her shoulders she said:</p>

<p>"I do not doubt Edward Kelley's evil spirits, Graf Laski. They
are such as you and I shall never see."</p>

<p>He answered loudly and nervously:</p>

<p>"You cannot shake me! You cannot shake me! Tell Edward Kelley
that I shall come over to-night both to see your husband and to
sit with him while he gazes into the shewstone."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">When Jane Dee returned to the house by the
church which she could by no means think of as home she found
Edward Kelley waiting for her, and the look on his face made her
shudder and gave her a strange sensation of creeping belief in
his supernatural powers, for he was glowering at her in a fury
and his first words were:</p>

<p>"So you went to Lord Laski to betray me, eli! You told him
that I was an impostor, that I could not make gold, and that I
never saw the spirits!"</p>

<p>"How did you know that, Edward Kelley?"</p>

<p>She was really frightened and had to sit down and hold her
heart while she stared at him wildly. His face was transformed;
the pale eyes seemed to flare in the deep orbits, his colourless
lips were twisted back from the teeth, he looked half-beast,
half-angel and wholly damned.</p>

<p>"I know everything&mdash;all you do and say, Jane Dee."</p>

<p>She tried to shake off the spell which he undoubtedly
exercised upon her.</p>

<p>"No doubt you have your spies everywhere," she said, and went
upstairs to her husband's bedroom, as to a place of refuge; she
locked the door, but no one tried the handle.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">That evening Adelbert Laski came again to the
provost's house. John Dee put on his fur robe, trembling with
ague as he was, and was helped into the cabinet where the
shewstone was placed on the sacred table. And the spirits showed
themselves unrelenting. The whole party was to go to the capital,
where the greatest good fortune might be expected from the
patronage of the king.</p>

<p>Jane had the bitter humiliation of realising that her visit to
Graf Laski had been without any fruit. He was as infatuate as
ever with Kelley, and so was her husband, and the long forward
journey to the capital of Poland was resolved on without any
opportunity for further discussion.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The English travellers reached the fortified
town of Cracow, at once a university, a royal residence, and the
burial place of the Polish kings, by the middle of March, after
travelling tediously from the north-west across the flat plain
between the Vistula and Rudowa.</p>

<p>After lodging for a while in the suburbs by the Church of the
Visitation, John Dee hired a house in Saint Stephen Street. He
took it for a year and engaged a maid-servant by the name of
Mary, a manservant named John Crocker, and a boy.</p>

<p>The house was old, high and dark, but it was a better
semblance of a home than any Jane Dee had had since she left
Mortlake, and she began to have hopes which she could not
consider unreasonable, that, even if the angelical promises
proved deceptive, and Edward Kelley never discovered how to make
gold, still her husband might find some honourable employment
with Stephan Bathory, who was acclaimed everywhere as a wise king
and a great man.</p>

<p>The house was narrow and there seemed many stairs in it for
the number of rooms. It was not very well furnished, and there
were numbers of things needed which there was no money to buy.
But they had brought a certain amount of furnishings with them
from England and at last Jane Dee, after seeing these dragged for
many hundreds of miles, found uses for them, and a pleasant
accupation in arranging the rooms for the children and
herself.</p>

<p>In this task she was diligently helped by Joan Kelley and
Mary, the maid. The house was draughty, and though the spring
should have been in the air, the snow was still continuous.</p>

<p>Graf Laski, who had been expected to be there to present the
travellers at once to the king, who was in residence in the royal
palace, lingered behind at Lask or Kesmark. The delay caused
Edward Kelley to turn restive.</p>

<p>He harped much on the question of money and asked how they
were to live without means. He sharply rebuked his wife when she
demanded of him a few guilders with which to buy clothes, for her
own garments were much worn. Even with the help of Jane Dee she
could not turn them about much longer.</p>

<p>The top room under the high-peaked roof of the tall house was
used as a study by John Dee, and there the shewstones and the
table, that had travelled so far, were again set up.</p>

<p>The spirits appeared almost at once and began to dictate
cabalistic signs and symbols, elaborate diagrams and drawings.
Though Kelley executed these with the most exquisite
draughtsmanship and careful precision, he affected himself unable
to understand them and began to talk of a waste of time and
tedious labours for nothing, and to express, to the
mathematician's profound distress, his complete disbelief in the
angels.</p>

<p>John Dee protested against this incredulity, which was, he was
certain, ruining their standing with their angelic guides.</p>

<p>"Your wilful fantasy," he declared, "perverts your reason, and
whereas you find fault with our instructors, I, who, much more
narrowly pursue their words, know that they give direct answers
to my questions. Except, indeed, when you misreport them or I
make a mistake in reading, hearing or writing."</p>

<p>But Edward Kelley said he wished he were in England and might
have nothing more to do with any spiritual creatures, and that if
the books and drawings were his he would burn them all, including
the famous Book of Mysteries.</p>

<p>John Dee, in his credulous simplicity, prayed that Edward
Kelley might be brought safely through this great storm of
temptation of doubting and mistaking. For himself, he bore all
patiently for the sake of God.</p>

<p>Then for a day or two Edward Kelley became submissive,
saying:</p>

<p>"I am contented to see and make true reports of what the
spirits will show, but my heart stands against it."</p>

<p>But at last, after three more days of his slaying, he
impatiently confessed himself bewildered and exhausted, for he
was no mathematician, with the elaborate diagrams and signs
dictated by the angels, and in a fury he scattered all the papers
on the floor, and left the house, taking with him what was left
of the money which Graf Laski had given him on their departure
from Lask.</p>

<p>John Dee could do nothing to meet this disastrous outbreak,
but deeply engaged himself in prayer. It was then May, and as yet
nothing practical had come out of their travels or their
delays.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Graf Laski paid a brief visit to the tall, dark
house in Cracow. He seemed a man distracted and almost beside
himself. Whatever his intrigues were (and this mattered little to
the English adventurers), they appeared to have ended in
disaster. He admitted that he was out of favour with King
Stephan; his own vision of the Crown of Poland was growing dim.
He showed himself to be considerably vexed at the absence of
Edward Kelley, who had gone no man knew where, but, judging from
his former outbreaks, it was more than likely that he was
spending his time, health and substance in low debaucheries in
the worst quarters of the town.</p>

<p>Jane Dee, with a bitterness that seemed out of all measure
even to her keen misfortune, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Lord Laski, did I not tell you this fellow was a rogue?"</p>

<p>Her husband rebuked her gently.</p>

<p>"No rogue, Jane, but one who is often tempted, and one who
often falls. He will yet return and be penitent."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee's patience and humility, his patient cheerfulness,
held them all up. Passion-tossed and doubtful as they were
themselves, they sheltered in the citadel of his intense
faith.</p>

<p>Laski, who was still endeavouring to raise money to redeem his
Kesmark property, lodged in a Convent of Franciscans, and from
there sent daily inquiries as to Edward Kelley. On the third day
after the skryer's disappearance the faith of John Dee was
justified.</p>

<p>He was kneeling, alone in the high, peaked upper room, praying
before the shewstone, which to him was nothing but a globe of
light, when the door opened softly and Edward Kelley crept in
with the same furtive silence that he had used when he had
returned after his outbreak at Mortlake.</p>

<p>Although overwhelmed by joy at this sight, John Dee continued
to pray.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley crept across the darkening room, for it was the
hour of twilight, and knelt beside him with the grateful humility
of a returned prodigal. The black cap was undone, the long
strings hanging beneath his chin and the tangled locks of bright
hair falling either side his bare throat. His face was hollowed
and colourless as he clasped his hands and gazed into the globe
of crystal.</p>

<p>Instantly there appeared Gabriel, holding a dart, like a flame
of fire, upright in his hand. Edward Kelley I began to weep,
declaring that the angel was pleading with him with such
tenderness and affection that he was abashed to the earth by
shame and grief and penitence for his wrongdoing. Clasping his
hands and weeping, the repentent skryer promised to renounce all
the errors of the blasphemous doctrine he had hitherto held and
all his disbelief and questionings of the wisdom of the
spirits.</p>

<p>At this display of emotion, Gabriel, with the remark that "For
the chosen there is no sin," disappeared. It was, Kelley
declared, part of his punishment that he should have to kneel now
for hours before the stone without either cloud, veil, or voice
appearing, which, to one of his impatience, was no light
pang.</p>

<p>Yet, he declared passionately, he was prepared to endure this
punishment, and the time thus spent was better employed than the
hours consumed in any human follies.</p>

<p>John Dee, full of joy and greatly uplifted by this conversion
of one so beloved, so necessary to him, rose to his feet, but
Edward Kelley remained on the ground, and, with a passionate
outburst of tears, opened his tumultuous heart.</p>

<p>He had intended, he said, when he had last left the house,
never to return. The evil spirits had wholly taken grip of his
soul. He had found, he thought, the secret of the Glastonbury
book. It had meant what he so greatly coveted&mdash;riches and
power. But Gabriel had come after him and brought him back, and
here he was, at John Dee's feet, and there he would remain. This
conversion was final and complete.</p>

<p>"I no longer fear," he cried, "poverty. Life eternal is more
than riches and wealth. I will doubt no more, I will
believe."</p>

<p>The mathematician, much pleased, long-suffering, and full of
love for the young man, raised him from the ground and kissed him
on both of his cheeks, which were wet with difficult tears. And
as he did so he murmured an eager prayer of thanksgiving for
Edward Kelley's conversion and for the defeat of the devils, and
prayed for them both that they might have continual zeal, love of
truth, purity of life, charitable humility, and constant patience
to the end.</p>

<p>Then Edward Kelley went down the long, dark stairs to the
small room on the street, where Jane Dee was just lighting the
lamp, and setting it on the supper table. He was unkempt and
dishevelled and his eyes were red from tears.</p>

<p>She looked at him steadily over the small flame and said
nothing.</p>

<p>He went up to her and fell on one knee and took the hem of her
dress and kissed it, and Jane Dee did not even look down at him.
When he rose he said:</p>

<p>"You knew that I should return."</p>

<p>And she had nothing to say, save:</p>

<p>"Go to your wife, Edward Kelley."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Edward Kelley's patient, docile mood continued.
When Laski came to the house in Saint Stephen Street the next day
and climbed up to the little study under the peaked roof, the
sittings were at once successful and Michael appeared and
promised that Laski should be King of Poland.</p>

<p>But this prophecy was confused by the appearance of several
curious images&mdash;a figure in black wax, a dead hand and a man
like an Italian, carrying an iron chest.</p>

<p>Then, leaving the crystal, Edward Kelley had direct visions.
Four magnificent castles at the four corners of the compass, and
from every castle was a cloth, the sign of majesty. At the East,
red, like new smitten blood, at the South, lily-white, at the
West, green, garlic-bladed like the skins of many dragons, the
North, hair-coloured, black&mdash;like bilberry juice. Four
trumpeters issued from the castles, the trumpets were the shape
of pyramids, wreathed. Three ensign bearers with the names of God
on their banners followed them. Seniors, kings, princes and
train-bearers, angels in four phalanxes like crosses, all in
their order, marched to the central court and arranged themselves
about the ensign.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley explained the complicated allegory thus:</p>

<p>"The castles are watch-towers provided against the Devil, the
watchman in each is a mighty angel. The ensigns publish the
redemption of mankind. The angels of the air which come out of
the crosses are to subvert whole countries, without armies, and
in the war waged against the Powers of Darkness." And he began to
absorb himself totally with these elaborate complications, taking
himself up with tables of letters, the explanation of the names
of the King, angels and seniors.</p>

<p>But, on Graf Laski showing some impatience on being plunged
into these labyrinths of symbols, the spirits became again
practical, and said they were about to reveal the healing
medicines, the property of fire, the knowledge, finding, and use
of metals, the virtues of stones, and the understanding of arts
mechanical. They ended by wanting to know why the adventurers had
not gone to the Emperor, or to the King of Poland, and John Dee
offered simply his old excuse of poverty.</p>

<p>He then asked for some news of his house at Mortlake and of
how his name stood at the English Court. He was reassured. The
angels declared that his property had been sealed by the Queen's
orders and that she often had her astrologer in her mind, and
would stay his good friend on his return.</p>

<p>Graf Laski had received money from the sale of some of his
property and, urged by the constant advices of the spirits,
decided, despite the expense, to take Dee and Kelley with him to
Prague, city of the alchemists, where the sombre and melancholy
Emperor, self-absorbed in Strange experiments and curious
learning, lived lonely in his great, dark-palace. But the women
were to be left behind in Cracow.</p>

<p>"How do you like that, Jane Dee?" asked Edward Kelley, coming
upon her where she sat, tired and forlorn by the spent fire.</p>

<p>Her husband was abroad with Graf Laski. They had gone to wait
on some man who had promised them introductions to the Emperor's
Doctor of Medicine, Centias. Jane Dee had believed that Kelley
was with them, and he came upon her by surprise, and took her, as
it were, disarmed, for at his question she began to weep. The
children were all long since abed, the youngest had been ill for
some days and only that evening had begun to recover. His father,
coming out of his deep absorption in spiritual matters, had
tenderly treated the child and it was through his skill that he
had mended. Upon which, as a thanksgiving vow, John Dee had
promised that for all the Saturdays of his life he would eat but
one meal.</p>

<p>"I did not think you would return," said Jane Dee. She could
not for sheer relief check her tears, they streamed down her
unprotected face until Edward Kelley put his handkerchief into
her hand and then she wiped her eyes, childishly.</p>

<p>"I am going to Prague, sweetheart," he said, "to make the
fortunes of all of us."</p>

<p>"Your wife," said she, "is upstairs much fatigued. She has
been toiling with the children. Are you and I to talk like this
down here?"</p>

<p>"We will talk as we may, how we may in what little space is
given us," replied the young man.</p>

<p>He went on his knees by her humble chair and took her hand,
which trembled from fatigue and was worn from much work.</p>

<p>"You believe me to be a poor rogue," he said. "Yet I know you
are sorry to think that I shall go to Prague and leave you alone
here."</p>

<p>She looked down on him with a weeping tenderness. The citadel
of her pride and fortitude was in ruins.</p>

<p>"It is a strange thing to happen to me," she whispered, "that
you should come as you did that day at Mortlake. Do you remember
how I opened the door? The wind was flying past with a sigh. It
seemed to me that it came into the house and you followed
it."</p>

<p>"And I have thought of you, Jane Dee, night and day ever
since."</p>

<p>"I do know you for a poor rogue," she said sadly. "You deceive
my husband, you deceive this Polonian prince. There are no angels
and no devils come to you save those you carry in your own heart,
Edward Kelley." She added on yet a deeper note of wild sadness,
as he made no movement: "If Edward Kelley be indeed your name,
for I doubt if I shall ever know anything of you, nor where you
come from, nor where you will go to."</p>

<p>He rested his cheek against her hand where it lay on the arm
of the chair.</p>

<p>"Poor Jane," he said, "you will not believe in the spirits,
but I have seen them&mdash;angels and archangels, in air and in
flame, on the roll of the tempest, and in the waves of the ocean.
They brought me to you," he added. "They brought us
together."</p>

<p>She looked long at the worn beauty of his face. It seemed to
her as if she stared at him across a mist. Their strange
relations with one another had been rendered even more
extraordinary by the wild and remarkable life they had both led
since they had met. His acquaintanceship with her had meant the
uprooting of all her old customs and traditions, the leaving of
all that was dear and familiar to her, the casting of a cloak of
unfamiliarity, of the incredible and the marvellous over all her
life, which had been so homely and simple. She asked
curiously:</p>

<p>"Why do you not love your wife, Edward? She is so good and
patient. Why did you take her from her home but to illtreat
her?"</p>

<p>He answered sullenly:</p>

<p>"I was misled."</p>

<p>"You have broken her heart, Edward, and now, I suppose, you
would try to break mine."</p>

<p>He did not answer, but remained in his relaxed attitude like a
tired child. Under the flaps of the black cap, between the folds
of the bright hair she saw hi: torn ears, and she asked herself
with a wonder in which there was no longer any self-scorn, for
she had bowed to her destiny: Who was this creature whom she
regarded with such a tender passion? Some jailbird, some wretch
who had stood with his ears nailed to the pillory, to be pelted
and jeered at by the vulgar? Some man who had forged and coined,
for all she knew, robbed and murdered?</p>

<p>But it mattered nothing. He had come into her life out of the
storm, like some wild creature escaping the hunters might have
fled to her lap for safety. She did not believe in his angels,
but she thought they might both very well be damned.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "it is my husband who saves us both. He
is a man without guile, of spotless life and upright faith. Were
it not for him you would be revealed as a poor rascal. And I
should be but 2 silly woman, adrift and helpless."</p>

<p>He raised his pale eyes, and looked at her with 2 mocking
question in his glance.</p>

<p>"What does your husband, then, make of us, Jane Dee?"</p>

<p>"He gives us dignity. He protects you and gives me power."</p>

<p>With her worn and tired hands she raised his face. He made no
opposition as she gently put him from her and rose.</p>

<p>"I shall always be loyal to my husband, Edward Kelley. That is
not only my duty, but my salvation.'</p>

<p>"You do not know me, yet," he answered. "How patiently I can
wait, how diligently I can labour!"</p>

<p>She moved towards the door. She was bitterly conscious of the
strangeness of her surroundings. How alien was this country, how
remote this chamber! She moved as if in the dark depths of a
dream, and it was difficult for her to keep a grasp on reality.
She asked the question that had been long in her heart, and which
she had never meant to put into words:</p>

<p>"Why did you come to Mortlake? Was it because of my husband's
fame, because you thought he was both learned and credulous, to
be the mask and cloak for your designs?" As he did not reply, she
came to the heart of her question: "Why did you stay, Edward
Kelley? Why, though you have gone away so often, have you always
returned?"</p>

<p>"You know the answer," he replied wearily. "Yet, I suppose you
want to hear me say that I stayed and I returned because of
you."</p>

<p>She closed the door on him and went upstairs.</p>

<p>How dark and narrow the stairs were, how strange and alien was
the tall house with the peaked roof The winter was over at last;
there was a creeping warmth in the thick air. Jane Dee felt
homesick for an English summer. She opened the heavy, dark door
of the children's sleeping-room and thought: "Surely we are the
strangest pair of lovers."</p>

<p>She entered the room where the rushlight burnt on a small
table beside the children's bed. Joan Kelley was half asleep in a
deep chair. A psalter had fallen out of her hand and lay on the
floor. Jane Dee picked it up and laid it lovingly on the girl's
lap. The children were sleeping very peacefully. Through the high
window fell a faint glimmer of moonshine.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The journey to Prague was decided on, Graf Laski
having found the means thereto and there being, besides, very
good hopes of an audience from the Emperor. The three
adventurers, who approached the same goal with such different
hopes and expectations, consulted together.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley was excited in a manner which it was impossible
for Dr. Dee, so well used to the company and kindness of the
great ones of the earth, to understand. The mathematician even
gently rebuked his tempestuous assistant, reminding him that they
were acting under Divine guidance and if they received, or no,
patronage from the Emperor, it would be at the angels' will. And
with a grave and anxious dignity, he reminded both the Polonian
prince and Edward Kelley that they had not undertaken this
strange quest for material advantages but in the highest interest
of transcendental philosophy and hermetic wisdom.</p>

<p>"It is not the base minerals and volatile chemicals that we
must seek to transmute," he said, "those are but symbols of the
transfiguration which must take place in ourselves, when, the
great secret being in our possession, we shall be as gods."</p>

<p>Graf Laski listened to this without much attention. He always
paid more heed to Edward Kelley than to the elder man, who so far
exceeded him in worth and reputation. He said:</p>

<p>"Although the Emperor will no doubt be greatly impressed by
the endeavours of John Dee to labour after the divine wisdom
which is to transmute mankind into a heavenly likeness, there is
no doubt that he is even more interested in the manufacture of
gold."</p>

<p>"Of that I know very little. I take it to be a secret that
will only be given us when the angels will. I cannot decipher the
book which Edward Kelley found in the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey,
and which contains, he supposes, the directions for the
projection of the red and white powder."</p>

<p>Graf Laski, looking keenly at Edward Kelley, remarked: "In
that the Emperor will be particularly interested. You know that
he is an adept himself and far advanced in hermetic law." And the
Count added, with a straight look at the young man: "It is
useless to attempt to deceive him, or to provoke his curiosity.
He has imprisoned several alchemists in the White Tower."</p>

<p>John Dee answered this remark:</p>

<p>"Why should we seek to deceive the Emperor, since we have been
divinely guided into his presence?" And he asked Laski, Palatine
of Siradia, what manner of man this Imperial Hapsburg was, who
dwelt lonely in Prague, the city of the alchemists, and gave, it
was said, a cloistered life up to many strange pursuits. Graf
Laski replied:</p>

<p>"He is very melancholy. He reads every strange book on which
he can lay his hands."</p>

<p>"I wonder," interrupted Dr. Dee with eager simplicity, "if he
has read my <i>Monas Hieroglyphica</i>, which I dedicated to his
father, Maximilian II."</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied Laski, with some impatience. "He knows
all the tongues, ancient and modern. He paints pictures, too,
with great cunning and works very delicately in iron. It is
difficult to see him, and very often difficult to understand what
he says, but I hope he may be favourable towards us."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee added with the same simplicity:</p>

<p>"I have had friendships from the Emperor Charles V. and his
brother, Ferdinand, and from this prince's father, and what to us
is the countenance of princes when the very heavens are opening
before us?"</p>

<p>Kelley and Laski exchanged shrewd glances which the
mathematician did not perceive, for he was wrapped in his own
mysticism which prevented much of earthly matters and common
affairs being apparent to him. The Pole began to discuss the
practical aspects of the journey to Prague&mdash;where they
should lodge, and through whom they should present their petition
to the Emperor.</p>

<p>The Poionian prince said he would send his secretary with a
letter from John Dee to the Spanish Ambassador, Don De Sancto
Clemente, and with it was to go a copy of the book which he had
just mentioned that he had dedicated to Rudolph's father,
Maximilian. Laski also thought that he would get Dr. Hageck to
lend his house by Bethlem in Old Prague (the Altstadt), which
would do very well for Dee and Kelley while they waited the
pleasure of the Emperor.</p>

<p>All this being decided upon, the Polonian prince turned
abruptly to Edward Kelley and asked him, with the air of one who
brings another to the point, to tell him the exact story of his
powders and the book, which hitherto the young man had skilfully
or sullenly evaded. And now, in his eager mood, for he seemed on
the very crest of the wave of good fortune and good humour,
Kelley began to relate, scarcely pausing for breath, the story of
how he had come by the powders and the book, by means of which he
had first sought an introduction to the household at
Mortlake.</p>

<p>He said he had had a reason to depart secretly into the Welsh
mountains where, under a name that was not his own, he lodged at
a lonely tavern which was near a high mountain and a great lake.
The innkeeper showed him the book which he said had come from the
ruins of Glastonbury Abbey, founded by St. Dunstan, where it had
been no doubt hidden by the last Abbot, who had been hanged by
the late King Henry.</p>

<p>"Though I could not read the book, my curiosity was inflamed,
for I perceived it to be full of mysteries. With the book had
been discovered two small ivory bottles, one containing a red,
and the other a white powder, These this wretched ignorant man
had given to hip children to play with, which they were doing on
the edge of the lake the day I heard this tale. The ivory wa: so
fine that by holding up the bottles to the light you might
perceive that one was pure white and the other flushed red. The
stoppers were firmly fixed and none of the precious powder had
been spilled.</p>

<p>"I gave twenty shillings to the man for the book and the
bottles and thought at once of Dr. Dee.</p>

<p>"I took them to him at his house at Mortlake and we have been
working together since."</p>

<p>"But without result?" asked Adelbert Laski. Before the
mathematician could answer, Edward Kelley replied:</p>

<p>"That I may not say. The time is not yet ripe. I labour
continually."</p>

<p>These words surprised Dr. Dee, for he was not aware that
Edward Kelley conducted any experiments by himself, nor indeed
did he know that his assistant had sufficient knowledge either of
chemistry or mysticism to undertake such sacred labours.</p>

<p>The Polonian prince bade Edward Kelley look very carefully to
his powders and his book. The Emperor was sure, he said, to ask
for a demonstration, and he repeated that the Hapsburg was not a
man to be easily deceived, for he had a great knowledge of these
affairs and had made many experiments himself, having on one
occasion it was believed, made gold, but only in a small
quantity, and after melting more ducats in the crucible than the
value of the ore which was finally produced. And he added that
Heinrich Khunrath, the celebrated doctor of Dresden and follower
of Paracelsus, had had many consultations with the Emperor on
this matter, but had displeased His Majesty by maintaining that
the true end and object of the alchemist was psychic and not
material.</p>

<p>"Then," added the prince, "there was Michael Maier, one of the
Emperor's physicians, who had been to England to seek with the
Kentish mystic, Robert Fludd. He was an adept and was supposed to
be searching for the Elixir of Life and the Philosopher's Stone.
But he concealed his knowledge behind much obscure symbolism, and
the Emperor, though he valued him as a doctor of medicine, has
long since given up hope that he will ever be able to manufacture
gold."</p>

<p>After listening to this, which seemed to be given as a
warning, John Dee said, with simple dignity:</p>

<p>"If this Emperor Rudolph is seeking for nothing but gold,
surely he will be disappointed in everything."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The two English crystal-gazers and the Polish
prince viewed the outline of Prague against the midsummer heavens
with something of the same ecstastic hope the pilgrims from this
world to the next might view the outline of the heavenly
Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The city of the alchemists lay amid woods rising on hills on
the bank of the Vlata. The towers of the churches and the watch
towers on the walls seemed innumerable; a gloomy power and a
secret might was expressed in the impressive outline of the
Ottokar and Hradcany towers which rose from the opulent
colourings of trees in the full leafage of August.</p>

<p>The town was very magnificent, but sombre and mysterious. Most
of the streets were narrow, dark and winding, and seemed, despite
the brilliance of the midsummer sun overhead, to remain in
perpetual shadow.</p>

<p>The house of Dr. Hageck in the Altstadt, which the physician
had generously lent to the two alchemists, was near the old
Rathhus with the splendid clocktower, and the Carolinum, the
university where John Huss had answered the summons of the
Emperor.</p>

<p>The alchemists found the house, which had been so generously
put at their disposal, greatly to their liking. It was small and
dark, but well kept and well furnished, and there was an
excellent study which had been, nearly a hundred years ago, the
abode of some mysterious alchemist who had been on the same quest
as themselves.</p>

<p>Simon, the name of this eager student, was set up in gold and
silver letters in different parts of the room. Over the door and
between the windows were long Latin inscriptions and cabalistic
hieroglyphs referring to the mystic search for the Philosopher's
Stone and the Elixir of Life. There was also among the familiar
paraphernalia, to which both the adepts were so used, of
furnaces, retorts and scales, many excellent carvings and
paintings of birds, fishes, flowers, uncouth monsters, and
strange imaginings.</p>

<p>In the highest spirits, Edward Kelley at once set up the
shewstone, placed the crystal in its frame on the seals and the
red cloth.</p>

<p>Madimi, who had grown from a lovely child into a beautiful
woman, at once appeared in the crystal and Dee asked her news of
his wife and children, left at Cracow, and the angel replied that
they were well and directed him to write to the Emperor
Rudolph.</p>

<p>This John Dee did. It was, perhaps, the happiest moment of the
alchemist's life, not only because he seemed so near the
attainment of a lifetime's stupendous hopes, but because of the
changed demeanour of Edward Kelley. He seemed to have thrown off
the evil spirits and to show a true penitence and a complete
conversion to things of light from things of darkness. The
long-suffering mathematician sincerely rejoiced. He loved the
wild young man like a son and through him, erring and human as he
was, did he feel most in touch with that countenance of God,
which he had so long sought.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">A week passed and there was no reply from the
Emperor. This did not in the least shake the confidence of John
Dee, but he was much disturbed by an ugly episode which forced
him to write in the margin of his diary:</p>

<p>"Satan is very busy about Edward Kelley at this time." One hot
evening while the astrologer was seated in his study with the
windows open, working instead of going down to supper, he was
surprised by a shout in the street and, looking down, saw the
city watchman, who warned him to keep better prudence in the
ordering of his household. The amazed mathematician, who had
heard nothing, peered from the window and saw, seated on a stone
at the corner of the street, the Palatine's servant, Alexander,
holding his head and groaning, as if he were greatly hurt.</p>

<p>At this Dr. Dee went down and found that the man had been
quarrelling with Edward Kelley and with young Simon, son of the
doctor who had lent them the house, and who had come unexpectedly
to Prague in the absence of his parents and who lodged with the
Englishmen.</p>

<p>The mathematician, standing in the hot street, endeavoured to
get the truth from the serving man, who told him this story:</p>

<p>Edward Kelley had bought a clock for five ducats from Simon.
There had been some dispute over this bargain, and it had ended
by the Englishman having to add a quarter of wine to the money.
On this, both he and Simon had become drunk and quarrelsome, and
when Alexander endeavoured to separate them, they had both set
upon him with many foul and evil terms.</p>

<p>"Here is a scandal which will damage me in all Prague and
maybe with the Emperor himself," said Dr. Dee sorrowfully. He was
the more shocked and disappointed as he had just been rejoicing
at the conversion of Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>With a heavy step, that showed something of his age, lie went
back to the house and there was the relapsed slayer lying drunk
on a bench within the door as he had once lain in the house at
Mortlake. And then John Dee saw for himself, as Jane, his wife,
had seen so long ago, the mangled ears exposed under the bright
hair and the untied black cap.</p>

<p>He went to his study much disturbed and prayed for help with
the bitterness of dismay, lest, after all, he might have been
cozened.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">When Edward Kelley recovered from his drunken
sleep he was in a raging fury that frightened all who beheld him.
In vain John Dee endeavoured to restrain him. Nothing would
content him but he most go after the Palatine's man and, seeing
him pass at this moment in the street, he rushed up and took a
stone and hurled it after him as if he had been a dog.</p>

<p>Struggling in the grip of the old man and Simon, the doctor's
son, Edward Kelley, like one indeed possessed, shrieked out:</p>

<p>"Send for your wife, Dr. Dee. She alone can lay this spirit.
Send for Jane Dee to come to Prague."</p>

<p>His face was distorted and foam hung on his lips while the
chords in his throat and on his forehead stood out most
painfully. He was only overcome by sheer force, and the outbreak
ended in a violent fit of hysteric sobbing.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee noted in his diary:</p>

<p>"The rage and fury were so great in words and gestures it
might plainly prove that the wicked enemy sought either Edward
Kelley's own destroying of himself or of me. This may suffice to
notify the mighty temptation and vehement working of the subtle
spiritual enemy, Satan, wherewith God suffered Edward Kelley to
be tempted and almost overcome, to my great grief, discomfort and
most great discredit if it should come to the Emperor's
understanding. I was in great doubt how God would take this
offence, and devised with myself how I might with honesty be
cleared from the shame and danger. At the least it would cross
all good hopes here with the Emperor for a time until God
redressed it."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">In the chamber of Simon the alchemist, with the
mystical gold letters on the wall, John Dee knelt and prayed
beside the unconscious body of Edward Kelley. The young man was
overcome by wine, or fury, or an infernal possession.</p>

<p>He had lain for hours since the scene with the Palatine's
servant; occasionally his limbs and his features twitched and he
cried out as if in torment. John Dee persuaded himself that he
could see the devil running up and down the inert body, prayers
seemed of no avail, though it was with a pure and sincere heart
that the mathematician sent up his petition.</p>

<p>The globe, a mere flash of hollow light, stood useless on the
shew-table. The furnace, which cost so much to light and to
maintain, was sinking out, for John Dee had sent away the youth
who blew the bellows. The Book of St. Dunstan and other learned
and mystic manuscripts were scattered indifferently on the table
by the high, tall, narrow window. Without his beloved assistant,
Dr. Dee could do nothing. He saw the golden gates shut in his
face as he was about to enter them; he saw the heavenly city
vanish as he was about to pass through the walls. He saw the
vision which had been secured to him by a heavenly promise,
suddenly vanish.</p>

<p>He was left old and poor and hopeless, kneeling in the hot,
midsummer twilight beside the body of a drunken man.</p>

<p>There were no angels then in the alchemist's chamber and
little hope in his heart. His very prayers returned heavily upon
him, as he had noticed sometimes vapours from the crucible
returned, rising a little way but to sink down to earth again and
vanish. He felt that Satan and his crew had triumphed and the
dark, spired, mysterious and secret city of the alchemists was
crowded about him like prison walls.</p>

<p>He lifted the sweat-damped curls from the young man's hollow
cheeks and looked at the torn ears. How often had he seen this
hideous disfigurement in some low gutter rogue!</p>

<p>He thought of the wild story that Edward Kelley had recently
told of his sojourn in the Welsh mountains, what lay behind it,
or could the story be believed at all? The old man's faith was
not yet shaken. He could not bring himself to distrust the
angelic voices. It had been too much of an ecstastic happiness to
believe in them. Nor could he bring himself to distrust Edward
Kelley, for he loved him. Yet into this double belief which was
both noble and simple, there crept for the first time, a thread
of doubt. And the old man checked his prayers to ask himself: "If
I have been cozened what would there be to live for?"</p>

<p>The young man rose, poising himself on his elbow. He lay
stretched on cushions arranged on three chairs. Alexander, Graf
Laski's man, and Simon the doctor's son, had brought him
laboriously up the narrow stairs; their rage against the
turbulent foreigner had sunk, for they were convinced that he was
possessed by devils.</p>

<p>Kelley, thus raised on his elbow, stared at John Dee with his
pale eyes as if he did not know him. The mathematician's glance
was all love and kindness. Although this lapse on the part of his
assistant had struck down both his heavenly and his earthly
hopes, no blame nor reproach was in his heart.</p>

<p>"You watch by me? You pray by me?" asked Edward Kelley,
curiously. "You, on your kness by me!"</p>

<p>"The evil ones triumphed and the spirits entered into you,"
said the old man simply. "Are they gone, Edward Kelley? Are you
again free?"</p>

<p>The young man replied sullenly:</p>

<p>"I do not know. My head aches, ay, and my heart also. I would
I were at home again. I do not like Prague."</p>

<p>"I have comfortable letters from England," said Dee quietly.
"The Queen holds me in her remembrance. She writes of me kindly.
Walsingham and Burleigh remain my friends. They are all eager for
our return."</p>

<p>"For our return! For yours, you mean." Edward Kelley gave his
strange, wild smile. "Do not think there is anyone in England who
would welcome me home."</p>

<p>He sat up and began to laugh, clasping his beautiful hands
round his lean knees and hunching his shoulders up to his mangled
ears. He looked like a devil in that moment, but the old
mathematician was not in the least awe of him. It was to him as
if he looked at a crystal vase and saw in it a fair and angelic
form held down by a devil. So he saw Edward Kelley, his body the
vase and within it the two creatures, good and evil, struggling
for supremacy. He said tenderly, speaking to that soul which the
devil then held:</p>

<p>"Edward Kelley, is it true that you fled from England because
you feared a prison? That you urged this journey on Graf Laski,
the Palatine, and on me to escape punishment for some crime? Do
you remember the evening when Roger Cook was flung out of my
house at Mortlake? He had said evil things of you. Were they
true?"</p>

<p>"Could you believe them?" asked Kelley with a grin. "Could you
see me digging up a corpse at midnight or standing in the pillory
at Leicester? Could you see me forging and coining?"</p>

<p>"God knows, you have great skill of hand. Your penmanship is
wonderful."</p>

<p>"I will skry no more. I will not gaze in the crystal. I do not
believe in any of the angels."</p>

<p>"Edward Kelley, how often have you repented? How often have
you broken your promises to the angels, to me and to God."</p>

<p>"I am a poor, sinful man," said the skryer sullenly. He rose
from the chair and went to the window. The twilight was thick in
the narrow streets of Prague. High above the tall houses a few
stars sparkled. The heat was intense.</p>

<p>The patient and long-suffering old man rose stiffly from his
knees. His ageing limbs often ached after his long exercise at
prayer.</p>

<p>"Has the Emperor written?" asked Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;though through the Spanish Ambassador he very
courteously acknowledged the book I sent. He said that he would
read it."</p>

<p>"What use is that to us?" said the young man bitterly.</p>

<p>And John Dee could not refrain from replying, though in no
tone of rebuke:</p>

<p>"Maybe his Imperial Majesty would have sent for us, Edward
Kelley, had you not made this disgraceful brawling in the streets
so that it attracted the attention even of the city
watchman."</p>

<p>To this the young man replied scornfully:</p>

<p>"If the Emperor is an adept he must believe in devils as well
as in angels, and he knews that one is often as powerful as
another. Therefore it should not surprise him if the forces of
Satan sometimes get hold of me."</p>

<p>He threw the window open and, muttering how close and airless
the city was, thrust out his head and peered up and down the
street as if expecting someone. Then he looked back into the room
again and said in his wildest, most inspired tones:</p>

<p>"But fear nothing, John Dee. The Emperor will send for us
soon. The angels have said it." Then he added on a note of sudden
harsh authority: "Have you obeyed their other commands?"</p>

<p>"And what was that, Edward Kelley?"</p>

<p>"Did they not tell you to send to Cracow for Jane Dee?"</p>

<p>"I see no purpose in that," replied the mathematician gently.
"I have heard from the women, and they are very well. And here we
are well, too. It would lead to nothing but trouble and
expense."</p>

<p>"Send for her, I say," cried Edward Kelley, stamping his
foot.</p>

<p>"And for your wife?" asked the old man without guile.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley laughed wildly.</p>

<p>"For my wife! Leave her where she is. You know that I abhor
her." And he added violently: "I must have been beguiled by Satan
when I married a barren woman!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee and Joan Kelley lived in a peaceful
monotony at Cracow. The children and the house claimed all their
time. They could not afford many servants; the ways of the
country were still strange to them and though they had a small
supply of money, they were greatly concerned as to how long this
might have to last them, and so they lived meagrely, and spent as
little as they could, though all of them were very shabby, and
the women had no jewels, not as much as a silver ring between the
two of them.</p>

<p>Jane Dee no longer tried to force the confidence of Edward
Kelley's wife. She knew now that the girl had nothing to tell
her. The young man had come to Chipping Norton in the same way
that he had come to Mortlake. One day a knock on the door and he
was there, never more to be forgotten or refused.</p>

<p>The summer was very hot, and there was talk of plague in the
city. The two women watched and guarded the children jealously.
Jane Dee was much touched by the strange girl's devotion.</p>

<p>She gave a constant and an unremitting care to these children,
who were none of her own kin. Arthur, who began to do his lessons
from a horn book his father had left him before the journey to
Prague, loved her.</p>

<p>"Would it not be strange," mused Joan Kelley, wistfully, "if
one of us were to die in this foreign land? And I think that it
very well might be I," she added, without regret or misery.
"Surely there is no use for me in the world, for I have no
children and am hated by my husband."</p>

<p>Jane Dee wanted to comfort her, but could not approach this
gentle reserve. She wondered what the girl knew of the
understanding there was between Edward Kelley and herself. She
despised herself, and her blood burned in shame, yet she was
happy at this secret joy.</p>

<p>She thought: "If he is a devil or inspired by devils, then I
am damned, yet I do not regret it, though life is short and one
is in Hell for so long."</p>

<p>A letter came from John Dee, begging them to come at once to
Prague. Jane read it aloud by the last light of day as the two
tired women were combing their hair before they went to their
beds.</p>

<p>"Though this is costly and inconvenient, the angels have
directed it. You are to help in saving the soul of Edward
Kelley."</p>

<p>There was no message for the slighted wife.</p>

<p>Jane Dee put the letter in her bosom and made preparations for
the journey; she had known that such a summons would come; she
was very tender with the children and with Joan.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The day that John Dee received the letter from
his wife to say that she had started on the journey to Prague, he
received a summons to visit the Emperor. This excited the
Palatine as much as if their fortunes were already made. He began
to talk of what he would do when the Emperor's patronage was
assured&mdash;how he would redeem his estates at Kesmark and
Lask, and, attaching himself to His Imperial Majesty, keep great
state at Prague, his ultimate design still being the Crown of
Poland.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley looked at him rather scornfully. As soon as he
had known of the summons to the Hradcany he took what little was
left of the money that Laski had given Dee and went out into the
town and bought himself a suit of clothes, well cut and
fashionable, such as he considered suitable for a court.</p>

<p>The others had no such preparations to make; the Palatine was
always richly dressed and John Dee never changed his sober, black
clothes, now often pressed and darned, which he had brought with
him from England.</p>

<p>While they awaited the return of Edward Kelley from his
frivolous errand, Adelbert Laski told John Dee that he himself
had been present when the Emperor had made some experiments in
the presence of his mine-master, when he had converted three
pounds of mercury into gold with one grain of some powder which
had been enclosed in gum and put into the wax of a taper which
was lighted and then placed at the bottom of a crucible. It was
the Emperor himself who made these experiments. He poured four
ounces of quicksilver on the wax and put the whole into a fire of
charcoal. They then began blowing, the three of them with
separate bellows. In about half an hour, on removing the charcoal
they found the melted gold was over-red, the colour itself being
green. The mine-master then said it was necessary to put some
silver into the mixture, which the Emperor did, taking the coins
out of his pocket. The whole then poured out in perfect fusion
into an ingot which was very fine gold. On melting it again it
became very soft. The master of the mines said it was more than
twenty-four carats.</p>

<p>The sequel of this story was dismal. The mine-master had no
more than this one grain of powder, which had been given him by
an anonymous adept who he had met by chance in the mountains. He
had had several ounces of the powder but had been robbed by
highwaymen who had taken all from him except this one grain,
which he had been able to conceal under his finger-nail.</p>

<p>The success of the experiment had, however, greatly exalted
and encouraged the Emperor. No doubt the memory of it would
contribute to the favourable reception which (Graf Laski hoped)
he would give to the English alchemists.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The Palatine of Siradia and the two crystal
gazers waited in the guard-room of the palace.</p>

<p>This was a high and gloomy structure, seemingly very little
inhabited, save by soldiers and there were but few of them, drawn
together in groups, standing in dark alcoves or posted as
sentries outside the high doors. It was very silent, only a
whisper now and then broke the sombre stillness.</p>

<p>John Dee, used to the gay palaces of England, thought this
seemed more like a prison than a royal residence, and a chill
seemed to come upon Edward Kelley's volatile spirit. But Laski,
to whom the place was familiar, was confident.</p>

<p>He sent a message to the Lord Chamberlain, Octavius Spinola,
to announce that they awaited the Emperor's pleasure in the
ante-room of the north wing where His Majesty resided.</p>

<p>After only a very short delay, this nobleman came out himself
into the guard-chamber and went very courteously up to Dr. Dee
and said that the Emperor would see him and him alone, since the
summons had been neither for Edward Kelley nor for the
Palatine&mdash;only for the English adept, with whose great fame
and wisdom the Emperor had long been acquainted. And, thereupon,
taking no heed of the scowl of Kelley or the discomfort of Laski,
Spinola very pleasantly took John Dee by the sleeve and led him
through the dining hall to the Privy Chamber and there, pushing
him gently through the door, closed it behind him and left him
alone with the occupant of this small room, who was a man who sat
at a round table of mother o' pearl under a high-set window.</p>

<p>The chamber was circular and full of shadows. It was lit only
by a broad shaft of light which fell from this north-placed
window. There were shelves all round the wall on which were large
caskets with seals attached. The man at the table had a great
chest and standish of silver in front of him, and a pile of books
on which he rested his elbow, sinking his chin in his hand.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a shabby black suit, much like that worn by
Dr. John Dee himself, and the English mathematician knew that he
was in the presence of the Imperial Cesar.</p>

<p>Rudolph of Hapsburg smiled without speaking, and regarded the
mathematician keenly with his very curious glance. His remarkable
face had an expression that John Dee had never seen on a human
countenance before, save, perhaps, sometimes, and then for a
second only, on the distorted visage of Edward Kelley when he was
in one of his furies or trances.</p>

<p>The Emperor was very fair; his wide lids came half-over his
prominent blue eyes, so that he seemed to be drowsing into a
sleep. Yet the glance under the thick white lashes was very
fierce and gleaming. His nose was high, his face long, his
complexion very pale, and his expression of half-drugged
imbecility was emphasised by his full, parted lips and underhung
jaw, so characteristic of his illustrious House.</p>

<p>If John Dee had not known of the Emperor's wisdom, of the
profoundity of his studies and the extent of his knowledge and
that he was the anointed Caesar, he would have thought himself in
the presence of something at once base and evil. Even as it was,
and firmly as he was entrenched in his belief and the divinity of
his mission, the mathematician was slightly confounded by the
fixidity of the Emperor's stare, the unchanging blank expression
on the pallid face of this man sitting behind the large silver
casket, with his elbow on the pile of books.</p>

<p>John Dee made his reverence and waited for the illustrious
prince to speak. But Rudolph remained so still that it seemed to
Dee, accustomed to English vivacity, that he might be facing a
waxwork. Then, slowly and deliberately, the Emperor beckoned him
forward with his long, white finger, and when John Dee approached
said, in English, and in a low voice, without altering his
expression in the least:</p>

<p>"Can you make gold?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied John Dee, in all the pure courage of his
veracity and sincere faith, "that is the least of the things of
which I have come to speak to your Majesty."</p>

<p>"It would be enough for me," replied Rudolph. He then took Dr.
Dee's book from among the pile of those near him and politely
thanked him for it, saying, however, that it was too hard for his
capacity. Then his broad lids drooped, as if he were unutterably
weary, quite full over his eyes, and he said in a dead voice:</p>

<p>"Why did you come to Prague?" Adding: "Say on&mdash;all that
is in your mind."</p>

<p>His tone, his manner and his looks again reminded John Dee of
the tone, look and manner of Edward Kelley when he was in one of
his trances or possessions.</p>

<p>"For more than forty years I have sought, but not found,
wisdom in men and books. Then God was graciously pleased to send
me his light, Uriel, who, for two and a half years with other
spirits, has taught me and finished my book for me and brought me
a stone of more value than any earthly kingdom."</p>

<p>John Dee gave the story of his life at great length and
Rudolph remained as if asleep or drugged, until the stone was
mentioned, and then he slowly lifted his lids a little and asked
if it were the Philosopher's Stone, and where it might be?</p>

<p>"It is at the house of Dr. Hageck, who has kindly allowed me
lodgings. The experiments are not yet Finished, but I have good
hope."</p>

<p>"Always the same story," replied Rudolph, in an expressionless
voice. "I have been many times deceived."</p>

<p>"Of what use is gold to your Majesty compared to heavenly
wisdom? I have a message to you from Uriel. He bade me tell you
to turn from your sins and look to God."</p>

<p>"Ha!" said Rudolph, without moving.</p>

<p>John Dee added:</p>

<p>"I am to show you the holy visions. My commission is from God.
I feign nothing, neither am I a hypocrite, an ambitious man, or
doting or dreaming in this cause. If I speak otherwise than I
have just reason, I forsake my salvation."</p>

<p>This was checked by the Emperor saying suddenly:</p>

<p>"I will send some one to your house to examine the stone. Have
you made experiments with mercury, with sulphur, with
magnesia?"</p>

<p>"Sire, the stone is none of these, but something which the
angel Uriel gave my assistant, Edward Kelley."</p>

<p>Rudolph's long, sensitive fingers suddenly and lightly rested
on Dr. Dee's sleeve, and he gave a displeasing smile, which
showed the deformity of his curious jaw.</p>

<p>"The stone, the stone," he said. "Have you made a projection
with it?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. The angels say' that the time is not ripe. And as
for the stone, Uriel gave it to Edward Kelley. I have not yet
seen it."</p>

<p>Rudolph blinked, his smile twitched into a grimace.</p>

<p>"I will send you Dr. Curtius of the Privy Council, a wise,
learned and faithful councillor. He will listen to you on my
behalf."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will not see the heavenly visions?"</p>

<p>"Another time," said Rudolph, "another time."</p>

<p>He waved his hand in dismissal, sunk back in his chair, his
lids drooped over his eyes as if he were already in a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>John Dee took his departure. The Hradcany was full of shadows,
of winding stairs, of locked doors. The idle soldiers stared from
under their plumed hats as the Englishman passed.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">When Edward Kelley learnt the result of his
companion's interview with the Emperor, which was not told him
until both had returned to the house near the university, he
burst into a great fury and cried out against all&mdash;angels
and human beings&mdash;who had alike, he declared, cozened
them.</p>

<p>"Do you not see they do not care for heavenly wisdom or
angelic visions? They wish for nothing but gold. These visits of
the spirits bring us no profit, and I, for one, will skry no
more."</p>

<p>As John Dee was about to protest bitterly against this
blasphemy he added with a deeper scorn than he had yet allowed
himself to show towards the mathematician:</p>

<p>"Do you not see that that is all that any of them care about?
What does this Laski want but gold? What does the Emperor want
but gold? What does anyone to whom we may go want but gold? Leave
off, then, these vain communications with the spirits, these
delvings into these symbols and mysteries that have no
explanation and let us indeed see if we cannot make that which is
every man's desire."</p>

<p>John Dee began to plead with the angry young man who
interrupted him contemptuously and said:</p>

<p>"Take your servant, John Crocker, or take your boy Arthur,
when his mother brings him to Prague and let either of them look
into the crystal and interpret the spirits. As for me, I am done
with it."</p>

<p>He used now a different tone from any he had employed before;
he seemed not to be in a trance or frenzy, but a worldly man
speaking plain sense. Dr. Dee's heart was chilled within him. He
felt that life would be impossible without the daily visits of
the angels, but to all his entreaties Edward Kelley replied
rudely with the vexation of a man labouring under a vast
disappointment.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The next event proved Edward Kelley to be right
in his doubts of the Emperor's friendship or patronage. Dr.
Curtius came several times to the house near the university and
had long conversations with Dr. Dee. There were messages of
friendship and goodwill from Rudolph, but these, like the Queen
of England's promises, and those of Graf Laski, proved
delusive.</p>

<p>When Jane Dee arrived in Prague she found the household
unsettled and distraught.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley had constructed a laboratory for himself and was
privately, Dr. Dee feared, making experiments with the red and
white powder out of the ivory bottles and the stone given him by
Uriel, and endeavouring, all unlearned as he was, to himself
decipher the Glastonbury book. While it had been reluctantly
forced on the understanding of Dr. John Dee that Dr. Curtius and
his master cared nothing for the angels, but very much for the
possibilities of the stone of which the Englishman had spoken to
Rudolph.</p>

<p>This stone Dr. Dee could not even get hold of, for Kelley kept
it concealed. Graf Laski also seemed disappointed at the result
of the visit to the Emperor and to have lost much faith in the
two crystal gazers. He gave them no more money; he seemed to take
no more interest in the affair.</p>

<p>Kelley would only leave his laboratory to talk of starting for
England at once. He would have to sell his clothes, he said, to
pay for the journey.</p>

<p>"Uriel makes promises," he declared wildly, "but when will he
give us meat, drink and clothing?"</p>

<p>The Spanish Ambassador, however, himself a descendant of
Raymond Lull, had shown himself friendly. He had often invited
Dr. Dee to dine at his table, and had told him to take no heed of
the jealousies of the courtiers who stood between him and
Rudolph.</p>

<p>But nothing had come of this advice and they were brought to
great penury which was augmented by the arrival of the two women,
the children and the servants from Cracow.</p>

<p>So it was heavy news that John Dee had to tell his wife. He
had also been slandered and called at the Spanish Ambassador's
table "a bankrupt alchemist," a "conjurer" and a "necromancer,"
who had beguiled Laski, and now, was endeavouring to deceive the
Emperor.</p>

<p>Even Dr. Curtius, who had shown himself a friend to the
Englishman, was obliged to confess that the reports of the
visions (which, by Dee's express wish, he had put before the
Emperor) Rudolph regarded as either incredible or impossible.</p>

<p>Rudolph would not even see the glass which Dee had invented
for making observations on a dark night, nor his inventions
connected with the quadrant and astronomical tables which he
explained to Dr. Curtius and wished to take to the Palace.</p>

<p>"It is the doubting spirit of Kelley which hinders us," said
Dee sadly from among these broken hopes and fading dreams.</p>

<p>His wife answered nothing, but pressed his hand and kissed his
cheek, and thought how old he looked, more like her father than
her husband.</p>

<p>She went up very sadly with a heavy step to the little room
which had been set apart for her. Her health was poor&mdash;she
had suffered much from the fatigue of the journey.</p>

<p>She had hardly sunk in a chair by the window, and rested her
aching head against the mullion, when Edward Kelley broke into
the room, with no regard for her privacy and throwing himself on
his knees by her side, wept in her lap. She caressed his hair as
if he were a tired child.</p>

<p>"Why did you send for me?" Jane asked gently. "Can I save you
from your delusions or your wicked hopes, or your
deceptions?"</p>

<p>He pressed his face against her knee and looked up at her with
his pale eyes full of a vague expectancy.</p>

<p>"You do not believe any of my magic, Jane Dec, and yet you had
to come."</p>

<p>"I was summoned by my husband," she said, but she knew that he
would not heed this evasion.</p>

<p>"You do not understand me." His slight body drooped as if he
were greatly fatigued and his voice was tired. "I am nearer the
goal than he is, with all his wisdom. I shall yet attain
something."</p>

<p>Jane leant back against the old faded chair and still allowed
the young man to rest his head against her knee. Her face was
full of a placid and serene grace, and her fatigue had given her
an earthly look of pallor and resignation. She wished to fall
asleep and dream, yet all her thoughts were clear as pure water.
She could see all the events that, to an outsider, might seem
like episodes in chaos, which had bound her to Edward Kelley,
jointly connected, like buds branching from one stem&mdash;his
coming to Mortlake and his cozening of her husband, the arrival
of Laski and their setting out on this wild quest; the travelling
from one strange city to another and the deep winter in the
outlandish country, and her struggles against her fate, and yet
her bittersweet enjoyment of that same fate, his wife, always
like a shadow, silent, but not reproachful, at her side, and now
this, the two of them together, broken by a common sorrow in the
strange room of the house that belonged to neither of them in the
dark city of the alchemists.</p>

<p>Her breath came in short pants through her half-open mouth,
and her long lashes made a shadow on her thin cheeks. She said,
in a drowsy voice:</p>

<p>"What thoughts have you brought here with you?"</p>

<p>And he answered:</p>

<p>"You know all my thoughts, Jane Dee, and knew them from the
first."</p>

<p>She said heavily, as if making an effort over her senses, an
effort that was against her own secret will:</p>

<p>"I have the little children to think of, and your wife, and
the good old man, and the servants. Somehow we ought to save
them. Soon we shall have no money, even for food or drink."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley rose suddenly, as if strength had been slid into
him, like wine poured suddenly into a cup.</p>

<p>"I will make the fortunes of all of you," he declared. "The
Emperor shall become our patron and we will enjoy riches,
luxuries without end."</p>

<p>His face was distorted in the shadows, which lay thickly over
him, one upon another, little shadows of common things.</p>

<p>"I will give you, within a fortnight, a gold chain of a fine
design set with rubies."</p>

<p>Jane Dee shook her head.</p>

<p>"It is long since I have worn any ornaments and still longer
since I ceased to desire any," she smiled, "and you know that
these luxuries, honours, pomps and parades are not what my
husband came so far to seek." She rose wearily. "But a little
money we must have."</p>

<p>"You shall have more than a little money, Jane Dee."</p>

<p>"When you try to delude me, Edward Kelley, we are very far
apart. You know that I do not believe in your angels, nor in your
powers." And she looked at him candidly, but with much sweetness,
fully expecting a complete confession.</p>

<p>The young man shook his head sullenly:</p>

<p>"You do not know me as well as you think you do, Jane Dee. It
is true that I do juggle with stars and planets, that I hold in
my hand secrets that the common man cannot begin to comprehend.
It is true that I am sometimes confused by the fumes of the
mysteries that I seek to penetrate."</p>

<p>She interrupted him, speaking gently and with much
patience:</p>

<p>"It is true, also, Mr. Kelley, that you are a rogue and a
vagabond and have stood in the pillory. You have been in prison
for crimes both vile and petty."</p>

<p>The young man answered quietly:</p>

<p>"Yet it is true, is it not, that you have a deep faith in me
beyond all that? You have never denounced me, but always in your
heart you have taken my part. Is it that you cannot help loving
me, Jane Dee?"</p>

<p>She did not answer; she did not seem to hear. She stood
drooping, with her hand on the doorknob, and he added with a wild
accent:</p>

<p>"Sinful as I am, lost as you suppose me, you cannot help a
bitter anxiety for my wretched person, for my damned soul."</p>

<p>Jane Dee shook her head without replying, or even looking at
the speaker. She was now so merged in the shadows that he could
only see a faint, misty whiteness where her face was, but his
talk was intimate and confident as if they stood heart to
heart.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have loved me in spite of everything, and I shall
always remember that. I shall not be ungrateful." She spoke
then:</p>

<p>"Have you such a blind confidence in me that you are sure that
I shall not betray you?"</p>

<p>With a sudden subtle and bitter irony, as if he disliked her,
Edward Kelley replied:</p>

<p>"I have full confidence in myself and that is sufficient. I
shall obtain more than you imagine is possible, Jane Dee. Nothing
I have set my mind on can escape me."</p>

<p>"I am not frightened of you," said Jane Dee&mdash;"least of
all when you threaten."</p>

<p>She left the room and went slowly down the dark stairs. She
felt the exhausted repose of one whose life has reached a climax;
all familiar things looked dim and strange to her. She began to
count over how many houses she had dwelt in since she had left
Mortlake. They would have to leave this one soon, she knew. Dr.
Hageck could lend it them no longer. Where would the money come
from to pay for the hire of another?</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">John Dee, to his surprise, was summoned again,
through the intervention of the Palatine, as he supposed, to the
Castle on the Hradcany. His worldly affairs were then at a pinch
which disturbed him, armoured as he was by his mystic transports
against most earthly vicissitudes. The angelic hosts, in whom he
most fervently believed, were trying his patience to the utmost.
Edward Kelley had shown again his doubting spirit, and had
affected to treat with the utmost scorn the last communication
made by the angels. He had shown a restless impatience at taking
any sittings at all and continually urged the mathematician to
endeavour to discover another slayer, telling him again to take
John Crocker, his boy, or Arthur, his little son, and he had
evaded the promise so often made to Dr. Dee that he would soon
take the Sacrament.</p>

<p>The English adventurers had had to hire a house close to the
market place in Old Prague. This was rented at seventy thalers a
year. Dr. Dee, as he made his way to the Hradcany, wondered where
he was going to get this money. Adelbert Laski had not given him
any gifts or fees, or mentioned expenses for some time, and
already the English adventurers had been forced to sell some of
the goods which they had brought from Cracow, parting with some
of the good English blankets and beautifully-made instruments
that Dr. Dee had, with such trouble and expense, brought from
England.</p>

<p>News from home, too, had been unsatisfactory. The viler
inhabitants of Mortlake had raided his house, and, as far as he
could understand, had destroyed much of value, a thought from
which John Dee had to turn his mind, for it made him sick with
anguish. His Midland rectories brought him in no money, for
during his absence the rents had not been paid.</p>

<p>He nervously fingered the edges of his worn gown as he made
his way through the dark, short and narrow streets that broke in,
one on another, like the segments of a puzzle. Had he followed
what appeared to be a heavenly light, but was merely a false
flare leading him to a bog or quagmire? And the horrible little
doubt of Kelley again pierced his trusting mind, yet he could not
believe that God would so far deceive him and suffer him to be
entirely shamed. His confidence was in his own purity of
intention. He knew, as no other man could know, his own absolute
integrity.</p>

<p>His material burden had lately been added to. His son Michael
had been born as soon as they removed to the new house by the
market place. He had been baptised with some parade by the Court
chaplain in the great Cathedral of St. Vitus, with the Spanish
Ambassador for godfather. But despite these honours, Jane was put
to it to find linen for the infant.</p>

<p>There were now four children to provide for, and that very
morning, just before the summons to the Emperor had come, Jane,
lying still and pale in her bed, had simply entreated her husband
to make some provision for meat and drink for the family.</p>

<p>"I think," she had whispered, "that if we fall into extreme
and open poverty, that actions whereby you, sweetheart, are vowed
and linked with the heavenly majesty, will be discredited."</p>

<p>And she had patiently reminded him that they had pawned to the
Jews all that they could in decency spare, and that there was
nothing left to part with but their very clothes and the vessels
from which they ate and drank. She had told him how she had heard
from the very servants whom they had hired, from the Palatine,
that the whole city was full of malicious slanders and ugly
rumours against them.</p>

<p>In his bewilderment and distress, Dr. Dee had taken poor
Jane's petition to Edward Kelley, who was sitting in the room he
had fitted up as a study, with the shewtable before him. Yet he
was not gazing into the crystal, but reading in the Glastonbury
book, or rather endeavouring to decipher the curious diagrams and
characters therein.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee, with grave dignity, put the case before him.</p>

<p>Neither their honour nor their fair fame would suffer them to
remain much longer in such straits, he had said, and Edward
Kelley had given him a squinting glance, and closed the book with
a snap and risen impatiently.</p>

<p>"Tell Jane Dee the spirits say she is only a woman, full of
infirmities, frail in soul. Bid her be faithful and obedient as
she is yoked. She and her children shall be cared for." And he
had flung away into the inner room which he had fitted up as a
laboratory and in which he often worked alone, turning the key on
the inside so that Dr. Dee could not enter.</p>

<p>The mathematician had sorrowfully gone downstairs and indited
a letter to the Queen and his friends at home, and this had
scarcely been sealed when there had come the summons from the
Emperor. So it was with a little more hope that the old man made
his way through the close and winding streets. Again and again he
looked up to where the gloomy turrets of the towers pierced the
waning summer blue, and were outlined darkly against the great
fleet of swift clouds which rose impetuously into the upper air.
How many of these towers there were! From a distance the town lay
on the great plain like a monstrous crown, with many jewels and
points.</p>

<p>On the summit of all these towers were leaden figures, of
cocks, or warriors, or haloed saints or maidens, and from these
flashed dazzling sparkles of light as the sun cast lovely beams
from under the thick, dense, curdling vapours.</p>

<p>When he reached the Hradcany, Dr. Dee found that he had
arrived before his time, and that the Lord Chancellor, who had
sent the summons, was not yet ready to receive him, so he went
down into the famous Hall of Vladislav, which had been much
neglected by the present Emperor, and was used as a common
meeting place or exchange for traders and business men.</p>

<p>This high, vaulted building, with the low, small windows, was
gloomy and sombre, and Dr. Dee felt ill at ease among so many
foreigners, most of whom gave him evil looks and nudged each
other and glanced at him over their shoulders, or conversed
openly about him in their various dialects, of which he could not
understand much. And his heart became heavier as he realised how
much jealousy there was against him, and how hard it would be for
him to find any place at the Emperor's Court. Indeed, the Spanish
Ambassador had already warned him of this difficulty.</p>

<p>He was sad, too, that this noble hall (the like of which was
scarce in Europe, so long, high and broad it was and yet without
pillars), which had been built for a coronation and for Bohemian
nobles to do homage to their sovereign in, should be put to these
mean uses&mdash;for base traders to haggle with no more restraint
than they did in Chepe, or the alleys round St. Paul.</p>

<p>So he returned to the north wing of the Palace, where the
Emperor lived, passing through the Spanish and German Halls,
which contained the incomparable rarities collected from all
distant parts of the globe, and waited in the guard-chamber until
he was sent for. The soldiers eyed him gloomily; he was conscious
here, as he had been in the Halls of Vladislav, of much
hostility.</p>

<p>Spinala came courteously as before and conducted him into the
presence of the Emperor, but not, this time, into the closet
where he had formerly stood before Rudolph, but into a
magnificent laboratory such as John Dee had never hoped to see in
all his life. This was the first of a series of workshops which
the Emperor had constructed at considerable cost.</p>

<p>This Hapsburg cared nothing for politics, nor for the various
struggles and convulsions that distracted his unwieldy dominions,
nor for the intrigues of his brothers Matthias and Ernest. He
lived in a world apart, occupying himself solely with science,
art and magic. It was told of him that once, on the occasion of a
riot in the streets of Prague, he had himself thrust his head out
of one of the workshop windows which overlooked the narrow
streets and bade the fellows below cease rioting, for they
disturbed him at his labours.</p>

<p>This room into which John Dee was led had a high light, part
of the roof being glassed over, so that it seemed as if the
ever-changing clouds came into the chamber, and the light was
therefore cold and shadowless from morn to eve. Fair-haired
German boys, in the royal liveries of black and silver with
double-headed eagles on their coats, were on their knees, blowing
patiently at long bellows which kept at an even ternperatare
fires in two huge brick furnaces, over which stood, or were
suspended, shining vessels of brass, copper and iron. The walls
were painted or carved with mystic symbols, many of which were
unknown even to Dr. Dee, and on long shelves stood retorts and
limbecks, like monstrous bubbles which caught the light in faint
gleams of blue and green. In jars, on which were written curious
signs, were chemicals and compounds, dried leaves and roots; in
tall bottles were oils, some pure, some stained, and, on a side
table nearest the light, was an elaborate apparatus for
distillation, crucibles, dyes, pigments and an alabaster tray
full of mercury, held to be, by so many adepts, the male parent
of gold.</p>

<p>Rudolph sat near this table which was in a projecting
windowplace, so that lie and it were glassed all round and the
flying clouds encompassed them. They were high up above the city
which could be seen far below them, like a painting in little,
enclosed in the scroll of an initial letter of an old manuscript.
Rudolph wore a stained apron over a ragged doublet, over his
breast a bright steel collar of the Golden Fleece. He held in his
long hand a saucer, in which some compound was dissolving. The
faint fumes of this faded into the air before his face, obscuring
his features with a light vapour. He stared at the Englishman as
if he did not recognise him, so John Dee, who had entered the
laboratory alone, was obliged to present hinrelf and his claims
again to the notice of His Imperial Majesty.</p>

<p>Rudolph listened in silence; his lids were lower, and his full
mouth was convulsed by a barely perceptible twitching. There was
a pause in which Dr. Dee waited patiently.</p>

<p>"Can you make gold?" demanded the Emperor suddenly.</p>

<p>"Sire, when I last had the honour of seeing your Majesty, I
told you that I had not made any experiments as regards that
mystery," replied Dr. Dee sadly. "Rather have I toiled after
heavenly wisdom, beside the attainment of which the making of
gold is as nothing."</p>

<p>"Will heavenly wisdom build you great palaces and monstrous
forts?" asked Rudolph. "Will it paint you pictures and carve you
statues? Have you seen those beautiful paintings which I have
brought from Italy, or my curios and rarities? They were all
bought by gold."</p>

<p>He passed to the table and put down the saucer that he held
and raised the alabaster dish with the quicksilver, looking with
gloating eyes as the marvellous substance divided, sub-divided,
and then ran together again. It was stuck with grains of gold.
Rudolph took up a fine square of white silk, poured in the
mercury, and then squeezed it, so that the mercury fell on to the
alabaster dish and left the grains of gold in the handkerchief.
He showed this to Dr. Dee and gave a low, cunning laugh.</p>

<p>"There is gold."</p>

<p>"Has Your Majesty come on the secret of transmutation of
metals?"</p>

<p>The Emperor shook his head, and his long, ragged, fair locks
fell forward, almost obscuring his face.</p>

<p>"I have had a good many impostors before me," he replied, "and
I have lodged them all in the White Tower, and when torture was
applied to them, it was very evident that they did not know how
to make gold." He put one of his long, white fingers on John
Dee's worn doublet.</p>

<p>"Would a turn or two of the rack or the pulley force your
secret out of you?" he demanded. Under the broad, white, drooping
lids his eyes flamed. "Old man, if you have a secret, why do you
not disclose it, and if you have none, why do you come to
me?"</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Majesty has misunderstood me," replied John Dee
with dignity. "I have explained my mission and my desires to Dr.
Curtius."</p>

<p>"Curtius, Curtius," muttered Rudolph. "He does not know what
he is talking about. Edward Kelley, now, your companion, Curtius
told me he could make gold, that he had a portion of the
Philosopher's Stone and that he could transmute base metals into
gold. Why does he not do so?"</p>

<p>"He awaits the commands of the angels," Dee said. "But making
of gold has never been any great matter to me, Sire. My work I
have held to be greater than money, honours, pride and
jewels."</p>

<p>"Yet pride makes you speak thus," replied the Emperor. "Maybe
what you cherish so is but a temptation of Satan." He gave his
unpleasant smile as he added: "Many a saint has fallen into the
pit he has digged for himself by thinking he has a perfect
knowledge of God's will. I know something of your partner. His
evil living is notorious; he is much given to wayward passion and
wild outbreaks, there is nothing about him either pure or holy.
Why should the angels discourse with such as he?"</p>

<p>"Maybe in an endeavour to save his soul," replied John Dee,
trembling, "for which reason I also cleave to him. With many a
parable and with many an exhortation the angels have bidden us
labour together. Why, Sire, should I question the heavenly
commands? Maybe God has chosen a base instrument to work his
ends."</p>

<p>Rudolph stared moodily at the quicksilver on the alabaster
dish. He broke it with the point of his finger and watched it run
together again. A deep melancholy had descended upon him like a
veil. He seemed to have forgotten to whom he spoke, to take no
interest in the matter under discussion. In a hoarse, indifferent
voice he said:</p>

<p>"If you or your man can make gold, let me hear of it;
otherwise, go your way."</p>

<p>Then he raised his fair head and gave Dr. Dee such a drowsy
and inturned squinting look that the Englishman knew he was in
the presence of a madman.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Edward Kelley had partaken of the Sacrament, to
the great joy of John Dee. From that very day he had disappeared,
and his friend sadly feared that even at the moment of his great
regeneration, he had returned to some of the dark byways where he
spent the evil hours of his life.</p>

<p>It was candlelight when he returned and he seemed neither
drunk nor sober, but in a state of wild exaltation. He wore the
green suit that he had bought for his first visit to the Palace,
and it was very soiled and tarnished and open at the throat and
torn on the shoulder as if he had been in some scuffle. His hands
and face were newly washed and his shining hair combed straight
over his deformed ears.</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pouch and went to where Jane Dee was
sitting by the window and threw into her lar a long
chain&mdash;it might be two yards&mdash;of finely-worked gold.
Each link was set with a balas ruby. As she looked at it she went
pale and red, then took it up in hei cold fingers and handled it,
all without apeaking, bui John Dee exclaimed much and a wild hope
flashed in his patient eyes:</p>

<p>"Have you come upon the secret, Edward Kelley?" he asked in
awe-stricken tones.</p>

<p>The young man laughed.</p>

<p>"Last night I made a projection with the two powders found at
Glastonbury. I took the gold that I made this afternoon to a
goldsmith. He declared it to be finer than any that was ever
minted in Prague and with the ducats he gave me I bought this
chain."</p>

<p>A heart-felt joy and gratitude shone on the worn face of the
old man. He saw himself at the climax of hi: career, the heavenly
portals opening before him, and never for a second did it occur
to him that the supreme moment had been given, not to him, but to
Edward Kelley, and that he had been even excluded from the
triumphant experiments.</p>

<p>Jane Dee ran the chain in and out of her fingers and in a
constrained voice asked:</p>

<p>"Why did you put your ducats into this extravagant purchase,
when we cannot pay the rent and get food and drink?"</p>

<p>"Since I can make gold, is there any need to hoard it? Are we
not now secure of everything&mdash;the patronage of the Palatine,
ay, of the Emperor?"</p>

<p>He sat down at the poorly plenished supper board and ate the
coarse bread and drank the rough wine with the avidity of a man
who had long been without food, and Dr. Dee, like one in a
trance, went upstairs to his private chamber to give thanks unto
God for a miracle.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Jane Dee rose and, coming to the board, put
the chain down by Edward Kelley's plate.</p>

<p>"By what evil means did you get this? You have robbed it, or
stolen it, and come upon it by false pretences," she said,
without force or venom, however, and even with a gentle caress in
her voice.</p>

<p>He replied, with his glass of poor wine in his hand:</p>

<p>"Why should you so utterly disbelieve in me? I came upon it
honestly. Did I not promise it to you?"</p>

<p>"And what of your wife?" she asked, "who has scarce a
petticoat or a cloak to her name?"</p>

<p>"You know," he replied, with simplicity, "that all I can do is
for you. As for Joan Kelley, she is no concern of mine."</p>

<p>Jane Dee continued to finger the chain.</p>

<p>"However you got this, you must take it out and sell it, and
we will live on whatever you get for it."</p>

<p>He shook his head. A smile of sweet cunning gave a curious
wistful beauty to his pale face.</p>

<p>"I am now secure of the patronage of the Emperor. Do not try
to bewilder, depress, or confuse me in this difficult game I
play, Jane Dee. I will see you housed in a palace, clad in velvet
and brocade. I will see all your children in high places."</p>

<p>"Away with these vain boasts," she interrupted. "Let us get
back to England. This is like a foul dream to me, this city, so
dark and the houses so high and so full of many fumes."</p>

<p>"You are a woman, sick with foolish fancies. Wear your chain;
I believe it is the first ornament you have had since I came to
Mortlake." And as she still stood with it in her hand he rose
and, taking it from her slack fingers, put it twice round her
long, white neck.</p>

<p>The richness of the jewels looked sad on her poor attire, and
seemed to stress her worn features, her faded hair, her dimmed
eyes. Young as she was, all her beauty had almost entirely gone.
She had neither bloom nor lustre, neither richness nor colour,
yet there was a certain graceful loveliness in her fading, which
was pure and simple like that of a flower, with no hint of
corruption or decay.</p>

<p>"You want to make a mock of me," she said, and she smiled with
her pale lips, round which the fine lines were already
gathering.</p>

<p>And he replied, taking her hand in his:</p>

<p>"I see you as you were, Jane Dee, when you were a little
maiden, perhaps of fifteen or sixteen years, and you stood in a
field with the flowers hiding your knees. Somebody flung round
your neck a double chain of buttercups, with here and there a
cluster of red hawthorn. That is what I thought of when I bought
for you the chain of gold and rubies."</p>

<p>She took her hand from his and sat down at their plain board,
drinking the common wine with him, strangely adorned for that
poor room, her jewel the one rich thing in the alien chamber.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">During that winter Edward Kelley made several
projections with the stone given him by the angels or from the
two powders he had discovered and bought in Wales; he never was
explicit as to either of these marvels or as to his use of
them.</p>

<p>One experiment was made in the presence of Dr. Curtius; a
single paring of the stone made a large ingot of gold and such
was the virtue of the projection that a large ruby, pure and
brilliant as a drop of heart's blood, was left besides in the
crucible.</p>

<p>It might have been considered that the quest of the
adventurers was now at an end and they had achieved their desire,
and might under the patronage of the Emperor, have attained all
the riches and honours which they could possibly have desired.
But, as Edward Kelley put it, the angels wished them to be
subject to further temptations.</p>

<p>When Dr. Curtius, in much exaltation, went to the Hradcany
with the report that the English adept, Edward Kelley, really had
made gold, he found the Emperor fallen into one of his melancholy
trances, which alternated with fits of violence so terrible that
he had been shut away by his physicians in two dark leathern
padded chambers in the north wing of the Palace. In the elaborate
work-rooms and laboratories the furnaces were damped down and the
assistants were idle until His Imperial Majesty should come to
his senses again.</p>

<p>To add to this misfortune, Kelley lost, temporarily, as he
declared, the power of making gold. The formula, that had been so
successful once, did not work out satisfactorily the next time.
The mercury, sulphur and magnesia did not coalesce, and when Dr.
Curtius came eagerly to a second, third and fourth experiment
there was nothing to show him but failure.</p>

<p>Jane Dee had nothing to say about these disasters. She took
her gold chain set with the rubies, which Edward Kelley had
bought her, to the Court goldsmith and sold it for sufficient
ducats to keep the household for several weeks.</p>

<p>There was, for Dr. Dee, yet another darkening of the prospects
which had been so bright. Edward Kelley stubbornly and sullenly
refused to skry any more. He would not look, even for a second,
into the crystal, but occupied himself solely with his chemical
experiments. Upon this the astrologer, in despair, endeavoured to
use John Crocker, the servant, as a medium, but the man saw
nothing but changing crosslights in the globe. Then, though with
much misgivings and in face of vehement opposition from Jane Dee,
he took the child Arthur and set him in front of the shewstone.
The boy saw nothing but whirling beams and stars and frightened
himself so that he fell down in a fit and lay for several weeks
deadly ill. Jane Dee was incessantly up and down the dark narrow
stairs nursing him, the infant Micheal at her breast, and Roland
and Katherine following, holding by her skirts.</p>

<p>Joan Kelley laboured patiently in the kitchen, mending and
washing the linen, and turning about their effects so that they
might make before the people of Prague, so evilly disposed
against them, some decent appearance.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley, who continued to profess a deep disbelief in
the angelic spirits, made a proposal which came, he said, not
from heaven, but from his own common sense.</p>

<p>This was that they should forsake Laski, who no longer paid
them anything and the Emperor, who was indubitably mad, and seek
another patron.</p>

<p>What about Stephan, the great and glorious King of Poland, who
held his Court at Cracow? Surely he was desperately in need of
money and would give them every encouragement. And Kelley
thought, he added, that it would be better for them to leave
Prague. They had attracted some strange company to the hired
house, many of whom Kelley believed to be spies. One of them, an
Italian pervert, Francisco Pucci, Kelley was convinced to be a
Jesuit in disguise. He had been imprudently admitted to the
sittings at the shewstone, and soon after, the officers of the
law had entered Dr. Dee's house and seized three copies of his
manuscripts, which were publicly burned in the early days of
April. These were: <i>The Book of Enoch, The Forty-Eight Keys of
the Angels</i>, and the <i>Book of Earthly Victories</i>, all of
which had been written down from spirit revelations since Edward
Kelley had come to the house at Mortlake. Dr. Dee had wept to see
The Book of Enoch taken away. It was a copy made by Kelley and
contained wonderful examples of his beautiful penmanship and
accurate draughtsmanship, for it had hundreds of diagrams
composed of an infinite number of minute squares, each containing
a letter or figure in every possible combination and order.</p>

<p>Soon after this, His Holiness, Sextus V., issued a Papal
Edict, banishing Dee and Kelley from Prague within six days, and
though neither the insane Emperor or those who ruled in his name,
took any notice of this, it added to the uneasiness of the
English adventurers. The dark menace of the city of the
alchemists was stressed.</p>

<p>John Dee wrote to Walsingham, hinting, in obscure and mystical
language, that he and his partner had come upon the secret of
secrets, and at the same time sending anxious inquiries after his
worldly goods, and begging that Thomas Digges, the mathematician,
might be sent to Mortlake to see what had really happened to his
house, library and goods.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the recanted Roman Catholic, Pucci, was busy about
them, nosing and spying, seeking to make, as Kelley declared, all
places unsafe for them; he even urged them to go to Rome, and it
was Jane Dee who was the first to declare this to be a trap. Her
husband agreed with her and decided to accept no such invitation,
especially as this was coupled with the proviso that they should
practise no more magical arts.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley began to importune the Palatine for some of the
money due to them, but the Polonian prince, who had been elated
by the first successful projection and was profoundly discouraged
by the failures that followed, promised no more than to take them
to Cracow and introduce them to King Stephan Bathory.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The King of Poland received the two English
alchemists with stately courtesy. He was seated by the south
window of his banqueting-chamber in his Palace of Cracow. Behind
him was the garden which he was laying out with every costly
device that taste could contrive. The trees were new-flowering in
red and white against the sky, of a pale, emerald colour, and
gardeners were setting rows of plants in exquisite parterres.</p>

<p>This Stephan Bathory of Transylvania was a very different
ruler from the Emperor Rudolph. He was no visionary and had no
belief in magic nor interest in alchemy, but was a practical man
of affairs, and a statesman of great intellect who had reigned
gloriously, showing a rare and magnificent toleration for
Protestants and Jews alike. He received the Palatine of Siradia
with grave civility (though he read the man very plainly, and
knew that he conspired for the Polish crown), and turned on the
two Englishmen his serene and magnificent gaze, examining them
carefully while they exchanged stately and formal compliments in
Latin, in which tongue he, the king, was highly accomplished.</p>

<p>Adelbert Laski spoke for the two Englishmen who he had induced
to leave their own country, and begged the king to take them into
his service and give them a yearly wage.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, sire, they know the secret of making gold and
the Philosopher's Stone, but, there is a considerable charge
involved. If your Majesty would bear that and pay their expenses
while they are at their labours, success would be assured."</p>

<p>The King turned his calm noble face towards Dr. Dee.</p>

<p>"Can you make this stone?"</p>

<p>"I cannot make it, sire, but the angels will show me the
secret. Already Edward Kelley has done it."</p>

<p>The King then looked again at the younger alchemist. His
serene expression did not betray his thoughts as he remarked:</p>

<p>"Surely your own Sovereign would be grateful for the exercise
of your powers. Is your Queen so wealthy that she disdains the
subject who can make gold?"</p>

<p>John Dee sighed. He felt old and weary; his was such a long
and, as he felt, complicated story. How explain to this foreign
prince the impulses that had driven him forth from his own
country upon the long quest which he had undertaken, which had
nothing whatever to do with the making of gold? He replied
simply:</p>

<p>"Sire, this gold is not much in my heart. By a twist the
things to which I gave little importance have become the end of
our adventure."</p>

<p>"You do not speak very clearly," smiled Stephan Bathory. "You
converse with the angels, you say?"</p>

<p>"If your Majesty will but see the shewstone," began Edward
Kelley, putting himself forward and not wincing before the keen
gaze of the wise and vigilant prince.</p>

<p>"May I behold the spirits?" smiled the King.</p>

<p>"I behold the spirits," replied Kelley, unabashed, "and
interpret them to your Majesty."</p>

<p>"It seems, on those terms, that anyone might be cozened by any
rogue," replied the King, with an ironic courtesy. "This is all
past my understanding. I am a plain man of affairs, and have my
own business to mind."</p>

<p>But he agreed, as a matter of courtesy, to allow them to bring
the crystal to the Palace, where, in his private chamber, he
would assist at the skrying of Edward Kelley. His Vice-Chancellor
and chief Secretary and others coming in, bringing letters and
bills for him to read and sign, put an end to this interview.
But, in a few days, the two came back to the Palace at Cracow,
Kelley carrying the shewstone, and in the King's inner closet it
was set up and Edward Kelley knelt before it, upon which Uriel
and Michael at once, he said, appeared and made long and rambling
prophecies as to the future of Stephan Bathory.</p>

<p>The King interrupted the sittings. He rose and, tapping the
Palatine on the shoulder, said:</p>

<p>"Let these two return to Prague; they may get more
encouragement from the Emperor than from myself, for indeed I can
promise nothing. I am neither convinced that angels are present,
nor sanguine that they will ever appear. I believe that God has
reserved to himself three things&mdash;the creation of something
out of nothing, the knowledge of futurity and the government of
the conscience."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley, at this, rose to his feet with an evil Look and
a sullen leer, which the King, observing, smiled slightly and
passed out of the room. Adelbert Laski, confused and humiliated,
followed him.</p>

<p>In the corridor, outside the private room where Edward Kelley
angrily and John Dee sadly were packing Lip the shewstones, the
seals and the table, the King remarked to Laski:</p>

<p>"The young man is a common rogue, but for the old man I am
very sorry."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">So John Dee and Edward Kelley, who were now
abandoned by the Palatine, returned to Prague.</p>

<p>The disguised Romanist and Papal spy, Pucci, for they felt him
to be no other, was still at their heels, and they had no money,
save the fee which King Stephan had given them for the expenses
of their journey, and which John Dee did not want to take, for it
had been given in kindly contempt, but which they were forced to
accept, for they had no other means.</p>

<p>Now all seemed in the depths again, but Kelley, who was very
energetic in misfortune, set about discovering a new patron, and
was so wonderfully rewarded in his efforts that John. Dee became
heartened again and believed that they really were under Divine
protection, for the slayer had gone to wait upon the Viceroy of
Bohemia, Wilheim Ursinus, Graf Rosenburg, who was believed to be
profoundly interested in alchemy, and who had heard with the
greatest excitement of the arojections which the Englishman had
made.</p>

<p>This was a very powerful protector; he was a Knight of the
Golden Fleece, and had great influence with Rudolph, when his
Majesty was in his saner moments. Both he and his brother, Graf
Peter, were great patrons of art and letters and flowers of the
Bohemian nobility.</p>

<p>Graf Wilheim at once behaved with a lavish generosity towards
the Englishmen that they had not hitherto experienced. He offered
his protection and influence to the two alchemists, and at once
obtained from the Emperor permission for them to reside in any of
his towns or castles and then made them the offer to go and
reside in his Castle of Trebona, or Wittingau, in South Bohemia,
and there to stay as long as they would, making their alchemical
and philosophical experiments in peace. And he undertook to pay
their just expenses, and to give them a respectable salary.</p>

<p>When Edward Kelley brought this news, for it was he who
conducted all the negotiations with the new patron, to the little
hired house near the market place, John Dee fell on his knees,
with tears in his eyes and his trembling old hands crossed on his
breast and thanked God for having at last brought him into a
peaceful haven and made an end of all his tribulations, trials,
and wanderings. He felt he had survived a bitter test, that he
had been asked to endure much, but had, in the end, been highly
rewarded.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley did not remain to listen to the old man's
pathetic rejoicings and thanksgivings. He went out to seek Jane
Dee. On the way to her room, he passed his own wife on the
stairs, and for once in a way gave her a greeting, taking her by
the arm and asking her with a smile if she would not be glad to
have a settled home at last?</p>

<p>"You know," replied she, "that I am glad of nothing. What is
my life to me but duties from morning to night and no solace nor
pleasure?"</p>

<p>"You were always a dull, poor creature," greeted her husband,
flinging the woman from him so that she stumbled down two or
three steps and had to catch at the rail. "And I wish I could
think of some device whereby I should not have to take you to
Trebona."</p>

<p>She made no demur at his ill treatment; it was largely her
resignation which angered him against her. He went upstairs gaily
to the room where Jane Dee sat. It was one that she kept for
herself and for her children, where she had set up her spinning
wheel and did her mending and her sewing of their poor, much-used
garments.</p>

<p>When he entered she looked up eagerly; she could not but be
infected by his joy and eagerness. He stood inside the door
panting like one who has come in after a long running and told
her his news, of the fine new patron who had been raised, as it
were, out of the ground for them, who had promised so much, yes,
even all their hearts' desires.</p>

<p>Jane Dee put her hand, which was tired with plying the needle,
before her weary eyes and wept a little. She could not resist
this weakness&mdash;it seemed so good to think at last of being
in some haven.</p>

<p>"For the children's sake," she murmured, and with great
sincerity, for it was long since she had ceased to think of
herself, save only in dreams, where she was, in a fashion,
disembodied. Yes, that was the great relief&mdash;housing and
food and clothes, and some schooling for the children. The two
elder were now in need of a master; she had taught them all she
knew of book learning.</p>

<p>"Are you glad, Jane Dee? Have I pleased you? I have done
this&mdash;I, by all my labours." Edward Kelley lightly struck
his breast. "I, who you despised so much, have achieved this for
you, while your husband prayed and dreamed."</p>

<p>"It is true I am glad of the pause from wandering and of the
shelter." Jane Dee dried her tears and bit her lower lip. The
case had another aspect&mdash;was she so pleased to be enclosed
with Edward Kelley in a common household for an indefinite
period? She was fortified against him, it was true, but how long
would she remain so sure of herself?</p>

<p>She looked at him with terror in her tear-stained eyes.</p>

<p>More than ever he seemed to direct her destiny, more than ever
it seemed impossible to avoid him, and more than ever she had
great and perpetual need of him. She bent down and took the young
child Michael from his cradle and held him against her breast
like a shield.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley smiled. He seemed pleased by her terror, and
softly left the room and, avoiding the chamber where John Dee
prayed, went up to his own apartment and sat, deep in thought in
the twilight.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Graf Rosenberg's castle at Trebona stood lonely
in the gentle scenery of the Ludnitz, near the River Moldau.
There was a town hall, a barracks, and a few small houses
gathered round the Viceroy's great dwelling. The gardens were
very beautiful and had been most diligently laid out and cared
for, regardless of cost, by the Viceroy of Bohemia, who was
magnificent in everything he undertook. These gardens were not so
famous as those in his castle at Neuhaus, near Prague, yet Dr.
Dee found them nearly as magnificent as those he had admired in
Stephan Bathory's palace at Cracow.</p>

<p>It seemed to the old mathematician, whose health had been much
shaken of late by his many disappointments and hardships, and by
the long tribulations with Edward Kelley's moods, tempers and
fits of devilish possessions, as if the angels' promises had at
last been redeemed. This patron, who had arrived so suddenly and,
as it seemed to the alchemist, so strangely, not only promised
but performed substantial benefits. Here was none of the vague
elusiveness with which the mathematician was too used from his
own Queen, from the Emperor, and even from Graf Laski.</p>

<p>Rosenberg was not only rich but generous. He promised them all
that they should need and gave them, in his handsomely appointed
castle, a large suite of rooms looking out upon the gardens,
workmen to build a laboratory and to fit up one of the chambers
as a chapel.</p>

<p>This Wilhelm Ursinus, then Viceroy of Bohemia, was a man in
middle life, of an ardent and choleric temperament. He was
supposed to have, more than anyone else, power over the wavering
mind of Rudolph IL He did not stay for long at a time at Trebona,
but came and went with the eager intensity of one on urgent
business&mdash;from Vienna to Prague, from Krumau to Vienna, and
from one to another of his various castles. But every few weeks
or so he was at Trebona, superintending the building of the
furnaces, and taking his part in the sittings at the crystal.</p>

<p>He often took Edward Kelley with him on these journeys, so
that the young man would be absent two, three weeks, or a month
at a time, leaving his wife, John and Jane Dee.</p>

<p>Though the Castle of Trebona was lonely, it was not desolate
nor gloomy, and a constant stream of visitors came, attracted by
the fame of Dr. Dee, and the noise which had been sent abroad
about the experiments he was making, both with the crystal and
with the transmutation of metals. Pucci, the Italian Jesuit, came
and sought out the alchemist and brought another priest with him,
but John Dee took all he said to be but a bait or a trap and
would not have him in his confidence.</p>

<p>English travellers to Bohemia also arrived at Trebona, and
some of them brought news and letters from England and the matter
of these was that John Dee should return&mdash;both his Queen and
his friends desired his presence in London. But the mathematician
was obeying a higher power than the Queen of England; he waited
the good will and advice of the angels. He did not voice the
secret uneasiness that was growing within him, despite all this
good chance, and which was founded on the fact that Edward Kelley
showed a greater and greater reluctance to skry at the crystal
and, when he was at Trebona, spent more and more time closeted in
the laboratory which he had fitted up very completely and
luxuriously at Graf Rosenberg's expense.</p>

<p>This nobleman had just married. His wife was young and seemed
much in awe of her husband, who treated her with kindness, and
yet with a certain obvious exercise of authority that kept her
much in her place. She could not speak English, but Jane Dee had
learnt a little German and in this the two women conversed,
haltingly. Alien as they were to one another, they felt at least
sympathy. With gentle smiles and sighs they conveyed one to
another their understanding of each other's plight, how they had
been, like most other women, forced to follow the fortunes of men
which they did not understand.</p>

<p>The young Countess liked to take Jane Dee's children and nurse
them on her knees and to make them little presents of linen caps
and velvet coats and embroidered gloves which she worked
herself.</p>

<p>The weeks passed by very quickly, Jane Dee thought. Time
seemed to have no longer much meaning. It was to her as if she
stayed by the roadside and watched strangers travelling to
unknown places; she saw the days and the weeks pass in Trebona
and was neither satisfied nor fretted. She observed Edward Kelley
come and go, and he also was a shadow among shadows. Often she
would stand at her window and see him ride out across the
drawbridge down the one crooked, winding street of the little
town. And then again, by chance, she would be looking out across
the dusk, by idle chance, and see him riding in with his cloak
flying and the long hat with a heron's feather on his flat cap.
He was very richly dressed now, and wore gold rings and a bright
clasp of gold at his throat. He spoke to her very seldom, and
once, as he came upon her by chance, he asked if she were not
sorry that she had parted with the gold chain which would have
shown finely in their present magnificent condition? But Jane did
not answer, she was not sure of the future, for which she waited
with a passivity of one drugged both by familiarity with dreams
and the strangeness of actuality.</p>

<p>The winter was very cold, the air bright and clear; the castle
was warm and comfortable, with thick hangings on the walls, a
generous spread of rushes, and even carpets underfoot, and huge
fires burning on every hearth, very different from the small,
dark, chill houses in which Jane Dee had lived since she left
Mortlake.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas there came one Thomas Simkinson, from
Hull, who had been sent by a friend of Dee's, Edward Garland, who
was then in Russia, to search them out. The Emperor of Muscovy
had given him a sealed letter which was for John Dee, and by the
means of this Simkinson, it came to the hands of the
mathematician and with it the letter from Edward Garland, saying
that these promises might surely be relied upon.</p>

<p>The Emperor offered the sum of two thousand pounds a year,
free diet from the royal kitchens, and five hundred horses to
convey John Dee from wherever he might be to Moscow.</p>

<p>Prince Boris had, Garland wrote, promised a thousand roubles
from his own purse besides the Emperor's allowance.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of Thomas Simkinson, Edward Garland
came himself and repeated all the promises made by the other
Englishman. These two were dressed very finely in furs and
stamped, embroidered leathers lined with velvet. They had with
them eight Russian servants in bearskins, and Graf von Rosenberg
entertained them with lavish hospitality and listened eagerly to
their tales of Muscovy, which was a country of which few men knew
much, and he asked why it was that the Emperor Feodor Ivanowitch
made such extravagant offers to the Englishmen.</p>

<p>Edward Garland said the Tzar wished for the mathematician's
advice about the discoveries to the North-East, for he was well
known to have helped Adrian Gilbert and others, and to be very
skilful at drawing maps and compasses.</p>

<p>"There are other weighty occasions, also," added Garland with
a knowing smile, and Edward Kelley, who had come quietly into the
room and stood in the warm, fire-laden shadows by the window, put
in on a laugh:</p>

<p>"He thinks we can make gold."</p>

<p>"The man who makes gold needs not the favour of any Emperor!"
replied Garland.</p>

<p>"It has got abroad that I made gold in Prague," boasted Edward
Kelley.</p>

<p>And the two Englishmen said that they had heard as much, but
also that further projections had been difficult through the loss
of the formula.</p>

<p>"But we work," interrupted John Dee eagerly. "We work. Often
Kelley is labouring day and night. He neglects the holy spirits:
I hope they will not be angered thereat."</p>

<p>Then the Englishmen got up and moved nearer the fire. They had
taken off their fur coats, but still looked foreign in their
high, coloured, leather boots and jackets of skin, laced with
scarlet and blue silk. They laughed, half-impressed,
half-incredulous, and cried:</p>

<p>"Make us some gold, Edward Kelley!"</p>

<p>"Do you believe that I can?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>He had lately come from Prague, where he had received, by what
means and for what reason Dee could not understand, five hundred
ducats from Graf Laski. He had spent these on clothes and looked
very fine in a fashionable suit of yellow with little silk tags
and points.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in me or not?" he insisted.</p>

<p>Edward Garland replied gravely:</p>

<p>"I have travelled too far and seen too many strange things to
doubt anything. This modern age is an epoch of wonders. Who knows
what may be discovered or performed from one day to the next?
Things are now possible which our fathers would have rejected as
frantic impossibilities. The powers of man seem daily to stretch
farther in every direction. I have, for myself, seen many strange
things," he repeated, stroking his cold cheek as he stood by the
fire and looking slantwise at Edward Kelley. "I have voyaged in
lands which our fathers did not know existed. I have spoken with
men like Tycho Brahe. I have seen wonders," he repeated. His chin
sank on his breast and he stared into the flames.</p>

<p>His two companions nodded, but Edward Kelley gave a little
cunning laugh and fingered the strings at his wrist.</p>

<p>"The round furnace was completed to-day," he bragged. "I will
go and make you some gold."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Edward Kelley went slowly towards his
laboratory, which had been indeed fitted up with great
magnificence, and though it was not on the same scale as that
owned by the Emperor Rudolph in Prague, yet still, by Graf
Rosenberg's directions, it was one of the finest in Germany. But,
on his way there, the young alchemist paused and went to another
portion of the castle, where Jane Dee had her household.</p>

<p>In the large room where the women usually worked, Edward
Kelley found his own wife and the children and two maidservants
of the Countess Rosenberg. At this he turned away with a scowl,
and at the door turned and rudely asked his wife where was Jane
Dee.</p>

<p>The girl, without malice or unkindness, but with a meek
acceptance of her fate that should have moved him to regret but
did not affect him' at all, replied that Jane Dee was in the
outer room, making some preparations for Christmas. They had
brought in a fir tree from the grounds and were sticking it full
of candies and bright toys, fastening little candles to it by
means of metal spikes.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley went into this room and saw Jane Dee standing by
the table on which stood the conifer. She still wore her plain,
mended gown of faded stuff, which had done her such good service
on their travels and, though their present prosperity was
tempting, she was terrified to spend money that they might, by
some sudden change of fortune, require, so all that was given her
for her own account she hoarded.</p>

<p>The room was lit by a lantern that hung from the ceiling. The
light fell on the tree and on the woman, and all the glittering
toys and glass bells and balls, packets of sweets in bright
papers that were scattered about. For the rest, the large chamber
was enveloped in pools beyond pools of shadow, for the fire had
sunk low and the red, hot, crumbling log gave but a glow on the
hearth.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley went up to Jane Dee and, putting his hand in his
pocket, took out the chain he had given her in Prague.</p>

<p>"This is yours," he said. "Perhaps, now, you will wear
it."</p>

<p>"Where do you get all this money?"</p>

<p>"Graf Laski gave me five hundred ducats. I spent much of it in
redeeming this chain from the man to whom you so foolishly sold
it."</p>

<p>"Foolishly!" said she, with her hands full of bright toys, her
eyes full of tears. "It was for bread for us all."</p>

<p>He laid the chain down among her Christmas trifles; he seemed
to have suddenly lost interest in it.</p>

<p>"Well, it is yours again. Wear it now. Are you content here?
You have everything the heart could desire?" As she did not
reply, he added with emphasis: "It is I who did this. I found the
patron. I made the gold. I gained the confidence of these great
ones. If the Emperor of Muscovy asks your husband to come to his
Court, it is not because of his great learning and reputation,
but because it is rumoured that I can make gold."</p>

<p>Jane Dee answered quietly:</p>

<p>"I have seen that of late you set yourself up, Edward Kelley,
even above my husband, to whom you first came as an assistant,
almost as a servant. It is you, and not he, who go on journeys
with Graf Rosenberg."</p>

<p>"Dr. Dee is an old man and not fit to travel. Must I be
hampered by that?"</p>

<p>"I hope that you will be loyal to him. He shows no rancour, no
malice, no jealousy, for he is above all such defects. Yet, were
you to slight him it would surely break his heart. He has
suffered much and laboured long, and he believes himself in sight
of the goal&mdash;in sight of the attainment of heavenly
wisdom."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley laughed and picked, with his beautiful fingers,
at the yellow tags at his waist. He was exceedingly graceful in
his well-fitting clothes, and had lost lately much of his pallor
and haggard emaciation. Good food and high hopes had given him a
lustre which he had hitherto lacked, and added to the
self-confidence which he had always owned. To everyone save Jane
Dee he was most arrogant.</p>

<p>"I see these things," she continued, "but my husband does not.
John Dee is single hearted, and wrapped more in the other world
than in this."</p>

<p>"The man is old and much of his learning is dead or foolish. I
have found out from him all that I wish to know."</p>

<p>Jane Dee, with raised hands, instantly checked these
contemptuous words.</p>

<p>"I will not hear you speak so of my husband. This is what I
feared from the first. You basely delude him, and now would
basely boast of it. Do not be too sure of me, Edward Kelley, I
might even now turn my husband's heart from you and expose you
for the rogue that you are."</p>

<p>"You would not dare so far hurt yourself. You know, too, that
you would be wrong. I am not utterly a deceiver or a
trickster."</p>

<p>"I will not have my husband hurt."</p>

<p>"Soon, Jane Dee, you will be put to the test. What I have in
store for you, you would never guess at. Put on the chain," he
added, in a peremptory tone and, taking it, threw it round her
long, white neck, where it gleamed and glittered in the light of
the high lantern on her slender bosom and shabby gown. It was the
second time that he had done this; the two occasions became fused
in their minds.</p>

<p>She did not try to remove the ornament, but went on with her
preparations, fixing the small, coloured candles on to the metal
spikes and hanging the globes of coloured glass on the boughs of
the small, dark fir tree and he left her, with the smile of a man
who wastes his time, and went into his laboratory.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Edward Kelley was late for supper that night.
The meal was served with much extravagance in the great Mall and
at his long and shining board, loaded with noble pieces of plate,
carved crystal and lustred potteries from Italy, the Viceroy of
Bohemia entertained all travellers that came that way, and there
was seldom fewer than forty or fifty men who sat down in the
great vaulted hall and were waited upon by the serving men in the
liveries of Rosenberg.</p>

<p>The nobleman had returned unexpectedly, with his usual air of
haste and importance, and sat at the head of the table on a chair
raised higher than the others, with gilt arms, curved and carved
into the shape of lions' heads.</p>

<p>He was a fair man, eager eyed and clothed in red velvet, with
a shirt of puckered needlework, and on his breast glimmered the
Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>He spoke very eagerly to Edward Garland and Thomas Simkinson,
inquiring from them news of Muscovy that huge, strange country
about which so little was known, and the voyages they had made in
the Baltic and the talk of the North-East and the North-West
passages, and what difference these discoveries, if they came to
pass, would make to Europe. And he complimented Dr. Dee greatly
on the offer which had been made him by Feodor Ivanowitch, and
said it was the most princely proposal he had ever heard.</p>

<p>But he also much commended the old man's resolution not to
forsake his loyalty to his native sovereign.</p>

<p>"Yet I hope, Dr. Dee, that you will not return, even to
England just yet, but stay for a while in Rosenburg until I have
learnt something of your wisdom."</p>

<p>And, leaning down the board to where Dr. Dee sat in his worn,
darned black garments, Graf Rosenberg laughed and said there was
much talk all over the Empire of the doings in Trebona Castle,
which were, by the vulgar, basely added to, and over coloured, so
that there was talk of nightly revels, of demons and witches in
the moat and round the towers, and he added, with the serenity of
a man who does not have to account for his actions:</p>

<p>"What we do would be dangerous, were I other than I am." And
he asked if there had lately been any sittings with the
spirits?</p>

<p>To this Dr. Dee replied reluctantly and sadly:</p>

<p>"No, for Edward Kelley has refused to skry, but remains, when
he is here, in his laboratory, and often he is not here, but away
in Prague, or even Vienna."</p>

<p>At this the Viceroy laughed towards the two Englishmen who had
come with the message from the Emperor of Muscovy.</p>

<p>"Has it got so far as Moscow," he said, "that Edward Kelley
can make gold?"</p>

<p>And at that moment the door at the end of the long hall opened
and the man of whom they spoke came in, excusing himself for
being late for supper. He looked very young and sprightly, he had
the air of a city gallant. His hair was curled over his mangled
ears, and he smiled with an expression of triumph as he
approached the head of the table and, opening a napkin he held in
his hand, he showed the Viceroy two ounces of gold, which he
declared he had just made with a simple projection of mercury. He
said no more than that, but sat down in his place and drank
copiously, his pale eyes flashing over the brim of his goblet, as
the gold was passed round the table from one to another, exciting
murmurs of amazement and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The Master of the Count's Mines was there, and he declared
that he could, without any test, warrant this to be pure and,
perfect gold. John Dee's heart seemed to sing within his breast
among the babble of talk in which the two Englishmen from Muscovy
joined with great excitement. Edward Kelley sat silent, his pale
eyes flickering and flashing above the brim of the goblet he held
to his lips.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">The younger alchemist began to assume
authoritative airs. From the pupil he had become the master. It
was to see him that so many visitors came to Trebona. It was with
him that Rosenberg was closeted hour after hour, day after day.
It was to ask his advice that astronomers, alchemists and seekers
after the Philosopher's Stone wrote and sent messages to Trebona.
It was to Edward Kelley that Graf Laski had given the five
hundred ducats, three hundred of which had gone to redeem the
jewelled chain.</p>

<p>Everyone was attracted to Edward Kelley. It seemed that he had
but to meet people for them to love him, and this in spite of all
his wayward qualities and passionate tempers and known evil ways
of life.</p>

<p>The Viceroy of Bohemia, himself, took much pain: to endeavour
to reconcile Kelley with his wife, and though this was without
result, he never ceased to have a concern in the young
Englishman's affairs.</p>

<p>Standing, as it were, apart from all, Jane Dee noted this
change in the relationship of her husband and his assistant and
that Edward Kelley began to take the most arrogant airs. When
Rosenberg was not there he ruled the castle as if he were master,
and all the servants were expected to do his bidding. He refused
to skry any more, and often broke into fits of discontent.</p>

<p>What, he said, was a miserable fifty pounds a year to a man
who was the close friend of princes and nobles and who could make
gold? He had found the secret of secrets; he knew how to
transmute metals. He had found the secret of projection and he
was the possessor of the magic powder. The formula was costly and
difficult; it was at present a matter of chance if it were
successful or no, but if he had money to experiment, he could, at
will, make countless piles of ducats, and turn even the kitchen
pots into pure gold.</p>

<p>He told John Dee bluntly that he would devote himself to the
profitable course and would spend no more time crystal gazing,
and added that the angels now appeared to him in his laboratory
without the aid of the crystal; there was, for instance, a little
spirit named Ben, who had shown him how to distil oils from
spirits of wine, over a retort in two silver dishes placed one
upon another, with a hole through the middle and a sponge between
them in which the oils would remain.</p>

<p>This spirit had prophesied the death of all the sovereigns of
Europe and had told him to beware of Edward Garland, who was a
spy sent by Burleigh to see what they were doing, and he had
concluded with a menace: Unless the two alchemists were obedient
in everything to the heavenly voices power would be taken from
the magic powder and they would no longer be able to make
gold.</p>

<p>"But if you will skry no more, how are we to know what the
spirits intend for us?"</p>

<p>At which the young man answered angrily:</p>

<p>"Have I not told you that they come to me secretly in my
laboratory and tell me all straightly?"</p>

<p>"And am I to be dependent on you, Edward Kelley? Will you not
share with me the great secret of secrets which you say you have
discovered? Will you not let me partake of these spiritual
communications?" And he added: "Only this morning I learnt that
you have bribed away from me my best workman."</p>

<p>"What do you require with workmen, John Dee, seeing that your
experiments come to nothing and mine are successful?"</p>

<p>"I think you undermine me with Graf Rosenberg," said Dee,
without malice.</p>

<p>He felt no jealousy whatever at Kelley's triumphant success.
He was only grieved by what seemed to him ugly characteristics in
the young man, his lack of generosity, kindness and candour. The
mathematician was also hurt that one for whom he had done so much
and who had lived with him so long like a son should have no
confidence in him. And without reproach, but very earnestly he
added:</p>

<p>"What have I done to you, Edward Kelley, that you should seek
to keep me outside everything? Almost all you know you have
learnt from me!"</p>

<p>And Edward Kelley, drooping his wide lids over his pale eyes,
replied:</p>

<p>"I had the book and powder before ever I came to you."</p>

<p>"I think you have learnt something from me," insisted the old
man gently. "But we cannot quarrel. I know I have been true and
honest in what I have myself believed. I expect and hope the same
of you. Do not think that I hanker after worldly rewards, Edward
Kelley. Five Emperors would have pampered me&mdash;I have
received all the earthly honours that a man may have, and it is
very little to me. I ask no more than a maintenance for my
family; I desire to deceive no one."</p>

<p>At that Edward Kelley began to tremble with rage.</p>

<p>"Do you think that I deceive anyone? Has not Rosenberg himself
discoursed with the spirits? Has he not seen me make the
gold?"</p>

<p>"Of this I know nothing, since I have been excluded from your
sittings and from your laboratory."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have been deluded," said Edward Kelley, speaking at
a tangent, and more to himself than to John Dee, as it seemed.
"What have these spirits done for me? How many of their promises
have they redeemed? Did I not say from the first that I was not
seeking heavenly wisdom, but rather earthly good?"</p>

<p>"That you seem to have, Edward Kelley. You have found your
wealthy patron. You have discovered, you say, how to make gold.
What more do you require?"</p>

<p>The young man burst out passionately:</p>

<p>"I am most unhappy."</p>

<p>"You lead a reckless and disordered life, Edward Kelley,"
cried the mathematician sadly. "How often have I wrestled in
prayer for your good, humbling myself before God that you might
be turned from your miserable ways? Reconcile yourself to your
wife, live soberly. Have not the angels themselves commanded this
again and again?"</p>

<p>"I am weary of the angels and their sayings," shouted Edward
Kelley in a transport of fury. "I have a bitter aversion from my
wife. I have been married to her four years and she is barren.
What does that mean to me, to whom generation is the root
principle of alchemy? Is it not by the marriage of copper and
mercury that we get gold? Am I to be fruitless for ever because,
prompted by the Devil, I chose the wrong woman?"</p>

<p>"Why do you so set yourself against this poor creature, Edward
Kelley? She is docile and lively, and all love her. It seems as
if she pleased everyone save yourself?"</p>

<p>"Let her please who she will," flung out Edward Kelley
sullenly. "There is another who pleases me."</p>

<p>"Whoever this other is, she may not lawfully be yours,
therefore, take your mind off her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she may be mine, and lawfully, too," said the wayward
young man. "Everything shall be possible to me."</p>

<p>He turned his strange eyes full on Dr. Dee and began to laugh
loudly and bitterly, then left the old mathematician, violently
banging the door after him.</p>

<p>Again John Dee felt himself old and forsaken. He had no
refuge, save in his prayers, and of late it had seemed to him
that the heavens were closed against him.</p>

<p>But there was one who joined him in his desolation. Jane Dee
searched all over the castle for her husband.</p>

<p>When she found him, praying, lonely, she went on her knees by
his side and wept upon his breast, and he folded her closely to
him, thankful for this sweet comfort. And when their vehement
prayers were finished, he raised her to her feet and they stood
together, trembling, he old and she weak, and both afraid of one
who they loved.</p>

<p>"Let us get back to England. The Queen desires it, as these
Englishmen said, and Walsingham will not be your friend if you
stay away too long. It is all strange here and I fear we shall
never be happy in this place."</p>

<p>Holding her close, the old man asked simply:</p>

<p>"Jane, do you think that Edward Kelley with rancour and
dissimulation turns all against me and undermines me with Graf
Rosenberg? But, then, you were always angry and contemptuous
about him, Jane. You do not believe in him like I do, like I
must. He has found the secret of secrets."</p>

<p>"But he does not tell it to you. Are you sure that he does not
cozen everyone?"</p>

<p>The old man began to shake violently so that she was forced to
put him into a chair and hold his hands. It seemed as if he had
an attack of the ague, as it had overtaken him that other
dreadful winter at Lask.</p>

<p>"I could not endure that, Jane! I could not endure to believe
that the angels were all false. For five years I have lived with
them and believed in them and heard them speak, ay, and seen
their movements across the room. No, Jane, it cannot be but the
tricks of a rogue. Never tell me that, for it would be enough to
shake one's faith in God Almighty."</p>

<p>She went on her knees beside him and endeavoured to soothe him
with gentle caresses, while he clung to her and murmured:</p>

<p>"Do not try to make me disbelieve in the angels again. Why, I
think if I could not longer trust in them all would be quite
dark."</p>

<p>"If Edward Kelley were to refuse to skry for you any more you
would no longer see the angels&mdash;you would be shut out in the
darkness."</p>

<p>"That is an awful thought, Jane. Pray that Edward Kelley may
not be so unkind."</p>

<p>Down the old man's kind, worn face two difficult tears ran
slowly, so that she hid her face and wept for her pain and for
his desolation.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was a long while since Dr. Dee had made any
entry in the Book of Mysteries, and the last had been rambling
and incoherent, for he could, with great difficulty, interpret
the sayings of Uriel, Michael and Madimi, but he now began to
make entries in his other diary which he had scarcely opened
since he came from Mortlake, and one of these was made in great
pain of heart.</p>

<p>"The Lord Chancellor came to Trebona, and went away after
three days. The rancour and dissimulation now evident to me. God
deliver me; I was not sent for."</p>

<p>It was at last clear to him that he must stand aside. All the
favour and patronage of Rosenberg and Laski and the Emperor
himself were for Edward Kelley and Edward Kelley's great secret.
With a shaking hand, the old man finished the entry:</p>

<p>"Till now I was chief governor of our philosophical
proceedings, but little by little I became hindered and crossed
by fine and subtle devices made first by Bohemians, somewhat by
Italians and lastly by my own countrymen."</p>

<p>He still could not endure to believe that the five years'
quest had been, as far as he was concerned, a failure, ay, and a
failure as far as Edward Kelley was concerned also, for, as to
his own part, he considered the making of gold trivial compared
to the high wisdom which had been promised them by the angels. He
tried to take his mind off his great distress by thinking of
worldly matters and, in his most beautiful hand, sat down and
carefully penned a letter to the Queen, congratulating her upon
the great victory which the English Navy had lately achieved over
the Spanish Fleet. There were many friends of Dr. Dee in that
engagement&mdash;Frobisher, Drake, Hawkins and Lord Howard of
Effingham, whose wife had been a friend of Jane Dee.</p>

<p>As he wrote the letter a yearning for England came over him, a
longing for the grey-green river and the low, dull-coloured
willows, and the grey clouds, which seemed but a hand's space
above the housetops, and all the pleasant greenness of Richmond
and Mortlake and the gay little town of Brentford. And he
thought, for the first time since he had started on this quest,
and with a certain shock, that then surely he had been truly
happy&mdash;he and Jane and the two children and the servants and
Roger Cook. Ah, he had forgotten Roger Cook! How long it seemed
since the impetuous assistant had made his accusations against
Kelley and left the house, never to return!</p>

<p>Dee put his hand before his eyes and he could see the figure
of the man going off in the twilight. He had forgotten Roger
Cook, who had been with him, faithful and diligent, for fifteen
years. And in the letter of compliment to the Queen, he spoke
wistfully of his return, and asked for a safe conduct through all
the countries he must travel before he could reach England
again.</p>

<p>He was not yet certain that he wished to leave Trebona, for he
could not bring himself to admit the complete black failure which
threatened to engulf him with the departure of the angels, but
this gesture towards his native country pleased him, and he liked
to dwell on the thought of his return and of his treasures at
Mortlake. He hoped that the wretched people who had broken into
his house had not stolen his lodestone nor destroyed his precious
watch clock, made by Bibbley, which measured the seconds of each
hour.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was apparent, even to John Dee, that Edward
Kelley intended to play the master. He no longer used even a
shadow of deference towards anyone, but quarrelled with those
whom he could not subdue, among whom was the tutor, John Basset,
whom Dee had engaged to teach the children the Latin tongue for
seven ducats for the quarter.</p>

<p>Kelley made a hurly-burly with the pedant on the least excuse,
and quarrelled with all the visitors, English, Hungarian,
Bohemian and German, who came to Trebona.</p>

<p>More than this, he showed himself arrogant and contemptuous
towards all the books, the table, the figures and symbols which
Dr. Dee had taken down on the days when they used to skry
together, and kept himself in the set of apartments which
Rosenberg had had newly decorated for him, and when he was sent
for would not even come, though sometimes his haughty humour
would melt and he in his turn would send for Dr. Dee, with such
peremptory messages as: "You study too much, come and pass the
time with me at play." To which curt invitation the old man,
still with his double hope of the redemption of the angelic
prophecies and the regeneration of Edward Kelley's character,
would meekly respond.</p>

<p>Sometimes Dr. Dee, though quite conscious of, as he noted in
his book, "the great and wonderful unkindness used towards me,"
would even consent to obey a brief summons from Kelley to go to
his laboratory and see him make some experiments, such as the
distilling of sericon which he had learnt from Sir George
Ripley's book, <i>The Compounds of Alchemy</i>.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions Dr. Dee took the chance to point to
all the books which Kelley had in a corner of the room, and to
ask why they did not take up this study again, to skry in the
crystal and endeavour to interpret and decipher the figures which
the angels had given them?</p>

<p>Upon this Edward Kelley fell into a wonderful rage. With a
brusque movement of hand he sent over his desk lamp so that the
glass was broken, the spirit of wine spilled out, and a great
flame rose up and began to burn all the linen and printed volumes
among which was the very book of St. Dunstan which he had himself
had in the old days at Mortlake.</p>

<p>Kneeling on the side of his brick furnace, Edward Kelley
watched these books burning, and merely sneered. But John Dee,
with single-hearted enthusiasm, thrust his hand into the flames
which were scrollinground the loose leaves of the paper
manuscripts and pulled the Glastonbury treasure out of danger and
cast it down on a chair. The other offered no help, and, though
John Dee finally knocked out the flames with the end of his robe,
several of the books of tables, diagrams and curious figures were
hopelessly scorched, burnt and ruined.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Soon after this destruction of the books, John
Dee was disturbed in the night by a loud knocking on his chamber
door. He rose up in a pleasant alarm, thinking this was, at last,
a summons from Rosenberg, or maybe important messages from
England, and leaving Jane sleeping, he took up the rushlight,
threw on his robe and opened the door. And there was Edward
Kelley, standing in the corridor, a small lamp in his hand and a
look of madness on his face.</p>

<p>"The angels have appeared again, and we are to obey them in
everything, else all is lost!"</p>

<p>"God be thanked, Edward Kelley, that you have again looked in
the crystal!"</p>

<p>"Do not stop to thank God but come with me."</p>

<p>The young man's strong fingers closed round the old man's thin
wrist. He drew him out into the corridor and shut the door behind
him.</p>

<p>"Will you listen to me, John Dee? Will you do what the angels
say? I am tired of waiting. Five years there has been of this
probation; surely I have served long enough!"</p>

<p>The old mathematician could not thoroughly understand these
wild words. He saw that the young man was in a state of
exaltation. His eyes were wide open and his lips very pale and
drawn at the corners.</p>

<p>"The angels," thought John Dee, "have rebuked him for his late
unkindness and unworthiness. Perhaps, after all, they have
converted him and he will take the Sacrament again and all will
be peaceful and agreeable."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley drew him along the corridors, up the stairs,
down some stairs to his part of the castle.</p>

<p>"I was in my laboratory, working as usual. You know that
though sometimes I find the formula, sometimes I lose it. The
experiments are not always a success. A great and devilish rage
will of ten get hold of me in my disappointment and I would
willingly turn from God and raise the devil."</p>

<p>John Dee begged him not to say those sinful words, especially
in the middle of the night when there might be ghosts or evil
spirits about. The young man laughed long, loudly and
impatiently, and continued to drag the mathematician with him,
walking so quickly and so vigorously that the old man almost
stumbled in enforced haste.</p>

<p>"Surely, Edward Kelley, the spirits will wait for us!"</p>

<p>"Uriel said, 'Haste, haste!' and Michael bid me have great
speed. They came to me in my laboratory and stood either side of
me, one with a bright sword, the other with a garland. They said
that through this means we should be reconciled and made
perfect."</p>

<p>"What means, Edward Kelley? Have we not always been diligent
and obedient. I, at least," panted the hastening old man,
wistfully.</p>

<p>"The words they spoke were unfit for any godly creature to
hear," cried Kelley, in a tone of fierce rebuke. "So damnable a
doctrine could not be pronounced by the angels of God. I fear
they are, after all, but evil spirits."</p>

<p>Dr. Dee knew not what to make of these incoherent ramblings
which Edward Kelley almost shouted at the top of his voice. When
he reached the laboratory the old man sank into the leather chair
where Edward Kelley so often made himself comfortable before the
wide hearth with his wine and his book and his wild dreams.</p>

<p>It was late spring and the air very warm and sweet. The window
of the chamber stood open and Dee could see a galaxy of stars in
the deep blue heavens. This gave him a sense of comfort, for he
felt near to the familiar spirits who loved him. The crystal,
which gleamed in the light of the lantern, which Kelley put down
on the table nearby, was set up in its frame on the red cloth on
the shew-table, and Kelley, kneeling down at once in a state of
ecstasy, began a long and involved wrestling with the spirits.
His voice rose, first shrill then low and Dee rapt, though spent,
in the great chair, could make nothing of it all.</p>

<p>He thought that there were two, then several voices in the
chamber, that of Kelley and those of the angels. He began to
tremble with a return of one of his agueish attacks, and, in a
voice full of fear, besought Edward Kelley to tell him the
meaning of his tribulations, and at length the young man, turning
round and looking over his shoulder with a diabolical grin,
said:</p>

<p>"The angels say things which I cannot bring myself to repeat.
They make remarks which are hideous to hear; they show me strange
and repulsive visions. They threaten that unless they are obeyed
all will be lost."</p>

<p>"What are their commands?" shivered John Dee. "Endeavour to
interpret clearly, Edward Kelley. This may be a matter of great
moment."</p>

<p>"They say that we are to share with each other in all
things."</p>

<p>"I believe," replied the old man, "that we have done so. I am
not conscious that I have kept anything back from you, Kelley,
though I believe you would not share your secrets with me."</p>

<p>"From now on I will do so. I will endeavour to obey the
angels. But you do not understand. I will deal no more with the
creatures; they are damned spirits."</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet with an effort as if he were held
down by arms invisible to Dee, and cried out in a voice full of
horror:</p>

<p>"Are the commandments of God to be broken?"</p>

<p>"Do the spirits advise any such blasphemy?" asked Dee in
bitter alarm.</p>

<p>Kelley ran forward, overturned the lantern so that the whole
room was in darkness and the only sparkle of light they had was
the distant glitter of the stars without the narrow window.</p>

<p>"The spirits say," he whispered, and his voice was harsh and
raucous, "that we are to share everything, even our wives."</p>

<p>Out of the dark the old man shrilled his fierce protests. He
was broken by grief and amazement.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that good angels should propound so hard and
impure a doctrine? They are, as you say, damned devils, Edward
Kelley, and we have been sorely deceived."</p>

<p>"They must be obeyed, they must be obeyed!" moaned the young
man from the dark. "They say we are fools and have little
understanding. They ask us would we be lords, gods, arbitors of
the heavens. They turn their faces away," he screamed in anguish.
"They say, 'Your own reason rises up against my wisdom. Behold
you are free, do that which most pleases you.'"</p>

<p>John Dee tried to pray. Fumbling in the dark, he went on his
knees by the great chair. With a cry of pure anguish, he
said:</p>

<p>"Have I not offered my very soul as a pawn to discharge Edward
Kelley, the crediting of him with the good and faithful minister
of Almighty God? Has it not been my life's work to withdraw this
young man from any kind of association with the bad spirits who
were with him before he came to Mortlake, and is this to be the
end of it all?"</p>

<p>There was a silence, then, from the thick dark came Kelley's
panting voice:</p>

<p>"Then if they are devils we have been deceived. The virtue
will go out of the powders and we shall be begggrs indeed. And
the wisdom that was promised you, John Dee, and which was about
to be bestowed on you, will, after all, be withheld and we shall
remain in darkness."</p>

<p>The old man, still humbly on his knees,' began to weep. He
felt Kelley's cold fingers touch his cheek.</p>

<p>"Rise up, John Dee. Go back to your wife. All is over; we
shall see no more spirits."</p>

<p>With a little fumbling he lit the lamp again and raised the
old man to his feet and put the light in his hand.</p>

<p>"This is the end."</p>

<p>"God help me!" broke from the old man in piteous anguish. "I
know not what to believe."</p>

<p>"Prove for yourself whether we should have obeyed or not. If
these bitter calamities come upon us we shall know that we were
advised by angels."</p>

<p>In the little light of the new flame his face looked
distorted. Drops of sweat stood upon his forehead and his hair
hung dank on his torn ears. He seemed then angel and devil both
to the man who had so steadfastly and passionately believed in
him for five years. One damned, and yet one who had tasted
heaven, like an angel who had been immediately, on his first sin,
cast down from Paradise.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">It was the chill and heavy hour of dawn when
John Dee returned to his wife's chamber. She was lying awake, and
there was a look of terror in her eyes. He stumbled into the
room, and had not the strength to close the door behind him, but
went on his knees on the bedstep and hid his face in the
coverlet, and at the sight of his white hairs thus brought low
she gave a cry of pure love and compassion and rose and went and
knelt beside him.</p>

<p>"What turn are our bitter fortunes to take now?" she asked.
"What have the angels told you?"</p>

<p>"Jane, get me a little cordial or a tincture of the sage
leaves such as you will find in the bottle in the cupboard by the
fireside; I feel myself much shaken. I have been arguing and
talking and praying with Edward Kelley. Many times I wanted to
come to you but he always detained me and began again."</p>

<p>She took the old man's fur-lined cloak from a chair and laid
it over his shoulders as he knelt.</p>

<p>"Do not disturb yourself so much, sweetheart; we shall cut
away from this rogue and return to England, even as you suggested
yesterday. Leave him here with Graf Rosenberg and any other dupe
who he may find. Who is he but a common scoundrel?"</p>

<p>She had never spoke so definitely before of Edward Kelley, and
her husband looked at her with a weary amazement.</p>

<p>"His ears," said she over her shoulder, where she stood by the
little cabinet by the fireplace. "You have seen those?"</p>

<p>John Dee did not answer.</p>

<p>"This is a common trickster who has stood in the pillory. He
has never seen any angels. He does not know how to make gold. He
is very clever at cozening. Satan best knows how he has done the
trick. Let him deceive who he can while you and I, sweetheart,
and the children, get free of all this devilment."</p>

<p>"God help me, it is no better. I am not altogether persuaded,
Jane. When I look at the man I cannot disbelieve him. A common
rogue and a scoundrel, maybe, yet, by chance, the instrument of
God, for it is hard to believe that his making of gold is a
trick. I thought even now I heard the voices&mdash;like the
shrieks of an owl in the room&mdash;saw the flash of Michael's
sword."</p>

<p>"What did these spirits say? Was it of such importance that
you must be summoned in the middle of the night to hear it?"</p>

<p>"Jane, he said that we are to be cross-matchedthat I am to
take his Joan, and he is to have you. That the angels will give
no further protection save on this condition."</p>

<p>Jane Dee stood silent; she leant her head against the wall,
and her hand with the glass in which she had been about to mix
the cordial sunk back at her side. She had nothing to say, while
the old man feebly and piteously recounted what he could remember
of the fierce, vehement and bitter arguments of Edward Kelley,
who, while he himself protested against the blasphemy of the
suggestion, had emphasised the penalties in store if it were not
complied with.</p>

<p>When he had at last fallen silent out of sheer fatigue, Jane,
still leaning against the wall, fell weeping and trembling, and
thus stood for a full quarter of an hour unable to command
herself to say a word, so that her husband became frightened for
her reason and even for her life. It was he who, in the end, rose
and mixed the cordial and tried to force it through her lips, but
she put it aside and broke out into a fury of anger.</p>

<p>"Never leave me, John Dee! Day and night never leave me! Oh,
my God, I have given myself to be used in what I thought was Thy
service! I have gone hither and thither like a beggar; I have
tasted every humiliation and misfortune. May I now rather be
turned into a stone than suffer this shame!"</p>

<p>"Jane! The angels say that it is not shame, that it is not to
be imputed to rashness, presumption, or wanton lust! The angels
say that we must tread underfoot all human timorous doubts. That
the true original power and authority of sins, releasing or
discharging, is from the Creator. The angels exact blind
obedience. Mr. Kelley himself seemed much upset. He washed his
hands of the whole matter, protesting he did not believe so
damnable a doctrine could be commanded."</p>

<p>In a halting voice the old man added, standing by the
immobile, weeping woman:</p>

<p>"Jane, if this be not obeyed, the angels will appear no
more."</p>

<p>"We must go away," she said dully. "We must go away at
once."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jane, yes, there is nothing else for it. We must leave
Trebona. If we cannot achieve the money we must walk."</p>

<p>She looked round the room as if already in her mind she was
taking down and packing her belongings. Then she lost her control
again and broke out into such a miserable weeping that her
husband could not endure the sight of her anguish and desperately
besought her to calm herself. She did not seem to listen to him,
or indeed to see him any more, but after a while broke off her
weeping suddenly and put on her old worn gown with the furred
sleeves and looked roundjor a light, but then saw it was not
necessary&mdash;the dawn was full in the room.</p>

<p>"I had forgotten what hour it was," she murmured, and so,
barefoot and scantily dressed, she went down the corridor to the
room where Joan Kelley always slept lonely. She woke the girl,
then went on her knees beside the bed and told her for what
purpose John Dee had been roused in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>The two women clung together for a space, weeping and
comforting each other, then Joan Kelley whispered:</p>

<p>"I will leave early with Edward Garland and his wife. They
travel to-day to Bremen; they will, out of charity, see me on my
way to England."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee packed her worn trunks with the clothes
that she and Joan Kelley had made with such labour out of such
poor and scant material. She put her little hoard of money in a
belt, hidden under her skirt, for she did not wish to be
dependent on her husband; she was exhausted by her mighty
struggle, but she did not doubt either her strength or her
victory.</p>

<p>She went about her accustomed labours with a precision and an
exactitude as if she were in no way troubled. She was, by now,
well used to organisation and controlling children and servants,
to travelling with discomfort and difficulties from place to
place, and adapting herself to the ways of foreigners. She was
sorry to leave the Castle of Trebona, for there she had had what
she greatly valued&mdash;ease and order about her and sufficient
money for all their needs. She had liked the carefully-arranged
days, the elder children's hours with the tutor, the younger
children's routine with their nurses, herself superintending all.
She had enjoyed this compact and quiet household, which she had,
from her own energy and care, created in the wing of the castle
which was far removed from the comings and goings of Graf
Rosenberg and his guests, the experiments of the alchemists, and
all the hurly-burly of the Viceroy's life which was full of
actions and excitements that mattered very little to Jane
Dee.</p>

<p>Now this had come to an end and to the prudent woman the
future looked dark indeed. If they were deprived of the patronage
of Rosenberg, where were they to look? No doubt he would provide
the means for their long and costly journey to England. But when
they had reached England, what would life be&mdash;the old house
in Mortlake again? The house which had been broken into and
wrecked by the vulgar? The long waiting for possible patronage
from the Queen, from Walsingham and Burleigh, while the added
difficulties of the long war with Spain, which would mean an
increasing penury at the English Court?</p>

<p>Jane Dee did not sigh; she set her lips firmly. This was a
future that must be faced. She would not give in nor slacken in
her effort. There were the children to be educated, and the old
man to be cared for. She tried to turn her thoughts from
contemplation of the confusion which Edward Kelley had wrought in
their lives and in her heart; she concentrated all her faculties
on what must be done, and done quickly.</p>

<p>Then she thought of one whom she had a little
forgotten&mdash;Joan Kelley. She went to the young woman and
found she had made ready for her departure with the Garlands; she
was quite composed and had thought out her future actions.</p>

<p>"I have a brother who is very fond of me and he will come as
far as Bremen for me at least. I have spoken to the Garlands and
they understand the case."</p>

<p>Jane Dee did not reply. She knew that everyone understood
Kelley's brutal treatment and absolute neglect of his wife.</p>

<p>"They are willing to take me away. It is like being let out of
a prison, is it not?"</p>

<p>"I shall be heartsick for your company," said Jane, then
fearfully: "What did you tell them&mdash;nothing of what passed
last night?"</p>

<p>"No; I said that his growing unkindness was more than I could
endure, that he threatened my very soul. And that is true, is it
not?"</p>

<p>She was kneeling on the floor folding together her garments
into a little hair trunk.</p>

<p>"You know, Jane," she said earnestly, "that I love him, that
nothing but this would have induced me to leave him." Then, as
the elder woman did not answer: "Do you think he is a devil or
possessed by a devil or damned angel?"</p>

<p>Jane Dee forced herself to reply:</p>

<p>"I think he is but a common rogue."</p>

<p>"There is some power about him," whispered Joan Kelley
fearfully; "everyone who meets him feels it. These men are like
his slaves, they believe all he says. Edward Garland told me that
though he might be a bad husband, he was a great man and knew
many wonderful secrets."</p>

<p>"He is not even very learned," said Jane Dee, "only very
clever and giving himself the air of having knowledge. He has
learnt much from my husband, but nothing deeply, nor
profoundly."</p>

<p>"I think that he bewitches people," insisted Joan Kelley.</p>

<p>Jane looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"I suppose if he were to send for you you would come back to
him?"</p>

<p>"Not to be sold," said the girl. "Anything but that!" She
looked up, her arms full of coats, and asked in a tone of
awe:</p>

<p>"Would your husband have permitted it? Would he have carried
his obedience to the angels to such a pitch?"</p>

<p>"Do not ask me," replied Jane Dee. "Sometimes the old man does
seem to me bewitched."</p>

<p>And then Joan Kelley said something which struck the root of
the matter:</p>

<p>"Why did my husband propose this bargain?" And she answered
herself simply: "It must be that he loves you, Jane."</p>

<p>Jane Dee shuddered. She, too, went on her knees and began
hastily to help put away the clothes, most of which were her own,
cut about and altered, for Edward Kelley had never given his wife
money to buy anything.</p>

<p>"What will you do for means, Joan? I have a little hoard, I
could give you a few ducats." She frowned anxiously. "You must
not be at the expense of the Garlands. Oh, the chain," she cried
suddenly, rising, and she ran into her own apartment and brought
out the chain which Edward Kelley had twice given to her.</p>

<p>When she returned, Joan Kelley was at the window, crying
softly. In the courtyard below, the cavalcade of the Englishmen
and their servants was almost ready to start.</p>

<p>"You must not cry, Joan, you must go down quickly before he
guesses of your departure, for surely he will go into one of his
furies and prevent your leaving him. Take this chain, Joan, it is
rightly yours. It is worth, I think, three hundred ducats. You
may sell it at the first town you stop at. Give it to Edward
Garland and let him do the business for you. The money will see
you safely to England."</p>

<p>"Edward bought it for you," said Joan, drying her eyes.</p>

<p>"But it is very fitting that it should be for your service.
Wear it round your neck under your cloak. Let no one see it until
you are far away from Trebona, then give your confidence to
Edward Garland, who is an honest man."</p>

<p>Edward Kelley's wife made no further protest. She was in the
habit of obeying Jane Dee. For a moment the two women clung
together; Joan Kelley felt lonely and frightened, only the
knowledge that she was escaping the devil could have given her
strength for this adventure.</p>

<p>She ran downstairs and sent a servant up for her trunk; she
had nothing but that for personal baggage. And then she got
quickly into the wagon that was waiting in the courtyard where
Mrs. Garland already sat.</p>

<p>There was a little delay for compliments from the Steward, in
the name of Graf Rosenberg, who was then at Prague, and then the
travellers started, and Jane Dee, standing at the door, watched
the cavalcade pass down the narrow, crooked streets towards
Nuremberg.</p>

<p>As she returned to her room she felt desolate for the loss of
Joan Kelley, who she had grown to love exceedingly for the five
years during which the? had been constant companions, but she was
fortified by the knowledge that she had made a triumphant move in
the difficult game that she was playing. Edward Kelley knew
nothing of the departure of his wife.</p>

<p>He remained closed in his laboratory till long past midday;
after the ecstasies of prayer, the feverish arguments of that
exhausting night, he lay in a heavy sleep as if he were drunk.
And John Dee, without food or drink, continued to pray in his
oratory.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee, though she went about her duties
quietly, was much concerned at the long absence of her husband,
by his refusal to listen to those who went to bid him down to the
midday meal and then to supper, for she feared that he was
working himself into some exaltation in which he would bring
himself to the point of acceding to this last monstrous command
of the angels. She shuddered to think that he might be brought to
such a point that he would surrender her to Edward Kelley rather
than forego his belief in the sanctity of the visitors in the
crystal, or in the good faith of Kelley himself.</p>

<p>She was shrewd enough to realise what he would forfeit by
relinquishing a belief that had been as the sun in the sky to him
for five years. Her heart ached at the thought of what he must
lose. She wondered at the justice of God, who should allow one so
single-hearted, so pure-minded to suffer so deeply. But she
thought:</p>

<p>"If I allow him to continue in his delusion we shall all be
degraded, perhaps beyond redemption. We shall become a by-word
and a laughing-stock. The children will never dare to mention who
their parents were."</p>

<p>She struck her gentle breast and addressed herself with
piteous entreaties:</p>

<p>"It is only you, Jane Dee, who can save him. You must be
neither confused nor misled nor listen to your own heart and
desires. Oh, God, help poor Jane!"</p>

<p>That evening there arrived a messenger from Pague summoning
Edward Kelley to the capital. Rudolph II. had returned to his
senses, and had been so impressed by Graf Rosenberg's account of
the gold making at Trebona that he at once sent for the
alchemist, promising him a house and servants, as much money as
he desired for his labours and a knightly title. In this
invitation there was no mention of Dr. Dee.</p>

<p>While the messenger was detailing to Edward Kelley, who had
remained sullen in his apartments, this golden news, John Dee
came to his wife, exhausted, worn and trembling after his long
prayers.</p>

<p>He refused the food and wine that she had kept ready for his
chance coming, set her aside, and sank down in the window-place
and opened wide the casement so that the evening air blew full
over his face.</p>

<p>He looked very old, she thought, and near death. Her whole
being melted in pity towards him. She called up all her strength
to meet the words which she knew he was going to say, and after a
pause, during which he had sat with the wind blowing on his face,
he spoke:</p>

<p>"Jane, I see there is no remedy for it. We must do as the
angels say. You must leave me and go to this man. If it offend
not God, it offend not me. Let this be as the angels have
ordered." Crossing his breast, he repeated again: "The
angels."</p>

<p>Jane Dee replied quietly:</p>

<p>"This bargain cannot be. Joan Kelley has ridden away with the
Garlands this morning because of this shameful proposal."</p>

<p>"If the angels are thwarted they will come no more," cried the
old man piteously. And he added: "As I came from the oratory just
now I heard that the Emperor had sent for Kelley. See, this is
the climax of our fortunes."</p>

<p>"Let him cheat the Emperor as he has cheated us. Punishment
will come in time."</p>

<p>"Jane, Jane, do you think he has cheated us? Do you think the
angels are but lies?"</p>

<p>"Is it not now proved?" she asked vehemently.</p>

<p>"Our disgust and doubt, Jane, may but show our lack of
faith."</p>

<p>"I have faith in God," replied the woman, "but not in Edward
Kelley."</p>

<p>She saw that her firmness impressed the old man, and she
approached him eagerly, exerting all her strength to persuade
him.</p>

<p>"I have sent away his wife. I have given her the gold chain
with which he presented me twice. We must also escape."</p>

<p>"Escape, Jane!"</p>

<p>"It will be nothing less than an escape, it seems to me, for
we have to elude the designs of a wicked man."</p>

<p>"I loved him like a son," lamented John Dee, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"Sometimes," replied the woman quietly, "we do love what it
evil. It is for us to overcome that passion."</p>

<p>He looked at her searchingly and she returned his gaze
steadily, for she knew that he would never surmise her secret. He
was so wrapped in other worldly affairs that he had little
leisure or art whereby to read this human heart, and Jane Dee
smiled in pity of his blindness and a certain scorn of her own
safety.</p>

<p>"The Emperor has not summoned you," she reminded him. "When
Graf Rosenberg comes to Trebona he is closeted with Kelley, and
you are not sent for. Your best workmen are taken from you, the
finest laboratories are given to this man. He who began as your
assistant and sucked all your knowledge from you, has become your
master. He sets his foot on you and has become so presumptuous
that he has the effrontery to make you a proposal such as I think
no man ever made to another before."</p>

<p>"But, if it came from God, Jane&mdash;God, who is above all
laws&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It does not come from God for it is contrary to God's
commandments," she replied firmly. "It comes, I think," she used
the expression that she had used to Joan Kelley, "it comes from a
common rogue."</p>

<p>John Dee slowly repeated these two terrible words which to him
were seal of the ruin of all his hopes.</p>

<p>"A common rogue, Jane! Have we been deceived for five years by
a common rogue?"</p>

<p>"I was never deceived," she reminded him quietly. "You would
not be bridled nor persuaded."</p>

<p>"I am not altogether persuaded now, Jane. The angels said many
wise and beautiful things; they gave me much strange knowledge.
If all this were the invention of Edward Kelley, he is, at least,
a remarkable man."</p>

<p>But even this, in her bitter scorn and sorely wounded pride,
she would not concede.</p>

<p>"He has read many books and filched much from you. No doubt he
is clever at penmanship and drawing diagrams. Has he not twice
stood in the pillory for forgery?"</p>

<p>"Jane, we do not know as much."</p>

<p>She said strongly:</p>

<p>"Let him go. We can live our lives without such as he."</p>

<p>"But if the angels never come again, Jane?"</p>

<p>"We do not want such angels that this man can summon."</p>

<p>She laid her fine but firm hand on his shoulder and looked
straightly into his poor, tired face, into his dim eyes, stained
by the difficult tears of age.</p>

<p>"If no more angels come, sweetheart, if there is darkness and
silence about you, cannot you wait patiently until this short
life ends?"</p>

<p>"Not so long for me, Jane. Short, indeed, for me."</p>

<p>"No, nor for me, either, as I think," she replied bravely.
"Though I am only thirty-two years of age, I do not feel as if I
had so much more of mortal toil before me."</p>

<p>"Jane, do not leave me! I could not endure that you should go
first."</p>

<p>She smiled tenderly as if at the caprice of a child.</p>

<p>"And just now you would have parted with me to Edward
Kelley."</p>

<p>"I was bemused by long prayer, fasting and watching. I see now
that the thing could not be done. Why did he suggest it,
Jane?"</p>

<p>At this she was at a loss how to frame her answer, for here
was a subject that must never be put into words.</p>

<p>"Very likely it was mere insolence&mdash;a test of your
submission," she replied at length, and she added proudly: "Why
should he desire me? There are many more beautiful women in
Prague and Vienna, easily at the beck of the man who can make
gold. Look at me&mdash;I am worn, I am faded, I am aged before my
time, I am full of the cares of four children. I am a woman
twelve years married; is it likely that Edward Kelley, or any
other man, would desire me?"</p>

<p>"You are beautiful to me, Jane. I have much admired and
commended your care and patient and loving kindness. I was
pleased to think that you were happy here in Trebona, Jane, and
had about you comfort and luxuries. That we had found at last a
secure patron&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edward Kelley's patron," she interrupted&mdash;"not
ours&mdash;and one who we must leave."</p>

<p>"Then we put to sea, Jane, like rudderless ships. You know how
little there is to be hoped for from the Queen, who ages and
grows obstinate.</p>

<p>"Yet let us at least return to England. It is time Arthur went
to school. There are your rents to collect, and the house at
Mortlake to set in order."</p>

<p>At these practical remarks, he gave her a loving smile.</p>

<p>"There is my faithful Jane&mdash;always busy with small
cares."</p>

<p>"These are not small cares, John Dee, but the things whereby
we live."</p>

<p>"Can you endure another journey, Jane? It will take us nearly
a year to arrive in England."</p>

<p>"I can endure anything," she replied, "save to stay under the
same roof as Edward Kelley."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane knew that she would not so easily be able
to leave Trebona. There were many excuses to be made, many people
whose opposition must be met and put aside. There were
explanations to be given to Graf Rosenberg, to his wife, and to
all their train of followers; to those learned men who came so
frequently to Trebona, and who expected John Dee to live
permanently in Bohemia.</p>

<p>But she did not falter nor slacken her preparations for the
journey.</p>

<p>Most to be feared was the parting from Edward Kelley. She knew
he would not lightly allow her to go. She did not ask her husband
what had passed between them, nor did he offer to tell her; she
kept her mind as best she might off the matter, but Edward
Kelley's sullen fury might be guessed in that, even in the glow
of his sudden golden fortune he did not come abroad and as usual
flaunt himself when he was happy and triumphant, but remained
closed in his own apartment. And on the second day after the
coming of the Emperor's messenger, her husband told her that he
had written out a prayer or covenant&mdash;a devout and holy
document, wherein he had declared with a sincere and open heart
the purity of his intentions and his honest doubt that he had
been deceived in Edward Kelley, praying the Lord to guide
him.</p>

<p>He had left this paper on the altar in the Castle Chapel and
scarcely had he risen from his knees after this action, when
Edward Kelley had broken in, torn the document into pieces and
cast it down on the chapel floor, setting his heel on it and
turning on the mathematician a look so diabolical that he could
no longer doubt that he was in the presence of a damned soul
stained by all manner of impurity and guilt.</p>

<p>This revelation, so terrible to the old man, he bore with a
fortitude that surprised his wife. It was as if he, in his turn,
had received a certain supernatural strength. He went up to his
own room with a steady step and, taking down the Book of
Mysteries, Liber Mysteriorurn, in which were recorded all the
angels' biddings and all their sayings, mystical, strange and
wonderful, he wrote in it, with his beautiful clear hand, an
account of the last damnable command from Uriel, Michael and the
little angel named Ben.</p>

<p>The Book was not yet filled; there were many blank spaces,
and, as he turned them over thoughtfully, he wondered when he
should write in this again&mdash;if he would ever find another
medium like Edward Kelley, if there would be any more angelical
sayings to write down, if the angels would ever visit him again.
And at the thought of the blank years ahead and the great and
heavenly joy which had now dropped entirely out of his life, he
suffered a sharp pang as if someone had driven a knife in his
heart, and leant back in his chair, almost deprived of life.
Through all his troubles, difficulties, battles and moments of
despair with Edward Kelley, his occasional doubts as to the
origin of the angels, through all his material troubles, the lack
of money, the moving from place to place, the impossibility of
convincing the Emperor or the King of Poland, the struggle to
find a patron, he knew that he had, during those five years, been
happy, for he had felt himself, during many mystic and marvellous
hours, in direct communication with God. And more, he had even
felt himself at one with God, and so believed that he had
attained, or was on the verge of attaining, that perfect wisdom,
that unity with the Almighty which to him was the end and be-all
of Hermetic philosophy. Now all was over&mdash;a quest of clouds,
indeed! Cloudswhich had been sometimes menacing, sometimes
stormy, sometimes pure, sometimes golden, but alwa ys luring,
beckoning up and on. And now they were gone, dissolved, vanished,
like those airy shapes which rose from the crucible in which
chemicals melted over the clear fire of the furnace.
Gone&mdash;all gone, and before him nothing but the increasing
darkness of a weary old age, with all his long and painfully
accumulated knowledge which he had been piling up since he was a
boy of fourteen heavy on his back, like a great burden of
rubbish, useless to him, but not to be cast away.</p>

<p>Making a strong effort over himself the old man closed the
Book of Mysteries and fastened the clasp, but at the thought that
he might never open it again such a pain overcame him that he
laid his head on the cover and wept.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Edward Kelley attired himself in the finest of
the suits he had lately had made by Graf Rosenberg's tailor. It
was the dress of a nobleman, as befitted one who had been
suddenly called into the favour of the Emperor, who was to take a
prominent place at Court, one to whom the Emperor had sent a bag
of ducats and promise of a title.</p>

<p>He took much care in this attiring, and arranged his bright
hair precisely over the tattered ears. It was no longer necessary
to wear the black cap; a clever barber, such as he could now
afford could do this business for him.</p>

<p>After these preparations, shaved, powdered, perfumed and in
every point neat and splendid, Edward Kelley sought out Jane Dee.
Nor did she refuse to receive him, for she knew that she must
come to this meeting before they left Trebona.</p>

<p>As he entered her apartments where he had not been for some
time, he noted with a jealous eye her preparations for departure.
Trunks and bales filled and ready to be fastened stood against
the wall; the hangings, lent for her greater comfort and luxury
by the Countess Rosenberg, had been taken down and lay ready to
be returned to the kind mistress of the castle. And Jane had put
off the richer dress of green velvet which the Countess had given
her lately and sweetly begged her to wear, and wore again that
well-mended, but graceful gown which she had brought with her
from England, which her own hands had often scoured and turned,
and now of a faint, indescribable colour like leaves at the end
of autumn.</p>

<p>Her face was very smooth and pale, and her eyes reddened by
weeping or sleeplessness, and even her mouth was colourless and
slightly parted over her glistening teeth. Her long, very fine
hands, which lately had grown much thinner, were busy with a
length of mending, as she sewed together the ripped lining seam
of a fur coat. Money was plentiful enough while they remained in
Trebona, but Jane knew her husband's recklessness and complete
inability to be economical, and she saved what she could, even in
the midst of plenty.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley came and stood in front of her with great
familiarity.</p>

<p>It was March, still cold, and generous fires burnt on the wide
hearths.</p>

<p>"You try in every way to spite me," he said, narrowing his
pale eyes in her direction. "Why do you dress yourself like that,
in rags? You are as plain as on the day when we first met."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why I should go splendidly," she replied.
"I dress as befits my means and my prudence."</p>

<p>At that he left that subject and began to rage at her for the
sending away of his wife.</p>

<p>"You were no longer fit to be her guardian, Mr. Kelley. She
has returned to England, where she will be safe."</p>

<p>"You try to thwart me, Jane Dee. Do you think that you will
win in this struggle? It is useless," he added rapidly, "for you
to shut yourself away and defy me. I know you very well."</p>

<p>"If you knew me well enough, Mr. Kelley, you would spare any
more words, for you would be aware that they would be
hopeless."</p>

<p>"You think, then, to return to England?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She dropped her sewing and looked at him steadily.</p>

<p>"To return to England and never to see you again."</p>

<p>He laughed in her face; his manner was full of suppressed
excitement.</p>

<p>"You cannot have heard all my news. You do not know who I am
now&mdash;Sir Edward Kelley, a great man with the Emperor. He has
given me an estate and a title. He tells me I may establish
myself in Prague as a Councillor of State."</p>

<p>"I should not have thought," replied Jane Dee coldly, "that
the Emperor would have been so easily deceived. But he is, no
doubt, as they say, mad."</p>

<p>"Therefore," replied Edward Kelley insolently, "he will better
serve my turn. Do you not see that the world is at my feet? I
have discovered all that your husband was seeking after. It is
mine, I say&mdash;mine, and not his."</p>

<p>Jane Dee shook her noble head.</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Edward Kelley. My husband did not seek for
what you sought, nor have you found what he desired."</p>

<p>"Come with me to Prague, Jane. I can make you almost a queen.
Do you not realise that I have discovered how to make gold?"</p>

<p>"I realise," she countered sorrowfully, "that you have found
out how to trick men into believing that you can make gold."</p>

<p>"Still no belief in me, still no faith! What will satisfy
you!"</p>

<p>"I require no satisfaction, Mr. Kelley. We are parting so
soon; what does it matter what we think, one of another?"</p>

<p>"We shall not part, Jane Dee. Do you think that I have
laboured so long, endured so much, travelled so far, to be at
last disappointed of all?"</p>

<p>"But you said just now that you had attained all!"</p>

<p>"Am I to be disappointed of you, Jane? You were my all. It is
for you for whom I have laboured so long!"</p>

<p>A faint colour came into the woman's pale face. She turned
aside and looked into the fire.</p>

<p>Five years&mdash;almost to a day&mdash;since he had come to
Mortlake, and they had been together, she seated and he standing
by the fire in much the same attitude as they held now. And then
she had known both her own heart and his. She had nothing to say
to him, but he continued talking vehemently, putting before her
all that she might have if she would but follow him to
Prague.</p>

<p>"And it can be in honour, Jane Dee. Your marriage with the old
man may be dissolved. I can persuade him that Heaven wills
it."</p>

<p>"You cannot persuade me, Edward Kelley." And for the third
time she used that expression which she believed fitted him best:
"I know you for a common rogue!"</p>

<p>At that he stood still and silent for a space, and she looked
up at him with a certain compassion for his hurt. He was then in
his thirty-first year, good-living and luxurious appointments had
made of him a fine personage, he possessed more than beauty; so
strong was his curious attractions (which no one could meet him
without perceiving) that it seemed to Jane Dee as if, instead of
standing several feet away from her and with averted face looking
at the flames, he was standing close to her and had her firmly by
the hand so that she could not depart from him.</p>

<p>"This old man, this old, foolish man," he began to
murmur&mdash;"for what is his knowledge but a burden to him? What
will he ever do with the remainder of his life? The Queen of
England is avaricious and half ruined by the Spanish Wars. What
will she do for him? There is no fortune before him nor before
you or his children. You will become old and poor and
despised."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Jane Dee quietly, "for you such a life is not
possible."</p>

<p>"I want to take you away with me&mdash;come to Prague, to
Vienna. Now I have the Emperor's favour we can go where we will.
Have you not longed and dreamt, Jane Dee, of such splendour and
liberty, of ease of mind and comfort of body?"</p>

<p>"And damnation of soul, as I think," she added softly, her
elbows on her knee and her pale face propped in her hands. She
felt her body very weak, but her spirit strong and upright within
her. She thought that even if he fell into one of his furies and
raged and stormed she could face that tempest.</p>

<p>But what he did do was harder to endure.</p>

<p>He turned suddenly and went on his knees beside her as he had
done before when she had pitied him.</p>

<p>"I love you, Jane&mdash;you, and you only! Does it matter to
you? We were meant to be together always, to help and comfort
each other, Jane. You have known me from the first."</p>

<p>She looked down at him tenderly.</p>

<p>"From the first, Edward."</p>

<p>"A common rogue, you said, and I was no better than that when
I came to Mortlake. I had stood in the pillory, Jane. I had had
my ears nailed to the wood."</p>

<p>"I knew, I knew," she murmured.</p>

<p>"I had been in prison&mdash;no matter where, nor for what
offence."</p>

<p>"No matter," she repeated.</p>

<p>"I will not tell you my real name, nor where I came from, nor
what I am, you know enough of me, Jane."</p>

<p>"Indeed I know enough."</p>

<p>"I was glad to fly from England, Jane. This quest that was so
much to your husband, was to me an escape from the law, you know
that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that."</p>

<p>"But now I shall go back to England triumphantly. They will
not care who I was if they thought I could make gold. The Queen
herself, Burleigh, Walsingham&mdash;all would welcome me."</p>

<p>"Do not boast to me," she said, but tenderly, as if she
rebuked a child. "We must part. Your tricks can serve no longer,
Edward. Why must you push it all to an extreme?"</p>

<p>"I could wait no longer for you," he muttered mournfully.
"Besides," he added&mdash;there was a note of sincerity, she
thought, in his voice&mdash;"the angels do speak to me&mdash;I
swear they do. Maybe I do not always interpret them aright, but I
hear voices and I see visions. Before God, I can swear that."</p>

<p>"I should swear nothing before God were I you, Edward Kelley,
for surely you have offended Him." And with infinite passion she
added: "Perhaps the angels deceive you as you deceive
others."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think so, too. Sometimes, I think that they are
but hallucinations, or evil dreams, or the spirits of the damned.
But never doubt, Jane, that I have some power. Even to this
making of the gold I will not confess that I cheat. No, I will
not confess!"</p>

<p>He seemed deeply frightened, and a light distortion passed
over his face. He clasped his hands and still at her knee and
catching at the worn borders of her shabby gown, he cried out to
her as if he were pursued, and entreated her to save him.</p>

<p>"Only you can do it, Jane? only you? Am I not worth more to
you than that old man? He will go peacefully to his grave,
wrapped in his dreams, but I need you. Supposing I were to be
lost and damned, Jane, and you, comfortable with your old husband
and your family, were to think of it and hear me crying out,
perhaps in Hell&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hid his face in his hand and long shudders shook his
slender body. Jane Dee looked at him compassionately but
unshaken. She knew no tremors, doubts nor fears; her faith was
single, simple and infinitely strong. Nothing to her could
obscure right and wrong. She knew neither subtleties nor
hesitation and duty to her could never have either two names or
two faces.</p>

<p>She rose up very gently and left him kneeling there, his face
hidden on the arm of her chair, and she said without reproach or
malice or as if she were in any way using rebuke or menace:</p>

<p>"You have chosen your way, Edward Kelley. What you pursued you
have found. What you strove for you have gained. You have the
Emperor's favour; you say you can make gold. You believe in your
angels and they have not lied to you. Be content, then. As for
your poor wife, she is moved from your malice&mdash;I am glad I
have done that. I gave her your chain!"</p>

<p>He looked up, angry at that.</p>

<p>"My chain, which I took so much trouble, first to buy, and
then to redeem for you!"</p>

<p>"It was more becoming that she should have it. It will take
her comfortably to England. She loved you, Edward Kelley, but has
wasted her whole life because of your trickery."</p>

<p>"I cannot think of her," he said angrily.</p>

<p>He got to his feet and his eyes showed flushed with fury. She
thought that one of his storms of fury was about to overtake him,
and she smiled at him in pity.</p>

<p>"Do not think to frighten me by passion or tempests. I am not
to be moved, either by one way or another. This thing has worked
itself out. You are no longer my husband's partner nor a member
of my household. The preparations are long and tedious, but as
soon as we may, we shall leave Trebona."</p>

<p>"So shall I," he said softly. "I go to Prague. I tell you the
Emperor will receive me with all honour. My Patent of Nobility is
coming any day. Think of that, Jane Dee&mdash;common rogue you
called me, and I shall be a nobleman, and perhaps wear the Golden
Fleece. I shall have a train of servants and a fine house."</p>

<p>"It is a perilous elevation," she replied quietly. "This
Emperor Rudolph is a fickle man. I hear that his favour is easily
lost. There are many who promised they could make gold, rotting
now in the White Tower."</p>

<p>"I am safe," he replied, with a burst of his arrogant
self-confidence. "I only require you for my perfect happiness.
Come with me to Prague. Bring, if you will, the old man also. I
can tell the Emperor that he is indispensable to me&mdash;that we
are in a partnership that shall not be dissolved, and I am
dependent on him for the success of my experiments."</p>

<p>"He would not go with you now. Neither would I. I am very
tired, Edward, and we waste time and words." She looked at him
yearningly and saw his face twitched into a grimace as if he were
about to cry. He took his kerchief from his pocket and held it
before his lips; she thought he stifled a sob. She knew him, she
thought, through and through, and in truth she knew him as well
as anyone would ever know him, and yet she was in a wonder as to
what was false in him and what was true&mdash;a strange,
unstable, wild creature I She pitied him as much as she loved him
and she wondered a little why they had not been allowed to meet
when she was free. Surely if she had been his wife she could have
turned him to honourable ways and saved him from the pit to which
she saw him hastening.</p>

<p>"How cold, cruel and bitter you are," he whispered, "to thus
abandon me."</p>

<p>She did not answer this futile reproach; a great lassitude was
over her; this was the end, and she wondered what she would do in
the future if duty should be insufficient to fill the long, grey
days.</p>

<p>He leant his head on the stone beside the mantleboard and
began to sob. She looked at him in his grace and beauty and
piteous finery, in all the trickery of ornament and riches of
which he was so childishly proud. She had conquered and she knew
that he knew it. He would not trouble her again; his last wild
tricks, his last desperate throw, had failed.</p>

<p>She said simply and tenderly:</p>

<p>"God save you, Edward Kelley? God bless you, even yet!"</p>

<p>And she left him.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">One of Edward Kelley's assistants, John Carpio,
an Italian, came to Dr. Dee and told him, with much awe, that his
master had broken up the shew-table and flung down both the
crystal and the opsidian stone. He had torn the red cloth and
smashed the seals, made with such eagerness and care, and he had
forbidden Carpio or any other of his assistants to mention again
the angels, Uriel, Michael, Madimi, or any, as he called it, of
"that damnable crew."</p>

<p>John Dee stood silent; the partnership was indeed dissolved.
Then he forced himself, after a while, to speak kindly to John
Carpio, who was an honest, diligent fellow, and to ask him to
fetch the two stones, the crystal and the black, and bring them
secretly away from Kelley's apartment to his own.</p>

<p>"They are mine and I would like to take them to England. If
any of the seals be unbroken, bring those, also."</p>

<p>In the back of his heart was the wild hope that he might find
another skryer who would be able to converse with the angels.</p>

<p>John Dee made his preparations for departure from Trebona. He
bore himself with great courtesy towards Edward Kelley and even
seemed to rejoice at the good fortune which the young alchemist
had received in the summons from the Emperor.</p>

<p>Graf Rosenberg made no difficulties at the household which he
had so long sheltered at the Castle of Trebona being broken up.
Nothing mattered to him but the retention of Edward Kelley, the
man who knew how to make gold. But he behaved very generously to
John Dee, the mathematician whose knowledge had proved so
useless, and loaded him with presents and promised to pay the
expenses of his journey.</p>

<p>Safe conducts had come from the Queen, and with them letters
from Burleigh, urging the two alchemists to return. Burleigh had
already heard rumours that Edward Kelley was able to make gold
and that he was likely to come high in favour with the Emperor.
Sir Edward Dyer, the Queen's agent in Germany and the godfather
of Arthur Dee, had indeed written home to the Lord Chancellor,
giving many accounts of Kelley's miracles, reporting that he
could, indeed, make gold, that he himself had seen hoops of
silver and rings of gold made by the alchemist, so that Burleigh
replied eagerly:</p>

<p><i>"If his knowledge is as certain as you make it, what would
you have me think could stay him flying to the service of his own
sovereign? If he is afraid of old reports, actions and disgraces
being brought up against him, let him be assured that he shall
have his Queen's protection against all impediments that shall
arise."</i> And the anxious statesman concluded with a practical
request that Kelley should send her Majesty:</p>

<p><i>"As a token, a good round sum of money, say enough to
defray the charges of the Navy for this summer."</i> </p>

<p>The Lord Chancellor also asked for a prescription for the
Philosopher's Stone with a proof of manufactured gold and
begged:</p>

<p><i>"Something of your operation to strengthen me before next
winter against my old enemy, the gout."</i> </p>

<p>These letters from his one-time patron, in which there was no
mention of himself, could not but cause a pang to Dr. Dee, and he
noted that Edward Dyer, once his own especial friend, had
forsaken him for Kelley now that he could make gold, while these
lavish promises of patronage only raised a smile on the lips of
the young alchemist.</p>

<p>He told Dyer, who much followed him about, and all his other
friends that he would prefer Prague to England. Upon which Dee
said mildly:</p>

<p>"Do not let them think that you are afraid to face them at
home. Burleigh is not a fool, nor is the Queen. If you do not
return they will think you a cheat."</p>

<p>"You did not use to speak to me like that," replied Kelley,
with his wild smile. "If you would return to England why do you
not get you gone; your preparations take too long."</p>

<p>But these were at length complete. Graf Rosenberg was not at
Trebona, and did not return to bid farewell to the alchemist,
though he had so profusely provided for all his expenses.</p>

<p>John Dee, on the day before he left Bohemia, arranged in his
own room various precious articles which he did not wish to take
with him to England. Foremost among them was the convex glass
which the Queen had so often admired, that which he had taken out
into his garden to show her when she came to see him the day that
his young first wife died. Edward Kelley had often envied it and
now longed for it to present to the Emperor, and John Dee gave it
him simply together with the powder, the book, and such as
remained of the burnt manuscript of St. Dunstan, and many piles
of diagrams and designs which Kelley had taken down at the
dictation of the angels.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley received these treasures carelessly. John Dee
could not understand why he seemed to be so uneasy, as if
devoured by a secret frenzy.</p>

<p>"You have had all you wish, Edward Kelley. It is my heart and
not yours that should be broken."</p>

<p>To which Kelley replied, biting his forefinger stained by
chemicals:</p>

<p>"I will not leave you." Adding wildly: "I will rejoin you at
Stde. I shall accede to Lord Burleigh's request. I shall return
to England and put my powers such as they be, at the service of
the Queen."</p>

<p>"That is as God may direct," replied the old man gravely; "but
between you and me the partnership is dissolved."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Three new coaches were built in Budweis for the
long journey, a dozen coach and saddle horses were sent from
Prague, three waggons were hired for the goods, books, furniture;
there was an escort of twenty-four soldiers. The whole expedition
cost six hundred pounds, John Dee spending nearly all of the
profuse treasure which the Viceroy had sent him, and making, as
usual, no count for the future.</p>

<p>On the day that this train of coaches and waggons of servants
and soldiers was waiting ready in the courtyard, Edward Kelley
was not to be found. John Dee, a little wistfully, asked a
bellows-boy if his master was not coming to bid them farewell,
and the servant said he had not seen him since the night before,
when he had locked himself into his laboratory.</p>

<p>This seemed, to the gentle old man, an unkind parting, after
so many years together. He still could not quite believe in the
duplicity of Edward Kelley, nor in his fabrications of those
heavenly interviews, the old man clung tenaciously to the last
shreds of hope that after all, some, at least, of the heavenly
visions might be true.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will join us at Stde. He has been summoned to
England, you know, Jane. Perhaps, after all, he dare not
disobey."</p>

<p>"He dare not obey, I think."</p>

<p>"But, Jane, even if he is the rogue you think him, all would
be forgiven now, if he can make gold."</p>

<p>"Do you still believe he can make gold? No, that is why he is
afraid to return. He may be able to deceive the Emperor, but
would not be able to deceive Burleigh and the Queen."</p>

<p>But Jane herself, in her neat faded dress, and her mended
furs, waited a little on the steps of the castle and lingered
over her farewells. There were so many kindly people to
thank&mdash;servants and guests and assistants. She went from one
to another with a word of gratitude and regret for all, but still
she glanced over her shoulder through the dark empty doorway, up
the dark empty stairs, thinking perhaps one other might come and
once more look at her with his strange pale eyes, say some word
of defiance or remorse or anguish, but no one came, and the
moment for departure could be no longer delayed.</p>

<p>Jane took her seat in the coach beside her husband, the
youngest child on her knees, and as they were about to start a
servant came running to the coach window and told them that he
had learnt that Edward Kelley, with John Carpio and the other
assistants, had ridden with the dawn to Prague; he had seemed
distracted and had left no messages.</p>

<p>"It seems as if we should never see him again," sighed John
Dee mournfully, as the beautiful Hungarian horses began to draw
the coach out of the courtyard. "Prague! Yes, he has gone to the
Emperor. He will be a great man, Jane, while we return
empty-handed, nay, more, despoiled."</p>

<p>The old man spoke without irony and looked towards his wife
for comfort, and she smiled at him tenderly. She understood his
pain and that helped to ease her own dreadful sense of loss, of
frustration and futility.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade began to take the long road towards Nuremberg
Jane Dee closed her eyes in the dark corner of the coach. Her
destiny had come upon her unawares, stealing from her all
happiness and pleasure, but not her strength of spirit nor her
peace of mind.</p>

<p>For a moment she imagined herself in Prague with Edward
Kelley, free of fatigue, of duty, of disappointment, at ease with
one human being who to her meant the completion of existence. The
wife of Edward Kelley, the man who could make gold, Emperor's
favourite in the city of alchemists, the man who she herself had
so often and with such emphasis named "a common rogue." The slow
rumble of the coach wheels, creaking over the rough road fell
into the rhythm of that phrase: "A common rogue, a common
rogue."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, violently disentangling herself from
dreams; she saw her husband's face, distorted by sorrow. "He may
openly lament, but I can never show my grief. He has lost his
angels. What have I lost?" And the sound of the wheels taking her
further and further away from Prague ground out the refrain: "A
common rogue, a common rogue."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">On Christmas Day, after a year and a half of
travelling, John Dee and his wife entered the old house at
Mortlake, which was dark with an atmosphere of disillusionment
and weariness.</p>

<p>Jane's brother had not kept it carefully; the furniture had
been damaged by the crowd when they had broken in to destroy what
they considered the doctor's magical instruments; very many of
his famous and costly books were ruined or stolen. The
tapestries, such as they were, had gone from the walls, and the
garden was quite neglected; rank, broken weeds obscured all the
parterres and hid the paths. A fall of snow had blocked the door
and the returned travellers had to wait while it was shovelled
away.</p>

<p>Yet to Jane, standing chilled in the cold, nipping wind, there
was a certain pleasure in the sight of the swift, grey river and
the low grey clouds and the drooping, bare willow trees and the
fiat land on the north bank, this landscape, cold, dull and
bitter as it was, was home and not without a certain power to
soothe.</p>

<p>There came poignantly to her recollection, the day when Edward
Kelley had come to this very door now defaced by disuse, when she
herself had admitted him, and he had walked into her house, and
in her life to be the centre of her thoughts for five years.</p>

<p>They had not been without news of him during their homeward
travels; he was now Sir Edward Kelley, and great at the Emperor
Rudolph's Court; across Europe crept rumours of the wonders he
could do; he had resisted all the baits offered by Burleigh, all
the lures cast out by Walsiegham. Safe in Prague, the city of the
alchemists, he made gold for the insane Emperor, rings, hoops,
chains, cups of gold, piles of ducats.</p>

<p>Jane thought of that as they passed over the threshold of
their ruined home, as she contemplated their hopeless prospects,
poverty for them, gold for Kelley.</p>

<p>How fantastic it sounded! But the man himself seemed to her
unearthly, and sometimes she thought of him as an evil, perhaps a
lost spirit; she was not dazzled by his present fortune.</p>

<p>The despoiled house looked sad enough. Jane disposed her tired
children as best she might and set about with her implacable
diligence and energy to re-create her home, making beds, getting
her fires lit, arranging for a meal, while her mind was busy on
the problem of the future. Her husband was in as bitter straits
as he had been when he had left Mortlake six years before; Graf
Rosenberg's money had been spent on the long and costly journey
home, the quest, undertaken with such an eager heart and a high
hope, had proved a delusion, such golden fruit as their joint
labours had brought forth had gone to Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>The patient woman checked her bitterness by the thought of her
husband's pain. When she had made a little order in the panelled
parlour and left the children in the care of the hired servants,
she went down the long passage to the workshops and laboratories
where she knew the old man would be among his ruined
treasures.</p>

<p>She was secretly remorseful that she had ever disliked these
things and grudged the money that he spent on them, for now they
were all broken and cast down by the vile hand of ignorance, and
with them, she knew, was the bruised heart and spirit of John
Dee.</p>

<p>The day when Edward Kelley had first come to Mortlake was with
her; she had shivered then as she shivered now, hurrying through
the dark passage; she sheltered her little lamp with a shaking
hand, the faint beams showed her the flaking plaster on the
walls, the cobwebs, the marks of damp, her quick feet disturbed
dust on the floor: "How can I still this desolate misery? Only by
not thinking of myself."</p>

<p>She found him where she had known he would be&mdash;old,
lonely, standing in the flickering light of a rush taper, looking
at his wrecked quadrant and his files of torn and cast down
books, at his smashed instruments and broken furnaces, all the
precious treasures of a lifetime overturned, ruined, queer,
distorted, black shapes, thick powdered with dust in the cross
light of his small taper and her small candle.</p>

<p>Jane Dee moved towards her husband; gaping chests filled with
torn manuscripts, open books with the leaves defiled by filth and
ripped across, impeded her way. His back was towards her; he
stood in front of the light, which cast his huge, wavering shadow
black over the cold furnaces and dimmed the glitter in the broken
glass of the smashed retorts.</p>

<p>"John, sweetheart!"</p>

<p>She put her hand on his worn sleeve; she was proud then that
never, for a second, had she thought of leaving him for the place
where she really wished to go.</p>

<p>"Jane, all lost, all ruined, all gone!"</p>

<p>The woman thought, "This is the misfortune that we tried to
escape from&mdash;we fled many hundreds of miles and have
returned to meet it."</p>

<p>She saw that he had set up in front of him on a pile of
slashed books the two shewstones, the opsidian and the crystal.
She felt confused and faint with distress and remorse.</p>

<p>"No more angels, Jane; no more visions."</p>

<p>She rested her face against his sleeve. Perhaps he would have
preferred to remain in his delusion? To have gone with Kelley to
Prague, to have kept the angels, Uriel, Madimi and Michael and
lost her, poor Jane? Perhaps she had sacrificed her own vague,
restless, intense desires for nothing, perhaps it would have been
wise and kinder to have assisted in the imposture, to have
ignored the evil aspect of the bargain, to have dissimulated and
led the old man, cheated but happy, to his grave.</p>

<p>These were the first doubts of herself that she had had and
they did not long obscure her single-minded purpose.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, I have lit the fires, the children are asleep,
and there is some supper ready. To-morrow we will put the house
in order."</p>

<p>She took up the shewstones in her cold, tired fingers and put
them inside the desk; as she touched these strange objects that
Edward Kelley had so often handled, it seemed as if his fingers
closed upon hers and the violence of her emotion became more than
she could endure.</p>

<p>She looked round for help and saw the high-set window square
above the disorder of the neglected room with the broken
treasures, After a wild day of clouds and snow the heavens were
clear at last, and on seeing the familiar stars the astrologer's
wife felt a chill peace descend upon her disappointed and tired
spirit.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">Jane Dee took up the old life of anxiety, of
borrowing, of selling, of accepting charity from friends. Behind
all these shifts and contrivances her spirit remained untouched,
pure and austere, like a mountain spring behind dark rocks. She
had her poignant pleasures&mdash;her eldest son, Arthur, went to
Westminster School, with a letter from his father to Mr. William
Camden, then second-master of Saint Peter's College, and his
friend. John Dee wrote affectionately of his son's hasty
disposition on an anxious Jane's behalf:</p>

<p><i>"Sir,&mdash;My wife had delivered to him some more apparel
and furniture in a little chest with lock and key, with some
towels to wipe his face on after the morning and other washings
of hands and face, willing him to buy a stone bason and a pot of
a potter to have always clean and wholesome water in for his
use...and I beseech you of one thing more: that his writing, both
of Roman and secretary's hand, decay not, but rather be amended,
for a fair writing is often times a good grace to matter very
simple."</i> </p>

<p>Jane Dee found a moving sadness in taking her eldest boy to
school, in packing the little chest, in sewing his shirts, and
giving him the instructions that she knew he would not heed. Soon
he would not need her any longer. She would, if she lived, be
only an ageing woman, contriving, anxious, overworked. All her
life had been service; she asked herself if one who toiled
incessantly for others could be wholly unhappy.</p>

<p>The girls went to school at Mortlake. They were all healthy,
docile and lively; their mother kept from them the lack of money,
of certainty, and tried to'make the old house cheerful.</p>

<p>She inquired at Chipping Norton after Joan Kelley, but the
girl had not returned home. And presently there came letters from
Sir Edward Dyer, saying that Kelley had followed his wife's
movements and had finally summoned her to him at Prague, where
they now lived in great state in the house given them by the
Emperor.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Jane Dee, "that he is kind to her."</p>

<p>And something dark, odd and menacing loomed on the threshold
of her thoughts. She looked curiously at herself in the little
mirror they would soon have to sell, because it was too costly a
rarity for her to be able long to keep it. She appeared already
an old woman&mdash;there was no colour either in her face, her
hair, or her eyes. Her grace was eclipsed also, she stooped and
walked slowly. Her comfort was in the children, the bold boy at
Westminster School, the pretty girls with their tutor, the little
children at her knees&mdash;in them and in the grey river which
she could see from her bedroom window, flowing steadily to the
sea.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p class="first">For a long while there came no news of Edward
Kelley to the house at Mortlake, and then, suddenly, this: he had
been arrested at Prague in the midst of his splendour and sent to
the Castle of Purglitz.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Dyer sent this account of the affair:</p>

<p>One of the Secretaries of State, escorted by a large
contingent of the Imperial Guards, had broken into Edward
Kelley's house to take him while he was at dinner. But he had
received some warning and had ridden off an hour or two before
towards Rosenberg. He, however, being weary, had stopped at
Sobislaus and there had been tracked down by the soldiers, who
seized him while he slept and rudely dragged him off to prison,
disregarding Kelley's appeal to Rosenberg, who was Burgrave of
Prague as well as Viceroy of Bohemia. Sir Edward Dyer did not
give the reason for the Emperor's sudden rage.</p>

<p>John Dee much wondered about this strange event.</p>

<p>Had Rudolph discovered Edward Kelley to be a cheat? Had he
found out that the making of gold was a trick? Was it neither of
these, but a mere falling of the Caesar into his usual melancholy
and madness?</p>

<p>Dr. Dee took Dyer's letter to Jane, where she sat glancing
down at the river in between her busy work with her needle; she
gave him, as usual, the ready kindness of her smile. When she had
heard the news from Prague, she still smiled.</p>

<p>"There ends many dreams," she said.</p>

<p>It was all in that, doubts, reasonings, deductions, hopes and
regrets. There was nothing left over which she could make words.
Her smile deepened.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. &mdash; POSTLOGUE</h2>

<p>A VERY old, beggared, ruined man lived in a cottage at
Mortlake&mdash;a little, mean, half-tumble-down place on the
river bank close to the large house used for tapestry-making,
which had once belonged to the old man himself, but had long
since, with all his other possessions, passed out of his hands.
He had outlived all his friends, and the people of Mortlake,
Richmond and Brentford knew John Dee only as a name, and had
forgotten his fame, glory and great exploits.</p>

<p>The children were afraid of him, for he was supposed to be a
wizard and the new king had raised a great hue and cry against
witchcraft, and it was very dangerous to be charged with the
practising of black magic. Up and down the land witch hunts went
on, and John Dee's frantic petition to Parliament that he might
not be confounded with devil-worshippers, and raisers of hellish
imps, went unheeded as the babblings of an old, forgotten
pedant.</p>

<p>His wife was dead. Though Jane had been so much younger than
her husband, she was dead long ago, with three of her daughters,
of the plague. Two of the boys, Michael and Theodore that were
born abroad during the quest, were dead also in their tender
years, and Arthur and Rowland were grown men, away on their own
business. There remained to the old man only his daughter, Kate,
a quiet, gentle woman who performed without complaint the duties
of servant and nurse.</p>

<p>There was one other who came to see the old man daily, and to
talk with him on matters that none but these two could
understand, and this was Roger Cook, who, after a lifetime, had
returned to his old place and his old master. Often John Dee, who
was eighty years of age, would forget much of his learning, and
even his present circumstance of beggary and of ruin, and would
sit, happy in his poverty, at the door of his tenement, looking
out at the swift river, and talking of Mr. Kelley's powder and
the angels who had appeared in the shewstone.</p>

<p>One evening&mdash;it was July, and brilliant weather&mdash;as
he sat at his poor door, looking at the river, which the sunset
turned to the colour of flame, he called Roger Cook, and began to
tell him of the days in Prague and Cracow, when Edward Kelley had
made gold&mdash;"bars of gold, lumps of gold, showers of gold,
piles of gold dust, hoops and rings of gold, gold like the river
yonder, Roger Cook."</p>

<p>"And," he added, "it is a long time since I have heard from
Mr. Kelley. I wonder how he continues in the favour of the
Emperor? Is the Queen at Greenwich, Richmond, Isleworth or
Nonesuch? I must send her another petition, for I am being
reduced to beggary. It is a long time since the Queen came to
visit me; I should like a sight of her barge on the river."</p>

<p>"It is merciful," thought Roger Cook, "that the old man's
memory fails him." The Queen had been dead and lying in
Westminster, close to the school where Arthur had gone years ago
with his locked chest, on the return from the fruitless quest,
and Edward Kelley was long since slain in prison, and the Emperor
who had glorified him had been deposed, and was kept closed away
as a lunatic. And in England everything was changed with the
coming of a foreign king, who was afraid of witches and
devils.</p>

<p>"Gold, all gold!" repeated John Dee, looking at the river.
"But gold was not the object of the quest, was it, Roger Cook?
No, I wished to attain wisdom&mdash;it was that I sought
for."</p>

<p>He put his quivering hand on Roger Cook's rough sleeve.</p>

<p>"Have you seen my great jewel, the shewstone, in which the
angels used to appear, Uriel and Michael?"</p>

<p>In his pity Roger Cook replied:</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen it, Dr. Dee&mdash;it must be a great
treasure."</p>

<p>"Go and fetch it. Kate will tell you where it is. Bring it out
and let us set it here in the sunshine, and perhaps the angels
will appear again. Bring, too, my Book of Mysteries, which you
will find with the Bible by my bed."</p>

<p>Roger Cook turned into the cottage. Katherine Dee was laying
the supper.</p>

<p>"The old man fails; he has asked for his crystal and his Book
of Mysteries."</p>

<p>"It were kind to take it," replied Katherine piteously, "Allow
him to think that the angels have come again."</p>

<p>In a chest of sweetwood Roger Cook found the crystal
(carefully preserved, when almost everything else had been sold)
which Edward Kelley had set up nearly thirty years before on the
grand and costly shew-table with the scarlet cloth. By the
bedside he found the Bible and Dr. Dee's diary, in which the
entries had become of late very scarce, and were written in a
shaking hand, and near this the Book of Mysteries, in which
nothing had been written for twenty years.</p>

<p>Roger Cook viewed these objects with a profound melancholy.
His own life had not been successful nor happy. He could remember
the ardent days of his youth when he too had hoped to surprise
some marvellous secrets in the laboratory of Dr. Dee. And this
was all that was left for either of them to content themselves
with&mdash;a globe of common crystal, a book full of rhapsodical
accounts of the vision of an impostor.</p>

<p>Roger Cook knew that the old man had recently tried several
skryers, but none of them had seen anything in the globe. But he
took the smooth ball and the Book to where the old man sat, in
patient resignation, his tall figure, in the shabby gown bent
slightly forward, his hands on his knees, and his eyes fixed on
the glittering golden river.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is my precious jewel. Bring out a stool and set it
here in the moonlight, Roger Cook."</p>

<p>The other obeyed and the crystal gave out long sparkles and
flashes of broken light.</p>

<p>It was an extremely beautiful evening; the weathervane on
Mortlake Church flashed in the heavens like a low-suspended
star.</p>

<p>"See," cried John Dee, "I am not in my dejection and beggary
utterly forsaken and alone; the angel appears in the stone. Do
you not see him, do you not hear his voice?"</p>

<p>"I both see and hear it, master," replied Roger Cook
dutifully.</p>

<p>He looked keenly at the old man, and though he had thought
just now that his powers had failed, it seemed to him that in
reality John Dee's mind was clear and strong, and he knew well
what he was saying, what he was listening to and what he was
seeing.</p>

<p>"Roger Cook, it is Raphael. He has a message for me again, at
last, after so long. He says that I am to go on a long
journey&mdash;to friends beyond the ocean, to seekers of wisdom
from the directions in the Book of Saint Dunstan, the jewels
beyond price are to be made known to me. He tells me to set my
worldly affairs in order by all means possible."</p>

<p>"Who is to go with you on this journey?" asked Roger Cook
quietly. "Did Raphael say that, master?"</p>

<p>The sun was fading; the river and all the world had turned a
tender, violet-grey.</p>

<p>"He said that I cannot be without my daughter, Kate, nor
without you, Roger Cook, my best friend. He makes many promises.
He says the king will be kind to me, that I shall have all my
honours returned to me."</p>

<p>"Will you trust to such bare promises, master?"</p>

<p>"He, Raphael, himself, will accompany me as he did Tobias,
even to the end of the journey. Take up the Book of Mysteries,
Roger Cook, my eyes are no longer strong, and write therein these
messages."</p>

<p>The old man was silent for a space, staring into the crystal
which no longer, after the withdrawal of the sun, flashed
light.</p>

<p>"There are other things I would ask Raphael. Where is my
silver double-gilt bell salt? I have been bereaved of my own
goods. Why do I daily miss something from my house?"</p>

<p>Roger Cook was silent. He knew that Arthur Dee, who was a
struggling doctor and had as much as he could do to provide for
his own family, had taken away these things to sell secretly for
the maintenance of his father and sister. Roger Cook made a
little money himself&mdash;he drew astronomical charts, and made
distillations&mdash;which was spent in maintaining the
household.</p>

<p>"The Emperor," continued the old man&mdash;"did he not promise
to send me money?"</p>

<p>"The angel," said Roger Cook, "for I hear his voice now,
clearly, tells you to let it go and speak no further of it. The
Emperor of all Emperors will be your comfort. You have no need of
Rudolph, nor of the Queen, nor of the King, nor of any earthly
monarch."</p>

<p>The old man turned his dim eyes from the dim crystal.</p>

<p>"Write in the Book, Roger Cook, write in the Book."</p>

<p>And to please him, his friend went into the house and fetched
an inkhorn and quill. Seated on the doorsill, he began to write
down what the angel Raphael had just said to his master.</p>

<p>"It is strange, is it not," said Dr. Dee, in a clear and
reasoning voice, "that Jane and Edward Kelley, who were both so
young, should die, and I be left?"</p>

<p>"Maybe," said Roger Cook, "you will soon, master, know this
and all other mysteries."</p>

<p>"When I take the journey with Raphael&mdash;when I take the
long journey to meet my friends and discover the great
secret."</p>

<p>Katherine Dee came out of the cottage to say that the supper
was ready and the air getting chill. Between them they helped the
old man within doors, Roger Cook carrying reverently the
shewstone and the Book of Mysteries. They humoured him by talking
of preparations for the journey&mdash;the final and triumphant
quest.</p>

<p>After that Raphael was with him daily, giving him
instructions, comfort and advice. When he went abroad with his
slow steps, his trembling frame supported on the arm of his
daughter and Roger Cook he did not see the scornful glances of
his neighbours, who looked with contempt at a tedious old fool
who had outlived his time. He did not hear the half-frightened
jeerings of the children, who, at a safe distance from Roger
Cook's stick, hooted and whistled after the old wizard who could
bewitch cattle, who collected egg shells and sent witches to sea
in them to raise storms.</p>

<p>He saw none of these things for the angel Raphael was with him
always. And John Dee was happy, for he was assured at last of the
triumphant issue of the quest.</p>

<p>On the last day of the year, Raphael vanished into the azure
glory of eternity and he took John Dee by the hand and led him
with him, far beyond the quest of clouds, so that those who came
to bury John Dee and take him to his grave in Mortlake Church,
were surprised by the look of joy on his face. His last words
were:</p>

<p><i>"Happy is he that hath his skirts tied up and is ready for
a journey for the way shall be open to him. The burr cleaveth to
the willow stem, but on the sands it is tossed as a feather
without dwelling."</i> </p>

<p>He remembered these sentences from the past; Gabriel had
spoken them long ago at Cracow, by the mouth of Edward
Kelley.</p>

<p>Roger Cook carefully put away the shewstones, in which no one
would ever again behold an angelic vision, and closed the Book of
Mysteries, in which there were to be no more entries.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. &mdash; HISTORICAL NOTE</h2>

<p>JOHN DEE, M.A. of Cambridge (usually referred to as Doctor
John Dee on the strength of a presumed but untraceable degree
granted by the University of Louvain, where he was a student from
1548-50) is one of the almost forgotten figures of the great
Elizabethan age. His career, of which such abundant details have
been preserved, has long been clouded by legend and obscured by
calumny.</p>

<p>His long life (1527-1608), covered the English Renaissance,
the material and spiritual glories of the reign of the last
Tudor, the outburst of national pride and creative energy which
followed the defeat of the Spanish Fleet in 1588, to the <i>fin
de sicle</i>, weariness and dis-. illusion mirrored in
<i>Hamlet</i>. He lived through events so important as to be
mentioned in the briefest text books&mdash;the massacre of Saint
Barthlemy, the rise and fall of the Medici-Valois group, the
execution of Mary of Scotland, the accession of her son to the
English throne, the accession of Henri Quatre to that of France,
the discoveries of men like Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh in
the New World. He might, if he had chosen, been present at the
first productions of the "William Shakespeare" dramas, and read
the first editions of Cervantes and Montaigne; he might have
handled, fresh from the printing press, the translation of Ovid
by Arthur Golding, that had such a marked effect on English
letters, or North's rendering of Plutarch, which served as the
basis for <i>Julius Caesar</i> and <i>Anthony and
Cleopatra</i>.</p>

<p>In the realm of science in which his own interests lay, he was
contemporary in his youth with Nicholas Kopernicus, who performed
that extraordinary feat of the human intellect, the discovery of
the falsity of the Ptolemaic system of the Universe, which
mankind had implicitly followed for nearly two thousand years,
and, in his old age, with Tycho Brahe and Galileo.</p>

<p>It is a striking tribute, both to the learning and the
intellect of John Dee that he warmly supported the Kopernican
solar system when even men of the calibre of Francis Bacon
hesitated to accept it; this philosopher wasted years of study in
an attempt to reconcile the beautiful fantasy of the ancient
Egyptian with the pure logic of the modern Pole.</p>

<p>At the same time John Dee reserved to himself an implicit
belief in astrology; he never seems to have doubted his ability
to read the stars or to cast a horoscope. Astrology and astronomy
were then synonymous, and the former term which, to our ears,
denotes some quasi charlatanism, fantastic or even comic, was in
the 17th century applied to what was considered a grave branch of
science which was firmly believed in by learned men until a much
later date. Though John Dee lived almost to the dawn of the age
of reason and logic as represented by philosophers and scientists
like Newton, Locke, Spinoza, Des Cartes and Liebnitz, yet he
suffered grievously from the Act against Witchcraft (1604) which
was the Law of England for a century and a half, and saw the
publication of <i>Demonologie</i>, the curious and passionate
assertion of the belief of James Stewart in a personal Devil of
the crudest type, with ability to perform endless evil conjuring
tricks at the invocation of wicked persons.</p>

<p>The outburst of ignorant malice, spiteful bigotry, interested
loyalty, superstitious fear and genuine religious zeal that
followed these two events, swept away John Dee, "the late Queen's
conjuror," into a dishonourable obscurity, from which his
reputation has hardly yet, perhaps never will, recover.</p>

<p>In vain did the old, ruined man passionately petition the
fanatic King at Greenwich (June 5th, 1604) that he might be
cleared from the grievous slanders that named him "a conjuror or
caller or invocator of devils." The astrologer was so much in
earnest that he offered to share the hideous punishments then
being dealt out to the is so-called witches if any evil practices
could be proved against him. He was, perhaps, fortunate in that
he was merely ignored by both the King and Robert Cecil, and not
dragged out to perish on the rack or at the stake, with many who
were as innocent as himself.</p>

<p>Though his name is mainly associated with his extraordinary
angelic visions and a vague reputation for necromancy and magic,
the scientific attainments of John Dee were solid and
astonishing; he suffered much from being in advance of his times
in some directions and bewildered or misled by the limitations of
contemporary knowledge in others.</p>

<p>He was equipped with all the learning possible to his period.
He was a great mathematician, perhaps the first of his
time&mdash;esteeming "mathematics as only second to theology."
This comparison between pure science, mathematics and
ispeculative philosophy, theology, shows the then prevalent
weakness of reasoning, which John Dee could not rise above, and
which was the root of all his troubles. Despite their keen
interest in logic, their erudition, their anxious searching into
new byways of knowledge, few of these. 17th-century scientists
(if so they can be named) were able to distinguish fact from
fantasy, or to wholly shake off superstitions weighty with the
traditions of centuries and often heavily enforced by the
powerful commands of religion. It is significant that to all
these men the fumes that rose from the chemical compounds in
their crucibles, linrbecks and retorts were spirits or ghosts; it
was the great chemist, J. B. Helmond, who first named them gases.
Indeed, it is no overstatement to say that the most learned men
of the 17th century had to struggle through a thicket of
ignorance, confusion, delusion and error, which could scarcely be
conceived by the most casually educated person of to-day.</p>

<p>The <i>savants</i> of that period had to labour with problems
that are now explained to and easily solved by every schoolboy,
and to struggle to attain, by way of infinite difficulty, much
knowledge that is now so commonplace as to be despised. This was
the age that bred both Paracelsus and Giordano Bruno, both
Kopernicus and James I.</p>

<p>John Dee endeavoured to accomplish several works of definite
usefulness; the reform of the Calendar, the foundation of a
National Library, the recovery and preservation of the books and
MSS. scattered at the dissolution of the monasteries, the search
for and purchase or copying of, rare and valuable Continental
books, the collection and annotation of genealogies and documents
of antiquarian interest such as deeds, charters, etc.</p>

<p>He was an authority on optics and was employed by such
navigators as Adrian Gilbert to draw maps and
charts&mdash;Mercator was to him "my Gerard." It is not difficult
to understand how such a man, already in years and the author of
elaborate and enthusiastic books on almost every known branch of
knowledge, should have felt it neither strange nor impossible to
extend his researches beyond what only a later age somewhat
hesitatingly decided are the bounds of human learning. The man of
science became the mystic without being conscious that he had
changed the direction of his studies. As Gilbert or Raleigh were
prepared to encounter any wonders in their pioneer voyages, to
accept with nothing but the simple zest of discovery tailed men
or gold mines, geese growing on trees, giants, dwarfs, or any
other marvels, so John Dee was prepared to step from the
mysteries of the refraction of light or the wonders of the early
telescope to what was to him the hardly vaster mysteries of
Angelical conversations.</p>

<p>Alchemy was not to be, for many years to come, discredited, in
the last half of the 16th century it was revered as perhaps the
first of the sciences and so curiously bound up with
transcendentalism that though it at one end attracted the rogue,
the charlatan and the fool, at the other it attracted such men as
Thomas Vaughan in whose brother's poems is a distinct flavour of
the highest type of Hermetic philosophy.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Silurists and mystics of the late 17th century,
Donne, Vaughan, Crashaw, Herbert, Campion, may be described as
the fine flower of that strange plant that had roots in the
"broyling" kitchens of the almost mythical Geber.</p>

<p>It is not yet clearly known how far the researches of the
alchemists were for an earthly or a heavenly prize; in the
opinion of some commentators, the bewildering formula, designs
and rhapsodies of their writings, does not refer to the
transmutation of metals, but to that of the soul of man. Their
goal was not, such argue, the making of gold from base
substances, but the making of a perfect creature from frail
humanity; the "secret of secrets," "elixir of life,"
"Philosopher's Stone," etc., is not, therefore, a solid
substance, but the attainment of that divine wisdom which shall
make mankind as God&mdash;the very Promethean fire itself. And
all the half incomprehensible, often purposely misleading and
confusing, rigmarole and jargon of alchemistical writings, is to
be taken symbolically. This is obviously, to a certain extent,
true, and there seems little question that from this angle John
Dee regarded alchemy; his quest was for the divine wisdom that
should at once coalesce and explain all his own undigested
learning&mdash;"the pure and perfect chrysolite" that should
raise him into a sphere of intellectual and spiritual supremacy
that he could yearn after without being able to visualise. On the
other hand, it has been abundantly proved that very many
alchemists were simply searching for the means to make gold and
that Elixir which should bring perpetual youth, health and
felicity. Mingled with the flock of quacks who preyed on the
credulous with wild tales (the type so bitterly satirised in
<i>The Alchemist</i>, by Ben Jonson) were numbers of earnest men,
genuine chemists as far as their knowledge went, who sincerely
believed that the transmutation of metals was the possibility it
has since proved to be. Undoubtedly, many of them thought they
had discovered the great secret, to attain which so many lives,
fortunes and reputations had been wasted.</p>

<p>And here a fascinating enigma arises: how was it possible for
these men to so delude themselves and others as to leave behind
the numberless circumstantial accounts by eye-witnesses that such
seeming miracles did take place?</p>

<p>It seems impossible to credit that these early chemists had
sufficient knowledge really to perform anything like the
manufacture of even some substance that passed for gold, yet, on
the other hand, it is difficult, even allowing for the mass of
falsehoods, legends, inaccuracies and cunning confusions that
obscure the subject, utterly to discredit the often repeated
testimony of those who have left evidence behind that they did
see the transmutation and handle the resultant gold. One of the
most remarkable of these testimonies is that left by a man of
undoubted veracity and enlightenment, F. F. Helvetius; this was
published at the Hague in the year 1667. J. B. Helmond in <i>De
Vita Sterna</i>, declares that he made gold and handled the
Philosopher's Stone.</p>

<p>When we come to the problem of the "sittings," which occupied
so much of John Dee's time for nearly seven years, we are on even
more debatable ground. There seems, indeed, hardly any advance
from Elizabeth's day to our own in what is now termed
Spiritualism. John Dee's reverent and careful account of the
conversation of the angels through the medium, might have been
written to-day at any <i>seance</i>, save that the language is
more beautiful and the thought more noble than that usually
employed or expressed by modern seekers after psychic knowledge.
The vistas opened are the same, the mysteries hinted at or
half-revealed, the same, the symbolism has the same turn and the
solution is left, then and now, equally in the balance.</p>

<p>Be it noted, however, that Dr. Dee and his medium never
endeavoured to raise the spirits of the dead. Though they are so
often falsely described as necromancers they never indulged in
what, to Dee at least, would have been the horrible blasphemy of
meddling with departed souls. The bold scenes in <i>Macbeth</i>,
presumed to have been written just before the death of John Dee,
show us the kind of creature who was believed to deal in such
horrors. These were the sort of rites that John Dee most
abhorred, from which he endeavoured so eagerly and piteously to
disassociate himself. He conversed, be it emphasised, only with
the pure Angel of God, who had power over all devils and imps of
Hell.</p>

<p>This fact makes the "sittings" recorded in the <i>Liber
Mysteriorum</i> more mystical and dignified than are many of
present-day <i>seances</i>, when Auntie Mary and Uncle Tom will
return to utter banalities through the medium of the illiterate
lispings of some Indian child or Eastern sage who has to spell
out the longer words.</p>

<p>Dr. Dee had a higher ambition than the desire to speak to the
spirits of the dead; he stretched out to God Himself, and his
angels spoke, often tediously, often incoherently, but never in a
babble of childish patter, their language was always beautiful
and they often expressed themselves in passages of great power
and splendour. This brings us to the crux of the whole problem:
who was this medium through whom alone John Dee could converse
with the angels? The accounts that we have of the man who named
himself Edward Kelley are confused and full of error; he has
become even more a legend than has his master. It is almost
impossible to discover the real man under the mass of error,
prejudice and tradition that have grown up around his name. But
the final verdict would seem to be that he was an arch impostor,
a heartless charlatan who cozened a trusting old man, a rogue
with a criminal record, wanted by the law, whose miserable end
was a just punishment for his rascally career.</p>

<p>Edward Kelley must have been, however, more than a common
rogue, just as John Dee was more than a common dupe. Though his
learning fell far short of that of his master, it was, for his
age, considerable. He must have been, somewhere, well educated to
have been able, as he was able, to cope at the age of twenty-six
with the most erudite man in England. His draughtsmanship as
shown in the most complicated designs and diagrams is as
remarkable as the beautiful penmanship of Dr. Dee. Edward Kelley
was able to hold his own in any company and possessed, to an
extraordinary degree, that fascination known as a magnetic
personality. And this, despite his frequent rages and furies and
his lapses into vulgar debaucheries, his laziness, selfishness
and rudeness.</p>

<p>If one assumes that the angelic conversations were his sole
deliberate inventions, they show him to have been a person of
considerable literary ability, some poetic vision, a profound
insight into character, and one possessed of at least the
knowledge of much grandeur of thought, high moral precepts and
desirable virtues. It is very noteworthy that the medium
constantly repined at the spirits and their sayings, was often in
fierce rebellion against them, while they, in their turn,
frequently rebuked him for his evil life, lack of faith, and
general irreverence.</p>

<p>If this was play-acting on Kelley's part, it was very
cunningly done and the double part of heavenly denouncer and
earthly backslider must have been difficult to sustain. It seems
reasonable to believe that Kelley, probably a Kelt of peculiar
upbringing and partially crazed by the half discoveries of his
own day, then so bewilderingly blending with the half-delusions
of the past, was possessed of some clairvoyant powers; he may
have been often self-hypnotised, self-deluded, entirely confused,
and the rages that passed as diabolic possessions may have been
the conflict of a divided personality. It must be confessed,
however, that save for dubious previsions of the defeat of the
Spanish Armada and the execution of Mary Stuart and a statement
about the wrecking of Dr. Dee's house in Mortlake made before the
news came to hand, Kelley's revelations contain nothing
extraordinary and are, too often, a farrago of nonsense.</p>

<p>By what trick he persuaded so many people that he had actually
made gold can never now be known. It cannot have been easy to
deceive Rudolph II., himself an adept who had already been
severely taken in by false alchemists, or John Dee himself, or
men like Dr. Curtius. The facility with which a belief in the
discovery of the great secret was accepted, is shown by the
letters of the great Lord Burleigh piteously entreating Kelley to
return to England and put his knowledge at the service of the
Queen, or to send enough money to pay "for the Navy next winter,"
or "one coin" as an earnest. Arthur Dee, the Westminster
schoolboy who learnt his lessons from William Camden and became a
doctor at the Court of Russia and a friend of Sir Thomas Browne
of Norwich, firmly believed in the truth of Kelley's assertions.
He often declared that while in Central Europe he again and again
had seen gold made.</p>

<p>Af ter his parting with John Dee at Trebona, Edward Kelley
returns to the mystery from which he came.</p>

<p>This novel, <i>I Dwelt in High Places</i>, makes no attempt to
solve that mystery or to impose the deliberate inventions of
fiction on to known truths. No imaginary character is used, and
for that reason I have felt obliged to keep to what facts we
possess about these people and to interpret them by what insight
and understanding I may command. It is rather the reconstruction
of a dead dream, perhaps a dead nightmare, than the chronicling
of sober fact that I have felt myself engaged on, for John Dee's
visions were very real to him and there was much that was,
surely, other worldly about Edward Kelley. It may be added that
there is less of legend or fable in this novel than in many
accounts of these two men that profess to be history. I have
tried to see through the eyes of the three characters
concerned&mdash;Dee, Kelley and Jane Dee, without adding any
incidents invented by myself, or putting forward any personal
opinions or speculations.</p>

<p>This note is for the possible reader interested in the
groundwork of novels founded on fact, it may be easily ignored by
those who like their fiction to be fiction.</p>

<p>In the hope that this same possible reader may be desirous of
extending his acquaintance with the subject of Queen Elizabeth's
astrologer, the following notes are added:</p>

<p>The first "life" of John Dee was that by Dr. Meric Causabon.
It is a notice attached to the first edition of the <i>Liber
Mysteriorum</i>, 1658.</p>

<p>Though Causabon was very fair to Dee, the psychic
conversations were to him "a work of darkness."</p>

<p>The next account of John Dee is in the Latin <i>Vitae
Eruditissimorum et Illustrium Virorum</i>, by Thomas Smith,
Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, 1707.</p>

<p>There follow many articles in various books, dictionaries and
magazines of which the more important are the "lives" in the
<i>Biographica Britannica</i> and the <i>National Dictionary of
Biography</i>, both of which are extremely unfavourable to John
Dee.</p>

<p>A careful, sympathetic and most useful life of the astrologer
appeared in 1909&mdash;<i>John Dee</i>, by Charlotte Dell

<p>The accounts of Dee given in books on necromancy, alchemy,
etc., are mostly inaccurate and highly fanciful. A. E. Waite, for
instance, in his <i>Lives of the Alchemistical Philosophers</i>,
even, among other errors, gives the name of the Emperor who
received Dee in Prague as Maximilian. A well-known German book on
the subject is <i>Culturhistorische Bilder aus Bhmen</i>, by H.
Svatek.</p>

<p>All the above are based largely on Dee's own biographical
writings. These consist of&mdash;<i>The Diary</i> (original MS.
in Ashmolean College Bodleian Library, Oxford, transcribed by J.
O. Halliwell Phillipps and published by the Camden Society,
1842). The <i>Liber Mysteriorum</i> (the first five books in the
Sloane MSS. British Museum, the other twelve published by Meric
Causabon, 1659). The <i>Compendious Rehearsall</i> (the MS.
partly destroyed by fire), but transcribed and finally printed by
the Chetham Society, 1857, under the
title&mdash;<i>Autobiographical Tracts of Dr. John Dee, Warden of
the College of Manchester</i>.</p>

<p>In this work, Dee gives a list of his other writings which
then amounted to forty-nine. Considerably more are known to have
existed, many were never printed. All are now rare.</p>

<p>In the Sloane MSS. British Museum, is <i>The Book of Enoch</i>
and the <i>Claves Angelicae</i>, which contain the elaborate
diagrams taken down during the "sittings" with Kelley. The famous
<i>Cristallo</i> and several of the tablets and seals used by Dee
and Kelley are now in the British Museum; they came from the
collection of Sir Thomas Cotton.</p>

<p>A catalogue of Dee's famous library has been made by Dr.
Montague James and printed for the Bibliographical Society,
1921.</p>

<p>The angelic conversations in <i>I Dwelt in High Places</i> are
those actually recorded by Dee, the letters quoted are also
genuine.</p>

<p>The astrologer's house at Mortlake stood till well on into the
19th century. He was buried in Mortlake Church; according to
tradition his gravestone was at the upper end of the chancel, had
a brass upon it, and was removed during the Protectorate.</p>

<p>Legend says that the children who had dreaded him as a wizard
during his life always chose his tomb to play upon.</p>

<p>There was some doubt as to what actually was the mirror that
John Dee prized so highly, that was shown to Queen Elizabeth, and
finally passed to Rudolph II. From Dee's description it appears
to have been similar to the mirror at present in the Dublin
Museum, which the author saw a few years ago, and which is
remarkable enough to have seemed very startling in the 16th
century.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be noted that, despite the "Biblical"
flavour of the angelic speech, the Authorised Version had not
appeared at this period; Dee and Kelley, like "William
Shakespeare," probably used the Geneva Bible, Covendale and
Tyndale's translation from the Greek version, 1525.</p>
